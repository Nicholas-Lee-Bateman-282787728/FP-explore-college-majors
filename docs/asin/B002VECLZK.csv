1291627,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B002VECLZK,A. Boston,"[6, 9]","I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing. I didn't even read the back, but from the cover art, expected a lighthearted family comedy(like The Family Stone maybe?). That is not what I got...I'm on the verge of saying I hated this movie, but honestly think its one of those films where everyone will take away something different from it. I'm 29, so I don't easily relate to having grown children and being retired. This movie made me really sad because I find it be so true to life these days, where people seem to rarely make time for each other. It was difficult and upsetting to watch a father try so hard to really get to know his kids, while they were usually just lying through their teeth to him.The redeeming parts for me was the ending, which made me feel better, and the actors. Robert De Niro(Frank) was spectacular and entirely convinced me of his character's good intentions with raising his kids, that maybe fell a little short. His grown children were a little one sided, but that may be how you were suppose to experience them, from Frank's point of view.On the whole I would say if you go into it knowing what it's about, give it a try and you might really enjoy it.

Robert De Niro is amazing in this movie but even his brilliant acting can't save the flat, slow premise. Drew Barrymore's late appearance in the film saves the day!

1291630,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B002VECLZK,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Kirk Jones remake of the remake of a 1990 Italian film Statto Tutti Bene was written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. This movie stars Robert DeNiro stars in this film directed by Kirk Jones about a retired guy who wants to be close to his children in the same way as they were close to their mother his wife who has recently passed away. Since they have given excuses for not showing up for a family reunion at their childhood home in Elmira NY, he takes upon himself to go and visit them so that he can get to know them and spend time with them. So he sets off hoping that the children have some time for him from their busy successful lives. However the children that he thinks are successful professionally are not. They have had setbacks and failures and they are putting up a brave face for their father. Somehow during the course of the visits and his interactions with his children and their families he realizes that they have not been truthful with him and have never been close to him. Just when you thought that Robert DeNiro was hell bent on destroying his legacy, comes this pleasant movie. Surely this is not among his best but fans of DeNiro and easy paced cinema would not be disappointed. The cast is great and perform their parts well. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy his oldest daughter, Robert his son is played by Sam Rockwell, Rosie is played by Drew Barrymore. His older son is David and we get to see him in only one brief scene towards the end.  I loved this film about reconnecting with your family and loving your parents. DeNiro is splendid and plays the part of Frank extremely well.

1291631,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002VECLZK,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","One thing that I am most grateful for when it comes to `Everybody's Fine' is that it proves once again that Robert DeNiro is a great actor.  For anyone who is convinced that, like his counterpart Al Pacino, DeNiro is washed up and reduced to a mere caricature of his former self needs to set some time aside to watch this small, intimate and earnest little film.  The film itself is not a great movie (it is layered with too many clich&eacute;s to be great) but DeNiro sheds his usual `tough guy' persona and delivers something honest and relatable, heartbreaking and beautiful.His best performance in nearly a decade, easy.The film tells the story of a widower, Frank, who can feel his family (which consist now of four grown children) slipping through his fingers.  They are all set to come visit him for Thanksgiving and they all wind up canceling.  This sparks something in Frank, moving him to avoid doctor's orders and hightail it cross country to see his children, all of which seem too busy or preoccupied to spend time with him.  That, and they are all apparently lying to him about everything.  As Frank visits his children (surprise, daddy's home) he uncovers truths about them and also about himself.There are moments here that really speak to the audience, but they are sadly muddled by clich&eacute;d generalizations and a choppy subplot involving a wayward son that only works part of the time.  Still, the overall effect of the film is light and warming and it really should be seen.  It didn't get the reception it deserved (everyone was predicting a DeNiro Oscar nom shortly before the film was released and then, well, that didn't even come close to happening).  DeNiro alone is just magnificent here and totally deserving of the praise and attention.  The rest of the cast works well with him, from Barrymore to Rockwell to Beckinsale.  I only wish that the film allotted for more time with each child.  Frank is rushed off so quickly that we really only get glimpses of his children and the impact they have on him.  If they had only been fleshed out a little more than this film could have transcended the lighthearted genre it pegged itself and it could have been something deeper, more meaningful.But I get the feeling that this is exactly what they were going for, and on that front they succeeded.In the end I totally recommend this, especially to anyone who has been a fan of DeNiro over the years and is longing to see him do something worthy of his name once again.  This is for DeNiro what `About Schmidt' was for Jack Nicholson, only `About Schmidt' was a much better film.",3,DeNiro is back at the top of his game...,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2604,"['One', 'thing', 'am', 'most', 'grateful', 'when', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'once', 'again', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'great', 'actor', 'anyone', 'who', 'convinced', 'counterpart', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'DeNiro', 'washed', 'up', 'reduced', 'mere', 'caricature', 'former', 'self', 'needs', 'set', 'time', 'aside', 'watch', 'small', 'intimate', 'earnest', 'little', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'layered', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'be', 'great', 'DeNiro', 'usual', 'tough', 'guy', 'persona', 'delivers', 'something', 'honest', 'relatable', 'heartbreaking', 'beautiful.His', 'best', 'performance', 'nearly', 'decade', 'easy.The', 'film', 'story', 'widower', 'Frank', 'who', 'can', 'feel', 'family', 'consist', 'now', 'four', 'grown', 'children', 'slipping', 'fingers', 'are', 'set', 'come', 'visit', 'Thanksgiving', 'wind', 'up', 'canceling', 'something', 'Frank', 'moving', 'avoid', 'doctor', 'orders', 'hightail', 'country', 'see', 'children', 'seem', 'too', 'busy', 'preoccupied', 'spend', 'time', 'are', 'apparently', 'lying', 'everything', 'Frank', 'children', 'surprise', 'daddy', 'home', 'truths', 'also', 'himself.There', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'really', 'speak', 'audience', 'are', 'sadly', 'muddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'generalizations', 'choppy', 'subplot', 'involving', 'wayward', 'son', 'only', 'part', 'time', 'Still', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'light', 'warming', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'reception', 'deserved', 'everyone', 'was', 'predicting', 'DeNiro', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'then', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'happening', 'DeNiro', 'alone', 'just', 'magnificent', 'here', 'totally', 'deserving', 'praise', 'attention', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', 'Barrymore', 'Rockwell', 'Beckinsale', 'only', 'wish', 'film', 'allotted', 'more', 'time', 'child', 'Frank', 'rushed', 'off', 'so', 'quickly', 'really', 'only', 'get', 'glimpses', 'children', 'impact', 'have', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'transcended', 'lighthearted', 'genre', 'pegged', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful.But', 'get', 'feeling', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'front', 'succeeded.In', 'end', 'totally', 'recommend', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'fan', 'DeNiro', 'years', 'longing', 'see', 'do', 'something', 'worthy', 'name', 'once', 'again', 'DeNiro', 'what', 'Schmidt', 'was', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'only', 'Schmidt', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'film']",N/A
1291632,A1EVD37ULFNOKU,B002VECLZK,"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector""","[2, 3]","I am going to try not to go into plot, but just why I liked and didn't like the movie.So I watched this movie the first time thinking that it was a comedy because of the trailer. This movie is hardly a comedy first of all, but you knew that from the other reviews already. I thought it was just ok, partly because I was expecting to laugh not grab tissues.I recently watched this movie again, via cable, and I gave it a second chance to see if I got something different from it the second time around, because this time I knew what to expect, drama not comedy.Watching it a second time, I remembered why I liked it. First off I loved Robert De Niro in this movie. I always forget that this is man that also portrayed the serial killer in Cape Fear. In Everybody's Fine he plays a father that was stern (not abusive, just expected only the best, and seemed to shun the mediocre) that was then broken down to a much more approachable father-figure after his wife passes and after having a heart problem, which is the where the movie starts. Robert was great so I move on...The kids, Kate Beckinsale (Amy) , Drew Barrymore (Rosie), Sam Rockwell (Robert), Austin Lysy (David). The actors played each role well, no problems with that. Based on the plot you know they wind up covering up their stories with an I am Fine Version, and a heightened lifestyle to make their father happy.The real problem I had with this movie is one scene. The table scene with all the kids is the best scene of the movie, but it does not come without a few questions. With that said, I feel like they could have done away with it and made something much more approachable to the viewer. Its placed in the movie time-wise correctly but as far as the filming of that scene there is some detachment from the rest of the movie, and yes I know it is supposed to because of the story, but it just doesn't visually fit in the movie. Production had this great scene and they just didn't want to part with it, and I could tell. It did not, however, effect my tear factor, but still, even the second time around I just couldn't get over how it did not fit in the movie. Don't get me wrong, it is not the content of that scene, it is just the way the scene is played out, the content is what ties up everything else, but there is something about it I just really question. But anyways, I can't think of a better scene to fill with it, so I move on... (it does make me want to read the book, if there is one.)My second favorite scene is the hospital night scene. Without spoiling the movie I will just say that this made more tears flow.The movie gets 4 stars, because to me, it wasn't amazing, but it was really well done. In general I would recommend the movie because I did enjoy it, and the actors portrayed the family genuinely.",4,Everybody's Mediocre,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,2795,"['am', 'going', 'try', 'not', 'go', 'plot', 'just', 'why', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie.So', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'thinking', 'was', 'comedy', 'trailer', 'movie', 'hardly', 'comedy', 'first', 'knew', 'other', 'reviews', 'already', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'partly', 'was', 'expecting', 'not', 'grab', 'tissues.I', 'recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'cable', 'gave', 'second', 'chance', 'see', 'got', 'something', 'different', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'time', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'drama', 'not', 'comedy.Watching', 'second', 'time', 'remembered', 'why', 'liked', 'First', 'loved', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'movie', 'always', 'forget', 'man', 'also', 'portrayed', 'serial', 'killer', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'father', 'was', 'stern', 'not', 'abusive', 'just', 'expected', 'only', 'best', 'seemed', 'shun', 'mediocre', 'was', 'then', 'broken', 'down', 'much', 'more', 'approachable', 'father-figure', 'wife', 'passes', 'having', 'heart', 'problem', 'where', 'movie', 'Robert', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'move', 'kids', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Amy', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Rosie', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Robert', 'Austin', 'Lysy', 'David', 'actors', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'problems', 'Based', 'plot', 'know', 'wind', 'up', 'covering', 'up', 'stories', 'am', 'Fine', 'Version', 'heightened', 'lifestyle', 'make', 'father', 'happy.The', 'real', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'table', 'scene', 'kids', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'not', 'come', 'few', 'questions', 'said', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'away', 'made', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'approachable', 'viewer', 'placed', 'movie', 'time-wise', 'correctly', 'as', 'far', 'filming', 'scene', 'detachment', 'rest', 'movie', 'yes', 'know', 'supposed', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'visually', 'fit', 'movie', 'Production', 'had', 'great', 'scene', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'part', 'could', 'tell', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'effect', 'tear', 'factor', 'still', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'content', 'scene', 'just', 'way', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'content', 'what', 'up', 'everything', 'else', 'something', 'just', 'really', 'question', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'scene', 'fill', 'so', 'move', 'make', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'one', 'second', 'favorite', 'scene', 'hospital', 'night', 'scene', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'made', 'more', 'tears', 'flow.The', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'general', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'did', 'enjoy', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'family', 'genuinely']",N/A

1291635,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002VECLZK,B. E Jackson,"[4, 4]","I want to make something clear before writing this review- Everybody's Fine is most certainly NOT a comedy.  It's in fact, quite the opposite.  The description might lead you to think otherwise, but it's actually a really emotional drama story.Normally I'm not a fan of Robert De Niro, however whenever he stars (or plays lead role) in a family-oriented film, I'm always very interested in them.I suggest if you're someone who either worries or constantly thinks about your family -and specifically someone who's always concerned too much time has passed they by and there's no way to go back in time and change things- you should NOT watch this movie because you will most likely be in tears by the time it's over.  The last 20 minutes are especially hard to keep from crying.  This film might be even harder for older folks to watch, seriously.The storyline is about an old man (played by Robert De Niro) who one day decides to search for his children and find out about their lives, and what they've been up to over the years.  So Robert's character travels across the country and makes unexpected visits to each of his children, and along the way finds out some really shocking things about them.  Let's just say- his kids have definitely changed over the years.It's one of those films where you really have to pay close attention to all the details in order to notice all the surprising things about his kids, because there's a scene later involving a thunderstorm that might be confusing to understand if you don't pay extremely close attention early on.Without spoiling anything, the one thing that was never really made clear were the ""in between"" segments whenever Robert De Niro would travel to visit his kids.  You see, there would be these conversations taking place between each of his kids over a telephone.  What was confusing about this is that it was never really clear whether Robert De Niro was actually hearing these conversations, or not.It's a clever bit of storytelling because it leaves you guessing.  I *assume* he wasn't really hearing his children talking to each other over the telephone, and it could be a case where Robert's character just *knew* anyway because he's an experienced father, and his fatherly instincts kicked in, but I can't be completely sure.Also, the song that plays over the credits sounds like Paul McCartney, and it's a REALLY good song.  I'm not sure if it's really Paul McCartney singing that song or just a singer who happens to resemble his voice.Anyway, Everybody's Fine is a magnificent film because it does everything correctly.  It makes you cry, it keeps your attention, and it's definitely a film worth watching.Update- August 2, 2011- I'm not really sure what exactly I was thinking when I thought Robert De Niro's character was able to hear the telephone conversations taking place through the communication wires- no, I don't believe he was.",5,quite sad,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2905,"['want', 'make', 'something', 'clear', 'writing', 'review-', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'most', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'fact', 'quite', 'opposite', 'description', 'might', 'lead', 'think', 'otherwise', 'actually', 'really', 'emotional', 'drama', 'story.Normally', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'however', 'whenever', 'lead', 'role', 'family-oriented', 'film', ""'m"", 'always', 'very', 'interested', 'them.I', 'suggest', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'worries', 'constantly', 'family', '-and', 'specifically', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'concerned', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'way', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'change', 'things-', 'should', 'NOT', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'tears', 'time', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'especially', 'hard', 'keep', 'crying', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'older', 'folks', 'watch', 'seriously.The', 'storyline', 'old', 'man', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'search', 'children', 'find', 'out', 'lives', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'up', 'years', 'Robert', 'character', 'travels', 'country', 'unexpected', 'visits', 'children', 'way', 'out', 'really', 'shocking', 'things', 'Let', 'just', 'say-', 'kids', 'have', 'definitely', 'changed', 'years.It', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'details', 'order', 'notice', 'surprising', 'things', 'kids', 'scene', 'later', 'involving', 'thunderstorm', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'extremely', 'close', 'attention', 'early', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'were', 'segments', 'whenever', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'would', 'travel', 'visit', 'kids', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'conversations', 'taking', 'place', 'kids', 'telephone', 'What', 'was', 'confusing', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'actually', 'hearing', 'conversations', 'not.It', 'clever', 'bit', 'storytelling', 'guessing', '*assume*', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'hearing', 'children', 'talking', 'other', 'telephone', 'could', 'be', 'case', 'where', 'Robert', 'character', 'just', '*knew*', 'anyway', 'experienced', 'father', 'fatherly', 'instincts', 'kicked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'sure.Also', 'song', 'credits', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'REALLY', 'good', 'song', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'singing', 'song', 'just', 'singer', 'who', 'resemble', 'voice.Anyway', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'magnificent', 'film', 'everything', 'correctly', 'cry', 'attention', 'definitely', 'film', 'watching.Update-', 'August', '2', '2011-', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'thought', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'was', 'able', 'hear', 'telephone', 'conversations', 'taking', 'place', 'communication', 'wires-', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was']",N/A

It's kind of a weird feeling seeing him portray a calm, ordinary guy, which is precisely what he does in the charming and captivating ""Everybody's Fine.""De Niro plays Frank Goode, a single, hard-working parent, who lives by himself in a house once inhabited by his four, now grown-up children and his late wife. His biggest joy in life, it seems, is to have his sons and daughters for Christmas, ""all around the same table."" For this purpose, he buys the best steaks, wines, etc., so that he can impress his family and enjoy the holidays. However, for this particular Christmas, his children can't make it for this special celebration. So Frank decides to go to them instead, traveling by bus, airplane and by train, in order that he can surprise and spend time with  David (Austin Lysy) in New York, Amy (Kate Beckinsale) in Chicago, Robert (Sam Rockwell) in Denver, and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) in Las Vegas. In doing so, Frank is the one surprised, finding secrets after secrets about his adult children, which makes him question himself, about his role in their lives.""Everybody's Fine"" is about what we expect from our children once there are adults, and how we measure their success. It is touching and honest, and in the end, like Frank, we can conclude that ""the family is making its way in the world, and you could be proud of the children and their achievements.""

Imagine spending several days with him and discovering why he is so sad and all alone and you will be close to the feeling you're left with after seeing Everybody's Fine.Previously to Everybody's Fine, I don't think any other film ever tore so much emotion out of me in such a subtle manner.It's slow and not a lot happens in a big, shiny cinematic way; but it's very entertaining nonetheless. Despite its huge A-list cast, it couldn't have felt further from a big Hollywood film. It's beautifully realistic and tragic and sincere all in one. Don't let the misleading trailer confuse you; this is not a comedy as it foolishly tries to make it seem. It has a few minor comedic moments (see the trailer) but the film is heavily a drama.Robert De Niro plays Frank Goode and it's no mistake that his last name is Goode. He's the sweetest guy you could imagine.Unfortunately, his wife has recently passed away. To make matters worse, only months after her funeral, not one, not two, not three, but all four of his adult children regret to inform him that they will not be able to make it to see him for the weekend they had planned.Frank is crushed. He had already gone out and picked up a nice bottle of wine and even purchased a brand new barbeque with plans of cooking for them. Now he will spend the weekend alone. And of course he also learns that his health isn't exactly hunky-dory.Frank decides that rather than sit around and stew about how bad things are, he will pack a bag and set out on a road trip to surprise each and every one of his kids, instead. Did I mention they are all `conveniently' scattered across the entire United States?Frank's doctor advised him not to travel as it would be unwise to his health, so he avoids flying or driving and begins his trip with a peaceful train ride.It is along this journey that we learn Frank is a lonely guy who just wants someone to share a warm conversation with. He chats with strangers he meets here and there and we can't help but wish we were among them, so that we could spend a few precious moments of our time with him.One of his two sons lives in New York. He arrives there first, only to discover he isn't home. (Frank never heard from this son; one of the others canceled for him) and we find that he may be up to something. Frank sketches a note (that will bring a tear to your eye) on the front of a prepared envelope and drops it under his door.We learn Frank has an envelope for each of his kids and of its contents late in the third act. I won't spoil it for you, but you may want to have a tissue handy. Don't worry; it's not predictable or cheesy.Next he goes to see one of his two daughters, Amy (Kate Beckinsale). She is very surprised to see him. Frank begins to uncover her excuse to not make the visit.We don't hate her, or any of his other kids for making excuses to not see him, but we become very disappointed by their heartless actions. They clearly love their father and seem to have a pretty good relationship with him, so why the selfish behavior? Everybody's Fine leaves no questions un-answered, but I don't want to reveal too much.His other two children are played by Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell. Rockwell shows us a side of himself that we have never seen before, as Robert. We get a lot out of him in his few short scenes. I still think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination in The Green Mile, but if he keeps acting like this, he'll have at least one in no time.Barrymore plays Rosie and has perhaps the strongest connection with her father. Because of this bond they share, Frank can sense she isn't telling him something. At this point he is frustrated because he realizes he's drifting apart from all four of them and it's devastating.The filmmakers give us a vividly entertaining and original scene of exposition; by which we learn a great deal more about these characters. This idea was very unique and well put together and really ties the story together quite nicely. All of the acting in this scene is brilliant.The acting in this film is heartfelt and good and never over the top. De Niro delivers one of his best performances in years; touching your soul with his interpretation of Frank Goode. You really feel for Frank in this picture and you adore the time you have spent with him.One of my favorite scenes takes place in a subway tunnel between Frank and a man asking for change. Frank is down on his luck and lends a helping hand to this young man, without hesitation. The acting is dead-on and the scene slaps you in the face and visually looks like gold. You will know the one I mean.Come to think of it, there are several moments that were shot with equal precision and artistic vision. This film reminded me a lot of About Schmidt, for various obvious reasons. Writer and director Kirk Jones has created a beautiful film and I look forward to more of his work in the future.At one point I thought the film was seconds from being over and I was in tears at how wonderful it had all come together. Then De Niro takes your breath away yet again, during the actual resolution.Frank's narration at the end and the final shot could not have been perfected any better. This film is far more than just fine and everybody in it that we care about is too.",5,Everybody's Fine Review,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,5672,"['EVERYBODY', 'FINESTARRING', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro',

1291644,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B002VECLZK,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","During this festive season when so much of our energies focus on the family ""Everybody's Fine"" is mandatory viewing.  The film's time trajectory is over a period of weeks and months and only culminates with a Christmas feast.  There is so much said about dysfunctional or disconnected families but there are no alike families in the world.  Each family has it's own unique dynamic and the Goodes as portrayed here are no exception.  Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) recently retired and widowed is looking to gather his four adult children at his home.  Each concoct an excuse not to come.  Since the kids won't come to Frank he'll go to them even though they live on all corners of the U.S.A.  There is an apparent disconnect between Frank and the kids even though by all accounts he was a hard-working and loving provider for his wife and kids.  It just seems that Frank's traditional role was as bread-winner and his wife provided the psychic nurturing.

1291646,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002VECLZK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","In 2009, British director Kirk Jones (""Everybody's Fine"", ""Nanny McPhee"", ""Waking Ned"") wrote and directed a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's award-winning 1990 film ""Stanno Tutti Bene"". The film features cinematography by Henry Braham (""The Golden Compass"", ""Nanny McPhee"", ""Crush"") and music composed by Dario Marianelli (""The Soloist"", ""Atonement"", ""The Brave One"").Where the original film had an operatic tie-in, Jones' film ""Everybody's Fine"" focuses more on a heartwarming family tale about family secrets and moving on after tragedy.The film revolves around Frank Goode (played by Robert De Niro, ""The Godfather"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Raging Bull""), the father of four who has kept himself busy taking care of the home after the death of his wife.  His routine is taking care of the garden and taking his heart medication but with the annual family reunion coming up, Frank wants to continue the tradition of what his wife had done for years.But when he calls his children, the majority of them are unable to come this year and tell him that they are all busy.  So, Frank decides that why not take a road trip and visit each of them and see how they are doing. For Frank, he has been busy all his life working (working on the tubing that are on the telephone wires across America) and thus, his wife took care of the family and he never developed a strong relationship with them.  But hopes he can do it now.While Frank goes to visit his oldest daughter Amy (played by Kate Beckinsale, ""Serendipity"", ""Underworld"" films"", ""Pearl Harbor""), his son Robert (played by Sam Rockwell, ""Moon"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") and his daughter Rosie (played by Drew Barrymore, ""E.T."", ""Charlie's Angels"" films"", ""Donnie Darko""), all he hopes for his children is happiness.But somehow during his visit, he realizes that things may not have been going so well and that they have not been truthful with him about their lives.  Also, he is unable to get in touch with his older son David and only the sibling know the reason why.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Everybody's Fine"" is presented in Widescreen (2:40:1).  The cinematography by Henry Braham is beautiful.  From capturing the beautiful scenery to capturing the emotions of the top notch cast.  The film through its cinematography captures family's at their best and their worst.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Also, included is a French Language track.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and is front and center channel driven.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Everbody's Fine"" comes with the following special features:* The Making of Paul McCartney's ""(I Want To) Come Home"" - (9:47) The making of ""(I Want To) Come Home"" and interview with Paul McCartney and how he became part of the film.* Deleted & Extended Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes: Book of Directions, An Artist (Extended Scene), Every Day Is a Storm (Extended Scene), Red River Valley, You Like Hot Dogs?, Airport, I'm Sorry (Extended Scene).JUDGMENT CALL:A heartwarming and tragic tale about a man who gets to know his family and realizes he didn't know much about them as he thought.Robert De Niro absolutely shines in this role, that begs of him to not be a tough man but a father who is realizing his loss but also how his wife kept his family strong but also not sharing with him the difficulties about their children and now he is learning first hand for himself how the little children that he once remembers are now adults and each are not living this perfect life as he had hoped.""Everybody's Fine"" features an all-star cast with Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell but where the original film focused on the family life and as mentioned operatic in that the Italian film featured children named after opera characters and the children's lives being close to those characters, ""Everybody's Fine"" is focused more on the father.  The siblings project this facade of a happy life but Frank (De Niro) is not dumb, he knows something is wrong and it all culminates up to the point where he finds out the truth of his son David, the son that he put the most pressure on when he was younger.But most of all, realizing that his dead wife wanted to maintain order and out of love, she made Frank feel that everybody's fine (thus the title of the film).""Everybody's Fine"" is probably the most vulnerable we have ever seen of De Niro and just shows you the depth of his talent as an actor.  Although the film had a limited three week run before the Christmas holiday, I enjoyed this film a lot.Having grown up watching films about parents and their children through director Yasujiro Ozu who showed the pain and happiness of parenthood and the bond between the parents and their children, ""Everybody's Fine"" is a sentimental film that touched my heart because I know many parents in which one significant other would tell the other who is the breadwinner that life is good but behind those words lies a facade and sure enough, things are not always that good as it may seem.  Although, we are given a limited time to see Frank's interaction with his children, it's that journey and realization and discovery that touches you.  De Niro brings Frank Goode to life.Overall, ""Everbody's Fine"" features a strong, magnificent performance from De Niro unlike anything he has done before.  The film is sentimental, heartwarming and tragic but in the end, is a film that I adored.Definitely recommended!",4,Featuring an all-star cast and a top-notch performance by Robert De

Sorel ""book lovah""","[5, 5]","Everybody's Fine starring Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell, and Kate Beckinsale is about a family struggling to stay together after their mother dies and their father is left alone. Robert De Niro plays the patriarch of the family who was a typical 1960s father who focused on his career in order to make money for the family of six. His wife held the connection to their four children and the family's confidante. However, when she dies, De Niro is lost and tries to rekindle his relationship with his children. When he plans a family gathering, all of the children find a way to get out of the reunion. De Niro is distraught that his family is no longer connected as they once were and he decides to take to the road to visit each of his children. His first stop is to his son David who is an artist living in New York City. When David does not answer his father's calls, De Niro decides to move on to his daughter's house where he finds that nothing is as it seems and certainly not as hunky-dory as he had been told. He faces the same situation with his following two children before he returns home even more lost than when he left. Each child blows off their father to the point that he believes they may never be a strong family again. Yet, when tragedy strikes, his children come together to support each other and himself.This film was touching in all of the ways a good movie should be. It never received any hype when it was in theaters and moved quickly to DVD. I think that this is terrible because I found a great deal more in the film than I found in many of the other movies that came out in 2009. De Niro is fantastic in the role as the lost father helplessly trying to bring his family together. His children's disinterest in him is honest and heartbreaking. It made me want to call my dad and thank him for being a fantastic father. Though the story was heart aching at times, it was truthful and documented a real period in people's lives when children become parents and distance themselves from their own parents for a variety of reasons. Overall, the film is sad and touching with little bits of humor.

1291655,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002VECLZK,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious, sentimental treatment by writer/director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film,Stanno tutti bene, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, no stranger to sentiment since he made the neo-classic ""Cinema Paradiso"". The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode, a former blue-collar worker living in upstate New York, doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic, Yasujiro Ozu'sTokyo Story, which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes too-perfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays, he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David, an artist living a boho-type lifestyle in Manhattan, but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy, a successful, Type-A Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert, a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor, and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie, a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say, things are not what they appear, and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor, De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately, that happens in the film's worst scene, a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults (a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen'sAnnie Hallbut without the laughs). Otherwise, De Niro makes his character a befuddling, somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likeability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite, a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo (Frozen River) shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires. The 2010 DVD release is weak as these types of releases go with the only extras being seven deleted/extended scenes (interesting but excisable) and an interview with Paul McCartney, who wrote and performed the appropriately sentimental song, ""I Want to (Come Home)"", played over the closing credits.",3,"An Estranged Father Take a Lugubrious, Sentimental Cross-Country Journey",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,4043,"['Family', 'dysfunction', 'given', 'lugubrious', 'sentimental', 'treatment', 'writer/director', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'what', 'actually', 'remake', '1990', 'Italian', 'film', 'Stanno', 'bene', 'written', 'directed', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'no', 'stranger', 'sentiment', 'made', 'neo-classic', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'earlier', 'film', 'starred', 'legendary', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'Sicilian', 'civil', 'servant', 'who', 'Italy', 'pay', 'surprise', 'visits', 'children', 'wife', 'died', 'mirror', 'version', 'equally', 'legendary', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Frank', 'Goode', 'former', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'living', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'grown', 'children', 'first', 'part', 'plot', 'even', 'earlier', 'classic', 'Yasujiro', ""Ozu'sTokyo"", 'Story', 'told', 'story', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'visit', 'grown', 'children', 'Tokyo', 'only', 'discover', 'have', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'subtle', 'classic', 'did', ""n't"", 'telegraph', 'emotional', 'impact', 'contrived', 'plot', 'turns.The', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'turgid', '2009', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'unbearable', 'stamp', 'manipulation', 'Jones', 'overly', 'deliberate', 'treatment', 'sometimes', 'too-perfectly', 'composed', 'shot', 'compositions', 'courtesy', 'Henry', 'Braham', 'immaculate', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'Frank', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'unfulfilling', 'widowed', 'existence', 'being', 'rebuffed', 'four', 'children', 'come', 'home', 'holidays', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'visit', 'one', 'serious', 'heart', 'ailment', 'realize', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'emotional', 'conduit', 'kept', 'family', 'touch', 'divergent', 'paths', 'took', 'Frank', 'out', 'train', 'bus', 'surprise', 'locales', 'first', 'David', 'artist', 'living', 'boho-type', 'lifestyle', 'Manhattan', ""n't"", 'home', 'reasons', 'will', 'become', 'clear', 'later', 'story', 'Then', 'see', 'Amy', 'successful', 'Type-A', 'Chicago', 'advertising', 'executive', 'living', 'life', 'pages', 'Architectural', 'Digest.Frank', 'Denver', 'meet', 'son', 'Robert', 'symphony', 'percussionist', 'whom', 'Frank', 'thought', 'was', 'conductor', 'finally', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'Rosie', 'dancer', 'living', 'luxurious', 'apartment', 'Needless', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'appear', 'Frank', 'aware', 'how', 'estranged', 'truly', 'become', 'children', 'revelations', 'start', 'unfold', 'clockwork', 'actor', 'De', 'Niro', 'have', 'settled', 'relatively', 'passive', 'figure', 'only', 'evoking', 'heat', 'past', 'performances', 'key', 'moments', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'worst', 'scene', 'hallucinogenic', 'fantasy', 'scene', 'where', 'Frank', 'talking', 'memory', 'children', 'toddlers', 'only', 'have', 'talk', 'back', 'adults', 'bit', 'classroom', 'scene', 'Woody', ""Allen'sAnnie"", 'Hallbut', 'laughs', 'Otherwise', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'befuddling', 'somewhat', 'endearing', 'presence', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Amy', 'efficiently', 'not', 'too', 'deeply', 'ad', 'pitch', 'sequence', 'one', 'unexpectedly', 'funny', 'bit', 'whole', 'film.Sam', 'Rockwell', 'better', 'son', 'sense', 'disappointment', 'palpable', 'father', 'son', 'scenes', 'De', 'Niro', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'natural', 'warmth', 'likeability', 'play', 'Rosie', 'Frank', 'obvious', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'let', 'father', 'down', 'always', 'watchable', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Frozen', 'River', 'up', 'convenient', 'touching', 'cameo', 'sympathetic', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'bonds', 'Frank', 'recent', 'spouse', 'losses', 'whole', 'plot', 'executes', 'series', 'conveniences', 'such', 'blatant', 'connection', 'Frank', 'former', 'job', 'covering', 'PVC', 'cables', 'overlapping', 'voiceovers', 'siblings', 'moving', 'images', 'telephone', 'wires', '2010', 'DVD', 'release', 'weak', 'types', 'releases', 'go', 'only', 'extras', 'being', 'seven', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'excisable', 'interview', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'who', 'wrote', 'performed', 'appropriately', 'sentimental', 'song', 'Want', 'Come', 'Home', 'played', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A
1291656,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002VECLZK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","EVERYBODY'S FINE (2009) struck me as an awfully common and coarse title. That's just me. We found it enjoyable, though my wife said it was a shame how old Robert DeNiro looked. I had to remind her that it is called ""acting"" and that DeNiro looks damned good in real life. (She thought he looked 75.) The title of this review, by the way, is my wife's spot-on impression of DeNiro, who she thinks plays too many ""New York wise-ass"" roles.DeNiro is Frank Goode, widowed eight months and struggling to cope with his lonesome life. He frets over his children, Rosie (Drew Barrymore), Amy (Kate Beckinsale), Robert (Sam Rockwell) and the unseen David (Austin Lysy). Frank is proud of his kids: one is a dancer, one is an orchestra conductor, one is big in advertizing, and one is a great artist.Frank finds all is not gold that glitters, when he invites the kids home and one by one, they back out...and he has spent a fortune on a new grill, wine, steaks, everything. He misses his kids, who are scattered like the wind...and have things to hide. Frank, struggling with pulmonary fibrosis from breathing PVC all his life, is perceived as fragile yet unapproving by his kids. They feel they cannot talk to him as they did with their mother.Frank decides to go to each of them and surprise them with a short visit, bearing somewhat worrisome-looking envelopes addressed to each one. You will not really guess at the animadventures Frank has during his train-bus-plane trips, and I will not spoil this excellent film for you. The acting is top-notch, DeNiro handles this role of a quiet, aging widower with the usual brilliance, but I was disappointed at how little screen time the others enjoyed. And that is the purpose...not to show us they can't share a scene with DeNiro, but to show kids who cannot share the same room with their father.Yet I would have liked to see a lot more of them and their travails. Each one amounts to barely a sketch of a character.This is a remake of a 1990 Italian film, STAMOS TUTTI BENE (""WE'RE ALL WELL"", which I would have liked better as a title for this version). I suppose as a matter of interest I will add this was filmed entirely in Connecticut which I found delightful for some reason.EVERYBODY'S FINE seems well executed enough but one thing I could not understand: why make it at all? The lessons were clear, but in a way this was like a boring lecture from an unpopular relative. It should have been just a tad more dramatic and cinematic--in a way, it reminded me a lot of SINCE OTAR LEFT and the star of that film, old Esther Gorintin, gave DeNiro a run for his money.

1291659,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002VECLZK,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","EVERYBODY'S FINE is, of course a misnomer: it is that too often used phrase to cover up or at least distract the questioner from the realities that are painful.  This fine little jewel of a film is a remake of the Italian 1900 STANNO TUTTO BENE written by Massimo De Rita, Tonino Guerra an Giuseppe Tornatorre.  Here that story about a Sicilian  father trying to reconnect with his children has been adapted successfully by Kirk Jones who also directs. Some may say the adaptation is less than the original, but for audiences in this country it is a more relevant story, and with the cast of characters selected to transform the tale into an American one it is successful.Frank Goode (Robert De Niro in a compelling performance) is a recent widower, caring for his house in Elmira, NY without very much connection to his four children who have gone into the world 'to become famous' (in Frank's mind).  Frank decides to spiff up his home and invite the children now living in all parts of the country to his home for a reunion.  None can come, with excuses that indicate that life outside Frank's world is more important and constraining.  Much against his physician's orders (Frank spent his life making PVC insulation for telephone wires and has work related pulmonary complications) Frank sets out to surprise each of his children with a visit.  He visits Amy (Kate Beckinsale), an advertising executive creating corny ads for unimportant customers; Robert (Sam Rockwell) who just plays percussion in the symphony rather than being the expected conductor; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) who instead of becoming a famous dancer has a gig in a Las Vegas show; David who was supposed to become a famous artist is simply not at home.  Frank realizes that he never really connected with his children except through his wife's presence, and while the children love their father, they feel they could never live up to his expectations....and haven't.  The painful truth comes when the 'family' discusses the fourth child David's status. The truths that are overwhelmingly obvious are that even in families we keep secrets that are really wounds that need tending.Throughout the film Frank takes photos with a 'film camera' - an indication of how out of touch Frank has become - of each child as well as signs that suggest they are more than they are.  His moments on his various rides across the country to meet the kids reveal that  it is even difficult to successfully relate to those fellow travelers on the various buses and trains.  Robert De Niro offers an understated performance that is Oscar worthy, creating a character who will live in memory for years to come.

1291660,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B002VECLZK,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[18, 19]","Everybody's Fine is a ""people"" movie, a study of characters -- both central and peripheral. It's a drama with some comedic elements, heavy on emotion but low on over-the-top histrionics. And depending on where it might hit you in your own life, it can be a real tearjerker, in that good way that makes you think about the important things and discuss them with the important people in your life.Robert DeNiro gives an understated performance as a father who would not or could not realize he was expressing lifelong disappointment with his children if they were less than ""the best."" They had spent years hiding any flaws from him and sharing their struggles only with their mother, who had passed several months earlier.Their stories come together as he travels the country to reconnect. Along the way, British director Kirk Wise (Waking Ned, Nanny McPhee) presents snapshots of interesting characters and fascinating faces, both genial and malevolent.The part that touched my wife and me most was the technique using children to speak for their grownup counterparts in key sections of the film. DeNiro's character still sees them as school age kids and, through his reveries, so do we. It's not a new technique but it seems to work effectively here and often hits hard in ways that standard confrontational scenes could not. Since our kids are school age and we have parents we want to please too, it made my wife and I think about our own parent/child relationships.One of the messages of the movie seems to be that it's not too late to pick up the pieces, but you can suffer great losses if you get too distracted and wait too long -- and we all need to take a breath and be more accepting of one another's choices. It's not so much that we should ""settle"" but rather that there are better ways to measure true success.My only criticism of the DVD is that there is NO AUDIO COMMENTARY. There are a few extended scenes and a short look at Paul McCartney's involvement in creating a song for the film. A commentary was sorely missed.",5,I'm a little verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves.

1291661,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B002VECLZK,Gryphonisle,"[0, 1]","I'm dismayed to realize that this film was written by the same folks that gave us ""Waking Ned Devine"", which was a warm and funny film, and a fun story.  This movie is like ""About Schmidt"" the Lite Version.  Like Jack Nicholson's character, DeNiro's Mr. Goode is recently widowed (although the wife passes before the movie starts);  she's the one who kept in touch with the kids.  So, alienated widower dad goes on a road trip to visit each of his kids, with an envelope for each;  and nobody knows he's coming.  Surprise!Well, Surprise on him actually because one of his sons is in trouble, but no one wants to tell Dad.  And, Dad's afraid of flying so he starts out on a train bound for NYC, and there we learn that he made the PFC covering for the wires that run along the track, the road, and all over America.  At that point the viewer begins to suspect this movie was conceived on a commuter train as the writer, or someone, watched the gently swooping visual rythym of the wires running alongside the tracks.  Then, as much of the plot is advanced, and the audience brought up to speed with what was set in motion before we got in front of the TV, by way of telephone conversations we (the audience) overhear while the camera focuses in on the overhead wires, we began to think that this whole plane phobia is also a plot device.So, Dad shows up and nobody can spend any time with him, because they've all got plans to go out of town, including one of his daughters, who is headed to Mexico to find their brother.  But no one tells Dad.  Dad, meanwhile gets his heart meds crushed, which one immediately suspects is also just another plot device, and sure enough, he ends up in the hospital after refusing the sensible idea of going to a pharmacy and getting another Rx.  Now he has a dream of his aged, widowed self, at a picnic table in his back yard, with his kids, as kids, but explaining why they never tell him the truth about anything, and the audience is finally as much in the know as pretty much anybody else.So, Dad goes home.  By plane.  Why not?  We don't need the wires anymore.  There's a bit more, but you'll want something fresh to nibble on if you watch this.My partner and I both come from similar families.  Mine won't talk about bad news, his simply says ""Everything's Fine"" even if someone just had a heart attack.  But even with that personal connection this film just doesn't work as anything more than fluff.  Again, I point to ""About Schmidt"" where a similar character, played by Jack Nicholson, in a similar situation, heads out in a motorhome he and his wife bought for vacations he never wanted to take; to see his daughter as she prepares to marry a truly flaky fiance;  but the mother in law is a hoot.  Along the way Jack nearly becomes a homewrecker, in a trailer park.  Things happen, people don't work out.  In this film a nice little romance is suggested and then abandoned.  He hits all the conventional spots along the road (except for Seattle) and...yawn...the movie ends with, well I can't tell you that.There are a lot of terrible movies out there.  Anything with Adam Sandler, for example.  So this isn't Bad, it just isn't very good either.  Like Kool Aid instead of nice fresh juice.  I'd put it off so you can see the stuff you've been putting off, and if you forget about it, well, so be it.  Or maybe watch it with Shirley MacLanes ""Carolina"", which is slightly better, Kool Aid with Seven Up.  They would make a nice shut-in afternoon, this winter during a storm, or this fall in a hurricane shelter.",2,Nice. Easy.

1291663,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B002VECLZK,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[14, 15]","What can I say about Robert DeNiro that we don't already know....In addition to playing some of the most iconic characters of the last 35 yrs in film,he is in the upper echelon of the greatest actors ever to do it!He has proven this fact even more in the last 15 yrs, where he has added to hisreportoire of serious & menacing tough guy roles, sharply comedic and deeply emotionalones as well in which he has proven to be quite effective.This movie ""Everybody's Fine"" is an emotional tour de force!Deniro plays an aging father who is recently widowed and counting his own last days asan undisclosed disease slowly ravages his body. He finds himself lonely and trying to keepup the good front as he struggles from day to day just with the mundane tasks of life.His only solace comes in the memories he has of his children, all grown now and living theirown lives in different cities across the country.When he invites them all home for a cookout/family reunion, he is disappointedwhen they all find reasons to cancel one by one because their busy schedules.What DeNiro's character finds is that in his zeal to see his kids do well in life,he has in fact pushed them all so hard that they feel alienated from him.They all found it much more easier to communicate with their deceased mother,who, like a lot of mothers, handled the affairs of her children's lives as wellher own with seemingly effortless ease. She never shared any bad news with her husband(their father) regarding the struggles of their kids lives, inadvertently helpingto foster the very detached emotional environment he finds himself in with his kids.This he doesn't like, as he is now in a reflective state in his life and wantingand needing his children to be closer to him. So he sets about his own journeyto re-acquaint himself with each one of them, and without giving anymore away,it suffices to say that it's a journey filled with deep emotion and substancethat will have you shedding more than a few tears before it's all over.Not only is DeNiro subtle & brilliant in this, but he's supported by an excellent castof top shelf actors and actresses who collectively help to bring this film home big time!These are things that REAL PEOPLE face in EVERYDAY LIFE as we grow older, thingschange, we lose our loved ones, and the stresses of the day to day grind pull usfurther and further apart from the loved ones who are still alive.This story is filled with brilliant writing and direction as welland I warn you, you will be tearing up a few times before it ends!I rented this movie first to check it out, but I'll defintely be buying itvery soon because it's worth it. I highly recommend this film!

I could describe everything that happens in a single sentence...but I couldn't tell you why any of it would be considered entertaining, enlightening, moving, or meaningful.In fairness, I'll say that the first five minutes or so of the film were deceptively good, and DeNiro made me care about his character in that short amount of time. But once he hit the road to see his various children, the production went over a cliff. Characters turned into caricatures, and the few stylistic flourishes only served to show how mundane and unimaginative the other 95% of the film was.I'd love to know if this movie really turned out the way Kirk Jones wanted it to, or if the Hollywood system somehow corrupted a story and vision that was originally worth sharing.

1291669,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B002VECLZK,J. Michael,"[2, 9]","This movie can serve as an illustration of how Hollywood corruption works. Obviously, all Hollywood fare is not_pure_evil; the BKs who run Tinsletown wouldn't make enough money to come near slaking their insatiable avarice if they_only_put out movies like ""American Pie"" or the ""Saw"" franchise. Everyone knows that family movies (rated PG-13, PG and G) bring in the most money. However, these evil men who control the movie industry just can't resist inserting at least a smidgen of their  poisonous values into even the most innocent movies.  We've all noticed it: the sexual innuendo in the children's cartoon; the gratuitous nudity in the historical drama; the vulgar profanity in the kids' adventure; the glorification of immoral relationships, or at least their portrayal as something totally ok; the mockery of the traditional family, of parental authority, of religion; and just the basic inversion of decency and American Christian mores in almost every product Hollywood offers. The dream masters of Hollyweird just have to spit in our faces a little bit, even when serving us otherwise wholesome fare. I don't know about you, but just a little bit of poison in my meal spoils the whole dish.This is a movie about a recently widowed man whose far-flung children stand him up on a planned family get-together. The father sets out on a cross country trip to visit them and discovers that none of them are doing as well in their relationships or careers as they had claimed. The moral of the story, as we are later informed, was that the father pushed them too hard when they were kids, so now they lie to him to live up to his expectations. That in itself is a bit problematic as a moral, but... whatever. The aforementioned Hollywood corruption manifests itself in 1. the daughter's lesbian relationship, which the family ends up accepting as perfectly normal, and 2. by some pretty shocking blasphemies. I have known some pretty profane people, and I have never heard any of them say ""F***ing Christ"". I don't think Bobby DeNiro uttered such a phrase in ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"", but he says it here in this PG-13 family drama, playing a grandfather speaking to his grandson.

1291670,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B002VECLZK,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[1, 1]","""Everybody's Fine"" is a lonely, sad, isolating, realistic, touching, heartbreaking, gut wrenching movie that makes you think about life.  It is not the kind of movie that finds commercial success in most cases because very few people want to go to the movies and feel any of the above mentioned emotions.  Movies are about fantasy and make believe.  Feeling good about life and the guy/girl always ending up together in the end?  Life is not like that in reality.  Kids disappoint, parents make mistakes, tragedy befalls some of us and sometimes we just can't figure out how to make it through the day.Robert De Niro masterfully plays the recently widowed husband ""Frank Goode"" who in his retirement and finding himself alone reaches out to his four children.  All are set to meet him for the weekend and all four cancel at the last minute.  He busies himself in the garden and house but finds that he needs his family and strikes out on a cross country trip to visit all four.  With his ailing lungs he is unable to fly so by bus and train he begins his trip in New York City.  As a parent you find yourself looking into the eyes of your children and the line between pushing them to success and riding them into submissiveness is blurred.  How far is too far as you want only what is best for your kids.With each stop along the way it becomes evident that ""Frank"" has lost touch with his children.  With his wife gone so went the glue that bound them together and he struggles flailing about trying to reach for any of the four.  Yes he worked to hard and yes he didn't pay enough attention to the details but in his elderly state is it too late to grasp his children and guide them all back to family bonding?  His kids do not have time for him even after his long excursion to see them and in the end the lies mount up to high to find his way through.  He heads home broken hearted and saddened but the realization that his children not only disappointed him but more importantly he has vastly disappointed himself as a father.  ""Are you happy?""If Robert De Niro doesn't win some kind of award for his depiction of ""Frank"" I will find it a travesty.  While the move might struggle in the dollars and cents it was masterfully done if not a little slow at times bringing about the realistic family portrayal of life.  The laughs were few and far between and I left the theater feeling my stomach turning from the emotional rollercoaster ride but also left thinking about my life.  How many movies made today really bring a message that one can associate with every day reality?  Can you count them on two hands or maybe even one?""Everybody's Fine"" is a wonderful movie.

After his wife dies he cross-country drops in on his kids after they blow off a family get together. Each of their lives are in various degrees of turmoil but they all put on a glossy face to please their dad. A crisis brings out honesty and a chance for relationships to be reshaped.I especially like the telephone theme that played throughout the movie. And Frank's flashback/fantasy/dream sequences where he has grown-up conversation with his small children.I won't likely be adding it to my permanent library but it's worth a Netflix or Red Box Rental if you like slow films.

As his days fill up with trivia, he begins to think of his four grown children and how he has failed each of them.  He plans for them all to come visit, and watching him get everything ready for their visit, I felt a sadness.  Somehow, I knew he would be disappointed.And sure enough, each of the children calls in turn, giving excuses as to why they cannot come.So instead, Frank determines to surprise them by visiting them, one by one.  He starts out on his journey full of hope.His oldest son, David, is not home.  And things seem oddly out of sorts in Chicago, at his daughter Amy's house, too (Kate Beckinsale).  In Denver, Robert (Sam Rockwell) has excuses for why they cannot spend more time together, and in Las Vegas, Rosie (Drew Barrymore) seemingly has a perfect life--on the surface.All kinds of unexpected events occur on this trip, like a homeless person Frank tries to help suddenly turning on him, and in the process, Frank's medication is trampled.  Without his meds, he may not make it.  So he decides to return home.When a health crisis hospitalizes Frank, three of his children turn up at his bedside, and the truth begins to unfold.I expected this to be one of those predictably comedic films, with cute family moments, but I was quite pleased to find myself glued to the screen throughout, waiting and hoping for everyone to connect.In the final scenes, we see the adult children assembled in Frank's home, cooking Christmas dinner.  A nice resolution to some of the family issues.I awarded five stars toEverybody's Fine, as I was quite touched with how the film dealt with the disconnect between family members, and skillfully revealed how difficult it can be to reach out to one another.",5,MAKING AMENDS....,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,1790,"['Frank', 'Goode', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'aging', 'widower', 'feels', 'lost', 'wife', 'gone', 'days', 'fill', 'up', 'trivia', 'think', 'four', 'grown', 'children', 'how', 'failed', 'come', 'visit', 'watching', 'get', 'everything', 'ready', 'visit', 'felt', 'sadness', 'Somehow', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed.And', 'sure', 'enough', 'children', 'turn', 'giving', 'excuses', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'come.So', 'instead', 'Frank', 'surprise', 'visiting', 'one', 'one', 'out', 'journey', 'full', 'hope.His', 'oldest', 'son', 'David', 'not', 'home', 'things', 'seem', 'oddly', 'sorts', 'Chicago', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'house', 'too', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Denver', 'Robert', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'excuses', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Rosie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'life', 'surface.All', 'kinds', 'unexpected', 'events', 'occur', 'trip', 'homeless', 'person', 'Frank', 'help', 'suddenly', 'turning', 'process', 'Frank', 'medication', 'trampled', 'meds', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'return', 'health', 'crisis', 'Frank', 'three', 'children', 'turn', 'up', 'bedside', 'truth', 'unfold.I', 'expected', 'be', 'one', 'predictably', 'comedic', 'films', 'cute', 'family', 'moments', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'find', 'glued', 'screen', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'everyone', 'connect.In', 'final', 'scenes', 'see', 'adult', 'children', 'assembled', 'Frank', 'home', 'cooking', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'nice', 'resolution', 'family', 'issues.I', 'awarded', 'five', 'stars', 'toEverybody', 'Fine', 'was', 'quite', 'touched', 'how', 'film', 'dealt', 'disconnect', 'family', 'members', 'skillfully', 'revealed', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'reach', 'out', 'one']",N/A

De Niro appears as a widower who embarks on a cross-country trip to visit each of his four children after they all cancel their plans to visit him at his home in Elmira, New York. Against his physician's advise he sets out and each of the four stops is a disappointment as he slowly realizes, by their thinly veiled excuses, that something isn't ""right"". A perfectionistic father who coated electrical wiring for a living, he expected his children to reach the top of their chosen fields(an artist, an advertising executive, a musician / conductor, and a dancer). As the story unfolds it become apparent that the kids have gone to great lengths to present a facade of success and happiness. He comes to realize that the negative details of his children's lives have always been hidden from him...even by his now deceased wife. In a touching scene when he insists on the truth regarding one of his children, he responds with, ""No, No...tell me it's not true."" The bottom line: this family kept secrets and secrets benefit no one. This very thought-provoking film is a real tear-jerker, so be prepared.

Instead of stars, picture little icons of sporks, which I was forced to use to fling my own foeces at the screen.  As you see, however, this particular movie only comes in at three sporks, meaning it wasn't all that bad as flingers go.I liked this movie to a certain extent, in the simple-minded way you like movies when you're guzzling wine while watching them... but found it a bit heavy on the forced pathos.  Perhaps they could've pumped the pathos to the next level by having Robert DeNiro's character coughing up blood into a snow-white handkerchief while walking by a dead clown lying on the railroad tracks.  And then he discovers that his son the artist actually ran away to join the circus, got gang banged by a bunch of circus lions and went the way of Rod Stewart.  If you attended public school in the 1970s then you know what I'm talking about.  Those lions, he tried to resist but they were just so strong and... and yet after the attack, he still had the pluck to soldier on and get up on that stage and perform for his fans.  However, while belting out The First Cut is the Deepest, his ordeal proved too much for him and he collapsed, only to be rushed to a nearby emergency room and have seven pints of puma come pumped from his stomach.Anyway, getting back to this very sad yarn, the son who's a percussionist could've turned out to be an organ grinder's monkey.  He kind of looked like that when he was standing there pathetically banging that drum.  One thing that wasn't explained was why Drew Barrymore's character is both a lesbian AND has an illegitimate baby.  Boy, I guess she was going through a rough patch!

Fuchs ""&#34;The Meta-Reviewer&#34;""","[2, 15]","We watched this movie last night and I kept saying to my husband, this very manipulative movie constitutes a de facto argument for gay child-rearing. This De Niro character seems a ball of horrible parental cliches rolled into one. To such an extent that it seems unfair to straight dads. He is at once unconsciously nasty, disempowering, clueless and self-righteously proud of the misinformation that fills his head. Surely nobody has quite the bases covered in such a throughly even way. That evenness of blunderbuss emotional inappropriateness is what tells you that this movie was from the get-go conceived as a very manipulative affair. They were hoping to have a sort of parent-child Pavlovian effect on as many people as possible and make some dough out of very serious and tender issue. It is pretty disgusting. People who would make a thing like this are probably beyond shame. But for consumers it is worth noting that films as an ""art form"" have apparently made a significant negative progression. They always contained manipulation, but some fellow-feeling or sense of decency prevailed somehow. They tugged at heartstrings to bolster commonly accepted healthful emotions. Or  when they did horror it was horror, and calculated to fulfill other psychic needs of certain age groups. But here is a new low. It tries to spread the psychological complexity so throughly and recklessly that it will likely effect everyone, and then, amazingly tops it off with a cherry of even more blunderbuss misunderstanding. On this note the best scene is when the father character is in a dream sequence at a table with this kids as children, but they are all are spouting adult insights. Naturally, per the sledge-hammer manipulation of the director, the father character is treating them all like children. But the scene seems consciously modeled after Alice and Wonderland sitting at table with the Mad Hatter and other  characters. Except that whereas that famous scene offered artistic insight, this one is like a bull-in-a-china-shop's attempt at a weird  and unlikely table decorum. In other words, it is not the insight that comes from absurdist exaggeration, but the absurdity of pornography, emotional pornography. As if to confirm this very fact the movie ends with the most pornographically absurd moment of all. Having just learned recently that one of his kids died of over-dose, and that he was lied to by his kids who don't trust his maturity one bit, he is moved by all this into even more emotional prevarication. We knew he was not even remotely judging the facts of life accurately when he visited his musician son who is now the percussionist for a major symphony orchestra in Denver. In case anyone is not aware of the classical music world, which is sadly the apparent presumption of the makers of the film, being a percussionist in a major orchestra is a very big deal. And Denver, though not the Boston Symphony, would certainly count. But the father character who is intended to be more a spectral presence that anything emotional real, bizarrely chides the son for settling for ""playing the drums."" Well, this is just hilarious. And by the way I can well imagine virtuoso timpanists, on whom virtually every great symphony ever written rely, just shaking their heads in disbelief, and wanting to strike the gong in their percussion battery if like the gong-show it would get the father character to be pulled off the stage. But no, he has yet greater emotional misprisions to perform. But none as great as the final lines where he tells himself ""Everybody's Fine"". Though a significant percentage of his family fineness is inconvenienced by the fact of  being quite dead, he asserts his right as paterfamilias for delusion. It is such a ghoulish performance all the way around that it really does make you wonder if it is meant to set the mind wondering if there might, perchance, be an alternative to this hyperbolic emotional recklessness of a man like this. Might it be in gay people who are famously, allegedly, more in touch with their emotions. Who knows if this was even in the background. Probably they just wanted to make money. And they found a newly low way to do it.",1,"The Secret, Hidden Agenda of This Movie: An Default Argument for Gay Child-Rearing!",1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,4200,"['watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'kept', 'saying', 'husband', 'very', 'manipulative', 'movie', 'de', 'facto', 'argument', 'gay', 'child-rearing', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'ball', 'horrible', 'parental', 'cliches', 'rolled', 'one', 'extent', 'unfair', 'straight', 'dads', 'once', 'unconsciously', 'nasty', 'disempowering', 'clueless', 'self-righteously', 'proud', 'misinformation', 'head', 'Surely', 'nobody', 'quite', 'bases', 'covered', 'such', 'throughly', 'even', 'way', 'evenness', 'blunderbuss', 'emotional', 'inappropriateness', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'get-go', 'conceived', 'very', 'manipulative', 'affair', 'were', 'hoping', 'have', 'sort', 'parent-child', 'Pavlovian', 'effect', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'make', 'dough', 'very', 'serious', 'tender', 'issue', 'pretty', 'disgusting', 'People', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'thing', 'are', 'probably', 'shame', 'consumers', 'worth', 'noting', 'films', 'art', 'form', 'have', 'apparently', 'made', 'significant', 'negative', 'progression', 'always', 'contained', 'manipulation', 'fellow-feeling', 'sense', 'decency', 'prevailed', 'somehow', 'tugged', 'heartstrings', 'bolster', 'commonly', 'accepted', 'healthful', 'emotions', 'when', 'did', 'horror', 'was', 'horror', 'calculated', 'fulfill', 'other', 'psychic', 'needs', 'certain', 'age', 'groups', 'here', 'new', 'low', 'spread', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'so', 'throughly', 'recklessly', 'will', 'likely', 'effect', 'everyone', 'then', 'amazingly', 'off', 'cherry', 'even', 'more', 'blunderbuss', 'misunderstanding', 'note', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'father', 'character', 'dream', 'sequence', 'table', 'kids', 'children', 'are', 'are', 'spouting', 'adult', 'insights', 'Naturally', 'sledge-hammer', 'manipulation', 'director', 'father', 'character', 'treating', 'children', 'scene', 'consciously', 'modeled', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'sitting', 'table', 'Mad', 'Hatter', 'other', 'characters', 'whereas', 'famous', 'scene', 'offered', 'artistic', 'insight', 'one', 'bull-in-a-china-shop', 'attempt', 'weird', 'unlikely', 'table', 'decorum', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'insight', 'absurdist', 'exaggeration', 'absurdity', 'pornography', 'emotional', 'pornography', 'confirm', 'very', 'fact', 'movie', 'most', 'pornographically', 'absurd', 'moment', 'Having', 'just', 'learned', 'recently', 'one', 'kids', 'died', 'over-dose', 'was', 'lied', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'maturity', 'one', 'bit', 'moved', 'even', 'more', 'emotional', 'prevarication', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'judging', 'facts', 'life', 'accurately', 'when', 'visited', 'musician', 'son', 'who', 'now', 'percussionist', 'major', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'Denver', 'case', 'anyone', 'not', 'aware', 'classical', 'music', 'world', 'sadly', 'apparent', 'presumption', 'makers', 'film', 'being', 'percussionist', 'major', 'orchestra', 'very', 'big', 'deal', 'Denver', 'not', 'Boston', 'Symphony', 'would', 'certainly', 'count', 'father', 'character', 'who', 'intended', 'be', 'more', 'spectral', 'presence', 'anything', 'emotional', 'real', 'bizarrely', 'son', 'settling', 'playing', 'drums', 'Well', 'just', 'hilarious', 'way', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'virtuoso', 'timpanists', 'whom', 'virtually', 'great', 'symphony', 'ever', 'written', 'rely', 'just', 'shaking', 'heads', 'disbelief', 'wanting', 'strike', 'gong', 'percussion', 'battery', 'gong-show', 'would', 'get', 'father', 'character', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'stage', 'yet', 'greater', 'emotional', 'misprisions', 'perform', 'none', 'as', 'great', 'final', 'lines', 'where', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'significant', 'percentage', 'family', 'fineness', 'inconvenienced', 'fact', 'being', 'quite', 'dead', 'right', 'paterfamilias', 'delusion', 'such', 'ghoulish', 'performance', 'way', 'really', 'make', 'wonder', 'meant', 'set', 'mind', 'wondering', 'might', 'perchance', 'be', 'alternative', 'hyperbolic', 'emotional', 'recklessness', 'man', 'Might', 'be', 'gay', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'famously', 'allegedly', 'more', 'touch', 'emotions', 'Who', 'was', 'even', 'background', 'Probably', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'money', 'found', 'newly', 'low', 'way', 'do']",N/A

Zwick,"[2, 2]","With baby boomers moving ever closer to the age of retirement, an increasing number of mainstream American moviemakers have taken it upon themselves to deal with the issue (""The Savages"" being probably the most notable example).The most recent effort is Kirk Jones` ""Everybody's Fine,"" a touching family drama featuring Robert De Niro as a recently widowed retiree whose four adult children have spent their entire lives keeping secrets from him in an effort not to upset or disappoint him.  When the kids can't seem to make the time to come and see him, Frank Goode heads out on the road to pay each of them a surprise visit.  However, Frank doesn't always receive the welcome or the news he was hoping for when he arrives at each of his destinations.  One of his kids, Robert (Sam Rockwell), is a supposedly successful orchestra conductor who is actually just a drummer in the ensemble; another, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), is a high-paid executive whose successful marriage and happy family life are not all that they appear to be on the surface; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) is a dancer in Las Vegas who has a child with her lesbian lover; and, most disturbingly, David is an artist who's currently in jail in Mexico on drug-smuggling charges.  Frank is blissfully unaware of most of these details of his children`s lives, having been sheltered from the facts by both them and his late wife who felt it better not to let him in on the truth.Though it suffers a bit from its episodic structure and its tendency towards the lugubrious, ""Everybody's Fine,"" which is a remake of an Italian film from 1990, is a generally moving and understated look at parent/child relationships in the 21st Century.  With insightfulness and sensitivity, it explores the various and sundry aspects of the issue:  adult children who are too busy to make time for their aging parents; parents who place burdensome and unrealistic expectations on their children; parents and children struggling to find something to talk about after a lifetime of never really communicating in an open and honest manner.  And, throughout, the movie does a nice job of capturing the discomfiture and awkwardness of strained family relationships.De Niro effectively blanks himself into the role of a soft-spoken but gregarious man forced to confront some of the mistakes he's made in his life - and he is matched by a first-rate cast.  There are also some impressively mounted scenes, such as a bizarre but strikingly realistic encounter with a young man in a railway station and a hallucinatory dream sequence late in the film that crystallizes much of the movie's purpose and theme for the audience.",4,flawed but thoughtful family drama,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,2651,"['baby', 'boomers', 'moving', 'ever', 'closer', 'age', 'retirement', 'increasing', 'number', 'mainstream', 'American', 'moviemakers', 'have', 'taken', 'deal', 'issue', 'Savages', 'being', 'probably', 'most', 'notable', 'example', 'most', 'recent', 'effort', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'touching', 'family', 'drama', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'recently', 'widowed', 'retiree', 'four', 'adult', 'children', 'have', 'spent', 'entire', 'lives', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'effort', 'not', 'upset', 'disappoint', 'When', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'time', 'come', 'see', 'Frank', 'Goode', 'out', 'road', 'pay', 'surprise', 'visit', 'However', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'always', 'receive', 'welcome', 'news', 'was', 'hoping', 'when', 'destinations', 'One', 'kids', 'Robert', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'supposedly', 'successful', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'who', 'actually', 'just', 'drummer', 'ensemble', 'Amy', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'high-paid', 'executive', 'successful', 'marriage', 'happy', 'family', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'surface', 'Rosie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'dancer', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'who', 'child', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'David', 'artist', 'who', 'currently', 'jail', 'Mexico', 'drug-smuggling', 'charges', 'Frank', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'most', 'details', 'children', 's', 'lives', 'having', 'been', 'sheltered', 'facts', 'late', 'wife', 'who', 'felt', 'better', 'not', 'let', 'truth.Though', 'bit', 'episodic', 'structure', 'tendency', 'lugubrious', 'Everybody', 'Fine', 'remake', 'Italian', 'film', '1990', 'generally', 'moving', 'understated', 'look', 'parent/child', 'relationships', '21st', 'Century', 'insightfulness', 'sensitivity', 'various', 'sundry', 'aspects', 'issue', 'adult', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'make', 'time', 'aging', 'parents', 'parents', 'who', 'place', 'burdensome', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'children', 'parents', 'children', 'struggling', 'find', 'something', 'talk', 'lifetime', 'never', 'really', 'communicating', 'open', 'honest', 'manner', 'movie', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'discomfiture', 'awkwardness', 'strained', 'family', 'relationships.De', 'Niro', 'effectively', 'role', 'soft-spoken', 'gregarious', 'man', 'forced', 'confront', 'mistakes', 'made', 'life', 'matched', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'impressively', 'mounted', 'scenes', 'such', 'bizarre', 'strikingly', 'realistic', 'encounter', 'young', 'man', 'railway', 'station', 'hallucinatory', 'dream', 'sequence', 'late', 'film', 'much', 'movie', 'purpose', 'theme', 'audience']",N/A

And this film drives that agenda all the way home, pardon my alluding to the final scene.To make my point, I challenge anybody to find a ""chick flick"" i.e. romantic comedy released in the last 10 years or so that doesn't have some overt promotion or acceptance of homosexuality. I suspect you will come up with only about one in five. It is part of the LGBT public policy targeting.Well, Kirk Jones certainly has placed that in this story (although not a romantic comedy), particularly in the character of daughter Rosie played by Drew Barrymore. But more than that, just as this group of siblings constantly lies to father Frank (Robert DeNiro), Mr. Jones is misleading his audience about fatherhood and family values. Sadly, this too appears to be an Hollywood agenda. DeNiro's character is very clearly an average Joe, indeed an amazingly everyday average guy. He worked hard in a factory, then around the house, etc. and ""pushed"" his children to apply themselves so as to become successful adults. Instead, ALL of the kids are a mess, and father's pushing is to blame.Frankly, if all the fathers in America were as Frank Goode was in this film, we would be a far better place I am sure. Instead, we are like the dysfunctional family who has come home to gather around the table seeking acceptance for what they have become, and in that acceptance will they finally lay their blame of dad and his strict values to rest.In presenting his agenda film, Mr. Jones couches it all in what I must admit is an astonishingly well acted and directed work. There is not a wasted bit of footage here. DeNiro is incredible, as are all the actors including those who play the ""flashback"" kids.

1291696,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B002VECLZK,Scott FS,"[2, 2]","Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) has lost his wife; and, consequently, easy contact with his children and grandchildren.  He invites all four of his children to a weekend at his house.  None of them show up.  Each has an excuse, but the main reason is that they don't feel all that close to their father anymore.In spite of the fact that Goode has pulmonary fibrosis, he decides that if his children won't come to him, he'll go to them.  He decides to surprise them, which lasts about one visit, since the children do talk to each other quite a bit.  So he does a 'planes, trains and automobile' trip to visit each of his children.  The trip starts on a sour note when he discovers that his son David, isn't at his home in New York.The rest of the film is spent slowly teasing the family dynamics apart.  Many of his children, as well as his late wife, apparently, feel/felt that he was too hard on them, that his expectations were too high.  Yet that must be tempered by the fact that he had no problem what the children did, just that they were successful.  In fact, he wanted them to be very successful.I immediately thought of the film 'About Schmidt', which came out seven years earlier.  Like this film, Schmidt concerned a retired man who has just lost his wife.  As played by Jack Nicholson, Schmidt had to learn to reconnect with his only child.

1291699,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B002VECLZK,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Robert De Niro portrays a father, Frank Goode, who is a very recent widower and is trying to re-establish relationships with his four children on a different level than before his wife passed away.  He now understands that they do not share much of a connection with him. It appears that he was the parent which the children were continually pushed by to get ahead while their mother offered a listening ear and an accepting heart.  They maintained  an ease of conversation and an easy affinity with her while their father was much more focused on their success in life. Frank was a hardworking man all during that time and continually grappled for the best to secure his children's futures, an almost perfectionism of which he pushed them to attain. We understand his position much more in depth later in the film.  Written and directed by Kirk Jones, who offers a heavy hand of vulnerability and a lonely feel to De Niro's portrayal that was both refreshingly believable as well as heartbreaking.  With lovely scenery (Henry Braham) of the country, passing by one telephone pole to another, and interesting family depictions in varying locales, the film is quite appealing in its visual as in its well played out, huge heart of a family coming to terms.After an all-out, planned, get together with the family, replete with fine wine, steaks on  a brand new grill, bought - then put together their father, and including all of any extras, Frank finds his children, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), Robert (Sam Rockwell), and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) all calling with some reason why they each cannot attend.  His son David also does not respond so he spends a terribly lonely night at home by himself, with all the aforementioned fare, that is so heart aching to view that it leaves you wondering; Why?  What could his children individually be thinking of to all turn their father down?  What could make his children all on the same occasion be so alienated from him, offering each of their excuses?  These, and many other answers to questions Frank needs to understand, compel him to leave soon to visit each one of his children in order to offer a surprise visit.  Basically, he just arrives at their individual residences or places where they are at.  He needs to see his children now more than ever before realizing many more aspects of relationships.Frank is not altogether physically healthy so he seeks out his medical doctor for a check-up to inquire about leaving and travels against his advice instead of just ""spending time in the garden"" as suggested.  What transpires next is a road trip while riding the rails and then changing buses from one big city to the next.  Included is a small cameo by Melissa Leo as Colleen who gives Frank a ride in her semitrailer truck after the buses are through running for the night, he sees a great deal of the country by these venues.  He feels a huge void without his children in his life. Exemplified by his wife's passing away, he desperately feels the need for his family and to know how everyone is doing in their lives.  Are they successful? Are they happy? Why aren't they keeping in touch?This is just a slight outline of the plot as I wouldn't want to give away any of the many points of interest or the plentiful heart-tugging details from the story.  The film can be appreciated for being slower in its pacing, emotional without being flat, including its lighter moments at just the right time while Robert De Niro gives a poignant and feeling portrayal of a father in search of his family's story.  Of which the whole, together, can only offer its totality.  Even the most subtle of portrayals can make a huge statement as we find the recognition of a father's life spent the best way he could at the time and his selfless love of family in ""Everybody's Fine"".",5,"""I'd Be Proud Of You No Matter What You Did"" - Frank Goode",1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,3810,"['Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'father', 'Frank', 'Goode', 'who', 'very', 'recent', 'widower', 'trying', 're-establish', 'relationships', 'four', 'children', 'different', 'level', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'now', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'much', 'connection', 'was', 'parent', 'children', 'were', 'continually', 'pushed', 'get', 'ahead', 'mother', 'offered', 'listening', 'ear', 'accepting', 'heart', 'maintained', 'ease', 'conversation', 'easy', 'affinity', 'father', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'success', 'life', 'Frank', 'was', 'hardworking', 'man', 'time', 'continually', 'grappled', 'best', 'secure', 'children', 'futures', 'almost', 'perfectionism', 'pushed', 'attain', 'understand', 'position', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'later', 'film', 'Written', 'directed', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'who', 'heavy', 'hand', 'vulnerability', 'lonely', 'feel', 'De', 'Niro', 'portrayal', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'heartbreaking', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'Henry', 'Braham', 'country', 'passing', 'one', 'telephone', 'pole', 'interesting', 'family', 'depictions', 'varying', 'locales', 'film', 'quite', 'appealing', 'visual', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'huge', 'heart', 'family', 'coming', 'terms.After', 'all-out', 'planned', 'get', 'together', 'family', 'replete', 'fine', 'wine', 'steaks', 'brand', 'new', 'grill', 'bought', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'father', 'including', 'extras', 'Frank', 'children', 'Amy', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Robert', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Rosie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'calling', 'reason', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'attend', 'son', 'David', 'also', 'not', 'respond', 'so', 'terribly', 'lonely', 'night', 'home', 'aforementioned', 'fare', 'so', 'heart', 'aching', 'view', 'wondering', 'Why', 'What', 'could', 'children', 'individually', 'be', 'thinking', 'turn', 'father', 'down', 'What', 'could', 'make', 'children', 'same', 'occasion', 'be', 'so', 'alienated', 'offering', 'excuses', 'many', 'other', 'answers', 'questions', 'Frank', 'understand', 'compel', 'leave', 'soon', 'visit', 'one', 'children', 'order', 'offer', 'surprise', 'visit', 'Basically', 'just', 'individual', 'residences', 'places', 'where', 'are', 'see', 'children', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'realizing', 'many', 'more', 'aspects', 'relationships.Frank', 'not', 'altogether', 'physically', 'healthy', 'out', 'medical', 'doctor', 'check-up', 'inquire', 'leaving', 'travels', 'advice', 'instead', 'just', 'spending', 'time', 'garden', 'suggested', 'What', 'next', 'road', 'trip', 'riding', 'rails', 'then', 'changing', 'buses', 'one', 'big', 'city', 'next', 'Included', 'small', 'cameo', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Colleen', 'who', 'Frank', 'ride', 'semitrailer', 'truck', 'buses', 'are', 'running', 'night', 'great', 'deal', 'country', 'venues', 'huge', 'void', 'children', 'life', 'Exemplified', 'wife', 'passing', 'away', 'desperately', 'need', 'family', 'know', 'how', 'everyone', 'doing', 'lives', 'Are', 'successful', 'Are', 'happy', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'touch', 'just', 'slight', 'outline', 'plot', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'many', 'points', 'interest', 'plentiful', 'heart-tugging', 'details', 'story', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'being', 'slower', 'pacing', 'emotional', 'being', 'flat', 'including', 'lighter', 'moments', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'poignant', 'feeling', 'portrayal', 'father', 'search', 'family', 'story', 'whole', 'together', 'can', 'only', 'offer', 'totality', 'Even', 'most', 'subtle', 'portrayals', 'can', 'make', 'huge', 'statement', 'find', 'recognition', 'father', 'life', 'spent', 'best', 'way', 'could', 'time', 'selfless', 'love', 'family', 'Everybody', 'Fine']",N/A

And because millions can identify in some way it is worth seeing. The topic has been covered many times but never gets tiring. And this is a fresh take as it is from the perspective of, not mom, not a woman, but a man--dad. This perspective seems to be lost since ""liberation"", since the 70s, 80s, and beyond. While it would be easy for someone of my age to not know better I have seen movies before this 70s, before my time, and realize that since then things are usually told from a woman's perspective.

I am aware that some people, in particular, in a certain region of the US, use Christ's name as a curse word, they should be as PC as they claim and realize it is really offense to others--to Christians. and 2) the ""ghost""/imaginary scene in the hospital toward the end . . . it added nothing and kinda cheapened the point that we, the viewer, had been taken to at that point. It was enough to hear DeNiro's character's doubts at that point and then to hear the real truth later with the telephone pole painting scene, if felt. Anyway it was a cute story. Sad. Very sad.
