After the third season though, it seemed things started to slowly go down hill.  We miss Colonel Blake, Trapper John and Frank!  Colonel Potter is grouchy most of the time, B.J.'s jokes are corny, and Winchester is only funny some of the time.  It just seems like after season five especially, things start to get so serious.  I thought MASH was a funny show!  Why all the issues now and tears?  The show on season nine when Hawkeye has his breakdown is especially finger down throat.  And no Radar or Klinger in a dress?

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","AUTHOR'S NOTE: Spoilers are in this review.REVIEWThe ninth season of ""MASH"" pushes the ensemble cast and crack writing and creative staff even further, and delivers a humanely compelling product.  The majority of episodes from this season stand as some of the best in the series.The season premiere ""The Best of Enemies"" tells of Hawkeye ostensibly on R&R;, yet ambushed by a gun-wielding enemy soldier.  Though the soldier doesn't speak English, and Hawkeye doesn't know Korean, the surgeon must perform delicate surgery on a critically wounded friend of the soldier while under gunpoint.  The episode ""Letters"" has the 4077th write responses to a classroom of young students in America, and Hawkeye gets a particularly tough assignment.  Ultimately, the power of this episode comes from the philosophical and emotional journeys of the soldier doctors as they reflect on their jobs, their pastimes, and the life they're missing back in the States.  A particularly powerful Christmas-themed show called ""Death Takes A Holiday"" emphasizes the limitations of surgeons as a trio of them work to save a badly wounded man before Christmas is over.  ""Father's Day"" puts a spotlight on Loretta Swit, as Margaret's crusty father 'Howitzer' Al Houlihan comes to the camp.  This is also a very strong episode for Harry Morgan as Colonel Potter.The ninth season of ""MASH"" demonstrates depth, intelligence, and thematic cohesion as well as richness.

937568,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000B837XS,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[6, 14]","I loved the early M*A*S*H episodes.  Equally intelligent, humane, cynical, sardonic, and just right out hilarious, they were some of the best television ever produced.  Unfortunately, the show moved away from this formula (which worked amazingly well) to the latter day formula.  The show became overly preachy, annoying, incredibly sanctimonious, politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  The show ran for 11 seasons, and with all sitcoms that run too long, it quickly ran out of juice.  But that doesn't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards.  Hawkeye and BJ's characters became incredibly annoying, especially Hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses.  It was funny early on, but as he aged, it became more and more childish.  Alda's acting is way over the top in these later seasons.  Since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes, I suppose no one told him to tone it down.  Charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here, and the one I like the most.  You're not supposed to like him because of his ""blue blood"" upbringing, but you do anyway, because Hawkeye and BJ are so damn irritating.  You would think that BJ and Hawkeye wouldn't be so naive sometimes about things, considering they've been in a war now for years.  Soldiers are very jaded, cynical people, and with good reason.  They don't get more naive as time progresses.  The early episodes had Hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones, and it should be the other way around.  Watch the first 3 seasons (except when Henry gets killed, which was just done for cheap shock value).

937572,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B000B837XS,M. Fields,"[5, 7]","MASH has been rated one of the funniest shows of all time.  It's a gem in an otherwise sea of boredom.  Granted that some seasons are funnier than others but that's par for the course.  Some say that Alan Alda was full of himself by the time the 9th season rolled around.  Truth is he may have been but he knew what he was doing.  Alda had become fond and protective of his character and rightly so.  He and the rest of the cast had invested a great deal in the show.  Alda's Groucho Marx approach to comedy added a lot lof laugh's to an already kooky show.  Somtimes serious, reflective, unbelieveable, and reverent.  MASH achieved something that is hard to achieve in television.  Mixing pathos and humor is very difficult at best but there are a handful of shows that mastered this art.  Namely: All in the Family, Night Court, Soap, Maude and The Golden Girls just to name a few.  All votes being counted All in the Family was probably the best at it.MASH wasn't just funny, it was insane.  If you pay close attention you will notice that Hawkeye's verbal exhanges with Trapper John and B.J. are identical.  The lines are different but the rapid fire, timing and delivery are the same.  I believe that Alda didn't want to sacrfice the comedy by switching things too drastically.  The cast change was change enough.  The departure of Frank Burns was a necessity after awhile because people like Frank Burns don't change too often.  In a sitcom a character must show some growth or maturation otherwise the character stagnates and the overall tone of the show succumbs.  Case in point: Corporal Klinger finally starts to grow up and quits the crossdressing dodge.  He takes over the company clerk spot after Radar gets sent home.  He had to change and mature.  The audience would have grown weary of his antics.MASH is one of those shows in which you should collect all in the series because all though every show may not be funny to you, there are very funny shows from every season.  Watch them all.  If you don't you may not discover a few things that I did when I watched them.  Harry Morgan (Col. Potter) has a lovely bass singing voice.  Loretta Swit (Hot Lips) is very good at making herself shed tears.

Loretta Swit, and David Ogden Stiers were all nominated for Emmys) ample dramatic license."" In short, the series was neither searching for an identity not struggling for an audience...it had both. M*A*S*H had re-invented itself successfully in the wake of departures from Larry Linville, McLean Stevenson, Wayne Rogers & Gary Burghoff. The cast members that would see the series to its end in Season 11 were fully formed in Season 9...no longer the ""new guys."" The best example of how ""tears flow almost as freely as the blood and laughter,"" as Amazon puts it, can be found in ""Death Takes A Holiday."" I won't offer spoilers here, but let's just say that it's the combination of 1). The Christmas Eve activity of Hawkeye, Hot Lips and B.J., 2). Winchester's ""traditional"" act, 3). The statement that Klinger makes when he brings dinner to Winchester, and 4). Potter's reaction to all of the above. This is a solid, powerful season.

This is certainly one of the greatest ninth seasons of any show in history. not one weak episode. This didn't hurt the series at all.Just a few:Best Of Enemies - Not only do we get to see Hawkeye forced to operate under severe emotional strain, we also get to see Bridge played With Marquis De Sade rules. Colonel Potter gets a letter with a winning bridge hand that his wife, Mildred, won with. This gets the whole camp going for a bridge match. Ends up with Potter, Charles, Margaret, and B.J playing in numerous line-ups, and the good Father winning a bet on who wins.Father's Day. Hawkeye is working on a patient whose face is seriously damaged, but he's glad to be alive. In return he sends Hawkeye an entire side of beef. This leads to serious problems as Margaret's ultra-military father comes to visit. Classic episode.War For All Seasons - This episode covers one entire year. Included is Father Mulcahy showing off his green thumb. There's the project of B.J and Hawkeye's that takes a while to build a piece of equipment. Then, finally, there's the baseball bet made between Klinger and Potter, which gets Charles interested, and then the whole camp.Your Retention Please - A duplicious retention officer comes in just as Klinger gets bad news about his ex getting re-married. A male nurse, who's not an officer, takes issue with the retention officer. This is where we get to see Klinger as Lady Godiva on Potter's horse Sophie. He thought that he'd just re-inlisted for six more years when the retention officer tricked him. Potter made him read off an oath. Fortunately, for Klinger, it was the oath for President of the U.S. Of A!No Sweat - it's a hot hot night. Margaret has a rash in an embarassing spot, leading to comedic actions in the O.R. Klinger takes the P.A system apart. Charles has tax issue. Potter can't get any sleep because Margaret needs some meds for her rash. Charles needs carbon paper, and such. Great ending, everyone gets a good laugh.Depressing News - I.Corp. sends the 4077th 50K tongue depressors by mistake. Hawkeye creates a tower with them. He lists every patient that ever went through the unit on the tongue depressors.Bottoms up - Practical jokes get out of hand, which lands Hawkeye in hot water.The Red/White Blues - A routine check-up by Hawkeye finds that Potter's blood pressure is just too high. Everyone babies him, and Klinger's actions are totally mis-construed.The Foresght Saga - A happy letter from Radar is belied when Potter, with the whole gang in the office, calls Ottumwa and finds things are rough. This leads B.J, and the rest to solve the problem with a Korean who gives them vegetables.The Life You Save - With the camp being peppered with sniper fire during Pre-op, Charles takes a whole new look at life, and death. Hawkeye takes over the kitchen, Mulcahy is the garabage officer, and so forth. Sadness, and light comedy highlight his episode. This is where Charles really becomes a much more down-to earth person. He becomes more humane, and caring after this episode. He's also not as fast to jump on others for things that happen.In the end the loss of Radar may have hurt the show a bit. However, MASH recovered. It went on for another 4 seasons. It still won awards, triggered emotions, and tugged at heart strings.

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[104, 111]","A lot of people like to complain about the later years of M*A*S*H, saying it got too ""serious"" and that Alan Alda was too full of himself and the show got this whole ""anti-war"" attitude behind it. The original movie was perceived to have that same attitude by many to this day. I don't think I could do the work the characters in this Army hospital did on a daily (and sometimes more often) basis and NOT hate the war. By season three, we'd lost Henry Blake to a plane crash, and Trapper went home. A couple seasons down the road, Frank Burns went AWOL and that was the end of him. During season eight, Radar went home to take care of the family farm. Those are all realities of war, folks. M*A*S*H was a reflection of that. The war was not a funny place to be. The fact that these people could crack wise when they were up to their elbows in wounded soldiers was merely a reflection of how the human spirit can allow us to do things we never expected to be able to do, even in the face of huge adversity. I never found Col. Potter, Capt. Hunnicutt or Major Winchester inferior to Blake, Trapper and Frank in the least. Different, yes, but definitely not any less funny or less vital to the series' development. ER, now in its 13th season (I think), carries on with just about no one from the first season. People come and people go. I thought Season Nine of M*A*S*H was every bit as valid and as vital as the very first season...maybe for different reasons...but the show worked from strength to strength. I felt Col. Potter was a much more believeable than Henry Blake, not to say Blake wasn't funny. He was. But Harry Morgan brought something else to M*A*S*H that I don't think anyone else could have. Even Charles Emerson Winchester, as different as you could ask for form Frank Burns realized this was a family, not just a team of surgeons stuck in Hell's kitchen, and lo and behold, had his moments of downright nobility. Those who stuck with the show through its entire run saw that. M*A*S*H Season Nine will be a welcome addition to my M*A*S*H collection. Every single season of M*A*S*H had classic episodes...not very many series can claim that. The show still fascinates me and makes me laugh 22 years after it departed first-run network TV.
