1354440,AJVK8E6MEF6WU,B003MSY968,Alex,"[22, 25]","After being totally wowed by ""Agata and the Storm"" and ""Days and Clouds,"" Soldini's latest film did not disappoint.  Like his other movies, ""Come Undone"" explores a relationship.  Here, we see apathetic Anna (played by Alba Rohrwacher) and charming Domenico (Pierfrancesco Favino) have an affair, despite both being in committed relationships - Domenico even has children.  Anna's life was perfectly fine before with a tragically caring and sweet-hearted man, Alessio (played clueless but kind by Giuseppe Battiston), and a stable lifestyle.  Of course, though, too much of a good life becomes boring and she is thus led into her relationship with Domenico after a chance meeting.  They have an irresistible attraction, to be sure.  Rohrwacher and Favino are magnificent together; the sexual attraction is palpable and practically jumping off the screen.""Come Undone"" could have been just like any other movie about the affair but Soldini and his co-screenwriters, Doriana Leondeff and Angelo Carbone, made it different by choosing to focus on the daily aspects of life.  Rather than giving great importance to big events and happenings, ""Come Undone"" instead looks at the time that make up the majority of a lifetime: regular days.  We see how the affair takes a toll on these days as well as the lives of Alessio, Domenico's wife Miriam (Teresa Saponangelo) and their kids, as well some of Anna and Domenico's family and friends.  ""Come Undone"" takes into account the practical and prudent aspects of having an affair: where and when to meet, how to communicate, and, most importantly, how to fund the affair.  This different perspective on an old story is what makes Soldini's newest movie so fascinating.  That the actors convey real people and really make us care for them - no matter how immoral they may be - is a lucky and happy addition to an overall moving film.",5,Fascinating detail of daily life in an affair,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1872,"['being', 'totally', 'wowed', 'Agata', 'Storm', 'Days', 'Clouds', 'Soldini', 'latest', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'other', 'movies', 'Come', 'Undone', 'relationship', 'Here', 'see', 'apathetic', 'Anna', 'played', 'Alba', 'Rohrwacher', 'charming', 'Domenico', 'Pierfrancesco', 'Favino', 'have', 'affair', 'being', 'committed', 'relationships', 'Domenico', 'even', 'children', 'Anna', 'life', 'was', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'tragically', 'caring', 'sweet-hearted', 'man', 'Alessio', 'played', 'clueless', 'kind', 'Giuseppe', 'Battiston', 'stable', 'lifestyle', 'course', 'though', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'life', 'becomes', 'boring', 'thus', 'led', 'relationship', 'Domenico', 'chance', 'meeting', 'have', 'irresistible', 'attraction', 'be', 'sure', 'Rohrwacher', 'Favino', 'are', 'magnificent', 'together', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'palpable', 'practically', 'jumping', 'off', 'screen', 'Come', 'Undone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'affair', 'Soldini', 'co-screenwriters', 'Doriana', 'Leondeff', 'Angelo', 'Carbone', 'made', 'different', 'choosing', 'focus', 'daily', 'aspects', 'life', 'Rather', 'giving', 'great', 'importance', 'big', 'events', 'happenings', 'Come', 'Undone', 'instead', 'time', 'make', 'up', 'majority', 'lifetime', 'regular', 'days', 'see', 'how', 'affair', 'toll', 'days', 'as', 'well', 'lives', 'Alessio', 'Domenico', 'wife', 'Miriam', 'Teresa', 'Saponangelo', 'kids', 'well', 'Anna', 'Domenico', 'family', 'friends', 'Come', 'Undone', 'account', 'practical', 'prudent', 'aspects', 'having', 'affair', 'where', 'when', 'meet', 'how', 'communicate', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'fund', 'affair', 'different', 'perspective', 'old', 'story', 'what', 'Soldini', 'newest', 'movie', 'so', 'fascinating', 'actors', 'convey', 'real', 'people', 'really', 'make', 'care', 'matter', 'how', 'immoral', 'may', 'be', 'lucky', 'happy', 'addition', 'overall', 'moving', 'film']",Come Undone
1354441,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B003MSY968,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[10, 11]","Come Undone is a beautiful film about infidelity, passion, and love.Anna is a wonderful pretty sweet woman, married to an overweight wonderful, caring Alessio. He fixes things, and is the nicest person in the world, but very white bread. Domenico is a waiter for a catering company. He is a bit spicier, whole wheat bread with a bit of coriander. Domenico serves Anna a shrimp canap&eacute; at an office party. There is an instant spark between the two, and the story unfolds from there.The film follows a somewhat predictable arc, the happiness and passion of the first hour is beautiful and carefree, followed by the final hour of more explicit scenes and arguments. Although it is predictible, there is something incredible about this film. The acting is remarkable. Alessio is a schlub in the opening scenes, how could a thin pretty woman be married to this man? But as the film moves forward, Alessio becomes more and more handsome, a more wonderful person. The cast is perfect.This is an intimate film. Framing is tight around the characters, sometimes so tight it feels uncomfortable. Focus is always on the key person in the scene, with rapid fall off around them, this makes the characters stand out dramatically each scene. The bedroom scenes are beautifully filmed, the passion is strong. The director leaves just enough to the imagination. Overall this was a wonderfully shot, recorded, and edited film.This film is for mature audiences. The film is presented in Italian with English subtitles that can be turned off. There is nudity, but no full frontal male nudity. The theme of infidelity is a mature one, although it is dealt with in a caring way.I loved all the characters in this film. I cared about what happened to them. Even the supporting cast, the friend couple, the coworkers, and the families were well defined and I cared about them. This is a film about love and passion. I enjoyed this film very much.This is a FilmMovements release. A three minute short movie is included on the DVD. It is a genuinely creepy animated film about two dogs at a restaurant. The dialog was really strange, I think it was a bad translation from German. In German, this might be a funnier film.

1354445,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003MSY968,Grady Harp,"[50, 51]","COME UNDONE ('Cosa voglio di pi&ugrave;', the Italian title means 'What More Do I Want') is a very slight film by the well respected director Silvio Soldini ('Bread and Tulips', 'Days and Clouds', etc), a story that seems to get mired in its own passion, unable to transmit a story line that will keep the audience's attention. Perhaps this is due to the 'too many cooks spoil the broth' concept: in addition to Soldini the story and screenplay were nursed by Doriana Leondeff, and Angelo Carbone. The cast is a strong one but the actors are just not given much to develop, leaving the audience with the repeated question 'what if...?'Anna (Alba Rohrwacher) is an accountant for an important insurance firm and lives with her longterm lover Alessio (Giuseppe Battiston) - a man who longs fro a stable longterm relationship with children, a home, etc.  Anna, feeling as though the fire has fizzled in that relationship and takes up with co-worker Domenico (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the two begin a passionate affair. Now it is Anna who is considering a longterm relationship but is thwarted by the fact that Domenico is married to Miriam (Teresa Saponangelo) and has children and doesn't want to leave his wife, instead preferring passionate occasional intervals  with Anna in tacky motels.  It becomes a struggle of human nature - which is preferable, a stable home life or intermittent moments of passion?The actors give this film their all and the encounters between Anna  and Domenico are incredibly sensuous.  The problem lies with the story's lack of resolution or even momentum: it gets stuck in the process of offering a solution for the lovers. It is simply not up to the same standards as Soldini's other works - but those are fairly high standards to reach.  Given the film's few flaws it is still a beautiful visual experience.

For some unknown reason a young married woman decides on having an affair.  The scenes are LONG and drawn out.  You watch her driving around town for several minutes on the way to the hotel they go to.  Why?There was one funny part of the movie.  At one point when the female star is somewhere in Arabia with her lover, she is offered earrings that match the color of her eyes.  For 2 hours I had been wondering what color her eyes were.  She constantly wears so much black eyeliner her eyes look clownish, or more accurately described as goulish.Unappealing and unattractive actors. Yuk.
