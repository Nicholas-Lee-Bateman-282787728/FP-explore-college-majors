About 20 minutes or less into the movie, you can see the ending coming. That aside, it's a decent plot that could have been a good movie. I even think the acting is pretty good. My biggest issue with the movie that rather than making some of the situations cute, it goes for crass and explicit talk and references to sexual situations. I suppose for some people it's no big deal, but for me it made the movie a bit uncomfortable to watch.The movie follows a girl who just lost her job and has just read an article about how women who have had more than 20 lovers have a hard time marrying. This leads to her contracting her womanizing neighbor to help her track down ex-boyfriends to see if they might have changed and might be the one for her to marry. This does lead to some comical situations, but it kind of peters out while other plot lines such as her sister's wedding and the back and forth between her and her neighbor take over.

However, I'm a firm believer that the brilliant comedic stylings of Anna Faris can make just about ANY movie watchable, and in this case, despite a so-so storyline, her impeccable track record continues.In a nutshell, Faris plays a woman who, after reading a magazine article which suggests the number of men she has slept with makes her statistically less likely to ever settle down and find ""the one,"" decides to revisit her old lovers in the hopes of snaring one of them back in for good. True, it is kind of a hokey premise, but not as ""been there, done that"" as some other plot devices I can think of. Chris Evans is very likeable (not to mention awfully yummy) as her neighbor who is in on her plans and helps her along, though eventually discovers he might just have some romantic feelings for her himself. Is it predictable? Very much so. Do romantic comedy cliches abound? Of course. But the two leads do have great chemistry, and with the plethora of wacky characters encountered along the way there are plenty of clever one-liners and naughty catchphrases you'll probably find yourself repeating in conversation the next day.

The premise centers around Ally Darling (Faris), who, after being fired from her job, stumbles across an article in a Marie Claire magazine that says the average amount of sexual partners you should have in your lifetime is around 10. Ally's number is considerably higher than that. So, she assumes she has already met the person she was supposed to marry and starts on a quest to find out which one of the men she had been with and should have stuck with.As far as romantic comedies go, it's not a bad premise, but the problem is, ""What's Your Number?"" tries way too hard to be funny and poignant and fails at both. I won't deny that some of the humor in the movie made me laugh. For the most part though, the comedic attempts were way over the top and seemed to fall flat like a lump of coal.For instance, as she waits for one of her men to cross the restaurant, we get a slow motion moment where he greets everybody in the place like he's a rock star or Mr. Popularity and Ally's hair catches on fire from a barbecue pit behind her. There are numerous moments like this. She falls over a fence and says a bad word and of course there are children nearby who begin to chant the dirty word over and over.One message the movie has that resonated with me was its message about love and how you can tell for yourself what love is. Unfortunately, it was the only thing in the movie that grabbed me. It was too long, clich&eacute; and poorly written from beginning to end.Many of the scenes in the movie also seemed to be staged just to highlight a different spot in the city of Boston. I'm pretty sure that the city of Boston paid a pretty penny for this movie and because of that had a lot of say in what, where and when scenes would be shot, all the way up to the final shot of the film. Of course the break-in strip basketball scene at Boston's Bank North Garden basketball court was solid proof of that.""What's Your Number?"" is not a very good movie. It's desperate flailing for laughs and moments is evidence enough they knew they had a lot of work to do in order to overcome a lackluster script.",1,Trys to hard to be funny,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2337,"['What', 'Number', 'R-rated', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'known', 'being', 'quirky', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'role', 'movie', 'House', 'Bunny', 'counterpart', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'premise', 'centers', 'Ally', 'Darling', 'Faris', 'who', 'being', 'fired', 'job', 'article', 'Marie', 'Claire', 'magazine', 'average', 'amount', 'sexual', 'partners', 'should', 'have', 'lifetime', 'around', '10', 'Ally', 'number', 'considerably', 'higher', 'So', 'already', 'met', 'person', 'was', 'supposed', 'marry', 'starts', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'men', 'had', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'with.As', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'not', 'bad', 'premise', 'problem', 'What', 'Number', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'poignant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'humor', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'most', 'part', 'comedic', 'attempts', 'were', 'way', 'top', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat', 'lump', 'coal.For', 'instance', 'one', 'men', 'cross', 'restaurant', 'get', 'slow', 'motion', 'moment', 'where', 'everybody', 'place', 'rock', 'star', 'Mr', 'Popularity', 'Ally', 'hair', 'catches', 'fire', 'barbecue', 'pit', 'are', 'numerous', 'moments', 'fence', 'bad', 'word', 'course', 'are', 'children', 'nearby', 'who', 'begin', 'chant', 'dirty', 'word', 'over.One', 'message', 'movie', 'resonated', 'was', 'message', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'grabbed', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'clich', 'eacute', 'poorly', 'written', 'beginning', 'end.Many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'staged', 'just', 'highlight', 'different', 'spot', 'city', 'Boston', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'city', 'Boston', 'paid', 'pretty', 'penny', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'shot', 'way', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'course', 'break-in', 'strip', 'basketball', 'scene', 'Boston', 'Bank', 'North', 'Garden', 'basketball', 'court', 'was', 'solid', 'proof', 'What', 'Number', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'desperate', 'flailing', 'laughs', 'moments', 'evidence', 'knew', 'had', 'lot', 'work', 'do', 'order', 'overcome', 'lackluster', 'script']",What's Your Number

Whether it's physical, slapstick comedy or witty dialogue or even obscenity-laced party girl rogue, Faris makes all of it look easy (and easy on the eye).  And the rom-com WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? is the perfect vehicle for Faris's many talents, as she plays slightly wild child Ally Darling, an unlucky-at-love free spirit who--with her baby sister's approaching nuptials--starts to feel that biological clock ticking, and decides it's time to get serious about finding Mr. Right; yet at the same time, concerned that her 20 prior bedroom partners might make her appear unseemly to a ""decent"" man, decides she'll look up the 20 former boyfriends to see if she's already met Mr. Right, and fall in love with him all over again.  For assistance, she enlists the aid of her neighbor Colin (a mega-buffed Chris Evans), an unemployed womanizer who always makes himself at home in Ally's apartment while he waits for the latest one-night-stand lady to awaken and leave his apartment.  Colin and Ally are platonic pals (or are they?) who enjoy hanging out together--from playing strip horse at Boston Garden to skinny dipping in Boston Harbor--yet every viewer happily watching these two knows exactly where this platonic friendship is going.Faris and Evans have tremendous chemistry and the same level of (almost furious) energy.  They look like they had grand fun making WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?, and it shows, and definitely pays off.  The supporting cast is solid, including the beautiful Ari Graynor as Ally's sister Daisy, a stoic Blythe Danner as Ally and Daisy's doting mother, Ed Begley Jr. as Ally and Daisy's free-spirited father, and a host of actors comprising the former beaus.  (By far the biggest hoot from moi came during the rendezvous with the former beau practicing gynecology.)

It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today's dating/quasi-relationship scene, but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny, so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back, put feet up, and giggle along with it genre.Ally Darling (!) (Anna Faris) has a history of having many ex-boy connections  who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters (Ally has exceeded the norm) she freaks and believes that she can't find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her ex-encounters searching for Mr Right, she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea (Chris Evans), a would-be musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them, to act as her detective.  The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent (and fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice) and she looks terrific.  But the biggest treat in the film is Chris Evans appearing in the buff often enough to keep the movie on: not only does he enjoy his Adonis body but he seems happy allowing it to buff up an otherwise routine comedy part.  There is another attraction in the wings - Oliver Jackson-Cohen - who seems to have a future in film.

Anna Faris, as usual (see The House Bunny) nails each moment with the best comedic timing out there.The supporting cast includes Blythe Danner, Ed Begley Jr, Joel McHale (from The Soup)Also, for anyone contemplating whether or not to purchase this movie to see Chris Evans, there are countless times where he appears barely clothed.

1510748,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0065N6IRK,Noelle Eiram,"[2, 2]","In spite of its mixed messages about female sexuality, What's Your Number is surprisingly funny and even touching. Anna Faris plays Ally who hopes to find a date to her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) wedding. After reading that most women who have twenty or more sexual partners never settle down, she is determined that her next lay be ""the one."" To prevent raising the number of men she's slept with, Ally enlists the help of her philandering neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to track down her exes hoping they improved over time.One of the film's problems is its unintentional similarities to the superior Bridesmaids. The heroine has mixed feelings about a wedding, meets a man who encourages her to follow her artistic sensibilities, and struggles with unemployment. (""Struggles"" is an overstatement; considering their financial situations, these characters have remarkable apartments.) Even the opening scene contains a gag that is nearly identical to one in Bridesmaids.Still, the movie is more irreverent and amusing than most romantic comedies. Farris is hilarious as Ally, a young woman who makes many mistakes but never runs out of optimism. Evans is fairly appealing as Colin, the obligatory rogue with a heart of gold. Since he admits that he can hardly spend time with a woman without trying to sleep with her, she doesn't consider him an option. Instead, she rendezvous with an assortment of ex-boyfriends and flings, played by a pleasing array of actors. A large part of the movie's appeal consists of her awkward interactions with men played by familiar faces such as Joel McHale, Chris Pratt, Zachary Quinto, Martin Freeman, and Anthony Mackie.The film also focuses on Ally's relationship with her family. She feels out of place with her more conventional sister and perfectly coiffed mother, in spite of their close relationships. All this, of course, channels towards her inevitable lesson about love and being herself. Many women will identify with her grapples with relationship advice, the media, and questions about a ""normal"" modern woman's sexual appetites. The movie touches on the thin line between giving someone a chance and trying to force a relationship.Unfortunately, the movie undermines some of its more progressive themes. It certainly includes sexist stereotypes, not to mention weightism. Ally is meant to be a disaster, but she often looks perfect and is shot sexually. (To be fair, Colin is naked throughout most of the movie.) When it comes down to it, though Ally doesn't fit into the film world, she is still a man's ideal woman. She isn't high maintenance, enjoys watching and playing sports (in one scene, she engages in a sexy one-on-one basketball game--in her underwear), and is up for almost anything.There are definitely moments where the film crosses the line into poor taste. The whole thing is difficult to take seriously. The ""comedic"" music makes the movie feel as though it should have a laugh track. But What's Your Number ultimately conveys the ""life is messy: embrace it"" message with (mostly) good-natured humor.",3,Surprisingly funny,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,3066,"['spite', 'mixed', 'messages', 'female', 'sexuality', 'What', 'Number', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'even', 'touching', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Ally', 'who', 'find', 'date', 'sister', 'Daisy', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'wedding', 'reading', 'most', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'twenty', 'more', 'sexual', 'partners', 'never', 'settle', 'down', 'determined', 'next', 'lay', 'be', 'one', 'prevent', 'raising', 'number', 'men', 'slept', 'Ally', 'help', 'philandering', 'neighbor', 'Colin', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'track', 'down', 'exes', 'hoping', 'improved', 'time.One', 'film', 'problems', 'unintentional', 'similarities', 'superior', 'Bridesmaids', 'heroine', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'wedding', 'man', 'who', 'follow', 'artistic', 'sensibilities', 'unemployment', 'Struggles', 'overstatement', 'considering', 'financial', 'situations', 'characters', 'have', 'remarkable', 'apartments', 'Even', 'opening', 'scene', 'gag', 'nearly', 'identical', 'one', 'Bridesmaids.Still', 'movie', 'more', 'irreverent', 'amusing', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Farris', 'hilarious', 'Ally', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'many', 'mistakes', 'never', 'optimism', 'Evans', 'fairly', 'appealing', 'Colin', 'obligatory', 'rogue', 'heart', 'gold', 'can', 'hardly', 'spend', 'time', 'woman', 'trying', 'sleep', ""n't"", 'consider', 'option', 'Instead', 'assortment', 'ex-boyfriends', 'flings', 'played', 'pleasing', 'array', 'actors', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'appeal', 'awkward', 'interactions', 'men', 'played', 'familiar', 'such', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Anthony', 'Mackie.The', 'film', 'also', 'Ally', 'relationship', 'family', 'place', 'more', 'conventional', 'sister', 'perfectly', 'coiffed', 'mother', 'spite', 'close', 'relationships', 'course', 'channels', 'inevitable', 'lesson', 'love', 'being', 'Many', 'women', 'will', 'identify', 'grapples', 'relationship', 'advice', 'media', 'questions', 'normal', 'modern', 'woman', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'movie', 'touches', 'thin', 'line', 'giving', 'someone', 'chance', 'trying', 'force', 'relationship.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'more', 'progressive', 'themes', 'certainly', 'sexist', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'mention', 'weightism', 'Ally', 'meant', 'be', 'disaster', 'often', 'perfect', 'shot', 'sexually', 'be', 'fair', 'Colin', 'naked', 'most', 'movie', 'When', 'down', 'though', 'Ally', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'world', 'still', 'man', 'ideal', 'woman', ""n't"", 'high', 'maintenance', 'watching', 'playing', 'sports', 'one', 'scene', 'sexy', 'one-on-one', 'basketball', 'game', 'underwear', 'up', 'almost', 'are', 'definitely', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'line', 'poor', 'taste', 'whole', 'thing', 'difficult', 'take', 'seriously', 'comedic', 'music', 'movie', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'laugh', 'track', 'What', 'Number', 'ultimately', 'conveys', 'life', 'messy', 'embrace', 'message', 'mostly', 'good-natured', 'humor']",What's Your Number

Honestly though, I really didn't like this movie. Anna can either be cute or really awkward and abrasive, and she fell into the latter alot of this movie. If the movie would have pushed the comedy harder (or maybe they thought they did :/), it would have turned out better, because Anna does better when she's being goofier. When you have a premise such as how many people you've had sex with, you kind of just have to go for it, and this movie kind of made it uncomfortable to watch when it didn't have to be.Some of the meant to be comedic moments (i.e. the wannabe senator asking her to be the straight wife to him as a gay husband, and Jole Hale smelling his fingers *gag*) were just downright sad. The only thing likeable was Chris and his arc, which they managed to do pretty well. The time was also way too long; the version I watched clocked in at 1:45, way too long for a movie like this.If you like romcoms and/or raunchy gal humor..don't even bother trying this to see if you like it unless you just want to stare at Chris.

Ally (Faris) is having a bad day after breaking up with her boyfriend she loses her job.  While on the way to her sisters she reads an article in a magazine that says the average number of men a woman sleeps with in her life is 10.5.  When she finds out her number is higher she makes a plan to not sleep with anyone else until she meets ""the one"".  With help from her neighbor Colin (Evans) she tracks down her old loves.  Going in I was actually expecting a lot worse then what I saw.  There were some really funny parts in this, but for me this was way to much of a chick flick to fully enjoy.  I can't be too hard on it though because I am a guy and the movie was not meant for me, but this was hard for me to get through.  On the other hand my girlfriend laughed but also wasn't that impressed.  This is worth a watch though, but after one time that may be enough.  Overall, a chick flick that will be hard for guys to make it through.  I give it a B-.",3,A chick flick that is a struggle for guys to watch.  Funny in parts but way too girlie for me.
