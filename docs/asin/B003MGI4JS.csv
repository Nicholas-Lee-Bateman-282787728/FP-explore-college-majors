1354304,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B003MGI4JS,Compay,"[14, 16]","If you're a fan of heist movies like Heat and Ocean's 11, then 2:22 probably won't impress you.  While the film has its rare moments, as well as a solid cast, it simply lacks any real spark.For this being Phillip Guzman's second film as a director, I have to give him credit for doing a decent job.  There are some great cinematography moments, and a few clever shots that keep things interesting.  Unfortunately, the writing by Guzman and lead actor Mick Rossi is average at best.  Pointless subplots, weak attempts at suspense, and ridiculous coincidences are what kept this movie from being shown in theaters.The marketing for this movie is also questionable.  Val ""Straight to DVD"" Kilmer is prominently featured on the cover, next to a praising review snippet.  Which is confusing given that Kilmer, playing a paranoid jeweler, gets exactly four minutes of screen time in this entire movie.  Gabriel Byrne (Usual Suspects) has a ""blink and you missed him"" role.  No one on the cast stands out, save for Robert Miano, best remembered as Sonny Red from Donnie Brasco.  The most seasoned actor in the film, Miano has more than a few great scene-stealing moments.  I was also surprised by newbie actress Sandy Duarte, one of the most gorgeous women that I've ever seen in film.Bottom line, this is a fairly average heist flick.  The heist team comes off looking like amateurs, and the film lacked any ""edge of your seat"" suspense.  Give this one a rent before you decide to buy the DVD.",3,Good Cast - But an Average Heist Flick,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,1487,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'heist', 'movies', 'Heat', 'Ocean', '11', 'then', '2:22', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'impress', 'film', 'rare', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'solid', 'cast', 'simply', 'real', 'spark.For', 'being', 'Phillip', 'Guzman', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'doing', 'decent', 'job', 'are', 'great', 'cinematography', 'moments', 'few', 'clever', 'shots', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Unfortunately', 'writing', 'Guzman', 'lead', 'actor', 'Mick', 'Rossi', 'average', 'best', 'Pointless', 'subplots', 'weak', 'attempts', 'suspense', 'ridiculous', 'coincidences', 'are', 'what', 'kept', 'movie', 'being', 'shown', 'theaters.The', 'marketing', 'movie', 'also', 'questionable', 'Val', 'Straight', 'DVD', 'Kilmer', 'prominently', 'featured', 'cover', 'next', 'praising', 'review', 'snippet', 'Which', 'confusing', 'given', 'Kilmer', 'playing', 'paranoid', 'jeweler', 'exactly', 'four', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'entire', 'movie', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'blink', 'missed', 'role', 'one', 'cast', 'out', 'save', 'Robert', 'Miano', 'best', 'remembered', 'Sonny', 'Red', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'most', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'film', 'Miano', 'more', 'few', 'great', 'scene-stealing', 'moments', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'newbie', 'actress', 'Sandy', 'Duarte', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'women', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film.Bottom', 'line', 'fairly', 'average', 'heist', 'flick', 'heist', 'team', 'off', 'looking', 'amateurs', 'film', 'lacked', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'Give', 'one', 'rent', 'decide', 'buy', 'DVD']",2:22
1354305,A3MNH75RNHWFKN,B003MGI4JS,Donna Lloyd,"[1, 6]","I finally got a chance to watch the DVD ""2:22"" and was very disappointed, first in the extreme violence I was so disgusted when the jerk hit the dog. I hate violence and even more when it is violence against a animal. Then I was shocked that Val Kilmer was on the screen for only a small part of the DVD. I am a Big Fan of Val Kilmer and bought this DVD without knowing to much about it because it seemed Val was starring in it. They should have listed Val as a cameo.

1354306,A11S2NJBBWJD7L,B003MGI4JS,"G ""Gnostic""","[4, 5]","This is not a great film but it is better than some of the other reviews would suggest.  It was shot on a limited budget but is relatively stylish with good cinematography. Some of the reviewer's negative comments are inane.  Especially egregious is the reviewers comment about hating the movie because one of the characters punched a dog. Seriously -- the character is a violent criminal and he doesn't like dogs. (Of course the dog was not really hurt!  It is a movie.)The real flaws are the heist scene which does drag a bit and the contrived ending.  But despite these limitations, this is a much better and much more realistic movie than films like Heist.  Mick Rossi does a fine job and Robert Miano is a reliable character actor.  I rented the film through Netflix and suggest you rent and not purchase it unless you are an obsessive collector of crime dramas.  I watch movies on a widescreen while rowing using a Concept 2 and riding a spinner so I watch a lot of movies.  Compared to some other films I have watched recently (e.g., Killing Zoe which I did not finish), this film is a small but flawed gem.",4,Decent Movie,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,1114,"['not', 'great', 'film', 'better', 'other', 'reviews', 'would', 'suggest', 'was', 'shot', 'limited', 'budget', 'relatively', 'stylish', 'good', 'cinematography', 'reviewer', 'negative', 'comments', 'are', 'inane', 'Especially', 'egregious', 'reviewers', 'comment', 'hating', 'movie', 'one', 'characters', 'punched', 'dog', 'Seriously', 'character', 'violent', 'criminal', ""n't"", 'like', 'dogs', 'course', 'dog', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'hurt', 'movie', 'real', 'flaws', 'are', 'heist', 'scene', 'drag', 'bit', 'contrived', 'ending', 'limitations', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'movie', 'films', 'Heist', 'Mick', 'Rossi', 'fine', 'job', 'Robert', 'Miano', 'reliable', 'character', 'actor', 'rented', 'film', 'Netflix', 'suggest', 'rent', 'not', 'purchase', 'are', 'obsessive', 'collector', 'crime', 'dramas', 'watch', 'movies', 'widescreen', 'rowing', 'using', 'Concept', '2', 'riding', 'spinner', 'so', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'Compared', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'recently', 'e.g.', 'Killing', 'Zoe', 'did', 'not', 'finish', 'film', 'small', 'flawed', 'gem']",2:22
