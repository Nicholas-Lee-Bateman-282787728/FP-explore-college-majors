Since there aren't many concert footage out there this DVD is a must for every Triumph fan. Somewhat I like this one better than the ""US Concert"", don't mind the editing, the sound is great and the footage is well...an 80's concert which seem with today's standards is ""cheesy"" but back then was excellent. I think you need to judge a concert by it's meaning when it was originally played not by today's standard, so don't mind those critics who tell you about the clothes or the hair...Triumph is all about rock n' roll and this DVD delivers.The extras are okay too. You won't be dissapointed.",4,It's a great DVD simply because the band is awesome,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,679,"['Triumph', 'was', 'one', 'bands', 'were', 'so', 'underrated', 'had', 'lot', 'talent', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'concert', 'footage', 'there', 'DVD', 'must', 'Triumph', 'fan', 'Somewhat', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'US', 'Concert', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'editing', 'sound', 'great', 'footage', 'well', '80', 'concert', 'seem', 'today', 'standards', 'cheesy', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'excellent', 'think', 'need', 'judge', 'concert', 'meaning', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'played', 'not', 'today', 'standard', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'critics', 'who', 'tell', 'clothes', 'hair', 'Triumph', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'DVD', 'delivers.The', 'extras', 'are', 'okay', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",N/A

Our seats were midway toward the back of the arena so we were able to appreciate their famous light show.  Choice of songs seemed OK at the time, should have added some, should have omitted others but overall a decent concert.  I saw this DVD and thought that I would take a chance.  Flash back to '86, give or take a year when Triumph had already peaked and were coming down in the US, not sure about Canada where this was filmed.  Their choice of clothes were awful, even for back then. What were they doing, picking out clothes in the dark?  The only guy who looks good is the hired keyboardist/guitarist for the tour.  Again, not the greatest song list either.  Why do ""Rocky Mountain Way"" over one of their own?  There has never been a question whether Rik Emmett can play his guitar, but he just looks so uninspired as well as the rest of the band.  Are they playing to the cameras or to the crowd.  The closeups of them onstage look fake, like filming this on the stage alone during soundcheck, then adding the audience shots later.  Gil Moore doesn't seem to break a sweat or is excited to be playing live. Mike Levine's in between song banter is just so cliched.  Emmett's guitar facial expressions seem so rehearsed and fake, never getting near the audience.  The sound here is good but the video portion of this band in concert is just hard to enjoy while watching.  Great video quality, just not a very enthused TRIUMPH up on the stage.  I recommend this for the true TRIUMPH fanatic but anyone with just a casual interest, get the US festival show instead.  I know that one was a real concert.  I am not sure about this one.",3,Brings back memories of the band live..........or were they?,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1749,"['saw', 'Triumph', 'live', 'Thunder', 'Seven', 'tour', 'thought', 'musicianship', 'showmanship', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'seats', 'were', 'midway', 'back', 'arena', 'were', 'able', 'appreciate', 'famous', 'light', 'show', 'Choice', 'songs', 'seemed', 'OK', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'should', 'have', 'omitted', 'others', 'decent', 'concert', 'saw', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'chance', 'Flash', 'back', ""'86"", 'give', 'take', 'year', 'when', 'Triumph', 'had', 'already', 'peaked', 'were', 'coming', 'down', 'US', 'not', 'sure', 'Canada', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'choice', 'clothes', 'were', 'awful', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'What', 'were', 'doing', 'picking', 'out', 'clothes', 'dark', 'only', 'guy', 'who', 'good', 'hired', 'keyboardist/guitarist', 'tour', 'Again', 'not', 'greatest', 'song', 'list', 'Why', 'do', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'Way', 'one', 'own', 'never', 'been', 'question', 'Rik', 'Emmett', 'can', 'play', 'guitar', 'just', 'so', 'uninspired', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'band', 'Are', 'playing', 'cameras', 'crowd', 'closeups', 'onstage', 'look', 'fake', 'filming', 'stage', 'alone', 'soundcheck', 'then', 'adding', 'audience', 'shots', 'later', 'Gil', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'sweat', 'excited', 'be', 'playing', 'live', 'Mike', 'Levine', 'song', 'banter', 'just', 'so', 'cliched', 'Emmett', 'guitar', 'facial', 'expressions', 'seem', 'so', 'rehearsed', 'fake', 'never', 'getting', 'audience', 'sound', 'here', 'good', 'video', 'portion', 'band', 'concert', 'just', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Great', 'video', 'quality', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'enthused', 'TRIUMPH', 'up', 'stage', 'recommend', 'true', 'TRIUMPH', 'fanatic', 'anyone', 'just', 'casual', 'interest', 'get', 'US', 'festival', 'show', 'instead', 'know', 'one', 'was', 'real', 'concert', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'one']",N/A

Canada not only provided us with the Masters Of Prog Rock RUSH, but they are also at the fore of bringing us the music of Triumph.  This amazing three-piece group ended their career far too early if you ask me.  There was never a farewell or retirement tour of any kind.  Such things were not as common place as they are today.  One day they were very simply gone.  The music of Triumph leaned more to the hard rock/metal side at times more so than that of progressive bands.  The songs were almost always very easy to appreciate and they did get a sufficient amount of airplay as in their heyday. I remembered that  classic rock stations would play more of this type of music than one would expect to hear today.  This DVD entitled ""A Night Of Triumph"" showcases one of the bands last albums in performance before their seemed retirement.  That album and tour was for the ""Sport Of Kings"" record.I will admit there is not much more to see during this than the concert itself, but this is still good considering the limited amount of this sort of product from the group.  Besides this DVD, I only know of one more piece entitled ""Live At The US Festival"".  This was released in 2003.  It does however give you a great concert, for they were such a great band live.  I was lucky enough to see them during the biggest tours they had with ""Thunder Seven"" and ""Sport Of Kings"".There were one or two minor critiques I had about the piece.  This was the album were Triumph employed the use of keyboards in their music quite a bit.  It was an odd thing for their core audience as this led to  less gritty and more commercial sounding material.  It does include all of the bands hits and among them are some of the fan favorites to this day.  Standout tracks are such as ""Follow Your Heart"", ""Fight The Good Fight"", and ""Magic Power"" and many more.Does the closeness of these two DVDs and the back catalog remastering signify a return of Triumph to the stage?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Thusfar I have not heard anything of the sort and with Rik Emmett who seems to be content with all of his solo efforts it does not seem likely.  Should I ever reach Gil, Rik or Mike I shall certainly let you know.  This is a perfect way to sit and enjoy a truly excellent group so grab yourself a copy.",4,A Triumphant DVD For The Ardent Fan,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2324,"['event', 'never', 'realized', 'Canada', 'not', 'only', 'provided', 'Masters', 'Prog', 'Rock', 'RUSH', 'are', 'also', 'fore', 'bringing', 'music', 'Triumph', 'amazing', 'three-piece', 'group', 'ended', 'career', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'ask', 'was', 'never', 'farewell', 'retirement', 'tour', 'kind', 'Such', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'common', 'place', 'are', 'today', 'One', 'day', 'were', 'very', 'simply', 'gone', 'music', 'Triumph', 'leaned', 'more', 'hard', 'rock/metal', 'side', 'times', 'more', 'so', 'progressive', 'bands', 'songs', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'very', 'easy', 'appreciate', 'did', 'get', 'sufficient', 'amount', 'airplay', 'heyday', 'remembered', 'classic', 'rock', 'stations', 'would', 'play', 'more', 'type', 'music', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'hear', 'today', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'A', 'Night', 'Triumph', 'one', 'bands', 'last', 'albums', 'performance', 'seemed', 'retirement', 'album', 'tour', 'was', 'Sport', 'Kings', 'record.I', 'will', 'admit', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'see', 'concert', 'still', 'good', 'considering', 'limited', 'amount', 'sort', 'product', 'group', 'DVD', 'only', 'know', 'one', 'more', 'piece', 'entitled', 'Live', 'US', 'Festival', 'was', 'released', '2003', 'however', 'give', 'great', 'concert', 'were', 'great', 'band', 'live', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'biggest', 'tours', 'had', 'Thunder', 'Seven', 'Sport', 'Kings', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'minor', 'critiques', 'had', 'piece', 'was', 'album', 'were', 'Triumph', 'employed', 'use', 'keyboards', 'music', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'odd', 'thing', 'core', 'audience', 'led', 'less', 'gritty', 'more', 'commercial', 'sounding', 'material', 'include', 'bands', 'hits', 'are', 'fan', 'day', 'Standout', 'tracks', 'are', 'such', 'Heart', 'Fight', 'Good', 'Fight', 'Magic', 'Power', 'many', 'more.Does', 'closeness', 'two', 'DVDs', 'back', 'catalog', 'remastering', 'signify', 'return', 'Triumph', 'stage', 'guess', 'as', 'good', 'mine', 'Thusfar', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'anything', 'sort', 'Rik', 'Emmett', 'who', 'be', 'content', 'solo', 'efforts', 'not', 'seem', 'likely', 'Should', 'ever', 'reach', 'Gil', 'Rik', 'Mike', 'shall', 'certainly', 'let', 'know', 'perfect', 'way', 'sit', 'enjoy', 'truly', 'excellent', 'group', 'so', 'copy']",N/A

Yes, I grew up in the 80's and yes, I still made fun of the mullets and bad wardrobes.  BUT, thats how most of those bands were at the time and when I bought this DVD I did see how things are outdated.  However,  the sound quality is excellent and Im sure all of you would agree that record companies should convert many more of the old VHS and even unreleased shows to DVD.  I would rather have a large selection of DVD's to compare than to have only the newer bands release shows.

I remember seeing this very tour something like three months prior to this gig. One thing I'll always miss from the '80's is seeing a live Triumph show every other year or so. Let's face it, this Canadian trio has never been anything less than an all-out incredible rock & roll show, specially when experienced live. The tour this show comes from was on the road to support their 'The Sport Of Kings' album. Every track from this eighty-two minute concert shines, but the songs that stick in the back of my mind are ""Allied Forces"", their signature tune ""Lay It On The Line"", ""Take A Stand"", their anthem-like ""Rock N' Roll Machine"", Joe Walsh's cover ""Rocky Mountain Way"" and ""Fight The Good Fight"". Plus there are two videos I remember seeing on Mtv or some cable music show. The band, at least on THIS tour had four musicians. Rik Emmett - guitar & vocals, Mike Levine - bass & vocals, Gil Moore - drums & vocals along with new touring recruit, guitarist Rick Santer. Sure wish Triumph would reunite. Come on,guys.
