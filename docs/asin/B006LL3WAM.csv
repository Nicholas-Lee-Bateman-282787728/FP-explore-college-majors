I admit, some scenes are amusing, but mostly, it's the scenes where Al Pacino goes out of his way to make fun of himself.About the only thing that this movie has going for it is Pacino's turn as himself. Pacino is a great sport for agreeing to do this movie. I guess he feels like he should since everyone else seems to be doing comedies - Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman have certainly done well for themselves with comedies lately.Sandler's latest flick isn't as bad as some of the terrible stuff he's released in the past several years, but only because his work has been abominable in the last decade. Everything since beforeClick (Special Edition)particularly the unbearableYou Don't Mess With the Zohan (Unrated Extended Single-Disc Edition)has been hard to watch.

The most recent condemnation came when the Adam Sandler vehicle racked up a whopping 12 Razzie nominations, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that there are only 10 categories. Directed by Dennis Dugan, who has inexplicably cobbled together a career out of several terrible films, Jack and Jill is a screwball comedy about an advertising exec who receives an annual visit from his twin sister, who happens to drive him crazy. Despite an amusing extended cameo by Al Pacino -- playing himself -- Jack and Jill failed to impress me.

Who wants to see Sandler channel his 'inner-Tootsie' for cheap laughs."" The movie proved my right, tanking at the box office and then earning several Razzie awards as the worst movie of 2011. JACK AND JILL, where Sandler plays an ad exec Jack Sadelstien, and Jack's twin sister Jill is exactly the type of movie Sandler made fun of in Judd Apatow's FUNNY PEOPLE.One day, I realized there could be worse movies that I could watch. Sure, I knew it would be stupid, but I also knew that Sandler has delivered the laughs consistently through the years. So my family and I watched it. We laughed out loud many times, especially my fourth grader at the innocent fart jokes.So, I can honestly agree this movie deserves the one star reviews and the Razzie, but it also deserves respect for being a movie the entire family can watch. It has a good message, no sex, violence or bad language, and plenty of cameos. I enjoyed looking out for the Sandler buddies like Allen Covert, Tim Meadows, Norm McDonald, David Spade, Dana Carvey, and Peter Dante. There are also many celebs that play themselves and add to the enjoyment of the movie. There are several slow parts, especially when Jill and Al Pacino share screen time, but the movie moves briskly enough.Look, this is far cry from Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison, but this is a safe family movie that made us all laugh, and sometimes that's all you should really judge a movie by.",5,"I agree this movie is bad, but it is also hilarious, and a good family movie",1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,1555,"['When', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'immediately', 'thought', 'dumbest', 'movie', 'ever', 'even', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'Who', 'see', 'Sandler', 'channel', ""'inner-Tootsie"", 'cheap', 'laughs', 'movie', 'proved', 'right', 'tanking', 'box', 'office', 'then', 'earning', 'several', 'Razzie', 'awards', 'worst', 'movie', '2011', 'JACK', 'AND', 'JILL', 'where', 'Sandler', 'ad', 'exec', 'Jack', 'Sadelstien', 'Jack', 'twin', 'sister', 'Jill', 'exactly', 'type', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'made', 'fun', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'FUNNY', 'PEOPLE.One', 'day', 'realized', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', 'Sure', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'also', 'knew', 'Sandler', 'delivered', 'laughs', 'consistently', 'years', 'family', 'watched', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times', 'especially', 'fourth', 'grader', 'innocent', 'fart', 'jokes.So', 'can', 'honestly', 'agree', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'Razzie', 'also', 'respect', 'being', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'good', 'message', 'sex', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'plenty', 'cameos', 'enjoyed', 'looking', 'out', 'Sandler', 'buddies', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Norm', 'McDonald', 'David', 'Spade', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'Peter', 'Dante', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'celebs', 'play', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'slow', 'parts', 'especially', 'when', 'Jill', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'share', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'briskly', 'enough.Look', 'far', 'cry', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'safe', 'family', 'movie', 'made', 'laugh', 'should', 'really', 'judge', 'movie']",N/A

That is the case with this great comedic film, and the fact that most of the nimrods in the world don't get the humor and can't appreciate it makes the film all the more funny. Scottyboy gets it, and my copycat stalker, who has taken my name and image and follows me around Amazon, doesn't get it. Copycat stalker doesn't have the intellectual capacity to get this movie. He doesn't have an original thought in his head (see his copycat profile for example).I spent a weekend with Scottyboy recently and we had an Adam Sandler film fest, and it was glorious. Sure, we took breaks to have tickle fights, use vegetables in creative ways, and manscape, but the real payoff was reveling in the comedic genius of Adam Sandler, both in and out of drag, and then spending hours dissecting this comic masterpiece. I can tell you that Scottyboy is the Alistair Cooke of comedic movie reviewers. His insights into this film were priceless, and will stay with me forever---as well as my memories of him running around the house in his pink banana hammock. As for my would be doppelganger stalker, who will no doubt comment on this after being bludgeoned by the intellectually superior Tboy, its sad that the breadth and depth of his brain power is limited to one review of a fart machine and trying desperately to play catch-up to my vast intellect (a losing battle from the get go)---but that pretty much sums up one who has the brain the size of a chickpea.

I saw the trailer for this movie in the theater some months back when going to see The Help and thought it looked funny.  Guess what?  The trailer was the best part.  I bought it yesterday, knowing full well that an Adam Sandler movie is a weighty gamble, and now I want to run my copy over with a trailer.There are a few good laughs, I'll grant you that, but Adam Sandler's female role as his character Jack's sister Jill was completely over the top in every sense of the expression.  True, you can expect gross jokes from Sandler about body (mal)functions, but the idea of a woman being so disgusting as to leave an imprint in her bed (and the bird) made me want to vomit.  The funniest part of the movie was when Jack's adopted son pointed out to him that he and Jill were so much alike, he denied it, and then they did practically mirror image movements while watching a movie.  Unfortunately, we've seen this before in old I Love Lucy and Abbot and Costello reruns.  In fact, we've seen everything here except the disappointing surprise of Al Pacino stooping to playing a rather large role in this fiasco.  I will never look at him the same when I watch Sea of Love, Needle Park, etc., and that's the worst part.  Why, Al?  Seriously, WHY?

I watched this because of curiosity to see Al Pacino's role, and I was horribly surprised to see an actor of such a great caliber to go so low and take part in this awful project.  I guess Pacino owed Sandler some kind of favor in order to accept and participate in such a piece of trash movie.  Bad bad bad.  The part that hurts the most is seeing Mexican great Eugenio Derbez negatively represent his own people here.  Derbez is one of the top rated comedy geniuses in Mexico; he does both acting and producing his own shows and successfully produces other high quality comedy shows as well.  Derbez has an endless portfolio of high quality TV shows, and movies under his belt.  But well, his star didn't shine this time.  Is hard to believe how being so big and suceessful he went even lower than Pacino and chose this project as a crossover for the English speaking audiences.

With that being said I am not going to make any execuses that this is most likely the low point of Adam's movie Career (At least in which he starred in, For just producing a movie that goes to Bucky Larson) but in the end what actually saves this movie is Adam Sandler's on screen comic insanity that will still get you a laugh even if the material that is based off of should have never seen the light of Day.Anyways, the plot of this gem (yes there is a plot, even if it a very vague one) is about a self made obnoxious advertising executive named Jack (Adam Sandler) who always dreads the holidays due to his even more obnoxious twin sister Jill (Played also by Adam Sandler) making her yearly visit from New York (It could be New Jersey, all I know it's somewhere on the east coast) who decides to extend her vist from Thanks giving, through Hanukah , and even further until after New Year. While Jack is trying to conteplate how to deal with getting Jill to leave his home before she destroys Jack's family life he most also find away to get his biggest client (Dunkin Donughts) from not going to another advertising firm by trying to hire Al Pacino (Yes, the Godfather Al Pacino)to do a comercial for them. The real kicker (Hold your stomach for this one) is that Al Pacino (Who is playing Al Pacino)has fallen head over heels for Jack's sister Jill.This also has Cameo's by Johnny Depp (Playing Johnny Depp), Regis Phelbinn (Playing Regis Phelbinn), and of course the rest of Adam Sandler's dead beat entourage  (David Spade, Nick Swardson, and so on) who have various small parts of the movie in order to recieve thier meal tickets.While the movie clearly try's to get you to hold endearmeant to what is meant to be a brother and sister reconciling there past differences you only get the guilty pleasure of seeing Adam Sandler viciously toturing himself/herself and at the end you clearly are laughing at parts that you were not meant to.So in conclusion is only buy this movie if you are a true fan of Adam Sandler and enjoy guilty pleasures like I do, enjoy at your own risk!",4,Jack and Jill - Only a Movie that a stead fast Adam Sandler Fan will love,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2254,"['Please', 'Be', 'warned', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'stead', 'fast', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Fans', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'movie', 'wide', 'berth', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'execuses', 'most', 'likely', 'low', 'point', 'Adam', 'movie', 'Career', 'least', 'starred', 'just', 'producing', 'movie', 'Bucky', 'Larson', 'end', 'what', 'actually', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'screen', 'comic', 'insanity', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'laugh', 'even', 'material', 'based', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'Day.Anyways', 'plot', 'gem', 'yes', 'plot', 'even', 'very', 'vague', 'one', 'self', 'made', 'obnoxious', 'advertising', 'executive', 'named', 'Jack', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'always', 'holidays', 'due', 'even', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'twin', 'sister', 'Jill', 'Played', 'also', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'making', 'yearly', 'visit', 'New', 'York', 'could', 'be', 'New', 'Jersey', 'know', 'somewhere', 'east', 'coast', 'who', 'extend', 'vist', 'Thanks', 'giving', 'Hanukah', 'even', 'further', 'New', 'Year', 'Jack', 'trying', 'conteplate', 'how', 'deal', 'getting', 'Jill', 'leave', 'home', 'Jack', 'family', 'life', 'most', 'also', 'find', 'away', 'get', 'biggest', 'client', 'Dunkin', 'Donughts', 'not', 'going', 'advertising', 'firm', 'trying', 'hire', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Yes', 'Godfather', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'do', 'comercial', 'real', 'kicker', 'Hold', 'stomach', 'one', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Who', 'playing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'fallen', 'head', 'heels', 'Jack', 'sister', 'Jill.This', 'also', 'Cameo', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Playing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Regis', 'Phelbinn', 'Playing', 'Regis', 'Phelbinn', 'course', 'rest', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'dead', 'beat', 'entourage', 'David', 'Spade', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'so', 'who', 'have', 'various', 'small', 'parts', 'movie', 'order', 'recieve', 'thier', 'meal', 'movie', 'clearly', 'try', 'get', 'hold', 'endearmeant', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'brother', 'sister', 'reconciling', 'there', 'past', 'differences', 'only', 'get', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'viciously', 'toturing', 'end', 'clearly', 'are', 'laughing', 'parts', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'to.So', 'conclusion', 'only', 'buy', 'movie', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'enjoy', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'do', 'enjoy', 'own', 'risk']",N/A

But Mrs. Doubtfire this is not.So after Adam Sandler won the most Razzies (bad movie Oscars) in history, I thought I'd give this movie a try. Adam Sandler plays what seems to be every role he plays and that's a mildly angry family man that works at a marketing company with big clients like Dunkin Doughnuts. Adam Sandler has a twin sister played by Adam Sandler himself. She's a big oafish woman with a very annoying voice that works on your nerves. Her job is to be the most annoying person as possible. Personally, if they put someone less annoying who wasn't Adam Sandler, fans would have enjoyed it more.The cast is full of quirky characters like Jack's adopted son from India that tapes things to himself including bread and birds. Jack's gardener with a family named Juan. Jack's karate daughter and bum cousin. Katie Holmes plays the normal person in this movie. Then there is Al Pachino who plays Al Pachino and quickly falls in love with Jill and Jack needs Al to be in the new Dunkin Doughnuts commercial. Al will only agree to it if he gets Jill. That results in Jack having to put up with his sister staying with him and even Jack pretending to be Jill at some point.If you like cameos, this movie is full of them. David Spade, Tim Meadows, Norm McDonnald plays Jill's blind date and even Jared from Subway. There are just as many product placements in the movie as well. From Pepto Bismal to United Airlines. It makes me wonder if I wasn't saying 'hey its that guy,' would I have enjoyed it less?To be honest this movie does have laughs and moments of hilarity, yet because of Jill being such an over the top annoyance and being played by Adam Sandler, this movie will go down as one of the worst movies of all time.

Easily, in Jack and Jill, Sandler plays twins and dresses in drag to play the sister Jill. While Katie Holmes plays Jack's wife Erin who gets to be on the list of pretty actresses in one dimensional roles as Sandler's wife who are just there to act like he's a great husband and father when he always plays a jerk and bad example.Sandler must be the nicest guy in person though, because he got the great Jack Nicholson to work with him and now got not only Johnny Depp to make an appearance as himself but Al Pacino as well. Pacino probably only read the parts of the script with him in them and thought this is great stuff because his scenes are the only ones that work and that are funny. He plays himself and we're supposed to believe that he's obsessed with Jill. Jack loves that since he films commercials and wants Pacino in one and wants to be on his good side.Sandler shows some talent as Jill but the movie resorts to the same sort of jokes you can expect from a Happy Madison film and this one is PG for some reason but what jokes are aimed for kids ?

Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down.I remember my first movie featuring Adam Sandler was Billy Madison. That is a classic in the world of comedy, but recently Sandler has taken a turn for the morbid, masochist side of humanity or comedy whichever some of his mess of his films are now. He seems to take pleasure in exploiting people that are weak or dimwitted and make them do stupid things. I get the whole drag thing,, He had to do one movie where he was in drag eventually, but the whole movie is just one dark, sad, and just plain unfunny movie mainly because of Sandler's absolutely no skill in writing now. I mean he used to have decent comedic chops, but now it just seems he takes a film role just for the money.Like I said, his previous films he just has characters that are so pathetic that the other characters need to exploit them for the comedic value. I mean, I understand now why he had to play both parts himself, because maybe, just maybe any actress that picked up the script and read it found it to be damaging and just plain sad because Jill is just this scapegoat for all the lack of humor. Every line, every situation is to poke fun at her, it seems there is no letting up on her. I mean there are practically no other jokes except about her/him/her or whatever. I just found myself sitting there, going ""why did I watch this when I could've watched something better or done something more productive?"" It's not even a fun movie, yet there is numerous groan inducing slapstick moments that almost just made me turn the movie off. I mean anyone remember the movie Funny People? Well all those fake movies Aptow that he made up for Sandler are coming true.  I mean that's just it, Sandler is not doing drama anymore, he's just doing these terrible headache inducing comedies that most people in this country or in the world expect him to do.  I liked him in his dramatic roles, but yet he doesn't do them anymore because he has no credibility as a actor. He is just a one-note mess in every movie now. It's not Sandler playing a character. It's a character playing Sandler.  Hey, he has all the money, a hot girl, and gets to work with some big stars so that must get him credibility because in Hollywood, Money = Power.If you enjoy the past tense Adam, then don't watch this, but if you do enjoy this kind of movie, just go see it.

Plenty of laugh out loud moments and hilarious one-liners. Plus, Sandler's crew make cameos throughout, which is always fun to watch. Is Sandler pushing the envelope as a woman? Sure, that is the point. Very Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire-esque. Not ""painful"" to watch (as some have noted), especially if you know people with ""unfortunate"" looking siblings.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 4]","Created in 1980 as the anti-Oscars, the Golden Raspberry Awards (the RAZZIES) may not have the same high profile as their illustrious counterpart but they sure are a lot more fun. Honoring the worst of the worst, this tongue-in-cheek ceremony not only eviscerates truly bad movies, it boldly challenges convention. It has become more entrenched in recent years with lucky recipients actually attending to receive their dubious accolades. Notoriously Sandra Bullock and Halle Berry attended to pick up Worst Actress awards, Bullock (for All About Steve) even in the same year she won an Oscar for The Blind Side. In 2011, Adam Sandler's ""Jack and Jill"" broke RAZZIE history with an impressive 11 nominations.Few will argue that ""Jack and Jill"" is a good movie. At best, it's defenders will say ""But it's Adam Sandler, what did you expect?"" A fair point, but I think that sells both themselves and Sandler short with a pass for lowered expectations. Sandler is talented and can make good movies, but some seem content to allow idiocy to pass for entertainment. That's fine. I like dumb as much as the next guy, but only at home for free--not paying premium movie prices or purchasing a DVD. There is a big difference.Either way, ""Jack and Jill"" is a preposterously inept film that marks a real low point in the career of Al Pacino (poor Pacino is besotted with a female Sandler). Sandler plays twin siblings, a male and a female, and the sight of Sandler in drag is presumably all the effort anyone made to provide actual comedy. Isn't the very idea hysterical? Not so much. But I do credit Sandler and ""Jack and Jill"" for achieving film history. He is the only actor in history to be nominated for Worst Actor and Worst Actress in the same year. Here's a complete rundown of the picture's record breaking nominations (most of which it has odds on winning):Worst PictureWorst Actor: Adam SandlerWorst Actress: Adam Sandler (yes, actress)Worst Supporting Actor: Al PacinoWorst Supporting Actor: Nick Swardson (shared with Just Go For It, so I didn't count it a full nomination)Worst Supporting Actress: Katie HolmesWorst Supporting Actress: David Spade (yes, actress)Worst DirectorWorst ScreenplayWorst Remake/Rip-off/SequelWorst EnsembleWorst Couple (Sandler and Sandler, Sandler and Pacino, and/or Sandler and Holmes)Is ""Jack and Jill"" worth seeing? That's up to you. Is it worth paying for? That's really the question. My advice: if you absolutely have to see this, wait until you can catch it for free. If we keep buying these DVDs then they'll just keep making movies of the same caliber.

(There are many hilarious nods to Scarface and The Godfather trilogy) If Jill doesn't date Al, then he won't do business with Jack, but he soon realizes that family is forever.

For one, we all know 'Jill' is Sandler in drag, but the fact his jack character goes drag as Jill in the movie undercuts the believability of the thing. Secondly, a couple of the jokes are of bad taste, or inappropriate. I appreciate the fact that Sandler likes to stand up for freedom of speech or push boundaries or whatever, but bad taste is bad taste.

Worthley ""trworthley""","[6, 10]","When I saw the first trailer for Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill movie I thought to myself, ""Oh no, they're not seriously going this low, are they?"" It just seemed to be a ridiculous concept. Well, I was right, but I was also wrong. I thought nobody would want to see this film, but working at a movie theater, I saw this film get quite a lot of business. People flocked to it, and there were a lot of other decent movies out the time to compete with it. I brought my oldest daughter to watch it ourselves. It was ridiculous, but we both liked it. My daughter actually loved it. This kind of ridiculous humor fits the audience of pre-teens that might be drawn to it. No, this isn't Sandler's best work (though typical to his traditional style), but if you put your criticism aside and allow yourself to just be entertained, it does do the job. I think that's why it made far more money than anyone expected. I don't think anybody saw an advertisement of this film and thought that this was going to be a masterpiece. Sometimes when we view a movie with our expectations too high, we are very easily let down. I think many reviewers lose sight of that. Nobody should have had high expectations for this, so why judge it so harshly?",4,"Jack and Jill, what can one say?",1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1227,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'movie', 'thought', 'myself', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'not', 'seriously', 'going', 'low', 'are', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'concept', 'Well', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'also', 'wrong', 'thought', 'nobody', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'working', 'movie', 'theater', 'saw', 'film', 'get', 'quite', 'lot', 'business', 'People', 'flocked', 'were', 'lot', 'other', 'decent', 'movies', 'time', 'compete', 'brought', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'watch', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'liked', 'daughter', 'actually', 'loved', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'humor', 'audience', 'pre-teens', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'No', ""n't"", 'Sandler', 'best', 'work', 'typical', 'traditional', 'style', 'put', 'criticism', 'aside', 'allow', 'just', 'be', 'entertained', 'do', 'job', 'think', 'why', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'money', 'anyone', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'saw', 'advertisement', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'view', 'movie', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'are', 'very', 'easily', 'let', 'down', 'think', 'many', 'reviewers', 'lose', 'sight', 'Nobody', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'so', 'why', 'judge', 'so', 'harshly']",N/A
1517156,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B006LL3WAM,Tony Heck,"[6, 11]","""I love my sister, and I can keep my cool. It's just for four days."" When Jill (Sandler) comes to visit her twin brother Jack (Sandler) for Thanksgiving he isn't happy. When days turn to weeks he gets more and more upset. After he finds out that his job is in jeopardy and they need Al Pacino to appear in a commercial for them Jack's only chance is for Jill to stay. I have liked almost all of Sandler's movies and I think he gets a bad rap for some of the things he does (much like Eddie Murphy), but I'm sorry Sandler...I can't back you up on this one. This one is almost as bad as what you have heard about it. There are a few parts that made me laugh, but when the best part is a little kid taping animals to his back that shows you what kind of movie this is. On a side note Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time, but the last scene with him made me cringe...watch it and you will see what I mean. The only reason I kept watching was because of Pacino, but that scene almost made me regret it. Overall, a movie I can't really recommend...""Just Go With It"" was much, much better. I give it a C-. It's only that high really because Pacino used a line from the ""Godfather"".",2,I am a huge Sandler fan. I think he gets a bad rap. I think he's funny in almost everything. THIS MOVIE SUCKED!

1517157,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B006LL3WAM,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 11]","Adam Sandler plays dual roles in ""Jack and Jill,"" as twins Jack Sadelstein / Jill Sadelstein. Jack is a successful commercial producer living in LA, happily married to Erin (Katie Holmes). But now he is not a very happy man as his twin sister Jill (Sandler wearing a wig and women's clothes) is paying his family a visit for the Thanksgiving holiday. And Jill is very, very annoying.In the meanwhile, Jack wants Al Pacino to be in the TV commercial for Dunkin' Donuts, but knows there is little chance that the Oscar winning star would accept the offer. But things start to seem better when, believe me or not, Al Pacino - playing a knowingly (I hope) exaggerated version of himself - fell for Jill.It is not the film's non-existent story or countless stupid jokes that I find annoying. I like stupid jokes, but when they are done by someone like Jill, an irritating and obnoxious character, her antics are unfunny, even unpleasant. Yes, I know, as it turns out, Jill is really a woman with a kind heart, and Erin and kids like her, but Sandler's one-note performance doesn't just convince.The only thing I find mildly amusing is Al Pacino playing himself, though it is obvious that comedy is not his forte. His energetic acting in the ""Dunkaccino"" part will either entertain you or make you sigh.Directed by Dennis Dugan, ""Jack and Jill"" is yet another Adam Sandler-Dennis Dugan collaboration that started with ""Happy Gilmore"" back in 1996. There are lots of cameos - Johnny Depp and John McEnroe among others - but all those amusing cameos are not just enough to make us forget the fact that this is arguably the worst of their films.",2,Jack and Obnoxious Jill,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1636,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'dual', 'roles', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'twins', 'Jack', 'Sadelstein', '/', 'Jill', 'Sadelstein', 'Jack', 'successful', 'commercial', 'producer', 'living', 'LA', 'happily', 'married', 'Erin', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'now', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'man', 'twin', 'sister', 'Jill', 'Sandler', 'wearing', 'wig', 'women', 'clothes', 'paying', 'family', 'visit', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'Jill', 'very', 'very', 'meanwhile', 'Jack', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'be', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Dunkin', 'Donuts', 'little', 'chance', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'star', 'would', 'accept', 'offer', 'things', 'start', 'seem', 'better', 'when', 'believe', 'not', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'playing', 'knowingly', 'hope', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'fell', 'Jill.It', 'not', 'film', 'non-existent', 'story', 'countless', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'find', 'annoying', 'like', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'someone', 'Jill', 'irritating', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'antics', 'are', 'unfunny', 'even', 'unpleasant', 'Yes', 'know', 'out', 'Jill', 'really', 'woman', 'kind', 'heart', 'Erin', 'kids', 'Sandler', 'one-note', 'performance', ""n't"", 'just', 'convince.The', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'playing', 'obvious', 'comedy', 'not', 'forte', 'energetic', 'acting', 'Dunkaccino', 'part', 'will', 'either', 'entertain', 'make', 'sigh.Directed', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'yet', 'Adam', 'Sandler-Dennis', 'Dugan', 'collaboration', 'started', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'back', '1996', 'are', 'lots', 'cameos', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'others', 'amusing', 'cameos', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'fact', 'arguably', 'worst', 'films']",N/A
