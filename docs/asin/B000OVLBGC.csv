Besides a poignant drama that puts a face on human misery, the film shows just what those days were like before Gorbachev created the thaw in Eastern Europe.  The movie centers around Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright who wrote benign, but heartfelt shows that didn't cast must suspicion upon him from the Stasi, a government surveillance organization keen on bugging the dwelling places of artists and other suspicious people.  Being prudent and thorough, mole Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) bugs Dreyman's apartment and spends all his working hours listening to every moment, mundane or intimate, inside the writer's life.  Splitting a shift with a colleague, we get an eerie sense--especially with the chilling, understated music--of what life was like, coming into fruition as closely as possible to Orwell's '1984'.  (Significantly, the vast majority of the movie reinacts the events of that very year.)  Besides a lover (Martina Gedeck), Dreyman keeps close company with elder playwright, Albert Jerska, who spars with despair after being blacklisted for outspoken writing.  Tip-toeing throughout, there is an unnerving atmosphere that surrounds the relationships and any brazen initiatives to foster the truth.I was hypnotized by the movie, but also impressed with its import.  It's not only a story about Dreyman, but it shows Wiesler's shallow existence as a government spy.  In one scene, Wiesler goes to a bar and tries to use a pick-up line that he heard Dreyman use with his girlfriend.  The actors also convey well the fear and resignation of pre-glasnost Eastern Germany.  In one particularly memorable scene, a young colleague at the Stasi comes to the cafeteria telling his friends a joke about the Party Chairman.  Little does he realize that his superiors are sitting just within earshot.  How he nervously finishes his joke showcases a marvelously revealing performance.  Indeed, one of the great observations of the movie is how it zeroes in on those unguarded foot-in-mouth occasions that put decent citizens in great peril.  From beginning to end, `The Lives of Others' really connects the dots between present and past in an illuminating way.  The movie is a testament to the triumph of the arts over the human spirit.  (While I rooted for 'Pan's Labyrinth' to win best Foreign Picture Oscar, there can hardly be too much of a grudge after seeing the winner.)",5,Thaw Factor,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2526,"['Watching', 'Lives', 'Others', 'was', 'reminded', 'so', 'many', 'periodical', 'articles', 'told', 'oppressive', 'existence', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'poignant', 'drama', 'face', 'human', 'misery', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'days', 'were', 'Gorbachev', 'created', 'thaw', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'movie', 'centers', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'playwright', 'who', 'wrote', 'benign', 'heartfelt', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'must', 'suspicion', 'Stasi', 'government', 'surveillance', 'organization', 'keen', 'bugging', 'dwelling', 'places', 'artists', 'other', 'suspicious', 'people', 'Being', 'prudent', 'thorough', 'mole', 'Wiesler', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'bugs', 'Dreyman', 'apartment', 'working', 'hours', 'listening', 'moment', 'mundane', 'intimate', 'writer', 'life', 'Splitting', 'shift', 'colleague', 'get', 'eerie', 'sense', 'especially', 'chilling', 'understated', 'music', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'coming', 'fruition', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'Orwell', ""'1984"", 'Significantly', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'events', 'very', 'year', 'lover', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'Dreyman', 'close', 'company', 'elder', 'playwright', 'Albert', 'Jerska', 'who', 'despair', 'being', 'blacklisted', 'outspoken', 'writing', 'Tip-toeing', 'unnerving', 'atmosphere', 'relationships', 'brazen', 'initiatives', 'foster', 'truth.I', 'was', 'hypnotized', 'movie', 'also', 'impressed', 'import', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'Dreyman', 'Wiesler', 'shallow', 'existence', 'government', 'spy', 'one', 'scene', 'Wiesler', 'bar', 'tries', 'use', 'pick-up', 'line', 'heard', 'Dreyman', 'use', 'girlfriend', 'actors', 'also', 'convey', 'well', 'fear', 'resignation', 'pre-glasnost', 'Eastern', 'Germany', 'one', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'young', 'colleague', 'Stasi', 'cafeteria', 'telling', 'friends', 'joke', 'Party', 'Chairman', 'Little', 'realize', 'superiors', 'are', 'sitting', 'just', 'earshot', 'How', 'nervously', 'joke', 'marvelously', 'revealing', 'performance', 'Indeed', 'one', 'great', 'observations', 'movie', 'how', 'unguarded', 'foot-in-mouth', 'occasions', 'put', 'decent', 'citizens', 'great', 'peril', 'beginning', 'end', 'Lives', 'Others', 'really', 'dots', 'present', 'past', 'illuminating', 'way', 'movie', 'testament', 'triumph', 'arts', 'human', 'spirit', 'rooted', ""'Pan"", 'Labyrinth', 'win', 'best', 'Foreign', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'grudge', 'seeing', 'winner']",N/A

1066117,A1WXCMB52BON8N,B000OVLBGC,A Customer,"[1, 1]","'The Lives of Others' is an interesting recent German film set in the old Communist DDR, depicting a relationship between watcher and watched.The watched is Georg Dreyman, a playwright known for his ideological plays, and the only living East German playwright who is read in the West (the film being set in 1984). His plays express the possibility that people are capable of change - much to the contempt of the Minister for Culture, who doesn't believe they are. The corrupt Minister, who has designs on Dreyman's actress girlfriend, orders the Stasi (state security) to investigate him.Enter the watcher: Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler leads a lonely, fairly meaningless existence, mirroring the feeling of East Berlin itself (as portrayed in the film). But Wiesler also has an idealist streak, in contrast to his more Machiavellian colleagues. This idealism doens't quite mesh with the corrupt system - and perhaps he has sensed this subconsciously for some time. The things he overhears when listening in on Dreyman finally convince him that the system is not what it claims to be, nor what he originally thought it was.'The Lives of Others' is certainly worth watching for the evocative historical atmosphere it creates. Worth noting, too, is the ending, set two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Dreyman attends a new version of one of his old plays in Berlin, and comes face to face with his old enemy the Culture Minister. The latter expresses his contempt for the new Germany, saying it gives people ""nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against"". There is a phenomenon in Germany called 'Ostalgie' (nostaglia for the old East), and this may be the most eloquent critique of the new Germany - that an old Commie finds it so insipid as to be ""not even worth rebelling against!""But one thing the film DOESN'T show is how many ex-Stasi rats are still loose in the corridors of Berlin. The German Financial Time claims that around 17,000 ex-Stasi members are now civil servants.

The sonata was so beautiful it made him powerless to do what was he believed to be necessary. The Appassionata it turns out, is an important thematic aspect of the film itself.

1066127,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000OVLBGC,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 4]","The Lives of Others is a great movie. However, it is not a masterpiece. On the plus side, the director has a total command of the medium, he knows how to make a suspenseful, thoughtful, entertaining movie, that holds the interest of the audience even at a running time that exceeds 2 hours. What's more, the acting is uniformly great. Let's talk now about the main reason why I can't give the movie a five stars rating. The emotional heart of the movie is when the Stasi officer in charge of spying the playwright and his girlfriend, a very tough and experienced individual who presumably has worked in many similar cases before, decides instead to protect them. Why he would do that, risking an end to his career and even a charge of treason?. Though his motivations are not altogether clear (he is an extremely reserved man), the change of heart seems to happen in part as a result of listening to the playwright play a sonata on the piano after learning one of his colleagues committed suicide, after years of harassment by the government (he is also uneasy after finding out the Stasi is going for the playwright not for ideological reasons but in order that his beautiful girlfriend would then be available for the repellent minister of culture). As a metaphor from his newly found sensibility, he even steals a book from Brecht from the playwright's house, and is seen reading it. Is this believable? As much as the audience would be moved by a story of redemption, I think it's not. This is not a minor quibble, since this change of heart is really the main plot twist of the movie, on which all the film is build. From what I know, few if any Stasi officers have expressed any remorse from what they did, and continue to defend their actions. That aside, this is a great film, from a young director that really knows how to make a movie that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking. And it has many great scenes that you vividly remember later. The best one: the young Stasi officer making a ill-timed Honecker joke in the cafeteria. It's a scene that's so good on so many levels.",4,"Great film, though not a masterpiece",1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2098,"['Lives', 'Others', 'great', 'movie', 'However', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'plus', 'side', 'director', 'total', 'command', 'medium', 'how', 'make', 'suspenseful', 'thoughtful', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'interest', 'audience', 'even', 'running', 'time', '2', 'hours', 'What', 'more', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'great', 'Let', 'talk', 'now', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'rating', 'emotional', 'heart', 'movie', 'when', 'Stasi', 'officer', 'charge', 'spying', 'playwright', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'tough', 'experienced', 'individual', 'who', 'presumably', 'worked', 'many', 'similar', 'cases', 'decides', 'instead', 'protect', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'risking', 'end', 'career', 'even', 'charge', 'treason', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'altogether', 'clear', 'extremely', 'reserved', 'man', 'change', 'heart', 'happen', 'part', 'result', 'listening', 'playwright', 'play', 'sonata', 'piano', 'learning', 'one', 'colleagues', 'committed', 'suicide', 'years', 'harassment', 'government', 'also', 'uneasy', 'finding', 'out', 'Stasi', 'going', 'playwright', 'not', 'ideological', 'reasons', 'order', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'available', 'repellent', 'minister', 'culture', 'metaphor', 'newly', 'found', 'sensibility', 'even', 'book', 'Brecht', 'playwright', 'house', 'seen', 'reading', 'believable', 'As', 'much', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'moved', 'story', 'redemption', 'think', 'not', 'not', 'minor', 'quibble', 'change', 'heart', 'really', 'main', 'plot', 'twist', 'movie', 'film', 'build', 'what', 'know', 'few', 'Stasi', 'officers', 'have', 'expressed', 'remorse', 'what', 'did', 'continue', 'defend', 'actions', 'aside', 'great', 'film', 'young', 'director', 'really', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'vividly', 'remember', 'later', 'best', 'one', 'young', 'Stasi', 'officer', 'making', 'ill-timed', 'Honecker', 'joke', 'cafeteria', 'scene', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'levels']",N/A
1066128,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000OVLBGC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","When `Das Leben der Anderen' (The Lives of Others) won the Oscar last year for Best Foreign Film I was shocked to say the least.  I hadn't actually heard much about the film until Oscar night and since `Pan's Labyrinth' was so widely known and the expected winner I just couldn't see it being dethroned, and then it was.  At the time I hadn't seen either film but the general consensus was that `Pan's Labyrinth' was a masterpiece and so I was actually a little upset at the upset Oscar night.  Now that I have seen `Das Leben der Anderen' I can honestly say that I am no longer upset but thrilled that it is an Oscar winning film.  `Das Leben der Anderen' is one of the finest films I've seen in years and sports some of the finest performances to be cemented on film.  It's intriguing, enthralling and captivating from start to finish and is, in a word, flawless.The film takes place during 1984 in Berlin.  The East German Secret Police (or the Stasi) have ordered agent Gerd Wiesler to wiretap Georg Dreyman, a successful playwright, and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, to uncover whether or not they are a danger to the government.  There man not be any reason to suggest or accuse either of them of seditious thinking or actions but the mere fact that Minister Bruno Hempf has a personal interest in Sieland (a very personal interest) is reason enough to order to investigation.  This deep prying into their personal lives leads to some very devastating consequences that all could have, and should have, been avoided.The film beautifully fleshes out each character here and draws the audience into what is unfolding on the screen.  Ulrich Muhe (who sadly passed away shortly after the film was released) has received much praise and many accolades for his performance as Gerd Wiesler, the distraught Stasi agent spying on the couple.  As he further implants himself in their lives he begins to weigh out the pointlessness of his own existence and begins to wonder if what he believes is really what he should believe.  His performance is human, it's real, but it's not the best performance here.  Martina Gedeck has also received much praise for her portrayal of young actress Christa-Maria Sieland.  You can read the emotions that run across her face, the anger, the disbelief, the fear, the regret.  She is a revelation here, but she does not give the best performance here either.The top honors, in my humble opinion, are reserved for Sebastian Koch, who nails Georg Dreyman masterfully.  As the troubled writer struggling with his own views and those of the ones around him Koch makes Dreyman someone we can all relate to, and rationalize with.  There is so much to be told about this man, and so much is riding on this solitary performance.  We know that the Minister is fascinated with Sieland, but Wiesler is obsessed with Dreyman, and so it's up to Koch to let the audience know why.  Koch does just that.  His body language is effortless and captivating, his voice is empowering, his mannerisms, the way he floats from thought to spoken word is just pure brilliance.  Sebastian Koch gives one of, if not the finest performance I've seen this year.`Das Leben der Anderen' is beautifully written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in a way that not only draws the audience but makes them a part what's going on.  What he has done with his debut film is something many directors never accomplish, not in the entire span of their careers.  You will find yourself as personally invested in this story as Wiesler is, as absorbed in the lives of Dreyman and Sieland and even Wiesler himself and will ultimately be asking yourselves questions that only a masterpiece such as `Das Leben der Anderen' can illicit, questions about life, decisions and consequences and how we as human beings would react if given the opportunity.",5,These secrets are worth listening to...,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,3862,"['When', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'Lives', 'Others', 'won', 'Oscar', 'last', 'year', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'was', 'shocked', 'say', 'least', 'had', ""n't"", 'actually', 'heard', 'much', 'film', 'Oscar', 'night', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'was', 'so', 'widely', 'known', 'expected', 'winner', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'dethroned', 'then', 'was', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'general', 'consensus', 'was', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'upset', 'upset', 'Oscar', 'night', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'upset', 'thrilled', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'one', 'finest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'sports', 'finest', 'performances', 'be', 'cemented', 'film', 'intriguing', 'enthralling', 'captivating', 'start', 'finish', 'word', 'flawless.The', 'film', 'place', '1984', 'Berlin', 'East', 'German', 'Secret', 'Police', 'Stasi', 'have', 'ordered', 'agent', 'Gerd', 'Wiesler', 'wiretap', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'successful', 'playwright', 'girlfriend', 'actress', 'Christa-Maria', 'Sieland', 'uncover', 'not', 'are', 'danger', 'government', 'man', 'not', 'be', 'reason', 'suggest', 'accuse', 'seditious', 'thinking', 'actions', 'mere', 'fact', 'Minister', 'Bruno', 'Hempf', 'personal', 'interest', 'Sieland', 'very', 'personal', 'interest', 'reason', 'enough', 'order', 'investigation', 'deep', 'prying', 'personal', 'lives', 'very', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'avoided.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'out', 'character', 'here', 'audience', 'what', 'unfolding', 'screen', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'who', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'received', 'much', 'praise', 'many', 'accolades', 'performance', 'Gerd', 'Wiesler', 'distraught', 'Stasi', 'agent', 'spying', 'couple', 'implants', 'lives', 'weigh', 'out', 'pointlessness', 'own', 'existence', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'what', 'should', 'believe', 'performance', 'human', 'real', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'also', 'received', 'much', 'praise', 'portrayal', 'young', 'actress', 'Christa-Maria', 'Sieland', 'can', 'read', 'emotions', 'run', 'face', 'anger', 'disbelief', 'fear', 'regret', 'revelation', 'here', 'not', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'top', 'honors', 'humble', 'opinion', 'are', 'reserved', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'who', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'masterfully', 'troubled', 'writer', 'struggling', 'own', 'views', 'ones', 'Koch', 'Dreyman', 'someone', 'can', 'relate', 'rationalize', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'told', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'riding', 'solitary', 'performance', 'know', 'Minister', 'fascinated', 'Sieland', 'Wiesler', 'obsessed', 'Dreyman', 'up', 'Koch', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'why', 'Koch', 'just', 'body', 'language', 'effortless', 'captivating', 'voice', 'empowering', 'mannerisms', 'way', 'thought', 'spoken', 'word', 'just', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'one', 'not', 'finest', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'audience', 'part', 'what', 'going', 'What', 'done', 'debut', 'film', 'something', 'many', 'directors', 'never', 'accomplish', 'not', 'entire', 'span', 'careers', 'will', 'find', 'personally', 'invested', 'story', 'Wiesler', 'absorbed', 'lives', 'Dreyman', 'Sieland', 'even', 'Wiesler', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'asking', 'yourselves', 'questions', 'only', 'masterpiece', 'such', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'can', 'illicit', 'questions', 'life', 'decisions', 'consequences', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'would', 'react', 'given', 'opportunity']",N/A

The cast of relatively unknown German actors is superb, particularly Ulrich Muhe, Sebastian Koch and the alluring Martina Gedeck.

Writer/Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut stands head and shoulders not only over the other nominees, but also over all the nominees for Best Picture.  That so-called 'best' list pales in comparison to the heights attained by von Donnersmarck's creation.  It is a expertly-plotted, richly-told depiction of life under the dominion of the East German spying apparatus, the Stasi.'Lives' tracks the Stasi's efforts to bug and disrupt the lives of writer Georg Dreyman (a striking Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (the incomparable Martina Gedeck).  Assigned to the case is Stasi agent, Gerd Wiesler, indelibly played by Ulrich M&uuml;he.  The reasons for spying on Dreyman and 'CSM' (as the Stasi calls her)?  A Politburo minister has the hots for CSM.  That's it.  For that most personal of reasons, lives are ruined.  A professional reviewer of 'Lives' really hit the nail on the head when he said that the movie turns on the fact that Weisler realizes he is spying into the life of a man who is 'vastly his moral superior.'  That's it.  You get propelled into Dreyman's life and you are struck immediately and permanently by his decency and the quality of his character.  Over time, Weisler starts injecting himself into the proceedings.  At that point, the sequence of events is irrevocably changed.von Donnersmarck's movie is a continual series of one great scene after another.  I thought perhaps it had reached its denouement with the fall of the Wall.  But it keeps getting better.  Dreyman requests his Stasi files.  He begins to piece together the story and the role of Weisler.'The Lives of Others' is 137 minutes of the best entertainment imaginable. Ulrich M&uuml;he is an East German who himself was the target of Stasi oversight.  For this film, he was awarded Best Actor at the 2006 European Film Awards.

1066131,A13NM1PES9OXVN,B000OVLBGC,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[5, 5]","From the first frame to the last incredibly moving moment, ""The Lives of Others"" tells a delicate, suspenseful and beautifully moving story about an East German officer before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and how his surveillance of a playwright and his wife changes his life (and theirs) forever. The title is as much about envy as it is about discovery -- the main character is a painfully solitary man -- one who has always done his duty -- but this small surveillance changes him in ways he could never have anticipated. He grows to care for the lives he witnesses -- and to (perhaps) envy them.For instance, there's a small incidental scene where a little boy passes on his father's insult about the Stazi (the DDR police) and the man turns to snap at the boy and to reflexively ask what his father's name is (as he is used to doing -- everyone is supposed to be 'turned in' for the slightest infraction). And yet he has changed. He can't finish the sentence. It's a very small moment but it stayed with me.For those who may be a bit skittish about foreign films or 'art' films, I strongly recommend giving this movie a shot. It's easy to follow, incredibly well acted, and has a powerful ending.  As a snapshot of a particularly grim time and place, it's terrifying. The suspense is a constant presence because of the ""everyone's watching"" premise -- every word overheard, every action seen, every thought anticipated. The tension is constant.And Ulrich M&uuml;he simply owns the film. I was so sorry to hear of his death after filming, as the man has an incredible screen presence -- he's absolutely riveting, and despite his character's quietness, your eye is always drawn to him. His face is so expressive that its very stillness is powerful (and never more so than in the film's final and very satisfying moment).Note: The main Amazon review talks about ""too many epilogues"" and I can't disagree with this enough.

1066133,A2IIC3NBR966LL,B000OVLBGC,antaylor,"[3, 4]","Once in a while, a film comes along, totally unexpectedly, and reveals itself as not just a great film but one that renews your faith in cinema and stays with you long after it has ended. One that shows that film can be the most worthy art form and one which makes you realise this is what the best of cinema really is - intelligent, substantial and made with integrity without employing silly melodramatic contrivances. The Lives of Others is such a film, undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen in the last decade, an intelligent study of a cold, emotionally stern man who undergoes an emotional awakening and humanizing effect by slowly becoming aware of the richness of life that is eluding his own austere existence.The man in question is Gerd Weisler, a Stasi officer in East Germany in the mid 1980's. He's distrusting and quietly imposing, stands by the socialist ideals of his government and is determined to uncover political dissent wherever possible. He is simply a cog in the regime. There is nothing to warm to, no personality, individuality or life in him. He's a robot worker and nothing else. That is until he is called upon to spy on an artist couple in their apartment who may or may not be up to something. We first see Wiesler's distrust of the writer in an early scene, a distrust based on nothing more than a gut feeling - or perhaps from a twang of jealousy of this man's obvious contentment and fulfillment. To Wiesler, he is simply ""arrogant"" and so must be a cause for concern. I don't need to go into any more detail about the plot here but needless to say it paves the way for some moments of high tension and clever plot devices.However, it's what happens to Wiesler's character throughout that really pushes the buttons and makes for such a lasting impression. His transformation from perpetrator to defector, from hunter to protector. During his surveillance mission, he hears everything the couple say and do, mechanically jotting down every last detail in a notebook and then typing up reports. And so he begins to experience the couple's life vicariously and slowly starts to realise that he wants, needs what they have and that he doesn't - friends, love, beauty, fulfillment. We see him start to change, to restrain himself in situations where he would usually impose himself, we see wonderful key moments where he displays acts of kindness and reveals emotions we didn't think he would be capable of. He ends up surprising us, redeeming himself by risking his career and life for the artists, by calmly deflecting the suspicions of his wily superiors about his integrity to the cause, protecting the inevitably tragic couple from above like some personal guardian angel completely unbeknownst to them, who have no idea they are even under surveillance.Such a character study would be nothing without a great actor and Ulrich M&uuml;he plays the role perfectly, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing it (what a real shame he passed away recently). His role recalls that of Billy Bob Thornton's in The Man Who Wasn't There, someone who hardly says two words but expresses everything beautifully through his body language and facial expressions. We see him in many different states during the course of the film; from a sometimes menacing and ice cold authoritative instructor and interrogator for the Stasi through to a simple menial state postal worker, allowing time to pass him by as he plods along on his route. He is always believable and an interesting character to watch unfold. The rest of the acting is also first rate, especially from Wiesler's Stasi superiors.Despite the obvious differences, I would sum up The Lives of Others as a The Shawshank Redemption for this decade because of its significant emotional arc. It has a beautifully controlled, unrushed poetic approach and you get the feeling that the filmmaker (also a debut) has put all he has into it, has fashioned it with a lot of care and attention. You could also say that like Shawshank, it follows a man's escape from an oppressive and dehumanising regime to become human once again.

1066134,ARA48345JZPZR,B000OVLBGC,Archmaker,"[1, 1]","This brilliant, quiet film concerning life under the iron boot of a truly totalitarian society, the GDR (East Germany) in the pre-Glasnost 80's, is a wonderful examination of life in that opressive regime and the effects on both those spied upon and those doing the spying.  Beautifully composed and filmed it has a central portrayal by Ulrich Muhe that is simply remarkable and stunning work.  Nuanced and subtle, Muhe's seemingly impassive face in actuality conveys worlds of meaning as we see the conflict grow in this Stasi bureaucrat as all of the assumptions and precepts of his life are called into question by his surveillance of people trying to live real lives with some value within the unyielding confines and contradictions of a Soviet-style socialist state.  It is a world class performance and, tragically, this fine actor's last.All of the supporting work by Martina Gedeck as the sensuous and compromised actress, Sebatian Koch as the conflicted playwright, and Ulrich Tukur as Muhe's ambitious and more politically savvy Stasi boss, is fine as well.  But this show belongs to Muhe and his director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who has brought this page of history to life with fidelity and care.  He has written a fine work that reveals life under the unrelenting intrusion of the State, and he found his muse in Muhe, who actually lived under those conditions in the GDR and was himself a courageous opponent of the State before the wall fell.The film moves at the deliberate and stately pace of the Sonata that is one of its centerpieces: quietly somber, sad and slightly dissonant.  This is first class work and a classic that fully deserved the Best Foreign Language Oscar it won.  First rate in all departments, this is a great film with a transcendent central performance that is a tribute to both the man and the actor. When presented with an approximation of the dread atmosphere generated by true opression, one is cautioned not to use such terms frivolously in our own discourse.

1066135,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,B000OVLBGC,a writer,"[1, 1]","Even as the decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall pass and dread memories of the Iron Curtain fade from our consciousness, a film like ""The Lives of Others"" has the quiet power to remind you that human evil, weakness, hope and despair are eternal themes. Too many other reviewers have lauded the movie's superb plot and characterizations for me to add anything new at this point. Simply, I was disturbed, depressed and yet gladdened to see how the lives portrayed in the drab GDR turned out by the end of the story. The Stasi captain Wiesler, who appears coldly methodical and assured in his work for the totalitarian state, is actually a lonely and sad individual. His job of listening in on the lives of the playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover Christa-Maria Sieland, far from securing the GDR against subversives, ends up diminishing him as a person. His work exposes him to the realization that his life is empty and hopeless. We see this only in snatches: a bit of mournful piano heard on his headphones induces tears; an encounter with one of his victims in a drab bar nearly forces him to blurt out his complicity; and his meetings with his superiors take on a growing desperation. Wiesler is playing a double game in a system where everything is rigged by the State. Everyone knows that the system collapsed in 1989, but the way individuals are made to suffer and suffocate is a strength of this film.One of the great things about ""The Lives of Others"" is how it treats life in a stifling environment like East Germany. The neighborhood where Dreyman lives and Wiesler sets up his listening post is a cold unwelcoming world where people walk mostly alone if they're visible at all. Streets are wide boulevards yet hardly any traffic is heard; the cars we do see are pathetic Trabants, emblems of the socialist economy. Black Volvo limousines are for Party officials, either for secret trysts or for meetings with underlings. The color palette is all muted grays, washed-out blues and sepias, as cheerless as the humans who shuffle about their day. This is not the sterile fluorescent world conjured up in Orwell's ""1984,"" it's a totally real and believable place where ordinary people try to go about their lives under the circumstances.There are three themes running through ""The Lives of Others"": the forlorn hope the playwright Dreyman shares with his colleagues that they can maneuver within the grip of the Stasi; the torment that Christa-Marie faces when she's forced to become a State informant; and the crack in Wiesler's veneer of allegiance to the State. It's this third theme that fascinates me the most, because, unlike the all-too human actors and writers he spies on, Wiesler is supposed to be professional, merciless and detached. I found myself alternately despising him and cheering him as he veers between Party loyalty and decency. I think the film raises the eternal question: how much suffering must apparatchiks like Wiesler inflict on others before he cracks? In the interrogation scenes we see uniformed guards whose garb eerily resembles the SS style that preceded it. You're reminded: oh yes, the GDR arose from the ashes of Nazi Germany: the same methods for a new era. Wiesler is the embodiment of the ""I'm just doing my job"" mindset that nourishes tyrannical governments. His boss, a worm of a man named Grubitz, is as ambitious and unremarkable as they come. We've seen many bureaucrats like him and his oafish Minister fade into the new world of a reunited Germany. But it's Wiesler, now humbled and marginalized as a delivery clerk, whom we're riveted to. When he and Dreyman intersect in the aftermath of the Communist era, it's a statement of redemption and hope that doesn't rely on a sappy happy ending.A few reviewers have observed that ""The Lives of Others"" is slow-paced and lacking action. Just like the dreary lives trapped in a Socialist paradise...

The movie also tried to tell us that this actress Christa-Maria is some sort of wonderful actress but the stage scenes at the start show the corniest of all theatrical acting. If she's so ""great,"" I certainly don't see it onstage.The movie is basically carried by Ulrich Muhe who plays the Stasi agent monitoring the eavesdropping of the playwright Georg Dreyman. His robotic movements yet his compassionate actions show you how a man so a part of the state has a humanity that many of the so-called ""rebels"" in East German society only play at.The movie also captures how dull life must have been like in the very grey East Germany. In the special feature extra the actors and director say the music played a big part in the story. I don't know what movie they were watching but it barely registered with me at all. The way Muhe's character Weisler decided to basically turn in false reports was what grabbed me more than his listening to one piece of music over the bugging devices.Anyway, it's worth watching to understand how crazily insane the East German state was and how so much effort was put into spying on their own people. To say this is a great movie is a stretch, though. I say for Muhe's portrayal of a Stasi agent it deserves accolades but the rest of the cast and story is nothing special really.

Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler(Ulrich Muhe)is a career Stasi officer who has made it his life goal to serve the GDR. He is a cold often emotionless man who is one of East Germany's best interrogators. His superior Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) charges him with spying on noted Socialist playwrite Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend , Christa (Martina Gedeck). The reason for the spying is ostensibly to find something that can be used by the State to get the writer out of the way so that Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) can get closer to Christa.The film slowly shows one man's journey from tool of the state to protector of the rights of those oppressed by the system. The viewer watches as the interrogator who has essentially no one in his life opens up when exposed to the world of the writer. This is a world filled with love and music. Things that are missing from his own life. To go on would be to spoil the story but suffice it to say this is a very human story that is told slowly and in layers.I saw this on the Blu-ray version of the disc and the picture and sound quality were exceptional.

It's sad, thoughtful and redemptive, and it deals with major themes. We're in East Germany a few years before the fall of the Berlin wall. The Stasi are everywhere, watching everyone and punishing in brutal or subtle ways anyone who might be even an implied threat to the government. Their greatest tool is the system of informers that reaches everywhere, people who may relay indiscretions to the Stasi because they believe in what they are doing, but more often are compromised into doing so. People are given terrible choices to either work with the Stasi as informers or see their careers or their children's futures destroyed. One-third of the East German population is kept under Stasi surveillance. Everyone, it seems, is being watched by someone.Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who has made his accommodations with the regime, has won awards and has learned not to go too far. The mere fact that he is seen as reliable makes him a subject of Stasi interest. That, and because his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), is coveted by a powerful official who wants Dreyman ruined. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a dedicated, colorless Stasi officer, noted for his reliability and interrogation skills, is assigned the job of monitoring Dreyman. This means installing bugs in Dreyman's apartment where Dreyman lives with Sieland, setting up 24 hour monitoring, recording everything and preparing reports. Wiesler takes his share of listening in. Weisler seems to have no purpose but his dedication to the ideals of the East German system, but even he can see the corruption of those ideals. He has no friends to speak of except his boss, who knows which way the wind can shift. Dreyman, on the other hand, is a handsome man of talent who loves Christa and who has seen a close friend and talented director banned from the theater for speaking too clearly. Dreyman gradually finds the conscience he had put on hold in order to be successful. Wiesler gradually finds himself, through listening in, drawn to an awareness of the compromises and corruption he knows has seeped into a system he once believed in. Even more subtly, he finds himself drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Christa-Maria. Slowly, cautiously and anonymously, Wiesler begins to protect Dreyman. All the while we are witness to the pervasive spying on people, the pettiness, the corruption of authority, the use of subtle threats to keep people in line, the almost comic meticulousness of the Stasi and their obsessive record keeping on everyone. The conclusion of the film brings us well past the fall of the Berlin wall, when the full evidence of Stasi spying and the corruption of so many to be informers became evident. We see what happened to both Dreyman and Wiesler. I found the ending to be very, very emotional.This was director von Donnersmarck's first feature film. He also was the writer. The acting is just as good as the film, particularly Muhe, Koch and Gedeck. Muhe has perhaps the toughest job.

1066153,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000OVLBGC,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[6, 9]","Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Feature, ""The Lives of Others"" offers a stark but moving portrayal of the people in 1980's Socialist East Germany, before the fall of the Berlin Wall.Ulrich Muhe stars as stern Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler, a man who seems successful within the Socialist system yet leads a life as sterile and empty as the apartment he returns home to every night.  When Wiesler carries out a surveillance assignment to monitor Georg Dreyman, a writer known as ""the only non-subversive author read in the West"", he suffers a crisis of confidence as he witnesses the corruption within his government and subsequently comes to envy and even care for the very subjects of his surveillance.The movie is perhaps a bit overlong, but that might be due to the fact that there are many themes played out over the course of its two hours and seventeen minutes.  This is the kind of movie that, without being too chaotic and forced, has a lot going on - it works both on a human level while also having a strong thematic/social aspect.So a viewer can both invest in the personal, emotional struggles of the characters while also appreciating the nature of the larger, overarching structural system that contains and constrains them.  In many ways, these two aspects are inseparable, as one sees in this film that the same kinds of people show up in all types of governments - the corrupt, the true believers, the incompetent buffoons, the self-serving careerists.  And one also gets the sense that love and betrayal usually possess enough power to throw a monkey wrench into even the most seemingly sturdy societal organizations, whether that organization is fueled by fear or by capital.I also enjoyed how this film depicted the fact that life's little actions sometimes have huge and irreversible consequences. And it also does an artful job illustrating the simultaneously cyclical and entropic nature of governmental corruption - we see how some governments tend to create their own enemies, thus seemingly perpetuating the need for their own corrupt existences, only to ultimately collapse upon themselves.Holding all of this together is a solid ensemble cast topped off with a terrific performance by Muhe; in a key and moving scene, the actor does an astonishing job of letting just one tear escape from his otherwise stone-faced visage.  And, through this one action alone, one gets the sense that this single drop of water might be the first trickle of a dam bursting.  Or, perhaps, a wall coming down.",4,"Better Than Pan's Labyrinth?

In this subversive, totalitarian society people must be careful in their every utterance, as prying ears are everywhere.  Wrong thinking or ideologies often resulted in draconian measures.""The Lives of Others"" revolves around the whimsical surveillance of highly approved playwright Georg Dreyman played by Sebastian Koch.  The Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf played by Thomas Thieme had become enamored with Dreyman's girlfriend renowned actress Christa-Maria Sieland played by Martina Gedeck.  He commissioned the Stasi, East German secret police. to bug Dreyman's flat to find anything that would imprison him and get him out of the way.The job of surveillance was given to Captain Gerd Wiesler played wonderfully by Ulrich Muhe.  Wiesler was a formidable and relentless interrogator who actually schooled young Stasi agents in technique.  Wiesler's boss and schoolmate Lt. Col. Grubitz played by Ulrich Tukur made sure to point out that their careers depended on the success of their mission.Wiesler with typical Aryan efficiency began compiling massive files on Dreyman but could not find incriminating evidence.  Slowly he began getting wrapped in the lives of Dreyman and his girlfriend Sieland.  When an article smuggled out of East Germany was published in the prestigious and widely read West German Stern magazine denouncing the government and attributed to the watched playwright, Wiesler had a decision to make.  Introspectively he began examining the veracity and worthiness of his mission and the sanctity of an individual's privacy.  He was now forced to take action, but what would he do?""The Lives of Others"" started slowly but as the magnitude of the premise of the plot became clearer, my appreciation of the statement the film was making grew greater and greater.

That Wiesler may not have been able to exist in reality has nothing to do with the diegetic reality of the film, wherein he functions quite well, save for the rather thin reason for his `treason.' As stated, it would have been more plausible if he protected Dreyman so that Grubitz and Hempf lost face, for abusing the `good will' of the Communist state. Few critics, though, have commented on the drab visuals (including those not intended), the trite dialogue between the artists, and the presence of numerous melodramatic plot twists used merely to move the sometimes slow moving 137 minute film along (it could have lost 30 minutes to great positive effect). Despite this, it is a solid film, but one likely not deserving of an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Picture, which it won.I mentioned its affinity to The Conversation, but this film is far more prosaic, and, as terrific an acting performance as M&uuml;he provides, his character is simply not nearly as complex as Gene Hackman's Harry Caul, nor is his self-doubt as realistically (and, more importantly, effectively) depicted. He should have been protecting Dreyman to screw Grubitz, rather than for Dreyman's sake (or even because he, too, lusted for Sieland), because that would have been believable, and added layers of depth to Wiesler's conversion (so, too, could shading have been thus added to Wiesler's taking of the typewriter- is he protecting Dreyman, or trying to hide his own prior protection of Dreyman? But, that also would have required a depth of life experience and writerly ability that the callow Donnersmarck, and his rather straightforward plot, lacked. However, all in all, a good effort from a first time filmmaker, and one that deserved applause, if not all the plaudits it received.  For all its flaws, the screenplay and film, at least, attempt something of depth, even if, overall, they come up short. Wiesler ultimately loses faith not in the `system,' but in the people who run the system; this is why he is so disconsolate, even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, for his system is now dead.The Lives Of Others does fall prey to the Day After Effect, for its flaws stick more than its good qualities, but it's worth a viewing for those good qualities, faithful or -less.

During the course of his surveillance, Gerd comes to realise that it is in fact a senior party member's envy of Johan's relationship with actress Christa-Maria Sealand (Martina Gedeck), rather than any seditious behaviour on his own part, that has led to Johan being earmarked as a dissident. Quietly incensed by this corruption of socialist ideals and state mechanisms, and touched by the depth warmth, depth and vulnerability of Georg and Christa-Maria's relationship (which only serves to underline his own inherent sense of loneliness), Gerd begins to consider a quiet act of rebellion. But what chance of success can he truly hope to have given that he exists in a world in which even the watchmen are watched?The ""lonely man"" genre of film is one that has been well-mined in cinema, but never to such devastating emotional effect as it is in ""The Lives Of Others"". Sure, you felt sorry for Gene Hackman and Robin Williams at the end ofThe ConversationandOne Hour Photo (Widescreen Edition), but neither of those films elicited the emotional responses that I experienced whilst watching ""The Lives Of Others"". Perhaps this was due to the fact that this story had an all too painful basis in the recent history of a country which once considered omnipresent surveillance, arbitrary imprisonment and state harassment to the point of suicide as legitimate tools of government; or perhaps it was due to the shocking degree of authenticity (many of the actors themselves grew up living under the yoke and suffering harassment at the hands of the Stasi and virtually all of the locations featured and surveillance equipment depicted in the film were the real mcoy), but largely I suspect the reason that I was so effected by this film was because it is simply the most perfectly realised and stunningly well-acted film of it's kind.Ulrich M&uuml;he gives one of the most brilliantly nuanced performances that I have ever seen as a cog who begins to realise that the machine - of which he is an initially willing component - is being maintained and run by and for the convenience of a corrupt and odious few. His is not some heroic, Damascus-style conversion to the cause of humanity but rather the quiet, diligent commitment of a man (who has been duped into giving his life to a corrupted ideal) to doing something for two gentle people who do not deserve a fate decreed by avaricious, envious Gods; the acts which he undertakes are carried out as much for his own sense of metaphysical self-preservation as for Georg and Christa-Maria's physical safety - a fact which is driven home by the very final line of the film.However, one should not fixate on M&uuml;he's performance alone though as the film truly is an ensemble piece in which every performance evokes the reality of lives lived under a constant state control and surveillance (and for those looking for further insight into the reality of life In the GDR, I wholeheartedly recommend Anna Funder's disturbingly fascinating book,Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall).It is well known that the course of history is in fact written by a million quiet acts. But it is rare that the minutiae of one such act is so subtly, effectively and devastatingly rendered on the big screen and it is for this reason that ""The Lives Of Others"" deserves every accolade that it has received.",5,Sonata For A Good Man,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,3796,"['East', 'Germany', '1984', 'Gerd', 'Wiesler', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'career', 'policeman', 'German', 'Democratic', 'Republic', 'notorious', 'Stasi', 'frighteningly', 'well-skilled', 'methods', 'interrogation', 'surveillance', 'Gerd', 'tasked', 'department', 'head', 'job', 'bugging', 'electronically', 'surveiling', 'collecting', 'evidence', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'popular', 'playwright', 'glowing', 'socialist', 'polemics', 'are', 'unilaterally', 'favoured', 'party', 'course', 'surveillance', 'Gerd', 'realise', 'fact', 'senior', 'party', 'member', 'envy', 'Johan', 'relationship', 'actress', 'Christa-Maria', 'Sealand', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'rather', 'seditious', 'behaviour', 'own', 'part', 'led', 'Johan', 'being', 'earmarked', 'dissident', 'Quietly', 'incensed', 'corruption', 'socialist', 'ideals', 'state', 'mechanisms', 'touched', 'depth', 'warmth', 'depth', 'vulnerability', 'Georg', 'Christa-Maria', 'relationship', 'only', 'underline', 'own', 'inherent', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'Gerd', 'consider', 'quiet', 'act', 'rebellion', 'what', 'chance', 'success', 'can', 'truly', 'hope', 'have', 'given', 'world', 'even', 'watchmen', 'are', 'watched', 'lonely', 'man', 'genre', 'film', 'one', 'been', 'well-mined', 'cinema', 'never', 'such', 'devastating', 'emotional', 'effect', 'Lives', 'Others', 'Sure', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'end', 'ofThe', 'ConversationandOne', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'films', 'elicited', 'emotional', 'responses', 'experienced', 'whilst', 'watching', 'Lives', 'Others', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'story', 'had', 'too', 'painful', 'basis', 'recent', 'history', 'country', 'once', 'considered', 'omnipresent', 'surveillance', 'arbitrary', 'imprisonment', 'state', 'harassment', 'point', 'suicide', 'legitimate', 'tools', 'government', 'perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'shocking', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'many', 'actors', 'grew', 'up', 'living', 'yoke', 'suffering', 'harassment', 'hands', 'Stasi', 'virtually', 'locations', 'featured', 'surveillance', 'equipment', 'depicted', 'film', 'were', 'real', 'mcoy', 'largely', 'suspect', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'effected', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'most', 'perfectly', 'realised', 'stunningly', 'well-acted', 'film', 'kind.Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'one', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'cog', 'who', 'realise', 'machine', 'initially', 'willing', 'component', 'being', 'maintained', 'run', 'convenience', 'corrupt', 'odious', 'few', 'not', 'heroic', 'Damascus-style', 'conversion', 'cause', 'humanity', 'rather', 'quiet', 'diligent', 'commitment', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'duped', 'giving', 'life', 'corrupted', 'ideal', 'doing', 'something', 'two', 'gentle', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'fate', 'decreed', 'avaricious', 'envious', 'Gods', 'acts', 'are', 'carried', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'own', 'sense', 'metaphysical', 'self-preservation', 'Georg', 'Christa-Maria', 'physical', 'safety', 'fact', 'driven', 'home', 'very', 'final', 'line', 'film.However', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'fixate', 'M', 'uuml', 'performance', 'alone', 'film', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'performance', 'reality', 'lives', 'lived', 'constant', 'state', 'control', 'surveillance', 'looking', 'further', 'insight', 'reality', 'life', 'GDR', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'Anna', 'Funder', 'disturbingly', 'fascinating', 'book', 'Stasiland', 'Stories', 'Berlin', 'Wall', '.It', 'well', 'known', 'course', 'history', 'fact', 'written', 'million', 'quiet', 'acts', 'rare', 'minutiae', 'one', 'such', 'act', 'so', 'subtly', 'effectively', 'devastatingly', 'rendered', 'big', 'screen', 'reason', 'Lives', 'Others', 'accolade', 'received']",N/A

When the wrong joke could land one in prison or the gulag, the risks of free expression made normal human interactions and exchanges extremely dangerous. As a result, people resorted to coded language, euphemism, and perhaps most commonly the avoidance of topics. Telling the truth was frequently not an option. Anyone who spent any time in Russia or eastern Europe before 1989 realized this in short order.The Lives of Others, by focusing on a small group of artists involved with the theater and their state-security antagonists, who monitor their every act--what they write, what they say, whom they visit, whom they love, what they think--reveals the absolute corruption of the communist system. It also reveals the heavy penalties paid by those who made any attempt to fight back, or who simply found themselves caught up in a maelstrom not of their own making. Some made it to the end, when the Wall came down; for others, loss of work and attendant poverty, imprisonment, and suicide were the outcome.This film will be the standard against which all others on the destructiveness of communism to average lives must be measured in the future.

I can only say that it is a magnificent film that tells a genuine story about what life was like for Germany's citizens in 1984 when the Stasi secret police would listen to their conversations.  This was the era of the Berlin Wall when the GDR feared even their most loyal citizens were sympathizing with the West against their policy which involved monitoring their artists with a voice such as writers, playwrights, and actors.  Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is a true, gifted German director and story teller with the ability to conjure strong emotion that elevates The Lives of Others above the political spy film. Actors Sebastian Koch, Martina Gedeck, and Ulrich Muhe all give beyond stellar performances as the main characters. You will feel your heart throb at the injustice done to Dreyman (Koch) as he keeps his hope that men can change through art, Sieland (Gedeck) who wants to keep her acting career while loving him, and Wiesler (Muhe) the Stasi agent who monitors their record while desiring to protect their futures. It is a film that shows how unfair people with power (GDR, political elite) can be to people who don't have it (Artists and citizens) and what the end result can be if taken far enough (suicide or incarceration).

The storyline itself is rather straightforward (although it is developed with a great deal of complexity and suspense). It takes place in East Germany during the latter years of the Cold War. Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is an author who lives with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), in a small apartment. Although not sympathetic to the regime, they must carefully watch the way they act and what they say so as not to arouse suspicion. Nevertheless, they are assigned a Stasi agent, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he). While they are gone their apartment is bugged and Wiesler takes up residence in a vacant flat nearby. At first he is enthusiastic for his work. However, over time, as he compares his life to that of Georg and Christa-Maria, he becomes convinced of their moral superiority. Because he has access to their conversations, he knows that Georg is writing a book that exposes many of the abuses of the regime, a book that he intends to sneak out of the country. Rather than reporting these conversations, Wiesler covers for Georg in his daily reports of his activities.What makes this film so compelling is not just the gripping storyline (only part of which I've revealed), but the acting as well. M&uuml;he in particular does an incredible job of portraying Wiesler.And, of course, for anyone who lived during a significant part of the Cold War (as I did) and saw the Berlin Wall torn down (which takes place near the end of the movie, at which time Wiesler has already been demoted to working in the mailroom), this is an incredibly realistic look into the way life was behind the Iron Curtain. But this movie also has a message for those too young to remember those days: When the civil government tries to run all aspects of our lives it can succeed only through intruding into the private life of its citizens.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 5]","This is a fictional story of stuff that actually went on in the former East Germany (also known as the German Democratic Republic, or GDR) before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The year is 1984.  While there is no mention of it in the Special Features, it seems clear to me that it's an allusion to George Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four.  After all, the GDR came about as close as the world has ever come to realizing Orwell's nightmarish dystopia.I had heard horror stories about how oppressive the East German government was & how they were always ""snooping around.""  However, this film brought the stories to life in a dramatic fashion.  The denizens of the GDR were made more ""real"" by being immersed in a plausible plotline.For all those people out there who think that the Patriot Act is a wonderful idea, this movie is likely to be a sobering experience.  The GDR was a chilling world where warrantless wiretapping and domestic spying ran amock.  No matter how noble the objective of warrantless wiretapping, once you open those gates you find yourself on a VERY slippery slope.  At the bottom of the slope is the former GDR or present-day North Korea.  Neither are or were pleasant places to spend one's life.George W. Bush would be likely to watch this movie and say ""Wow, those GDR folks really had their act together.  Wish we could have been more like them while I was in office!""

It takes us into a world most people are not very familiar with and involves us in a story filled with questions concerning personal morality as opposed to public political action. However, if you're expecting this movie to be some sort of cinematic jewel of the early years of the 21st-century, you'll be very disappointed. Audiences who are not familiar with foreign cinema always overpraise recent foreign hits such as ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""City of God"", even the delightful ""Amelie"". The Lives of Others will now be another foreign film that American middle class consumers can identify and heap unwarranted enthusiasm upon.But wait! Apparently the evil Hollywood powers are working on bringing this film to an even bigger public than the arthouse film dwellers. Supposedly The Lives of Others will get a remake in the near future, American style!That sounds frightening indeed and we should be thankful for the success we already have here in front of us with the original film. The performances in this movie are very fine, especially the actor Ulrich Muhe who recently passed away from cancer. ( He plays the character of Weisler. ) This film will forever be a fitting memorial to his career.Not everything in this movie works however. We get some Hollywood-esque sappiness creeping up on us from time to time, especially concerning the relationship between the writer ( Sebastian Koch ) and the actress ( Martina Gedeck ). The ending drags out a bit but ultimately finishes in a supremely endearing way. The final image is very genuine and makes you mourn the passing of the highly talented actor Ulrich Muhe.I also liked the in-depth talk from the director which is an extra feature on this DVD.

1066180,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000OVLBGC,E. Anderson,"[8, 8]","I must confess I went into seeing ""The Lives of Others"" with some apprehension. I didn't know much about it other than that spying was involved. Much to my surprise, I left the theatre glad that I had gone to see the Oscar winning film.The story of ""The Lives of Others"" takes place in 1984 in East Berlin, when both Germanys were still separated by the wall as well as politics. Ulrich Muhe plays Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, a member of the Stasi. He is hired to spy on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) for suspicious activities.  In the beginning of the film Wiesler is portrayed as a cold, calculating, loyal member of the Stasi who does not question the authority of the Stasi or government. As the film progresses on, the more Wiesler observes his subject and his gorgeous girlfriend Christa-Maria Siedland (Martina Gedeck), I began to slight changes in Wiesler's demeanor. Life begins to appear in Wiesler's eyes after years of working as a member of the Stasi. These changes eventually effects Wiesler's assignment and he makes choices that drastically alters both his subject's and his own life.I was so impressed that this was the movie debut of director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The details Florian went into to portray life in East Germany prior to the wall coming down was so well thought out. Although the story is fictional, Florian did an amazing job at portraying life in communist East Germany as accurate as possible. For a film that was almost 2.5 hrs long, I thought time flew by for me. The performances were so well done. For me, Ulrich Muhe is the star of the film. Seeing his personality change ever so slightly through out the film was so compelling to watch. Seeing him change from being so cold to so vulnerable was quite heartbreaking especially his scenes with Martina Gedeck. Not many actresses today are able to convince me of their character's vulnerability and anguish but Martina Gedeck succeeds where most actresses fails for me. Her performance as Christa-Maria was tremendous with her subtle,nuanced skills as an actress.There honestly wasn't anything about ""The Lives of Others"" that I did not like. The writing was excellent. It did not insult the filmgoer's intelligence with bad diaogue and over the top action sequences. The filmmaker relied more on suspense and character development. Everyone's performances were wonderful. Now if only filmmakers from this country could do as good of a job as Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.

1066181,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B000OVLBGC,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[6, 6]","The Academy Award winning German film, ""The Lives of Others,"" is a gripping look at the repressive and corrupt regime of the German Democratic Republic in the year 1984 (shades of Orwell). The East German government, with the help of the Stasi, their Ministry for State Security, uses intimidation and a network of spies and informers to keep their citizens in line. A subversive could be incarcerated without trial, tortured, or at the very least, prevented from ever working again in his chosen profession.Georg Dreyman, played by the ruggedly handsome Sebastian Koch, is a talented writer who has thus far avoided a direct confrontation with the East German regime. He garners the Stasi's close attention when he openly complains about the blacklisting of his friend, director Albert Jerska, who has fallen into a deep depression. The authorities insert listening devices in Georg's apartment, and his conversations are monitored by Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, portrayed by Ulrich Muhe with chilling detachment. Even Georg's intimate moments with his sensual girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, are recorded.As Wiesler continues his surveillance, he undergoes a gradual transformation. He cannot help but contrast his sterile and isolated existence with the three-dimensional lives of Georg and his idealistic colleagues and friends. Wiesler decides to alter the contents of the conversations he overhears, substituting benign words for incriminating exchanges. Meanwhile, Dreyman is experiencing his own crisis of conscience. He has the opportunity to publish an article challenging the soundness of the East German regime, but if he is found out, he risks imprisonment and torture.Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck directs with consummate skill, and cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski's angular camera shots and dark palette convey claustrophobia and an atmosphere of impending doom. The performances are uniformly superb. Koch's Dreyman is a man of compassion whose desire for justice is tempered by his fear of reprisals; he is soon caught up in a tangled web that may yet strangle him. Martina Gedeck captures Christa-Maria's intense desperation. Although she adores Georg, she is forced to commit distasteful acts in order to stay on the good side of the powerful and malevolent Minister Bruno Hempf, who has fallen in love with her.  Ulrich Muhe, as Gerd Wiesler, speaks in a monotone, whether he is teaching a class of future policemen about the best techniques for eliciting information from a suspect, or engaging in a joyless tryst with a no-nonsense prostitute. Wiesler's stoicism is belied by expressive eyes that betray his emotional torment, inner pain, and deep need for some human connection.The film's central flaw is its tendency to preach; its themes are hammered home repeatedly, with barely a trace of subtlety.

The film takes place in the German Democratic Republic before the fall of the Berlin wall in 1984, and is a fictional story that revolves around the monitoring of a playwright by the secret police (Stasi). What is intriguing about the film is the meticulous drama that unfolds as the spy becomes emotionally involved with those he is spying on, but in the film, as in the real life of the Stasi, the spy is always looking over his own shoulder. This intricate story leaves one continually guessing where things will eventually lead when the leading characters' moral dilemmas are brought to the forefront.This German film went on to win the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

1066183,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000OVLBGC,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre'sThe Spy Who Came in From the Cold. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich M&uuml;he's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called ""Sonata for a Good Man"". It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola`s classic surveillance thriller,The Conversation. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, ""Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark"". There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes.",5,"Suspenseful, Nuanced Character Study Puts a Spotlight on a Little Known Aspect of the Cold War",1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,3326,"['Five', 'long', 'years', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'fell', 'Stasi', 'East', 'Germany', 'secret', 'police', 'was', 'height', 'infiltrative', 'power', 'one', 'fifty', 'cooperating', 'sniffing', 'out', 'scent', 'political', 'dissidence', 'Western', 'world', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'piece', 'Cold', 'War', 'history', 'Stasi', 'repressive', 'force', 'permeated', 'aspects', 'German', 'society', 'First-time', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmark', 'most', 'auspicious', 'debut', 'mesmerizing', 'epic-length', '2006', 'study', 'Stasi', 'devastating', 'impact', 'trio', 'characters', 'pre-glasnost', 'East', 'Berlin.The', 'protagonist', 'Captain', 'Gerd', 'Wiesler', 'who', 'initially', 'rigid', 'humorless', 'master', 'relentless', 'soul-baring', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'highly', 'prized', 'regime', 'so', 'utterly', 'uncompromising', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'story', 'evolve', 'closer', 'spirit', 'classic', 'Cold', 'War', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'John', ""LeCarre'sThe"", 'Spy', 'Who', 'Came', 'From', 'Cold', 'However', 'von', 'Donnersmark', 'deeper', 'conflicted', 'psyche', 'seemingly', 'Machiavellian', 'character', 'placing', 'situation', 'where', 'constantly', 'monitoring', 'activities', 'renowned', 'playwright', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'lover', 'actress', 'Christa-Maria', 'Sieland', 'shared', 'Dreyman', 'shown', 'signs', 'defying', 'current', 'regime', 'Wiesler', 'ordered', 'old', 'classmate', 'Grubitz', 'now', 'head', 'Stasi', 'Culture', 'Department', 'put', 'couple', 'surveillance', 'What', 'then', 'plot', 'unspoken', 'bonding', 'spirits', 'Wiesler', 'Dreyman', 'Sieland', 'inherent', 'contradictions', 'artistic', 'political', 'expression', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'pronounced', 'Wiesler', 'becomes', 'disillusioned', 'when', 'motivation', 'monitoring', 'artistic', 'couple', 'Minister', 'Hempf', 'unsavory', 'interest', 'Sieland', 'Meanwhile', 'Dreyman', 'ironically', 'have', 'political', 'consciousness', 'raised', 'blacklisted', 'playwriting', 'mentor', 'What', 'surprising', 'yet', 'most', 'fitting.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'solid', 'beginning', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'implosively', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'Wiesler', 'most', 'part', 'subtle', 'turn', 'highlighted', 'powerfully', 'cathartic', 'moments', 'such', 'response', 'Dreyman', 'playing', 'piece', 'called', 'Sonata', 'Good', 'Man', 'beg', 'comparisons', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 's', 'classic', 'surveillance', 'thriller', 'Conversation', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'are', 'equally', 'riveting', 'conflicted', 'Dreyman', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'Sieland', 'who', 'haltingly', 'own', 'dilemma', 'betrayal', 'Adding', 'immeasurably', 'fatalistic', 'Orwellian', 'atmosphere', 'Donnersmark', 'creates', 'are', 'Gabriel', 'Yared', 'evocative', 'music', 'including', 'beautiful', 'sonata', 'Hagen', 'Bogdanski', 'burnished', 'cinematography.The', 'one', 'drawback', '137-minute', 'length', 'found', 'slightly', 'excessive', 'especially', 'end', 'relatively', 'intimate', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'filmmaker', 'informative', 'often', 'enthusiastic', 'commentary', 'track', '2007', 'DVD', 'most', 'major', 'points', 'are', 'captured', 'half-hour', 'featurette', 'Interview', 'Director', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmark', 'also', 'twenty-minute', 'making-of', 'short', 'interviews', 'producers', 'principal', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

1066186,A2A6JQVO5I5SLR,B000OVLBGC,FOX,"[29, 32]","This movie was much better than I had expected.  I probably would never have watched it, as movies like this are usually with a political agenda, or too depressing and not very good stories with too predictable endings.  It was actually in an article that claimed William F Buckley Jr. said it was the best movie he had ever seen, that caught my attention and got my interest peaked.  What sort of movie could get such a reaction out of this guy?This movie is a great story all on it's own, even if you took the country and political group aside and made them generic, or placed the whole incident on some foreign planet in another solar system.Watching the movie, at first, I assumed the whole story was just going to show examples of how bad it was in East Germany, and try to preach another message of how bad those type of situations are.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a really good, well thought out, story line with an emotional ending that really was unexpected, and I had not seem coming, (very rare for movies today, I can usually figure out how all movies are going to end after watching them for only 10 minutes) and really made for a great movie experience for me.I am not one for war or military type movies or ones about oppresive governments and depressing situations.  Probably because they never have what this movie has, a clever and well written story that isn't all about teaching us a lesson, or preaching propaganda, but a really good story and movie that the big movie companies can't seem to write or produce anymore.If you watch this and at the begining don't know what is going on, and think it is too hard to follow, just stick with it!  Watch it to the end, and you will not be sorry!I love this movie, because of the individual characters that develop, and what happens at the end, and it goes through any politics or bias, it would be a great story even if you changed the country and regime to something else, because again, it is really about a great story between these individual characters, and not about preaching a political agenda, although such a unique story could not have been made without the setting of this type of situation, so the communist setting is in the story for a reason.Even in the bonus feature interviews, the director, (who also wrote, casted, researched and made this movie) said he was not out to make a movie with ""a message"" that seems to be the basic template of most movies today.  I'm glad, because when I watch a movie, I want to be entertained or be told a good story, not be forced to watch a 2 hour public service announcement or be taught how to think about a political issue.Also, I would like to note that the English Subtitles are very close to what is being said in German, which I find usually not to be the case with most movies.  I was impressed by the translation.  My wife doesn't understand German at all, and only had the subtitles to go by, and she loved the movie as much as I did, and came away with the same strong emotional satisfaction opon it's conclusion.The Bonus interviews are quite interesting to watch after the movie, giving some interesting and surprising information about some of the actors and thier real life history and experience with the time period and locations the story takes place in.  Especially the part about the actor that actually learned how to play piano for the movie.This DVD takes a proud place in my collection of favorite movies of all time.  I wouldn't say it was number 1, but would rank it in the top 10 or so, considering all the movies I have ever seen.I am not going to explain what touched me the most about this movie, and what is my most favorite part of it, because I don't want to ruin the experience for those who have not yet watched it.Even if you are usually turned away from this type of movie or story line, I highly recomend watching it, it is a brilliant story that has never been done before in a movie.My wife and I both felt a very strong emotional ""satisfaction"" after the movie was over and the credits were rolling.  Too many movies today end predictable, or else don't have any ending at all and leave too many unanswered questsions.

Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was ""Shield and Sword of the Party"" and its goal, ""To know everything"". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.I was shocked to find out that such astounding movie was a directorial debut of 33 years old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - so artistically impeccable this honest, human, horrifying, harrowing yet hopeful film is. The film makers had recreated successfully and precisely the 1980s with its dark suffocating atmosphere of constant abuse of individual privacy in the former German Democratic republic. The locations, the huge dominating gray apartment buildings of the big city where every wall seems to have the ears and the eyes , the old cars on the streets of East Berlin - everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically . As great as ""The Lives of Others is"", it would not have been the same without Ulrich M&uuml;he, as Captain Gerd Wiesler, a highly skilled and efficient STASI officer and a loyal member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who spies on successful playwright and his actress girlfriend by the order of corrupted hypocritical member of the government. While listening to the Lives of Others, Wiesler's own life would change in the way he had never expected.Once you start watching the movie, you'll see how Ulrich M&uuml;he effortlessly over towers every other performance on the screen, and they are all excellent. The real life of Ulrich M&uuml;he could make a great and compelling movie and the script for ""The Lives of Others"" was written with him in mind. He was born, grew up, and became a famous actor in the Eastern Germany back in the late 70s of the last century. By the words of von Donnersmarck, STASI began spying on M&uuml;he right after he had graduated from High School because STASI realized that he would be great even before he himself realized that. After German reunification, M&uuml;he discovered evidence in his STASI file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theater, but also by his second wife, Jenny Gr&ouml;llmann. This was denied by Gr&ouml;llmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent M&uuml;he from repeating the allegation in a book. M&uuml;he's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was simple, ""I remembered"". M&uuml;he passed away few months ago, in July 2007 due to stomach cancer at the age or 54, and when I read it, I felt emptiness - like a very good close friend has gone forever. His performance in the film ""The Lives of Others"" will live always as one of the best and most memorable given by any actor of the screen.",5,"1984, East Germany - Shield and Sword of the Party know everything",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,4032,"['Lives', 'Others', '2007', 'very', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'IMO', 'best', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'regardless', 'country', 'was', 'made', 'took', 'writer/director', 'several', 'years', 'first', 'thoroughly', 'research', 'still', 'very', 'painful', 'events', 'recent', 'German', 'history', 'ones', 'deal', 'infamous', 'evil', 'STASI', 'State', 'Secret', 'Police', 'how', 'infiltrated', 'affected', 'almost', 'aspect', 'GDR', 'life', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'system', 'most', 'ominous', 'infamous', 'symbol', 'wall', 'end', '80s', 'life', 'East', 'Germany', '1984', 'had', 'imitated', 'art', 'precisely', 'prophetic', 'terrifying', 'George', 'Orwell', 'novel', 'citizen', 'could', 'have', 'majority', 'were', 'closely', 'monitored', 'STASI', 'motto', 'was', 'Shield', 'Sword', 'Party', 'goal', 'know', 'everything', 'time', 'East', 'Germany', 'collapsed', '1989', 'STASI', 'employed', 'estimated', '91,000', 'employees', '300,000', 'informants', 'one', 'fifty', 'East', 'Germans', 'collaborated', 'powerful', 'Omni-present', 'Secret', 'Police', 'one', 'most', 'extensive', 'infiltrations', 'police', 'apparatus', 'history', 'STASI', 'monitored', 'political', 'behavior', 'GDR', 'citizens', 'known', 'have', 'used', 'torture', 'intimidation', 'mute', 'corrupt', 'destroy', 'dissent', 'Even', 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'suspicion', 'due', 'closeness', 'prominent', 'members', 'government', 'were', 'not', 'safe', 'film', 'lives', 'who', 'watched', 'listened', 'other', 'side', 'wire.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'such', 'astounding', 'movie', 'was', 'directorial', 'debut', '33', 'years', 'old', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'so', 'artistically', 'impeccable', 'honest', 'human', 'horrifying', 'harrowing', 'yet', 'hopeful', 'film', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'recreated', 'successfully', 'precisely', '1980s', 'dark', 'suffocating', 'atmosphere', 'constant', 'abuse', 'individual', 'privacy', 'former', 'German', 'Democratic', 'republic', 'locations', 'huge', 'dominating', 'gray', 'apartment', 'buildings', 'big', 'city', 'where', 'wall', 'have', 'ears', 'eyes', 'old', 'cars', 'streets', 'East', 'Berlin', 'everything', 'feels', 'authentically', 'As', 'great', 'Lives', 'Others', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'Captain', 'Gerd', 'Wiesler', 'highly', 'skilled', 'efficient', 'STASI', 'officer', 'loyal', 'member', 'Socialist', 'Unity', 'Party', 'Germany', 'who', 'successful', 'playwright', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'order', 'corrupted', 'hypocritical', 'member', 'government', 'listening', 'Lives', 'Others', 'Wiesler', 'own', 'life', 'would', 'change', 'way', 'had', 'never', 'expected.Once', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'effortlessly', 'towers', 'other', 'performance', 'screen', 'are', 'excellent', 'real', 'life', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'could', 'make', 'great', 'compelling', 'movie', 'script', 'Lives', 'Others', 'was', 'written', 'mind', 'was', 'born', 'grew', 'up', 'became', 'famous', 'actor', 'Eastern', 'Germany', 'back', 'late', '70s', 'last', 'century', 'words', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'STASI', 'began', 'spying', 'M', 'uuml', 'right', 'had', 'graduated', 'High', 'School', 'STASI', 'realized', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'even', 'realized', 'German', 'reunification', 'M', 'uuml', 'discovered', 'evidence', 'STASI', 'file', 'had', 'been', 'surveillance', 'not', 'only', 'four', 'fellow', 'actors', 'East', 'Berlin', 'theater', 'also', 'second', 'wife', 'Jenny', 'Gr', 'ouml', 'llmann', 'was', 'denied', 'Gr', 'ouml', 'who', 'acrimonious', 'highly-publicized', 'court', 'case', 'succeeded', 'obtaining', 'injunction', 'prevent', 'M', 'uuml', 'repeating', 'allegation', 'book', 'M', 'uuml', 'response', 'when', 'asked', 'how', 'prepared', 'role', 'Das', 'Leben', 'der', 'Anderen', 'was', 'simple', 'remembered', 'M', 'uuml', 'passed', 'away', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'July', '2007', 'due', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'age', '54', 'when', 'read', 'felt', 'emptiness', 'very', 'good', 'close', 'friend', 'gone', 'forever', 'performance', 'film', 'Lives', 'Others', 'will', 'live', 'always', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'given', 'actor', 'screen']",N/A

In the process, however, the spy finds himself becoming more and more involved in the lives of Georg and Christa.For the most part, I agree with what other reviewers have said about ""The Lives of Others"". Yes, this is a well made film that makes you truly understand what life was like in Cold War East Germany and I was fascinated by the character of Captain Weisler (Ulrich Muhe), the spy who listens in on ""the lives of others"". Watching Weisler's humanity bloom over the course of the film is a testament to how well this film is directed and to what a great actor Muhe is. However, for me, this film was let down by the fact that, even after 2 hours, I just didn't feel anything for Georg and Christa and didn't care whether they lived or died. I think this is in part due to the nature of the film. This is a film about voyeurism, and voyeurism is all about watching rather than participating. At the end of the film, I felt like I had watched Georg and Christa, but I didn't feel like I was a part of their lives. Then again, this feeling made me feel like I was in the same place as Capt. Weisler and I understood him all the more because of it.Overall, this is not my favourite foreign language film of all time, nor is it the best that I have see - I'm not sure if I would have given it the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar if it was up to me.

As the spy begins listening in, he begins to question the values of his society and the integrity of his orders.. Up to that point, Wiesler dutifully obeyed without question. But as the spy continues to experience the world of the playwright, he starts to live the subject's life vicariously...so the enemy ironically becomes the friend. The experience helps Captain Wiesler grow in humanity so he ultimately makes the decision to run interference to save the playwright's life.The film details the transformation of an organization man in a hostile society...and makes us remember the great books of totalitarian dangers such as Animal Farm, Anthem, Brave New World, and of course, 1984.  (It is no accident that the key YEAR in which the events take place in this film is indeed 1984).

1066194,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000OVLBGC,Grady Harp,"[15, 16]","DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended.

It also applies to half of the globe's nations where intelligence services play a dominant role at all levels. For those familiar with Arab countries, the East German Stasi was responsible for the training and organization of the secret police of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Syria's Hafez Assad and many other nations ruled by tyrants.Yet in East Germany, dictatorship fell because members of the Stasi themselves were not willing to further tolerate tyranny. In The Lives of Others, Gerd Weisler (Ulrich Muhe) plays the role of an East German Stasi drone. The setting of the movie shows him as a German who loves his country and serves it in his capacity as an intelligence officer. When one of his missions landed on artist Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), Weisler was exposed to the hypocrisy of the system he serves and accordingly changed course.Of particular importance to Arab viewers is the character of the good-willed Stasi officer, compared to the Arab intelligence officers, most of who are simply malicious and opportunistic. The German drone was honorable enough to take the side he felt was right. When the Berlin Wall fell, he did not join any insurgency (as is the case with many Iraqi intelligence people) but was rather settled for a low profile job.

1066202,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000OVLBGC,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[11, 11]","Made on a shoestring budget of $2 million, The Lives of Others is the most suspenseful psychological thriller I've seen in a long time, ranking with Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. What's more, it presents one of the strongest pro-individual, anti-collectivist themes of any movie I've ever seen--all the more surprising because it hails from, of all places, Germany.Its key lies in its title, which seems at first glance drippingly altruistic. The year, appropriately, is 1984, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is in his twentieth year as an agent of East Germany's dreaded Ministry for State Security, commonly known as ""Stasi."" The ""shield and sword"" of the Socialist Unity Party, 100,000 Stasi agents and 200,000 paid informers hold the small Soviet satellite nation in a death grip, monitoring and controlling the lives of its 17 million citizens.Captain Wiesler is a meticulous interrogator, ruthlessly wearing down suspects until they confess. An instructor at the Stasi academy, he trains future agents always to be on guard. ""The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation,"" he instructs his students. ""The enemies of the state are arrogant. Remember that. ""A humorlessly menacing man, Wiesler leads a lonely, Spartan existence in an antiseptic, sparsely furnished apartment in a concrete high-rise that houses many fellow agents. One day at the academy, his former classmate and current boss, gregarious Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), drops in with an assignment right up Wiesler's alley. One of their artists appears to be straying from the flock, and Wiesler has been assigned to watch him. However, the subject in question is no dissident, but the most celebrated playwright in East Germany, Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch)--a citizen so loyal to the Party that he believes his is ""the greatest country on earth.""Later that evening, spying from a balcony seat with opera glasses, Wiesler detects the mark of subversiveness on Dreymann's face as he watches the actors onstage performing his play. As Georg beams with proprietary approval, rising to applaud, Wiesler quietly utters to himself a one-word indictment that seals the dramatist's fate: ""Arrogant.""Georg lives with longtime companion Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck)--a radiant brunette who is as celebrated an actress as Georg is a writer (and to whom Wiesler clearly takes a fancy). While they are out of their flat, Wiesler's technical team descends upon their home, bugging the place. ""Operation Lazlo"" is now in full swing, and Wiesler and his partner monitor their subjects around the clock from the apartment building's empty attic.At first, the surveillance of Georg and Christa appears fruitless. At a dinner party they host, a hysterical theatrical colleague (Hans-Uwe Bauer), who's suffered detention and psychological torture at Berlin's infamous Hohensch&ouml;nhausen prison, accuses another director of being a Stasi informer. Georg is quick to defend the man against the accusation.Yet, through the course of his work, Wiesler makes some rather ugly discoveries about the investigation. He learns that it was ordered at the behest of national Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), a porcine bureaucrat who's extorted sexual favors from Christa under the threat of blacklisting her. Wiesler also eventually finds his friend Grubitz's schmoozing to be a cover for vicious social climbing and discovers that Grubitz is complicit with Hempf's scheme to use Stasi as a cat's paw to eliminate Georg, his romantic rival.Within Wiesler stirs a realization previously kept repressed: that his unquestioning faith in his country has enabled not his ideal of the perfect socialist state, but the hideous arrogance of avaricious thugs who run everything in the ""workers' utopia.""Where once was the heel-clicking impersonality of a robot, a conscience begins to grow. Wiesler comes to view Georg and Christa and their circle of bohemian friends not as specimens under a microscope, but as real individuals, with hopes and dreams, loves and heartbreaks. Having grown a conscience, he soon also yearns for a heart, as he silently assesses the utter emptiness of his own life.Swept up in his subjects' personal lives, Wiesler's detached spying turns into voyeurism. But it isn't a perverted voyeurism, because, for the first time, the lonely captain catches a glimpse into a world of beauty, poetry, and music that is alien to his two-dimensional existence. Sympathetic to the predicament of these enemies of the state, Wiesler begins covering for them, faking his reports, and remaining silent about Georg's gradual disillusionment with the DDR after an old director friend (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide.He overhears an argument in which Georg confronts Christa with knowledge of her affair with Hempf. Christa--already insecure about her talent--explains that she fears being blacklisted if she breaks it off. Wiesler feels compelled to protect her: He accidentally-on-purpose runs into her in a bar, pretending to be a fan, and tells her that her performances have inspired him. ""Many people love you for who you are,"" he says, sincerely. ""You are even more yourself onstage than you are in real life.""Christa dismisses his compliment, telling Wiesler he can't really know her. ""Did you know that I would sell myself for art?"" she asks. ""But you already have art,"" he counters. ""That would be a bad deal; you're a great artist.""Though his simple compassion, he gives Christa the strength to believe in herself and renounce her extorted affair with Hempf. But in doing so, Wiesler unintentionally sets into motion a nail-biting series of events that leads inexorably both to tragedy and redemption.The Lives of Others is a superb film, top-drawer in every regard. Cathartic and ennobling, it recalls Fahrenheit 451 and We the Living in its presentation of tragic heroes forced to examine their deepest-held yet deeply mistaken principles. Hagen Bogdanski's cinematography is compelling; through subtle differences in lighting he gives Silke Buhr's sets an additional dimension that places the characters in emotional context. Shot with tungsten-balanced film, Georg and Christa's incandescently-lit apartment radiates warmth; yet by capturing with daylight film the omnipresent, fluorescent-lit settings of the Stasi world, Bogdanski renders it cold and bloodless. Gabriel Yared's simple, haunting soundtrack is the perfect evocative counterpart for the action onscreen.The acting is realistic, but never naturalistic. Martina Gedeck is a pleasure to watch, not merely because of her physical beauty, but for her impressive emotional range. Ulrich Tukur's capacity to turn on a dime from regular guy to cold-blooded manipulator is simply scary. And Sebastian Koch combines a physically imposing presence with a gentle, almost fatherly manner, reminding me of a younger Rutger Hauer.But Ulrich M&uuml;he steals the show as Wiesler. I have never seen an actor convey such a broad range of feelings within such narrow parameters. Where a Pacino or a Steiger would explode with ferocity, M&uuml;he underplays, moving the audience with the sudden shift of an eyebrow, the drawing-in of a cheek muscle, or the quiet fall of a teardrop that betrays his sphinx-like faade.M&uuml;he began his acting career in communist East Germany. When government records were opened to the public after German reunification, he learned that his actress wife had been informing on him to the Stasi during the entire six years of their marriage. Clearly, he drew upon this reservoir of traumatic betrayal for this role.The Lives of Others is flawlessly crafted, completely engaging the heart and mind. Most impressive is the fact that it's Henckel von Donnersmarck's feature film debut, released while he was still at the relatively young age of 32. In a recent interview, von Donnersmarck--who saw life behind the Iron Curtain first-hand when he visited family in East Germany as a child--spelled out his thoughts on communist repression as well as independent filmmaking:""The [phrase] 'Independent film' makes sense to me only if it means that the director has full artistic control. How could a film be independent otherwise? ... I know that very well from East Germany: Until the Wall came down, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat had Final Cut on everything: novels, plays, films, even paintings. Make no mistake: hardly ever did they actually censor anything. But looking back at the art of those four decades, you can still feel the state in everything, and most of the art of that era is very impersonal and boring. Because the artists censored themselves, often without knowing it.""Imagine my surprise, then, when the PC crowd at the recent Academy Awards ceremony--who feted environmental scam-artist Al Gore for his global warming crock-umentary--also bestowed the Best Foreign Language Film award upon The Lives of Others, rather than upon heavily favored Pan's Labyrinth. (I think Lives deserved the nod for Best Motion Picture overall, but I'm not unhappy that the Academy gave that award to director Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a consolation prize for snubbing him so many years.)This cinematic masterpiece is a cause for celebration. Rarely has a filmmaker burst on the scene in such total command of his material. As a directorial debut, The Lives of Others belongs in the same company as Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. I can only hope that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has a Touch of Evil yet to come.",5,The Man In the Grey Flannel Life,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,9600,"['Made', 'shoestring', 'budget', '2',

State Security begins surveillance on playwright and, on the surface at least, good socialist Georg Dreyman (Koch). But as the operation progresses, Stasi Captain Wiesler (M&uuml;he) discovers compassion in his stony soul.My Review:In the early days of modern entertainment, cinema was a new and exciting method of being amused. In those days, German filmmakers were among the most pioneering, innovative and interesting, with classic silent features like Metropolis, Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. However, a lot has occurred between then and now and the country has undergone a long period of troubled history.This compelling, if not brilliant, masterpiece is European film-making at its finest and proof of an exciting renaissance in German cinema, proof that it has never lost its touch and sense of appeal. It's apparent why The Lives Of Others is this years Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film. This piece focuses on the inevitable human tragedy at the heart of a paranoid political regime that treats everyone as a potential enemy. It contrasts the administrations success to the demising sight of a regime whose tight grip is in a chokehold around its own neck, forcing its best into exile or suicide. Where, a establishment thought it was venerating itself, has become obsessed and distrustful of its own members, it collapses on itself.In the starting days of East Germany's Ministry for State Security - 'Stasi'- had many hundreds of thousands members, who for the most part where more 'informants', ordinary members of the public were coerced into spying on their friends, family and neighbours; most through blackmail, public infringement or fear of disappearing into a forgotten cell. Alternatively, like many followers, love for the Communist system, but perhaps it's not happenstance that this story begins in the 1984.Our limelight focus is given to Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), who played the German officer in dir. Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, with flowing locks and open-necked shirts has a charismatic air that encompasses him. Koch's Dreyman is the ocular opposite of Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he), whose impassive attitude is the archetype of emotional repression. And a beautiful actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck). The film inclusively revolves around the characters bearable outlook on each other, which are hopelessly intricate and bound together and yet they barely share a scene. Good example of this inability of tolerance is sitting in an empty attic, listening to bugging devices.We get a slowly building picture that sneaks into Wiesler's exterior, as his attitude to his subject moves from disapproval to envy to compassion, a man who has sacrificed his personal life and lost a large part of it, all in service of his country that he has tried so eloquently in protecting. An adhering of his homeland and what he has had to given up. It's a truly memorable performance.Verdict:A very personal story, set against an magnanimous backdrop of politics and power games.

The movie explores many things, one of which is the pressures that can be placed upon a person, pressures that force a woman to allow herself to be raped and that force her, as the protagonist in George Orwell's 1984, to give up what she loves. It addresses also how she reacts when there are two loves in conflict with one another. It shows the depravity of men and how some try to destroy others to get what they wants, a woman and a higher level job.

I can't help but think that maybe they were applauding its sentiments rather than the actual film, for I found it a bit dreary and uninvolving. Much like life in Communist Germany. Bureaucratic terror makes ofr bad film, and though we see the care and concern that went into Communist rule, it is dull. Mona Charen wrote, ""Quick: try to think of a single movie about the horrors of Stalinism. This is not a failure of imagination. This is moral meltdown."" Here's one, Mona, for this movie documents the horrors of post-Stalin East Germany with a beauty that is doubly effective. If you've seen films like The Decalogue, you've witnessed the shoddy Communist architecture, the lack of supplies in the shops, the quiet terror that governed normal life, the grubby and shabby and second rate that covered every aspect of life. But the protagonists of ""The Lives of Others"" aren't lacking in material things. The apartments are charming, the liquor seems to flow freely, the jazz is well-played, and no one looks hungry or cold or weary. What they lack are the all the little things that make life free, and without freedom, the spit and polish is meaningless. Even those successfully clawing their way up the bureaucratic ladder, which is the only one that matters, live in fear that one misjudgment will have them standing against a wall.Yet our hero, who learns to defy the system and stand up for right, is remarkably ineffectual. I was never surprised by his actions, and when he finally defies his superiors, sacrificing his career to do so, though we applaud his heroism, we do it politely, not wildly. The man he saves is not much either, and the conflicted girlfriend becomes mere plot fodder.The extras are the same old ""how much this meant"" and ""how hard we worked"" and ""how perceptive, yet humble, we are"" with the self-effacing chuckle to provide verisimilitude. The deleted scenes were well chosen; unnecessarily reinforcing the cold sterility of the protagonist's life.

""The Lives of Others"" draws our attention to the small acts of oppression and resistance, cowardice and bravery that made up the lives of ordinary people during this sad era.Grim-faced Hauptmann Wiesler (brilliantly played by Ulrich M&uuml;he ) is the chief of surveillance for the Stasi, the East German secret police. He is a serious and efficient true believer in the socialist state, devoted to catching and punishing those whose ardor for the government was insufficient. Eternally suspicious (usually for good reasons) he is given the job of surveilling Georg Dreyman, a successful playwright whose popularity in the West makes him suspect. But the corruption of GDR officials eats at him, as does his attraction to the beauty of the playwright's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Monitoring bugs planted in the playwright's apartment, he gains a peephole into the tortured world of artists under pressure form government to conform. Listening in on careful conversations and lovemaking, Wiesler begins to compromise his hard-line stance, getting caught up in the same skein of lies and evasions that has caught his targets.The film is a masterwork of understatement, and intelligent look at a totalitarian system that controls less by outright violence than by threats of lost opportunities to attend college or work at one's chosen occupation.

Yes, it is a dramatization. No, the Stasi did not lavish two or more full time agents on a relatively minor dissident like the playwright here, Georg Dreyman. Yes, Communist bureaucrats did destroy the lives of others, as the Minister of Culture does here in pursuit of Dreymans girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland.The hero is Hauptmann Wiesler, a Stasi Colonel. Tasked to nail Dreyman for something, anything, Wiesler becomes disillusioned as he realizes that his venal boss is so willing to destroy lives in order to curry favor with his higher-ups. Wiesler becomes sympathetic to his intended prey, which is unlikely to have happened in the real German Democratic Republic worker's paradise.Bit by bit, Wiesler becomes a subversive himself as he discovers his own humanity.The cat-and-mouse game between hunted and hunter, state servant and obsequious bureaucrat builds to somewhat predictable, but still suspenseful climax, as the Communist bureaucrats are flummoxed.The end of the film plays out against the fall of the Wall and the dissolution of the German Communist state. Wiesler's Stasi is no more. The corrupt Communist leaders become ordinary citizens, stripped of their powers over the lives of others.

1066214,A1493DD8LRGOKC,B000OVLBGC,J. Kim,"[5, 5]","""The Lives of Others"" is the best film I've seen in the last decade. Possibly in my life. And it's in German. This is the single most powerful, profound and complete commentary on how a government not only governs people--it determines the course of their lives, pursuits, even their thoughts--that I've ever seen. It is a treasure, and I can't even pronounce half the names of the characters properly.I can't think of many other movies it resembles. The director mentions Dr. Zhivago in the commentary, though only as an example of a similar genre (both are historical fiction). Maybe Reds, or The Conversation.  In the world of literature, fans of Milan Kundera and Thomas Mann will be kindred to this film; it strikes a similar political-social tone, asks those Big Questions, and delves into how our daily expectations (of which politics are inextricably tied) affect who we are.  And, at the same time, it lays bare the lies of fascism--of any system that claims the choices we make don't matter.Set in East Germany, the main characters (the late Ulrich M&uuml;he, playing the spy HGW, most of all) are condemned to be human--that is, to have free will and be aware of it--in a world where State power is arbitrary, rights imagined, and the moral order absolutely equivocal.  In short, to possess life when life itself is superfluous, a life that exists for the state, and never the other way around.But this is far more than a political think-piece, it is a genuine edge-of-your-seat thriller. The plot is remarkably well-paced, and strikes a perfect balance of deliberate stillness and action-oriented coincidence. Lots of moving parts, but they work together well and, ultimately, believably.In fact, some of the most harrowing parts of the plot, about a spy (M&uuml;he) monitoring the lives of a writer, Georg (Sebastian Koch), and his actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck), mirror M&uuml;he's real life. In the terrific director's commentary, Henckel von Donnersmarck tells us that M&uuml;he himself discovered, after the wall fell, that several of his fellow actors were spies planted by the Stasi, and his own wife (and mother of his child) was an informant against him and his friends for 6 years. I don't know how his own history affected him while filming, all I can say is, M&uuml;he delivers one of the most layered, subtle and compelling performances I've ever seen, and his death breaks my heart because it reflects an immeasurable loss of talent, experience and humanity.The entire cast shines: in sensual vulnerability (Gedeck's Christa is incredible), comedy (Udo), even in alarming dourness (Georg's neighbor).  There are white hats (Georg and his brave friends), and black hats (the slimey Minister) that drive the action along, but it is really the people who are far from heroic, yet who have, at times, ""truly heard this music"" (HGW, Christa)--they are the ones who make this film so indelibly rich and fulfilling.  Condemned to make impossible choices, they don't always act honorably--and you can't take your eyes off them for a second.In addition to the superb director's commentary, the DVD includes a 30-min interview with the director, a 20-min ""making of"" featurette, and several deleted scenes.  Subtitles can be turned off, or turned on in English, French or Spanish.",5,"""Can anyone who has heard this music--I mean truly heard it--really be a bad person?""",1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,3301,"['Lives', 'Others', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'decade', 'Possibly', 'life', 'German', 'single', 'most', 'powerful', 'profound', 'complete', 'commentary', 'how', 'government', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'course', 'lives', 'pursuits', 'even', 'thoughts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'treasure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pronounce', 'names', 'characters', 'properly.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'director', 'mentions', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'commentary', 'though', 'only', 'example', 'similar', 'genre', 'are', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Maybe', 'Reds', 'Conversation', 'world', 'literature', 'fans', 'Milan', 'Kundera', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'will', 'be', 'kindred', 'film', 'similar', 'political-social', 'tone', 'asks', 'Big', 'Questions', 'how', 'daily', 'expectations', 'politics', 'are', 'inextricably', 'tied', 'affect', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'lies', 'fascism', 'system', 'choices', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter.Set', 'East', 'Germany', 'main', 'characters', 'late', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'playing', 'spy', 'HGW', 'most', 'are', 'condemned', 'be', 'human', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'world', 'where', 'State', 'power', 'arbitrary', 'rights', 'imagined', 'moral', 'order', 'absolutely', 'equivocal', 'short', 'possess', 'life', 'when', 'life', 'superfluous', 'life', 'state', 'never', 'other', 'way', 'far', 'more', 'political', 'think-piece', 'genuine', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'plot', 'remarkably', 'well-paced', 'perfect', 'balance', 'deliberate', 'stillness', 'action-oriented', 'coincidence', 'Lots', 'moving', 'parts', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'ultimately', 'believably.In', 'fact', 'most', 'harrowing', 'parts', 'plot', 'spy', 'M', 'uuml', 'monitoring', 'lives', 'writer', 'Georg', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'mirror', 'M', 'uuml', 'real', 'life', 'terrific', 'director', 'commentary', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'M', 'uuml', 'discovered', 'wall', 'fell', 'several', 'fellow', 'actors', 'were', 'spies', 'planted', 'Stasi', 'own', 'wife', 'mother', 'child', 'was', 'informant', 'friends', '6', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'own', 'history', 'affected', 'filming', 'can', 'say', 'M', 'uuml', 'one', 'most', 'layered', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'death', 'breaks', 'heart', 'immeasurable', 'loss', 'talent', 'experience', 'humanity.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'shines', 'sensual', 'vulnerability', 'Gedeck', 'Christa', 'incredible', 'comedy', 'Udo', 'even', 'alarming', 'dourness', 'Georg', 'neighbor', 'are', 'white', 'hats', 'Georg', 'brave', 'friends', 'black', 'hats', 'slimey', 'Minister', 'drive', 'action', 'really', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'heroic', 'yet', 'who', 'have', 'times', 'truly', 'heard', 'music', 'HGW', 'Christa', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'indelibly', 'rich', 'fulfilling', 'Condemned', 'make', 'impossible', 'choices', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'act', 'honorably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'second.In', 'addition', 'superb', 'director', 'commentary', 'DVD', '30-min', 'interview', 'director', '20-min', 'making', 'featurette', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'turned', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish']",N/A

Georg Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch) is a successful, apolitical playwright. He's a friend of the Ministry of Culture, which supports him as one of the few examples of a respected artist flourishing in the repressive regime.  Ulrich Muhe is an idealistic Stasi (secret police) captain, who believes that the ministry is the ""sword and shield"" of the government, and a passing suspicion of his leads to full blown surveillance of Dreyman.What starts off as a story of artistic oppression, however, rapidly becomes the story of the slow disillusionment of the Captain. Muhe has an amazingly expressive face, and in close-ups of him listening to conversations in Dreyman's apartment, he manages, without barely changing expression, to communicate his slowly dawning horror at what he's been told to do.  He begins to fabricate reports to protect Dreyman, who lives in blissful ignorance of the danger he's in. Martina Gedeck, in the role of Dreyman's lover, is a famous actress, but lacks confidence in her talent and fears above all not being able to work. She knows she is weak, knows that under pressure she will betray anyone, and she's wonderful in her portrayal of a quite ordinary person who inevitably becomes part of the state mechanisms of oppression.This film is painful to watch, despite the redemptive ending, and as much as we know about Communist regimes, it always comes as a shock when we see it close up and real. There's no torture and violence here, just the slow grinding down of the human spirit.

It is a stark reminder of how precious freedom is and how societies can change almost without notice.

Played by the excellent Ulrich Muhe, Wiesler is initially a hardline socialist ideologue, but- through his constant eavesdropping- begins to sympathize with his subjects, to the point where he alters his reports to his superiors in order to protect them.  Wiesler's change of heart is further helped along by the frequent corruption he witnesses among his colleagues, as they use their political power not to further the socialist cause but to advance their careers and even remove romantic rivals.Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck keeps things moving along and involving, and is thankfully not one of those directors who thinks he has to mirror the drab lives of Cold War-era Eastern Europe with drab visuals.  Here the colors are deep, resonant, and quite beautiful, yet still somehow keeping with the melancholy nature of the film.  I was pleased to see him mention this very aim- his desire to avoid the dull look of past films with a similar setting- during an interview in the DVD's special features section.  But I shouldn't have been surprised, as good work doesn't happen by accident.  I also liked that the engaging von Donnersmarck is quite unpretentious.  He enthusiastically talks, for example, about how the Indiana Jones movies have a unique color palette to underscore their flavor and how he wanted to use their example to create his own color palette to underscore his own themes.""The Lives of Others"" is the serious, worthy film I expected it to be.

Binder ""BookInhaler""","[1, 1]","When the Berlin wall fell, chaos ensued and the East German people were shocked by the number of Stasi agents and pawns (up to 500,000 of them) who had compiled notes, photos, and both audio and video surveillance on them.  This movie ends shortly after the Wall came down.  However most of the action ensues in 1984 (a hat-tip to the Orwell novel) when a horny GDR official wants more sex from a prominent actress and &#34;suggests&#34; that she and her lover be thoroughly monitored to ensure allegiance to the GDR and hopefully provides said official with more leverage with the actress..  Thus a loyal Stasi soldier is put in charge of watching and listening to the writer and the actress as they live out their lives. It is the man who is &#34;Big Brother&#34; in this case who finds himself living vicariously through the couple.  Consequences for both watched and watcher ensue that are so human you forget this is a movie and you believe these people are real.Yes, the dialogue is German and subtitles are necessary but you do not find them annoying because you are thrust into the moment...there is sex without being gratuitous.  We get the chance to view the life that was 1984 in Communist GDR in this artful documentary-style film.  So powerful and so pitiful and absolutely unforgettable!Note: West Germans were appalled at the number of two-cycle Trabant autos that came across the border and would often give them a swift kick (which would often put a hole in the poorly-made GDR vehicles).  East Germans came to Stasi headquarters to view the records that had been compiled about them.  The Stasi began to shred documents when the wall fell, but there were so many and the fear of being beaten or even killed by the public caused them to abandon the records building and seek anonymity.  The GDR would use friends and family and lovers to report on each other.

No doubt it is artistic, subtly played with the minutiae of detail, but I was overwhelmed by the monotonous drone of the narration (in English). slowness of the plot, browns and greens in every scene.  If you have insomnia this is the movie to put you to sleep.Set in East Berlin, Germany in the year 1984 it runs through 1991.  The spy is the center of the movie.  His acting is minimal so the audience projects what is going on in his mind.  The writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck uses obtuse, vague, non-expressive acting from Ulrich Muhe (who plays Captain Gerd Weisler - starring role).  The narration is repetitive and confusing - you wonder if he is directing a play or listening in on other people's lives - it was not clear for some time.

The truth is that in that moment, the only people to lose anything were those in power.

Life wasn't a paradise of endless choices; instead, a person born into the GDR was given only two unenviable choices: ""play by the rules"" and lose one's soul or fight against the inhumanity of the regime and most likely lose one's life.  In either case, one could expect the Stasi to be intimately involved.""The Lives of Others"" is a movie that focuses on a writer, an actress, an interrogator policeman (HGW XX/7), an opportunistic civil servant, and a pig of a government official. The movie describes ""Operation Lazlo"" (""OV Lazlo""), a surveillance operation that takes place over approximately six months.  ""OV Lazlo"" is a corrupt operation from the start and it is the moral bankruptcy of the operation that over time causes HGW XX/7 to truly see what he had been so patriotically, though robotically, defending.  At great risk, HGW XX/7 decides to take a stand, though small it might be.  In the end, and at great loss to the writer, the actress, and HGW XX/7, the interrogator policeman's actions result in the eventual restoration of their dignity and courage.""The Lives of Others"" is a sublime masterpiece. Having served on the East German border during the Cold War, I can attest to the cruelty and blatant lies of the GDR's propaganda machine.  ""The Lives of Others"" gave me a glimpse of those unsung heroes (like HGW XX/7) I always hoped were there.  It is no longer a hope, I now know they were there doing what they could.Was kann ich sagen? Sie sind der wahre Held des Kalten Krieges.

Truth to be told, I hadn't heard his name before, but I'm certain that I won't forget it now. This film, his debut as a director, is simply exceptional. An engaging political thriller, this movie is at the same time a complex study regarding the power of choices, and the way we behave when faced to our worst fears.The story is set in East Germany in 1984, when the lack of freedom and the zeal of the Secret Police (Stasi) were pervasive. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is an agent that specializes in discovering ""traitors"", that is, those that don't agree with everything that the government says. Wiesler is very good at his job, and has no mercy for those that don't add up to his ideal of what a good socialist should be.That is probably the reason why his superior assigns him the task of of spying on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a well-known socialist playwright that is nonetheless suspicious, due to his friends. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a talented actress that loves him but has sexual trysts with a powerful government official that promises her that she will never be in the black list of artist that cannot work.As Wiesler learns more about the couple, thanks to the hidden microphones his team installed in their apartment, he starts warming towards them. He even protects them when Dreyman becomes actively involved in ""subversive"" activities, as a reaction to the suicide of a friend that had been blacklisted. But how far will Wiesler risk himself? And can human beings really change?Strangely enough, ""The lives of others"" tackles those difficult questions in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired, and makes you think almost involuntarily about many more that have to do with them. On the whole, I must say that I cannot recommend this film strongly enough.

1066247,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B000OVLBGC,Medusa,"[3, 4]","Other reviewers did a great job of telling the story of this fabulous work; simply an East German Stasi officer (Ulrich Muhe) goes through awakening and transformation while spying on a successful author (Sebastian Koch) and his actress/girlfriend (Martina Gedack).I don't have much to enhance the retelling of the story.  I found out by reading other reviews that Florien Hinkle von Donnersmarck is a first time director, which added to my fascination with this collectively successful work.Aside from the magnificent performance by Ulrich Muhe, whose death is a big loss to cinema every where, I could not help but notice the smart selection of actors. Koch and Gedack are both attractive people who actually know how to act, which is a real change from the usual Hollywood package of beauty and scant talent. Cars, furniture, interrogation room and even monitoring equipment comfortably belonged to the era of the movie (5 years before the fall of Berlin Wall). I was amazed how similar the electrical wiring of the door bells to those in other parts of the world were totalitarian governments ruled.Other reviewers understandably noted some unrealistic points, for instance, if Weisler/Ulrich Muhe was such a good person, he would not be a Stasi officer to start with, or how impossible it is to get away with what he did under such an oppressive regimen. I, on the other hand, think it is very understandable for somebody experienced with the system to know how to clean up after him self. The character, also, showed a loyal honest belief in the system that he swore to protect in addition to his strict and semi/robotic professionalism. Weisler's transformation did not materialize out of no where; he unlike his school friend/boss chose to be an educator(or so he thought) in the Stasi academy, He was opposed to spying on people for reasons other than protecting the system, and he also longed for love and passion (even with a prostitute). Weisler simply is every person, with good and bad qualities, who has the courage to question himself and make choices. In reality, similar totalitarian governments would not even try to dig for evidence against Dreyman, they could simply have him vanish, without explanation, to some prisons (hint, hint).Irrespective of the director and writer's vision, I'm still saddened by how similar governments around the world pilfer good ideas and transform them into their own corrupt systems. Stasi was the East German name of a sick system that has different names in different parts of our world. If only Marx knew how his ideas would be used to help one group enslave another. If only we all understood that books and religions can be used to enslave us as well as free us.I'm amazed by this movie, what adds to my amazement is how much this master piece has been understood and appreciated by so many people.

Early on in this fascinating, superior film, Gerd arrives home from a hard day of spying on his fellow East Germans and prepares a meal: microwaved white rice onto which he squeezes tomato paste from a tube. This scene, in its spare, workmanlike manner sets the course and adjusts the sights of this film: the unremarkable, out of hate and jealousy assigned to bring down those deemed different, those deemed remarkable, those deemed talented. Weisler is the perfect Stasi automaton: a socialist monk with ice-cold eyes and an incorruptible true believer's faith in the system he has sworn to defend against ""enemies of socialism"" no matter where he finds them.""The Lives of Others"" begins in 1984 a particularly Orwellian date and 5 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Weisler is invited to a night of theater by his school friend and boss Colonel Grubitz (a slimy bureaucrat performance by Ulrich Tukor) for a performance of a play written by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and starring Dreyman's live in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck from ""Mostly Martha""). Dreyman is tall, handsome, dresses in colors other than grey and Christa-Maria is wondrously gorgeous and a great actress to boot.As Weisler watches Christa-Maria on stage he also scopes in on Dreyman, via his opera binoculars, watching Christa-Maria with love and admiration. The look of distrust and envy in Wailer's eyes is frightening: his eyes widen, squint and widen again. What does Weisler see or sense on that triumphant, for Dreyman and Sieland, night?

1066252,A7FJVRLMG5BF9,B000OVLBGC,Michael JR Jose,"[2, 4]","This is a film about the socialist notion of social engineering, and those who know best of all, the artistic set, that the soul is not engineered but is a growing thing that is fed when it hungers and given water when it thirsts. Consequently, individuals are what socialism fears most, and must oppose until reality bites and the real people who are not cloned engineered things finally rebel. And so it is that the artists, (and the priests, and the peace activists), are the most surveilled of all people in the socialist state of East Germany, just a few years before the Berlin Wall was pulled down in 1989.The key player is a tragic and lonely figure, a middle-high ranking Stasi (secret police) official who is a trainer of interrogators. There is a fascinating scene where he gives a lecture on how to tell whether a suspect is lying -- this in a state based and maintained on untruth. However, it is hard to like this poor fellow who has sold his soul for slightly better standard of GDR life and the privilige of being the spy rather than the spied upon. The whole film is subtexted by the stifled cry for freedom that emanates from the silent sufferers of communism. The artists are the muffled voice of the sufferers, and hence the supposed faithful socialist playwright who is the last of the artists to not be surveilled must also be monitored. After all, if he is a real playwright, he cannot be an 'engineer of the soul', a boilerplate writer. For there is no such thing: Lenin's metaphor of making people out of dead metal is a false metaphor, false and cold like his philosophy.The Stasi spy too is lonely and cold of heart. The playwright is full of life and enjoys his relationships to the full. The Stasi spy looks on in envy at the literature the playwright enjoys (Brecht), at the actress who is his lover, and compares them in his heart to the state-provided prostitute he must enjoy for a few minutes, and the blank walls of his apartment. To his eternal credit he finds that he likes these warm-hearted subversives, and, when they do finally become outrightly subversive, he not only does not report them, but actively protects them.The drama heightens around the writing of not a play, but an article for the West German magazine 'Stern', on the state-of-the-nation expos&eacute; concerning the frightening suicide rate in the GDR. The playwrights friend is one of the many to kill himself and go unrecorded as a suicide. The Socialist state has statistics on everything except suicide, which they stopped recording seven years before in 1977.

The film is set in East Germany during 1984 and Stasi (i.e. secret police) Captain Gerd Weisler is assigned to monitor the activities of a playwright and his actress girlfriend due to their being suspected of associating with dissidents.Weisler later starts to question his mission and the communist ideals he subscribes to when he finds out that he is spying on the couple in question to satisfy the desires of a government Minister who lusts after the playwright's girlfriend. The Minister wants the playwright out of the way so he can have the actress for himself.This movie is very well done and it is also an indictment of altruism by implication not only due to its thrashing the idea that it is the duty of people to live for the sake of a cause (in this case communism) but the movie also shows what totalitarianism is in theory and in practice.Weisler's daily monitoring of the couple begins to affect him. Slowly, the cold, calculating personality he acquired from his job serving the East German state peels off when Weisler hears the warmth and humanity that the couple's art lends to them. Weisler becomes more human and as a result makes a series of ethical decisions that he hadn't thought of in the past.This isn't a suspense or thriller in the sense of a James Bond film since it relies more on character development than car chases, respectfully.

In 1984, the Stasi, or East German Secret Police, intend to know everything about every citizen and are free to accuse and imprison without evidence in the defense of the Socialist State. A staunch proponent of these values, Captain Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his career-minded superior Lt. Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to wiretap the apartment of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). The Operation is instigated by a powerful politician, Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who desires Dreyman's actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).""The Lives of Others"" depicts a touchy subject in recent German history, as hundreds of thousands of people in the GRD acted as informers for the Stasi. The film takes on a different significance in the post-9/11 United States, this era of warrantless wiretaps and extensive surveillance. It reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's exceptional film ""The Conversation"", also about the effects of wiretapping on a surveillant and his subjects, released on the heels of the Watergate scandal in 1974. The torment of living under a security-obsessed regime comes across powerfully in ""The Lives of Others"". But no less powerful is the film's exploration of the economics of paranoia, when power substitutes for accomplishment and petty ambition masquerades as idealism. ""The Lives of Others"" is a beautifully crafted, personal, suspenseful story with rapier political insight. In German with subtitles.The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 7 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary. ""Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck"" (30 min) is informative.

But that's what's good in this film. It makes it a thriller.What's bad is the complete failure of the claim of realism as the details are so flawed that the entire movie is not believable. The Stasi were quite sophisticated and very advanced technologically (the scene of planting listening devices is a good illustration of that). In fact, they were so good that sometimes  they supplied equipment or even performed some operations for the KGB. But for some strange reason, in the film, they install a listening station right in the attic of the house where surveillance is conducted. Radio transmitters existed at the time! As well as tape recorders! The eavesdropping results should be taped and later analyzed by a few more agents, and only then a brief synopsis should be typed for use by high-ranking officers. And when comes an order from the minister to get the man the surveillance should be increased, it's simple logic. Instead, one of only two (2!!!) agents is taken off the 24-hour watch (though he slept at his post anyway))). I'm not going to mention all flops but only the ones closer to the end, when a compromised Wiesler is assigned the task of interrogating Christa-Maria, then he leaves shortly after to extract the typewriter, and the most amazing thing - Christa-Maria is let out and goes to Dreyman's apartment unstopped and undetected while the Stasi gets to the scene just in time to be totally fooled.

1066260,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000OVLBGC,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[0, 0]","_The Lives of Others_ (2006) is a German language film which presents a disturbing portrayal of the Communist East German state in 1984.  The film shows a society in which the government engages in constant spying on private citizens, ruthless interrogation of would-be and suspected dissenters, and a culture in which the average citizen lives in fear of being blacklisted by the powers that be and in fear of their neighbors who might snitch on them to the secret police.  The film illustrates the usual communist fear of intellectuals and artists (""arrogant types who need to be monitored"") and the constant need of the artist or intellectual to conform to the dictates of party ideology in order to avoid being blacklisted or worse.  The film also shows the corruption of the East German government officials, as they use women as prostitutes (often against their will), engage in petty maneuverings, and must constantly suck up to the higher-ups or ""bigwigs"" in the party in order to obtain favors or promotions.  The film also shows the inability of East Germans to leave their country (with very few exceptions) and the manner in which the party has utterly sucked the very life out from the people through the Stasi secret police.  In sum, the film shows a surveillance society at its most Orwellian under a corrupt and evil government which oppresses the people.  Such was the government of East Germany during the time period that this film is supposed to take place._The Lives of Others_ focuses on the life and career of the playwright Georg Dreyman, who remains among the only playwrights still deemed sufficiently loyal to the regime to be allowed to produce their plays.  While watching a play of Dreyman, the Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler concludes that Dreyman is a ""dangerous type"" and thus deserves to be spied on.  Wiesler sets up a series of microphones in Dreyman's apartment and in that manner listens in on him and his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria.  The goings on of Dreyman remain relatively mundane and there is little evidence of subversive activity.  However, it is while at a party that Dreyman encounters his old friend and fellow playwright Jerska who has been blacklisted.  Further, it is revealed that Dreyman's girlfriend is being forced to have sex with the Chairman Hempf.  Dreyman remains loyal to the party until one day Jerska commits suicide which along with his girlfriend's affairs pushes him over the edge.  Together with his friends they decide to publish a report on suicide within the GDP (East Germany) and sneak this report over to the West.  The rest of the movie reveals how this conspiracy plays out and the role of Wiesler becomes increasingly important.  Surprisingly, Wiesler may not be the evil man and loyal member of the Stasi that we had originally suspected him of being.  To see how this plays out in the film you must watch the movie.This film is an excellent movie which shows the paranoia that existed under a communist dictatorship.  The secret police rule a nation and the only way to achieve any sort of success or security is through truckling to higher powers.  As such, we see the complete demoralization of the people who are forced to live under a corrupt government and the complete failure of the communist enterprise.  This film is highly recommended to those who would consider these issues.  However, the film also reveals that even amidst such a totalitarian dictatorship there exist opportunities to display human kindness and graciousness.  As such the film may be seen as a triumph for humanity, despite the corrupting powers of governments.

I wish I could have had a chance to see it in a theater.

You pick up on one more slight gesture or one more hint of something real.I strongly recommend seeing it at least twice.

I've never been to acting school, I haven't seen much theater, and I've never tried to make a movie... heck I've never owned a video camera, but M&uuml;he meets my own personal definition of genius when it comes to acting.

Kenneth Turin1984, ring a bell? The years in Germany just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. We are taken on a ride like none other with  Capt. Gert Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a domestic surveillance specialist and interrogation expert who works for the Ministry for State Security. Professionally, he's identified only as HGW XX/7 working for Stasi. The time is grim, Capt. Wiesler dresses in gray, a trim jacket and pants, and lives a gray life. He is indoctrinated into the system and everything is for the State. The richness of life is missing, the State must know everything and your neighbors, your family may be spying on you.Capt Wielser is invited to a play by his superior, and he creates an interest in poet and playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Wiselier takes an instant dislike to him and his girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress in Dreyman's play. Soon Capt Wielser is involved in a plot to spy on the two. The Minister of Culture, or vulture in this case, has a sexual interest in Christa-Maria. Their apartment is bugged, and Capt Wiesler has taken a 12 hour shift to listen to everything that occurs. He finds a lot occurs and soon he is very interested in this couple. Some of what he finds he reports, the rest, well, Capt Wiesler becomes involved in their lives. His sense of identity becomes confused and the face of secrecy and the grayness seems to change.The score for 'The Lives of Others' is fabulous.  Gabriel Yared and his sometime orchestrator, St&eacute;phane Moucha write and play the score.  The score has delicate and luxurious melodies. Unfortunately, the score on the the CD of the same name is cut and is only thirty minutes, but it is still glorious. It matches each character and mood of the film and is haunting.The film has one of the most moving endings and as Peter Travis says,""It's an ending you don't see coming, yet it feels totally right. Von Donnersmarck, the first time Director, has crafted the best kind of movie: one you can't get out of your head.""This film won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2006.

I had hesitated to see this film at first, fearing that it would be too depressing.  True, there are dark aspects of it but the triumph of the human spirit is so bright that one leaves the theater not depressed, but inspired.  Obviously the fact that this chapter of history is still so recent adds to the impact that the movie has on us. I want to urge possible purchasers of this DVD not to steer away from it because of the grim subject matter.  We see clearly the abhorant acts of the East German Stasi and their tragic results.  But this is so much more than a political statement.  It's intensely human.  And, it's even an entertaining thriller!  The twists and turns of the plot kept me fascinated at every moment.  I did not find it at all too long.  The acting is superb.  I don't know their names, but the two male leads---the ""writer"" and the ""spy"" were perfect.  The transformation that the ""spy"" undergoes was brilliantly portrayed.  His eyes seemed even to change color from a dark steel hue in the befinning to a bright blue in the final scene---lovely! The sets were indicative of the theme of the film--the contrast between the stark and sterile apt. of the ""spy"" and the lushly colored, warmly furnished home of the ""writer.""

The acting, featuring wonderful performances by Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Muhe, is superb.  What this film conveys so well is the experience of living in a repressive and corrupt police state like the GDR.  In proportion to population, the East German State Security service (the Stasi) was impressively large and a significant fraction of the GDR's population were informants for the Stasi.The story line is clever.  A veteran Stasi operative is detailed to perform surveillance on a well known playwright.  The latter, however, is not a dissident but involved in a romance with a talented actress who is being pursued simultaneously by a powerful Minister.  The goal of the surveillance is to find something that will allow the playwright to be eliminated as a romantic rival.  Both the Stasi officer and the playwright are committed to the regime.  The movie suspensefully details their mutual disillusionment and the Stasi officer becomes emotionally involved with playwright and in love, albeit from a distance, with the actress girlfriend.  The parallelism is expanded as the Stasi officer creatively fabricates information to prevent the playwright from being jailed.The movie does a wonderful job of showing how the nature of the GDR fostered an atmosphere of constant mutual suspiscion, degrading the quality of personal life.  The ease with which the system could be exploited by the powerful is shown well also.  The multiple humiliating, and often actually degrading compromises of personal integrity and the betrayals needed to get by in the GDR are presented in a matter of fact manner that emphasizes the pervasive effects of the police state.The ending, however, is somewhat melodramatic and sentimental, which tends to underlmine the effectiveness of the film's portrayal of the GDR.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[6, 6]","The constant thought that may go through one's mind while watching THE LIVES OF OTHERS is the fear of losing the freedom to read or write regardless of what it is.  Indeed, the film resonates ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"".  The film takes place during the height of the ""Second"" Cold War in East Germany, five years before the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.  Writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck portrays the mid to late 1980s as a chilling and fearful period filled with coldness and emptiness, which is clearly displayed within the limited confines of the Eastern bloc.The premise of the film involves the conflict of freedom of expression, which is twofold.  First, the protagonists are those who create arts, and second, the antagonists are those who censorship it.  The character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muche), a Stasi or ""thought police"",turns out to be the surprising part of the film, and his colleague and boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), also a Stasi and an Orwell-like ""Big Brother"" is convincing to being the disliked character in the movie.  Hence, the turn of events, which occur during the concluding scenes make the film the most unpredictable and worth watching.  And with most foreign films, the technique of sound and silence - the expressions on the actors' faces, playwright Georg Deyman (Sebastian Koch) and actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), are highly effective in conveying a drench of irony, worry, despair, and desire for solace behind the Iron Curtain.THE LIVES OF OTHERS has a tinge of being a sanguine film.  But what it does provide is food for thought.  Undoubtedly, after watching the film, it makes one think of the things that are taken for granted, and which may easily be taken away.

1066282,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000OVLBGC,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[4, 4]","Recently there have been some great movies about WWII, but it has been a while since we saw a movie about the cold war era depicting every day lives of ordinary people in the Eastern block.  The last film I recall was adaptation of Milan Kundera's book ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"".  ""The Lives of Others"" film is the perfect display of the kinds of people who suffer the most in the totalitarian system(s) - artists, professors and students - people generally considered as too liberal in their view of the world.  In order to preserve the privilege of being able to work at all and create as an actors, directors, writers, these individuals have to either repress their true feelings about the system they live in, or pretend that the cruelty of the system isn't there.  This may be the only film that I recall that addresses the issue of routine sexual coercion women in eastern block have to face in such society by man in powerful positions. I saw this movie in the theatre and could not help myself but hear deep sighs and expressions of disbelief of having to experience the harrasment, eavesdropping, phone monitoring. But anyone who lived in Eastern Europe knows very well that these were (and still are) common practices.  What is even more frightening is that they exist even today, in the same if not worse form particularly in the Eastern European countries.  And while today's monitoring devices, and miniature cameras are certainly less conspicuous, it is the technology of 20 years ago that makes audience more aware of how brutal these practices are no matter which decades they take place in.  No, I am not going to tell you the synopsis of this movie because it would spoil it all.  But young 32 year old director of this film has captured the essence of what it is to live in the repressive systems and be (un)willing part of it.  It also gives hope that art can wake up the most human sensibilities in all of us no matter what our moral convictions are.  However, the transforming power of art, or change in general for that matter, always comes at the steep price.  Is it worth to pay such high price?  You must see the movie to make that decision yourself.

One interesting thing was that the film started in 1984 (Orwell anyone?). Most deserved winner of the Foreign Language Oscar (though I admired ""Pan's Labyrinth"" very much), there is definitely a line that needs to be crossed when dealing with man's inhumanity to man, even after the fact. Costa Gavras' ""Z"" immediately comes to mind, but here we have so much more of the human spirit, mostly from the marvelous, late Ulrich M&uuml;he as a man of conscience and a despairing realization of the ""wrong"" in which he'd been assimilated. Since this film was released so late, it's now appearing on many 2007 Best lists. It hadn't appeared in many American theatres (if any) during 2006, so maybe the late Herr M&uuml;he could be nominated. He certainly deserves it. Also wonderful are the stunning and subtle performances of Sebastian Koch & Martina Gedeck, as the couple being tormented. This is not a simple story; its complexities are immeasurable, and the absolutely brilliant director, von Donnersmarck, is so sure of his material that no nerve is left untouched.  The DVD extras are very insightful and moving. This is highly recommended.

If it doesn't work for you, then it will be long (very long), boring, and probably pointless.  That said, this movie got me big time and this appeal is more on a gut level than on an intellectual level.  My gut level response is surprising, because this is not a flashy movie with lots eye candy and exciting twists.  In fact, the whole movie is subdued (on purpose) in color and tone.Like the Stasi portrayed in the movie, Lives of Others plods along at its own pace. But with the plodding plot, there is an underlying tension that never lets up.  We start watching the movie from a naive point of view, not understanding the hidden power and ruthlessness of the Stasi.  But we learn fast.  As the movie progressions, we realize how mindless and dangerous the Stasi obsession with control and surveillance can be.Lives of Others is a tense melodrama with most of the dramatic emphasis on the characters.  There are gregarious and stoic Stasi bureaucrats doing their jobs with no regard to the people they crush.  There are also victims and there are heroes.  It was the unlikely hero that riveted me to the screen.  How does one change a lifetime of beliefs and practice to make a change?  What price does one pay for this?

I felt the oppressiveness of the system from the movie in a way that i haven't seen since reading Solzhenitsyn's ""The Gulag Archipelago"". I don't know how anyone survived those decades, let alone how any normal human contact was possible. I wonder even more how anyone in the system like the major character could move from a position of responsibility for interrogations to actively supporting a writer who writes a damning article about suicides in East Germany.The plot of the movie is actually rather straightforward and linear.A playwright, a supporter of the regime has a beautiful lover, who is a well known actress.She is blackmailed into a sexual liaison by a high ranking party member using his threats to end her career or worse.The official decides to get rid of the playwright-boyfriend using information gained from surveillance by the Stasi on their apartment.(so far sounds pretty much like David and Bathsheba, she who was the wife of Uriah)The agent assigned to the case, listens into the lives. While at the same time figures out with his immediate superior that they are being used by the official to further his sexual agenda.What happens next is that the agent covers up for the playwright's underground activities by submitting false reports that they are involved only in writing a new play, while they are actually moving towards more active resistance to the government.But the movie isn't about the plot, it is about the character development, in all four major players.the Stasi supervisor, the agent, the playwright and the actress-girlfriend.And how the system changes, distorts or reinforces each of their beliefs.The most interesting one is the agent's movement from a loyal player to a subverter of the system. What are his motivations? are they believable? how far will he go to protect these two people? will he get caught?it feels like a gripping detective story with lives on the line, with a huge rock ready to drop on anyone of them and poof--into prison.It is how they adapt to the pressures, how they continue to live with themselves and with their friends that forms the background for the character development.i love books.therefore i really liked the ending.i hope things like this occurred in East Germany, and continue to occur in all those places in the world that are not free to speak their minds and think their own thoughts, in private, and to speak them in public.thanks to the movie for a thrilling and thought provoking ride.",5,you can feel the oppressiveness of the system,1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,2503,"['What', 'powerful', 'movie', 'felt', 'oppressiveness', 'system', 'movie', 'way', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'reading', 'Solzhenitsyn', 'Gulag', 'Archipelago', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'survived', 'decades', 'let', 'alone', 'how', 'normal', 'human', 'contact', 'was', 'possible', 'wonder', 'even', 'more', 'how', 'anyone', 'system', 'major', 'character', 'could', 'move', 'position', 'responsibility', 'interrogations', 'actively', 'supporting', 'writer', 'who', 'damning', 'article', 'suicides', 'East', 'Germany.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'actually', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'linear.A', 'playwright', 'supporter', 'regime', 'beautiful', 'lover', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'actress.She', 'blackmailed', 'sexual', 'liaison', 'high', 'ranking', 'party', 'member', 'using', 'threats', 'end', 'career', 'worse.The', 'official', 'decides', 'get', 'rid', 'playwright-boyfriend', 'using', 'information', 'gained', 'surveillance', 'Stasi', 'apartment', 'so', 'far', 'pretty', 'much', 'David', 'Bathsheba', 'who', 'was', 'wife', 'Uriah', 'agent', 'assigned', 'case', 'lives', 'same', 'time', 'figures', 'out', 'immediate', 'superior', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'official', 'further', 'sexual', 'next', 'agent', 'up', 'playwright', 'underground', 'activities', 'submitting', 'false', 'reports', 'are', 'involved', 'only', 'writing', 'new', 'play', 'are', 'actually', 'moving', 'towards', 'more', 'active', 'resistance', 'government.But', 'movie', ""n't"", 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'four', 'major', 'players.the', 'Stasi', 'supervisor', 'agent', 'playwright', 'actress-girlfriend.And', 'how', 'system', 'changes', 'distorts', 'reinforces', 'beliefs.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'one', 'agent', 'movement', 'loyal', 'player', 'subverter', 'system', 'What', 'are', 'motivations', 'are', 'believable', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'protect', 'two', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'gripping', 'detective', 'story', 'lives', 'line', 'huge', 'rock', 'ready', 'drop', 'anyone', 'poof', 'prison.It', 'how', 'adapt', 'pressures', 'how', 'continue', 'live', 'friends', 'background', 'character', 'development.i', 'books.therefore', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'ending.i', 'hope', 'things', 'occurred', 'East', 'Germany', 'continue', 'occur', 'places', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'free', 'speak', 'minds', 'think', 'own', 'thoughts', 'private', 'speak', 'public.thanks', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'thought', 'provoking', 'ride']",N/A

Much of my problem stems from the fact that I don't seem to have been nearly as impressed with this movie as everyone else was; the pacing is awful, the screenplay, despite moments of brilliance, is often wooden, and the camerawork is, for the most part, uninspired. I've seen a good number of movies of this sort, most recently Sophie Scholl: The Final Days, and this one just doesn't hold up in comparison. (And really, winning the Best Foreign Film Oscar over El Laberinto del Fauno? There's really no comparison.)Ulrich Muhe, the movie's highlight, plays Gerd Wiesner, a Stasi agent in East Germany in the 1980s, who spies on other people for a living. His old school friend, Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), now a Stasi higher-up, contracts Wiesner to do surveillance on a playwright named Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his leading-lady girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Wiesner is initially confused, as Dreyman seems to be the perfect Socialist; his plays are beloved of the State, none of his writing has ever been banned, etc. But Wiesner knew from the start that Grubitz had an ulterior motive for having Dreyman watched. Resentful that his services are being used in such a way, when Wiesner finds out that Dreyman is not the upstanding citizen everyone believes, he risks it all to cover for Dreyman.The Lives of Others would probably have been a great film had von Donnersmarck (who, as everyone says, really is that good; it's impossible to tell this is the work of a first-time director, though he might have been served by hiring a better cinematographer) known whether he wanted to make a spy thriller, an existential drama, or a love story. Now, we all know it's possible to combine the three and come up with a winner (the Bourne movies, and about a quarter of Hitchcock's output, would qualify), but-- and I realize I'm very much in the minority on this-- I don't think they work here. Von Donnersmarck and editor Patricia Rommel failed to give the movie the pace required for a spy thriller. The characters are certainly deep enough for an existential drama, but in achieving that depth, the love story often gets shunted out of the way. Then suddenly someone realizes what's going on and some other portion of the plot thread gets picked up, and all the work of pushing the existential drama to the fore gets dumped. Von Donnersmarck, obviously, is not a juggler.Now, despite all that I'm saying, I did enjoy the film somewhat. I just couldn't get past its flaws the way everyone else seemed to. ** ",3,Pacing problems derail otherwise excellent thriller.,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,2677,"['Lives', 'Others', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', '2006', 'Been', 'mulling', 'one', 'over', 'quite', 'while', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'review', 'Much', 'problem', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'impressed', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'pacing', 'awful', 'screenplay', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'often', 'wooden', 'camerawork', 'most', 'part', 'uninspired', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'number', 'movies', 'sort', 'most', 'recently', 'Sophie', 'Scholl', 'Final', 'Days', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'comparison', 'really', 'winning', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'El', 'Laberinto', 'del', 'Fauno', 'really', 'comparison', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'movie', 'highlight', 'Gerd', 'Wiesner', 'Stasi', 'agent', 'East', 'Germany', '1980s', 'who', 'other', 'people', 'living', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'Anton', 'Grubitz', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'now', 'Stasi', 'higher-up', 'contracts', 'Wiesner', 'do', 'surveillance', 'playwright', 'named', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'leading-lady', 'girlfriend', 'Christa-Maria', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'Wiesner', 'initially', 'confused', 'Dreyman', 'be', 'perfect', 'Socialist', 'plays', 'are', 'beloved', 'State', 'none', 'writing', 'ever', 'been', 'banned', 'etc', 'Wiesner', 'knew', 'start', 'Grubitz', 'had', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'having', 'Dreyman', 'watched', 'Resentful', 'services', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'such', 'way', 'when', 'Wiesner', 'out', 'Dreyman', 'not', 'upstanding', 'citizen', 'everyone', 'cover', 'Dreyman.The', 'Lives', 'Others', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'who', 'everyone', 'really', 'good', 'impossible', 'tell', 'work', 'first-time', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'hiring', 'better', 'cinematographer', 'wanted', 'make', 'spy', 'thriller', 'existential', 'drama', 'love', 'story', 'Now', 'know', 'possible', 'combine', 'three', 'come', 'up', 'winner', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'quarter', 'Hitchcock', 'output', 'would', 'qualify', 'realize', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'minority', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'work', 'here', 'Von', 'Donnersmarck', 'editor', 'Patricia', 'Rommel', 'failed', 'give', 'movie', 'pace', 'required', 'spy', 'thriller', 'characters', 'are', 'certainly', 'deep', 'enough', 'existential', 'drama', 'achieving', 'depth', 'love', 'story', 'often', 'shunted', 'way', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'someone', 'what', 'going', 'other', 'portion', 'plot', 'thread', 'picked', 'up', 'work', 'pushing', 'existential', 'drama', 'fore', 'dumped', 'Von', 'Donnersmarck', 'obviously', 'not', 'juggler.Now', ""'m"", 'saying', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'somewhat', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'flaws', 'way', 'everyone', 'else', 'seemed', '**']",N/A

1066290,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000OVLBGC,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best cold war films I have ever seen.  It is about an expert Stasi officer, who genuinely believes in his mission - to find traitors to the socialist ideal - and yet he is having doubts about his current mission.  I am going to try hard not to ruin the viewing experience of others with spoilers.The man he must ""ruin"" is a greatly talented and officially nurtured writer, enmeshed in a situation that he is too naive to completely fathom.  As the pressure builds, everyone is forced to take a stand and to act.  The results are as terrible as they are unexpected, yet completely believable and moving, even tragic.  There is nothing in this part that is truly new - it is a drama that has been done countless times, however first rate this production.What is truly original, in my viewing, is the aftermath.  The wall falls, the files of the stasi files are opened to researchers.  After a chance meeting with a former bitter antagonist, the writer goes to explore what is written about his life, who betrayed him, who protected him.  It is devastating and inspiring all at once, a moment that crystalizes a life.  I was watching it with my daughter and it moved me to tears, at all the people who had suffered in the east, at the brutal movement of history that crushed individuals, ended relationships, and corrupted through fear, ambition, and abuse of power.  Afterwards, the future opens, with the continuance of life and even some forgiveness.This is a truly great film experience, the panorama of history before our eyes.

1066292,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000OVLBGC,Robert Moore,"[3, 8]","While I will try to say more about the movie than one previous reviewer who cautioned viewers to not read reviews before seeing this wonderful film, I am going to avoid giving too much detail. Much of the joy in watching this film is in not knowing what is going to happen next. I will merely say in regard to the story that it was not at all what I was expecting. I won't say what I was expecting so I won't give anything away. All I will reveal is that it is set in 1984-85 in East Berlin and concerns the surveillance of a celebrated writer by the state police who has not previously been suspected of any political disloyalty.Several things make this film stand out. The script is outstanding, with lots of twists and turns and surprises. But never do you get the sense that writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is ever being merely clever or that his intent is to build up the viewer's expectations merely to defeat them. Rather, he is telling what is a genuinely surprising story. Just as fine as the wonderful story, however, are the several great performances, above all that of Ulrich M&uuml;he in a magnificently understated performance as the officer in charge of the surveillance of the writer. It is a quietly powerful performance, but even though M&uuml;he expresses only the minutest emotion throughout, we never are left wondering what he is doing or what his motives are. It is a truly masterful job of acting. Very nearly as good as M&uuml;he is Sebastian Koch as the writer Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland. Though there are many other excellent performances as well, throughout I was constantly focused on three exceptional performances.The only thing negative that I can bring myself to say about this wonderful film is that I remain somewhat baffled that it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film over PAN'S LABYRINTH. THE LIVES OF OTHERS is unquestionably one of the best movies made in the world in 2006, but PAN'S LABYRINTH will almost certainly be recalled as the one of the foremost films of the decade. But this has always been a category with curious results, results even more curios than those in the English language categories. CITY OF GOD was not even nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2004 Oscars, even though it was far and away the most acclaimed film of the year. But I propose here that we take a more positive view of things. Although I believe that PAN'S LABYRINTH is the more unforgettable and moving film of the two, it is wonderful that two such remarkable films were made in the same year. At a time when American films continue to decline in quality, it was encouraging to see two foreign film that were both clearly superior to any of the five American films nominated for Best Picture.

1066293,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000OVLBGC,Roland E. Zwick,"[28, 35]","*possible spoilers*It seems somehow appropriate that ""The Lives of Others"" should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life.  The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI.  As self-appointed ""voices of the people,"" artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen.  As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety.  Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists.  Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman`s beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture).  To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day.  After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.Within this historical context, ""The Lives of Others"" provides a chilling portrait of what life is like under a totalitarian regime.  It shows the dehumanization that occurs when freedom of thought and expression become anathema to a society, and the untenable paranoia that develops when one must live in constant fear of betrayal from stranger, acquaintance and loved-one alike.Interestingly, the two main characters in the film share very little screen time together, yet they are intricately linked in their roles of the observer and the observed.  Dreyman is a man willing to go along with a system he knows to be wrong, partly out of fear, but partly too out of a sincere belief that nothing he can do, even as an artist, will ever really change things.  It isn't until a close friend of his, a ""blacklisted"" theater director, decides to take his own life rather than to live with the oppression that Dreyman wakes up from his lethargy and takes a proactive stance against injustice.Wiesler has a less clearly defined moment of epiphany, and this strikes me as being one of the very few weaknesses of this otherwise extraordinarily fine film.  If Wiesler has a literary antecedent, it would have to be Guy Montag, the fire-starting protagonist in Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451.""  Like Montag, Wiesler is a gung-ho advocate of a regressive regime, eagerly performing his duty of stamping out what he believes to be seditious and subversive elements that threaten the stability of the society.  But whereas Montag has his unmistakably paradigm-shifting moment while reading ""David Copperfield,"" Wiesler has no comparable event to explain his 180-degree turnabout in outlook.  He just suddenly goes from being Dreyman's bitterest antagonist to his greatest protector and champion without a whole lot of explanatory detail to go along with the change.  It's difficult for us to accept the fact that a man would suddenly turn his back on everything he's dedicated his life to without at least a vaguely articulated reason for doing so.As Wiesler, the late great actor, Ulrich Muhe, leaves an indelible mark in his portrayal of a man whose cold, emotionless surface may be more the product of his environment than a reflection of the true man at the core of his being.  In a largely nonverbal role, Muhe is forced to convey much of his character's thoughts, feelings and emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips.  Sebastian Koch brings a remarkable subtlety to the role of the writer, while Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend, and Ulrich Tukur as Wiesler's hardnosed superior deliver excellent performances as well.In her filmmaking debut, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings both a stunning attention to detail and a strong sense of atmosphere to her work.  Given the repressive environment she is portraying, Donnersmarck wisely holds back on delivering grand sentimental gestures for most of the film - which makes the climactic moments all the more heart-wrenching and devastating when they finally arrive.In this age of ramped-up fear and paranoia - and the increased scrutiny and surveillance that come along with them - ""The Lives of Others"" serves as a stark reminder of the things we lose when we give up our freedoms.",4,fine drama despite a gaping hole in the screenplay,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,4848,"['*possible', 'spoilers*It',

1066294,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000OVLBGC,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 1]","""The Lives of Others"" follows the quietly exploits of an unlikely hero.Georg Dreyman is a brilliant writer, and intelligent enough to think for himself in a regime that prizes the appearance of such qualities, but moves to suppress it nonetheless.  But Dreyman is not the hero of this tale.Hauptman Gerd Weisler is both an enforcer for the GDR's notorious secret police - ""The Stasi"" - and a dedicated believer in the state.  Luckily for Dreyman, Weisler proves to be one of the few true believers left alive in the GDR.  A genius in the art of interrogation, Weisler is fixed for a career above those relegated (virtually imprisoned) in a cellar steam-opening envelopes.  When Weisler receives orders to surveille the author, he finds little of concern - the brilliant Dreyman proves no threat to the sanctity of the regime.  Instead, Weisler learns that his superiors' interests in the playright stem from less-than purely socialist motives.  Walking a tightrope, Weisler his own venal bosses to protect the playright without revealing his role.""Others"" is such a brilliant and understated film for several reasons.  Weisler becomes a hero, while preserving his outward appearance as an arm of the dreaded Stasi.  Even late in the film, in a scene where he interrogates Dreyman's actress lover, you never lose sense of the unimaginable pressure and terror he exerts on his ""victims"".  Most stories reserve the glory for the beautiful, the epic and the undeniably valorous - but ""Others"" reveals the heroic role that even the ugly, the hated and the craven must thanklessly play in the battle for freedom.",4,The Triumph of the Banal,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1606,"['Lives', 'Others', 'quietly', 'unlikely', 'hero.Georg', 'Dreyman', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'think', 'regime', 'appearance', 'such', 'qualities', 'moves', 'suppress', 'nonetheless', 'Dreyman', 'not', 'hero', 'tale.Hauptman', 'Gerd', 'Weisler', 'enforcer', 'GDR', 'notorious', 'secret', 'police', 'Stasi', 'dedicated', 'believer', 'state', 'Luckily', 'Dreyman', 'Weisler', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'true', 'believers', 'left', 'alive', 'GDR', 'genius', 'art', 'interrogation', 'Weisler', 'fixed', 'career', 'relegated', 'virtually', 'imprisoned', 'cellar', 'steam-opening', 'envelopes', 'When', 'Weisler', 'orders', 'surveille', 'author', 'little', 'concern', 'brilliant', 'Dreyman', 'threat', 'sanctity', 'regime', 'Instead', 'Weisler', 'superiors', 'interests', 'playright', 'stem', 'less-than', 'purely', 'socialist', 'motives', 'Walking', 'tightrope', 'Weisler', 'own', 'venal', 'bosses', 'protect', 'playright', 'revealing', 'role', 'Others', 'brilliant', 'understated', 'film', 'several', 'reasons', 'Weisler', 'hero', 'preserving', 'outward', 'appearance', 'arm', 'dreaded', 'Stasi', 'Even', 'late', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Dreyman', 'actress', 'lover', 'never', 'lose', 'sense', 'unimaginable', 'pressure', 'terror', 'victims', 'Most', 'stories', 'reserve', 'glory', 'beautiful', 'epic', 'undeniably', 'valorous', 'Others', 'heroic', 'role', 'even', 'ugly', 'hated', 'craven', 'must', 'thanklessly', 'play', 'battle', 'freedom']",N/A
1066295,A387BD735MI50R,B000OVLBGC,R. Schultz,"[3, 4]","This movie provides an absorbing view into the mechanics of a police state. It's no extravagant, surreal forecast such as the ones you get in ""Brave New World"" or ""1984."" ""Lives"" does take place in 1984, but that is pure coincidence. That just happened to be one of the most repressive years in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), among the many years East Germany was cemented into the USSR's Communist bloc.If anything, this movie stands as a poignant illustration of Hannah Arendt's famous quote about ""the banality of evil."" The damage that is done here is done as a result of everyone simply going about his everyday business. We see people rising or falling in the ranks of the Stasi (the East German secret police) based on how obviously loyal they are to the Party, and how well they routinely carry out their Party duties.For many, those duties involve keeping constant tabs on others. They eavesdrop, shadow, steam open mail. (The Directors of this movie resurrected old, authentic steaming machines for the scene showing how cadres were assigned to surreptitiously open the flaps of envelopes. The picture of a whole steno-pool of men seated in a dingy basement, bending over these steaming machines was shocking in its creepy, mundane invasiveness.) The tone set by all this tapping and steaming activity becomes all the more relevant in our era of Homeland Security.If you have to write a report on life under a Communist regime, you could do all your research by simply looking at this film. But this movie has a larger value than just providing a view into the mechanics of a police state. It also shows the often tragic conflicts of interest it creates for each participant in ""the system."" In this case, the State listener begins to empathize with the people he's assigned to eavesdrop on. He begins to subtly alter and edit the transcripts of what he hears in order to keep his subjects out of trouble. But this tricky maneuver balances both him and the unwitting people he's recording - on a razor's edge.For this reason, the film's Director says ""Lives"" is essentially a buddy movie - but in this case, the buddies never actually meet each other. Their bond is tacit and unrealized by one side throughout most of the film's action - but is supremely heroic and life-affirming nonetheless.The leading German actors cast here are not so much pretty as they are handsome people - attractive and interesting to watch because of the gravitas in their faces.Oh and incidentally, there's a wonderfully tense scene that parallels Joe Pesci's famous ""So you think I'm funny?"" scene in ""Goodfellas."" I guess big-shots are the same the world over.The film itself is in German with English subtitles available. But the Director does his commentary for this version in flawless, literate English. The DVD is worth getting for the commentary alone.

Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has created a minor masterpiece with this work - it stands next to the novel ""Gorky Park"" as an elegant indictment of the worst evil of the Communist Eastern Bloc - their societies depended upon turning their citizens against each other.""The Lives of Others"" closely examines the toll such a society takes on both the watched and the watchers.  An accomplished policeman has dedicated himself to the State.  Ruthless and efficient, he is the guy who breaks the unbreakable, learns the unlearnable.  He is a man of exacting dedication to principle.  But to master his craft, he has denied himself virtually all of life's pleasures.  His life is empty except when he is at work.And then one day he is charged with investigating a charming writer - a favored son of East Germany.  After bugging the man's flat (shared by the writer's charming wife), the policeman sits in to listen.  This he does for weeks, and he comes to admire this all-too-human couple.Why is he, this most principled of men, investigating them?  For a thoroughly unprincipled reason, of course:  because a corrupt government official has the hots for the wife and wants to trump up a charge against the husband to get him out of the way.""The Lives of Others"" is a slow-moving film, but it draws you in as it builds to a shattering climax and a surprisingly humanistic note as two people who should never have shared anything quietly share the most special of bonds.

The story develops in East Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall came down. Under the socialist government, the Stasi, the secret police, monitored and controlled its citizens, ruling them with an iron fist. From brutal interrogations using psychological torture, to life-long bans for some people from practicing their beloved professions, the Stasi terrorized most of the population into submitting to the whims of the regime.In this asphyxiating system, Georg Dreyman, a writer that is not confrontational towards the leadership of the party, becomes the target of surveillance, due to the abuse of power demonstrated by Minister Hempf. This party official wants to get actress Christa-Maria Sieland, Dreyman's girlfriend, all for himself and therefore, commissions a Stasi operation to find dirt on the writer. Here is where things get really interesting, because the faithful and implacable Captain Wiesler, who is in charge of the operation, discovers through his surveillance of the couple that the human spirit and love are more important than the strict rules of domination the party exposes. The transformation by this character throughout the movie is insightful and touching, and shows how most people are not able to leave their humanity behind, no matter how much time others spent indoctrinating them.This story shows that there is no need for exorbitant budgets or flashy scenes in order to create a movie of the highest quality. An excellent script and inspiring performances are what get the job done in this film. The slow pace allows for an understanding of how the different situations affect the emotions of the characters, and even though I know that this will turn off some people, I found it worked extremely well with the story.

1066301,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B000OVLBGC,Sirin,"[0, 0]","This is a compelling and original film. For almost two decades the plight of East Germany has been neglected in art, overshadowed by the monolitic evil prevalent in pre 1945 Germany. But in reality, the poor citizens of East Germany, partitioned off into the Russian sector after World War II, lived for years under an equally menacing and brutal dictatorship. Ok the Stazi didn't kill as many people as the Nazi's, but as George Orwell said, the most perfect dictatorship doesn't need to kill anyone. The Stazi, informers for the puppet Moscow compliant government of East Germany up until 1989, scrutinized every aspect of citizens' lives, snuffing out any individual liberty and freedom their compatriots in the West enjoyed. Life was pure, dogged, misery for so many people.So this film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmark, his debut, is a welcome addition to the European cinema scene. It is a subtle and thrilling tale, superbly acted and scripted, which portrays the plight of Georg Dreyman, a popular playwright who is a supporter of Communism but sympathetic to dissidents which earns him the suspicion of the regime. Hardline Stazi informer, Gerd Weisler, brilliantly portrayed by Ulrih Muhe, who tragically died of stomach cancer shortly after filming, is dispached to monitor the actions of Dreyman and his actress girlfriend. In a moving story that unfolds along the premise of a saying attributed to Lenin that he couldn't appreciate Beethoven's Appasionata as it made him sympathise with the little people he needed to crush in order to instigate revolution, Weisler finds Dreyman's world of culture, art and music a warm and humane antidote to his own solitary life in a tower block where his only solace comes from visits by a elephantine thighed Stazi commissioned hooker.After a composer friend of Dreyman commits suicide, Dreyman breaks ranks with the regime and writes a piece using a smuggled typewriter (all East German computers were registered) on suicide rates in East Germany. Suspicions amongst the police grow, and Weisler finds himself under pressure to close the net in on Dreyman and his girlfriend.The denoument is tragic, followed by a heartfelt epilogue which takes the time frame beyond the falling of the Berlin wall, and redemption for the hardline Weisler. The closing lines are a beautiful cinematic Haiku (though only appreciated in the original German).The film is beautifully terse with the bleakness of East Germany brought out with realistic browns and subtle greys, period details that give a good indication of the privations of life beyond the Iron curtain.The film is not flawless - not a single joke (I know it's a serious film, but even Macbeth has the Porters' scene) and a rather overblown score slightly chip the poise and balance of the movie.For a greater understanding of the movie's context in historical and cinematic terms, I urge people to read Timothy Garton Ash's brilliant review in the New York Review of Books, you can easily find it via google.",5,The most recent evil in Germany,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3010,"['compelling', 'original', 'film', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'plight', 'East', 'Germany', 'been', 'neglected', 'art', 'overshadowed', 'monolitic', 'evil', 'prevalent', 'pre', '1945', 'Germany', 'reality', 'poor', 'citizens', 'East', 'Germany', 'partitioned', 'off', 'Russian', 'sector', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'lived', 'years', 'equally', 'menacing', 'brutal', 'dictatorship', 'Stazi', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'many', 'people', 'Nazi', 'George', 'Orwell', 'said', 'most', 'perfect', 'dictatorship', ""n't"", 'need', 'kill', 'anyone', 'Stazi', 'informers', 'puppet', 'Moscow', 'compliant', 'government', 'East', 'Germany', 'up', '1989', 'scrutinized', 'aspect', 'citizens', 'lives', 'snuffing', 'out', 'individual', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'compatriots', 'West', 'enjoyed', 'Life', 'was', 'pure', 'dogged', 'misery', 'so', 'many', 'people.So', 'film', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmark', 'debut', 'welcome', 'addition', 'European', 'cinema', 'scene', 'subtle', 'thrilling', 'tale', 'superbly', 'acted', 'scripted', 'plight', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'popular', 'playwright', 'who', 'supporter', 'Communism', 'sympathetic', 'dissidents', 'suspicion', 'regime', 'Hardline', 'Stazi', 'informer', 'Gerd', 'Weisler', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Ulrih', 'Muhe', 'who', 'tragically', 'died', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'shortly', 'filming', 'dispached', 'monitor', 'actions', 'Dreyman', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'moving', 'story', 'premise', 'saying', 'attributed', 'Lenin', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Beethoven', 'Appasionata', 'made', 'sympathise', 'little', 'people', 'needed', 'crush', 'order', 'instigate', 'revolution', 'Weisler', 'Dreyman', 'world', 'culture', 'art', 'music', 'warm', 'humane', 'antidote', 'own', 'solitary', 'life', 'tower', 'block', 'where', 'only', 'solace', 'visits', 'elephantine', 'thighed', 'Stazi', 'commissioned', 'hooker.After', 'composer', 'friend', 'Dreyman', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Dreyman', 'ranks', 'regime', 'piece', 'using', 'smuggled', 'typewriter', 'East', 'German', 'computers', 'were', 'registered', 'suicide', 'rates', 'East', 'Germany', 'Suspicions', 'police', 'grow', 'Weisler', 'pressure', 'close', 'net', 'Dreyman', 'girlfriend.The', 'denoument', 'tragic', 'followed', 'heartfelt', 'epilogue', 'time', 'frame', 'falling', 'Berlin', 'wall', 'redemption', 'hardline', 'Weisler', 'closing', 'lines', 'are', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'Haiku', 'only', 'appreciated', 'original', 'German', '.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'terse', 'bleakness', 'East', 'Germany', 'brought', 'out', 'realistic', 'browns', 'subtle', 'greys', 'period', 'details', 'give', 'good', 'indication', 'privations', 'life', 'Iron', 'curtain.The', 'film', 'not', 'flawless', 'not', 'single', 'joke', 'know', 'serious', 'film', 'even', 'Macbeth', 'Porters', 'scene', 'rather', 'overblown', 'score', 'slightly', 'chip', 'poise', 'balance', 'movie.For', 'greater', 'understanding', 'movie', 'context', 'historical', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'urge', 'people', 'read', 'Timothy', 'Garton', 'Ash', 'brilliant', 'review', 'New', 'York', 'Review', 'Books', 'can', 'easily', 'find', 'google']",N/A

1066305,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B000OVLBGC,Stephen A. Haines,"[4, 4]","It's all about stability - how to maintain it and how to prevent its disruption.  In East Germany, from the establishment of The Wall, society found ways to lay out a given path for life.  It also provided a traffic control body to keep individuals on that track.  The traffic controllers were the staff and informants of the Stasi.  Applying various, but effective, methods of thought control, the DDR rooted out dissent in its attempt to keep its populace thinking along ""approved"" lines.  While we have been inundated with books and films depicting brutality, murder and intimidation applied in the East, this film shows an entirely different and far more efficient approach.Gerd Wiesler [Muhe], a Stasi captain, is recruited to launch an investigation of playwright Georg Dreymark.  There's very little to indicate Dreymark is a threat to society, but the motivation arises from elsewhere.  Dreymark's girl-friend, Christa-Maria [Gedeck], is an object of the Culture Minister's passions.  Wiesler undertakes the surveillance himself, and his portrayal carries this film far beyond entertainment.  We have already seen his interrogation techniques - calm, dispassionate and merciless.  Whatever he undertakes will be seen through thoroughly.  The surveillance of Dreymark and Christa-Maria will be no different.However, Wiesler learns of the Minister's prompting of the spying - a corruption of the socialist ideal.  More significantly, Wiesler is able to discern Dreymark's humanity expressed in ways none of his previous victims have demonstrated.  One of these is Dreymark's defence of his former play director Albert Jerska.  Wiesler sees Dreymark confront the Minister over Jerska and learns the blacklisted director had given the playwright the score of ""Sonata for a Good Man"".  The title becomes a key point in the development of the story.  Wiesler revises his outlook as the cynicism and coldness of the regime become more apparent to him.  He is increasingly aware of the need for people to be people and not automatons.The film story builds tensions at a perfect pace, increasing with every passing scene.  There are no dull nor lost moments.  Directory von Donnersmarck's light touch in shifting a character we loathe at the outset of the film into a symbol of pathos at the end. While a shallow view makes Dreymark the victim/hero, it is Wiesler the interrogator and snoop who gains our sympathy.  Wiesler comes into increasing conflict with his superior as the focus on Dreymark and Christa-Maria intensifies.  Jerska's fate drives Dreymark to take an irrevocable step, one which threatens them all.  The conclusion can only be tragic, but the result is nonetheless unexpected.As with many of the ""foreign"" films recently released, the Director's Commentary version of the film is well worth taking the time for.  This is von Donnersmarck's first full-length film, but there's nothing amateurish about it.  He was meticulous in his portrayal of East Berlin, even painting ""freedom's graffiti"" over each morning prior to shooting in the street.  The attention to detail is clear, even in selecting the colours allowed in any given setting.  The effect is to seize the viewer from the opening scene and never provide release.  The film has garnered many awards and deserves all of them.  Mostly, it deserves your attention for its story and its imparted values.

Those terms were part of my study material leading up to my Canadian citizenship test which I took in January. Now, after swearing an oath and becoming Canadian, I'm reminded how precious those freedoms are. If you were born in East Germany before the wall fell, or in other parts of Eastern Europe, you will understand how different life was just over 20 years ago.The Lives of Others is set in East Germany in 1984 and it focuses on some of the freedoms I mentioned above. We see a man interrogating a prisoner sometime in his past, and then watch him teach the importance of the techniques to a class of students. He's an expert in human behavior and body language and can tell when someone is lying. He also notes subversive behavior throughout society, right down to the students in his class. He's Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler and he's a member of the Stasi; a government secret police force.The story focuses on author Georg Dreyman (Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck). Dreyman writes plays and one event in particular inspires him to write a book outlining the oppressive regime in East Germany. Put yourself in his situation for a moment. Who would you trust with your ideas? How would you try to get the book published in Western Europe?Wiesler suspects something and thinks that Dreyman should be under surveillance, so he offers to supervise the operation himself. His team bug Dreyman's apartment and Wiesler listens from his hideaway in the roof of the building, writing daily activity reports on Dreyman and his associates.As the story progresses, Wiesler starts to think about his role and the purpose of his life. He's following orders, but is he doing the right thing? One of the themes early in the movie is that people remain true to their nature, but what is Wiesler's true nature? And so begins a powerful story of an authors' fight to make his opinions known and the intervention of Wiesler.The three main actors all give terrific performances, but it's Muhe as Wiesler who steals the show. Pay close attention to your own feelings as you watch this film and note what happens to your opinion of Wiesler. The Lives of Others is a realistic and moving account that will evoke strong emotions if you allow yourself to be drawn in. If you are worried about subtitled movies, this is one that deserves your attention so please don't let that stop you. I thoroughly enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth, but The Lives of Others rightly won the Oscar that year.

It even brings out some of their psychological tactics for the audience. How they break people. And it shows how people's every day lives are effected. How socialism is not a good thing. Something young Americans of today should know . . . be reminded of.

That's all it takes - Wiesler is on the case and Dreyman's apartment is bugged.

The dire state of American Cinema is only worsened by far better films coming in from other shores.While Hollywood gussies up and prepares to throw more awards at anything anti-Bush, anything that features George Clooney (who will out-preen himself at his acceptance speeches instead of his performance), and anything that obese gasbag Michael Moore points a camera at, foreign films appear to be more interested in things like TELLING A STORY or ENGAGING AN AUDIENCE.  You know, stuff the focus groups that rule Hollywood appear to have completely forgotten.But enough about our mess here....I'd heard about ""The Lives of Others"" but deliberately stayed out of the conversation because I wanted to enjoy the film from a fresh perspective, so I won't go into every reason why I liked it.  Suffice to say I liked just about everything in it.  It is a film where everything works.Set in East Germany in 1984 (an homage to George Orwell?), a Stasi surveillance and interrogation expert named Wiesler, wonderfully played by Ulrich Muhe, is asked to spy on Dreyman, an ""upstanding"" playwright admired by the State for his ""non-rebellious"" body of work.  Why?  A repulsive party member lusts after Christa-Marie, Dreyman's beautiful and talented actress/girlfriend.  If they don't find anything on Dreyman...they're to find something on Dreyman.The story expertly winds and twists through the Cold War landscape of East Berlin as Wiesler, stoicly rattled by the injustice of Dreyman's plot and touched by Christa-Marie's stage presence, goes from being an efficient, machine-like bug to a compassionate human being.I didn't see a false note anywhere in the film.  Like I said: Everything Works.  Definitely check it out.(I was just in Berlin last fall and visited the Stasi Museum, just around the corner from Hitler's bunker.  Any German citizen can go in--just as Dreyman did after the Wall fell in the film--and request his or her file to review.  A dark and fascinating time in a city still struggling with the shadow of the Nazis.  Berlin's a great city.

It had a very engaging story full of suspense and emotion, and still it was a movie that made you think. I also found it to be very realistic. I loved the ending. The ending was unexpected but happy, and at the same time very touching. Both my wife and I loved this movie which is something that does not happen that often.The director paid a lot of attention to details to make it look and feel like East Germany 1984. The colors, the look of buildings, the cars (trabant), and the way people spoke, the fear of saying the wrong thing, all that was captured in a very realistic manner. You could really feel the oppression and melancholy of Communist East Europe. It is therefore also a great educational movie.Even though I did not visit East Germany, I visited the Soviet Union and met with oppressed people there. I was myself held and interrogated at gun point by Soviet authorities (but not for long). However, I also had friends that visited East Germany and we talked about our experiences. Based on my experiences and that of my friends I think I can state that the director was able to capture the look and feel of an Eastern European country.In Soviet people were always watching what they were saying, they seemed depressed and the atmosphere was melancholic. Buildings, stores, and apartments were grayish looking, there were military personal with cool hats everywhere, and cars were small and came only in a few brands (Vaz, Lada, Volga). The movie does not dwell on severe persecution which also existed in both places; it is not what the movie is about.So in summary, the movie was wonderful and engaging, but also very realistic and believable.",5,"Spying on Dreyman, a very realistic drama",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1699,"['movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'had', 'very', 'engaging', 'story', 'full', 'suspense', 'emotion', 'still', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'loved', 'ending', 'ending', 'was', 'unexpected', 'happy', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'touching', 'wife', 'loved', 'movie', 'something', 'not', 'happen', 'often.The', 'director', 'paid', 'lot', 'attention', 'details', 'make', 'look', 'feel', 'East', 'Germany', '1984', 'colors', 'look', 'buildings', 'cars', 'trabant', 'way', 'people', 'spoke', 'fear', 'saying', 'wrong', 'thing', 'was', 'captured', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner', 'could', 'really', 'feel', 'oppression', 'melancholy', 'Communist', 'East', 'Europe', 'therefore', 'also', 'great', 'educational', 'movie.Even', 'did', 'not', 'visit', 'East', 'Germany', 'visited', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'met', 'oppressed', 'people', 'there', 'was', 'held', 'interrogated', 'gun', 'point', 'Soviet', 'authorities', 'not', 'long', 'However', 'also', 'had', 'friends', 'visited', 'East', 'Germany', 'talked', 'experiences', 'Based', 'experiences', 'friends', 'think', 'can', 'state', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'look', 'feel', 'Eastern', 'European', 'country.In', 'Soviet', 'people', 'were', 'always', 'watching', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'seemed', 'depressed', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'melancholic', 'Buildings', 'stores', 'apartments', 'were', 'grayish', 'looking', 'were', 'military', 'personal', 'cool', 'hats', 'everywhere', 'cars', 'were', 'small', 'came', 'only', 'few', 'brands', 'Vaz', 'Lada', 'Volga', 'movie', 'not', 'dwell', 'severe', 'persecution', 'also', 'existed', 'places', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'about.So', 'summary', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'engaging', 'also', 'very', 'realistic', 'believable']",N/A

Georg Dreymon is a playwright who manages to stay in business by writing plays that conform to the socialist propaganda of the East German government. All is lost when a bureaucrat decides to move in on Dreymon's girlfriend, a prominent actress.Despite his absolute innocense, Dreymon must be ""removed"", and a Stasi agent assigned to spy on him.However, the Stasi agent assigned takes a completely unexpected course of action...While we in America are subjected to such cinematic feces as ""Dude, Wheres my Car?"", or ""American Pie"", Europe is still making films that mean something.

American viewers with a bit more cerebral matter will pay close attention. Why? The events portrayed in this film will soon be common place in America, if you DON'T pay attention.The posers currently occupying the White House are encouraging citizens to report anyone who opposes the pharoah's ""health-care plan"".Speak to anyone from the former East Germany, and you will hear tales of a ruthless regime. East Germany had such a thorough hold on the people, that there was very nearly at least one informant in every family, by some estimates.The reason for such severe surveillance was probably due to the fact that East Germany directly bordered the free Western NATO countries, namely West Germany. The communists in power realized that despite all their efforts, it was not possible to hide the freedom and better quality of life in the West. Too many East Germans had easy access to television and radio broadcasts from all points West, for one thing.Of all the Warsaw Pact nations under the heal of the Soviet Union, East Germans were suppressed by the most thorough and ruthless secret-police that the Iron-Curtain could muster. No secret-police force ever kept as vast a network of informants as the Stasi. After the collapse of communism, citizens of East Germany were given free access to all the files kept on them. People were shocked to find that wives, husbands, relatives, friends, and co-workers had ""informed"" upon them for years! Electronic bugs were emplaced almost everywhere. In fact, people who had been arrested by the Stasi, and interrogated, had sweat-samples taken from them. This would be used at a later time, if the individual became a fugitive.

1066317,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000OVLBGC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a celebrated East German playwright, doesn't like the way his new play has turned out. Despite the fact the lead actress is his girlfriend, Christa (Martina Gedeck); he feels the play's director lacks the subtlety the material requires. The Cultural Minister congratulates Georg on the play and the artist asks him once again to lift the blacklist on his preferred director. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a member of East Germany's Secret Police, listens to this exchange and quietly suggests to the ministers that Dreyman should be watched. Wiesler is put in charge of the operation and the Secret Police soon have every inch of his apartment bugged. As Wiesler listens, he begins to get to know more and more about the playwright and begins to respect and like the artist. But his superiors become impatient and want some information about an article published anonymously in West Germany; they suspect Georg wrote it and need the evidence.""The Lives of Others"", written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, is Germany's official entry in this year's Academy Awards. The film was just released in a number of theaters and represents an Oscar worthy film.Set in 1984, the film presents a microcosm of what life was like in the former East Germany. The Stasi, the Secret Police employed vast numbers of employees and secret informants to keep track of and report on the activities of the citizens who are under suspicion; an incredibly large number of people set out to spy on and watch a relatively small population and when this happens, a lot of innocent people are caught in the crossfire. And the people of East Germany knew this system existed, which is why they look through the viewfinders of their doors, but if they see something suspicious, they remain silent. If they raise a fuss, and the Secret Police are involved, they will probably bring suspicion upon themselves. They may even disappear.Georg's neighbor, a single woman, watches Wiesler and his men enter the playwright's department. After they finish, he senses the neighbor is watching and threatens her, in a way meant to ensure she remains quiet. This is typical of their methods and helps establish how nefarious this group is.As the State's celebrated playwright, he enjoys a certain amount of celebrity and is reluctant to do anything to threaten that. But Georg knows this system exists as well, even though he seems reluctant to embrace it. He wants to make some waves, cause some changes, because he comes to realize the system is unfair, so he writes an article and enlists a West German to transport it and publish it in Der Spiegel. As soon as the article is published, the East German government is in an uproar and insists they find the culprit. But Wiesler's superiors suspect Georg and Wiesler doesn't want to give him up so quickly. Thus begins an elaborate, well-plotted, subtle game of cat and mouse.This isn't the stuff of American spy films. Everything is fairly low key, yet none-the-less fascinating. Possibly more fascinating because we believe much of this is actually based on real things that could have and probably did happen.Georg initially doesn't believe he has been bugged, why would they go to the trouble, he toes the line, barely. But his friends are more cautious, they have had first hand experiences with the Secret Police and are suspicious of everyone, even him. Events soon lead him to believe their suspicions and he moves with an air of caution from that point forward, but he is unwilling to believe their suspicions about who may have reported him.Sebastian Koch does a great job of portraying an artist who may not be happy with his current way of life, but he isn't so unhappy he is willing to make radical changes. This is the way of life he is familiar with, has grown up with, and is comfortable with, so he accepts it. As he begins to listen to his friends, share their suspicions, his feelings change slowly and he still holds out hope that perhaps they are wrong.But the most interesting performance in the film comes from Ulrich Muhe. We first meet Captain Wiesler as he leads a seminar for new employees of the secret police, letting them listen to the tape of an interrogation lasting 40 hours. In the end, Wiesler got the information he wanted, but he imparts other information to the students. As he lectures, one of the students raises a question and Wiesler makes a mark next to his name, to remember to have him disciplined. As Wiesler learns more and more about Georg Dreyman, a subtle change happens, and Muhe shows this in a subtle way. His expressions change slightly, showing us how the knowledge he has learned while listening to this artist's personal life has changed him. The change becomes more and more pronounced throughout, in subtle ways, and Muhe does a great job of presenting the conflicts in this character. A life long believer in the Secret Police, he secretly listens to what Georg and his friends have to say and it changes him, causing him no little amount of conflict.Martina Gedeck is also very good as Christa-Maria Sieland, the preeminent actress in East Germany, as much as that would get her in that climate. She is in a relationship with Georg, a famous playwright, and they are a good couple and she is happy. But she has a secret and the secret may threaten her life and the life of her boyfriend.There are no car chases, no gun fights, little of what we have come to expect in an American spy film. ""The Lives of Others"" presents a more subtle, cerebral, but no less suspenseful view of what life was really like in East Germany, in the Early 80s. Throughout the film, we get small glimpses of techniques we wholeheartedly believe were actually used in the Cold War. As Wiesler lectures the class, he admonishes them to remember to collect the seat cover; it will provide the dogs with a suspect's scent. We then watch as he collects the fabric seat cover from the chair used during the 40 hour interrogation and place it in a labeled glass jar, ready should the suspect ever attempt to escape to the West. These little, more subtle moments are all the more scary because they are more real. Did these things really happen? Probably. If they did, this is a society of fear and suspicion and must have been extremely unpleasant for any and all.""The Lives of Others"" is a very good film providing a peek at what life was really like behind the Iron Curtain.",5,A Great Look At How People Lived in East Germany,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,6471,"['Georg', 'Dreyman', 'Sebastian', 'Koch', 'celebrated', 'East', 'German', 'playwright',

But others have, and I have read enough of their accounts, including some by von Donnersmarck's childhood memories (his father's uncle was the Chief of Protocol for East Germany's President, Eric Honecker), to be convinced that ""that's the way it was."" For almost five decades, some sixteen millions people lived in an Orwellian country known as the DDR, Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany) under the control of the most Stalinist government in Europe. Its citizens were under the constant surveillance and control of the most sophisticated secret police the world had ever known, the East German Ministerium f&uuml;r Staatsicherheit, or Stasi, with the efficiency, excuse my clich&eacute;, for which Germans are known. The Stasi employed about 100,000 agents, plus a network of several hundred thousand ""extras,"" who willingly, through bribery, or through coercion reported to the Stasi, informing on their neighbors, co-workers, friends, and even own family members. Stasi only goal was to know everything about the ""lives of others.""The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. It is a fictitious story based on historical facts. Director von Donnersmarck was also the scenarist. The film's characters were compiled from many different real-life figures, to the extend that several of its actors had been themselves the victims of Stasi surveillance and persecutions, and their own private experiences have contributed immensely toward the authenticity of the film. For example, Ulrich M&uuml;he (Stasi Captain Wiesler) found out after the Wall came down that not only several members of his theater group were spying on him, but his ex-wife had been a Stasi informer and spied on him for a dozen of years. Thomas Thieme (Culture Minister Bruno Hempf) was harassed by Stasi before he managed to leave East Germany in the 1980s, and Stasi tried to recruit Volkmar Kleinert (Jerska) as an informer on his fellow actorsvon Donnersmarck's quest for authenticity led him to shoot in as many original locations in East Berlin as possible, such as in the former Stasi headquarters, which included Stasi's original file-card archives, seen at the end of the picture. All of the furniture and objects needed for the film - bugs, surveillance equipment, a room full of machines that steam open letters, and so on, are all original items, gathered from private collectors and museums by prop master Klaus Spielhagen, himself blacklisted by Stasi and imprisoned for two years. The streets of East Berlin are shot with hardly any traffic, as they were then, and the local pub is also nearly empty. Captain Wiesler lives in one of these drab, lifeless, high-rise apartment buildings prevalent in the Eastern European countries under communist regimes, while playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) occupies a gentrified apartment in an old building, typical of the old Berlin. The cinematography contributes greatly to the film's atmosphere. The colors are pale and unsaturated. Brown, gray, beige, orange, and especially green dominate the palette, with blues and reds noticeably absent. As a result of this absolute realism, this film was well-received in Germany, particularly in East Germany, by the press, leading authors, freedom fighters, and intellectuals of the former DDR: they all wrote praising the film for its authenticity.The success of this film owes much to the high caliber of its actors, several of them having been previously exposed to similar scenarios in real life. In particular, one of Germany's leading actresses, the beautiful Martina Gedeck (Christa-Maria Sieland), recipient of many awards, gives a subtle, vulnerable performance. Sebastian Koch's insouciant, bordering on arrogant, attitude of an adulated playwright is convincing. Multitalented Ulrich Tukur (Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz) renders the role of a devious, opportunistic department head perfectly, and Thomas Thieme is absolutely repulsive as the lecherous Culture Minister.. But it is Ulrich M&uuml;he 's superb performance, the depth and subtlety of emotions that underscore his acting as he evolves from an ideological bureaucrat into a compassionate human being, which is most fascinating. His performance is not without recalling that of another voyeur, the equally wonderful Michel Blanc in Patrice Leconte's Monsieur Hire (1989).Another asset of The Lives of Others which contributed to its success is its haunting film score, composed by the multiple award-winner, Gabriel Yared (The Lover/1992, The English Patient/1996, Cold Mountain/2003). In particular, one notices the exquisite ""Sonata for a Good Man,"" an excerpt of which is played in the film by Dreyman. The sorrowful and complex music was recorded by the outstanding Prague Symphony Orchestra.von Donnersmarck offers viewers a cathartic second ending to his film, an equivalent of a musical coda or a literary epilogue, which is a welcome relief to the viewers. There is indeed an under-current of sadness that builds up slowly, imperceptibly, as the film progresses. If The Lives of Others is a political thriller, it is also a human drama, and it is a tribute to the director's artistry and depth that draws his audience into the relentless torments of his characters' wasted talents and lives. At the end of the projection, there were hardly any dry eyes in the audience, which was itself enveloped with a feeling of deep sorrow. If one feels compassion for the misery endured by the subjugated people of East Germany, one cannot help but to also feel genuine empathy for Wiesler. And after a brief moment, something happened which I have very seldom heard or seen in an American movie theater: people applauded.This film is 137 minutes short, and as a final remark on the production, I will add that the intensity of the drama is such that very soon, for those of us who do not speak German, we forget we are reading subtitles.The film's first theme is of political nature: life in the ""Workers' Paradise"" of East Germany in the 1980s -- love it or...don't leave it. The Lives of Others is the first film that treats an aspect of the life in the DDR which, up to now, has been avoided. All the previous films about East Germany were generally light-hearted; the latest one which met with some success in the US was Good Bye Lenin! (2003), portraying the DDR as a benevolent dictatorship at best, and a bad joke for sure. The present film shows a totally different aspect of East Germany, that of a gloomy country with an oppressive government. We are showed how politics can infect -- and potentially destroy -- every aspect of a citizen's life: work, creativity, leisure, intimacy, and even sex. Steering smoothly between the personal and the political arenas, the film shows how destructively the two fields of activities were combined for millions of innocent East Germans. More generally, we are confronted with a basic reality which is that no matter which country one considers, there are always people in the higher echelons of government who, with the complicity of eager followers, seek to highjack the freedom of the citizens under the pretext of fighting a common internal, but more often external, threat. These politicos are motivated by ideologies, private ambitions, greed, stupidity, or ignorance. Germany is one good example, and we, in the United States, should not be too complacent to believe that it cannot happen here. It is presently happening under the influence of the group of ""neocons"" who are playing fast and loose with the US Constitution, slowly and deliberately cutting back our civil liberties at home. Do I have to remind you that the neocons' doctrine has its roots in Trotsky's concept of government?The second theme follows from the first: knowledge is power. In its quest to have absolute power over the East German citizens, the government must strive to obtain absolute knowledge of every aspect of their lives -- their thoughts, behavior, intentions, and activities -- at all times. Through this knowledge, the government can act to counter any subversive activities which could challenge and endanger the regime. This is a question of life or death for the government, and it must employ all means possible, spare no efforts, and be vigilant 24/7, in its quest for information. Governmental justification for spying on its own citizens is, of course, the common external enemy (in this case, Western capitalism) which threatens the Socialist regime. In other times, for different governments with different enemies, the end result is the same: a gross violation of the citizens' human rights.The film's third theme is a philosophical one: it explicitly shows how an ideology must shut off one's feelings in order to pursue one's goals. The true essence of ideology is the total supremacy of its principle over feelings, and the biggest life challenge is finding the right balance between the two -- between one's ideological principle and one's true feelings -- when confronted with a moral choice.I would agree with Minister Hempf's statement that ""People don't change."" No matter what happens in a person's life, that person remains true to his or her nature. However, when along the way, one attains the right balance, albeit temporarily, between ideology and feelings, one is said to have ""changed."" In this context Minister Hempf's statement is wrong, and Captain Wiesler does change. As always, there is never only one cause for a change. Wiesler's dramatic change actually begins soon into the story, when he goes to the theater, an unusual diversion for the person so far depicted. This is followed by his growing awareness of Grubitz's opportunistic character, resulting in his old friend occupying a better position in the Stasi than is own. Weisler contends with the arbitrary use of absolute power when he finds out that his mission has more to do with Minister Hempf's sexual urges than with the defense of Socialism. Finally, as he takes over the direction of Operation Lazlo (an allusion to Casablanca/1942?), Wiesler gets exposed to people whom he would usually only have met during an interrogation situation. And as he becomes more and more familiar with every intimate aspect of their lives, Wiesler starts to question his own life. Through these people, he gets exposed to the arts, and goes so far as to ""borrow"" (this could have been a costly mistake for his operative procedure) and read a book by Bertolt Brecht. Although at first he is rather unwilling, even to the point of finally betraying Dreyman, all these things put together make him change, until he finally commits a genuine heroic act.",5,"Stasi wants

If it doesn't work its way into my favourites the way that Pan's Labyrinth did, it's still one of the best films of 2006, with a more quiet, uneasy power to it.Opening with a literal textbook interrogation that underlines the way that in a police state that is determined ""To know everything,"" you simply end up fearing everything and feeling little - even the Stasi keep notes on each other in a society where the wrong question can mark your career before it has even started - its strength often lies in the little practical minutiae of daily life. It's not a film with many big dramatic moments, more an accumulation of detail that draws you into the situation and the characters' lives just as the late Ulrich M&uuml;he's eavesdropper is slowly drawn into the lives of the actress (coveted by a party official using the secret police to clear the way for him) and her playwright lover who believes people can change in a system that believes people never can to fill in the void in his own ordered existence. Thankfully, it's not a humourless film, even if there's a darkness waiting behind the laughs in the canteen scene that only pays off near the end or the brief but brilliant elevator scene that drew almost as big a gasp of horror from the audience as that moment in Hidden/Cache. It also dares to show how, in their different ways, the characters all manage to almost thrive in a repressive regime - especially the favoured but suspected writer who, without socialism to rebel against after the Wall goes down, finds he has nothing to write about.Interesting to note that the three male leads are all played by actors from Costa Gavras' Amen, all looking very different here. It's not too difficult to see how the inevitable Hollywood remake should shake up - Stanley Tucci should be a lock for the lead, Tom Hanks the playwright with Kevin Spacey rounding out the trio as the politically ambitious, morally flexible boss.

I mean that in the best of ways. ""The lives of others"" starts out with the decision of the state to monitor a playwrite, for reason's that are not exactly the purest. But soon stasi (secret police) member Gerd takes sympathy with those he is forced to watch, and according to some, seems to fall in love with their lives. The plot thickens as a article written by a secret east german writer appears in the west, who the goverment believe to the character of Georg who is already under watch. Thought the rest of the movie, Gerd takes action to make sure that Georg is protected from the over zealous hammer of authority. One can only wish we met such people more often. Without giving away the rest of the plot, a great deal of drama, wonderful acting, and a amazing background setting(I must find out where this is filmed!). One of the wonderful things I took away from this movie, was seeing the person make the choice of using his ethics and heart, rather than excusing himself with the old failed defense of ""taking orders"".

But while listening in on the lives of the writer, his lover, and their friends, Wiesler slowly begins to change his stripes from those of a grey state drone to those of a human being.There are a number of painful plot twists, and an ultimately satisfying ending.

I had high expectations for this Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language film in 2006.  Needless to say, my expectations were thoroughly surpassed.The film focuses on mid-80s East Germany and the Stasi, the GDRs secret police.  Erich Honecker and the Stasi established one of the most repressive, totalitarianism societies on the planet.  We get a frightening view inside this world as we follow a mid-level Stasi office who has been ordered to spy on one of the leading East German playwrights and his actress girlfriend.The picture captures perfectly communist society, in this case East Germany, from the dull, dreary landscape to the dreadful architecture and communist paranoia.  Furthermore, the performances, both lead and supporting roles, are tremendous.  As someone who has studied quite a bit of Cold War history, this movie paints a picture perfect portrait of what life was like in a Soviet bloc country during this period of the 20th centuryThis movie is as good as any American film from last year and is easily one of the best movies that I have seen this decade.

Writer-director Donnersmarck's cinematic debut not only pulls at our heartstrings, but he also brings us to the verge of tears without becoming overly sentimental or preachy.Every element of this film is worthy of praise. The acting is superb. Ulrich M&uuml;he stands out as the loyal STASI official, Wiesler, who finds himself questioning whether his duty is to the people, or to the party. The writing is wrought with beautiful moments of characterization and heartfelt but realistic dialogue. Wiesler reading poetry to himself, fantastic moments of dramatic irony, or the poet's, Georg Dreyman's, comments on his friend's gift, a piano piece entitled ""Sonata for Good Men."" The direction and cinematography seem to work in tandem to provide a slow and careful look at each set and location, further describing the characters without having to muddle with exposition. The pacing is perfect. Scenes unfold and Donnersmarck takes us to the next one with seemingly no transition, but enough synergy to keep a flow going throughout. Even at two hours, the engrossing plot and splendid pacing keep you riveted.So, The Lives of Others is, as a film, well done, all around. But why did it deserve its Oscar? Why is it not only very good, but amazing? The answer is in what its message is and how said message is presented. One might expect that even though the film has been lauded on countless occasions for its poetic beauty, cynical filmgoers might only expect the tired message that communism is bad. Of course, communist states are very much police states will be bad. Donnersmarck knows that people who watch his film will know this. What we see is unlikely protagonist, Captain Wiesler, not only loyal to the party, but to its ideals and enforcer of its laws. However, a disparity between loyalty to the state, to its people, and his loyalty to his fellow, affluent party members arises. This film does not argue against communism. It argues against overbearance by a government against its people. Wiesler's values are not shaken, but his viewpoint is broadened. In the end, it isn't about a rebel or an anarchist. This story is about someone who realized that his ideals were being twisted and decided to work towards what he thought was right.",5,"Winner for a Reason, Timeless for a Reason",1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,2521,"['are', 'still', 'bitter', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'losing', 'thought-to-be', 'destined', 'Academy', 'Award', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'argue', 'Lives', 'Others', 'wholly', 'more', 'memorable', 'moving', 'experience', 'still', 'adhering', 'very', 'attractive', 'style', 'Writer-director', 'Donnersmarck', 'cinematic', 'debut', 'not', 'only', 'heartstrings', 'also', 'verge', 'tears', 'becoming', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'preachy.Every', 'element', 'film', 'worthy', 'praise', 'acting', 'superb', 'Ulrich', 'M', 'uuml', 'out', 'loyal', 'STASI', 'official', 'Wiesler', 'who', 'questioning', 'duty', 'people', 'party', 'writing', 'wrought', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'characterization', 'heartfelt', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'Wiesler', 'reading', 'poetry', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'poet', 'Georg', 'Dreyman', 'comments', 'friend', 'gift', 'piano', 'piece', 'entitled', 'Sonata', 'Good', 'Men', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'seem', 'work', 'tandem', 'provide', 'slow', 'careful', 'look', 'set', 'location', 'further', 'describing', 'characters', 'having', 'muddle', 'exposition', 'pacing', 'perfect', 'Scenes', 'unfold', 'Donnersmarck', 'next', 'one', 'seemingly', 'transition', 'enough', 'synergy', 'keep', 'flow', 'going', 'Even', 'two', 'hours', 'engrossing', 'plot', 'splendid', 'pacing', 'keep', 'riveted.So', 'Lives', 'Others', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'around', 'why', 'did', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'Why', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'amazing', 'answer', 'what', 'message', 'how', 'said', 'message', 'presented', 'One', 'might', 'expect', 'even', 'film', 'been', 'lauded', 'countless', 'occasions', 'poetic', 'beauty', 'cynical', 'filmgoers', 'might', 'only', 'expect', 'tired', 'message', 'communism', 'bad', 'course', 'communist', 'states', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'police', 'states', 'will', 'be', 'bad', 'Donnersmarck', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'What', 'see', 'unlikely', 'protagonist', 'Captain', 'Wiesler', 'not', 'only', 'party', 'ideals', 'enforcer', 'laws', 'However', 'disparity', 'loyalty', 'state', 'people', 'loyalty', 'fellow', 'affluent', 'party', 'members', 'film', 'not', 'argue', 'communism', 'overbearance', 'government', 'people', 'Wiesler', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'shaken', 'viewpoint', 'broadened', 'end', ""n't"", 'rebel', 'anarchist', 'story', 'someone', 'who', 'realized', 'ideals', 'were', 'being', 'twisted', 'decided', 'work', 'towards', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right']",N/A
