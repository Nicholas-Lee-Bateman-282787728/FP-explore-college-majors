It has been a great investment as it has tought my girls to use their words more as well as count.  For a while we were concerned with my 3 year olds development until she started watching Dora. Now she is talking and using her words more as well as showing us her ability to remember songs and sing them.

831832,A2V8ZSKES49RGW,B0002ERWTQ,Mom in Hooville,"[0, 0]","This disc contains four episodes: Dora's Halloween, The Missing Piece, The Big Storm, and Monkey Bars.  Only one is related to Halloween, but I think the creators threw in The Missing Piece because it has a wizard, and The Big Storm because it's got a thunderstorm in it.  So, only one episode is about Halloween, but it's one of the better Halloween shows for pre-schoolers.  My 4-year old watched this last year and still watches it now.
