Boston Rob & Cathy where in this survivor it has tons of bonus features in this set. Such as early show interviews as well as full confessionals at tribal concil and the Island footage as well. Also footage that was never shown on tv. So people who taped it off tv don't have everything from this season it's really worth the money. Hours and hours of bonus footage. The packaging is not great but to me i'm so happy they released this season. I'm a huge fan and want them to release all the survivor seasons on dvd such as survivor amazon, survivor thailand etc there all good. But it's up to us to buy them when they come out on dvd.

But I agree with the most outspoken person on the jury that the third place finisher was indeed the most deserving of the grand prize. Two *classic* moments involved the ""arrival of Cleopatra"" and ""Can someone pee on my hand?!"" (Those were just too, too funny - and enough to make this season worthy of purchase.) However, the gushy relationship between a 57 year old man and a 21 year old woman seemed pervy to me at worst and sickening (sweet?) at best. I REALLY disliked those two. (Yeah, I'll give you my USED mint! What an idiot.) The reunion show with Rosie O'Donnell was a bust in my view as well. They need to just keep Jeff Probst for those things - which for most seasons they have done.But my big issue with this product is the unnecessary number of discs - NINE! Why do they have to put them on so many?! Other seasons like Palau or Vanuatu fit on four discs. That is perfect for a Survivor marathon viewing session because you don't have to get up to constantly change discs. There is no reason that a season of Survivor has to be stretched out onto NINE discs. There weren't that many extras (I don't think) that they couldn't have conserved some discs.I buy these dvds because I live overseas and I'm also a Survivor fan. So I want all of the seasons that I can get and I want to conserve room in my separate disc folder. I don't see why I should have to allocate nine spaces for a season like this - when four or five would do!

I have to disagree with them because the picture quality was EXCELLENT and I love the slimmer packaging....5 discs in one case. That is so much better than the packaging of season 1 & 2 (each disc was in a separate case and kept together by a box/sleeve).I've enjoyed going back through the beginning seasons to see how this show all started. I never watched it back then, but I sure am enjoying watching it now. No commercials and can watch whenever I feel like it. I am able to watch one entire season in a week's time. Season 3 so far is my favorite season of all. I LOVED the views of Africa and of all the wild animals running around. I actually liked the contestants better too. At first Big Tom kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but as the show went on, I became a fan of him.After viewing each season, I find myself going online and searching the contestants to see how they are doing today and to see how they've aged, or have starred in any other shows since being on Survivor. I found out that Ethan Zohn was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma in 2009 and went through two stem-cell transplants. How awful. He was my favorite contestant on season 3.I really think you will enjoy this season and don't let the negative reviews scare you away about the packaging and the picture quality.

Ethan of course was my favourite regardless of the outcome, because it was refreshing to have a genuine nice guy out there, and the way he got along with every other player was so nice to watch.

This was the Season where I learned to love Survivor and became addicted.This was one of the HARDEST Survivors ever. Why? Yes, they had food, rations, (that stopped Survivor four), but they had no Water. Both Samburu and Boran had muddy watering holes where Elephants frequented frequently (lol). It had (to date) harder challenges, lions and other animals came dangerously close... It was real and exciting.The first ""twist"" came here (the switching of the tribes). The Survivor that we all know and love, betray your teammates so you can get further, but basic morals still shine through. We still had the loyal inner sanctum (The Boran Boys of Ethan Lex and Tom). We had the first major boo-boo mistake by Jeff Probst, later rectifed.So with the amazingness of this season, WHY on earth are we still waiting for? I am tired of Paramout releasing the later seasons of Survivor, ones that is still fresh in our minds.

This season took risks (it got us off the island) and gave us some of the more interesting individuals who showed up later for All Stars.  Strategy was good to watch and, in the end, it was great to watch the good guy win.Also, Africa had one of the stronger positive messages...when the reward challenge visitors went to visit an orphanage, it wasn't the sort of forced ""ethnic interactions"" that recent seasons have staged (the Cook Islands, anyone?).

639563,AYQJ4W4PBUFP5,B00005JOAP,RoccoS,"[0, 0]","Back in august i wrote a review about how excited i was to see this being released. now that it is available for purchase i thought i would write a review about the product itself...I was so glad a few months ago to see that Survivor Thailand & Survivor Amazon were finally going to be released on DVD!!! However, I was discouraged to see that it was again going to be another DVD-R (On-Demand Product). I would love to see future releases made as most other DVDs are.About The Packaging & Make of the Discs...I was happy that the set came with  only 5 discs in one standard size case, as opposed to the previously released seasons having 3 cases & 9 discs (with only about 2 episodes on each disc and no cardboard sleeve to put the cases in). For this set, Disc 1 has episodes 1-3. Disc 2 has episodes 4-6. Disc 3 has 7-9. Disc 4 has episodes 10-13 & Disc 5 has episodes 14 & 15 (The 2 hour finale & the reunion). Each disc has extended exit interviews and the early show interviews with the contestants as well as a few other specials features.The discs I received have glossy labels and a purple tint on the other side. The purple tint indicates that these are made ""on demand."" What sucks is that video on DVD-R only last about 10 years due to some complicated way that the discs are made. The weird part is...I ordered survivor amazon at the same time...and the packaging and make of the discs for this set were different. Survivor Amazon comes with 5 discs in a DOUBLE SIZE DVD case with not glossy, but more rough feeling labels on each disc, and the discs do not have a purple tint on the backside but the regular silver color. I still don't understand why Survivor Amazon needs a bigger case when they contain the same amount of discs!?!About Survivor Thailand ***SPOILER  ALERT***I know everyone says that this is absolutely or one of the worst seasons of survivor!! All I have to say is...I enjoyed watching this season only because it was my first time watching it. It was more of a relaxed season (There was very little strategy and no big moves). As soon as chuay gaun had the advantage with players after the merge...it was obvious who would be voted in the next few episodes. Even when all of the sook jai members were gone...it was obvious who would go and who would stay. It has very few to no memorable players or moments.I hope that CBS and amazon.com continue to release more. The only way this would happen is if a good amount of these sets are sold, proving that other seasons would be hot sellers!!! So keep buying these please!!! I know that if more are released...they will probably be done in order of each season...but I hope to see some of my favorite seasons like...12, 13, 15, 16, 17, & 21 be released sooner!!! Hopfully we will see some in late winter or early spring as we did with Heroes VS Villains last year!!IF YOU COULD PLEASE COMMENT BELOW ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE CASES YOU RECEIVED FOR EACH SEASON...I WOULD APPRECIATE IT!!!

My memories of the great classics Africa, Marquesas and Amazon would have to do. As soon as I heard about this release and confirmed that the news wasn't fake, there was no question in my mind that I was pre-ordering both this and Africa.The day they arrived was a great day for this Survivor fan. I must say for a Createspace DVD set (something I hadn't heard of before), they've exceeded my expectations. The packaging is excellent and the footage is of as high a quality as the previous sets. Unfortunately, there's no commentaries from the contestants like on past releases, but the extras more than make up for that. Besides, Marquesas is a fantastic season which can stand on its own and still be a worthy release. I advise all Survivor fans out there to get this season, as you won't be disappointed.Good job Amazon and Createspace! Thank you for finally filling a gap in my DVD collection!

The cast of this season are all a bunch of wimpy, tree hugging hippies, churchy do-gooders, loud-mouthed idiots, or just plain boring. I pretty much hated EVERYONE on the show. The only interesting and likable person I thought, was Boston Rob. The other people they portrayed to be ""villains"" were really pretty boring and not at all interesting or even good at the game. I lost COMPLETE interest after only about 4 episodes, but only continued to watch to see who won because I didn't want to feel like I wasted money.I HATED this season!! Even pretty just ""OK"" seasons like Vanuatu at least were semi fun to watch in that there were interesting people, even if they were totally inept at playing. This is a season where it seemed like no one was really TRYING to WIN. It was more like they were all sitting around singing Kum By Ya and hugging trees while reading the bible. You'd think you were watching a camping show at some hippie resort. This season SUCKED!!!I regret buying it, and if you are really curious about it, RENT it. But even then, I don't think that its worth your time watching. Not entertaining at ALL!!! VERY disappointed with this season.Also, don't be hatin' on my review just because you don't agree with me, this is just a warning to regular fans who may have a passing interest and not ""die hard"" fans of the show.I've seen enough seasons of Survivor and generally really enjoy it, this season, however, SUCKED.",1,"Irritating people, irritating season, irritating results.",1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1877,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'Survivor', 'bought', 'dvd', 'set', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'positive', 'reviews', 'others', 'here', 'now', 'realize', 'people', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'simply', 'want', 'EVERYONE', 'like', 'same', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'give', 'unbiased', 'review.This', 'season', 'however', 'was', 'EXTREMELY', 'irritating', 'lost', 'interest', 'favorite', 'player', 'got', 'voted', 'off', 'cast', 'season', 'are', 'bunch', 'wimpy', 'tree', 'hugging', 'hippies', 'churchy', 'do-gooders', 'loud-mouthed', 'idiots', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'pretty', 'much', 'hated', 'EVERYONE', 'show', 'only', 'interesting', 'likable', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'Boston', 'Rob', 'other', 'people', 'portrayed', 'be', 'villains', 'were', 'really', 'pretty', 'boring', 'not', 'interesting', 'even', 'good', 'game', 'lost', 'COMPLETE', 'interest', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'only', 'continued', 'watch', 'see', 'who', 'won', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'wasted', 'money.I', 'HATED', 'season', 'Even', 'pretty', 'just', 'OK', 'seasons', 'Vanuatu', 'least', 'were', 'semi', 'fun', 'watch', 'were', 'interesting', 'people', 'even', 'were', 'totally', 'inept', 'playing', 'season', 'where', 'seemed', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'TRYING', 'WIN', 'was', 'more', 'were', 'sitting', 'around', 'singing', 'Kum', 'Ya', 'hugging', 'trees', 'reading', 'bible', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'camping', 'show', 'hippie', 'resort', 'season', 'SUCKED', 'regret', 'buying', 'are', 'really', 'curious', 'RENT', 'even', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'time', 'watching', 'Not', 'entertaining', 'ALL', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'season.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'hatin', 'review', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'just', 'warning', 'regular', 'fans', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'passing', 'interest', 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'show.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'seasons', 'Survivor', 'generally', 'really', 'enjoy', 'season', 'however', 'SUCKED']",Survivor - Marquesas
