I'm giving this movie 5 stars based on the action alone. There is an explosion at the start of the movie which was done very well. This is not the type of special effects I expect in a direct-to-video release. This was more of a big budget movie explosion. A bomb in a car explodes causing a huge fire ball, and the shock of the explosion shatters windows. The second reason this movie gets 5 stars is the action was great. The car chase was excellent. There were many gun fights. The martial arts fights were good. The third reason for 5 stars is the supporting cast was very good. The person who plays the CIA officer and the person who plays the local police chief were exceptionally well acted parts. This movie gets a R for lots of violence and nudity.",5,Good action movie,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,860,"[""'m"", 'Seagal', 'fan', 'must', 'have', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'one', 'better', 'action', 'movies', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'based', 'action', 'alone', 'explosion', 'start', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'type', 'special', 'effects', 'expect', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'was', 'more', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'explosion', 'bomb', 'car', 'causing', 'huge', 'fire', 'ball', 'shock', 'explosion', 'shatters', 'windows', 'second', 'reason', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'action', 'was', 'great', 'car', 'chase', 'was', 'excellent', 'were', 'many', 'gun', 'fights', 'martial', 'arts', 'fights', 'were', 'good', 'third', 'reason', '5', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'CIA', 'officer', 'person', 'who', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'acted', 'parts', 'movie', 'R', 'lots', 'violence', 'nudity']",Shadow Man

Usually I would give a higher score to a Seagal movie but this movie has a specially thin plot. In fact, if I write anything about the plot, it would be a spoiler. So let me be cryptic. Seagal has something that the bad guys want. They send thugs to get it from him. The thugs get killed. They send more thugs...Well made, good action with plenty of Seagal's calm approach to killing people. High body count, lots of blood. Some good chases. This movie is beyond ""easy on the brain"" (see Seagal, see thugs, see dead thugs, repeat).

983931,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000F6IOCA,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[26, 30]","Lord Steven releases lots of movies, so much so that its like having Christmas three or four times a year.  Now, my past few little ""Christmases"" have been disappointing.  So, I wasn't holding my breath for a masterpiece when I picked up ""Shadow Man""(its lame cover not easing my mind in the least).  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.The plot is ridiculously convoluted, but here is a vague outline of what happens:  Lord Steven plays a billionaire businessman who was formerly a CIA agent.  He's also a widower raising a young daughter.  His father-in-law is still in the CIA and meets with the Lord and his daughter in Romania for a family trip.  Pops secrectly slips the Lord some sort of high-tech nano-virus without Seagal's knowledge then gets promptly blown up by a car bomb.  At the same time, the Lord's little girl gets kidnapped.  The rest of the movie is doublecross upon doublecross and no one really has any motive save for Seagal, who is out to get his daughter back.  Throw in some Russian gangsters(one of which who curiously looks like a mixture of Christopher Lloyd and Max Headroom)out to get the virus, shady government agents also looking for said virus, a femme fatale taxi driver, some excessive violence, and you get a quality Seagal feature.Firstly, let me say that for the first time since 'Belly Of The Beast' that one of Seagal's movies has a director that actually seemed to give a crap.  Michael Keusch, a former German TV director, crafts a fine film with nice camera work, good dialogue, lots of action(mostly hand-to-hand with some nice akido showcased)...but the thing I really liked were the little details:  the bad guy with syphilis and his creepy mask, some eyeball ripping, a few brutal gunshots to the face, and a funny cab driver who shows up for a few moments.  Its nice, for once, to see a Seagal director take the time to go all out in everything from fight scenes to extraneous details.  This is the first time in a while that I've felt like the makers of a Seagal opus actually tried to make it be a good film.Despite its silly opening scene(just watch for the watermelon and you'll know what I mean), 'Shadow Man' is easily Seagal's best film since 'Belly Of The Beast'.  He looks decent, though still a bit pudgy, but better than he's looked in a while.  There's some great fight scenes(the Lord's stuntdouble for once isn't quite so obvious), there's hardly any dubbing, and has quite a bit of excessive violence.  All the actors are good(even a small role from Brit actress Imelda Staunton), the plot is interesting if overly ambitious, and Seagal seems into it for once.  There's no cheese here, no filler at all.  'Shadow Man' is, by far, Seagal's leanest, meanest most action-filled flick in a while.

Everything from the storyline, production, acting, and action falls almost completely flat. The film feels likeThe Foreignerin rewind, with dreary visuals and poor fight scenes highlighting an over-complicated storyline that's impossible to care about.The story: martial artist and businessman Jack Foster (Seagal) sees his daughter (Skye Bennett,Against the Dark) kidnapped during a mysterious airport attack while Jack himself is targeted by Romanian officials and mobsters believing him to be in possession of a devastating biological weapon. Gunned at from all sides, he must team with a beautiful ex-government agent (Eva Pope, ""Coronation Street"") to eliminate the threat and save his daughter.My description may sound relatively simple enough, but nevertheless, this is one of the most convoluted films Seagal's ever appeared in. As an action hero, Steven has never really needed brainiac storylines to get over, but the script of ""Shadow Man"" calls for the plot to take at least two disorienting twists, feature a supporting cast the size of China, and require the viewer to juggle the intentions of several characters amidst the general chaos. That last aspect may have been fine if there was a single interesting character in the whole movie, but almost everyone here is completely faceless. Seagal himself comes off as a callous jerk and an awful parent. Eva Pope is easily the most memorable performer in the movie, but that's not saying much.The production is sub-standard. The film utilizes the ""shaky camera"" technique to maddening effect and the locales are consistently colorless and boring to look at. Action scenes fail to exhilarate: Seagal busts out an aikido move every half hour, but all of the hand-to-hand fights, shootouts, and car chases are cut so irregularly that you'll hardly have time to register what's going on in half of the shots. For a couple nice touches, though, Jack builds a nifty MacGuyver-style bomb with a phonograph and somehow manages to shoot down a combat helicopter with a pistol. Nevertheless, it's far from satisfying, especially after the beginning of the movie teases some martial arts coolness by featuring Seagal demonstrating the fabled ""dim mak"" technique.In conclusion, I would only recommend this film if you particularly enjoy Seagal's direct-to-video efforts, because it'll take some commitment to get to like this one, even from established fans.",1,Can't Step Out of His Own Shadow,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,2614,"['As', 'much', 'like', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'like', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'Buddhist', 'Bonecrusher', '25th', 'action', 'feature', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Keusch', 'Attack', 'Force', 'Everything', 'storyline', 'production', 'acting', 'action', 'almost', 'completely', 'flat', 'film', 'likeThe', 'Foreignerin', 'rewind', 'dreary', 'visuals', 'poor', 'fight', 'scenes', 'highlighting', 'over-complicated', 'storyline', 'impossible', 'care', 'about.The', 'story', 'martial', 'artist', 'businessman', 'Jack', 'Foster', 'Seagal', 'daughter', 'Skye', 'Bennett', 'Against', 'Dark', 'kidnapped', 'mysterious', 'airport', 'attack', 'Jack', 'targeted', 'Romanian', 'officials', 'mobsters', 'believing', 'be', 'possession', 'devastating', 'biological', 'weapon', 'Gunned', 'sides', 'must', 'team', 'beautiful', 'ex-government', 'agent', 'Eva', 'Pope', 'Coronation', 'Street', 'eliminate', 'threat', 'save', 'daughter.My', 'description', 'may', 'sound', 'relatively', 'simple', 'enough', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'most', 'convoluted', 'films', 'Seagal', 'ever', 'appeared', 'action', 'hero', 'Steven', 'never', 'really', 'needed', 'brainiac', 'storylines', 'get', 'script', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'plot', 'take', 'least', 'two', 'disorienting', 'twists', 'feature', 'supporting', 'cast', 'size', 'China', 'require', 'viewer', 'juggle', 'intentions', 'several', 'characters', 'amidst', 'general', 'chaos', 'last', 'aspect', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'was', 'single', 'interesting', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'almost', 'everyone', 'here', 'completely', 'faceless', 'Seagal', 'off', 'callous', 'jerk', 'awful', 'parent', 'Eva', 'Pope', 'easily', 'most', 'memorable', 'performer', 'movie', 'not', 'saying', 'much.The', 'production', 'sub-standard', 'film', 'shaky', 'camera', 'technique', 'maddening', 'effect', 'locales', 'are', 'consistently', 'colorless', 'boring', 'look', 'Action', 'scenes', 'fail', 'exhilarate', 'Seagal', 'out', 'aikido', 'move', 'half', 'hour', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'shootouts', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'cut', 'so', 'irregularly', ""'ll"", 'hardly', 'have', 'time', 'register', 'what', 'going', 'half', 'shots', 'couple', 'nice', 'touches', 'though', 'Jack', 'nifty', 'MacGuyver-style', 'bomb', 'phonograph', 'somehow', 'manages', 'shoot', 'down', 'combat', 'helicopter', 'pistol', 'Nevertheless', 'far', 'satisfying', 'especially', 'beginning', 'movie', 'martial', 'arts', 'coolness', 'featuring', 'Seagal', 'demonstrating', 'fabled', 'dim', 'mak', 'technique.In', 'conclusion', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'Seagal', 'direct-to-video', 'efforts', ""'ll"", 'take', 'commitment', 'get', 'like', 'one', 'even', 'established', 'fans']",Shadow Man
983943,A1F72LRP98VC96,B000F6IOCA,Ollie,"[4, 8]","With all the positive buzz on this Seagal release from various fan websites, I was expecting big things from this DTV title and for some of Shadow Man it did deliver what I was hoping for but also some of the usual poor production values that plague Seagals DTV releases. Excluding Mercenary For Justice, there is probably more fight scenes in Shadow Man all filmed with Seagal and not a stunt double than there has been in his last 3 DTV's combined. Two fights with multiple opponents in particular conjure up memories of his early Warner Brothers movies. The plot is involving enough although again as usual slighting overly complicated and the gun action is well staged. Seagal delivers some good one liners which produced a laugh here and there. Black Dawn had good production values but was ultimately rather boring, Mercenary For Justice showed signs that Seagal is again willing to participant in his martial arts and action scenes and Shadow Man even more so continues that trend.But, Seagal just doesn't seem to have the same raw energy or interest he displayed in his early movies anymore such as Hard To Kill or Out For Justice which I don't think has anything to do with age and that is what is missing from these later day Seagal DTV's. On the down side though Seagal is doubled on most exterior scenes walking into or out of buildings and cars, there is also extensive use of rear projection green screen during the interior shots for the driving sequences. There is also the rather obvious fake helicopter explosion as shown in the trailer.As a Seagal fan of his earlier movies, I did find things to like in Shadow Man and make alliances for the low budget in making the movie.

There really aren't big plot holes in this film like some of the others, and the camera work is pretty well done on the action scenes and fight scenes. Plus, the supporting actors are serviceable and the film being shot on location in Romania added a nice backdrop for this espionage-type action movie. Perhaps best of all, unlike ""Attack Force"" or ""Kill Switch"" there isn't any obvious stunt double or voice dubbing. So the movie has a very clean and tight feel to it. There really was only one really ""cheesy"" scene where Seagal shots down a helicopter with only a pistol and it explodes in the air - that was pretty bad. However, there were some cool scenes of him using his Aikido with an acceptable level of Hollywood effect added to it.My main criticism of the film is that it just wasn't all that interesting. Except for the opening chase scene when Seagal's daughter is kidnapped, and the typical Seagal-like finish to the film where everyone ends up dead, the middle of the movie is quite dull despite only being a 95-minute movie it felt like it dragged on for over 2 hours.

On the plus side, The Shadow Man (2006) does feature some decently executed action sequences, as Seagal appears to be performing the majority of his fight scenes, and also using his real voice.  Unfortunately, while the action elements are passable, the story that ties them together is kind of sloppy, and not particularly plausible.Seagal often seems to be playing the same character in many of his films, and that's much the case here.  His character Jack Foster, is a former intelligence operative who has just arrived at an airport in Bucharest with his daughter Amanda (Skye Bennett, making her film debut), when the girl is abducted by a cab driver named Anya (Eva Pope), as Jack's father-in-law George (Michael Elwyn), a CIA agent, is blown up in spectacular fashion.A detached Foster seems rather unphased by these traumatic developments.  Making an impressive MacGyveresque escape from a trap in a country estate, Jack begins to search for his daughter.  Harry apparently went rogue and stole a bioweapon, and believing that he passed it on to Foster, both the bad guys and the U.S. Government are now after him, thus making his daughter a pawn in the deadly game.Foster weaves a path of destruction, assaulting some police detectives, escaping capture by American agents, then stirring up trouble among the Romanian underworld, highlighted by Foster firing a round into the skull of an old woman trying to cut him down with machine gun.  He eventually catches up with Anya, after first attempting to strangle her, she then becomes his unlikely ally.Like most of Seagal's recent efforts, this is a film to be enjoyed primarily for its violence and action elements, as presenting a credible story just isn't a major concern.  Not much in Shadow Man makes sense, as it attempts to fill in gaping holes in the plot, with numerous action sequences, fights, and shootouts.  Seagal's performance in the action department is actually very solid, as he doesn't rely heavily on camera tricks and editing, as he sometimes does.Skye Bennett's (Dark Floors) performance is not bad in her first film, but Foster doesn't seem to display much genuine concern for his daughter.  It's really all about the violence, which is quite plentiful, as Foster utters philosophical platitudes, while he muscles and shoots his way through the opposition, usually aiming for the head.  The bloody conclusion in a library, features a twist ending that is almost a throw away, as Foster administers the Dim Mak.Among Seagal's direct to video catalog, Shadow Man is probably one of his stronger efforts, and certainly the best of his collaborations with director Michael Keusch, which also includesFlight Of Fury(2007), andAttack Force(2006) which ranks as one of Seagal's worst films.",3,"Seagal generates plenty of mayhem, in this muddled eastern European adventure...",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2885,"['Regrettably', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'few', 'direct', 'video', 'efforts', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'plus', 'side', 'Shadow', 'Man', '2006', 'feature', 'decently', 'executed', 'action', 'sequences', 'Seagal', 'be', 'performing', 'majority', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'using', 'real', 'voice', 'Unfortunately', 'action', 'elements', 'are', 'passable', 'story', 'together', 'kind', 'sloppy', 'not', 'particularly', 'plausible.Seagal', 'often', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'many', 'films', 'much', 'case', 'here', 'character', 'Jack', 'Foster', 'former', 'intelligence', 'operative', 'who', 'just', 'arrived', 'airport', 'Bucharest', 'daughter', 'Amanda', 'Skye', 'Bennett', 'making', 'film', 'debut', 'when', 'girl', 'abducted', 'cab', 'driver', 'named', 'Anya', 'Eva', 'Pope', 'Jack', 'father-in-law', 'George', 'Michael', 'Elwyn', 'CIA', 'agent', 'blown', 'up', 'spectacular', 'fashion.A', 'detached', 'Foster', 'rather', 'unphased', 'traumatic', 'developments', 'Making', 'impressive', 'MacGyveresque', 'escape', 'trap', 'country', 'estate', 'Jack', 'search', 'daughter', 'Harry', 'apparently', 'went', 'rogue', 'stole', 'bioweapon', 'believing', 'passed', 'Foster', 'both', 'bad', 'guys', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'are', 'now', 'thus', 'making', 'daughter', 'pawn', 'deadly', 'game.Foster', 'path', 'destruction', 'assaulting', 'police', 'detectives', 'escaping', 'capture', 'American', 'agents', 'then', 'stirring', 'up', 'trouble', 'Romanian', 'underworld', 'highlighted', 'Foster', 'firing', 'round', 'skull', 'old', 'woman', 'trying', 'cut', 'down', 'machine', 'gun', 'eventually', 'up', 'Anya', 'first', 'attempting', 'strangle', 'then', 'unlikely', 'most', 'Seagal', 'recent', 'efforts', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'primarily', 'violence', 'action', 'elements', 'presenting', 'credible', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'major', 'concern', 'Not', 'much', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'sense', 'fill', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'numerous', 'action', 'sequences', 'fights', 'shootouts', 'Seagal', 'performance', 'action', 'department', 'actually', 'very', 'solid', ""n't"", 'rely', 'heavily', 'camera', 'tricks', 'editing', 'does.Skye', 'Bennett', 'Dark', 'Floors', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'first', 'film', 'Foster', ""n't"", 'seem', 'display', 'much', 'genuine', 'concern', 'daughter', 'really', 'violence', 'quite', 'plentiful', 'Foster', 'utters', 'philosophical', 'platitudes', 'shoots', 'way', 'opposition', 'usually', 'aiming', 'head', 'bloody', 'conclusion', 'library', 'twist', 'ending', 'almost', 'throw', 'away', 'Foster', 'Dim', 'Mak.Among', 'Seagal', 'direct', 'video', 'catalog', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'probably', 'one', 'stronger', 'efforts', 'certainly', 'best', 'collaborations', 'director', 'Michael', 'Keusch', 'also', 'includesFlight', 'Fury', '2007', 'andAttack', 'Force', '2006', 'one', 'Seagal', 'worst', 'films']",Shadow Man

983957,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F6IOCA,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 13]","""Shadow Man"" is one of the better entries in a string of direct-to-video Steven Seagal films. The productions are decent and the supporting actors are better than usual. It is far from such films produced by major studios as `Under Siege' or `Exit Wounds,' but well, he seems doing most of his actions himself. But I believe most action film stars are supposed to do his stunts or at least make it look like that.The story is, as usual, nothing special. Seagal is an ex-CIA operative whose daughter is kidnapped. And he is involved in some conspiracy about a bio-chemical weapon. As the story unfolds, you just start to follow the convoluted plot and anyway will decide to sit back and keep watching Seagal killing the typical villains mostly sporting English with Russian accent.But what really matters is action, and the first 30 minutes are pretty good. The film opens with Seagal teaching his pupils in his dojo, flipping and throwing away them with his aikido, and that reminds me of his earlier films in the 80s. Then there are some OK car actions and shoot-outs, which are shoddily edited, but the stunt persons are doing good jobs. The film then loses steam, and actions get more and more insipid. Wait for one unintentionally funny scene in which Seagal's character fights back a helicopter only with a pistol. The results are laughably cheesy effectsAs a mysterious taxi driver beautiful Eva Pope appears. Maybe she is too good for this film, but more surprising is the cameo appearance of Imelda Staunton, winner of Laurence Olivier Theater Awards and Oscar nominee for her amazing acting in `Vera Drake.' Watching her standing side by side with Seagal is a bit surreal experience for me.""Shadow Man"" is a better than average Seagal direct-to-video actions, but that isn't saying much given the efforts put to his recent films.",2,"Better Than Most of His Recent DTV Films, But That Isn't Saying Much",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,1838,"['Shadow', 'Man', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'string', 'direct-to-video', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'films', 'productions', 'are', 'decent', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'usual', 'far', 'such', 'films', 'produced', 'major', 'studios', 'Siege', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'well', 'doing', 'most', 'actions', 'believe', 'most', 'action', 'film', 'stars', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'stunts', 'least', 'make', 'look', 'that.The', 'story', 'usual', 'nothing', 'special', 'Seagal', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'involved', 'conspiracy', 'bio-chemical', 'weapon', 'story', 'unfolds', 'just', 'start', 'follow', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'anyway', 'will', 'decide', 'sit', 'back', 'keep', 'watching', 'Seagal', 'killing', 'typical', 'villains', 'mostly', 'sporting', 'English', 'Russian', 'accent.But', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'action', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'Seagal', 'teaching', 'pupils', 'dojo', 'flipping', 'throwing', 'away', 'aikido', 'earlier', 'films', '80s', 'Then', 'are', 'OK', 'car', 'actions', 'shoot-outs', 'are', 'shoddily', 'edited', 'stunt', 'persons', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'jobs', 'film', 'then', 'steam', 'actions', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'insipid', 'Wait', 'one', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'scene', 'Seagal', 'character', 'fights', 'back', 'helicopter', 'only', 'pistol', 'results', 'are', 'laughably', 'cheesy', 'effectsAs', 'mysterious', 'taxi', 'driver', 'beautiful', 'Eva', 'Pope', 'Maybe', 'too', 'good', 'film', 'more', 'surprising', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'winner', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Theater', 'Awards', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'amazing', 'acting', 'Vera', 'Drake', 'Watching', 'standing', 'side', 'side', 'Seagal', 'bit', 'surreal', 'experience', 'Shadow', 'Man', 'better', 'average', 'Seagal', 'direct-to-video', 'actions', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'given', 'efforts', 'put', 'recent', 'films']",Shadow Man

Sadly, I have rented every one of them in hopes I would one day witness THE RETURN of one of my favorite action stars, all the while knowing it probably will never happen.  I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment.  Or maybe his films have become so bad I've been fooled into thinking this one is better, I don't know.  There are a few ""okay"" fighting sequences, certainly not up to par with the best of his work but better than most of what we've come to expect during the last four or so years of [...].  At least you actually see him doing something instead of, like, standing there while watching bodies fall around him (the fight scene among the mannequins in Black Dawn comes to mind).  I stopped buying Seagal's films some time ago and certainly wouldn't purchase this one, as it would only collect dust, but I do recommend this one film to any fan who has not witnessed the sad melee of garbage he's churned out during the last four years.",2,Best Seagal Film In Awhile,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1272,"['Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'good', 'movie', 'compared', 'other', 'direct', 'DVD', 'fare', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', 'film', 'least', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'structure', 'was', 'ALMOST', 'watching', 'normal', 'movie', 'Seagal', 'acting', 'actually', 'seemed', 'tad', 'more', 'enthused', 'last', 'several', 'films', 'Sadly', 'have', 'rented', 'one', 'hopes', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'THE', 'RETURN', 'one', 'favorite', 'action', 'stars', 'knowing', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'glutton', 'punishment', 'maybe', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'one', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'few', 'okay', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'certainly', 'not', 'par', 'best', 'work', 'better', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'last', 'four', 'so', 'years', '[', ']', 'least', 'actually', 'see', 'doing', 'something', 'instead', 'standing', 'there', 'watching', 'bodies', 'fall', 'fight', 'scene', 'mannequins', 'Black', 'Dawn', 'mind', 'stopped', 'buying', 'Seagal', 'films', 'time', 'ago', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'one', 'would', 'only', 'collect', 'dust', 'do', 'recommend', 'one', 'film', 'fan', 'who', 'not', 'witnessed', 'sad', 'melee', 'garbage', 'churned', 'out', 'last', 'four', 'years']",Shadow Man
