Let me tell you this is probably one of the most improtant films ever made. If you were to take Lord of the Flies, A Clockwork Orange, Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Running Man, and The Most Dangerous Game of All you would get Battle Royale. the movie really got to me for two reasons: One, seeing all those kids being pinned against one another made me feel like that was me and one of my highschool classes, I don't think I would have the heart to kill the kids that I grew up with. Two, the violence in the movie is portrayed as violence should be: cruel, unforgiving, and irreversible. None of the violence is glorifed of made to look cool. Because violence isn't a glorious thing at all. Thats why I also beieve that that the teenagers of the USA would benifit greatly from seeing this movie. Too many of the movies in America glorify violence, death, and guns. But I am a bit timid about it being released in the US too. I worry that some kid who is immpretionable would get the wrong message and think that killing is cool, lords knows the US has enough trouble with those kind of people. Yet so does Japan and it went over very well over there, so I am optomistic about a US audiance understanding this movie. The very end of the movie when the credits roll really pulled at my insides. The background for the credits is a class photo of Class B. The camera goes over each section of the pic so that you may get a close up of each student. You are reminded that when you see their faces that these are kids. They had lives, families, friends, goals, dreams, and most painful of all students who were in love with them, sadly alot of them never found out until it was too late. In the special version we see flashbacks of their childhoods. We see them struggling against not fitting in, domestic violence, and suicides in the family. And we see that none of these kids are bad kids, they are all alone and crying out for love. That is probably the greatist tragedy of all.",5,Stays with you long after the credits have rolled,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,2122,"['longest', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'desparately', 'trying', 'find', 'copy', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Finally', 'just', 'decided', 'download', 'Kazaa', 'Let', 'tell', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'improtant', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'were', 'take', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Long', 'Walk', 'Running', 'Man', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'All', 'would', 'get', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'movie', 'really', 'got', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'seeing', 'kids', 'being', 'pinned', 'one', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'one', 'highschool', 'classes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'heart', 'kill', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'Two', 'violence', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'violence', 'should', 'be', 'cruel', 'unforgiving', 'irreversible', 'None', 'violence', 'glorifed', 'made', 'look', 'cool', 'violence', ""n't"", 'glorious', 'thing', 'Thats', 'why', 'also', 'beieve', 'teenagers', 'USA', 'would', 'benifit', 'greatly', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'America', 'glorify', 'violence', 'death', 'guns', 'am', 'bit', 'timid', 'being', 'released', 'US', 'too', 'worry', 'kid', 'who', 'immpretionable', 'would', 'get', 'wrong', 'message', 'think', 'killing', 'cool', 'lords', 'US', 'enough', 'trouble', 'kind', 'people', 'so', 'Japan', 'went', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'am', 'optomistic', 'US', 'audiance', 'understanding', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'really', 'pulled', 'insides', 'background', 'credits', 'class', 'photo', 'Class', 'B', 'camera', 'section', 'pic', 'may', 'get', 'close', 'student', 'are', 'reminded', 'when', 'see', 'are', 'kids', 'had', 'lives', 'families', 'friends', 'goals', 'dreams', 'most', 'painful', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'love', 'sadly', 'alot', 'never', 'found', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'special', 'version', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'childhoods', 'see', 'struggling', 'not', 'fitting', 'domestic', 'violence', 'suicides', 'family', 'see', 'none', 'kids', 'are', 'bad', 'kids', 'are', 'alone', 'crying', 'out', 'love', 'probably', 'greatist', 'tragedy']",N/A

I'm not sure why so many people rate this movie highly, except that it has an audacious premise (a highschool class forced to fight to the death).  First, the premise of the Battle Royale is given cursory attention... apparently spanking kids no longer works so teenagers just run wild with no consequence while adults suck it up.  To punish these out of control teens, a law is passed where a random class if forced to fight to the death.  But, for what purpose or point?  When the kids wake up from being drugged, they have no clue what is going on.  If the Battle Royale was suppose to be some kind of means of warning to teens to behave, why wouldn't these teens have realized right away what was going on?The overall production values were mediocre, the acting over the top, and massive plot gaps abounded.

It's basically about a group of Japanese students who get thrown into a hunger games type of situation and have to battle it out for survival. ( though this came before hunger games)- There's no way you cannot stop watching it. The plot is good, the acting is good and it keeps you interested until the end. Very unique, different and executed in a way that is near flawless. I only had some minor problems with the end. The whole movie is interesting, compelling and one a kind. I don't care what came after it or what came before it all I know is this is one good movie and is probably unique in itself.

597247,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00005JL99,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[20, 22]","Battle Royale is a movie based on new age problems, such as teen suicide, school murders, and the lack of respect that today's youth has or has had for superiors. It's a surreal response to all of these elements of modern society (and despite being a Japanese film, this is especially true for the United States). In the near future, teenagers have decided that they don't want to follow the same rules they've been following for ages. Teachers now fear for their lives, and students boycott the system. In order to put a stop to this, the BR Act was instituted, yet none of the students have no idea about this... until they are apart of the Act. Basically, the BR Act allows the adults to send children and students off to a secluded island to kill each other off.That's just what happens to a class of forty-two students, with two mysterious transfer students included in that. Once introduced to their class, and given the rules of game, they are sent off with a bag of provisions and a randomly chosen weapon. Sometimes, the weapons can as useless as a pair of binoculars, or as effective as grenades. It's all the luck of the draw, and whether or not the student is able to adapt to the game and earn the weapons on their own. Some students do just that, while others choose different ways of escaping the game. And then there are those who choose instead not to fight at all, but to unite and try to figure out a way to save themselves. Yet the rules of the game may force even those of a more peaceful ilk to kill the ones they trust.What's good about Battle Royale is that, though there are numerous characters and plenty of sub-plots, it never gets bogged-down with an over-populated cast. There are heroes, neutral forces, as well as those who are pure evil. Another good part of this movie is the constantly rising tension, and how the characters react to this. As the game gets deeper, the characters emotions begin to fray. Though surely a fantasy, it seems that everything that happens to these students because of the BR Act could be possible, should our world ever reach the point it does in Battle Royale.The one problem I had with Battle Royale, though, was the subtitles. At times they ran out of the edge of the screen, making it impossible to read, and at other times they just weren't grammatical. The wrong words were used in many places, and sometimes the subtitles made no sense at all, whether they were written grammatically or not. Though the acting makes a lot of what's being said clear, there are times when this still gets frustrating.Despite that, though, the movie is excellent. It has plenty of surprises, a good ending, and a lot of great action. Plus, it has the common Japanese elements, like the super-violence and gore. To add, the story is great, and the characters are well-acted. I'd recommend this movie to any fan of Asian cinema, especially Japanese horror fans. Battle Royale is one of the better movies to come out of Japan.",5,Everyone Smile for One Sick Class Photo,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2973,"['Battle', 'Royale', 'movie', 'based', 'new', 'age', 'problems', 'such', 'teen', 'suicide', 'school', 'murders', 'lack', 'respect', 'today', 'youth', 'had', 'superiors', 'surreal', 'response', 'elements', 'modern', 'society', 'being', 'Japanese', 'film', 'especially', 'true', 'United', 'States', 'near', 'future', 'teenagers', 'have', 'decided', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'follow', 'same', 'rules', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'ages', 'Teachers', 'now', 'fear', 'lives', 'students', 'boycott', 'system', 'order', 'put', 'stop', 'BR', 'Act', 'was', 'instituted', 'yet', 'none', 'students', 'have', 'idea', 'are', 'apart', 'Act', 'Basically', 'BR', 'Act', 'adults', 'send', 'children', 'students', 'secluded', 'island', 'kill', 'other', 'off.That', 'just', 'what', 'class', 'forty-two', 'students', 'two', 'mysterious', 'transfer', 'students', 'included', 'Once', 'introduced', 'class', 'given', 'rules', 'game', 'are', 'sent', 'off', 'bag', 'provisions', 'randomly', 'chosen', 'weapon', 'Sometimes', 'weapons', 'can', 'as', 'useless', 'pair', 'binoculars', 'as', 'effective', 'grenades', 'luck', 'draw', 'not', 'student', 'able', 'adapt', 'game', 'earn', 'weapons', 'own', 'students', 'do', 'just', 'others', 'choose', 'different', 'ways', 'escaping', 'game', 'then', 'are', 'who', 'choose', 'instead', 'not', 'fight', 'unite', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'save', 'rules', 'game', 'may', 'force', 'even', 'more', 'peaceful', 'ilk', 'kill', 'ones', 'trust.What', 'good', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'are', 'numerous', 'characters', 'plenty', 'sub-plots', 'never', 'bogged-down', 'over-populated', 'cast', 'are', 'heroes', 'neutral', 'forces', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'pure', 'evil', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'constantly', 'rising', 'tension', 'how', 'characters', 'react', 'game', 'deeper', 'characters', 'emotions', 'begin', 'fray', 'Though', 'surely', 'fantasy', 'everything', 'students', 'BR', 'Act', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'should', 'world', 'ever', 'reach', 'point', 'Battle', 'Royale.The', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'though', 'was', 'subtitles', 'times', 'ran', 'edge', 'screen', 'making', 'impossible', 'read', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'grammatical', 'wrong', 'words', 'were', 'used', 'many', 'places', 'sometimes', 'subtitles', 'made', 'sense', 'were', 'written', 'grammatically', 'not', 'acting', 'lot', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'clear', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'still', 'frustrating.Despite', 'though', 'movie', 'excellent', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'good', 'ending', 'lot', 'great', 'action', 'common', 'Japanese', 'elements', 'super-violence', 'gore', 'add', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'well-acted', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'fan', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'fans', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'come', 'Japan']",N/A
597248,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00005JL99,A. Schneider,"[1, 1]","[The following is for the review of the 2 disc special edition DVD version of Battle Royale]First off let me start off by saying that all together this is a great film, with some kick butt action sequences, awesome plot, cool twists along the way and just a downright awesome feel. However, there are a number of things which take away from the film's overall powerful appeal (and overall quality).One of the major problems with the film is that it comes across as ""dark humor"" or ""slapstick"" in many ways (the awkward music playing while someone is getting their head bashed in with an axe), and dead people getting up and talking just make the film come across as ""amusing."" But wait, that isn't to say this movie, is a comedy at all and that isn't to say comedy is a bad thing (especially here)!I'm half sure the ""dark humor"" aspects of the film were designed to make it a ""cult classic"" and appeal to large audiences in much the same way other dark humor type films have in the past. Likewise, if taken for what it is in conjunction with some of the gruesome aspects of the film as well as the interesting storyline, it leads (in my opinion) to a very neat film (if not a strong one).One reviewer said that the film was ""disturbing."" I'm going to have to disagree simply because of the slapstick nature in which brutal killings take place throughout the movie (sure if you have a weak heart you might find the film overbearing at times, but I certainly didn't). Are the murders senseless and without style? No, in fact the style literally is the dark humor, as cheesy as that is when we are asked to take the storyline seriously at times.So all and all the humorous aspects in the film both take away from it as well as provide a backdrop for much of the brutality throughout the film. Recently I've heard a number of American reviewers mention that the problem is that the film is both a foreign film as well as a low budget film - these two can be contributing factors as many Americans who rent the film on Netflix and or at their video store are certainly under the impression they are about to watch a ""serious"" film (whether or not this is thought exclusively by Americans I do not know, perhaps the film was marketed similarly in Japan).For the reasons previously mentioned this cannot be considered a ""serious film,"" rather perhaps it can be considered a ""strange/good film"" in that it is too humorous to be serious and too serious to resemble a comedy in the slightest (and yes I think that unfortunately means people will either like it or hate it for what it is).The end of the films suffers from poor subtitle translations as well as an overly ""exhausted"" feeling. Closure of the film occurs 5 minutes before the actual film's end, the actual ending is full of useless images of the film's characters playing together (giving us even more useless images of how bad it was that friends were fighting with each other as well as how some of the individuals lived secluded lives, perhaps lending to some kind of rationality for why they gave into violence as they had).I'm going to have to disagree with any sort of opinion that says major psychological themes played a large role in the movie. Certainly they were there (it would be foolish to ignore them completely), but given the slapstick way in which the movie was handled at times it seems as though they were dulled throughout most of the movie and only resurrect themselves later at the film's ""actual ending.""All and all this is a great film as I mentioned earlier. I would have actually liked the film to focus more on the psychological trauma perhaps felt by the youngsters throughout the film.

It is always difficult to render a proper adaptation of a very large book with a large number of characters, but even so, there are ways. Unfortunately, the director fails to do a very good job at that. Sometimes even the camera angles are wrong in that they fail to capture a character's reaction at the proper time, opting instead for wide angles. Another thing, I had no emotional connection with most of the characters, even the main ones; frankly, I didn't care if they lived or died, I just wanted to see the action. Granted that the book went into greater detail about them, the director could have easily worked something in in order to establish empathy.I have another criticism, one that also applies to the book and that consists in that although several of the characters sustain injuries, they nevertheless undertake physical activity which would be strenuous in normal circumstances.

597256,A3OMULJI0PSEF9,B00005JL99,Brad Lee,"[4, 12]","I read The Hunger Games, then watched the first movie. Loved them all. I set out to watch Battle Royal because I heard it was, essentially, the ""first"" Hunger Games. The two bare no similarity aside from young adults killing each other, and I really don't understand the appeal of Battle Royal. It severely lacks the social and political commentary that gives The Hunger Games such a solid foundation, and instead focuses almost exclusively on death, violence, and ludicrous melodrama.The story is nearly non-existent and the reason for having students battle each other to the death is flimsy at best (unemployment too high? Let's just throw a bunch of kids on an island and have them kill each other, that makes sense right?). Most of the characters look similarly to each other and it doesn't help that they all wear the same school uniforms, but no matter, there's nearly 40 of them and most have precious little screen time before some ridiculously gruesome death, so if you get them confused with each other it really doesn't matter much.The whole thing is just completely preposterous, and there isn't even the visceral feeling of survival. One of the characters is just some batsh-t insane kid who carries an uzi and unloads thousands of rounds throughout the course of the movie, and I think I saw him reload his gun once when it was convenient to give one of the characters an opening to attack. It completely loses any sense of realism and feelings for survival when the bullet count is as high as a Schwarzenegger film, despite there being only a handful of guns (seriously, the amount of rounds dispersed he would have to be carrying 2-3 dufflebags filled with nothing but clips of ammo).But perhaps even worse is the melodrama, which is even more copious than the blood splatters. Every single character had to monologue during their death scene about how much they loved such and such student. It just feels so forced and hollow. They couldn't bother to have any characterization prior, so instead they choose to force some half-assed romance during their death scenes to show you how sad it is. But it just comes off feeling awkward and ridiculous.And even worse than that, this small group of students devised a clever plot to escape. Then they get gunned down. That ends that. What was even the point of that side story?The movie also has one of the most absurd deaths I've ever seen. A character gets shot, stands up like it's nothing, sits down on a couch, answers his phone and speaks as if nothing is out of the ordinary, and then dies immediately after that. I was seriously wondering if this was some bizarre attempt at nihilistic humor or something, because if it was meant to have some kind of poignancy it was completely lost with horrendous acting and just awful execution. I haven't felt so awkward watching a movie since the ""NOOOOOOOOO"" scene in Star Wars Episode III.I couldn't even enjoy this movie in a ""so good it's bad"" context, because it actually attempted to have some amount of social and political commentary at the beginning of the movie. It set me up similar to The Hunger Games, but by the end it just felt like a poorly executed slasher flick.Ultimately, Battle Royal is a case of injecting a small amount of artistic integrity into what is otherwise a pure exploitation flick as a flimsy excuse for justifying all the bloodshed and violence.",1,"Melodrama and Blood, Little Substance",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,3387,"['read', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'then', 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'Loved', 'set', 'out', 'watch', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'heard', 'was', 'essentially', 'first', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'two', 'bare', 'similarity', 'aside', 'young', 'adults', 'killing', 'other', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'appeal', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'severely', 'social', 'political', 'commentary', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'solid', 'foundation', 'instead', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'death', 'violence', 'ludicrous', 'melodrama.The', 'story', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'reason', 'having', 'students', 'battle', 'other', 'death', 'flimsy', 'best', 'unemployment', 'too', 'high', 'Let', 'just', 'throw', 'bunch', 'kids', 'island', 'have', 'kill', 'other', 'sense', 'right', 'Most', 'characters', 'look', 'similarly', 'other', ""n't"", 'help', 'wear', 'same', 'school', 'uniforms', 'matter', 'nearly', '40', 'most', 'have', 'precious', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'ridiculously', 'gruesome', 'death', 'so', 'get', 'confused', 'other', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'completely', 'preposterous', ""n't"", 'even', 'visceral', 'feeling', 'survival', 'One', 'characters', 'just', 'batsh-t', 'insane', 'kid', 'who', 'uzi', 'unloads', 'thousands', 'rounds', 'course', 'movie', 'think', 'saw', 'reload', 'gun', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'convenient', 'give', 'one', 'characters', 'opening', 'attack', 'completely', 'sense', 'realism', 'feelings', 'survival', 'when', 'bullet', 'count', 'as', 'high', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'being', 'only', 'handful', 'guns', 'seriously', 'amount', 'rounds', 'dispersed', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'carrying', '2-3', 'dufflebags', 'filled', 'nothing', 'clips', 'ammo', '.But', 'perhaps', 'even', 'worse', 'melodrama', 'even', 'more', 'copious', 'blood', 'splatters', 'single', 'character', 'had', 'monologue', 'death', 'scene', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'such', 'such', 'student', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'forced', 'hollow', 'could', ""n't"", 'bother', 'have', 'characterization', 'prior', 'so', 'instead', 'choose', 'force', 'half-assed', 'romance', 'death', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'sad', 'just', 'off', 'feeling', 'awkward', 'ridiculous.And', 'even', 'worse', 'small', 'group', 'students', 'devised', 'clever', 'plot', 'escape', 'Then', 'get', 'gunned', 'down', 'What', 'was', 'even', 'point', 'side', 'story', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'absurd', 'deaths', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'character', 'shot', 'up', 'nothing', 'down', 'couch', 'phone', 'speaks', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'then', 'dies', 'immediately', 'was', 'seriously', 'wondering', 'was', 'bizarre', 'attempt', 'nihilistic', 'humor', 'something', 'was', 'meant', 'have', 'kind', 'poignancy', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'just', 'awful', 'execution', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'so', 'awkward', 'watching', 'movie', 'NOOOOOOOOO', 'scene', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'III.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'bad', 'context', 'actually', 'attempted', 'have', 'amount', 'social', 'political', 'commentary', 'beginning', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'similar', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'end', 'just', 'felt', 'poorly', 'executed', 'slasher', 'flick.Ultimately', 'Battle', 'Royal', 'case', 'injecting', 'small', 'amount', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'what', 'otherwise', 'pure', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'flimsy', 'excuse', 'justifying', 'bloodshed', 'violence']",N/A

My review is for those who haven't seen it yet and are considering dropping the $ to buy the DVD.In my honest opinion, the movie failed as an action film, as a 'dark comedy', as a drama, etc. The cartoonish violence may turn some on -- if you're the type that loves cartoony or over-the-top violence, this might be your kind of film. I admit I like other films that might be lumped into the same category -- Kill Bill, Sin City, Watchmen -- but these films also benefited from creative cinematography, unique style and production value, excellent soundtracks, etc.The film verion of 'Battle Royale' just didn't do it for me, though. For one, the cinematography is very plain and the color saturation throughout the film is kind of faded. Maybe done intentionally, but it took away from my enjoyment. The soundstrack is vanilla, the acting is vanilla (maybe it's great for Asian films, but I dunno, because I've seen many Asian films with more compelling acting AND a better concept, like 'Thirst' or 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring', 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', etc.), and the violence, while ""over the top"", is not really ""over the top"" enough to make up for its cartoonishness.Regardless of whatever social commentary they were going for, the makers of this film didn't really have me laughing, cringing, cheering, crying, or gripping my seat. I was sorta bored throughout. I didn't care about Nanahara (or however you spell it) and his little crush's struggle to survive. Why? Because you already know from the onset that they're going to make it. I also didn't really think the 'over the top' violence was all that cool. I mean, for one, the blood looks like pink grapefruit kool-aid. High school girls absorb a full clip of submachinegun rounds in the torso and then stagger about murmuring cliche lines before slumping in a heap. Mannequins with Japanese schoolkid uniforms and strapped with bags of ketchup explode on-camera. An old grumpy Japanese dude walks around talking about how bratty kids are. Is it really all that incredible?However, I can admit that maybe I'm just missing it with this film & review. Surely lots of people really enjoyed the film, but the fact remains that I didn't. I'm upping my review from 1 to 2 stars because this isn't really a 1-star film. I didn't LOATHE it. But, on the other hand, I didn't like it either.So if you already know you love this movie, buy it.

597259,A3CNLK47TYVUVN,B00005JL99,"Bryan Lim ""Bryan Lim""","[4, 5]","Before I saw this movie, I was quite troubled with this movie. First I had read the back of the DVD saying that young teenagers killing each other... This kind of plot was the kind of plot that would make an awful movie of senseless violence and just plain psychotic and not a movie worth seeing. The reason I saw this movie was because of it's controversy. People in japan tried to oppose the movie from being released and since it has been released, I want to see how Contro. it is. and I also Like foreign Films.Battle royale's plot is that japan has gone into a corrupt society, along with the corruption, the country's youth has gone rebellious: 800,000 students boycott school. The government cannot control hundreds of thousands of rebellious teenagers and therefore have to force classes into participating in battle Royale. Once the class is there, they get a kit with food and water, compass, flash light and a random weapon. three days limit of killing and surviving. There is only one winner. If there are more than one, the necklaces the students wear will explode and all dies.To tell the truth, After seeing this movie, it made me really love this film. The movie was just made really well. Irespect that people would want to avoid this film because of it's plot. Yes, there is killing but I rather say this film is about survival, courage, fierce loyalty, friendship and decisions.ACTING: No doubt in a film, acting is the most important inorder for the film to really capture the realism of it. The young actors we see aren't the ones we see in hopeless and funny ( not litterally) movies which makes us laugh because of the stupid acting. Here in battle Royale, we see true talent emerge. In a story of survival, acting is very important, WE see people in BR crying, screaming, arguing in situations that would be the most horrendous. WE also see hapiness when there is a happy moment and we can feel the character's emnotion and really get into the movie.SCREENPLAY: The screen play I cannot really judge because I cannot 100 % fully understand japanese, but the subtitles are quite good. I can understand everything. Forget the stupid pirated ones when the subtitles don't match the image. The subtitles are well made and are suitable for foreign viewers like myself.Direction: Kinji Fukasaku is was 70 years old when he made battle royale, I respect this fine director for making an incredible movie and for his enthusiasm to make it into a successful one. Because of his energy into making battle royale, His direction of Battle royale is really nice. We see nice scenery and by seeing documentaries, we see Kinji Fukasaku being a true perfectionist. (in the scene were kitano slaps Nobbuo, he had to do it many times to make the scene perfect , sdlap after slap after slap...""ouch"")Thats why this film is really perfect because of his good direction. I haven't read the book but a 400+ page book into a near 2 hour movie, he's done a good job...The issue of violence: Before the movie, the violence is the main thing that stands out, when you finished the film, the violence don't get in the way. AS I said before, the movie is about the act of survaival not based on violence...  the violence isn't for entertainment but to capture the fear and emotion of the situation. Where we see a child die by machine guns, we feel sorry for the student and feel sorry for all of them who have to go through this situation. I felt sad about this movie and I thought this a movie more about tragedy than senseless killing.Excitement: The excitement in Battle Royale is really good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, will all of the murdering, emotion and fantastic acting make Battle royale very entertaining.Conclusion: IN a movie, conclusion is very important, Battle royale's conclusion is very nice and not stupid, the movie ends in a very satisfying way ( but can confuse some viewers) but the problem is that when the credits roll, lifting pop music starts to roll.....]Music: The use of Classical music is very powerful. I loved the theme in the beggining. and the music by bach: air string on G.It actually suits really, really well with the movie.The original score is also done really well. I don't know the composer but I noticed the richness of the orchestration and the correct emotion to suit the image in screen. well doneOVERALL::::BATTLE ROYALE is one of the BEST Japanese movie I have ever seen, the movie has a very original plot and it stands out over other movies. To undertsnat this movie, you must look deep in the movie and you'll see what kind of movie Fukasaku (director) has made with Battle Royale",5,A fantastic movie.

Sure, it is violent, but the violence itself was nothing more than slightly-creative killing with computer-added blood splashes. Really. Lots of gunshots, stabbings, but considering that all the kids were wearing explosive neckbands, you'd think there'd be ""heads-a'-poppin.'""..but no.In fact, though the countdown of deaths throughout the movie was a nice touch (adding to the ""game"" feel), the directors didn't spend much time exaggerating death or making it outlandishly violent. Rather tame by other Japanese films' standards. So, if the violence isn't the pull of this movie, then what is?There is a small undertone of loyal friendship and personal justice interwoven to the story. While it's a bit far-fetched and poorly acted, it exists. Even the ""bad guy"" of the film comes off as being a little sentimental at the end. It doesn't work in the film, but it was possibly an attempt to make the movie more mature than it was coming off as.Purely a fantasy movie due to the content and story, I had hoped the violence and the atmosphere were also more creative. This could have been an ultra-violent bloodbath, but for some reason, the directors chose to keep the violence simple and try to make us sympathize with certain characters. Unless you've got a keen eye and a knack for memorizing Japanese names, you may find yourself confused as to who you're supposed to ""root for"" and who you are supposed to dislike. (These kids look a lot alike.)I give the film a solid three stars because it was interesting, but it was very, very weak in many parts. Violence was weak, story was underachieving and the ending was probably more sappy than it was poignant.Though it would have been a throw-away shockfest, I would have prefered it to be an all-out killing spree movie.

In the near future the Japanese are fed up with revolting students and create a law to deal with them.  Of course in this case most of the students are innocent but that doesn't seem to matter.  They choose a class of about 70 students and send them off to kill each other on a remote island.  Each gets a pack with food and a weapon.  Some of those weapons are a pair of binoculars and another a pot lid.  However some get numbchucks, knifes, and even pistols and machine guns.  Now if you like either Japanese movies or other cultural movies, you will probably enjoy this movie.  The movie is pretty decent most of the time, but like most movies of this type they get cheesy, hammy, and generally full of themselves preaching mistakes of society, how students and teachers are treated, and kids just don't appreciate what they have from time to time.

I've both read the book (I read the novel first) and seen the movie. The book was excellent in both plot, development, action, suspense, and surprises galore. BR is my absolute fave book of all time, hands down.Now on to the movie. The BR movie had a lot of discrepancies that made me stare into the cathode ray tube of my TV and scream ""WTF?!"" the dream that Noriko has in the movie was a major WTF moment. Then Kitano's painting of all the dead students with Noriko standing in the center of it with a golden halo of light.(?) Kazou Kiriyama and Shogo Kawada's being ""chosen"" to liven up the game was totally off.

The book was amazing and rightfully claims a seat on my ""Top 5 Books of All Time"" List. The movie took everything that was good with the book and threw it out the window.

It violates its own rules and internal logic. It is, essentially, a great big snuff-film.And I really liked it.There's not a lot you can say about this film, really. 42 middle school kids, most of them played by actors who either actually are, or at least look close to, the ages of the characters are hauled out to an island and told to kill each other until only one is left. This is either a reality TV show or government pogrom, or possibly both. Either way, it's an absurd premise.But it works. The acting is very good, and the characters are interesting (plus I really had a thing for Shuya). There's also quite a bit of blood and gore all over the place. Surprisingly, however, there's not as much as you might think. Mostly the shock of it comes not from the quanitity but from the fact that it's 14 - 16 year olds doing the deeds.Ultimately this is a film worth getting. I bought the director's cut from Amazon and I'm quite pleased with it. Even the extras are well done. I would like it if the film got a North American distributor, but that's not likely. So order this version and enjoy.As a side note, I hear there's an American version of the film in the works. Anyone wanna take bets on how badly they'll screw it up? Either we'll have the characters all aged up to college, or at least high school, and likely if they do keep them young, we'll have them played by older actors. Plus you can expect even less realistic violence.

Although there are striking similarities between the two (a group of teenagers pitted against each other on a secluded island, casualties are announced over a loudspeaker), the two are executed in completely different ways. The only aspect The Hunger Games can flaunt over BR is its more developed reasoning behind the 'games' and a firm root in politics. In every other way, Battle Royale is better and more enjoyable. It has the tone of an 80's kids fantasy, like The Goonies or Gremlins, and although it features a bunch of kids brutally murdering each other, the goal is not to sicken the audience. The violence is broken up with bits of humor, mostly dealing with juvenile crushes, and a classical score that brings a certain flippancy to the material. Compared to The Hunger Games, the characters are more believable as kids because of there references to cliques, crushes, and the fantastic flashback/dream sequences that shed light on their consciences. The convincing performances from the entire cast contribute to this immensely. Despite the constant killing, Battle Royale is a non stop thrill ride that never once sags or becomes monotonous. Each kill is unique in its own way. The film doesn't really have time to meditate on the deaths themselves, which is good because if the weight behind every single death was measured, the film would be 3 hours long and a lot less fun. Instead, the pacing is perfect and Battle Royale remains a genuine adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Watching it, it's kind of hard to believe that it was made in the year 2000. Director Kinji Fukasaku shot it like it was made in the mid-to late 70's, with lots of dolly shots, hand-held shots, and long zooms. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the whole film gives off a retro-vibe. Perhaps it's the color tone. Whatever it is, it makes Battle Royale feel like a long lost classic.

The fear of a situation of being pitted in a life or death situation was well-captured, and overall the acting was very good, especially considering the fact that besides Beat Takeshi, all of the other central are played by relative newcomers.This may seem like an extremely violent film at face value, but Fukasaku tries hard not to overdo the violence and gore, and holds either a certain respect for or a certain humor of the portrayal of death (the one over-the-top scene seems more comedic than sickening, and seems fitting, due to the character's role as an antagonist). Because of the strive for realistic death, and because of the good acting in the scenes between the violence, characters are able to grow. Death of some of the more central characters begin to carry emotional weight, despite the cast of 40-odd characters packed into a 2 hour film. This is where I found Battle Royale a good film; despite amazingly short screen times for most of the characters, Fukasaku is still able to make us care about them, to sympathize with a position we will never find ourself in.Now on to a completely different topic... As for this ""Director's cut"" from Amazon, I found it included some nice additional footage, from typical cast reviews to video of the whole cast celebrating Fukasaku's birthday. However, the quality of the picture of these as well as the movie was a bit grainy and of a lower quality than I'm used to, to the point where the DVD feels a bit like a bootleg. And because of the more than modest price of the DVD, I'd personally recommend you first look for other options.

597274,AETMW32J8CZJU,B00005JL99,C. Young,"[0, 0]","I stumbled upon this movie after reading Suzanne Collins' ""Hunger Games"" and seeing how everyone keeps on comparing what happens in the book to this movie.  Just by reading about the premise, I had expected this to be some kind of a twisted exploitation film with lots of gratuitous violence.  But what I got is a thought-provoking film that is as relevant now as it was back when it was made at the beginning of the millenium.So the story takes place in the near future, when the government in Japan has collapsed and youngsters are allowed to run amock...causing chaos and fear among the adults.  In an effort to curb the growing violence perpetrated by the youth of the nation, the government came up with what is referred to as the BR act.  Each year, a 9th grade class would be randomly selected and driven to a desert island under the guise of a class field trip.  Once there, they will be given a bag of food, a piece of weapon, and told that they will have 2 days in which to kill each until there is only 1 left.  To keep everyone under check, and make sure that there will be a winner, all the students are forced to wear a collar around their neck that will explode and kill everyone if there is still more than 1 person left alive at the end of the 2-day period.Desipte what some people say about how violent this film is, I found the level of violence no more than what one would see in most R-rated movies these days.  The body count is high, but the cameras do not make a point to linger on the bloody scenes so that after the 1st couple scenes, the rest of the bloodbaths can no longer shock you.  Instead, you are allowed to focus on the nuanced relationships that develops between the students as some of them elect to follow the dictates of the game and turn on their friends, while others chose to rebel against the authority, to badn together and try to find ways to thwart the adults' plans for them.  For a film that starts out with a cast of 40+, the director did a very good job and developing the relationships and giving some of the characters personalities and enough background story so that you come to care about them.  There are also themes of trust, betrayal, friendship, and love peppered throughout the film...no small feat for a movie of this length.Ultimately, this is not so much a movie about mindless violence but a commentary on a society that has become increasingly out-of-touch with its youth.  I've often thought that with the advent of the Internet age, where instant gratification is more the norm than the exception, where graphic violence are readily dispensed with the click of the button...that coupled with the tremendous strides in terms of economic advancement many countries have experienced over the last decade, the youth of the world has become increasingly more and more self-entitled, less willing to put in the hard work, and generally have exhibited a lack of understanding when it comes to distinguishing right from wrong.  While the solution this movie came up with is ridiculous and extreme, it does provide some much needed food for thought.",4,Thought provoking,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,3107,"['stumbled', 'movie', 'reading', 'Suzanne', 'Collins', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'seeing', 'how', 'everyone', 'comparing', 'what', 'book', 'movie', 'Just', 'reading', 'premise', 'had', 'expected', 'be', 'kind', 'twisted', 'exploitation', 'film', 'lots', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'what', 'got', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'relevant', 'now', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'beginning', 'millenium.So', 'story', 'place', 'near', 'future', 'when', 'government', 'Japan', 'collapsed', 'youngsters', 'are', 'allowed', 'run', 'amock', 'causing', 'chaos', 'fear', 'adults', 'effort', 'curb', 'growing', 'violence', 'perpetrated', 'youth', 'nation', 'government', 'came', 'up', 'what', 'referred', 'BR', 'act', 'year', '9th', 'grade', 'class', 'would', 'be', 'randomly', 'selected', 'driven', 'desert', 'island', 'guise', 'class', 'field', 'trip', 'Once', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'bag', 'food', 'piece', 'weapon', 'told', 'will', 'have', '2', 'days', 'kill', 'only', '1', 'left', 'keep', 'everyone', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'winner', 'students', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'collar', 'neck', 'will', 'explode', 'kill', 'everyone', 'still', 'more', '1', 'person', 'left', 'alive', 'end', '2-day', 'period.Desipte', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'how', 'violent', 'film', 'found', 'level', 'violence', 'more', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'most', 'R-rated', 'movies', 'days', 'body', 'count', 'high', 'cameras', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'point', 'linger', 'bloody', 'scenes', '1st', 'couple', 'scenes', 'rest', 'bloodbaths', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'shock', 'Instead', 'are', 'allowed', 'focus', 'nuanced', 'relationships', 'students', 'elect', 'follow', 'dictates', 'game', 'turn', 'friends', 'others', 'chose', 'rebel', 'authority', 'badn', 'together', 'try', 'find', 'ways', 'thwart', 'adults', 'plans', 'film', 'out', 'cast', '40+', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'developing', 'relationships', 'giving', 'characters', 'personalities', 'enough', 'background', 'story', 'come', 'care', 'are', 'also', 'themes', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'friendship', 'love', 'peppered', 'film', 'small', 'feat', 'movie', 'length.Ultimately', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'mindless', 'violence', 'commentary', 'society', 'become', 'increasingly', 'out-of-touch', 'youth', ""'ve"", 'often', 'thought', 'advent', 'Internet', 'age', 'where', 'instant', 'gratification', 'more', 'norm', 'exception', 'where', 'graphic', 'violence', 'are', 'readily', 'dispensed', 'click', 'button', 'coupled', 'tremendous', 'strides', 'terms', 'economic', 'advancement', 'many', 'countries', 'have', 'experienced', 'last', 'decade', 'youth', 'world', 'become', 'increasingly', 'more', 'more', 'self-entitled', 'less', 'willing', 'put', 'hard', 'work', 'generally', 'have', 'exhibited', 'lack', 'understanding', 'when', 'distinguishing', 'right', 'wrong', 'solution', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'extreme', 'provide', 'much', 'needed', 'food', 'thought']",N/A

It was in fact the controversy created by it that helped to make it sought after by some. So what is the basis for this controversy and what is really so bad about a movie that is as great work of political satire as there is out there? Well, read on to find out.Battle Royale takes place in Japan during a time in which the insolence and lack of motivation of the populous has driven the government into action. In order to stop the development of so many good-for-nothing people in society, the BR (Battle Royale) Act was passed. Essentially the act is used as a way to motivate students and weed out the weak from the strong and as such make society more productive. The way it goes about this however is a bit out of the ordinary. Once a year, a ninth grade class is randomly selected to participate. In the instance shown by the movie a class leaves to go on a field trip and along the way become drugged and shipped to an island where the ""event"" will take place. The event being a three day long battle royale in which only one person is allowed to come away alive or else everyone will be killed. Putting friend against friend, how do the children respond to the order they have been given. Supplied with weapons and provisions, can they really turn against the others and kill them in cold blood, or is there anyway that trust can be found amongst the others?The cast does an amazing job of portraying the twisted emotions that are felt within the students and even their former teacher (played wonderfully by Takeshi Kitano) who is put in charge of overseeing the entire affair. It is a profound look into the human psyche as well as a look at the overbearing opressive that the government is capable of holding over its people if not kept in check.There really is no reason that the movie has been unable to be released in places such as America, but it is pretty obvious that with all of the over the top violence that takes place all involving ninth graders, it would definately come under fire should it ever be widely released. It is a movie that will both shock and awe viewers a like, and despite how shocked one may be they can't help but feel the overall power and message of the movie. It is truly one of film-makings most profound creations in recent decades and underneath all the shock and controversy, there is a profound message to be seen that is as true as any other.

As you know, this film has been banned in multiple countries and is not well-appreciated in its own. It breaks some pretty serious taboos . . . namely, young fresh-faced children hacking each other to bits:) Of course, the idea that the government has locked exploding collars around their tender necks is a horrific bonus!!Takeshi Kitano is FANTASTIC as the school teacher with an innocent yet disturbing crush on one of his pupils and an obsession with her baked goods (Ohhh, and wait until you see his painting!!)Likewise, the characters of Shuya and Noriko are spectacular in their roles. They bring likability to what should be an ""unlikeable"" film. Nonetheless, Kazuo Kiriyama and Mitsuko Souma easily steal the show! Kazuo volunteers to be in this massacre (apparently for the thrill)!! He has the looks of Johnny Depp matched with the endurance of Jason Vorhees (forgive the comparison!!) Meanwhile, Mitsuko presents us with the most complex character in the film: as a victim of (potential) sexual abuse and an uncaring mother, Mitsuko has learned not to trust anyone. Moreover, she has learned to use her sexuality to get through life (it's interesting to see how this aspect figures into combat).What may surprise you is how FUNNY (intentionally) this film is!!! The training video alone will have you in stitches (The adorable host makes exploding heads sound like a Saturday morning cartoon ""BOOM!"")!! TRUST ME - FUNNY STUFF!!!To be perfectly honest, I dread the American remake (slated for 2008 by NEW LINE). Part of the appeal is that this film is verboten!! NEW LINE, I am quite certain, will be content will an ""R"" rating for theaters . . . and that will be a shame. Additionally, the Japanese version has insanely BAD and AWKWARD translation which only heightens its amusing qualities.No, Battle Royale doesn't have the INSANE gore of Ichi the Killer, but it is faster-paced, has a simpler story-line, and in a way, is more shocking.You'll either love it or hate it . . . me, I LOVE IT!!!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.""The Hunger Games""? No, actually it's ""Battle Royale,"" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.A class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (""Battle Royale"") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.If you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a ""death zone,"" the collars explode. Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.It doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.""Battle Royale"" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But ""Battle Royale"" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?It also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.Fun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).Violent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, ""Battle Royale"" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive.

Okay, it's more violent then your typical film, it's also very entertaining and enlightening.  But more then anything &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a very serious social commentary.  And it really has nothing to do with the fall of respect and order in social structure like some may think.  The most important key in the film is survival and trust.  These students are put in this extreme situation and each person reacts and adjust in a very different manner.  The novel and the film are in fact a social commentary on how our instinct will overcome every emotion when backed into a far enough corner.  Some of the scenes in the movie were just too perfect in depicting such a human trait.  I was really impressed with some of the things that happened in the movie.Overall the acting is above average, nothing special, but then again good acting.  The direction of the film was great along with the great adaption to script.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it doesn't take away from the root of the film.  Already this film is being duplicated into other films.  Even Quentin Tarantino has stated that his feature &quot;Kill Bill&quot; has alot of influence from &quot;Battle Royale.&quot;  Surely to be classic in the coming years.At the time of this review, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; does not have a US studio version of the film on dvd.

Just the premise of 42 9th grade juvenile delinquents set loose on a deserted island with the objective of killing each other to win their own lives was intriguing.  It was very violent but not as bad as I expected.  It was no more violent than the director's cut of Robocop.  Still, a bunch of kids in school uniforms going on a murderous rampage was kind of unsettling.  It's not a wonder why it was pulled from Japanese theatres.  I don't think this will ever make it to US theatres without an NC-17 rating.There is a current of dark humor running through the film and it is for this that I give the movie 3 stars.

597292,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00005JL99,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[7, 9]","So much has been written about the film.  So much has been said.  So much has been debated, discussed, dissected, and so much has been praised or insulted or misunderstood.  Those of us who celebrate film will always owe a special debt to the people at Anchor Bay: for the first time since it was released, BATTLE ROYALE is now being made available - uncensored, uncut, unrated - in America.No doubt that BATTLE ROYALE's Blu-ray release was intended to coincide with the launch of another  book-turned-film-franchise, THE HUNGER GAMES, in theatres in March, 2012.  Clearly, that's some savvy marketing, as people from around the world have been arguing about the comparisons since the books by Suzanna Collins appeared.  To her credit, Ms. Collins claims that she'd never heard of BATTLE ROYALE, nor read the 1999 Japanese novel of the same name that the movie was based on.  I'll take her at her word, and I'll leave that debate to folks who've schooled themselves in those facts.In the not-too-distant-future, Japan's economy has collapsed.  As a result, unemployment is destroying the culture.  Crime is on the rise.  Hoping to keep its next generation under its control, the Japanese government passed The BR (`Battle Royale') Law, which requires one 9th grade class each year to be shipped off to an island.  Their mission?  Kill each other until only one person is left.  There are some other fine points to the game (i.e. each student is given a duffle full of supplies, the Island is broken into danger zones, etc.), but the message remains the same: 42 kids enter, 1 may leave.That simple concept practically explodes into one of the bloodiest, shocking flicks captured on film!As I said above, much has been written about ROYALE's violence, so much so that I'll take a pass on that topic.  Violence is violence - there isn't any escaping it - and, when buckets of blood rules at the box office, the film certainly delivers.  What fascinated me much more about this story is the way that the 42 students of the film created their own subcultures once they've been deposited on the island.  Some of them remain fiercely independent, while others are doggedly loyal to one another.  Some of them panic as a result of the circumstances, and they immediately turn on one another.  What's fascinating is that who they become as a result of the situation thrust upon them in many ways resembles an extension of who they were before it all when to heck in a handbasket.  The manipulative `losers' become even more manipulative in order to survive the game, just as the computer nerds quickly go to work on cracking the hard science behind their entrapment.  If anything, ROYALE shows - despite its joyous subversiveness - that who a person is at his core will inevitably dictate what he'll become when a new society comes calling.  Agree with it or not, that's a powerful message, and it clearly shows why ROYALE deserves much more study in the years ahead.  Now that it's available legitimately in the U.S., it'll hopefully gain an even greater following.As stated, this is a fully uncut restoration, and it's been given a first class treatment here.  While the disc boasts absolutely zero special features, I'm so appreciative of having a clean cut available to me that I don't believe I missed much.  The picture is fabulous (mostly), but there are a few scenes which clearly were either shot poorly `in the can' or were tinkered with in post-production (zoom ins), a choice that ultimately limited the quality.  You'll see instantly what I mean: three or four short cuts are covered in grain.  Sound is excellent - a noticeable improvement over the previous foreign DVD release I've had in my collection for a few years - which is nice because the film makes great use of some background audio and even a limited score.  Now all we need is a massive ""Intellectual Edition"" release which scores and scores and scores of commentaries, essays, features, and interviews about the picture.Maybe I'm overdoing it, and, if you think so, you'll have to pardon my excitement.  Those of us who've loved ROYALE privately for years are ecstatic to be treated to a terrific stateside release.  Yes, the film's dark.  Of course, it's a textbook example of subversive cinema at its finest.  It'll make you think, squeal, squirm.  Shock.  Joy.  Revenge.  And cookies.  Everything you could want in a picture is in here - somewhere - so, if you've never seen it, I encourage you to do it today.  Put the kids to bed.  Pop some fresh popcorn.  Dim the lights.  Prepare yourself for the darkest of dark tragedies - this modern day epic - and let the chips fall where they may.  Blood will be shed.  Oh, yes, it will.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, BATTLE ROYALE is an instant classic.  While the subject matter or elements of the presentation may disturb you, keep in mind that there will probably never be another film like it in your lifetime.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay provided me with a DVD screener copy for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",5,Finally!

597293,A3QXKF9B4WKDX9,B00005JL99,Emily,"[2, 5]","Loved the Hunger Games series (books), so naturally since there is so much comparison I had to read/watch Battle Royale before making any assumptions.The movie, though sickening and violent, somehow manages to draw in the audience with the interesting story lines of each character. Sometimes funny and always outrageous, Battle Royale will not be a movie that the viewer soon forgets. You get to know the children as they are taken down one by one, in an emotionally draining effort to understand the psychology of each other.For anyone who loves cinema, Battle Royale is a necessary watch. The mix of suspense, violence, comedy, and drama is utilized to its full extent by the director, who uses perfect timing in each of these categories. Together it creates a cinematic gem, a movie that is disturbing, creepy, sad and even at times a bit funny.

597294,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00005JL99,Ernest Jagger,"[25, 33]","Directed by the late Kinji Fukasaku, ""Battle Royale"" is a truly magnificent film, and is highly recommended. I first saw the film a few years ago at the urging of a friend and was not disappointed in the least. The film itself is based on the novel by Takami Koshun, which I have not yet had the chance to read. The films narrative deals with the escalating violence among the youth in Japan, and in particular, with the violence in schools. Is the violence that bad? Are things really going to hell in the classrooms? The Japanese authorities seem to think so. So how do the authorities set about disciplining the youth? Detention and expulsion? No, that won't work. With high unemployment, the youth will just wander the streets and cause mayhem. Something much more harsh and drastic must occur in order to capture the present youths attention.Moreover, the very fabric of the nation is at stake. How are the Japanese authorities going to set an example which will reverberate within their society? Well, for starters they pass a new law. So what! There are already laws on the books dealing with this kind of behavior---Right?. How will this new law change student behavior? Well, for starters, this is no ordinary law. This new law enacted by the government allows a quasi-military type militia to abduct students from selected schools and send them to an isolated island. But what ever for? Surely not a youth camp? There are enough of those already. No, this is something much more draconian and drastic.Further, things are about to get very extreme in this new youth controlled government. For starters, this militia has complete control over these students lives, and they will force the youth to play out a very twisted and cruel game. One like no other they have ever played. [With the exception of two ringers who volunteer for the game]. As these students are sent to an undisclosed site, they must face a horrifying reality: Schools out--welcome to Battle Royale. Director Fukasaku made the right decision to have actor Takeshi Kitano as the former school teacher who is the one in charge of this latest group of competitors. Who better for the role?. As the former school teacher of this new group chosen to compete in this years game of survival, he makes it a point early in the film to set the tone by letting the students know that this BATTLE ROYALE is no joke.And the point Takeshi Kitano makes with a couple of students in the beginning of the film is not lost on the other students. The students must kill each other in order to survive. Only when ONE of the students is left standing will the game come to an end. It is here where you see loyalties and friendships part ways, or strengthen. I like the way Kinji Fukasaku directed the film. This is not like ""Lord of the Flies"" as I read in one of the reviews. ""Battle Royale"" is a totally different take on a future 21st-century society of ADULTS, that have come to see unruly students as having to be dealt with severely in order to conform to a Japanese society that THEY feel is being threatened. This is a truly great film.

In a near future, the Japanese Government concludes that the downfall of the country is increasing due to the shallowness and free spirit of its youngsters. In order to make kids more motivated and capable, a special unit sends a high-school class to a desert island where the students will have to kill each other until only one survives. If they refuse to do that, they all will be killed within three days.Yes, this is a far fetched concept, still it works surprinsigly well and manages to be a superb comment on the grim, hopeless and desperate atmosphere that surrounds modern societies. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; isn`t an easy movie to watch, since some parts are truly shocking, gut-wrenching and unexpected, yet it`s a strong and memorable cinematic experience, different from most of the disposable and formulaic flicks around. It expertly mixes drama, tension, horror, action, humour and gore, managing to be compelling and consistent throughout.The character development is good enough, but it`s hard to develop so many characters (around 40) at once. It`s interesting to see how people react when they have to face such an extreme situation, acting under fear and suspition while dealing with their schoolmates. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; could easily have turned into a violent and empty sequence of action numbers with cool camera angles, but it wisely avoids that perspective and instead creates a gripping, multi-layered and complex narrative.This is a superb effort that approaches key subjects like the first steps into adulthood, the conditions of love and friendship, trust and commitment, loneliness and individualism, future choices, totalitary systems and life in general. A gloomy, dark and ambiguous achievement, this Kinji Fukasaku effort delivers a surreal social commentary with some incredibly clever, poignant and creative ideas.An unforgettable battle.",4,"Teachers, Leave Them Kids Alone",1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,2039,"['Certainly', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'impressive', 'movies', 'last', 'years', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'superb', 'execution', 'near', 'future', 'Japanese', 'Government', 'downfall', 'country', 'increasing', 'due', 'shallowness', 'free', 'spirit', 'youngsters', 'order', 'make', 'kids', 'more', 'motivated', 'capable', 'special', 'unit', 'high-school', 'class', 'desert', 'island', 'where', 'students', 'will', 'have', 'kill', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'refuse', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'three', 'days.Yes', 'far', 'fetched', 'concept', 'still', 'surprinsigly', 'well', 'be', 'superb', 'comment', 'grim', 'hopeless', 'desperate', 'atmosphere', 'modern', 'societies', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 't', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'parts', 'are', 'truly', 'shocking', 'gut-wrenching', 'unexpected', 's', 'strong', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'different', 'most', 'disposable', 'formulaic', 'flicks', 'expertly', 'mixes', 'drama', 'tension', 'horror', 'action', 'humour', 'gore', 'managing', 'be', 'compelling', 'consistent', 'throughout.The', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'enough', 's', 'hard', 'develop', 'so', 'many', 'characters', '40', 'once', 's', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'when', 'have', 'face', 'extreme', 'situation', 'acting', 'fear', 'suspition', 'dealing', 'schoolmates', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'turned', 'violent', 'empty', 'sequence', 'action', 'numbers', 'cool', 'camera', 'angles', 'wisely', 'perspective', 'instead', 'gripping', 'multi-layered', 'complex', 'narrative.This', 'superb', 'effort', 'key', 'subjects', 'first', 'steps', 'adulthood', 'conditions', 'love', 'friendship', 'trust', 'commitment', 'loneliness', 'individualism', 'future', 'choices', 'totalitary', 'systems', 'life', 'general', 'gloomy', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'achievement', 'Kinji', 'Fukasaku', 'effort', 'surreal', 'social', 'commentary', 'incredibly', 'clever', 'poignant', 'creative', 'ideas.An', 'unforgettable', 'battle']",N/A

597305,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,B00005JL99,Henry Platte,"[3, 5]","Like some of the other reviewers here, I had read the more-easily-obtained book before seeing the movie - enjoying it very much - and went in knowing the premise. To begin with, Battle Royale, in all its forms, is an exceptional work of creative fiction, and I think that of its three forms (movie, book and manga), the movie may well be the best.In praise of Battle Royale in general, it is first of all a very engaging and moving story, with a simple yet carefully thought-out premise, an intricate plot and compelling human dynamics. I knew that much when I read the book. But the movie has increased the entire product in my estimation, and deserves a good deal of praise seperate from and above the book.For one thing, I think the film is more moving. It really brings home how horrible and tragic the premise is; which is sometimes lost in the pulpy exuberance with which the plot of the book unfolds. The actors convey the situation of utterly doomed children so perfectly, conveying all the shadings of paranoia, hatred and outright psychosis; it really must have been a feat to find so many young, good actors. The film's biggest surprise, though, is the change that was made to the 'villain,' played here by the legendary Beat Takeshi. What was a stock evil character in the novel becomes a richer, more striking, although perhaps not entirely consistent personality in the film, giving it an emotional dimension even beyond the game itself.I think the movie handles the violence about right. It doesn't cut away from the gore, but there's no excessive spurting of blood. The fight scenes aren't immaculately choreographed, but that may be for the best, considering what the film is really about.There are two other touches in the film which I think are absolutley brilliant - which won't mean anything to people who haven't seen it, but to those who have, and are in the habit of reading reviews of products they've already bought in order to contrast their own opinions - weren't the instructional video and the 'radio exercises' pure genius?There are a couple of totally minor points on which I thought the movie stumbled. For one thing, although of course they had to cut out a lot of substance to fit the running time, they cut out some of the best characters and interactions, such as Sho Tsukioka and Mitsuko's elaborately treacherous dispatching of the pair of boys.  I also thought Kazuo was a more interesting character in the book - by far _the_ most interesting character in the book - but it might have been neccesary to simplify him in this way for the film, so that it could focus on more important dynamics.I now actually think that BR, more than an enjoyable, higher-than-average quality pop culture artifact, may be an important and defining statement in this day and age. It shows us, for one thing, that stories still have the power to shock and arouse sympathy, even from BR's most likely audience, the very jaded youth who feature in the story. Also, I think it accurately reflects, in a very abstracted and metaphorical way, the plight of a young generation in an uncertain and perilous world. I could be reaching with this, but I will at least say that BR is an amazing overall _product_ which should be examined by anyone with any interest in the humanities.",5,I think I'm in love,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,3293,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'had', 'read', 'more-easily-obtained', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'very', 'much', 'went', 'knowing', 'premise', 'begin', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'forms', 'exceptional', 'work', 'creative', 'fiction', 'think', 'three', 'forms', 'movie', 'book', 'manga', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best.In', 'praise', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'general', 'first', 'very', 'engaging', 'moving', 'story', 'simple', 'yet', 'carefully', 'thought-out', 'premise', 'intricate', 'plot', 'compelling', 'human', 'dynamics', 'knew', 'much', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'increased', 'entire', 'product', 'estimation', 'good', 'deal', 'praise', 'seperate', 'book.For', 'one', 'thing', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'moving', 'really', 'home', 'how', 'horrible', 'premise', 'sometimes', 'lost', 'pulpy', 'exuberance', 'plot', 'book', 'actors', 'convey', 'situation', 'utterly', 'doomed', 'children', 'so', 'perfectly', 'conveying', 'shadings', 'paranoia', 'hatred', 'outright', 'psychosis', 'really', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'feat', 'find', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'good', 'actors', 'film', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'change', 'was', 'made', ""'villain"", 'played', 'here', 'legendary', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'What', 'was', 'stock', 'evil', 'character', 'novel', 'richer', 'more', 'striking', 'perhaps', 'not', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'personality', 'film', 'giving', 'emotional', 'dimension', 'even', 'game', 'itself.I', 'think', 'movie', 'violence', 'right', ""n't"", 'cut', 'away', 'gore', 'excessive', 'spurting', 'blood', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'immaculately', 'choreographed', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'considering', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about.There', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'touches', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'absolutley', 'brilliant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'who', 'have', 'are', 'habit', 'reading', 'reviews', 'products', ""'ve"", 'already', 'bought', 'order', 'contrast', 'own', 'opinions', 'were', ""n't"", 'instructional', 'video', ""'radio"", 'pure', 'genius', 'are', 'couple', 'totally', 'minor', 'points', 'thought', 'movie', 'stumbled', 'one', 'thing', 'course', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'lot', 'substance', 'fit', 'running', 'time', 'cut', 'out', 'best', 'characters', 'interactions', 'such', 'Sho', 'Tsukioka', 'Mitsuko', 'elaborately', 'treacherous', 'dispatching', 'pair', 'boys', 'also', 'thought', 'Kazuo', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'book', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'neccesary', 'simplify', 'way', 'film', 'could', 'focus', 'more', 'important', 'dynamics.I', 'now', 'actually', 'think', 'BR', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'higher-than-average', 'quality', 'pop', 'culture', 'artifact', 'may', 'be', 'important', 'defining', 'statement', 'day', 'age', 'one', 'thing', 'stories', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'shock', 'arouse', 'sympathy', 'even', 'BR', 'most', 'likely', 'audience', 'very', 'jaded', 'youth', 'who', 'feature', 'story', 'Also', 'think', 'accurately', 'very', 'abstracted', 'metaphorical', 'way', 'plight', 'young', 'generation', 'uncertain', 'perilous', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'reaching', 'will', 'least', 'say', 'BR', 'amazing', 'overall', '_product_', 'should', 'be', 'examined', 'anyone', 'interest', 'humanities']",N/A

It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is  quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard. The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the cock crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ? The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people. The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations. The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque.

In many ways it delivers the same cocktail of dystopian social commentary and extreme violence as films such as A Clockwork Orange.It's very low budget so don't expect flawless effects or production but do expect solid pacing, a gory gusto and one of the finest ensemble performances you'll see from such a young cast. Battle Royale skates into taboo areas and shocks the audience with visceral moral situations but despite the violence and bleak outcome for most of the cast, it's a haunting film that would simply never be made in the USA.",5,"An original, shocking and genre-bending movie",1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1213,"['taken', 'couple', 'days', 'really', 'assess', 'what', 'feel', 'film', 'usually', 'sign', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'time', 'digest', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'best', 'version', 'making', 'people', 'fight', 'death', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'easily', 'trumping', 'Running', 'Man', 'adding', 'significantly', 'more', 'layers', 'complexity', 'Hunger', 'Games.Many', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'film', 'look', 'cultural', 'legacy', 'country', 'came', 'relationship', 'older', 'younger', 'generations', 'Japan', 'volumes', 'Japanese', 'government', 'expected', 'riots', 'result', 'film', 'several', 'countries', 'banned', 'release', 'many', 'ways', 'same', 'cocktail', 'dystopian', 'social', 'commentary', 'extreme', 'violence', 'films', 'such', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange.It', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'flawless', 'effects', 'production', 'do', 'expect', 'solid', 'pacing', 'gory', 'gusto', 'one', 'finest', 'ensemble', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'see', 'young', 'cast', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'taboo', 'areas', 'audience', 'visceral', 'moral', 'situations', 'violence', 'bleak', 'outcome', 'most', 'cast', 'haunting', 'film', 'would', 'simply', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'USA']",N/A

597318,A3BV3D8TOBBBJU,B00005JL99,Jason Acosta,"[0, 0]","First of all before I start, I would like to say that this movie is most definitely NOT for the weak or faint of heart. It contains very graphic violence from start to finish. Now onto the review.*NOTE THIS IS BASED ON THE UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION OF THE FILMBattle Royale (2000) is a Japanese film from Kinji Fukasaku. The film revolves around 42 students chosen from a class that are under the impression of going on a &#34;study trip&#34;. However it soon becomes clear that it is more then that. The students quickly are told that they have been chosen to participate in the annual &#34;Battle Royale&#34; where 42 students are forced onto an island or other piece of area with 3 days to kill each other until only one remains. Personally, I adored this film. It is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time with it's gritty story, violent images, and strong character morals in the film. Throughout the film we soon learn who will participate and who will not. 2 students, Named Kiriyama Kazuo and Mitsuko Souma, decide to partake in the game and kill until they are the only ones left. Kiriyama, is just down right insane. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants and kills plenty people throughout the film. Mitsuko on the other hand, is insane but is emotionally insane and we find sympathy for her later on. While they decide to play three kids, Kawada a former victor, and Shuya and Noriko, 2 friends trying to survive, try rallying up as many students to escape the island.The acting in the film varies from character. The top 4 actors that stood out for me were: 4.) Chiaki Kuriyama. She plays the self-centered Chigusa Takako who thinks of her best friend in time of need, and when she fights, oh she does fight. The courage of this girl and the way the actress matched her character from the book, is amazing.  I would say that this film was her &#34;breakout role&#34;, since she later starred in films like &#34;Kill Bill&#34; by Quentin Tarantino. 3.) Takeshi Kitano. This man plays the 7th grade teacher of the students. Whether he is making extremely dark jokes to the class when they are killing each other, or giving a speech to his daughter, he delivers the lines which such perfection and a matching tone. 2.) Tatsuya Fujiwara. This young man plays Shuya Nanahara, one of the protagonists of the film. Save your tissues for this guy because when he plays the crying scenes, it extremely convincing. He also matched the sympathetic Shuya from the book. For a teenager at the time of filming, he obviously had a future in acting. And finally 1.) Kou Shibasaki or known as the sexually-violent and beautiful Mitsuko Souma. Words cannot describe the acting of this girl. And I mean that in a good way. Whether it is happiness from killing someone, being disgusted by sympathy, or being a plain out bitch, this girl can play anything you give her. In the end, though killing all those people, you can't help but feel sympathy for her and maybe a very large contributing factor was the actress herself. Later, Kou became a successful J-pop singer, offered a role in &#34;Kill Bill&#34; as well, a role in &#34;Chakushin Ari&#34; and &#34;47 Ronin&#34;.In the end, &#34;Batoru Rowairu&#34; is an over-the-top violent film, that teaches you some lesson, leaves you in tears and wanting more. Before &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, &#34;Battle Royale&#34; was slashing away (with a sickle).

597322,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JL99,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","""Battle Royale"" become a cult favorite in many corners of the world. Fukasaku wanted this movie to be viewed by all ages, but putting its gory depictions of death and blood into consideration the ratings would not allow it. The film has provoked outrage, and I think this was the intent. Children are viewed as being innocent, yet here, we see them killing each other in gruesome ways, with or without remorse. Being that I only seen this twice but on my third watch it still gets me.As good as this is there are plot holes to it, especially near the ending. Some of the dialogue is too melodramatic and ""cheesy"", but it did most certainly not bring down the film's brilliance. But what it was missing most of all was character development. There's some fine acting, and some bad acting, but the main characters all acted well and held up this film. Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) and Shougo Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) are actually given a back story, motivations, and their desires for surviving the Battle Royale. But the other 39 students are not complete strangers to the viewer. Supporting character Mitsuko Souma (Kou Shibasaki) is given an in depth biography of who she really is, rather than just a cunning huntress out for revenge. In the Special Edition DVD, there is an extra scene containing a flashback to her childhood, depicting of how horrible her childhood was, and what caused her to act the way she acted in the movie and the novel. The other cast members did a superb job on bringing their characters to life. Indeed the characters are such familiar types that we are able to learn a great deal about them, though we may only see them for five seconds, because we have all come across them before in our own lives. There are the popular girls, the outcasts, bullies, jocks, the nerd who had more gel in his hair than The Fonz, and that one promiscuous girl that your mother told you to stay away from. This quick characterization works perfectly in the film and is enhanced by the performances of the young actors and actresses who actually look and behave like a real class.I believe the initial intent of this film was to be a satire, possibly on the way in which Japanese culture views children and authority, but having no experience of the Japanese culture, I cannot do more than speculate. The extreme situation brings out the characters, and with forty of the children on the island, there is a lot to take in with their own story, or at least a strong personality. However, despite its faults, ""Battle Royale"" is an insight into humanity, and its darker side. We question whether we could kill our friends, but this film does make you wonder what would happen if you were in such a situation. ""Battle Royale"" is often misunderstood and it isn't mindlessly violent, but provocatively violent. The fact that children are those involved adds to the weight of them film tremendously.

597324,A3P9EH5DY3GEEO,B00005JL99,J. Gower,"[7, 12]","I rented Battle Royale due to the number of multiple-star reviews, but by the end I wondered what all the hype was about.  Yes, it's pretty clear that The Hunger Games owes some of its ideas to Battle Royale.  The basic concept and many of the ideas within the film (zones, ""off-limits"" areas, gangs working in tandem, deceit, etc.) were very much a part of Battle Royale long before the Hunger Games series was penned.But when I watched the film, what overwhelmed me was not the violence but the melodrama of the whole thing.  I lost count of the pained expressions, the looks of yearning, and declarations of unrequited love. The movie had just about every teen movie trope I'd seen in countless other films.  The geek.  The abused victim with a drunken parent.  The good boy.  The bad girl.  The girl gang.  The computer geek with a plan.  All of them were written with the expertise and subtlety of a screenwriter with no more than a couple high school Literature classes under their belt.  The characters were so broadly written, and cliche'd, that the sheer over-the-top emotion was hard to sympathize with.I also was surprised at the glaring warnings about how the film was rated R-15 (or whatever it's called in Japan), where anyone under the age of 15 is banned from watching the film.  Other than a few squibs, the violence primarily consisted of fake blood spray, stains on shirts, and an awful lot of cgi blood.  In fact, a film like this would barely rate a PG-13 in the U.S.  I could also remember virtually no profanity that would have justified anything more than a PG.  The violence is only shocking, perhaps, in the manner in which it was perpetrated against teenagers, but it was actually rather sanitized compared to films like Kick Ass and even Attack The Block (itself not terribly shocking.)So in the end, you get an over-the-top, melodramatic, and at times nonsensical film of attrition that follows a pretty routine formula to an end that most anyone could have predicted from the start.  There were few twists and turns, an awful lot of CGI blood, and one HECK of a laundry bill at the end.

Movies like this, for me, only come around once in 5+ years.While the premise of BR is weak (how in the world does randomly choosing kids to kill each other scare other kids straight?  Choosing messed up kids to kill each other off yes, but randomly?) there is so much of everything else done right that it's very easily overlooked.There are some cheesy / overdramatic moments in the movie.  However, the concept of the BR and what happens to ordinary teens in this extraordinary situation is done brilliantly.  Ordinarily harmless teen cliques / social annoyances, now become magnified to the point of life and death.  What happens to friends when their choices are kill or be killed?  What happens when the social contract is null and void?Spoiler Alert!!!! -------------One of the most dramatic moments include the scene when a student's collar-bomb is triggered by the teacher Kitano.  There is no compassion from his classmates just a mad scramble to keep away.  Even his best friend pushes him away helplessly.  But after that mad scramble we see humanity still there but pushed down helplessly by terrible circumstances.  And my favorite moment: Shogo Kawada and his girlfiend are the only ones left alive with the BR running out of time.  As they try to rest, the collar bombs starts to count down since there are still 2 contestants alive.  They look at each other and hug.  What follows next just blew my mind away as did many of the movie's very memorable moments.The ""Rules"" of BR are well thought out as is the choices of ""Weapons"" given to the teens.  Not all the kids are armed to the teeth.  Some get useless items or useful items but not as direct weapons.The music is enjoyable and very memorable but I hated the ending pop song which seemed all wrong and disjointed with the rest of  the film.  I would be surprised if it was chosen by Kinji san as opposed to a marketing vehicle.  BTW i believe it is also used as the theme song for a japanese curry (vermont?).While I was geniuninely interested in what happened to the students I did not find much of the violence particularly disturbing or emotional.  For that I refer you to any Quentin flick where torture is involved or City of God where Ze meets up with the Shorty gang.  I find violence disturbing when it involves a defenseless victim.  That only happens once or twice in this movie.  It's not so much the violence that is shocking as it is the circumstances surrounding that violence like the collar bomb and Kawada and his girlfirend.  This is certainly no, ""yawn... another person died"" in movies like Van Helsing or unfortunately BR2, the sequel to this film.However much you may enjoy BR, be warned about BR2 which is a load of crap.  Seriously.And as a postscript you gotta take some of these 1 stars with a grain of salt because the same people who gave BR 1 star gave Van Helsing (piece of sheet) AND I, Robot 4 stars!!  Actually, I'm kinda glad that is the case.  If the same people who gave those works or crap 4 Stars had given 4 or 5 stars to BR I'd be embarassed.",5,The social contract is null and void.,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,3155,"['BR', 'had', 'riveted', 'first', 'opening', 'shots', 'blood', 'stained', 'smiling', 'girl', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'Movies', 'only', 'come', 'around', 'once', '5+', 'premise', 'BR', 'weak', 'how', 'world', 'randomly', 'choosing', 'kids', 'kill', 'other', 'scare', 'other', 'kids', 'straight', 'Choosing', 'messed', 'up', 'kids', 'kill', 'other', 'yes', 'randomly', 'so', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'done', 'right', 'very', 'easily', 'are', 'cheesy', '/', 'overdramatic', 'moments', 'movie', 'However', 'concept', 'BR', 'what', 'ordinary', 'teens', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'Ordinarily', 'harmless', 'teen', 'cliques', '/', 'social', 'annoyances', 'now', 'become', 'magnified', 'point', 'life', 'death', 'What', 'friends', 'when', 'choices', 'are', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'What', 'when', 'social', 'contract', 'null', 'void', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '-One', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'include', 'scene', 'when', 'student', 'collar-bomb', 'triggered', 'teacher', 'Kitano', 'compassion', 'classmates', 'just', 'mad', 'scramble', 'keep', 'away', 'Even', 'best', 'friend', 'away', 'helplessly', 'mad', 'scramble', 'see', 'humanity', 'still', 'pushed', 'down', 'helplessly', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'favorite', 'moment', 'Shogo', 'Kawada', 'girlfiend', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'left', 'alive', 'BR', 'running', 'out', 'time', 'try', 'rest', 'collar', 'bombs', 'count', 'down', 'are', 'still', '2', 'contestants', 'alive', 'look', 'other', 'hug', 'What', 'next', 'just', 'blew', 'mind', 'away', 'did', 'many', 'movie', 'very', 'memorable', 'moments.The', 'Rules', 'BR', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'choices', 'Weapons', 'given', 'teens', 'Not', 'kids', 'are', 'armed', 'teeth', 'get', 'useless', 'items', 'useful', 'items', 'not', 'direct', 'weapons.The', 'music', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'memorable', 'hated', 'ending', 'pop', 'song', 'seemed', 'wrong', 'disjointed', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'was', 'chosen', 'Kinji', 'san', 'opposed', 'marketing', 'vehicle', 'BTW', 'i', 'believe', 'also', 'used', 'theme', 'song', 'japanese', 'curry', 'vermont', 'was', 'geniuninely', 'interested', 'what', 'happened', 'students', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'violence', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'emotional', 'refer', 'Quentin', 'flick', 'where', 'torture', 'involved', 'City', 'God', 'where', 'Ze', 'up', 'Shorty', 'gang', 'find', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'when', 'defenseless', 'victim', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'violence', 'shocking', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'violence', 'collar', 'bomb', 'Kawada', 'girlfirend', 'certainly', 'no', 'yawn', 'person', 'died', 'movies', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'unfortunately', 'BR2', 'sequel', 'film.However', 'much', 'may', 'enjoy', 'BR', 'be', 'warned', 'BR2', 'load', 'crap', 'Seriously.And', 'postscript', 'got', 'ta', 'take', '1', 'stars', 'grain', 'salt', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'BR', '1', 'star', 'gave', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'piece', 'sheet', 'Robot', '4', 'stars', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'glad', 'case', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'works', 'crap', '4', 'Stars', 'had', 'given', '4', '5', 'stars', 'BR', ""'d"", 'be', 'embarassed']",N/A

597336,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00005JL99,kacunnin,"[2, 2]","The film version of Koushun Takami's novel BATTLE ROYALE makes major changes that may annoy fans of the book.  The biggest change is the central premise behind the story.  In the novel, ""Battle Royale"" is part of the totalitarian government's program designed to terrorize the populace and prevent resistance - each year, 42 middle school students are taken from their families and forced to participate in a brutal competition that will result in the deaths of all but one of the children.  In the film version, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, ""Battle Royale"" is the government's response to a rash of teenage violence and misbehavior.  The film opens with scenes of students refusing to go to school, openly resisting authority, and even violently assaulting adults (including a teacher).  As stated in the film, ""The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, aka the BR [or Battle Royale] Act.""  This changes things greatly - while the children in the novel are completely innocent middle school students being manipulated by an evil government, the children in the film are portrayed as miscreants who brought the horror on themselves.Another major change is the role of the instructor who directs the program - in the novel, this is Sakamochi, who explains the rules to the students and begins the terrorism; in the film, the instructor is a new character, Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), who is a former teacher of the students (and who has a strange and unexplained relationship with Noriko (Aki Maeda), the young female protagonist).  The difference here is striking - while Sakamochi was portrayed as a heartless symbol of the totalitarian government, Kitano demonstrates human qualities that allow us to sympathize with him (at least on some level) by the end of the film.Whether these changes bother you or not will probably determine whether you like the film.  I found it to be interesting and engaging, but never quite real.  As expected, there is a lot of violence, but it reminded me more of the kind of thing found in popular video games rather than anything that might actually happen in real life.  Perhaps that was the director's point - he seems to want to numb his audience with over-the-top scenes of gunfire, slashing, gushing blood, and exploding body parts.  I actually found some of the battle scenes laughable - more than a few times I wondered how anyone could absorb so many rounds of machine-gun fire and still keep getting up!It's also a little hard to take all the middle school crush stuff that permeates the film (there is plenty of this in the novel, too, but because the characters seemed more real and fleshed out it made more sense; here it just seems absurd).  The central couple, Noriko and Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) are believable, but others don't work as well.Overall, the film version of BATTLE ROYALE can be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie, but as an adaptation of the novel it's not very successful.

Well, quite the contrary (despite my misleading title). Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo in Kill Bill) fans will be disappointed here since her role here was akin to being a cameo, although she excelled in her brief part. Not surprisingly after the success of Kill Bill, the name &quot;Battle Royale&quot; lingered among die-hard movie fans. Here, Kill Bill fans will realised that it's quite a different movie.George Orwell speaks of the dangers of totalitarian governments and &quot;political correctness&quot; forced to the masses. The movie Equilibrium was such an example and although &quot;Battle Royale&quot; may seems like it has no relevence to Orwell's 1984, it still depicts the destruction of a group of people under hands of a regime hell bent on forcing their &quot;political correctness&quot;. The first deaths already occured even before the commencement of Battle Royale when the character Nobu tried to rebel against Kitano sensei only to have to be blown off by the necklace stuck on his neck. And sensitive, discerning viewers will watch in horror as the students run around the battlefield like mices in lab experiments, killing each other in various de-humanizing ways, often against their whims. To add more surreal feeling to the movie, you should watch how the training video girl explains the rules of Battle Royale with such childish enthusiasm, and the way sensei Kitano announces the casualties of Battle Royale in casual, and at times cheeky manner.Battle Royale, as I said, is a mockery to &quot;Survivor&quot;, where we often see reality show contestants lie, cheat, and deceive their way into victory. In this movie, reality show is a minefield where fiddling around could mean instant death. One striking example is the lighthouse scene where a normal meal with comrades becomes a bloodbath because a girl ate a meal that was supposed to poison Nanahara. Distrust and emnity from beginning exploded into a grudge fury, and you don't need to guess what happens next.Overall, it is one of the best movies I've ever watch, with all-around decent acting by cast, grippling, yet consistent narrative, and a great soundtrack. The use of classical music complimented with occational pop and rock is great, although my only gripe is the use of &quot;Dies Irae&quot; from Verdi's Requiem not dramatic enough.P/S: For fans curious of Battle Royale II (a.k.a Requiem), it isn't the a Battle Royale at all, instead a Japanese Saving Private Ryan (with even an Omaha Beach re-depiction scene!) film where a bunch of students are forced to an island to annilate the terrorist leader Nanahara, a survivor of Battle Royale who waged war against all adults.",5,Kill Bill meets Orwell's 1984 (or more like it),1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,2827,"['Battle', 'Royale', 'might', 'be', 'perceived', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'quot', 'Survivor', 'quot', 'where', 'bunch', 'students', 'battling', 'other', 'death', 'style', 'Well', 'quite', 'contrary', 'misleading', 'title', 'Chiaki', 'Kuriyama', 'Gogo', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here', 'role', 'here', 'was', 'akin', 'being', 'cameo', 'excelled', 'brief', 'part', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'success', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'name', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'lingered', 'die-hard', 'movie', 'fans', 'Here', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'fans', 'will', 'realised', 'quite', 'different', 'movie.George', 'Orwell', 'speaks', 'dangers', 'totalitarian', 'governments', 'quot', 'political', 'correctness', 'quot', 'forced', 'masses', 'movie', 'Equilibrium', 'was', 'such', 'example', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'may', 'relevence', 'Orwell', '1984', 'still', 'destruction', 'group', 'people', 'hands', 'regime', 'hell', 'bent', 'forcing', 'quot', 'political', 'correctness', 'quot', 'first', 'deaths', 'already', 'occured', 'even', 'commencement', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'when', 'character', 'Nobu', 'tried', 'rebel', 'Kitano', 'only', 'have', 'be', 'blown', 'off', 'necklace', 'stuck', 'neck', 'sensitive', 'discerning', 'viewers', 'will', 'watch', 'horror', 'students', 'run', 'battlefield', 'mices', 'lab', 'experiments', 'killing', 'other', 'various', 'de-humanizing', 'ways', 'often', 'whims', 'add', 'more', 'surreal', 'feeling', 'movie', 'should', 'watch', 'how', 'training', 'video', 'girl', 'rules', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'such', 'childish', 'enthusiasm', 'way', 'sensei', 'Kitano', 'casualties', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'casual', 'times', 'cheeky', 'manner.Battle', 'Royale', 'said', 'mockery', 'quot', 'Survivor', 'quot', 'where', 'often', 'see', 'reality', 'show', 'contestants', 'lie', 'cheat', 'deceive', 'way', 'victory', 'movie', 'reality', 'show', 'minefield', 'where', 'fiddling', 'around', 'could', 'mean', 'instant', 'death', 'One', 'striking', 'example', 'lighthouse', 'scene', 'where', 'normal', 'meal', 'comrades', 'bloodbath', 'girl', 'ate', 'meal', 'was', 'supposed', 'poison', 'Nanahara', 'Distrust', 'emnity', 'beginning', 'exploded', 'grudge', 'fury', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'guess', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watch', 'all-around', 'decent', 'acting', 'cast', 'grippling', 'yet', 'consistent', 'narrative', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'use', 'classical', 'music', 'complimented', 'occational', 'pop', 'rock', 'great', 'only', 'gripe', 'use', 'quot', 'Dies', 'Irae', 'quot', 'Verdi', 'Requiem', 'not', 'dramatic', 'enough.P/S', 'fans', 'curious', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'II', 'a.k.a', 'Requiem', ""n't"", 'Battle', 'Royale', 'instead', 'Japanese', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'even', 'Omaha', 'Beach', 're-depiction', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'bunch', 'students', 'are', 'forced', 'island', 'annilate', 'terrorist', 'leader', 'Nanahara', 'survivor', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'who', 'waged', 'war', 'adults']",N/A

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[99, 106]","With the emergence of ""The Hunger Games"" phenomenon of the last few years, the inevitable comparisons between that franchise and the cult novel ""Battle Royale"" by Koushun Takami have been plentiful.  Sure, the two do share strong thematic and narrative similarities, but each has a distinctly unique vibe and explores the back story behind the violence in a different way.  The film adaptation of ""Battle Royale"" by director Kenji Fukasaku garnered almost instant international notoriety in 2000 for its disturbingly bleak portrait of kids set upon one another in a violent death match.  Despite being banned and reviled by many, the story's visceral and emotional punch was hard to deny.  It was nominated for numerous Japanese Academy Awards including Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay and won that country's ""Popularity Award.""  The rumor that Hollywood was flirting with an American remake has been circulating for years, but some seem to think that the film adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" might have hurt the likelihood of this occurrence.  In any event, I never had high hopes that an American interpretation could rival the original.""Battle Royale"" is being released in two incarnations, a film only DVD/ Blu-ray or ""The Complete Collection"" DVD/Blu-ray.Film Only:  This includes the Director's Cut of the film.  First, the story is about a future Japan whose economy is in collapse and whose crime rate is spiraling out-of-control.  In an effort to temper this uptick in violence by the juvenile population, the government has sanctioned an annual contest.  In the movie, forty-two middle school aged students are dropped off and left to battle one another for survival.  They are armed and coerced into fighting, for there can be only one winner left alive.  As often as I've seen this movie, it never fails to shock and disturb me as it is exceptionally intense and powerful.  Some complain that it isn't as ""good"" as the source novel (which is a pretty common argument with most translations from the page to the screen), but I think this is a daring and audacious film that succeeds fully on its own merits.  I'm not, however, a huge fan of the Director's Cut.  I don't think the extra footage adds appreciable value to the movie and I don't love the extended finale.  This version has no special features.Complete Collection (4 discs):  The four discs are (1) Director's Cut of the film (see above), (2) Theatrical Cut, (3) 2003's ""Battle Royale II"" and (4) Bonus Content Disc.  While I would certainly consider the original ""Battle Royale"" as a classic, its sequel is less so.  It carries the same concept over to a new class with some variations on the original theme, but the major difference is that an underground plot by an unexpected terrorist cell plays a large part in this year's action.  It's solid enough, I like it.  It just lacks the emotional kick of the first film.Bonus Disc Content included in Complete Collection only.  This is on a standard DVD even in the Blu-Ray set (but all three films are on Blu-ray). The Making Of BATTLE ROYALE, BATTLE ROYALE Press Conference, Instructional Video: Birthday Version, Audition & Rehearsal Footage, Special Effects Comparison Featurette, Tokyo International Film Festival 2000, Battle Royale Documentary, Basketball Scene Rehearsals, Behind-The-Scenes Featurette, Filming On-Set, Original Theatrical Trailer, Special Edition TV Spot, TV Spot: Tarantino Version.

597341,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B00005JL99,Kolwynia,"[1, 1]","Battle Royale is a stylish, bloody action flick.  I enjoyed the movie and thought it was cool, but it basically cuts the heart out of the story told in the novel.  I hate to give a trite ""the book was better"" review of the film, which is a good action movie in its own right, but the characters in the book are fleshed out so much better.  When you watch Battle Royale, you are only caring about a few of the characters.  The rest only serve to steal the spotlight for a moment while they die in various violent death scenes.  It's like watching action movies where dozens of people get killed and you aren't attached to any of them.  Or slasher films, where you go in knowing most of the foolish teenage cast is going to be taken out one at a time for your viewing pleasure.  The characters serve the violence, whereas in the book, the violence serves to glorify the wonderful cast of characters.  Every character that only gets a few moments in the film, gets whole pages devoted to them in the novel.Unlike the book, the character of the teacher Kitano is a likeable character with some depth.  I'm not sure if this enhances the story any, because the character he was based on from the novel, Kinpatsu Sakamochi, worked great as a despicable bad guy for the reader to hate.  By making Kitano a sympathetic character, the film's final act works very differently than the book.  Still, I enjoyed the final scenes of the film.  I don't mind when movies branch away from their source material.  It gives the viewer a new, different experience.  Sadly, the trade-off here is that, while Kitano's character is enhanced by the screen version of the character, the rest of the cast completely lose what made them special in the original story.If you are interested in cool action movies with stylized violence, or if you just want to see dozens of teenagers kill each other on screen, this is a fun movie, and a cult classic.  However, if you want a better experience, I would recommend that you read the original novel.  Every single character is a wonderful creation whose death is meaningful (sometimes tragic, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes even darkly funny, but always felt by the reader).  The movie loses what truly made the story special.  The sense of suspense and distrust is almost completely gone here.  Beautiful, tragic stories are not told.  They cut out one of my favorite characters completely.  The protagonists are much better characters in the novel.  And the antagonists, especially the wicked Mitsuko and Kiriyama, actually have their warped personalities explained.It might be unfair to judge the film in comparison to the novel, because it is a good action movie in its own right.  It's just a pale shadow of the story and the amazing characters it's based on.",3,"Fun, but does not compare to the awesome novel.",1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,2783,"['Battle', 'Royale', 'stylish', 'bloody', 'action', 'flick', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'basically', 'heart', 'story', 'told', 'novel', 'hate', 'give', 'trite', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'review', 'film', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'characters', 'book', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'When', 'watch', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'are', 'only', 'caring', 'few', 'characters', 'rest', 'only', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'moment', 'die', 'various', 'violent', 'death', 'scenes', 'watching', 'action', 'movies', 'where', 'dozens', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'are', ""n't"", 'attached', 'slasher', 'films', 'where', 'go', 'knowing', 'most', 'foolish', 'teenage', 'cast', 'going', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'characters', 'serve', 'violence', 'whereas', 'book', 'violence', 'glorify', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'characters', 'character', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'whole', 'pages', 'devoted', 'novel.Unlike', 'book', 'character', 'teacher', 'Kitano', 'likeable', 'character', 'depth', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'story', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Kinpatsu', 'Sakamochi', 'worked', 'great', 'despicable', 'bad', 'guy', 'reader', 'hate', 'making', 'Kitano', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'very', 'differently', 'book', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'when', 'movies', 'branch', 'away', 'source', 'material', 'viewer', 'new', 'different', 'experience', 'Sadly', 'trade-off', 'here', 'Kitano', 'character', 'enhanced', 'screen', 'version', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'completely', 'lose', 'what', 'made', 'special', 'original', 'story.If', 'are', 'interested', 'cool', 'action', 'movies', 'stylized', 'violence', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'dozens', 'teenagers', 'kill', 'other', 'screen', 'fun', 'movie', 'cult', 'classic', 'However', 'want', 'better', 'experience', 'would', 'recommend', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'single', 'character', 'wonderful', 'creation', 'death', 'meaningful', 'sometimes', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'suspenseful', 'sometimes', 'even', 'darkly', 'funny', 'always', 'felt', 'reader', 'movie', 'what', 'truly', 'made', 'story', 'special', 'sense', 'suspense', 'distrust', 'almost', 'completely', 'gone', 'here', 'Beautiful', 'tragic', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'completely', 'protagonists', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'characters', 'novel', 'antagonists', 'especially', 'wicked', 'Mitsuko', 'Kiriyama', 'actually', 'have', 'warped', 'personalities', 'explained.It', 'might', 'be', 'unfair', 'judge', 'film', 'comparison', 'novel', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'just', 'pale', 'shadow', 'story', 'amazing', 'characters', 'based']",N/A

597355,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00005JL99,Matthew King,"[3, 6]","One thing to be said about Japanese horror/extreme action is that it could seldom, if ever, be accused of being formulaic.  Some of the most ingenious storylines ever thought of have come from Japanese films(see Ringu, Suicide Club, Kairo, Uzumaki).  But while the ideas are in place the problem is often with the execution of the film.  Overacting, cheap special effects and slow pacing between action scenes have often plagued the Japanese films I have bore witness to.  Not so with Battle Royale.  The concept is pure genius and believe me, the execution even better.Kitano is a strict teacher whose source of pride comes from being able to instill discipline in the young.  He is for the most part very successful at this and highly respected among his students.  Then one afternoon, an out-of-control student who he reprimands stabs him in the back of the leg.  Following this incident Kitano quits his teaching job and disappears out of sight.  Fast forward to a few years later.  A group of 42 students(who appear to be in their mid-teens) board a bus to go on a class trip.  At some point during the bus ride a sleeping gas is unleashed and all the students fall asleep.  When they wake up, they find themselves cramped in a classroom and with a tight metallic necklace tied around their necks.  To their great surprise, in through the door walks Kitano, who most have had as a 7th grade teacher.  Kitano informs them of a game he has devised called Battle Royale that they have been randomly selected to be a part of.  Battle Royale is Kitano's sadistic vengeful way of getting back to the youths he feels lack discipline and `mock' adults.The rules behind Battle Royale are this; The students are now on a remote island where all 42 of them will be pitted against each other in a game to the death.  Each student is given a backpack that includes water, food, a weapon, a compass and a map of the island.  The last person standing gets to go home free.  There is a catch however.  They only have 3 days.  If more than one person is left standing after 3 days, their collars will all blow.  The island is also mapped with regions that contain shifting `danger zones', of which Kitano informs them of over a loud speaker.  If someone is still standing in a danger zone after Kitano makes the announcement their collar will explode.From the moment the rules of Battle Royale are transmitted to the kids, the film's frenetic pace never lets up.  Director Kinji Fukasaku pulls absolutely no punches here, making this a no-holds-barred extreme version of Lord of the Flies that is compulsively watchable.  The acting performances he is able to draw out of these kids is remarkable.  Part of what Fukasaku seems to be trying to achieve with this film is to give us a character study of how different some kids can be from others and how differently they can react when faced with peril.  One group commits suicide instantly, refusing to be a part of the sadistic game they're forced to play.  Another group spends their time shacked up in a cabin, trying to figure out a way to hack through Kitano's system so they can get the collars off their necks.  One group of women simply decide to live as normally as they usually would by cooking, exchanging stories, staying civilized.  And of course, some kids choose to become killing machines, determined to be the one to get out of the game alive.Director Fukasaku's choice of filming locations is absolutely stunning, from the lush tropical jungles, to the edge of the sea, the lighthouse, etc.  The film's image looks surprisingly sharp and clear for a non-hollywood production.  The only thing I would have to complain about are the English subtitles.  They are filled with grammatical errors and poor sentence structuring.  I also got the impression that many parts of the dialogue were missing or were not presented accurately.  Hopefully, Battle Royale will see a North American DVD reissue that will be dubbed or at least have better subtitles.  I'm not hoping for a North American remake however.  It would probably be a PG-13 `message' film starring the likes of Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins. Ugh!!Battle Royale is an action classic not to be missed.  It's adrenaline-fuelled pace will appeal to action fans, it's bloody carnage and gore will appeal to horror fans.  This is a film that puts just about any North American action film to shame. A modern cult classic that deserves a wider distribution.",5,Absolutely stunning!

597358,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JL99,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","Long before ""The Hunger Games"" but after ""Lord of the Flies"" there was ""Battle Royale,"" a Japanese survivalist horror show in which middle school teenagers are forced to murder each other. That's the first hint that ""Battle Royale"" is different from ""The Hunger Games"" - ""Battle Royale"" begins like a nightmare, with children waking up from a field trip terrorized by their sadistic teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano). The little exposition provided at the beginning of the film explains that the Battle Royale (BR) Act was instituted after 800,000 students walked out of school.The precise details of the BR Act (along with the society that generates it) is a little fuzzy, but the end result is that middle school classes are randomly chosen to wear explosive collars and murder each other until only one remains.  ""Battle Royale"" definitely has some cultural peculiarities that don't translate well to an American audience.  I would think 800,000 students would have to do more than ""walk out of school"" to merit a battle to death.But enough details! ""Battle Royale"" is most interested in the battle royale and the action starts almost immediately as the students shift from confused whiners to vicious killers.  The class of 40 students rapidly narrows as they commit suicide and murder, all against the backdrop of Japanese middle school drama.  Imagine American high school cliques armed with machineguns and you get the idea.In addition to the 40 students, there are two ringers: one is a murderous psychopath who volunteered for the game; the other is a survivor from a previous game with a dark past. From the zones that threaten to detonate the bomb collars just by straying into the wrong territory (this never actually comes into play in the movie for some reason) to the fact that each student's survival pack is randomly assigned - some without weapons - there is little hope for any of them.  And so each pocket of children plays out a different morality play where, bereft of adult authority and a moral compass, they regress to the laws of Japanese middle school.  There's the star-crossed lovers, the pleasantly facile cheerleading squad, the hacker brotherhood, the bloodthirsty nerd outcast, the bullying jocks, and the sociopathic loner. Not all of these survival strategies are as successful in the social circles of school as they are on the battleground, and director Kinji Fukasaku has fun playing the grim drama out for our amusement as the kill counter clicks down with each death.The acting isn't very good, but something may be lost in the translation between Japanese middle school and American English. The students, unlike the starving paupers of ""The Hunger Games,"" seem oddly pampered and bewildered by the fact ""Battle Royale"" even exists.

White ""impossiblefunky""","[14, 15]","The 61st film of 70-year old director Kinji Fukasaku, BATTLE ROYALE begins with a prologue:""At the dawn of the millennium the nation collapsed.  At 15% unemployment, 10 million were out of work.  800,000 students boycotted school.  The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act AKA the BR Act.""While the logic of instating the BR Act due to the downturn of the Japanese economy is tenuous at best, BATTLE ROYALE screams into action and doesn't allow time to ponder such issues.  After a few scenes setting up core characters--Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko (Aki Maeda)--the forty-two high schoolers become trapped on a remote island where they're reintroduced to their seventh grade teacher, Kitano (brilliantly played by ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano).""This country's become no good,"" Kitano says.  ""The bigwigs got together and passed [the BR Act].  So today's lesson is... you kill each other off.  `Till there's only one left.  There's nothing against the rules.""Armed with a random ""weapon"" (some get semi-automatic guns, some get less lethal implements like cookwear), each student has three days to dispatch his or her classmates in hope of being the last one standing.  Again, there is little time for logic and no room for pacifism. Playing like a high-stakes version of Martin Campbell's island prison adventure NO ESCAPE, BATTLE ROYALE finds fuel in the heightened melodrama of adolescence.  As these kids struggle to stay alive, classroom rivalries skyrocket and doe-eyed crushes become heavyweight love affairs.Shuya, whose father abandoned him by taking his own life, becomes the stand-in for the audience as well as the prototypical Japanese.  Struggling in this microcosm of Japan, Shuya is a young man without a father as Japan is a country without a strong leader.  Meanwhile, the only male role model for Shuya appears to be Kitano, the slump-shouldered former teacher plagued with family problems of his own.BATTLE ROYALE has its moments of ""score-keeping"" via graphics that appear, tallying the names of those who have died as well as how many students are left.  As the body count goes higher, director Fukasaku keeps raising the stakes, never relenting in this dogged contest.  Cleverly, BATTLE ROYALE doesn't appear as an outright parody.  Rather, it takes melodrama to the nth degree.  The film's score booms with emotionally riveting classical pieces, giving the proceedings an operatic tinge.",5,today's lesson is... you kill each other off,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,2477,"['61st', 'film', '70-year', 'old', 'director', 'Kinji', 'Fukasaku', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'prologue', 'dawn', 'millennium', 'nation', 'collapsed', '15', '%', 'unemployment', '10', 'million', 'were', 'work', '800,000', 'students', 'boycotted', 'school', 'adults', 'lost', 'confidence', 'fearing', 'youth', 'eventually', 'passed', 'Millennium', 'Educational', 'Reform', 'Act', 'AKA', 'BR', 'Act', 'logic', 'instating', 'BR', 'Act', 'due', 'downturn', 'Japanese', 'economy', 'tenuous', 'best', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'screams', 'action', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'ponder', 'such', 'issues', 'few', 'scenes', 'setting', 'up', 'core', 'characters', 'Shuya', 'Tatsuya', 'Fujiwara', 'Noriko', 'Aki', 'Maeda', 'forty-two', 'high', 'schoolers', 'become', 'trapped', 'remote', 'island', 'where', ""'re"", 'reintroduced', 'seventh', 'grade', 'teacher', 'Kitano', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'country', 'become', 'good', 'Kitano', 'bigwigs', 'got', 'together', 'passed', '[', 'BR', 'Act', ']', 'So', 'today', 'lesson', 'kill', 'other', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'nothing', 'rules', 'Armed', 'random', 'weapon', 'get', 'semi-automatic', 'guns', 'get', 'less', 'lethal', 'implements', 'cookwear', 'student', 'three', 'days', 'dispatch', 'classmates', 'hope', 'being', 'last', 'one', 'standing', 'Again', 'little', 'time', 'logic', 'room', 'pacifism', 'Playing', 'high-stakes', 'version', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'island', 'prison', 'adventure', 'NO', 'ESCAPE', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'fuel', 'heightened', 'melodrama', 'adolescence', 'kids', 'struggle', 'stay', 'alive', 'classroom', 'rivalries', 'skyrocket', 'doe-eyed', 'crushes', 'become', 'heavyweight', 'love', 'affairs.Shuya', 'father', 'abandoned', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'stand-in', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'prototypical', 'Japanese', 'Struggling', 'microcosm', 'Japan', 'Shuya', 'young', 'man', 'father', 'Japan', 'country', 'strong', 'leader', 'Meanwhile', 'only', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'Shuya', 'be', 'Kitano', 'slump-shouldered', 'former', 'teacher', 'plagued', 'family', 'problems', 'own.BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'moments', 'score-keeping', 'graphics', 'appear', 'tallying', 'names', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'many', 'students', 'are', 'left', 'body', 'count', 'higher', 'director', 'Fukasaku', 'raising', 'stakes', 'never', 'relenting', 'dogged', 'contest', 'Cleverly', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', ""n't"", 'appear', 'outright', 'parody', 'Rather', 'melodrama', 'nth', 'degree', 'film', 'score', 'booms', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'classical', 'pieces', 'giving', 'proceedings', 'operatic', 'tinge']",N/A
597361,A39LHFS2ONNKGM,B00005JL99,Miguel Douglas,"[5, 7]","Battle Royale.... Wow, what a movie viewing experience. First off I have to commend the director, Kinji Fukasaku (who directed over 50+ films in Japan) for actually having the nerve to direct such a movie. I personally could not classify what genre this film is, but it is definitely in the realm of ""horror"" and here is why...The Synopsis:  The turn of the century.  Japan is on the brink of collapse.  Fearing rising indiscipline and rebellion amongst the youth of the nation, authorities pass the Millennium Educational Reform Act, allowing the implementation of the `Battle Royale' programme: classes of 14 and 15 year-olds are chosen at random and sent to a remote island where they are given weapons and three days to kill one another, until the sole survivor emerges as the winner.As I viewed this film (and I have seen a LOT of Japanese films) I felt very sad for what these kids, or should I say ""children"" had to experience, but here I was, experiencing this tragic roller-coaster ride right there with them. From the opening SECONDS of Battle Royale, I was caught up in the mayhem and it did not let go until the credits started rolling.You have to understand that the majority of these kids don't want to kill their classmates, some unfortunately do, but for the most part, most don't want too. They are chosen to carry the burden of what society deems as the ""rebellious youth"". They are the ones that are to be made the example of what happens when you disregard ""authority"". What makes this all the more tragic is that this particular group of students are not the ones that should be battling; they are not the indiscipline youth, they are not the rebellious youth, they are not disregarding authority. What they are though, are just regular children who have dreams and aspirations, and who just wanted to lead a normal school life...until they are thrust in to the ""Millennium Educational Reform Act aka BATLLE ROYALE PROGRAM"".As for technical side of the movie; I would have to say the Kinji Fukasaku directed what I considered one of his best movies. The movie is tightly paced and never let's up; Kinji let's you breathe for perhaps a moment but then he hits you unexpectedly. Great direction.As you probably have heard before, this movie is extremely violent, but it is certainly not senseless. It is not the violence that is shocking in B.R., it is the realization of who is performing the violent acts that are truly haunting. The children are forced to kill or be killed, nothing more, nothing less.As for the music, it contains well-known classical pieces as well as having it's own classical pieces that plays throughout the movie. It presents the movie with a sense of a being a sort of tragic stage play.The acting was very believable for the most part, each character displaying emotions such as fear, shyness, deception, love, jealousy, humiliation and helplessness with convincing potrayals. What is great about each character is that it hurts you when every one of them dies, because they are that REAL. I particularly enjoyed Takeshi Kitano's performance of the school teacher, I truly believe he wasn't acting at all, it was just him playing himself.So is Battle Royale a masterpiece? I would have to say ""YES"" simply for the fact that after viewing the film, you will never forget it. It is a beautifully haunting piece of cinema that will thoroughly exhaust you by the end of the movie but also invite you into the deeper interpretation that the film provides. Definitely check BATTLE ROYALE out.",5,Today I killed my best friend....,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,3533,"['Battle', 'Royale', 'Wow', 'what', 'movie', 'viewing', 'experience', 'First', 'have', 'commend', 'director', 'Kinji', 'Fukasaku', 'who', 'directed', '50+', 'films', 'Japan', 'actually', 'having', 'nerve', 'direct', 'movie', 'personally', 'could', 'not', 'classify', 'what', 'genre', 'film', 'definitely', 'realm', 'horror', 'here', 'why', 'Synopsis', 'turn', 'century', 'Japan', 'brink', 'collapse', 'Fearing', 'rising', 'indiscipline', 'rebellion', 'youth', 'nation', 'authorities', 'pass', 'Millennium', 'Educational', 'Reform', 'Act', 'allowing', 'implementation', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'programme', 'classes', '14', '15', 'year-olds', 'are', 'chosen', 'random', 'sent', 'remote', 'island', 'where', 'are', 'given', 'weapons', 'three', 'days', 'kill', 'one', 'sole', 'survivor', 'winner.As', 'viewed', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'LOT', 'Japanese', 'films', 'felt', 'very', 'sad', 'what', 'kids', 'should', 'say', 'children', 'had', 'experience', 'here', 'was', 'experiencing', 'tragic', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'right', 'there', 'opening', 'SECONDS', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'mayhem', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling.You', 'have', 'understand', 'majority', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'classmates', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'most', 'part', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'too', 'are', 'chosen', 'carry', 'burden', 'what', 'society', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'be', 'made', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'disregard', 'authority', 'What', 'more', 'tragic', 'particular', 'group', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'ones', 'should', 'be', 'battling', 'are', 'not', 'indiscipline', 'youth', 'are', 'not', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'are', 'not', 'disregarding', 'authority', 'What', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'regular', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'lead', 'normal', 'school', 'life', 'are', 'thrust', 'Millennium', 'Educational', 'Reform', 'Act', 'BATLLE', 'ROYALE', 'PROGRAM', '.As', 'technical', 'side', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Kinji', 'Fukasaku', 'directed', 'what', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'movie', 'tightly', 'paced', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'Kinji', 'let', 'breathe', 'perhaps', 'moment', 'then', 'unexpectedly', 'Great', 'direction.As', 'probably', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'extremely', 'violent', 'certainly', 'not', 'senseless', 'not', 'violence', 'shocking', 'B.R.', 'realization', 'who', 'performing', 'violent', 'acts', 'are', 'truly', 'haunting', 'children', 'are', 'forced', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.As', 'music', 'well-known', 'classical', 'pieces', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'own', 'classical', 'pieces', 'movie', 'movie', 'sense', 'being', 'sort', 'tragic', 'stage', 'play.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'most', 'part', 'character', 'displaying', 'emotions', 'such', 'fear', 'shyness', 'deception', 'love', 'jealousy', 'humiliation', 'helplessness', 'convincing', 'potrayals', 'What', 'great', 'character', 'when', 'one', 'dies', 'are', 'REAL', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'performance', 'school', 'teacher', 'truly', 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'himself.So', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'YES', 'simply', 'fact', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'piece', 'cinema', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'exhaust', 'end', 'movie', 'also', 'invite', 'deeper', 'interpretation', 'film', 'Definitely', 'check', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'out']",N/A
597362,A21P8800ZGRGIP,B00005JL99,Miketheratguy,"[3, 3]","To begin with, yes, I rented this video because I'd heard that it was a very controversial film- a bloody tale in which a class of high school kids are forced to play cat and mouse and kill each other until only one remains.And yes, I received that. But I was completely shocked that I also got a very serious, character-driven, emotional drama. If you're into this movie because of the violence, don't worry, you'll be happy. But for those quick to turn away because they think this will be another crazy, senseless, far-out Japanese trash film? I have to tell you- you're very wrong. I went into this film wanting to see just how flashy and violent it would be, and walked away from it with a much higher opinion. This movie didn't insult my intelligence with two hours of nonsense. Instead, it captivated me with emotional tales of life, loss, love, and friendship. These kids aren't just disposable fodder. The movie makes sure we understand that they all had lives and dreams.The film's premise is explained quickly but paced expertly: In a future Asia, things are horrible and some adults have rebelled against the youth that spites them. One man in particular, a high school teacher, goes with his unruly class on a field trip. They're shocked to find themselves being hustled into a room under supervision of armed militants and told that their lives are at an end. Each of the 40 kids are given a bag of rations and a random weapon, and shoved out onto an isolated island where they must kill each other, or be killed themselves.As strange as this may sound, I was surprised at how well these scenes played out. These kids are fine actors. Extreme disbelief, shock, rage, confusion, terror- it's all on their faces as they slowly take this message in. Some rebel and are quickly disposed of. Others fly into rage at what they see. Most others however shrink into the corners of the small room and try their best to accept the impossible fate before them. Soon though, the music goes low and the faces get stark as the kids are rushed, one by one, out into the wilderness. They look at their friends and hastily embrace for what they know will probably be the last time.As I said, there is of course a lot of violence in the film. It's comparable to the first Kill Bill, or perhaps the original Robocop. But the controversy following this film is due simply to its theme of high schoolers killing high schoolers, and also due to the film's dark tone. I reiterate: This isn't a rocking, stylistic gun glamorization. Some of these kids fall backwards in fear, not wanting to fire upon their friends. Others recoil in shock when they do what's required. Others simply attempt suicide to free themselves of the burden. The subject of this movie is not taken lightly. The mood is dark, the situation desperate.Driving things home are vignettes of the kids. Often, we're given glimpses of these people's lives. We see exuberance of youth- a shy boy trying to find a way to let a girl know he likes her. A girl who's happy to bring cookies to her friends for the field trip. Another boy who just lost his father and is trying to cope. The basketball game where these kids last shared their lives together. This film is about loss, primarily evidenced by the loss of innocence and youth that these kids experience when they know they have to kill their best friends. Heightening the film is a gorgeous, poetic soundtrack of classical music that is expertly juxtaposed against the agony and misery that these people have to go through.The film makes sense, has a well-paced, intelligent narrative, and interesting circumstances. Some kids can't handle what's happening, others glory in it. Some are experts, some are terrified. Something important is constantly going on, and by the end, it's a sad, moving piece of human drama regardless of who wins- if anyone. Well acted, well scored, with raw and realistic dialog, and fantastic direction.Yes, if you strip away all narrative, this is a movie about kids killing each other. But to my pleasant shock, it was also one of the most moving, emotional dramas about life and loss that I've ever seen. And not just life, but what it means to live.",5,More serious and emotionally mature than I ever imagined,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,4192,"['begin', 'yes', 'rented', 'video', ""'d"", 'heard', 'was', 'very', 'controversial', 'film-', 'bloody', 'tale', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'are', 'forced', 'play', 'cat', 'mouse', 'kill', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'remains.And', 'yes', 'received', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'also', 'got', 'very', 'serious', 'character-driven', 'emotional', 'drama', ""'re"", 'movie', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'quick', 'turn', 'away', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'crazy', 'senseless', 'far-out', 'Japanese', 'trash', 'film', 'have', 'tell', 'you-', ""'re"", 'very', 'wrong', 'went', 'film', 'wanting', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'flashy', 'violent', 'would', 'be', 'walked', 'away', 'much', 'higher', 'opinion', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'two', 'hours', 'nonsense', 'Instead', 'captivated', 'emotional', 'tales', 'life', 'loss', 'love', 'friendship', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'disposable', 'fodder', 'movie', 'sure', 'understand', 'had', 'lives', 'dreams.The', 'film', 'premise', 'explained', 'quickly', 'paced', 'expertly', 'future', 'Asia', 'things', 'are', 'horrible', 'adults', 'have', 'rebelled', 'youth', 'One', 'man', 'particular', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'unruly', 'class', 'field', 'trip', ""'re"", 'shocked', 'find', 'being', 'hustled', 'room', 'supervision', 'armed', 'militants', 'told', 'lives', 'are', 'end', '40', 'kids', 'are', 'given', 'bag', 'rations', 'random', 'weapon', 'shoved', 'out', 'isolated', 'island', 'where', 'must', 'kill', 'other', 'be', 'killed', 'themselves.As', 'strange', 'may', 'sound', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'kids', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'Extreme', 'disbelief', 'shock', 'rage', 'confusion', 'terror-', 'slowly', 'take', 'message', 'rebel', 'are', 'quickly', 'disposed', 'Others', 'fly', 'rage', 'what', 'see', 'Most', 'others', 'however', 'shrink', 'corners', 'small', 'room', 'try', 'best', 'accept', 'impossible', 'fate', 'Soon', 'music', 'low', 'get', 'stark', 'kids', 'are', 'rushed', 'one', 'one', 'wilderness', 'look', 'friends', 'hastily', 'embrace', 'what', 'know', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'last', 'time.As', 'said', 'course', 'lot', 'violence', 'film', 'comparable', 'first', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'perhaps', 'original', 'Robocop', 'controversy', 'following', 'film', 'due', 'simply', 'theme', 'high', 'schoolers', 'killing', 'high', 'schoolers', 'also', 'due', 'film', 'dark', 'tone', 'reiterate', ""n't"", 'rocking', 'stylistic', 'gun', 'glamorization', 'kids', 'fall', 'backwards', 'fear', 'not', 'wanting', 'fire', 'friends', 'Others', 'recoil', 'shock', 'when', 'do', 'what', 'required', 'Others', 'simply', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'free', 'burden', 'subject', 'movie', 'not', 'taken', 'lightly', 'mood', 'dark', 'situation', 'desperate.Driving', 'things', 'home', 'are', 'vignettes', 'kids', 'Often', ""'re"", 'given', 'glimpses', 'people', 'lives', 'see', 'exuberance', 'youth-', 'shy', 'boy', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'let', 'girl', 'know', 'girl', 'who', 'happy', 'bring', 'cookies', 'friends', 'field', 'trip', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'trying', 'cope', 'basketball', 'game', 'where', 'kids', 'last', 'shared', 'lives', 'together', 'film', 'loss', 'primarily', 'evidenced', 'loss', 'innocence', 'youth', 'kids', 'experience', 'when', 'know', 'have', 'kill', 'best', 'friends', 'Heightening', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'poetic', 'soundtrack', 'classical', 'music', 'expertly', 'juxtaposed', 'agony', 'misery', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'through.The', 'film', 'sense', 'well-paced', 'intelligent', 'narrative', 'interesting', 'circumstances', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'what', 'happening', 'others', 'glory', 'are', 'experts', 'are', 'terrified', 'Something', 'important', 'constantly', 'going', 'end', 'sad', 'moving', 'piece', 'human', 'drama', 'regardless', 'who', 'wins-', 'anyone', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'scored', 'raw', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'fantastic', 'direction.Yes', 'strip', 'away', 'narrative', 'movie', 'kids', 'killing', 'other', 'pleasant', 'shock', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'life', 'loss', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'just', 'life', 'what', 'live']",N/A
597363,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JL99,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""Battle Royale"" was much talked-about in the United States back in 2001, but it took a while to get here, allegedly because distributors were reluctant to promote 2 hours of teenagers on a killing spree. The film is based on the popular Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, whose considerable length condenses surprisingly well to a fast-paced feature film. In a dystopian future, Japan is at risk of societal collapse from high unemployment, economic stagnation, and general discontent. Youth bully their teachers and boycott school. The ""BR Act"" is passed, authorizing the government to select classes of 9th graders to be confined to a deserted island and forced to fight each other to the death until only one student remains.Shuya (Tatsuya Rujiwara) is a thoughtful young man who lost both of his parents to Japan's bad times. On a class trip, he and his classmates are drugged, transported to the island where they will be forced to take part in the Battle Royale, and fitted with electronic collars that monitor their movements. Their bombastic teacher Kitano (Beat Takeshi) explains the rules of the game and distributes a survival kit and one weapon to each of the 42 students, including 2 mysterious ""exchange students"". If more than one person survives 3 days, they all die. We follow Shuya and his friend Noriko (Aki Maeda) as they come to grips with their situation and try to survive with the aid of Kawada (Taro Yamamoto), an older student whose purpose is not at first clear.The film strays from the book in some details but is substantively similar. We don't get to know the secondary characters as well, so questions of trust are not as complex as in the book. The instructor Kitano is fleshed out more in the film and comes across as a lonely and strangely pathetic man. It's interesting to observe how the various personalities react to the game, from the young lovers who commit suicide to the sickle-wielding vamp Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki) who is determined to win. The politics behind the ""BR Act"" is simplified and more coherent in the film. Adults fear youth, because their refusal to accept the values of their elders will exacerbate social collapse. The ""BR Act"" forces young people to compete ruthlessly or perish. Kitano's sick sense of humor provides comic relief.

597365,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00005JL99,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","In an alternate world of modern day Japan, the younger generation has no respect for adults or for law and order.  Those in charge of the government decide, for purposes of elimination and example, to select a 9th grade class each year to kill each other.  Only one survivor or they all die thanks to an exploding device attached to their neck.The leader in charge, assisted by scores of military accomplices, is in fact a teacher (Takeshi Kitano) at the school whose class is picked.  His brutality is evident in the orientation before the 42 kiddies are released into a remote island interior.  When one girl smarts off to him he tosses a knife into her forehead.  When one kid, who had for whatever reason, stabbed Kitano in the butt earlier at school, talks back, his necklace is activated.  Now only 40 to go!  Kitano does have some teacher pets however, which comes into play later.The concept for this film is a pretty good one.  Life or death.  No exceptions.  No mercy.  Each participant is given personal supplies and a bag of survival gear.  Some have automatic weapons, others have seemingly innocuous items.  One kid has a large lid to a cooking pot.  It comes in handy.  The action moves along quickly as each kid meets his or her doom, usually with extreme violence.  Some is pretty juicy but nothing as extreme as you might see on ""True Blood"" or ""Spartacus.""Having seen many Japanese films, going back to those made in the 1940's, I find cultural differences hinder their acceptance to most Western audiences.  Much of this difference carries over into their filmmaking.  In almost every situation where one kid takes out another, hysteria follows.  One kid and one of the ""heroes"" named Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), weeps uncontrollably after every death.  His girlfriend, Aki (Noriko Nakagawa) has more character and is one of the few sympathetic kids in the hunt.  My favorite character is Mitsuko (and the film's only good performances by Kou Shibasaki), who we see in a flashback (originally cut) being coaxed into sex as a child.  Her mission is clear.  Kill or be killed.The film is full of over-the-top-acting by nearly everyone except Shibasaki and Kitano.  It gets old.  Contrary to what many believe, this isn't the first film to feature people hunting people (""The Most Dangerous Game"" from 1932) or even kids killing kids (""Lord of the Flies"" from 1963) and it wasn't the last (""The Hunger Games"" from 2012).  It is a good, if flawed film.I watched the film on a Director's Cut Blu ray disc which looks very good.  The film is in 1080p and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The video doesn't sparkle, primarily because the film has a toned down look.  All the combatant kids wear muted tan uniforms with white shirts under their jackets.  The blood splatters look pretty realistic both when it's fresh and when it dries.  The picture is clear and without aritfacts.  I watched the Japanese language version with English subtitles.  It is a really terrific Dolby TrueHD 7.1 mix.  Every speaker include the LFE channels will come to life, especially with the heavy automatic weapon gunfire scenes.  For those who prefer an English dub it is available as Dolby TrueHD as well but with a 5.1 mix.",3,(BLUE RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for bloodsport for 9th graders,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3212,"['alternate', 'world', 'modern', 'day', 'Japan', 'younger', 'generation', 'respect', 'adults', 'law', 'order', 'charge', 'government', 'decide', 'purposes', 'elimination', 'example', 'select', '9th', 'grade', 'class', 'year', 'kill', 'other', 'Only', 'one', 'survivor', 'die', 'thanks', 'exploding', 'device', 'attached', 'neck.The', 'leader', 'charge', 'assisted', 'scores', 'military', 'accomplices', 'fact', 'teacher', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'school', 'class', 'picked', 'brutality', 'evident', 'orientation', '42', 'kiddies', 'are', 'released', 'remote', 'island', 'interior', 'When', 'one', 'girl', 'knife', 'forehead', 'When', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'had', 'reason', 'stabbed', 'Kitano', 'butt', 'earlier', 'school', 'talks', 'back', 'necklace', 'activated', 'Now', 'only', '40', 'go', 'Kitano', 'have', 'teacher', 'pets', 'however', 'play', 'later.The', 'concept', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'Life', 'death', 'exceptions', 'mercy', 'participant', 'given', 'personal', 'supplies', 'bag', 'survival', 'gear', 'have', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'others', 'have', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'items', 'One', 'kid', 'large', 'lid', 'cooking', 'pot', 'handy', 'action', 'along', 'quickly', 'kid', 'doom', 'usually', 'extreme', 'violence', 'pretty', 'juicy', 'nothing', 'as', 'extreme', 'might', 'see', 'True', 'Blood', 'Spartacus', 'Having', 'seen', 'many', 'Japanese', 'films', 'going', 'back', 'made', '1940', 'find', 'cultural', 'differences', 'hinder', 'acceptance', 'most', 'Western', 'audiences', 'Much', 'difference', 'filmmaking', 'almost', 'situation', 'where', 'one', 'kid', 'out', 'hysteria', 'One', 'kid', 'one', 'heroes', 'named', 'Nanahara', 'Tatsuya', 'Fujiwara', 'uncontrollably', 'death', 'girlfriend', 'Aki', 'Noriko', 'Nakagawa', 'more', 'character', 'one', 'few', 'sympathetic', 'kids', 'hunt', 'favorite', 'character', 'Mitsuko', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'performances', 'Kou', 'Shibasaki', 'who', 'see', 'flashback', 'originally', 'cut', 'being', 'coaxed', 'sex', 'child', 'mission', 'clear', 'Kill', 'be', 'killed.The', 'film', 'full', 'over-the-top-acting', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Shibasaki', 'Kitano', 'old', 'Contrary', 'what', 'many', 'believe', ""n't"", 'first', 'film', 'feature', 'people', 'hunting', 'people', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', '1932', 'even', 'kids', 'killing', 'kids', 'Lord', 'Flies', '1963', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'Hunger', 'Games', '2012', 'good', 'flawed', 'film.I', 'watched', 'film', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'very', 'good', 'film', '1080p', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'video', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'primarily', 'film', 'toned', 'down', 'look', 'combatant', 'kids', 'wear', 'muted', 'tan', 'uniforms', 'white', 'shirts', 'jackets', 'blood', 'splatters', 'look', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'when', 'fresh', 'when', 'picture', 'clear', 'aritfacts', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'language', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles', 'really', 'terrific', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '7.1', 'mix', 'speaker', 'include', 'LFE', 'channels', 'will', 'come', 'life', 'especially', 'heavy', 'automatic', 'weapon', 'gunfire', 'scenes', 'who', 'prefer', 'English', 'dub', 'available', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'as', 'well', '5.1', 'mix']",N/A

It has been available in most countries but not the U.S. for quite awhile.I was very excited to watch this but I was severely disappointed.It started out ok.  They presented the game and how 42(?) Japanese students would be brought to an island and would have to kill each other until only one survived, in a mildly humorous fashion.But that was mediocre at best and was the end of anything interesting right at the start.The rest of the movie is spent watching the students kill each other in uninteresting fashion.  So the reputation of outrageous violence turned out to be false in my opinion.The major problem however is that there are too many possible relationships between 42(?) students to have time to examine them in the movie.Obviously, the film doesn't examine them all, but it does do too many.  This movie continually presents a background relationship and resolves it with killing, all within a few minutes.  Then the same thing again and again. You never get to be involved with any of the characters' relationships before one kills another and you are presented with another one.It's all pretty boring.

You are given three days to fight until one is left alive or everyone blows up from the electronic collars around their necks. You also have to make sure you don't go into certian areas or your collar will blow up too.

Fieldtrips, though. Definitely.Place: a remote island. More specifically: some dark room on that very island. Filled with a bunch of damn kids. And soldiers, and Kitano. Yup, our favorite Japanese actor/director/poker-face 'Beat' Takashi Kitano. He introduces the students, nay, 'students' (hell, if you don't go to school, you're no student either) to our favorite game: Battle Royale. By now, we have all heard about it, yes, we all know what Battle Royale is, but the kids are, of course, clueless. However, the rules are quickly explained (including a more than delightful instruction video) and well, let the games begin. The kids are supposed to kill eachother, and only one can remain when 72 hours have passed.This is of course a great story for a movie (or manga, or, initially, book), and, glad to say this, Battle Royale delivers. The acting is more than just mediocre (Kitano is great; the 'I'm-dying-hold-me-while-I-say-my-last-words' scenes are laughable though), the action is superior. Some good plot twists add to the good feeling the movie gives you, and with a nice ending it definitely satisfies. Add to that Chiaki Kuriyama, Aki Maeda, and Kou Shibasaki, and you know you gotta watch this.As for the gore, this movie doesn't totally let you down. Although not tremendously graphic and explicit, there's some nice and brutal scenes in there. Scary? Not at all, but that's not the point.

597369,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JL99,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[2, 3]","'Battle Royale' is one of those movies that you watch and have trouble forming an opinion on.  The story has a group of unruly Japanese schoolchildren sent to a deserted island where they are instructed to kill each other (the survivor being the champion and the only one able to escape the island) or be killed in the Battle Royale scheme, an aim by the government to cut down on teenage violence.  Of course, there's a central irony here as well as a certain degree of satire on extremist measures to an extreme problem and on the generation gap.  Unusually though it's such satire that bogs the movie down.  As a simple horror/action story this is gripping, entertaining stuff, but when it's taking itself seriously the movie's limitations become all too apparent.  For example, the sympathy is firmly ladled on the innocent children, giving no outside perspective whatsoever and handing out small inner narratives that are too short to really emote.The violence is at first shocking, and certainly effective at getting its point across, although rather than setting this up as satire the filmmakers should just admit that this is really an excuse to try and make the audience react more strongly to the heavily stylised violence.  Perhaps it isn't fair to highlight this fact to such an extent, although it is true that is the film's only really big disappointment.  Apart from some bad characterisation of the supporting players where it is never really explained why some people kill and others choose not to, this is a very good movie indeed.  The main characters are very good indeed, and it would have been a wise choice to focuse exclusively on these as they are actually drawn out very well.  There's also a good bit of humour here, something that works surprisingly well in juxtaposition to so much blood.  For instance, there is the jovial tone of the TV presenter as she exlains to the schoolchildren about weaponry and slaughter, as well as a group of terminally happy popular girls that are ultimately self-destructive.Basically this is a movie of mixed parts - whilst some characters are highly interesting, others are far too dull, and if the beginning is shocking, the ending is uninspired.  I know people who think this is an immensely original movie, although personally it reminded me too much of the flawed but superior 'Series 7: The Contenders'.

It is taken place in a futuristic Japan, where high rate of unemployment & social imbalance caused a deep distrust of the old towards the young.  Thus, the creation of a BR Act (Battle Royale Act), where a random lottery was held to nominate an unfortunate & unknowing class to fight & kill each other off until there was only one remaining.  Students had no other alternative as they were given a deadline of three days.  If no winner was declared, then, the survivors would be killed off anyway through the mean of an explosive collar that was attached to their necks.  In order to spice up the event, there would be willing participants who were in the game for the sake of killing.  As the movie progressed, we would see students killed one another with weapons allocated.  They were split into their own groups & along the way, we would see suspicion formed, & some would stick with their mates till the very end.  Some knew that they wouldn't live through to the next day and they would reveal their inner feelings towards their opposite sex and some would do the unthinkable by sacrificing their own lives to save the ones that they were in love or infatuated with.  Beat Kitano was the teacher in this movie & he played a very brief role.  Still, he added weight & dark humour to this movie.  All the time, we were reminded of the incredulity of the movie by having classical music that went together with the killing.  Surrealism at its fullest.  In the end, the message of the day would be love and true friendships that saved the day.  Perhaps, I see too much in this movie but I would like to think that the Director tries to convey the dysfunctional Japan that it is gradually becoming or just maybe, he's simply paying homage to the Manga culture of Japan.  The blood in this movie is very much akin to ""Kill Bill"" version, that is in abundance and flourishing like a water fountain.

This life is nothing if not predictable in its utterly cruel way of recurring behavioral patterns. The key-words nowadays are ""cool"" and ""hip"" forms of parenting, in a ridiculous attempt to identify with the up-and-coming generations of alienated youths. Boundaries are blurred. Parents abandon their stoic posture and yield to hedonism, refuting egregiously their years of experience. When purposeful regression takes center stage, all hell will break loose. So, when haughty, hormone-driven adolescents see that they have their affection-deprived parents on their knees, a greater sense of already-gargantuan entitlement takes over. And this extends into the every sphere of life, especially in social gatherings, and even more in the classroom, where hiding under the surface of blatant infantile behavior lies intensely insecure thought processes. Anyway, the fabric of school tries to institute a neo-superego, but since the primordial one has been vanquished, why should this one be allowed to prevail??? It shouldn't, that's why students just don't care, and their parents are too afraid of losing their children completely (a cataclysmic death of self as well, since children are the redefinition of their rebirth) and simply don't choose to emphasize the importance of education. The movie tried to take the side of the kids, giving everyone a brief background that tries to be inspiring... it vilifies some of them as well so we know who to cheer against (there is an ineffectual attempt to humanize the girl with the scythe by showing her brush with a potential child molester). Now, the solution in this case is pure fascism, and it is a very moronic way of looking at life. The reason we have so many school shootings and whatnot in the US is because the culture causes a spiritual suffocation and death, there is no room for negotiation, there are no shades of gray, so extreme behaviors are adopted to get the point across. Here, it's the same thing, adopting radical dogmas for a much deeper-seeded behavioral issue that derives from the adults' lack of insight into self and how to raise their kids... bah... I usually try to stick with the story in my reviews, not focusing on technical aspects. Unfortunately, I must comment, the acting was very poor.. I love to be drawn into the realm of the film, but I simply couldn't because none of it rang true or believable.

597384,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JL99,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 19]","Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)I committed what may be the cardinal sin where watching movies based on books is concerned-- I saw the film less than a year after I read the book. I have always hypothesized that this was the reason for my, shall we say, overly hostile reaction to Malick's desecration of James Jones' brilliant novel The Thin Red Line; at least I can say with some authority that I didn't hate Battle Royale anywhere near as badly as I hated The Thin Red Line.Most of my problem with the film adaptation comes from changes that were made to the events in the book that didn't need making in any way, shape, or form (for example, the timing of Yukiko and Yumiko's deaths, which comes later in the novel, or, most notably, Kawada's assertion that Kiriyama ""signed up"" for the game, which changes the whole atmosphere). There are some things that, we're all aware by now, simply don't translate well to the screen (e.g., the portions of the novel where Takami goes into Kiriyama's mental state), and those were forgiven before the movie started rolling. Still, there were some changes made that those who have already read the novel will find unforgivable, if not unconscionable.The plot of the movie, as thin as it is, has excited a good deal of controversy: in an alternate-world Japan, the government has instituted a yearly Battle Royale, where a high school class picked at random is sent to an out-of-the-way island and forced to kill one another until there is a single survivor. The controversy seems to be over the ages of the subjects, given that as far as the actual action is concerned, this is pretty standard thriller fare (there's nothing in the film even remotely as disturbing as the ""curbing"" scene from American History X, for example). One of the most amusing things about the movie is that those unnecessary changes made to the novel while it was adapted are the only places in the film where truly gaping holes arise in the premise (it's impossible to go into detail without major spoilers, so I'll just say that some of the characters' ages couldn't possibly mesh with this being one high school class [IMDB specifies they're a ninth-grade class]; this is confirmed during a critical piece of dialogue about two-thirds of the way through the film).If you're looking for a solid action flick with a high body count, you don't care about plot holes, and you haven't read the book, you'll probably greatly enjoy Battle Royale; I know many people who have. If you've read the book, however, I urge you to avoid the movie. **",2,"Bad, compared to the novel.",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2561,"['Battle', 'Royale', 'Kinji', 'Fukasaku', '2000', 'committed', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'where', 'watching', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'concerned', 'saw', 'film', 'less', 'year', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'always', 'hypothesized', 'was', 'reason', 'shall', 'say', 'overly', 'hostile', 'reaction', 'Malick', 'desecration', 'James', 'Jones', 'brilliant', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'least', 'can', 'say', 'authority', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'anywhere', 'near', 'as', 'badly', 'hated', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line.Most', 'problem', 'film', 'adaptation', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'events', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'making', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'example', 'timing', 'Yukiko', 'Yumiko', 'deaths', 'later', 'novel', 'most', 'notably', 'Kawada', 'assertion', 'Kiriyama', 'signed', 'up', 'game', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'things', ""'re"", 'aware', 'now', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'e.g.', 'portions', 'novel', 'where', 'Takami', 'Kiriyama', 'mental', 'state', 'were', 'forgiven', 'movie', 'started', 'rolling', 'Still', 'were', 'changes', 'made', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'find', 'unforgivable', 'not', 'unconscionable.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'as', 'thin', 'excited', 'good', 'deal', 'controversy', 'alternate-world', 'Japan', 'government', 'instituted', 'yearly', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'picked', 'random', 'sent', 'out-of-the-way', 'island', 'forced', 'kill', 'one', 'single', 'survivor', 'controversy', 'be', 'ages', 'subjects', 'given', 'as', 'far', 'actual', 'action', 'concerned', 'pretty', 'standard', 'thriller', 'fare', 'nothing', 'film', 'even', 'remotely', 'as', 'disturbing', 'curbing', 'scene', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'example', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'things', 'movie', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'made', 'novel', 'was', 'adapted', 'are', 'only', 'places', 'film', 'where', 'truly', 'gaping', 'holes', 'arise', 'premise', 'impossible', 'go', 'detail', 'major', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'characters', 'ages', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'mesh', 'being', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'class', '[', 'IMDB', ""'re"", 'ninth-grade', 'class', ']', 'confirmed', 'critical', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'film', '.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'action', 'flick', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'holes', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'however', 'urge', 'avoid', 'movie', '**']",N/A

597386,A2QUH3ZWQ4UDHX,B00005JL99,Roberto Pang,"[6, 9]","Read the novel and the manga and loved them both. The movie however was just not good. Of course it is hard to compress several phone book sized volumes into a 120 minute movie, but realize that the bulk of the material in the manga and the novel were not the killings but the back story for each character. It is the experiences (and traumas) of each character that gave us the context of the decision to kill or not kill that each one made. It is not enough to simply show killings without showing us the motivations behind them. Of course they all kill because they don't want to be killed, but without knowing whether they enjoyed doing it is part of the information conveyed in the manga and novel. This is what made us connect with each character.In the novel and manga, it was the ""match ups"" that kept one's attention. Would the martial artist be able to beat a cold blooded killer? Would the beautiful vixen be able to seduce all guys to death? Would the athletic girl be able to fight off a stronger but undisciplined guy, would the semi-trained veteran be able to out maneuver the psycho? All of these were lost in the movie and we end up with kids that don't look, or act any differently from each other. Yes, these are teens and they would not know how to hold a gun, or shoot, or even to survive in the open, but even the main (evil) characters appear to move foolishly.In the novel and in the manga, the wrapping up of the story is nicely done, like a twist in a mystery novel; in the movie it is boiled down to a ""hurry up and let's finish this before we run out of tape"" kind of deal.All in all, I think I will just pretend that the movie never happened.",1,Pretend the movie never happened.,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1671,"['Read', 'novel', 'manga', 'loved', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'course', 'hard', 'compress', 'several', 'phone', 'book', 'sized', 'volumes', '120', 'minute', 'movie', 'realize', 'bulk', 'material', 'manga', 'novel', 'were', 'not', 'killings', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'experiences', 'traumas', 'character', 'gave', 'context', 'decision', 'kill', 'not', 'kill', 'one', 'made', 'not', 'enough', 'simply', 'show', 'killings', 'showing', 'motivations', 'course', 'kill', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'killed', 'knowing', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'part', 'information', 'conveyed', 'manga', 'novel', 'what', 'made', 'connect', 'character.In', 'novel', 'manga', 'was', 'match', 'ups', 'kept', 'one', 'attention', 'Would', 'martial', 'artist', 'be', 'able', 'beat', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'Would', 'beautiful', 'vixen', 'be', 'able', 'seduce', 'guys', 'death', 'Would', 'athletic', 'girl', 'be', 'able', 'fight', 'off', 'stronger', 'undisciplined', 'guy', 'would', 'semi-trained', 'veteran', 'be', 'able', 'out', 'maneuver', 'psycho', 'were', 'lost', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'act', 'differently', 'other', 'Yes', 'are', 'teens', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'hold', 'gun', 'shoot', 'even', 'survive', 'open', 'even', 'main', 'evil', 'characters', 'appear', 'move', 'novel', 'manga', 'wrapping', 'story', 'nicely', 'done', 'twist', 'mystery', 'novel', 'movie', 'boiled', 'down', 'hurry', 'up', 'let', 'finish', 'run', 'tape', 'kind', 'deal.All', 'think', 'will', 'just', 'pretend', 'movie', 'never', 'happened']",N/A
597387,A2QX63R4BHBRSP,B00005JL99,Robert Stotzky,"[16, 27]","To say that the Japanese cinematic tradition is different fromits Western counterpart would be the understatement of the year.Japanese cinema has never succumbed to the moralistic approach tomoviemaking that permeates Hollywood. To further prove thispoint, enter ""Battle Royale"", surely the most controversial filmin years. The story is as follows:At the dawn of a new millennium, Japanese society is out of hand.Unemployment rates are at an all-time high; kids are skippingschool and physically assaulting their teachers. This has led tothe government introducing a new measure to keep kids in line -the Battle Royale Act. Every year, a ninth-grade class is chosenat random and transported to a deserted island, where they areequipped with ""Wedlock""-style necklaces that can be made toexplode, a map, a compass, food and water and a weapon. Theirgoal is to survive for three days on the island - while killingoff all of their classmates. If, at the end of day three, morethan one person is alive, they are all killed.The hero of this movie is ninth-grader Shuya Nanahara, who swearsthat he will protect the girl he loves, Noriko, and somehow makesure they both survive. He is unwilling to kill but desperate notto die, an attitude not shared by all, as we are about towitness.As they are equipped with various weapons, ranging from pot lidsto machine guns, we observe how different their attitudes turnout to be, from Nanahara who is devastated when he thinks heaccidentally killed another boy, to the machine-gun wielding kidwho kills everyone in his path without remorse.""Battle Royale"" has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's ""AClockwork Orange"". I would hesitate making that comparison,mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Kubrick's. While ""AClockwork Orange"" is almost as disturbing in its violence as""Battle Royale"", the latter is in my opinion the superior film.The sight of 15-year old kids dressed in school uniforms killingeach other with crossbows, sickles, axes and machine-guns is muchmore disturbing than watching a bunch of freaks wearing falsenoses assaulting a helpless man. It is hard to put yourself inthe position of Alex and his cronies in ""A Clockwork Orange"",simply because they are so strange. This is not the case with thekids in ""Battle Royale"".The absence of flashy camerawork, slow motion and other cinematictricks transforms the camera from a machine to a nihilisticoutside observer. This is a trademark in Japanese cinema, and hasbeen used in films as varied in style and context as TakeshiKitano's ""Violent Cop"" and Norifumi Suzuki's ""Star of David:Beautiful Girl Hunter"". Not to mention that making a movie likethis in the days of Columbine requires something that virtuallyall American film-makers lack: guts. That no American distributordared import ""Battle Royale"" just goes to show how conformist theonce individualistic American society really has become.So is there nothing about this film that could be better? Well,yes. There are two things I feel should have been different.First of all the length of the film. At a mere 109 minutes, it istoo short. I would have wanted another thirty minutes or soexplaining the background, to get to know the kids better. We doget to know them through a few flashbacks, but I would havewanted more. Had this film started out as a typical American high-school film like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""American Pie"" theviolence would have been even more disturbing. Second of all,it's the violence itself. While I do not feel that violence is initself important to a film, it does serve a purpose. My objectionis not that there is too much violence, but that it is notgraphic enough. When I see a kid getting shot I don't just want asquib going off (a squib is a small plastic bag or rubber balloonfilled with fake blood, which is made to explode to give theimpression of a gunshot wound), I want Dario Argento-styleeffects where you follow the bullet through the body, showing theeffects of the gunshot in all their gory details. If that wouldbe too flashy for this film, why not at least use the greatJapanese tradition of special effects and make a film that makesyour stomach turn?Nevertheless, ""Battle Royale"" is an experience unlike any other,and if there was any kind of justice in the world this is thefilm that would win the Academy Award for best foreign film. Weall know that it won't. This is a movie that dares questionmodern society and what it is doing to people, and that is thereason why it will never win an Oscar. It is not conformistenough. That is why I love it.All I can say is: ""Arigato, Kinji-san.""",5,Film of the year,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,4590,"['say', 'Japanese', 'cinematic', 'tradition', 'different', 'fromits', 'Western', 'counterpart', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'year.Japanese', 'cinema', 'never', 'succumbed', 'moralistic', 'approach', 'tomoviemaking', 'Hollywood', 'further', 'prove', 'thispoint', 'enter', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'surely', 'most', 'controversial', 'filmin', 'years', 'story', 'dawn', 'new', 'millennium', 'Japanese', 'society', 'hand.Unemployment', 'rates', 'are', 'all-time', 'high', 'kids', 'are', 'skippingschool', 'physically', 'assaulting', 'teachers', 'led', 'tothe', 'government', 'introducing', 'new', 'measure', 'keep', 'kids', 'line', '-the', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Act', 'year', 'ninth-grade', 'class', 'chosenat', 'random', 'transported', 'deserted', 'island', 'where', 'areequipped', 'Wedlock', '-style', 'necklaces', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'toexplode', 'map', 'compass', 'food', 'water', 'weapon', 'Theirgoal', 'survive', 'three', 'days', 'island', 'classmates', 'end', 'day', 'three', 'morethan', 'one', 'person', 'alive', 'are', 'killed.The', 'hero', 'movie', 'ninth-grader', 'Shuya', 'Nanahara', 'who', 'swearsthat', 'will', 'protect', 'girl', 'Noriko', 'somehow', 'makesure', 'survive', 'unwilling', 'kill', 'desperate', 'notto', 'die', 'attitude', 'not', 'shared', 'are', 'are', 'equipped', 'various', 'weapons', 'ranging', 'pot', 'lidsto', 'machine', 'guns', 'observe', 'how', 'different', 'attitudes', 'be', 'Nanahara', 'who', 'devastated', 'when', 'heaccidentally', 'killed', 'boy', 'machine-gun', 'wielding', 'kidwho', 'everyone', 'path', 'remorse', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'been', 'compared', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'AClockwork', 'Orange', 'would', 'hesitate', 'making', 'comparison', 'mostly', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Kubrick', 'AClockwork', 'Orange', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'latter', 'opinion', 'superior', 'film.The', 'sight', '15-year', 'old', 'kids', 'dressed', 'school', 'uniforms', 'killingeach', 'other', 'crossbows', 'sickles', 'axes', 'machine-guns', 'muchmore', 'disturbing', 'watching', 'bunch', 'freaks', 'wearing', 'falsenoses', 'assaulting', 'helpless', 'man', 'hard', 'put', 'inthe', 'position', 'Alex', 'cronies', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'simply', 'are', 'so', 'strange', 'not', 'case', 'thekids', 'Battle', 'Royale', '.The', 'absence', 'flashy', 'camerawork', 'slow', 'motion', 'other', 'cinematictricks', 'camera', 'machine', 'nihilisticoutside', 'observer', 'trademark', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'hasbeen', 'used', 'films', 'varied', 'style', 'context', 'TakeshiKitano', 'Violent', 'Cop', 'Norifumi', 'Suzuki', 'Star', 'David', 'Beautiful', 'Girl', 'Hunter', 'Not', 'mention', 'making', 'movie', 'likethis', 'days', 'Columbine', 'something', 'virtuallyall', 'American', 'film-makers', 'lack', 'guts', 'American', 'distributordared', 'import', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'conformist', 'theonce', 'individualistic', 'American', 'society', 'really', 'become.So', 'there', 'nothing', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Well', 'yes', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'different.First', 'length', 'film', 'mere', '109', 'minutes', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'soexplaining', 'background', 'get', 'know', 'kids', 'better', 'doget', 'know', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'havewanted', 'more', 'Had', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'typical', 'American', 'high-school', 'film', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'American', 'Pie', 'theviolence', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Second', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'violence', 'initself', 'important', 'film', 'serve', 'purpose', 'objectionis', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'notgraphic', 'enough', 'When', 'see', 'kid', 'getting', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'asquib', 'going', 'off', 'squib', 'small', 'plastic', 'bag', 'rubber', 'balloonfilled', 'fake', 'blood', 'made', 'explode', 'give', 'theimpression', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'want', 'Dario', 'Argento-styleeffects', 'where', 'follow', 'bullet', 'body', 'showing', 'theeffects', 'gunshot', 'gory', 'details', 'wouldbe', 'too', 'flashy', 'film', 'why', 'not', 'least', 'use', 'greatJapanese', 'tradition', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'film', 'stomach', 'turn', 'Nevertheless', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'experience', 'other', 'was', 'kind', 'justice', 'world', 'thefilm', 'would', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'foreign', 'film', 'Weall', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'movie', 'questionmodern', 'society', 'what', 'doing', 'people', 'thereason', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'Oscar', 'not', 'conformistenough', 'why', 'love', 'it.All', 'can', 'say', 'Arigato', 'Kinji-san']",N/A

I have seen the Hunger Games before I have seen Battle Royale and the similarities are way too strong between the two movies I have to agree that the Hunger Games does feel like an American remake to Battle Royale.What makes Battle Royale interesting is the fact that violence is forced upon the teenagers, or rather teenagers are forced to use violence upon each other in order to survive. Most violence movies have adult characters. And those adult characters mostly have criminal intent and exercise their free-will to commit the crimes. Battle Royale creates a setting where teenagers are thrown into a situation where they are forced to kill one another in order to survive. I have to admit that teenage Japanese girls shooting at each other violently does create an unprecedented spectacle in the action-violent genre.I think Battle Royale makes a strong social commentary about the violent trends among youngsters today and how the tough competition pushes them towards eliminating each other violently.However, the movie is not without its flaws. I am specially disappointed by the colors in the movie. I picked up the Blu-ray expecting a great picture quality. The colors are flat, almost non-existent. There is almost no contrast. The poor color saturation takes away from the visual style of the movie. As for the plotline, I have never understood the reason for Battle Royale act. How is Battle Royale act supposed to help the country ? That is never explained in the movie. I am sure most fans know since they read the book. Another criticism would be the relations between characters are not established in the beginning. I think the book does a better job of developing the relations between different characters.

Just what I saw on the screen 15 minutes ago.The premise was a bit odd.The ""world"" background was totally left out (seems like it was supposed to be a modern day Japan) so it seems odd that the adults decided to toss a bunch of unruly teens -by unruly I don't mean murderers or rapists, just kids who didn't seem to like ""respecting their elders"", although in Japan, maybe that's worse than murdering or raping your parent... - onto an island to kill each other off. At least Running Man had a whole world built around it so the suspension of belief was much more attainable.The action wasn't anything special. No cool moves or creative effects (although for the time the addition of the post production blood spray - much like what you see in The Expendables now - might have been ground breaking). All pretty standard to sub standard. The Uzi of unending ammo got real annoying after awhile (he did change clips once but that was for drama - yhea yhea, showing all the clip changing is boring and uninteresting so they just edited those out, right? All, say, 15 of them? how heavy was that backpack in the first place!? btw it was amazing how much his ability with that thing varied).The movie was more about the relationships between the students than anything. That's where most of the screen time went and creative writing. But if that's what you're into, go check out The Breakfast Club before getting this. Personally, I didn't care if any of them lived...or died, really. Of course, I'm not a 16 year old Japanese student, either, so who am I going to relate to? The only two ****incoming spoiler, kinda**** I was glad got it was Ms Psycho chick (with the sickle) and the Uzi guy (just so he'd stop firing that damn Uzi).No idea why this was given 5 stars.

I like the way it explore the various options that may be taken in such a situation, from those refusing to fight, those who try to outwit the system, the lone killers and those who band together. There is a lot more to this film than the violent depictions and I agree that it is a very potent piece of social commentary. I also agree with those reviews that liken this film to 'Lord of the Flies', it really does to seem to be a modern equivalent.

I liked how it tackled things like trust, friendship and love when put in dire situations with fellow peers. For those of you who have not read the novel ,troubled teens have practically taken over schools, mocking teachers and adults alike. In order to regain some sort of stability in a once adult dominated society, they have formed a new law where students are forced into a live action game of kill or be killed in what the government has dubbed  the BR Act or Bttle Royale. Specifically, the teens are put on a deserted island where each one has to fend off against each other, with the hopes of being the last one standing and receive their ticket home. So essentialy there are two ways to leave the island kill everyone(including friends) or be killed by them, and they got three days to do it. So, you may wonder why not try and leave the island or just hide until the three days are up.We'll each one of them has a metal collar, which is basically a means to keep them moving and if any of them get out of line or if the three days are up then BOOM! That's right it blows up. There are dangerzones that are activated over a certain period of time, and if your caught in one the collar will explode, so hangin out in the bushes is not going to work for long. Now judging from the plot it's safe to say that there a lot death and violence, and the fact these are real teenagers playing these characters makes it as controversial as the book. One of the most intresting aspects of the film would be to see how each one of these students would fine a way to killthem selves or others.We have the love struck suicides to the [...] gung-ho type that takes on five at a time. Another great aspect is how they had to work with what they got. Before they went into the field each student received a backpack full of supplies that would last them three days they had. Some were lucky to have guns while others were not as luckyand had objects like trash can lid and binoculars.

You are than drugged and dragged to an undisclosed location where you are told that you are now in a fight for survival amongst your class mates. Winner kills all.This is not a reality any of us expect to wake up to any time soon. This film was made to bring to an extreme light the competitiveness and ignorant structure of the japanese school system. It's a satire of the extreme lengths a government would go to in order to get the youth to fall in line. It's a sign of our troubled times where the young are no longer innocent, and many times they are forced to confront realities that were once years away but now are common place for your average 13 or 14 year old. This is the world of Battle Royale, a symphony of fear and violence. A warning that will never reach the ears that were meant to hear it.This is not a movie about the joys of violence. It is not an anime style fantasy where young kids have super powers and fearlessly kill others for sport. These kids are thrust into their primitive instincts for survival. Making choices that no one should have to make. Would you kill your best friend if it meant your survival? Every possible reaction is explored, from the lovers who would rather die together than play the game, to the internet geeks who use their intelligence to outwit their oppressors. The Director uses classical music to elevate the violence from a mere childish fascination with blood and gore (ala Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill)to a serious situation where lives are real and death is not glorified.It is not as violent as it may appear and it is also not as cruel as one may come to believe. This movie will never be seen by mainstream America because instead of confronting our fears we blame our media for our faults and hide from the agony our young are going through. We pretend to be squeky clean but allow movies like Kill Bill to grace our movie screens. Violence is all right as long as it's for fun. Violence that teaches a lesson is outrageous and immoral.

Sad thing is, this notion is correct.I would never object to a film being over the top violent if there is a serious comment it's making while using the violence as an over-emphasis point or as a depiction of a particular reality. A good example would be ""Natural Born Killers"" by Oliver Stone.But Battle Royale is simply a ridiculous b-movie trying to front itself as a flick with serious social commentary.The attempt-at-a-plot is about a future society where the government seeing youngsters as a threat picks one school class per year and sends it to a remote island where they are condemned to exterminate each other till only one survives. This is supposed to set an example for other rebellious youth who might have the ""wrong ideas"".Now this premise had massive potential to turn into a very interesting dystopia commentary, very much in the lines of classic books like ""1984"" or ""Brave new World"". Alas, the scriptwriter of this cheapo-flick was no G.Orwell or A.Huxley.What we get instead is first an ultra-thin set-up of the plot. No explanations are given about what we're seeing and no comments about it either. The supposed plot is put together within the first 5 minutes because the director is obviously in a big hurry to get the massacre-thon under way.After that, we see a class of 40 students who've been picked, most armed to the teeth, blowing each other's heads off (along with other body parts as well) while uttering lines of enormous stupidity and while muttering dialogues about ""who's in love with whom"" (this you'll hear at least a dozen times from a dozen different characters) while the body-piles around them are increasing.There's not one single character in this film that says anything above the IQ of a microwave oven, not one single line worth remembering, not even a hint at anything of any intellectual value.It's inevitable of course, that this film has attained its cult status, especially among the generations grown up with mindless video games of the same frequency who will see this film as ""provocative"" only because of its level of violence.But even if it was to be taken on that level, that is, even if it was to be judged on sheer shock-value it would still fail.The directing is so cheap and the actors so much cheaper, that most of the time it comes across as a parody of something gone unbelievably wrong.When i read the storyline of the film in some magazine, i thought i was in for a serious film of independent and underground cinema.

Set in a Japanese colony of the very near future, the action follows those youngsters as they are dispatched on the island where with three days worth of arms and food, they must fight to the death. The ultimate winner - and, of course, there can be only one - is then deemed fit to retake their place in Japanese society. In equal measures, violent and humourous, Battle Royale ignores the accepted parameters of the average action movie, and instead offers a savage critique of the pressures and motivations of young people in today's society.

It was an influence for Quentin's Kill Bill movies, and anyone who's a fan of those must absolutely have to see this movie as well.  I'm aware that it's also drawn comparisons with the Hunger Games, but I'm not sure that's fair.  They have similar concepts, but they're different stories and have different points to make.  And Battle Royale itself isn't the first ""Fight to the Death!"" type of story anyway, but it sure is one of the best.Now this is a gory little story.  In fact, it's been banned in some countries for violence.  Kids are shooting and cutting each other up, and pretty much everyone's covered in blood by the end.  Personally, I wasn't that shocked by it, but I watch a lot of violent movies.  Make no mistake, this is no simple gore-fest.  This is actually a very human story.  You see all the emotions these characters are going through as they're thrown into this intolerable situation.  This movie exposes the worst humanity has to offer, but it also shows some of the best.  Believe it or not, my sister actually said, ""Aw, that's so cute"" multiple times while watching this.  For every character trying to murder their best friend, there's another sacrificing himself for his high school crush.I'll admit I haven't read the book, so I can't say how the movie compares to it.  I've read another reviewer say Kiriyama is underdeveloped compared to his presentation in the book.  That'd be a shame, cause he's a total badass in the movie, and a real-life example of what I like to call ""main character hair.""Unless you're very squeamish when it comes to violence, you need to see this movie.  It's twisted, demented, and full of action, but it's also very thought provoking.  I can't wait for the day when high school teachers start showing this to students in the classroom.

This is what people who dismiss subtitled films are really missing out on.  Now that I'm done gushing, I'll give you the review.  The film involves a group of around 40 students in a classroom that has been randomly chosen for the government's BR (Battle Royale....duh!) program.  The children are gassed and placed on a secluded island where they are shown a hilariously satirical (and extremely upbeat) instructional video instructing them that they are to kill each other and the last boy or girl standing gets to go home.  Each student receives a package containing water, map, compass, etc. and a weapon, some useless like a soup pot lid and some lethal, such as a sickle or even a machine gun.  Any resistance explodes a steel collar that has been placed around each student's neck.  Let the carnage begin!  Kill Bill fans will recognize one familiar face in the brilliantly psychotic Chiaki Kuriyama (minus her ball-and-chain).  As the killfest commences, different strategies emerge.  Some students seek and destroy their former comrades while others band together and hide out and some simply do themselves in rather than participate in the blood bath. Some even hatch a plot to hack into the BR computer system and bring the battle to a halt.  Then there's that mysterious ""exchange student"" who showed up in class for the first time on the day of the Battle Royale and seems just a little too thrilled with it all as he mows down everyone he comes across without a word. So much fun! You see each and every death and the movie counts down the students as they die until it's all over.  The battles are very gritty and real; sorry, no kung fu or anime-style sword battles.  This is the most enjoyable foreign film I've seen since Versus, and this is by far the better film.  If you have even heard of this movie you owe it to yourself to own it.  It begs to be watched again and again.

597419,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00005JL99,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 4]","Kinji Fukasaki's ""BATTLE ROYALE"" (Batoru Rowaiaru, 2000) is the type of film whose reputation precedes it. Remade recently as ""The Condemned"" by the U.S., the film sparked such controversy and almost became banned from its native Japan. Its hype was far-reaching that when the movie reached America, it was even proclaimed the `movie of the decade'. I'm not sure whether I can agree with that claim but one thing's for sure; Japanese filmmakers had the guts to pull off a movie that depicts violence and murder done by teenagers. It is easy to dismiss ""Battle Royale"" as an action-packed, exploitive thriller but the movie is just so much more.In a not-so different alternate future, Japan has experienced economic collapse with a massive unemployment rate. With no clear future, students begin to disrespect the education system, with an increase in riots and violence, student drop outs are also occurring at an alarming rate. To control the situation, the government enacts the ""Battle Royale Act"" that consists of the selection by secret lottery for one of the poorest performing class in the country and sending the students off to an island where they must fight each other to the death until only one is left standing. The students have 72 hours to complete the game or everyone dies from the explosive devices on their necks. They are supplied with random weapons, given special instructions to avoid danger zones and if they make trouble, the army will find them and kill them. Former friends are forced to kill or be killed; the students experience mistrust, fear, confusion and hatred, as chaos run unchecked...""Battle Royale"" serves as a cautionary tale for the teen generation. It does start off simply enough, with themes of morality and immorality are presented in the film's first act. There is a small hole but the film's plot holds strong as Fukasaki's adaptation of the novel generates suspense and gritty thrills as there are no dull moments in the film. It also lets its characters speak for themselves, characterization is partly done through the use of flashbacks. Kitano (played by Takashi Kitano) is the former teacher who has his own issues, the students all have different backgrounds, and they all have different reactions to their situation as well differing motivations. I liked the characters especially those of Mitsuko (played by Ayana Noguchi, her character shines in the Special version) and Noriko (Aki Maeda), they appear to be similar sides of the same coin although very different. Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara, Death Note) is the one person who tries keep his moral beliefs, I may even go as far as his only motivation would be Noriko. Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) is the one student who was mostly an enigma throughout the film, his motivations remained unclear until the final act.The film has a subtle but powerful social commentary as well but none as resounding as the message Fukasaki brings into exposition for teens. Fukasaki does keep the messages restrained to avoid the film from becoming ruined by a heavy-handed sentimentality. He brings the idea of ""working together"" which was formerly the foundation of Japanese society. Overtime, such teamwork collapses as the sheer pressure of survival proves too much as mistrust plants its ugly root. You see some students working as a team, but such ""team-ups"" are ultimately ruined by insecurity and fear. The film's final act resoundingly says that one has to trust each other wholeheartedly in order to achieve success. Fukasaki also encourages today's youth to ""go for it"" as if to say that the future is theirs for the taking; believe in yourself and don't be too hasty in trusting adults. There are also several other strong messages in the film as certain dark themes in the complexities of everyday life are touched on; jealousy, fear, meekness, dishonesty, love, shame and helplessness. The characters do have a way out of this situation and they must face the problem head-on; they must do the best they can to deal with it. The reactions are pretty reflective of their own sense of morality (or immorality).The film has sparked strong controversy in America for its main premise of ""kids killing kids"" and while the violence is indeed brutal and uncompromising in this director's cut, it is not much as to how violent it is, (I've seen films more violent and brutal) but the film touches a nerve that makes it hard to see kids killing kids...it is not so much the act of killing but the who is doing the killing. It is pretty disturbing to see kids acting like this, some are scared that they commit suicide, some try to take advantage of others while others revel in the violence for fun. Having innocents put in a situation where they must kill people they know to survive is the troubling part of the film. I also think that Fukasaki cautions teenagers from mocking adults and to mind themselves otherwise, the repercussions of their actions may be just be too much.The dramatic scenes aren't overwrought and I liked the even direction done by Fukasaki. He never allowed his social commentaries or his heavy themes and messages mess with the film's action and violence. Fukasaki appears to also be poking fun at the dramatic sequences that anyone can form an attachment to the film even by approaching it from an exploitive, unadulterated dark fun standpoint. The film is also suspenseful as you see the death toll rise up after each `update', one can easily feel dread wondering whether the characters they've rooted for would survive. (6-8 of them take center stage)America easily proclaimed the film as brutal, violent and uncompromising but truth be told, the violence in ""Battle Royale"" isn't something new to the experienced movie watcher. The blood and guts (with mild gore) does help the film along, but it isn't all about the action but a matter of which Fukasaki delivers his message to Japanese society. Takeshi Kitano is awesome as usual and Masanobu Ando is creepy as the student who never speaks. Chiaki Kuriyama (plays Chigusa) caught Tarantino's eye that she played Go-go Yubari in ""Kill Bill"". (Did I fail to mention that this is among QT's favorite films?) ""Battle Royale"" is far more than an action film that glorifies blood and violence, some would say that it is simply an orgy of violent behavior while others who see the message will absolutely adore the film. It is one film that has the balls to portray violence that has real emotions going for it. One thing's for sure, it is one film that will never be forgotten and one that which Hollywood wishes it thought of the idea first--or had the guts to pull it off.What was that some say that Asian directors can't keep up with the big-shots of Hollywood? Those who said that deserve a Spider Finger Jab in the face...Highly Recommended!

597420,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005JL99,Zack Davisson,"[10, 13]","&quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a superb film, subtle and sad and over-the-top and loud all at the same time.  The story is often compared to &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; but that is a bit of a misnomer.  &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was about reverting to primitivism, whereas &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a futuristic cautionary tale in the tune of &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World.&quot;  The caution at work here is the threat of absolute bureaucracy, and the dangers of the loss of the value of life and respect in a rules-dominated society.  This is a threat quite apparent in modern Japan.The actors in &quot;Battle Royale&quot; all deliver excellent performances, including the amazing talent &quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi Kitano playing the appropriately named &quot;Kitano.&quot;  The film was not directed by Takeshi however, so it lacks his beautiful visual style.  It does however feature one of his riveting paintings. There is a good range of responses from the various actors playing the students, from outright suicide, to panic, to a drive to win to a drive to help.  Unfortunately, the character of Kazuo Kiriyama (the machine gun boy) is woefully underdeveloped, and instead of the fierce, cold genius of the book he is a somewhat characterless villain.While a violent film, I wouldn't characterize &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as an action film per se.  Anyone looking for a Hong Kong-style action film should realize that Japan and China are quite different countries with different approach to movies..  &quot;Battle Royale&quot; retains the quietude and patient pacing that is the hallmark of Japanese cinema, and which leaves some viewers bored, who are used to a quicker pacing.  The bloodshed, while in great quantity, is also more cartoony in nature, which is also more typical of Japanese films, which does not favor a naturalistic approach.I think some familiarity with problems in modern Japan (ie: school violence, overwhelming bureaucracy) gives some necessary perspective to this controversial movie, and helps frame it as more than exploitation.  It is a political statement, with a subtle message underlying the overt violence.  Along with this, knowledge of Japanese culture deepens the understandings of certain scenes, such as when Kitano performs the prescribed exercises, and the training video shown at the beginning.  Without understanding, these scenes might come off as merely quaint or odd.",5,"We, who are about to die...",1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2438,"['quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'superb', 'film', 'subtle', 'sad', 'over-the-top', 'loud', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'often', 'compared', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'quot', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'quot', 'was', 'reverting', 'primitivism', 'whereas', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'futuristic', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'tune', 'quot', '1984', 'quot', 'quot', 'Brave', 'New', 'World.', 'quot', 'caution', 'work', 'here', 'threat', 'absolute', 'bureaucracy', 'dangers', 'loss', 'value', 'life', 'respect', 'rules-dominated', 'society', 'threat', 'quite', 'apparent', 'modern', 'Japan.The', 'actors', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'deliver', 'excellent', 'performances', 'including', 'amazing', 'talent', 'quot', 'Beat', 'quot', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'playing', 'appropriately', 'named', 'quot', 'Kitano.', 'quot', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'directed', 'Takeshi', 'however', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'style', 'however', 'feature', 'one', 'riveting', 'paintings', 'good', 'range', 'responses', 'various', 'actors', 'playing', 'students', 'outright', 'suicide', 'panic', 'drive', 'win', 'drive', 'help', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'Kazuo', 'Kiriyama', 'machine', 'gun', 'boy', 'woefully', 'underdeveloped', 'instead', 'fierce', 'cold', 'genius', 'book', 'somewhat', 'characterless', 'violent', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'characterize', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'action', 'film', 'se', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'Hong', 'Kong-style', 'action', 'film', 'should', 'realize', 'Japan', 'China', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'countries', 'different', 'approach', 'movies..', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'quot', 'quietude', 'patient', 'pacing', 'hallmark', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'viewers', 'bored', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'quicker', 'pacing', 'bloodshed', 'great', 'quantity', 'also', 'more', 'cartoony', 'nature', 'also', 'more', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'films', 'not', 'favor', 'naturalistic', 'approach.I', 'think', 'familiarity', 'problems', 'modern', 'Japan', 'ie', 'school', 'violence', 'overwhelming', 'bureaucracy', 'necessary', 'perspective', 'controversial', 'movie', 'frame', 'more', 'exploitation', 'political', 'statement', 'subtle', 'message', 'underlying', 'overt', 'violence', 'knowledge', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'understandings', 'certain', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Kitano', 'prescribed', 'training', 'video', 'shown', 'beginning', 'understanding', 'scenes', 'might', 'come', 'off', 'merely', 'quaint', 'odd']",N/A

Teenagers are boycotting school, physically abusing their teachers, and others that actually go to school are always truant, so the government decides to pass the BR act. A class of teenagers are drugged and are sent to an abandoned island and are forced to kill each other within 72 hours, leaving only one person alive. They all get a weapon, as well as a bag containing food, water, and a map. Their ""sensei"" (teacher) gives updates every six hours, detailing where the ""danger zones"" are, and who has been killed recently, or killed since the BR began. Now, they have the option to get revenge on someone they despise, and have to sacrifice their friends in order to stay alive. Who'd have thought a bunch of school kids slaughtering each other would make such an incredible movie? Recommended.As for the DVD, Apparently Toei (the copyright owners of the film) hasn't licensed it to a US distributor and they've rejected a few offers. The movie was a huge hit in Japan and Toei figured they'd get a big theatrical release in the US and decided to wait until they did. Unfortunately the movie was made in 1999. Anybody remember what happened that year? Columbine. So as you can imagine, it was a while before any US distributor would even think about releasing this movie. By the time the heat from that wore off, the region zero and bootlegs were all over the place and distributors saw the value of a DVD release but not theatrical.
