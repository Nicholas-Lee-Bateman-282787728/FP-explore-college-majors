BUT at least most of those reviewers appear to be speaking from a point of &quot;FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE&quot; -- e.g., the &quot;production value&quot; of the DVD, the &quot;important points not addressed&quot; by the filmmakers, comments about &quot;specific scenes&quot; shown in the film, etc. Even some of those giving votes of &quot;support&quot; to this film are freely expressing certain criticisms they have with the film and/or the way it presents its message, but they seem to be able to do so legitimately because they have actually &quot;SEEN&quot; the film they are reviewing.By severe contrast, virtually everyone who is talking stink about this film seems to be little more than just a bunch of knee-jerk reactionary trolls who are intent on nothing more than &quot;flooding&quot; the site with GENERALIZED negative remarks about the film without knowing the first thing about the film other than the fact that it paints Fox News and Bill O'Reilly in a bad light. Why not &quot;SEE&quot; the movie for yourself, then comment on the actual CONTENT of the film? Then, even if you choose to post an &quot;unflattering&quot; review of the documentary, at least you'll have something specific to point our attention toward, rather than expressing ignorance-driven indignation and spewing generalized B.S. about something you honestly know absolutely nothing about!!!Please let the people who have actually SEEN the movie do the movie &quot;REVIEWING&quot;!",3,To the 'Negative Reviewers'...

Using volunteers who monitored Fox &quot;News&quot; 24 hours a day for months, the film makers are able to discern and highlight several tactics Fox uses to portrary right-wing opinion as news. Although the film demonstrates conclusively that Bill O'Reilly is over-the-top and frequently plays loose with the truth, I doubt anyone will be surprised by the revelation. More disturbing are the more subtle ways in which Fox indoctrinates its viewers into believing things that are not true. For instance, the film exposes the frequent use of &quot;People say...&quot; as the introduction to assertions that don't meet anyone's criteria for news. The numerous former Fox employees who are willing to speak out are impressive, as are the comments from Walter Cronkite. In the end, Outfoxed overwhelmingly proves its thesis : Fox News is grossly misrepresenting itself to America when it claims to be fair and balanced. Fox, in reality, is neither. Nor is it news. BUT people watch Fox News to reconfirm what they want to believe. Fox could drop its misleading self-description and still have plenty of viewers; thus, this documentary is more about confronting Fox News' spin in an attempt at making the corporation responsible than about helping its willingly duped viewers. Nevertheless, it is a worthy goal. Finally, as much as I enjoyed the revealations about Fox News, the film does not merit five stars.

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 14]","Outfoxed is a bold documentary that allows the viewer to see another side of the world that perhaps we take for granted. It allows us to make our own decisions and make the changes we need to change our future. While some may shout that Outfoxed is a product of quick editing and mixed messages, I think that it provides (for the least part) a stepping stool to see which other companies or people participate in our political society. We see it happen so often in film, that I wonder if we ever stop to think if it could happen here ... in the Mountains of Virginny. I believe that it is coming, and if we don't (as an individual and organization) try to help we may stop companies from taking advantage of us and providing forms of propaganda to our children. What I find horrifying is that other stations are beginning to follow suite after seeing that FOX can do it successfully. I foresee in the future a future no too different than that of 1984.

833163,A1QI4ATF368A9B,B0002HDXTQ,Allison,"[6, 7]","Is this DVD preaching to the choir? Sure. But this documentary needed to be made to wake up liberals (who are generally not part of FNC's demographic) to the fact that Fox News is a right-wing propaganda machine that is in no way ""fair and balanced."" My jaw dropped at some of the stuff this ""news"" channel gets away with. Supposed ""journalists"" attacking Richard Clarke because his book more heavily criticized Bush than Clinton for the 9/11 attacks. Kerry shouldn't be elected president because he seems too ""French."" Bill O'Reilly stifling freedom of thought and speech by cutting off guests' mics, telling them to shut up, or threatening to boycott their movies because they have the audacity (like Martin Sheen) to march in protest of the Iraq War. (Hey, Fox, instead of picking on celebrities, why not go after the politicans who are running the country into the ground?) I also thought it was funny that when Rupert Murdoch was asked to name his liberal commentators, he immediately named Alan Colmes and then struggled and ""um ohs"" until Greta Van Sustern finally pops in his mind. Two liberal commentators? That's it? Seems pretty unfair and unbalanced to me! One fault I might have with the film, however, is that it only superficially touches on what is wrong with the Hannity and Colmes show. This is the program that supposedly proves FNC is not biased because we get the liberal's as well as the conservative's point of view. Yes, Hannity might have the edge over Colmes somewhat because he is handsome while Colmes is plain. But, then again, Al Franken is kind of nerdy looking like Colmes. The difference between Colmes and Franken, however, is that Franken is a hard left while Colmes is comparatively moderate. Franken is Hannity's equal, not Colmes. But since Hannity is an extremely agressive, arch conservative and Colmes is a mild-mannered left-of-center Democrat, Hannity dominates the show. Since the film had Al Franken on in the segment concerning Jeremy Glick and O'Reilly, I wish the filmmakers could have interviewed him about the inherent problems with H&C. If you wish to see for yourself what Franken thinks of H&C, read ""Lying Liars."" Otherwise, this is an eye-opening documentary. I would also recommend ""This Divided State,"" a film about Michael Moore and Sean Hannity being invited to give speeches at a conservative Utah college and the protests that ensue.

833165,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0002HDXTQ,Anyechka,"[8, 9]","Yes, it's no secret that Fox is unfair and biased instead of fair and balanced and is a very scary dispenser of radical right-wing propaganda, but this excellent documentary, contrary to what some detractors might suggest, does a lot more than just restating the obvious.  It gives many chilling and concrete examples of the different types of propaganda the channel uses, how it's run (scarily like Stalinist Russia, as seen in the examples of memos ordering people what to cover, and how, and the examples of people being screamed at and suspended if they didn't go along with the agenda, like what happened to Jon Du Pre when he didn't glorify Reagan's 90th birthday as something akin to a holy day, even though there wasn't a lot to cover), how they attack anyone who goes against their own radical ideology, how they were actually the ones who ""called"" the 2000 election even though it was still too close to call at the time, and how they consistently insert their own political beliefs in with the phrase ""some say.""  And this is far from left-wing propaganda.  The people who made the documentary may be progressives, but that doesn't automatically mean it's just the other side of the coin.  I would consider a radical leftist to do things like, say, use the spellings ""Amerikkka"" and ""I$rael,"" or to be advocating anarchy, or to want to abolish the military.  All of the people interviewed in this documentary, a number of whom used to work for Fox, are very rational people who provide evidence for what they're talking about instead of frothing at the mouth with propaganda and rhetoric that's at the opposite end of the spectrum.There's also nothing wrong with the fact that Fox is a conservative channel with a consistently very conservative pov, since freedom of expression is one of our First Amendment rights and extends to everyone, not just people one agrees with.  The problem is with how they present these views.  Although I'm very left-wing, I know very well that there are a lot of intelligent conservatives out there, who calmly and maturely present their views and what they see as evidence to support these positions (as much as I disagree with them), who don't resort to bullying, childish name-calling, straw man arguments, fear-mongering, and outright lies to make their points.  A real conservative news network would have journalistic integrity, recognise that there's a conflict of interest if someone whose wife is covering the presidental campaign of the Republican candidate is himself covering that subject on the station, cover real issues instead of things that are either non-issues (since when does a silly story like ""Bennifer"" merit a news alert?!) or are designed to divide the people and divert attention from more serious things, not let their hosts constantly tell guests of opposing views to shut up and to label anyone who disagrees with them as enemies of the state, equally present both sides of an issue, not make the other side look ridiculous or like liars, while only showing their own people as demigods, have an equal amount of guests from each side, and have the panelists and hosts have equal credentials, instead of having their only ""liberal"" guests be very weak unknowns, conservatives in liberals' clothing, or someone like Alan Colmes, a pale squirrely-faced man who looks ridiculous when paired with a good-looking professional-looking guy like Sean Hannity.  As the documentary also says, the real truth should be arrived at after studying multiple points of view and going to multiple sources, instead of just getting all of your opinions from any news source, liberal or conservative, with such a demonstrated agenda and lack of journalistic integrity.Also included is a making-of featurette, featuring both the people who put the documentary together and the volunteers who watched Fox for 5 months to gather all of these chilling examples of disinformation, propaganda, and villification of anything that's not in line with the party ideology.  Unfortunately, this is one of those films that either won't be seen by those who most need to see it, or else is watched by said audience while covering their ears and shouting ""La la la I can't hear you!""  And for those who do agree with the film's conclusion but continue to say ""Who cares?"" because Fox being right-wing propaganda is such common knowledge, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau once said, ""As soon as anyone says of the affairs of the State `What does it matter to me?' the State may be given up for lost.""",5,"Shatters the myth of a ""liberal media""",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,4528,"['Yes', 'secret', 'Fox', 'unfair', 'biased', 'instead', 'fair', 'balanced', 'very', 'scary', 'dispenser', 'radical', 'right-wing', 'propaganda', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'contrary', 'what', 'detractors', 'might', 'suggest', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'restating', 'obvious', 'many', 'chilling', 'concrete', 'examples', 'different', 'types', 'propaganda', 'channel', 'how', 'run', 'scarily', 'Stalinist', 'Russia', 'seen', 'examples', 'memos', 'ordering', 'people', 'what', 'cover', 'how', 'examples', 'people', 'being', 'screamed', 'suspended', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'agenda', 'what', 'happened', 'Jon', 'Du', 'Pre', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'Reagan', '90th', 'birthday', 'something', 'akin', 'holy', 'day', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'cover', 'how', 'attack', 'anyone', 'who', 'own', 'radical', 'ideology', 'how', 'were', 'actually', 'ones', 'who', 'called', '2000', 'election', 'even', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'close', 'call', 'time', 'how', 'consistently', 'insert', 'own', 'political', 'beliefs', 'phrase', 'say', 'far', 'left-wing', 'propaganda', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'documentary', 'may', 'be', 'progressives', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'mean', 'just', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'would', 'consider', 'radical', 'leftist', 'do', 'things', 'say', 'use', 'spellings', 'Amerikkka', 'rael', 'be', 'advocating', 'anarchy', 'want', 'abolish', 'military', 'people', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'number', 'whom', 'used', 'work', 'Fox', 'are', 'very', 'rational', 'people', 'who', 'provide', 'evidence', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'instead', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'propaganda', 'rhetoric', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum.There', 'also', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'fact', 'Fox', 'conservative', 'channel', 'consistently', 'very', 'conservative', 'pov', 'freedom', 'expression', 'one', 'First', 'Amendment', 'rights', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'people', 'one', 'problem', 'how', 'present', 'views', ""'m"", 'very', 'left-wing', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'lot', 'intelligent', 'conservatives', 'there', 'who', 'calmly', 'maturely', 'present', 'views', 'what', 'see', 'evidence', 'support', 'positions', 'as', 'much', 'disagree', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'resort', 'bullying', 'childish', 'name-calling', 'straw', 'man', 'arguments', 'fear-mongering', 'outright', 'lies', 'make', 'points', 'real', 'conservative', 'news', 'network', 'would', 'have', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'recognise', 'conflict', 'interest', 'someone', 'wife', 'covering', 'presidental', 'campaign', 'Republican', 'candidate', 'covering', 'subject', 'station', 'cover', 'real', 'issues', 'instead', 'things', 'are', 'non-issues', 'when', 'silly', 'story', 'Bennifer', 'merit', 'news', 'alert', 'are', 'designed', 'divide', 'people', 'divert', 'attention', 'more', 'serious', 'things', 'not', 'let', 'hosts', 'constantly', 'tell', 'guests', 'opposing', 'views', 'shut', 'up', 'label', 'anyone', 'who', 'enemies', 'state', 'equally', 'present', 'sides', 'issue', 'not', 'make', 'other', 'side', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'like', 'liars', 'only', 'showing', 'own', 'people', 'demigods', 'have', 'equal', 'amount', 'guests', 'side', 'have', 'panelists', 'hosts', 'have', 'equal', 'credentials', 'instead', 'having', 'only', 'liberal', 'guests', 'be', 'very', 'weak', 'unknowns', 'conservatives', 'liberals', 'clothing', 'someone', 'Alan', 'Colmes', 'pale', 'squirrely-faced', 'man', 'who', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'paired', 'good-looking', 'professional-looking', 'guy', 'Sean', 'Hannity', 'documentary', 'also', 'real', 'truth', 'should', 'be', 'arrived', 'studying', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'going', 'multiple', 'sources', 'instead', 'just', 'getting', 'opinions', 'news', 'source', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'demonstrated', 'agenda', 'lack', 'journalistic', 'integrity.Also', 'included', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'documentary', 'together', 'volunteers', 'who', 'watched', 'Fox', '5', 'months', 'gather', 'chilling', 'examples', 'disinformation', 'propaganda', 'villification', 'anything', 'not', 'line', 'party', 'ideology', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'most', 'need', 'see', 'else', 'watched', 'said', 'audience', 'covering', 'ears', 'shouting', 'La', 'la', 'la', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'who', 'do', 'agree', 'film', 'conclusion', 'continue', 'say', 'Who', 'Fox', 'being', 'right-wing', 'propaganda', 'such', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Jean-Jacques', 'Rousseau', 'once', 'said', 'As', 'soon', 'anyone', 'affairs', 'State', 'What', 'matter', 'State', 'may', 'be', 'given', 'up', 'lost']",N/A

That's what is necessary to awaken us from our desensitized slumber, taking in what we are fed by most news outlets.  We can no longer just accept what's given; we must hunt out what is really happening.  And so, this video.  Fox 'News' is exposed for what it is - an adjunct of the GOP.Former Fox associates being interviewed with snippets of Fox talking heads corroborating their statements (Sean Hannity's comments that we are 'X number of days from Bush being re-elected' should make your hair stand up on end) make up the bulk of the documentary.Bill O'Reilly is taken to task.  Yes, we get to see an update on the Jeremy Glick's appearance on his show.  For those who may not remember, Glick was the young man whose father had been killed in the 9.11 attacks, who signed an anti-war petition.  O'Reilly had claimed that no one who had lost family in the attacks would dare do such a thing.  Mr. Glick did.  Fox got him on the show.  O'Reilly nearly accosted the young man.  Fair and balanced my a**.It's about time someone exposed this stuff.  Again, the video is not claiming to be 'fair and balanced'.  It merely takes Fox's outrageous claims of being fair and balanced to town, revealing that this is nothing but advertising, as if by stating it it makes it so.The video is segmented into various sections (e.g. Election Day coverage, etc.) and is a whirlwind of editing prowess, composed of soundbytes - fitting, in my opinion, considering that the 'world update' on most news channels comprises about three minutes, just a bit longer than the feel-good story they tack on at the end.Though a bit tedious - we get the point very early - this is an eye-opener.  You'll laugh or you'll cry, or even through things at your television, but it's important to watch this.

Bush is re-elected""Watching this documentary about Fox News, owned and micromanaged by arch-conservative Rupert Murdoch, you will be outraged over and over again by the unfair and unbalanced coverage, but the quote above is the one I found most jarring.  Would any NEWS organization say anything like this?  Even Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America, criticizes this right-wing propaganda machine that made a 180-degree turn from attack machine during the Clinton presidency to fawning lapdogs for Bush.Many respectable media critics are here, but the most damning evidence does come from the network's own broadcasts and memos, which constantly betray its bias and its role as a GOP propaganda machine.  Do you remember when we held up this kind of fascism as what differentiated us from the bad ol' USSR?  The GOP has become what they professed to hate.Perhaps most disturbing is watching the major networks let Fox News lead them around by the nose, even to the point of letting George W.'s cousin call the 2000 election in W's favor.  We watch as Fox calls the election and then see ABC, CBS and NBC fall in step several minutes later, which allows the Supreme Court to say that allowing Florida's recount to proceed would do harm to Bush, the presumptive winner.  By not standing up to Fox, more legitimate news organizations have done doing a disservice to this country for which it will take years to atone.The dvd also includes a trailer for Uncovered and a 29-minute making-of featurette.",4,the US's own propaganda network revealed,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1535,"['204', 'days', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 're-elected', 'Watching', 'documentary', 'Fox', 'News', 'owned', 'micromanaged', 'arch-conservative', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'will', 'be', 'outraged', 'over', 'again', 'unfair', 'unbalanced', 'coverage', 'quote', 'one', 'found', 'most', 'jarring', 'Would', 'NEWS', 'organization', 'say', 'anything', 'Even', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'most', 'trusted', 'man', 'America', 'right-wing', 'propaganda', 'machine', 'made', '180-degree', 'turn', 'attack', 'machine', 'Clinton', 'presidency', 'fawning', 'lapdogs', 'Bush.Many', 'respectable', 'media', 'critics', 'are', 'here', 'most', 'damning', 'evidence', 'come', 'network', 'own', 'broadcasts', 'memos', 'constantly', 'bias', 'role', 'GOP', 'propaganda', 'machine', 'Do', 'remember', 'when', 'held', 'up', 'kind', 'fascism', 'what', 'differentiated', 'bad', 'ol', 'USSR', 'GOP', 'become', 'what', 'professed', 'hate.Perhaps', 'most', 'disturbing', 'watching', 'major', 'networks', 'let', 'Fox', 'News', 'lead', 'around', 'nose', 'even', 'point', 'letting', 'George', 'W.', 'cousin', 'call', '2000', 'election', 'W', 'favor', 'watch', 'Fox', 'election', 'then', 'see', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'fall', 'step', 'several', 'minutes', 'later', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'say', 'allowing', 'Florida', 'recount', 'proceed', 'would', 'do', 'harm', 'Bush', 'presumptive', 'winner', 'not', 'standing', 'up', 'Fox', 'more', 'legitimate', 'news', 'organizations', 'have', 'done', 'doing', 'disservice', 'country', 'will', 'take', 'years', 'atone.The', 'dvd', 'also', 'trailer', 'Uncovered', '29-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette']",N/A
833168,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0002HDXTQ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Note when this was made (2004). Not surprisingly, it painted a pretty gloomy picture of getting any kind of ""Fair & Balanced"" reporting out of Fox News. The focus was on the political campaign, how Kerry was treated so badly, and how Bush was very bluntly favored. Distortions and lies, not fair and balanced. But this is old news: if you look at Fox News in 2012 (have Pepto Bismal on hand), you will quickly conclude it has not gotten any better.Why? The movie itself suggests one important reason. There are several polls quoted where facts -- real, verifiable facts -- were presented to a variety of radio and TV customers. The difference between the knowledge of these facts among Fox News consumers and PBS/NPR consumers was horrible. Not only are Fox customers fed lies, but they believe them. Propaganda techniques developed by the Nazis and the Soviets are in full force at Fox. Rupert Murdoch is . . . well, I can't think of the proper word. A liar is too soft a term; a brainwasher is closer to the mark.Fortunately, several useful web sites are noted toward the end.

It succeeds in showing that Fox News viewers are more likely to believe Bush Administration misinformation about Iraq than listeners to liberal-slanted NPR.  It even succeeds in showing that Fox News overall is biased in favor of Republicans.""Outfoxed"" fails overall, however.  Berating Fox for failing to be Fair and Balanced, this ""documentary"" offers no kind of balance whatsoever.  It is filled with one-sided rants by left-of-center commentators and neo-Stalinists like Bernie Sanders who want the government to control the content of media.Outrageously, the filmmakers close by urging viewers to contact the FCC and demand that they censor or shut down Fox News (in the name of the ""Fairness Doctrine"").  Instead of succombing to their left-wing totalitarian impulses, the filmmakers could have suggested that people voluntarily stop watching Fox.  There's ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, NPR -- all controlled by liberals.  Plus, at the same time obnoxious conservatives O'Reilly and Hannity are on, there's obnoxious liberals Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews.  And then there's Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, whose Comedy Central faux news shows mock Fox News and conservatives in general.  But all theose choices are not good enough for the neo-Stalinists who want to shut down the one news outlet that fails to echo their worldview.Most of the charges levelled against Fox could just as easily have been levelled against other news organizations if only the filmmakers had thought to be fair and balanced in their presentation.  They absurdly tried to show that Fox newscasters are biased because they say ""some people say"" a lot.  The kind of sophomorish and dishonest propaganda methods this DVD relies upon includes gathering random ""some people say"" soundbites and insinuating that they are code words for opinions Fox reporters want to get across when it's clear even from the limited context we are presented with that ""some people say"" is a device often used to bring in contrary opinions of various perspectives into a discussion.I'll grant that Fox is controlled disproportionately by Republicans.  Viewers of this DVD might be likely to conclude then that the media is not disproportionately Democrat.  In fact, nearly 9 out of 10 Washington political reporters are Democrats.  But the filmmakers don't think you need to know that bit of fair and balanced information.Fox News may help spread lies about Iraq, but the Democrat-dominated media establishment (see preceding paragraph) misleads Americans about all kind of issues, especially related to economics and race.I'd bet consumers of NPR, CNN, and New York Times are more likely to believe in the imaginary Social Security trust fund than Fox News, Wall Street Journal, Rush Limbaugh consumers.  Social Security is slowly bankrupting this country, but most Americans, even those who pay attention to ""the news"" are unaware of the extent of the crisis we face by failing to reform and restrain this runaway liberal program (i.e., doubling of tax rates, collapsing economy within 30-35 years).The liberal dominated media constantly try to dig up examples of ""discrimination"" and ""hate"" against ""minorities"" -- leading most Americans to believe the opposite of what is true about race in America.  Fact: Blacks commit more ""hate crimes"" against whites than vice versa, according to Department of Justice statistics.  Moreover, black on white crime overall is about 20 times more prevalent than white on black crime.  But we'll never hear from the media about the urgent need to ""close the crime gap"" in America.  While the media cheer on in the name of ""civil rights"" multi-million dollar lawsuits when a black customer claims to get bad service at a restaurant, they ignore instances where whites are systematically discriminated against by the thousands every day at colleges, government agencies, and corporations across the country in the name of ""diversity.""  So who bears the brunt of racial violence and institutionalized racism in America?  The liberal media will never admit the glaringly obvious truth.The point is that everyone has an agenda and a set of assumptions and will try to distort the facts to fit their worldview.  Fox News, for all its biases, adds to the diversity of opinion in news media, which is not the kind of ""diversity"" leftists can stomach.

833171,A2ONF6ZDGZOM5G,B0002HDXTQ,"Boetius ""Vlad""","[14, 64]","So let's see; every news outlet, every one - ABC, CBS, NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, CNN Headline News, CNN International - except Fox, pushes the liberal line.  Don't believe me?  A recent report by an objective study group concluded that 77% of the news coverage on these networks favored the Democratic party in the last election cycle.  The liberal bias of the news media is an objective fact that only an ideologue or someone who just doesn't want to come to grips with reality can deny.So here comes Fox into this liberal landscape and, omigod, they actually attempt to present the other side in a reasonably fair and balanced format, and the left can't stand it (because after all, when the liberal agenda is offered to the American people in an open honest way, they always - since 1964 anyway - turn it down).  So they on this DVD rant and they call people names and they rant and they moan and they hold their breaths and stamp their little feet about how ""unfair"" it all is. But it wasn't Fox, that had to issue repeated apologies for politically-motivated misinformation, it was the liberal icon, the New York Times.  It wasn't Fox that had to fire an anchorman - one supposedly a journalistic ""statesman"" lol - for presenting an obviously fabricated story, and then attempting to defend it by arguing that even if the particulars of the story were forgeries, it was true nonetheless (how he knew that is elusive, must be his superior leftist intuition).The real problem for the elite media with Fox news is not that it is so unfair, fairness has never been much of a value for the them - and this DVD does NOT make much of an objective case in that direction - but that it is so popular, and that the reason it is popular is that is represents most American's actual perceptions and values.  Reality check, what the DVD fails to address is the fact the elite media excites very little respect and even evokes contempt from most Americans, which is why its extreme attempts to influence elections - whether through slanted stories, misinformation, or other illegitimate techniques - have fallen flat for decades, and why more and more people keep turning to Fox news.This DVD is therefore little more than just one more attempt by the elite media and its overpaid and generally ignorant (ever seen the CNN reporters on Jeopardy? Pretty embarrassing.) commentators, researchers, and talking heads to assert their authority.  Because it is largely based upon paranoid half-truths, it naturally falls flat.

Given that and that I come from a perspective of general agreement that Fox is the antithesis of journalistic integrity, I have to concede that in many ways this is not a very tight documentary and lacks in many ways, quality in production and coherence.- The thesis of the documentary is never quite clear. While it seems to be that Fox News intentionally skews news to the right, the producers seem unable from avoiding wandering down paths such as pointing out that Fox is bad to its employees, that corporate control of the media is bad, and that Rupert Murdoch owns a huge media empire (including holdings in China).- There is no real active voice in the documentary (ie. no Michael Moore voice-over to guide you down a line of thought). Instead, a group of interviewee soundbites are clustered into categories of thought such as &quot;Political Punditry&quot; and &quot;Some People Say.&quot; Within these categories, there is inconsistencies of thought and logic which makes it hard to understand the point the film is making.- The documentary takes some detours down some silly avenues which do not necessarily add to the thesis of the film. For example, an effective portion demonstrating a method which Fox anchors use to inject personal political opinion (&quot;Some People Say&quot;) is followed by a segment dedicated to showing all the times that Bill O'Reilly has said &quot;shut up.&quot; This is the exemplar of how the film alternates between illuminating points and simply demonstrating what we already know (ie. conservative commentators as a class skew towards the obnoxious end of the spectrum).- The interviewees are definitely of mixed caliber. They range from FAIR media and blogger types to former Fox employees to semi-celebrities including Al Franken and Walter Cronkite. The only elected official was Bernie Sanders. In the aggregate, they all were pretty far on the left. Some made good points; others less so. The best were when they stuck to investigating the thesis that Fox intentionally skews news to the right; the worst were when they cut loose on corporate ownership of the media.- The graphics and production were just not professional. The graphics looked like they were produced on powerpoint.- The conclusion of the documentary (&quot;the call the action&quot;) is not articulated in a coherent manner. Rather, interviewees list possible solutions including &quot;visiting the FCC&quot; and &quot;writing to Fox News affiliates.&quot; I suppose this may run counter to my original notion that the best way to silence idiocy is to ignore it, not to disallow it.I gave the documentary 3 stars because I thought it tackled an important and timely subject. As I mentioned above, I am in agreement with what the filmmakers are trying to say and truly wish I could have given it better rating. I hope that in the months to come, we will see tighter, more polished documentaries tackling this subject matter.",3,"An Interesting, but Ultimately Flawed Documentary",1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,3109,"['reviewing', 'DVD', 'subject', 'matter', 'hard', 'divorce', 'one', 'critique', 'movie', 'basic', 'agreement', 'disagreement', 'subject', 'matter', 'Given', 'come', 'perspective', 'general', 'agreement', 'Fox', 'antithesis', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'have', 'concede', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'very', 'tight', 'documentary', 'lacks', 'many', 'ways', 'quality', 'production', 'coherence.-', 'thesis', 'documentary', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'be', 'Fox', 'News', 'intentionally', 'news', 'right', 'producers', 'seem', 'unable', 'avoiding', 'wandering', 'down', 'paths', 'such', 'pointing', 'out', 'Fox', 'bad', 'employees', 'corporate', 'control', 'media', 'bad', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'huge', 'media', 'empire', 'including', 'holdings', 'China', '.-', 'real', 'active', 'voice', 'documentary', 'ie', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'voice-over', 'guide', 'down', 'line', 'thought', 'Instead', 'group', 'interviewee', 'soundbites', 'are', 'clustered', 'categories', 'thought', 'such', 'quot', 'Political', 'Punditry', 'quot', 'quot', 'People', 'Say.', 'quot', 'categories', 'inconsistencies', 'thought', 'logic', 'hard', 'understand', 'point', 'film', 'making.-', 'documentary', 'detours', 'down', 'silly', 'avenues', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'add', 'thesis', 'film', 'example', 'effective', 'portion', 'demonstrating', 'method', 'Fox', 'anchors', 'use', 'inject', 'personal', 'political', 'opinion', 'quot', 'People', 'Say', 'quot', 'followed', 'segment', 'dedicated', 'showing', 'times', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'said', 'quot', 'up.', 'quot', 'exemplar', 'how', 'film', 'illuminating', 'points', 'simply', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'ie', 'conservative', 'commentators', 'class', 'skew', 'obnoxious', 'end', 'spectrum', '.-', 'interviewees', 'are', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'caliber', 'range', 'FAIR', 'media', 'blogger', 'types', 'former', 'Fox', 'employees', 'semi-celebrities', 'including', 'Al', 'Franken', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'only', 'elected', 'official', 'was', 'Bernie', 'Sanders', 'aggregate', 'were', 'pretty', 'far', 'left', 'made', 'good', 'points', 'others', 'less', 'so', 'best', 'were', 'when', 'stuck', 'investigating', 'thesis', 'Fox', 'intentionally', 'news', 'right', 'worst', 'were', 'when', 'cut', 'loose', 'corporate', 'ownership', 'media.-', 'graphics', 'production', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'professional', 'graphics', 'looked', 'were', 'produced', 'powerpoint.-', 'conclusion', 'documentary', 'quot', 'call', 'action', 'quot', 'not', 'articulated', 'coherent', 'manner', 'Rather', 'interviewees', 'list', 'possible', 'solutions', 'including', 'quot', 'visiting', 'FCC', 'quot', 'quot', 'writing', 'Fox', 'News', 'affiliates.', 'quot', 'suppose', 'may', 'run', 'counter', 'original', 'notion', 'best', 'way', 'silence', 'idiocy', 'ignore', 'not', 'disallow', 'it.I', 'gave', 'documentary', '3', 'stars', 'thought', 'tackled', 'important', 'timely', 'subject', 'mentioned', 'am', 'agreement', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'truly', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'rating', 'hope', 'months', 'come', 'will', 'see', 'tighter', 'more', 'polished', 'documentaries', 'tackling', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A

It demonstrates how Robert Murdoch, a right wing business tycoon from Australia, brought in Republican strategist Roger Ailes to head Fox News. From there it has basically served as a mouthpiece for the conservative Republican agenda. For example, this documentary shows how closely Fox News adheres to the talking points put out by the W Bush White House, including such ridiculous efforts as the attempt to depict John Kerry as being like a French person.Of course, there is also alot of coverage of the notorious Bill O'Reilly, who uses bully boy tactics and outright lies to intimidate his guests and deceive his listeners. Another example of bias is the ""Hannity and Colmes"" show, where the handsome, articulate, ""jock"" conservative, Sean Hannity, typically overwhelms his goofy, mealy mouthed, ""nerd"" liberal counterpart, Alan Colmes. Colmes may be sincere when expressing his liberal views. But he is also clearly being used as a ""plant"" by Fox, an example of ""weak and timid"" liberalism being easily defeated by ""strong and aggressive"" conservatism.Fox is certainly entitled to express its viewpoints. But the disturbing aspect is that it doesn't admit that its ""news"" is based only on opinion and commentary. But rather claims to be offering real journalism, with its infamous ""Fair and Balanced"" tagline being the biggest lie of all. This is especially troubling because journalism, as the ""Fourth Estate"" of democracy, is neeeded to serve the vital role of being the investigator of facts, providing a necessary check on the flaws and excesses of government and big business.

They also would invite people on their shows just to verbally attack them and try to make them look stupid not to hear the interviewee's opinion. This DVD talks to people that had worked for Fox News early on to show how they pushed the reporters to spin things a certain way and repeat things over and over i/e John Kerry as a flip flopper when he was running against Bush for Presidency. It also has an interview with Walter Cronkite which he stated the sad state of affairs in media with Fox at the helm.I was completely disgusted after I watched this documentary that this can go on in America. Fox news is not a news organization it is basically a propaganda machine for the extreme right wing. The thing that made me more sad was when all of the other news channels fell inline with Fox which made me untrusting of all American media outlets.

833185,A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ,B0002HDXTQ,"Darth Mortis ""Dark Lord of the Sith""","[4, 5]","This is a documentary on the skewed views and reporting of Fox News, plain and simple. The creators have former guests of the O'Reilly Factor and former employees of Fox News that they interview. They provide footage and news clips that show examples of paradoxes in their reporting. None of it really came as a surprise and other reviewers have gone in-depth in regards to the exact content of the DVD, so I won't repeat that here.What I will do is comment on the villainizing of Fox News. First of all, most, if not all major networks are lopsided and politically affiliated. MSNBC is a prime example, and in my opinion, just as extreme only on the liberal side instead of conservative side. The important thing to remember is that the executives of both stations are giving their audiences exactly what they want. I can't fault them for that. A heavy liberal population watches MSNBC, so they are tailoring their reporting to their audience and Fox News has done the same. The documentary discusses how out of control Bill O'Reilly is (which is true at times, that's probably why people watch him), but, in my own observations, Keith Olbermann on MSNBC is just as extreme (again, probably why people watch him too). These are businesses and pretty much every business out there tailors their services and products to their audience.During the election of 2008, I had a little bit of fun switching back and forth between Olbermann and O'Reilly. On that particular night, they were discussing the same thing. If I had been an unknowing observer and watched only Olbermann, I would have despised Senator McCain. If, in the same situation, I had only watched O'Reilly, I would have despised now President Obama. Both men are extremely passionate and are really good at what they do.I don't get my news from either station. If you don't want skewed or incomplete news, I would recommend that you do the same. A lot of people complain about skewed media. The nice thing about a remote control is that if you don't like what is on, you can change the channel. There are news sources out there that are far more neutral, like PBS.Though I don't condone false reporting (like paying someone who is supposedly of the opposing opinion to agree with you) or misrepresentation (or the horrible treatment of guests who give an opposing opinion), these news stations are reporting to populations who specifically want to hear what they have to say, so they are giving them what they want. Very few people are tuning in to Fox or MSNBC to have their opinions changed, they want them confirmed. In those cases, they are getting what they want.

Those who already know Fox is biased will see it and love it.  Those who think it's all a joke, will never see it and still talk crap about it.  The ones in the middle, who really don't have an opinion, won't see it, which is sad because it probably effects them the most.OUTFOXED is another of the documentaries making waves this summer as the new life for the genre continues to push on.  It isn't as polished as Fahrenheit of Fog of War, but it is still well done.  There are some very good points made within the film that should be a cause for discussion amoung friends.It's easy to see Fox is very biased, if not by the polls that show those who want Fox News are less likely to know the actual news than those who watch PBS.  To attack the film by saying that the other news networks are biased is to miss the point.  The news media in America is way too involved with the people who run the country.  It's part of the new America, where if you disagree, you  are unpatriotic.All in all, the film is well done.  And like every documentary nothing it say should be taken as 100% fact.  The purpose of a documentary is to give ideas.  It is up to the viewer to go outside the fox and further look into the ideas presented within the film.

833188,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0002HDXTQ,Dennis Littrell,"[10, 12]","Robert Greenwald, who directed the scathing documentary Uncovered: The Whole Truth about the Iraq War (2003) in which he demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt that the Bush administration repeatedly lied to the American people as it manipulated the Press and the Congress to get them to support its invasion of Iraq, now takes dead aim at one of Bush's most staunch supporters, media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Using the same technique that worked so well in ""Uncovered,"" Greenwald plays clips from Murdoch's Fox News to show that Fox News is anything but ""fair and balanced.""  From the clips of Bill O'Reilly verbally abusing his ""guests"" and telling them to ""shut up"" to Brit Hume mouthing the Republican Party line in the guise of objective journalism to slanted stories directed from above (that would be from Mr. Murdoch himself in some cases, like some worshipful filler about Ronald Reagan or some non-news from Bush's standard stump speech) to the daily email directives telling the staff at Fox News how to slant today's selected  stories--from the glitz and the directive music and the flags in the background to the character assassinations of Republican opponents, to the ""feel good"" misinformation about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Greenwald shows that Fox News stands for propaganda, spoon fed to the American masses.Interspersed with the clips are sound bites from ex-Fox employees (some of them with their voices and faces disguised or hidden for fear of reprisals from Fox) and media experts and even some progressive politicians.  From the employees we get a glimpse of the stifling Fox News ""culture"" that subtly but unmistakably requires everyone on staff to slant the news as directed or find work some place else. What emerges is a portrait of a media empire that is dead set on destroying journalism as we know it.  And that's the way Murdoch wants it.  He wants to control events through the power of the media, to stifle contrary opinion and to keep the masses in couch potato ignorance.Thus there is a specter haunting the American democracy, and that specter is media control by anti-democratic corporations.  It is not just arch-conservative Rupert Murdoch and his vast media empire, it is CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, etc. that are becoming more and directed from above, and more and more divorced from actual reportage in favor of the kind of spin and slant that pleases the corporate heads.  Even National Public Radio is coming under greater and greater corporate influence and control.What's to be done?We must elect public officials that will prevent the consolidation of media.  If we don't, those who own the media will soon own the government.  The airwaves belong to everyone.  No one should have a monopoly on their use.  Traditionally the media has served as ""the Fourth Estate,"" a watchdog on government.  More and more it has abdicated that responsibility because its purse strings are controlled by its corporate sponsors.  In the case of Murdoch, more and more media is falling under the control of a single ideology.  Can a fascist state be far behind?I am not panicking yet.  The Democrats saw what can happen when the other side controls most of the media (almost all of it, actually), and fiscal conservatives are learning that social conservatives may not be their best allies, especially faith-based evangelicals whose first order of business is a return to ignorance and superstition on the way to establishing a theocracy in the United States like something out of Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale.""  As the mass mind becomes more and more dumbed down and indoctrinated into mindless consumerism while being massaged by a dictatorial media, greater and greater grows the threat to democracy.The real test will come after Bush is out of office.  The next administration must take steps to break up ClearChannel, etc., and prevent the further consolidation of Murdoch's empire.  The airwaves must be a public utility because to control media in the modern society is ultimately to control elections.This documentary is a clarion call to wake up and smell the newsprint because if Murdoch has his way there will only be the comic page and Murdoch-slanted news stories, editorials and canned opinion.",5,"On the growing threat from managed ""news""",1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,4248,"['Robert', 'Greenwald', 'who', 'directed', 'scathing', 'documentary', 'Uncovered', 'Whole', 'Truth', 'Iraq', 'War', '2003', 'demonstrated', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'Bush', 'administration', 'repeatedly', 'lied', 'American', 'people', 'manipulated', 'Press', 'Congress', 'get', 'support', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'now', 'dead', 'aim', 'one', 'Bush', 'most', 'staunch', 'supporters', 'media', 'mogul', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch.Using', 'same', 'technique', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Uncovered', 'Greenwald', 'clips', 'Murdoch', 'Fox', 'News', 'show', 'Fox', 'News', 'anything', 'fair', 'balanced', 'clips', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'verbally', 'abusing', 'guests', 'telling', 'shut', 'up', 'Brit', 'Hume', 'mouthing', 'Republican', 'Party', 'line', 'guise', 'objective', 'journalism', 'slanted', 'stories', 'directed', 'would', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Murdoch', 'cases', 'worshipful', 'filler', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'non-news', 'Bush', 'standard', 'stump', 'speech', 'daily', 'email', 'directives', 'telling', 'staff', 'Fox', 'News', 'how', 'slant', 'today', 'selected', 'stories', 'glitz', 'directive', 'music', 'flags', 'background', 'character', 'assassinations', 'Republican', 'opponents', 'feel', 'good', 'misinformation', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Greenwald', 'Fox', 'News', 'propaganda', 'spoon', 'fed', 'American', 'masses.Interspersed', 'clips', 'are', 'sound', 'bites', 'ex-Fox', 'employees', 'voices', 'disguised', 'hidden', 'fear', 'reprisals', 'Fox', 'media', 'experts', 'even', 'progressive', 'politicians', 'employees', 'get', 'glimpse', 'stifling', 'Fox', 'News', 'culture', 'subtly', 'unmistakably', 'everyone', 'staff', 'slant', 'news', 'directed', 'find', 'work', 'place', 'else', 'What', 'portrait', 'media', 'empire', 'dead', 'set', 'destroying', 'journalism', 'know', 'way', 'Murdoch', 'control', 'events', 'power', 'media', 'stifle', 'contrary', 'opinion', 'keep', 'masses', 'couch', 'potato', 'ignorance.Thus', 'specter', 'haunting', 'American', 'democracy', 'specter', 'media', 'control', 'anti-democratic', 'corporations', 'not', 'just', 'arch-conservative', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'vast', 'media', 'empire', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'CNN', 'etc', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'directed', 'more', 'more', 'divorced', 'actual', 'reportage', 'favor', 'kind', 'spin', 'slant', 'corporate', 'heads', 'Even', 'National', 'Public', 'Radio', 'coming', 'greater', 'greater', 'corporate', 'influence', 'control.What', 'be', 'done', 'must', 'elect', 'public', 'officials', 'will', 'prevent', 'consolidation', 'media', 'do', ""n't"", 'who', 'own', 'media', 'will', 'soon', 'own', 'government', 'airwaves', 'belong', 'everyone', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'monopoly', 'use', 'Traditionally', 'media', 'served', 'Fourth', 'Estate', 'watchdog', 'government', 'More', 'more', 'abdicated', 'responsibility', 'purse', 'strings', 'are', 'controlled', 'corporate', 'sponsors', 'case', 'Murdoch', 'more', 'more', 'media', 'falling', 'control', 'single', 'ideology', 'Can', 'fascist', 'state', 'be', 'far', 'am', 'not', 'panicking', 'yet', 'Democrats', 'saw', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'other', 'side', 'most', 'media', 'almost', 'actually', 'fiscal', 'conservatives', 'are', 'learning', 'social', 'conservatives', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'allies', 'especially', 'faith-based', 'evangelicals', 'first', 'order', 'business', 'return', 'ignorance', 'superstition', 'way', 'establishing', 'theocracy', 'United', 'States', 'something', 'Margaret', 'Atwood', 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'mass', 'mind', 'more', 'more', 'dumbed', 'indoctrinated', 'mindless', 'consumerism', 'being', 'massaged', 'dictatorial', 'media', 'greater', 'greater', 'threat', 'democracy.The', 'real', 'test', 'will', 'come', 'Bush', 'office', 'next', 'administration', 'must', 'take', 'steps', 'break', 'up', 'ClearChannel', 'etc.', 'prevent', 'further', 'consolidation', 'Murdoch', 'empire', 'airwaves', 'must', 'be', 'public', 'utility', 'control', 'media', 'modern', 'society', 'ultimately', 'control', 'elections.This', 'documentary', 'clarion', 'call', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'newsprint', 'Murdoch', 'way', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'comic', 'page', 'Murdoch-slanted', 'news', 'stories', 'editorials', 'canned', 'opinion']",N/A

We are shown numerous brief clips from Fox News, all of which demonstrate Fox newscasters to be vacuous and one-sided at best, vicious and deceitful at worst. However, the news clips and interviews with various journalists are virtually all we get; there is almost no narration. This means we get little context for why Fox is so popular, why Murdoch has chosen this brand of ""journalism"", and why other media outlets have done little or nothing to counter it. We also hear almost nothing about the rest of the Murdoch ""news"" empire, such as the newspapers and radio stations it encompasses. The biggest flaw of this documentary, however, is that it probably preaches to the converted. It's doubtful that current Fox devotees will be swayed by its message, even if they bother to watch it.On the positive side, the film is entertaining, and its message is well-organized.

833190,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B0002HDXTQ,Derek G,"[61, 67]","First, an admission. The Fox News phenomenon is rather new to me. I haven't watched TV news in years, preferring to sift through the newspaper or the best I could find online from sources like Reuters and Associated Press. For me, the reason, outside of the annoying increase in commercials, was the endless parade of, &quot;woe is me because the government ain't taking care of me&quot; stories. Outside of headlines of the day, practically every &quot;focus&quot; story on the major networks had a definite left-wing bent. I couldn't stand the overriding feeling that I constantly was being told how I should think, or more accurately, that I shouldn't think at all. So I tuned out - and missed Fox's rise to fame or, I suppose I should say, notoriety.How surprised was I to skim through the channels and discover this upstart news channel that wasn't, well, boring! Flashy graphics, hot news babes and, best of all, people who weren't afraid to mix it up with their guests. No more pandering and slobbering on the mic (Larry King) to get a guest. If you started mouthing off, getting off track, or just being an idiot in general, they would flat-out tell you to shut up (O'Reilly). Sure, there was a definite right-wing slant, you'd have to be a moron not to realize that. Some are so far right they may have fallen off (Hannity). I didn't care. I was hooked! Then, slowly, after a couple of months of viewing, I started realizing something.Those on the right never, ever, lose.This was already in the back of my mind, but it never became clearer than at Fox's recent coverage of the Democratic Convention. Here sits Hannity with a stack of prepared talking points and reference notes while the supposed liberal, Colmes, has a post-it note or two containing some hastily scrawled handwriting. Colmes mutters something about not being ashamed to be a liberal. Hannity then proceeds to eviscerate not only Colmes, but three democratic pundits simultaneously. Sorry folks, but even at their own convention, the dems just couldn't compete.There's a reason why, and it's why you should watch Outfoxed.Outfoxed goes much deeper into the psyche of Fox News than just the flashy graphics and the right-wing agenda. Among the movie's claims, interviews appear to be legitimate or objective, while the graphics and headers on the bottom third of the screen often contain opinionated headlines. Off the cuff remarks are encouraged and any promoting the republican agenda or discrediting the democrats will get you the &quot;atta boy&quot; after the segment ends. Many internal memos obtained, while not necessarily incriminating, do reveal a definite agenda reporters needed to use on stories or when talking to guests.Even more interesting is Fox's use of the term, &quot;Some people say...&quot; While other journalists may say this in order to advance a storyline without revealing the source of the information. Fox uses the term liberally, (pardon the pun), so their reporters can insert political opinion instead of remaining objective. Of course you can gather which side of the political spectrum these opinions fall. As one writer explains, it's not necessary that Fox wins an argument. They simply need to muddy the argument to keep the viewer in a state of confusion. This way the viewer is unable to make a decision one way or the other which, to Fox, is as good as a victory.Most interesting, however, are the numerous times that people with a liberal agenda are simply outmatched. Again, there's a reason for this. After 25 weeks of study of the guests appearing on Special Report (Brit Hume) in 2003, 83% of the guests were republicans. On top of this, the liberals appearing repeatedly on the channel are usually &quot;faux liberals&quot; that often agree with the conservative side after some debate. Real liberals are rarely seen, intelligent liberals are rarely invited, and the ones who did put up a good argument are usually not invited to return. Fair and balanced?Finally, numerous ex-Fox employees testify of the almost crushing conditions they experienced while working there. In one hilarious segment, ex anchor Jon du Pre relates how he was suspended because he was unable to find anyone outside of a few people and a class of fourth graders celebrating Ronald Reagan's 80th birthday at his presidential library.Other reviewers have complained this movie is as much a propaganda piece as the news channel they're attacking. Frankly, they're right. Repeatedly, conservative media outlets like Fox and Clear Channel are railed against in this movie. Strange how no complaints were made against Viacom and Infinity (owners of MTV and Howard Stern.) The testimonies of so-called anonymous employees contain little credibility in my view. And, once you consider the backers and financiers of this film, the timing of this release during an important election is certainly no coincidence. As one writer correctly states, the reason why our propaganda system is vastly superior to the old Soviet-style propaganda machine, is we don't realize we are constantly being manipulated.If you get past the spin to the left, you get to the main reason why I recommend this movie. This movie made me see that media concentration is a worse problem than even I originally realized (and I consider myself a cynic and skeptic by nature.) I certainly don't want my news filtered by Murdoch any more than I want it filtered by Soros. Regardless of which side of the political spectrum you are on, the FCC's relaxation of limits on media ownership severely limits the information you receive, not to mention the quality of the information, so that you may form an objective opinion. How can you do this when independent publications keep getting silenced?Ok, I gotta run, Laurie Dhue's on.

It will either be ""preaching to the choir""  or ""liberal, left-wing lies,"" depending on the degree they hold fast to an opinion, despite evidence to the contrary. In short, they'll learn nothing because they already know ""the truth."" I've watched Fox News occasionally and simply find it less compelling and less professional than many alternatives.  It comes across like a tabloid versus, say, a well-put-together show like 60 Minutes. But, then, there are too many talking heads trying to fill too many hours of news programming. (We need more Walter Cronkite types and less news readers, who are often loyal to their employer's cause, whatever that might be.) So, we know Murdoch is conservative, that he has far too many media companies, that he has manipulated his empire to push a subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, agenda.  We know Bill O'Reilly is just a modern version of Joe Pyne and other loud-mouthed, opinionated, rude hosts. We know Sean Hannity is the attractive, preppy-looking one who makes the conservative point thereby seem correct, and that Colmes is a strange and poor excuse for the liberal point of view. (How about matching a Hannity type with Bill Maher or Michael Moore, not because those guys are male model types but because they can think on their feet and articulate their point of view effectively.) We know, alas, that the entire Fox package is one massive spin zone, and that most spin-meisters proudly speak of how they DON'T SPIN. . .which, if you think about it, is a very clever spin unto itself.  So, why does Fox News bother me?  Because as more and more people watch it, take it as gospel, and fail to see the Murdoch machine behind the scenes, they lose the real news in favor of a non-stop editorial.  If any one guy or any one company is allowed to monopolize the media---a trend I hope is severely curtailed in the near future---then we must seek out whatever variety of news and reportage we can to try to get the truth, minus the hot air.  (Watching BBC News, for example, gives us a unique view of our events from another country's perspective, which isn't a bad thing.) I enjoyed this documentary, recognized that it has a point of view that is anti-Fox, and tend to agree with it more than not.

What I have a problem with; is PEOPLE LYING. ESPECIALLY THOSE TRUSTED TO ""REPORT"" THE NEWS, not CREATE IT as they see fit. Which FOX does EACH AND EVERY SINGLE DAY. Viewing any memo from someone named ""MOODY"" at FOX, will display the utter PATHOLOGICAL nature of their broadcasting. Sure, many people LOVE IT. It echoes all their beliefs that they acquired reading Newsweek, Time and (in some cases) listening to their pastor.This is such an important documentary because it performs something called: ""Investigative Journalism"". Here me out; even if it is slanted against FOX (which obviously it is), the time taken to review and scrutinize thousands of hours of FOX News and then report the findings and it's impact on society is a valid investigative activity. Something extremely rare, I think we can all agree?This documentary could have been better done, it is however really good and extremely important. I'm just glad somebody finally took the time to do this. The patterns are indeed, a little disturbing. Almost everyone can also agree, that they seem to be incredibly conservative, and utterly Pro-Bush. Doesn't this disturb anybody else?? We need alot more of these documentaries. It's not just FOX, though they are the only ones who have done it so well.So, the video: It does an excellent job in interviewing former employees, many of whom remained anonymous due to the  Confidentiality Agreements they signed with FOX, that bind them forever. And the repititious nature of their messages is basically highlighted, while past employees detail the way they were encouraged to do certain things, given the days message and script, who to attack and on what subjects, while other activities like investigative journalism into certain activities were condemned and sure to get you blackballed. Also talked about alot, is the disparity between the amount of liberals and conservatives interviewed, and their notoriety.The outright lying is not as exposed as I would have liked. There are so many instances, so many days, when I yell at the TV: ""That's NOT true and you know it!"" They DO know it, they are rewarded based on a merit system that lauds certain behaviour (like Bill O'Reilly) and fires others, like Jon Du Pre because they simply reported it instead of glamourizing the so-called ""Right"".There's no question, this is Important Journalism and EVERYONE should see it. And, if there IS a documentary about the VAST LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY, you should see that one too and then compare notes. That idea alone (it seems) has been totally forgotten (how many people watched F-heit 911 and THEN: F-HYPE 911??).

The poll found that 80% of people who got their news from Fox had at least one major misconception about the war in Iraq, compared to 23% for PBS.  Comically, the study also found that people became more confused the more they paid attention to Fox.  So if you have to turn on Fox News, at least try to ignore it.To be fair (and balanced), the results of the poll didn't prove that Fox is actively trying to spread misinformation.  Defenders of Fox were quick to point out the theoretical possibility that people who are naturally confused are more drawn to Fox (possibly for its excellent coverage of car chases and animal attacks).And that's why Outfoxed is a valuable piece of journalism.  As many other people have pointed out, it's fairly obvious to any knowledgeable person that Fox slants their broadcasts to favor whatever nutty thing the Republican Party decides to do.  But Outfoxed gives us a glimpse of how the whole process works, including memos issued by the News Director and interviews with ex-employees of Fox News.  It's no longer possible to argue that Fox just happens to have greater appeal among clueless viewers.  On the contrary, Fox's propaganda is actively making people dumber.

It would be difficult to answer these questions without considerable scientific research, since one would have to find appropriate definitions of ""liberal bias"" and also appropriate measures of social dissatisfaction.""Some people say"" (no pun intended here) that this documentary was put together by those who are jealous of the monetary success of Fox News. This may be true, but the intentions and motivations of the producers of this work do not have any relevance to the truth of the content of it. Their motivations should be left to another study. The only thing that is relevant when analyzing a work such as this is to find out whether its content is factual and whether it can be checked by a curious and independent investigator.The producers do make an effort to document the events that they believe sheds light on the inherent ""right-wing"" bias of Fox News. For example, the give several examples on how Bill O'Reilly has bullied some of his ""left-wing"" guests on his show. They also give statistical evidence on how many Republican guests appear on Fox News versus Democrats, with a definite preponderance towards the Republicans. In addition, they interview several former Fox News employees, some of them on-camera and some of them anonymous, in order to allow the viewer to gain insight on what it was like to work at Fox News.However, no examples are presented that serve to counter the claims of these individuals or other evidence presented. To those who strive for objective studies of the news media, the inclusion of such examples would have been helpful, and would make a stronger case for the objectivity of the work. One of the most difficult things to accomplish when analyzing social phenomena is to remain objective and present both sides of an issue, in order to give a fair and balanced (no pun intended) view of it.""Some people say"", including this reviewer, that Fox News is an organization that is reeking with jingoism and fervent religiosity, and seeks to bolster the view of extreme forms of conservative thought.

833202,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0002HDXTQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[14, 24]","It is an oversimplification to blame the Bush administration entirely for the sadly effective dismantling of our democratic processes. First, the editors of the nonpartisan Web site, [...] came out with a revealing book effectively dissecting the empire of media manipulation with ""All the President's Spin: George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truth"". Now filmmaker Robert Greenwald pinpoints one the most egregious perpetrators, examining the Fox Network's purported hypocrisy in the wholesale undermining of journalism for political purposes. With quite a team of fact finders and investigative reporters supporting him, Greenwald's documentary provides the viewer with a valuable primer on propaganda techniques, proving once again how the subversive goal of creating fear and uncertainty in the minds of viewers is achieved by use of language and repetition. It's very much the same point raised by George Lakoff in his amazing book, ""Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate--The Essential Guide for Progressives"". Here, Greenwald reserves his focus on one powerful man, Rupert Murdoch, and the media empire he has created. Through all the media outlets of his company, News Corp, he can reach a throat-catching 280 million people in the United States!While ""Outfoxed"" does present a fairly strong case against Murdoch and the Fox News Channel, so much information is presented with great haste, not allowing much time for a viewer to absorb Greenwald's findings. That's why DVD is the ideal format as some can simply pause when they start getting overwhelmed by the onslaught of facts, figures and testimonials by former Fox employees and even renowned newscasters such as Walter Cronkite. In fact, Cronkite says in the film that Murdoch never had any intention except to build a right-wing network, but that seems highly suspect given the aggressively posturing media stars that have risen since its debut. Unsurprisingly, Fox News' top host Sean Hannity comes across as an unmitigated bully, but Bill O'Reilly, arguably the network's biggest star, reveals himself in the film as someone with obvious issues around anger management and journalistic integrity. In what has to be the most revealing moment in the film, a son of a worker killed in the World Trade Center on 9/11 appears as a guest on O'Reilly's show, and he takes the host on and refuses to be intimidated by his insistent berating. When O'Reilly senses his leverage diminishing, he loses his temper, makes nasty accusations and then unprofessionally pulls the plug on his microphone. Fast and furious, this is no-hold-barred filmmaking. And unlike many other documentaries produced in a rush before the election, this one actually has legs afterward.

This was the man who once had his NY Post run a headline that said, ""Terror from the Sky."" No, it wasn't about 9/11. Back then it was about an air conditioner that fell from a ninth floor window.Some of the people interviewed for this video were former Fox employees. Some may have an agenda, but some may be revealing the truth about Fox's penchant for slanting the news to favor conservative views. As one of the interviewees charged, the liberal counterpoints they generally have on the air, were nobodies. Alan Combes, the supposed counterweight to Sean Hannity is like pitting the Washington Generals against the Harlem Globetrotters. (Guess who wins!) The video correctly intimates Hannity lacks the cohonas and wits to take on Michael Moore, Joe Conason, or an Al Frankel. (Hmmmm. Why did Hannity cancel that debate in Colorado with Michael Moore, anyway?) From what I have seen on Fox, the liberal counterpoints are no one I recognize.Greenwald cleverly creates clip after clip of Fox editorializing guests and news with comments like,""Some people say he's trying to sell a book."" Implication? Richard Clarke, who is particularly unkind to the Bush administration in his book ""Against All Enemies,"" was sacrificing truth for profit. Of course, Fox never got more specific about who the ""some people say"" were.Bill O'Reilly is also grist for Greenwald's mill demonstrating for anyone to see that Bill will say something on the air, and then deny it with pathological amnesia. His signature example was telling a viewer that he only told one person to shut up on the air. Naturally, it then shows Bill saying it several times demonstrating his  level of journalistic talent. In another example he tells a viewer that after we've gone to war, it's time to shut up and get behind the president. (Sorry, Billy. Someone once said that citizens have an obligation to criticize their government. Those who don't are treasonous in their silence [or words to that effect]. Unlike Fox, I'll mention his name. It was Theodore Roosevelt--a republican.)What scares me most is not this video or Fox network. It's the gullibility of Americans who rationalize the network's clear bias, but then scream propaganda if another network dares to say anything derogatory about a conservative no matter how accurate the story may be. I'm afraid for America if Americans desperately cling to their opinions, which they don't want distorted by the facts. This country will definitely fall from within. As for me, there is only so much rationalization on Fox's behalf I can take.If Americans believe what they hear from Fox is journalism and news, they can be made to believe anything.",5,A Fair and Balanced Review:  I write; you decide,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2788,"['Greenwald', 'picture', 'man', '[', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'possessed', 'right', 'wing', 'agenda', 'flair', 'sensationalism', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'NY', 'Post', 'run', 'headline', 'said', 'Terror', 'Sky', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', '9/11', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'air', 'conditioner', 'fell', 'ninth', 'floor', 'window.Some', 'people', 'interviewed', 'video', 'were', 'former', 'Fox', 'employees', 'may', 'have', 'agenda', 'may', 'be', 'revealing', 'truth', 'Fox', 'penchant', 'slanting', 'news', 'favor', 'conservative', 'views', 'one', 'interviewees', 'charged', 'liberal', 'counterpoints', 'generally', 'have', 'air', 'were', 'nobodies', 'Alan', 'Combes', 'supposed', 'counterweight', 'Sean', 'Hannity', 'pitting', 'Washington', 'Generals', 'Harlem', 'Globetrotters', 'Guess', 'who', 'video', 'correctly', 'Hannity', 'cohonas', 'take', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Joe', 'Conason', 'Al', 'Frankel', 'Hmmmm', 'Why', 'did', 'Hannity', 'cancel', 'debate', 'Colorado', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'anyway', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Fox', 'liberal', 'counterpoints', 'are', 'one', 'recognize.Greenwald', 'cleverly', 'creates', 'clip', 'clip', 'Fox', 'editorializing', 'guests', 'news', 'comments', 'people', 'say', 'trying', 'sell', 'book', 'Implication', 'Richard', 'Clarke', 'who', 'particularly', 'unkind', 'Bush', 'administration', 'book', 'Against', 'All', 'Enemies', 'was', 'sacrificing', 'truth', 'profit', 'course', 'Fox', 'never', 'got', 'more', 'specific', 'who', 'people', 'say', 'were.Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'also', 'grist', 'Greenwald', 'mill', 'demonstrating', 'anyone', 'see', 'Bill', 'will', 'say', 'something', 'air', 'then', 'deny', 'pathological', 'amnesia', 'signature', 'example', 'was', 'telling', 'viewer', 'only', 'told', 'one', 'person', 'shut', 'up', 'air', 'Naturally', 'then', 'Bill', 'saying', 'several', 'times', 'demonstrating', 'level', 'journalistic', 'talent', 'example', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'war', 'time', 'shut', 'up', 'get', 'president', 'Sorry', 'Billy', 'Someone', 'once', 'said', 'citizens', 'have', 'obligation', 'criticize', 'government', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'treasonous', 'silence', '[', 'words', 'effect', ']', 'Unlike', 'Fox', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'name', 'was', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'republican', 'What', 'most', 'not', 'video', 'Fox', 'network', 'gullibility', 'Americans', 'who', 'rationalize', 'network', 'clear', 'bias', 'then', 'scream', 'propaganda', 'network', 'say', 'anything', 'derogatory', 'conservative', 'matter', 'how', 'accurate', 'story', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'America', 'Americans', 'desperately', 'cling', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'distorted', 'facts', 'country', 'will', 'definitely', 'fall', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'rationalization', 'Fox', 'behalf', 'can', 'take.If', 'Americans', 'believe', 'what', 'hear', 'Fox', 'journalism', 'news', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'believe', 'anything']",N/A

The presentation is a little cheesy at the beginning when they talk about Rupert Murdoch; it was done in PowerPoint. In 1983 Rupert Murdoch brought a local TV station here in the States, now this was during the Republican National Convention, Rupert adored Reagan, Rupert literally wanted to show the dedication film for Reagen on TV, the producers were floored because this was GOP propaganda, so in 1996 Rupert Murdoch and Roger Alies created Fox News. The reporters (who decided to hold their names and identies) told the audience that the producers would get memo's from the top on what to talk about, and not to discredit the White House, or the Bush Administration. On Bill O'Reilly's show, he cursed out Jermery Glick; the son of the Port Authority worker who died on 9/11 for signing a petition against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, once the show was done Bill told him that he better get out of there before ""I rip you to f*cking pieces!"" One Fox reporter during the 2004 election (which again was stolen by the Bushieviks) compared John Kerry to Kim Jong-Il, the reporter said ""John Kerry is loved in North Korea."" Once the 9/11 Commission was formed, and Richard Clarke testified, and once he came out with his book about what really happened in Daddys administration, the Clinton Administration, and W's Administration, Clarke put all of the blame on W, then of course the White House went on the defensive and behind them was no other than Fox News. Fox declared Clarke a 'Liberal' (which he is a registered Republican), a 'Democrat', and a 'Kerry lover'.During a Congressional testimony, Rupert Murdoch said that there are Liberal commentators on Fox; there is Alan Colmes and Greta Van Housen. Now if you watch Hannity and Colmes, you see Sean Hannity is a clean-cut all-American guy, while you look at Colmes and you see a man that looks like a mouse; people see the show and think 'He's the Liberal?

833207,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B0002HDXTQ,Erik North,"[17, 19]","We have something in this great country of ours called the Media.  It acts as something of a Fourth Estate, after the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of our government.  But in recent years, the integrity of that Fourth Estate has been undercut by the agenda of a man named Rupert Murdoch, and a media outlet called the Fox News Channel.  And this is at the heart of Robert Greenwald's documentary OUTFOXED, which takes a look at the warping of our media by the first-ever cable news channel to clearly propagate a one-world viewpoint, one slanted very far to the right.Utilizing interviews with various former employees of the Fox News Channel, which, when it started in 1996, resembled in many ways Ted Turner's CNN at its 1980 start, OUTFOXED shows how Murdoch, who isn't even an American to begin with but was shown to be a fervent admirer of Ronald Reagan, began slowly but surely to undercut the media's ability to report on news stories accurately and with clear thinking in mind.  Bit by bit, it grew into a mega-media outlet with the power to influence people big time.  In every way possible, it became a television mouthpiece for the far right in America--a perfect example of 24-hour corporate cable fascism, where dissent was tantamount to treason, particularly after 9/11 and when it came to George W. Bush.Clip after clip after clip, we see the Fox News Channel's all-star lineup of blatant right-wing nutjobs--Bill O'Reilly; Brit Hume; Sean Hannity; Neil Cavuto--scathingly rip apart guests who disagree to any significant extent with them apart, while at the same time promoting their slogans of ""Fair And Balanced"" and ""We Report, You Decide""--slogans which over time have clearly been shown, to say the least, blatantly untruthful.  And what is made dreadfully clear, especially in the clips of the FNC's ""reporting"" during the 2004 presidential election is of their certainity that Bush/Cheney were going to win, complete with the cheerleading.But apart from all this, OUTFOXED also says that the real sad thing is how other cable outlets have had to somehow use other TV personalities with right-wing proclivities to somehow ""outfox"" Fox, which is for all intents and purposes impossible.  This is a film as every bit as infuriating as FAHRENHEIT 9/11 was, if at a more sober key, and a very tragic commentary on how our system of government has allowed a Fox named Rupert Murdoch, and his cast of right-wingers, to run the henhouse that is the United States of America.But OUTFOXED also suggests that public outrage can bring about the change needed to stop other Rupert Murdoch types from hijacking America.

833208,A111BH1GN0D33Z,B0002HDXTQ,Folantin,"[5, 7]","I'll admit that I've never been a fan of FOX news. The few times I've watched it, I've been annoyed by its glossy, glitzy sensationalist approach to the news. Well, so much for that--I prefer to get my news via the internet. But the documentary OUTFOXED from director Robert Greenwald argues that FOX news is more than just a tacky news programme. According to the filmmaker, the FOX channel--owned by right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch--pipes propaganda into millions of homes throughout the world.The documentary includes many interviews from former FOX television employees--some left, some were sacked, and some were eased out. But they all have the same story--participate in the party line, or you're out. Internal FOX memos are shown detailing how presenters are prompted to play up certain events and kill other stories. Various media watchdogs also appear--including Peter Hart from Fairness and Accuracy on Reporting (FAIR)--and these interviewees analyze the techniques FOX applies to its programming. And these techniques range from dirty (smear campaigns), nasty, hate mongering, and intimidation (Bill O'Reilly) to downright tricky. One of the best portions of the film shows O'Reilly 'interviewing' Jeremy Glick, the son of a man killed on 9-11. When Glick dares to voice an opinion, O'Reilly rudely shouts down his guest, and then subsequent footage show how the guest's comments were horribly distorted over an 11-month period.According to the film, FOX news has its share in the responsibility of the fear mongering that took place in the build-up to the war. As part of a concerted Strategy of Tension, FOX hyped fears. After watching some of the footage, I was surprised the news presenters didn't sink to wearing gas masks while on air. In one segment, a former CIA agent--a guest on FOX--tells host Hannity that he's concerned that America may have problems with wars on two fronts--Iraq and Afghanistan. Hannity makes an inane comment and compares this situation to walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's obvious that the guest's comments are being managed (cut) in a way to limit his point.But when one considers the responsibility FOX should have to offer accurate and fair news reporting, it makes me wonder how some people responsible for this nonsense can sleep at night. In one sequence, there's a news snippet stating that it's safer for soldiers on the streets of Iraq than it is living in California. I would have laughed out loud at this rubbish if it weren't so disgusting. (Earth-to-FOX news--no one in California has been blown up by IEDs.) But what's particularly upsetting is that millions of people who watch this stuff don't seem to realize that FOX has ""eliminated journalism"" and has instead become a mouthpiece for right-wing propaganda. According to one interviewee, FOX audiences tend to have comparatively ""incorrect assumptions"" about some of the myths of the Iraq war when compared to PBS/NPR audiences.On the down side, FOX television aficionados probably won't get much out of this documentary--whereas those of us who chose to not watch FOX will be appalled. But perhaps watching this documentary will help some of us Non-FOX channel people understand where some of the hare-brained brainwashing comes from when our neighbours and workmates begin to spout their propaganda--displacedhuman",5,"""They want all news to be opinion because opinion can't be proven false.""",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,3350,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'FOX', 'news', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'ve"", 'been', 'annoyed', 'glossy', 'glitzy', 'sensationalist', 'approach', 'news', 'Well', 'so', 'much', 'prefer', 'get', 'news', 'internet', 'documentary', 'OUTFOXED', 'director', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'FOX', 'news', 'more', 'just', 'tacky', 'news', 'programme', 'According', 'filmmaker', 'FOX', 'channel', 'owned', 'right-wing', 'media', 'mogul', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'propaganda', 'millions', 'homes', 'world.The', 'documentary', 'many', 'interviews', 'former', 'FOX', 'television', 'employees', 'left', 'were', 'sacked', 'were', 'eased', 'out', 'have', 'same', 'story', 'participate', 'party', 'line', ""'re"", 'out', 'Internal', 'FOX', 'memos', 'are', 'shown', 'detailing', 'how', 'presenters', 'are', 'prompted', 'play', 'up', 'certain', 'events', 'kill', 'other', 'stories', 'Various', 'media', 'watchdogs', 'also', 'appear', 'including', 'Peter', 'Hart', 'Fairness', 'Accuracy', 'Reporting', 'FAIR', 'interviewees', 'analyze', 'techniques', 'FOX', 'programming', 'techniques', 'range', 'dirty', 'smear', 'campaigns', 'nasty', 'hate', 'mongering', 'intimidation', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'downright', 'tricky', 'One', 'best', 'portions', 'film', ""O'Reilly"", ""'interviewing"", 'Jeremy', 'Glick', 'son', 'man', 'killed', '9-11', 'When', 'Glick', 'voice', 'opinion', ""O'Reilly"", 'rudely', 'down', 'guest', 'then', 'subsequent', 'footage', 'show', 'how', 'guest', 'comments', 'were', 'horribly', 'distorted', '11-month', 'period.According', 'film', 'FOX', 'news', 'share', 'responsibility', 'fear', 'mongering', 'took', 'place', 'build-up', 'war', 'part', 'concerted', 'Strategy', 'Tension', 'FOX', 'hyped', 'fears', 'watching', 'footage', 'was', 'surprised', 'news', 'presenters', 'did', ""n't"", 'sink', 'wearing', 'gas', 'masks', 'air', 'one', 'segment', 'former', 'CIA', 'agent', 'guest', 'FOX', 'host', 'Hannity', 'concerned', 'America', 'may', 'have', 'problems', 'wars', 'two', 'fronts', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Hannity', 'inane', 'comment', 'situation', 'walking', 'chewing', 'gum', 'same', 'time', 'obvious', 'guest', 'comments', 'are', 'being', 'managed', 'cut', 'way', 'limit', 'point.But', 'when', 'one', 'responsibility', 'FOX', 'should', 'have', 'offer', 'accurate', 'fair', 'news', 'reporting', 'wonder', 'how', 'people', 'responsible', 'nonsense', 'can', 'sleep', 'night', 'one', 'sequence', 'news', 'snippet', 'stating', 'safer', 'soldiers', 'streets', 'Iraq', 'living', 'California', 'would', 'have', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'rubbish', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'disgusting', 'Earth-to-FOX', 'news', 'one', 'California', 'been', 'blown', 'up', 'IEDs', 'what', 'particularly', 'upsetting', 'millions', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'FOX', 'eliminated', 'journalism', 'instead', 'become', 'mouthpiece', 'right-wing', 'propaganda', 'According', 'one', 'interviewee', 'FOX', 'audiences', 'tend', 'have', 'comparatively', 'incorrect', 'assumptions', 'myths', 'Iraq', 'war', 'when', 'compared', 'PBS/NPR', 'audiences.On', 'down', 'side', 'FOX', 'television', 'aficionados', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'documentary', 'who', 'chose', 'not', 'watch', 'FOX', 'will', 'be', 'appalled', 'perhaps', 'watching', 'documentary', 'will', 'help', 'Non-FOX', 'channel', 'people', 'understand', 'where', 'hare-brained', 'brainwashing', 'when', 'neighbours', 'begin', 'spout', 'propaganda', 'displacedhuman']",N/A

833215,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B0002HDXTQ,Jay Young,"[4, 7]","""Outfoxed"" is at its best when carefully demonstrating how Fox News does indeed create a distorted picture of things. For example, the film demonstrates, through archival footage, how Fox encourages punditry. For instance, they point out that the liberal guests that come on regularly (Dick Morris, Susan Estrich) usually agree with Hannity and O'Reilly's main points. Further, the now-defunct Hannity & Colmes was flawed, as Hannity has this all-American appearance, and is always aggressive, whereas Colmes looked squirrely, and tended to back down easily. In addition, internal memos and interviews with former employees give strong evidence that Fox seeks to create a climate of fear- fear of terrorism, of immigrants, of religious minorities, etc.What weakened ""Outfoxed"" for me was that it didn't focus just on Fox News- it has an agenda of its own beside that. For example, almost all of the media experts interviewed were from the left media organization FAIR. They made valuable points, but it would have given the movie more credibility if other organizations were represented. Finally, toward the end, Bernie Sanders and others being interviewed appear to press for the Fairness Doctrine, which I think would create far more problems than it would solve.Overall, this is a good movie to rent as a corrective to the ""Fair and Balanced"" network.",3,"Valuable, But Take It With a Grain of Salt",1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1354,"['Outfoxed', 'best', 'when', 'carefully', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'Fox', 'News', 'indeed', 'create', 'distorted', 'picture', 'things', 'example', 'film', 'archival', 'footage', 'how', 'Fox', 'punditry', 'instance', 'point', 'out', 'liberal', 'guests', 'come', 'regularly', 'Dick', 'Morris', 'Susan', 'Estrich', 'usually', 'agree', 'Hannity', ""O'Reilly"", 'main', 'points', 'Further', 'now-defunct', 'Hannity', 'Colmes', 'was', 'flawed', 'Hannity', 'all-American', 'appearance', 'always', 'aggressive', 'whereas', 'Colmes', 'looked', 'squirrely', 'tended', 'back', 'down', 'easily', 'addition', 'internal', 'memos', 'interviews', 'former', 'employees', 'give', 'strong', 'evidence', 'Fox', 'create', 'climate', 'fear-', 'fear', 'terrorism', 'immigrants', 'religious', 'minorities', 'etc.What', 'weakened', 'Outfoxed', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'just', 'Fox', 'News-', 'agenda', 'own', 'beside', 'example', 'almost', 'media', 'experts', 'interviewed', 'were', 'left', 'media', 'organization', 'FAIR', 'made', 'valuable', 'points', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'more', 'credibility', 'other', 'organizations', 'were', 'represented', 'Finally', 'end', 'Bernie', 'Sanders', 'others', 'being', 'interviewed', 'appear', 'press', 'Fairness', 'Doctrine', 'think', 'would', 'create', 'far', 'more', 'problems', 'would', 'solve.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'rent', 'corrective', 'Fair', 'Balanced', 'network']",N/A

Even hardline supporters of this network have to admit Fox's &quot;We Report, You Decide&quot; and &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; taglines are nothing more than meaningless phrases at this point. Fox News does indeed have a clear agenda and has from the beginning. They're almost bragging about it. Right-wingers are probably happy about this which is not surprising.

As anyone who has ever spent even five minutes watching Fox News already knows, the channel is very biased.  This documentary does nothing more than show montages of biased clips (many of which may have been taken out of another context) and offers some rather shabbily edited interviews with former employess, some of whom didn't want to be named.Fox News is an appalling channel, but it's only ONE channel.  If people actually WANT to get the ""fair and balanced"" story, they are welcome to change the station.  Obviously many conservatives love to complain that every other channel has a liberal bias, so maybe the secret recipe for balanced news is to take one hour of CNN or ABC or what have you, add one hour of Fox News, let simmer, and serve.  Unfortunately this probably won't work, because the state of journalism is in such deploable decay that it's hard to find ANY channel where reporter's opinions and running commentary don't interrupt and color the broadcast on a regular basis, and talking heads have become a fixture on every channel, not just Fox.  This movie would have been a lot more ballsy if it had examined the shabby state of ALL news media outfits, instead of reserving all its venom for Fox.Overall this movie plays like a cheap shot, if only because it's so obviously cheaply made.  It reveals nothing illuminating about Fox News or the nature of corporate, profiteering journalism, and it seems to particularly have a vendetta against Bill O'Rielly, who is actually one of the few voices of ""reason"" on Fox News, for the most part.  I mean, he's a conservative and he doesn't care who knows it, but when compared to Sean Hannity or some of the other people they have slinging mud over at Fox, he's positively a pussy cat.  But for some reason he is made out to be the worst of the worst at Fox, and Hannity (who in my opinion is actually far more biased; facts just ROLL off the man like water on a duck) is given a pass.  Maybe the producers of this movie were wronged by O'Reilly in some previous life.It's really too bad that this movie is so shabbily put together, because it seems to be just another prime example of left-wing softballs that allow right-wingers who play hardball to keep getting away, quite literally, with murder.12/12/05 EDIT: Sorry folks, but my opinion on O'Reilly has undergone a change.

Naturally, a story like that runs counter to the Bush administration's right-wing antidrug policy.  So what do their footsoldier ""journalists"" (Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg and Co.) do when a story like that comes out?

833226,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002HDXTQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 12]","My initial reaction to ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"" was that the thesis of Robert Greenwald's 2004 documentary was not really news to anyone.  A television news network does not get to be ""Fair and Balanced"" by its own admission any more than I buy at face value the claims made by commercials with regards to products or politicians with regards to their candidacies.  FOX News wanted to be the most conservative news network on television and had a clear shot at the title from Day One.  The great irony here is how FOX News has established enough weight, by virtue of their ratings success, to have other news networks gravitate towards the right.So ""Outfoxed"" is not so much an expose of intentions that are obviously blatant as it is a catalogue of techniques employed by FOX News to further its political agenda.  This consists of not only on air tactics, such as confronting targets with what ""some say,"" but also management directives, such as the daily memos from corporate.  Greenwald mixes interviews with former employees of FOX News and other critics with a deluge of clips from its broadcasts.  If a directive comes down to push the idea that John Kerry looks ""French,"" then we get a half-dozen examples of that being done on the air.  The basic approach here is to let the talking heads of FOX News hang themselves with their own words (e.g., Brit Hume points out that a soldier in Iraq has less of chance of dying than a random citizen of California has of being murdered, ergo, it is apparently safer for young men in California to join the army than to do anything else).Another irony of ""Outfoxed"" is that Greenwald uses some of the same disparaged techniques employed by his subject, particularly in terms of using music to set the tone for our approbation.  But this could just be another way of giving the devil his due.  There are times when Greenwald is having so much fun with the style that it detracts a bit from the substance.  I also think that one obvious antecedent for the tone and tenor of FOX News is ignored, and that would be ""Crossfire,"" the celebrated CNN talking head show that I think is most responsible for bringing partisan incivility and outright rancor into the mainstream of television news.Ultimately the question with regards to ""Outfoxed"" is whether Murdoch's FOX News is preaching to the choir or actually converting the masses.  For example, there are some statistics showing that viewers who watch FOX News are several times more likely to hold specific beliefs in line with the position of the Bush Administration than those who watch the news on PBS.  I think that a large part of those numbers would fall in to the chicken and the egg category, which in this case would be conservatives and FOX News viewers respectively.  In other words, Murdoch is not so much creating conservatives as he is reinforcing their beliefs.  Granted, there must be some who are converted, but given the demonstrated bias of the network it is rather amazing that the figures supporting its positions are not even higher.The audience for ""Outfoxed"" is comparable to the electorate in 2004.  There will be those who will embrace it or dismiss it out of hand based on their ideological bent (and no doubt will write reviews accordingly), and clearly there are points where the attack can be considered hyperbolic (e.g, the idea that THE key factor in Bush's election was the decision of his cousin to have FOX News call Florida and the election, forcing the other networks to follow suit and establish the idea it was all over when it was really too close to tell).  But despite its attempt to retire fire in kind, ""Outfoxed"" is also informative in terms of detailing how Murdoch's organization comes about its business.  Whether this is a recipe for success or a sin against the canon of journalistic ethics will be up to the current generation of would-be journalists to decide.  Whatever else it may be, ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"" certainly raises questions worth discussing in the classroom.",4,"Not exactly news, but then that would be the point, right?",1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,4064,"['initial', 'reaction', 'Outfoxed', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'War', 'Journalism', 'was', 'thesis', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', '2004', 'documentary', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'news', 'anyone', 'television', 'news', 'network', 'not', 'get', 'be', 'Fair', 'Balanced', 'own', 'admission', 'more', 'buy', 'face', 'value', 'claims', 'made', 'commercials', 'regards', 'products', 'politicians', 'regards', 'candidacies', 'FOX', 'News', 'wanted', 'be', 'most', 'conservative', 'news', 'network', 'television', 'had', 'clear', 'shot', 'title', 'Day', 'One', 'great', 'irony', 'here', 'how', 'FOX', 'News', 'established', 'enough', 'weight', 'virtue', 'ratings', 'success', 'have', 'other', 'news', 'networks', 'gravitate', 'right.So', 'Outfoxed', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'expose', 'intentions', 'are', 'obviously', 'blatant', 'catalogue', 'techniques', 'employed', 'FOX', 'News', 'further', 'political', 'agenda', 'not', 'only', 'air', 'tactics', 'such', 'confronting', 'targets', 'what', 'say', 'also', 'management', 'directives', 'such', 'daily', 'memos', 'corporate', 'Greenwald', 'mixes', 'interviews', 'former', 'employees', 'FOX', 'News', 'other', 'critics', 'deluge', 'clips', 'broadcasts', 'directive', 'down', 'push', 'idea', 'John', 'Kerry', 'French', 'then', 'get', 'half-dozen', 'examples', 'being', 'done', 'air', 'basic', 'approach', 'here', 'let', 'talking', 'heads', 'FOX', 'News', 'hang', 'own', 'words', 'e.g.', 'Brit', 'Hume', 'out', 'soldier', 'Iraq', 'less', 'chance', 'dying', 'random', 'citizen', 'California', 'being', 'murdered', 'ergo', 'apparently', 'safer', 'young', 'men', 'California', 'join', 'army', 'do', 'anything', 'else', '.Another', 'irony', 'Outfoxed', 'Greenwald', 'same', 'disparaged', 'techniques', 'employed', 'subject', 'particularly', 'terms', 'using', 'music', 'set', 'tone', 'approbation', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'way', 'giving', 'devil', 'due', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Greenwald', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'style', 'bit', 'substance', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'obvious', 'antecedent', 'tone', 'tenor', 'FOX', 'News', 'ignored', 'would', 'be', 'Crossfire', 'celebrated', 'CNN', 'talking', 'head', 'show', 'think', 'most', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'partisan', 'incivility', 'outright', 'rancor', 'mainstream', 'television', 'news.Ultimately', 'question', 'regards', 'Outfoxed', 'Murdoch', 'FOX', 'News', 'preaching', 'choir', 'actually', 'converting', 'masses', 'example', 'are', 'statistics', 'showing', 'viewers', 'who', 'watch', 'FOX', 'News', 'are', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'likely', 'hold', 'specific', 'beliefs', 'line', 'position', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'who', 'watch', 'news', 'PBS', 'think', 'large', 'part', 'numbers', 'would', 'fall', 'chicken', 'egg', 'category', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'conservatives', 'FOX', 'News', 'viewers', 'respectively', 'other', 'words', 'Murdoch', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'creating', 'conservatives', 'reinforcing', 'beliefs', 'Granted', 'must', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'converted', 'given', 'demonstrated', 'bias', 'network', 'rather', 'amazing', 'figures', 'supporting', 'positions', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'higher.The', 'audience', 'Outfoxed', 'comparable', 'electorate', '2004', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'embrace', 'dismiss', 'hand', 'based', 'ideological', 'bent', 'doubt', 'will', 'write', 'reviews', 'accordingly', 'clearly', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'attack', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'hyperbolic', 'e.g', 'idea', 'THE', 'key', 'factor', 'Bush', 'election', 'was', 'decision', 'cousin', 'have', 'FOX', 'News', 'call', 'Florida', 'election', 'forcing', 'other', 'networks', 'follow', 'suit', 'establish', 'idea', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'close', 'tell', 'attempt', 'retire', 'fire', 'kind', 'Outfoxed', 'also', 'informative', 'terms', 'detailing', 'how', 'Murdoch', 'organization', 'business', 'recipe', 'success', 'sin', 'canon', 'journalistic', 'ethics', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'current', 'generation', 'would-be', 'journalists', 'decide', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'Outfoxed', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'War', 'Journalism', 'certainly', 'questions', 'discussing', 'classroom']",N/A

These filmmakers have some 75 minutes to make their argument, and they do so most convincingly: that Fox does not &quot;report&quot; the news as journalists traditionally have done, that they package GOP talking points in red-white-and-blue bunting, and that what few &quot;opposing  viewpoints&quot; they do invite on air are cut off, muffled, or reviled.It is marvelous that new technology allows people who care to get their hands on films like &quot;Outfoxed&quot; without waiting to find out whether their local network, radio station, or movie theater is brave enough to show something controversial.",5,A frightening look at a pervasive source of disinformation,1089849600,"07 15, 2004",2004,1689,"['recently', 'thought', 'Fox', 'only', 'network', 'carried', 'quot', 'Simpsons.', 'quot', 'Except', 'Election', 'Night', 'never', 'watch', 'television', 'news', 'primary', 'sources', 'information', 'wee', 'hours', 'Election', 'Night', '2000', 'networks', 'Fox', 'said', 'race', 'was', 'too', 'close', 'call', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'first', 'cousin', 'John', 'Ellis', 'who', 'Fox', 'called', 'race', 'Bush', 'rest', 'networks', 'obediently', 'followed', 'leader.This', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'highlighted', 'quot', 'Outfoxed.', 'quot', 'heroic', 'task', 'watching', 'Fox', 'live', 'taped', '24/7', 'period', 'months', 'discerning', 'network', 'primary', 'ways', 'slanting', 'news', 'was', 'undertaken', 'heroic', 'crew', 'filmmakers', 'volunteers', 'large', 'number', 'contemporary', 'media', 'critics', 'former', 'Fox', 'employees', 'voice', 'opinions', 'Even', 'unflappable', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'never', 'seen', 'news', 'slanted', 'way', 'Fox', 'does.The', 'fact', 'network', 'not', 'rebut', 'argument', 'film', 'irrelevant', 'Fox', 'time', 'basic', 'cable', 'subscribers', 'country', 'filmmakers', 'have', '75', 'minutes', 'make', 'argument', 'do', 'so', 'most', 'convincingly', 'Fox', 'not', 'quot', 'report', 'quot', 'news', 'journalists', 'traditionally', 'have', 'done', 'package', 'GOP', 'talking', 'points', 'red-white-and-blue', 'bunting', 'what', 'few', 'quot', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'quot', 'do', 'invite', 'air', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'muffled', 'reviled.It', 'marvelous', 'new', 'technology', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'get', 'hands', 'films', 'quot', 'Outfoxed', 'quot', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'local', 'network', 'radio', 'station', 'movie', 'theater', 'brave', 'enough', 'show', 'something', 'controversial']",N/A

That may be worth the price of this DVD, as long as you buy it used for about five bucks and then sell it used for about five bucks.Other than that, I was left unconvinced that there's anything all that wrong with Fox News, or at least that there's anything more wrong with Fox News than with any other news network.  Now for some particulars:First, why is ""corporate control"" of a news network suddenly so bad?  I remember when the ""big three"" were independent corporations, and now ABC is owned by Disney, and NBC is owned by General Electric, right?  Oh, and there's MS(Microsoft)NBC.  Isn't Microsoft a corporation?Second, the editing made the heads of interviewees jerk around almost like that old ""Max Headroom"" character of the 1980's.  I felt like the tapes of the interviews had been extensively rearranged for propaganda purposes.  It also gave me the impression that the people behind this documentary didn't know how to do their jobs very well.Third, I'm really not impressed by a voice telling me bad things about Fox while I'm staring at a microphone, a recorder, and volume meters bouncing up and down.  Anybody could phony up something like this.Fourth, the technique of taking quotes out of Fox memos, highlighting the first and last sentences, and greying and fading out the middle before I even had a chance to read the entire quote seemed like blatent in-your-face twisting of facts.  I suppose I could have hit pause and carefully analyzed those quotes anyway, but by then I was so let down by the amateurishness of this production that I didn't really care.Fifth, what totally discredited this entire documentary is what seemed to be a condemnation of Fox simply for reporting good things our military people are doing for the people of Iraq.  The not-so-subtle implication is that any ""smart"" and ""enlightened"" person knows that there is absolutely no way our military could possibly be doing good anywhere in Iraq.  Thus, showing our military doing good is bad journalism and that's all there is to it.Finally, I watched this after Dan Rather ""memogate"" fiasco went public.  That made the entire premise of this documentary seem dated and wrong.I'm not convinced that Fox News is as ""fair and balanced"" as they would want me to believe, but I am convinced that this ""documentary"" is little more than red meat for the Howard Dean segment of the Democratic Party; meat that is already spoiled and rotten.",2,Using amateur propaganda to debunk professional propaganda?,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2529,"['gave', 'documentary', 'two', 'stars', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'shut', 'up', 'montage', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'may', 'be', 'price', 'DVD', 'as', 'long', 'buy', 'used', 'five', 'bucks', 'then', 'sell', 'used', 'five', 'bucks.Other', 'was', 'left', 'unconvinced', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Fox', 'News', 'least', 'anything', 'more', 'wrong', 'Fox', 'News', 'other', 'news', 'network', 'Now', 'particulars', 'First', 'why', 'corporate', 'control', 'news', 'network', 'suddenly', 'so', 'bad', 'remember', 'when', 'big', 'three', 'were', 'independent', 'corporations', 'now', 'ABC', 'owned', 'Disney', 'NBC', 'owned', 'General', 'Electric', 'right', 'Oh', 'MS', 'Microsoft', 'NBC', ""n't"", 'Microsoft', 'corporation', 'Second', 'editing', 'made', 'heads', 'interviewees', 'jerk', 'around', 'almost', 'old', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'character', '1980', 'felt', 'tapes', 'interviews', 'had', 'been', 'extensively', 'rearranged', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'also', 'gave', 'impression', 'people', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'jobs', 'very', 'well.Third', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'impressed', 'voice', 'telling', 'bad', 'things', 'Fox', ""'m"", 'staring', 'microphone', 'recorder', 'volume', 'meters', 'bouncing', 'up', 'down', 'Anybody', 'could', 'phony', 'up', 'something', 'this.Fourth', 'technique', 'taking', 'quotes', 'Fox', 'memos', 'highlighting', 'first', 'last', 'sentences', 'greying', 'fading', 'out', 'middle', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'read', 'entire', 'quote', 'seemed', 'like', 'blatent', 'in-your-face', 'twisting', 'facts', 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'hit', 'pause', 'carefully', 'analyzed', 'quotes', 'anyway', 'then', 'was', 'so', 'let', 'down', 'amateurishness', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care.Fifth', 'what', 'totally', 'discredited', 'entire', 'documentary', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'condemnation', 'Fox', 'simply', 'reporting', 'good', 'things', 'military', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'people', 'Iraq', 'not-so-subtle', 'implication', 'smart', 'enlightened', 'person', 'absolutely', 'way', 'military', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'doing', 'good', 'anywhere', 'Iraq', 'Thus', 'showing', 'military', 'doing', 'good', 'bad', 'journalism', 'it.Finally', 'watched', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'memogate', 'fiasco', 'went', 'public', 'made', 'entire', 'premise', 'documentary', 'seem', 'dated', 'wrong.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Fox', 'News', 'fair', 'balanced', 'would', 'want', 'believe', 'am', 'convinced', 'documentary', 'little', 'more', 'red', 'meat', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'segment', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'meat', 'already', 'spoiled', 'rotten']",N/A

The purpose of the film is to bring Fox News to its knees, consisting entirely of interviews with such people as Al Franken as well as former Fox employees, and lots of clips from Fox News itself.  The theme is to show that the channel is slanted to the right. There's a sense of outrage throughout.  How can Bill O'Reilly be so cruel?  How can every newscaster use the term ""some people say"" in order to falsely introduce opinions when they should be only reporting hard news.  Why is right-wing Sean Hannity smooth and good looking while left wing Alan Colmes seems to be a wimp?  The conclusion reached is that Fox News is not ""fair and balanced"" and has its own agenda.So what?  I've known that all along.The film has one theme and it's pounded home over and over again. And even though its only 77 minutes long I was easily bored.The DVD has a 30-minute feature about the making of the film that was much too long because it didn't say anything new.I doubt if this film will open anyone's eyes.

And the conservatives who see it as a breath of fresh air amidst a preponderance of liberal media probably won't bother to view the film at all.As for me, I will continue to watch the O'Reilly factor, knowing full well that he's a bully and that I often don't agree with him.

First, there were obvious examples of Fox's conservative bias that the program missed (the way the studio audiences for Linda Vester's Day Side always deride liberals and applaud conservatives, the way every email comment put up before the commercial breaks on The Big Story with John Gibson always slam liberals and the way Hannity and Colmes always opens with Newt Gingrich, William Bennett or Ann Coulter, when they never have guests on like, say, Noam Chomsky or Michael Moore).Second, by having only liberal critics of Fox News Channel interviewed for the documentary, the documentary unwittingly gives credence to the conservative dictum that the mainstream media has a liberal bias (I put mainstream in quotes because more people watch Fox News Channel now than CNN or MSNBC combined -- therefore who is the real media elite now?). For instance, if director Robert Greenwald could have secured interviews with conservatives like William F. Buckley, Pat Buchanan, Matt Drudge or even William Kristol (who, because he is on the FNC payroll probably couldn't be asked), their views might have given this film more depth.Third, a consideration of how other news outlets operates is necessary to show just how different Fox News Channel is from CNN, MSNBC, PBS or the Network News on ABC, CBS or NBC. If, as certain people suggest, CNN is the Clinton News Network, how is their practicing of journalism any different from Fox's? The documentary makes too many assumptions about what constitutes objective journalism. It ends up sounding like liberal journalism (I mean, this documentary is funded by moveon.org). Does this mean that they want a model of news reporting that is simply the political opposite of Fox News, yet similar in tactical and practical approach (which this film is actually critical of)?Fourth, the film's supposed smoking gun evidence of Fox's Right Wing Conspiracy is interesting but hardly compelling. Memos from Fox News Executives are hardly earthshattering. But the interview the with the reporter hired to cover an underwhelming response to Ronald Reagan's birthday was very relevatory. He was suspended because he couldn't make a flashier story out of circumstances that really presented no interesting news story. The satellite-feed exchange between Carl Cameron (whose wife was campaigning for George W. Bush) and George W. Bush is also damning. Can you say conflict of interest? I knew you could. Also, the claim that Fox News basically won the election for Bush in 2000 is an interesting claim--though not nearly as cool as the one's devised by conspiracy theorists.Where the film succeeds is in its criticism of the channel's use of the phrase fair and balanced and in its assertion of being news. Now to be fair (ha-ha), if Fox would just admit to being a conservative news outlet, I would have no problem with them at all. Conservatives need a place to get the news they want to hear in a place where they feel comfortable. I understand that. But when they say fair and balanced yet 85 percent of the guests on Special Report with Brit Hume (that number is presumably higher on Neil Cavuto's shows) are Republicans, that seems pretty far from fair or balanced. (Also, the fact that FNC is, currently, airing very little of the Democratic National Convention gives credence to this film's claims.) The film does a good job of showing that the network has a strong roster of notable conservatives but a lackluster roster of liberals (who the hell is David Corn for instance). In this sense, Fox News Channel is only balanced if the conceit of a liberal media bias is seriously considered (i.e. FNC balances out fairness in coverage ideologically amongst the news outlets). On its own, though, it is hardly fair and balanced. As far as considering its network a news channel, Outfoxed also excels, but does not go far enough. Even though I don't trust FNC as a resource for getting news (I would rather watch MSNBC as far as TV is concerned), it is incredibly entertaining (watching CNN is unbearable: Aaron Brown is about as boring as watching a painting of a vase). Like conservative radio, FNC is chock-full of bullying personalities who spin opinions as news in a confrontational manner. No wonder people watch this stuff. It's fun, but it's hardly a way to get news.Though the film is filled with plenty cannon-fodder for any Fox News-hater worth his/her mettle, I just wish it was more rigorous in its examination of why Fox News Channel is so successful (in terms beyond those that are purely ideological).  Where it is successful is in its pessimism regarding the consequences of FNC's success on the world of news coverage in the West.",3,The News about the News,1090886400,"07 27,

Epstein ""asanisimasa""","[10, 14]","Someone here wrote ""the other reviews demonstrate that people prefer the news that alligns (his spelling) with their beliefs"".  That shows why Fox News is so horrid.  It has given people the idea that it's okay for news to be biased.  The fact is, that the news isn't supposed to align with ANYONE'S beliefs!!!!  As politics, business, or the media can often be corrupt and do what's in their best interests over the best interests of the people, the people must be able to depend on journalists to unveil corruption, lies and secrecy, to tell both sides of every issue fully, and to do it all OBJECTIVELY.  Like in newspapers, there is always room for editorializing, but that should be presented in a completely separate forum, not threaded into the reporting.  And if a pundit asks someone to join him in debate, he should let his opponent speak.  Imagine if a newspaper interview had nearly every sentence by the interviewee cut off in midway with ""shut ups!"".  This is not only disreputable as journalism, it's disreputable in any discussion above the level of second grade.There's no doubt that this documentary includes many liberal pundits, but the film sticks to the agenda that news in general has an obligation to objective.  Numerous conservative pundits also appear in the film speaking for the same thing, including several Fox News employees who left the station of their own will.  The fact is that the so-called ""liberal"" news media is hated by Fox because it at least makes some effort to cover both sides of an issue.  I personally believe the ""liberal"" media is more conservative than liberal because of all of the stories that it doesn't cover, and that they usually reduce stories that need in-depth reporting to 60 seconds or less.  Opponents of Fox News ask that they take out the words ""fair and balanced"".  I agree, but I would also add that they take out the words ""news"".  If the Fox team want to go on the Comedy Channel after ""The Daily Show"" (they could call themselves ""The Daily Snow Job"") I'd applaud them because I think they're hilarious at news spoofing.  But with nearly 70% of the American people STILL believing that Iraqis were responsible for 911 (not to mention thousands of other fallacies), this network is in a huge way responsible for the dumbing down of America.

833258,AMSSG5FPT8XMU,B0002HDXTQ,"Rev4u ""Rev""","[9, 21]","A fascinating feature of the Fox newtwork is its duality. The general programming carried on Fox is usually filled with soft core pornography and inappropriate contents. However, their news and talk shows are the extreme opposite, and they totally reflect a staunch neoconservative approach advocated by their owner the Australian media mogul Mr. Murdoch. The Fox talk show genre that the late wally George has made famous, became their favorite dish of the day, where the guest is belittled, harrassed, and intimidated rendering his opinion inaudible. The shouting host seems to win the match every single time, therefore he wins the argument. I predict that eventually this genre will die down and people will get bored and tired of it, because it is truly idiotic. It is specially designed for angry and frustrated people to watch, so they can act out their anger vicariously through these hypocritical hosts. Unfortunately, many of the other networks jumped on the Fox Network bandwagon and created their own copy cat versions of the rude opnionated, and shouting host embodied in Mr. Bill Oreilly. The game is to create and perpetuate confusion and division among the people. The word Liberal became an insult, and the word conservative became equivalent to Jesus Christ. That is good propaganda! I think Mr. Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media mogul should add to his team Mr. Rush Limbaugh the King of morality and the famous conservative radio talk show host. Mr. Murdoch should also give him a segment on the Oreilly show.

At a list of $9.95, the expense is minimal.This film has already had one positive effect. Members of Congress have already written Rupert Murdoch a group letter asking him to arrange a meeting with Congress regarding the problems at Fox and what needs to be done to clean them up.

833261,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002HDXTQ,Robert Moore,"[8, 10]","While this excellent documentary falls just short of being outstanding, it is nonetheless a very helpful expose of the dubious and journalistically unethical practices that under gird Fox News's news reporting.  Actually, ""news reporting"" is one of the things Fox does not do.  As the documentary shows, Fox News, unlike other major news organizations, does not actually do much reporting, in the sense that they have few actual investigative reporters.  What they actually do is ""re-reporting,"" usually taking news stories broken by others and then repackaging them to reflect a decided right wing bias.  What they report is only as accurate as the AP and Reuters feeds upon which they profoundly rely.As a news repackaging service, Fox has few parallels.  Actually, on a national scale on television, they have no parallels.  Although they have managed, along with other Right Wing organizations, to inject a right wing slant in most news reporting, other organizations like CNN and unlike Fox have a stable of field reporters, while Fox has primarily on air TV personalities who depend on the work of other organizations.  These reporters for CNN and other organizations try to present a reasonably unbiased account of the news.Much of what is contained in the documentary will be familiar with anyone who has even casually followed the media in the past decade.  It begins with the founding of Fox with the money of Rupert Murdoch as a means to place extreme Right Wing ideas inside a presumably unbiased news outlet.  Some time is spent on Roger Ailes, the lifelong GOP operative and media consultant who ran George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, whose ties with the Republican party are deep and extensive, and who is the founder of Fox and the only head it has ever had.  The more depressing and chilling parts of the film are the interviews with current and past Fox employees, who detail the overwhelming right wing bias inside the organization, to the extent that onscreen language is organized to highlight or even create certain negatives about Democratic candidates, and killing any stories that would reflect badly on Republican ones.  Specific ""talking point"" memos are presented that paint a very negative picture of the journalistic ethics of Fox.  The most effective parts of the documentary are when such tricks are first stated, and then illustrated with five, ten, or twenty on air instants where a variety of Fox personalities hammer home that same point.  One such instance that I recalled was after Bush's State of the Union where he called for a second major tax cut slanted towards the rich.  Now, if asked to generate a list of words to describe that tax cut, ""bold"" is not likely to appear on anyone's list.  But within seconds of the end of the speech, GOP political figures and all of the on air personalities at Fox were describing it as a ""bold"" proposal.  In this way, Fox works hand in glove with the GOP to create an atmosphere of acceptance for GOP proposals.This points up the most dangerous thing about Fox: it is the only major news organization on television to have worked in concerted fashion with a political party.  Although claims in the past of a liberal biased in the media is demonstrably false (though it is one of the great achievements of the Right to have a so-called liberal bias to be taken as a commonplace), never was there the assertion that the Democratic Party (hardly itself a liberal organization, I'm unhappy to note--Bill Clinton, for instance, was to the right of Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower on most issues) actually colluded with any major news organization.  The daily collusion of Fox and the GOP is one of the great outrages in American political life.One of the more revealing bits in the film is when a reporter revealed that the organization tried to tout supposed celebrations of the birthday of Ronald Reagan.  The reporter went to the Reagan presidential library, found that there were no such celebrations, but was pressured to do the story anyway.  Viewers at home, however, could not know this.Unfortunately, the ones who most need to see this documentary are those who rely upon it for their news.  They assume Fox is a news organization, but as noted above, they don't actually do much in the way of reporting.  They re-report and repackage the news with a deeply biased, even propagandistic slant.  They decide, and they do not report, but the naive reporter is duped nonetheless.",4,A solid expose of Fox News journalistic practices,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,4492,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'just', 'short', 'being', 'outstanding', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'helpful', 'expose', 'dubious', 'journalistically', 'unethical', 'practices', 'gird', 'Fox', 'News', 'news', 'reporting', 'Actually', 'news', 'reporting', 'one', 'things', 'Fox', 'not', 'do', 'documentary', 'shows', 'Fox', 'News', 'other', 'major', 'news', 'organizations', 'not', 'actually', 'do', 'much', 'reporting', 'sense', 'have', 'few', 'actual', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'What', 'actually', 'do', 're-reporting', 'usually', 'taking', 'news', 'stories', 'broken', 'others', 'then', 'repackaging', 'reflect', 'decided', 'right', 'wing', 'bias', 'What', 'report', 'only', 'as', 'accurate', 'AP', 'Reuters', 'feeds', 'profoundly', 'rely.As', 'news', 'repackaging', 'service', 'Fox', 'few', 'parallels', 'Actually', 'national', 'scale', 'television', 'have', 'parallels', 'have', 'managed', 'other', 'Right', 'Wing', 'organizations', 'inject', 'right', 'wing', 'slant', 'most', 'news', 'reporting', 'other', 'organizations', 'CNN', 'Fox', 'have', 'stable', 'field', 'reporters', 'Fox', 'primarily', 'air', 'TV', 'personalities', 'who', 'depend', 'work', 'other', 'organizations', 'reporters', 'CNN', 'other', 'organizations', 'try', 'present', 'reasonably', 'unbiased', 'account', 'news.Much', 'what', 'contained', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'casually', 'followed', 'media', 'past', 'decade', 'founding', 'Fox', 'money', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'means', 'place', 'extreme', 'Right', 'Wing', 'ideas', 'presumably', 'unbiased', 'news', 'outlet', 'time', 'spent', 'Roger', 'Ailes', 'lifelong', 'GOP', 'operative', 'media', 'consultant', 'who', 'ran', 'George', 'H.', 'W.', 'Bush', '1988', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'ties', 'Republican', 'party', 'are', 'deep', 'extensive', 'who', 'founder', 'Fox', 'only', 'head', 'ever', 'had', 'more', 'depressing', 'chilling', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'interviews', 'current', 'past', 'Fox', 'employees', 'who', 'detail', 'overwhelming', 'right', 'wing', 'bias', 'organization', 'extent', 'onscreen', 'language', 'organized', 'highlight', 'even', 'create', 'certain', 'negatives', 'Democratic', 'candidates', 'killing', 'stories', 'would', 'reflect', 'badly', 'Republican', 'ones', 'Specific', 'talking', 'point', 'memos', 'are', 'presented', 'paint', 'very', 'negative', 'picture', 'journalistic', 'ethics', 'Fox', 'most', 'effective', 'parts', 'documentary', 'are', 'when', 'such', 'tricks', 'are', 'first', 'stated', 'then', 'illustrated', 'five', 'ten', 'twenty', 'air', 'instants', 'where', 'variety', 'Fox', 'personalities', 'hammer', 'home', 'same', 'point', 'One', 'such', 'instance', 'recalled', 'was', 'Bush', 'State', 'Union', 'where', 'called', 'second', 'major', 'tax', 'cut', 'slanted', 'rich', 'Now', 'asked', 'generate', 'list', 'words', 'describe', 'tax', 'cut', 'bold', 'not', 'likely', 'appear', 'anyone', 'list', 'seconds', 'end', 'speech', 'GOP', 'political', 'figures', 'air', 'personalities', 'Fox', 'were', 'describing', 'bold', 'proposal', 'way', 'Fox', 'hand', 'glove', 'GOP', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'acceptance', 'GOP', 'proposals.This', 'up', 'most', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'Fox', 'only', 'major', 'news', 'organization', 'television', 'have', 'worked', 'concerted', 'fashion', 'political', 'party', 'claims', 'past', 'liberal', 'biased', 'media', 'demonstrably', 'false', 'one', 'great', 'achievements', 'Right', 'have', 'so-called', 'liberal', 'bias', 'be', 'taken', 'commonplace', 'never', 'was', 'assertion', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'hardly', 'liberal', 'organization', ""'m"", 'unhappy', 'note', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'instance', 'was', 'right', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'most', 'issues', 'actually', 'colluded', 'major', 'news', 'organization', 'daily', 'collusion', 'Fox', 'GOP', 'one', 'great', 'outrages', 'American', 'political', 'life.One', 'more', 'revealing', 'bits', 'film', 'when', 'reporter', 'revealed', 'organization', 'tried', 'tout', 'supposed', 'celebrations', 'birthday', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'reporter', 'went', 'Reagan', 'presidential', 'library', 'found', 'were', 'such', 'celebrations', 'was', 'pressured', 'do', 'story', 'anyway', 'Viewers', 'home', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'know', 'this.Unfortunately', 'ones', 'who', 'most', 'need', 'see', 'documentary', 'are', 'who', 'rely', 'news', 'assume', 'Fox', 'news', 'organization', 'noted', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'much', 'way', 'reporting', 're-report', 'repackage', 'news', 'deeply', 'biased', 'even', 'propagandistic', 'slant', 'decide', 'do', 'not', 'report', 'naive', 'reporter', 'duped', 'nonetheless']",N/A

I don't entirely disagree; however, I do question some of the facts presented here.For example, if Rupert Murdoch's empire is so huge that it reaches three quarters of the global population, who is watching CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, Al Jazeerah, etc.?  Do 4.7 billion people in the world have televisions?  That's a shocking assertion.Bill O'Reilly is portrayed as a particularly sharp-tongued, rude reactionary host and several former Fox employees step up to the plate to discuss ways in which they were censored when they worked for the network.  Shameful.  But doesn't a similar bias exists in most mainstream media?  It's all supported by advertising.  When I was young, I used to read Mother Jonesand Ms. Magazine, in the days when neither one of them had any form of ads.  I also liked WBAI, listener sponsored radio in New York City, for that very reason.Yes, Fox has a serious right wing slant but this movie engages in the very same form of tunnel vision that it criticizes.  Why weren't any current Fox employees interviewed?  Why wasn't an attempt made to interview Murdoch or other CEOs so that they could defend their practices?  I'm not saying that they are defensible -- just that there was no attempt to portray the other side of the picture.Lastly, much like the The Corporation, this was not *new* to me.  It was disconcerting but not illuminating, and I found the proposed solutions to be far too simplistic.  Stand up to our local Fox station?  Visit the FCC on our next vacation?  Will that really work with someone who allegedly reaches three quarters of the world's population through his media?  Sounds doubtful!

While the Washington Times endorses only republican candidates.If one wants to see *really* blatant conservative bias, you should not look at Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, but instead look at such places as WorldNetDaily, Drudge Report, The New American, and talk radio host Michael Savage.It goes to show that that while some may call the media bias, it needs to appeal to both the left and the right.It is no secret that Fox News leans to the right, but so do about half of all Americans. Some lean slightly to the right, others lean further to the right. To be fair to conservatives, it should be in the middle. There are many who think Fox News is too liberal also. Just as there are many who think that NPR is too conservative. America is no longer just liberal and conservative, but has gone to a four or even five tier system of political idelogies. The media in whole has a bipartisan view. Instead they should be multi partisan and show the views of the third parties such as the constitution party, the green party, and the libertarian party (the three largest in terms of voter registration), which they rarely if ever do.It does not take a scientist to show that about half of the country is liberal and the other half is conservative, so why can't one news channel have some leanings to the right?While some may claim that the mainstream media outlets are moderate, some of them, most notably NPR have admitted to having a liberal bias.

833276,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0002HDXTQ,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[25, 30]","Well, as I prepared to review this DVD, I looked at a few of the prior reviews. What a shock: so many who've never even seen it giving it one star with a bunch of nonarguments. Some things never change...especially the dry old claim that the mainstream media are bastions of the left. For those who claim that, prove it, or SHUT UP--to quote your mentor, Bill O'Reilly.O'Reilly is just one of the Fox demagogs this DVD covers. Now, I must admit that I've had a problem with the media for years. During Vietnam, few of the mainstream media pointed out the lies on which that conflict was based--until some of the editors' own offspring were getting killed over there. Then there was Desert Storm in which every VFW unit in the country was quoted, while voices challenging the invasion of Iraq were silenced. So my aversion to the ""mainstream"" started a long time ago. Then the ""fairness doctrine"" was eliminated. In fact, one of the talking heads in this DVD, a woman from Common Cause, said it was during the Reagan time that it was eliminated, but I recall it was actually during Carter. This permitted any mass medium to say whatever it would like--or whatever the ""market"" preferred. And that provided a fertile ground for things like Fox to thrive.I have a particular aversion to O'Reilly because my father-in-law worships him. Ironic, though, that my father-in-law reads O'Reilly's screeds without watching him intimidate and bully people on the air. When the son of a 9/11 victim signed a petition against the war, the O'Reilly staff hounded him until he finally came on. While the young guy was well prepared, O'Reilly did his best to bully him. Then when the kid essentially won, was prepared enough to do so, O'Reilly got the security guards to accompany him off the set, then the producer told the kid to get out of the building so that O'Reilly doesn't get violent with him. Oh, and that's on top of O'Reilly telling anyone who disagrees with him to ""shut up!"" and turning their mikes off. All of this is pretty well summarized in the DVD. (And I say the same thing I did in my review of ""The Oh Really Factor"" which I got from Amazon.com some time ago: To get that loud-mouthed bully off the air, refuse to appear on his show. Then he may have to go out and get a real job!)O'Reilly has the audacity to suggest on the air that anyone not supporting the war once we've bought into it is an enemy of the state? Hmmm...so Stalinist for a so-called conservative...Then there's Sean Hannity and his straight man, what's his name. More of the same rude behavior.Brit Hume. And others.Then there's the memos from the hierarchy telling them what they're supposed to report and how they're to report it. And they call that journalism...By the way, one of the commentators to which those who're fiercely critical of the DVD don't mention is that bastion of credibility Walter Kronkite. He too says he's never seen anything like Fox before in print or broadcast journalism. And most of the other commentators, the bulk of them former Fox reporters (many of them anonymous, with even their voices altered to maintain anonymity) criticize the ""network"" more for their phony claim to being ""fair and balanced"" than they do for being a ""conservative network.""Rupert Murdoch boasts of their ""objectivity""; his lieutenant Roger Ailes says their plan is to ban excellent news organization. Yet, as the DVD shows, they're anything but that. All the traditional standards of journalism are ignored. There's no line between commentary and news. Even the ""extra extra,"" a category intended for REAL big news, like school shootings, ends up being used for a showbiz marital squabble.One commentator called Fox ""an adjunct for the GOP,"" and another had a nearly-as-poetic description. Fox's choice to portray everything Bush does as heroic, and everything John Kerry says as idiotic demonstrates that quite well. I only wish they'd done a little more work with refuting the claims. Like the words ""flip flop"" were repeated so often on anything Kerry said that one could get seasick hearing it. I wish they'd either demonstrated Bush doing that too--especially with the lack of eloquence Bush demonstrates so frequently unless he has an adolescent script before him--or refuted it, i.e., examined that what Kerry did was NOT a flip flop. (That's something  Al Franken, who appears in this DVD, did toward other victims of the mass media in his book which is also available from Amazon.com!)Before ending with a ""what can you do?"" section, most of the commentators state their fear that the problem with something like Fox is that it is influencing other networks. Flag-waving jingoism seems to have a market now, so that's the way the others are going. And that's dangerous. So much for a variety of honest, informed opinions.This is a powerful show, really. In fact, I intend to use it for ""salons,"" discussion groups of people wondering what to do to make our society a better place to live. The last section I think is a little idealist, but I DO plan to contact the FCC and others. See this, and share it with others.

Almost no political documentary is going to be completely fair but the fact here is that Fox News is never fair, never balanced, which is opposite of what their slogan ""Fair and Balanced,"" says. Or the ""We report, you decide"" slogan.The facts here are plain and simple: the Fox News managers, owners, producers, or whatever, dictate how they want things to be produced. It's clear in the memos presented. They have more conservative guests than liberals. The liberals they choose are normally less-known or weak. There is no balance on Fox News.Also, many of the people who give their interviews on this documentary are former Fox employees themselves, some of whom were reprimanded for not covering stories the way they wanted, like the guy who didn't glorify the Reagan birthday celebration enough (even though it was a very small celebration). They were being made to do things that they didn't want to do. All of their pundits have such big egos and are just absolutely rude, telling their guests to shut up all the time and cutting their microphones off. They only have ONE liberal pundit on the entire network: Alan Colmes, a weak, rat-faced liberal who gets dominated by his parter Sean Hannity every night.This documentary has no evil agenda. In fact, one of their guests encourages everyone to look at many different knews sources, conservative and liberal, to try and get ALL the info.No other news network does this. Of course some of their pundits and anchors will have opinions but they allow a fair amount of liberal and conservative guests and they are never rude. Every other news station allows both sides to be heard. Fox News tries to suppress the liberal side.Oh yeah, and don't try to defend Fox News with the ratings card. The reason why their ratings are so high is because basically all conservatives concentrate on that show, whereas liberals are likely to switch in between certain networks.""Outfoxed"" is well-done and well-researched.

You can turn on a variety of other networks' news programs, including PBS, and clearly the see the liberal bias of the reporters and anchors.

The reason the makers of this film are mad is that Fox News is now the most popular news channel in America, thus disrupting the left wing's stranglehold on news.  If all the channels were controlled by a single idealogy, that would be scary.  Having different news channels with different idealogies allows citizens to see different sides of the same issues.  This is a good thing.  Furthermore, to say that Fox is controlled by Republicans is absurd, given that much of non-news programming on Fox is very contrary to the traditional morality embraced by most Republicans, and especially the Bush administration.

833281,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0002HDXTQ,William Hare,"[25, 35]","""Outfoxed"" clears away the smoke and reveals the ""fair and balanced"" motto of Fox News to be an outrageous sham.  Early in this fast-paced and highly informative documentary produced and directed by the talented Robert Greenwald, Fox star commentator Neil Cavuto exclaims, "" ... if, God forbid, John Kerry is elected president.""The Cavuto comment makes one laugh robustly at any ""fair and balanced"" claim in the wake of that revelation and much more, such as the harangues of rightist stalwarts such as Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.  It also tempts one to play the game of ""if the shoe were on the other foot"" regarding the right and Cavuto's statement.What type of response would be generated by the right and, through the swift ripple effect, the entire media if Dan Rather were ever to state on CBS, "" ... if, God forbid, George Bush is victorious in the presidential election""?  How long would it take for the vigilante posse to be formed and the gallows to be erected in the center of town?  This would be the most calamitous outrage since the uproar over Bill Clinton having extra-marital sex with an intern.The documentary's informative value is enhanced by the appearance of ex-Fox employees explaining company policies.  One former executive recalls fondly the good old days in the network's early period.  Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch gave his reporters and commentators the opportunity to function on their own without the intervening look over the shoulder from Big Brother.That early period soon shifted abruptly to the pattern that has unfolded thereafter, one of Murdoch imposing his pronounced right wing views and the network becoming an adjunct of the Republican Party.  Memos would be presented with talking points for the day established.  Generally they would consist of either making a particular liberal Democrat look bad or the Bush White House look good, or both.One sees that the view adopted by some of certain liberals being wimps and wilting under intense right wing heat is not the major factor where Fox is concerned; power lies with the microphone and blustery Bill O'Reilly is a classic example of taking advantage of corporate advantage.  The lesson to be learned at Fox and elsewhere is that power resides with control of the microphone, and with it the network.O'Reilly controls a tight mike.  When he is pushed hard his voice notably rises and he becomes flustered.  If the tide is not swiftly turned and his adversary continues to pummel the position he advocates the interview is terminated.  A classic instance was when young Jeremy Glick, whose father worked for the New York Port Authority and died in the September 11 tragedy, appeared as a well-informed guest who had closely studied O'Reilly's interview pattern beforehand.When a coolly confident Glick told O'Reilly what he thought about the Bush administration action of bombing Afghanistan in the manner that it did, killing peasants rather than terrorists, the blustery host began shouting and ultimately called for security guards to escort his guest out of his interview room.  Glick explained that, after he went to obtain a cup of coffee in an anteroom a few feet away, concerned security guards asked him to leave for fear that O'Reilly might strike him and would be sent to jail.Another Fox pattern was exposed in this illuminating documentary.  When commentators receive their talking points they are instructed to repeat certain words as part of a mantra designed obviously to brainwash under the guise of providing information to viewers.  The expression ""some people are saying"" is used as a preface for a leading comment, either supporting a Republican position or hammering Democrats.  Over the course of time, according to the strategy, the sayings will stick and become imbedded thought patterns as well as perhaps part of that individual's lexicon.""Outfoxed"" reveals the dangers of corporate power immersed in the clutches of a Rupert Murdoch with the means of delivering propaganda broadcasts on behalf of the Republican right while operating under the pretense of ""fair and balanced"" coverage.Also revealed is the episode from election night 2000 when George W. Bush's first cousin John Ellis declared the then Texas governor to be the winner.  This launched a stampede of other news organizations, giving the Republicans the huge advantage of being perceived winners when the bitter Florida Recount battle began.",5,Rupert Murdoch's Republican Spin Machine Exposed,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,4440,"['Outfoxed', 'away', 'smoke', 'fair', 'balanced', 'motto', 'Fox', 'News', 'be', 'outrageous', 'sham', 'Early', 'fast-paced', 'highly', 'informative', 'documentary', 'produced', 'directed', 'talented', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'Fox', 'star', 'commentator', 'Neil', 'Cavuto', 'God', 'forbid', 'John', 'Kerry', 'elected', 'president', 'Cavuto', 'comment', 'one', 'laugh', 'robustly', 'fair', 'balanced', 'claim', 'wake', 'revelation', 'much', 'more', 'such', 'harangues', 'rightist', 'stalwarts', 'such', 'Sean', 'Hannity', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'also', 'one', 'play', 'game', 'shoe', 'were', 'other', 'foot', 'regarding', 'right', 'Cavuto', 'statement.What', 'type', 'response', 'would', 'be', 'generated', 'right', 'swift', 'ripple', 'effect', 'entire', 'media', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'were', 'ever', 'state', 'CBS', 'God', 'forbid', 'George', 'Bush', 'victorious', 'presidential', 'election', 'How', 'long', 'would', 'take', 'vigilante', 'posse', 'be', 'formed', 'gallows', 'be', 'erected', 'center', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'calamitous', 'outrage', 'uproar', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'having', 'extra-marital', 'sex', 'intern.The', 'documentary', 'informative', 'value', 'enhanced', 'appearance', 'ex-Fox', 'employees', 'explaining', 'company', 'policies', 'One', 'former', 'executive', 'recalls', 'fondly', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'network', 'early', 'period', 'Australian', 'media', 'mogul', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'gave', 'reporters', 'commentators', 'opportunity', 'function', 'own', 'intervening', 'look', 'shoulder', 'Big', 'Brother.That', 'early', 'period', 'soon', 'shifted', 'abruptly', 'pattern', 'unfolded', 'thereafter', 'one', 'Murdoch', 'imposing', 'pronounced', 'right', 'wing', 'views', 'network', 'becoming', 'adjunct', 'Republican', 'Party', 'Memos', 'would', 'be', 'presented', 'talking', 'points', 'day', 'established', 'Generally', 'would', 'consist', 'making', 'particular', 'liberal', 'Democrat', 'look', 'bad', 'Bush', 'White', 'House', 'look', 'good', 'both.One', 'sees', 'view', 'adopted', 'certain', 'liberals', 'being', 'wimps', 'wilting', 'intense', 'right', 'wing', 'heat', 'not', 'major', 'factor', 'where', 'Fox', 'concerned', 'power', 'microphone', 'blustery', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'classic', 'example', 'taking', 'advantage', 'corporate', 'advantage', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'Fox', 'elsewhere', 'power', 'resides', 'control', 'microphone', ""network.O'Reilly"", 'tight', 'mike', 'When', 'pushed', 'hard', 'voice', 'notably', 'flustered', 'tide', 'not', 'swiftly', 'turned', 'adversary', 'pummel', 'position', 'interview', 'terminated', 'classic', 'instance', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'Jeremy', 'Glick', 'father', 'worked', 'New', 'York', 'Port', 'Authority', 'died', 'September', '11', 'tragedy', 'appeared', 'well-informed', 'guest', 'who', 'had', 'closely', 'studied', ""O'Reilly"", 'interview', 'pattern', 'coolly', 'confident', 'Glick', 'told', ""O'Reilly"", 'what', 'thought', 'Bush', 'administration', 'action', 'bombing', 'Afghanistan', 'manner', 'did', 'killing', 'peasants', 'rather', 'terrorists', 'blustery', 'host', 'began', 'shouting', 'ultimately', 'called', 'security', 'guards', 'escort', 'guest', 'interview', 'room', 'Glick', 'explained', 'went', 'obtain', 'cup', 'coffee', 'anteroom', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'concerned', 'security', 'guards', 'asked', 'leave', 'fear', ""O'Reilly"", 'might', 'strike', 'would', 'be', 'sent', 'jail.Another', 'Fox', 'pattern', 'was', 'exposed', 'illuminating', 'documentary', 'When', 'commentators', 'receive', 'talking', 'points', 'are', 'instructed', 'repeat', 'certain', 'words', 'part', 'mantra', 'designed', 'obviously', 'brainwash', 'guise', 'providing', 'information', 'viewers', 'expression', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'used', 'preface', 'leading', 'comment', 'either', 'supporting', 'Republican', 'position', 'hammering', 'Democrats', 'course', 'time', 'according', 'strategy', 'sayings', 'will', 'stick', 'become', 'imbedded', 'thought', 'patterns', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'part', 'individual', 'lexicon', 'Outfoxed', 'dangers', 'corporate', 'power', 'immersed', 'clutches', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'means', 'delivering', 'propaganda', 'broadcasts', 'behalf', 'Republican', 'right', 'operating', 'pretense', 'fair', 'balanced', 'coverage.Also', 'revealed', 'episode', 'election', 'night', '2000', 'when', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'first', 'cousin', 'John', 'Ellis', 'declared', 'then', 'Texas', 'governor', 'be', 'winner', 'launched', 'stampede', 'other', 'news', 'organizations', 'giving', 'Republicans', 'huge', 'advantage', 'being', 'perceived', 'winners', 'when', 'bitter', 'Florida', 'Recount', 'battle', 'began']",N/A
