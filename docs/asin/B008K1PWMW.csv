The series is nothing short of brilliant and is deeply engaging. Much like it's source, it centers around the extremely rural city of Sparta, Mississippi, it's police force, and the crooks who think they can get away with it.The show dealt with some pretty heavy handed issues such as rape, government corruption, homophobia, and racism.

I had never heard of TGG Direct but this was a no brainer for me since this is one of my favorite programs.  I have only watched the first disc so far, however the picture and audio quality seem to be just fine.  I did notice a few little minor irritants.  First of all the artwork on the front is a little grainy (I am confused by the large city silouhette located on a large body of water depicted under the cast photo), they used plain black cases similar to those used for single DVD releases, and the DVD labels look like something one could make at home.  Also a little annoying, you can choose a show from the main menu however after the show you select is done the next episode strarts playing as a DVD with ""play all"" option would rather than going back to the main menu.  More annoying, the episode play time does not start at 0 seconds except for the first episode on each disc as it normally would.  For example if episode one was 49:26 mins episode 2 would start at 49:27 and if episode 2 were 48:00 mins episode 3 would start at 1 39:28 thus you really don't have any idea if the episode is almost done or not (I like to have and idea).  Naturally the packaging is not up to major studio standards, but TGG Direct came though where it counts releasing this show with good picture quality.  I hope they follow up with the rest of the Season sets priced reasonably as they did with this one.",4,In the Heat of the Night at last,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1464,"['was', 'delighted', 'finally', 'see', 'Series', 'released', 'DVD', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'TGG', 'Direct', 'was', 'brainer', 'one', 'favorite', 'programs', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'disc', 'so', 'far', 'however', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'did', 'notice', 'few', 'little', 'minor', 'irritants', 'First', 'artwork', 'front', 'little', 'grainy', 'am', 'confused', 'large', 'city', 'silouhette', 'located', 'large', 'body', 'water', 'depicted', 'cast', 'photo', 'used', 'plain', 'black', 'cases', 'similar', 'used', 'single', 'DVD', 'releases', 'DVD', 'labels', 'look', 'something', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'home', 'Also', 'little', 'annoying', 'can', 'choose', 'show', 'main', 'menu', 'however', 'show', 'select', 'done', 'next', 'episode', 'strarts', 'playing', 'DVD', 'play', 'option', 'would', 'rather', 'going', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'More', 'annoying', 'episode', 'play', 'time', 'not', 'start', '0', 'seconds', 'first', 'episode', 'disc', 'normally', 'would', 'example', 'episode', 'one', 'was', '49:26', 'mins', 'episode', '2', 'would', 'start', '49:27', 'episode', '2', 'were', '48:00', 'mins', 'episode', '3', 'would', 'start', '1', '39:28', 'thus', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'episode', 'almost', 'done', 'not', 'like', 'have', 'idea', 'Naturally', 'packaging', 'not', 'up', 'major', 'studio', 'standards', 'TGG', 'Direct', 'came', 'where', 'releasing', 'show', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'hope', 'follow', 'up', 'rest', 'Season', 'sets', 'priced', 'reasonably', 'did', 'one']",N/A
