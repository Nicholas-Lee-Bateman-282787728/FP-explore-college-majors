Bought this double header DVD set because it had two films for about the price of one! I'm cheap!""Spies Like Us"" is a very funny film. Chevy and Dan are terrific together. Donna Dixon (Dan's wife) is beautiful as usual and the gags are all great. Catch Chevy and Dan after their time in the centrifuge! Hilarious! The best part though is seeing Vanessa Angel come out of the tent with Dan near the end of the movie. She is unbelieveable in her bra! What a set!She was just starting out then and was young and gorgeous!Bob Hope's cameo is short but funny. Bernie Casey's salute is outstanding! The film is a little dated now but for it's time the political humor was excelent!Enjoy!",5,Spies and Craziness!,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,746,"['Nothing', 'Trouble', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'good', 'either', 'Bought', 'double', 'header', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'two', 'films', 'price', 'one', ""'m"", 'cheap', 'Spies', 'Us', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'Chevy', 'Dan', 'are', 'terrific', 'together', 'Donna', 'Dixon', 'Dan', 'wife', 'beautiful', 'usual', 'gags', 'are', 'great', 'Catch', 'Chevy', 'Dan', 'time', 'centrifuge', 'Hilarious', 'best', 'part', 'though', 'seeing', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'come', 'tent', 'Dan', 'end', 'movie', 'unbelieveable', 'bra', 'What', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'then', 'was', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'cameo', 'short', 'funny', 'Bernie', 'Casey', 'salute', 'outstanding', 'film', 'little', 'dated', 'now', 'time', 'political', 'humor', 'was', 'excelent', 'Enjoy']",N/A
