473242,A5LNIF5QPQ0G6,6305692629,Brian A. Gross,"[3, 4]","My Son the Fanatic is a queer and original coming-of-age piece; written primarily from the parents' perspective about their collegiate son's  rebelliousness against mass culture and his libertine father, and his  retreat into a stark conservatism.Written by ethnic Pakistani, but  native Englander, Hanif Kureishi, he defies stereotype with this adaptation  of his own work.  Not unlike the way Bill Buckley usurps the old canard  about conservatives' lack of humor, Kureishi fleshes out his characters in  most unexpected ways, with wit and style.  It is the story of Parved, who  emigrated his family from Pakistan thirty years earlier to give them the  liberty and opportunity.  He is a progressive who listens to jazz/blues and  enjoys a stiff drink.  He swore off the religious teaching of his youth to  pursue work and is now finding his son, Farid, is rebelling against the  excesses of immoral capitalism and sliding deeper into fundamentalist  Islamic teaching.  He's an evangelical Muslim, trying to convert his father  amongst others, and even invites a holy teacher (Maulvi) to stay in his  father's home.Parved makes his living as a cabbie and moonlights as a  transport for a prostitute named Battina.  She is his only true  communication source, as his wife is cold and his son is growing ever  distant.  Around her, he can loop his thumbs through his suspenders, puff  his tummy out, and tell proud stories of his son and his schooling.  Battina is understanding of him and has a bond with Parved, nothing like a  typical pimp/harlot relationship.  They move in different circles to be  sure, he in his middle-aged ethnic class (with a best friend that is a  restaurateur) and she living in a house with desperate - and drug addicted  - streetwalkers.Though it doesn't sound it, the piece is not without  moments of humor: while Farid organizes his jingoistic disturbances against  the imperial Western government, Parved gets a call from a German  businessman who wants to procure Battina's services.  He promises to be  right there as the sounds of a revolution ring from his kitchen.The film  touches on cultural relativism and imperialism in a way that would be  impossible for a team that was not made up of immigrants and I regret to  report that Miramax distributed the film terribly.  A film this unique  needs a dexterous touch when marketing and the Oscar-gobblers at Miramax  dropped the ball on this.  A shame too, because My Son The Fanatic is a  witty, well-written and finely acted piece of work, that few have seen.",4,"A Fanatic Son, A Permissive Father, A Fine Film",966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,2547,"['Son', 'Fanatic', 'queer', 'original', 'coming-of-age', 'piece', 'written', 'primarily', 'parents', 'perspective', 'collegiate', 'son', 'rebelliousness', 'mass', 'culture', 'libertine', 'father', 'retreat', 'stark', 'conservatism.Written', 'ethnic', 'Pakistani', 'native', 'Englander', 'Hanif', 'Kureishi', 'stereotype', 'adaptation', 'own', 'work', 'Not', 'way', 'Bill', 'Buckley', 'usurps', 'old', 'canard', 'conservatives', 'lack', 'humor', 'Kureishi', 'out', 'characters', 'most', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'wit', 'style', 'story', 'Parved', 'who', 'emigrated', 'family', 'Pakistan', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'give', 'liberty', 'opportunity', 'progressive', 'who', 'jazz/blues', 'stiff', 'drink', 'swore', 'off', 'religious', 'teaching', 'youth', 'pursue', 'work', 'now', 'finding', 'son', 'Farid', 'rebelling', 'excesses', 'immoral', 'capitalism', 'sliding', 'deeper', 'fundamentalist', 'Islamic', 'teaching', 'evangelical', 'Muslim', 'trying', 'convert', 'father', 'amongst', 'others', 'even', 'holy', 'teacher', 'Maulvi', 'stay', 'father', 'home.Parved', 'living', 'cabbie', 'moonlights', 'transport', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Battina', 'only', 'true', 'communication', 'source', 'wife', 'cold', 'son', 'growing', 'ever', 'distant', 'can', 'loop', 'thumbs', 'suspenders', 'puff', 'tummy', 'tell', 'proud', 'stories', 'son', 'schooling', 'Battina', 'understanding', 'bond', 'Parved', 'nothing', 'typical', 'pimp/harlot', 'relationship', 'move', 'different', 'circles', 'be', 'sure', 'middle-aged', 'ethnic', 'class', 'best', 'friend', 'restaurateur', 'living', 'house', 'desperate', 'drug', 'addicted', ""n't"", 'sound', 'piece', 'not', 'moments', 'humor', 'Farid', 'jingoistic', 'disturbances', 'imperial', 'Western', 'government', 'Parved', 'call', 'German', 'businessman', 'who', 'procure', 'Battina', 'services', 'be', 'right', 'there', 'sounds', 'revolution', 'ring', 'kitchen.The', 'film', 'touches', 'cultural', 'relativism', 'imperialism', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'team', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'immigrants', 'regret', 'report', 'Miramax', 'distributed', 'film', 'terribly', 'film', 'unique', 'dexterous', 'touch', 'when', 'marketing', 'Oscar-gobblers', 'Miramax', 'dropped', 'ball', 'shame', 'too', 'My', 'Son', 'Fanatic', 'witty', 'well-written', 'finely', 'acted', 'piece', 'work', 'few', 'have', 'seen']",N/A
473243,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,6305692629,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[2, 2]","""My Son the Fanatic,"" writer Hanif Kureishi and director Udayan Prasad's 1997 film about Farid, an English-born Pakistani boy who becomes a devout Muslim who firebombs a brothel, is a train wreck. Its art is shoddy and its politics are repugnant. But Om Puri as Parvez, the taxi-driver father of the fanatic son, gives a performance that is solid gold. Rachel Griffiths, as a prostitute, is brilliant.Parvez (Om Puri) is a taxi driver in a depressed English mill town. He befriends Bettina (Griffiths) a prostitute. He works for a monstrous German sex tourist named S---t. Parvez's son, Farid, is engaged to the lovely Madeline Fingerhut, daughter of the chief of police.  Farid breaks off his engagement and becomes the Muslim ""fanatic"" of the title. Parvez tries to stop his son's fanaticism. He also enters into an affair with Bettina, the prostitute, who loves him.""My Son the Fanatic"" struggles to combine several disparate themes and subplots. It is never successful because it never probes deeply enough into any of its material. The film ends ambiguously; the viewer has no idea how any of the story strands will resolve themselves.The two most powerful features of the film, the only real reason to see the film, are Om Puri and Rachel Griffiths. They are very different and they are both powerhouses. Om Puri feels like a beating heart. He is totally believable, irresistibly lovable, and charismatic. Puri had smallpox when he was two and his face is cratered. These scars just make you stare at him all the more.Rachel Griffiths is perfect as Bettina, the stereotypical ""hooker with a heart of gold."" She's smart, and she's in pain.In spite of their age and culture differences, Parvez and Bettina's love is completely believable and poignant. It's clear that Parvez's wife Minoo is not providing him with passion, respect, or either emotional or physical intimacy. She calls him a ""useless idiot,"" and at one point it appears she may leave him to go back to Pakistan. While Parvez resists his son's fanaticism, Minoo supports it.You really want to know - can a man fall in love with a prostitute? Parvez's friend Fizzy reminds him cruelly that Bettina has been penetrated by thousands of men. Could Parvez ever get over that? Could Parvez and Minoo separate in a way that worked for them both and spared them both great pain? Could Bettina settle down with one man? Could the couple survive the disdain of respectable people? Again, the chemistry between Parvez and Bettina is so compelling you really want the film to attempt to answer any of these questions. In fact, it answers none. Sadly, Parvez and Bettina are merely Hanif Kureishi's little wind-up toys. He has zero respect or affection for his own characters. Kureishi created Parvez and Bettina just to make his own, repugnant, political point. They are agitprop.With the exception of Madeline Fingerhut, who is onscreen for about 120 seconds, every last Westerner the innocent Muslims encounter is a racist, a prostitute, or a monster. The thrust of ""My Son the Fanatic"" is this. Innocent, decent Pakistani Muslims immigrate to England and are confronted by orgies, naked women selling their bodies in the streets, racism, violence, and booze. The film is graphic and disgusting. There are gratuitous scenes of Bettina being used by her johns. The German sex tourist S- is depicted abusing men and women and hosting orgies. There is no logic in this; this man is shown to be ridiculously wealthy. A sex tourist with that kind of money would not travel to some grim northern English mill town.S--, the German sex tourist for whom Parvez works, is named after feces. He is utterly disgusting. There are graphic scenes of his exploitation of Bettina. Later, she is shown with bruises from his beatings. He also beats Parvez. When Parvez goes out, he is cruelly mocked by an English comedian. There is no other English life depicted in ""My Son the Fanatic."" Not a single English person is kind to children or animals. The English are all violent, sexually perverse, racist scum. Farid becomes a fanatic after Madeline's father is rude to him. ""You are the only pig I've ever wanted to eat,"" Farid tells his future father-in-law. All this graphic perversion is thrust into the viewer's face to emphasize: innocent, decent Muslims are forced by Western ugliness to become terrorists.Okay, let's rejoin planet Earth, shall we? On May 21, 2013, the BBC reported on 54 separate child sex slave rings in England run by Pakistani men. The descriptions of the activities of these gangs are nightmarish. Western Civilization did not corrupt these men; their corruption was already installed. And as for the charge that racism forces otherwise innocent men to become fanatics; please see Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarneav, two beloved, funded, coddled, immigrants who arrived in the US as ""refugees."" The refuge the US gave these men was used by them to murder innocents.The London Times named Hanif Kureishi one of ""The 50 greatest British writers since 1945."" Given the shoddiness of the plotting and characterization of ""My Son the Fanatic,"" and its skewed politics, one has to wonder why.",2,"Shoddy Art, Repugnant Politics, Brilliant Puri and

473244,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305692629,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","I have to admit that I was curious about this DVD.  It has gotten the thumbs up from Roger Ebert and a comment from the LA Times but one of the things that prevented me from purchasing this DVD is the lack of any  special feature.  For any DVD purchaser, a DVD with hardly anything is bad  but for a movie purchaser, you just hope that the price you pay for the DVD  that the movie is worth watching.  &quot;my son the fanatic&quot; is one of  those movies that I have to say...is worth watching.For many foreign  immigrants, a battle between the old and the young is the teachings of the  old country and the accepting of the country you now live in.  I lived  through it with my own family but the thing with this movie, the son is the  one who wants to go back to the conservative beliefs of Pakistan and the  father that left the country to have a better life.That was interesting  to me and the way the movie played the friction between the family and the  life of the confused father, Parvez not knowing how to deal with his son  until he is forced too.  His love for his family but also knowing what he  wants and why he left his country is interesting.You also see a little  of the racial tension in this movie which I'm glad they covered in the  movie.Overall, this movie between beliefs, loyalty and moral decisions  is where I give the movie it's credits and how it approaches each of them.  Parvez is taken from one point to the other really quickly and you wonder  if this poor man would go mad.A really good movie but unfortunately,  this is a DVD review.  The color is fine and since it's a dialogue movie,  you're not going to hear special effects.  The low point of this DVD which  scores this slightly above average movie is the DVD itself.  No extras, no  special features and one of the few times I give a DVD on it's lack of  extras an F.  No trailers, nothing.  If you want to see a pretty cool movie  on clash of cultures, I recommend this movie on DVD but if extras concern  you, the DVD will be a letdown.",4,"my son the fanatic DVD Review - Movie is good, but the DVD..",960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,2030,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'curious', 'DVD', 'gotten', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'comment', 'LA', 'Times', 'one', 'things', 'prevented', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'lack', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'purchaser', 'DVD', 'hardly', 'anything', 'bad', 'movie', 'purchaser', 'just', 'hope', 'price', 'pay', 'DVD', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'quot', 'son', 'fanatic', 'quot', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'worth', 'watching.For', 'many', 'foreign', 'immigrants', 'battle', 'old', 'young', 'teachings', 'old', 'country', 'accepting', 'country', 'now', 'live', 'lived', 'own', 'family', 'thing', 'movie', 'son', 'one', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'conservative', 'beliefs', 'Pakistan', 'father', 'left', 'country', 'have', 'better', 'was', 'interesting', 'way', 'movie', 'played', 'friction', 'family', 'life', 'confused', 'father', 'Parvez', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'deal', 'son', 'forced', 'too', 'love', 'family', 'also', 'knowing', 'what', 'why', 'left', 'country', 'interesting.You', 'also', 'see', 'little', 'racial', 'tension', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'covered', 'movie.Overall', 'movie', 'beliefs', 'loyalty', 'moral', 'decisions', 'where', 'give', 'movie', 'credits', 'how', 'Parvez', 'taken', 'one', 'point', 'other', 'really', 'quickly', 'wonder', 'poor', 'man', 'would', 'go', 'mad.A', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'DVD', 'review', 'color', 'fine', 'dialogue', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'hear', 'special', 'effects', 'low', 'point', 'DVD', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'give', 'DVD', 'lack', 'extras', 'F.', 'No', 'trailers', 'nothing', 'want', 'see', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'clash', 'cultures', 'recommend', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'concern', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'letdown']",N/A

It was hyped as a &quot;funny&quot; film, but I did not laugh much, though it is very very wry.The story takes place in London, England and most of the characters are Pakistani immigrants or  their children. Two exceptions are the Scottish(?) prostitute played by  Rachel Griffins (Betinna, aka Sandra) and the German businessman played by  Stellen Skaarsgard. If you have any problems understanding  accents this film could drive you mad. The German business man says &quot;I  speak better English than you&quot; to the Pakistanni taxi driver, and  since he has a heavy German accent be warned.Although the story takes  place among Pakistanni immigrants living in modern Britain, it could have  been any non-English group of immigrants with 'different' religious  convictions (Mennonites, Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormans). These folks  just happen to be Muslim.Although assimilation is the background  issue, the story is more complex. The core issue the film explores is  &quot;What is a good man?&quot; At one point, Parvez the father says to his  son Farid, &quot;There are many ways to be a good man.&quot;The son is  unhappy with his life as a second generation Muslim living in London, and  turns to what he believes are his roots. The father abandoned these roots  long ago, and has no inclination to revisit them. The two of them  inevitably clash.Eventually, the son discovers his father has a very  unorthodox relationship with a prostitute named Bettina. And, the father is  involved in activities the son describes as 'pimping.' It's hard not to  sympathize with the son's disillusionment and disappointment, and yet the  son seems bent on taking up a new life style that is equally harsh where  women are concerned.Is it better to be a man who helps his female  friend the whore acquire clients, or better to be the man who spits in the  faces of women, burns down brothels, and makes his mother enshroud herself  and eat alone in the kitchen?

473246,A328S9RN3U5M68,6305692629,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","MY SON THE FANATIC is a small scale film made in 1998 about the problems of cross culture assimilation between Pakistanis and the British - or rather between Muslim and Christian - that packs a powerful punch in the understanding of current clashes similar to the film's story that are so keenly in focus today. Based on a short story by Hanif Kureishi (who also adapted the story to a screenplay) and directed by the highly respected Udayan Prasad, this film is blessed with a fine cast of actors who make some of the more improbable aspects quite warmly credible.Parvez (the always fine Om Puri) slept through his Muslim education in Pakistan and moved to England with his wife Minoo (Gopi Desai) where he has been a taxi cab driver for 25 years while his co-immigrants such as his best friend Fizzy (Harish Patel) have become rich entrepreneurs.  Parvez and Minoo have a young son Farid (Akbar Kurtha) who is a bit unsettled as a Pakistani adjusting to life in capitalistic England and has found a girlfriend Madeline (Sarah-Jane Potts) who happens to be the daughter of the Chief Police Inspector Fingerhut (Geoffrey Bateman).  Despite the fact that Parvez and his wife would prefer Farid marry a Pakistani girl they consent to an engagement party, a turning point for the politically tenuous Farid.  When Farid observes how the Fingerhut family snubs his Pakistani parents and background he explodes and instead joins a fundamentalist Muslim group, pledging his life to stamping out porn, drugs, evil, etc.Parvez attempts reconciliation with his wildly fanatical son but the only person with whom he can communicate is a hooker named Bettina/Sandra (Rachel Griffiths)  who has a heart of gold and is only in the Profession to make enough money to become a teacher.  Parvez is a driver for a pimp service and he is assigned to escort a wealthy smarmy German Schitz (Stellan Skarsgrd) through a series of encounters, encounters that involve Bettina among others.  But along the way Bettina softens to Parvez, listens to his anguish about his son, and eventually becomes Parvez' paramour.  When Farid's fundamentalist group is attacking the brothel where Bettina works he discovers his father's situation and is enraged: Parvez, Farid and Minoo must come to an understanding - and it is this manner of coping that provides a very touching ending to the film.The story holds its own as a movie, but the underlying content is pungent, intelligent, perceptive, insightful and very cogent.  Each member of the cast is excellent but Om Puri proves once again that he can carry a film with a questionable character strongly on his shoulders.

473248,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6305692629,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 8]","The theme of immigrant children rejecting traditional values is a common one.  But in this 1997 British gem, there's a twist.  This screenplay, by Hanif Kuresshi, tells a story of a Pakistani-British taxicab driver whose only son reverts to Moslem fundamentalism much to his father's displeasure. It's a modern story, and we've all become painfully aware of these issues lately.Om Puri, with his weathered pock-marked face, has the ability to create a character that is easy to identify with.  He's a foreigner, the victim of racial prejudice.  He has also become alienated from his family.  And yet, he is bursting with vitality and is full of wisdom. When his son breaks his engagement with an English girl and turns to fundamentalism, he's horrified as it is against the basic principles of the secular life he has chosen for himself.  He has nobody to turn to as a friend with the exception of Rachel Griffiths, cast in the role of a prostitute he chauffeurs around.  She, too, is alienated, and as their relationship grows, the story become more complex.Many of the scenes are shot inside the cab, and even though it took me a few minutes to get adjusted to the fact that the driver's seat is on the right in England, it really gave me the feeling of what a cabdriver's day-to-day life is like.  The cross-cultural conflicts are sharp and grating as the son invites a visiting holy man to stay in their house and the young extremists demonstrate for moral decency.  I could certainly identify with the father's dilemma as he grappled with his own complex moral choices.  There's gentle humor too, and it adds to the humanity of the film, although I could never call it a comedy.  It's simply an offbeat story with some unlikely people dealing with very real issues.  Definitely recommended.",5,The gentle humor adds to the humanity of this fine film,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,1795,"['theme', 'immigrant', 'children', 'rejecting', 'traditional', 'values', 'common', 'one', '1997', 'British', 'gem', 'twist', 'screenplay', 'Hanif', 'Kuresshi', 'story', 'Pakistani-British', 'taxicab', 'driver', 'only', 'son', 'reverts', 'Moslem', 'fundamentalism', 'much', 'father', 'displeasure', 'modern', 'story', ""'ve"", 'become', 'painfully', 'aware', 'issues', 'lately.Om', 'Puri', 'weathered', 'pock-marked', 'face', 'ability', 'create', 'character', 'easy', 'identify', 'foreigner', 'victim', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'also', 'become', 'alienated', 'family', 'yet', 'bursting', 'vitality', 'full', 'wisdom', 'When', 'son', 'engagement', 'English', 'girl', 'fundamentalism', 'horrified', 'basic', 'principles', 'secular', 'life', 'chosen', 'nobody', 'turn', 'friend', 'exception', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'cast', 'role', 'prostitute', 'around', 'too', 'alienated', 'relationship', 'grows', 'story', 'become', 'more', 'complex.Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'cab', 'even', 'took', 'few', 'minutes', 'get', 'adjusted', 'fact', 'driver', 'seat', 'right', 'England', 'really', 'gave', 'feeling', 'what', 'cabdriver', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'cross-cultural', 'conflicts', 'are', 'sharp', 'grating', 'son', 'visiting', 'holy', 'man', 'stay', 'house', 'young', 'extremists', 'demonstrate', 'moral', 'decency', 'could', 'certainly', 'identify', 'father', 'dilemma', 'grappled', 'own', 'complex', 'moral', 'choices', 'gentle', 'humor', 'too', 'humanity', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'call', 'comedy', 'simply', 'offbeat', 'story', 'unlikely', 'people', 'dealing', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'Definitely', 'recommended']",N/A
473249,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,6305692629,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 0]","This charming film of intercultural trouble in 1997 Bradford, England, an old textile industrial town near Newcastle, is an artfully presented discussion of several points of view on ""how to be a good man"".The story revolves around an immigrant Pakistani couple with one college-age son, all living from the father's taxi job income these 25 years.  His first five years in England were spent in a factory, hence his recruitment from abroad, and he explains this to his new special passenger, a German middle-aged sardonic man with money to spend and a big appetite for partying, drinking and women of the night.  We viewers see the regular night driving work of an older Pakistani, face mottled with old acne scars, married to a quiet and demure, traditionally dressed housewife.  He shows us rapidly that he is an easy-going man, who enjoys talkative passengers, and he likes to play tourguide and show off the decaying industrial town to them.  He likes jokes, picturesque turns of phrases from the old country (presumably?  ""there's a wasp down your gullet"" to his son when the son goes bezerk shouting in a fine restaurant.)His wife is portrayed as slightly depressed, sullen, obsessed with her only child, confined to a typical rowhouse all day, and fed up with her husband, who she is convinced loves her no more and is beginning to have an affair with a local prostitute.  She is a sweet-looking woman, I'd say, a long-suffering type, and appears much younger than her rougher-looking but jollier husband.Meanwhile, there's a son good-looking enough that he'd worked as a model, who is obsessed with his clothes and ironing them, who's academically good enough to be studying accountancy at university.  His parents live for him, that is clear to any older viewer, but the son is oblivious to his father's love.  The parents are very excited that he is engaged to a local English bank teller, the daughter of the police chief, and they're planning a big party for the announcement.  They apparently have no objection that the son marries outside the faith or his ethnic group, in fact, the father seems delighted whenever he talks of it to his passengers.The father loves to hang out at home in the basement (as we Yanks would say, is it a cellar? well, down below, a storage area of the house) with his own phonograph and collection of early jazz, especially Louis Armstrong.  The lyrics of the songs permeate throughout the house, full of sexual innuendo of the 1920's and 1930's.  If the wife is disapproving of it, she only brings it up much later in the film, when she says it's too ""trumpet-y"".This bit is to show us viewers that the father's an atheist, who's embraced Western culture and music, sexual freedom; and that he enjoys dealing with the johns and prostitutes who are often the night customers in Bradford.He sees the good in everyone; generally, he is a very impressive and wise man who understands others' anger.Well, that is how the film begins, and the plot moves quickly in:  the son becomes dissatisfied with himself, with ""capitalism"" (i.e. his studies in accountancy and consumerism generally), and above all, angry that his fiancee's parents cannot and will not accept him.  Then he uses this anger against all of England and Western people, to use radical ideas of Muslim (Pakistani brand) fundamentalism, to protest against the atheistic life around him.  The root of his conversion seems to be simple:  his love has been confounded by the girl's father, a story as old as Romeo and Juliet.His new friends, and he himself, adopt traditional male Pakistani clothing and caps, shun women, even to the point that when they eat (on the floor, of course) of the living room, his mother becomes a servant bringing food, but cannot eat with them, only alone in the kitchen.  Since the father's often at work, he discovers this only later by coming upon it, and seeing that his wife has gone along with the son's ""new"" ideas.This is a film that grips your attention, as each character has a role in the conflict between ""East"" and ""West"", including the very promiscuous German businessman who uses the father to arrange for prostitutes at his big party.  All are shown to be pawns in the culture, who do not seem to know that they're playing roles imposed on them.  The tensions between everyone mount very rapidly, ending in male violence against the vulnerable females, and the father is heartbroken by the collapse of his family.His son moves out to be with his new ""community"", and the wife, feeling unloved altogether, packs up for Pakistan.  The father is left alone in his Bradford house, awaiting their individual returns, if they would realize not only their errors, but that he loves them.The writer of the script is masterful in showing us that love, true love and caring, is the way to reunite people.  But it speaks to the much bigger issues ripping apart England today, 14 years after the film was made.  The Muslim presence grows, and the fundamentalism gets much stronger, and it's leading to more anti-social violence, to the point of blowing up trains.  The protagonists are young males who grew up in England, not their immigrant parents.  The parents are shown to be happy to be able to support a family, coming from dirtpoor origins.  Their hopes for their only child's success is far beyond that of a normal English family:  it become almost their raison d'etre for suffering through cold winters, low-level jobs, and general intolerance.It's interesting that no young women are shown getting interested in religion; if anything, they're shown in the pubs and nightlife to be going quite the opposite way.  It's enraging the Pakistani-English young men, although they are not shown to be kind and useful to the community other than studying, discussing, pondering and waiting for females to pour them more tea.""There's more than one way to be a good man"", says the father to the son's backside.  ""Remember that"".Sitting here in San Francisco, where I work in a similar job to this father, driving tourbuses with international tourists, I see that the men are often the most religious and righteous of my customers, from all faiths.  I wonder about this.  It is so much easier to see a splinter in the other (woman's) eye than the plank in one's own.  If men are taught that women are evil, because they are ""tempting"", then their whole view of the planet is distorted as a place of sin, temptation and evil, with the source of it all walking freely about, torturing them.  This is found in Judaism, Christianity and then later in the Muslim faith.  That the men themselves cannot see themselves as sources of evil is a very strange blindness indeed.The father himself has long been in love with one of the prostitutes.  He's been giving her rides home for years, and they've grown fond of each other, in what appears to be a father-daughter way.  She is young and good-looking , he appears old and fairly ugly.  Yet when this long-term friendship begins to develop into something else later in the film, one of the lines that made me laugh is: ""My wife is too ugly.""  My (male) friend watching with me didn't know why I laughed.  It was obvious to any female:  his wife is fine, it is he who is ugly and he who reviles himself, who wishes that he were desirable to a woman.  That seems to be the essence of the Muslim fanatical view of women.  Isn't the son perverted with anger by female rejection?  Could it be that the mixing of Muslim men into Western culture is producing extreme frustration that they cannot ""have"" the Western women, whom they consider good-looking?",4,"Cultures have to mix

It's intriquing way of combining comedy and drama earned it the Official Selection.&quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot; gives us a peak to the life of Parvez, an Indian-Brittish taxi-driver, who doesn't care much about his roots, but is very fond of the western way of life. He befriends with the lower class of his town, eventually falling in love with a prostitute.His son, Farid, represents a very different kind of thinking. He opposes the western way of living recklessly and seeks order. This leads to him leaving his English fianc&eacute; and joining a group of islamic fundamentalists.The film that begins as a light comedy turns into serious drama as Parvez and Farid collide in their different ways of viewing life. Parvez's worry about his son and his long-dead marriage to his traditional Indian wife who doesn't approve of him mingling with criminals and prostitutes etc. offers us meaningfull moments, wich carry the deep characters through situations.The film speaks for open mindedness, showing that a prostitute can be a good person and that a religious fanatic is always someones child. It offers much to think about while questioning common prejudiousness.The adequate acting performances and Udayan Prasad's talented directing support Hanif Kureishi's insightfull script, wich unfortunately, or perhaps intentionally, is left a bit superficial.&quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot; shows us that cultures can indeed intermix, and I recommend it strongly, especially at these times.To quote Parvez: &quot;Farid tells me cultures can't be combined.

473253,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6305692629,Shashank Tripathi,"[11, 11]","Made in 1997 (ps: pre-911) it is remarkable how a movie so simple in its narrative, and so in the shadow of critical cinema, could depict such smack-dab nuances of eastern immigrants at odds with a western setting or how the cultural assimilation of trans-national immigrants doesn't always look like a rainbow colored day at the beach.But despite that seemingly ho-hum central tack, there are many conflicts studied very poignantly -- modern versus mediaeval, father versus son, fidelity versus emotional satisfaction, ethnic conservatism (ok, fanaticism) versus open minded cosmopolitanism, Good House Husband versus Bad Man Who Befriends Prostitutes, Decent Living Taxi Driver versus Someone Who Became Filthy Rich...and each is sublte yet hard-hitting in its simplicity.Without giving away too much about the plot, there is no ordinary character in the movie, certainly no ordinary Muslim. The father (Parvez, played wonderfully by Om Puri) is a cabbie who flirts about in a relationship with a streetside floozy whom he finds more uplifting (no pun intended) than his standpat wife back home who disapproves of his free-wheeling ways and even finds his interests in jazz ""too trumpety"". The other Muslim, the son, is at loggerheads with his peers in throes of non-acceptance and instead gets inveigled into Islamic fundamentalism as an escape. This contrast is very, very credible, real and amusing.Particularly noteworthy are Udayan's idiosynchratic implications about what constitutes ""right"" or ""wrong"" character. Parvez's prostitute girlfriend has a loving heart, a sharp mind and a vivacious presence despite her ostracization from the Good People Club. The son and his other right-wing Islamic acolyte buddies come off as annoyingly childish in a thoughtless ""promiscuity"" of their own.For instance, they invite a Pakistani Maulvi to sermonize/""guide"", and a hilarious TRUE moment pops up when the Maulvi requests the non-approving father for some help with his immigration into England.Another VERY, VERY quiet 5 second scene that leaves an indelible impact is the depiction of male chauvinism dominating orthodox Islam where Parvez's wife is huddled in the kitchen for dinner, behind a closed door, and refuses to come out to dine with the men of the house in fear of doing something ""inappropriate"" in the presence of the supposed Maulvi.The movie has many light-hearted moments and the cinematography is unexpectedly stunning. All this emotional, moral tussle between father, son, wife, romantic interest etc leads to a denouement that is hardly a resolution of sorts but is deeply moving. Everyone makes a choice (and I found the choice of Parvez's wife particularly startling) in favor of freedom from personal and social shackles. Made me think for days and recommend this movie to everyone I care about.This is probably not your average East Meets West type ethnic take and certainly not a look into typical Muslim life as it makes no pretense of being. Yet, as a movie that tackles very touching, very identifiable themes of how simple convictions about life and love can sway people into/away from relationships, it comes HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED from me.",5,A TRUE MARVEL WITH COMPLEX BUT REAL CHARACTERS,1055030400,"06 8, 2003",2003,3178,"['Made', '1997', 'ps', 'pre-911', 'remarkable', 'how', 'movie', 'so', 'simple', 'narrative', 'so', 'shadow', 'critical', 'cinema', 'could', 'depict', 'such', 'smack-dab', 'nuances', 'eastern', 'immigrants', 'odds', 'western', 'setting', 'how', 'cultural', 'assimilation', 'trans-national', 'immigrants', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'rainbow', 'colored', 'day', 'beach.But', 'seemingly', 'ho-hum', 'central', 'tack', 'are', 'many', 'conflicts', 'studied', 'very', 'poignantly', 'modern', 'versus', 'mediaeval', 'father', 'versus', 'son', 'fidelity', 'emotional', 'satisfaction', 'ethnic', 'conservatism', 'ok', 'fanaticism', 'versus', 'open', 'minded', 'cosmopolitanism', 'Good', 'House', 'Husband', 'versus', 'Bad', 'Man', 'Who', 'Befriends', 'Prostitutes', 'Decent', 'Living', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Someone', 'Who', 'Became', 'Filthy', 'Rich', 'sublte', 'yet', 'hard-hitting', 'simplicity.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'ordinary', 'character', 'movie', 'certainly', 'ordinary', 'Muslim', 'father', 'Parvez', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Om', 'Puri', 'cabbie', 'who', 'relationship', 'streetside', 'floozy', 'whom', 'more', 'uplifting', 'pun', 'intended', 'standpat', 'wife', 'back', 'home', 'who', 'free-wheeling', 'ways', 'even', 'interests', 'jazz', 'too', 'trumpety', 'other', 'Muslim', 'son', 'loggerheads', 'peers', 'throes', 'non-acceptance', 'instead', 'inveigled', 'Islamic', 'fundamentalism', 'escape', 'contrast', 'very', 'very', 'credible', 'real', 'amusing.Particularly', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'Udayan', 'idiosynchratic', 'implications', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'character', 'Parvez', 'prostitute', 'girlfriend', 'loving', 'heart', 'sharp', 'mind', 'vivacious', 'presence', 'ostracization', 'Good', 'People', 'Club', 'son', 'other', 'right-wing', 'Islamic', 'acolyte', 'buddies', 'come', 'off', 'annoyingly', 'childish', 'thoughtless', 'promiscuity', 'own.For', 'instance', 'invite', 'Pakistani', 'Maulvi', 'sermonize/', 'guide', 'hilarious', 'TRUE', 'moment', 'up', 'when', 'Maulvi', 'non-approving', 'father', 'help', 'immigration', 'England.Another', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'quiet', '5', 'second', 'scene', 'indelible', 'impact', 'depiction', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'dominating', 'orthodox', 'Islam', 'where', 'Parvez', 'wife', 'huddled', 'kitchen', 'dinner', 'closed', 'door', 'come', 'out', 'dine', 'men', 'house', 'fear', 'doing', 'something', 'inappropriate', 'presence', 'supposed', 'Maulvi.The', 'movie', 'many', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'cinematography', 'unexpectedly', 'stunning', 'emotional', 'moral', 'tussle', 'father', 'son', 'wife', 'romantic', 'interest', 'etc', 'denouement', 'hardly', 'resolution', 'sorts', 'deeply', 'moving', 'Everyone', 'choice', 'found', 'choice', 'Parvez', 'wife', 'particularly', 'startling', 'favor', 'freedom', 'personal', 'social', 'shackles', 'Made', 'think', 'days', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'care', 'about.This', 'probably', 'not', 'average', 'East', 'Meets', 'West', 'type', 'ethnic', 'take', 'certainly', 'not', 'look', 'typical', 'Muslim', 'life', 'pretense', 'being', 'Yet', 'movie', 'very', 'touching', 'very', 'identifiable', 'themes', 'how', 'simple', 'convictions', 'life', 'love', 'can', 'sway', 'people', 'into/away', 'relationships', 'HIGHLY', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

But in my American winter of 2002, this film strikes deep. I've been to the Docklands, Hackney &amp; Vauxhall - this film captures the base racism &amp; grime of marginal London, never as an excuse, but as a living fact, and never a wall to what really matters. Love, Truth, or what seems to be. There isn't a Soul in this film who isn't searching for those same things. But sadly, they search for it with very different dreams.The beauty of this film is its careful study of loneliness, and how a handful of isolated poor forgotten people dream in so very different ways. Some look for it in drugs, prostitution, simply surviving, or the Purity of Islamic Fundamentalism. And/Or just simply Living, and making it Work. In this movie, all moral choices collide, the participants are that close to making it work. None of them are wholly wrong.I'll reveal no more, just to say that the camera-work is lively and excellent. The pacing is good, the message is so alive, this film deserves to be seen. It raises troubling questions about Terrorism and Fanaticism, and answers none. But that is the honest confused place we all find ourselves. It's 2002, it's up to your heart where you go from here...
