I had not expected much, and instead found a very polished (and scarey)story that achieved its effects through fine writing, editing, and acting, as opposed to the usual cheap thrills.  I don't want to say too much about the story, because I don't want to give it away.  Suffice it to say that a young woman, Kate Hudson (who did a fine job), goes to do home nurse assistance for an elderly man who has had a stroke, at a big creepy house deep in the swamps adjacent to New Orleans.  Everyone in my family said the same thing when we saw the house, which was that this was obviously a girl that never watched scarey films -- you could just see that no good was going to happen in that house!  The back story is that something awful happened there in the early part of the 20th century that culminated in a lynching of two household servants, a man named Justify and his wife Mama Cecile.  They just happened to be big ""hoodoo"" people.  Creepy stuff starts as soon as Hudson comes to stay.  She begins to suspect some kind of magic is being used to harm the old man.  Slowly, she is drawn in to believe in this kind of stuff.  The denoument is unexpected and falls quickly and well.

Set in pre-Katrina New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta (there is an excellent use of its locations), it stars Kate Hudson as a caregiver who is given the job of nursing the invalid husband (John Hurt, who, playing a recent stroke victim, doesn't speak a word in the whole film) of Gena Rowlands, who live in a creepy old house in an old plantation. Soon it becomes clear that the Hurt character knows something terrible that he is unable to say. This is only the beginning of a very creepy, unsettling thriller. There is a very intelligent final twist, that holds up on second viewing (many viewers, I suspect, will not get the twist on first viewing).

636452,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00005JNY3,Anton Ilinski,"[0, 0]","I had a lot of prejudice against this movie. I thought: well, a new horror (must be like all recent stupid horrors) starring Kate Hudson(?!)... When I started watching I was like ""C'mon, show me something I haven't seen yet"". I was absolutely sure that everything in the film would be secondary, that all the thrills presented there I'd be able to tell right from the very begining. Haunted house? Oh, please... ""Boogeyman"", ""The Grudge""... We've seen it all. The door in the attic clatters itself? Well, it must be some animal jumping at you along with a pinnacle of an uneasy musical theme... So that was my attitude when I started watching. Actually I didn't even want to rent it, but finally persuaded myself since I'm interested in the genre.And I was happy to see the film ended up being totally different from what I expected to see. Kate Hudson (who was always OK for flicks like ""200 cigarettes"", as I thought, but nothing more) was utterly believable here, I have to say I really liked her. John Hurt was brilliant in his silent role (he sure can give you creeps with just one glance of his). New Orleans atmosphere and nature played a big part in ""The Skeleton Key"", all the swamps, those trees... Well, you get my point. And finally the story line appeared to be not recycled at all, it was rather fresh and intriguing. Although the film is not that terrifying and disturbing it manages to surprise you. And while I was thinking the pay-off was pretty predictable (I was partly right, but it doesn't diminish the story though), the finale still surprised me. It didn't only ruin the movie as it often happens, it actually boosted its value. I didn't see it coming, I was surprised and finally had a feeling those were hour and a half spent not in vain. If you're a horror fan you'll be pleased to see ""The Skeleton Key"" while not thinking about it as of a masterpiece. And if you are not you'll still like it, for it is not stupid, it has sense and it's not that scary you won't be able to sleep afterwards. Nice film.",4,NO CHEAP THRILLS.

In many ways, she made this movie. The filming is great projecting an eerie ambience over the whole film.  The special effects are not over the top and add greatly to the film.  The downside has to do with the story.  It left me wanting so much more!  The movie really revolved around two characters from the 1920's, ""Papa Justify"", and ""Mama Ceile."" Yet not too much attention was paid to them.  Their story could have been fleshed out more and would have been even more eerily fascinating.The premise of the movie is that Kate Hudson's character goes to work for an eccentric older lady (Gena Rowlands) to care for her ailing husband (John Hurt).  From there we begin to learn secrets about their relationship and the plantation-style house in southern Louisiana-particularly a room in the attic of the house.This movie doesn't drag and moves along with many twists and turns and the ending is an absolute classic that you didn't see coming.

That's when you figure out just what's been going on and what's going to happen, and it really stinks that you've figured it out. Because the mystery weaved throughout the movie is certainly a good one, a really creepy one, but part of the magic of a thriller or horror movie is the directors/writers ability to keep the mystery a secret until just the right moment. Dang, and this movie was SOOOO close.The movie stars Kate Hudson as Caroline, a hospice worker. She leaves her job because she doesn't like the impersonality of the whole ordeal, ie, old person dies, old person is zipped up in a bag, and then their stuff is thrown out. Where's the caring in that? So she takes a job as a caretaker for an elderly man who has had a stroke. His wife (Gena Rowlands) is also there to help and gives Caroline a skeleton key that opens every creaky door in their creepy Southern, bayou mansion. Caroline soon discovers a door in the attic, containing secrets of magic and ""hoodoo."" (nope, not voodoo! Hoodoo!) But what does this have to do with the house? It's previous inhabitants? The inhabitants now? This is the mystery, and I won't go any further with plot details for fear of giving anything away.Peter Sarsgaard co-stars as a lawyer, and what little bits of the movie he's in are wonderfully effective: his southern drawl makes you like him but it also makes you leery. Very cool. Kate Hudson is great, though her character gets lost in the plot shuffle, and there was a really interesting little story about how her caring for elderly people relates to the relationship she had with her father. If only more thrillers would take the time to develop character in the way they meticulously nitpick the plot... well, we can only dream.

We're glued to the screen for nearly two hours, as things become more mysterious and intriguing. A few times we're treated to a jolt and a revelation, but what closes the film is bound to ruffle a few feathers.Above all, this is a very good movie, with a script that doesn't cheat anyone and doesn't rely on silly gimmicks. Those factors should portend good tidings for its success in its original release, but it will probably become a classic of its kind. The heroine in distress manages to be smarter than the usual stereotype. She wants to explore the surroundings and solve the problem. The problem is she has no idea how bad the situation might be.Kate Hudson makes a very strong impression in this film. She goes beyond the pretty actress to an accomplished performer who matches up to Rowland's intensity. She navigates the film with an ease rarely seen in today's roster of plastic pre-packaged pseudo celebrities. It is refreshing to see an actress make you care for the character that has so often been portrayed as an offensive stereotype. There no gratitude's screaming scenes here.

And if that same person persistently kept picking at it until they found an answer, wouldn't that make it even MORE annoying?  Yes!  Of course!  Because what happens in your home is nobody elses business.As for the Skeleton Key plotline, it stayed consistently ""above average"" for about 70% of the film, and then the last 30 minutes picked up strongly with lots of action and a really good and unpredictable ending.

While The Skelton Key is not quite up there with the best thrillers of recent years (The Sixth Sense comes to mind), it is surprisingly well done, with the final twist coming as a complete surprise to me.This movie is certainly helped a long by its quality cast.  Kate Hudson plays a hospice worker, Caroline, who is hired to help an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) care for her dying husband (a virtually mute John Hurt), with the very underrated Peter Sarsgaard playing the couples' attorney.  The couple lives in a decrepit mansion on the outskirts of New Orleans (obviously pre-Katrina), and Caroline is not in the house long before she starts notice that things are a bit off.  Most notably, her skeleton key, which supposedly opens all of the doors in the house, will not unlock a mysterious door in the attic, and her charge, Ben, seems terrified of something unknown.  As Caroline begins to explore further, she discovers a connection between the house and Hoodoo, a practice related to Voodoo yet even more secretive and magical.This movie does have some flaws, but they are the same flaws found in virtual every horror movie--ie, why does the main character insist on returning to the scary scene time and time again instead of just getting out?  But overall, I found this movie to be sufficiently suspenseful and at times quite creepy (you'll see what I mean when you hear the old record playing...).

I was able it figure out a few things on my own without much trouble be it never stopped me from watching to see if I was right.

636469,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B00005JNY3,Brett Corkins,"[1, 1]","Once again we have another movie that wasn't marketed well. First off, The Skeleton Key isn't very scary, it's suspenseful, movie studios seem to have trouble distinguishing between the two. Despite that, this movie is great, with a strong, believable, central performance.In essence the plot follows Caroline Ellis (Hudson) as she cares for Ben (Hurt). If you're told much more than that you'll halfway know what to expect and that'll just ruin the movie completely.The acting is excellent in The Skeleton Key and that will be the thing that keeps you watching most likely, next to the unraveling plot. Kate Hudson, in my eyes, has yet to put out a poorly acted movie on her behalf, and in here she only furthers her talent. Violet is played eerily perfect by Gena Rowlands, and John Hurt plays the partially paralyzed Ben with ease. While Violet and Ben's lawyer, Luke, is played masterfully by Peter Sarsgaard.I know when The Skeleton Key was being advertised they raved about the ending, and the only thing I'll really say is that while it did surprise me, it also left me wanting something more. But while some movie's endings just completely ruin the entire movie, The Skeleton Key's doesn't, it actually makes sense.Overall I was satisfied moreso than I expected with the outcome of this movie. I was hearing so much about Hoodoo that it made me wary of actually watching this, in the end I'm really glad I watched it. The way the story was presented and how you weren't just given every bit of the plot at the beginning of the movie was a nice touch, it kept you wondering throughout at why there's so much secrecy in that house. I heard somewhere that if you don't go in knowing anything about Hoodoo that you'll enjoy the movie a lot more, and after viewing it, I think that that's probably true.",5,I promise I'll help you,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1806,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'marketed', 'well', 'First', 'Skeleton', 'Key', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'studios', 'seem', 'have', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'two', 'movie', 'great', 'strong', 'believable', 'central', 'performance.In', 'essence', 'plot', 'Caroline', 'Ellis', 'Hudson', 'Ben', 'Hurt', ""'re"", 'told', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'halfway', 'know', 'what', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'just', 'ruin', 'movie', 'completely.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'will', 'be', 'thing', 'watching', 'most', 'likely', 'next', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'eyes', 'yet', 'put', 'out', 'poorly', 'acted', 'movie', 'behalf', 'here', 'only', 'talent', 'Violet', 'played', 'eerily', 'perfect', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'John', 'Hurt', 'partially', 'paralyzed', 'Ben', 'ease', 'Violet', 'Ben', 'lawyer', 'Luke', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard.I', 'know', 'when', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'was', 'being', 'advertised', 'raved', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'really', 'say', 'did', 'surprise', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'something', 'more', 'movie', 'endings', 'just', 'completely', 'ruin', 'entire', 'movie', 'Skeleton', 'Key', ""n't"", 'actually', 'sense.Overall', 'was', 'satisfied', 'moreso', 'expected', 'outcome', 'movie', 'was', 'hearing', 'so', 'much', 'Hoodoo', 'made', 'wary', 'actually', 'watching', 'end', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'watched', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'how', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'given', 'bit', 'plot', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'secrecy', 'house', 'heard', 'somewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'knowing', 'anything', 'Hoodoo', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'viewing', 'think', 'probably', 'true']",N/A

The lack of suspense was due to not knowing the nature of the threat.

The general indifference towards the old, dying and dead seniors is unforgivable and intolerable, so she quits, packs her bags and seeks a more nurturing and rewarding job because her previous occupation was taking its toll on her general well being.She ends up finding a job as a care taker of an older southern gentleman, being hired by his wife, both of whom live in an old plantation mansion situated way out in the middle of a remote swamp on the outskirts of New Orleans. The caretaker's best friend questions the wisdom of this move, foreshadowing unexpected things to come. Nevertheless, she accepts the job, anxious to get away from the apathy of the big city life and looks forward to truly helping a person in need. Her wish is fulfilled, but not in the way she was hoping for. She's introduced to the manager of the estate who sets up the job interview and subsequent hiring, after he seemingly convinces the older gentleman's wife to accept the young girl to live and care for her stroke-affected husband.As her journey from the urban to rural life progresses, the audience is introduced to a rich and vibrant cajun culture, full with Hoodoo and Voodoo, not to be confused with one another. The experience for her is a bit of a culture shock to say the least, but she finds it intriguing and it fuels her desire to learn more and adapt to her newfound circumstances. What follows however isn't quite as enriching of an experience as she wanted but rather she is confronted with not only age old superstitions but also their very real impact on the people entrenched within the inherent customs and beliefs.After working for awhile in the house and getting to know the tenants a little better, exploring the house and its history, she finds herself immersed in a swamp of mystery that promises to never let her go back to her old life in more ways than one.Without revealing too much, the movie had an interesting premise with strong performances from the entire cast, not to mention the setting which is a character all by itself, but the entertainment factor of the film was lost in translation from its inability to decide whether it was a real or fictional story, and that's where the magic was debunked by its own doing. The film never had the makings of greatness but it could have ended up being a decent film had it stuck with its original direction of where the story was headed. Surprising twists can make a break a film, and in this case it was the latter. It's a shame that the indirect magic of watching the film was disspelled by its supernatural hoodoo.It might please some fans of thrillers and the supernatural, but it's barely worth watching once.",2,'The Skeleton Key' Is Better Left Unturned,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,2883,"['Kate', 'Hudson', 'caring', 'sweet', 'twenty-something', 'nursing', 'home', 'assistant', 'down', 'New', 'Orleans', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'retirement', 'homes', 'how', 'staff', 'management', 'mistreats', 'elderly', 'general', 'indifference', 'old', 'dying', 'dead', 'seniors', 'unforgivable', 'intolerable', 'bags', 'more', 'nurturing', 'rewarding', 'job', 'previous', 'occupation', 'was', 'taking', 'toll', 'general', 'well', 'being.She', 'up', 'finding', 'job', 'care', 'taker', 'older', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'being', 'hired', 'wife', 'whom', 'live', 'old', 'plantation', 'mansion', 'situated', 'way', 'middle', 'remote', 'swamp', 'outskirts', 'New', 'Orleans', 'caretaker', 'best', 'friend', 'questions', 'wisdom', 'move', 'foreshadowing', 'unexpected', 'things', 'come', 'Nevertheless', 'job', 'anxious', 'get', 'away', 'apathy', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'forward', 'truly', 'helping', 'person', 'need', 'wish', 'fulfilled', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'hoping', 'introduced', 'manager', 'estate', 'who', 'up', 'job', 'interview', 'subsequent', 'hiring', 'seemingly', 'older', 'gentleman', 'wife', 'accept', 'young', 'girl', 'live', 'care', 'stroke-affected', 'husband.As', 'journey', 'urban', 'rural', 'life', 'progresses', 'audience', 'introduced', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'cajun', 'culture', 'full', 'Hoodoo', 'Voodoo', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'one', 'experience', 'bit', 'culture', 'shock', 'say', 'least', 'intriguing', 'desire', 'learn', 'more', 'adapt', 'newfound', 'circumstances', 'What', 'however', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enriching', 'experience', 'wanted', 'rather', 'confronted', 'not', 'only', 'age', 'old', 'superstitions', 'also', 'very', 'real', 'impact', 'people', 'entrenched', 'inherent', 'customs', 'beliefs.After', 'working', 'awhile', 'house', 'getting', 'know', 'tenants', 'little', 'better', 'exploring', 'house', 'history', 'immersed', 'swamp', 'mystery', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'life', 'more', 'ways', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'premise', 'strong', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'not', 'mention', 'setting', 'character', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'translation', 'inability', 'decide', 'was', 'real', 'fictional', 'story', 'where', 'magic', 'was', 'debunked', 'own', 'doing', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'makings', 'greatness', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'decent', 'film', 'had', 'original', 'direction', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'headed', 'Surprising', 'twists', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'case', 'was', 'latter', 'shame', 'indirect', 'magic', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'disspelled', 'supernatural', 'hoodoo.It', 'might', 'please', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'supernatural', 'barely', 'worth', 'watching', 'once']",N/A

Also appearing is Peter Sarsgaard (K-19: The Widowmaker, Kinsey), Joy Bryant (Get Rich or Die Tryin'), and John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Hellboy, V for Vendetta).Kate Hudson plays Caroline Ellis, a nursing student and hospice worker who, after witnessing the demise of a patient, becomes disillusioned with uncaring, corporate medical machine, quits her job, and looks for a position within a household if only to provide care on a more personal level (this is more or less an outgrowth of some unresolved baggage between her and her father, the latter having passed away not so long ago).  Anyway, she ends up taking a position in a decaying, southern plantation house out in the middle of nowhere, working for an older couple named Ben and Violet Devereaux (Hurt and Rowlands, respectively), as Ben has recently suffered a paralyzing stroke, and can barely move or speak. Upon arriving at the Devereaux estate, Caroline meets the family lawyer Luke Marshall (Sarsgaard), the one who actually hired her, along with Violet, who seems none too receptive of little Miss Thang...anyway, as Caroline moves in and goes about the business of caring for Ben, she begins to notice various peculiarities with regards to the house, the most obvious being there aren't any mirrors and there's a hidden door in the room in the attic, one Violet claims she nor her husband have never opened in their forty plus years in residence in the house (what a crock).  Caroline, not buying what Violet's selling, and being the particularly nosey sort she is, manages to open the mystery door, its contents presenting more questions than answers (kind of like when a contestant on the television show ""Let's Make A Deal"" picked the door with the `zonk' behind it).  After a bit of prying, Violet eventually relates a bit of history with regards to the house and its violent past.  Soon Caroline suspects the source of Ben's condition to be tied to what she found in the attic, and also that Violet may not be the caring, loving, doting wife she appears to be, eventually leading Caroline into a world of hoodoo rituals and beliefs, one populated by spooky characters and sinister motives, not to mention a whole lot of poultry parts, mystery organs in jars, and brick dust...William Hurt is one lucky crud...his limited role had very few lines, entailing him to lay about with a scared and bewildered look on his mug, and included him sitting in a bathtub and having Kate Hudson rub a warm sponge all over his wrinkly body.  Do you know how many guys would pay to have that done?  More than a few...anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I thought this was a great, little film, one that exceeded my expectations, which, honestly, weren't all that high.  I thought Miss Hudson did well in her role, but there were some aspects about her character I didn't care for, particularly her tendency to walk into peoples homes uninvited (a great way to get yourself shot) and just the fact she was a real snoop, the latter illustrated by her efforts to gain access into that secret room in the attic, which she had no business in whatsoever.  Part of this came from her hearing strange noises emanating from said place, but I'll tell you what, that would have only served to keep me even further away from the room as I've seen enough movies to know curiosity kills more than just cats.  One interesting aspect about this film is I think director Iain Softley must have had a real thing for Hudson (who could blame him), as he sure like filming her form in long, lingering shots.  It's funny, as there's like twenty minutes of deleted scenes included on the DVD, and yet the filmmakers managed to retain, intact, mind you, most all of the long, lingering shots I mentioned earlier.  Well, as I said, I thought Miss Hudson did well, but I thought Gena Rowlands' performance was the real treat here...there just aren't that many actresses out there nowadays that can pull off the creepy old bag routine like there were in the past, at least not to the extent someone like Bette Davis, or Joan Crawford could (when I say `creepy old bag', I mean that in the kindest, possible way), but Rowlands managed to deliver.  She works it well, getting her creep full on about three quarters of the way in, right about the time she and Hudson's character were sitting down one evening for some freshly made gumbo (it was about this time Caroline's suspicions with regards to Violet were confirmed).  She never really went overboard, which I actually appreciated as I think it takes more skill to present restrained psychotic than unfettered crazy.  I thought the cinematography was beautiful, the sense of direction strong, and the pacing of the story maintained well throughout the film (the last twenty minutes or so sweeps you up like a strong river current).  One aspect I really liked was how we were presented with a notion of what was truly happening, only have that twisted, and then twisted again, all funneling into an eerie finale.  If you do get a chance to see this film, make sure to take mental notes throughout as once the end is revealed, a lot of little, seemingly random and meaningless aspects of the story will make sense.  I didn't really find this movie all that scary, but it was entertaining.  I am curious about one thing, though...does every movie that incorporates hoodoo/voodoo into the storyline have to feature an old blind woman with the milky eyes?  It sure seems like it...The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, available in English, Spanish, and French, comes through richly.  In terms of extras, the DVD is engorged with special feature requiring nearly the same amount of time to sift through as it did to watch the film.  There's like ten featurettes, each running anywhere from two to ten minutes, some dealing with the making of the film, casting, real life ghost stories, a gumbo recipe, the shooting location, the music in the film, and so on...also included are over twenty minutes of deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary), a director's commentary track for the feature, English, Spanish, and French subtitles, and previews for other releases like American Pie Presents Band Camp (2005), The Ice Harvest (2005), War of the Worlds (2005), and Cinderella Man (2005).Cookieman108I've learned quite a few things from this film...people in the south seem acutely prone to strokes, they like to listen to the song ""Iko Iko"" sung by The Dixie Cups, and using a VW bug to bust through a wrought iron gate is a really bad idea (at least for the car)...",4,"""Child, I believe you broke my legs.""",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,7112,"['really', 'enjoy', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'pretty', 'much',

She meets her suspicious, barely cordial employer, the aged Violet (Gena Rowlands)  and is shown the apparently delusional old man (John Hurt),  recent victim of a stroke, for whom she is to care.  There is also a charming but somehow peculiarly ever-present local lawyer who sympathizes with Caroline's unease at this assignment, while at the same time acting as a liaison between her and the subtly superstition Violet. Violet allows Caroline into her home and employ, but imposes some strange rules of conduct on her, foremost among these is that there are to be no mirrors in the house. Caroline undertakes her duties to the best of her ability, while at the same time she finds herself morbidly curious about the history of the gloomy old domicile, scene of past tragedy. Forbidden by Violet to enter the upstairs attic space, Caroline cannot resist doing just that after she comes into possession of an all-purpose skeleton key. And that, as they say, sets off a spooky chain reaction that takes us through the elements of hoodoo, kidnapping, and murder that unwind through the concluding half of the film. There is a twist ending, not on a par with The Sixth Sense or The Others, but a pretty good one, nonetheless, that I'll not give away here, only say that you might guess it before its revelation but if you do, that doesn't spoil the full implication of what exactly has long been going on inside that creepy old house in the bayous.",3,Southern Gothic With The Supernatural Thrown In,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1736,"['Atmospheric', 'on-screen', 'southern', 'Gothic', 'sums', 'up', 'film', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'Caroline', 'played', 'here', 'America', 'would-be', 'sweetheart', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'corporate-managed', 'assembly', 'line', 'style', 'New', 'Orleans', 'hospice', 'private', 'position', 'run-down', 'old', 'mansion', 'country', 'suspicious', 'barely', 'cordial', 'employer', 'aged', 'Violet', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'shown', 'apparently', 'delusional', 'old', 'man', 'John', 'Hurt', 'recent', 'victim', 'stroke', 'whom', 'care', 'also', 'charming', 'somehow', 'peculiarly', 'ever-present', 'local', 'lawyer', 'who', 'Caroline', 'unease', 'assignment', 'same', 'time', 'acting', 'liaison', 'subtly', 'superstition', 'Violet', 'Violet', 'Caroline', 'home', 'employ', 'strange', 'rules', 'conduct', 'foremost', 'are', 'be', 'mirrors', 'house', 'Caroline', 'duties', 'best', 'ability', 'same', 'time', 'morbidly', 'curious', 'history', 'gloomy', 'old', 'domicile', 'scene', 'past', 'tragedy', 'Forbidden', 'Violet', 'enter', 'upstairs', 'attic', 'space', 'Caroline', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'doing', 'just', 'possession', 'all-purpose', 'skeleton', 'key', 'say', 'off', 'spooky', 'chain', 'reaction', 'elements', 'hoodoo', 'kidnapping', 'murder', 'unwind', 'concluding', 'half', 'film', 'twist', 'ending', 'not', 'par', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Others', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'nonetheless', ""'ll"", 'not', 'give', 'away', 'here', 'only', 'say', 'might', 'guess', 'revelation', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'full', 'implication', 'what', 'exactly', 'long', 'been', 'going', 'old', 'house', 'bayous']",N/A

Well, Skeleton Key boasts a perfect blend of atmosphere and drama in one of the most inventive horror films of recent release. Acting is absolutely dead on with all the cast members, most notably Hurt who puts other actors to shame by simply conveying more with his eyes than most actors can do screaming with sweeping arm and leg motions. Direction is slick and provides an eerie presence throughout and the questions raised that MUST be answered give the audience a sense of mixed emotions(do I REALLY want to know whether Hurt's character was scared so out of his mind that he can no longer speak? Do I REALLY want to know why a caregiver is even necessary since the wife seems to be able to handle her husband solo quite adequately?)Its like the proverbial accident on the side of the road, u dont want to look but u just HAVE to. The finale begins to reek of stale bayou perspiration through its'uninventive nature at first glance but then the director quickly yanks out the rug from underneath us by supplying the most surprising ending since Sixth Sense. The movie comes to a conclusion that is SO shocking, I am sure that even M. Night Shayamalon applauded.

(about 95% of the time), and that is that the much weaker longshot winner good guy always walks away in the end victorious ... I'm an old grumpy person and every once in a while I like to see a unfortune ending, though the ending in ""Skeleton Key"" was unfortunate, there was more lieing there than just that, it was the puzzlement of the ending, the twist, the shocker,... I'm sorry to say i'm not going to say the ending just because I dont want to spoil the ending for those of you that have not seen it, but it truly is pretty crazy.Now too the more negitive parts of the movie which were quite large in numbers, ""Skeleton Key"" was one of the most puzzling confusing and bunched up movies I have ever seen, at some points the movie littarly failed to deliver the message that it was trying to get across to the 75 people in the audience.

636493,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00005JNY3,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[0, 2]","""The Skeleton Key"" is a strange movie. It is a horror film that relies more on psychological horror than normal horror that invades most horror movies these days. It is a ghost story, although the ghosts are never seen as ghosts. The script, penned by ""Ring""-master Ehren Kruger, is effectively terrifying. The acting is great, and the Louisiana town the film is set in is atmospheric and just back-woodsy enough. When the movies falters, the slightest bit that is, it is in the twist ending that makes little sense. But it fits with the rest of the movie. It, too, makes little sense and in scenes such as a club scene and a scene at a gas station seem like they don't really fit into the movie and are only there for the sole purpose of, respectfully, showing a hip, trendy atmosphere and it also being a way to showcase the movie's theme song. And the last is just to scare the audience. Gena Rowlands is good in a supportiing role, but is stuck with bad lines (""Child, I do believe that you broke my legs. Now it's time to pay!""). The script is good, although not frightening, it has some well staged scenes. Although the violence goes way overboard in the last third (broken legs, lynchings, burnings, shootings, strangulations, stabbings, dismemberment) the movie never loses its pacing and stays satisfyingly dark throughout.Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker that regrets not caring for her late father. She gets a job at the Deveraux manse caring for Ben (John Hurt) who suffered a stroke after seeing something shocking in a mirror. Violet (Rowlands) thinks that Caroline will not understand the house. Violet tells Caroline that there used to be a family of rich white bankers that lived in the house. One night, while having a party, the parting guests wanted to bid fairwell to the children. They find them sitting in a hoodoo circle with the servants Mamma Cecile and Papa Justify. The family and guests lynch the servants, whose spirits now haunt the house and appear in all the mirrors in the home. Hoodoo, Caroline finds out, is different than voodoo. Voodoo is more of a religion associated with God. Hoodoo is associated with the fact that, if a person was killed in the write way in a Circle Of Life, the years on the late persons life will be added to the killers, keeping them safe from anything. Caroline becomes entrenched in the hoodoo phenomenon. Peter Saarsgaard appears as a lawyer that helps Caroline.Their is a twist in the end that is unexplainable, but the less you think about it the more sense it makes. The movie is also scarier because of the twist. And, as a result, the movie makes sense because of the twist. For a change this is a movie that has a twist that isn't cliched and is neccessary. The ending twist may not be needed, but it, in an odd way, it is needed to make sense of the rest of the film.""The Skeleton Key"" is 1 hour 38 minutes.It is rated PG-13 for Violence (A strangulation, a stabbing, a few shootings, broken legs, lynchings, burnings, and a dismemberment), Disturbing Images (Skin, teeth, animal fetus' are seen in jars, a persons eyes and mouth are shown stitched shut, and we see it happen), Nudity (Brief toplessness), and Language (1 f-word, other profanities).",5,"A Good Thriller With Good Acting, But An Unexplainable Ending",1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,3232,"['Skeleton', 'Key', 'strange', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'psychological', 'horror', 'normal', 'horror', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'ghost', 'story', 'ghosts', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'ghosts', 'script', 'penned', 'Ring', '-master', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'effectively', 'terrifying', 'acting', 'great', 'Louisiana', 'town', 'film', 'set', 'atmospheric', 'just', 'back-woodsy', 'enough', 'When', 'movies', 'falters', 'slightest', 'bit', 'twist', 'ending', 'little', 'sense', 'rest', 'movie', 'too', 'little', 'sense', 'scenes', 'such', 'club', 'scene', 'scene', 'gas', 'station', 'seem', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'there', 'sole', 'purpose', 'respectfully', 'showing', 'hip', 'trendy', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'being', 'way', 'showcase', 'movie', 'theme', 'song', 'last', 'just', 'scare', 'audience', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'good', 'supportiing', 'role', 'stuck', 'bad', 'lines', 'Child', 'do', 'believe', 'broke', 'legs', 'Now', 'time', 'pay', 'script', 'good', 'not', 'frightening', 'well', 'staged', 'scenes', 'violence', 'way', 'overboard', 'last', 'third', 'broken', 'legs', 'lynchings', 'burnings', 'shootings', 'strangulations', 'stabbings', 'dismemberment', 'movie', 'never', 'pacing', 'stays', 'satisfyingly', 'dark', 'throughout.Caroline', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'hospice', 'worker', 'not', 'caring', 'late', 'father', 'job', 'Deveraux', 'manse', 'caring', 'Ben', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'seeing', 'something', 'shocking', 'mirror', 'Violet', 'Rowlands', 'Caroline', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'house', 'Violet', 'Caroline', 'used', 'be', 'family', 'rich', 'white', 'bankers', 'lived', 'house', 'One', 'night', 'having', 'party', 'parting', 'guests', 'wanted', 'bid', 'fairwell', 'children', 'find', 'sitting', 'hoodoo', 'circle', 'servants', 'Mamma', 'Cecile', 'Papa', 'Justify', 'family', 'guests', 'lynch', 'servants', 'spirits', 'now', 'haunt', 'house', 'appear', 'mirrors', 'home', 'Hoodoo', 'Caroline', 'out', 'different', 'voodoo', 'Voodoo', 'more', 'religion', 'associated', 'God', 'Hoodoo', 'associated', 'fact', 'person', 'was', 'killed', 'write', 'way', 'Circle', 'Life', 'years', 'late', 'persons', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'added', 'killers', 'keeping', 'safe', 'anything', 'Caroline', 'entrenched', 'hoodoo', 'phenomenon', 'Peter', 'Saarsgaard', 'lawyer', 'Caroline.Their', 'twist', 'end', 'unexplainable', 'less', 'think', 'more', 'sense', 'movie', 'also', 'scarier', 'twist', 'result', 'movie', 'sense', 'twist', 'change', 'movie', 'twist', ""n't"", 'cliched', 'neccessary', 'ending', 'twist', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'needed', 'odd', 'way', 'needed', 'make', 'sense', 'rest', 'film', 'Skeleton', 'Key', '1', 'hour', '38', 'minutes.It', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Violence', 'strangulation', 'stabbing', 'few', 'shootings', 'broken', 'legs', 'lynchings', 'burnings', 'dismemberment', 'Disturbing', 'Images', 'Skin', 'teeth', 'animal', 'fetus', 'are', 'seen', 'jars', 'persons', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'are', 'shown', 'stitched', 'shut', 'see', 'happen', 'Nudity', 'Brief', 'toplessness', 'Language', '1', 'f-word', 'other', 'profanities']",N/A

The blurb on the back of the DVD brags that this movie has ""one of the best twists since The Sixth Sense.""  The ending to The Sixth Sense at first left me speechless and then had me talking about it for weeks after I saw it in the theatre so when I read that blurb, it made me really want to see this movie.  For once, I'd like to say, the blurb on the back of the container was true!  In my opinion, anyway.The story for The Skeleton Key is original, which is why it's able to pull off such a fantastic twist.  This movie really had me thinking and there was a point near the end where I figured out the ending before it was actually revealed, but even so, I wasn't bothered by that.  The reason for that is because when I thought I had it figured out, I was tricked into thinking I hadn't figured it out after all!  I was actually left guessing up till the last few minutes...It's really hard to write a review for movies like this because I don't want to give anything away.  I recommend it for anyone who loves movies that play with your mind.  It's definitely a story that gets you thinking.  It allows us a glimpse into a world that very much exists, or did exist, yet few of us will ever experience.  There is a lot of history in the bayous of Louisiana and while the true stories of that area may not be as extreme as the one portrayed in this movie, I'm sure they're fascinating all the same.I'd love to see more movies with story lines like this.

""Skeleton Key"" is a wonderfully creepy movie set in New Orleans and at an old plantation house out in the swamps.  The setting feels as much a part of the movie as the characters are as Kate Hudson's character, Caroline, moves from her urban nursing job out into the countryside to take care of a dying invalid.Once she moves there, the creepy feeling grows and grows as she realizes that things are not what they seem--that Violet, the wife, is clearly very controlling and hiding some kind of secret while her invalid husband, Ben, seems to be trying to ask for her help.  The mirrors in the house have all vanished and the skeleton key she was given that is supposed to open all rooms in the house doesn't seem to work on the strange little room up in the attic.We journey with Caroline as she uncovers what is really going on, discovering along the way how hoodoo plays into the story.  The ending was surprising the first time I watched it, but the movie is still enjoyable to watch a second or third time even after you know what is coming.There are some areas in this movie that could have been tightened up a bit, but overall its a terrific spooky story.  Its not the kind of horror story bound up with lots of gore and action, so if you're into that you probably will find this movie a bit on the slow side.

Without resorting to the usual stock gimmicks, THE SKELETON KEY works on many levels to frighten and entertain and it succeeds!Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a beautiful 25-year old whose guilt over her absence from her father's deathbed has driven her to seek work in nursing homes (the film's opening sequence with Caroline reading to a dying man is elegant and touching and quite timely) and ultimately to hospice care. Answering an ad in the paper for a hospice nurse takes her to a strange old Southern mansion in which live the Devereauxs - Violet (Gena Rowlands) and her bedridden husband Ben (John Hurt). Caroline passes her interview and at the warm insistence of the family lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) she takes the job. Violet is a frightening old lady who entrusts Caroline with a skeleton key which opens the doors of all 30 rooms of the creaky, musty mansion - except for one door in the attic. Noting there are no mirrors in the house, Caroline begins to investigate the place and Ben's seemingly terrified state and discovers the forbidden room contains elements of dark magic. She seeks information from her close friend Jill (Joy Bryant) who skeptically informs her that the symbols and paraphernalia Caroline has discovered are factors of Hoodoo - a strange magic whose multiethnic beginnings are in New Orleans. Slowly Caroline challenges Violet for information and finding none, seeks the advice of a Hoodoo woman (Fahnlohnee R. Harris) for answers. The bizarre dark secrets of the old mansion and the Devereaux couple ultimately come into focus and it is up to Caroline to break some spells....if that is possible.With a cast this fine it would be surprising if the film didn't fly and each of the actors creates a credible creature that involves us from the beginning. Yes, the horror story is accompanied by rain storms and thunder storms that serve to heighten the tension and the pacing by director Softley keeps the audience alert and suspicious and ultimately surprised. This is one of the better thrillers released in some time. Recommended especially to devotees of the thriller genre!

Oh, right, we're searching for a magic spell, a spell that, ... um, well I can't remember the actual components of the spell, but I think it gives one the ability to raise the dead. There's so much horror cliche here; locked secret attics, harmless and unexpected frights around every corner, that one forgets the point of it all. That point is a padded and complicated twist and turn concerning a health care worker's attempt to determine the cause of an old man's stroke. Maybe he was frightened to near death.So she has this skeleton key that opens every door in this spooky southern mansion but one, she runs frantically down hallways, up and down staircases, awakes to thunder ravaged nights, and well, you know, if she had a candle, it would blow out, if she made a phone call, the line would go dead.Exactly what you're looking for, a good old fashioned horror flick? Well,""The Skeleton Key"", for all it's perpetual horror, never delivers the scares. The big fright seems to be around every corner, but it's just another ghost in the mirror. It does become dramatically interesting, the heroine's search through voodoo subculture possesses a spooky charm, and the ending of the film stands tall as a symbol of alternative religious belief, but the bim, bam, boom 'gotcha!' scare is forever elusive.I'll hate myself in the morning for saying so, but Kate Hudson is bland in the lead with a sort of quizzical 'Leave It To Beaver' delivery - ""Gee, Dad, I thought all voodoo was the same."". Peter Sarsgaard's lazy eye nonchalance is finally tiring, and John Hurt, as an incapacitated stroke victim, does well enough I suppose.

Wait till you see The Skeleton Key--a thriller that derives it's creepiness from the storyline, subtle sound effects and impressive photography. Yes, it's a thriller and not a horror film by any stretch. It has a suspenseful overtone, which I believe helped eliminate the potential cheese.Caroline (Kate Hudson) lives in New Orleans and works at a local hospice. She leaves the hospice and moves out to the bayous to care for an elderly man (John Hurt) that recently suffered a stroke. The man seems to be terrified of something and Caroline is determined to help him. In the process, she learns a terrifying truth that will make you gasp.The acting is good and so is the atmosphere, which is set in the swamps out in the bayous of Louisiana. At the center of the storyline is hoodoo--a form of magic oftentimes mistaken for voodoo--and two of its masters.

I watched it the second time because I liked it so much the first time, and the third to see just how they put it all together and to watch the subtle acting nuances. Gena Rowlands deserved an Oscar nomination for her performance-as did John Hurt in his virtually speechless role.The action takes place in a parish (county) outside New Orleans in a suitably creepy, crumbling, ante bellum mansion. Kate Hudson plays a nursing assistant hired to take care of a terminally ill and completely paralyzed man (John Hurt) and help out his dominatingly sinister wife (Gena Rowland.) The secrets of hoodoo (a sort of mix of voodoo with added European and Early American elements thrown in) that are hidden in the attic begin to draw the nursing assistant into a supernatural plot aimed against both herself and her patient.[An old vinyl recording of a secret ritual by a pivotal character, conjure man ""Papa Justify,"" lends authenticity to the atmosphere of dark spells & folk occultism underlying the film. The recording is mesmerizing both in its archaic text & almost rap like beat.

Allen Parker does a knock out job conjuring a post WWII New Orleans under which danger and dread lies just below the surface. A perfect story perfectly realized.OK but I digress.Things I liked about this movie:1. Excellent cast, particulary Gina Rowlands and John Hurt, who play the aged couple. That isn't surprising given their track records as versatile, powerful performers.As an aside, I love Gina Rowlands for looking her age with her wrinkles and middle-age spread. No triple face lifts or botox for this lady. Unlike so many creepy 60+ Hollywood actresses that look like they've been starved, stretched, and preserved in formaldehyde. Right on, Gina!2. Phenomenal job creating a creepy, disturbing atmosphere. In a movie like this, I want a sense of ""old"" Louisiana with its slavery, superstition, and strange customs and this film reeks of it. Between set design, photography, and an excellent roots blues score, it transports you to an entirely different world.3. A good mystery and delicious irony. I'm not going to give away the secret but there's an interesting irony revealed at the end. It also raised the question in my mind re was it evil or was it justice?What didn't work for me:1. Kate Hudson in the lead. Kate Hudson gives a subdued, low key performance in the film. And of course, she always looks gorgeous even in a ""plain Jane"" wardrobe. But I felt that she didn't really get into her character in a way that helped me empathize with what was going on. There's a scene when she's in the servants old room discovering some old hoodoo relics that would have made me scream my head off regardless of whether I believed. Her character comes off, at times, as strangly apathetic.2. The flashback scenes looked fakey and hokey. They reminded me of some of the scenes from Stephen King's Rose Red and Desperation mini series. They looked forced and were too blatent. The film would have worked better for me had they perhaps not even shown the key scene involving the servant couple but somehow implied it.3. Loose ends. What's up with the gas station and the creepy old lady with the cateracts? Other than being a device to move the story along I thought an awful lot of time was devoted to this woman even though she does very little in the film. My sense is that whatever her significance was, it was cut from the film for editorial and pacing reasons.Another loose end, was Caroline somehow lured into the job or was she simply the one who showed up and was chosen.

Kate is sort of good in the part, and afterwards we argued about whether or not she was miscast.  She just doesn't seem like to sort of idealist who gets upset that there's no one to care about the elderly people at the rest home whom, once they die, their things get thrown into the dumpster because their relatives don't care enough to come fetch the junk the deceased kept.Well, she's on some entirely different trip but if you could ignore her motivation, which a weak script fails to supply, or which an indifferent performance by stolid old Kate fails to supply, the movie does have some thrills and puzzles.  Actually Joy Bryant, who plays the black girlfriend, should have have the main part and Kate could have been the pleasure-seeking, hedonistic Bourbon Street dancing queen.  Even Goldie Hawn might have given her character more shadings, for to me, Caroline never really had enough hard evidence to make her take the extreme steps she did, and the whole back story about being too busy to take care of her own father and the way she let him die alone was making her feel guilty about dying men, was silly and an insult to our intelligence, but I can see why Ehren Kruger had to put it in for otherwise there would have been no story.  Or it would have seemed like a ""Repulsion"" sort of picture in which Kate Hudson's character was just going insane because of sexual repression and not enough dates with men.  And when the only man around is Peter Sarsgaard, a girl has to take care of herself especially if she saw him in FLIGHT PLAN.So why hasn't anyone complained that the movie is really nothing more than a copy cat rip off of the entire plot of BRIDE OF CHUCKY?Hope that isn't a spoiler, but if you've seen BRIDE OF CHUCKY you'll know every last secret of THE SKELETON KEY.",4,Strange Similarities to BRIDE OF CHUCKY!,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2119,"['nice', 'Kate', 'Hudson', ""n't"", 'skin', 'bones', '[', ']', 'properly', 'zaftig', 'scenes', 'nurse', 'required', 'carry', 'big', 'old', 'John', 'Hurt', 'halls', '30-room', 'mansion', 'stagger', 'dead', 'weight', 'rain-strewn', 'grounds', 'haunted', 'Louisiana', 'mansion', 'where', 'Kate', 'sort', 'good', 'part', 'argued', 'not', 'was', 'miscast', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sort', 'idealist', 'who', 'upset', 'one', 'care', 'elderly', 'people', 'rest', 'home', 'whom', 'once', 'die', 'things', 'get', 'thrown', 'dumpster', 'relatives', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'come', 'fetch', 'junk', 'deceased', 'kept.Well', 'entirely', 'different', 'trip', 'could', 'ignore', 'motivation', 'weak', 'script', 'supply', 'indifferent', 'performance', 'stolid', 'old', 'Kate', 'supply', 'movie', 'have', 'thrills', 'puzzles', 'Actually', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'who', 'black', 'girlfriend', 'should', 'have', 'have', 'main', 'part', 'Kate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pleasure-seeking', 'hedonistic', 'Bourbon', 'Street', 'dancing', 'queen', 'Even', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'character', 'more', 'shadings', 'Caroline', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'enough', 'hard', 'evidence', 'make', 'take', 'extreme', 'steps', 'did', 'whole', 'back', 'story', 'being', 'too', 'busy', 'take', 'care', 'own', 'father', 'way', 'let', 'die', 'alone', 'was', 'making', 'feel', 'guilty', 'dying', 'men', 'was', 'silly', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'had', 'put', 'otherwise', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'Repulsion', 'sort', 'picture', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'insane', 'sexual', 'repression', 'not', 'enough', 'dates', 'men', 'when', 'only', 'man', 'around', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'girl', 'take', 'care', 'especially', 'saw', 'FLIGHT', 'PLAN.So', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'complained', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'copy', 'cat', 'rip', 'entire', 'plot', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'CHUCKY', 'Hope', ""n't"", 'spoiler', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'CHUCKY', ""'ll"", 'know', 'last', 'secret', 'THE', 'SKELETON', 'KEY']",N/A
636541,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JNY3,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","""The Skeleton Key"" isn't terribly scary.  It isn't all too suspenseful, either.  What it is, however, is a wonderful mystery tale laced with superstition, that grand Southern culture, and a refreshingly surprising ending.  The story starts out in New Orleans where Caroline(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who's grown tired of the ""business"" of helping people die a nice and easy death.  She takes a job deep in the bayous of Terrebonne Parish at a home where an elderly man, John Hurt, and his wife, Gena Rowlands, live together.  Hurt's character has supposedly suffered a stroke, and Hudson is hired to help him down that last highway in life.Things start to get peculiar when Hudson opens up a room in the attic with her skeleton key.  In it, she is introduced to the sometimes spooky, sometimes bizarre world of hoodoo.  As the rest of the story unfolds, Hudson starts to think that Hurt is actually under some sort of curse and wants her to help him escape his mute and aging prison.I have to admit that the twisted conclusion of this flick caught me by surprise.  Early revelations in the film become clear and, to a degree, very morbid.  There isn't a lot of ""BOO!"" scares in this flick, nor is there any gore(excepting a little bit of blood and a couple of broken legs).  This flick is simply a good little horror tale that doesn't end up with a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting hacked up or a couple of Asian ghosts making creepy noises.The location helps the story role along rather well.  Being from Louisiana, I've been in a few spots in the woods near my home that just naturally give off an uneasy feeling.  Throw in the hoodoo aspect, and you make the atmosphere that much creepier.Perhaps it deserves three-and-a-half stars more than four, but it is much better than the bulk of the so-called horror flicks these days.",4,Nice Little Spooker,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,1837,"['Skeleton', 'Key', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'scary', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'suspenseful', 'either', 'What', 'however', 'wonderful', 'mystery', 'tale', 'laced', 'superstition', 'grand', 'Southern', 'culture', 'refreshingly', 'surprising', 'ending', 'story', 'out', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'Caroline', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'hospice', 'worker', 'who', 'grown', 'tired', 'business', 'helping', 'people', 'die', 'nice', 'easy', 'death', 'job', 'deep', 'bayous', 'Terrebonne', 'Parish', 'home', 'where', 'elderly', 'man', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wife', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'live', 'together', 'Hurt', 'character', 'supposedly', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'Hudson', 'hired', 'help', 'down', 'last', 'highway', 'life.Things', 'start', 'get', 'peculiar', 'when', 'Hudson', 'up', 'room', 'attic', 'skeleton', 'key', 'introduced', 'sometimes', 'spooky', 'sometimes', 'bizarre', 'world', 'hoodoo', 'rest', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Hudson', 'think', 'Hurt', 'actually', 'sort', 'curse', 'help', 'escape', 'mute', 'aging', 'prison.I', 'have', 'admit', 'twisted', 'conclusion', 'flick', 'caught', 'surprise', 'Early', 'revelations', 'film', 'become', 'clear', 'degree', 'very', 'morbid', ""n't"", 'lot', 'BOO', 'flick', 'there', 'gore', 'excepting', 'little', 'bit', 'blood', 'couple', 'broken', 'legs', 'flick', 'simply', 'good', 'little', 'horror', 'tale', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'bunch', 'sex-crazed', 'teens', 'getting', 'hacked', 'up', 'couple', 'Asian', 'ghosts', 'making', 'creepy', 'noises.The', 'location', 'story', 'role', 'rather', 'well', 'Being', 'Louisiana', ""'ve"", 'been', 'few', 'spots', 'woods', 'home', 'just', 'naturally', 'give', 'off', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'Throw', 'hoodoo', 'aspect', 'make', 'atmosphere', 'much', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'more', 'four', 'much', 'better', 'bulk', 'so-called', 'horror', 'days']",N/A
636542,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNY3,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 0]","Skeleton Key delivers a fascinating horror film with a chilly atmosphere that forces the audience to peek behind the couch to see that there is nothing surprising sneaking behind.  It is with crawling motion that the film advances while it occasionally brings to mind the southern mood from Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).  However, it does not have any of the gore that director Robert Aldrich exploited in his 1960s psychological haunting tale.  Instead, Skeleton Key slowly builds up an eerie atmosphere that will reach its peak in the final crescendo where the film will subtly shake the audience's perception of reality in a profoundly spooky manner.Detached from society, the film opens in a nursing home; a place where many elderly people seek their final destination before parting from the living world.  Here Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) sits and reads out of Treasure Island for a man who is about to take his last breath to the fading words by Robert Louis Stevenson.  Unlike Stevenson who accomplished a literary success and fame left something behind while the man dies a lonely death without anyone caring about his existence.  The scene suggests several different notions, which also has to do with the film's main theme - death.  However, it also taps on the idea of dying an anonymous death, as if the person lived a meaningless or unknown existence.Caroline's desire to become a nurse for the elderly and those who soon will cross into the next world stems from her father's passing.  She missed her father's death, which has caused her to set out on her own mission by providing company to those who are about to pass on.  It is a noble thought, especially when the audience learns about the many people in Carloine's nursing homes that pass away without the care or affection of relatives at the final stage of their lives with nowhere to send the deceased's belongings.Through an ad in a newspaper, Caroline finds a good paying job, as a live-in hospice caretaker.  The drawback with the job is that it is located in the remote bayou south of New Orleans.  Nonetheless, she takes the job with the old couple Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) and Violet (Gena Rowlands), as she is supposed to care for Ben in his final stage of his life after having suffered from a serious stroke.  The couple lives in an old plantation manor that has seen its glory days a little less than a century ago, and where each room has a different lock on the doors.  In order to move around freely in the mansion she receives a skeleton key, as it can unlock all doors of the house.  The skeleton key also provides a symbolic notion of having the power to uncover secrets, which makes more sense in the end.Strange things begin to happen, as the supposedly paralyzed Ben has ability to grasp and occasionally make some form of communication.  Unhurriedly, Caroline discovers one secret after another such as a message for help and a hidden door in the attic.  With the skeleton key, Caroline has the power to unlock the secrets and to find out what is truly occurring at the Devereaux mansion.  Behind the locked door in the attic, she discovers strange and bizarre equipment.  These tools and trinkets including a creepy record somehow connect with hoodoo, a traditional magic that originated in the southern United States.  Hoodoo has its roots in African, European, and Native American folklore and botanical ingredients that a person applies to control supernatural forces to help with everyday life.  However, all of its power is meaningless, as it can only influence people foolish enough to believe in it.  The combination of supernatural forces and strange brews begin to unveil that the old man that she takes care for desperately tries to flee and get her help.  The question is how can she help him, and convince someone to believe her that magic is in the works.  The only person that she can turn to is the young lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard), who first has a hard time believing her.Skeleton Key displays a delightfully frightening atmosphere that intentionally lingers throughout the whole film, yet it also triggers the audience's curiosity.  However, the truly terrifying notion emerges after the film when the audience begins to ponder what happened in the end.  The director Iain Softley exhibits that a horror film can be thoughtful while also revealing that fear can be so much more than simple head chopping and serial killing.  In addition, Softley succeeds to bring together to opposite characteristics such as fear and curiosity that boil into an eerie nightmare that will haunt the audience in a cerebral manner.  Some elements within the film feel a little awkward during its progress.  However, these knotty moments smooth out through the clever ending, an ending that literary delivers the concept - ""curiosity killed the cat.""",4,Exceptionally Eerie Horror Lingers Far After the End...,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,4854,"['Skeleton', 'Key', 'fascinating', 'horror', 'film', 'chilly', 'atmosphere', 'audience', 'peek', 'couch', 'see', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'sneaking', 'crawling', 'motion', 'film', 'advances', 'occasionally', 'mind', 'southern', 'mood', 'Hush', 'Hush', 'Sweet', 'Charlotte', '1964', 'However', 'not', 'have', 'gore', 'director', 'Robert', 'Aldrich', 'exploited', '1960s', 'psychological', 'haunting', 'tale', 'Instead', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'slowly', 'up', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'reach', 'peak', 'final', 'crescendo', 'where', 'film', 'will', 'subtly', 'shake', 'audience', 'perception', 'reality', 'profoundly', 'spooky', 'manner.Detached', 'society', 'film', 'nursing', 'home', 'place', 'where', 'many', 'elderly', 'people', 'seek', 'final', 'destination', 'parting', 'living', 'world', 'Here', 'Caroline', 'Ellis', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'sits', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'last', 'breath', 'fading', 'words', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'accomplished', 'literary', 'success', 'fame', 'left', 'something', 'man', 'lonely', 'death', 'anyone', 'caring', 'existence', 'scene', 'several', 'different', 'notions', 'also', 'do', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'death', 'However', 'also', 'idea', 'dying', 'anonymous', 'death', 'person', 'lived', 'meaningless', 'unknown', 'existence.Caroline', 'desire', 'become', 'nurse', 'elderly', 'who', 'soon', 'will', 'cross', 'next', 'world', 'father', 'passing', 'missed', 'father', 'death', 'caused', 'set', 'out', 'own', 'mission', 'providing', 'company', 'who', 'are', 'pass', 'noble', 'thought', 'especially', 'when', 'audience', 'many', 'people', 'Carloine', 'nursing', 'homes', 'pass', 'away', 'care', 'affection', 'relatives', 'final', 'stage', 'lives', 'nowhere', 'send', 'deceased', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'Caroline', 'good', 'paying', 'job', 'live-in', 'hospice', 'caretaker', 'drawback', 'job', 'located', 'remote', 'bayou', 'south', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Nonetheless', 'job', 'old', 'couple', 'Ben', 'Devereaux', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Violet', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'supposed', 'care', 'Ben', 'final', 'stage', 'life', 'having', 'suffered', 'serious', 'stroke', 'couple', 'old', 'plantation', 'manor', 'seen', 'glory', 'days', 'little', 'less', 'century', 'ago', 'where', 'room', 'different', 'lock', 'doors', 'order', 'move', 'around', 'freely', 'mansion', 'skeleton', 'key', 'can', 'unlock', 'doors', 'house', 'skeleton', 'key', 'also', 'symbolic', 'notion', 'having', 'power', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'more', 'sense', 'end.Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'supposedly', 'paralyzed', 'Ben', 'ability', 'grasp', 'occasionally', 'make', 'form', 'communication', 'Unhurriedly', 'Caroline', 'one', 'secret', 'such', 'message', 'help', 'hidden', 'door', 'attic', 'skeleton', 'key', 'Caroline', 'power', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'truly', 'occurring', 'Devereaux', 'mansion', 'locked', 'door', 'attic', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'equipment', 'tools', 'trinkets', 'including', 'creepy', 'record', 'somehow', 'connect', 'hoodoo', 'traditional', 'magic', 'originated', 'southern', 'United', 'States', 'Hoodoo', 'roots', 'African', 'European', 'Native', 'American', 'folklore', 'botanical', 'ingredients', 'person', 'control', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'help', 'everyday', 'life', 'However', 'power', 'meaningless', 'can', 'only', 'influence', 'people', 'foolish', 'enough', 'believe', 'combination', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'strange', 'brews', 'begin', 'unveil', 'old', 'man', 'care', 'desperately', 'tries', 'flee', 'get', 'help', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'help', 'convince', 'someone', 'believe', 'magic', 'works', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'turn', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Luke', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'first', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'her.Skeleton', 'Key', 'delightfully', 'frightening', 'atmosphere', 'intentionally', 'whole', 'film', 'also', 'audience', 'curiosity', 'However', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'notion', 'emerges', 'film', 'when', 'audience', 'ponder', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'director', 'Iain', 'Softley', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'also', 'revealing', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'head', 'chopping', 'serial', 'killing', 'addition', 'Softley', 'bring', 'together', 'opposite', 'characteristics', 'such', 'fear', 'curiosity', 'boil', 'eerie', 'nightmare', 'will', 'haunt', 'audience', 'cerebral', 'manner', 'elements', 'film', 'feel', 'little', 'awkward', 'progress', 'However', 'knotty', 'moments', 'smooth', 'out', 'clever', 'ending', 'ending', 'literary', 'delivers', 'concept', 'curiosity', 'killed', 'cat']",N/A

This is the source of the supernatural drama.Seems the (African American) caretakers in the house practiced hoodoo 90 years earlier with the children of the then homeowners. When the rich white parents and party guests found out, they lynched the caretakers. Or so it seemed, anyway.You dont find out what actually happened until the final apocalyptic scene in the film, where a truly unpredictable and exciting transformation takes place. You will clearly understand what's happened but you may not put it together with the caretakers from 90 years earlier.So, when you rent, buy or borrow this supernatural thriller, keep in mind at the end what happened 90 years earlier. By doing so, you'll be able to knock over all the dominoes in this involving, exciting and entertaining movie.",4,A suspenser with twist at the end that saves the day,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1648,"['watched', 'wife', 'other', 'night', 'spooky', 'flicks', 'developed', 'goose', 'flesh', 'right', 'away', 'almost', 'first', 'scene', 'knew', 'was', 'hooked', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'enthralled', 'stuck', 'out', 'had', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'end.Briefly', 'stated', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'lot', 'mystery', 'horror', 'main', 'players', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'daughter', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'live', 'nurse', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'who', 'wife', 'matriarch', 'patient', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'lawyer.Right', 'arriving', 'Hudson', 'something', 'wrong', 'new', 'place', 'employment', 'old', 'Spanish', 'moss', 'laced', 'mansion', 'New', 'Orleans', 'plot', 'learn', 'parties', 'movie', 'practice', 'believe', 'something', 'called', 'hoodoo', 'variant', 'voodoo', 'source', 'supernatural', 'African', 'American', 'caretakers', 'house', 'practiced', 'hoodoo', '90', 'years', 'earlier', 'children', 'then', 'homeowners', 'When', 'rich', 'white', 'parents', 'party', 'guests', 'found', 'out', 'lynched', 'caretakers', 'seemed', 'anyway.You', 'dont', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'final', 'apocalyptic', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'truly', 'unpredictable', 'exciting', 'transformation', 'place', 'will', 'clearly', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'may', 'not', 'put', 'together', 'caretakers', '90', 'years', 'earlier.So', 'when', 'rent', 'buy', 'borrow', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'keep', 'mind', 'end', 'what', 'happened', '90', 'years', 'earlier', 'doing', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'knock', 'dominoes', 'involving', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

The old man who could craw out of the roof and also write ""Help Me"" on the bed sheet could not have written out what happened to the lady help to warn her?2.  The girl escapes out from the old lady by rolling a boat out on to the river, but once she reaches the land, she does not go straight to the police to get that old man out of that weird place even though the lady had a gun and was shooting at her as she ren out of that place, and she hid the old man and was scared for his safety.  Once she reached the land, she ran straight to that lawyer and told him what happend.3.  The lady help pushed the old lady off from the top of the stairs and breaking her legs, but the old lady manages to drag herself up the stairs very quickly, and was able to move a long heavy looking mirror with both arms.4.  The lady help could ran out of the house when the old lady and her son was chasing her, but instead she ran up the stairs.5.  The lady help could have jumped out of her way out of the circle she drew, or at least get out of the way when that old lady pushed the mirror towards her, but she stood still (I tell you this went on for a long time).Don't waste your money!",1,"Long, boring and does not have a great ending!",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,1420,"['rented', 'movie', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'said', 'even', 'movie', 'drag', 'bit', 'great', 'shocking', 'ending', 'So', 'watched', 'whole', 'movie', 'here', 'review', 'way', 'movie', 'long', 'boring.Spoilers', '1', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'craw', 'roof', 'also', 'write', 'Help', 'Me', 'bed', 'sheet', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'written', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'lady', 'help', 'warn', '2', 'girl', 'out', 'old', 'lady', 'rolling', 'boat', 'out', 'river', 'once', 'land', 'not', 'go', 'straight', 'police', 'get', 'old', 'man', 'weird', 'place', 'even', 'lady', 'had', 'gun', 'was', 'shooting', 'place', 'hid', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'scared', 'safety', 'reached', 'land', 'ran', 'straight', 'lawyer', 'told', 'what', 'happend.3', 'lady', 'help', 'pushed', 'old', 'lady', 'top', 'stairs', 'breaking', 'legs', 'old', 'lady', 'drag', 'up', 'stairs', 'very', 'quickly', 'was', 'able', 'move', 'long', 'heavy', 'looking', 'mirror', 'arms.4', 'lady', 'help', 'could', 'ran', 'house', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'son', 'was', 'chasing', 'instead', 'ran', 'up', 'stairs.5', 'lady', 'help', 'could', 'have', 'jumped', 'way', 'circle', 'drew', 'least', 'get', 'way', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'pushed', 'mirror', 'stood', 'still', 'tell', 'went', 'long', 'time', '.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money']",N/A

Caroline  (Kate Hudson) is a thoroughly modern girl: confident, fearless, with not a spiritual or superstitious bone in her body.  Caroline is guilty for not being there for her father when she was estranged from him, and he passed away.  So she has thrown herself into hospice care, with the goal to go to nursing school.

Below, more of my impressions, with very limited SPOILERS.Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) is a highly competent nurse, living in New Orleans. One day she is contacted by Luke Marshall (Peter Sarsgaard) a lawyer who manages the estate of Mr and Mrs Devereaux, a wealthy aged couple living at an isolated residence deep in the bayous. Benjamin Devereaux (John Hurt) took recently a turn to worse and needs the assistance of a caregiver - attracted by the generous salary, Caroline accepts the offer, travels to the residence and meets her charge as well as the lady of the house, Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands). And then the film begins...As horror movies and thrillers go, this one is not bad at all. The atmosphere of mystery and later also fear is slowly and skillfully installed by small touches, never going too fast - and when we think that we start to understand things, well, the director took great care to provide us with some false leads and rather clever twists. The result as a whole is rather a success.The best thing in this film is that we can not really understand ALL the truth before the very final scenes - and then, some of earlier developments appear to us in their whole ugliness and horror... And that is actually the REAL shocker in ""Skeleton Key"". When in the middle of the film, during a flashback, a horrible scene of lynching was shown, I thought that this was probably as bad as things can go - but I didn't see anything yet...I am not exactly a big fan of Kate Hudson or Peter Sarsgaard, but in this film they did very, very well indeed. The two veteran actors, John Hurt and Gena Rowlands, are of course absolutely perfect in their supporting roles.The question of superstition and belief is central to this film - and it is treated surprisingly well, in a way Lovecraft would probably recongize (but no, this story is NOT linked to Cthulhu mythos). And there is also a warning in this film: ""Be careful what kind of garbage you feed your mind and soul with, because one day even they can be poisoned""...)))Bottom line, this is a quite clever, nicely done little supernatural thriller.

636559,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JNY3,Martin Asiner,"[1, 3]","Haunted house movies have long been popular, most of which have met with middling success.  In SKELETON KEY, director Iain Softley begins with what appears to be the standard haunted house story with Kate Hudson as a nursing student who takes a high paying job to be the caretaker of a paralyzed John Hurt who cannot talk or move.  Throughout the film, Hurt's eyes radiate the need to tell Hudson what caused him to be in his immobile state.  Gena Rowlands is his very weird wife who registers off the scale on incipient Hoodooism.  The first half of the film allows the house itself to take center stage.  It is creepy, broken down, and full of strange noises.  Little by little the audience learns of a lynching decades ago that suggests the house's spookiness is its source. One of the strong points that Director Softly maintains with a deft hand is the transition from garden variety haunted house machinations to a startlingly unexpected climax that ties together Rowlands, Hudson, and the earlier lynching.

636563,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B00005JNY3,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[0, 1]","A movie like ""The Skeleton Key"" relies almost solely on mood over matter. We have seen every plot element and scenario before: the Southern Gothic Louisiana, the Lady with a Secret, the House with a History, the Rattling Door in the Attic. This movie incorporates all these elements and even more, and yet somehow manages to transcend its genre-flick status and become something more.This is largely due to the elegance of its style. There is little here we do not expect: there are the requisite shots of steaming bayous and ominously moss-hung oaks, a young blonde heroine, the creepy attic filled with dusty relics of bygone days. There are also some very modern stylistic elements involved, such as quick cuts with the camera and shots that accelerate and then slow down seemingly at random, setting us on edge. What this film does well is blend the distinctly modern with the traditional Southern Gothic. The combination is effective.The plot is simple enough but should not be discussed too much, as so much of the film relies on the gradual revelation of its elements. Kate Hudson plays Caroline, a young hospice worker who, disillusioned with the dismissiveness of the work, decides to freelance. She finds employment in the Devereaux household, caring for Ben, a man paralyzed into silence by...something. His wife Violet does enough talking for the both of them, however; she is curt and suspicious of Caroline, and believes the young girl ""won't understand my house."" We suspect there is more to her and her decaying mansion than meets the eye, because in this sort of movie there always is.Eventually things begin to go very wrong. Caroline finds a strange door in the Spooky Attic that rattles of its own accord, and will not open with her Skeleton Key, which supposedly opens every door in the house. She finds a way in, as we know she will, and finds things of strange and dreadful import, as we know she must. There are mentions of the ominous Hoodoo, which sounds like Voodoo but, we are told, is not, because Voodoo is a religion, and ""God never had much to do with Hoodoo."" We learn of dark deeds in the house's past, and things we assumed were one way begin to look another. And it rains. A lot. The damp and the mud and the steam rising from the backwater all contribute to a feeling of ominous gloom.The pleasure of a movie like this is not that there is indeed more than meets the eye (there is), but how it is revealed. The Big Secret makes sense - as much as it needs to - but ultimately the style of the film and its presentation is what makes it worth seeing. The performances here are quite good, particularly for a film of this type. Kate Hudson has a peculiar translucence to her that suits Caroline's naivete, and her dewy youthfulness complements the aging decay of her surroundings. Gena Rowlands is convincing as the sharp-tongued Southern Lady, playing a character nearly 180 degrees from her fading belle in ""The Notebook."" And Peter Sarsgaard acquits himself well as the estate attorney who may or may not be all that he seems. But the film truly belongs to John Hurt, as the stricken Ben. He says nary a word, but his eyes convey volumes. He is clearly terrified of something, but in silent desperation is unable to say what it is.The ending, where most of the pieces come together and the Big Secret is revealed, works as long as one doesn't try to analyze the logic of it. It is all fairly complicated, and if one tries to fit the pieces together for oneself, the puzzle falls apart. Fortunately, ""Skeleton Key"" entertains enough to forestall logic; it may not make too much sense afterward, but while you're watching it, ""Skeleton Key"" delivers.",4,"""Skeleton Key"" unlocks Gothic gloom",1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,3686,"['movie', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'almost', 'solely', 'mood', 'matter', 'have', 'seen', 'plot', 'element', 'scenario', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'Louisiana', 'Lady', 'Secret', 'House', 'History', 'Rattling', 'Door', 'Attic', 'movie', 'elements', 'even', 'more', 'yet', 'somehow', 'manages', 'transcend', 'genre-flick', 'status', 'become', 'something', 'more.This', 'largely', 'due', 'elegance', 'style', 'little', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'are', 'requisite', 'shots', 'steaming', 'bayous', 'ominously', 'moss-hung', 'oaks', 'young', 'blonde', 'heroine', 'creepy', 'attic', 'filled', 'dusty', 'relics', 'bygone', 'days', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'modern', 'stylistic', 'elements', 'involved', 'such', 'quick', 'cuts', 'camera', 'shots', 'accelerate', 'then', 'slow', 'down', 'seemingly', 'random', 'setting', 'edge', 'What', 'film', 'well', 'blend', 'distinctly', 'modern', 'traditional', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'combination', 'effective.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'discussed', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'relies', 'gradual', 'revelation', 'elements', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Caroline', 'young', 'hospice', 'worker', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'dismissiveness', 'work', 'freelance', 'employment', 'Devereaux', 'household', 'caring', 'Ben', 'man', 'paralyzed', 'silence', 'something', 'wife', 'Violet', 'enough', 'talking', 'however', 'curt', 'suspicious', 'Caroline', 'young', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'house', 'suspect', 'more', 'decaying', 'mansion', 'eye', 'sort', 'movie', 'always', 'is.Eventually', 'things', 'begin', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', 'Caroline', 'strange', 'door', 'Spooky', 'Attic', 'own', 'accord', 'will', 'not', 'open', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'supposedly', 'door', 'house', 'way', 'know', 'will', 'things', 'strange', 'dreadful', 'import', 'know', 'must', 'are', 'mentions', 'ominous', 'Hoodoo', 'Voodoo', 'are', 'told', 'not', 'Voodoo', 'religion', 'God', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'Hoodoo', 'learn', 'dark', 'deeds', 'house', 'past', 'things', 'assumed', 'were', 'one', 'way', 'begin', 'look', 'lot', 'damp', 'mud', 'steam', 'rising', 'backwater', 'contribute', 'feeling', 'ominous', 'gloom.The', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'not', 'indeed', 'more', 'eye', 'how', 'revealed', 'Big', 'Secret', 'sense', 'as', 'much', 'ultimately', 'style', 'film', 'presentation', 'what', 'worth', 'seeing', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'film', 'type', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'peculiar', 'translucence', 'suits', 'Caroline', 'naivete', 'dewy', 'youthfulness', 'aging', 'decay', 'surroundings', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'convincing', 'sharp-tongued', 'Southern', 'Lady', 'playing', 'character', 'nearly', '180', 'degrees', 'fading', 'belle', 'Notebook', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'well', 'estate', 'attorney', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'truly', 'John', 'Hurt', 'stricken', 'Ben', 'word', 'eyes', 'convey', 'volumes', 'clearly', 'terrified', 'something', 'silent', 'desperation', 'unable', 'say', 'what', 'ending', 'where', 'most', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'Big', 'Secret', 'revealed', 'as', 'long', 'one', ""n't"", 'try', 'analyze', 'logic', 'fairly', 'complicated', 'one', 'fit', 'pieces', 'together', 'oneself', 'puzzle', 'apart', 'Fortunately', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'enough', 'forestall', 'logic', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'afterward', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'delivers']",N/A

The Fog was a dud at the box office, Exorcism of Emily Rose was more of a Law and Order Episode than a real movie, so why give The Skeleton Key a chance? Unlike it's predecesors, The Skeleton Key does not rely on special goory effects to lure in it's viewers or teen heart throbs from the WB to bring in the younger crowd. Instead, it focuses on what is supposed to make a movie transition smoothly - it's story.Kate Hudson is working at a retirement home and watches an old man die in front of her. What is more shocking is how the nurses dismiss him as simply ""another patient"" and insist that Hudson dumps his belongings out back. She is appalled by this, however, she doesn't necessarily show it when she tells the nurse he's dead. A little mistep, but the movie regroups.Fed up with the retirement home she is working at, she decides to be a caretaker at an old house in the swamps of Louisiana. The swamp may be creepy, but not as creepy as it's owner - or her mute and paralyzed husband.Curiousity and the Skeleton Key given to Hudson by the owner leads her throughout the numerous rooms of the house and up to where the main event takes place - the attic. After findings some hoodoo magic and conjuring spells in the attic, Hudson realizes that there is more to the house than just a southern woman worried about her dying husband.Hudson does an excellent job being the lead lady and even at times, resembles her mother, the great Goldie Hawn. The only flaw is that she mentions that she was not with her father when he died and she believes people should not die alone. She sucks us in to feel sorry for these people, however in the beginning she shows no compassion for the man who lay dead in front of her. Definite inbalance of character, but by the end of the movie her transition from sweet caretaker to a dilute form of a Charmed One.Unfortunately, it is a slim possibility that there will be a sequel to a movie like this with the twist of an ending it gave, unless Hudson is faking the outcome of events that happened in the attic.

She is told she is hired to help his wife out who is a little too old to care for him on his own. While staying at the house, she is given a skeleton key that she is told opens any door in the house. However, she finds a door in the attic that the key does no seem to open. Once she manages to get in there, she begins to uncover some strange hoodoo and begins to investigate the possibility that the old man did not have a stroke, and it may be hoodoo related. (I'm spelling that right btw, it's not voodoo)Opinion.The film starts off a little slow, but quickly the pace get's better and as things begin to unravel, you expect the film's outcome is going one way, but when everything does come together, it really was not what I was expecting. I did figure it out in about the last 5 minutes or so, but it's definitely not a movie that you can predict the outcome a mile away. The ending I found very interesting, and satisfying. So many horror and thrillers I have seen lately just blow it in the end, but this one did a perfect job of beginning, middle and end. I did not have a single complaint or thought on anything I thought might have made it better, nor any scenes I thought where just inserted for filler time.So why do I only give it 4 stars and not 5? Well, it's one of those movies that are great the first time you see it when you don't know what is going to happen next... but, a second time viewing? Once you've seen it, it's lost it's surprise twist in the end. Unfortunately it's not one of those movies you could watch again and again and enjoy even more each time discovering new things or what not. So it's not the perfect movie, but that's not to say it's not a great movie.

Well, I would highly recommend you watch it first to decide if you would ever watch it again and again or not?P.S: I couldn't agree more with people saying this film could do with a sequel or prequel... provided they don't call it &#34;Skeleton Key II&#34; and use a name completely different.

Softley builds the story slowly, marinating us in the spooky atmosphere of a dilapidated Louisiana bayou mansion, until we're just as hypnotized as the hapless heroine. That heroine, played by Kate Hudson, comes to the house to help a tart-tongued old woman (Gena Rowlands) take care of her stroke-immobilized husband (John Hurt). From there, she gets far more embroiled than she'd like in the hoodoo-laced history of the house and its inhabitants. Working from a screenplay by Ehren Krueger (""The Ring""), Softley places the pieces of the story in jigsaw-puzzle fashion; the placement of the last piece knocks you for a loop with a surprise ending you'll be thinking about for days. Hudson--who has much of her mother's charm, plus a certain pizzazz all her own--gives a totally satisfying performance as the heroine; Hurt (in a nearly wordless performance) and Rowlands also are excellent, as is Peter Sarsgaard as the family lawyer. As with all good thrillers, ""The Skeleton Key"" messes with our minds, rather than our gag reflexes.

After losing one of her patients, Caroline decides it's time for a change and accepts a job (over $1,000 a week with free room and board) caring for Ben Devereaux (John Hurt), an elderly man who has been rendered an invalid, deep in the Bayou of Louisiana.  However, the dream job slowly turns into a nightmare when the mysteries of the house begin to reveal themselves.Ben, who hasn't been able to speak or walk since suffering a debilitating stroke in the house's attic, seems to be trying to communicate or warn Caroline about something.  Things get even stranger when Ben is found during a thunderstorm crawling along the roof of the porch.  Although reassured by Luke (Peter Sarsgaard), the Devereaux's lawyer, Caroline finds herself under the watchful eye of Violet (Gena Rowlands), Ben's wife, who, other than demanding that he be given his ""remedies"" throughout the day, insists that there should be no mirrors in the house.In the meantime, Violet has given Caroline a ""skeleton key"" that is supposed to unlock all the doors inside the house.  When Caroline finds a mysterious door in the attic that won't open, her curiosity gets the better of her and she tries to find out what's on the other side of the door.  Once in, she quickly realizes that the odd room holds a number of items related to Hoodoo, a form of old magic completely different from voodoo.Caroline, who is determined to help Ben, becomes increasingly intrigued by this despite her claims that she doesn't believe in it.  However, she quickly learns of some of the practices of Hoodoo and what happened to two of the house's servants, Justify (Ronald McCall) and Cecile (Jeryl Prescott Sales), when caught using the magic.  But will Caroline be able to save Ben and herself or is it already too late?One of the best things about ""The Skeleton Key"" is that it keeps your attention throughout the entire movie.  Whether it's Violet coming up to the attic while Caroline is sneaking around in there or it's seeing a mirror somewhere in the house, you can't help but be glued to your seat to see what will happen next.While Kate Hudson and Peter Sarsgaard are good, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt bring a little extra to the film.  Rowlands plays the character of Violet completely opposite of the aging Allie in The Notebook.  At first you believe Violet is an aging woman set in her ways but then you slowly start to wonder if there is a more sinister side to her.  John Hurt (known for his portrayal of Mr. Ollivander in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" and as Kane in ""Alien"") barely utters a word throughout the entire film.  However, through facial expressions and other actions, you understand that this person is in some sort of torment.  There is a particular scene where Carolyn holds a mirror to his face and we get the feeling that, without seeing or hearing anything ourselves, Ben is seeing something horrible.Although the plot is decent, there are a few things, especially the last twenty to thirty minutes that can be confusing.  I found myself thinking about a few scenes, particularly the Justify/Cecile flashback and even the ending, a few days after seeing the movie, questioned a few things and wondered if I had followed the story right.""The Skeleton Key"" is a thriller without a lot of special effects or gore.

Similar to the Gift and the Others, it is not scary, but does its best to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.Kate Hudson plays Caroline, a live in nurse who is hired by an elderley southern woman in the bayous of Louisiana to care for her dying husband Ben, who has just had a stroke and only has weeks to live. Caroline receives a skeleton key, which opens every door in the house, except for a small room in the attic where Ben had his stroke. Eventually forcing her way into the room, Caroline discovers a world of hoodoo, which at first she brushes off as superstition, but the longer she stays in the house, the more she begins to believe in the magic, and fears Ben is in trouble, believing his illness is all in his head and his wife Violet is trying to force a spell upon him.For the first hour of the film, director Iain Softley manages to scare his audience, but as the twists are slowly revealed, the film becomes less frightening and slightly more predictable. Gena Rowlands and John Hurt work well within the script without showing too much of their true talents, while Kate Hudson really looks like she enjoyed the role of Caroline. Peter Sarsgaard is a pleasure to watch, he is a very fine actor who's character comes across the way audiences would expect, leaving you vulnerable for the twist at the end.Special features include a few short featurette's, deleted scenes and a directors commentary.

And if you thought, you know, that magic made you sick... you might believe in a magic cure? "" so says Caroline Ellis, the young Hospice worker,played by Kate Hudson.Hoodoo (Not Voodoo, it's different. Hoodoo is an old African American magic that only works if you believe in it.) is at play in this southern thriller. Who knew from Voodoo? Caroline Ellis,(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who has thought about nursing school and who takes a job as a live-in caretaker in a sinister, decrepit plantation house located deep in the Louisiana Delta. This is a movie that purveys the darkness of the delta within the spectacular views of New Orleans before Katrina.  Brings back memories to all of us. Caroline gradually discovers that nothing is as it first seemed, the old man is being held prisoner against his will, the house is possessed by voodoo spirits, and she  may be trapped by their evil spell.  Gena Rolwands plays Violet Devereaux. She inches her character ever closer to going over the top before reining her back in at the last moment. We believe that she is evil personified. Her husband, Ben Devereaux, is played by John Hurt. He has suffered a stroke and cannot speak or move. He is able to convey via his eyes the menacing horrow that is his, and Caroline Ellis is bound to save him. His acting via his eyes and facial expression is superb. Kate Hudson does a memorable job of playing this role, and her talent for acting is noted. This is a thriller that kept my interest. I was not prepared for the shocking ending, but was not surprised. This is not a movie that would have a so-so ending. This is one of the better thrillers in a while, and is certainly worth your time. The views of New Orleans before the Storm are worth viewing the entire movie and is more that worth your time.This is a movie of characterization, IMO. Each character brings the suspense and moodiness that is needed to sustain the movie.  Gena Rowlands, as always steals the scenes but John Hurt and Kate Hudson more than keep up their end. Voodoo/Hoodoo, all the same, brings the magic to this movie.

It looked just like another haunted house movie with cheap special effects. But my friends dragged me into it, so I went and saw it. After watching it, I was actually surprised as to how much I liked it.The story is about Caroline (played by Kate Hudson), a nursing student who is tired of her old job. She takes a job in Louisiana to take care of a stroke victim (played by John Hurt), and his aging wife (played by Gena Rowlands). She moves into the house with them, and that starts experiencing strange things, like the paralyzed patient trying to communicate with her, mirrors missing on the walls, and a secret door in the attic which keeps thumping constantly. She feels like there is something bizarre going on and gets convinced that Ben, the patient, was paralyzed by some force, and that she can find a way for him to become normal again. What she doesn't know that there is a deeper power working at hand, which she must figure out before she is the next victim.The beginning is a little slow for a while, since nothing really goes on for the first fifteen minutes. But once Caroline sees the door in the attic, the movie picks up, and towards the end, it is a constant roller-coaster ride. Furthermore, most of the movies we see these days are not scary at all, and make us jump only because of the insane sound effects. But this movie actually created a creepy atmosphere because of the characters and the story, rather than relying on the gore and sound effects, which is why I enjoyed watching it. Gena Rowlands did a fantastic job in her acting. Come on, she is 75 years old, and she has to be commended for playing her role so well for her age. Kate Hudson, John Hurt and Peter Sarsgaard played their parts adequately. Director Iain Softley did a good job in creating this eerie movie and keeping the audience in suspense till the end.So, if you liked watching movies such as `The Others', then you will enjoy `Skeleton Key'.",5,I don't believe....,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,2038,"['how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'mean', 'initially', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'looked', 'just', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'friends', 'dragged', 'so', 'went', 'saw', 'watching', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'it.The', 'story', 'Caroline', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'nursing', 'student', 'who', 'tired', 'old', 'job', 'job', 'Louisiana', 'take', 'care', 'stroke', 'victim', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'aging', 'wife', 'played', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'house', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'things', 'paralyzed', 'patient', 'trying', 'communicate', 'mirrors', 'missing', 'walls', 'secret', 'door', 'attic', 'thumping', 'constantly', 'something', 'bizarre', 'going', 'convinced', 'Ben', 'patient', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'force', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'become', 'normal', 'again', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'deeper', 'power', 'working', 'hand', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'next', 'victim.The', 'beginning', 'little', 'slow', 'while', 'nothing', 'really', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'once', 'Caroline', 'door', 'attic', 'movie', 'up', 'end', 'constant', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'Furthermore', 'most', 'movies', 'see', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'make', 'jump', 'only', 'insane', 'sound', 'effects', 'movie', 'actually', 'created', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'story', 'rather', 'relying', 'gore', 'sound', 'effects', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'acting', 'Come', '75', 'years', 'old', 'be', 'commended', 'playing', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'age', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'played', 'parts', 'adequately', 'Director', 'Iain', 'Softley', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'eerie', 'movie', 'keeping', 'audience', 'suspense', 'end.So', 'liked', 'watching', 'movies', 'such', 'Others', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Skeleton', 'Key']",N/A

636592,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JNY3,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[2, 6]","""The Skeleton Key"" starts off very, very promisingly: Kate Hudson, Geena Rowlands and Peter Sarsgaard are very fine actors, and director Iain Softley has proven himself with several behind-the-camera successes such as 'Hackers' and 'The Wings of the Dove'. It's got a compelling premise, a fine pedigree and next-to-no competition in the Haunted House Movie genre.What a shame, then, that after a very strong opening forty-five minutes, the movie wimps out and delivers a climax and resolution that could just as easily have belonged to any other substandard horror movie.Caroline Ellis (Hudson) is a jaded hospice nurse with a new job, caring for stroke victim Ben Deveraux (John Hurt, badly underused here) in his own home. She meets and befriends his wife Violet (Rowlands) and their attorney Luke (Saarsgard), and begins to learn something of the Hoodoo superstitions surrounding the house, as things start to go bump in the night.'The Skeleton Key' is beautiful to look at, for the most part - the rainy, washed-out colours of the Bayou remind you very much of horror masters like Hideo Nakata and David Lynch, and as the director, Softley creates a hugely atmospheric visual style with the claustrophobic and flashback elements of the screenplay. Hudson and Rowlands do very credible jobs in their respective roles as jaded young woman and superstitious wife, and the script, like the setting, is languid and slow, but never lacking in eventfulness. 'The Skeleton Key' starts great.And then, sadly, it all goes badly wrong. Without giving anything away, let me just explain that, had Violet never really explained the story of the house to Caroline, and just let events speak for themselves, we might have had some creepy ambiguity spun out of the atmospheric visuals and ambivalent script to create the fear for us. Instead, as with pretty much all the Hollywood horror movies of late, the script decides that no, the audience really must be stupid, so let's spell everything right out for them, just so's there's no confusion.And in a movie that propses to create fear and tension out of the hazy shades-of-grey between superstition and belief, this is a fatal mistake. The latter part of the movie, because it explains everything, pretty much holds up signs to the audience that read ""Plot Twist Coming Soon!"". It's disappointing, and made all the worse because of an essentially powerful beginning. Flashback scenes are showy and ring false, and the penultimate scenes could be seen coming from a million miles away.All in all, 'The Skeleton Key' isn't really worth owning, and should be thrown over at the video library if you see anything else you think you might like. Southern Gothic it is not, neither is it scary.

I see a lot of complaints about a racist spin written here, but just like Kate Hudson's caregiver character says about the magic of hoodoo, I don't believe.  This is just a movie, folks, not a political platform, or they would have had somebody running for office in it, don't you think?  In order to enjoy a picture of this genre, you have to suspend some of your disbelief, particularly if magic is involved.This is fun, creepy entertainment that only made me scream once during the first half of the picture.  I don't need to go into the plot like so many others, except to say that this is the best role I've ever seen Kate Hudson play.  I wasn't sure she was a good actress until this.  I liked her character Caroline;tough, gutsy, but goodhearted.  I'm also pleased that there was no sappy romantic angle to the story to weigh it down like so many other movies of this type.The entire cast was excellent, particularly Gena Rowlands as the woman of the house who clearly doesn't like Caroline when she comes to take care of her husband Ben (John Hurt, who scarcely utters a word).  There is a secret room in the attic and a dark history of the old plantation house that makes for a compelling story centered around the power of magic.

I won't blab away the plot, but Kate Hudson is solid in, what I think, is her first lead role. She handles it with fierce conviction. It helps that she had to deal with the champions, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt. Peter Saarsgard is, as usual, confident and in control. Director Iain Softley handled this film well, and the DVD offers generous extras. It was well thought-out, and the casting of the great Gena Rowlands and the great John Hurt are reason enough to see this film.

636597,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JNY3,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","There haven't been too many ""creepy"" movies that have met expectations so far in 2005.  Like fans of THE RING everywhere, I was disappointed in the sequel (although it wasn't too bad...just not up to the original).  DARK WATER, while atmospheric and interesting, didn't provide enough of a payoff to be worthwhile.  And WHITE NOISE, BOOGEYMAN even HIDE AND SEEK, just pretty much stunk.  So by comparison, SKELETON KEY comes off as a near masterpiece.It isn't.  It's only better than these other films, but it's still a lot of sound and fury signifying very little.  The best thing it has going for it is the atmosphere of the New Orleans swamps.  I've visited that area of the country, and it certainly feels weird.  All the hanging moss and the wetness everywhere work on your nerves after awhile.  You can certainly believe that people carrying on strange rituals could easily find secret places for their efforts to be conducted.  And you can believe the even the homes of the affluent can succumb to rot and decay at an early age.Much like DARK WATER did a great job of making everything and everyplace in it feel gray and low-rent...SKELETON KEY draws upon its locations to make everything feel slimy and a bit mildewy.  This adds greatly to the sense that things are just a little...well...off.The plot concerns Kate Hudson, who works as a hospice caregiver, taking on the role for a nearly dead stroke victim (John Hurt).  She moves out to his decrepit mansion, where she will live with just Hurt and his doting wife (Gena Rowlands).  Occasionally, she'll be visited by the oily lawyer of the family, played by Peter Sarsgard.  You know that something is amiss, and because of the small cast, it's pretty easy to figure out WHO something is amiss with.  So the movie mostly has Kate Hudson pitted against everyone else...but at least it doesn't give away too much until the final few scenes.  I saw one quote from a critic on a TV ad who said it was the best ending since THE SIXTH SENSE.  This is a complete joke.  The ending is unexpected...but unlike with the SIXTH SENSE, when the ""truth"" is revealed, you don't have the feeling that you need to see the movie again right away to see the clues you missed.  You just kinda shrug, say ""oh, I see"" and move on with your life.Partially that's because you don't have too much invested in the characters.  Kate Hudson is fairly capable in the role, and certainly has lots of energy (and it's good she didn't try a Cajun accent!!)...but the part is the generic ""young lady in distress.""  She mostly gets herself into trouble because of her own curiousity.  In THE RING and DARK WATER, our heroines are fighting for the lives of their children...they are deeply vested in the outcome.  In SKELETON KEY, Hudson is mostly assuaging her curiosity (although later she's trying to help John Hurt...but her dedication to him feels VERY unconvincing...it comes out of nowhere).  So we aren't terribly concerned about her fate.  Gena Rowlands, who is obviously having a blast hamming it up in this film, is a fine actress, but her character veers so much between menacing and harmless that we can never satisfactorily latch on to her as either someone to empathize with or root against.  John Hurt is mostly a non-factor...he only manages to force out a few words in the whole film...highly appropriate because he's a stroke victim.  And Sarsgard, one of the best actors working today (you must see SHATTERED GLASS), mostly relies on this air of being just a little smarmy and sweaty.  In KINSEY, this gave his character a lazy, sensualist manner.  In SKELETON KEY, it's just lazy.The film kept me interested.  I liked seeing a horror film that was set in the deep south...it seems like it's been awhile since a thriller was set there.  And at least it didn't involve a mean little girl with long black hair draped over her eyes!  It is by no means a classic, but I think it is satisfying enough and worth a look.  It's rated PG-13, and while I think that's appropriate, it would probably be okay for ages 11 and up, or so.  Mostly creepy violence...no bad language that I recall and no sex/nudity (except a gratuitous NEAR nude bathroom scene with Hudson).",3,Maybe 3.5 stars.

It's a straight horror film that works far more on atmosphere than actual jumps (though the fan of jump moments will certainly get a few in here), the kind of thing that, as with extreme horror, has had America lagging about a decade behind Japan's horror film industry. Thank your lucky stars, however, that an enterprising group finally landed a deal with Universal, because The Skeleton Key is good stuff, one of the better pieces of horror celluloid to come out of Hollywood in a lot of years.The story concerns Caroline Ellis (Almost Famous' Kate Hudson, who as she gets older looks more and more like Jill Hennessy-- and this is a good thing), a young hospice care worker, disillusioned with the state-run home she's been working for. She accepts a private job about an hour outside New Orleans caring for Ben (John Hurt, absent from horror films for far too long), who had a stroke about a month before she comes on the scene. Ben's wife Violet (Gena Rowlands) doesn't take to Caroline at first; it takes the intervention of the family lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, of Jarhead and Boys Don't Cry fame), to convince Caroline to stay on. By the time weird things start happening in the famously haunted house, Caroline has already grown too attached to Ben to leave.The movie is not without its shortcomings, which cannot be revealed without spoilers, but which will be readily obvious to most viewers starting about three-quarters of the way through the film. They are not, however, enough to counterbalance the movie's wonderfully-done atmosphere, fine performances by all main cast members, and a general sense of foreboding.

This movie had depth. Kate Hudson stars as Caroline, a young Hospice nurse who seeks out a job she spots in the paper after realizing her field of work is all about the money and nothing at all about caring for the patients. Unfortunatly, Caroline has found her dream job at an old run down mansion in the swamps of Louisiana, where a cratchety old woman (played by Geena Rowlands) with high expectations runs the show. The movie plays out like the old thrillers of the 50's and 60's. It is stylish and the character developement is good. I would have to say that Kate Hudson plays Caroline in a semi-monotonous manner and she is SOMEWHAT unlikeable and a tad bit unemotional throughout the first three quarters of the movie, but she did a fair job at the parts that mattered. The unfortunate part of the movie is the EXCRUCIATINGLY dissapointing ending. I was so incredibly let down by the ending that I wished I hadn't even seen the movie at all. I felt like 2 hours of my life were robbed from me! I don't know why horror movie's are all of a sudden running amuck with unhappy endings, but I think it is a trend that should be stopped.

The film is unsurprisingly great. The Extras are the definitive element for this  package.The film is basically Body Jumping. If, in my view, the film makers had included more of the material that spooks in LOST SOULS, or even the scarey elements of CONSTANTINE, I probably would like it even more. However, the film makers focus on this being a ""Supernatural Thriller"" film.The detail in this film is beyond good. All of the Hoodoo and Voodoo elements are the real deal, which is something lacking in some films ( The makeup artists even used protection spells in the trailers).The film shows great details in and around the now ""Old"" New Orleans. The story is one to be experienced ... certainly, what you don't believe cannot hurt you ... but ??THE EXTRAS: The production features are beyond good. Plenty of detail about what has been done. Even the elements about the background of the film are so superb. The commentary done by the director is masterful, and great exposition. The very nice extras are stories from the leads, who give part of themselves in showing what they have behind the characters of the film.Contrary to what the director says, the pivotal character is not Kate Hudson, but it is John Hurt ...Kate is practically the quiet eye at the center of the storm, but John is part of the storm, and in many respects the reason for the storm.Masterful film ...

Hired by a lawyer named Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, 'Shattered Glass' and 'The Cell'), Caroline meets with Violet and Ben Devereaux (Stunning performances from Gena Rowlands and John Hurt).  Ben is completely incapacitated from having a stroke in the attic of the old house, and Violet is a no-nonsense woman who acknowledges the need of someone to help her out but prefers her isolation.Caroline takes the job and moves in, taking instructions from Violet on her ""remedies"" for Ben.  Caroline finds it odd that there are no mirrors in the house, but Violet passes it off as old people not needing any reminders of age.  Even as Caroline attempts to settle into the decrepit and yet intriguing old house, strange events begin to happen.  Ben attempts an escape, somehow managing to get through his window and fall to the ground below.Violet begins to slowly reveal some of the area, and the house's, secrets to Caroline as she warms up to her, telling her tales of HooDoo, a black-heritage form of magic similar to VooDoo.  Violet assures Caroline that HooDoo only works if the victim `believes' in it, but Caroline notices signs of HooDoo protection spells all over the Devereaux's property.Caroline becomes involved deeper and deeper into the sinister and disturbing setting of the old plantation house, and with her skeleton key that will open every door, eventually discovers the part of the attic where Ben had his stroke, and the frightening oddities inside.  Caroline knows that there is something wrong inside the house, and something wrong with Violet's explanation of Ben's illness.  Caroline, having failed to help her father when he was ill, vows to do everything she can to help Ben.'Skeleton Key' is a beautifully creepy movie, set deep in the mysterious bayou lands, using the backdrop of swamps and an outstandingly dark and unique plantation house to set the atmospherically sinister environment for this tale of understated terror.  There is no gore, but what the film lacks in blood it makes up for in spookiness.If you are looking for an intense psychological thriller with a large dose of black magic and a wonderfully twisted ending, then make sure you pick up a copy of 'Skeleton Key'.

Not only that, the story was engaging, the acting first rate, and the scenery...wow! I could almost feel the humidity, my own skin almost soaked with sweat.Kate Hudson plays the heroine, Caroline, a young woman with some guilt issues. She's an aspiring nurse, current hospice worker, who takes a more meaningful position at rundown plantation with a fascinating, not to mention, disturbing history. Ben is her patient, and his wife, Violet is abrupt, set in her ways, but seemingly harmless...at first. Does Violet know more than she's saying? Is Caroline in danger? Why does Ben need her help? Should she try to unravel a secret 90 years in the making? Unlike most heroines in this genre, Caroline is smart.

It's early in the morning and my brain isn't functioning at full speed (I do have a coffee here). I completely agree with Richard Roeper about the ending.I think he mentioned how the movie is more than o.k., and the twist (if it could be called one, to be honest) is a suprise! How's that for a conflicting statement. I kinda wish it would've been more focused around the hoodoo aspects in the movie, mainly because of the obvious fact that it really drove the movie, particularly the second half. I really think the entire aura of The Crescent City and it's surrounding bayou subset of life. It truely is a whole other world there. Kudos to Iain Softley for keepin' it real, and further accolades for not going 'lowest common denominator' and showing a montage of 'gators thrashing about as Hudson drove into the deepest recesses of the bayou, on her way to the gnarly, old mansion. Kate Hudson may also have a new genre to call her home! One could only hope.Even though the supporting cast borders on non-descript, in the nicest way of course, they're spot on, entirely believable and seemed to come into focus, again, about midway through. Skeleton Key is definitley Hudson's movie though. For something that I wasn't too pumped to see in the first place, it turned out to be a kind of hidden gem. The soundtrack is kick-ass too. Pounding thunder, surging and pouring rain, legs slopping through the muddy driveway, slamming doors and dusty, crackling music brought me to a whole new level of immersion, for a third time, starting around the midway point. Iain Softley may have a future if he continues to make good movies like Skeleton Key.",4,Suprise!

I did not find the movie at all spooky, for it to be spooky the characters would have to act like they were afraid and only John Hurt's character does that. Hudson's character is curious and fearless throughout - i would like to have heard more screams and seen more shaking in her - when she visits the attic for instance. Another dissapointing aspect is that the villains themselves are not evil enough to exude the kind of malevolence needed to affect strong feelings in the viewer, we can even sympathise with their motivations. I found the ending unsatisfactory, this is a fantasy/horror movie so there is no artistic urge for a realistic ending, there is no need to do THAT to the main character. I would have preferred to see her persevere in some way. Although in a sense it is fitting, a young woman who loves old people, old people wanting to be young....

636626,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00005JNY3,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","Gena Rowlands and John Hurt are great actors and I love seeing anything they're in but this story fails because of the way it is told: the villains are the interesting ones here and their unique method of predation, but the story is told from the victim's point of view, said victimization occurring at the story's end, and the Kate Hudson character, as written, is uninteresting. she is a pleasant enough character, pretty, blond and kindly. she is something like a nurses aid and genuinely cares for her patients. she wants to be a nurse, has an african american female friend, and occasionally stares longingly at what appears to be a photo of her and her dad taken when she was younger, but taken together, this does not make her interesting or even sympathetic. she doesn't register with the audience. she does nothing and has no skill set. not enough happens around her forcing her to engage or step up and take charge, to make her interesting.  nothing significant happens until the end of the story when she attempts to resist the villains, and is woefully outclassed. I don't mind if the heroine loses in the end, but I'd like to care about her, be impressed with her, and want her to escape. she has heart, as is demonstrated with her first patient, but she is not shown to be capable. the story needed to highlight her intelligence, she needed a demonstrable skill set, something to show that even though she fails in the end, it is not due to any lack on her part.the story is about two monsters who live in the backwaters and how they lure unsuspecting victims and steal their lives. the story is about the two predators, but we don't even know they exist until the beginning of act 3.if your monsters, your story glam let's call them, don't appear until the end of the story, then you'd better have something else to offer your audience until then. a character who is pretty and nice is insufficient.acting all around is fine.P.S. ideas on how to fix the problems:(1) the Kate Hudson character needs some glam of her own, in her case, a skill set and a subplot to demonstrate it. Danny in Stephen King's The Shining had the shining and that was his glam. The Kate Hudson character's skill set needn't have been supernatural but to even present a believable possible escape from beings who have supernatural abilities, she needed above average intelligence along with a skill set. otherwise it's a rout, as this story is, so why give us a character who has no chance against beings so much more powerful than she; and(2) the monsters needed to be a part of the story, and not in their disguises, by at the latest the beginning of Act 2. A screenplay usually has 3 acts. having your monsters appear in the final act just will not do if you're trying to use the fright element. what would Jaws have been without the opening sequence? And what about Act 2 in that film where it took the boy at the beach. Imagine that story without the shark and you get nothing but alot of good acting. villains are far and above the most important element of a story; to not bring them onstage until the story is nearly over is a waste of your primary element, like making a hamburger with a half ounce of meat and placing it only in one corner of the buns - that's no burger.I know, this film was supposed to be a vehicle for Kate Hudson, but a vehicle is only a vehicle if it works. this film obviously didn't kill her career but it didn't strengthen it either. One character dominating a story, even a pretty, kindly character, is not a story. What if Ripley in Alien had been just pretty and kindly? Who'd have cared. But no, Ripley is capable and because of that, and because she learns from each and every crew member who is lost to the beast, she survives. In this story, the Kate Hudson character is not to survive, I understand that, but I still wanted her to put up a decent fight - at the least her character, if being unable to save herself, should have been capable enough to prevent the monsters from taking future victims when their present stolen bodies wear out. That at least would've been something: she would've been defeated but she would've defeated them as well. Then she would've been a warrior, a heroine. In this story, all she figures out is the villain's transference mechanism, but she is unable to communicate it to others and is therefore unable to prevent the future victimization of innocent ones.This story could've been so much stronger, but the writer and the director didn't grasp it's potential, or perhaps they had to shift the story to load it so a name would take it, thereby getting it made. As written, the villains are the strongest characters so it would've been great if top african american talent would've taken the monster roles, but given the element of slavery, and added to it strong african american actors, perhaps whoever oversees film content in our country nixed it. probably we'll never know. after seeing django unchained, and 12 years a slave, where top african american talent were put in power roles, as if to suggest (as in the way of propaganda), that there were power slaves in slave times, it is possible (though I'll probably never know) the slavery element in the monster roles of this film could have been impacted by propaganda and politics. who knows what our art would be like if it were actually democratized. probably we'll never know.",2,this

No, it isn't really scarey - no, it isn't the most unpredictable thriller out there.But what it is is an atmospheric ghost story set in one of the spookier settings in America (the Louisiana bayou) with a strong cast, excellent cinematography, and best of all, an uncompromising ending that is sure to delight fans of tragic horror, and irritate those who suckled at the teat of the Hollywood formula of good predictably triumphing over evil.The basic premise involves Kate Hudson's Caroline taking a job as hospice to a dying man (John Hurt) and his wife (Gena Rowlands).  Along the way, she meets the lawyer who is helping to settle the will (Peter Saarsgard).  After taking up residence in the back-waters homestead, Caroline begins to detect signs that Cajun superstition (hoodoo) may be responsible for both the old man's condition AND its cure.  This sets of a race for her to try to heal the man (whom she sees as a symbol of her own dead father) while his wife seems to be trying to interfere.The mis-steps of this film are easy to point out - the opening third has way to many of the predictable (and seemingly required) jump scenes where a person is suddenly standing behind her and the music pops, only for us to see it is just a regular old person.  These scenes are annoying in these movies because they are so easy to see coming and serve no purpose other than to maybe put the viewer in the ""mood"" to be scared - this might be forgivable if the remainder of the film is in fact scary, but SKELETON KEY is not = it is suspenseful, to be sure, but not scary.A further flaw is the ease with which the villains can be picked out - I spotted the first within the first half-hour, and guessed at the true identity of the other as well about ten minutes before it was finally revealed.  To be fair, we are an audience that is VERY tough to fool anymore (thanks also to SIXTH SENSE).But neither of these flaws hurt the overall presentation.  Like I hinted at before, the film has the good grace to pick the most logical ending and stick to it, without all the drawn-out ""second endings,"" and the, ""she was only pretending to be dead"" type drag-ons that plague so many other of todays thrillers.  For this reason alone, the entire film wraps up very nicely into what turns out to be a nice ""campfire spook story"" of a film - neither disappointing, nor life-changing - just a pleasantly spooky way to pass a stormy Saturday night with your mate.",4,Essentially a neat little ghost story with a non-Hollywood ending that earned it it's jeers.,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,3047,"['SKELETON', 'KEY', 'long', 'list', 'recent', 'movies', 'were', 'killed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'could', 'even', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'also', 'STEALTH', 'SERENITY', 'UNDERWORLD', 'biggest', 'problem', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'gem', 'called', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'surpassingly', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'other', 'movie', 'been', 'judged', 'film', 'environment', 'SKELETON', 'KEY', 'predictably', 'short', 'mark.People', 'who', 'disliked', 'film', 'did', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'were', 'expecting', 'be', 'not', 'film', 'bad', 'No', ""n't"", 'really', 'scarey', ""n't"", 'most', 'unpredictable', 'thriller', 'there.But', 'what', 'atmospheric', 'ghost', 'story', 'set', 'one', 'spookier', 'settings', 'America', 'Louisiana', 'bayou', 'strong', 'cast', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'best', 'uncompromising', 'ending', 'sure', 'delight', 'fans', 'tragic', 'horror', 'irritate', 'who', 'suckled', 'teat', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'good', 'predictably', 'triumphing', 'evil.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Caroline', 'taking', 'job', 'hospice', 'dying', 'man', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wife', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'way', 'lawyer', 'who', 'helping', 'settle', 'will', 'Peter', 'Saarsgard', 'taking', 'up', 'residence', 'back-waters', 'homestead', 'Caroline', 'detect', 'signs', 'Cajun', 'superstition', 'hoodoo', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'old', 'man', 'condition', 'cure', 'sets', 'race', 'try', 'heal', 'man', 'whom', 'symbol', 'own', 'dead', 'father', 'wife', 'be', 'trying', 'interfere.The', 'mis-steps', 'film', 'are', 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'opening', 'third', 'way', 'many', 'predictable', 'seemingly', 'required', 'jump', 'scenes', 'where', 'person', 'suddenly', 'standing', 'music', 'pops', 'only', 'see', 'just', 'regular', 'old', 'person', 'scenes', 'are', 'annoying', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'easy', 'see', 'coming', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'maybe', 'put', 'viewer', 'mood', 'be', 'scared', 'might', 'be', 'forgivable', 'remainder', 'film', 'fact', 'scary', 'SKELETON', 'KEY', 'not', '=', 'suspenseful', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'scary.A', 'further', 'flaw', 'ease', 'villains', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'spotted', 'first', 'first', 'half-hour', 'guessed', 'true', 'identity', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'finally', 'revealed', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'audience', 'VERY', 'tough', 'fool', 'anymore', 'thanks', 'also', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', '.But', 'flaws', 'hurt', 'overall', 'presentation', 'hinted', 'film', 'good', 'grace', 'pick', 'most', 'logical', 'ending', 'stick', 'drawn-out', 'second', 'endings', 'was', 'only', 'pretending', 'be', 'dead', 'type', 'drag-ons', 'plague', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'todays', 'thrillers', 'reason', 'alone', 'entire', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'nice', 'campfire', 'spook', 'story', 'film', 'disappointing', 'life-changing', 'just', 'pleasantly', 'spooky', 'way', 'pass', 'stormy', 'Saturday', 'night', 'mate']",N/A

The ""shock ending"" you will be able to surmise from about 20 minutes into the film.  The rest of us will probably be in the dark.  I know the ending would have surprised me had I not had someone who took a course in voodoo/hoodoo and who preceeded to explain to me how the movie would most likely end.Also in reference to the ending, a couple professional reviewers (Roger Ebert for example) have said that the ending makes little sense as you think about it.  True, it might not make sense to people not versed in hoodoo culture, but as I said in the previous paragraph, it makes perfect sense when you think about the myths surrounding hoodoo.  So, don't believe those reviewers who apparently don't know much about that particular culture.  According to my friend, the movie does a pretty decent job incorporating it into the movie.  Of course its sensationalized and reel-ified but the things that happen in the movie are considered parts of the hoodoo culture.That said, The Skeleton Key does a good job mixing the typical ghost story with voodoo culture.  As you learn through the movie, there is a difference between voodoo (a religion) and hoodoo (spells and incantations).  Kate Hudson's Caroline will also learn this as she decides to take care of an elderly man (John Hurt from Alien) who is dying and his wife who needs help.  The story moves from there and if you don't know much about it, I would recommend not learning anything else about it.The acting is, of course, pretty good from John Hurt to Gena Rowland.  Kate Hudson does her thing and actually does a good job playing an atypical romantic lead.  The atmosphere is also done really well with the creepy swamps and the house accentuating the mood.  Unfortunately, for a scary movie and one by Ehren Krueger of Ring fame, the Skeleton Key isn't too scary.  There are a couple jump out moments (in which the camera stays close to Kate Hudson and then moves quickly as someone you're not expecting appears in the scene) but, atmosphere aside, is not that creepy.However, considering some of the poor choices we have had for pg-13 horror films recently (Ring 2, Cursed, Boogeyman, Darkness et al) and some lamer rated R movies (Alone in the Dark and Hide and Seek for example) Skeleton Key does a good job of incorporating a good story with a classic ghost story concept.  I think what I appreciated the most was the lack of CG.  After the deluge of CG created horror, this movie hearkens back to movies like The Others where the mood and terror and, overall, a good story wins over special effects.Not the best, but pretty damn good.

636636,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNY3,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[127, 141]","Almost every film you watch requires some level of suspension of disbelief. Some genres (Sci-Fi, Horror, Musicals, etc.) require more than others (drama). I am willing to give any film the benefit of the doubt and fully ""buy into"" the world the filmmakers attempt to create. Because of this, I expect a lot from the filmmakers in return. If they expect me to take that leap of faith, I expect them to deliver believable characters, an interesting, involving story and to make me laugh, believe, get frightened, whatever the story would dictate. If they do that, I usually enjoy the film. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen enough. If they don't, the film becomes a mess. ""The Skeleton Key"", the new thriller starring Kate Hudson, is a film requiring a fair amount of suspension of disbelief. The key to unlocking its success is to make everything believable. Does it accomplish that?Caroline (Kate Hudson), a hospice worker in New Orleans, becomes so disillusioned with her job that she answers an ad for a private in-home caregiver in a parish about an hour out of the city. Upon arrival, she meets Violet (Gena Rowlands), the wife of her new patient, Ben (John Hurt). Violet is reluctant to have strangers in her house, a large plantation home that has seen better days, but their lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, ""Kinsey"") insists that she get help for Ben during his last days; he had a heart attack while working in the attic and is now paralyzed on both sides of his body, unable to speak or move. Caroline accepts the job and soon receives a skeleton key that will open every door in the house. Exploring the house, she soon makes her way up to the attic and begins to discover some strange things.""The Skeleton Key"", directed by Iain Softley (""K-PAX"") and written by Ehren Kruger (""The Ring Two"", ""The Ring"", ""Arlington Road""), is that strange thing; a thriller with good performances, good writing, good directing and only the occasional cheap thrill.All of the performances in the film are very good. Perhaps the biggest surprise is Kate Hudson who takes a 180* turn from the ""comedies"" she has been subjecting us to for the last few years. She does a really good job in this very dramatic role. As a 25 year old dealing with issues of her father's death, Hudson's Caroline becomes a caregiver. Disillusioned by the economics of her job in the city, she takes a job in the country, caring for one man. She soon realizes that perhaps there is more gong on than meets the eye. During the course of the film, she tries to figure things out. Unlike most thrillers or scary movies, Caroline seems to have a head on her shoulders. She doesn't believe in ""Hoodoo"", an offshoot of voodoo which features prominently in the film, or spirits or ghosts, so when she makes the inevitable trip to the ""dark room"", in this case, the attic, it happens during the middle of the day. It is still a bit frightening, but at least she has the common sense to not make this trip in the dead of night. As she learns things, she uses this new knowledge to help her. She also asks for help. In most thrillers, the female lead usually lacks all of these traits. This, and the gravitas or her back story, help to give Caroline a resonance, a weight that we don't often see.Gena Rowlands, is, as always, good. Violet is the big question mark in the story. Is she involved in the sinister goings-on, or not? Generally, this type of character would have wild mood swings, one moment, she is evil incarnate, the next, sweet as pie. Thankfully, Rowlands plays it more subdued. What really helps the character is that she is presented as an old woman ""set in her ways"", ""old-fashioned"", ""distraught over her husband's condition"". Because of this, her character is more subtle and there are more shades of gray to all of her actions, which can be attributed to her ""set-ways"". Even when she is being nice to Caroline, she is a bit abrupt and when she is abrupt, we get a sense there is a shade of kindness. Rowland's performance aids the well-written character keeping us guessing what and if there is something lying underneath.John Hurt's performance is the trickiest because he uses almost no words throughout. The victim of a stroke, paralyzed on both sides, Ben can't move a muscle. But his eyes move, and they dart back and forth, or convey the anguish or terror he feels. At one point, Caroline is bathing him and gets soap in her eye, using a compact to make sure it is gone, she remembers Violet's admonition to keep mirrors out of the house ""because they show the spirits walking throughout"". Caroline opens the compact and places it in front of Ben's face. When she does this, Ben begins thrashing about. Finally, able to soothe him, Caroline apologizes. It really is amazing to experience all of these emotions through an actor who basically uses only his eyes throughout the performance.The film is very well-written and well-directed. Throughout, writer Kruger and director Softley give us clues, and even a few red herrings, but some of these are so well-hidden that we aren't able to piece everything together until the very end, when the secrets are revealed to Hudson's Caroline. At this point, your mind will click back to all of the clues and you will, hopefully, realize how clever everything is. The ending has a neat little twist, which I didn't see coming, but now that I know what it is, it all makes sense. How refreshing for a film to make sense, to connect the dots through the many layers of the story.Director Softley seems tailor made for this film. His last film ""K-PAX"" was a mess, but in ""Key"", he immerses us immediately in Caroline's world, starting the film without any credits of any kind. As we learn about Caroline's back-story, her character becomes more believable and real to us. After she arrives at the plantation, and is given the skeleton key, there are many shots of the interior of locks, as the key opens another door, and Caroline explores the house. This is an interesting metaphor for her learning secrets. The film is also remarkably free of the dumb thriller and horror film clich&eacute;s so rife in other examples. As mentioned, Caroline asks for help, looks around in the middle of the day, and learns. There are also few, if any cheap thrills generated by ""stray black cats"". There is one scene in which Caroline wakes up in the middle of the night and immediately jumps out of bed wearing only panties and a t-shirt to investigate a sound. If it were me, I would've thrown on a pair of sleep bottoms before running around in a large, dark plantation house. But these types of typical horror/ thriller movie clich&eacute;s are few and far between here.""The Skeleton Key"" is a surprisingly well-written, acted and directed thriller complete with a clever twist which is well connected to the rest of the story.",4,"Surprisingly good, surprisingly effective thriller",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,6842,"['Almost', 'film', 'watch', 'level', 'suspension',

636637,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JNY3,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","Skeleton Key is one of the more surprising thriller/chillers that has come along in quite some time.  Kate Hudson is Caroline, a nursing student who leaves a job at a nursing home to take a position in a home health care environment, deep in the Louisiana Bayou.  She comes to the old, southern home of the Devereaux's. This is one of those overgrown, mossy, humid, stifling old homes.  Her patient Ben played by John Hurt is an invalid who has suffered a major stroke and cannot talk or walk.  Gena Rowlands is his wife Violet, a rather abrupt woman who doubts that Caroline can handle the job.  Also in the mix is the Devereaux's attorney Luke who actually hired Caroline.Immediately Caroline notices several strange things about the old mansion.  First, there are no mirrors in the house at all.  Violet brushes off Caroline's questions about this.  Second, Caroline gets a skeleton key that unlocks every door in the house.  While exploring the old attic, she finds a door hidden behind a shelf but the key will not unlock that door.  Again Violet dismisses her, saying the key has never worked on that door and they've never opened it in all the years they've been at the house.  Add to that, Ben seems to be trying to communicate with Caroline, asking for help.Eventually opening that door in the attic, Caroline discovers off books and items, and old records which seem to be intoning magical rituals.  Her friend Jill, a native of the bayou explains this as ""hoodoo"" an old African magic that only works if you believe in it.  Violet finally admits that many years ago two black servants were caught practicing this magic and were killed by the man they worked for and that the room in the attic was theirs.  Caroline becomes convinced that Ben is under the influence of this magic and is determined to try and help him and soon finds herself entangled in a deadly plot of ancient magic.Skeleton Key relies heavily on its permeable atmosphere and does so very effectively.  The frights are mostly shrouded and hinted at in very Lovecraftian style.  Rowlands is terrific as the slightly sinister mistress with deep secrets hidden away.  Hurt, playing primarily a role with very little dialog is also great.  He conveys more with his eyes and expressions than many actors could with their voices.  Other than perhaps being just a bit predictable, Skeleton Key is a nice little thriller.Reviewed by Tim Janson",4,A VERY EFFECTIVE LITTLE THRILLER,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2414,"['Skeleton', 'Key', 'one', 'more', 'surprising', 'thriller/chillers', 'come', 'quite', 'time', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Caroline', 'nursing', 'student', 'who', 'job', 'nursing', 'home', 'take', 'position', 'home', 'health', 'care', 'environment', 'deep', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou', 'old', 'southern', 'home', 'Devereaux', 'one', 'overgrown', 'mossy', 'humid', 'stifling', 'old', 'homes', 'patient', 'Ben', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'invalid', 'who', 'suffered', 'major', 'stroke', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'walk', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'wife', 'Violet', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'woman', 'who', 'Caroline', 'can', 'handle', 'job', 'Also', 'mix', 'Devereaux', 'attorney', 'Luke', 'who', 'actually', 'hired', 'Caroline.Immediately', 'Caroline', 'several', 'strange', 'things', 'old', 'mansion', 'First', 'are', 'mirrors', 'house', 'Violet', 'Caroline', 'questions', 'Second', 'Caroline', 'skeleton', 'key', 'door', 'house', 'exploring', 'old', 'attic', 'door', 'hidden', 'shelf', 'key', 'will', 'not', 'unlock', 'door', 'Again', 'Violet', 'saying', 'key', 'never', 'worked', 'door', ""'ve"", 'never', 'opened', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'house', 'Add', 'Ben', 'be', 'trying', 'communicate', 'Caroline', 'asking', 'help.Eventually', 'opening', 'door', 'attic', 'Caroline', 'books', 'items', 'old', 'records', 'seem', 'be', 'intoning', 'magical', 'rituals', 'friend', 'Jill', 'native', 'bayou', 'hoodoo', 'old', 'African', 'magic', 'only', 'believe', 'Violet', 'finally', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'black', 'servants', 'were', 'caught', 'practicing', 'magic', 'were', 'killed', 'man', 'worked', 'room', 'attic', 'was', 'theirs', 'Caroline', 'convinced', 'Ben', 'influence', 'magic', 'determined', 'try', 'help', 'soon', 'finds', 'entangled', 'deadly', 'plot', 'ancient', 'magic.Skeleton', 'Key', 'heavily', 'permeable', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'very', 'effectively', 'frights', 'are', 'mostly', 'shrouded', 'hinted', 'very', 'Lovecraftian', 'style', 'Rowlands', 'terrific', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'mistress', 'deep', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'away', 'Hurt', 'playing', 'primarily', 'role', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'also', 'great', 'conveys', 'more', 'eyes', 'expressions', 'many', 'actors', 'could', 'voices', 'Other', 'perhaps', 'being', 'just', 'bit', 'predictable', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'nice', 'little', 'thriller.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",N/A

636642,A15H0OGLXJ9FC6,B00005JNY3,T. R. Rak,"[2, 10]","""Skeleton Key"" is well-acted enough and genuinely intriguing and frightening in places, which is why I give it two stars.  Beyond that however, it violates its own rules of story etiquette and the morality of the horror genre generally (which dictates very clearly that ONLY the deservedly wicked get their comeuppance), unless of course, we turn the genre upon its head and are to be convinced (and indeed we are here) that the once persecuted black slaves and now, their ghostly incarnations, of ""Father Justice"" and ""Cecile,"" are TRULY and INTRINSICALLY EVIL in the WORST POSSIBLE ways.  Because by the end of this film, THAT is the ONLY conclusion which can be reasonably drawn.Which puts ""Skeleton Key"" squarely in the same category as another dread film, ""Burnt Offerings,"" which is terrifying in its own right but conflagrates the rules of horror too, and kills off ALL the good characters, NOT even the deservedly and unequivocally EVIL ones, with ZERO redemptive epilogue whatsoever.Good horror must ALWAYS play fair, and keep the doors left open for redemption.  Unless it's of the Rob Zombie school of ""Devil's Rejects"" or something of that inferior ilk.  Yet even there, the BAD SHERIFF gets his just desserts.  The rules of horror proper:  The bad go to hell, naturally.  The vampire gets its heart torn out and its head chopped off.  The werewolf bites the silver bullet.  The good, battered but otherwise untrammeled by the forces of darkness, live to star in the sequel.  Seriously though.  To DAMN the TRULY good is to break the rules of horror which is impermissible (and Kate Hudson's character in ""Skeleton Key"" is a veritable saint).  A horror film without redemption tears the envelope of the genre and descends into an unwatchable nihilistic wasteland of celluloid flotsam, dreck and derision.So you must understand, Gentle Reader, that it becomes immensely difficult to review ""Skeleton Key"" adequately without probing it beneath its ectoplasmic surface; unless we do so, risking only the slightest chance of a ""spoiler,"" any review here worth its salt (or ""red brick dust"" perhaps) is simplistic and unworthy of you expending your time and energy perusing this evaluation.Therein the problem lies:  ""Skeleton Key"" is ""spoiled goods"" to begin with, and what COULD have been a 5-star effort is nearly on par with the banal likes of ""Friday the 13th.""  But in the case of the latter, we don't CARE who gets killed.  Kill them all; we just laugh, and laugh some more when the next installment of ""Scary Movie"" is released.  So there's a big difference between the two pictures.  ""Skeleton Key"" has the MAKINGS of brilliance, but ultimately betrays us by DESTROYING AN EMPATHIC CHARACTER!  Rule #1:  You *NEVER* ""OFF"" the ONE character the audience gives a damn about.When an audience willingly suspends its disbelief, it is incumbent upon the medium's director (story teller) to play fair.  ""Skeleton Key"" doesn't do that.In what sense?First and foremost, Kate Hudson is a genuinely sympathetic figure in the sublimely rendered role of ""Caroline,"" a nurse turned live-in caregiver who - in the context of the screenplay ""Skeleton Key"" - and by the ""rules"" of the traditional horror genre generally (often credited to EC Comics, which revolutionized the genre of American horror yarns - in print, on radio, film and TV - post-World-War-II) - does NOT deserve the hell to which she is sentenced in this misbegotten film's final denouement.Forget ""it only works if you believe,"" a commonly repeated phrase in the script.  This is a ridiculous excuse for the terrifying fates beset upon the film's innocent victims, and an oft-repeated mantra in the movie which is purposeless.  The fact of this story is, the ""evil ghosts"" are VERY real indeed (not ghosts at all as it turns out) and it doesn't matter whether one believes in them or not.  It only matters that the caregiver run as fast as she or he can AWAY from the old Louisiana Hoodoo mansion if she (or he) wants to hang on to his or her body and soul for another day.As ""Cecile"" comments at the end of the movie (paraphrasing), ""God I hope I can have a black body next time.""  To which the (now white as well) ""Father Justice"" replies (again paraphrasing):  ""It's almost impossible anymore because the black folk around here know too much about all this stuff.""  I daresay ""Skeleton Key"" treads some VERY sticky, icky racial ground here as well.  ""Ugly"" comes to mind.  And supposedly Justice and Cecile are/were ""righteous folk.""  By the rules of horror, one CAN forgive them for what they might have done 90 years ago as tortured, tormented field slaves.  But now?And the whole ""device"" with the mirrors doesn't work except to fill time and create suspense.  Because if Violet is actually Cecile (which she is) for the better part of the film, and Peter Sarsgaard is actually Father Justice (which he is, having stolen the young man's ""years"" and sentenced him to hell, soul and all, condemning the poor lawyer - mind and consciousness - into the now ""spell paralyzed,"" useless dying body of John Hurt - prior to Kate Hudson's arrival), why would there be any soulless ghosts hobnobbing about the mansion to begin with?  No reason at all save the aforementioned ""atmospherics.""  Still, we could easily forgive writer Ehren Kruger his numerous plothole peccadilloes; after all nobody's perfect, and nobody's script is either.  But what we CAN'T forgive is what he does to Kate Hudson's tender-hearted, Florence-Nightingalesque character ""Caroline.""  Her demise is unforgivable, and COMPLETELY unnecessary to the story, ruining what otherwise might have been a top-drawer, American gothic masterpiece reminiscent of the best southern-decay story-weaving enchantments of Mr. William Faulkner.Kate Hudson wants to save John Hurt, not realizing that he isn't even who he seems to be anymore.  When she applies the Hoodoo spell on him to remove the curse against him, he really ought to be a bit more articulate in response.  Like screaming, ""Father Justice STOLE MY BODY and LEFT ME A CRIPPLE!  I'm a 30-year-old lawyer inside this rotting old flesh!  Get me OUT of here NOW!!!""  Instead he just yelps feebly: ""Help!  Help!  Help!""And what's with the disappearing ink on the blanket that read ""HELP ME!""  Ridiculous little nonsensical nuances like these pervade.  If nothing else, this picture gets high marks for superfluous filler passing itself off as ""thriller.""The character of Violet (Gena Rowlands, well acted), of course, is lying (or rather - EQUIVOCATING marvelously) to Caroline (through Cecile's teeth) when she tells the story about the ""history"" of the mansion, and about the slaves Father Justice, his woman (wife?) Cecile and the two white master's children, a boy and a girl.  Violet conveniently leaves out the part about how the children's parents hanged the WRONG people after finding the children upstairs in the attic inside the ""Hoodoo circle"" surrounded by Justice and Cecile after the bacchanalic dinner party!  Now THAT'S *GOOD* HORROR.  It reminds this author of a ghastly and nastily effective short grand-guignol cautionary fable by the 19th century maestro of the macabre Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, titled ""Hop Frog.""Mistaken Identity is often a MASTERFUL technique used to convey unspeakable horror.  ""Oops!  Honey, I murdered our kids!""  But this is not a spoiler review.  It's a review about a movie spoiled.If ""Father Justice"" was so ""just,"" as Violet tells the story to Caroline, dispensing boons - to the kindly and deserving; and rough justice - to the cruel, oppressive and psychotically sadistic, well then she's flat-out lying again.  Because as we discover to our grimmest dissatisfaction, Justice and Cecile ONLY care about keeping THEMSELVES young (through black Hoodoo magick).  And of course, killing whatever young men and women they can in the process!  Cecile and Justice are a DESPICABLY SELFISH, NEFARIOUS PAIR!  Damned be to EVERYONE, except themselves; murder to the GOOD and the GODLY alike, so long as these two devils live on forever.  Even to Caroline, who's as close to being a Mother Theresa figure, sent directly from Heaven, as anyone might imagine - cutting such an attractive figure as she does - she hasn't a prayer against the blackguards of hell.And that's where the ethics of the horror genre disintegrate into red brick dust, leaving ""Skeleton Key"" useless, unable to lock Bluebeard's Closet shut.  Even the greatest of horror epics such as ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Omen,"" ""The Shining"" and ""Suspiria"" had CLEAR RULES!  Ultimately ""good"" wins out over ""evil"" in each one of them.  The whole purpose of great horror is pedagogic:  At its core, horror is a morality play writ large, lugubrious and blood-slick sticky.  Yet the ethics of the greatest horror tales are as simple and child-like as our aboriginal core fear of the dark, or what's LURKING in that dark; that sabre-toothed tyger-beastie whispering as we walk briskly past the graveyard at 2 a.m. on a wind-howling October's morn:  ""Be a GOOD GIRL, be a GOOD BOY, or else!""""Skeleton Key"" tells us, it doesn't matter if we're good or not.  The devil wins, hands down.  Hell commands dominion over Earth, regardless whether or not we believe.  Abandon all hope therefore.  Ye who enter.Ye who watch.So why watch?  Abandon this film unless you have no hope, and see this world only as a nihilistic abyss, where no good deed goes unpunished.  Assuredly you can think of a better way to occupy your time than by punishing yourself for just under 2 hours ingesting this farraginous, malignantly monstrous mess of a movie.",2,The Biggest Horror

636643,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNY3,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 3]","What is good about `The Skelton Key' or whatever the film is praised for, can be summarized like this: A) Good acting (no doubt about it); B) Good, spooky production designs (again, no question); and C) Big surprising ending. I am willing to admit all these things. But except for a few occasional scares, the rest of `The Skelton Key,' or the long way leading us to the finale is ruined by bland and boring execution.One of the key ideas of the film is ""to believe"" or ""not to believe."" Sorry, but I couldn't believe the film's story a single moment, which is set in the modern South. We meet Caroline young idealistic hospice worker played by Kate Hudson, who is fed up with the detached way of treating the terminally-ill patients in the hospital she works in as volunteer. Caroline quits, and decides to be hired by an old lady (Gena Lowlands) living in an old mansion to take care of her husband (John Hurt) who is paralyzed in bed.From this point, things start to look unbelievable, as if it totally forgot that the story is set in today's America, not the 18th century. There are thirty rooms in the house, and one is, the owner says, always locked. But Caroline sneaks into it, and finds weird things. Well, that doesn't end there as it is a Gothic thriller, and she starts to believe there has been something terrible done, and there is also something terrible going on there.No clich&eacute;s is unused when British director Iain Softly describes the South. Hoodoo (not Voodoo) rituals, streetcar, swamps, gumbo, and so on. Every showy camera work is employed - slow motions or fast forwards - but none of them work. More unaccountable is the heroine's behaviors, which are getting silly as the film goes on. Caroline understands the modern idea of medical science, intelligent enough to know about QOL of patients, but this hospice worker is easily led into the world of ghost stories, and begins to act like a medicine man. We are required to believe the motive of Caroline who is attached to the old man in bed, and the way she behaves with hair, chalk, and blood. Sadly Iain Softly, it seems, is not ready for this difficult job.Ultimately it is the conclusion that would mostly impress the audiences. I know, it is Ehren Kruger, the screenwriter of `The Ring' and `The Ring 2' and from this fact the quality of The Skelton Key' can be inferred. It has a great idea, is very atmospheric, but largely generic if seen closely.",2,"Southern Gothic from the Writer of 'The Ring': Clever Ending, Very Long Way to Reach There",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2438,"['What', 'good', 'Skelton', 'Key', 'whatever', 'film', 'praised', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'A', 'Good', 'acting', 'doubt', 'B', 'Good', 'spooky', 'production', 'designs', 'again', 'question', 'C', 'Big', 'surprising', 'ending', 'am', 'willing', 'admit', 'things', 'few', 'occasional', 'scares', 'rest', 'Skelton', 'Key', 'long', 'way', 'leading', 'finale', 'ruined', 'bland', 'boring', 'execution.One', 'key', 'ideas', 'film', 'believe', 'not', 'believe', 'Sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'story', 'single', 'moment', 'set', 'modern', 'South', 'meet', 'Caroline', 'young', 'idealistic', 'hospice', 'worker', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'detached', 'way', 'treating', 'terminally-ill', 'patients', 'hospital', 'volunteer', 'Caroline', 'be', 'hired', 'old', 'lady', 'Gena', 'Lowlands', 'living', 'old', 'mansion', 'take', 'care', 'husband', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'paralyzed', 'bed.From', 'point', 'things', 'start', 'look', 'unbelievable', 'totally', 'forgot', 'story', 'set', 'today', 'America', 'not', '18th', 'century', 'are', 'thirty', 'rooms', 'house', 'one', 'owner', 'always', 'locked', 'Caroline', 'weird', 'things', 'Well', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Gothic', 'thriller', 'believe', 'been', 'something', 'terrible', 'done', 'also', 'something', 'terrible', 'going', 'there.No', 'clich', 'eacute', 'unused', 'when', 'British', 'director', 'Iain', 'Softly', 'South', 'Hoodoo', 'not', 'Voodoo', 'rituals', 'streetcar', 'swamps', 'gumbo', 'so', 'Every', 'showy', 'camera', 'work', 'employed', 'slow', 'motions', 'fast', 'forwards', 'none', 'work', 'More', 'unaccountable', 'heroine', 'behaviors', 'are', 'getting', 'silly', 'film', 'Caroline', 'modern', 'idea', 'medical', 'science', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'know', 'QOL', 'patients', 'hospice', 'worker', 'easily', 'led', 'world', 'ghost', 'stories', 'act', 'medicine', 'man', 'are', 'required', 'believe', 'motive', 'Caroline', 'who', 'attached', 'old', 'man', 'bed', 'way', 'hair', 'chalk', 'blood', 'Sadly', 'Iain', 'Softly', 'not', 'ready', 'difficult', 'job.Ultimately', 'conclusion', 'would', 'mostly', 'impress', 'audiences', 'know', 'Ehren', 'Kruger', 'screenwriter', 'Ring', 'Ring', '2', 'fact', 'quality', 'Skelton', 'Key', 'can', 'be', 'inferred', 'great', 'idea', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'largely', 'generic', 'seen', 'closely']",N/A

636647,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JNY3,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 3]","The Skeleton Key is a surprisingly captivating thriller even though it's not scary visually. It succeeds to provide a creepy mood from beginning to end, and it's style is kind of like The Others. Don't expect this film to offer any freaky visuals like images in The Ring or Amityville Horror. I enjoyed this film, because the story is fairly original, despite the not so pleasing but suprise ending, and the leads all delivered convincing performances.This film is not about ghost, even if it initially seemed to be a haunted house movie, it's actually about a form of black magic called ""hoodooism"". Kate Hudson(Caroline) is a caretaker to Violet's(Gena Rowlands) ailing husband Ben(John Hurt) who was paralyzed when he had a stroke, but that isn't the real cause. Eventually Caroline figured out that there's something really strange and frightening secrets about the old house when she unlocked the door in the attic. Caroline was recommended by her friend Jill to seek the help of a Hoodoo specialist in order to unsolve the mystery and eliminate the spell that was cast onto Ben. She soon realized that Violet was the evil force and had masterminded the plot, but she had no idea that the estate attorny Luke(Peter Sarsgaard) was also part of the whole scheme......Kate Hudson dominates most of the screentime and she's pretty impressive in her first horror film. John Hurt had a few strong moments when he had to deliver the terrified reactions. Peter Sarsgaard who was brilliant in last year's Kinsey managed to turn in a fine supporting performance as the villian wearing the mask of a handsome and charming man. The strongest performance came from Gena Rowlands, who literally chewed up most her scenes opposite Hudson and she gets to go from an outspoken loving wife to a rifle-shooting demented bitch from hell.",3,Gena Rowlands Steals The Show!,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,1822,"['Skeleton', 'Key', 'surprisingly', 'captivating', 'thriller', 'even', 'not', 'scary', 'visually', 'provide', 'creepy', 'mood', 'beginning', 'end', 'style', 'kind', 'Others', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'offer', 'freaky', 'visuals', 'images', 'Ring', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'story', 'fairly', 'original', 'not', 'so', 'pleasing', 'suprise', 'ending', 'leads', 'delivered', 'convincing', 'performances.This', 'film', 'not', 'ghost', 'even', 'initially', 'seemed', 'be', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'actually', 'form', 'black', 'magic', 'called', 'hoodooism', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Caroline', 'caretaker', 'Violet', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'ailing', 'husband', 'Ben', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'when', 'had', 'stroke', ""n't"", 'real', 'cause', 'Eventually', 'Caroline', 'figured', 'out', 'something', 'really', 'strange', 'frightening', 'secrets', 'old', 'house', 'when', 'unlocked', 'door', 'attic', 'Caroline', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'Jill', 'seek', 'help', 'Hoodoo', 'specialist', 'order', 'unsolve', 'mystery', 'eliminate', 'spell', 'was', 'cast', 'Ben', 'soon', 'realized', 'Violet', 'was', 'evil', 'force', 'had', 'masterminded', 'plot', 'had', 'idea', 'estate', 'attorny', 'Luke', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'whole', 'scheme', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'most', 'screentime', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'first', 'horror', 'film', 'John', 'Hurt', 'had', 'few', 'strong', 'moments', 'when', 'had', 'deliver', 'terrified', 'reactions', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'last', 'year', 'Kinsey', 'managed', 'turn', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performance', 'villian', 'wearing', 'mask', 'handsome', 'charming', 'man', 'strongest', 'performance', 'came', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'who', 'literally', 'chewed', 'up', 'most', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Hudson', 'go', 'outspoken', 'loving', 'wife', 'rifle-shooting', 'demented', 'bitch', 'hell']",N/A
636648,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00005JNY3,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 1]","Any movie that has Peter Sarsgaard in a supporting role, and fails to show him in any of the trailers, or mention his name anywhere on the DVD box, is confusing to me. On one hand, it's clear that they had the desire to look like a legitimate thriller with a solid cast, but on the other hand, it's also clear that they think their audience doesn't include those who care about thrillers with solid casts. This is the mystery of Skeleton Key.At times it feels like it's not sure exactly what kind of movie it is. Is it another typical horror film masquerading as something deeper by using a well-known female star? Or is it a smaller, brooding film about the fine line between Voodoo and Hoodoo and the dark secrets that can hide in the swamp?Ultimately, it's really a mixture of both. There are the obligatory scenes of Kate Hudson in the shower, walking around the house in her underwear, and the cheesy one-liners that have come to define the horror genre. But there are also some genuinely creepy effects, a good deal of mystery, and a pretty surprising and satisfying ending.The extras on the DVD are pretty extensive and make it a pretty complete package, including 20 minutes of deleted scenes, a brief history and description of Hoodoo and Voodoo, and Kate Hudson telling a ghost story from her own life.Really, I have the feeling that The Skeleton Key is more the product of the Louisiana film legislation that gives huge incentives to production companies if they film the majority of their film in Louisiana than anything else. Start looking for more and more films set in the swamp that may not have received green lights from studios, except that the budgets end up being greatly reduced by this legislation.",3,Pretty much your typical horror movie,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,1721,"['movie', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'supporting', 'role', 'show', 'trailers', 'mention', 'name', 'anywhere', 'DVD', 'box', 'confusing', 'one', 'hand', 'clear', 'had', 'desire', 'look', 'legitimate', 'thriller', 'solid', 'cast', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'clear', 'think', 'audience', ""n't"", 'include', 'who', 'care', 'thrillers', 'solid', 'casts', 'mystery', 'Skeleton', 'Key.At', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'masquerading', 'something', 'deeper', 'using', 'well-known', 'female', 'star', 'smaller', 'brooding', 'film', 'fine', 'line', 'Voodoo', 'Hoodoo', 'dark', 'secrets', 'can', 'hide', 'swamp', 'Ultimately', 'really', 'mixture', 'are', 'obligatory', 'scenes', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'shower', 'walking', 'house', 'underwear', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'have', 'come', 'define', 'horror', 'genre', 'are', 'also', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'effects', 'good', 'deal', 'mystery', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'satisfying', 'ending.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'pretty', 'extensive', 'make', 'pretty', 'complete', 'package', 'including', '20', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'brief', 'history', 'description', 'Hoodoo', 'Voodoo', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'telling', 'ghost', 'story', 'own', 'life.Really', 'have', 'feeling', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'more', 'product', 'Louisiana', 'film', 'legislation', 'huge', 'incentives', 'production', 'companies', 'film', 'majority', 'film', 'Louisiana', 'anything', 'else', 'Start', 'looking', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'set', 'swamp', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'received', 'green', 'lights', 'studios', 'budgets', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'legislation']",N/A
636649,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005JNY3,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","A couple of things make this movie a worthwhile addition to the horror/thriller genre: one - the beautiful cinematography that brings to life the creepy lushness of the Louisiana Bayou, two - some very good supporting roles, by Gena Rowlands [the creepy old hag, Violet Devereaux], and John Hurt [as the invalid Ben, Violet's husband], & finally three - the central theme of hoodoo wch is a kind of folk magic. That being said, the story itself centers around the character of Caroline [Kate Hudson] who is engaged as a young caregiver to Ben. She is a stay-at-home nurse, and so has to not only put up with Violet's eccentric character, but also with the spooky atmosphere of the old house she now inhabits with all its sinister undertones. The plot itself is quite interesting...Caroline suspects that Violet is deliberately harming her husband, Ben, and also that hoodoo is involved, so she delves deeper into the subject. She also tries to enlist the help of Violet's family lawyer, Luke [Peter Sarsgaard in a ho-hum role] to help solve the mystery. Let's just say that Caroline finds her cynicism in hoodoo challenged by some of her experiences, and the rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of her involvement with the Deveraux couple. Kate Hudson does not seem to be able to get into her character here, just the usual expressions of fear/puzzlement/bravado, and in my opinion, gives a lacklustre performance. Only Gena Rowlands as the menacing Violet and John Hurt as the helpless Ben lend credence to their roles. The scary effects are few and far between but there is a sense of menace and evil thanks to the way the scenes are set up. The plot twists too will keep viewers interested to know what's coming next.
