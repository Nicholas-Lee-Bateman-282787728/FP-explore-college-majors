Very unrealistic in many ways--the most glaring having the sun set in the water.  No way Jose...never happened. Good actors and actresses with good scripts did not elevate this enough for me to appreciate.For those who were not there maybe, but I could not like the show. Very unrealistic; 'Tour of Duty' was more realistic for t.v.

The late '80's produced several great quality drama shows, and ""China Beach"" was certainly among the top three. A show that respected both the viewer and men and women in uniform, it was a show that became better and better with each season. There are very few actors or actresses who have created characters as enduring and memorable in impact as Dana Delany did with Colleen McMurphy. An exceptional cast that had a lot of chemistry together that made the show all the more powerful.... Great casting, great writing, great acting, great production.I used to tape the shows and watch them. Sorry the only one I have kept was the 2-hour finale that was shown in July 1991. ""China Beach"" had an incredible beginning as seen in this VHS tape and an incredible ending. The finale finds all the members of the five and dime unit coming back together for a reunion years after the war is over and they have returned to the States. The final scene with Colleen McMurphy at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. with her daughter brought tears and emotions to my eyes like no other television show I had seen.I would definitely be a candidate to buy the complete episode boxed set of this show in DVD format if it is ever released.",5,"If all televison drama was like ""China Beach""...",1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,1276,"['would', 'be', 'declining', 'Neilson', 'ratings', 'late', ""'80"", 'produced', 'several', 'great', 'quality', 'drama', 'China', 'Beach', 'was', 'certainly', 'top', 'three', 'show', 'respected', 'viewer', 'men', 'women', 'uniform', 'was', 'show', 'became', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'characters', 'enduring', 'memorable', 'impact', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'did', 'Colleen', 'McMurphy', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'had', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'together', 'made', 'show', 'more', 'powerful', 'Great', 'casting', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'production.I', 'used', 'tape', 'shows', 'watch', 'Sorry', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'kept', 'was', '2-hour', 'finale', 'was', 'shown', 'July', '1991', 'China', 'Beach', 'had', 'incredible', 'beginning', 'seen', 'VHS', 'tape', 'incredible', 'ending', 'finale', 'members', 'five', 'dime', 'unit', 'coming', 'back', 'together', 'reunion', 'years', 'war', 'have', 'returned', 'States', 'final', 'scene', 'Colleen', 'McMurphy', 'Vietnam', 'Memorial', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'daughter', 'brought', 'tears', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'other', 'television', 'show', 'had', 'seen.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'candidate', 'buy', 'complete', 'episode', 'boxed', 'set', 'show', 'DVD', 'format', 'ever', 'released']",China Beach / Premiere Episode VHS

264661,AGRR05FH945HR,630176627X,Steven Cain,"[14, 15]","My apologies for writing a second review of this classic tape, but I just wanted to add a couple of things...Firstly, for those who might have surfed in vain, the Five and Dime, the 510th Evacuation Hospital, never actually existed. There was a US military facility at China Beach, but it was an R & R facility, having no surgical units, unlike Cam Ranh Bay, for example, which did have the 12th USAF Hospital, until 1972. To be correct, I think it became the 483rd in 1969, but it seems to have been referred to as the 483rd/12th USAF Hospital until its departure in 1972.China Beach is based partly on the late Lynda Van Devanter's book, Home Before Morning: The Story Of An Army Nurse In Vietnam (available through Amazon.com) and is something of a composite of a number of different people's experiences.Some female Vets have reservations about the series, and I totally respect them. Those brave women were actually there, and at some risk to their own lives. The 6th CC at Cam Ranh Bay was attacked by VC sappers in 1969 and about 20 buildings were destroyed, in one of which, two Army Nurses were only saved by a faulty fuse on the satchel charge that was thrown through their window. The Enemy's 'legitimate target' list included the chapel and the nurses' hooches. Geneva what?Flaws or not, China Beach is a wonderful tribute to the courageous men and women who took care of the wounded from a largely conscript Army, whose average age was 19 (in WW II it was 26).While they may not always have been treated as Vets, the Army, Air Force and Navy nurses who served in Vietnam are legally recognized as Veterans, having been part of the military, although some combat vets seem reluctant to recognize them as 'real vets'. Maybe they should watch China Beach.As a footnote, the American Red Cross women (who appear in some China Beach episodes), including the SRAO field personnel (the Donut Dollies), who often took considerable risks, flying out to Fire Bases and Landing Zones all over VN, are not recognized as Veterans by the Government, by virtue of their 'civilian' status. Even though many of them still suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Maybe the Government should watch China Beach, too.All of the women who served in Vietnam are Veterans. For those who went out with the USO, like the wonderful Martha Raye and Connie Stevens, there should also be an Honorary Veteran category.
