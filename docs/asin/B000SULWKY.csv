1087894,A1X7YF2QY6UYQO,B000SULWKY,R. G. Bright,"[1, 2]","Not sure why anyone would want to watch the seventh and final season. That year HBO went to England to film the series on a shoestring budget and with the exception of a couple actors (Daniel Craig) but the stories are horrible and confusing. But the first six seasons are magnificent. A killer Santa Claus, mad scientists, Timothy Dalton as a werewolf, a killer tattoo, Don Rickles as a ventriloquist with a secret, vampires, decapitations and all sorts of mayhem. Most of the stories were adapted from Shock Suspense, Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Horror and Haunt of Fear comics of the 1950s. Brad Pitt, Demi Moore, Billy Zane, Martin Sheen... name them and they were on the show. Episodes were directed by Arnold Schwarteneger, Michael J. Fox, Tom Hanks and other hollywood celebrities. If you like chilling murder stories like ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS and can stand HBO's tollerance with sex and violence and gore (no limits), you will enjoy these morbid tales with shock endings.
