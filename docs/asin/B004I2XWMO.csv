1410382,A1Y1Q4G1A9ID6V,B004I2XWMO,"Victor Costa ""Film Student""","[2, 4]","This is an interesting collection of mostly Warner Brothers cartoons produced during World War 2 to promote morale. Imagine Daffy Duck conking Hitler on the head with a mallet! When I was growing up, I would watch Warner Brothers cartoons every day, and I never saw any of these except for the one with Bugs Bunny and the gremlin. I suppose they no longer show these cartoons because they've become dated, but they are still great. Many of the collection contains Pvt. Snafu cartoons. Pvt. Snafu, who sounds exactly like Bugs Bunny (Mel Blanc, of course), I imagine was shown to enlisted men on what NOT to do. Snafu manages to bungle everything up, because he doesn't listen to army rules. For instance, in -Gas-, he forgets to bring his gas mask, which becomes a huge mistake when a cloud of anthropomorphic enemy gas encircles him. In another cartoon, Snafu goes on leave, has a few drinks, and starts blabbing secrets about troop movements much to the delight of nearby Axis spies. Then there's Porky Pig hunting for a ""Nutzy/Nazi"" spy, very cute. It's all done in classic Warner Brothers animation style with the wonderful Mel Blanc doing the voices as always. The only non-Warner short on this collection is a stop motion piece called -Bury The Axis- which is aslo pretty funny.",5,I never saw most of these before!,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1284,"['interesting', 'collection', 'mostly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'produced', 'World', 'War', '2', 'promote', 'morale', 'Imagine', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'conking', 'Hitler', 'head', 'mallet', 'When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'would', 'watch', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'day', 'never', 'saw', 'one', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'gremlin', 'suppose', 'no', 'longer', 'show', 'cartoons', ""'ve"", 'become', 'dated', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'Many', 'collection', 'Pvt', 'Snafu', 'cartoons', 'Pvt', 'Snafu', 'who', 'exactly', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Mel', 'Blanc', 'course', 'imagine', 'was', 'shown', 'enlisted', 'men', 'what', 'NOT', 'do', 'Snafu', 'manages', 'bungle', 'everything', 'up', ""n't"", 'listen', 'army', 'rules', 'instance', '-Gas-', 'bring', 'gas', 'mask', 'huge', 'mistake', 'when', 'cloud', 'anthropomorphic', 'enemy', 'gas', 'cartoon', 'Snafu', 'leave', 'few', 'drinks', 'blabbing', 'secrets', 'troop', 'movements', 'much', 'delight', 'nearby', 'Axis', 'spies', 'Then', 'Porky', 'Pig', 'hunting', 'Nutzy/Nazi', 'spy', 'very', 'cute', 'done', 'classic', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'animation', 'style', 'wonderful', 'Mel', 'Blanc', 'doing', 'voices', 'always', 'only', 'non-Warner', 'short', 'collection', 'stop', 'motion', 'piece', 'called', 'Axis-', 'aslo', 'pretty', 'funny']","War Cartoons - Classic WW2 Cartoons With Private Snafu , Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig , and More!"
