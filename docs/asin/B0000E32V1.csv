781046,A34BWWUJLVL2GI,B0000E32V1,Audioampbuilder,"[2, 2]","It's too bad movies like this fly under the Oscar radar. It is advised for aspiring writers to write about what they know. It would not be right for, say, a-save-your- -confederate-money-boys type to write/direct a movie about decaying urban hip hop types. We do have such movies, and they make a lot of money, too.Many of us who collect movies, zero in on the stars that consistently produce bona fide literary pieces, like this one ~ coupled with superlative cinematographic artistry-and excellent sound track, I must add. Brilliant choice: to include John Prine in this movie. He is a master  at striking chords with a broad spectrum of 'real people'. John actually not only has written a hit  one can still hear played on one's ""Local Raydio"" ( still in 2011 ). John said in his fabulous DVD with Iris DeMent, that the song he wrote for Billy's movie is ""loosely based"" on the characters....wellllll! ( smile ) John captured the gist of this movie triumphantly.It is said that True Art is that which accurately reflects its era. ""Daddy and Them"" is a sterling masterpiece of this genre. This dysfunctional family, replete with room temerature I.Q's, manages to be both laughable and poignant at the same time. We see the boys take their ""list"" to the liquor store, where they stock up with some five carboard boxes full of liquor bottles. Yet drunkeness is not really portrayed, or that is, our faces rubbed in it~ except for the 'accident scene', which will stick with you forever also. The story remains focused on the stunning, magnificently endearing performance of Billy playing ""Claude"", and Laura Dern playing his wife, Ruby. They are both insanely jealous of each other's ""lovers of the past"", and this dynamic repeatedly explodes in a kind of comical roller coaster ride ~ interspersed with  a mighty powerful tug at your heart, and moistening of your eyes,  whorl-pool tenderness in the form of this interminable, unbridled passion they have for one another.John Prine sings it accurately, ( she ) ""He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays, once I caught him.. sniffin' my undies""..and...( he ) ""She thinks all my jokes are corny, convict movies make her all horny"". You get the picture , in this magical 'picture show'.I have to compliment the casting as flawless. There is a vivid character,Tommy, played by Walton Goggins. ( appeared in Robert Duvall's masterpiece, ""The Apostle"" ) In this movie he plays a hyperactive, high functioning developmentally challenged pip squeak who charges Jim Varney with ""attempted murder"". Jim Varney we recall, played the annoying ""Earnest"" , and sadly has passed away - movie dedicated to him. Jim plays a totally different character, playing the jailbird type wonderfully. Jim Varney, playing Uncle Hazel, is ""legally defended"" by the winners of the mismatched couple of the decade (...by  who IS that?...Jamie Lee Curtis ! and Ben Affleck! )...which ought to cause anyone charged with a serious  crime, defended by these attorneys, to break out in a cold sweat.And who will ever forget Andy Griffith's portrayal of ""Daddy""? There is a scene with a fellow ~ beautifully cast, as so typical of a sweet southern boy, whose wife had shot him and left him in a wheel chair. His name is James Michael Andrew. James' conversation with Andy Griffith outside the courtroom will stick with you forever, just as Walton Goggins' acting job will.It seems the 'little vignettes', like these are so critical to a successful movie. Another critical role is played by Brenda Blethyn, the 'foreigner from England' who adds no small amusement as the 'psychologist who married our jailbird', Jim Varney. It is she who takes it upon herself to point out that no one in the family actually makes a statement, and gets a relevant reply. They all just talk past each other. John Prine plays a pivotal role that just might keep this family from flying apart at the seams..""In Spite of Their-selves""....MAYBE . That's all I can say.I trust I whetted your appetite.This is definitely one for your permanent collection. I will never part with this one, just as I wouldn't part with Billy Bob in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Another of Billy's masterpieces totally overlooked by the gliteratti of Hollywood.",5,"For Billy Bob,Laura Dern, and John Prine fans",1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,4231,"['too', 'bad', 'movies', 'fly', 'Oscar', 'radar', 'advised', 'aspiring', 'writers', 'write', 'what', 'know', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'say', 'a-save-your-', '-confederate-money-boys', 'type', 'write/direct', 'movie', 'decaying', 'urban', 'hip', 'hop', 'types', 'do', 'have', 'such', 'movies', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'too.Many', 'who', 'collect', 'movies', 'zero', 'stars', 'consistently', 'produce', 'bona', 'fide', 'literary', 'pieces', 'one', '~', 'coupled', 'superlative', 'cinematographic', 'artistry-and', 'excellent', 'sound', 'track', 'must', 'add', 'Brilliant', 'choice', 'include', 'John', 'Prine', 'movie', 'master', 'striking', 'chords', 'broad', 'spectrum', ""'real"", 'people', 'John', 'actually', 'not', 'only', 'written', 'hit', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'played', 'one', 'Local', 'Raydio', 'still', '2011', 'John', 'said', 'fabulous', 'DVD', 'Iris', 'DeMent', 'song', 'wrote', 'Billy', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'characters', '.wellllll', 'smile', 'John', 'captured', 'gist', 'movie', 'triumphantly.It', 'said', 'True', 'Art', 'accurately', 'era', 'Daddy', 'Them', 'sterling', 'masterpiece', 'genre', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'replete', 'room', 'temerature', 'I.Q', 'be', 'laughable', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'boys', 'take', 'list', 'liquor', 'store', 'where', 'stock', 'up', 'five', 'carboard', 'boxes', 'full', 'liquor', 'bottles', 'drunkeness', 'not', 'really', 'portrayed', 'rubbed', 'it~', ""'accident"", 'scene', 'will', 'stick', 'forever', 'also', 'story', 'focused', 'stunning', 'magnificently', 'endearing', 'performance', 'Billy', 'playing', 'Claude', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'playing', 'wife', 'Ruby', 'are', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'other', 'lovers', 'past', 'dynamic', 'repeatedly', 'kind', 'comical', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', '~', 'interspersed', 'mighty', 'powerful', 'tug', 'heart', 'moistening', 'eyes', 'whorl-pool', 'tenderness', 'form', 'interminable', 'unbridled', 'passion', 'have', 'one', 'another.John', 'Prine', 'accurately', 'ai', ""n't"", 'been', 'laid', 'month', 'Sundays', 'once', 'caught', 'him..', 'sniffin', 'undies', '..and', 'jokes', 'are', 'corny', 'convict', 'movies', 'make', 'horny', 'get', 'picture', 'magical', ""'picture"", ""show'.I"", 'have', 'compliment', 'casting', 'flawless', 'vivid', 'character', 'Tommy', 'played', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'appeared', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'masterpiece', 'Apostle', 'movie', 'hyperactive', 'high', 'functioning', 'developmentally', 'challenged', 'pip', 'squeak', 'who', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'attempted', 'murder', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'recall', 'played', 'annoying', 'Earnest', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'movie', 'dedicated', 'Jim', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'playing', 'jailbird', 'type', 'wonderfully', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'playing', 'Uncle', 'Hazel', 'legally', 'defended', 'winners', 'mismatched', 'couple', 'decade', 'who', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'ought', 'cause', 'anyone', 'charged', 'serious', 'crime', 'defended', 'attorneys', 'break', 'out', 'cold', 'sweat.And', 'who', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'portrayal', 'Daddy', 'scene', 'fellow', '~', 'beautifully', 'cast', 'so', 'typical', 'sweet', 'southern', 'boy', 'wife', 'had', 'shot', 'left', 'wheel', 'chair', 'name', 'James', 'Michael', 'Andrew', 'James', 'conversation', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'courtroom', 'will', 'stick', 'forever', 'just', 'Walton', 'Goggins', 'acting', 'job', 'will.It', ""'little"", 'vignettes', 'are', 'so', 'critical', 'successful', 'movie', 'critical', 'role', 'played', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', ""'foreigner"", 'England', 'who', 'small', 'amusement', ""'psychologist"", 'who', 'married', 'jailbird', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'who', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'family', 'actually', 'statement', 'relevant', 'reply', 'just', 'talk', 'other', 'John', 'Prine', 'pivotal', 'role', 'just', 'might', 'keep', 'family', 'flying', 'apart', 'seams..', 'Spite', 'Their-selves', '.MAYBE', 'can', 'say.I', 'trust', 'whetted', 'appetite.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'permanent', 'collection', 'will', 'never', 'part', 'one', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'part', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Billy', 'masterpieces', 'totally', 'overlooked', 'gliteratti', 'Hollywood']",N/A

Ironically, its all TRUE! I cant stop laughing, hell I even have a pair of identical cowboy boots to the ones Billy Bob was hanging off'n that car hood. haw haw hawAlmost perfectly cast, although they were near almost done in by a pick-up dropped Molly Hatchet tape.

OK, so maybe if you're not from the South you wont get it, but I do by God and its hilarious. I cant believe this thing went straight to cable, its a real hidden gem.

My only disappointment with this flick is John Prine who can write songs and sing with the best of them, but he has got to be the worst actor I have ever seen. Nice try boys, almost anybody off the streets of Little Rock would have been better as Billy Bob's brother. Oh well, that didn't ruin an otherwise stinging comic portrayal of White-Trash-O-Rama Arkansas style.Too bad Jim Varney had to go out on Showtime, maybe it was this film's transition into a sentimental love story that finally did him in and personally I could have done without that introspection, however.....

After all he wrote the screenplay.  There is a shot of him in cut-off jeans with no shirt and a little further into the movie he wakes up with a shirt on, but with his bluejeans (full-length jeans) down to the top of his, what else?, cowboy boots, and later still we get to visit him in the bathroom where he is wearing a shirt, and well....a magazine.  Those are the highlights of his wardrobe as I recall them, keeping in mind a lot of discussions with Laura Dern (wife Ruby in the film) took place before going to sleep..don't know what he wearing below the chest, but mostly he didn't sleep with his shirt on.But enough about Billy Bob's wardrobe, down to the film now; be prepared to laugh when you get to see 'Daddy & Them"". Especially if you happen to be from the south.  You are going to feel right at home among the Montgomery family.The script is cute and touching and it made me laugh out loud lots of times... I haven't done that in a movie for a long time.  Being a southern girl by birth, I could readily relate to the communication problems this family was facing.I like the way Thornton thinks, writes, and acts.  He's a keeper for his talent, no doubt about it.This is the story of a dysfunctional southern family with a lot of personal history.Claude Montgomery (Billy Bob) now married to Ruby (Laura Dern - Billy Bob's ex-girlfriend), once dated her sister Rose (Kelly Preston - Mrs. John Travolta).  Claude and Ruby, accompanied by sister Rose and Claude's mother-in-law, Jewel (Diana Ladd) go home to help out Claude's bother, Alvin (John Prine) and the family patriarch, O.T. (Andy Griffith) when O.T.'s brother Hazel (the late Jim Varney) gets arrested. O.T. unfortunately suffers from attacks of dementia and has a difficult time recalling exactly which sister Claude married.  Ben Affleck and Jamie Lee Curtis appear as married lawyers hired by the Montgomery family.All this sudden southern togetherness erupts in confusion, discussion, memories, and changes.There is an accident scene that is very, very funny.  Good ole boy Claude, as portrayed by Billy Bob, is really a romantic guy at heart.  The  dual-dueling-jealous competitions between Claude and Ruby are priceless.I wished the font on the credits has been easier to read.  Still the credits are well worth watching in order to hear the John Prine song, ""In Spite of Ourselves"" being sung over the credits.

The crisis is enough to bring home O T's 3 sons and 1 daughter and their spouses, where they all share 1 cramped house.

The soundtrack has mostly appropriate songs and instrumentals (Chet Atkins' guitar is so melodic that my ears tuned out the dialog as his instrument sang) popping up at the right moments. But Thornton's adherence to reality (he grew up in a very small town setting in Arkansas) when profiling this fictional family has even the usually easy going casted Griffith spouting profanity so it's not for children.",4,welcome to the family,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,1322,"['watching', 'first', 'runs', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', '1960s', 'reruns', 'decade', 'sometimes', 'wondered', 'what', 'Andy', 'iconic', 'television', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'years', 'later', 'Sheriff', 'Andy', 'had', 'remarried', 'had', 'more', 'kids', 'Daddy', 'Them', 'nightmarish', 'version.Griffith', 'O', 'T', 'patriarch', 'family', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'one', 'produced', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'Goober', 'Mayberry', 'younger', 'brother', 'played', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Hey', 'Vern', 'fame', 'been', 'arrested', 'charged', 'attempted', 'murder', 'crisis', 'enough', 'bring', 'home', 'O', 'T', '3', 'sons', '1', 'daughter', 'spouses', 'where', 'share', '1', 'cramped', 'house', 'Repressed', 'problems', 'simmer', 'surface', 'impassioned', 'plea', 'everyone', 'learn', 'honestly', 'respond', 'then', 'respond', 'response', 'unheeded.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'wrote', 'directed', 'drama/comedy', 'starred', 'son', 'most', 'affected', 'hullaballoo', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'appropriate', 'songs', 'instrumentals', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'guitar', 'so', 'melodic', 'ears', 'tuned', 'out', 'dialog', 'instrument', 'sang', 'popping', 'up', 'right', 'moments', 'Thornton', 'adherence', 'reality', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'Arkansas', 'when', 'profiling', 'fictional', 'family', 'even', 'usually', 'easy', 'going', 'casted', 'Griffith', 'spouting', 'profanity', 'not', 'children']",N/A

Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[5, 7]","Its a little known Billy Bob Thornton film, put out by the Weinsteins,I assume, in their days at Miramax before Disney dumped them out of thecompany. I've never heard of it. It must've went straight to video.Billy Bob wrote and directed Daddy and them. It seems a littleautobiographical.I'm just a little way into the movie. Laura Dern and her husband BillyBob are down and out and living in a little house with no money.Billy Bob is 52 but he's playin' a guy about thirty. Laura's nearing 40in reality, but she's playing someone who is a post-teen.It opens with Billy Bob wearing a hat backward and chasing Laura aroundthe yard. But its primitiveness is what makes this movie worth talkingabout.Their dialog is so remorselessly hillbilly that I have to share. Lauracomplains that Billy Bob's tattoos aren't tattoos at all but cover upsof the names of former loves he's had that he don't want Laura to seeanymore. He replies that he wouldn't have bothered coverin' em up ifshe hadn't bitched so much about them.Which leads her to complain that he shouldn'ta f****d her sister likethat, it makes bein' married to him extra hard. To which Billy Bobreplies, ""Sure I f****d your sister, but what was I supposed to do? Youwas only 13 at the time and if I'da f***d you, theyda put me in thehoosegow.""It goes on like that. I suspect the Weinstein Brothers sent this onestraight to video cause it was too embarrassing to release. I'd callthis an unintentional comedy, only I don't think it is. Billy Bobintended for this to appear to be an unintentional comedy.Billy Bob doesn't like her folks, including Diane Ladd, Laura'sreal-life actress mother and Bruce Dern's ex-wife. The movie is onelong dysfunctional family feud. Billy Bob emphasizes family and itsdiscontents.

I find Billy Bob Thornton brilliant when he plays nut-cases who, we eventually discover, have good hearts; a fine example is his role in ""Bad Santa."" There's a truth and a reality he achieves that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time.Just about everyone in this film is off his/her rocker, country stupid, intolerable, and so like a few people I encountered while growing up in Dayton, Ohio; this group (mainly one family) just talks dirtier than the people I ran into there. The characters here are exaggerations of the seemingly self-destructive and self-hating people love to embarrass each other, fight, drink and scream a lot. They are so obnoxious and messed-up that they are loveable ... from a distance. Yet deep down they are family and actually care about each other.The language is filthy and the topics of discussion (accusations, admissions, etc.) are often very low-down and gritty, so this isn't a film for kids. It reminds me of why I left Southwestern Ohio once I graduated high school and headed for California where the people were very different, at least on the surface. It's nostalgic for me to see the stereotypes I was so happy to leave behind and, in this case, funny as hell.I highly recommend this film! Everyone from Andy Griffith to ""Ernest"" is in this film, as well as Billy Bob, Laura Dern, Jaimie Lee Curtis, Ben Afleck and other beloved character actors. It reminds me of the great screwball comedies of the 1930s and '40s updated to an ""R"" rating for adult content (not a lot of nudity or violence, just classless sex talk and ridiculously funny situations).",5,"""Down Home"" Real, as Only Billy Bob Thornton Can Express It",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,1660,"['just', 'discovered', 'gem', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'find', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'brilliant', 'when', 'nut-cases', 'who', 'eventually', 'discover', 'have', 'good', 'hearts', 'fine', 'example', 'role', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'truth', 'reality', 'hilarious', 'tragic', 'same', 'time.Just', 'everyone', 'film', 'his/her', 'rocker', 'country', 'stupid', 'intolerable', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'encountered', 'growing', 'up', 'Dayton', 'Ohio', 'group', 'mainly', 'one', 'family', 'just', 'talks', 'dirtier', 'people', 'ran', 'there', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'exaggerations', 'seemingly', 'self-destructive', 'self-hating', 'people', 'love', 'embarrass', 'other', 'fight', 'drink', 'scream', 'lot', 'are', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'messed-up', 'are', 'loveable', 'distance', 'deep', 'are', 'family', 'actually', 'care', 'other.The', 'language', 'filthy', 'topics', 'discussion', 'accusations', 'admissions', 'etc', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'low-down', 'gritty', ""n't"", 'film', 'kids', 'why', 'left', 'Southwestern', 'Ohio', 'once', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'headed', 'California', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'least', 'surface', 'nostalgic', 'see', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'leave', 'behind', 'case', 'funny', 'hell.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Everyone', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Ernest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Jaimie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Ben', 'Afleck', 'other', 'beloved', 'character', 'actors', 'great', 'screwball', 'comedies', '1930s', 'updated', 'R', 'rating', 'adult', 'content', 'not', 'lot', 'nudity', 'violence', 'just', 'classless', 'sex', 'talk', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'situations']",N/A
