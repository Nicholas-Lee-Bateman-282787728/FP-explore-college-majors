Directed by Weir after his 80s masterpieces (Witness, gallipoli, the Year of living dangerously, Dead poets society, Green Card) and before great stuff like Master and Commander, Truman Show).Maybe that's why this film was not so well received, or at least not as well as it deserved, and it was so unjustly forgotten over the years.Fearless is, on the contrary, a typical Peter Weir's film, dealing with death,the unknown, the mysterious links between people as well as the gaps that sometimes we try to fill by reaching out to who we meet in our life.It contains some amazing scenes (the air crash, but also some little precious moments when characters reveal themselves, their weakness, thei thirst for life and conscoiusness).

That being said, it would have been nice, but I am not missing extra features that are not included. English subtitles, 2.0 DTS-HD audio, and a trailer, that is all (and unlike dvd, blu IS widescreen, 1.85:1). To see how lovely this blu is, watch the SD trailer first. The skyline during the church visit, for example, is flawless in blu. This was not filmed digitally (I don't believe, for 1992), so it has a nice filmic quality, but wow! does it shine.

Many people do not know this film (or think it's the Jet Li film of the same name), because this film played in theaters for such a short time back in 1985. Most people who saw it in that small window said it was &#34;life-changing&#34; for them and that they never forgot it. I agree, and for years have been waiting for a good version of this unique film to be available. I went to a lecture by its cinematographer, Alan Daviau, at which he showed his 35mm copy of the film and said he had just supervised a new transfer for Warner Brothers. After years, the new transfer never materialized.Now it has -- but only on blu-ray as far as I know. The blu-ray really does the film (and Daviau's cinematography, as well as Maurice Jarre's haunting score) justice. I am SO glad. It was the second blu-ray I bought, after getting my player a few months ago.If you aren't familiar with the film, I URGE you to see it, even though it's very disturbing. It is essentially NOT violent, but it IS emotionally wrenching. It features performances by Jeff Bridges and Isabella Rosselini, as well as the most incredible performance Rosie Perez has ever given. It's a story you've never seen before with all kind of reverberations, including, in a way, metaphysical ones. The film will leave you stunned, but I think very glad you saw it for the performances, the unique story line, and whatever you take from the film in terms of its meaning for you.I'll say no more about it. You can see the basic storyline on IMDB or elsewhere, but I suggest you don't learn too much about the film before you see it. Try to see it when you have a little time afterwards to &#34;process&#34; it -- i.e. don't have to run off to a party or social event, but can just be quiet with whomever you watched the film with.The blu-ray (released under the Warner Brothers &#34;Archive Collection&#34; imprint), is still no-frills. There are no extra features at all. There was no remix of the soundtrack into 5.1 or 7.1 or anything like that. It is DTS-HD stereo and beautifully rendered. Visually, the transfer is excellent. Given how important this film is and how long I've been waiting, while I would have liked some extras, I'm just happy to have the film in pristine form.Seriously -- you may think &#34;why should I want to watch a film that is wrenching?&#34; Watch it. And don't confuse it with the other films with the same title.",5,Finally - A Transfer Worthy of this Great Film!,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,2765,"['FEARLESS', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'Peter', 'Weir', '34', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', '34', '34', 'Truman', 'Show', '34', '34', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', '34', '34', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'novelist/screenwriter', 'Rafael', 'Yglesias', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'analogue', 'transfer', 'DVD', '2003', 'panned', 'scanned', '4:3', 'instead', 'correct', '16:9', 'Many', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'think', 'Jet', 'Li', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'played', 'theaters', 'short', 'time', 'back', '1985', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'small', 'window', 'said', 'was', '34', 'life-changing', '34', 'never', 'forgot', 'agree', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'good', 'version', 'unique', 'film', 'be', 'available', 'went', 'lecture', 'cinematographer', 'Alan', 'Daviau', 'showed', '35mm', 'copy', 'film', 'said', 'had', 'just', 'supervised', 'new', 'transfer', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'years', 'new', 'transfer', 'never', 'materialized.Now', 'only', 'blu-ray', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'blu-ray', 'really', 'film', 'Daviau', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'haunting', 'score', 'justice', 'am', 'SO', 'glad', 'was', 'second', 'blu-ray', 'bought', 'getting', 'player', 'few', 'months', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'film', 'URGE', 'see', 'even', 'very', 'disturbing', 'essentially', 'NOT', 'violent', 'IS', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Isabella', 'Rosselini', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'ever', 'given', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'kind', 'reverberations', 'including', 'way', 'metaphysical', 'ones', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'stunned', 'think', 'very', 'glad', 'saw', 'performances', 'unique', 'story', 'line', 'take', 'film', 'terms', 'meaning', 'you.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'can', 'see', 'basic', 'storyline', 'IMDB', 'elsewhere', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'see', 'Try', 'see', 'when', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'afterwards', '34', 'process', '34', 'i.e', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'run', 'off', 'party', 'social', 'event', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'quiet', 'whomever', 'watched', 'film', 'with.The', 'blu-ray', 'released', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '34', 'Archive', 'Collection', '34', 'imprint', 'still', 'no-frills', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'remix', 'soundtrack', '5.1', '7.1', 'anything', 'DTS-HD', 'stereo', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'Visually', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'Given', 'how', 'important', 'film', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'extras', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'have', 'film', 'pristine', 'form.Seriously', 'may', 'think', '34', 'why', 'should', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'wrenching', '34', 'Watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'title']",N/A

He tries to help a fellow survivor, played by Rosie Perez, and the two help each other back.

1671528,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00FFFUYCO,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[1, 1]","Watching 'Fearless' on Blu-ray is like seeing it again for the first time.Sadly, I never got to see 'Fearless' in the theatre. My first viewing was on a rented VHS cassette, and for a long time I owned a poor-quality DVD of the film. Still, it was a movie I was compelled to watch now and again, a longtime favorite that never fails to move me. Watching it this time, in widescreen and with much of its original quality restored, made it a whole new experience.'Fearless' opens with a dishevelled man, as he steps between rows of corn in a cornfield. In one arm he holds a baby, a young boy is holding his other hand. As he emerges from the corn onto an asphalt road, the camera pulls back to reveal the field behind him... the smoking wreckage and human debris of a commercial airplane which has just crashed.With this memorable beginning, 'Fearless' quickly establishes a tone of simple beauty, honesty, and pathos in the face of disaster and tragedy, a tone which is maintained through every single scene. Though the plot of the film is important, this is a movie about people more than about events. The characters are what carry 'Fearless' to the end, and the changes they go through as the story progresses are what it's all about.The main character is the man we first saw in the cornfield: Max Klein. Simply put, his world is turned upside down by the plane crash. Though he survived the crash (and in fact saved the lives of several others), he cannot accept the idea that he is still alive. He begins to experience his life as if he were an outsider to it. Something in him is changed, perhaps irrevocably so, and his journey is the main story of the film.Max is played flawlessly by Jeff Bridges, in perhaps the finest and most nuanced role of his career. The other actors in the film also turn in excellent performances, from Isabella Rosselini as Max's wife struggling to love the new Max as she did the old one, Rosie Perez as another crash survivor who lost her child in the crash, John Turturro as a psychologist who tries to help Max, and all-too brief appearances by Tom Hulce as a delightfully self-deprecating lawyer representing the crash victims. The acting in 'Fearless' is the kind where you can easily forget that it's acting, and just allow the performances to live and breathe on their own..Peter Weir's direction, always of high-quality, is honed to fine effect for 'Fearless.' As always, Weir uses powerful imagery to carry the story, but he walks the fine line of never allowing the images to overpower the story. Not a single image is there for its own sake, each shot helps to move the audience towards the conclusion. Weir's careful hand is evident throughout the film, but never moreso than in a stunningly moving plane crash sequence, in which the images have both metaphorical and literal meaning. The imagery of 'Fearless' is subtle, meaningful, and in the end, unforgettable.The music chosen for 'Fearless' could not have been better. Maurice Jarre's usual soft touch, an excellent match for Weir's visual style, is used here perfectly. As for the other music... from the Gypsy Kings' joyous &#34;Sin Ella&#34; to U2's striving &#34;Where the Streets Have No Name&#34; to Henryk Gorecki's rich and moving &#34;Symphony No. 3,&#34; each piece is chosen for its effect, how it fits both imagery and story. The film's climax, set to the Gorecki piece, is a pitch-perfect blend of music and imagery and story, so much so that it's now nearly impossible to imagine one without the other.The blu-ray presentation, in widescreen format and with clear, sharp HD images, is a dramatic improvement over the muddy picture and fullscreen &#34;pan & scan&#34; DVD I used to have.  There are no special features to speak of, other than the film's original trailer, but it doesn't need them. As fine a fine film as 'Fearless' deserves to be presented as it was intended to be seen - or as close as we can get it outside of a theatre - and at last we have it.'Fearless' has remained one of my favorites ever since I first saw it. For its lyrical beauty, its unique, well-drawn characters, and for the way it brings me to breathless tears every time I watch it, there's simply no other film quite like it.",5,Peerless,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,4226,"['Watching', 'Blu-ray', 'seeing', 'again', 'first', 'time.Sadly', 'never', 'got', 'see', ""'Fearless"", 'theatre', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'rented', 'VHS', 'cassette', 'long', 'time', 'owned', 'poor-quality', 'DVD', 'film', 'Still', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'compelled', 'watch', 'now', 'again', 'longtime', 'favorite', 'never', 'move', 'Watching', 'time', 'widescreen', 'much', 'original', 'quality', 'restored', 'made', 'whole', 'new', 'experience', 'opens', 'dishevelled', 'man', 'rows', 'corn', 'cornfield', 'one', 'arm', 'baby', 'young', 'boy', 'holding', 'other', 'hand', 'corn', 'asphalt', 'road', 'camera', 'back', 'reveal', 'field', 'smoking', 'wreckage', 'human', 'debris', 'commercial', 'airplane', 'just', 'crashed.With', 'memorable', 'beginning', 'quickly', 'tone', 'simple', 'beauty', 'honesty', 'pathos', 'face', 'disaster', 'tragedy', 'tone', 'maintained', 'single', 'scene', 'plot', 'film', 'important', 'movie', 'people', 'more', 'events', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'carry', ""'Fearless"", 'end', 'changes', 'go', 'story', 'progresses', 'are', 'what', 'about.The', 'main', 'character', 'man', 'first', 'saw', 'cornfield', 'Max', 'Klein', 'Simply', 'put', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'plane', 'crash', 'survived', 'crash', 'fact', 'saved', 'lives', 'several', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'idea', 'still', 'alive', 'experience', 'life', 'were', 'outsider', 'Something', 'changed', 'perhaps', 'irrevocably', 'so', 'journey', 'main', 'story', 'film.Max', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'most', 'nuanced', 'role', 'career', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'also', 'turn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Isabella', 'Rosselini', 'Max', 'wife', 'struggling', 'love', 'new', 'Max', 'did', 'old', 'one', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'crash', 'survivor', 'who', 'lost', 'child', 'crash', 'John', 'Turturro', 'psychologist', 'who', 'help', 'Max', 'all-too', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'delightfully', 'self-deprecating', 'lawyer', 'representing', 'crash', 'victims', 'acting', ""'Fearless"", 'kind', 'where', 'can', 'easily', 'forget', 'acting', 'just', 'allow', 'performances', 'live', 'breathe', 'own..Peter', 'Weir', 'direction', 'always', 'high-quality', 'honed', 'fine', 'effect', ""'Fearless"", 'always', 'Weir', 'powerful', 'imagery', 'carry', 'story', 'fine', 'line', 'never', 'allowing', 'images', 'overpower', 'story', 'Not', 'single', 'image', 'there', 'own', 'sake', 'shot', 'move', 'audience', 'conclusion', 'Weir', 'careful', 'hand', 'evident', 'film', 'never', 'moreso', 'stunningly', 'moving', 'plane', 'crash', 'sequence', 'images', 'have', 'metaphorical', 'literal', 'meaning', 'imagery', ""'Fearless"", 'subtle', 'meaningful', 'end', 'unforgettable.The', 'music', 'chosen', ""'Fearless"", 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'usual', 'soft', 'touch', 'excellent', 'match', 'Weir', 'visual', 'style', 'used', 'here', 'perfectly', 'other', 'music', 'Gypsy', 'Kings', 'joyous', '34', 'Sin', 'Ella', '34', 'U2', 'striving', '34', 'Where', 'Streets', 'Have', 'No', 'Name', '34', 'Henryk', 'Gorecki', 'rich', 'moving', '34', 'Symphony', 'No', '3', '34', 'piece', 'chosen', 'effect', 'how', 'imagery', 'story', 'film', 'climax', 'set', 'Gorecki', 'piece', 'pitch-perfect', 'blend', 'music', 'imagery', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'now', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'one', 'other.The', 'blu-ray', 'presentation', 'widescreen', 'format', 'clear', 'sharp', 'HD', 'images', 'dramatic', 'improvement', 'muddy', 'picture', 'fullscreen', '34', 'pan', 'scan', '34', 'DVD', 'used', 'have', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'other', 'film', 'original', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'need', 'fine', 'fine', 'film', ""'Fearless"", 'deserves', 'be', 'presented', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'theatre', 'last', 'have', 'remained', 'one', 'favorites', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'lyrical', 'beauty', 'unique', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'way', 'breathless', 'tears', 'time', 'watch', 'simply', 'other', 'film', 'quite']",N/A
