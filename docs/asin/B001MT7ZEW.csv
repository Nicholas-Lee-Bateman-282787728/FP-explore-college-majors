So I downloaded the songs. Then I found out it was a movie,which of course was horror my favorites so naturally I bought it. I watched with a few of my friends, We of course all enjoyed it. It's exciting, original and unpredictable. I have never seen anything like it. Paris Hilton and Sarah Brightman give great performances as Amber Sweet and Blind Mag. The Graverobber is awesome too. I have been trying to get the 2 disc soundtrack but no luck yet. Sometime soon I hope there will be a sequel to this. Repo Men is NOT a sequel, it simply rips off this movie, most of the fans of this movie know that. I hope Lions Gate sues them for it.  But anyway Repo! The Genetic Opera is not to be missed.

1217328,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B001MT7ZEW,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[65, 76]","This movie is amazing!  The scenes are very creepy and unsettling, but at the same time very appealing and artistically beautiful.  Even if you hated the music or plot, which I didn't this movie alone for the scenery is worth a buy.Now about the music.  At first I was uncertain of how to feel regarding their musical numbers, and by the third song I was hooked.  The lyrics in this are comedic at times, other times serious, and actually nearing the end there is a song that I think is pleasant, ""I Didn't Think I'd Love You This Much,"" is the name of the song I believe.  The vocals of lead Alexa Vega are great, strong, and defined.  Even Paris Hilton surprised me as this is the first time I have heard her vocals, and it reminded me some some old school goth rock cd I'd listen to in high school.  Finally, Sarah Brightman.  What can I say about Sarah that anyone doesn't already know?  Musical Wise, she was nothing short of spectacular.Acting wise, I'm a big junkie for Bill Mosley and it was fun to see him pull off the comedic cult character he portrayed.  Paris, actually did great acting, it surprised me how great Alex Vega did considering I had never seen her attempt anything like this, and I was surprised that Sarah Brightman could be as dark as she was in this movie.  The casting meshed well and it was fun to see such big names in a movie that hadn't hit theaters in my area.Art wise, the scenes were mind-blowing.  There are scenes where there is much cgi used, but overall it looks good, and that's saying a lot for me considering I hate cgi.  Also, the make up was great with good effects, example, if the box hadn't said Paris was in this I doubt I would have recognized her until the end.Overall, I rarely say this.... But I wish I could give this a higher rating then a 5 star.  I will be buying the soundtrack as soon as I complete this review.  Repo! Will be played a second time tonight for my posse...

1217330,A28RPKXOVO41AW,B001MT7ZEW,Alyson C. Miller,"[2, 4]","I was really looking forward to this when it arrived from Netflix, and maybe that was part of the problem.  I had my hopes set too high.  I had just seen Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, and was looking for other kooky musicals to fall in love with, so when Repo! appeared in my mailbox, I was psyched.  It disappointed from the start, though I did try to give it the benefit of the doubt that it would pick up and be a bit more well written later in the movie.  It wasn't.  There were a couple of legitimately good songs in the movie, but for the most part I felt like i was watching something that was written as a standard movie, and then it was decided about halfway through production to turn it into a musical.  Most of the songs did not feel at all like songs--more like they were just pages of script that someone set to music without any edits.  The voices were all wonderful (well, the main character voices anyway).  Paris Hilton wasn't anywhere near as annoying as I expected her to be.  Anthony Stewart Head almost managed to salvage every one of his songs, though for most of the numbers he just couldn't pull off the impossible.  Anyway, I guess it was just a very thorough letdown.  The songs were very disappointing, and I felt like more money was spent on fake blood than on writing.All that being said, the main actors were all wonderful and tried their darnedest to save the movie from its own writing.",2,I was REALLY disappointed,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,1421,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'when', 'arrived', 'Netflix', 'maybe', 'was', 'part', 'problem', 'had', 'hopes', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Horrible', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Blog', 'was', 'looking', 'other', 'kooky', 'musicals', 'fall', 'love', 'so', 'when', 'Repo', 'appeared', 'mailbox', 'was', 'psyched', 'disappointed', 'start', 'did', 'try', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'well', 'written', 'later', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'were', 'couple', 'legitimately', 'good', 'songs', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'was', 'written', 'standard', 'movie', 'then', 'was', 'decided', 'halfway', 'production', 'turn', 'musical', 'Most', 'songs', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'like', 'songs', 'more', 'were', 'just', 'pages', 'script', 'someone', 'set', 'music', 'edits', 'voices', 'were', 'wonderful', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'voices', 'anyway', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'as', 'annoying', 'expected', 'be', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'almost', 'managed', 'salvage', 'one', 'songs', 'most', 'numbers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'impossible', 'Anyway', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'thorough', 'letdown', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'disappointing', 'felt', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'fake', 'blood', 'writing.All', 'being', 'said', 'main', 'actors', 'were', 'wonderful', 'tried', 'darnedest', 'save', 'movie', 'own', 'writing']",Repo The Genetic Opera
1217331,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B001MT7ZEW,Amanda,"[0, 0]","Imagine a dystopic future where, after an epidemic of organ failures, a massive corporation known as GeneCo stepped in with the answer to people's problems. Not only could they get new organs, but they could afford them through a kind of organ financing plan (similar to making car payments or paying the mortgage). Once the epidemic past, however, GeneCo made new organs and anatomy-altering surgery a fashion statement and an accepted part of everyday life. With GeneCo's innovative system, you too can afford body parts that can cure your genetic deficiencies, injuries, enhance your natural senses and, of course, make you look better (think a kind of out-of-proportion plastic/cosmetic surgery). The only catch is that GeneCo was able to legalize organ repossession. If you aren't able to make payments on your organs, they'll send the repo man after you who will, quite literally, track you down and rip out your heart (or liver or kidney or whatever) since you couldn't pay for it. Oh, and did I mention that this is a musical? Yeah, it's an incredibly violent, dystopic, semi-satirical and somewhat messed-up rock opera stage musical turned into a movie.With a scenario like this, I was intrigued. It's weird, I know (and the film is pretty stylized and weird), but sometimes you just gotta have some weird in your life. I went into this movie (now an underground cult classic) with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. The film follows the story of seventeen year-old Shilo Wallace (Alexa Vega), who inherited a blood disease from her now-deceased mother that prevents her from leaving her room. Not only is Shilo sick of her shut-in life and overprotective father, but she longs for a cure to her disease.Meanwhile GeneCo founder and president Rotti Largo (Paul Sorvino) discovers that he has a terminal disease and is faced with having to find an heir for his empire, as well as the impending retirement of the ""Voice of GeneCo"" and star of the company's live TV program, ""The Genetic Opera,"" Blind Mag (Sarah Brightman). Rotti feels that his three children Luigi (Bill Moseley), Pavi (Nivek Orge) and Amber Sweet (Paris Hilton) are horrible disappointments (each one is messed up in some way), and doesn't want to leave the company to any of them.There are so many elements that this movie brings together fairly well. The tone is somewhat dark, but kooky and almost comic book-y, enough so that the over-the-top violence seems nearly comedic and cartoon-like. Many of the characters are also really over-the-top in order to make a point, in particular the Largo children, Luigi, Pavi and Amber Sweet. Luigi is a homicidal manic who fatally stabs anyone who so much as bumps into him or brings him cold coffee; Pavi is a womanizing pervert who hides his horribly scarred face with interchangeable faces stolen from female victims; Amber Sweet is a spoiled brat and wannabe singer who is addicted to surgery and street-grade pain killers (not much of a stretch for Paris Hilton, I might add). The music is pretty good too. While I won't be listening to the soundtrack in my spare time, the songs are enjoyable and do a good job of telling the story while relying information about characters. Virtually the entire film is sung, so if you don't like musicals, this could be difficult for you to get into.A tough one to make mainstream, Repo! will appeal to fans of off-beat films, semi-corny violence and outrageous dystopias. The film has a very niche group of fans, but for what it is, Repo! is enjoyable, compelling, and thought-provoking. The ending implies that there will be a sequel, and the director has said that the original idea was to make this a three-movie series. I'd like to see that come to life, but it's tough to tell since the movie was not made that much money to date due to its obscure nature and niche appeal.

1217332,A20MXB65JKHMNC,B001MT7ZEW,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","Repo! The Genetic Opera is one of those bizarre, indescribable experiences that most people either love or love to hate. Think Saw meets Sin City with a splash of a Greek morality play and buckets upon buckets of blood and gore... oh, and there's singing. Lots of singing.This over-the-top rock opera is set in a futuristic dystopia, where an epidemic of organ failures led to the founding of GeneCo, a company that swooped in to save the day with their organ financing programs- like a car loan. The catch, of course, is the repossession clause; should the recipient fail to make their payments, Rotti Largo, GeneCo's formidable mobster-like founder, sends one of his Repo Men to collect the organs. And these `legal assasins' are figures to be feared by everyone save for Rotti and his spoiled, miscreant children. Which brings us to the main plot: while Rotti's fearful image might be immortal, he has discovered that he is not. He's dying, and must name an heir to GeneCo and his large fortune. As he complains in song, his `children are a bust'. Luigi is a sociopath with anger management issues, whose favorite past time leaves an unsightly trail of dead bodies behind; Amber Sweet is not only addicted to surgery, but also to the cheap, street Zydrate (a powerful, and addictive, painkiller GeneCo developed) that her father outlawed; Pavi has appearance issues, apparently, and to compensate steals faces that he wears like masks.So Rotti is dying and has no suitable heir to keep his company going. His once-promising prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Nathan Wallace, lost favor when Rotti's girlfriend, Marni, fell in love with and married him. Rotti seems to have gotten his revenge, in the end, though; while pregnant, Marni fell ill with a rare blood disease and died when Nathan tried to cure her. He managed to save their daughter, Shilo, though Marni's death has turned him into every teenage girl's nightmare of an overprotective father. He will literally do anything to protect her (even if it means keeping her locked up in her bedroom). But, in order to keep from being legally blamed for his wife's death, he has struck a deal with the devil: in exchange for Rotti's help in smoothing the whole nasty incident over, he becomes a Repo Man.Fast forward seventeen years; Shilo is now seventeen, a nave songbird who spends her time collecting insects, watching her idol, Blind Mag, on television, and hanging out in her mother's tomb. She suffers from the same blood disease that she was told killed her mother, and as far as she knows, Nathan is a busy doctor. While she thinks he spends his days and nights tending to patients, he's wrestling with his dark alter ego (cudos to Anthony Head; Nathan's transformation into the Repo Man is downright chilling).They don't always see eye-to-eye, but Shilo generally respects her father's orders to stay indoors. Until one night when she chases an insect out into a graveyard and meets a Graverobber- criminals who traffic in stolen organs and street Zydrate that they extract from the dead. Rotti discovers her and decides that she will serve as his heir-provided she can pass his test. Before long, Shilo is thrust headlong into this dangerous and strange world, discovering the truth about her past, and ultimately the nature of true freedom.As the name would suggest, this is a musical; there is very little spoken dialogue, most of it is sung, but the cast carries it well (Head, Paul Sorvino and Terrance Zdunich in particular). The music alternates between full-on operatic numbers, like `Chromaggia', to Shilo's teen rebellion punk anthem, `Seventeen' (during which Joan Jett makes a random cameo), and the delightfully-demented `Thankless Job' (in which the Repo Man laments the lack of appreciation for his profession). Terrance Zdunich's Graverobber steals the show as a sort of demented Greek Chorus, at times talking (or singing) directly to the audience.The not-so-subtle commentary centers on the consequences of a society obsessed with appearance and status (as Graverobber says: ""So why care for these petty obsessions? You're designer heart still beats with common blood... and what if you could have genetic perfection?

In fact, people come to me looking for recommendations or with queries as far as the cult cinema is concerned. Repo is one of the few films I've had the distinct pleasure of viewing this year which I wish I'd seen on the big screen. This is, by far, one of the greater films made in the past several years which truly deserves it's instant cult status & I'm hoping one of the theatres in my local town will do a midnight showing of this film sometime soon as simply watching the DVD is a flat-out insult to the makers.Finally, the rock opera made it's grand return sadly to limited theatres in November 2008 of only seven theatres. The film took in $3,250 per screen on its opening day.  Repo also had a limited Canadian release, playing in Toronto from November 21-27, 2008. The DVD and Blu-ray were released January 20, 2009. To coincide with the film's release, Bousman, Smith, and Zdunich, as well as various cast members, did a touring version of the film. Because of strong ticket sales, a second and third touring session were added, in addition to a British tour across four locations. A Repo! Road Show was announced on January 28 in 10 cities. This show will be similar to the Repo! Road Tour, except it will be almost completely fan-run.Set in the not so distant future 26 years after an epidemic of organ failures plagued the planet, a bio-tech company by the name of GeneCo emerged to provide organ transplants to the needy populace on a financial plan, making it affordable to anyone who needed one. Unfortunately, this seemingly wonderful finance plan is nothing at all like your standard car loan as those who miss their payments for 90 days are scheduled for repossession & hunted by villainous Repo Men. They do not call nor write if you miss your payments.Repo! The Genetic Opera was undoubtedly compared to all the infamous rock operas such as Rocky Horror Picture Show or even Sweeney Todd with good reason. There are elements of each film which will ultimately remind viewers of many cult films we loved through the years but perhaps missed out on seeing in theatres.Unlike many films being made which strain themselves for cult status, Repo seems to be content with staying true to it's dark & gritty nature with liberal doses of humor dispersed throughout.  Repo will likely strike the same nerve with it's core audience that Sweeney Todd struck with the demon barber who slits the throats of his patrons only to use their remains in  meat pies. The Genetic opera also cleverly takes a stab (no pun intended) at our worst fears concerning the health care system and gleefully manages to go all the way in the high gore department while still managing to make us gag & laugh.Repo!is definitely not for all tastes. The lovers (fans of goth/industrial or cult films) will praise the film of course & try to attend any live events whereas the critics are going to hate it with a true passion. Either way, it's definitely an experience that needs to be had although probability suggests all the 'wannabe' good movies will continue to flood your multiplexes while films like Repo! will only be granted very limited releases.

I bought REPO! to see Sarah Brightman - and her footage does not disappoint. I find Sarah charming and strange and ethereal and here she all but chews the scenery - it's a great performance from a performer who rarely (if ever) does film roles. She understood her role and the material and had a point-of-view - would that all the film could have reached that mark. Stupid, witless, poor, amateur lyrics and an even more egregious script makes this thing a monumental waste of time and a complete bore. Comparisons to ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW do a GREAT disservice to ROCKY HORROR. This cannot even be compared to SHOCK TREATMENT - which now looks like CITIZEN KANE when compared to REPO! Anthony Head wasted his time - why? - did you see his OTHERWISE ENGAGED in London? The man can captivate a theatre of 1000 individuals - hold them rapt - here he is simply slumming - and don't get me started about Paul Sorvino. He should have known better! Period! The images are horrible and excessive - witless and idiotic - displaying no craft, no intelligence. It's all DARK with no HUMOR! Even the make-up is wrong-headed and poorly wrought.

The premise was interesting, the stars were right, but it also sounded like something that could go incredibly wrong if it wasn't done correctly. For me at least, the film was a wonderful viewing experience.The plot of the film follows several people in a post-apocalyptic future where a strange unexplainable phenomenon has caused millions of people to die of organ failure. Out of the tragedy, a company has been spawned: GeneCo- a company that makes organ transplants available to everyone. It doesn't stop with the sick- you can also get your otherwise fine body parts and organs replaced with ""designer"" organs. Can't pay? Expect to meet the Repo Man, the gruesome being who recollects GeneCo's ""property"". It's in the middle of all of this that young Shiloh, a girl with a blood disease that causes her to remain confined inside her room, is introduced.I really enjoyed this film. I honestly wish I could have seen this in theaters when it was released- the colors and visuals in it are spectacular. The singing is pretty good as well- it's not perfect 100% of the movie, but you have to take into account that most of the time where the music ""suffers"" it is to prove how emotional the characters are at that moment.I have to say, I think I've discovered a new favorite musical. Heck, I even loved Paris Hilton in her role- she was pretty perfect as Amber Sweet. If you are considering purchasing this movie, I highly recommend it. If you have any hesitations, then rent it.

However, in spite of the high cost, most people are not content to replace just the malfunctioning organ, but also get everything they want to become young once again. Of course, nobody can afford it, but GENECO has a payment plan which basically means you will spend the rest of your life paying them off.And if you are 90 days late, the Repo Man comes for you to get the organs you purchased regardless of the fact you still need them.So, rest assured, there is a lot of gore in this film and when I say there is a lot I mean when the Repo Men get GENECO's property back from unwilling customers who have defaulted on their accounts there are copious amounts of blood and guts.So most people are going to see this film because they think it's a slasher film.But it really isn't. This is why Repo!: The Genetic Opera has not only received bad reviews from the critics, but couldn't get any decent theatrical release. As a slasher film, the entire movie fails because the blood and gore is not the point. Nor is the supposed ultimate sin of capitalism the point. Or the music (it is a rock opera so 99% of the film is sung).The film actually centers around two men: Nathan Wallace (masterfully played by Anthony Stewart Head) and Rotti Largo (played by Paul Sarvino) and lost in the gothic settings, the blood and the gore, the f-bombs, and the occasional nudity is the story of two men who because of the overwhelming love they have for their ungrateful children have made choices to become desperately evil.Don't believe me? Watch the movie again and look beyond the sets and the shock and listen very carefully when the men interact with their children and what happens in the end.So let's review the first two reasons why Repo!: The Genetic Opera failed with the critics:1. They were expecting a film with a plot no more complex than a slasher film, and2. The actual complex plot of the film is muddled by other elements.Yet, there are two other factors that guaranteed the film's failure. Ready for this?:1. Sarah Brightman playing the role of Blind Mag, and2. Terrance Zdunich playing the role of the Greek Chorus in the character of Graverobber.Now before you send me hate mail, let me explain.The reason they destroyed the film is because they were *too* good.They are so good when they go on the screen all you want to see is more of them. They get the best songs (with the exception of Head's Legal Assassin), the best lines, the best parts, and they play them so well, when they are on the screen, everything and everybody else becomes invisible. Especially when we're talking Sarah Brightman.The film's theme got lost and its plot line derailed by the power and presence Brightman and Zdunich have as actors and singers.So should you watch it?

Just thought I'd get that out of the way.)Set in the proverbial ""not too distant future,"" REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA tells the saga of Shilo Wallace, whose father Nathan is the Repo Man.  What does the Repo Man do?  Well, he's something like the boogeyman; if you've got an organ from organ-making company Geneco (and you do, everyone does), then the Repo Man is the individual they send out if you don't make your payments.  And trust me, you don't want to miss a payment.  'Cause the Repo Man likes his job, and he's just looking for an excuse to take back your kidneys...I know there's a whole cult thing behind REPO; a friend of mine is a big fan.  He's the reason I watched the film.  I'm not too keen on rock operas, but I do love a good horror story, and REPO has a killer one.  It's timely and gory, a great combination.  The story itself is fantastic; the humor is sharp and even subtle at times.  The acting here is pretty good for the most part (Anthony Head steals every scene as the titular character, and Alexa Vega is pretty good as his daughter), though Paris Hilton really shouldn't have been cast; I'm not saying that to jump on the ""bash Paris"" bandwagon, I mean she seriously cannot act.  Or sing.  It's rather confusing why she's in a rock opera in the first place.Sure, some of the songs aren't very clever; some of them ARE good (real good), and they more than make up for the ones that lag behind.  And sure, certain things are cliched, and certain people (ahem! Paris) can't act worth a crap.  What really gets me about the film is the direction.  Many--dare I say most?--scenes are shot like an extended music video.  One scene between Shilo and her father, that takes place in her bedroom, reminds me of too many Lindsay Lohan videos.  The film deserves to be shot as a film; or, barring that, a stage musical.  There's a great story here, and some pretty good acting (Head is worth the price of admission alone), but the way it's shot and cut is just damned frustrating, and that's a shame.Of course, all this is said with a caveat: If you're a cult fan of the tale, then you won't give a damn.

Life and death is theirs to command and, should you fall behind with the repayments on your organ transplant surgery, then they'll gladly dispatch the dreaded Repoman - a nightmarish figure who stalks the darkened streets of this dystopian metropolis like a neo-futuristic combination of Burke and Hare, Batman, Nosferatu and Michael Meyers...Saw II - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)alumnus Darren Lynn Bousman's ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" is a film you're either going to love or hate. No two ways about it. If you can't deal with gore, rock opera, apocalyptic visions of dystopian futures and theatrical bombast, then the chances are that you will hate it. If, however, like me, you grew up with the likes ofTommy,GodspellandJesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition)as the soundtrack to your childhood and slasher movies and cyberpunk as the literary and filmic staple of your teenage years, then I suspect that you will adore it.A cast that boasts the likes of Paul Sorvino, Sarah Brightman, Anthony Stewart Head, Bill Moseley, Nivek Ogre, Alexa Vega, and some chick called Paris Hilton, sing their way with gusto through a film which is almost unlike anything else you've ever seen. I say ""almost unlike"" because if you've ever seen any of Ken Russell's trippier movies from the seventies then you'll have a good idea what you're in for.And be under no illusions, this is an opera of Wagnerian proportions - complete with laments to lost love, paeans to betrayal, familial connivance and even the standard trope of a murder occurring onstage whilst the lights are suddenly dimmed.If any of the above sounds like your thing, I urge to check it out. You won't see a more bizarrely entertaining film this year, and I strongly suspect that you'll find yourself singing the lyrics to the infernally catchy ""Zydrate Anatomy"" for days afterwards.",5,"Ken Russell's ""Blade Runner""",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,2405,"['High', 'ruins', 'futuristic', 'city-state', 'may', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'ruins', 'desolated', 'New', 'York', 'Largo', 'family', 'hold', 'sway', 'vast', 'surgical/cosmetic', 'empire', 'ruthlessness', 'Borgias', 'proprietors', 'GeneCo.', 'sole', 'purveyors', 'organ', 'transplants', ""'Zydrate"", 'addictive', 'drug', 'pain', 'repeated', 'surgery', 'desperate', 'population', 'riddled', 'organ', 'failures', 'genetic', 'conditions', 'brought', 'rigors', 'mid-21st', 'century', 'living', 'rule', 'absolute', 'power', 'lives', 'citizenry', 'Life', 'death', 'theirs', 'command', 'should', 'fall', 'repayments', 'organ', 'transplant', 'surgery', 'then', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'dispatch', 'dreaded', 'Repoman', 'nightmarish', 'figure', 'who', 'darkened', 'streets', 'dystopian', 'metropolis', 'neo-futuristic', 'combination', 'Burke', 'Hare', 'Batman', 'Nosferatu', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'Saw', 'II', 'Unrated', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'two', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'gore', 'rock', 'opera', 'apocalyptic', 'visions', 'dystopian', 'futures', 'theatrical', 'bombast', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'hate', 'however', 'grew', 'up', 'likes', 'ofTommy', 'GodspellandJesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Special', 'Edition', 'soundtrack', 'childhood', 'slasher', 'movies', 'cyberpunk', 'literary', 'filmic', 'staple', 'teenage', 'years', 'then', 'suspect', 'will', 'adore', 'it.A', 'cast', 'likes', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Nivek', 'Ogre', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'chick', 'called', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'sing', 'way', 'gusto', 'film', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'say', 'almost', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'trippier', 'movies', 'seventies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'for.And', 'be', 'illusions', 'opera', 'Wagnerian', 'proportions', 'complete', 'laments', 'lost', 'love', 'paeans', 'betrayal', 'familial', 'connivance', 'even', 'standard', 'trope', 'murder', 'occurring', 'onstage', 'whilst', 'lights', 'are', 'suddenly', 'dimmed.If', 'above', 'sounds', 'thing', 'urge', 'check', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'bizarrely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'year', 'strongly', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'find', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'infernally', 'catchy', 'Zydrate', 'Anatomy', 'days', 'afterwards']",Repo The Genetic Opera

The sets are pathetic, the CGI is laughable, costumes are insipid, uninspired and sensless. These costumes often look like something rejected for INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.

1217367,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001MT7ZEW,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","""Repo: The Genetic Opera"" is based on the stage musical which was based on the book ""The Repossession Mambo"" by Eric Garcia which the newly released movie ""Repo Men"" is also based on. While the new movie embraces a ""Minority Report"" theme and fashions artificial organs, the musical sticks to an even grittier story with actual organs being traded and repossessed like hunks of bloody meat. Anthony Stewart Head plays Nathan, the Repo Man who works for GeneCo headed by Rotti Largo, played by Paul Sorvino. Nathan has a daughter with a blood condition, Shilo played by Alexa Vega that he keeps hidden away in a tower like Rapunzel. As Shilo seeks a cure to her condition and questions about her past, she is sucked into the GeneCo world as all answers will be found at the spectacular last performance of the Blind Mag at the Genetic Opera. Almost all the dialogue in this movie is sung.What I really liked about this film was the way it was shot. It used an exposure filter that makes everything dark in a Tim Burton type of way and at times super glowy like a music video. It is a little blurry and hard to see sometimes, but it works in this story of a search for answers that take on increasing clarity and the focused perception lets you know what to notice. The home set reminds me of the Haunted Mansion at Disney World in its style and it has misty 3D portraits of Shilo's mother, Marni placed thoughtfully throughout as a constant reminder of her legacy to Shilo and the burdens left upon Nathan by her death.Another really great stylistic choice was using comic panels to introduce and tell the back stories of characters. It feels like it is coming straight out of a graphic novel like ""Sin City"" and keeps the narrative straight with all these different characters jumping in and out. Each story contains and important secret and answer that adds to the culminating tension.Anthony Stewart Head is mostly remembered for being Giles in the very popular ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series that once did a musical episode. His voice has rock edge and flavor to it unexpected from a man type cast as a librarian. He has to go back and forth between over-protectiveness to his daughter, guilt over her predicament, and hiding his contractual profession from her. When he dons his suit and goes into Repo Man mode, he brings a relish to his job that Jude Law and Forest Whitaker never had. In one scene, he removes a man's intenstines and proceeds to use him as a hand puppet during the song ""Thankless Job.""Alexa Vega got most of her fame in kids' movies like the ""Spykids"" franchise. How she got from that to this is beyond me. As Shilo, she wears a black wig that makes her look like a young Morticia Addams or Winona Ryder. Shilo is the innocent in this story, a victim of her circumstances and a pawn in a larger game. She still tries to play Nancy Drew and make her own decisions, but acting out against her dad (the song ""Seventeen"") feels like a girl throwing a fit and dressing promiscuously to irritate him.The most awkward casting job is of Paul Sorvino as Rotti Largo. What works well is his appearance looking like the head of the Italian mob to be the head of the evil corporation. His voice has a lot of vibrato and a good operatic tone when he gets into longer notes, but whenever he has lines of dialogue to speak-sing, it comes off really unnatural and funny. Being the main villain, I do not think we are supposed to be laughing at him quite so much.While you might just hate the idea of Paris Hilton being in this movie (or any movie), there is no doubt that she is perfectly and ironically cast here. If it were 2056 and people were getting organs replaced for cosmetic reasons, this is exactly who Paris Hilton would be. Amber Sweet is daughter to Rotti Largo, head of GeneCo and is widely believed to be first in line to inherit the company since her brothers, Luigi (Bill Moseley) and Pavi (Nivek Ogre) are too annoyingly incompetent to even consider. Luigi has a short temper and is prone to killing his subordinates. Pavi has a weird facial fetish and is constantly replacing his face with new ones held in place with clamps looking like Greek theatrical masks.Amber's flaw though, is an addiction to...surgery. The only way to ease her pain is to take a drug called Zydrate. Funny thing is she is supposed to be spokesperson for the Zydrate Support Network. Paris Hilton gets to dance in skimpy outfits and act like a loose, extremely bratty drug addict with a terrible singing voice which is why it works so well with her. Probably the funniest part of the film is when Amber attempts to sing at the Genetic Opera and her face falls off.By far the coolest character in this film that made the movie memorable is the great Sarah Brightman who originated the character of Christine in ""Phantom of the Opera"". Here she plays Blind Mag, Shilo's mother's best friend who got new eyes from GeneCo and has been singing for them under contract as a spokesperson ever since. She wants to break her contract which compels Rotti to order Nathan to repossess her eyes as Repo Man. As soon as she gets on the scene, the movie gets more exciting. Her magic eyes start whirling around and create holograms. She is clearly the most vocally trained in the movie and most talented. Her performance at the Genetic Opera is the best singing in the film and it's a shame that her part isn't bigger.The biggest surprise for me was finding out that Terrance Zdunich who plays the GraveRobber is also an Art Director on this film and many others and this was his first onscreen credit in a film. He handles it amazingly well considering the singing, particularly the screaming note of ""GRAVES!!!"" He looks like a vampire with a bit of Cabaret style to it. He also co-wrote the play and screenplay with Darren Smith.This film has lots of B movie style cheap thrills with violence which you could expect from the director of three movies in the ""Saw"" franchise. There is lots of swearing and the film maintains an edgy rock vibe through most of it. If you like rock operas and/or B horror and the basic premise shared with ""Repo Men"", you would probably like this. Otherwise, this is not a movie for your parents or grandparents and is more of a cult hit than mainstream.",4,"Repo The Genetic Opera is disturbing but visually stunning, Thank goodness for Sarah

I had rememberd seeing it on a shelf at a store and was kinda curious to see it, but was thinking it might be some kind of senseless bloody romp of some sort, though it looked to have a great cast...including Sarah Brightman and Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anthony Stewart Head (I loved him in that show!)  It also includes Paul Sorvino, who is pretty cool, and a grown up Spy Kids' Alexa Vega.  When I watched it, I was actually surprised by it.  The gore was very minimal, maybe a couple of scenes of it, and the rest of it was a well orchastrated musical, and most of the cast sang very well.  I wasn't worried about Anthony Steward Head, becasue I knew he could sing after a few episodes I'd seen of Buffy, especially the episode entitled One More Time With Feeling...a fully musical episode of the show.  Everyone was great though, or at least for what their roles were.  It's definitely Gothic, but definitely in a cool way.  All in all though, this is really not as bad as it might seem at a glance...it poses mainly as a cool and interesting musical, and not actually too bloody, like Repo Men, which deals with a similar premis.  (Repo Men isn't bad, but definitely not for those of a weaker constitution).  If you like musicals and aren't offended or grossed out by a small bit of gore, you should definitely check this out.

When I first heard the title, I thought it was something to do with Repoing cars, but it is body parts, which makes all the difference.  I am a gore fan, and there is plenty to go around.  Add to that a brilliant musical score that has something for everyone, from rock to dance to opera, and a brilliant cast, even Paris Hilton is almost unrecognizable as Amber Sweet.  Everyone truly outperformed in this film.  The love triangles, or squares, and the daddy/daughter relationship really take it over the top.

1217377,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B001MT7ZEW,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 3]","Can't quite remember how I first heard of this, but I'm very glad I did. And I know why it didn't hit theaters, it was WAY too original (mishmashing cult classic films like Saw, Moulin Rouge, Sweeney Todd, and even Rocky Horror Picture Show can be quite risky, but this did it effectively).First, what I love most- interconnecting and interwtining backgrounds and stories that make one very complex (yet beautiful) story. Bloody violence for a very bloody time, an epidemic has wiped out much of the world's population, only for a cure to be demanded, and a ""savior"" has risen to the challenge... but the ""savior"" can't help his own dying self. And no one, at the moment, save his doctor, knows he's dying, which gives him opportunity to figure out who he's willing to give his fortunes to. Nah, not his bum children (why a trio of stooges like a necrophiliac rapist, high-time walking time bomb, and extrme drug addict?), no, it goes to the product of his late love, a beautiful teenager who looks precisely like his late love, except for one problem (make that two), a blood condition that she'll always need constant cure for, and her father (who basically stole his love's heart), a medical scientist haunted by a false belief that he accidentally killed his wife while she was giving birth. Okay, will's done, but the bum kids don't really have a clue of how to do anything properly, unlike the narrator of this morbidly hilarious tale, the Grave Robber (hands-down, the most original-and likable-narrator in an opera-style movie I've ever seen). A truly unique character, the Grave Robber also has an addiction, but not of taking a drug, but of stealing from the dead and manufacturing a cheap, street version of the world's known cure. And the girl's father? If a person purchases an organ and can't make due payment, they can't even run from him for their life, he's always got a way to get them, kill them, and take back what they had. No need to be gentle, either. Only, there's an added problem, that father is also the head honcho's personal assistant for this kind of task.Confused yet? This story seems to be mostly about personal connections in very emotional ways. Lost pasts, unstable familiality, distrust between family, etc. And, like Shakespeare, it even bends and combines genres. Unlike Shakespeare, it also includes some of the best rock music and rock ballads, period. (I still can't listen to ""Chase the Morning"" without having my waterworks going crazy- in other words, I always end up crying during that song) So, is this movie worth watching? Let's see... it's the best-looking futuristic indie film I've seen to date, has disturbing/unique characters (some you hate, but most you can't help but love, in my case, Grave Robber, Pavi, and the scientist's daughter, Shilo Wallace [Alexa Vega did her role perfectly, I have to say, so did Terrance Zdunich as Grave Robber, which co-created the play/movie anyway]), and excellently well-made rock music throughout (it helps that Slipknot's ""The Clown"" helped with the drums for the soundtrack), yes, this was completely worth the time.No, wait, scratch that, it's STILL worth it.I'm not sure I can wait for The Devil's Carnival (for once, The Clown gets his debut movie role, not just working on the soundtrack, and ""Grave Robber"" gets to be the Devil).",5,Cult classic craziness done perfectly well,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3328,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'how', 'first', 'heard', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'theaters', 'was', 'WAY', 'too', 'original', 'mishmashing', 'cult', 'classic', 'films', 'Saw', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'even', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'risky', 'did', 'effectively', '.First', 'what', 'love', 'most-', 'interconnecting', 'interwtining', 'backgrounds', 'stories', 'make', 'one', 'very', 'complex', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Bloody', 'violence', 'very', 'bloody', 'time', 'epidemic', 'wiped', 'out', 'much', 'world', 'population', 'only', 'cure', 'be', 'demanded', 'savior', 'risen', 'challenge', 'savior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'own', 'dying', 'self', 'one', 'moment', 'save', 'doctor', 'dying', 'opportunity', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'willing', 'give', 'fortunes', 'Nah', 'not', 'bum', 'children', 'why', 'trio', 'stooges', 'necrophiliac', 'rapist', 'high-time', 'walking', 'time', 'bomb', 'extrme', 'drug', 'addict', 'product', 'late', 'love', 'beautiful', 'teenager', 'who', 'precisely', 'late', 'love', 'one', 'problem', 'make', 'two', 'blood', 'condition', ""'ll"", 'always', 'need', 'constant', 'cure', 'father', 'who', 'basically', 'stole', 'love', 'heart', 'medical', 'scientist', 'haunted', 'false', 'belief', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'wife', 'was', 'giving', 'birth', 'Okay', 'will', 'done', 'bum', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'do', 'anything', 'properly', 'narrator', 'morbidly', 'hilarious', 'tale', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'hands-down', 'most', 'original-and', 'likable-narrator', 'opera-style', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'truly', 'unique', 'character', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'also', 'addiction', 'not', 'taking', 'drug', 'stealing', 'dead', 'manufacturing', 'cheap', 'street', 'version', 'world', 'known', 'cure', 'girl', 'father', 'person', 'purchases', 'organ', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'due', 'payment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'run', 'life', 'always', 'got', 'way', 'get', 'kill', 'take', 'back', 'what', 'had', 'No', 'need', 'be', 'gentle', 'either', 'Only', 'added', 'problem', 'father', 'also', 'head', 'honcho', 'personal', 'assistant', 'kind', 'task.Confused', 'yet', 'story', 'be', 'mostly', 'personal', 'connections', 'very', 'emotional', 'ways', 'Lost', 'pasts', 'unstable', 'familiality', 'distrust', 'family', 'etc', 'Shakespeare', 'even', 'combines', 'genres', 'Shakespeare', 'also', 'best', 'rock', 'music', 'rock', 'ballads', 'period', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Chase', 'Morning', 'having', 'waterworks', 'going', 'crazy-', 'other', 'words', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'crying', 'song', 'So', 'movie', 'watching', 'Let', 'see', 'best-looking', 'futuristic', 'indie', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'disturbing/unique', 'characters', 'hate', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'case', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'Pavi', 'scientist', 'daughter', 'Shilo', 'Wallace', '[', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'did', 'role', 'perfectly', 'have', 'say', 'so', 'did', 'Terrance', 'Zdunich', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'co-created', 'play/movie', 'anyway', ']', 'excellently', 'well-made', 'rock', 'music', 'Slipknot', 'Clown', 'helped', 'drums', 'soundtrack', 'yes', 'was', 'completely', 'time.No', 'wait', 'scratch', 'STILL', 'worth', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'wait', 'Devil', 'Carnival', 'once', 'Clown', 'debut', 'movie', 'role', 'not', 'just', 'working', 'soundtrack', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'be', 'Devil']",Repo The Genetic Opera

1217382,AOU326NXJG4A4,B001MT7ZEW,Jimmy,"[0, 1]","While sitting bored one day, this movie was recommended to me to watch. I watched it thinking that it was going to be boring and something to just kill time with. After watching it though, I quickly changed my mind. Giles from BTVS has the title role of the repo man, Paris Hilton plays the part of a plastic surgery addicted junkie, (reflecting reality?), and assorted other actors help to round out the movie. Lot's of singing, not bad, some of them though, not extremely good, extreme amounts of obvious fake blood. Good story line.I would have to say though, even though I was an avid fan of the Once More With Feeling episode of BTVS, the only reason I was able to spend 2 hours listening to Giles, (Anthony Head), was because his daughter had a better voice, and the character Blind Meg.Blind Meg should have been an actual singer. Her voice is unlike anything I've heard in a long time. She seems to sing with a feeling for all of the songs as if they are a part of her, as if she has lived the events that make the songs what they are. When she sings, it's as if she isn't an actress in a movie, but actually telling you how she feels. Acting in a movie like that is no longer run of the mill, but instead, hard to find. Blind Meg sets the movie apart for me by herself.Anthony Head also plays his part well, but not what one might be used to seeing on BTVS. I know it seems that I compare his performance alot to BTVS, but it's the only other thing I know he played in, and it was a better performance, even if he did have 7 years to perfect it.The coolest part though, would have to be when Paris Hilton's face slides off, (sorry, spoiler), but as superficial as she is on her reality show, one couldn't really expect her in a movie with a serious part.All in all though, the movie was good, definately not a waste of time, and worth spending the money on.",5,Not your momma's opera,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,1866,"['sitting', 'bored', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'watch', 'watched', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'boring', 'something', 'just', 'kill', 'time', 'watching', 'quickly', 'changed', 'mind', 'Giles', 'BTVS', 'title', 'role', 'repo', 'man', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'part', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'addicted', 'junkie', 'reflecting', 'reality', 'assorted', 'other', 'actors', 'help', 'round', 'out', 'movie', 'Lot', 'singing', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'extremely', 'good', 'extreme', 'amounts', 'obvious', 'fake', 'blood', 'Good', 'story', 'line.I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'even', 'was', 'avid', 'fan', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'episode', 'BTVS', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'able', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'listening', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'was', 'daughter', 'had', 'better', 'voice', 'character', 'Blind', 'Meg.Blind', 'Meg', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'singer', 'voice', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'long', 'time', 'sing', 'feeling', 'songs', 'are', 'part', 'her', 'lived', 'events', 'make', 'songs', 'what', 'are', 'When', ""n't"", 'actress', 'movie', 'actually', 'telling', 'how', 'Acting', 'movie', 'longer', 'run', 'mill', 'instead', 'hard', 'find', 'Blind', 'Meg', 'movie', 'apart', 'herself.Anthony', 'Head', 'also', 'part', 'well', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'seeing', 'BTVS', 'know', 'compare', 'performance', 'alot', 'BTVS', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'know', 'played', 'was', 'better', 'performance', 'even', 'did', 'have', '7', 'years', 'perfect', 'it.The', 'coolest', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'when', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'face', 'sorry', 'spoiler', 'as', 'superficial', 'reality', 'show', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'movie', 'serious', 'part.All', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'definately', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'worth', 'spending', 'money']",Repo The Genetic Opera

It's about what if we all got greedy with too much plastic surgery and too much beauty on the outside, the acting is quite good here and there's memorable rock musical numbers that are very original. There's even some scenes of gruesome gore that doesn't go over the top but in a more comical kind of way and some awesome animated comic-book esque panals that tell the story of the film more during some parts of the film, this movie is guaranteed to be a geniune cult classic for years to come and has recently been nominated for best music score.This Blu-ray features eyepopping picture and sound with awesome extras like audio commentaries, Theatrical Trailer, Poster gallery, featurettes, sing-a-along features, Select Scne commentary with Paris Hilton and Director Darren Lynn Bousman, Deleted Scenes with optional commentary and ""Form Stage to Screen"" documentary, i highly recommend this movie.Also recommended: ""Heavy Metal"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Blade Runner"", ""V For Vendetta"", ""Poultreygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead"", ""The Phantom of the Opera (2004)"", ""Akira"", ""Escape from New York"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"", ""Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)"", ""Babylon A.D."", ""Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2"", ""Flash Gordon"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Dark City"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""The Island (2005)"", ""Gattaca"", ""28 Days/Weeks Later"", ""Terminator 1 & 2"", ""Rock and Rule"", and ""Total Recall"".",5,A modern cult classic!,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,2761,"['far', 'future', 'outbreak', 'organ', 'failures', 'spread', 'world', 'nearly', 'killing', 'off', 'entire', 'population', 'However', 'biotech', 'company', 'called', 'Geneco', 'ran', 'corporate', 'fatcat', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'now', 'organ', 'transplants', 'good', 'price', 'unfortunately', 'require', 'monthly', 'payments', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'transplants', 'pay', 'price', 'repossession', 'Repo', 'Men', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'organs', 'away', 'crummy', 'world', 'where', 'crime', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'addicted', 'surgery', 'drugs', 'young', 'girl', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'rare', 'disase', 'need', 'cure', 'Grave', 'Robber', 'Terrence', 'Zdunich', 'who', 'help', 'her.An', 'outstanding', 'gory', 'unique', 'Sci-fi/horror/fantasy/comedy', 'musical', 'rock', 'opera', 'makers', 'Saw', 'series', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousmann', 'one-of-a-kind', 'extraganza', 'based', 'cult', 'stage', 'musical', 'Co-starring', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', '2', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'Ogre', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'film', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'futuristic', 'satire', 'what', 'rights', 'have', 'perminate', 'transplant', 'organs', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'were', 'loan', 'also', 'metaphor', 'consumerism', 'much', 'Romero', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'did', 'what', 'got', 'greedy', 'too', 'much', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'too', 'much', 'beauty', 'outside', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'memorable', 'rock', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'very', 'original', 'even', 'scenes', 'gruesome', 'gore', ""n't"", 'go', 'top', 'more', 'comical', 'kind', 'way', 'awesome', 'animated', 'comic-book', 'esque', 'panals', 'tell', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'parts', 'film', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'geniune', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'come', 'recently', 'been', 'nominated', 'best', 'music', 'score.This', 'Blu-ray', 'features', 'eyepopping', 'picture', 'sound', 'awesome', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Poster', 'gallery', 'featurettes', 'sing-a-along', 'features', 'Select', 'Scne', 'commentary', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Form', 'Stage', 'Screen', 'documentary', 'i', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie.Also', 'recommended', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Grindhouse', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'Poultreygeist', 'Night', 'Chicken', 'Dead', 'Phantom', 'Opera', '2004', 'Akira', 'Escape', 'New', 'York', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Riki-Oh', 'Story', 'Ricky', 'Sweeny', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', '2007', 'Babylon', 'A.D.', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '1', '2', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Dark', 'City', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Island', '2005', 'Gattaca', '28', 'Days/Weeks', 'Later', 'Terminator', '1', '2', 'Rock', 'Rule', 'Total', 'Recall']",Repo The Genetic Opera

1217389,A1U74I9FWDMGEW,B001MT7ZEW,Joshua,"[1, 2]","The creators of Repo! describe the film as a cross between the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Blade Runner.  Visually and thematically this is pretty close to what you are going to get.  Repo! is just campy enough to make it fun to watch with friends, yet well done enough to give it staying power.Others have gone into detail about the plot, so I'm not going to bother.  Visually and sonically, Repo! is stunning.  The music ranges in quality from good to amazing.  Head's Legal Assassin and Brightman's Chase the Morning are particularly eerie, and are arguably the best numbers in the entire film.  Another jewel of the film is Zdunich's Zydrate Anatomy.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of singing in the film.  I had never seen her in another role, but Vega has quite a set of pipes on her.  I'm never thrilled to see Paris Hilton in a movie, but this was not a Paris Hilton Movie.  She played a smaller part than many in the ensemble, and she was good enough that she wasn't distracting.I major word of warning should be issued to the squeamish or easily offended.  In terms of its horror roots, Repo! is no SAW.  You should not expect gratuitous violence and gore around absolutely every turn, but keep in mind that this is a film about an assassin who removes people's vital organs.  If you would be turned off by a violent depiction of disembowelment this picture is probably not for you.  Besides that there is some profanity, nudity, and sexual content that others may take issue with.  Repo! is rated R for a reason.There are some nice features on the blu-ray.  There are several interesting featurettes on the history of and making of Repo! and some cut scenes.  Four of the more prominent songs also have their own sing-along style tracks with a bouncing human heart guiding you through the lyrics.  Despite this, I found the features a little lacking.  It would be nice to have the option to view the full film (a handful of numbers were cut out completely for this release).  The sing-along was great fun.  We watched Repo! at a party with friends and after the movie we went through the special features.  We played the sing-along tracks just for the hell of it and found ourselves singing along with the tracks.  It would be nice to have a version where this option was available not only for select scenes, but for the entire film (or at least for more than just four major numbers overlaid with the movie for a different experience).  If such a version were to come out it would also be nice to see additional features, including a piece on the Repo! tour.  The film is just begging for a multi-disc directors cut to come out, and I hope that we see that happen in the near future.Overall I am rating this five stars, not because the film or the blu-ray features were perfect, but because the movie was refreshing and very fun to watch.  This is one of those movies that I will be able to watch again and again.  I would recommend doing as I did, and watching this not by yourself, but with several like-minded friends.

1217392,AVHE883R6FCEB,B001MT7ZEW,"Kaoru Hiratsuka ""Linguist""","[3, 6]","First of all let me state that this review is written exclusively for Sarah Brightman fans debating whether or not to buy ""Repo"" however, I do feel that others may also find this review helpful as well.Before I begin let me say that I feel that ""Repo"" was very unfairly slammed by the American Press and did NOT get a fair review at all.  It's a very, very good movie when you consider what it is...which is a CULT film/musical like the famous/infamous ""Rocky Horror.""Sarah Brightman's fans may be puzzled why she made such a film.  Let me state that if you look at her career, she's ALWAYS liked scary stuff and is obviously a fan of classical British horror (i.e. Hammer Films, etc.)  In fact, in her latest stage production of ""Symphony"" there is a very cool sequence where she, as ""Red Riding Hood"" pedels a bike frantically through a forest pursed by wolves that is brilliant (this is the actual live tour, and is sadly NOT, I repeat NOT on the ""Symphony"" Vienna DVD.)""Repo"" is very scary, and also very funny and also very moving.  Before passing judgement on it unfairly, consider this...when it first came out ""Rocky Horror"" was viewed as shocking and NOBODY liked it...in fact it tanked.  Now, over a span of literally DECADES it's cool and even oldsters like it.  The same holds for ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which, when it was released was a ground-breaking horror/musical which people thought was somewhat shocking.  So use this perspective to judge ""Repo"" which is the 21st century version of ""Rocky Horror"" (yes...remember guys it's a NEW century!)  With that being said let's talk about Sarah Brightman in the movie.Her performance is nothing short of brilliant and is, frankly the BEST performance in the movie, even though she isn't the main character.  She's a real show-stealer.  Her appearance at Shiloh's house is one of the best scenes in the movie and for those of us who didn't get to see her in the original ""Phantom of the Opera"" we can get an idea of why she made it the most popular musical thus-to-date. (As an aside, it's sad that apparently NOBODY made a visual recording of the original ""Phantom"" although original cast CD's exist.)Unless you've seen her live, this will be one of your best bets, and perhaps your only chance to see how good she is at live theatre/stage musicals.  She's GREAT.  It's very important to remember that before she became a cross-over artist, Sarah Brightman was a singer and a dancer and a stage performer.  ""Repo"" gives you, her fan, a chance to see why she's so good in live theatre.  However, before you buy it, you need to consider two things: 1. Many people in the USA who like Sarah Brightman are somewhat conservative...so you have to visualize the following scene.  Remember at the start of ""La Luna"" where Sarah Brightman appears on the steps dressed like a Greecian priestess and sings, ""Winter in July.""  Now imagine the end of ""Harem"" where she sings, ""A Question of Honor.""  Now combine both of those and visualize her being brutally and ritually sacrificed.  (I'm not adding any spoilers here...just setting the tone.)  If that thought bothers you, and you do NOT like blood and gore then DON'T buy ""Repo!!!!""  That simple.  If, however you are intrigued...perhaps remembering how the great Kate Bush also let herself get brutally strangled on the stage at the end of her song, ""Hammer Horror"" then BUY ""Repo.""  2. MANY of Sarah Brightman's USA fans also have children who LOVE Sarah Brightman.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT show this movie to your kids...it will upset them TOO MUCH.  Did you hear that...don't show this movie to young children!With that being said, let's recap our criteria for buying ""Repo."" First: You have to be willing to want to be really scared and be willing to see Sarah Brightman bring off a death worthy of Shakespeare or Sophocles or John Webster and Second: If you have young children who love Sarah DO NOT show this to them! Did you hear that...NO children should watch this no matter how much they love Sarah...ok!!!!So, if you are up to it, ""Repo"" will give you an idea of how brilliant Sarah Brightman is in live theatre (since most people in the States have never been able to see her in that medium.) I loved ""Repo"" and hope that Sarah Brightman might actually be encouraged to do some more(perhaps less violent)movie musicals so we can see her talent in that medium as well.  I also think that it's exciting she did this because younger adult Americans who've never heard of her (she gets virtually NO air time here in the States) will perhaps become intrigued and start buying her music.Let's remember that it's easy to judge something young and new like ""Repo"" and say it's violence and trash.  HOWEVER, let me remind everybody that at one time that remark was made about all classical drama or literature.  Shakespeare is EXTREMELY violent as is Sophocles.  One of the most violent and sexy snuff scenes I've ever seen was a live stage production of the ""Duchess of Malfi"" by John Webster. (I'm a military historian, but my undergraduate degree is World Literature.)  In fact, I'm pretty sure that this violence is the reason why the ""Duchess of Malfi"" is seldom performed in the USA and that there is NO DVD of it.  In addition, if anybody has ever seen live Kabuki theatre it's EXTREMELY bloody with heads flying off, blood spraying and women dying from being stabbed in the throat. So it's important to remember that in a stage production like ""Repo"" the violence is NOT the mindless violence of a ""Terminator"" movie...the violence has a point.  ""Repo"" like the ""Duchess of Malfi"" or ""Oedipus Rex"" or ""Hamlet"" is a morality play.  However, it's a MODERN morality play for a young-adult audience.  So...if you're a Sarah Brightman fan,and bloody stage violence ala ""Julius Caesar"" doesn't bother you and you think you can stand watching her die nobly and tragically like the Duchess of Mali does in Webster's play, then get ""Repo"" with the caveat that you DO NOT show this to younger children who might also be Sarah Brightman fans. Did you hear that...don't show it to young children who like Sarah Brightman!  (But you can watch it, shudder with terror and enjoy!) P.S. I must admit that even though I enjoyed ""Repo"" I hope that if Sarah makes any more movies perhaps they won't be this violent so that her younger, more sensitive fans can see her stage/theatre talents as well.",5,Should I buy this?

1217400,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B001MT7ZEW,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[1, 2]","I wasn't a huge fan of the Darren Lynn Bousman Saw movies. I really dug Saw II, but only because it was the only of the Saw films that had any potential. I mean, it picked up right after Saw 1 ended, which was necessary considering how that film ended. But after two and the ridiculous plot twists they started to take, I gave up on the series. I did see 3 and 4, but to be honest, I don't remember really anything about them- that's how forgettable they were. And no, I have not seen Saw 5 and am not particularly excited to.So naturally I was a bit apprehensive about Repo. I thought the plot was stupid, and what the hell was a 'rock opera'? I had never heard of anything like that before, and with such a strange storyline (not to mention Paris Hilton), I had planned to never see this film. But one night, I was sitting around, bored as hell, and flipping through movies on demand when I saw Repo. I had been told be a friend just how amazing Repo was, and I figured 'what the hell. If it sucks, it's only $[...] and and hour and a half out of my life.' So I watched it. And am I glad I did.Like most people, it took me a while to comprehend exactly what it was that I had just watched. I was confused, amazed, excited, and surprised-  like most people that saw this film. And after seeing it four times now, I think I can make a pretty safe review about this film.It rocks.I'm not going to rehash the story. If you want to know what it's about you can either look it up or read the other reviews. I'm going to get into the meat of this review- the music.I'm not going to lie, I had my doubts about the music when I first saw the film. It wasn't exactly catchy, but it wasn't terrible to listen to. It's one of those things that has to grow on you, and the more I watched the movie the more I started singing along with the songs. The one that stuck with me from the get go was Zydrate Anatomy, which is catchy, strange, and just fun to hear. The Graverobber, by Terrance Zdunich, is a valuable asset to the soundtrack. I know he can't really technically sing, but I find his voice to be an interesting, fun addition to the soundtrack. Alexa Vega shows us here that she can sing, something I never knew about her, and she is damn good at what she does. She plays Shiloh, the innocent, naiive girl, to a T. Anthony Head is really great in his part and even sings really well, especially in the song Legal Assassin. Even Paris Hilton doesn't do a half bad job, aside from one agonizing note in Zydrate Anatomy.However, some of the songs are less than memorable. Golds falls flat, in my opinion, and the others I can't even remember the names of. But I really loved the ballad 'I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much', because it was sung so emotionally between Anthony and Alexa. It really touches a chord.No review would be complete if you didn't talk about the truly wonderful way that this film was shot. The sets are gorgeous and Darren uses some amazing filters and camera tricks to pull off some of the shots. True, it's not that much of a departure from the Saw films (look out for an abundance of yellows and blues), but the way this film is shot, even though we've seen it before from Darren, feels completely new.However, the DVD falls flat. I know that Lionsgate tried to push this movie underneath the carpet and kind of screwed it, and I'm glad I at least have it on DVD, but this is the WRONG place to go for special features. It's even more bare than the 2 disc edition of The Dark Knight.  We get a 10 minute Stage To Screen feature, and a featurette about the Legal Assassin, and a trailer, some commentary- that's it. It's a bare bones DVD, again, from Lionsgate Pictures. Thanks for screwing us again Lionsgate!But if you just want the movie, you got it here. If you have been curious about the movie, rent it. It does no harm, and it's a fun, great film to watch. But, it truly is only for certain people.

But I enjoy both fields so this was a fun movie for me.  And it's not the worst movie of 2008. There were other  movies that had half this cast and dedication and  that  includes a great Paul Sorvino performance.  No one has anything to be ashamed about here; it's a rock opera stage play transferred to the screen.  It's not a great movie but is a interesting one within it's two genres. I feel that critics should judge horror and musicals both on seperated scales than dramas , and then subdivide them by their budgets. This has a good budget and was done with a certain glee that makes it a fun ride.  You don't need to know much more than the repo man goes after those who can't afford to keep paying for their transplants and that there is a satire element in picturing a future society that is completely surgery crazy both organ wise and plastic surgery wise.Good fun on that level but it's  not for everyone , especially small kids.",4,good horror musical,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,1426,"['movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'easier', 'watch', 'blu', 'ray', 'then', 'everything', 'better', 'blu', 'gory', 'horror', 'film', 'lines', 'sung', 'good', 'hard', 'rock', 'music', 'good', 'cast', 'five', 'minute', 'cameo', 'role', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'started', 'out', 'stage', 'play', 'look', 'even', 'cgi', 'created', 'larger', 'world', 'it.Certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'musicals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'original', 'horror', 'then', 'forget', 'too', 'enjoy', 'fields', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', '2008', 'were', 'other', 'movies', 'had', 'cast', 'dedication', 'great', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'performance', 'one', 'anything', 'be', 'ashamed', 'here', 'rock', 'opera', 'stage', 'play', 'transferred', 'screen', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'interesting', 'one', 'two', 'genres', 'feel', 'critics', 'should', 'judge', 'horror', 'musicals', 'seperated', 'scales', 'dramas', 'then', 'subdivide', 'budgets', 'good', 'budget', 'was', 'done', 'certain', 'glee', 'fun', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'repo', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'keep', 'paying', 'transplants', 'satire', 'element', 'picturing', 'future', 'society', 'completely', 'surgery', 'crazy', 'organ', 'wise', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'wise.Good', 'fun', 'level', 'not', 'everyone', 'especially', 'small', 'kids']",Repo The Genetic Opera

A Goth-themed rock opera directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II, III, & IV), Repo! tells the tale of a future, Blade Runner-inspired world where massive worldwide organ failures have led to the rise of GeneCo; a biotech company run by Rotti Largo (Paul Sorvino) that lends out organs to those that need them.  Failure to pay in full however results in a visit from the Repo Man (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anthony Stewart Head), who has no qualms about getting his hands dirty (and bloody) as he takes them back.  As the story moves on, we learn of Repo Man's sickly beloved daughter Shilo (Alexa Vega) who learns of some deep buried secrets, and Largo's heirs Amber Sweet (Paris Hilton), Luigi (Bill Moseley), and Pavi (Skinny Puppy's Ogre) who are all warring to be left in charge of their sickly father's empire.  The film moves along at a pretty brisk pace, even though its story doesn't always manage to catch up to it.  The film's music is spectacular, and the cast (even Paris Hilton believe it or not) is wonderful as well, as Bousman quickly shines well above anything he's ever done with the Saw series.  Also featuring Sarah Brightman, Repo! stage vet Terrence Zdunich, and a quick cameo from Joan Jett; Repo!

There are outtakes, one specifically involving the Gravedigger and Amber Sweet, that are not on the regular DVD.  The Blu-Ray disc is worth the extra for that single outtake alone.Slightly scurrilous interests aside, there is also another outtake which appears to be a side plot that would make the entire movie more meaningful.  I can't say more without spoiling it, but the song associated with it is, ""Needle Through a Bug""For those of you who are into 'the making of' sequences on DVD's, look at the interviews with the director and Terrance Zdunich--it's very clear that Zdunich is a very good actor when you see him 'as himself'.  The contrast is pretty startling.Finally, in response to the few who haven't liked this because it has some gory moments--if you can't stand horror movies, you should stay away.  But, if you're willing to get into some pretty interesting social commentary about materialism and superficiality, the objectionable parts of this make pretty good metaphors for some of the more crass elements of our society.I watched this with movie buff friends.

The Genetic Opera is a mind blowing treat for everyone who knows a good film when they see it. Of course, little kids should NOT be seeing this- it is incredibly violent and gory. But with that aside, this film is a specatuclar visual and audio treat. With a talented cast of actors (yes, Hilton was good in this) and amazing visuals, this is a must see.Genetics is a bitch. In the year 2056, There has been an epidemic of organ failures. However, GeneCo, a transplant company, has stepped in and decided to help people who have suffered the misfortune of the failure. Such organs as Thyroids, Intestines, Brains, organs, and Spines are replaced and soon, surgery becomes a fashion statement. ""But I can't afford the surgery!"" Well, for a while, they helped fund surgeries. But Months later, those whose payments are past due will be hunted down by The Repo Man.But aside from that. GeneCo is run by the Largo family. Rotti is the father who is dying of a terminal illness. Pavi is a satistic womanizer and rapist who cuts off women's faces and wears them as masks (his face was badly burned). Luigi is a sadistic killer who will kill anything. And Amber is a surgery addict and a Zydrate-addicted whore. But on the Repo Man's family, the Repo Man is Nathan, a man grieving the loss of Marni, his beautiful wife, has a daughter named Shilo, who is confined to a room due to her sickness she inherited from her mother. All of this takes place over the course of one night, the night of the Genetic Opera.This film is one of the best I've ever seen. In a world of horror copycats and torture-porn flicks, this is refreshing and a great change. It has enough gore to keep horror fans satisfied, and is filled with great fun from beginning to end. And I was surprised at how great Paris Hilton was. For the first time ever, she impressed me!Anyways, great movie. See it now!!!

When I saw the cast included Sarah Brightman and Paul Sorvino I was sold (although I was deeply skeptical about the presence of Paris Hilton). The film starts with a comic book narrational device to explain that due to disease people's organs are failing the world over, but one evil company, GeneCo, run by Rotti Largo (Sorvino), has replacement organs available (""Don't worry, GeneCo offers organ financing."") The downside is that GeneCo also has organ repossessors that can repo you organs without warning or anesthesia. This, of course, gives the filmmakers great license to show geysers of gore, most of which is gratuitous to the plot and all of which goes out of the way to be as Sadistic as possible. (Watch for the especially loathsome worst ventriloquism scene ever, which, obviously, involves singing evisceration.)The plot is a sadly predictable and largely centers on deception, cruelty, and revenge within the Rotti extended family, much like an ultra-graphic, murderous soap opera than anything written by Rossini, Donizetti, Mozart, or even Wagner. None of this should have surprised me, as later inspection revealed that the box proudly stated ""From the Producers of 'Saw'""; unfortunately I overlooked that key point when purchasing the DVD.The biggest problems for me, beyond the gore, language, or depravity, were the music, pacing, and almost total lack of suspense. The movie is boring and utterly predictable; pacing and suspense are why some horror films are great with minimal onscreen violence and gore, while others aren't no matter how much splatter is shown. The film was interesting during the opening credits as the premise was unveiled; subsequent to that everything was an excuse to butcher while singing third-rate songs about even the most trivial plotpoints. There were, in fairness, a couple of songs that stood out from the rest and which were performed well, but the majority were rhyme and meter challenged to the extreme. Also to the film's credit, I thought the vocal performances were better than expected, despite the pretentious lyrics. The comic book motif as a linking devise was also tiresome: if you have to use animated title cards to make sense of the plot, there is normally a deeper problem, and that is certainly the case here.I really wanted to like ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", as it has unique elements that had the potential to be a classic. Despite giving it a valiant effort, though, I found no redeeming value in the film, and audiences agreed. The film cost about $8.5 million to make and grossed less than $200,000 at the box office. Certainly DVD sales will enhance the earnings of the film, but I recommend highly that you don't.",1,"Disemboweling, Opera, And Paris Hilton?

1217435,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B001MT7ZEW,S. Morales,"[1, 1]","Repo! is a film that has some great ideas, executes some pretty well, but overall has nothing interesting to withhold it the entire way through, thus causing a flashy play that does nothing more than ultimately bore the viewer who gets everything he/she needs to see within the first half hour. Repo! is told mostly as an ambitious rock opera featuring most scenes sung with background gothic-style rock music in the background. An interesting idea and one of the few things this has going for it.Repo! has lots of things working against it in terms of just being an interesting story to watch unfold, except for its very ambitious and imaginative cinematography which brings us to a future world dsytopia where organ transplants are the new fad, and the #1 corporate provider being that of GeneCo, a company that has instilled a supposedly helpful payment plan so that ALL citizens wishing fashionable organ transplants (some for cosmetic reasons, but others replacing their own hearts? How this actually helps people be more fashionable is never actually revealed at all, and is just an excuse for some gore effects). Now when people aren't able to pay up or meet their end, GeneCo will send out Repo men who will retrieve the merchandise as quickly as possible; hence, killing its customers and opening them up to take back the organs. This is an excuse to make a more &#34;gory&#34; film yet ultimately disappoints pretty heavily in the gore department overall. Anyway, the film also presents how the &#34;black market&#34;of its day digs up dead bodies and sells those GeneCo products to sell to people who can't afford the real thing. These both give us some seemingly great ideas for a movie really in the end never actually utilizes EITHER of them to give us anything interesting, which is beyond disappointing and head-scratchingly  questionable.The Repo! cast consists of mostly no names but we do get a main role played by the guy &#34;Gyles&#34; from the 90s Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series. He plays a doctor and widower who has a teenage daughter suffering from a disease (which I forget) that threatens her life. His goal is to find a way to cure this illness yet is somehow intertwined with GeneCo in a forgettable matter which causes him to basically have trouble conjuring up this cure. The main CEO of GeneCo is also threatened with an illness he needs this same doctor to help him with as well.What catches your eyes first will be the colors themselves;  a dazzling gothic art style chock full of some pretty amazing camera shots using different methods of blur and lighting. Any film student into the darker arts will absolutely take some great inspiration from Repo! as overall the film is just a beautiful thing to look at. Working as kind of an &#34;updated&#34; Rocky Horror Picture Show for the 21st century, the film creates a vividly dark atmosphere with some absolutely beautiful looking ideas. One of these being a showgirl who is blind and had what look like large jewels placed in here eye sockets; she almost resembles operatic pop singer Sarah Brightman in many ways, with abilities to sparkle and do all kinds of pretty effects. I would argue she alone steals the show, however little of it there is. Looking at her alone is just an absolutely pleasure; again, more beautiful visuals. It's just too bad Repo! has little to nothing to hold the viewer's interest beyond this single element.Another plus would be the part of the head black market organ dealer, who has a very commanding and bombastic voice, and does a great job with his song portions. He is one of the few actors in Repo! that actually tries; sadly most either don't seem to care too much, or are plain simple bad actors.The biggest setback that will be apparent to viewers is the part of the teenage daughter, who puts on a mostly mediocre acting job, with little passion or actual talent to play her part. Some parts work well but in the end it's obvious this was the daughter of a producer that just got the part through relation. This is obvious because other very small parts sprinkled throughout just show more enthusiasm than many of the bigger roles.The biggest upset that Repo! commits must be that instead of sticking to a story having to do with the original template (a corporation that sells organs and sends repos to kill non-paying customers, and a black market that tries a loophole to make money) for a lame unoriginal story about a widower and his angst-ridden annoying daughter and their troubled relationship. Because this swap takes place, the film is nowhere near as gory or bloody as many horror and goth fanatics will be pleased with. Though the tone is dark, very little of the film is actually bloody. The creators were obviously just so obsessed with the visual medium and making thing look pretty, that they forgot to actually make an interesting movie. And that gives us our second biggest setback - a blandly told story.Repo is simply a boring movie. The pace works fine but the combination of stale actors, a basic premise, and uninvolving characters make Repo! more of a hassle than it really should be. You really do want to like this movie, but simply can't due to these setbacks.And lastly, the biggest negative for a rock opera musical, is the actual music. When a rock opera has mostly all boring stale songs, you know you're in trouble. Now, it's not all a fail, as some portions of the song beats do sound really fun and melodic, mostly the songs sung by the head black market dealer. Yet, the majority of the songs sound more like those skippable filler tracks you hear off a B-grade rock albums from the 1990s. You tread through them, and feel no real interest not only because they just aren't great songs, but even the actors don't seem to care as much as they should. Perhaps things would have worked better if they just didn't sing at all, or made most of the movie plain dialogue and not a musical at all.Overall, I would only recommend Repo! if you are in the hankering for a visual treat, most especially those of the blind singer, yet through and through, the entire film is a pretty epic feat in visual cinematography. On that note, I did like it, but the hour and 40 minute music video feels about a whole hour too long, with an ending you just won't care to see at all. You may have seen this on sale at your local retailer for a few dollars, which is pretty much what it's worth, but do not pay any more than $7 or $8 for this one. You can definitely pass.",2,"All Flash, Very Little Substance; Don't Bother",1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,6512,"['Repo', 'film', 'great', 'ideas', 'pretty', 'well', 'nothing', 'interesting',

1217436,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B001MT7ZEW,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[4, 6]","Every so often a film of some form or another comes out and sparks a frenzy of interest due to it's complete and utter originality.  In the past films like, ""Reefer Madness"", ""Rocky Horror' and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" were such movies, and all of these movies I adore.  Yet, not until now has one been so perfect for my tastes; past and present.I love horror films, I love musicals, I'm a huge ASH fan (Anthony Stewart Head) and I'm a huge DLB fan. (Darren Lynn Bousman) So when I heard he was releasing a horror/rock opera I was SO there.  Unfortunately, Lionsgate ended up the distributer and I failed to find a theater in even a 100 to 200 mile radius from me where it was playing at, and The Repo road tour didn't come near my home town.  So as soon at it was available to order, I was there.I watched the film and fell in love.  The story is simple. In the future massive global organ failures begin to drastically diminish the population, until a saviour comes out of nowhere in the guise of Geneco run by Rotti Largo (a surprising and fantastic Paul Sorvino) and his three children: Luigi (a murderously evil Bill Moseley of Texas Chainsaw 2), Amber Sweet (played perfectly and sluttily by Paris Hilton) and Pavi (played unrecognizably by Ogre of the group Skinny Puppy).  Geneco gives those suffering from failing organs a chance at a new life; at a price.  If you miss a payment on your new organ Geneco sends out a Repo Man, a legal assassin who's only job is to find you and take back the organ in question, and he doesn't do it nicely.  He rips it out of your body and kills you in the process.  Rotti's head Repo Man is Nathan Wallace (the fantastic Anthony Stewart Head), a former friend and now slave due to what he did to his wife, Rotti's ex girlfriend Marni.  He kills and repo's for Rotti in penance for his crime.  Nathan has a daugther, Shiloh (sung and acted fantastically by ""Spy Kids"" alum Alexa Vega) who he keeps locked up due to a questionable blood disease and his insecurities of the world.  But Shiloh longs for the outside world and in her nightly escapes meets a Graverobber and begins to experience the horrors of the outside world.  Enter Blind Mag ( played incomparably by Sarah Brightman), Marni's best friend and Shiloh's godmother, her struggle for freedom from Geneco, Rotti's masterplan to leave the company with Shiloh, and Nathan's secret life as the Repo man set the stage for a bloody and heartwrenching story of loss, lies, redemption, choice and love beyond measure.Not only is the story well done, the music is fantastic.  With crowd pleasing dance numbers like ""Infected"", ""Zydrate Anatomy"" and ""We Started This Opera S**t"", to roll in the floor pieces like ""Mark It Up"", ""Thankless Job"" and ""Bravi!"" to the heart wrenching ""Chase The Morning"" , ""Gold"" and ""I didn't know I loved you so Much"".  The music is fantastic and so original, and not just there for kicks but there to serve and push the plot forward.The film also gives us horror fans a good bit of gore, from ripped out hearts, to disemboweled torso's, to severed heads and ripped out spinal cords.  The gore is top notch but not so over the top as to pull you from the plot (except for in ""Thankless Job"" which gets a good chuckle.)  The acting is also top notch.  I find it hard to believe that Anthony Stewart Head (Giles of ""Buffy"") was not honored with a Golden Globe nom in the very least.  His portrayal of a haunted and overprotective father is heartwrenching to watch.  He has singing chops as well.  Paul Sorvino is captivating to watch as Rotti Largo, and damn can he sing. (he shines in the song ""Gold"".)  Alexa Vega is well cast as Shiloh, and she gets her time to shine with the infectious sound of ""Infected"" and the angry ""Seventeen"".  But it is Sarah Brightman who truly shines.  I was unable to keep my eyes of her as she was beautiful to look at and also to listen to.  ""Chase the Morning"" and ""Cromaggia"" are two of the best songs I've ever heard in ANY musical.  No wonder their being considered for Oscar noms.All in all you can't miss this film.  If you love horror, watch it. If you love musicals, watch it.  If you love different and original, watch it.  And if you don't like these things you should still watch it.""Chase the Morning,  Yield for Nothing""",5,"""Things you see in a graveyard"" are a wonder to behold.",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,4296,"['so', 'often', 'film', 'form', 'out', 'sparks', 'frenzy', 'interest', 'due', 'complete', 'utter', 'originality', 'past', 'films', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Attack', 'Killer', 'Tomatoes', 'were', 'such', 'movies', 'movies', 'adore', 'not', 'now', 'one', 'been', 'so', 'perfect', 'tastes', 'past', 'present.I', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'love', 'musicals', ""'m"", 'huge', 'ASH', 'fan', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', ""'m"", 'huge', 'DLB', 'fan', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'releasing', 'horror/rock', 'opera', 'was', 'SO', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'Lionsgate', 'ended', 'up', 'distributer', 'failed', 'find', 'theater', 'even', '100', '200', 'mile', 'radius', 'where', 'was', 'playing', 'Repo', 'road', 'tour', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'home', 'town', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'order', 'was', 'there.I', 'watched', 'film', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'simple', 'future', 'massive', 'global', 'organ', 'failures', 'begin', 'drastically', 'diminish', 'population', 'saviour', 'nowhere', 'guise', 'Geneco', 'run', 'Rotti', 'Largo', 'surprising', 'fantastic', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'three', 'children', 'Luigi', 'murderously', 'evil', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', '2', 'Amber', 'Sweet', 'played', 'perfectly', 'sluttily', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Pavi', 'played', 'unrecognizably', 'Ogre', 'group', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'Geneco', 'suffering', 'failing', 'organs', 'chance', 'new', 'life', 'price', 'miss', 'payment', 'new', 'organ', 'Geneco', 'out', 'Repo', 'Man', 'legal', 'assassin', 'who', 'only', 'job', 'find', 'take', 'back', 'organ', 'question', ""n't"", 'do', 'nicely', 'body', 'kills', 'process', 'Rotti', 'head', 'Repo', 'Man', 'Nathan', 'Wallace', 'fantastic', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'former', 'friend', 'now', 'slave', 'due', 'what', 'did', 'wife', 'Rotti', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'Marni', 'repo', 'Rotti', 'penance', 'crime', 'Nathan', 'daugther', 'Shiloh', 'sung', 'acted', 'fantastically', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'alum', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'due', 'questionable', 'blood', 'disease', 'insecurities', 'world', 'Shiloh', 'longs', 'outside', 'world', 'nightly', 'meets', 'Graverobber', 'experience', 'horrors', 'outside', 'world', 'Enter', 'Blind', 'Mag', 'played', 'incomparably', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Marni', 'best', 'friend', 'Shiloh', 'godmother', 'struggle', 'freedom', 'Geneco', 'Rotti', 'masterplan', 'leave', 'company', 'Shiloh', 'Nathan', 'secret', 'life', 'Repo', 'man', 'set', 'stage', 'bloody', 'heartwrenching', 'story', 'loss', 'redemption', 'choice', 'love', 'measure.Not', 'only', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'fantastic', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Infected', 'Zydrate', 'Anatomy', 'Started', 'Opera', 'S**t', 'roll', 'floor', 'pieces', 'Mark', 'Up', 'Thankless', 'Job', 'Bravi', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Chase', 'Morning', 'Gold', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'loved', 'so', 'Much', 'music', 'fantastic', 'so', 'original', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'kicks', 'there', 'serve', 'push', 'plot', 'forward.The', 'film', 'also', 'horror', 'good', 'bit', 'gore', 'ripped', 'out', 'hearts', 'disemboweled', 'torso', 'severed', 'heads', 'ripped', 'out', 'spinal', 'cords', 'gore', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'so', 'top', 'pull', 'plot', 'Thankless', 'Job', 'good', 'chuckle', 'acting', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'was', 'not', 'honored', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nom', 'very', 'least', 'portrayal', 'haunted', 'overprotective', 'father', 'heartwrenching', 'watch', 'singing', 'chops', 'as', 'well', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'captivating', 'watch', 'Rotti', 'Largo', 'damn', 'can', 'sing', 'song', 'Gold', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'well', 'cast', 'Shiloh', 'time', 'shine', 'infectious', 'sound', 'Infected', 'angry', 'Seventeen', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'who', 'truly', 'shines', 'was', 'unable', 'keep', 'eyes', 'was', 'beautiful', 'look', 'also', 'listen', 'Chase', 'Morning', 'Cromaggia', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'ANY', 'musical', 'wonder', 'being', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'noms.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'love', 'horror', 'watch', 'love', 'musicals', 'watch', 'love', 'different', 'original', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'things', 'should', 'still', 'watch', 'Chase', 'Morning', 'Yield', 'Nothing']",Repo The Genetic Opera

Adapted from a cult stage play bySaw IIman Darren Lynn Bousman, ""Repo!"" tries mightily to cover the same territory asThe Rocky Horror Picture Show, but misses the target. I really, really wanted to like this; it has all the elements for being amazing. After all, where else would you find a cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Paris Hilton, Sarah Brightman and Ogre fromSkinny Puppy?Yet for a rock opera, the music is the least interesting thing about the movie. There isn't a single song that leaps out at you, but seeing Spy Kid's Alex Vega belting ""Seventeen"" like Joan Jett is pretty cool, and the final ballad (""I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much"") has potential. The mass of the songs however, are one dimensional industrial rock and start bleeding into each other (pun somewhat intended).The bloody plot is that Rotti Largo (Sorvino) has saved the world from an epidemic of organ failures by creating GeneCo, a designer body parts company. Yet - as do most of the rich and powerful - he is not satisfied. He hates his children, ain't too crazy about the population in general and has just been informed that he's dying. There's a dirty secret that he has forced upon Dr Nathan (Tony Head) and his daughter. Even nastier, Rotti convinced the government that falling behind on your surgical payments can be...murder. He orchestrates his final revenge on all of them at the final performance of his ""Genetic Opera.""There are all the right elements for 100% coolness here, but the film just doesn't take advantage. There are no successful attempts to get the potential black humor to stick (save from the latest tired effort to deface Paris Hilton), and as previously noted, the songs are not particularly memorable. ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" seems so darned intent on becoming a midnight movie that it overshoots the target. It's one thing to be charmingly oddball, but ""Repo!"" shreiks LOOK AT ME!

1217440,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001MT7ZEW,trashcanman,"[6, 8]","What to say about ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"". Well, it's certainly different, I'll give it that. Picture this, if you will: a cinematic dystopia worthy ofBlade Runneron aThe Rocky Horror Picture Showbender where the gothed-out residents communicate only through song as though they are living in an endlessNightmare Before Christmasnumber.  Now imagine it is directed by the man who brought us 3 out of 5Sawflicks and features musical contributions from ex-Zombiebassist Blasko and Shawn ""Clown"" Crahan ofSlipknotamong many, many others and you'll have an inkling.  But wait, there's more!  Add Andrew Lloyd Webber's siren of choice Sarah Brightman and Paris Hilton to that mix. Weird enough for ya?  ""Repo"" is nothing if not bizarre and entertaining, but it is missing a few elements that keep it from reaching the lofty heights ofSweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetit could have attained with a little more polish.The premise is amazing. In the future, mankind is plagued with a rash of organ failures.  One man, Rotti Largo, devises a system where an infinite number of replacement organs can be produced and forms the GeneCo corporation to do so.  Payment plans are worked out and mankind is saved.  Except for the folks who can't pay their exorbinant bills, that is.  That's where the Repo Man comes in.  You see where this is going?  The organs are company property, so delinquent accounts get hunted down like dogs and the organs are taken back. Awesome, no?  This and several characters' backstories are given to us in a stylish narrated comic book form that serves the film well.  Cool points all around.Enter our cast.  Anthony Stewart Head ofBuffyfame is back in our lives and singing again as the twisted Repo Man trying to hold his life together while raising his 17 year old perpetually-ill daughter (Alexa Vega) by himself.  This man brings me much joy.  Co-creator Terrance Zdunich plays our guide to this twisted tale, known only as Graverobber.  Three guesses what it is he does in his spare time. Sarah Brightman lights up the screen as the indentured opera diva Blind Mag, who owes her creepy cyber-eyes to GeneCo.  Bill Moseley, Paris Hilton, and Nivek Ogre of the bandSkinny Puppyround out the cast as the three pathetic GeneCo heirs.  Not too shabby, eh?""Repo"" looks wonderful.  Visually arresting, dark and colorful, and just downright cool the look is.  There is some serious gore as the repossessions happen mostly onscreen and it is a hell of a treat to see ASH hack away at his victims with such psychotic glee. Even Hilton doesn't distract too much.  After all, she's essentially playing herself: a narcissistic plastic surgery addict billionaire heiress bee-yatch who wants to be a singer but whose only actual talent is skankyness.  Apparently, the director wanted nothing to do with her but was eventually ""charmed"" into casting her.  Do I really need to spell out what ""charmed"" means in Hollywoodspeak?  Anyhow, Brightman is surprisingly fantastic and Graverobber is just plain cool.  A lot to like about this film.On to the music.  It rides the line between contemporary mainstream musical and heavy metal opera and it rides it well.  But the fact that there is no dialogue that is not sung eventually becomes an annoyance.  Watching a father and daughter argue while singing when there isn't even any music playing can never be uncheesy.  I realize that real operas are entirely sung, but in this case it doesn't always work in the film's favor.  The songs themselves are typically filled with wonderfully macabre lyrics, rockin' grooves, and flashes of pure brilliance, but are often broken up by more sing-song dialogue when you just wish it would keep on rocking. And there are certainly a few clunkers on the soundtrack.  ""Seventeen"" is meant to be punk, but comes off as very Avril Lavigne-ish.  In fact, the scene was only salvaged for me by a surprise cameo from ex-Runaway Joan Jett.  The end gets a bit sappy as well, which is hard to do when the set is filled with dead bodies.2008 was a hell of a year for musical fans of the bizarre variety.  Between this,Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, and Sweeney Todd, we have had much to be thankful for.  ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" is the weakest of the three, but strikes a very different chord.  One that I daresay has never been struck before and for that, it deserves much praise.  But on the other hand, I feel that the weak link in this is what should always be the strong point of a musical and that is the songs.  I LOVE the ideas presented; the metal guitars, twisted humor, and dark presentation, but the music itself really needed some professional smoothing-out and often fails to gather enough momentum to thrill when it should.  The story also fails to live up to the strength of the premise.  These are the reasons why Repo will likely not be regarded as a classic like Sweeney Todd, Nightmare Before Christmas, Rocky Horror Picture Show, or even the musical episode of Buffy ""Once More With Feeling"".  It's great fun and deserves a shot from any rock and horror fan, but it feels like it could have been so much better.3 1/2 stars rounded up for going where no musical has gone before.",4,The best

If you liked any three of the four listed above, RUN to your nearest video store.  You've got an unforgettable 90 minutes ahead of you.  If not, keep reading- there may be hope yet.Repo: The Genetic Opera is classed as a rock opera.  Like a normal opera, there is little to no spoken dialogue.  The music, however combines the melodic and lyrical cleverness of Sweeney Todd with the industrial riffs of Korn or Nine Inch Nails.  If you like the aforementioned bands, Within Temptation, Nightwish, Therion, or even Sarah Brightman, you can stop reading and hit one click purchase.  More time potentially saved....So you're still reading...well, a guy tries.  Repo features a fantastic cast of actors and actresses.  Anthony Head (Buffy's Watcher), Alexa Vega (from Spykids, but you won't recognize her now), Paul Sorvino, Sarah Brightman, and Paris Hilton will all surprise you (well maybe not Sarah- you knew she could sing, right?).Visually, the film is a tour-de-force.  The sets and costumes all come across as the labor of love that they are. I mentioned Saw above, however, because the film's premise is inherently gory.The story is both engaging and surprising, and the writers melded the plot so seamlessly with the music that the resulting synthesis is stunning.My one and only personal problem with the film is that it descends into self-indulgent raunchiness a couple of times.  It disturbs the flow of the film.  The deleted scenes indicate that a good bit of this was cut, but the minute or so that survives is unfortunate.That one problem won't be an issue for most people that get their hands on this film, and it does little to deter my nearly unreserved admiration for and recommendation of the film.  It attempts something new and daring: the synthesis of the opera concept with the industrial sound and the theatricality of Phantom.Finally, let me make a plea.  If you like the film or think you'll like it, buy it.  All people involved would like to make a sequel or a prequel, but the movie opened in very few theaters.
