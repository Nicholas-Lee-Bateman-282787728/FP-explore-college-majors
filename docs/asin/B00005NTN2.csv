670090,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005NTN2,A. Estes,"[2, 2]","The seventh and final (thank you) entry in the seemingly never-ending original ""Children of the Corn"" franchise finds those pesky little rascals stalking (stalking, get it?) a woman whose grandmother has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. It turns out that the decrepit building where-in granny lives was once the grounds of the original children of the corn and through the course of the film, the residents of said building find themselves at the mercy of the sadistic children and their thousand yard stare.Director Guy Magar (whose career was apparently killed with the making of this movie) gives the film a slick look and feel, but the end result can't help but feel like the lame direct-to-video fare it was always meant to be. On the upside, this installment is less insulting to the intelligence than previous entries in the franchise, and seeing as how the original ""Children of the Corn"" wasn't that fantastic from the get-go, it's fair to say that the bar was never that high to begin with.80's cult icon Michael Ironside has a bit as a priest in the film, but his moments are so sparse that his presence is barely felt, and incidentally, his character serves no real narrative purpose. Even still, it's nice to see the guy getting work. Claudette Mink gives us someone to root for as the main character, and actually turns in a pretty decent performance. The effects are painfully bad, however, and the deaths in particular are bloodless and -- save for the stripper in the bath-tub scene -- uninteresting. Those who have already wandered through the previous rows of corn (read: prior sequels) could do much, worse though. Even though there are no revelations in this corny sequel, it still manages to kill an hour and a half rather painlessly.Followed by a mediocre made-for-TVremake.",3,No Revelations in this Corny Sequel.

670091,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005NTN2,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Alright, I believe enough is finally enough.  Children of the Corn: Revelation is extremely disappointing.  Not only are the earlier movies in the series drastically superior in every conceivable way, but this film completely fails to offer anything in regards to actual scares, surprises and storyline continuation.The evil children in this film basically consist of a little boy and a little girl who have a fascination with video games (because they're always playing them every single chance they get, whether it be arcade machines or handheld systems).  That's a problem right there- that's not frightening at *all!*Over the years I've seen enough children become miserable, ticked off and throw hissy fits while playing video or board games, so this is nothing I haven't already seen before, and including such a thing in a horror film (a respectable series, no less) is downright insulting.  Obviously the writers were trying to make Children of the Corn seem more modern by including these video game segments, but that's not necessarily a GOOD thing in my book.The storyline is about a young and attractive women who goes out and searches for her grandmother around a small town surrounded by, yes, cornfields.  You already knew that... then again, it wouldn't have surprised me if the writers had abandoned cornfields in favor of something else.  Luckily the film isn't *that* disappointing, haha.Basically, because the woman spends her entire time looking for her grandmother, the suspense we've come to love from previous Children of the Corn films has been exchanged for an above average detective mystery.  Once again, it's not that appealing.The acting is questionable throughout the film, making it feel more like a movie intended for the Lifetime Movie Network.  Seriously, the writing feels like it was intended for those who were too afraid of the other Children of the Corn movies because it's very light in the actual spookiness overall.  The only good scene is the prostitute who gets killed in a bathtub.The movie is also extremely short at just over 80 minutes, not accomplishing anything worth noting.  Not a movie for those who admire the early Children of the Corn movies, that's a fact.  I recommend to skip it.",2,pretty terrible,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,2239,"['Alright', 'believe', 'enough', 'finally', 'enough', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Revelation', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'earlier', 'movies', 'series', 'drastically', 'superior', 'conceivable', 'way', 'film', 'completely', 'offer', 'anything', 'regards', 'actual', 'scares', 'surprises', 'storyline', 'continuation.The', 'evil', 'children', 'film', 'basically', 'consist', 'little', 'boy', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'have', 'fascination', 'video', 'games', ""'re"", 'always', 'playing', 'single', 'chance', 'get', 'be', 'arcade', 'machines', 'handheld', 'systems', 'problem', 'right', 'there-', 'not', 'frightening', '*all', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'children', 'become', 'miserable', 'ticked', 'off', 'throw', 'hissy', 'fits', 'playing', 'video', 'board', 'games', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'including', 'such', 'thing', 'horror', 'film', 'respectable', 'series', 'less', 'downright', 'insulting', 'Obviously', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'Children', 'Corn', 'seem', 'more', 'modern', 'including', 'video', 'game', 'segments', 'not', 'necessarily', 'GOOD', 'thing', 'book.The', 'storyline', 'young', 'attractive', 'women', 'who', 'out', 'searches', 'grandmother', 'small', 'town', 'surrounded', 'yes', 'cornfields', 'already', 'knew', 'then', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprised', 'writers', 'had', 'abandoned', 'cornfields', 'favor', 'something', 'else', 'Luckily', 'film', ""n't"", '*that*', 'disappointing', 'haha.Basically', 'woman', 'entire', 'time', 'looking', 'grandmother', 'suspense', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'previous', 'Children', 'Corn', 'films', 'been', 'exchanged', 'above', 'average', 'detective', 'mystery', 'Once', 'again', 'not', 'appealing.The', 'acting', 'questionable', 'film', 'making', 'feel', 'more', 'movie', 'intended', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'Seriously', 'writing', 'feels', 'was', 'intended', 'who', 'were', 'too', 'afraid', 'other', 'Children', 'Corn', 'movies', 'very', 'light', 'actual', 'spookiness', 'overall', 'only', 'good', 'scene', 'prostitute', 'who', 'killed', 'bathtub.The', 'movie', 'also', 'extremely', 'short', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'not', 'accomplishing', 'anything', 'worth', 'noting', 'Not', 'movie', 'who', 'admire', 'early', 'Children', 'Corn', 'movies', 'fact', 'recommend', 'skip']",N/A

670094,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B00005NTN2,David Girod,"[0, 0]","While it seems that most of the films in this series have taken liberties with Stephen King's original tale, I would say that at a minimum they kept at least a passing reference to the original short story. &#34;Revelation&#34; abandons King's story almost completely, and when the events of the original tale are made (in a brief cameo by Michael Ironside) you can't help but wonder if it's simply tacked on.A brief synopsis - A woman comes a run down apartment complex (in the middle of a cornfield??) looking for her grandmother. The grandmother had been acting strange before she disappeared; selling her home an moving into a condemned building and avoiding contact with her family. The grand daughter comes to the run down building, meets a bunch of weird residents, and some odd kids hanging around. After the police refuse to help, the young woman decides to hang around and see if her grandmother will come home. She soon learns that her grandmother was the sole survivor of a horrible fire when she was a small girl. The fire killed a bunch of kids at a tent revival where a boy preacher held his sermons. The kids begin picking off the other tenants of the building as our heroine tries to solve the mystery of the missing granny.I honestly don't know why the filmmakers wanted to tie this film into the &#34;Children of the Corn&#34; series? You can tell that they were more interested in making a haunted hotel type of film. Everything here is so pedestrian, it's just boring. They try to create scares by having the camera focus on a kid standing in the fog...and then the music blares and they move the camera closer while the kid scowls?? Michael Ironside is completely wasted, with only about 3 minutes of screentime, he appears briefly to try and tie this movie into the events that happened in Gatlin, but his scenes just feel like last minute fill-in stuff.I will say this is the first time in the series that we actually get killer corn...or at least the corn tries to kill people? And this is the first film in the series with nudity which kind of surprised me.

670095,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B00005NTN2,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[1, 1]","Children of the Corn (CotC) scripts may have never been literary masterpieces, but for some reason, CotC 6 and 7 have scripts that seem like very early drafts--or even as if they were only partially complete and the directors decided to just wing it for the rest of the film.  It's a shame because both films otherwise had the potential to be quite good.For CotC7, a relatively oblique path was chosen (probably to the chagrin of those predisposed to purism)--it's more or less a ""haunted house"" film.  This was promising to me, as by the time you get around to the seventh entry in a series, a change of pace is refreshing, and haunted house (really, haunted anything) films are probably my favorite horror subgenre.For the first 45 minutes or so, CotC7 was satisfying to me.  In fact, for the first 10 or 15 minutes, it seemed reminiscent of the more recent 1408 (2007), which I loved.  It had a good setting, a good premise, good atmosphere, creepy scenes, a bit of eye candy, and even a bit of odd humor.But right about the halfway mark, it starts to unravel.  Mysterious characters (many supernatural) are never explained, and they keep growing in number.  A couple scenes featured supernatural characters that don't cohere with the rest of the film--for example, one has a zombie or adult burn victim.  The film starts getting choppy, and it begins to feel more like a series of pointless and disconnected ""scary"" set-pieces.Worse, there was a stable of interesting human characters who were never explored enough--we're just teased with them and then they're usually quickly dispatched with relatively generic horror film deaths.  And the crux of the story--Jamie's (Claudette Mink) missing grandmother--remains murky through the end.  The biggest tragedy is that the ball was dropped.  With just a bit more work on the script--another two or three drafts, maybe--this could have been one of the better entries of this uneven series.",2,Children of the Condo,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,1940,"['Children', 'Corn', 'CotC', 'scripts', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'literary', 'masterpieces', 'reason', 'CotC', '6', '7', 'have', 'scripts', 'seem', 'very', 'early', 'drafts', 'even', 'were', 'only', 'partially', 'complete', 'directors', 'decided', 'just', 'wing', 'rest', 'film', 'shame', 'films', 'otherwise', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'quite', 'good.For', 'CotC7', 'relatively', 'oblique', 'path', 'was', 'chosen', 'probably', 'chagrin', 'predisposed', 'purism', 'more', 'less', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'was', 'promising', 'time', 'get', 'seventh', 'entry', 'series', 'change', 'pace', 'refreshing', 'haunted', 'house', 'really', 'haunted', 'anything', 'films', 'are', 'probably', 'favorite', 'horror', 'subgenre.For', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'CotC7', 'was', 'satisfying', 'fact', 'first', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'reminiscent', 'more', 'recent', '1408', '2007', 'loved', 'had', 'good', 'setting', 'good', 'premise', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'bit', 'eye', 'candy', 'even', 'bit', 'odd', 'humor.But', 'right', 'halfway', 'mark', 'unravel', 'Mysterious', 'characters', 'many', 'supernatural', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'keep', 'growing', 'number', 'couple', 'scenes', 'featured', 'supernatural', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'cohere', 'rest', 'film', 'example', 'one', 'zombie', 'adult', 'burn', 'victim', 'film', 'getting', 'choppy', 'feel', 'more', 'series', 'pointless', 'disconnected', 'scary', 'set-pieces.Worse', 'was', 'stable', 'interesting', 'human', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'explored', 'enough', ""'re"", 'just', 'teased', 'then', ""'re"", 'usually', 'quickly', 'dispatched', 'relatively', 'generic', 'horror', 'film', 'deaths', 'crux', 'story', 'Jamie', 'Claudette', 'Mink', 'missing', 'grandmother', 'murky', 'end', 'biggest', 'tragedy', 'ball', 'was', 'dropped', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'work', 'script', 'two', 'three', 'drafts', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'uneven', 'series']",N/A

That said, this film is thoroughly mediocre, but, again, after those last two flicks mediocre is looking pretty good.  The plot is your standard CotC rehash, and it is way light on the gore, not that most of these films were usually very gory, but it's a more involving and generally quite nice looking film.  Unlike in the previous two entries, one gets the impression that the director actually cared about the film, and tried to make it be good.  This films is probably the slickest, sharpest film in the series, and it has some nice creepy looking locales and a lot of fine atmospheric lighting.  Quite a bit of colored lighting too, one gets the impression that the director may be an Argento or Bava fan. (Note the pulsing green light, in particular.  Very Argento-esque.)  Still, after a relatively effective buildup the ending is more anemic than usual.  Again, there is no real gore to speak of, which is liable to kill the climax of any CotC film.  Also, it does have some really, really lame CG effects.  However, there is a scene where a chick gets attacked by a bunch of corn stalks while taking a bath.  That was pretty amusing.  Also, Michael Ironside has a very small role.  He doesn't seem to care at all, but it's still kinda fun for him to show up.  Dialogue and plot are, as usual, minimal and unimpressive, but whaddya expect with a CotC film, particularly the seventh one.Anyway, I was amused.

He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.""Children of the Corn 7: Revelation"" is apparently the end of the road (row?) for one of the most unlikely horror film franchises in history. Once again, another hapless female falls prey to the malevolent corn cult and its evil machinations. On this outing the individual in question is Jamie (Claudette Mink), a young professional who heads to the Midwest to check up on her ailing grandmother at Hampton Arms, a condemned structure housing a host of miscreants and other assorted characters. Grandma disappears immediately before Jamie arrives at the building, so the young lady decides to stay in the old woman's apartment in an effort to discover the causes of the disappearance. Jamie runs into a lot of opposition to her various inquiries right from the start. Armbrister (Kyle Cassidy), a cop at the police station, initially doesn't take her missing person's report seriously. A visit to a few of the neighbors in the building doesn't pan out at first, either. The resident stoner Jerry (Troy Yorke) is so out of it an a regular basis that he couldn't tell Jamie what time it is let alone what happened to her grandmother. Then there is Tiffany (Crystal Lowe), a woman who works at the local gentleman's club, who is friendly but generally unable to help. An old guy rolling around the hallways in a wheelchair shouting incoherently is, sad to say, just as unhelpful.Needless to say, events occur that soon shed light on Jamie's quandary. She glimpses silent kids moving around the building and the neighborhood, children who never say a word but just look ominous. She also hears children laughing when no one is around. Too, the discovery of a picture in grandma's bible offers a cryptic clue, as does the presence of a bizarre room in the basement filled with corn guarded by a strange man with guns and a heart condition. Then tenants start perishing: Jerry takes a header off the roof and Tiffany takes a final, fatal bath. The children even silence wheelchair guy. As a way to announce that a tenant has moved to the other side, cornhusk wreathes appear on apartment doors. What the heck is going on at Hampton Arms? Thanks to Jamie and Armbrister, a story emerges that provides a few answers. Some seventy-five years ago or so, a corn cult lead by child preacher Abel (Sean Smith) perished in a huge tent fire on the ground that is now Hampton Arms. Jamie's grandmother was the only survivor, and it appears that all of these children are actually ghosts come back to claim grandma's soul. Or something like that. Now Jamie and the cop must try to destroy the building in order to send these corn worshipping kiddies back to who knows where.This movie doesn't make much sense. I'll buy the idea of the corn cult coming back to claim Jamie's grandmother, but I don't understand why they felt the need to kill all of the other residents. Why do such a thing? Hampton Arms is a condemned building that will fall under the wrecking ball at some point in the future, so why worry about who lives there? Are these ghosts operating under a strict timetable that requires them to clear the area RIGHT NOW or face some supernatural punishment? For that matter, Jamie's grandmother wasn't exactly a spring chicken. Why not just wait for her to pass away from natural causes and then reclaim her soul? The answer is probably an easy one: the script says the kids have to come back and kill so the movie can show gory murders. Problem is, the movie isn't that gory. The only memorable scene involves a storekeeper's head sitting in a freezer. This movie spends more time building the characters and trying to imbue the picture with creepy atmosphere, with decidedly mixed results. ""Revelation"" does give us Michael Ironside in what amounts to a totally useless cameo as a priest investigating the corn cult.Extras on the disc consist of trailers for parts four, five, and six of ""Children of the Corn,"" ""Mimic 2,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: H20,"" and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers."" Perhaps ""Revelation"" is a fitting end to the ""Children of the Corn"" franchise, but the only revelation I received after watching this film is that the whole series should have ended much sooner. I wondered as the credits rolled if this was truly the end. Never say never when dealing with a story from Stephen King.",2,Is this truly the end?,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,5559,"['other', 'author', 'recent', 'memory', 'had', 'much', 'consistent',
