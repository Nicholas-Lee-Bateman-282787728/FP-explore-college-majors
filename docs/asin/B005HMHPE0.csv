1461111,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B005HMHPE0,B. Martin,"[3, 3]","The train wreck that is Hank Moody's life continues to hurl ahead at full speed in the fourth season of Showtime's raunchfest, Californication.  The latest installment in the chronicles of the deeply flawed author finds him dealing with statutory rape charges stemming from an encounter with Mia way back in the first season.  One of the great things about this show has always been how its characters are haunted by their past transgressions and its good to see the series getting back to exploring this theme after the largely consequence free romp that was season three.The twelve episodes of this latest season are wildly entertaining and often jaw droppingly vulgar (see the story arc involving Charlie and his realtor for further proof of this), but they are also frequently shot through with sobering flashes of sadness, regret and heartache.  For every fling that Hank engages in and every bit of booze and drugs he consumes, a part of the man he desperately wants to be seems to drift farther away.  What's most tragic about this is that Hank knows it's happening but seems unable or unwilling to make the changes needed to become the person he truly wants to be.Yet Californication continues to brilliantly convey these themes in the guise of a series that is loose, fun and endlessly amusing.  It conveys an effortless sense of cool and good times, even though things are falling apart beneath the surface.  Just like Hank Moody himself.",4,The Downward Spiral Continues,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1448,"['train', 'wreck', 'Hank', 'Moody', 'life', 'hurl', 'ahead', 'full', 'speed', 'fourth', 'season', 'Showtime', 'raunchfest', 'Californication', 'latest', 'installment', 'chronicles', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'author', 'dealing', 'statutory', 'rape', 'charges', 'stemming', 'encounter', 'Mia', 'way', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'haunted', 'past', 'transgressions', 'good', 'see', 'series', 'getting', 'back', 'exploring', 'theme', 'largely', 'consequence', 'free', 'romp', 'was', 'season', 'three.The', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'latest', 'season', 'are', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'often', 'jaw', 'droppingly', 'vulgar', 'see', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'Charlie', 'realtor', 'further', 'proof', 'are', 'also', 'frequently', 'shot', 'sobering', 'flashes', 'sadness', 'regret', 'heartache', 'fling', 'Hank', 'bit', 'booze', 'drugs', 'part', 'man', 'desperately', 'be', 'drift', 'farther', 'away', 'What', 'most', 'tragic', 'Hank', 'happening', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'make', 'changes', 'needed', 'become', 'person', 'be.Yet', 'Californication', 'brilliantly', 'convey', 'themes', 'guise', 'series', 'loose', 'fun', 'endlessly', 'amusing', 'conveys', 'effortless', 'sense', 'cool', 'good', 'times', 'even', 'things', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'surface', 'Just', 'Hank', 'Moody']",Californication: Season 4

1461115,A3RVSS07VEXQVE,B005HMHPE0,Joseph Landes,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching Season 4 of Californication and although in my opinion not the best of the seasons, it is still filled with many laugh-out loud, outrageous moments that will keep die-hard Hank Moody fans begging for a 5th season. The 4th Season is primarily focused on Hank battling against accusations of rape pending from his escapade with Mia. His best friend and agent Charlie is getting along after being separated from Marci and is attempting to sleep with 100 women before he dies---problem is he is only up to #11 when the show starts. As the season progresses, you start to feel as if the show is getting slightly old and that if it is to continue it may need a radical makeover. The development of Hank's character as tragic starts to get tired, his moments of self-reflection old, and you continuously wait for some sort of big ""bang"" to happen to jolt you and Hank and the rest of the characters out of a bit of a slumber. Without giving away the ending of Season 4, I will say that it is not as dramatic as the previous seasons although does involve a ride into the sunset by both Hank and his ex-wife and daughter---although not in the same car.

Sure, there are some hysterical moments in Season 4 (most of which involve Rob Lowe), but the big problem with this show is that there are quickly becoming fewer and fewer reasons to like the character of Hank Moody. In this season, Hank faces statutory rape charges, but because of the situation, it really isn't his fault and viewers don't hate him for what happened with Mia. However, his constant drunkenness, lack of concern for his teenage daughter, constant couplings with less than admirable women, and general inadequateness make it very hard to feel sorry for this guy.
