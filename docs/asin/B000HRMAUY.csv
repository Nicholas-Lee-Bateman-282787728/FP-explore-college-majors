Helen Mirren made the movie for me.  She commanded every scene she was in.  Cuba Gooding Jr. did a nice job considering the dialog (or lack thereof) he was given.The premise is loadedd with possibilities.  An assassin kills her partner and takes in his child son, who in turn becomes her partner - and more.  Oh, the possibilities..... not in this movie.  They are hired to kill a mobster's (Stephen Dorf) wife, but seeing she is pregnant, they spare her and take her in and help her raise her child.  Obviously, life isn't going to be a cake walk for these folks.  Eventually the situation blows up in the faces of all involved.It's how the story became what it was that made this only a so-so movie.  While having some interesting characters on one hand, the other hand is loaded with Hollywood cliches.  An overweight, ghetto-speaking, nurse that wears a uniform that barely covers her rear, a doctor whose actions make no sense, and a mobster that is so over the top that it turns the movie into a fairy tale.  People are shot as if it's no big deal to cover up.  It's how these secondary characters talk and interact that makes this movie lose its credibility.  Sometimes the bad guys have to be smart too.By the end, any sane person has lost faith in the story.  In fact, the whole problem the movie is based on could have easily been solved by assassinating the mobster.  No having to live on the run or in hiding.  Shadowboxer loosly reminds me of a much better film with a similar subject,The Professional.  I was hoping to find elements of that movie in a more dramatic fashion.

There was great buzz surrounding this film despite the fact that it wasn't a huge blockbuster in theaters. One thing for sure, if you missed this film during it's theatrical run you won't want to miss it on DVD.Cuba Gooding Jr. gets gangsta as he stars as Mikey. Mikey is hit man who works with his much older partner Rose. Early in the film they are performing a hit when they discover that one of the intended victims is not only pregnant--but due to give birth any second. Rose is now old and she is sick and her heart is softening. She orders Mikey not to go through with the hit.This is when things get a little cloudy judgment wise. Mikey and Rose decide to rescue the woman whose husband wants her dead and look out for her and her new son. They enlist a local doctor who has ties to the same crime syndicate that had ordered the hit on the woman to perform a checkup on the new mother and child. The doctor is involved in a romantic relationship with a nurse (Mo'Nique) with a drug problem and a nasty jealous streak.Mikey, Rose and the new mother and child settle into a life in the country. Mikey continues to go into the city to complete hits. Despite his non traditional job, Mikey has other demons that he is dealing with, one being a very complicated and intimate relationship with Rose. Their relationship will have viewers wondering just whether Rose and Mikey are involved in a familial relationship or a romantic one.Monique and Macy Gray have small roles in the film. The primary stars of the film are Cuba Gooding Jr., Helen Mirren and Vanessa Ferlito.Shadowboxer is a very violent movie.

One wonders why such enormously gifted actors such as Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding, Jr. ever accepted roles if they read the script beforehand.A very mature and cancer-ridden Rose (Helen Mirren, who can truly make a silk purse out of a sow's ear!) is a professional assassin who has raised Mikey (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) to be her co-assassin as well as her very young lover.  The two function well as a team and succeed in making a handsome living by killing people to whom they are assigned by  a wheelchair-ridden broker.  But when one of the marks is big time crime boss Clayton (Stephen Dorff at his most buff to date, eye candy persona) and his wife Vickie (Vanessa Ferlito), all goes well until Rose faces the problem that Vickie is pregnant, a fact that seems to create a sense of guilt and loss and causes her not only to spare her and also to deliver the male child.  After calling in a corrupt doctor Dr. Don (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and is lover/nurse Precious (Mo'Nique) to help them out, Rose and Mikey harbor the new mother and child and sequester themselves to raise the child, a life style that allows Mikey to continue his assassin jobs while Rose finds happiness raising the young boy.  But of course eventually the evil Clayton disrupts the flow of goodwill, gains information from the Precious after an adulterous office tryst, and it is face to face between Clayton and his wife and son and Rose and Mikey.  The ending defies sharing, not only because it would mar the viewer's watching, but it borders on surrealistic bizarre images that are of questionable taste.During all of this convoluted story we are given flashbacks that attempt to fill in the interstices in the plot: Mikey's relationship to his father, his first killing, Rose's introduction into crime etc.  Granted there are some moments of quiet and beauty in all of this mess, but the true reason for sitting through it is the always satisfying presence of Helen Mirren (who actually gets us to believe her preposterous character and motivation) and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who needs to change agents to get roles more important and conducive to his gifts).  With so many fine stories waiting to be made into film one wonders why drivel such as this makes it to the screen on time!

The plot focuses on a couple of professional assassins (played by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Helen Mirren) and the world of crime in which they operate. The duo accepts the task of killing a crime boss' wife, only to discover that the intended mark is pregnant. This revelation is only the first in a series of unexpected twists and discoveries leading to a graphically violent climax. Movie villian Stephen Dorff gives a brutal turn as the boss who hires the duo. This film is hard to describe because it's not just a crime story.  The storytelling is fresh and engaging. There is as much sensuality as their is violence in the film. If you are a fan of offbeat artsy crime adventures like The Limey, Formula 51 or Pulp Fiction, this film will definitely find a place in your heart.

It has everything going for it including good directing (Lee Daniels) and fine acting led by Helen Mirren (Rose) and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Mikey. These two are professional killers, but, once again, not your everyday killers. Rose, who is white, has been the lover of Mikey's father, a black man. She has raised Mikey as her son/servant/lover. Business is as usual until Rose, who knows she is terminally ill with cancer, decides to save the woman she and Mikey have been hired to kill after she helps the woman deliver a child. This unlikely quartet then makes a life-- sort of-- for themselves.This film contains a lot of nudity (though not gratuitous) and even more violence. There are also many tender, touching moments, however; and it is gratifying to see Mikey gradually come into his role as a father for the child he and Rose rescue.Mr. Daniels is quite the visual artist as he juxtaposes religious imagery-- there are crosses everywhere including one around the evil Clayton's neck-- with the business at hand, murder for hire.

1015587,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000HRMAUY,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. It contains a great deal of graphic violence and sex and it's not as bad as it seems. However, the scenes are shot wonderfully and the acting on here might surprise you. It is over-the-top and surreal and yes more than a bit mad which turned out to be an interesting film. In here we have a contract killer by the name of Rose (Helen Mirren) who is diagnosed with cancer; she elects to continue with her work, aided by her stepson/lover Mikey (Cuba Gooding Jr.). When on a routine assignment, Rose balks at killing the pregnant wife (Vanessa Ferlito) of a gangster (Stephen Dorff), instead hiding her away as the three raise the child in seclusion. As the years pass, the frosty and distant Mikey becomes a father figure to the child, which endangers his life and profession when his past comes looking for revenge. The way ""Shadowboxer"" moves, you can understand that it's a film that wants to set itself apart from the routine hit man cinema agenda. Director Lee Daniels is hunting for anything that will stand out to the audience, so he goes to a very unexpected place: sex.I had good time watching this film and thought that Helen Mirren, Gordon Levitt Hewitt along with Cuba Gooding Jr. were amazing. I really have to hand it to Cuba Gooding Jr. because he turned his character into a solid performance and delivered his role strongly, silently, and a subtle way. Few people will ever get to see the commitment he made to this part, but I saw it and salute him. He's been down on his luck, and I hope he starts to draw better hands into these types of films because comedy doesn't suite him. The only real negative is that the dialogue because it isn't very original or punchy. Gooding almost never speaks, and the women are given rather mundane verbal work. It takes a great director to pull off what could be a creepy relationship between a mother and son an turn it into a tender love story. The films somber overtone does not slow the action down in he slightest but you can obviously see that it had room for improvement.Stephen Dorff character was one piece of work and is a completely unbelievable one-dimensional villain, but the film works for me, despite or because of those elements. As the Times pointed out, the extravagant action may impress you or make you laugh, but it won't bore you, and it's difficult to predict. Plus, for all you Macy Gray fans, it is always good to see her on screen as she adds a bit of levity to this dramatic tale. Furthermore the film's emotional manipulation is powerful and skillful enough to generate the responses it hopes for. This is the first film for director Lee Daniels, but he shows complete command of the material, and has no problem shifting from family drama to outrageous black comedy to lurid sex and violence. His musical selections include such diverse elements as tangos, waltzes, hip-hop, and romantic faux-classical. His sets are opulent and gaudy. His production values are lush, and his shooting locations are chosen with an eye to the off-kilter. And the man's love for Philadelphia and its 'burbs is evident in every frame.

Well, in Idaho anyway. I heard of the movie when Jay Leno and Richard Roeper reviewed it; Leno liked it, Roeper didn't. But it looked like an interesting movie. Watching it, I realized that it's actually a really good movie. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good and I'm surprised it didn't get more attention. There seems to be a small theme in this film; Odd couples. First there's Cuba Gooding Jr. and Helen Mirren. Then there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Mo'nique. When I heard that, I didn't know if I'd buy those relationships or not...But it makes sense in a film like this. Mirren plays Rose, a hitwoman who's been diagnosed with cancer. Cuba plays Mikey, her lover and partner. Mikey is a far cry from the hitmen we see in The Matador and The Whole Nine Yards. Mikey is cold as stone, humorless and never wearing a smile. The villain is Clayton Mayfield (Stephen Dorff, 'Blade'), a rich guy who's established as being evil early on. In the beginning of the film, he's got a man strapped to a pool table. The man is being accused of having sex with Clayton's pregnant girlfriend Vicki (Vanessa Ferlito, who bears a slight resemblance to Angelina Jolie); Clayton shoves an 8-ball in his mouth and then shoves a pool stick in his...Well, you get the idea. Rose and Mikey are hired by Clayton (not face-to-face, but through a mysterious man in a wheelchair who hands Mikey the contract) to kill his live-in comrades and his girlfriend. When Rose and Mikey arrive, they kill everyone but Rose can't bring herself to kill the helpless pregnant woman. When Vicki's water breaks, Rose delivers the baby and helps Vicki and her baby escape. To Mikey, it's a job. He's disappointed that Rose didn't complete hers, but he loves Rose and goes along with whatever she says. So does everyone else it appears including Dr. Don (Levitt), who plays both sides of the field helping Rose and Clayton. Gordon-Levitt is, I believe, between 27 and 28 years old. This is plenty of time to become a doctor, but he's so young looking I didn't really buy it. His performance is good, it's really good, but he just looks to young. His girlfriend Prescious is played by Mo'Nique, who blends some great bits of humor into a serious role. Anyway, Mikey, Rose, Vicki, and the baby move into the country; Rose quits the business, but Mikey continues working to support them all. There's a lot more to the plot, but I'll let you see it. I had read the synopsis of the film before seeing it and the way it's made it something you wouldn't quite expect. It's filmed in a surreal, brooding way. It's almost dreamlike. The performances are all great and the movie is entertaining; It's biggest flaw is that the ending seems rush. The events of the ending are thrown together and executed so quickly, it's almost like reading an abridged novel. But the symbolic ending is actually pretty damn good. If you've read about this film than you know there's a lot of sexual content. There is, but it's pretty tame. There's only two brief scenes of female nudity and (for females) you get to see a full frontal of Dorff and the backside of Gooding Jr. This is a really good, underrated film.

I love movies about hitmen and the stories of their lives. The movie is about two contract killers Mikey (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Rose (Helen Mirren). Mikey is Roses stepson but they are now in another type of relationship, a closer one. They are contracted to take out the wife of a crazy mob boss named Clayton (Stephen Dorff). When they arrive to do the job they find that the woman is with child and start to have complications. For some reason Rose would like to keep the woman and her unborn child and protect her. When Clayton finds this out he immediately starts a hunt for the three but not before they start a new family life.This is not the first Lee Daniels film I've heard of but definitely the first I've seen. Now lee is good but I do think he tends to overdue it in his movies with excessive weirdness or something like that. He starts the movie out with an interesting scene to get you into the movie and then throw something crazy in there that I can't really explain. To me it takes away from the movie and it just seems like he puts it in there just to put it in there. You'll see what I mean when you watch it. This movie could have been so much better had he focused on exposing Cuba Gooding Jr.'s feelings a little more. He was completely hollow for a great portion of the film and it took a lot away from his character and his performance. If he gave Gooding a little more to work with I think this could've been one of his best films to date.The rest of the cast was off and a little out of touch with these characters. Mo'Nique was cool but Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Dr. Don seemed fake especially the relationship between the two. Stephen Dorff was definitely off and too crazy. The guys script had to be nothing but cussing. I watch plenty of movies with cussing and I don't care but when you say 4 cusses to 1 normal word in every sentence it's just too much. The story was ok and the picture was great plus I love the ending a lot. It leaves room for a sequel but who knows if there will be one. Not everyone will like Shadowboxer but some will.

It's also fast paced and exciting and, even though the plot is absolutely preposterous, I had no trouble following the twists and turns and constant surprises.  It packs a lot of wallop into its 90 minutes of pure wild story, and I was involved and intrigued the entire time.Hats off to a great cast too!  Helen Mirrin, cast as Rose,  is paired with Cuba Gooding  cast as Mikey,  as the most unlikely couple in the world.  Not only is the relationship interracial, but she is 22 years older than him and he is her stepson.  The screen sizzles with their romantic interludes and there is no doubt they love each other.  To top off the outrageousness of it all, they make their living as contract killers.  She just happens to be dying of cancer though and has agreed to do one last job.Enter the crime lord bad guy played by Stephen Dorff who we first see torturing a man he thinks is having an affair with his wife.  His wife, played by Vanessa Ferlito, is the one that he wants murdered and of course it is Rose and Mikey who he hires to do the job.  Rose, dressed in black, enters the wife's bedroom with the intent of killing her.  But the wife just happens to be 9 months pregnant and Helen and Mikey wind up delivering the baby and running away with the mother and child to hide.  That's the basis of the plot and it gets even more outrageous as the story goes on.  I loved it because it was different and that it dared to show one particular explicit coupling of Rose and Mike that will long be remembered.This whole film is not believable.

They've been partners since he was a kid and she was the woman who partnered with his father on professional killings.  She taught him everything about the art of killing.  Clayton (Stephen Dorff), the crime boss who hired them to kill his wife and unborn child, is a truly psychotic animal.  The problem is, Rose is dying of cancer and wants to leave something good behind.  And she believes it will be this child.Lee Daniels directed the movie as well as MONSTER'S BALL, another ethnic thriller that slammed audiences with sex and violence and gave Halle Berry the chance to win an Academy Award.  Helen Mirren starred in the PRIME SUSPECT seasons on the BBC as well as THE QUEEN.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. has been in several movies, including JERRY MAGUIRE, MEN OF HONOR, and SNOW DOGS.  Stephen Dorff starred in BLADE and COVERT ONE:  THE HADES FACTOR.The film showcased developing characters and a telescoped plot that spread over years.  Viewers are forced to read between the lines on some of the continuity, and to make judgment calls where the characters and action are concerned.  The fascinating thing about the film is the dichotomy of how caring and how cold-blooded Rose and Mikey are, and the horror of Vickie's situation, never truly able to take care of herself or her child.  Normally a film like this carries the views along on action alone, but there was a depth of character that allowed for fascination to set it.  I simply couldn't stop watching to see how things came out, and on more than one occasion I didn't see a twist coming till it slammed me between the eyes.There is a lot of sexuality, nudity, and violence in the movie, but it's genuine and real.  Not gratuitious.  This is a world of violent people, and it's presented with the carnality that's in that world.SHADOWBOXER is a different kind of crime film.

They play professional killers for hire.  Mirren is also dying of cancer.  Their latest hit is the pregnant wife of a criminal scoundrel.  When they get ready to off the wife, Mirren has a conscience crisis and as the wife's water breaks, she helps deliver the baby.  She and Gooding whisk the wife and newborn off for protection from the husband.  Mirren's performance is quietly efficient, showing the regrets she has in her life and her compassion for this woman and her baby.  Gooding is good as the faithful son/lover of Mirren and when Mirren eventually dies, he takes over as the father for the little boy.  It has a noirish quality and although not action-packed, it is involving.  Stephen Dorff is excellent as the killer husband with no morals; Macy Gray is annoying as the wife's best friend, she should stick to singing; Vanessa Ferlito (late of CSI NY) does very well as the wife, and Joseph Gordon Leavitt is fine as the doctor who helps everyone out.

I ONLY bought this movie because I love Stephen Dorff with a passion so I checked it out.This movie is not the worst I've seen but it's not the best either. It's very disjointed and the plot is choppy and many things do not make sense. I think the unneeded violence and sex was thrown in to keep the viewers from dozing off. Dorff is wonderful and though he has some bad movie choices, he always makes the best of the roles given him. He does not disappoint and plays the perfect Clayton. Cuba Gooding Jr. is dry and boring. Helen Mirren is just as boring. Joseph Levitt, Monique and Macy Gray were entertaining and Macy should have been shown more! She brought spunk to this dry movie. The lady who plays Clayton's wife wasn't the best actress and though she's very attractive and her character is upheld as a decent person in the film, her colligen-pumped lips made her look like some sleazy porn star.There were too many unbelievable things in this film like the various couples! I could not buy Helen and Cuba as a couple no matter how hard I try. Helen Mirren looks like an old bag. She is not an older woman who would attract a younger, fit man such as Cuba Gooding who could have any woman he wants. I think the director wanted us to buy that this romance was out of circumstance and yes, couples do fall in love because of that at times but there was no way that I thought Gooding's character would look at Mirren in a sexual way. If anything he'd think of her as a mother figure and that's how it should have been written. It would have been more touching that way. Their sexual relationship was sickening and gross.Joseph Levitt and Monique were an interesting looking pair together but they didn't fit as well. Levitt looked like a twelve year-old boy and I could not see how he or Monique would be attracted to each other. Maybe if his role had looked more mature, you could see it. Also he's too young looking to pull off even the ""young"" doctor character convincingly.  The coupling in this film was plain silly and laughable. The only couple that seemed interesting and who fit together would have been Gooding and Macy Gray yet he had to kill her!There were too many characters which made the plot more confusing. Sometimes characters wouldn't be shown for a long time and it was as if we're supposed to remember them. Please.  A big problem I had with the plot is that as Clayton's son grows up when the years go by, everyone stays the same and looks the same!  Couldn't their appearances change? The characters had the same hair styles and looked just as young years later as when the film began.If it hadn't been for Dorff then this movie would have gotten one star. It's just too confusing, boring and silly.  The director tries to push this as a top notch, thrilling film noir but it doesn't work.

1015604,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000HRMAUY,Peter Shermeta,"[3, 5]","As the movie began to pick up steam, it really began to rub me the wrong way. There were ridiculous scenes at the beginning that I figured only set the stage for more to come. Luckily the weird beginning did not become the weird middle or the weird ending. The movie got less bizarre, but the story never really seemed to do much for me. The only redeeming factors in Shadowboxer were a few performances. The cast was decent and some of the actors did a respectful job.The bad guy: I like Stephen Dorff; he reminds me of a young, Lost Boys-esque Kiefer Sutherland. But maybe the vampire vibe comes from his part in Blade. The world may never know. He plays the over-the-top crime boss. We see that his men are fiercely loyal, though we never know why. We never find out what he does or why he is so good at it. All we know is that he is heartless and wants his wife killed. I like him, but he wasn't great here. Though some of you may enjoy his full-frontal scene...The good guy: Cuba Gooding, Jr. has played some brilliant parts over his well-respected career. He has done great work in great films and he has done great work in some lesser films. Shadowboxer will fall into the latter category. Cuba's role was not one many other actors would covet, especially if they had his name recognition, but he was impressive in it. Another ""lesser"" movie in which Cuba excelled is A Murder of Crows.The doctor: Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Out of nowhere, Gordon-Levitt has given me two great performances. He did not have a lead role in Shadowboxer like he did in Brick, but he is still worth mentioning. I can talk about how good Cuba was and I can talk about how excited I get when a movie is set in Philadelphia and someone makes a run to Pat's for cheesesteaks, but it was really Gordon-Levitt's performance that was the highlight of the movie for me. His part was much less serious than his character in Brick, and it was hilarious. Maybe it wasn't intended to make me laugh so hard, but Gordon-Levitt as the crime boss's go-to doctor when ""accidents"" occur, who also has an affinity for large black women...if you would not laugh you don't have a sense of humor.If you take a ""Hey, I think you'll like this"" recommendation from someone who has not even seen the movie you could enjoy parts of it. That is the brief version of how I ended up seeing Shadowboxer. I went through it so now you don't have to. And now I can do my small part to educate you on a movie you are probably better off avoiding.",3,Spare yourself the time.,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2493,"['movie', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'really', 'began', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'figured', 'only', 'set', 'stage', 'more', 'come', 'Luckily', 'weird', 'beginning', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'weird', 'middle', 'weird', 'ending', 'movie', 'got', 'less', 'bizarre', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'do', 'much', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'Shadowboxer', 'were', 'few', 'performances', 'cast', 'was', 'decent', 'actors', 'did', 'respectful', 'job.The', 'bad', 'guy', 'like', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'young', 'Lost', 'Boys-esque', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'maybe', 'vampire', 'vibe', 'part', 'Blade', 'world', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'over-the-top', 'crime', 'boss', 'see', 'men', 'are', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'why', 'so', 'good', 'know', 'heartless', 'wife', 'killed', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'here', 'may', 'enjoy', 'full-frontal', 'scene', 'good', 'guy', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'played', 'brilliant', 'parts', 'well-respected', 'career', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'great', 'films', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'lesser', 'films', 'Shadowboxer', 'will', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'Cuba', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'covet', 'especially', 'had', 'name', 'recognition', 'was', 'impressive', 'lesser', 'movie', 'Cuba', 'excelled', 'A', 'Murder', 'Crows.The', 'doctor', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'nowhere', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'given', 'two', 'great', 'performances', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lead', 'role', 'Shadowboxer', 'did', 'Brick', 'still', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'can', 'talk', 'how', 'good', 'Cuba', 'was', 'can', 'talk', 'how', 'excited', 'get', 'when', 'movie', 'set', 'Philadelphia', 'someone', 'run', 'Pat', 'cheesesteaks', 'was', 'really', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'performance', 'was', 'highlight', 'movie', 'part', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'serious', 'character', 'Brick', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'make', 'so', 'hard', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'crime', 'boss', 'go-to', 'doctor', 'when', 'accidents', 'occur', 'who', 'also', 'affinity', 'large', 'black', 'women', 'would', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'humor.If', 'take', 'Hey', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'recommendation', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'seen', 'movie', 'could', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'brief', 'version', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'Shadowboxer', 'went', 'so', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'now', 'can', 'do', 'small', 'part', 'educate', 'movie', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'avoiding']",N/A

Mixed race relationships, and older women with a younger black man and the violence and sex is quite explicit. So if you don't like that sort of thing don't buy it or rent it.In places it is overly stylised, but I cared about what happened to at least some of the characters and therefore overall I would recommend it.

1015609,A3TMEPF7I9KHQ8,B000HRMAUY,The Fountain Pen Diva,"[2, 2]","Shadowboxer is one of those quiet little movies that packs a huge wallop!  Firstly, it's got a stellar cast featuring Dame Helen Mirren, Cuba Gooding Jr.and Mo'nique.  It's a rollercoaster ride and it's dark, edgy and sometimes over-the-top.Mirren and Gooding play Rose and Mikey, contract killers and lovers.  Oh and Mikey is also her stepson...whee.  Rose is dying of cancer but she and her ""partner"" take one last job--to kill the wife of a crime boss (played with cartoonishly sadistic glee by Stephen Dorff--who seems to be very good at playing psycho bad guys).  Everything's fine and dandy until Rose enters the bedroom to finish the job and the wife (Vanessa Ferlito) starts giving birth right then and there.  In an ironic twist of fate, Rose decides to save both mother and baby and the entire dysfunctional family moves out to the suburbs.  Of course, it's merely a matter of time before something or someone gives them away.This isn't a film for everyone, and there's certainly enough controversial aspects to merit the R-rating, and yet there's something wonderfully refreshing about a film that plays with our perceptions.  It was interesting for Rose, a woman who's lived her entire life as a cold-blooded killer, to find her humanity in such a profound way in the act of bringing a new life into the world.Okay, yes there is an interracial element with Mirren and Gooding and those scenes were well done, hot yet tender at the same time.  They felt personal, though they also played with the squick element since Mikey IS Rose's stepson, and I really have to give it to Dame Helen for really just letting it all hang out (but then again she's always been sexy as all get-out to me).Love this movie.
