It was able to keep my attention throughout the entire film, which was a plus, but there were just some small elements to it all that I found annoying and distracting to the entire picture.  Period piece films are difficult because the director is trying to do two very important tasks, keep the film as accurate as possible while also trying to ensure that you have the audience's attention.  This is a very hard task that most directors fall short on, but not in the case of Mira Nair.  She somehow successfully captures the beauty of the time, while also building these compelling characters from a book written decades ago that honestly keep your attention throughout.  I also credit the actors for this, we have such a high caliber of acting happening in this film that it is impossible to keep your eyes off the screen.  I guess what I am trying to say is that visually this film is near perfection, but what brings it down are the smaller elements that are like small slaps in the face.Quickly, before I get too deeply into what I did not like about this film, I would like to stress again that this was not an easy book to bring to the big screen.  There is so much action, so many characters, some twists, which without having top actors at the top of their game or a strong handle on the thematic elements, this would have suffered greatly.  Nair had a complete grip on this film while also adding some powerful cultural elements of her own into the film to strengthen the reality of the picture.  She takes elements of her Indian heritage and brings this vibrant film to life with her passionate eye towards her homeland's culture.  Nair also instructs the actors well as to what to accomplish with each scene, giving the audience just the right amount of time to understand what is happening without getting bored.  Sadly, Reese does struggle occasionally with some of her scenes, but thankfully she has the mighty hands of such actors like Rhys Ifans, Bob Hoskins, and Gabriel Byrne to successfully catch her.  With these powerhouses, Nair ensured that audience had a visually beautiful period piece that would attract audiences through color and novice acting skill.Now, into what brought this film down a couple of notches.  I have already talked about the acting and the direction as being exceptional for this genre, but sometimes when you focus too greatly on these aspects of a film, you forget the smaller parts, and that is what ultimately hurt this film.  For example, why did Byrne never age?  Why was Reese pregnant throughout the entire film even after she gave birth to her first and only child?  There was definitely some confusion on my part with this moment.  Then there was also this unbalance of attention between the two major characters.  I felt as if I knew more about Amelia's romance and life than I did about Reese's life.  I cared more about the unknown relationship between Amelia and Dobbin than I did with Witherspoon and Purefoy.  This should not have been the case.  If there had been just a bit more attention spent on Witherspoon and Purefoy, the dramatic conclusion would have hit home a bit harder.  There would have been more of an emotional strain, instead of me simply stating ... ""huh"".  I know that this film was already pushing two hours, but I needed more information on Purefoy's gambling addiction.  I do not feel this was handed the credit it was needed to push the conclusion into emotion.  I kept seeing him win, never loose, which confused me greatly when they suddenly didn't have any money.  The same can be said as to why the Sedley's found themselves suddenly in the predicament that they were in.  How the slightest moment of aristocracy can come crashing down at any moment?  I think this is in due to a editing of some interaction between some characters that may have strengthened the flimsy bond between them.  Just some thoughts and small points that I felt should have been expanded to bring this film into a stronger category.Overall, I thought this was a good film, just not great.  For a period piece film it kept my attention stronger than any other has, but that is due in part to the powerful acting by the secondary cast.  Every time I turned my eyes, there was another well-respected actor giving 100%, I just wish Reese would have worked at that level too.  Don't get me wrong, she was good, but just riding at 90% when others are at the top of their game, hurts the film in the long run.  The story was sharp and the direction by Mira Nair was beautiful.  She should have been nominated for something for this film, she went above and beyond what other period piece directors have done in the past.  This film wasn't just riding on the coattails of other period piece films, but tried to stand up on its own.  There were some small elements that hurt it, but overall it was a decent piece of cinema.  I recommend it to everyone once, but after that you can put it away.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Are you trying to steer me towards an indiscretion?,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,5049,"['was', 'one',

866197,A2ELP13J2HSGJQ,B0006FO8E8,AJ Denny,"[1, 2]","Becky Sharp (Reese Witherspoon) and Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai) leave Miss Pinkerton's School for Girls as an orphan and a cosseted young woman of means, but the best friends will see their fortunes reversed in ""Vanity Fair.""Director Mira Nair has reimagined William Makepeace Thackeray's novel of 19th century Regency England as a sweet if sometimes melodramatic Bollywood movie. While the high production values mean the films looks great, and Reese Witherspoon shines at the heart of it as Becky, the abrupt nature of changes in the plot make it hard to sustain your suspension of disbelief. One scene to the next, decades may of gone by, or a couple have fallen in love.At the start of the film Becky is suitably introduced by putting on a puppet show which foreshadows her future, and with the sale of the portrait of her deceased mother, puts a price on her sentimentality. The man who buys it shadows her later life, before coming back to try and purchase her self-respect.Vanity Fair is subtitled `a novel without a hero.' Although the Bollywood treatment gives Becky more warmth, it also makes her downfall harder to understand. Also George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers from ""Bend It Like Beckham) is never given a good reason for marrying Amelia, who he only became engaged to because of his father. Quickly George is flirting with Becky, wanting her to run away with him, but he is killed at the Battle of Waterloo. Amelia's steadfast loyalty to him is hard to understand.The jumps in time through the film sometimes are funny or sad. Poor William Dobbin (Rhys Ifans) flees with a heart broken by Amelia to India. There you gauge the passage of time by the growth of his hair. Becky's husband Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy) leaves her too quickly for the scene to have much impact, and is killed off soon after. One of the last things you get to hear him say is his wish to pull his life together, and you feel cheated for not getting to see it happen.Even though purists may prefer the book, ""Vanity Fair"" is entertaining to watch. Like any Bollywood movie, it alive and vibrant with colours. More then once you can imagine if it had been made in India, the cast would of started dancing. In the end they sort of do. Even though Thackeray may be turning in his grave at the very idea, it is a sweet, engaging movie with a happy ending for everyone.",4,Warm Hearted Regency Legally Blonde,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2362,"['Becky', 'Sharp', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'leave', 'Miss', 'Pinkerton', 'School', 'Girls', 'orphan', 'cosseted', 'young', 'woman', 'means', 'best', 'friends', 'will', 'see', 'fortunes', 'reversed', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'reimagined', 'William', 'Makepeace', 'Thackeray', 'novel', '19th', 'century', 'Regency', 'England', 'sweet', 'sometimes', 'melodramatic', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'mean', 'films', 'great', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'shines', 'heart', 'Becky', 'abrupt', 'nature', 'changes', 'plot', 'make', 'hard', 'sustain', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'One', 'scene', 'next', 'decades', 'may', 'gone', 'couple', 'have', 'fallen', 'start', 'film', 'Becky', 'suitably', 'introduced', 'putting', 'puppet', 'show', 'future', 'sale', 'portrait', 'deceased', 'mother', 'price', 'sentimentality', 'man', 'who', 'later', 'life', 'coming', 'back', 'try', 'purchase', 'self-respect.Vanity', 'Fair', 'subtitled', 'novel', 'hero', 'Bollywood', 'treatment', 'Becky', 'more', 'warmth', 'also', 'downfall', 'harder', 'understand', 'Also', 'George', 'Osborne', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'never', 'given', 'good', 'reason', 'marrying', 'Amelia', 'who', 'only', 'became', 'engaged', 'father', 'Quickly', 'George', 'flirting', 'Becky', 'wanting', 'run', 'away', 'killed', 'Battle', 'Waterloo', 'Amelia', 'steadfast', 'loyalty', 'hard', 'understand.The', 'jumps', 'time', 'film', 'sometimes', 'are', 'funny', 'sad', 'Poor', 'William', 'Dobbin', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'heart', 'broken', 'Amelia', 'India', 'gauge', 'passage', 'time', 'growth', 'hair', 'Becky', 'husband', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'too', 'quickly', 'scene', 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'killed', 'off', 'soon', 'One', 'last', 'things', 'get', 'hear', 'say', 'wish', 'pull', 'life', 'together', 'feel', 'cheated', 'not', 'getting', 'see', 'happen.Even', 'purists', 'may', 'prefer', 'book', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'alive', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'More', 'then', 'can', 'imagine', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'India', 'cast', 'would', 'started', 'dancing', 'end', 'sort', 'do', 'Even', 'Thackeray', 'may', 'be', 'turning', 'grave', 'very', 'idea', 'sweet', 'engaging', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'everyone']",N/A

Personally, having never read the book, I can appreciate this movie on its own merits. I found Becky Sharp to be a fascinating character and the drama that unfolded quickly transported me in time. The sign of a good period piece. Becky's spunk and ambition reminded me of my favorite character, Scarlett O'Hara.. then I learned that Becky was in fact the inspiration for the latter. The supporting cast was equally good, specially James Purefoy and Rhys Ifans (amazing as Dobbin), and fearless 'Aunt Crawley' who surprised me by mooning everyone in one bath scene. That said, this production had a few misses. The script feels very uneven because Becky is played more sympathetically than the story suggests. It's not clear why her family and friends react so harshly to her when Becky seems highly resourcefulness and rather harmless in comparison. Also, in trying to modernize the production, the director went over the top with costumes and make-up making some scenes look rather garish and cartoonish, a bit like the Moulin Rouge treatment. Finally, the last 10 minutes feels very rushed, with characters being thrown together haphazardly to achieve a resolution.

Not only critics but their fans dont accept them in these roles nor do critics and a critical drubbing even a star cant afford. One recalls how demi moore's career was never quite the same,after ""the scarlet letter"" the american classic i recall as a teenager. A great novel but critics never took to her peformance,and not all stars are wide rangeing and can take on a variety of roles. Erryl flynn was more at home in swashbuckling roles,and i recall when he came to the city and left the environs of his medieval locations fans and critics never quite took to him,as in ""cry wolf"" so an actor doing workoutside of their range,is often looked at critically and can set back their career. Especially the panoromic type trajectory in Thackeray's vanity fair.The character is taken across the country through many scenes,making itdifficult to make a movie out of scenes,but it works. It may seem overlong and ponderous to some,but that's just intelligent scripting,getting at the majorforces at work in 19th centurey england. Reese witherspoon carries it offexcellently,and actually for a star and not much of a vehicle here,she adapts herself to the role,and is wide rangeing and very good. She's effeminate andattractive alluring yet maintains an inner sovereignty in the role whichcarries the movie along and without her performance the movie woulddeteriorate quickly. Although roles like this are called feminist,it'sjust more intelligent filmmaking,with decent female roles and charactersexisting for their own fulfillment and not always for a chattel or appendageof someone else. The story concerns a female character searching forcultivation and fulfillment,in the 19th century at a time of much socialchanges,and the film is quite good,it may have had american financingbut seems to be produced by masterpiecetype theatre production values,trueto the time. It's nice of reese witherspoon to lend her star power andtake risks,although to call this type of role feminists just criticisesmuch of modern cinema and life,i would call it psychologically realist,as much of the society is seen through the lower class lens of hercharacter,from lords to empire to sex...the role is underplayed well andthere's no modern type of sexualizing which ruins too many films and ilook forward to this star's next role.

So that's why I couldn't figure who was playing Becky Sharp so successfully in this film. I've read the book, more than once in fact, and I must say this movie captures the essence of it.Becky Sharp is a poor artist's daughter, who is left orphaned at about ten years old, and sent out to service. She grows into a complete beauty (well, she looks like Reese Witherspoon, after all) and is first a governess, then an old lady's companion, then . . . well, let's just say she has a great many adventures.Many men want her, of course. But as she told Captain Rawdon Crawley when he propositioned her, there will never be but two men who enter her bedroom: her husband and her doctor. Lacking a medical degree, he married her, much to the disgust of his family.Much of the story is the way the gentry in Victorian times ruthlessly manipulated the love lives and marriages of their adult children. But Becky and her friend Amelia both married for love rather than for money, to not particularly good results.Just in case you haven't read the book, I'll let Thackery tell the story, not me.

866203,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0006FO8E8,Benjamin,"[3, 5]","I love it when prim-and-proper costume dramas have more than a touch of devilish fun and true wit. VANITY FAIR, blessed with a stunning look and excellent ensemble cast, is luckily another one of those films.Reese Witherspoon, as Becky Sharp, gives one of her better performances, though I think her best film was ELECTION. Becky Sharp is an altogether different role for Witherspoon, and she brings to it a greater depth than you expect. Also, she's able to communicate so much of Becky's motivations in her smirk. She's alternately funny, beautiful, smart, devious and charming.In supporting roles, Bob Hoskins, Eileen Atkins, Oscar winner Jim Broadbent and Gabriel Byrne are particularly noteworthy.The script, written by the same person who wrote GOSFORD PARK, is excellent and contains many great scenes.Director Mira Nair, who made MONSOON WEDDING, allows touches of Indian culture and flourish throughout the film, which gives it a unique, dazzling color.I really, really liked this movie.It's a delightful, occasionally very funny film; and it deals mostly faithfully with Thackeray's source material, highlighting much of the hypocrisy he found in London at the time he wrote it.",5,"Beautiful, well-written and well-acted.",1092182400,"08 11, 2004",2004,1188,"['love', 'when', 'prim-and-proper', 'costume', 'dramas', 'have', 'more', 'touch', 'devilish', 'fun', 'true', 'wit', 'VANITY', 'FAIR', 'blessed', 'stunning', 'look', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'luckily', 'one', 'films.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'think', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'ELECTION', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'altogether', 'different', 'role', 'Witherspoon', 'greater', 'depth', 'expect', 'Also', 'able', 'communicate', 'so', 'much', 'Becky', 'motivations', 'smirk', 'alternately', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'devious', 'charming.In', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'are', 'particularly', 'noteworthy.The', 'script', 'written', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'excellent', 'many', 'great', 'scenes.Director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'who', 'made', 'MONSOON', 'WEDDING', 'touches', 'Indian', 'culture', 'flourish', 'film', 'unique', 'dazzling', 'color.I', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'movie.It', 'delightful', 'occasionally', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'mostly', 'faithfully', 'Thackeray', 'source', 'material', 'highlighting', 'much', 'hypocrisy', 'found', 'London', 'time', 'wrote']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","Becky Sharp is an orphaned child after the death of her opera singing mother (years before) and her painter father (more recent). She's quickly bustled into a house of governesses where her life's ambitions will collide with what is expected of her.Becky grows quickly and is soon offered a job within the family of a wealthy woman whom she'd shared her time in training with (both women now having been trained to be governesses). But Becky isn't satisfied to just be a low-slung teacher of well-to-do children. She wants to scale the walls of indifference that separate her from the upper echelon of society. And she's willing to do just about anything to get there.Along the way there's deceit, anger, backstabbing, love, loss, and redemption._____________________________________________________________________________Reese Witherspoon stars as the beautiful and conniving Becky Sharp, and does so with surprising strength. Never having seen Mrs. Witherspoon in a role of this type, I was stunned to see her English portrayal pulled off extremely well. In fact, all of the actors and actresses did a great job.I was also very pleased with the sets, the costumes, and the colorful ending of the film as Becky finally makes it to India.Where this movie had problems was in execution.

It's long. You don't get to watch the whole thing in 2 hours, but it's worth the time spent. This one really isn't.It isn't clear to me whether the producers had the same idea in mind when they produced this as I had when I watched it. I hadn't thought they would try to cram the whole book into a couple of hours. If you're looking for a movie with Reese Witherspoon at her best, this may be it. Other than that, this is a bunch of people in period costume with creative and expensive scenery behind them. The story was not well considered but something of an afterthought.We started out the way I expected, other than the childhood scene, with Becky Sharp leaving the school, shouting a few insults in French as she departs.Then I got lost.I had a terrible time figuring out the characters, and I knew the characters. I can't imagine how difficult it would be if one wasn't familiar with the book. It appears that the goal was to fit the book, as much of it as possible, into 120 minutes, no matter what it took. I enjoyed it in spite of the confusion and I'm not sure how else they could have fit it all in.Unfortunately for the movie, the characters never really developed.Unfortunately for me, I never developed a 'relationship' with any of them enough to care what happened to them, although there was that dramatic almost 'panic attack' moment where Becky Sharp realized she had lost the man she actually loved.The friendship between Becky and Amelia wasn't very important in this movie and it is all important in the book.Jos Sedley, Amelia's inept but not entirely unlikable brother, was one exception. He was exactly as I had imagined him, but where was my hero, William Dobbin?!  He was given no time to develop his role and consequently almost ceased to exist. He bought the piano. Amelia's reaction when she found out? She might as well have had no reaction. There really wasn't time to explore these characters in 2 hours. That was my main beef with this movie. William Dobbin just appeared occasionally, made a statement, and then went away. It was all meaningless when it should have been an important part.I've really got to go view that first scene in the Sedley house again. It was so confused that I'm still not sure who was there, what happened, or why, or was there even such a scene? It was one of the most important parts of the story, but was rushed into insignificance because of the time constraints evidently.My conclusion is, I'm glad they attempted Vanity Fair. I wish there had been time to do it well.",3,"Might Better Have Promoted  it as  ""Based On"" or with  ""A Hint Of"" Thackeray's Vanity Fair",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2891,"['just', 'viewed', 'last', 'night', 'wanted', 'get', 'thoughts', 'down', 'are', 'fresh.My', 'conclusion', 'interesting', 'collection', 'expensive', 'backgrounds', 'clothing', 'great', 'want', 'trendy', 'romp', 'version', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'far', 'real', 'A', 'E', 'Literary', 'Classics', 'version', 'want', 'something', 'closer', 'real', 'thing', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', '2', 'hours', 'time', 'spent', 'one', 'really', ""isn't.It"", ""n't"", 'clear', 'producers', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'mind', 'when', 'produced', 'had', 'when', 'watched', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'cram', 'whole', 'book', 'couple', 'hours', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'best', 'may', 'be', 'Other', 'bunch', 'people', 'period', 'costume', 'creative', 'expensive', 'scenery', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'considered', 'something', 'afterthought.We', 'started', 'out', 'way', 'expected', 'other', 'childhood', 'scene', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'leaving', 'school', 'shouting', 'few', 'insults', 'French', 'got', 'lost.I', 'had', 'terrible', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'characters', 'knew', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'difficult', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'book', 'goal', 'was', 'fit', 'book', 'much', 'possible', '120', 'minutes', 'matter', 'what', 'took', 'enjoyed', 'spite', 'confusion', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'in.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'developed.Unfortunately', 'never', 'developed', ""'relationship"", 'enough', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'dramatic', 'almost', ""'panic"", 'attack', 'moment', 'where', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'realized', 'had', 'lost', 'man', 'actually', 'loved.The', 'friendship', 'Becky', 'Amelia', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'important', 'book.Jos', 'Sedley', 'Amelia', 'inept', 'not', 'entirely', 'unlikable', 'brother', 'was', 'one', 'exception', 'was', 'exactly', 'had', 'imagined', 'where', 'was', 'hero', 'William', 'Dobbin', 'was', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'role', 'consequently', 'almost', 'ceased', 'exist', 'bought', 'piano', 'Amelia', 'reaction', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'reaction', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'explore', 'characters', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'main', 'beef', 'movie', 'William', 'Dobbin', 'just', 'appeared', 'occasionally', 'made', 'statement', 'then', 'went', 'away', 'was', 'meaningless', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'important', 'part.I', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'go', 'view', 'first', 'scene', 'Sedley', 'house', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'confused', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'even', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'story', 'was', 'rushed', 'insignificance', 'time', 'constraints', 'evidently.My', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'glad', 'attempted', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'time', 'do', 'well']",N/A
866207,ATC2WM08ZF9C1,B0006FO8E8,book worm,"[0, 0]","This movie has the worst cinematography I have ever seen in a film. 90% of the shots are of people from the waist and up. The viewer never gets a long shot or a full length shot of any scene whatsoever. There are virtually no establishing shots to give the viewer an idea of what the setting is or what exactly is going on. Most of the close-ups are cropped so badly, chopping off the tops of the actors' heads., and there are way too many close-ups of Reese, even though I am a fan of hers. Even when the cast of characters are dancing, we never get a chance to see any footwork whatsoever. They could be roller skating for all I know in their underwear. The only feet action you see are the closeups of the feet of the Indian characters, for some strange reason. This is an injustice for the costume designer and the hair person, even though the hair is not too spectaular in this film. What a waste of beautiful costumes, when you are not given a chance to see them. I get the feeling that the director was trying to make this a non-Jane Austen-y flick. If that's the case, she should have chosen another book other than Vanity Fair.About three-quarters way into the movie, the tempo suddenly switches and the film becomes out of the blue a Madonna-esque music video. I felt like I was watching Madonna in one of her past lives... There's also a lot of singing from Reese that I felt could have been edited out. They really didn't serve any significant purpose in the story. I really didn't want to sit and listen to pointless singing unless the movie is a musical, which I believe it is not.I'd recommend that you skip this movie and listen to the audio-book version of Vanity Fair instead, if you're not going to read the book.

866210,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0006FO8E8,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 5]","If you read several of the reviews, you soon realize that this film is a very mixed production with some obvious conceptual and interpretation flaws. However in all fairness, there are some very good points that bear mentioning also. I will try to cover the primary weaknesses and strengths of this film.A primary weakness is that the short 2.5 hour format is too short to cover such a vast amount of time, characters, and interactions. Whereas characters that maintain roughly the same persona over time or who are only seen during certain parts of the story, this is not an issue. However for the character of George Osborne, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the short format is a disaster. He goes from a complete snob who doesn't even wish to talk with Becky since she is a meer governess, to convincing Jos Sedley to refrain from courting Becky, to becoming engaged to Amelia Sedley, to breaking the engagement for financial gain, to cruel abuse of Amelia, to refusing a rich marriage arranged by his father, to marrying Amelia, to trying to seduce Becky, to dying at Waterloo. No actor could make a sensible performance of this mess. As the main protagonists, Reese Witherspoon and James Purefoy, as Becky Sharp Crawley and Rawdon Crawley, at least appeared to have some character development over time that was comprehensible.Another weakness is that the film could not decide to be totally sarcastic, cruely funny and bitter as in the novel or to try to engage the audience by sugar coating some of the characters, especially Becky. This leads to a disconnect that indicates that Thackery's original masterpiece was poorly understood by the film makers.  The contemporary message that Englands wealth was due to colonial exploitation could have been integrated without going totally over the top. The influence of Indian was too much, reaching the point of absurdity with Becky and the society matrons acting as Hindu dancing women before the King of England. Thus cruel characters such as the Marquess, Lord Steyne, coming across as cardboard 2 dimensional villians instead of the truely pathological evil characters they really are.Margaret Mitchell must have been influenced by Vanity Fair as she wrote Gone with the WInd. Her translation of Becky Sharp into Scarlett O'Hara is far more insightful and subtle than is this translation of Becky Sharp from masterpiece novel to inconsistent and poorly conceptualized film.Yet there are strengths. The scene where Rawdon Crawley is called to war against Napoleon and quickly gives a quick assessment of both his small worldly worth and yet his great love for Becky is touching, well-played, and the emotional height of the story.Eileen Atkins is super as rich Aunt Matilda Pitt. Jim Broadbent is good as Mr. Osborne, the rich merchant. Bob Hoskins, is funny as Rawdon's excentric father. Gabriel Byrne is not given enough time and space to adequatly flesh out the evil boredom and malcontent of Lord Steyne. Reese Witherspoon gives everything she has to make this version of Becky Sharp work. However when the director takes a character like Becky Sharp and tries to reshape them, the vision or consistency is lost, and Witherspoon's Becky never seems to learn. There is only one scene where Witherspoon conveys the tragedy that is Becky Sharp, that being the high pitched scream the Becky calls out to Rawdon as he walks out of her life forever. James Purefoy as Rawdon Crawley is well done, conveying that even though he is penniless and a gambler, none-the-less he is devoted to Becky.The film is visually beautiful but conceptually shallow and inconsistently executed.",4,A flawed interpretation but not without some good points.,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3628,"['read', 'several', 'reviews', 'soon', 'realize', 'film', 'very', 'mixed', 'production', 'obvious', 'conceptual', 'interpretation', 'flaws', 'However', 'fairness', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'points', 'bear', 'mentioning', 'also', 'will', 'try', 'cover', 'primary', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'film.A', 'primary', 'weakness', 'short', '2.5', 'hour', 'format', 'too', 'short', 'cover', 'vast', 'amount', 'time', 'characters', 'interactions', 'Whereas', 'characters', 'maintain', 'roughly', 'same', 'persona', 'time', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'seen', 'certain', 'parts', 'story', 'not', 'issue', 'However', 'character', 'George', 'Osborne', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'short', 'format', 'disaster', 'complete', 'snob', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'wish', 'talk', 'Becky', 'meer', 'governess', 'convincing', 'Jos', 'Sedley', 'refrain', 'courting', 'Becky', 'becoming', 'engaged', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'breaking', 'engagement', 'financial', 'gain', 'cruel', 'abuse', 'Amelia', 'refusing', 'rich', 'marriage', 'arranged', 'father', 'marrying', 'Amelia', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Becky', 'dying', 'Waterloo', 'No', 'actor', 'could', 'make', 'sensible', 'performance', 'mess', 'main', 'protagonists', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Crawley', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'least', 'appeared', 'have', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'was', 'comprehensible.Another', 'weakness', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'be', 'totally', 'sarcastic', 'cruely', 'funny', 'bitter', 'novel', 'try', 'engage', 'audience', 'sugar', 'coating', 'characters', 'especially', 'Becky', 'disconnect', 'Thackery', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'poorly', 'understood', 'film', 'makers', 'contemporary', 'message', 'wealth', 'was', 'due', 'colonial', 'exploitation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'integrated', 'going', 'totally', 'top', 'influence', 'Indian', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'reaching', 'point', 'absurdity', 'Becky', 'society', 'matrons', 'acting', 'Hindu', 'dancing', 'women', 'King', 'England', 'Thus', 'cruel', 'characters', 'such', 'Marquess', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'coming', 'cardboard', '2', 'dimensional', 'villians', 'instead', 'truely', 'pathological', 'evil', 'characters', 'really', 'are.Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'wrote', 'Gone', 'WInd', 'translation', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'far', 'more', 'insightful', 'subtle', 'translation', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'masterpiece', 'novel', 'inconsistent', 'poorly', 'conceptualized', 'film.Yet', 'are', 'strengths', 'scene', 'where', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'called', 'war', 'Napoleon', 'quickly', 'quick', 'assessment', 'small', 'worldly', 'worth', 'yet', 'great', 'love', 'Becky', 'touching', 'well-played', 'emotional', 'height', 'story.Eileen', 'Atkins', 'super', 'rich', 'Aunt', 'Matilda', 'Pitt', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Osborne', 'rich', 'merchant', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'funny', 'Rawdon', 'excentric', 'father', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'space', 'adequatly', 'flesh', 'out', 'evil', 'boredom', 'malcontent', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'everything', 'make', 'version', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'work', 'However', 'when', 'director', 'character', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'tries', 'reshape', 'vision', 'consistency', 'lost', 'Witherspoon', 'Becky', 'never', 'learn', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Witherspoon', 'tragedy', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'being', 'high', 'pitched', 'scream', 'Becky', 'out', 'Rawdon', 'life', 'forever', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'well', 'done', 'conveying', 'even', 'penniless', 'gambler', 'none-the-less', 'devoted', 'Becky.The', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'conceptually', 'shallow', 'inconsistently', 'executed']",N/A

Some of the scenes you wish were given more length as in the book have to be just a few important words and then to the next piece.  This does help keep things moving for modern audiences and gets more beautiful images on the screen, still, there is a lot to be said for dialogue.The next wonder is the magnificent Becky Sharp.  Not that she is a sweet or noble creation, but that she is such a wonderful protagonist.  She is so talented, brilliant, and ambitious that even her unlikable features are almost, but not quite, forgivable.  She really cannot care for others and though the movie makes her more likable than the novel does, her coldness to her son shows in the way she never hugs him, never dotes on him, and is even willing to send him away to get ahead.  There are also many other wonderful characters in the story.  It seems to me that Margaret Mitchell got some aspects of Ashley Wilkes, Rhett Butler, Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Hamilton from this story.Then there are the exotic settings with wonderful costumes.  We have Regency England with its great aristocratic wealth in London and the country estates along with otherworldly India contrasted with the slums and poverty that exist nearly invisibly however close in proximity to grandeur and privilege.  The costumes in this film are terrific.  We see the sumptuous garb of the truly wealthy, the worn expensive clothing of those whose wealth is past but who must keep up appearances, to the army, the middle class and the very poor.  And, again, the Indian influence on the dress in this film is fantastic.Finally, there are the performances.  Reese Witherspoon is always a fine actor and this role lets her shine almost blindingly.  I don't have space to list each of the actors in this film, but I wish I could because they are each special in the way they bring these characters to life and make them memorable even though they are nearly all unsympathetic in some ways.  That is one of the great things Thackery pulls off.  The characters have their good and bad moments.  Sometimes they are awful, but most of them you end up finding something good about them anyway (although George makes it really difficult).  What a treat compared to the one dimensional characters in most movies where each stays within the domain of being a good guy or a bad guy.This is a real treat and I recommend it highly.",5,Superb film of a great story with a terrific cast and fabulous costumes,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,2642,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Thackery', 'novel', 'course', 'not', 'novel', 'one', 'read', 'made', 'own', 'not', 'mini-series', 'make', 'many', 'cuts', 'still', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'scenes', 'wish', 'were', 'given', 'more', 'length', 'book', 'have', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'important', 'words', 'then', 'next', 'piece', 'help', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'modern', 'audiences', 'more', 'beautiful', 'images', 'screen', 'still', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'dialogue.The', 'next', 'wonder', 'magnificent', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Not', 'sweet', 'noble', 'creation', 'such', 'wonderful', 'protagonist', 'so', 'talented', 'brilliant', 'ambitious', 'even', 'unlikable', 'features', 'are', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'forgivable', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'care', 'others', 'movie', 'more', 'likable', 'novel', 'coldness', 'son', 'way', 'never', 'hugs', 'never', 'even', 'willing', 'send', 'away', 'get', 'ahead', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'story', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'got', 'aspects', 'Ashley', 'Wilkes', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Melanie', 'Hamilton', 'story.Then', 'are', 'exotic', 'settings', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'have', 'Regency', 'England', 'great', 'aristocratic', 'wealth', 'London', 'country', 'otherworldly', 'India', 'contrasted', 'slums', 'poverty', 'exist', 'nearly', 'invisibly', 'however', 'close', 'proximity', 'grandeur', 'privilege', 'costumes', 'film', 'are', 'terrific', 'see', 'sumptuous', 'garb', 'truly', 'wealthy', 'worn', 'expensive', 'clothing', 'wealth', 'past', 'who', 'must', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'army', 'middle', 'class', 'very', 'poor', 'again', 'Indian', 'influence', 'dress', 'film', 'fantastic.Finally', 'are', 'performances', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'always', 'fine', 'actor', 'role', 'shine', 'almost', 'blindingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'space', 'list', 'actors', 'film', 'wish', 'could', 'are', 'special', 'way', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'make', 'memorable', 'even', 'are', 'nearly', 'unsympathetic', 'ways', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'Thackery', 'off', 'characters', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'moments', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'awful', 'most', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'something', 'good', 'anyway', 'George', 'really', 'difficult', 'What', 'treat', 'compared', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'stays', 'domain', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy.This', 'real', 'treat', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[5, 7]","There are some really eye popping costumes and sets in ""Vanity Fair.""Reese Witherspoon wears a dress that is the color of lapis lazuli. Amazing.And then there are the sets, which imagine Regency England as awash in Indian craft fair items.  You want to go shopping.And there's a lot of hustle and bustle. People in costumes dance the quadrille; people in costumes march off to Waterloo to defeat Napoleon.What there is not in this movie is a coherent plot with narrative drive. There also aren't too many believable, coherent characterizations.Who is Becky Sharp? I don't know, and I've seen the movie in which she is supposed to be the main character. I've been reading other posts and it appears that other viewers have the same questions. Did Becky love her husband or didn't she? That's a central point of the movie. You think that it would convey that much to the viewer.Who is Becky's lover, for that matter? Rawdon Crawley is played by James Purefoy, an amazingly good looking and charismatic actor. Given how lovely he is, you want to like him. But in the beginning of his relationship with Becky, he's not given a scene that shows his character. We don't know if their interest in each other is lust, or love, or ambition, or a superficiality.For some reason, maybe in order to be cleverly stylized? The script writer and/or director kept numerous key scenes off camera. Important characters marry, die, reject their lovers, reconcile with their lovers, reject or reconcile with their business partners or their own flesh and blood ... all off camera.The viewer only knows that something has happened because someone says something like, ""Oh, did you know that so and so died / married / left his/her spouse ..."" And the viewer feels cheated. Why didn't I get to see that? How can I connect with any of the characters or the plot if it all happens off camera?There are some fun scenes, but they never work together; they all seem to come from radically different movies.There are crude scenes spoofing the airs of the British nobility; these would work in a Monty Python flick. There are scenes of brutal betrayal, there are scenes of love and longing, there are glittering parties and violated corpses on a battlefield ... but they never seem to be  servicing the same plot in which develops a coherent cast of characters.Mira Nair's heavy overlay of Indian touches -- from a manservant with a Krishna Tika on his forehead to a meal of whole hot peppers in an English country house -- calls awkward attention to itself, and just doesn't really come off. But, then, nothing in this movie really does.The one unalloyed joy in this movie was Rhys Ifans' performance as a lovestruck soldier. Ifans was, of course, unforgettable as the gangly goof in ""Notting Hill."" Given how convincing he was in that performance, it's hard to believe that he could be as convincingly gallant, wistful, and yearning as he is here. But he does it; he's as good as, and reminiscent of, actors like Ronald Coleman and Leslie Howard when they played similar parts.But there's that problem again. Ifans' retro heart-on-sleeve performance and Reese Witherspoon's inescapably all-American and all-21st century brass and sass just don't work as part of the same movie.",2,"All Glitter, No Diamond; Poorly Directed; Doesn't Hang Together",1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,3250,"['are', 'really', 'eye', 'popping', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'dress', 'color', 'lapis', 'lazuli', 'Amazing.And', 'then', 'are', 'sets', 'imagine', 'Regency', 'England', 'awash', 'Indian', 'craft', 'fair', 'items', 'want', 'go', 'shopping.And', 'lot', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'People', 'costumes', 'dance', 'quadrille', 'people', 'costumes', 'march', 'Waterloo', 'defeat', 'Napoleon.What', 'not', 'movie', 'coherent', 'plot', 'narrative', 'drive', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'believable', 'coherent', 'characterizations.Who', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'character', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'other', 'posts', 'other', 'viewers', 'have', 'same', 'questions', 'Did', 'Becky', 'love', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'central', 'point', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'convey', 'that', 'much', 'viewer.Who', 'Becky', 'lover', 'matter', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'played', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'amazingly', 'good', 'looking', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'Given', 'how', 'lovely', 'want', 'like', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'Becky', 'not', 'given', 'scene', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'interest', 'other', 'lust', 'love', 'ambition', 'superficiality.For', 'reason', 'maybe', 'order', 'be', 'cleverly', 'stylized', 'script', 'writer', 'and/or', 'director', 'kept', 'numerous', 'key', 'scenes', 'camera', 'Important', 'characters', 'marry', 'die', 'reject', 'lovers', 'reconcile', 'lovers', 'reject', 'reconcile', 'business', 'partners', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'camera.The', 'viewer', 'only', 'something', 'happened', 'someone', 'something', 'Oh', 'did', 'know', 'so', 'so', 'died', '/', 'married', '/', 'left', 'spouse', 'viewer', 'feels', 'cheated', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'How', 'can', 'connect', 'characters', 'plot', 'off', 'camera', 'are', 'fun', 'scenes', 'never', 'work', 'together', 'seem', 'come', 'radically', 'different', 'movies.There', 'are', 'crude', 'scenes', 'spoofing', 'airs', 'British', 'nobility', 'would', 'work', 'Monty', 'Python', 'flick', 'are', 'scenes', 'brutal', 'betrayal', 'are', 'scenes', 'love', 'longing', 'are', 'glittering', 'parties', 'violated', 'corpses', 'battlefield', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'servicing', 'same', 'plot', 'coherent', 'cast', 'characters.Mira', 'Nair', 'heavy', 'overlay', 'Indian', 'touches', 'manservant', 'Krishna', 'Tika', 'forehead', 'meal', 'whole', 'hot', 'peppers', 'English', 'country', 'house', 'awkward', 'attention', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'off', 'then', 'nothing', 'movie', 'really', 'does.The', 'one', 'unalloyed', 'joy', 'movie', 'was', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'performance', 'lovestruck', 'soldier', 'Ifans', 'was', 'course', 'unforgettable', 'gangly', 'goof', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Given', 'how', 'convincing', 'was', 'performance', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'convincingly', 'gallant', 'wistful', 'yearning', 'here', 'as', 'good', 'reminiscent', 'actors', 'Ronald', 'Coleman', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'when', 'played', 'similar', 'parts.But', 'problem', 'again', 'Ifans', 'retro', 'heart-on-sleeve', 'performance', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'inescapably', 'all-American', 'all-21st', 'century', 'brass', 'sass', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'part', 'same', 'movie']",N/A

Reese Witherspoon plays the conniving Becky Sharp, the daughter of an artist and an opera singer who befriends Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai) and thus begins her entry into Victorian high society.  Becky discovers that getting the right husband is not as easy as she had hoped since British society closes ranks whenever she gets close.  Meanwhile, Amelia pines for her reluctant fianc&eacute; George (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) , a man who  continues to look for a more suitable wife at his father's request as he strings Amelia along.  As the two women struggle forward in their lives, they cross paths, then diverge, only to meet up again later.  Trailed by her admirer Dobbin (Rhys Iffans), Amelia fails to see him as her key to happiness.  And clear-eyed Becky manipulates herself into difficult situations that include a disinherited gambling husband and an aristocrat who expects debts to be re-paid.  Nair supplies the requisite Hollywood ending that is, fortunately for the viewer, lush eye-candy, even if it is too neat.Whereas Thackeray's novel is bitingly satiric, Nair's ""Vanity Fair"" is much gentler, with Witherspoon's Becky more likeable and less calculating than Thackeray's.  The film is more of a romp than social commentary.  Here, Becky is often a victim instead of a victimizer; yet, Witherspoon plays her as the complex woman she should be.  That Witherspoon of ""Legally Blonde"" fame could pull off Becky Sharp, even this altered one, says much about her acting ability.  Her expression shows an amazing range of emotions and thought, and she brings just the right amount of spiritedness to her character.  Romola Garai plays the blindly romantic Amelia well, but she is upstaged, as she should be, by Witherspoon.Thackeray's Vanity Fair is a large, complex novel with multiple plots unfolding simultaneously, and the screenplay has trouble at times advancing them on film.  There are huge gaps in character motivation and situations, either because of editing or sloppy writing.  While these points can be confusing, the film's pacing and rich scenes ensure that the viewer is quickly diverted from them.  Often, this film is visually arresting, and what it loses in translation between media, it gains in visual detail.""Vanity Fair"" is an entertaining period piece, but it's not fully Thackeray.  Students won't get away with watching the movie instead of reading the book since the screenplay changes both the flavor and even some of the plot points of the original.

Pawl ""Dani""","[1, 2]","VANITY FAIR, a novel by William Makepeace Thackery, is brought to the screen in this 2004 film adaptation by the great Indian filmmaker Mira Nair.  Unfortunately, for me, the beautiful, rich colors in the cinematography are the most compelling (and memorable) part of the story.  Ordinarily, I find examinations in the British class system quite compelling.  I loved the latest film adaptations of EMMA, SENSE AND SENSIBLITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and found them wonderful, engaging and very witty.  They were also derived from wonderfully-written Jane Austen novels.  VANITY FAIR fell short in so many ways, for me.Becky Sharpe (Reese Witherspoon) is a social-climbing young lady who comes from a very poor background and must rely on her wit and flair for manipulation to ascend her rank in the rigidly set class system of 19th century England.  This follows twenty years in Becky's footsteps, from the time that she merries gambler (and would-be doctor) Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy) to her chance encounter with The Marquess of Styne (Gabriel Byrne) who is a collector of her father's paintings.Though, Mira did a great job with painting a beautiful picture with color and art direction, the acting, the story and the adaptation completely fell flat.  I found myself not caring what became of Becky Sharpe, long before the film was even halfway over.  Not a good sign and it is a shame because Reese Witherspoon is a wonderful actress.  I reccomend that you steer clear of this Nair film, and watch some of her other works to get a better sense of her talent for storytelling--these include SALAAM BOMBAY, MISSISSIPPI MASALA, and MONSOON WEDDING.",2,"lovely to look at, but uncompelling......",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,1652,"['VANITY', 'FAIR', 'novel', 'William', 'Makepeace', 'Thackery', 'brought', 'screen', '2004', 'film', 'adaptation', 'great', 'Indian', 'filmmaker', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Unfortunately', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'colors', 'cinematography', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'memorable', 'part', 'story', 'Ordinarily', 'find', 'examinations', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'quite', 'compelling', 'loved', 'latest', 'film', 'adaptations', 'EMMA', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBLITY', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'found', 'wonderful', 'engaging', 'very', 'witty', 'were', 'also', 'derived', 'wonderfully-written', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'VANITY', 'FAIR', 'fell', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'me.Becky', 'Sharpe', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'social-climbing', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'very', 'poor', 'background', 'must', 'rely', 'wit', 'flair', 'manipulation', 'ascend', 'rank', 'rigidly', 'set', 'class', 'system', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'twenty', 'years', 'Becky', 'footsteps', 'time', 'gambler', 'would-be', 'doctor', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Marquess', 'Styne', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'who', 'collector', 'father', 'paintings.Though', 'Mira', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'painting', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'color', 'art', 'direction', 'acting', 'story', 'adaptation', 'completely', 'fell', 'flat', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'became', 'Becky', 'Sharpe', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'halfway', 'Not', 'good', 'sign', 'shame', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'reccomend', 'steer', 'clear', 'Nair', 'film', 'watch', 'other', 'works', 'get', 'better', 'sense', 'talent', 'storytelling', 'include', 'SALAAM', 'BOMBAY', 'MISSISSIPPI', 'MASALA', 'MONSOON', 'WEDDING']",N/A

I don't always agree with Amazon (""My Architect,"" a recent crock-umentary, is way overrated by wannabe intellectuals), but much of the time I do. I guess my tastes mirror that of the average Amazonian.""Vanity Fair"" is an entertaining romp that I watched to the very end--and a long movie it was--though I found it challenging--impossible, actually--to keep up with the various characters. It portrays class anxieties; of the rich, who jealously guard their station against ""social climber"" Becky Sharp, and of the precariously middle-class Becky Sharp and her husband, who are exposed to various humiliations and hardships, none of which, it must be confessed, approach those suffered by the very poor.This is rather a typical tale for British high society of the time (approximately 1810 - 1825), but if you like period pieces, as I do, then you will find this a worthy diversion for your evening.

While director Mira Nair doesn't quite manage to give this film the kind of life it deserves, she does give it a lush Indian spicing. And Witherspoon's performance is a pleasant surprise.Becky Sharp (Reese Witherspoon) is a social climber. Born in poverty to an impoverished artist and a chorus girl, she is determined to rise from the gutter and become a wealthy lady. So she uses her wit and brains to become a governess to Sir Pitt's (Bob Hoskins) kids. After befriending Sir Pitt's sister (Eileen Atkins), she makes her move -- marrying Pitt's son (James Purefoy).Despite a setback, Becky won't let her dreams die -- she continues using her quick wits to fight into London's high society. ""I think I could be a good woman if I had 5,000 a year,"" she announces at one point. She acquires money, men, and risks losing it all when her husband's debts peak, and scandal ends her marriage.The sprawling novel by William Thackeray is a tough one to adapt. It sprawls over decades and quietly punctures the class system of the times. And there's the fact that most costume dramas are as constricting as a corset. But the backstabbing and duplicity, heaving bosoms and love affairs give it the feeling of a costume drama turned soap opera. It's a permitted guilty pleasure.Nair -- best known for the rollicking comedy ""Monsoon Wedding"" -- follows in the footsteps of Ang Lee by dipping into classic costume drama. She gives a Bollywood flair to this story. The dancing, the lighting, the costumes (Reese's star-spangled veil and over-the-top eye makeup) are all more vibrant than you would expect in a costume drama. The one problem is that halfway through the film, there's a sort of dead zone. The film picks itself up somewhat, though not entirely.The biggest deviation from the novel is the lead. The character of Becky Sharp is softened up quite a bit, making her much more sympathetic, if a little less engaging. But in a world of hypocrites and liars, it seems fitting that she's just swimming with the current. And she's likably strong-willed, since she never lets anything stop her for long.Witherspoon, however, does an excellent job with a slightly different interpretation of Sharp. Though a few moments -- such as when Becky's husband dumps her -- are rather fake, overall Witherspoon seems to be relishing being a wily social-climber. Romola Garai gives a solid performance as Becky's pal; and Eileen Atkins is enormous fun as the hypocritical Mathilda. And while Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has a faux-hawk (huh?), he's pretty good.Mira Nair's ""Vanity Fair"" isn't without its flaws, but it's still a voluptous, sensuous drama.

866224,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0006FO8E8,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[4, 6]","""Vanity Fair"" is a great movie, but it's one of those great movies that I will never see again. It's great the first time, because everything that you are experiencing is new and fresh, but I warn you that it is not something that you could see again and again. I loved it, mostly because of Reese Whitherspoon. She was a revalation in this movie, and I am seeing that alot this year, especially with Jamie Foxx in ""Ray,"" but all I hear about that preformance is praise. ""Vanity Fair"" is one of those period dramas, and it's one of the best I've seen. An other really good one that comes to mind is ""Gosford Park,""  but this one focuses more on the social classes of the time, and less on murder, but they are two different movies. I'm talking about the way it is shot. Period dramas could be tricky, because you have to make sure that you mastered the time period. You can't have the wrong kind of dress, because there are always people that will nick-pick it. It's like ""Troy."" I cannot name one History or English teacher I know that does not say something about it being all wrong, and not accurate to history and literature. The history I could understand, but it's impossible to make a movie exactly like a book. I just loved the look of the film, and it's really something to see on the big screen. The other thing that was great to give this film five stars was the acting. Reese Whitherspoon has finally left the comedy perch, and expanded herself a little. I mean, one can only see her play that ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" character so many times, and I want to see more of her. I can see some kind of nomination for her in the future, but maybe not for this movie. I might be a little easy on giving this movie such a good rating, but it is worth seeing.Reese Whitherspoon plays Becky Sharp, who in the early 19th century in merry, little old England, has just left an all girl school, and her friend, so that she could become the governess of the children of Sir Pitt Crawley. Although he runs the house, his sister Matilda is the one that handles the money, and begins to take a liking to Becky. Matilda gives her an invitation to her home in London, and there she sees her old friend Amelia again. Amelia has a bit of drama unfolding in her life, because she wants to marry George Osborne, whose father wants him to marry into rich. Amelia isn't doing so well with her pursuit, but is always ignoring the man who really loves her, William. Years past, and Becky marries Mr. Pitt's son Rawdon, and war from Napolean begins to suffer various people. Becky's achievements of climbing the social ladder begins to pay off, when she meets Marques de Steyne, who bought a painting that her father made years ago, and begins to take a liking to her, which could lead to more problems.The basic plot is the climb of Becky up the social ladder. She does achieve much throughout the film, but she is always striving for more. She wants to be at the top, and nothing is veer good enough. Rhys Ifans plays William, and he is always a likable guy, as he proved in the great, but underrated ""Danny Deckchair,"" and you always feel bad for him. His crush on Amelia lasts for years before something becomes out in the open, but you could feel his pain. Everybody has been in that situation, maybe not for years, but at some point in their life. The problem with some of these period dramas is that things happened back then that are not a main factor in our life today. For example, we don't have this immense social ladder in our time, so we have to make characters that we could relate to, and that is what William is. They do this so well, and you never notice it sometimes, and that's what makes the film loveable. Director Mira Nair made this movie with such talent, that I would like to see some of her other films, and whoever shot the film should be handed an award. I just loved the visual parts of this movie, and Reese Whitherspoon gets a big thumbs up in my book.

866225,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0006FO8E8,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","In many ways, director Mira Nair (The Namesake) is a daring, imaginative choice to helm this 2004 film adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray'sclassic novelof social mores in early 19th century England. However, the end result of her vision is on the whole, rather disappointing. What could have been an energetic distillation of the book's themes turns into a lengthy episodic movie suffering from poor pacing and softened characters. It is a feast for the eyes though, as it appears Nair is intent on bringing her native India into the film as much as possible from the brightly colored period costumes to the contemporary-looking exotic dance at the Marquess of Steyne's party (with very anachronistic Rai music in the background) to the happy ending atop an elephant in Jodhpur. All these references remain true to the Calcutta-born author's story, and actually they feed into the English imagination of what India meant to them at the time.At the same time, the images are too overwhelming to make the basic story of Becky Sharp resonate as it should. Her evolution is the heart of the story, as she moves from finishing school outsider to resourceful governess to brave captain's wife to fallen woman in a casino. It's a long, rocky journey, almost too long for a 137-minute movie to bear as it turns out. Nair, however, also has a good handle on the comic banter among the characters, and it certainly helps that she has assembled a ""Who's Who"" of British stage and film in all the roles except the primary one.  As Becky, Reese Witherspoon gives it a valiant effort and perfects her British accent to Gwyneth Paltrow's standards, but she seems to be channeling a hybrid of her Elle Woods (Legally Blonde) and her Tracy Flick (in Alexander Payne'sElection) by way of Kate Winslet inSense & Sensibility. When facing down her opponents in her climb upward, especially in the early scenes, the performance seems right. But when her character takes on Scarlett O'Hara dimensions in wartime suffering and acts of betrayal, she seems young and overwhelmed, and her reactions come across as too modern to be true to the character's evolution as intended.This anomaly results in a Becky Sharp who is not so much an ambitious social climber but a plucky heroine for the underclasses, a textbook example of a Tony Robbins motivational seminar. This transformation may seem endearing to those looking for nicely wrapped tales of triumph against all odds, but it doesn't lend credibility to the more pointed satire and harsher criticisms that Thackeray had in mind when he wrote the book. For example, Becky's gambler husband, Rawdon Crawley, is really more of a ne'er-do-well whose departure in the story should be viewed somewhat as relief, but as played by James Purefoy, he is a romantic figure who is guilt-ridden over his failure to provide for his family. The change could have been acceptable were it not for the fact that his character is discarded in an almost matter-of-fact way. The same sketchy treatment is given to Becky's only friend, Amelia Sedley, played by Romola Garai, who is set up as a contrast to Becky and comes across as a wet rag for much of the story. But the film transforms her into a brave widow whose romantic resolution at the end strains credibility. Somehow Purefoy and Garai acquit themselves admirably regardless.There are many fine performances in the smaller roles. Worth mentioning are Jim Broadbent as roguish George Osborne's unforgiving father, Bob Hoskins as the clownishly pitiable Sir Pitt; Gabriel Byrne as the territorially devious Marquess of Steyne, and Geraldine McEwan's helium-voiced Lady Southdown. Best of all is the mordantly witty Eileen Atkins, who seems to understand the tone of Thackeray's story better than anyone else, and lends a dotty authority to the role of Aunt Mathilde, serving as the primary catalyst of Becky's social escalation much to her later regret. Great acting aside, the film's length does have a wearing effect since the climax does not bear the emotional weight of everything that has gone before it, and unfortunately the plot strands get wrapped up much too quickly at the end to make the story truly resonate. That's a shame since there is so much creative energy obviously at work here. As for the extras on the 2005 DVD, the major inclusion is Nair's illuminating commentary, which focuses more on the technical aspects of the film. There are also two featurettes - the first is ""Welcome to Vanity Fair"", a behind-the-scenes look at the production that appears to be a marketing tool to convince viewers of the contemporary nature of the story, and the second ""The Women of Vanity Fair"", which focuses on Nair's largely female crew.",3,Curry-Flavored Thackeray With an Incongruous Lead,1206662400,"03 28,

It's cases like these that the say is true that the book is always better than the movie--especially when the book in question is a classic. Of course, you can't always expect the movie to quite stack up to the book, but I must say that I was disappointed by this adaptation.Reese Witherspoon plays Becky Sharpe, the orphan girl who aspires to rise higher than her station in life. She then spends time with her friend Amelia's Sedley's family, along with Amelia's fianc&eacute;e, the arrogant George Osborne (played by a beautiful but miscast Jonathan Rhys Myers). Later, Becky goes to be the governess for the Crawleys, where she meets Rawdon and runs away with him. Becky's tale gets overshadowed in the second half of both the novel and the movie as Napoleon threatens to invade.The exoticness of India and the bucolic setting of England make fine contrasts for one another, and the costumes in this period piece are beautiful (though oddly enough, in this movie, fashions don't change from the 1810s to the 1830s, and the characters don't seem to age much, either). But the actors seem a little too modern at times (especially Reese Witherspoon). The tone of Thackeray's novel was sarcastic at times, and the character of Jos Sedley was so ridiculous that he was actually pathetic. Here, he's just another bland, boring character. George Osbourne was much more malicious in the novel. It's a very watered-down version of the book, especially since Becky in this movie is shown to be a sympathetic character. And it just doesn't work.

In the case of VANITY FAIR this nineteenth century novel by Thackeray has found its place on the stage, in various versions of publications and on at least one other film version.  There is a reason for the popularity of this work: it is a finely paced examination of the social mores of the time and introduces one of the first 'feminists' in the embodiment of Rebecca Sharp.The story is well known and can be summarized as follows:  young lass born of humble parents (her father an artist, her mother an opera singer) is placed in a home upon the death of her parents - an orphan set upon the world.  Upon reaching proper age she is released into the home of the Crawleys as a governess and quickly charms this odd family of mixed sorts (Eileen Atkins, Bob Hoskins, James Purefoy, Douglas Hodge, Meg Wynn Owen, etc) into seeing that she has potential despite her lack of 'breeding'.  She wiles her way into the arms of Rawdon Crawley and marries him only to discover this is unacceptable social movement.  She has a child, but as her life develops she eventually leaves her child in the care of her closest friend Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai).  Rebecca sails to the heights of wealth and then falls back to the streets on enough occasions  to finally find her as a 'singer/performer' in a less than respectable place in Germany. Along the way she ha meaningful encounters with characters portrayed by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Rhys Ifans, Gabriel Byrne, Jim Broadbent - a veritable call schedule of some of England' finest actors.  The tale bends and weaves and whirls and changes like so many of the novels of this period.  But always at the core of the message is the inequality of class and the futility of striving after vanity and acclaim when not born into that stratum.Reese Witherspoon gives a dazzling performance as Rebecca Sharp. She looks the part, sounds the part, and manages to maintain our empathy if not sympathy through practically every frame of this two and a half hour film. With this role she becomes an actress who will demand attention.  The sets and costumes are brilliant, the photography is moody and celebratory, and the pacing of direction by the gifted Mira Nair makes this tale of an amoral woman sparkle and spin past our eyes in a film that seems almost too short!  The DVD adds an alternative ending (one that is more apropos that the one given in the film itself) and several other featurettes that are worth watching.  Well worth your time and attention.

866236,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0006FO8E8,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 4]","William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" fairly explodes onto the screen in a blaze of flamboyant color, sumptuous period costumes, a gazillion characters, multiple plots, and sardonic wit which impales British society, the class system and the nouveau riche who buy their titles. The infamous Becky Sharp, orphaned daughter of a talented English painter and a French opera singer, has been educated at a school for wealthy and titled young woman. She worked as a servant there. The lessons were a perk. Becky is beautiful, a talented singer and fluent in French. More importantly,  she is sharp as a tack! We never know if she was born shrewd and ruthless, or if circumstances made her so, but she is determined to make a place in society for herself - and when Becky is determined, look out!Set in England during the last stage of the Napoleonic Wars, Director Mira Nair and writers Matthew Faulk, Mark Skeet and Julian Fellowes take their characters from the bucolic English countryside to the decaying estate of a noble family, from cosmopolitan London ballrooms and drawing rooms to the Battle of Waterloo, and finally to exotic India, where, in fact, Mr. Thackeray was born. His father worked for the East Indian Company and the influence of the subcontinent is evident in this particular film, lending energy and freshness to what could have been just another staid version of the novel.Like the book, the movie juxtaposes the lives of two young women, Becky, (Reese Witherspoon) and her best friend from school, Amelia Sedley, (Romola Garai). Becky who begins with little but the clothes on her back, and a position as governess, seems to always land on her feet. She is a social climber and a schemer, but nevertheless she is always a sympathetic character, as she tries to get ahead in the world. One character says of Becky, """"I thought she was a social climber, but she's a mountaineer."" The kindly, caring Amelia, who starts out in life as a wealthy, well-positioned young lady, never quite makes it, however. See what happens to nice girls!The cast of characters is superb. Reese Witherspoon plays a spunky, feisty Becky, and is a more sympathetic person than Thackeray's young woman of the same name. The vulgar Sir Pitt Crawley, (Bob Hoskins), a smarmy aristocrat who hires our protagonist as governess, makes one's skin crawl, appropriately. Rawdon Crawley, (James Purefoy), the elegant gambler and soldier, is Sir Pitt's second son. When he marries Becky secretly, much misfortune ensues, of the disinheritance kind. The callow George Osborne, (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is the love of Amelia's life, and Rhys Ifans plays William Dobbin, who is willing to sacrifice his happiness for Amelia's. Gabriel Byrne is the Marquess of Steyne, connoisseur of find art and of the married Rebecca. The rest of the cast is wonderful but too numerous to mention here.The film moves along at a good pace until, shortly after the halfway point, early 19th century England collides with 21st century Las Vegas in a bizarre Bollywood-like musical number too comical for words. For me the ambiance was shattered. Everything is downhill from here and what begins as a taut satirical drama ends in a sloppy, rushed fashion. What could they have been thinking?

It combines the beauty of elegant costumes, sets and people with the disaster that is Mira Nair's adaptation of William Shakespear Thackery's novel. Not only is the adaptation bad but also so is what Nair has done with it. If you read the book, the movie will break your heart. It has completely ripped to shreds the pages of the classic story.If you haven't read the book and intend to waste your money on the film, I would recommend that first you read a couple of plot summaries of the novel. Otherwise, you may be very lost through no fault of your own but because there is no defining plot in the film.Mira Nair's direction is too present. She throws in too much of herself with the scenes about India and actually in India. Nair's inability to resist bringing in some Bollywood type scenes, particularly one involving Becky leading an Indian type dance, with Indian music, before the king, no less, and to thunderous applause. Where the hell is the point? There just seem to be times when Nair thought it was okay to throw in another shot of an elephant's ass or belly dancers or India food.Speaking of unwanted, Reese's second child was not credited in the closing credits but is in every scene Reese is. Witherspoon and the crew seemed to think they could hide the fact that she was pregnant by putting her in big clothes but that didn't work. She still looks pregnant and it ruins the effect the clothes should have had. It also puts the movie out of sequence. In one scene Reese is very large and in the next you can only see her belly if you look for it.Vanity Fair could have been brilliant. The material is there, Reese bring to the table the range that we have come to expect from her and a performance that could have taken her places if it had been used better. But the fact remains that there are too many moments where ends just don't meet and the audience is confused to the point where the film can't rely on its pretty scenery to distract from its larger flaws. But most of these problems won't even be noted by someone who hasn't read the book, so if you haven't, go ahead and see it; you'll probably be entertained. And if you are someone like me who loves the book, you may not be able to resist seeing it anyway.

866239,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,B0006FO8E8,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[2, 5]","Vanity Fair, like most great films based on beloved novels, must be looked at separately from the novel to be appreciated. It is impossible to make great art without developing your own tone or thesis, and Mira Nair's adaptation of Vanity Fair is a great piece of art on its own.Reese Witherspoon--here is a lady, as others have said, born to play Becky Sharp!  Her interpretation is more vulnerable, some have said, than the Becky Sharp of the novel. A great actress always brings her own interpretation of a character, and Reese Witherspoon triumphs.  Her unconventional beauty and shining personality have never burned brighter, and in this film she proves herself more than box-office gold and a comedic actress, but a genuine dramatic actress to rival the likes of Nicole Kidman.The story, or at least Nair's interpretation of the story, is equally brilliant.  Here we have a main character, Becky Sharp, who we sympathize with, since she is born into the unfair caste system and society, where one is only as good as his ancestral lineage or bank account. It is still relevant today, because so much of your social position now depends on wealth and appearance.Becky Sharp, we discover, is more than a ""mere social climber"" but a ""mountaineer!""  She marries for love, but with a man in a social position much higher than her own.  He, in turn, is left out of the will of his wealthy aunt, leaving them both back on the poor side of the spectrum. Becky schemes to win the affection of a rich man who is prepared to give her anything, but in turn betrays and breaks the heart of her adoring husband. This was her flaw and her ultimate mistake, but the movie poses an important question.  Can we blame Becky for wanting more, given the intolerant society that surrounded her?Vanity Fair is an A+ adaptation of a timeless novel. Its theme is still relevant and powerful today.  The performances and production values are astonishing.  The music is poetic and lovely.  Although Reese Witherspoon may not see her Oscar this year, the Academy is now in her debt.",5,Reese in the role of her career,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,2061,"['Vanity', 'Fair', 'most', 'great', 'films', 'based', 'beloved', 'novels', 'must', 'be', 'looked', 'separately', 'novel', 'be', 'appreciated', 'impossible', 'make', 'great', 'art', 'developing', 'own', 'tone', 'thesis', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'adaptation', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'own.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'here', 'lady', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'born', 'play', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'interpretation', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'have', 'said', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'novel', 'great', 'actress', 'always', 'own', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'triumphs', 'unconventional', 'beauty', 'shining', 'personality', 'have', 'never', 'burned', 'brighter', 'film', 'more', 'box-office', 'gold', 'comedic', 'actress', 'genuine', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'rival', 'likes', 'Nicole', 'Kidman.The', 'story', 'least', 'Nair', 'interpretation', 'story', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Here', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'who', 'sympathize', 'born', 'unfair', 'caste', 'system', 'society', 'where', 'one', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'ancestral', 'lineage', 'bank', 'account', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'so', 'much', 'social', 'position', 'now', 'wealth', 'appearance.Becky', 'Sharp', 'discover', 'more', 'mere', 'social', 'climber', 'mountaineer', 'love', 'man', 'social', 'position', 'much', 'higher', 'own', 'turn', 'left', 'will', 'wealthy', 'aunt', 'leaving', 'back', 'poor', 'side', 'spectrum', 'Becky', 'win', 'affection', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'prepared', 'give', 'anything', 'turn', 'betrays', 'heart', 'adoring', 'husband', 'was', 'flaw', 'ultimate', 'mistake', 'movie', 'important', 'question', 'Can', 'blame', 'Becky', 'wanting', 'more', 'given', 'intolerant', 'society', 'surrounded', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'A+', 'adaptation', 'timeless', 'novel', 'theme', 'still', 'relevant', 'powerful', 'today', 'performances', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'astonishing', 'music', 'poetic', 'lovely', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Academy', 'now', 'debt']",N/A
866240,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0006FO8E8,kaduzy,"[0, 3]","I loved this movie, which I didn't expect.  I had never read the novel, and my interest in seeing it had more to do with the people involved.  I was not disappointed by any means with the film itself.  Witherspoon gives an amazing performance made even more jaw-dropping by the fact that she was so very, VERY pregnant for pretty much the entire movie.  Her pregnancy was worked into the script for a few scenes, but for the most part, they tried to hide it with costumes and oddly-placed or mighty convenient props, or simply made do by shooting her from the waist up.  However, her pregnancy gave her not only a glow (I've never thought of her as truly beautiful, but she looks just stunning in this movie) but also a pleasing curve and buxom-ness that not only went better with the period but was a welcome change from the typical Hollywood skinny actress.Fine performances abound; in fact no one was terrible or wasted.  But especial kudos must go to Bob Hoskins and Jim Broadbent because I adore them both and their brilliance is well used in this film.  And my hat is COMPLETELY off to Rhys Ifans!  I had no IDEA the man could act.  In EVERY movie I've ever seen him in, he's A) blonde and B) a complete buffon.  I'd written him off as a British Rob Schnieder or something.  Now I see how completely wrong I was.  His character had me from the moment he gave Amelia the piano, and from then on, Captain Dobbin became the hero of the film for me.  I know the novel's not supposed to have a hero, but Captain (later Major) Dobbin really filled the role neatly here, with his long-suffering but steadfast love.Having never read the novel, I am in a unique place to review the film.  I felt that at times it didn't seem quite period (one character uses the phrase ""suck up"") and it seemed to lack continuity in places (Witherspoon's hair shifts between blonde and strawberry blonde depending on the scene -- did they have colorists back then, or was something wrong with my T.V. screen?) but it was surprisingly funny, and I laughed out loud in places.  Best line: ""I had thought her a mere social climber.  I see now she's a mountaineer.""  I wanted that line to be the title of my review, but alas, someone beat me to it!  Another great one from father-in-law to daughter: ""There's no one in this family who doesn't wish you dead!""The colors in this film are striking, and the lavish costumes and art direction and set design take the breath away.  Kudos to Nair for eschewing the stodgy period palatte of black and grey and going full bore with a beautiful array of Indian-inspired finery.  Occasionally it all looks a bit too new and bright to be believed, even for upper class people (Their clothes couldn't have been THAT spotless!) but she's not afraid to hose 'em down or rip 'em up a little bit, so it's not too unrealistic.There are so many characters that I doubt all of them could have had a real resolution in one movie, and I've read book reviews saying that Thackery didn't give many of his characters real resolutions anyhow, so I guess that's par for the course.  But I was particularly disappointed about George's character.  He's played by the delectable Jonathan Rhys Myers (who scared me to death in ""Titus"" and made my heart flutter in ""Bend It Like Beckham"") but he is impossible to figure out.  He's a snobby aristocrat, but he won't marry for money alone.  He values honor, but he burns the pictures his fiancee sends him.  He seems to have nothing but contempt for Amelia but he takes her to wife, and then (SPOILER!) he dies before we can investigate these contradictions.  The fact that his scenes with Witherspoon are wonderful to watch, and among the best in the film only fanned the flame of my curiosity about this character, so I was very very disappointed to see him gone so soon.Witherspoon's relationship with Rawden is well written and even better played by two fine actors.  I regret only that Witherspoon's pregnancy prevented her from doing more passionate things with the love scenes.  I don't mean nudity, but he obviously had to be careful how he handled her, and it made things a bit awkward.  Amelia's character seemed a bit lifeless not just compared to Becky but on the whole.  I felt she could have been more interesting, but then I am biased because I loved Dobbin so well.This movie has a strong resemblance to ""Gone With the Wind.""  I guess Mitchell must have been a fan!  She does mention Thackery in her book (Melanie to Ashley: ""I like Mr. Thackery, but I fear he is not the gentleman Mr. Dickens is."") so it stands to reason that she would have borrowed a few things.  Rhett's first reply to Scarlett's long delayed confession of love is ""That's your misfortune,"" and Rawden repeats it here in a similar scene when he finally tires of Becky's antics.  He also tells someone else that ""Cats are better mothers"" than Becky, another Rhett-ism I thought Mitchell coined.  Ah well, live and learn.  It's still a great book!I have rambled for a long time on the movie, but the reason for my subtracting a star has to do with the DVD which I will finally talk about now.  There are no real extras!  There's a commentary, but it's actually just the director sharing various observations along the lines of ""I really like this shot"" and ""this actor is so good"" -- in other words, the usual dirctor's commentary B.S.  No wonder Spielberg won't do this stuff.  There's chapter selection, but this 2.5 hour movie is given only 18 chapters!  This gross oversight forces the viewer to make rather a meal of finding a particular scene.  There's also a half-assed ""making of"" doc that's really not so much ""making of"" as ""here's a look at some of the people involved and what they have to say about the movie.""  Then there's an even shorter one on the women involved.  Interesting, yes, but I for one am equally as interested in the men, and the doc didn't tell me much of anything informative that hadn't already been covered in the other one.  There are deleted scenes, but they have no commentary, and they're all played at once instead of letting the viewer decide which ones to watch.  I hate it when DVDs do that!  The first one is an alternate opening credits sequence which to me seemed indistinguishable from the original.  Therefore I viewed with the trepidation the so-called ""alternate ending"" -- DVDs are always touting this, and it usually turns out to be the same ending with different music or merely features the hero in a different color shirt.  However, this one really was totally different.  In the ""real"" ending (SPOILER!) Becky goes off to India with Amelia's weird brother.  (I say ""real"" because apparently it's not that way in the book.  But it works here.)  The alternate one features Amelia going to her brother-in-law's funeral to try and reconnect with her son, who forgives her for abandoning him.  In the first ending, we're lead to believe that she's washed her hands of the boy.  I like the second one better.  It features an extremely cheesy speech, but it also features her grown-up son, who's HOT and who I was curious to get a look at.  Also, forgiveness is divine -- and that's why I forgive the filmmakers for this lame DVD and plan to buy it anyway.",4,If only this DVD had half of Becky's ambition . . .,1122422400,"07 27,

866243,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0006FO8E8,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 6]","Identity usually relates to an individual's parents, the values transmitted by the parents, and the experiences acquired throughout life by the individual.  Peoples' choices of life experience were rather limited in 19th century England where the people were more or less assigned to a spot in society based on who the identity of their birth parents was.  Women's' choices were even more restricted, especially so if the birth parents had passed away during childhood.  If girls without parents were lucky they ended up in a decent orphanage, and a decent orphanage during the 19th century was crude and dirty compared to modern standards.  If a woman would try to climb the social ladder it was considered ridiculous and a lack of good manner.In William Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair the reader can follow the orphan Rebecca `Becky' Sharp struggle to make her life better than it was for her departed father, a talented painter with modest success.  Mira Nair undertakes the big task of recreating the fictional masterpiece in a period film where Becky (Reese Witherspoon) decides to climb in society without consideration of upper-class notions.  The film goes to great lengths in order to depict the social hierarchy, which is often illustrated through a person's family history.  Becky's awareness of the aristocratic rules is considerable, as she displays social dexterity when she maneuvers the dangers grounds of the upper class.Vanity Fair opens with a scene where the Marquess of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne) walks through a dirty neighborhood in order to get to Becky's father's studio where he paints.  Marquess of Steyne's intention is to obtain a painting that he had ordered, for the meager sum of four Guinness.  Becky, who is just a child at this time, says ten Guinness, as it is a painting of her late mother and she has a strong emotional connection to the painting.  Ten Guinness is given to her, which leaves her staring at Marquess of Steyne walking out with the painting.  This moment seems to be a crucial part of the film, as it seems to be the source for Becky's ambition to climb in the social hierarchy and become a part of the rich and known.The story follows Becky's precise choices and steps throughout her attempt to advance in society.  First she tries to sway her friend Amelia Sedley's (Romola Garai) brother to fall for her, as she sees an opportunity to take her first step upwards.  This attempt, however, fails as Amelia's fianc&eacute; George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) tells her brother that it is not proper to try to marry a woman of Becky's status.  Despite Becky's first failure she is not disheartened as she seeks new opportunity in Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins) through who she meets Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy).  Through the Crawley's she finds a way to advance in society, as she steps into the family circle uninvited.  This brings the audience on a journey where Becky is faced with further opportunity to advance, but is also caused much pain and suffering.Vanity Fair is shot in bright and vibrant colors, which is often enhanced by the many flamboyant costumes that the characters are wearing.  This depicts a strong sense of vanity and arrogance that exists among the aristocrats during the time when the story takes place.  The vanity is also enhanced through the mise-en-scene, which provides insights into what seems to be important.  For example, there are wads of bills exchanged between men during gambling, extravagant dresses, and rooms with excessive d&eacute;cor and paintings to display wealth.  In many aspects, this is what is expected out of a period film, which can be seen in Vatel (2000) and Dangerous Liaisons (1988).The cinematography is stunning and a pleasure to the eye with its use of colors and camerawork.  Nair does a brilliant job in the opening of the film where she uses a peakcock and other symbols for vanity to prompt the audience in the direction of the film.  However, the story feels a little too contemporary at times, which does not bring the effect a period film should.  In addition, the moral values and lessons of the film seem to dominat through the extensive use of mise-en-scene and what else is within the frame of each shot, which also is purposely done due to the vanity of the society.  Nonetheless, Nair offers the audience a good cinematic experience in regards to socioeconomic position in a 19th century society, which is full of insightful notions.",4,Visually Stunning Illustration of Social Climbing...,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,4460,"['Identity', 'usually', 'individual', 'parents', 'values', 'transmitted', 'parents', 'experiences', 'acquired', 'life', 'individual', 'Peoples', 'choices', 'life', 'experience', 'were', 'rather', 'limited', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'assigned', 'spot', 'society', 'based', 'who', 'identity', 'birth', 'parents', 'was', 'Women', 'choices', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'restricted', 'especially', 'so', 'birth', 'parents', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'childhood', 'girls', 'parents', 'were', 'lucky', 'ended', 'up', 'decent', 'orphanage', 'decent', 'orphanage', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'crude', 'dirty', 'compared', 'modern', 'standards', 'woman', 'would', 'try', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'was', 'considered', 'ridiculous', 'lack', 'good', 'manner.In', 'William', 'Thackeray', 'novel', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'reader', 'can', 'follow', 'orphan', 'Rebecca', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'struggle', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'was', 'departed', 'father', 'talented', 'painter', 'modest', 'success', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'big', 'task', 'recreating', 'fictional', 'masterpiece', 'period', 'film', 'where', 'Becky', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'climb', 'society', 'consideration', 'upper-class', 'notions', 'film', 'great', 'lengths', 'order', 'depict', 'social', 'hierarchy', 'often', 'illustrated', 'person', 'family', 'history', 'Becky', 'awareness', 'aristocratic', 'rules', 'considerable', 'social', 'dexterity', 'when', 'dangers', 'grounds', 'upper', 'class.Vanity', 'Fair', 'scene', 'where', 'Marquess', 'Steyne', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'walks', 'dirty', 'neighborhood', 'order', 'get', 'Becky', 'father', 'studio', 'where', 'Marquess', 'Steyne', 'intention', 'obtain', 'painting', 'had', 'ordered', 'meager', 'sum', 'four', 'Guinness', 'Becky', 'who', 'just', 'child', 'time', 'ten', 'Guinness', 'painting', 'late', 'mother', 'strong', 'emotional', 'connection', 'painting', 'Ten', 'Guinness', 'given', 'staring', 'Marquess', 'Steyne', 'walking', 'out', 'painting', 'moment', 'be', 'crucial', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'source', 'Becky', 'ambition', 'climb', 'social', 'hierarchy', 'become', 'part', 'rich', 'known.The', 'story', 'Becky', 'precise', 'choices', 'steps', 'attempt', 'advance', 'society', 'First', 'sway', 'friend', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'brother', 'fall', 'opportunity', 'take', 'first', 'step', 'upwards', 'attempt', 'however', 'Amelia', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'George', 'Osborne', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'brother', 'not', 'proper', 'try', 'marry', 'woman', 'Becky', 'status', 'Becky', 'first', 'failure', 'not', 'disheartened', 'new', 'opportunity', 'Sir', 'Pitt', 'Crawley', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'who', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'Crawley', 'way', 'advance', 'society', 'family', 'circle', 'uninvited', 'audience', 'journey', 'where', 'Becky', 'faced', 'further', 'opportunity', 'advance', 'also', 'caused', 'much', 'pain', 'suffering.Vanity', 'Fair', 'shot', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'often', 'enhanced', 'many', 'flamboyant', 'costumes', 'characters', 'are', 'wearing', 'strong', 'sense', 'vanity', 'arrogance', 'aristocrats', 'time', 'when', 'story', 'place', 'vanity', 'also', 'enhanced', 'mise-en-scene', 'insights', 'what', 'be', 'important', 'example', 'are', 'wads', 'bills', 'exchanged', 'men', 'gambling', 'extravagant', 'dresses', 'rooms', 'excessive', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'paintings', 'display', 'wealth', 'many', 'aspects', 'what', 'expected', 'period', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Vatel', '2000', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', '1988', '.The', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'pleasure', 'eye', 'use', 'colors', 'camerawork', 'Nair', 'brilliant', 'job', 'opening', 'film', 'where', 'peakcock', 'other', 'symbols', 'vanity', 'prompt', 'audience', 'direction', 'film', 'However', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'contemporary', 'times', 'not', 'bring', 'effect', 'period', 'film', 'should', 'addition', 'moral', 'values', 'lessons', 'film', 'seem', 'dominat', 'extensive', 'use', 'mise-en-scene', 'what', 'else', 'frame', 'shot', 'also', 'purposely', 'done', 'due', 'vanity', 'society', 'Nonetheless', 'Nair', 'audience', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'regards', 'socioeconomic', 'position', '19th', 'century', 'society', 'full', 'insightful', 'notions']",N/A

866246,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0006FO8E8,Larry VanDeSande,"[6, 7]","As is the norm for new millennium films taken from century old novels, this verion of ""Vanity Fair"" does not do much to portray its source novel in any significant way. It fails in that regard in the same way the newest ""Pearl Harbor"" failed in dispatching the real world story about the outbreak of World War II.Where does it succeed? While a historic and literary bust, the film is a feast for the eye and senses taht will satisfy you with its lush production, wonderful costumes, invigorating period music, and strong character portrayals by its two leading ladies. These are the qualities that carry this film and make it what it is -- an engaging slice of life taken from a famous novel.Gabriel Byrne, the biggest name in the cast, either is poorly directed or is a poor actor in this movie. No one will confuse Reese Witherspoon with Meryl Streep as an actress. Witherspoon lacks the depth of character a great actress would bring to the role of Becky Sharp. Still, she elicits a nice performance of the upwardly mobile young woman whose fall from grace is expected and occurs on cue.As a fan of the music of Franz Josef Haydn, I can tell you Witherspoon is not a professional singer. Her one turn with a Hadyn song, toward the end fo the film, shows she can carry a tune but is consistently late in entries with a strong tendency to sing behind the beat. These are not the qualities of a fine period singer circa 1805.But, alas, she looks wonderful doing it and that is, by my perspective, the summary of this film: it looks wonderful all the time. All the young men in this flick are beautiful and have their hair done like Beethoven's in his famous young portrait. The film is sumptuous eye candy of a time in life that seems very romantic to us today...when it probably was anything but romantic in reality.So enjoy the consistent eye candy production and try to follow the inane script. You'll figure out what's going on all the time even if the script doesn't help you along the way.

866248,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006FO8E8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[84, 95]","""Ah! Vanitas Vanitatum! which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?""William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair,"" first published serially in 1847-48, tells the story of the fortunes of two women, the ambitious and amoral Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a struggling painter and a French opera singer, and the passive Amelia Sedley, the wellborn but sheltered daughter of rich merchant.  The two young women meet at Miss Pinkerton's Academy for young ladies, where Becky is a tutor of French and Amelia a student, and become friends.  We then follow their intertwined lives as Jane tries to climb the social ladder and Amelia follows the dictates of her heart.  ""Vanity Fair"" is celebrated for Thackeray's disparaging and negative portrait of the upper classes of early 19th-century England.  The characters are rather vile, the relationships are hopelessly doomed, and readers who were not the targets of Thackeray's pen have enjoyed it ever since.The BBC did its most reason mini-series version of ""Vanity Fair"" in 1998 with Natasha Little as Becky Sharp (Little plays Lady Jane Sheepshanks in this version), having done in 1987 with Eve Matheson and in 1967 with Susan Hampshire.  This version has Reese Witherspoon playing Becky Sharp, and while having an American actress play the young woman trying to get into English society does translate into a sense that she is clearly on the outside, she does not really convey the amorality of the character.  In this version of ""Vanity Fair"" Becky comes across as mild rather than sharp.  This is not because such a characterization is an inevitable result when a story that is perfectly suited to the length of a mini-series is cut down to a 2 hour and 20 minute movie, but rather because director Mira Nair (""Monsoon Wedding"") and Witherspoon want Becky to be more likeable.  However, given that this results in Becky losing her edge, I think it ends up being the film's flaw.Becky first sets her sight on Joseph Sedley (Tony Maudsley), Amelia's rather simple brother, but discovers that marrying up into a family that is trying to do the same thing is impossible.  So she moves on to be the governess in the house of Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins), where she finds someone who appreciates her in Miss Matilda Crawley (Eileen Atkins).  Feeling secure enough to make her move, she focuses her attention on Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy), Sir Pitt's second son.  When Becky tells Rawdon that the only two men who will enter her bedroom are her husband and the doctor he quickly calculates the time involved, takes stock of his own meager abilities, and decides to sneak off and find a minister rather than go to medical school.  Unfortunately, the family does not greet the marriage with any joy and Rawdon, who is a compulsive gambler, becomes the quicksand upon which Becky builds her ascent into English society.Becky Sharp has long been considered the prototype for Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara, but Thackeray's heroine is at a disadvantage in that the closest thing she has to a Rhett Butler is the creepy Marquis of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne).  But then the subtitle for the novel was ""A Novel Without a Hero.""  This is not to say that there are not decent blokes running around, but the best of the bunch, William Dobbin (Rhys Ifans), ends up suffering the most.  He is in love with Amelia and she takes no more note of his earnest affection and honorable attention than she does the considerable shortcomings of her beloved George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who is arrogantly self-absorbed.Amelia is Becky's counterpart in the narrative, but she is reduced to a supporting role simply because for most of the story she is an impoverished widow.  While Becky makes her tentative advances into society, Amelia's life becomes depressingly stagnant.  It is only in the fate of their sons that the parallel between the two really continues, until the film's climax where their last interaction has a profound affect on the final fate of each character.  Nair provides a deus ex machina to add a bit more of a happy ending to Thackeray's novel, but that makes sense given the way Becky Sharp is written and performed in this film.This version of ""Vanity Fair"" is a beautiful film, as English costume dramas tend to be.  Because she was born in India, just as Thackeray was, Nair introduces visual elements of that culture into the film to make it a bit different from what we have seen before.  Yet it is the subdued version of Becky Sharp that ultimately defines the film.  When you find yourself wondering if Becky has really become Steyne's mistress or not, you know that this movie is cleaning up her image a bit too much.  There is agreement that Reese Witherspoon is a nice person but she lets too much of that inherent niceness color Becky Sharp and the idea that Scarlett O'Hara is a literary descendant is lost.",4,Reese Witherspoon is more Becky Mild than Becky Sharp,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,4932,"['Ah', 'Vanitas', 'Vanitatum', 'happy', 'world', 'Which', 'desire', 'having', 'satisfied', 'William',

866249,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0006FO8E8,Lawyeraau,"[6, 8]","In the role of Becky Sharp, Reese Witherspoon is the linchpin around which this production revolves.  Set in nineteenth century England, the film tells the story of Becky Sharpe, a grasping and resourceful beauty, who is determined to avoid the vicissitudes of fate destined for women like her, educated but bereft of family and fortune. While Becky Sharpe is a literary character that everyone traditionally loves to hate, Ms. Witherspoon infuse her with  almost too much  charm, and the screenplay divests her of some of her most morally jarring moments.  Therein lies the rub. The character loses much of what it was that made her memorable. Consequently, this is a watered down, eviscerated version of  the character, which causes a major weakness in the film.Becky, who is an orphan, contrives to scheme and plot her way into society, grasping and avaricious in her desire to climb the social ladder, letting nothing or anyone get in her way. While visiting her best friend, the well-to-do Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai), Becky plans to snare her best friend's socially inept, older brother, Joseph (Tony Maudsley), who is a civil servant for the British Empire in India.  Her plan fails, foiled by Amelia's snobbish and callow fiance, George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys Meyers),  but Becky takes her failure in stride. Leaving her friend's home, she goes to work as a governess in the disheveled  household of Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins). There, she meets his enormously wealthy sister, Mathilda (Eileen Atkins), and leaves Sir Pitt Crawley's employ to go and work as her companion. They get along swimmingly, until Becky marries her nephew, Sir Pitt's handsome and dashing second son, Rawdon (James Purefoy), whom his aunt promptly disinherits, a fact unbeknownst to the besotted couple.Although Becky's star is seemingly on the ascendant,  that of the naive Amelia is on the wane, her family having lost their fortune, ruined by the nefarious dealings of her fiance's father (Jim Broadbent).  While George initially stays away, leaving Amelia to be comforted by his friend, the kind, good, and faithful Lt. William Dobbin (Rhys Ifans), George ultimately marries her, as he feels that,  as a gentleman, he should do so. Love or compassion never enters the equation with him.  Becky and Amelia now accompany their respective husbands to Brussels, as their husbands are both in the military during the Napoleonic Wars. At the Battle of Waterloo, the die is cast as to their respective fates.Once reunited, Becky and Rawdon return to England, living a lavish lifestyle well beyond their means. They then discover his Aunt Mathilda's perfidy upon her death, and their carefully constructed well-to-do facade crumbles around them. While playing a dangerous game of love with  one of her many male admirers, the cynical Marquess of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne), who provides financial succor, she finds herself in a compromising position that causes her marriage to go belly up. Becky ultimately finds herself worse off than when she started, having lost everything.After many years, Becky, now on the skids, ultimately comes face to face with her old friend, Amelia, with whom she appears to have lost touch. She sees that Amelia, however, is living a lie, having deified her now dead husband to the exclusion of her true admirer and secret benefactor, the long suffering Lt. Dobbin. So, Becky performs a charitable act by putting to right something that has gone wrong and restoring to Amelia the only chance she has left at finding happiness. In doing so, Becky finds redemption and a semblance of happiness for herself.  The ending is one that Thackeray never envisioned, although in the context of the film, it almost makes sense, given the way that that the Becky Sharpe character has been reshaped.This 2004 production boasts a stellar good cast, as well as lush costumes and visually stunning cinematography. Moreover, by interjecting the flavor of India throughout the film, the director is not only paying homage to her own Indian roots, but also to those of William Makepeace Thackeray. He was born in India and lived there for the first six years of his life, as his father was employed by the British East India Company. Much of this works, with the exception of the outrageous Bollywood song and dance number. While interesting in the absolute, it casts too dissonant a note in the film, as it is contra to anything a self-respecting nineteenth century woman, especially one as determined to better her social position as Becky is, would do. Although Becky is an audacious character, her audacity is geared towards securing a better position in society, not undermining the precarious one that she already holds.The film suffers, overall, from a screenplay that has excised those traits that made Becky Sharp such a memorable literary character. This causes the script to not make sense, at times. When, towards the end of the film,  Lt. Dobbin rales against the evil and wicked Becky Sharp, the viewer wonders what on earth he is talking about. While Reese Witherspoon's Becky Sharp is one that is cunning and uses poor judgment, at times, there is nothing truly wicked or evil about her. Notwithstanding this, it is still an enjoyable period piece, although certainly not the best adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's famous novel of the same name. Having seen and loved all of director Mira Nair's films, this one is her weakest. At the heart of the problem is not her direction, however, but rather a screenplay that chose to materially change the essence of the lead character.",4,SHE IS NO MERE SOCIAL CLIMBER...SHE IS A

The period details are wonderful and I loved the costumes and the lavish settings of the English countryside.  It's a story of a woman, a daughter of a penniless artist, who rises to the upper class through manipulation and marriage.  Her name is Becky Sharp, and Reese Witherspoon is cast in the role.  It's a good story although I soon grew tired of the constant snobbery.  But the script was excellent and a fine actress could have made me care. Alas, Reese Witherspoon was just not up to it.  She's certainly pretty, but her acting skills are limited.  Throughout, there is only one emotion displayed - that of cunning and gumption.  This made me dislike her character throughout the film even though there were parts where she could have evoked some sympathy.  Everyone else in the cast did admirable jobs, but because of her one-dimensional interpretation, the story became tedious and an effort to continue watching.

866251,A2W7C0V4G36EB9,B0006FO8E8,LK,"[31, 33]","This would have been a fun movie to watch if it weren't for the fact that I was expecting Vanity Fair, by William Thackery.I disagree that it was a fast-forwarding through the book.  It was a gross misinterpretation of the book, of Becky, most specifically.We are urged into feeling deep sympathy for poor Becky by seeing little girl Becky in all her unloved half-orphan (and then very soon, full-orphaned) state.  And as a mother to two daughters, that tugged on my heartstrings.However - this is not the Becky Sharp that Thackery wrote about.Becky Sharp went for the soft underbelly.She loathed Amelia Sedley - perhaps because Amelia was so kind to her. Broken early on, Becky could not accept that kindness without resentment and rage.  Amelia's charity (which isn't seen in the movie) served to fuel Becky's contempt and hatred.  Becky's avid (and successful) attempts at making George Osborne fall for her was spurred on not only by George's initial insolence and destruction of her marital plans with Jos, but also by her anger and resentment towards Amelia.Thackery's Becky is not a caricature - she has real depth, and although she mostly enjoys twisting the screws into Amelia's thumbs, she also can't help but pity her, and when it finally comes down to it, loses patience and pushes her towards Dobbin by revealing George's indiscretion.  It is one of her few acts of selfless kindness. It seems at this point, she is weary of the whole game. But then again, she is much older and a bit wiser.In addition to hurting Amelia, Becky deliberately sets out to hurt many others - anyone who has slighted Becky is in danger. She mocks, mimics, and often goes for the figurative throat in an attempt to ruffle her injured feathers.Much of her anger and feelings make sense in the context of her life, and I can almost forgive her that.  It is her treatment of her son that paints her in a more horrifying light.In the book her utter negligence and contemptuous attitude towards her son are held up in stark counterpoint to her loving behavior towards Rawdon, Senior.  In the movie, she actuall seems mildly upset that Lord Steyne has bullied her into sending Rawdie away - placing her hand against the window, giving the boy the sweet smile.  Not so in the book.. She is relieved to be rid of him, he is a burden on her.There's a scene where little Rawdy, drawn by the angelic sounds of his mother singing, crashes the party only  to be stifled by Lord Steyne.  This scene is grossly underplayaed.  In the book, the scene is much more poignant - the boy yearns for his angelic mother to sing to him, but to him, she is never really there - she is harsh words or utter neglect.  Steynes actions in dismissing him from her presence come across as much harsher and strident against the child's innocent lack of understanding that no matter what he does, she will never love him.In the end, the boy gets love only from his devoted dad, and his loving aunt (and presumably uncle and cousins) who takes him in.In the movie, Becky is played up as a spunky victim - a woman who behaves somewhat deplorably, but ever so understandingly, and that is not the woman Thackery wrote about.I *do* have sympathy for Becky, even in the book - her life is a series of unpleasant moments, and one can understand why she treats others as she does - including her innocent child... but I don't really *like her*. The movie's Becky, by contrast, was almost likeable.  We see her as misguided, but in the end, Innocent... she has foolishly played with Lord Steyne, but never actually *wanted* the indiscretion that must accompany her debts to him.  He comes across the monster, and when Becky (in the movie) utters her innocence, we almost believe her.",3,Not really Vanity Fair,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,3732,"['would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'was', 'expecting', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'William', 'Thackery.I', 'disagree', 'was', 'fast-forwarding', 'book', 'was', 'gross', 'misinterpretation', 'book', 'Becky', 'most', 'specifically.We', 'are', 'urged', 'feeling', 'deep', 'sympathy', 'poor', 'Becky', 'seeing', 'little', 'girl', 'Becky', 'unloved', 'half-orphan', 'then', 'very', 'soon', 'full-orphaned', 'state', 'mother', 'two', 'daughters', 'tugged', 'heartstrings.However', 'not', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Thackery', 'wrote', 'about.Becky', 'Sharp', 'went', 'soft', 'underbelly.She', 'loathed', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'perhaps', 'Amelia', 'was', 'so', 'kind', 'Broken', 'early', 'Becky', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'kindness', 'resentment', 'rage', 'Amelia', 'charity', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'served', 'fuel', 'Becky', 'contempt', 'hatred', 'Becky', 'avid', 'successful', 'attempts', 'making', 'George', 'Osborne', 'fall', 'was', 'spurred', 'not', 'only', 'George', 'initial', 'insolence', 'destruction', 'marital', 'plans', 'Jos', 'also', 'anger', 'resentment', 'towards', 'Amelia.Thackery', 'Becky', 'not', 'caricature', 'real', 'depth', 'mostly', 'twisting', 'screws', 'Amelia', 'thumbs', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pity', 'when', 'finally', 'down', 'patience', 'towards', 'Dobbin', 'revealing', 'George', 'indiscretion', 'one', 'few', 'acts', 'selfless', 'kindness', 'point', 'weary', 'whole', 'game', 'then', 'again', 'much', 'older', 'bit', 'wiser.In', 'addition', 'hurting', 'Amelia', 'Becky', 'deliberately', 'out', 'hurt', 'many', 'others', 'anyone', 'who', 'slighted', 'Becky', 'danger', 'mimics', 'often', 'figurative', 'throat', 'attempt', 'ruffle', 'injured', 'feathers.Much', 'anger', 'feelings', 'make', 'sense', 'context', 'life', 'can', 'almost', 'forgive', 'treatment', 'son', 'more', 'horrifying', 'light.In', 'book', 'utter', 'negligence', 'contemptuous', 'attitude', 'son', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'stark', 'counterpoint', 'loving', 'behavior', 'towards', 'Rawdon', 'Senior', 'movie', 'actuall', 'mildly', 'upset', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'bullied', 'sending', 'Rawdie', 'away', 'placing', 'hand', 'window', 'giving', 'boy', 'sweet', 'smile', 'Not', 'so', 'book..', 'relieved', 'be', 'rid', 'burden', 'her.There', 'scene', 'where', 'little', 'Rawdy', 'drawn', 'angelic', 'sounds', 'mother', 'singing', 'party', 'only', 'be', 'stifled', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'scene', 'grossly', 'underplayaed', 'book', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'boy', 'angelic', 'mother', 'sing', 'never', 'really', 'harsh', 'words', 'utter', 'neglect', 'Steynes', 'actions', 'dismissing', 'presence', 'come', 'much', 'harsher', 'strident', 'child', 'innocent', 'lack', 'understanding', 'matter', 'what', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'him.In', 'end', 'boy', 'love', 'only', 'devoted', 'dad', 'loving', 'aunt', 'presumably', 'uncle', 'cousins', 'who', 'in.In', 'movie', 'Becky', 'played', 'up', 'spunky', 'victim', 'woman', 'who', 'somewhat', 'deplorably', 'ever', 'so', 'understandingly', 'not', 'woman', 'Thackery', 'wrote', 'about.I', '*do*', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Becky', 'even', 'book', 'life', 'series', 'unpleasant', 'moments', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'others', 'including', 'innocent', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', '*like', 'her*', 'movie', 'Becky', 'contrast', 'was', 'almost', 'likeable', 'see', 'misguided', 'end', 'Innocent', 'foolishly', 'played', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'never', 'actually', 'indiscretion', 'must', 'accompany', 'debts', 'monster', 'when', 'Becky', 'movie', 'innocence', 'almost', 'believe']",N/A

866253,A1G2MCGP6V0D9H,B0006FO8E8,"L. Piatkowski ""lpiatk1""","[3, 5]","The movie is beautiful to look at. Director Mira Nair crammed the film with beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes, and a highly attractive cast -- it's like watching a painting. And like a painting, at times, the film becomes a bit static.The problem with adapting Thackery's classic novel of revenge and social mobility is that its length requires either serious editing or an immense running time -- and I doubt Nair was willing to go the Tarantino route and release _Vanity Fair Vol.1_ first, followed by a volume 2. So the plot is hacked away to a watchable two hours.Reese Witherspoon stars as Becky Sharp a picaresque anti-heroine who goes through episodic adventures of upward and downward social mobility. Her performance is surprisngly strong. She manages to hold on to a credible British accent (much better than her shaky performance in _The Importance of Being Earnest_). That she is strikingly modern is a given -- she seems a touch miscast, because Witherspoon epitomizes so many values and attributes ascribed to the modern young woman currently. Becky Sharp is timeless, which is a slight hurdle that Witherspoon manages, relatively unscathed. She thankfully avoids extremes of underplaying (Which would be boring) or over-reaching (which would be ridiculous), and offers a quality performance that is commendable.The problem, however, with the movie is that the screenwriter completely hijacked Becky Sharp's character and made her into some lovable humane skamp. The novel's darker Becky is much more interesting and charming, because the readers do end up falling for Becky, despite her massive flaws in characters. The film, however presents a sort of version of ""Becky Lite"" -- she tart enough to have some semblence to the source, but nice enough, so that the audience has someone to root for. The problem is, the targeted audience for _Vanity Fair_ would not need such cliche pandering to enjoy the film.Another issue with the film is the direction that Nair went in incorporated Indian influences in the film. On the most part, they were authentic and interestic. However, there is a bizarre dance sequence Becky performs for an audience that takes every cliche of Bollywood films, and ends up resembling a Beyonce music video. Nair decided that she would play up the colonial ties with India and England -- an interesting choice, but she pulled out all the cliches of what is thought of as Indian.The film chugs along through each episode and chronicles each calamity that Becky brings upon herself, though the ending is thoroughly disappointing -- the ultimate in cynical marketing of ""how can we make this a feel-good film?"".Despite these flaws, the film's a good introduction (though certainly not a substitute) to Thackery's work.",3,Surprisingly Successful Adaptation of Thackery Classic,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2761,"['movie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'crammed', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'highly', 'attractive', 'cast', 'watching', 'painting', 'painting', 'times', 'film', 'bit', 'static.The', 'problem', 'adapting', 'Thackery', 'classic', 'novel', 'revenge', 'social', 'mobility', 'length', 'serious', 'editing', 'immense', 'running', 'time', 'doubt', 'Nair', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'Tarantino', 'route', 'release', '_Vanity', 'Fair', 'Vol.1_', 'first', 'followed', 'volume', '2', 'plot', 'hacked', 'away', 'watchable', 'two', 'hours.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'stars', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'picaresque', 'anti-heroine', 'who', 'episodic', 'adventures', 'upward', 'downward', 'social', 'mobility', 'performance', 'surprisngly', 'strong', 'hold', 'credible', 'British', 'accent', 'much', 'better', 'shaky', 'performance', '_The', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest_', 'strikingly', 'modern', 'given', 'touch', 'miscast', 'Witherspoon', 'epitomizes', 'so', 'many', 'values', 'ascribed', 'modern', 'young', 'woman', 'currently', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'timeless', 'slight', 'hurdle', 'Witherspoon', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'thankfully', 'extremes', 'underplaying', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'over-reaching', 'would', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'quality', 'performance', 'commendable.The', 'problem', 'however', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'completely', 'hijacked', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'character', 'made', 'lovable', 'humane', 'skamp', 'novel', 'darker', 'Becky', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'charming', 'readers', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'Becky', 'massive', 'flaws', 'characters', 'film', 'however', 'sort', 'version', 'Becky', 'Lite', 'tart', 'enough', 'have', 'semblence', 'source', 'nice', 'enough', 'audience', 'someone', 'root', 'problem', 'targeted', 'audience', '_Vanity', 'Fair_', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'such', 'cliche', 'pandering', 'enjoy', 'film.Another', 'issue', 'film', 'direction', 'Nair', 'went', 'incorporated', 'Indian', 'influences', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'authentic', 'interestic', 'However', 'bizarre', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Becky', 'performs', 'audience', 'cliche', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'up', 'resembling', 'Beyonce', 'music', 'video', 'Nair', 'decided', 'would', 'play', 'up', 'colonial', 'ties', 'India', 'England', 'interesting', 'choice', 'pulled', 'out', 'cliches', 'what', 'thought', 'Indian.The', 'film', 'chugs', 'episode', 'chronicles', 'calamity', 'Becky', 'ending', 'thoroughly', 'disappointing', 'ultimate', 'cynical', 'marketing', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'feel-good', 'film', 'flaws', 'film', 'good', 'introduction', 'certainly', 'not', 'substitute', 'Thackery', 'work']",N/A

Character development was almost non-existent for some characters, the plot and characterizations were changed and several situations and scenes that the author took pains to develop were crammed into the film in a matter of seconds! For instance, Dobbin and Amelia's story was patched up almost as an afterthought and the relationship between Becky and Lord Steyne seemed like it only took place for days (instead of a long standing affair).  It also seems that Reese Witherspoon was just in over her head on this role.  I don't know if it was the fault of the screenwriter, director or Reese but whatever happened to the gutsy, conniving, self-serving, social climbing but beguiling and charismatic Becky Sharp??!! This Becky is more a victim of circumstance than someone the audience loved to hate.  It's almost as if she has no control over her fate or her actions!  What a shame that the lead role on this film could be so misconstrued. I felt like I was watching Patricia Rozema and Frances O'Connor's version of ""Mansfield Park"" all over again!If this film had any saving grace it would've been the fine acting (for what it's worth), the sumptious sets and gorgeous costumes. I will be very surprised if this film doesn't earn a costume design or art direction nomination at years end.  I just wish the film could've given justice to its source.

866256,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B0006FO8E8,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[126, 132]","If you hadn't gathered it from the movie itself, the bonus documentaries on the DVD will make it clear that this edition of Vanity Fair has at its root a fatal flaw. It attempts to portray Becky Sharp as a sympathetic, even admirable person. A plucky, Madonna-style powergirl. As a result, this is an extremely watered-down version of what Thackeray actually wrote. There is nothing nice about his novel, which is tremendously compelling and hilariously funny, but also coldly cynical. Becky is a brutal predator, who doesn't care a hoot about her child or her husband, and goes about exploiting everyone around her with the greatest zeal.She's closer akin to Hannibal Lecter than to Scarlet O'Hara. Reese Witherspoone's portrayal of the non-heroine blunts all the edges, and leaves us with a fairly uninvolving character whose motivations are not always easy to grasp. Other characters are similarly polished up. George Osborne isn't nearly as callous in his behaviour to Amelia as he is in the novel. Dobbin is far too outspoken and powerful a figure whereas with Thackeray he is the prototype of an utter wet noodle. The absurdity and cowardice of Jos Sedley is smothered in layers of oriental mystique. The dazzling Indian finale, shamelessly over the top, that we get by way of obligatory happy ending, would have us believe that Becky has gone off with him on a life of happy traveling, casting infatuated glances in his direction. In the book however, she simply leeches on him, and Jos besieges his acquaintances to protect him from her! ""You don't know what a terrible woman she is"". That woman is not in this movie.In this way, the film completely misses out on the essence of the story. It basically becomes a vehicle for a string of sumptuously executed pretty pictures. In the explicit attempt, voiced by Mira Nair herself, to bring the story to the screen as one relevant to modern audiences, rather than being just the next period piece, the exact opposite is achieved. This is beautifully executed but very tame and oldfashioned costume drama. Not even the ridiculous oriental dance scene starring Becky, which shows a complete lack of understanding of early 19th century mores, can change that. Of course, Thackeray's story needs no modernization at all - it is as recognizable today as it was 200 years ago.130 minutes are not enough to do justice to the book either. All plotlines are reduced to their bare essentials; the psychology driving them is completely lost. One moment George Osborne is shunning Amelia, the next he marries her; one moment he is insulting Becky Sharp, the next he's inviting her to elope with him. At times it is almost as if you can hear the actors gasping for breath while hurrying along to get everything crammed in in the alotted time (two hours is already longer than most movie audiences can stand nowadays if the film isn't peppered with a proper barrage of CG special effects). That none of the acting stands out as particularly distinguished, with the exception of Eileen Atkins's portrayal of aunt Mathilda Crawley, is hardly surprising under these circumstances. Another thing that doesn't help believability is the fact that characters appear to have eternal youth. While we see toddlers growing up into adults, Becky, Amelia and others look exactly the same at the end of the movie as they did at the beginning.The one thing that may make this movie worthwhile to watch nonetheless, for some, is simply the visual beauty of it. Costumes, locations and sets are generally stunning, and the streets of London are teeming with people, animals and coaches. Given that the whole crew was even dragged to Jodhpur, India, to shoot a few minutes worth of footage, it is however hard to understand why the Brussels episode was shot in the courtyards of Hampton Court Palace, which constitute an unconvincing decor to anyone who knows what Belgian cities look like.What a strange experience it must have been for Natasha Little to play Jane Sheepshanks, the moost goodly character in the story, and witness the insipid Becky of Reese Witherspoon, after having herself starred as the perfect embodiment of Miss Sharp in the BBC dramatization of the novel. That version is superior to this one on every count: it looks far more realistic, gives us the fleshed out characters in all their nastiness, stays close to Thackeray's sarcastic tone, and is in its own way just as beautifully visualized as this multimillion dollar project. If you want the next best thing to reading the book, the extra cost of that DVD is more than worth it.",2,"A lot of pretty pictures, but an insult to Thackeray",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,4580,"['had', ""n't"", 'gathered', 'movie', 'bonus', 'documentaries', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'clear', 'edition', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'root', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'portray', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'admirable', 'person', 'plucky', 'Madonna-style', 'powergirl', 'result', 'extremely', 'watered-down', 'version', 'what', 'Thackeray', 'actually', 'wrote', 'nothing', 'nice', 'novel', 'tremendously', 'compelling', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'also', 'coldly', 'cynical', 'Becky', 'brutal', 'predator', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'hoot', 'child', 'husband', 'exploiting', 'everyone', 'greatest', 'zeal.She', 'closer', 'akin', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Scarlet', ""O'Hara"", 'Reese', 'Witherspoone', 'portrayal', 'non-heroine', 'blunts', 'edges', 'fairly', 'uninvolving', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'grasp', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'similarly', 'polished', 'up', 'George', 'Osborne', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'callous', 'behaviour', 'Amelia', 'novel', 'Dobbin', 'far', 'too', 'outspoken', 'powerful', 'figure', 'whereas', 'Thackeray', 'prototype', 'utter', 'wet', 'noodle', 'absurdity', 'cowardice', 'Jos', 'Sedley', 'smothered', 'layers', 'oriental', 'mystique', 'dazzling', 'Indian', 'finale', 'shamelessly', 'top', 'get', 'way', 'obligatory', 'happy', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Becky', 'gone', 'off', 'life', 'happy', 'traveling', 'casting', 'infatuated', 'glances', 'direction', 'book', 'however', 'simply', 'Jos', 'acquaintances', 'protect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'terrible', 'woman', 'woman', 'not', 'movie.In', 'way', 'film', 'completely', 'out', 'essence', 'story', 'basically', 'vehicle', 'string', 'sumptuously', 'executed', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'explicit', 'attempt', 'voiced', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'bring', 'story', 'screen', 'one', 'relevant', 'modern', 'audiences', 'rather', 'being', 'just', 'next', 'period', 'piece', 'exact', 'opposite', 'achieved', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'very', 'tame', 'oldfashioned', 'costume', 'drama', 'Not', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'oriental', 'dance', 'scene', 'starring', 'Becky', 'complete', 'lack', 'understanding', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'mores', 'can', 'change', 'course', 'Thackeray', 'story', 'modernization', 'recognizable', 'today', 'was', '200', 'years', 'ago.130', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'do', 'justice', 'book', 'plotlines', 'are', 'reduced', 'bare', 'essentials', 'psychology', 'driving', 'completely', 'lost', 'One', 'moment', 'George', 'Osborne', 'shunning', 'Amelia', 'next', 'one', 'moment', 'insulting', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'next', 'inviting', 'elope', 'times', 'almost', 'can', 'hear', 'actors', 'gasping', 'breath', 'hurrying', 'along', 'get', 'everything', 'crammed', 'alotted', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'already', 'longer', 'most', 'movie', 'audiences', 'can', 'stand', 'nowadays', 'film', ""n't"", 'peppered', 'proper', 'barrage', 'CG', 'special', 'effects', 'none', 'acting', 'out', 'particularly', 'distinguished', 'exception', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'portrayal', 'aunt', 'Mathilda', 'Crawley', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'circumstances', 'thing', ""n't"", 'help', 'believability', 'fact', 'characters', 'appear', 'have', 'eternal', 'youth', 'see', 'toddlers', 'growing', 'up', 'adults', 'Becky', 'Amelia', 'others', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', 'end', 'movie', 'did', 'beginning.The', 'one', 'thing', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'nonetheless', 'simply', 'visual', 'beauty', 'Costumes', 'locations', 'sets', 'are', 'generally', 'stunning', 'streets', 'London', 'are', 'teeming', 'people', 'animals', 'coaches', 'Given', 'whole', 'crew', 'was', 'even', 'dragged', 'Jodhpur', 'India', 'shoot', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', 'however', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'Brussels', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'courtyards', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'Palace', 'constitute', 'unconvincing', 'decor', 'anyone', 'who', 'what', 'Belgian', 'cities', 'look', 'strange', 'experience', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Natasha', 'Little', 'play', 'Jane', 'Sheepshanks', 'moost', 'goodly', 'character', 'story', 'witness', 'insipid', 'Becky', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'having', 'starred', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'Miss', 'Sharp', 'BBC', 'dramatization', 'novel', 'version', 'superior', 'one', 'count', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'nastiness', 'close', 'Thackeray', 'sarcastic', 'tone', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'beautifully', 'visualized', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'project', 'want', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'reading', 'book', 'extra', 'cost', 'DVD', 'more']",N/A

To the film's credit it is beautifully filmed but there is just nothing to grab a hold of. The only merits I gave it were the sub-plot involving Amelia and her apparently rotten husband. Whenever those actors took over the story it was actually engaging. Merit goes to the scene when the father breaks down in anguish over the grave of his rotten son, whom he had disowned, who has fallen in battle. But then it's back to the Reese Witherspoon show and tedium with her poor attempt at a British accent and very narrow acting range. After a while the performance seems hung on her sideways mischevious smile, though nothing she does or says backs it up. Nice try. The storytelling is also not good, and sections jump from premise to conclusion without so much as one pause for pathos. With some plot developments, if you blink, you miss it.

In the book, Becky is conniving, manipulative, self centered, and malicious.  In this version of the story, Becky is a plucky, impish heroine, just trying to make her way in the world.  I did not care for Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Becky Sharp.  She seemed to be out of her depth with the rest of the cast.  I tend to like Witherspoon's work, however in this movie, she just did not seem to fit.  Her portrayal of Becky seemed cutesy and cloying.

866261,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B0006FO8E8,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[4, 6]","Reese Witherspoon was born to play Becky Sharp, who in the Thackeray novel on which this film is based, is  what we would now call a hippie or beatnik, a bohemian with guts or someone with the smarts and drive to push herself into the upper classes of Regency-era England society. Witherspoon's Becky has the chutzpah to go from penniless urchin into the aristocracy, gets booted out only to return once again, triumphant: she's Elle Woods with a heart of Steel and the guts of Achilles.Director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) choreographs the proceedings with a keen eye towards the preposterousness of the character's behavior; particularly when she is dealing with the likes of  Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai), Mr. Osborne (Jim Broadbent) or Pitt (Bob Hoskins) whose pretenses to the Aristocracy are as silly as their over-the-top costumes. The physical production is gorgeous, particularly when Nair chooses to bring in the influences of her Indian roots into the proceedings.But the main thrust of Nair's mise-en-scene is societal: what makes this particular social strata tick? What is it about this group of people that makes them act as they do? Unfortunately what is dis- heartening to a modern audience is that very little has changed since 1802 and that is probably Nair's point: we still have the same prejudices, we still hold back those we see as different. The scene in which Becky is alone in Styne's (Gabriel Bryne) parlor with a group of ""upper-class"" women says volumes about these women and how they are unwilling and unable to accept someone from outside their social class: it's telling and chilling.Vanity Fair"" is beautiful to look at and at times it's social commentary stings, but overallthere's just not enough bite for your buck here; which is a shame in that, though in most instances it is best to show and then step back, here in the world that Nair and Thackeray have created, it would have helped to show, show and show again.",4,The Iron Butterfly,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1954,"['Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'who', 'Thackeray', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'hippie', 'beatnik', 'bohemian', 'guts', 'someone', 'smarts', 'drive', 'push', 'upper', 'classes', 'Regency-era', 'England', 'society', 'Witherspoon', 'Becky', 'chutzpah', 'go', 'penniless', 'urchin', 'aristocracy', 'booted', 'out', 'only', 'return', 'once', 'again', 'triumphant', 'Elle', 'Woods', 'heart', 'Steel', 'guts', 'Achilles.Director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'choreographs', 'proceedings', 'keen', 'eye', 'preposterousness', 'character', 'behavior', 'particularly', 'when', 'dealing', 'likes', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Mr.', 'Osborne', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Pitt', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'pretenses', 'Aristocracy', 'are', 'as', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'costumes', 'physical', 'production', 'gorgeous', 'particularly', 'when', 'Nair', 'bring', 'influences', 'Indian', 'roots', 'proceedings.But', 'main', 'thrust', 'Nair', 'mise-en-scene', 'societal', 'what', 'particular', 'social', 'strata', 'tick', 'What', 'group', 'people', 'act', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'dis-', 'heartening', 'modern', 'audience', 'very', 'little', 'changed', '1802', 'probably', 'Nair', 'point', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'prejudices', 'still', 'hold', 'back', 'see', 'different', 'scene', 'Becky', 'alone', 'Styne', 'Gabriel', 'Bryne', 'parlor', 'group', 'upper-class', 'women', 'volumes', 'women', 'how', 'are', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'accept', 'someone', 'social', 'class', 'telling', 'chilling.Vanity', 'Fair', 'beautiful', 'look', 'times', 'social', 'commentary', 'stings', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'bite', 'buck', 'here', 'shame', 'though', 'most', 'instances', 'best', 'show', 'then', 'step', 'back', 'here', 'world', 'Nair', 'Thackeray', 'have', 'created', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'show', 'show', 'show', 'again']",N/A

866265,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0006FO8E8,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","""Vanity Fair"" is a contemporary adaptation of William Makepeace Thackerays's novel, directed by Mira Nair, who brings rich colors and lush textures of her native India to the film, as trade with far-flung colonies did to the British society of the early 19th century. The story's heroine is Becky Sharp (Reese Witherspoon), a penniless but ambitious young woman of the 1810's who aspires to marry well and climb England's social ladder. The first thing she does upon leaving school is attempt to cajole her best friend Amelia's (Romola Garai) brother into marriage. When that fails, Becky is delighted to gain the favor of her employer's wealthy sister, whom she accompanies to London. Becky is shown the door, however, when she marries the woman's roguish nephew, Captain Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy), a gambler and kindred spirit. But Britain is on the brink of war, and Captain Crawley and Amelia's inattentive husband George (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) are off to battle Napoleon's advancing army, leaving their wives in financial peril, a situation that always threatens to foil Becky's best efforts at social advancement.Director Mira Nair's emphasis on the Indian imports that met with some fascination in 19th century England give ""Vanity Fair"" a richer visual style than one might expect from a period film about a corseted social climber, which is a welcome change from the period's usual drab tones. Becky Sharp is such a self-centered character that she isn't likable. But she has no advantage in the world but her own wits, so she cannot be blamed for using them to her benefit. Reese Witherspoon's interpretation balances the character's fundamental selfishness and misfortune. If Becky were simply a victim, she might be more sympathetic, but she would be weak and uninteresting. Instead, she is a strong character who tries to master her own fate, if sometimes by distasteful means. The film's impressive supporting cast includes Jim Broadbent, Eileen Atkins, Gabriel Byrne, and Bob Hoskins. ""Vanity Fair"" is a little long, and it may only appeal to those who normally enjoy ""period"" films. But Becky's determination and pluck, along with the film's vibrant hues give ""Vanity Fair"" more spice than the typical costume drama.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 8 deleted and extended scenes (including an alternate ending), and an audio commentary by director Mira Nair. ""Welcome to Vanity Fair"" (11 minutes) talks about interpreting the story for a modern audience, the culture in which it takes place, and includes interviews with Mira Nair, producer Donna Gigliotti, scriptwriter Julian Fellowes, and members of the film's cast. ""The Women Behind Vanity Fair"" (9 minutes) includes interviews with Nair, Reese Witherspoon, and the film's 3 female producers in which they discuss the character of Becky Sharp and comment on working with a mostly female creative team. Mira Nair provides a good, detailed audio commentary that addresses many aspects of the story and filming. She talks about Thackeray's novel, the cast, the work of the film's various creative teams, directorial decisions, and ""Vanity Fair""'s themes.

India seemed to hold a promise for the protagonist that was a powerful force in the movie.I've unfortunately never read Thackeray's novel, so I can't critique the film based on its veracity to the book, but some aspects of the movie were jarringly out of place for me. There's a scene in which several British women perform in a little entertainment for an honored guest before dinner. There were legs, ankles, and bare flesh everywhere! In my understanding of the time period, this was strictly taboo. I'm not sure if this episode was described in the book, but it seems highly unlikely to me.Performances were all right, but something about it all just felt flat to me. There were several scenes where Witherspoon's character sings that seemed to stretch on far too long. (I don't say this to malign Witherspoon's singing voice.

Granted, I've thoroughly enjoyed the various film, theater, and TV interpretations of Thackery's novel in which Becky Sharp is presented as the reptile Thackery intended her to be, beginning with Miriam Hopkins's delicious ""Becky Sharp"" (1935), based on Langdon Mitchell's play.But, for all her decency, I *like* Reese Witherspoon's Becky Sharp.  And I confess to much preferring Romola Garai's Amelia Sedley--who has a sense of humor and a definite bitter streak--to Thackery's witless paragon of feminine virtue.

With both parents dead, she has taken up a post as French instructor at Miss Pinkerton's School for young ladies.  Forced to wash floors and clean, Becky is only too happy to jump at the chance to join her only friend Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai) for two weeks of enjoyment at the Sedley home before becoming a governess in the house of a country baronet.  But Becky's discontent with the idea of being a governess leads her to take matters into her own hands, as she tries to snag Amelia's only brother, Jos Sedley, the collector of Boggley Woolah, as a husband.  She is nearly successful in her ploy, when Amelia's beau George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) steps in and puts a stop to it; tradesman's son though he is, his family's wealth makes him object strongly to the idea of a ""nobody"" like Becky as his future sister-in-law.  Becky then leaves the Sedley household and joins Sir Pitt Crawley & his family at Queens Crawley, with a deep bitterness in her heart towards the self-centered George Osborne,Becky schemes and plans her rise in society, beginning with flirtations with Pitt Crawley (Jr.) who is engaged to a Lady Jane Sheepshanks (Natasha Little, sidenote: she played Becky Sharp in A&E;'s Vanity Fair), his rogue soldier brother Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy), and even the old Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins) himself.  When Sir Pitt's rich maiden sister Miss Matilda Crawley comes to visit, the household and family scramble to impress and suck up to their rich relative.  The persnickety Miss Crawley takes an instant shine to Becky, and soon leaves, taking her back to London; Rawdon comes as well, seeming quite intrigued by the fiery social climber.  Soon Becky receives a proposal by a surprise suitor, but her answer shocks both her suitor and her relatives.  The foxy little Miss Sharp is on the fringes of society, yearning for acceptance.  How far will she go to reach the top?  Will she ever stop?  Whose lives will be affected along the way?  You will be amazed at the journey this young ""heroine"" takes through the throes of English and European society.Content:  There is very little language in this film: I noticed a use or two of the Lord's name in vain, and not much else.  There is some objectionable content: a woman's backside is shown briefly, a husband and wife are shown half dressed in bed in an ""after sex"" scene that is somewhat intense, a married man flirts with a married woman, a married woman flirts with another married man, a married man tries to take advantage of a married woman but is stopped, lots of cleavage is shown, and there is a dance scene that is very sensual .  There is a small bit of violence as well:  A few scenes of war show dead bodies strewn about and such disastrous aftereffects of war, and a man goes after another man (with good reason) and hits him repeatedly.Mira Nair's ""Vanity Fair"" was based on the incredibly long classic novel by William Mackepeace Thackeray.  This remake covered all the main points of the book, although it did cut out a few important minor characters and heighten the importance of another.  The screenplay was almost as-true-as-can-be to the novel, with minimal differences: the difficulty in telling so much story in so little time was apparent: it seemed to fall a bit flat.A slow moving period piece that is sometimes dramatic, sometimes delightful, sometimes intense, sometimes deliberate, sometimes too sensual, and sometimes...well...almost off?!  It's hard to describe, that although I really enjoyed this film and will buy the DVD when it's out, there was some missing element from this film.  It was gorgeous.  It was well-acted, and fairly well-written.  It was well-costumed and well-filmed.  But, it failed to touch my heart or emotions deeply: there were moments that moved me, but it seemed to lack the element of reality.  Films that touch you, you believe, even if only for a moment, that they are real: that peter pan can fly, that cinderella found her prince charming, that fish and toys can talk.  Somehow, even while enjoying these 2 and 1/2 hours of almost-Thackeray, I just had trouble believing these people really lived: I loved and was disappointed in this film at that same time.",3,"Well-acted, well-filmed, but seemed to fall a bit flat!",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,4387,"['Rebecca', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'grown', 'up', 'nothing', 'opera', 'singer', 'mother', 'struggling', 'artist', 'father', 'breeding', 'wealth', 'are', 'far', 'parents', 'dead', 'taken', 'up', 'post', 'French', 'instructor', 'Miss', 'Pinkerton', 'School', 'young', 'ladies', 'Forced', 'wash', 'floors', 'clean', 'Becky', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'jump', 'chance', 'join', 'only', 'friend', 'Amelia', 'Sedley', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'two', 'weeks', 'enjoyment', 'Sedley', 'home', 'becoming', 'governess', 'house', 'country', 'baronet', 'Becky', 'discontent', 'idea', 'being', 'governess', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'snag', 'Amelia', 'only', 'brother', 'Jos', 'Sedley', 'collector', 'Boggley', 'Woolah', 'husband', 'nearly', 'successful', 'ploy', 'when', 'Amelia', 'beau', 'George', 'Osborne', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Myers', 'steps', 'puts', 'stop', 'tradesman', 'son', 'family', 'wealth', 'object', 'strongly', 'idea', 'nobody', 'like', 'Becky', 'future', 'sister-in-law', 'Becky', 'then', 'Sedley', 'household', 'Sir', 'Pitt', 'Crawley', 'family', 'Queens', 'Crawley', 'deep', 'bitterness', 'heart', 'self-centered', 'George', 'Osborne', 'Becky', 'schemes', 'rise', 'society', 'beginning', 'flirtations', 'Pitt', 'Crawley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'engaged', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Sheepshanks', 'Natasha', 'Little', 'sidenote', 'played', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'A', 'E', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'rogue', 'soldier', 'brother', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'even', 'old', 'Sir', 'Pitt', 'Crawley', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'When', 'Sir', 'Pitt', 'rich', 'maiden', 'sister', 'Miss', 'Matilda', 'Crawley', 'visit', 'household', 'family', 'scramble', 'impress', 'suck', 'up', 'rich', 'relative', 'persnickety', 'Miss', 'Crawley', 'instant', 'shine', 'Becky', 'soon', 'leaves', 'taking', 'back', 'London', 'Rawdon', 'as', 'well', 'seeming', 'quite', 'intrigued', 'fiery', 'social', 'climber', 'Soon', 'Becky', 'proposal', 'surprise', 'suitor', 'answer', 'shocks', 'suitor', 'relatives', 'foxy', 'little', 'Miss', 'Sharp', 'fringes', 'society', 'yearning', 'acceptance', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'reach', 'top', 'Will', 'ever', 'stop', 'Whose', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'journey', 'young', 'heroine', 'throes', 'English', 'European', 'society.Content', 'very', 'little', 'language', 'film', 'noticed', 'use', 'two', 'Lord', 'name', 'vain', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'objectionable', 'content', 'woman', 'backside', 'shown', 'briefly', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'shown', 'half', 'dressed', 'bed', 'sex', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'intense', 'married', 'man', 'married', 'woman', 'married', 'woman', 'married', 'man', 'married', 'man', 'take', 'advantage', 'married', 'woman', 'stopped', 'lots', 'cleavage', 'shown', 'dance', 'scene', 'very', 'sensual', 'small', 'bit', 'violence', 'well', 'few', 'scenes', 'war', 'show', 'dead', 'bodies', 'strewn', 'such', 'disastrous', 'aftereffects', 'war', 'man', 'man', 'good', 'reason', 'repeatedly.Mira', 'Nair', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'was', 'based', 'incredibly', 'long', 'classic', 'novel', 'William', 'Mackepeace', 'Thackeray', 'remake', 'covered', 'main', 'points', 'book', 'did', 'cut', 'out', 'few', 'important', 'minor', 'characters', 'heighten', 'importance', 'screenplay', 'was', 'almost', 'as-true-as-can-be', 'novel', 'minimal', 'differences', 'difficulty', 'telling', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'was', 'apparent', 'seemed', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat.A', 'slow', 'moving', 'period', 'piece', 'sometimes', 'dramatic', 'sometimes', 'delightful', 'sometimes', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'deliberate', 'sometimes', 'too', 'sensual', 'sometimes', 'well', 'almost', 'hard', 'describe', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'was', 'missing', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'well-acted', 'fairly', 'well-written', 'was', 'well-costumed', 'well-filmed', 'failed', 'touch', 'heart', 'emotions', 'deeply', 'were', 'moments', 'moved', 'seemed', 'lack', 'element', 'reality', 'Films', 'touch', 'believe', 'even', 'only', 'moment', 'are', 'real', 'peter', 'pan', 'can', 'fly', 'cinderella', 'found', 'prince', 'charming', 'fish', 'toys', 'can', 'talk', 'Somehow', 'even', 'enjoying', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'almost-Thackeray', 'just', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', 'people', 'really', 'lived', 'loved', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'same', 'time']",N/A

A look at the extended title of the book brings to light one of the more visible failings.  Thakeray intended for this to be ""A Novel Without a Hero"".Nair and Witherspoon (notorious for her insistence on having her interpretation of character motivation supercede the written script) fail to realize that Becky Sharp need not be a likeable character to be an interesting character.  Had they explored more of what the book illustrated - her persisent selfishness and tunnel-visioned ambition - there would have been no need for the out-of-character acts of continual selflessness and condescension which made the viewer dislike Becky for her rather schizophrenic behavior. I found the character's mixed ambition and distorted logic distracting and disappointing.The anachronistic song and dance scene tacked on near the end of the film was visually beautiful, but both inappropriate and out of character for the personalities taking place. No genteel woman would have appeared scantily dressed in a public theatrical  forum.  No ambitious social climber would have risked the reputation so painstakingly built up to incur the wrath that would surely be the reaction of the audience in watching her perform theatrics.  It just cemented how badly the book was interpreted by screenwriters, director and lead actress.A story based upon Becky Sharp, but not ""Vanity Fair"" itself would have proven a better film had Nair chosen to honor the 'spirit' she found in the written novel.

The crux of the problem is that the original book, written as a series by course lends itself to a mini series and not to a feature film.  The time constraints and the audience desired plot line of feature film are completely incongruous with the Thackeray's work.  There is no happy ending or even a character you feel complete compassion for in the original.  However, this is not the original but a two hour interpretation based on Thackeray's work that is quite enjoyable, intense and visually engaging - so long as you remember this is you should truly enjoy this film.Using amazing sets, slightly over the top costume and very real good cinematography Vanity Fair shows early 19th century England as one might truly imagine it.  In the era of Napoleonic wars fortunes were reversed in a single day and while England saw no combat on her shores happenings on the continent affected each and every Briton as seen through Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp.  But enough of the of the historical, moving on to the plot which revolves around the relationship between the well-to-do Amelia Sedley and the clever Rebecca Sharp who unwilling to accept her station in life does everything possible to break the very real social barriers of regency England.  This in itself is interesting as her past continually makes itself known. After Waterloo and longer after marrying into the family for whom she was a governess everything appears to be going well for Becky and horribly for Amelia whose husband fell in battle and has been renounced by her family.  But of course fortune reverses itself once more and after a perceived affair her husband, who was not making money and just got out of debtor's prison, walks out on her only to receive a governorship.  Finally Becky (and Amelia) finds her love and in an all too happy of endings parades through India with Amelia's Brother.With too many plot twists and tangles to describe this movie does require an audience's attention.  While the accents aren't rough and the language is simple for 19th century England there are many subtleties and twists that build the plot.  For this reason the DVD is a good buy. Along with many extras and documentaries the DVD is truly worth the purchase.  The film definitely has a few flaws but overall it portrays 19th century England beautifully although I think the costume designer took a bit too much liberty is designing a few all too opulent costumes.  The acting too is quite well borrowing from a few great British actors and even Reese Witherspoon surprisingly does a good job.  This is a film to see if you haven't seen it.  It has something for everyone.  While being quite romantic it has plenty of violence.  If you have seen this film and enjoyed it get the DVD you will enjoy seeing it again or again and again and the extras make it a great deal.  EnjoyTed Murena",4,Not Thackeray but well worth it.

866277,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0006FO8E8,Robert Morris,"[4, 5]","This is the latest in a series of adaptations of Thackeray's novel, with earlier films having appeared in 1915, 1923, and 1932 There is also Becky Sharp which Rouben Mamoulian's directed in 1935 as well as the quite excellent version telecast by BBC 1 in 1998, directed by Mark Munden and starring Natasha Little as Becky Sharp. (She also appears in this film as Lady Jane Sheepshanks.) To be fair, no film (even with a running time of 180-210 minutes) can do full justice to a novel, especially Thackeray's. Moreover, film directors inevitably must decide not only what to cover (and not cover) but also HOW to present the material they have selected. Which defining moments on which to focus? How to correlate sub-plots with the primary narrative? Which tone to establish? So many critically important decisions must be made. Not an enviable task.All that said, I think this is an appealing film in many respects (e.g. the production values which recreate a time and culture 200 years ago) but one which has serious flaws. Here are three which help to explain my rating. First, the pace resembles a jack rabbit on steroids which hops around from place to place, from crisis to crisis. It is almost impossible for me to gain any sense of flow to plot developments. Secondly, although there are dozens of leading and secondary characters involved in the narrative, I cared only about William Dobbin (Rhys Ifam) of whom George Osborne observes (in the novel) ""There's not a finer fellow in the service, nor a better officer, though he is not an Adonis.""  He is also described as ""a lanky-gawky fellow... [who] tumbles over everybody."" Thackeray once suggested that his novel has neither a hero nor a heroine. As directed by Mira Nair, the Dobbin character may not be fully heroic but he is certainly admirable in all respects...and no other character in her film seems so to me. Finally, I have problems with Reese Witherspoon's Becky and blame must be shared with Nair. Given Becky's background and subsequent circumstances over time, it is wholly understandable that she would be, say, and do whatever is necessary to fulfill her ambitions.

To paraphrase Pauline Kael, you know you're in for it from the word ""go"".2) Reese Witherspoon playing a nineteenth century Brit, who is fluent in French as well.  ""Je t'aime, my lord?  Oh my God, like no way, that's totally gross!""3) British soldiers dashing about during the Age of the French Wars with ""bed head"" courtesy of Toni & Guy.4) The innumerable references to India, which seem to occur exclusively to remind us that the director is from India.  They certainly contribute nothing of value whatsoever to the plot, which is confusing enough already.5) The bizarre, anachronistic break down Indian musical jam session, which accompanies what appears to be a suggestive belly dance, in the midst of a proper drawing room performance for royalty in the most stiflingly conservative era of British history.  It was very Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation--I'm impressed with the PA system they had available to them back then.  And that plucky Miss Sharp--she's chock full of talents!  She speaks perfect French (which she supposedly learned from her mother, who died when she was like, five), is an accomplished teacher, sings, paints in an Impressionistic style before Impressionism was invented, and now dances like Paula Abdul.  It's amazing what they teach 'em in those orphanages!6) The way Becky's friend Amelia, who never manages to age or mature an ounce over 20+ years, clings inexplicably to the memory of her complete putz of a thankfully dead husband for a couple of decades, all the while insanely ignoring the unrequited love of a perfect gentleman, who is also her closest friend.  See if you don't want to smack her for the entire film.  This goes on interminably, until, of course, Becky handily convinces her with two terse sentences over a reunion tea that her husband really was a jerk, and the twit instantly realizes she's been a wack-job for her whole life and runs (literally!) straight from her crumpets to the arms of the milqetoast who's been waiting for her for eternity and a half.  This has to be the most breathtakingly ludicrous denouement in the history of film.7) The men in the German casino near the end of the movie, who appear to have tinker toys braided into their hair.  These are the flourishes that seem to win period films like this Academy Awards for ""art direction"" and ""costume design.""  I imagine it is about as authentic to the styles of the period as it would be if filmmakers 200 years from now modeled our present fashions on Tammy Faye Bakker or Jocelyn Wildenstein.8) The way Mira Nair exposes herself as a complete hack of a director by showing us a modestly amusing shot of Becky riding an elephant in India with her scrappy little monogrammed trunk strapped to the back, then underscoring the presence of the trunk with an extreme closeup JUST IN CASE WE MISSED IT THE FIRST TIME.

This movie is enriched by corny one liners and cheating and lying. It skips parts which I think the director intended on you to pick up (which I didn't). For a teenager this movie was very hard to keep up with. For example when she was preagnant, I knew the couple wanted one I just didn't actually see her preagnant until further later on. Overall, it is a good movie, especiallly the Arab dancing scene (as I love that song).  Its casting is exuisite but maybe the story itself isn't much appealing to many.

I admit I was even quite surprised at some of the twists and turns of the plot.  Those of you who did not see the movie yet, beware; I have detailed several scenes below.What made the viewing interesting was first of all the story itself, which is intriguing and develops in a different way then I expected.  A good example would be the first appearance of Lord Stein, who comes to buy a picture from Becky's father, the painter.  He is so grand and impressive you know he will return again but I somehow expected him to be the sort of a ""savior"" and not the person who will toy with Becky and bring to her doom. Another example is Becky and Rodon's marriage which quite surprised me (and his aunt as well...) as I was under the impression he is a sort of playboy, which will only break her heart.  Rodon turns out not to be that sort of person at all (at least not where women are concerned). These are just two examples of what kept me so immersed in the plot. Above all hanged the ultimate question - will she succeed? The ending was also quite surprising and even a little awkward, I might add (is this a tragedy or not? The colorful ending makes it quite unclear). The second reason for my enjoyment is Reese Whiterspoon. Whiterspoon manages to be sweet and vulnerable and at the same time cunning and annoying (the scene of Becky and Rodon's separation from their son, on his way to Boarding school is a perfect example. The whole situation is so upsetting and the viewer becomes very angry with Becky , and yet by the end of the scene, with her hand on the glass, she manages to win our heart again). After reading about the original story I now  understand that the original Becky should have been a lot more cunning and deceitful then actually pictured on screen, so this might be a certain flaw of the movie. The last reason is the beautiful period and scenery reconstruction:  the characters, the clothes, the houses, the weather, the Indian touches - all so beautiful and so appropriate to the way the plot is presented.What  made this movie a fuller experience for me was watching the movie again with the commentary of Mira Nair. The director talks very seriously (no in-between jokes of the kind I met in other commentaries) and gives a very thorough lecture of many different dimensions of this lovely movie. Nair talks especially of her efforts to translate the words of Thackeray to the screen . She gives detailed explanations of her camera usage and detailed visual ideas and symbols you could never think about while watching the movie but indeed they work upon you and give you the certain effect she wanted to achieve. Nair talks about her reasons to delete or add scenes that were not in the original story.  She elaborates on issues that will never be clear to people who are unfamiliar with the story or with filmmaking.",4,"Great Entertainment for the ""fresh"" viewer",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,3007,"['was', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'original', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'beforehand', 'viewing', 'experience', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'fresh', 'admit', 'was', 'even', 'quite', 'surprised', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'yet', 'beware', 'have', 'detailed', 'several', 'scenes', 'made', 'viewing', 'interesting', 'was', 'first', 'story', 'intriguing', 'develops', 'different', 'way', 'then', 'expected', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'appearance', 'Lord', 'Stein', 'who', 'buy', 'picture', 'Becky', 'father', 'painter', 'so', 'grand', 'impressive', 'know', 'will', 'return', 'again', 'somehow', 'expected', 'be', 'sort', 'savior', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'toy', 'Becky', 'bring', 'doom', 'example', 'Becky', 'Rodon', 'marriage', 'quite', 'surprised', 'aunt', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'impression', 'sort', 'playboy', 'will', 'only', 'break', 'heart', 'Rodon', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'sort', 'person', 'least', 'not', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'examples', 'what', 'kept', 'so', 'immersed', 'plot', 'hanged', 'ultimate', 'question', 'will', 'succeed', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'surprising', 'even', 'little', 'awkward', 'might', 'add', 'tragedy', 'not', 'colorful', 'ending', 'quite', 'unclear', 'second', 'reason', 'enjoyment', 'Reese', 'Whiterspoon', 'Whiterspoon', 'be', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'cunning', 'annoying', 'scene', 'Becky', 'Rodon', 'separation', 'son', 'way', 'Boarding', 'school', 'perfect', 'example', 'whole', 'situation', 'so', 'upsetting', 'viewer', 'very', 'angry', 'Becky', 'yet', 'end', 'scene', 'hand', 'glass', 'win', 'heart', 'again', 'reading', 'original', 'story', 'now', 'understand', 'original', 'Becky', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'cunning', 'deceitful', 'then', 'actually', 'pictured', 'screen', 'might', 'be', 'certain', 'flaw', 'movie', 'last', 'reason', 'beautiful', 'period', 'scenery', 'reconstruction', 'characters', 'clothes', 'houses', 'weather', 'Indian', 'touches', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'appropriate', 'way', 'plot', 'presented.What', 'made', 'movie', 'fuller', 'experience', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'commentary', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'director', 'talks', 'very', 'seriously', 'in-between', 'jokes', 'kind', 'met', 'other', 'commentaries', 'very', 'thorough', 'lecture', 'many', 'different', 'dimensions', 'lovely', 'movie', 'Nair', 'talks', 'especially', 'efforts', 'translate', 'words', 'Thackeray', 'screen', 'detailed', 'explanations', 'camera', 'usage', 'detailed', 'visual', 'ideas', 'symbols', 'could', 'never', 'think', 'watching', 'movie', 'indeed', 'work', 'give', 'certain', 'effect', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'Nair', 'talks', 'reasons', 'delete', 'add', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'issues', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'clear', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'filmmaking']",N/A
866289,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006FO8E8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 5]","To enjoy films, you don't necessarily have to read the original books upon which they were made. Having said that, I must say there are something wrong, something inconsistent in the newest version of `Vanity Fair.' The book was written by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1848, but the film's heroine Becky Sharp looks more modernized one, tame version of pop culture icon Madonna. Becky is a material girl, but she could be popular if she wants to.This is far form the original's Becky, but I can watch and be happy if the film is good. The change would not be a big problem if the filmed version has put something substantial and intriguing in the film. As far as the colorful costumes and gifted actors go, Mira Nair's `Vanity Fair's is very enjoyable. Some may disagree with Bollywood-like dancing scenes and American-born Reese Witherspoon's casting as Becky Sharp, but it is all right with me.[BECKY AS LIKEABLE HEROINE] But Becky Sharp has become totally different character, and she remains curiously uninteresting. The film not only changed the unflinching, predator-like social climber into a likable, tragic heroine whom the society treats badly; it also lost a sense of pathos and biting humor. The film's story is faithful to the book up to a certain point (except the weak ending), but the faithfulness shows the misjudgment on the filmmakers' side, leaving the content pretty hollow.One example will show you what I mean. At one crucial moment that concludes one of the chapters of the original book, Becky cries, ""O Sir Pitt!"" and confesses to him that she has already got marries. This is one of the best (and surprising) moments in the book, revealing the great (and in a sense cruel) irony of Becky's fate. In the film, Reese Witherspoon's Becky does the same, but with no sense of irony. The scene is blandly done, and the film goes as if the director and actors did not know the true meaning of what disappointed Becky is saying. The film has many memorable sequences from the original (like Doctor Johnson's dictionary or the confusion in Belgium), but they fail to bring to life the hilarious and suspenseful sentences of Thackeray.[THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MILD SPOILER] One more thing. The ending, which is all cluttered. Alternate ending is no good either, and the reason is simple. Again Becky's character. They altered the nature of the relation Between Becky and Lord Steyne in order to make us relate to her. In consequence Becky's behaviors look more strange. How can you make Becky an innocent victim when she accepts money from Lord `Stain' (played by Gabriel Byrne who speaks like a rogue?) Why Joseph Sedley shows up at the right moment?  What was Dobbin doing while he was not on screen? Where did Rawdon Crawley go?Even with long running time of 141 minutes, it is hard to cover all the elements found in `Vanity Fair.' Mira Nair added so many things - exotic colors, modern ideas like feminism, and etc.-and they are no problem themselves. But the weakness (not the change) in Becky's personality is unacceptable, and other characters like Dobbin are only mildly interesting. In short, `Vanity Fair' needs a ""wicked woman"" or more seductive lady as heroine, and this Becky is not wicked enough.",2,"Victorian Eye Candy with ""Likable"" Becky Sharp: No Biting Humor, No Point",1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,3230,"['enjoy', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'books', 'were', 'made', 'Having', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'are', 'something', 'wrong', 'something', 'inconsistent', 'newest', 'version', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'William', 'Makepeace', 'Thackeray', '1848', 'film', 'heroine', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'more', 'modernized', 'one', 'tame', 'version', 'pop', 'culture', 'icon', 'Madonna', 'Becky', 'material', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'popular', 'to.This', 'far', 'form', 'original', 'Becky', 'can', 'watch', 'be', 'happy', 'film', 'good', 'change', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'problem', 'filmed', 'version', 'put', 'something', 'substantial', 'intriguing', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'gifted', 'actors', 'go', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'may', 'disagree', 'Bollywood-like', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'American-born', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'casting', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'right', '[', 'BECKY', 'AS', 'LIKEABLE', 'HEROINE', ']', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'become', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'curiously', 'uninteresting', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'changed', 'unflinching', 'predator-like', 'social', 'climber', 'likable', 'tragic', 'heroine', 'whom', 'society', 'badly', 'also', 'lost', 'sense', 'pathos', 'biting', 'humor', 'film', 'story', 'faithful', 'book', 'up', 'certain', 'point', 'weak', 'ending', 'faithfulness', 'misjudgment', 'filmmakers', 'side', 'leaving', 'content', 'pretty', 'hollow.One', 'example', 'will', 'show', 'what', 'mean', 'one', 'crucial', 'moment', 'one', 'chapters', 'original', 'book', 'Becky', 'cries', 'O', 'Sir', 'Pitt', 'confesses', 'already', 'got', 'marries', 'one', 'best', 'surprising', 'moments', 'book', 'revealing', 'great', 'sense', 'cruel', 'irony', 'Becky', 'fate', 'film', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Becky', 'same', 'sense', 'irony', 'scene', 'blandly', 'done', 'film', 'director', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'true', 'meaning', 'what', 'disappointed', 'Becky', 'saying', 'film', 'many', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'original', 'Doctor', 'Johnson', 'dictionary', 'confusion', 'Belgium', 'fail', 'bring', 'life', 'hilarious', 'suspenseful', 'sentences', 'Thackeray', '[', 'THIS', 'PARAGRAPH', 'CONTAINS', 'MILD', 'SPOILER', ']', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'ending', 'cluttered', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'good', 'reason', 'simple', 'Again', 'Becky', 'character', 'altered', 'nature', 'relation', 'Between', 'Becky', 'Lord', 'Steyne', 'order', 'make', 'relate', 'consequence', 'Becky', 'behaviors', 'look', 'more', 'strange', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'Becky', 'innocent', 'victim', 'when', 'money', 'Lord', 'Stain', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'who', 'rogue', 'Why', 'Joseph', 'Sedley', 'up', 'right', 'moment', 'What', 'was', 'Dobbin', 'doing', 'was', 'not', 'screen', 'Where', 'did', 'Rawdon', 'Crawley', 'go', 'Even', 'long', 'running', 'time', '141', 'minutes', 'hard', 'cover', 'elements', 'found', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'added', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'exotic', 'colors', 'modern', 'ideas', 'feminism', 'etc.-and', 'are', 'problem', 'weakness', 'not', 'change', 'Becky', 'personality', 'unacceptable', 'other', 'characters', 'Dobbin', 'are', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'short', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'wicked', 'woman', 'more', 'seductive', 'lady', 'heroine', 'Becky', 'not', 'wicked', 'enough']",N/A

Since majoring in English, I've always had Vanity Fair on my reading list, but know I'll probably never sit down and actually read the long volume, so I looked forward to watching the recent productions of it in film and television. I purchased the BBC version and have yet to watch it, thinking I would watch the movie version first, expecting its obviously-too-short 2 hours and 20 minutes to be just a quick synopsis with some nice acting and a grand budget. That's exactly what it is, so I can't say I was disappointed because I wasn't expecting a great film nor an exposition of Thackery. Instead, it's like you're flying over the forest and just hitting some of the important treetops, and obviously, it ain't Thackery. If you want to ""watch"" Thackery, go get a copy of one of the very best films of all time, Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" (see my other reviews).This movie has a lot worth enjoying, though. The sets, the scenery, the color coordination, and most of all, the makeup and hair and costumes (!!!) are fantastic. Man! Did people really dress like that back then?  It's fun to think so. Witherspoon does an ok job, she carries her performance, and she's always pleasant to look at. Some of the other actors do even better performances, so the acting all around was very good. But the plot gets from here to there so quickly that you shouldn't stop to take notes.Watch this film without great expectations and you'll find a lot of simple pleasures. There is one song that Witherspoon sings adequately (or was that Sissel?) near the end which is a great delight--""Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal""--a Tennyson poem put to music. I don't care that it's long for the pace of the film or out of era. I've never heard such a song before and listening to it and experiencing it is maybe the best moment in the film. And then there's an ""oriental"" dance scene which is pure ridiculousness. It's like the film suddenly stops and does Madonna. So you get an odd mixture in this film, but a well done odd mixture.Now I'll go watch the BBC version and hopefull get a good sense of the novel. I'm sure it'll be fantastic in its own way, and probably very different from the film.",3,Enjoyable all the same...,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,2444,"['Beautiful', 'rich', 'visuals', 'felt', 'wonderfully', ""'re"", 'time', 'period', 'least', 'most', 'time', 'maybe', 'fantasy', 'time', 'period', 'had', 'couple', 'great', 'moments', 'had', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'moved', 'story', 'outline', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'Thackery', 'majoring', 'English', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'reading', 'list', 'know', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'sit', 'down', 'actually', 'read', 'long', 'volume', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'recent', 'productions', 'film', 'television', 'purchased', 'BBC', 'version', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'thinking', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'version', 'first', 'expecting', 'obviously-too-short', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'be', 'just', 'quick', 'synopsis', 'nice', 'acting', 'grand', 'budget', 'exactly', 'what', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'great', 'film', 'exposition', 'Thackery', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'flying', 'forest', 'just', 'hitting', 'important', 'treetops', 'obviously', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Thackery', 'want', 'watch', 'Thackery', 'go', 'get', 'copy', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Kubrick', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', '.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'enjoying', 'though', 'sets', 'scenery', 'color', 'coordination', 'most', 'makeup', 'hair', 'costumes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Man', 'Did', 'people', 'really', 'dress', 'back', 'then', 'fun', 'think', 'so', 'Witherspoon', 'ok', 'job', 'performance', 'always', 'pleasant', 'look', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'even', 'better', 'performances', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'here', 'so', 'quickly', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'take', 'notes.Watch', 'film', 'great', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'one', 'song', 'Witherspoon', 'sings', 'adequately', 'was', 'Sissel', 'end', 'great', 'delight', 'Now', 'Crimson', 'Petal', 'Tennyson', 'poem', 'put', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'long', 'pace', 'film', 'era', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'song', 'listening', 'experiencing', 'maybe', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'then', 'oriental', 'dance', 'scene', 'pure', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'suddenly', 'Madonna', 'So', 'get', 'odd', 'mixture', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'odd', 'mixture.Now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'watch', 'BBC', 'version', 'hopefull', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'novel', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fantastic', 'own', 'way', 'probably', 'very', 'different', 'film']",N/A

I instantly compared her golddigger character to Gillian Anderson's  House Of Mirth(also a period piece). Here she desn't have to endure tragedy, and ultimately finds herself a wealthy husband from India. Well, it took her a great deal of effort to climb her way to high society. She had to lie to people about her past, and she dazzled some people with her talent and beauty. She gets to perform a few musical numbers as well. It's a great opportunity for her to display more of her range beyond her comedy roles in the past. Perhaps, it was too dramatic for her, that she didn't have enough intensity consistently. I also noticed that her accent was off when she has to play a heavy crying scene. I have to give her credit for trying very hard, and it is her most ambitious and difficult role to date.The costumes ,makeup, and the lavish sets were beautiful. The supporting cast members overall delivered decent performances. Anyways, I fell the movie didn't work, because it wasn't a drama nor a comedy. It was kind of all over the place, and Becky is not a very likeable character. Oh well, I guess it's time for Witherspoon to return her more familiar horizon.
