1290267,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B002UOMGWO,Boston Reader,"[0, 1]","This has to be in one of the top five best seasons of Law & Order. It is as good and golden as season 2, the first season to be nominated for an Emmy. Bond girl, Carey Lowell joins the cast as ADA Jamie Ross, Jack's new assistant. The episodes are all well written with powerful and emotional plots for the characters. No Homicide crossover episode this year, but instead there is a three-part story arc where the detectives and the ADA's make multiple trips to Los Angeles to investigate the brutal murder of an executive in a movie production company. From corrupt cops to good Samaritans or lack of to bad judges, this season will grab you and take you on a ride through the ups and downs of the criminal justice system. There are rights, there are wrongs then there is a wide field full of different shades of grey. This is about those shades of grey. Also note that there were no cast changes between seasons 7 and 8, marking it the second time in the history of the series run since season 2. And I guarantee that the final scene in the series final will make you shed a tear or as least give you chills as it fades out. The 7th season belongs to all and any Law & Order fan. After watching this season you will see that the Emmy Award Law & Order received for Outstanding Drama Series in 1997 was well deserved.",5,The season that won an Emmy,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,1318,"['be', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'best', 'seasons', 'Law', 'Order', 'as', 'good', 'golden', 'season', '2', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Carey', 'Lowell', 'cast', 'ADA', 'Jamie', 'Ross', 'Jack', 'new', 'assistant', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'plots', 'characters', 'Homicide', 'crossover', 'episode', 'year', 'instead', 'three-part', 'story', 'arc', 'where', 'detectives', 'ADA', 'make', 'multiple', 'trips', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'investigate', 'brutal', 'murder', 'executive', 'movie', 'production', 'company', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'good', 'Samaritans', 'lack', 'bad', 'judges', 'season', 'will', 'grab', 'take', 'ride', 'ups', 'downs', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'are', 'rights', 'are', 'wrongs', 'then', 'wide', 'field', 'full', 'different', 'shades', 'grey', 'shades', 'grey', 'Also', 'note', 'were', 'cast', 'changes', 'seasons', '7', '8', 'marking', 'second', 'time', 'history', 'series', 'run', 'season', '2', 'guarantee', 'final', 'scene', 'series', 'final', 'will', 'make', 'shed', 'tear', 'least', 'give', 'chills', 'out', '7th', 'season', 'belongs', 'Law', 'Order', 'fan', 'watching', 'season', 'will', 'see', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Law', 'Order', 'received', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', '1997', 'was', 'well', 'deserved']",N/A
1290268,A3GBS13EUHBDAR,B002UOMGWO,"B. Poole ""bradiane777""","[1, 2]","This is one of our favorite shows on TV and we have purchased nearly all the DVD's that are available.  We do the pre-order but then usually have to wait nearly a year before we get them - hate that.  We did not like the first three seasons of Law and Order because the actors just didn't mesh and it wasn't interesting.  The best years were with Jerry Orbach, Sam Waterston, Benjamin Bratt, S. Epatha Metherson, Jill Hennesy, Angie Harmon, Dianne Wiest, and Jesse L. Martin althought they were not all on at the same time. Angie Harmon was the best second chair ever. Elisabeth Rohm was okay until the last season she was on and during that time, she started being argumentative and standing up for things that she had never taken a stand on before. It was obvious that she was on her way out but the way she left the show was ridiculous as there had never been anything (it had actually given a very different impression of her all through the show) that this was true.  I guess they are running out of ways to say actors left.  The other ADA's have been totally uninteresting - never understood why everyone loved Jamie Ross (Carey Lowell) so much and there was always so much talk about how beautiful she was. Maybe her beauty just didn't show up on TV because we never saw it. We have not liked any of the other detectives, didn't care when Alex was killed and basically only kept watching it after Connie came on because it was a habit.  I have to admit that everyone wanted Jack McCoy as the DA but at the same time we want him in the court room - no one can take his place there and Michael Cutter doesn't come close. (Why was he promoted to that spot anyway, since Connie had been second chair to Jack?  Shouldn't that have been her job?  We had never seen him before.) Thank goodness Fred Dalton Thompson left the show because there was always an urge to throw something at the TV everytime he was on screen. There was also an urge to reach through the screen and slap some of those judges who made outrageous decisions over and over - escpecially the guy who was always swallowing TUMs or whatever.  The part of Benjamin Bratt having a one night stand was unbelievable and stupid as was the show with Julia Roberts who was obviously wanting to do a show with her boyfriend. The show didn't need her or the story.  There was always enough personal information given to make you care about the characters but they could have included more about Van Buren's marriage break-up, cancer and the new boyfriend. We've bought all we can of the DVD's but they are very hard to get. We kept watching and continue watching in syndication with actors we really don't like simply because of Sam Waterston and S. Epatha Merkerson. We probably won't buy any (if they are ever available) of the DVD's that were made after Jesse L. Green left or Elisabeth Rohm left.  Again, we love McCoy and Van Buren but not enough to put up with all those other actors.  Law and Order was a good show that deserved it's 20 year run. Just wish some casting had been better.  We would recommend the show up through the years mentioned.",5,Ups and Downs,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3113,"['one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'TV', 'have', 'purchased', 'nearly', 'DVD', 'are', 'available', 'do', 'pre-order', 'then', 'usually', 'have', 'wait', 'nearly', 'year', 'get', 'hate', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Law', 'Order', 'actors', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'best', 'years', 'were', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Metherson', 'Jill', 'Hennesy', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'althought', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'was', 'best', 'second', 'chair', 'ever', 'Elisabeth', 'Rohm', 'was', 'okay', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'time', 'started', 'being', 'argumentative', 'standing', 'up', 'things', 'had', 'never', 'taken', 'stand', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'way', 'way', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'anything', 'had', 'actually', 'given', 'very', 'different', 'impression', 'show', 'was', 'true', 'guess', 'are', 'running', 'ways', 'say', 'actors', 'left', 'other', 'ADA', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'everyone', 'loved', 'Jamie', 'Ross', 'Carey', 'Lowell', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'how', 'beautiful', 'was', 'Maybe', 'beauty', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'TV', 'never', 'saw', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'other', 'detectives', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'Alex', 'was', 'killed', 'basically', 'only', 'kept', 'watching', 'Connie', 'came', 'was', 'habit', 'have', 'admit', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'DA', 'same', 'time', 'want', 'court', 'room', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'there', 'Michael', 'Cutter', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'Why', 'was', 'promoted', 'spot', 'anyway', 'Connie', 'had', 'been', 'second', 'chair', 'Jack', 'Should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'job', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'urge', 'throw', 'something', 'TV', 'everytime', 'was', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'urge', 'reach', 'screen', 'slap', 'judges', 'who', 'made', 'outrageous', 'decisions', 'escpecially', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'swallowing', 'TUMs', 'part', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'having', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'stupid', 'was', 'show', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'wanting', 'do', 'show', 'boyfriend', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'enough', 'personal', 'information', 'given', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'Van', 'Buren', 'marriage', 'break-up', 'cancer', 'new', 'boyfriend', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'can', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'kept', 'watching', 'continue', 'watching', 'syndication', 'actors', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'simply', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'are', 'ever', 'available', 'DVD', 'were', 'made', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Green', 'left', 'Elisabeth', 'Rohm', 'left', 'Again', 'love', 'McCoy', 'Van', 'Buren', 'not', 'enough', 'put', 'up', 'other', 'actors', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'deserved', '20', 'year', 'run', 'Just', 'wish', 'casting', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'recommend', 'show', 'up', 'years', 'mentioned']",N/A

Then among the police we have Jerry Orbach as the cop with the quips and he is marvelous too along with his take no prisoners female lieutenant. The stories remain a constant in this series, always following the headlines of the day.  First the crime is committed, then investigated and solved by the police and then tried by the D.A.'s office.  Frequently there is dissension about what the police want versus what the D.A.'s office can get. The biggest differences I find between the scripts of L&O right now from versus back then is that 1) the difference in how computers have taken over the L&O workplace, not to mention the crime it has added on and 2) the focus on terrorist activities.

1290272,A36F1MDLGGA0RN,B002UOMGWO,clutchhitter,"[13, 37]","OK, OK...so the DVD isn't out yet...I can still comment on the show as I remember it. A superb packaging doesn't make it better or worse.This was Benjamin Bratt's second season (after replacing Chris Noth) and Cary Lowell's first season (replacing Jill Hennessy.) I've already commented that Ben Bratt was a ratings move rather than a quality move. He wasn't bad, he just broke the spell of the ""New York"" feel to the show we had with Chris Noth and Jerry Orbach as cynical cops. They may not have had much contrast, but it felt more real to THIS New Yorker.Cary Lowell in for the (supposedly) dead Jill Hennessy....OK, didn't hurt nor help, since they were both cut from the same privileged Ivy-League character.Anyway, episodes in this season started to ""borrow"" from earlier episodes: Briscoe is accused of corruption and needs to wear a wire (""The Blue Wall"" season one.) Criminal investigations are again stalled by technicalities (Causa Mortis...the tape is inadmissible.) A sequel to the Season 3 (or 4) ""Malcolm X""-type shooting...with an equally unsatisfying ending.I noticed this season, the writers were happy to allow murderers to go free and endings to lack finality or completeness...they spun it as realistic...I took it as lazy.The show also broke out of its ""city"" mold with stories about suburban Soccer Moms and a 3-PARTER in LOS ANGELES !!!There are some great episodes: Matrimony, from the Anna Nicole Smith case, Karen Allen as a basket-case survivor, ""Barter"" an interesting spin on the loan business, Burt Young as a paroled serial-rapist, a race against time bargain with a cop shooter...etc.The best episode of the season (i.e. where the plot gets more and more twisted thought the entire hour) is ""Past Imperfect"" about a murdered actress...well, it's about that for 10 minutes.Anyway, my point is, in Season 7 confirmed that Season 6 was not a fluke...the varying quality of the episodes had slipped further and that the ""street"" feel to the show was gone: Curtis is a family man, Lenny tries to be a better father, Cary Lowell fixed up McCoy with a date instead of sleeping with him....political correctness had crept in and flawed characters had less flaws.The show never really recovered...subsequent seasons saw the loss of the intricate plotting where the whodunnit, followed by the ""whydunnit"" was replaced with polemics and weak endings.Season 8 was about the same (no cast changes) and the ratio of good to bad was the same...but with Season 9...watch out.",3,Rating the 7th season as I watched it then....,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2492,"['OK', 'OK', 'so', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'comment', 'show', 'remember', 'superb', 'packaging', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'worse.This', 'was', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'second', 'season', 'replacing', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Cary', 'Lowell', 'first', 'season', 'replacing', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', ""'ve"", 'already', 'commented', 'Ben', 'Bratt', 'was', 'ratings', 'move', 'rather', 'quality', 'move', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'broke', 'spell', 'New', 'York', 'feel', 'show', 'had', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'cynical', 'cops', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'contrast', 'felt', 'more', 'real', 'THIS', 'New', 'Yorker.Cary', 'Lowell', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', '.OK', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'help', 'were', 'cut', 'same', 'privileged', 'Ivy-League', 'character.Anyway', 'season', 'started', 'borrow', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Briscoe', 'accused', 'corruption', 'wear', 'wire', 'Blue', 'Wall', 'season', 'one', 'Criminal', 'investigations', 'are', 'again', 'stalled', 'technicalities', 'Causa', 'Mortis', 'tape', 'inadmissible', 'sequel', 'Season', '3', '4', 'Malcolm', 'X', '-type', 'shooting', 'equally', 'unsatisfying', 'ending.I', 'noticed', 'season', 'writers', 'were', 'happy', 'allow', 'murderers', 'go', 'free', 'endings', 'lack', 'finality', 'completeness', 'spun', 'realistic', 'took', 'lazy.The', 'show', 'also', 'broke', 'city', 'mold', 'stories', 'suburban', 'Soccer', 'Moms', '3-PARTER', 'LOS', 'ANGELES', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'Matrimony', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Smith', 'case', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'basket-case', 'survivor', 'Barter', 'interesting', 'spin', 'loan', 'business', 'Burt', 'Young', 'paroled', 'serial-rapist', 'race', 'time', 'bargain', 'cop', 'shooter', 'etc.The', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'i.e', 'where', 'plot', 'more', 'more', 'twisted', 'thought', 'entire', 'hour', 'Past', 'Imperfect', 'murdered', 'actress', 'well', '10', 'minutes.Anyway', 'point', 'Season', '7', 'confirmed', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'not', 'fluke', 'varying', 'quality', 'episodes', 'had', 'slipped', 'further', 'street', 'feel', 'show', 'was', 'gone', 'Curtis', 'family', 'man', 'Lenny', 'be', 'better', 'father', 'Cary', 'Lowell', 'fixed', 'up', 'McCoy', 'date', 'instead', 'sleeping', '.political', 'correctness', 'had', 'crept', 'flawed', 'characters', 'had', 'less', 'flaws.The', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'recovered', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'saw', 'loss', 'intricate', 'plotting', 'where', 'whodunnit', 'followed', 'whydunnit', 'was', 'replaced', 'polemics', 'weak', 'endings.Season', '8', 'was', 'same', 'cast', 'changes', 'ratio', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'same', 'Season', '9', 'watch']",N/A

1290277,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B002UOMGWO,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[0, 0]","Because I am a HUGE fan of Benjamin Bratt (hence my screen-name!) the seasons where he appears (Seasons 6, 7, 8 & 9) are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITES (though since I really like Jill Hennessy/Claire Kincaid, I LOVE Seasons 4 and 5 as well) of the ENTIRE 20-season series ofLaw & OrderThere are some seasons of Law & Order which are my favorites, and other seasons which I do NOT really like -- and its all based on the particular cast of characters (and actors/actresses) during that season.I have many FAVORITE characters on the show, including Rey Curtis (obviously!), Jamie Ross, Claire Kincaid, Anita van Buren, Lennie Briscoe & Jack McCoy (of course!), Mike Logan, Abbie Carmichael, Ben Stone and Adam Schiff, and I LOVE the seasons they are in. But by the same token, I HATE Arthur Branch, Kevin Bernard, Cyrus Lupo & Ed Green, and I don't really like the characters of Michael Cutter, Serena Southerlyn, Alexandra Borgia, Connie Rubirosa, Nick Falco, Joe Fontana or Nina Cassady very much, so I HATE (or don't care very much for) the seasons that they are in.Also, though I liked the CHARACTERS of Max Greevey, Phil Cerreta, Don Cragen & Paul Robinette, because there were NO women characters in the main cast, during  the seasons in which they appeared (Seasons 1, 2, and 3) the show was way too male-heavy/male-centric. Which is why I do NOT like the first three seasons of the show, and its the reason that even though I liked Greevey, Cerreta & Robinette, and I LOVE Don Cragen on Law & Order SVU, I was glad when their characters were replaced with females (Claire Kincaid for Paul Robinette and Anita van Buren for Don Cragen)So basically, I do NOT like either the first three seasons of the show, nor *most* of the episodes after Season 9 (though there are individual episodes after that, which I DO like!). Seasons 4-9 are my favorites in this series, and barring any massive price reduction and/or multi-season ""bundling"" discounts, they are the ONLY seasons I plan to get on DVD.Out of the 6 seasons (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9) I plan to get, so far, I have gotten the DVD sets for Seasons 7, 8 and 9 (though I did not get them from Amazon -- I can't remember now, exactly where I got them, probably Best Buy [or Circuit City, when they were still in business], or Kmart or the like) and I LOVE Season 7!This 5-disc DVD set contains all 23 episodes of the 7th season (which aired in 1996-97). Just as in other seasons, the episodes in Season 7 are full of gripping cases that are often ""ripped from the headlines"" like, for example, the episode, ""Causa Mortis"" (which was based on the March 1996 murder of New Jersey schoolteacher Kathleen Weinstein)Also, just as in other seasons,Law & Order: The Seventh Yearhas many notable guest stars including Taye Diggs, Janeane Garofalo, Jerry Stiller, Karen Allen, Frances Sternhagen, Arija Bareikis, Felicity Huffman, Elaine Stritch, Scott Cohen, Lauren Graham, Keith Szarabajka, Edie Falco, and Giancarlo Esposito & Jennifer Esposito, among othes. Joining together with these wonderful guest stars are the EXCELLENT series regulars including Benjamin Bratt, Jerry Orbach, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston, and Steven Hill,  together with Carey Lowell who joins Law & Order in her first season as ADA Jamie Ross, replacing Jill Hennessy who played Claire Kincaid, and left the show at the end of Season 6.While I LOVE nearly all (if not, ALL) of the episodes in this season, I'd have to say that my MOST FAVORITE episode this season is the season premiere episode ""Causa Mortis"". Other favorite episodes include ""Double-Blind"", ""Legacy"" and most of all, ""We Like Mike""!!Also even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have a couple complaints about it. The first (and IMHO, the biggest) problem with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging -- which is one of the main reasons I gave this set 4 stars instead of 5 stars. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding individual plastic DVD cases (the style used for THIS set, as well as forLaw & Order: Season Eight) I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case forLaw & Order: The Ninth Year) instead! I am kind of anal about my DVD sets, and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! Which is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get edgewear, shelfwear and corner-wear, scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!My other complaint with this DVD set, is that there are NO Special Features or Bonuses. NO deleted scenes, NO bloopers, no commentary, no interviews with cast or producers/directors, no trailers, NOTHING!It's really disappointing!When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like Full House and Who's the Boss?) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the $30 or $40+ retail price!But aside from the HORRIBLE packaging, and the lack of any Special Features or bonuses, this DVD set is still a GREAT (though very BASIC) set. Even thoughLaw & Orderairs often in syndication and/or on cable, since there are 456 episodes total in the 20-season series, the chance of having a desired episode airing at any given time is very slim (though for those with Netflix service, seasons 1-8 available for Instant Video Streaming) so for those who love ""Law & Order"", particularly those who are fans of Season 7, this DVD set is a
