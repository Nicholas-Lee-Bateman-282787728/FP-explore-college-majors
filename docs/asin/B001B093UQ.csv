It just may have been a not me story so I cant comment really.  I do recommend watching it as it is not the usual movie of good guy, bad guy or romance.

I got it as I am a Ian Somerhalder fan (well actually Vampire Diaries fan) and was interested in some of the other work he has done.  The movie story is about how the events in ones life can mould that persons future.  Ian and the book seller are linked through the death of a young boy. The other characters have their own issues but their paths cross those of Ian and the book seller. Ians voice the same but he had longish hair, which I am not used to.  Events unfold to the point where the book seller and Ian are greiving about the same situation, at the same time in the same place.  The book seller is on the way to recovery but I guess Ian was not - had to put my own interpretation on it. Most memorable two moments - Ian smoking a cigarette and Ian trying to portray grief - his face twisted crying and all I could see was his pretty white teeth (which seemed out of place) and his beautiful face as per Damon Salvador from Vampire Diaries.  I am glad his acting has improved but I guess we all have to start somewhere.",3,WEIRD,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,1085,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'more', 'film', 'festival', 'type', 'movie', 'got', 'am', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'fan', 'well', 'actually', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'fan', 'was', 'interested', 'other', 'work', 'done', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'events', 'ones', 'life', 'can', 'mould', 'persons', 'future', 'Ian', 'book', 'seller', 'are', 'linked', 'death', 'young', 'boy', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'paths', 'cross', 'Ian', 'book', 'seller', 'Ians', 'voice', 'same', 'had', 'longish', 'hair', 'am', 'not', 'used', 'Events', 'unfold', 'point', 'where', 'book', 'seller', 'Ian', 'are', 'greiving', 'same', 'situation', 'same', 'time', 'same', 'place', 'book', 'seller', 'way', 'recovery', 'guess', 'Ian', 'was', 'not', 'had', 'put', 'own', 'interpretation', 'Most', 'memorable', 'two', 'moments', 'Ian', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'Ian', 'trying', 'portray', 'grief', 'face', 'twisted', 'crying', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'pretty', 'white', 'teeth', 'seemed', 'place', 'beautiful', 'face', 'Damon', 'Salvador', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'am', 'glad', 'acting', 'improved', 'guess', 'have', 'start', 'somewhere']",The Sensation of Sight
1169510,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B001B093UQ,Midwest Book Review,"[3, 4]","A multiple award winning independent film, ""The Sensation Of Sight"" is the story of Finn, a middle-aged English teacher entering a mid-life crisis precipitated by personal tragedy. Finn sells encyclopedias to town locals, as his anxieties mount and he finds himself pursued by an unrelenting ghost. This is the deftly portrayed story of loneliness and disconnection that in the end leads to an unanticipated awakening and personal redemption. Showcasing the talents of David Starthairn, Ian Somerhalder, Daniel Gillies, Jane Adams, Ann Cusack, Elisabeth Waterston, Joe Mazzello, and Scott Wilson, all under the direction of Aaron J. Wiederspahn, ""The Sensation Of Sight"" is an enthusiastically recommended addition to personal and community library DVD film collections.",5,A multiple award winning independent film,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,770,"['multiple', 'award', 'winning', 'independent', 'film', 'Sensation', 'Sight', 'story', 'Finn', 'middle-aged', 'English', 'teacher', 'entering', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'precipitated', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'Finn', 'encyclopedias', 'town', 'locals', 'anxieties', 'mount', 'pursued', 'unrelenting', 'ghost', 'deftly', 'portrayed', 'story', 'loneliness', 'disconnection', 'end', 'unanticipated', 'awakening', 'personal', 'redemption', 'Showcasing', 'talents', 'David', 'Starthairn', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'Ann', 'Cusack', 'Elisabeth', 'Waterston', 'Joe', 'Mazzello', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'direction', 'Aaron', 'J.', 'Wiederspahn', 'Sensation', 'Sight', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended', 'addition', 'personal', 'community', 'library', 'DVD', 'film', 'collections']",The Sensation of Sight
1169511,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B001B093UQ,Yasha Banana,"[5, 19]","You're kidding me with this facockta movie.  This is the most tedious, boring, pointless, pretentious movie I've ever seen.First of all, let's address all this hype about this movie being ""about life.""  Are you serious?  OK, the protangonist, David Strathairn, is a teacher who witnesses one of his students commit suicide, right in his class. ... Are we told WHY?  No.Then there's another thread to the script in which a young man is estranged from his father. Are we told WHY he's estranged from his father?  No.  Not a clue.And what does the teacher, David Strathairn, do?  He quits teaching and sells encyclopedias door-to-door -- the encyclopedias he was given by the suicidal student. ... Oh YEEEAH!  Sure! ... And he sells them not as a ""set"" but volume at a time.Then throughout the movie there's this guy who doesn't say anything -- whereupon in the last few minutes we come to find out that he's the ghost of the student who blew his brains out. ... And guess what David Strathairn does -- he shoots the ghost!  He shoots the ghost in one of the most tedious scenes ever commited to celluloid.My God, what an incredibly pretentious movie!I don't say that the movie was photographed poorly; it wasn't.  But it's about absolutely nothing.  You can't purport to tell a meaningful story and then *not* tell a story.  At all!You can't purport to make a film ""about life"" and then render the plot, the structure, the dialogue, and the character-interaction ... lifeless.A great deal is made of the various plots in this movie being ""interwoven.""  They're not!  They don't relate at all to one another.  One dizzy gal asks David Strathairn, the encyclopedia salesman, if she's sexy.  OK, lady, you're sexy.  But what's the point?  Ok, fine, she's lonely.  Yeah, we get it.  But then what?  There has to be some meaning, even if it's simply impressionist, to her lonliness.  But the only impression I get form these characters is that they're over-socialized, self-centered, and incredibly boring.Yes, there exists in the world a great deal of loneliness, but to make a meaningful movie about loneliness you can't simply *refer* to it and then point to yourself and say: ""Look at my film, it's about loneliness.  I Have all these lonely people in it.""  You can't simply have actors wandering around cryptically referring to tragedies in their lives that the audience doesn't have a clue about.A (relatively) young woman is concerned about whether she's sexy.  So she asks this lonely, traumatized salesman if she's sexy.  And he takes five minutes and twelve camera angles to say yes. ... And then what?  I suppose we the audience are supposed to say: ""Gee, have I learned a lot about life from this gal!""  (Not!)The movie is especially annoying when it periodically quotes people like Shelley and Plato and Lord Chesterton; as if to say: ""See, what these guys are saying is what's being said in the movie.""  But guess what, sports fans, this movie *isn't* about what these famous people have said about life.  It's just a cheap high school trick whereby a lazy student punches up his or her really poor, really disjointed, really pretentious term paper with quotes from people the student *wish* had written their term paper.Finally, I had a great deal of respect for David Strathairn *before* this movie.  I appreciated the fact that he's been very selective in the roles he's accepted.  But when I saw this movie and then saw that he also *produced* the movie, phffft! out the window went my respect for him.This movie is right up there with ""The Big Chill"" and ""Ordinary People"" for precocious, self-righteousness, empty-headedness, psycho-babble fiddle-faddle.  In short, it stinks.  On ice.In fact, if you look the ""S"" voulme of any encyclopedia, under the word ""stinkeroo"" you'll see a cast picture of this turkey.",1,Simply Awful.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,3823,"[""'re"", 'kidding', 'facockta', 'movie', 'most', 'tedious', 'boring', 'pointless', 'pretentious', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.First', 'let', 'address', 'hype', 'movie', 'being', 'life', 'Are', 'serious', 'OK', 'protangonist', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'teacher', 'who', 'one', 'students', 'commit', 'suicide', 'right', 'class', 'Are', 'told', 'WHY', 'No.Then', 'thread', 'script', 'young', 'man', 'estranged', 'father', 'Are', 'told', 'WHY', 'estranged', 'father', 'No', 'Not', 'clue.And', 'teacher', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'do', 'teaching', 'encyclopedias', 'door-to-door', 'encyclopedias', 'was', 'given', 'suicidal', 'student', 'Oh', 'YEEEAH', 'Sure', 'not', 'set', 'volume', 'time.Then', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'whereupon', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'ghost', 'student', 'who', 'blew', 'brains', 'out', 'guess', 'what', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'ghost', 'shoots', 'ghost', 'one', 'most', 'tedious', 'scenes', 'ever', 'commited', 'celluloid.My', 'God', 'what', 'incredibly', 'pretentious', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'photographed', 'poorly', 'was', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'purport', 'tell', 'meaningful', 'story', 'then', '*not*', 'tell', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'purport', 'make', 'film', 'life', 'then', 'render', 'plot', 'structure', 'dialogue', 'character-interaction', 'great', 'deal', 'made', 'various', 'plots', 'movie', 'being', 'interwoven', ""'re"", 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'one', 'One', 'dizzy', 'gal', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'encyclopedia', 'salesman', 'sexy', 'OK', 'lady', ""'re"", 'sexy', 'what', 'point', 'Ok', 'fine', 'lonely', 'Yeah', 'get', 'then', 'what', 'be', 'meaning', 'even', 'simply', 'impressionist', 'lonliness', 'only', 'impression', 'get', 'form', 'characters', ""'re"", 'over-socialized', 'self-centered', 'incredibly', 'boring.Yes', 'world', 'great', 'deal', 'loneliness', 'make', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'loneliness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', '*refer*', 'then', 'point', 'say', 'Look', 'film', 'loneliness', 'Have', 'lonely', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'have', 'actors', 'wandering', 'around', 'cryptically', 'referring', 'tragedies', 'lives', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'about.A', 'relatively', 'young', 'woman', 'concerned', 'sexy', 'lonely', 'traumatized', 'salesman', 'sexy', 'five', 'minutes', 'twelve', 'camera', 'angles', 'say', 'yes', 'then', 'what', 'suppose', 'audience', 'are', 'supposed', 'say', 'Gee', 'have', 'learned', 'lot', 'life', 'gal', 'Not', 'movie', 'especially', 'annoying', 'when', 'periodically', 'people', 'Shelley', 'Plato', 'Lord', 'Chesterton', 'say', 'See', 'what', 'guys', 'are', 'saying', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'guess', 'what', 'sports', 'fans', 'movie', 'what', 'famous', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'life', 'just', 'cheap', 'high', 'school', 'trick', 'whereby', 'lazy', 'student', 'up', 'really', 'poor', 'really', 'disjointed', 'really', 'pretentious', 'term', 'paper', 'quotes', 'people', 'student', '*wish*', 'had', 'written', 'term', 'paper.Finally', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'David', 'Strathairn', '*before*', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'been', 'very', 'selective', 'roles', 'accepted', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'then', 'saw', 'also', '*produced*', 'movie', 'phffft', 'window', 'went', 'respect', 'him.This', 'movie', 'right', 'there', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'precocious', 'self-righteousness', 'empty-headedness', 'psycho-babble', 'fiddle-faddle', 'short', 'ice.In', 'fact', 'look', 'S', 'voulme', 'encyclopedia', 'word', 'stinkeroo', ""'ll"", 'see', 'cast', 'picture', 'turkey']",The Sensation of Sight
