232482,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300268543,Annie Van Auken,"[11, 12]","Three years beforeTHE GODFATHER(1972) was released, director Francis Ford Coppola and actors James Caan and Robert Duvall worked together on THE RAIN PEOPLE. Scripted by Coppola, this movie combines feminism with elements of John Steinbeck's 1937 novella,OF MICE AND MEN.According to Jimmy 'Killer' Kilgannon, ""rain people"" are normal-sized folks who are made of raindrops; when they cry themselves out, the rain people disappear.SYNOPSIS--Natalie Ravenna (Knight) is pregnant and panicked. Feeling trapped, Nat flees her Long Island marriage to Vinny (Modica--voice only) and hits the road to points unknown. She picks up an attractive young crewcut-topped hitchhiker. 'Killer' Kilgannon (Caan) played varsity football until a severe head injury left him brain-disabled. Killer remained at the college, raking leaves for them until he was given $1000 and told to go away.Feeling sympathy for this sweet but simple-minded fellow, Natalie offers a ride to West Virginia, where Killer believes his ex-girlfriend's dad has a drive-in theater job waiting for him. When they arrive unannounced, Ellen (Crews) tells her father not to hire Killer and she rudely demands that he and Nat leave.Natalie abandons Killer in Chattanooga, but has second thoughts. Continuing west, they stop at a small Nebraska town, where Nat finds a utility job for Killer at a reptile zoo. His new employer, Mr. Alfred (Aldredge) convinces the young man to hand over all his cash for safekeeping. Natalie fears Alfred will cheat Killer out of that savings but is more concerned about escaping alone.Nat drives hurriedly off and gets stopped by motorcycle cop Gordon (Duvall) for speeding. A $40 citation must be paid at the reptile zoo. Despite her pleas not to force a return there, Gordon escorts Nat back and they encounter a scene of chaos. Killer has let hundreds of chicks out of their cages. Mr. Alfred discharges him and as Justice of the Peace he levies an $800 fine for property damage.Again, Natalie is stuck with Killer. She's arranged a date with the cop and tells Killer to wait in her car. While Nat visits Gordon's trailer home, Killer wanders around outside. He peeks in a window and sees Gordon trying to force himself on Nat, so Killer angrily tears open the trailer door and attacks the cop.....Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(6.9) The Rain People (1969) - James Caan/Shirley Knight/Robert Duvall/Marya Zimmet/Tom Aldredge/Laura Crews/Andrew Duncan",4,Of Chicks and People,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,2511,"['Three', 'years', 'beforeTHE', 'GODFATHER', '1972', 'was', 'released', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'actors', 'James', 'Caan', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'worked', 'together', 'THE', 'RAIN', 'PEOPLE', 'Scripted', 'Coppola', 'movie', 'feminism', 'elements', 'John', 'Steinbeck', '1937', 'novella', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MEN.According', 'Jimmy', ""'Killer"", 'Kilgannon', 'rain', 'people', 'are', 'normal-sized', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'made', 'raindrops', 'when', 'cry', 'out', 'rain', 'people', 'disappear.SYNOPSIS', 'Natalie', 'Ravenna', 'Knight', 'pregnant', 'panicked', 'Feeling', 'trapped', 'Nat', 'Long', 'Island', 'marriage', 'Vinny', 'Modica', 'voice', 'only', 'road', 'points', 'unknown', 'up', 'attractive', 'young', 'crewcut-topped', 'hitchhiker', 'Kilgannon', 'Caan', 'played', 'varsity', 'football', 'severe', 'head', 'injury', 'left', 'brain-disabled', 'Killer', 'remained', 'college', 'raking', 'leaves', 'was', 'given', '1000', 'told', 'go', 'away.Feeling', 'sympathy', 'sweet', 'simple-minded', 'fellow', 'Natalie', 'ride', 'West', 'Virginia', 'where', 'Killer', 'ex-girlfriend', 'dad', 'drive-in', 'theater', 'job', 'waiting', 'When', 'arrive', 'unannounced', 'Ellen', 'Crews', 'father', 'not', 'hire', 'Killer', 'rudely', 'Nat', 'leave.Natalie', 'abandons', 'Killer', 'Chattanooga', 'second', 'thoughts', 'Continuing', 'west', 'stop', 'small', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'where', 'Nat', 'utility', 'job', 'Killer', 'reptile', 'zoo', 'new', 'employer', 'Mr.', 'Alfred', 'Aldredge', 'young', 'man', 'hand', 'over', 'cash', 'safekeeping', 'Natalie', 'Alfred', 'will', 'cheat', 'Killer', 'savings', 'more', 'concerned', 'escaping', 'alone.Nat', 'drives', 'hurriedly', 'stopped', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'Gordon', 'Duvall', 'speeding', '40', 'citation', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'reptile', 'zoo', 'pleas', 'not', 'force', 'return', 'there', 'Gordon', 'Nat', 'back', 'encounter', 'scene', 'chaos', 'Killer', 'let', 'hundreds', 'chicks', 'cages', 'Mr.', 'Alfred', 'Justice', 'Peace', '800', 'fine', 'property', 'damage.Again', 'Natalie', 'stuck', 'Killer', 'arranged', 'date', 'cop', 'Killer', 'wait', 'car', 'Nat', 'Gordon', 'trailer', 'home', 'Killer', 'outside', 'window', 'sees', 'Gordon', 'trying', 'force', 'Nat', 'so', 'Killer', 'angrily', 'open', 'trailer', 'door', 'cop', '..Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', 'found', 'film', 'resource', 'website', '6.9', 'Rain', 'People', '1969', 'James', 'Caan/Shirley', 'Knight/Robert', 'Duvall/Marya', 'Zimmet/Tom', 'Aldredge/Laura', 'Crews/Andrew', 'Duncan']",N/A
232483,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,6300268543,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[0, 0]","1969 was the year of the road film, no small part due to Easy Rider. Rain People is one of the best of these.Pregnent Natalie leaves her husband in New York and picks up a hitch-hicker. Killer, James Caan, is a ex-football player who has a brain injury. Despite several attempts to find him a job and board on the road, Killer is a lost soul--a man-child with no purpose. Natalie, unwittingly, becomes his care taker. Natalie is running scared, however, and is conflicted about her role.This is absolutley a charactor driven film. The plot is simple and would be mondane if it not for the interaction between the charactors. Watching how Killer connects himself to Natale and how she wants to let him go but can't makes a fascinating dynamic. He wants to find a place to belong but knows he can't. She wants to be free, but does not have the heart to abandon him. This conflict is the thread that makes the film work.Unlike Easy Rider or even Five Easy Pieces, Rain People is not a bohemian journey. These people are running scared, not looking to find themselves. The road is not a charactor  as in many of this period's films. Rain People has little to do with what was happening in 1969. It just happened to be made that year.Francis Ford Coppola filmed Rain People with a small scope: lots of close ups, lots of long scenes in the car, and dialouge which has the intimacy of real conversation. The flims late 60s, up close cinamatic style almost gives the feel of watching a documentry, and one that puts you in the car with these two decent but sad drifters.Excellent work",4,excellent,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1577,"['1969', 'was', 'year', 'road', 'film', 'small', 'part', 'due', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'People', 'one', 'best', 'these.Pregnent', 'Natalie', 'husband', 'New', 'York', 'up', 'hitch-hicker', 'Killer', 'James', 'Caan', 'ex-football', 'player', 'who', 'brain', 'injury', 'several', 'attempts', 'find', 'job', 'board', 'road', 'Killer', 'lost', 'soul', 'man-child', 'purpose', 'Natalie', 'unwittingly', 'care', 'taker', 'Natalie', 'running', 'scared', 'however', 'conflicted', 'role.This', 'charactor', 'driven', 'film', 'plot', 'simple', 'would', 'be', 'mondane', 'not', 'interaction', 'charactors', 'Watching', 'how', 'Killer', 'Natale', 'how', 'let', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fascinating', 'dynamic', 'find', 'place', 'belong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'free', 'not', 'have', 'heart', 'abandon', 'conflict', 'thread', 'film', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'even', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'Rain', 'People', 'not', 'bohemian', 'journey', 'people', 'are', 'running', 'scared', 'not', 'looking', 'find', 'road', 'not', 'charactor', 'many', 'period', 'films', 'Rain', 'People', 'little', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'happening', '1969', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'made', 'year.Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'filmed', 'Rain', 'People', 'small', 'scope', 'lots', 'close', 'ups', 'lots', 'long', 'scenes', 'car', 'dialouge', 'intimacy', 'real', 'conversation', 'flims', 'late', '60s', 'up', 'close', 'cinamatic', 'style', 'almost', 'feel', 'watching', 'documentry', 'one', 'car', 'two', 'decent', 'sad', 'drifters.Excellent', 'work']",N/A
232484,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6300268543,Bomojaz,"[7, 9]","Shirley Knight plays a young Long Island housewife who finds herself pregnant and unsure she wants the child. She bolts out the door and hits the road in a station wagon. She feels trapped in her life and decides to break out by picking up a hitchhiker, James Caan. He turns out to be a brain-damaged ex-football player who can hardly fend for himself. She feels responsible for him, can't dump him - so her bolt for freedom becomes a very real restraint on her life. That, of course, is the main point of the movie, which was written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola - a good theme for sure, and for the most part done well, despite our being hit over the head with it to make sure we get it.Caan is excellent as the deadhead; Knight is good, too, but hardly a sympathetic character. This was one of the first of many movies about women questioning their roles in society, and one of the better ones because of its emphasis on responsibility. The ending is shattering and ironic, with Caan dying in Knight's arms after trying to ""save"" her from what he thinks is an attack on her by a cop (played by Robert Duvall).

232485,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300268543,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","If Francis Ford Coppola is to get back into the game it would do him no harm in returning to small films like this and ""The Conversation"" as a point of reference.  This film seers itself into your consciousness more than a million ""One From the Hearts"" ever will.  The film concerns itself with a young Long Island housewife(Shirley Knight) who feels trapped in her marriage and takes it on the lam to sort things out.  She's two months pregnant and is confused as to whether to carry it to term.  Along the way she picks up a handsome ex-college football player(James Caan) and soon it becomes apparent that he is more than a little slow on the intake.  Despite her half-hearted efforts to ditch him she cannot extricate herself from him, probably a combination of his neediness and her nascent maternal instincts.  In Nebraska, she hooks up with an apparently nice highway patrolman(Robert Duvall) and it's her encounter with him that brings the story to a memorably tragic conclusion.  If one is to describe ""The Rain People"" it would be to say it is humanistic.  The characters are flawed but Coppola paints them as inticate human beings.  Two things stand out here for me.  The heartbreaking telephone conversations between Knight and the husband she left behind.  The fact that one is a disembodied voice adds power to these encounters.  Caan's performance is one for the ages.  His Jimmy is not a cliched depiction of a mentally challenged person but one of great nuance.  His work here stands alongside his Sonny in ""The Godfather"".  This film may not be well known but that doesn't obscure it's greatness.",5,Haunting Early Masterwork From Coppola,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1614,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'would', 'do', 'harm', 'returning', 'small', 'films', 'Conversation', 'point', 'reference', 'film', 'consciousness', 'more', 'million', 'One', 'Hearts', 'ever', 'will', 'film', 'concerns', 'young', 'Long', 'Island', 'housewife', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'who', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'lam', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'two', 'months', 'pregnant', 'confused', 'carry', 'term', 'way', 'up', 'handsome', 'ex-college', 'football', 'player', 'James', 'Caan', 'soon', 'apparent', 'more', 'little', 'slow', 'intake', 'half-hearted', 'efforts', 'ditch', 'can', 'not', 'extricate', 'probably', 'combination', 'neediness', 'nascent', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'Nebraska', 'up', 'apparently', 'nice', 'highway', 'patrolman', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'encounter', 'story', 'memorably', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'one', 'describe', 'Rain', 'People', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'humanistic', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'Coppola', 'inticate', 'human', 'beings', 'Two', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'here', 'heartbreaking', 'telephone', 'conversations', 'Knight', 'husband', 'left', 'behind', 'fact', 'one', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'power', 'encounters', 'Caan', 'performance', 'one', 'ages', 'Jimmy', 'not', 'cliched', 'depiction', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'one', 'great', 'nuance', 'work', 'here', 'Sonny', 'Godfather', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'well', 'known', ""n't"", 'obscure', 'greatness']",N/A
232486,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6300268543,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 1]","Looking at ""The Rain People"" you would never believe that the people who made this film ultimately would go on to fame and fortune. Uninspired acting and dreadful direction coupled with a dreary script turn a ""road"" adventure into muck.Shirley Knight (1936) plays a pregnant housewife who leaves her devoted husband in search of ""herself"". Knight was nominated twice for an Oscar (""Sweet Bird of Youth"", ""Dark at the Top of the Stairs"") and three times for a Golden Globe, winning for ""Indictment: The McMartin Trial"" (1995). She won 3 Emmys, including an episode of ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Thirtysomething"". But in this film she seems lost.James Caan (1940) plays a former college football hero who suffered brain damage, has been released by his school, and hitch hikes his way into Knight's life. Caan is best known as Sonny Corleone, the role for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1973. Over more than 100 roles he's been nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and for an Emmy once. From 2003 to 2007 he had his own TV series, ""Las Vegas"". In this film he appears to take his dramatic cues from Sasquatch.Robert Duvall (1931) plays a motorcycle cop who comes upon the strange couple as they pass through Nebraska.  Duvall loves playing southerners and in westerns. He was nominated 6 times for an Oscar, winning once for ""Tender Mercies"" (1983). He won a BAFTA as the helicopter officer in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and an Emmy for his work on ""Broken Trail"" (2006). He is the least bad of the actors, although that isn't saying much.FWIW - Duvall and Caan were roommates. They appeared together for the first time in ""Countdown"" (1968) and this was their second film together. They went on to do ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Killer Elite"" (1975).The worst review must go to Francis Ford Coppola. This was his 7th film as a director, following the moderately successful ""Finian's Rainbow"" (1968) and ""You're a Big Boy Now"" (1966). As a director Coppola has 5 Oscar nominations and a win for Godfather 2"" (1974). He won the Palme d'Or for ""The Conversation"" (1974) and ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).Interior shots are static and badly lit. The exterior shots seem to go on forever, with this angle, that angle, another angle, etc. All of them without true purpose, adding nothing to the film except length. And the quick flashbacks and flash forwards are more distracting than revealing. It's hard to believe that Coppola considered this one of his 5 best films. It's probably because it was his first Zoetrope release and involved his wife and friends, including George Lucas.The NY Times called it ""an example of youthful cinematic excess"" Variety called it ""overlong, brooding"".Bottom line - a really poor film that bears watching only to see how people with such great talent could do such a poor job.",2,Practice makes perfect,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,2798,"['Looking', 'Rain', 'People', 'would', 'never', 'believe', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'ultimately', 'would', 'go', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Uninspired', 'acting', 'dreadful', 'direction', 'coupled', 'dreary', 'script', 'turn', 'road', 'adventure', 'muck.Shirley', 'Knight', '1936', 'pregnant', 'housewife', 'who', 'devoted', 'husband', 'search', 'Knight', 'was', 'nominated', 'twice', 'Oscar', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', 'Dark', 'Top', 'Stairs', 'three', 'times', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winning', 'Indictment', 'McMartin', 'Trial', '1995', 'won', '3', 'Emmys', 'including', 'episode', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Thirtysomething', 'film', 'lost.James', 'Caan', '1940', 'former', 'college', 'football', 'hero', 'who', 'suffered', 'brain', 'damage', 'been', 'released', 'school', 'hitch', 'hikes', 'way', 'Knight', 'life', 'Caan', 'best', 'known', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'role', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '1973', 'more', '100', 'roles', 'been', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', '4', 'times', 'Emmy', 'once', '2003', '2007', 'had', 'own', 'TV', 'series', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'film', 'take', 'dramatic', 'cues', 'Sasquatch.Robert', 'Duvall', '1931', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'who', 'strange', 'couple', 'pass', 'Nebraska', 'Duvall', 'playing', 'southerners', 'westerns', 'was', 'nominated', '6', 'times', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'once', 'Tender', 'Mercies', '1983', 'won', 'BAFTA', 'helicopter', 'officer', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '1979', 'Emmy', 'work', 'Broken', 'Trail', '2006', 'least', 'bad', 'actors', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much.FWIW', 'Duvall', 'Caan', 'were', 'roommates', 'appeared', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'Countdown', '1968', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'together', 'went', 'do', 'Godfather', '1972', 'Killer', 'Elite', '1975', '.The', 'worst', 'review', 'must', 'go', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'was', '7th', 'film', 'director', 'following', 'moderately', 'successful', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', '1968', ""'re"", 'Big', 'Boy', 'Now', '1966', 'director', 'Coppola', '5', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'win', 'Godfather', '2', '1974', 'won', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Conversation', '1974', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '1979', '.Interior', 'shots', 'are', 'static', 'badly', 'lit', 'exterior', 'shots', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'angle', 'angle', 'etc', 'true', 'purpose', 'adding', 'nothing', 'film', 'length', 'quick', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'are', 'more', 'distracting', 'revealing', 'hard', 'believe', 'Coppola', 'considered', 'one', '5', 'best', 'films', 'probably', 'was', 'first', 'Zoetrope', 'release', 'involved', 'wife', 'friends', 'including', 'George', 'Lucas.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'called', 'example', 'youthful', 'cinematic', 'excess', 'Variety', 'called', 'overlong', 'brooding', '.Bottom', 'line', 'really', 'poor', 'film', 'watching', 'only', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'could', 'do', 'poor', 'job']",N/A
