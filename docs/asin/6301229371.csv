247654,A3NYUJ3EVZZSBC,6301229371,libriarsque,"[3, 5]","This is one of my favorite romantic comedies, for several reasons: good writing, fine acting, London in the early 70's, and Glenda Jackson.  It evokes a time which was memorable for those of us who were born and raised during the turbulent 60's. After a decade of such angst, society seemed to regain a bit of self-deprecating humor with the dawn of the 70's. It is precisely that brand of humor that I find appealing in this film. The dialogue is sharp, sophisticated, and has the great good fortune to be delivered by two fine actors; Glenda Jackson being especially deft, tossing out acidly witty, intelligent retorts with withering English stoicism. She is clearly the ""class"" in the film.The story is a familiar one: divorced woman meets charming married man, they start having an affair and end up falling genuinely in love. The ending is inevitable. But this well-trod material is elevated by the intelligence and humour of both script and performance.Yes, it is ""dated"" -- the clothes, the coifs, phrases such as, ""He's my male secretary"", the rather pointed portrayal of a gay man -- but for those who like to wallow in nostalgia every once in a while, those things are positives rather than negatives.

247662,A4JHEO7H330AF,6301229371,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","A TOUCH OF CLASS is a 1 hour and 46 minute color movie from 1973, starring George Segal (born 1934) and Glenda Jackson (born 1936).  In a nutshell, two professional Londoners in their late 30s, interested in feeding their animal passions, decide to engage in a week of hanky-panky panky in a vacation resort in Spain.  However, a series of improbable and amusing incidents sets up a variety of roadblocks to their plans.  The screenplay is filled with lively barbs and amusing bickering.The film begins with an aerial shot of the Thames River in London, with bridges at the center, castles to the left, and apartment buildings to the right.  The first scene is in an urban park, with horseback riders, and a baseball game.  One of the baseball players wears a sweatshirt reading, ""HILLEL"" (a Jewish organization) while another player has a shirt reading, ""TURETSKY'S DELI"" (Turetsky's Deli has no presence on the internet).  Mr. Segal is in the outfield, about to catch a ball, and he trips over a boy.  The boy is Jackson's son.  ""Give me my ball, will you lady,"" says Segal.  ""Give me my kid, will you mister, if you finish trampling on him, that is,"" returns Jackson, establishing the theme of good-natured barbs that pepper the entire screenplay.  The umpire yells, ""FAIR BALL.""  Then, Segal from the outfield, yells and screams, disagreeing with the umpire.  Segal picks up the boy and brushes him off, demonstrating that he has an inherent good nature.  Jackson is the first to flirt, and Segal immediately detects this flirt.The next scene occurs in a rainstorm, perhaps a week later, when Segal and Jackson serendipitously meet while waiting for a taxi.  Segal is the first to make a move, and he asks Jackson out for a date for afternoon tea.  Segal asks her if she is concerned about the inconvenience of a 4 o'clock tea date.  Jackson responds, ""Don't cross-examine me in the rain, I'll be there.""  This is another example of the gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) barbs that the pair exchanges with each other in this movie.The next barbs are exchanged the following day at the tea date, when Jackson exclaims, ""From the way you played baseball, obviously you don't do that for a living.""  Then, they describe their own marriages.  Of his own marriage, Segal says, ""We've been married for 11 years and in all that time, I've never been unfaithful to her in the same city.""  (This reminds me of a line from NORTH BY NORTHWEST, where Cary Grant says, ""I never make love to a woman on an empty stomach.""  This line was spoken by Cary Grant, but the censors replaced the soundtrack with a different sentence.)At twelve minutes into A TOUCH OF CLASS, the pair is already discussing ""doing it.""  They migrate from the dining room of the hotel ot a bedroom suite upstairs.  Jackson says, ""You have brought me to this hideaway with the intention, I presume, of getting me into bed for what you men so charmingly call a quickie?""  Segal responds, ""Why do you women always thnk the worst?  Why does sex always have to be the first thing that . . . YES!""  Then, Jackson complains about the hotel room, referring to it as an ""overworked little joy-station where the sheets haven't been changed in a week . . . and I have to be back in my office in, Christ, a half an hour.""  Jackson suggests that they have a tryst out of town.  At 14 minutes into the movie, Segal has decided that the tryst will occur in Malaga, Spain.  The next scene takes place in Jackson's office, which is in a company that manufactures knock-offs of clothing that had been designed by high-profile fashion designers.  The movie does a good job at showing Jackson's work routine, and her interactions with her co-workers.At 18 minutes into the movie, Segal is at the travel agent, and from that point on, until the end of the movie, the viewer is treated to an amusing romp of overblown misunderstandings, and amusing turns-of-fate that cause Segal and Jackson to be annoyed.  For example, at the airport in London, Segal runs into a professional colleague (Walter) who is also booking a flight to Malaga.  The result is that Segal must conceal the fact that he is with Jackson.  This proves to be a challenging inconvenience to Segal, as he must conceal the fact that he is with Jackson, during the airplane flight, during his negotiations with rental car agency, and during his vacation activities in Malaga.CONCLUSION.  As with many activities in real life, it is the case that the viewer watching A TOUCH OF CLASS must ignore the fact that a particular problem does not exist, in order to get the job done.  Thus, in order to accomplish the task of enjoying this film, the viewer will need to ignore the fact that Segal is happily married.  In other words, if you allow the infidelity and hanky-panky bother you, then you will not like this film.  On the other hand, if the Segal character was NOT happily married, then it would be the case that the raison d'etre of the plot would be deflated.",4,A Touch of Sleaze.,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,4973,"['TOUCH', 'OF', 'CLASS', '1', 'hour', '46', 'minute', 'color', 'movie', '1973', 'starring', 'George', 'Segal', 'born', '1934', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'born', '1936', 'nutshell', 'two', 'professional', 'Londoners', 'late', '30s', 'interested', 'feeding', 'animal', 'passions', 'decide', 'engage', 'week', 'hanky-panky', 'panky', 'vacation', 'resort', 'Spain', 'However', 'series', 'improbable', 'amusing', 'incidents', 'up', 'variety', 'roadblocks', 'plans', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'lively', 'barbs', 'amusing', 'bickering.The', 'film', 'aerial', 'shot', 'Thames', 'River', 'London', 'bridges', 'center', 'castles', 'left', 'apartment', 'buildings', 'right', 'first', 'scene', 'urban', 'park', 'horseback', 'riders', 'baseball', 'game', 'One', 'baseball', 'players', 'wears', 'sweatshirt', 'reading', 'HILLEL', 'Jewish', 'organization', 'player', 'shirt', 'reading', 'TURETSKY', 'DELI', 'Turetsky', 'Deli', 'presence', 'internet', 'Mr.', 'Segal', 'outfield', 'catch', 'ball', 'boy', 'boy', 'Jackson', 'son', 'Give', 'ball', 'will', 'lady', 'Segal', 'Give', 'kid', 'will', 'mister', 'finish', 'trampling', 'Jackson', 'establishing', 'theme', 'good-natured', 'barbs', 'pepper', 'entire', 'screenplay', 'umpire', 'yells', 'FAIR', 'BALL', 'Then', 'Segal', 'outfield', 'yells', 'screams', 'disagreeing', 'umpire', 'Segal', 'up', 'boy', 'brushes', 'off', 'demonstrating', 'inherent', 'good', 'nature', 'Jackson', 'first', 'flirt', 'Segal', 'immediately', 'flirt.The', 'next', 'scene', 'rainstorm', 'perhaps', 'week', 'later', 'when', 'Segal', 'Jackson', 'serendipitously', 'waiting', 'taxi', 'Segal', 'first', 'make', 'move', 'Jackson', 'out', 'date', 'afternoon', 'tea', 'Segal', 'concerned', 'inconvenience', '4', ""o'clock"", 'tea', 'date', 'Jackson', 'Do', ""n't"", 'cross-examine', 'rain', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'example', 'gentle', 'sometimes', 'not-so-gentle', 'barbs', 'pair', 'exchanges', 'other', 'movie.The', 'next', 'barbs', 'are', 'exchanged', 'following', 'day', 'tea', 'date', 'when', 'Jackson', 'way', 'played', 'baseball', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'living', 'Then', 'describe', 'own', 'marriages', 'own', 'marriage', 'Segal', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', '11', 'years', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'same', 'city', 'line', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'where', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'never', 'make', 'love', 'woman', 'empty', 'stomach', 'line', 'was', 'spoken', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'censors', 'replaced', 'soundtrack', 'different', 'sentence', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'CLASS', 'pair', 'already', 'discussing', 'doing', 'migrate', 'dining', 'room', 'hotel', 'bedroom', 'suite', 'upstairs', 'Jackson', 'have', 'brought', 'hideaway', 'intention', 'presume', 'getting', 'bed', 'what', 'men', 'so', 'charmingly', 'call', 'quickie', 'Segal', 'Why', 'do', 'women', 'always', 'thnk', 'worst', 'Why', 'sex', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'first', 'thing', 'YES', 'Then', 'Jackson', 'hotel', 'room', 'referring', 'overworked', 'little', 'joy-station', 'where', 'sheets', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'changed', 'week', 'have', 'be', 'back', 'office', 'Christ', 'half', 'hour', 'Jackson', 'have', 'tryst', 'town', '14', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Segal', 'decided', 'tryst', 'will', 'occur', 'Malaga', 'Spain', 'next', 'scene', 'place', 'Jackson', 'office', 'company', 'knock-offs', 'clothing', 'had', 'been', 'designed', 'high-profile', 'fashion', 'designers', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'Jackson', 'work', 'routine', 'interactions', 'co-workers.At', '18', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Segal', 'travel', 'agent', 'point', 'end', 'movie', 'viewer', 'treated', 'amusing', 'romp', 'overblown', 'misunderstandings', 'amusing', 'turns-of-fate', 'cause', 'Segal', 'Jackson', 'be', 'annoyed', 'example', 'airport', 'London', 'Segal', 'professional', 'colleague', 'Walter', 'who', 'also', 'booking', 'flight', 'Malaga', 'result', 'Segal', 'must', 'conceal', 'fact', 'Jackson', 'be', 'challenging', 'inconvenience', 'Segal', 'must', 'conceal', 'fact', 'Jackson', 'airplane', 'flight', 'negotiations', 'rental', 'car', 'agency', 'vacation', 'activities', 'Malaga.CONCLUSION', 'many', 'activities', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'viewer', 'watching', 'A', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'CLASS', 'must', 'ignore', 'fact', 'particular', 'problem', 'not', 'exist', 'order', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Thus', 'order', 'accomplish', 'task', 'enjoying', 'film', 'viewer', 'will', 'need', 'ignore', 'fact', 'Segal', 'happily', 'married', 'other', 'words', 'allow', 'infidelity', 'hanky-panky', 'bother', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Segal', 'character', 'was', 'NOT', 'happily', 'married', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'deflated']",A Touch of Class VHS
