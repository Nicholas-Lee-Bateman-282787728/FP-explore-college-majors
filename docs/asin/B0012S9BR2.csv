1139462,A105S56ODHGJEK,B0012S9BR2,"Peace Daddy ""Eclectic ReflectionZ""","[3, 3]","I had heard of Dorothy Izatt originally from an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. It was an intriguing case, but I had forgotten about it until recently when I saw that this documentary had been made. Dorothy comes off as an amazing woman who truly believes in what she's filming, and that lends a ton of credibility to the believability aspect of it.One of the great aspects of ""Capturing The Light"" is her family's involvement in it. They seem to be an average middle-class family, skeptical of the paranormal and definitely skeptical of ""aliens"" and such, but nevertheless open to the possibility. The moment in the filming where the film crew actually captures lights in the sky outside the kitchen window (while filming an interview with Dorothy's daughter) makes for an interesting reveal to the entire family. The feeling of true shock and confusion is portrayed eerily well by the filmmakers as members of the family discussed what they had just seen.There is a moment in the film I didn't quite agree with. The family and others interviewed suggest that the ""orbs"" seen floating through the kitchen (while the lights were filmed outside in the background) could be some sort of alien presence. ""Orbs"" are a subject of constant debate in the paranormal community, and it is my firm belief that 99% of the time they are nothing  more than dust or bugs. I believe that to be the case here, although I do respect their beliefs and I acknowledge the fact that there is no way of proving this either way. Until we come up with a way of measuring or documenting an actual energy or presence within these ""orbs,"" I believe they cannot be looked at as solid evidence of paranormal activity. Nevertheless, it is laid out there in the film for you to draw your own conclusions.Towards the end of the film, we are shown footage of an absolutely incredible occurrence. One of Dorothy's photographs of light is shown giving off brilliant flashes of light -as- it is being filmed. We are told of this by the filmmaker, and shown about five seconds of footage of it actually happening, but then left completely hanging as no more time is given to it. This is truly disappointing, because it looked amazing and it seemed to be something they could've really sunk their teeth into and tried to find an explanation for, or at the very least given us more documentation of it happening.In the end, ""Capturing The Light"" is a must see film, and in my eyes it may be the best evidence presented in UFO history. Over 30 years and 30,000 feet of footage shot with different cameras doesn't lie. There is something there, and it's up to us to figure out exactly what it is. I can only hope that somebody is working on a follow-up with Dorothy and this evidence, as 46 minutes was not enough time to fully analyze and appreciate what she has given us.",4,Excellent documentation of amazing events,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,2831,"['had', 'heard', 'Dorothy', 'Izatt', 'originally', 'episode', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'intriguing', 'case', 'had', 'forgotten', 'recently', 'when', 'saw', 'documentary', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'Dorothy', 'off', 'amazing', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'what', 'filming', 'ton', 'credibility', 'believability', 'aspect', 'it.One', 'great', 'aspects', 'Capturing', 'Light', 'family', 'involvement', 'seem', 'be', 'average', 'middle-class', 'family', 'skeptical', 'paranormal', 'definitely', 'skeptical', 'aliens', 'such', 'nevertheless', 'open', 'possibility', 'moment', 'filming', 'where', 'film', 'crew', 'actually', 'lights', 'sky', 'kitchen', 'window', 'filming', 'interview', 'Dorothy', 'daughter', 'interesting', 'reveal', 'entire', 'family', 'feeling', 'true', 'shock', 'confusion', 'portrayed', 'eerily', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'members', 'family', 'discussed', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen.There', 'moment', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'family', 'others', 'interviewed', 'suggest', 'orbs', 'seen', 'floating', 'kitchen', 'lights', 'were', 'filmed', 'background', 'could', 'be', 'sort', 'alien', 'presence', 'Orbs', 'are', 'subject', 'constant', 'debate', 'paranormal', 'community', 'firm', 'belief', '99', '%', 'time', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'dust', 'bugs', 'believe', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'do', 'respect', 'beliefs', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'way', 'proving', 'way', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'measuring', 'documenting', 'actual', 'energy', 'presence', 'orbs', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'looked', 'solid', 'evidence', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'Nevertheless', 'laid', 'out', 'there', 'film', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.Towards', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'shown', 'footage', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'occurrence', 'One', 'Dorothy', 'photographs', 'light', 'shown', 'giving', 'off', 'brilliant', 'flashes', 'light', '-as-', 'being', 'filmed', 'are', 'told', 'filmmaker', 'shown', 'five', 'seconds', 'footage', 'actually', 'happening', 'then', 'left', 'completely', 'hanging', 'more', 'time', 'given', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'looked', 'amazing', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'could', ""'ve"", 'really', 'sunk', 'teeth', 'tried', 'find', 'explanation', 'very', 'least', 'given', 'more', 'documentation', 'end', 'Capturing', 'Light', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'evidence', 'presented', 'UFO', 'history', '30', 'years', '30,000', 'feet', 'footage', 'shot', 'different', 'cameras', ""n't"", 'lie', 'something', 'there', 'up', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'somebody', 'working', 'follow-up', 'Dorothy', 'evidence', '46', 'minutes', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'fully', 'analyze', 'appreciate', 'what', 'given']",Capturing the Light
