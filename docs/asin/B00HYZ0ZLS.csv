1693036,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[0, 0]","Chesterton wrote the first Father Brown story in 1911. It was the first thing he wrote that clicked with the British public. The amazing thing is that 100 years later, it's still clicking. This series aired on PBS Mystery! in the states forty years ago. Just now have the two series been collected by Acorn Media into one four disc DVD set. Unlike a great many shows from the '70s, this one is still eminently watchable. One reason is that it was set in the 'tens and 'twenties, and thus has a period look. Another reason is that Chesterton is his own animal. This series tantalizingly draws one in, and makes one want to read the stories. Penguin released its five individual Father Brown paperbacks in a box set in 1982, featuring Kenneth More from this series as Father Brown on the covers. These four one-sided discs are the same ones that appeared in the two disc individual sets for season one (purple) and season two (green).My favorite episodes in this series are those with Flambeau, because I think he and Father Brown make good sidekicks. But I confess to being very taken with Chesterton's short stories  that don't feature Father Brown. These include Four Faultless FelonsFour Faultless Felons, The Club of Queer Trades (which may not actually be mysteries in the strict sense)The Club of Queer Trades, The Poet and the LunaticsThe Poet and the Lunatics: Episodes in the Life of Gabriel Gale (Dover Books on Literature & Drama), and The Paradoxes of Mr. PondThe Paradoxes of Mr. Pond (Dover Books on Literature & Drama). Of his novels, my favorite is The Ball and the CrossThe Ball and the Cross. Second probably The Flying InnThe Flying Inn. Orthodoxy, which reads like a novel, is, in my view, one of the best non-fiction books ever writtenOrthodoxy.There aren't many other authors from a century ago one can easily read, or who move so seamlessly to television. As of this writing, I've not seen the new BBC Father Brown shows, and cannot vouch for them, but this shows that in these 13 episodes from forty years ago, which only covered about one fourth of the Father Brown stories, Kenneth More has whetted viewers appetites for more.",5,Inauspicious Beginnings,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,2151,"['Chesterton', 'wrote', 'first', 'Father', 'Brown', 'story', '1911', 'was', 'first', 'thing', 'wrote', 'clicked', 'British', 'public', 'amazing', 'thing', '100', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'clicking', 'series', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'states', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'Just', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'series', 'been', 'collected', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'one', 'four', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'many', 'shows', ""'70s"", 'one', 'still', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'One', 'reason', 'was', 'set', ""'tens"", ""'twenties"", 'thus', 'period', 'look', 'reason', 'Chesterton', 'own', 'animal', 'series', 'tantalizingly', 'one', 'one', 'want', 'read', 'stories', 'Penguin', 'released', 'five', 'individual', 'Father', 'Brown', 'paperbacks', 'box', 'set', '1982', 'featuring', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'series', 'Father', 'Brown', 'covers', 'four', 'one-sided', 'discs', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'appeared', 'two', 'disc', 'individual', 'sets', 'season', 'one', 'purple', 'season', 'two', 'green', '.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'Flambeau', 'think', 'Father', 'Brown', 'make', 'good', 'sidekicks', 'confess', 'being', 'very', 'taken', 'Chesterton', 'short', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Father', 'Brown', 'include', 'Four', 'Faultless', 'FelonsFour', 'Faultless', 'Felons', 'Club', 'Queer', 'Trades', 'may', 'not', 'actually', 'be', 'mysteries', 'strict', 'sense', 'Club', 'Queer', 'Trades', 'Poet', 'LunaticsThe', 'Poet', 'Lunatics', 'Episodes', 'Life', 'Gabriel', 'Gale', 'Dover', 'Books', 'Literature', 'Drama', 'Paradoxes', 'Mr.', 'PondThe', 'Paradoxes', 'Mr.', 'Pond', 'Dover', 'Books', 'Literature', 'Drama', 'novels', 'favorite', 'Ball', 'CrossThe', 'Ball', 'Cross', 'Second', 'probably', 'Flying', 'InnThe', 'Flying', 'Inn', 'Orthodoxy', 'novel', 'view', 'one', 'best', 'non-fiction', 'books', 'ever', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'other', 'authors', 'century', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'read', 'who', 'move', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'television', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'new', 'BBC', 'Father', 'Brown', 'shows', 'can', 'not', 'vouch', '13', 'episodes', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'covered', 'one', 'fourth', 'Father', 'Brown', 'stories', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'whetted', 'viewers', 'appetites', 'more']",Father Brown:The Complete Collection
1693037,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00HYZ0ZLS,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[24, 26]","One of the great series of 1974. It was a bit under-watched coming in the height of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Released years ago as 2 sets. The picture is state of the art 70s. Adaptations of GK Chesterton and a worthy 1920 period style. Costumes, props, cars, sets are perfect for post-world war England. Combining classic storytelling and nostalgic theatre style makes this a delight for retro-TV enthusiasts. Also offers interesting peeks at guest star roles by some of Britain's finest, some looking quite young, some now deceased. Kenneth More, brilliant as Father John Brown, becomes amateur crime-solver in all 13 episodes.Titled like Chesterton's short stories, no SDH or CC, but speech is clear. This is the complete 1974 collection, but 2013-14 has 20 new Chesterton adaptations so far. Can't wait for DVDs. Chesterton wrote 48 Fr Brown stories.Only a few guest stars are listed.1 HAMMER of GOD: Fr. Brown  arrives in the village for a mission finding adultery & murder. Graham Crawden (Waiting for God0. Alun Armstrong (New Tricks).2 ORACLE of the DOG: Studies in a Col's old library offers sleuthing opportunity. Mel Martin (Love for Lydia).3 CURSE of the GOLDEN CROSS: The finder of an ancient relic cross is threatened with death. Can this murder be stopped? Geoffrey Chater.4 EYE of APOLLO: PvtI Flambeau (Dennis Burgess) & Fr Brown are asked to investigate a religious cultist before a lady is killed. Flambeau's first of 5 episodes. Ronald Pickup (Larkrise to Candleford). Oliver Ford-Davies (Star Wars, Land Girls).5 TOOLS of DEATH: Scot atheist tea-total tossed from a high window as Fr Brown arrives for a visit.6 MIRROR of the MAGISTRATE: 1928 Flambeau on hand when the judge is shot. The intruder Irish newsman suspect is known by Fr Brown who finds a shattered mirror clue.7 DAGGER WITH WINGS: 1928 adopted son (David Buck) gets rich Essex landowner into black magic as confessed to Fr Brown who must save him or his $$. TP McKenna.8 ACTOR and the ALIBI: Fr Brown works backstage theatre with Flambeau & murder. Rachel Gurney (Upstairs, Downstairs).9 QUICK ONE: Flambeau travels with Fr Brown who has a premonition of a village murder, rightly so. Bernard Lee (Bond films). Paul Williamson (Emma).10 MAN with TWO BEARDS: Is a beekeeper a thief, aka Michael Moonshine (Larry Noble)? Murder x2. Megs Jenkins (Daniel Deranda). Freda Davie (Middlemarch).11 HEAD of CEASAR:  Flambeau & Fr Brown dining in a pub are caught up in a coin mystery of an artist & a masked man.12 ARROW of HEAVEN: An auctioned religious relic chalice with owner-murders history. Can Fr Brown save the new owner? David Healy (Dallas).13 SECRET GARDEN: A mystery about a decapitated corpse in the garden, followed by a second severed head.

1693039,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00HYZ0ZLS,Jon Wynne,"[14, 14]","Watching FATHER BROWN is like watching a time capsule. Although aired in the 1970s, (not THAT long ago) there is an old-fashioned quality about this series that will either charm the viewer or leave you shaking your head at the at times overt theatricality of some of the performances.To fairly judge this series, one must adopt the perspective that the G.K. Chesterton short stories from which these 13 episodes are adapted are from a time when melodrama, a sort of heightened dramatic style, was prevalent on stage and screen. This understanding of the style or tone of the source material is integral to appreciating the artistry that went into making this series. Therefore it would be a mistake to dismiss FATHER BROWN as dated or overdone.Additionally, with a masterful Kenneth More as the delightfully absentminded Father Brown, the programs are not without subtlety, which contrasts brilliantly with the colourful theatricality of some of the other performances. Even the staging of many scenes looks as if the show was designed for a live audience, with actors sometimes almost declaiming their lines and projecting their characterizations ""to the back row"". (Again, this is all part of the style of the show and one either accepts it or is put off by it). More's performance provides the balance between melodrama and mannered realism. The effect is rather like J.B. Priestly's (a contemporary of Chesterton's) description of how an audience will watch the villain tie the heroine to the railroad track in horror, but will not do anything to try to stop it: it's real enough to provoke a reaction but heightened enough that the audience knows they are not perceiving actuality.All in all, I loved it and was not put off by the occasional hammy performance which is ""more"" than compensated by More's considered portrayal. Seeing a slightly befuddled More muttering and bumbling as he puts two and two together is an absolute delight. One must remember that Kenneth More was regarded as one of the finest light comedians to ever grace the silver screen. He was also much more, capable of being heroic (as in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, for example). More is an absolute master of film acting and even when he says very little (until his inevitable explanation of the crime near the end of each episode) he is the centre of our focus. Without his anchoring influence, FATHER BROWN would become tiresome, but such is his star power, even after his career had been in decline for a decade, that Kenneth More literally saves the day.When he is matched by guest stars the like of Peter Copley (episode The Curse of the Golden Cross) or Ronald Pickup (episode The Eye of Apollo) More is especially fine and the shows have a sparkle about them that justifies their re-release in a collector's edition box set by Acorn Media. In the episode The Three Tools of Death, More is reunited with the blustery Scottish actor James Hayter, who acted opposite More in the excellent re-make of THE 39 STEPS in 1959--Hayter played Mr. Memory.A word about the actor Peter Copley, the clergyman in the episode The Curse of the Golden Cross. Copley had a mellifluous voice and keen intelligence, so much so that he was able to successfully employ these attributes as a part-time lawyer during the 1960s. This reviewer had a wonderful experience working with him at the Bristol Old Vic in 1981. Copley was one of the stars of a brilliant stage production of Brecht's THE RESISTIBLE RISE OF ARTURO UI. As a young drama student at the Old Vic, I was one of four lucky aspirants who was selected to appear as various extras in the production. On the first day of rehearsal, Peter Copley ushered the four of us to the nearest pub at the end of the day and bought us all a drink--just to say ""welcome"" and to make us feel part of the team. His generosity as a person was palpable in his performances as an actor, always giving, sharing and never attempting to steal focus. He was an exceptional performer who, while never a major star, was highly respected and whose work always raised the standard of any production of which he was a part.It is precisely the kind of acting that Peter Copley (and Ronald Pickup, James Hayter, etc) bring to this series that helps elevate FATHER BROWN to classic status. Bernard Lee, ""M"" in the Sean Connery and first four Roger Moore Bond films, also appears in an episode (The Quick One). This is worthy of note since More was being considered as Lee's ""M"" replacement at around this time. (Lee of course is the grandfather of Jonny Lee Miller, currently starring in the Sherlock Holmes series ELEMENTARY).Part of the fun of watching older programs such as FATHER BROWN is identifying the supporting actors, as mentioned above. When a series has so many guest-stars who went on to make their mark in so many other films and television programs it is proof in the pudding, so to speak, that their other, lesser-known work (like FATHER BROWN) is worth watching and preserving. Bravo to the powers that be who determined that while FATHER BROWN might seem dated to some, it is a wonderful series that deserves rediscovery.Perhaps a future edition will include subtitles, a must for many people to fully enjoy the witty dialogue and plethora of British accents on display. However this series still rates five stars in my opinion. Kenneth More still had a lot of tricks up his cassock sleeve when he undertook this beloved role. Long may he be remembered.Looking for voting buttons?

When he's killed, the family dog leads Father Brown to the right suspects.The Curse of the Golden Cross - This is one of my favorites because it ties in some med-evil history. An archeologist is murdered and Father Brown uses his knowledge of the past to find the killer.The Eye of Apollo - A woman is a member of a cult, but Father Brown proves her death has nothing to do with anything spiritual.The Three Tools of Death - A philanthropist of the community dies under mysterious circumstances. His future son-in-law confesses to the crime, but Father Brown feels there is more to the story.The Mirror of the Magistrate - The local magistrate discovers German spies in London and dies shortly afterward.  An Irishman with German ties is thought to be the culprit but Father Brown believes he's innocent.The Dagger with Wings - When a man and his sons are all killed, Father Brown uncovers a satanist in their mist.The Actor and the Alibi - The search for a missing runway model leads Father Brown to a theater with murder on the agenda.The Quick One - When an outspoken bigot dies in an Eastern style bar, Father Brown must figure out who served the deadly cocktail.The Man With Two Beards - A local book keepr and friend of Father Brown is accused of robbery and murder. The good father works to prove his friend's innocence.The Head of Caesar - The daughter of a famous coin collector is being followed by a man in disguise.  She's certain he means her harm, and Father Brown comes to her aid.The Arrow of Heaven - A man buys a chalice and laughs about its supposed curse, until an arrow pierces his heart. Now Father Brown must figure out if the curse is real or if there's a murderer on the loose.The Secret Garden - A decapitated body turns up at the police party and Father Brown is the only one who can solve the crime.This is a great series with lots of awesome guest stars.

Chesterton.Complimentary copy received.",5,Father Brown,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,2867,"['love', 'old', 'British', 'mystery', 'series', 'something', 'one', 'found', 'especially', 'endearing', 'Maybe', 'just', 'was', 'raised', 'Catholic', 'church', 'knew', 'few', 'priests', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'great', 'sleuths', 'just', 'Father', 'Brown', 'Set', '1920', 'series', 'amazingly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'times', 'stunning', 'costumes', 'backdrops', 'box', 'set', 'thirteen', 'fabulous', 'episodes', 'amateur', 'detective', 'cloth.The', 'Hammer', 'God', 'rich', 'colonel', 'feels', 'right', 'take', 'wives', 'man', 'leaving', 'lot', 'suspects', 'when', 'murdered.The', 'Oracle', 'Dog', 'colonel', 'change', 'will', 'mass', 'panic', 'possible', 'beneficiaries', 'When', 'killed', 'family', 'dog', 'Father', 'Brown', 'right', 'suspects.The', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Cross', 'one', 'favorites', 'med-evil', 'history', 'archeologist', 'murdered', 'Father', 'Brown', 'knowledge', 'past', 'find', 'killer.The', 'Eye', 'Apollo', 'woman', 'member', 'cult', 'Father', 'Brown', 'death', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'spiritual.The', 'Three', 'Tools', 'Death', 'philanthropist', 'community', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'confesses', 'crime', 'Father', 'Brown', 'feels', 'more', 'story.The', 'Mirror', 'Magistrate', 'local', 'magistrate', 'discovers', 'German', 'spies', 'London', 'dies', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'Irishman', 'German', 'ties', 'thought', 'be', 'culprit', 'Father', 'Brown', 'innocent.The', 'Dagger', 'Wings', 'When', 'man', 'sons', 'are', 'killed', 'Father', 'Brown', 'satanist', 'mist.The', 'Actor', 'Alibi', 'search', 'missing', 'runway', 'model', 'Father', 'Brown', 'theater', 'murder', 'agenda.The', 'Quick', 'One', 'When', 'outspoken', 'bigot', 'dies', 'Eastern', 'style', 'bar', 'Father', 'Brown', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'served', 'deadly', 'cocktail.The', 'Man', 'Two', 'Beards', 'local', 'book', 'keepr', 'friend', 'Father', 'Brown', 'accused', 'robbery', 'murder', 'good', 'father', 'works', 'prove', 'friend', 'innocence.The', 'Head', 'Caesar', 'daughter', 'famous', 'coin', 'collector', 'being', 'followed', 'man', 'disguise', 'certain', 'harm', 'Father', 'Brown', 'aid.The', 'Arrow', 'Heaven', 'man', 'chalice', 'supposed', 'curse', 'arrow', 'heart', 'Now', 'Father', 'Brown', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'curse', 'real', 'murderer', 'loose.The', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'decapitated', 'body', 'up', 'police', 'party', 'Father', 'Brown', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'solve', 'crime.This', 'great', 'series', 'lots', 'awesome', 'guest', 'stars', 'mystery', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'villain', 'never', 'who', 'be', 'addition', 'complete', 'collection', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'interesting', 'biography', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton.Complimentary', 'copy', 'received']",Father Brown:The Complete Collection

1693043,A3ICVJQMZAGQV5,B00HYZ0ZLS,wisdomstar,"[1, 1]","I revisited this series after watching the new 2013 series which stars Mark Williams (of Harry Potter fame) and which I really enjoyed. I had seen this Kenneth More series many years ago and had hoped the film quality would be better in this set - it isn't. However, I appreciated More's measured performance much more this time around and the rational objective way in which he solves each mystery. He reminds me of Jesuit priests I have known and I think he is very true to life as it was in the time period in which Chesterton wrote. (The Mark Williams series is set in a later period). Dennis Burgess is a real presence as the reformed jewel thief, Flambeau, and most of the episodes I liked here had him in them. Some of the acting (not More's or Burgess) is over the top and a bit grating - my theory is that some of these actors were stage people who were used to projecting a larger presence and didn't adapt well to television. Overall, this is an older mystery series set in a period almost a hundred years ago so worth a watch. Stream it first if you aren't sure.",5,true to the period in which Chesterton wrote,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,1074,"['revisited', 'series', 'watching', 'new', '2013', 'series', 'Mark', 'Williams', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'seen', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'hoped', 'film', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'set', ""n't"", 'However', 'appreciated', 'More', 'measured', 'performance', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'around', 'rational', 'objective', 'way', 'mystery', 'Jesuit', 'priests', 'have', 'known', 'think', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'was', 'time', 'period', 'Chesterton', 'wrote', 'Mark', 'Williams', 'series', 'set', 'later', 'period', 'Dennis', 'Burgess', 'real', 'presence', 'reformed', 'jewel', 'thief', 'Flambeau', 'most', 'episodes', 'liked', 'here', 'had', 'acting', 'not', 'More', 'Burgess', 'top', 'bit', 'grating', 'theory', 'actors', 'were', 'stage', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'used', 'projecting', 'larger', 'presence', 'did', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'well', 'television', 'Overall', 'older', 'mystery', 'series', 'set', 'period', 'almost', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'worth', 'watch', 'Stream', 'first', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure']",Father Brown:The Complete Collection
