293369,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6302041147,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[8, 8]","I first saw this a requirement for a history class, when we were studying the effects of Japanese internment in the United States on those who were forced to stay in the barracks, due to Executive Order 9066, authorized by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1942.  This order allowed local military commanders to designate ""military areas"" as ""exclusion zones"", from which ""any or all persons may be excluded."" This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and most of Oregon and Washington, except for those in internment camps.  The seizure and relocation of all people of Japanese ancestry surged following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when anyone of that background was viewed potentially as a spy and ""anti-American.""  COME SEE THE PARADISE takes a look at that part of United States history.Irish-American Jack McGurn (Dennis Quaid) gets a job at a movie theater and falls in love with his boss's daughter, Lily Kawamura (Tomlyn Tomita).  This enrages her father who fires Jack and forbids him to see her.  Despite this, the couple continues to see each other and they leave for Seattle.  It is at this time that all people of Japanese ancestry are being forceably placed in the internment camps.This film is well-acted and I think it's wonderful to see the story and experience of the internment camps brought to life as an engaging film.  This part of our nation's history needs to be acknowledged and I think that this film really pays tribute to all of the people whose lives were turned upside down because of the government enforced order between 1942 and 1946.",4,powerful.....,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1673,"['first', 'saw', 'requirement', 'history', 'class', 'when', 'were', 'studying', 'effects', 'Japanese', 'internment', 'United', 'States', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'stay', 'barracks', 'due', 'Executive', 'Order', '9066', 'authorized', 'President', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt', '1942', 'order', 'allowed', 'local', 'military', 'commanders', 'designate', 'military', 'areas', 'exclusion', 'zones', 'persons', 'may', 'be', 'excluded', 'power', 'was', 'used', 'declare', 'people', 'Japanese', 'ancestry', 'were', 'excluded', 'entire', 'Pacific', 'coast', 'including', 'California', 'most', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'internment', 'camps', 'seizure', 'relocation', 'people', 'Japanese', 'ancestry', 'surged', 'following', 'bombing', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'when', 'anyone', 'background', 'was', 'viewed', 'potentially', 'spy', 'anti-American', 'COME', 'SEE', 'THE', 'PARADISE', 'look', 'part', 'United', 'States', 'history.Irish-American', 'Jack', 'McGurn', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'job', 'movie', 'theater', 'love', 'boss', 'daughter', 'Lily', 'Kawamura', 'Tomlyn', 'Tomita', 'father', 'who', 'Jack', 'forbids', 'see', 'couple', 'see', 'other', 'leave', 'Seattle', 'time', 'people', 'Japanese', 'ancestry', 'are', 'being', 'forceably', 'placed', 'internment', 'camps.This', 'film', 'well-acted', 'think', 'wonderful', 'see', 'story', 'experience', 'internment', 'camps', 'brought', 'life', 'engaging', 'film', 'part', 'nation', 'history', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'think', 'film', 'really', 'tribute', 'people', 'lives', 'were', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'government', 'enforced', 'order', '1942', '1946']",Come See the Paradise VHS
293370,A60PQSFWSQK8K,6302041147,Erik Rupp,"[27, 27]","When Come See the Paradise first came out late in 1990 in played in a very limited release.  In it's first weekend it only played in 5 theaters, widening to a whopping 25 theaters by it's third week which ultimately led to a grand total of $947,306.00 at the box office in it's theatrical run.  This one flew completely under the radar, and that's a shame.Why?  Because Come See the Paradise is a fine, well crafted movie with a subject matter that hasn't gotten much attention, even though it should have.Dennis Quaid plays an Irish-American in trouble with the law who moves to Los Angeles and ultimately falls in love with a Japanese-American girl.  This is just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese.  The girl's father wants her to have nothing to do with Quaid, but Quaid's Jack McGurn (McGann while ""hiding"" from the law) persists and ultimately wins over the girl, if not her family.The script is well written, touching on prejudice and racism in a restrained, sober way.  The movie doesn't hit you over the head with messages on the evils of prejudice and racism, instead it shows the results of such beliefs and behaviors and lets the viewer come to his or her own conclusions.  The story between Jack and Lily (played by the wonderful, and quite beautiful Tamlyn Tomita) is quite touching and played in a very sensitive manner.Of course, the movie shifts to the post Pearl Harbor events, and Jack and Lily are separated as she and her family are forced by the U.S. Government into a Japanese Internment Camp, and Jack ultimately ends up in the Army.The ending of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, and not quite the resolution that the movie deserves (as the movie runs out of steam dramatically).  But, then again, in real life would the ending of such a story have been any more satisfying?  Probably not.Alan Parker's direction is fantastic, and his script is moving and quite touching.  The acting in Come See the Paradise is also quite good, as Dennis Quaid is in top form, and Tamlyn Tomita is excellent as well.  The supporting cast - too many to name individually - is also quite good from top to bottom.For a different perspective on the World War II era, or just for a really solid drama, you can't do much better than Come See the Paradise.",4,"Underrated, and Lesser Known, but Very Good!",1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,2276,"['When', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'late', '1990', 'played', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'first', 'weekend', 'only', 'played', '5', 'theaters', 'widening', 'whopping', '25', 'theaters', 'third', 'week', 'ultimately', 'led', 'grand', 'total', '947,306.00', 'box', 'office', 'theatrical', 'run', 'one', 'flew', 'completely', 'radar', 'shame.Why', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'fine', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'much', 'attention', 'even', 'should', 'have.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Irish-American', 'trouble', 'law', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'ultimately', 'love', 'Japanese-American', 'girl', 'just', 'prior', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'father', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Quaid', 'Quaid', 'Jack', 'McGurn', 'McGann', 'hiding', 'law', 'ultimately', 'girl', 'not', 'family.The', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'touching', 'prejudice', 'racism', 'restrained', 'sober', 'way', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'messages', 'evils', 'prejudice', 'racism', 'instead', 'results', 'such', 'beliefs', 'behaviors', 'viewer', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'story', 'Jack', 'Lily', 'played', 'wonderful', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'quite', 'touching', 'played', 'very', 'sensitive', 'manner.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'shifts', 'post', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'events', 'Jack', 'Lily', 'are', 'separated', 'family', 'are', 'forced', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'Japanese', 'Internment', 'Camp', 'Jack', 'ultimately', 'up', 'Army.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'bit', 'anti-climactic', 'not', 'quite', 'resolution', 'movie', 'movie', 'steam', 'dramatically', 'then', 'again', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'ending', 'such', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Probably', 'not.Alan', 'Parker', 'direction', 'fantastic', 'script', 'moving', 'quite', 'touching', 'acting', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'top', 'form', 'Tamlyn', 'Tomita', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'too', 'many', 'name', 'individually', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'top', 'bottom.For', 'different', 'perspective', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'just', 'really', 'solid', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise']",Come See the Paradise VHS

The two fall in love regardless of their race backgrounds.The girls fathers does not like the White Man, but eventually the family accepts him as partof the family, and this LOVE IS TESTED during the war.Dennis Quaid stars as Jack McGurn a liberal Irish activist who is trying to believe form a union, now forming a Union back then was like being a Communist in this warpview of America. It was pure nonsense and people like disgraced military men like MacArthur and other abusive military leaders wanted to quite down people who spoke out against governemnt corruption. This of course has been the case across history , even movie directors like the late great Elia Kaza have been targeted. Back to the movie:Tamyln Tomita as the love interest, Lily Yuriko , is absolutely great portraying all the anguish of a women in love, but then feels pain and sorrow when she sees her own people being put in Concentration Camps by the Americans and are given no rights, no real jobs (except menial low paying ones) and no hope.(Spoilers)During one dramatic and painful sequence that has to be seen the father is arrrested for no reason and taken into custody, he is then released and is then labeled as traitor leadinginto a great depression which eventually hurts his spirits and he dies. Quaid deserves a great recommendation for his performance as one of a few Americans who sees whats going and realizes that this is wrong. At one point, like many men heis forcibly drag into the war, and then goes AWOL to see his love and her Japanese family to provide support its very touching still the US carries it's vendetta with the Japaneseleading to Atom bomb being dropped on Hiroshima and the bombingof Pearl Harbor.If you don't cry watching this movie there is something wrong with you as &quot;Come See The Paradise&quot; by Alan Parker has great dramatic performance , a great score by Randy Edelman and a true life story that SHOULD NOT be forgotten.The movie is also told primarily through the narration of Lilythe main character does giving us a very intimate and realportrayal of the evennts unfolding onscreen.Truly an amazing movie, in fact see it with &quot;Fahrenheit 911&quot; so you can see some historic, dramatic events that we as Americans should not forget and learn from.",5,&quot;Come See the Paradise&quot; come see this Amazing film!!!,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,2773,"['quot', 'Come', 'see', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'amazing', 'film', 'essence', 'film', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'quot', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'quot', 'do', 'remind', 'ugly', 'American', 'history', 'commited', 'severalabusive', 'bureaucractic', 'leaders', 'imposing', 'form', 'corrupted', 'civil', 'governments', 'laws.The', 'film', 'place', 'WWII', 'quot', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'quot', 'great', 'story', 'anti-Japanse', 'movement', 'time', 'American', 'who', 'lovewith', 'Japanese', 'women', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'regardless', 'race', 'girls', 'fathers', 'not', 'White', 'Man', 'eventually', 'family', 'partof', 'family', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'TESTED', 'war.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Jack', 'McGurn', 'liberal', 'Irish', 'activist', 'who', 'trying', 'believe', 'form', 'union', 'now', 'forming', 'Union', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'being', 'Communist', 'warpview', 'America', 'was', 'pure', 'nonsense', 'people', 'disgraced', 'military', 'men', 'MacArthur', 'other', 'abusive', 'military', 'leaders', 'wanted', 'quite', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'spoke', 'out', 'governemnt', 'corruption', 'course', 'been', 'case', 'history', 'even', 'movie', 'directors', 'late', 'great', 'Elia', 'Kaza', 'have', 'been', 'targeted', 'Back', 'movie', 'Tamyln', 'Tomita', 'love', 'interest', 'Lily', 'Yuriko', 'absolutely', 'great', 'portraying', 'anguish', 'women', 'love', 'then', 'feels', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'when', 'own', 'people', 'being', 'put', 'Concentration', 'Camps', 'Americans', 'are', 'given', 'rights', 'real', 'jobs', 'menial', 'low', 'paying', 'ones', 'hope', 'Spoilers', 'one', 'dramatic', 'painful', 'sequence', 'be', 'seen', 'father', 'arrrested', 'reason', 'taken', 'custody', 'then', 'released', 'then', 'labeled', 'traitor', 'great', 'depression', 'eventually', 'spirits', 'Quaid', 'great', 'recommendation', 'performance', 'one', 'few', 'Americans', 'who', 'whats', 'going', 'wrong', 'one', 'point', 'many', 'men', 'heis', 'forcibly', 'drag', 'war', 'then', 'AWOL', 'see', 'love', 'Japanese', 'family', 'provide', 'support', 'very', 'touching', 'still', 'US', 'vendetta', 'Japaneseleading', 'Atom', 'bomb', 'being', 'dropped', 'Hiroshima', 'bombingof', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'watching', 'movie', 'something', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'great', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'great', 'score', 'Randy', 'Edelman', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'SHOULD', 'NOT', 'be', 'forgotten.The', 'movie', 'also', 'told', 'primarily', 'narration', 'Lilythe', 'main', 'character', 'giving', 'very', 'intimate', 'realportrayal', 'evennts', 'unfolding', 'onscreen.Truly', 'amazing', 'movie', 'fact', 'see', 'quot', 'Fahrenheit', '911', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'historic', 'dramatic', 'events', 'Americans', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'learn']",Come See the Paradise VHS

I was required to watch this movie for school for I am currently taking a course about the US Government. The movie deals with civil liberties violations that the japanese-Americans went through after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The Japanese-Americans were subsequently rounded up and placed into internment camps throughout the American west.My instructor made a big deal about this movie so, once I saw it, I was quite disappointed for I was expecting American troops, police, etc crashing into homes in the middle of the night and herding American citizens off to the train station and such. Nope - none of that. The movie is based on a love relationship between a white American male and a Japanese-American woman. They have a child together. The husband does something wrong, is given parole, is then forced to join the military.Meanwhile, his wife and child are sent to the Manzannar Japanese-American Internment Camp in California. Throughout the movie, various questions about civil liberties violations do arise, but those questions are not dwelled upon nor answered very well. IF I had not needed to watch/review this movie for a college class, then I may have rated it higher, but I was focusing most of my attention on the civil liberties violations aspects and was dissapointed.Ordered this movie via Amazon for it was really the only place that I could find this movie, and have it sent to me in a timely manner.

The love story which is at the heart of this movie is good. In the background WWII and how it changed the lives of Japanese Americans. How did this happen in a land which prides itself on being a symbol of democracy and freedom? The acting, photography, and story are all excellent. Truly a moving experience!The included documentary, ""Rabbit in the Moon,"" is a very personal memoir of living in the camps. It also explains why some first generation Japanese refused to give up their Japanese citizenship. They were NOT allowed American citizenship! They would have become stateless persons! Damned if you do! Damned if you don't! In addition, it explains the antagonism between the JACL(Japanese American Citizens League) and the older Issei leadership. For example, parental discipline and family ties almost completely broke down in the camps. The U.S. government, indeed, fostered this by promoting the power of the JACL(composed of young, born-in-the-U.S.A second generation Japanese-American citizens)over the first generation who were not allowed to become citizens. It was kids vs. their parents! As one of the interviewees states, children were allowed to run free and, if they wanted, they didn't even have to stay with their parents. Of course undisciplined children quickly form gangs with their peers. These are examples from ""Rabbit in the Moon.""

293383,A2P7W7VDRM5BOD,6302041147,"Yanni Sis ""Zoom, zoom""","[7, 11]","I was both surprised and very pleased today when I received ""Come See The Paradise"" to find that it was a special edition with commentary by Sir Alan Parker, the director, a feature length documentary and other features including a short essay on the making of the film by Sir Alan Parker.  However, none of the special features were ever listed on any web sites nor were they advertised by 20th Century Fox in any press release.  Worse still is that this important film of an important subject matter has been released without any promotion or proper marketing usually given to dvds of films that are far inferior.I can only assume that, in these times, any film depicting America as not the land of dreams and liberty, but more a country that was racist and not to disimilar to the countries it was fighting is not welcome.  We may justify how we treated the Japanese by their attack on Pearl Harbour, or cite the war mongering on the Chinese, especially at Nanking, but two wrongs do not make a right.  Why were Italians and Germans in the United States not treated in the same manner as the Japanese?  In fact, there were many Germans who were actively spying In America for the Nazis and yet the community as a whole was left relatively untouched and intact.  In Europe, Germans, Italians and other pro-nazi Europeans were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans and yet it was only the Japanese in the United States who were treated so disgustingly.  In addition, not only were they exploited by the U.S. government, but also by many of it's citizens, especially when the Japanese were forced to sell belongings.  Former neighbours who once said 'good morning' thought nothing of taking advantage of a community's misfortune and amassing property left behind or sold off at bargain basement prices.  When the Japanese returned they returned to nothing and were forced to start again.Furthermore, how then do we justify our treatment of African Americans, especially when we were supposed to fighting for freedom from tyranny and yet were montorous to a people who had just as much right to America as 'White' counterparts ?  Much of the entire United States and all of the South was built on the backs of African-Americans and yet it was only forty years ago or so that they were first allowed to vote without getting lynched.  An active system of apartheid lasted in the United States well into the seventies and even now race is still the major issue in America.  One only has to look at last year's disaster in Louisiana and it's aftermath to realise that racism is alive and well in 21st century America.  Even now there are many in the White race that think that they have a god given right to subjugate, disenfranchise and dominate other ethnic commmunities.  In fact, the only true 'Americans' are the Native American Indians.  The rest and their children were all immigrants or descendants of immigrants.Much of America during the war was simply racist and,  while there were many within who fought the good war against such despicable beliefs, most were no better than their German counterparts.  This may be difficult for many to accept but if you were to examine American history in detail, what I state is absolutely correct.  What is sad is that we never seem to learn from history.",5,A good film marketed badly...and the monstrosity of White America.,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,3322,"['was', 'surprised', 'very', 'pleased', 'today', 'when', 'received', 'Come', 'See', 'Paradise', 'find', 'was', 'special', 'edition', 'commentary', 'Sir', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'director', 'feature', 'length', 'documentary', 'other', 'features', 'including', 'short', 'essay', 'making', 'film', 'Sir', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'However', 'none', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'ever', 'listed', 'web', 'sites', 'were', 'advertised', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'press', 'release', 'Worse', 'still', 'important', 'film', 'important', 'subject', 'matter', 'been', 'released', 'promotion', 'proper', 'marketing', 'usually', 'given', 'dvds', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'inferior.I', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'times', 'film', 'depicting', 'America', 'not', 'land', 'dreams', 'liberty', 'more', 'country', 'was', 'racist', 'not', 'disimilar', 'countries', 'was', 'fighting', 'not', 'welcome', 'may', 'justify', 'how', 'treated', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'cite', 'war', 'mongering', 'Chinese', 'especially', 'Nanking', 'two', 'wrongs', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'right', 'Why', 'were', 'Italians', 'Germans', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'treated', 'same', 'manner', 'Japanese', 'fact', 'were', 'many', 'Germans', 'who', 'were', 'actively', 'spying', 'America', 'Nazis', 'yet', 'community', 'whole', 'was', 'left', 'relatively', 'untouched', 'intact', 'Europe', 'Germans', 'Italians', 'other', 'pro-nazi', 'Europeans', 'were', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Americans', 'yet', 'was', 'only', 'Japanese', 'United', 'States', 'who', 'were', 'treated', 'so', 'disgustingly', 'addition', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'exploited', 'U.S.', 'government', 'also', 'many', 'citizens', 'especially', 'when', 'Japanese', 'were', 'forced', 'sell', 'belongings', 'Former', 'neighbours', 'who', 'once', 'said', ""'good"", 'morning', 'thought', 'nothing', 'taking', 'advantage', 'community', 'misfortune', 'amassing', 'property', 'left', 'behind', 'sold', 'off', 'bargain', 'basement', 'prices', 'When', 'Japanese', 'returned', 'returned', 'nothing', 'were', 'forced', 'start', 'again.Furthermore', 'how', 'then', 'do', 'justify', 'treatment', 'African', 'Americans', 'especially', 'when', 'were', 'supposed', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'tyranny', 'yet', 'were', 'montorous', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'right', 'America', ""'White"", 'counterparts', 'Much', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'South', 'was', 'built', 'backs', 'African-Americans', 'yet', 'was', 'only', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'were', 'first', 'allowed', 'vote', 'getting', 'lynched', 'active', 'system', 'apartheid', 'lasted', 'United', 'States', 'well', 'seventies', 'even', 'now', 'race', 'still', 'major', 'issue', 'America', 'One', 'only', 'look', 'last', 'year', 'disaster', 'Louisiana', 'aftermath', 'realise', 'racism', 'alive', 'well', '21st', 'century', 'America', 'Even', 'now', 'are', 'many', 'White', 'race', 'think', 'have', 'god', 'given', 'right', 'subjugate', 'disenfranchise', 'dominate', 'other', 'ethnic', 'commmunities', 'fact', 'only', 'true', ""'Americans"", 'are', 'Native', 'American', 'Indians', 'rest', 'children', 'were', 'immigrants', 'descendants', 'immigrants.Much', 'America', 'war', 'was', 'simply', 'racist', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'fought', 'good', 'war', 'such', 'despicable', 'beliefs', 'most', 'were', 'better', 'German', 'counterparts', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'many', 'accept', 'were', 'examine', 'American', 'history', 'detail', 'what', 'state', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'What', 'sad', 'never', 'seem', 'learn', 'history']",Come See the Paradise VHS
