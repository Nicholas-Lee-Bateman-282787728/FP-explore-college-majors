It's a great series, but it's different because each season is self contained. Which means from season to season the actors are the same but they play different characters in a different story line. So you don't have to start with season 1, it doesn't matter which order you decide to watch them in. Try watching through Amazon Fire TV, good quality and easy menus. Fire TV is great and you can't beat the price.

1492346,A33LLUCE9FZQCF,B005LAJ1O0,ACRIMONIOUS,"[0, 0]","The real horror story  is the dysfunction of the American family, and society as a whole, adultery, neglect, deceit, emotional absence, materialism, stature obsession, teenage suicide, and mass murder. That's the real story. The ghosts and ghouls are incidental. Lets face it, this series is nothing more than a collection of recycled horror clich&eacute;s. Yet, it is so well acted and the characters are so well developed, that it doesn't matter.  It's enjoyable and somewhat engrossing. It's satirical, without being blatantly so. Some real serious issues are tackled here, in the midst of a bunch of nonsensical ""horror"".  It moves like a video game, I fear that this series may not have staying power, if it slows down in future seasons. In other words: they can't keep this up. And eventually they will, run out of, as I stated, recycled horror clich&eacute;s. However; for the time being,.....awe-some. Season two is even better, and I didn't expect it to be. Set in the fifties, in a creepy asylum (can't go wrong with that premise) with the cast reappearing, though, the characters not reoccurring, minus Connie Britton and a couple others. Again, the real horror, is the zeitgeist of the nineteen fifties, racism, sexism, rampant hypocrisy, primitive medicine, ignorance, homophobia etc. basically, the stigmatization of any slight deviation from societal norms. Now that's horror.  As for season three, we'll have to wait and see. I suspect the worst thing that can happen to a series, has happened, it peaked early. I don't think they can top season two, though, I hope I'm wrong.",5,THE REAL HORROR IS FOUND IN THE WORLD OF THE LIVING,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1592,"['real', 'horror', 'story', 'dysfunction', 'American', 'family', 'society', 'whole', 'adultery', 'neglect', 'deceit', 'emotional', 'absence', 'materialism', 'stature', 'obsession', 'teenage', 'suicide', 'mass', 'murder', 'real', 'story', 'ghosts', 'ghouls', 'are', 'incidental', 'face', 'series', 'nothing', 'more', 'collection', 'recycled', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Yet', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'developed', ""n't"", 'matter', 'enjoyable', 'somewhat', 'engrossing', 'satirical', 'being', 'blatantly', 'so', 'real', 'serious', 'issues', 'are', 'tackled', 'here', 'midst', 'bunch', 'nonsensical', 'horror', 'video', 'game', 'fear', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'staying', 'power', 'down', 'future', 'seasons', 'other', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'eventually', 'will', 'run', 'stated', 'recycled', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'However', 'time', 'being', '..awe-some', 'Season', 'two', 'even', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'Set', 'fifties', 'creepy', 'asylum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'premise', 'cast', 'reappearing', 'though', 'characters', 'not', 'reoccurring', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'couple', 'others', 'Again', 'real', 'horror', 'zeitgeist', 'nineteen', 'fifties', 'racism', 'sexism', 'rampant', 'hypocrisy', 'primitive', 'medicine', 'ignorance', 'homophobia', 'etc', 'basically', 'stigmatization', 'slight', 'deviation', 'societal', 'norms', 'Now', 'horror', 'season', 'three', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'suspect', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'series', 'happened', 'peaked', 'early', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'top', 'season', 'two', 'hope', ""'m"", 'wrong']",N/A

I don't mind the blood and gore that comes with a good haunted house story and I don't mind if there is no blood or gore just psychological scariness. Luckily for me this series is jam packed full of both. There are so many twisty turny surprises and when you think you have something figured out you are usually proven wrong. There is blood and gore and horrifying things in almost every episode. This is definitely not a series to watch with your kiddoes but I am thoroughly thrilled that the creator's did not hold back - they show the stabbings, shootings, blood spatter, body parts and best of all Dylan McDermott's naked hiney.I am fascinated by this series and watched it all myself and am now making my husband watch it with me.

1492349,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B005LAJ1O0,AKN,"[1, 1]","Thanks to having Amazon Prime, I am the newest addict for this amazing show.Watch the first episode and (fair warning) you will be too.Jessica Lange was always a favorite of mine but she absolutely mesmerizes in this, in spite of being a lady ""of a certain age"".  I cannot believe how time has not only not hurt her, but has even added immensely to her looks and acting talent, which was always fantastic anyway.  Her acting here is hypnotic and has won her yet another Emmy to add to her collection, this time for best performance in a television series, and I must say this, it is most definitely well deserved. I cannot believe the quality of her acting here, it must be seen to be appreciated.  Her role here started as a very small one, but when her brilliance was seen, she was given much more script, to become a lead character.A cast of eccentrics, all of whom have a connection to a lovely but extremely haunted old Victorian mansion, all become tightly wedged into the intrigue and drama (and outright horror)  that pervades every second.The intro to each episode, and the soundtrack, have to be the absolute best that has ever adorned the television screen.  This is a brand of creepiness that I've never encountered anywhere.  How can old photographs of babys and toddlers inspire such a blend of horror? Maybe it's the large lab jars of tiny heads, hands and legs that are flashed on the screen, and the strange horror on the children's faces.  I wish I had twenty minutes of that intro soundtrack.  It's just delicious and creepy, totally brilliant.Who or rather what is living up there in the attic all these years?  And is that school shooter a ghost, or a warm blooded very alive boyfriend for the oddly appealing adolescent girl, who is a ""cutter""?What exactly is the mother pregnant with this time?  Who or what impregnated her, dressed in that latex head to toe costume?And on and on the bizarre plot twists go, each one seemingly more strange than the next.  The storyline is fantastic, the acting is all over the top brilliant, and the settings are very much a part of the action.I can't praise this highly enough, nor can I ever get my fill of it.

The special effects, the scary scenes and the drama make this show one of the best horror shows of the last few years; it has a little bit of something, it's just not horror and blood, you get to see a psychological side of the characters before the craziness shows up.Anyway, if you're looking for an awesome show, you have to watch this!

1492361,A2DTA8JEG92IT2,B005LAJ1O0,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I'd highly recommend checking this out. This series, so far, (I'm only a few episodes in) is engaging and creepy on many levels, and for someone who's seen tons of the horror/drama genre, that's saying something. In short, it's takes a lot to get under my jaded, psychological skin and be pleasantly surprised by avoiding the usual clich&eacute;s, including its clever blends of drama, suspense, mystery, romance, etc. It's also slickly edited without the camera work being intrusive or overly visually composed; moreover, as anyone in the industry would tell you, great film always starts with the script, including the right balance of the familiar with the unfamiliar, and again, this series, so far, has a solid foundation in this department. Topping it off is great casting, a nice blend again of the familiar and unfamiliar with characters we can actually believe in and care about. It's all about character ultimately, no? Hand in hand are the crew if stellar actors, all of whom, like Jessica Lange--certainly a standout, get the job done convincingly and with panache. It's nice when the acting is so polished, one forgets it's happening. Lastly, for someone with my schedule, it's impossible to find even a free hour most days to escape the real world for a few, so the short episodes please. What a pleasure to sit back in my lazy boy about midnight with my Kindle, some popcorn and whatever, and spin off the day's real world dramas with a nice dose of high quality, populist and happily, relatively mindless art. What remains to be seen is can this series sustain its promising start or will it go the way of say, the Walking Dead, becoming painfully watchable after a dozen or so episodes because the plot's all over the place and nowhere simultaneously, and one starts getting annoyed by the characters' acting tics? I hope not. So much can go wrong when one has to keep so many balls in the air, but again, so far, this series has been a surprisingly and pleasantly creepy rabbit hole. PS. A minor annoyance with almost all these current genre pieces are the tedious rip off opening credit sequences straight out of the cutting edge genre prototypes; I think the original was probably Fincher's ""Seven"", but these latest raw montage openings complete with ragged, frenetic soundtrack, have definitely lost their luster, seem forced and fake, almost comical, and thereby create the exact opposite effect they intend. Amazing by contrast, how, for example, Hitchcock's opening to Psycho, with Bernard Hermann's staccato violins still do the job all these years later, then again, genius is genius.",5,"Very slick, atmospheric series",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,2611,"[""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'series', 'far', ""'m"", 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'engaging', 'creepy', 'many', 'levels', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'tons', 'horror/drama', 'genre', 'saying', 'something', 'short', 'lot', 'get', 'jaded', 'psychological', 'skin', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'avoiding', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'including', 'clever', 'blends', 'drama', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'romance', 'etc', 'also', 'slickly', 'edited', 'camera', 'work', 'being', 'intrusive', 'overly', 'visually', 'composed', 'moreover', 'anyone', 'industry', 'would', 'tell', 'great', 'film', 'always', 'script', 'including', 'right', 'balance', 'familiar', 'unfamiliar', 'again', 'series', 'far', 'solid', 'foundation', 'department', 'Topping', 'off', 'great', 'casting', 'nice', 'blend', 'again', 'familiar', 'unfamiliar', 'characters', 'can', 'actually', 'believe', 'care', 'about', 'character', 'ultimately', 'Hand', 'hand', 'are', 'crew', 'stellar', 'actors', 'whom', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'certainly', 'standout', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'convincingly', 'panache', 'nice', 'when', 'acting', 'so', 'polished', 'one', 'happening', 'Lastly', 'someone', 'schedule', 'impossible', 'find', 'even', 'free', 'hour', 'most', 'days', 'escape', 'real', 'world', 'few', 'short', 'episodes', 'please', 'What', 'pleasure', 'sit', 'back', 'lazy', 'boy', 'midnight', 'Kindle', 'popcorn', 'whatever', 'spin', 'off', 'day', 'real', 'world', 'dramas', 'nice', 'dose', 'high', 'quality', 'populist', 'happily', 'relatively', 'mindless', 'art', 'What', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'series', 'promising', 'start', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'say', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'becoming', 'painfully', 'watchable', 'dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'plot', 'place', 'nowhere', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'getting', 'annoyed', 'characters', 'acting', 'tics', 'hope', 'not', 'So', 'much', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'one', 'keep', 'so', 'many', 'balls', 'air', 'again', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'been', 'surprisingly', 'pleasantly', 'creepy', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'PS', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'almost', 'current', 'genre', 'pieces', 'are', 'tedious', 'rip', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequences', 'straight', 'cutting', 'edge', 'genre', 'prototypes', 'think', 'original', 'was', 'probably', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'latest', 'raw', 'montage', 'openings', 'complete', 'ragged', 'frenetic', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'definitely', 'lost', 'luster', 'seem', 'forced', 'fake', 'almost', 'comical', 'thereby', 'create', 'exact', 'opposite', 'effect', 'intend', 'Amazing', 'contrast', 'how', 'example', 'Hitchcock', 'opening', 'Psycho', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'staccato', 'violins', 'still', 'do', 'job', 'years', 'later', 'then', 'again', 'genius', 'genius']",N/A

I'd ""heard"" little about the series, and read a few short articles here and there, but after SIX FEET UNDER and OZ, I refused to get involved in serial television at all. And I didn't! A news junkie M-F, and a sci-fi guy on the weekends, I was fine with supplementing repeats and heavily rotated news with something from my eclectic DVD and laserdisc  collection.I did, however, end up with an Amazon Gift Card from a ""client"" after what was a courtesy photo session...and I saw AMERICAN HORROR STORY ""used/like new"" priced significantly below the list price. OK, why not?  I could always pass it on to a friend if I REALLY hated it. So I bought it.And the DVD box languished on my shelf. No. I wasn't about to start watching a serialized show. I was too busy. I didn't want the addiction which comes with serial television. Hell. I bought the DARK SHADOWS DELUXE LIMITED EDITION BOX SET of the entire 1,225 episodes...and watched THAT again, after seeing its first run in the 60s, and second run on the SciFi (then) channel in the 80s. But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I had to watch it again.And then on Super Bowl Sunday, when the rest of the networks were Toilet Bowl television, I thought ""ok, I'll watch one or two episodes and see what's what.""And two discs later (eight episodes, I think) I had to turn off the television and get to bed.WHAT A SHOW! WHAT A SHOCKER! WHAT A RIOT!It took me a few minutes here and there to figure out what was ""really"" going on, and then I was totally hooked. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is definitely a nod to DARK SHADOWS (1966 - 1971) but not about vampires. It's about the house, and the characters and the storyline. But it's also a shocking nod to the headlines of the day (no spoilers here) and is impeccably sequenced, written and filmed.I'd missed Jessica Lange on the screen for so long, I was surprised and shocked to see she was in the show. Scraping the bottom, Ms Lange? Not in the least! More like on a seriously slow boil with one of the best psychologically-damaged portrayals I'd ever seen. Sheer Jessica Lange. A part written for her, and she just eats it up (literally?) Dylan McDermott was a pleasant surprise. I'd never really been a fan of his, nor had I been a non-fan, but we did go to the same high school (separated by about 3 years) so I like watching a city native (who has a serious backstory of his own!) as a psychiatrist with his personal set of demons sweating it through every episode.I could go on and on and on, but here's the scoop: if you liked DARK SHADOWS (the original series), Se7en, The Twilight Zone (Rod Serling), SIX FEET UNDER, and some noted classic 60s/70s horror movies (ROSEMARY'S BABY, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL), and some other great, and overlooked, art house and/or indie films (THE FALL, INK) you'll love AMERICAN HORROR STORY.There's really nothing like watching something terribly original, walking the razor's edge for the usual television fare, and knowing you've got the whole season (""one long movie"") as someone put it...so just put the discs in and enjoy it, episode after episode (try to watch a disc at a time, or at least two/three episodes in sequence).I'd give this four stars because I know it's going to come to the last episode and the roller coaster ride will be over, but AMERICAN HORROR STORY rates a TEN for me. Everything about it is great.Watch this with blocks of time, an open mind, open eyes, and put it on pause if you need to leave the room. Missing even five minutes can derail a future character development (or appearance!)If you love Jessica Lange? This is perfect for you. She's brilliant, and I hope she picks up an award or two.

I can't say every episode was a homerun, but they were all well above average considering our reality littered tv landscape nowadays. The entire concept is not meant to go season after season, so be prepared for this storyline to be finished and a new cast and location is supposed to start season 2. I thought the actors/actresses all did fine jobs, with a few standout performances (Lange and Peters in particular). The show does end with some questions, but it reminds me more of short stories that leave enough of a thread open so that the reader can think of their own ideal way for the story to wrap up.

1492403,AAB0BPNWDIOXJ,B005LAJ1O0,Camazotz,"[61, 114]","American Horror Story sucks. It's a show created by a bunch of lazy scumbags hoping that the audience will mistake petty theft, grand larceny and death-row worthy sloth for homage, pastiche and hipster-caliber apathy. In truth it's a giant, stinking turd and all of the washed up actors in the world posing and preening around it will never make it smell any better.AHS orbits around the painfully boring, conveniently wealthy and generally uncharismatic Harmon family. Vivien, the mother and wife, has just had a miscarriage at 45 years old and she's all broken up over the loss of a pregnancy whose success was about as long a shot as my being crowned Miss America. She goes home to a capacious, minimalist mansion to weep prettily and pop pills when she hears noises from upstairs. Exploration reveals that these sounds are coming from her husband, Ben, who is nut-deep in a 20-something psych-student from a class he'd been teaching. This was his way of dealing with the miscarriage, we're eventually told. Their teenaged daughter isn't introduced right away, but when we finally meet Violet, it's made clear that her principal interests are sitting near novels by Camus while listening to prodigious amounts of nu-gaze and shallowly cutting at her forearms with straight razors, which is probably what she was doing in some dimly lit room not far away from her philandering father.Because these bozos are the central characters in AHS, they can't do anything rational, like get divorced and fight bitterly over everything from their daughter to a pair of Bose headphones. They have to do something completely irrational, like determine that the only way they are going to keep their family together is to pack up and move to a quaint Richardsonian Romanesque across the country that's so notorious for being an epicenter of homicide that it has become the crowning gem of an L.A. bus tour catering to murder groupies.They buy the house straight away, ignorant of just how blood soaked it is--even if Murder House Tours seems to drop by with its megaphone yammering tour guide every hour on the hour--and settle in for a little haunting. The ghosts include: an old workhorse maid--a young slutty maid--a Dr. Frankenstein type that's not scary, just gross--the bride of Dr. Frankenstein, who is also not scary, just a harpy--two twin boys--a possum monster that stays in the basement--the kid from The Mask, who is up in the attic--another kid that was killed by the police after performing a Columbine-like mass murder at his high school--six victims of the Columbine kid's homicidal rage--two nurses murdered by AHS's answer to Richard Speck--three faux-Speck groupies that wanted to recreate the original crime in The Murder House--the Black Dahlia--the student that was humping Ben in the beginning of the show--two gay men that, when they're not shopping for ""ball stretchers"" or butt-plugs that can't be removed without contacting a proctologist and a safe-cracker or rubber S&M; suits, are frequently talking about having a baby (in fact, a good 2/3rds of the ghosts in AHS are obsessed with having, finding, keeping, and/or stealing a baby)--and two children and a mother who were burnt up in the house by one of the few characters who remained alive through the duration of AHS. Oh, yeah, eventually the whole Harmon family is killed too. I probably missed about a dozen other ghosts. Oh well.Vivien basically tackles the role of Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby. She even eats raw meat and gives birth to the Antichrist, which was raped into her by the ghost that is otherwise ""in love"" with her daughter. Gee, how classy...and way to think for yourselves, AHS hacks. Ben is forced to play into a kind of Jack Torrence role as his career as a psychiatrist becomes a joke thanks to extreme self-doubt, nude somnambulism and...well...taking on ghosts as patients. How does this tool get paid? Violet hangs around the Columbine killer ghost and flirts with him and talks about her affection for Morrissey when not whining about how hard it is to be spoiled half to death by parents that can buy $15,000 sofas and dream of sending her miserable butt to Harvard. Jessica Lange wanders through now and again to chew scenery with a retarded daughter in tow, along with an occasional boy-toy and a psychic that has an even shoddier grasp of history than mine. Not that a psychic is needed on this show; every character and their stinking poodles can see all of the ghosts just fine. The man that burnt his family alive in Murder House makes an occasional appearance so that he might kill someone else or try to woo Jessica Lange back into his life; generally these two actions are treated as being one and the same.The whole show is basically one long ramble of rapes, gapes, attacks, strobe lights, emotional breakdowns, histrionic fits, murders, ghosts acting more like perverse agoraphobes than ghosts, and inappropriate music selections (the Columbine kid is wandering around whistling Twisted Nerve while looking for fellow students to shoot about five years before the release of Kill Bill? Sure. And every damn time the camera is about to pan on to Dr. Frankenstein, they play the main theme from Bram Stoker's Dracula. There are other scores thrown in for good measure, including Psycho. Do the creators of this oozing cyst of a series honestly think that people will cheerfully exclaim ""...wow, that's from Kill Bill! I know that song! I like that song, therefore I like the people that are turning my brain into a small lump of pumice with this shameless twaddle!"" I can't think of any other reason they employed these notorious pieces of music).This show is as gross and thoughtless as a crack head fiending for a hit and just as desperate, willing to throw out any line that might lead you to handing over a few bucks. As if it's not vile enough to rip off about 20 infamous horror films, but they also have to throw in Richard Speck, The Black Dahlia, and Columbine? Gee, I can't wait for season two, where they drag out the entire plot of Saw, mashing it up with Silence Of The Lambs, and then toss in Charlene Gallego and Aileen Wuornos having lesbian sex over the soundtrack from Xanadu for extra spice.Well, would you look at that? I just wrote my own miniseries.",1,"Scared by unoriginal, tasteless garbage?

As You probably know, the Black Dahlia murder is the most gruesome unsolved crime in the history of the USA.I could tell before the opening credits started that this was something I was interested in. As creator Ryan Murphy says, this seasons focus was about infidelity. It did have a great dark suburban tone like Twin Peaks despite it taking place in Los Angeles.I found all the cast to be great, Taissa Farmiga will be great to watch out for. She excelled as the brutally conflicted teenager Violet Harmon, whose mother, Connie Britton as Vivian Harmon is living the American Dream become nightmare whose husband Ben played by Dylan McDermott as a psychiatrist with plenty of his own issues.Other new talents I enjoyed were Lily Rabe as Nora Montgomery; a socialite married to a prominent doctor with some huge demons and Evan Peters as Tate Langdon, the son of Constance Langdon played perfectly by Jessica Lange. A southern belle that believes in old fashioned manners and her own form of justice which makes her the most terrifying neighbor since the Young family in Desperate Housewives.The mini-series is a very well-written, refreshingly original take to the 'haunted house'. Once you finish the first 10 episodes and you understand everything, it's a real mind warp that is disturbingly profound and profoundly disturbing.TV-MA LSVMy rating: 16+American Horror Story is essentially as violent as a horror movie would be. In this season the violence is pretty graphic and can be disturbing to younger or more sensitive viewers. There are many 'scary moments', frequent mild profanities, a scene of drug use and many scenes that would disturb people. Episode 6 is I think by far the most graphic and disturbing episode, but I think a 16 year old can handle it.Suggested rating; 16+ for strong violence and gore, disturbing images, language and sexual content including brief nudity.",5,A groundbreaking series TV has been asking for,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2226,"['Starring', 'Connie', 'BrittonDylan', 'McDermottTaissa', 'FarmigaEvan', 'PetersJessica', 'LangeDenis', ""O'HareFrances"", 'ConroyKate', 'MaraAlexandra', 'BreckenridgeMatt', 'RossLily', 'RabeChristina', 'EstabrookJamie', 'Brewerand', 'Sarah', 'PaulsonI', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'convinced', 'check', 'out', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'interpretation', 'probably', 'know', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'murder', 'most', 'gruesome', 'unsolved', 'crime', 'history', 'USA.I', 'could', 'tell', 'opening', 'credits', 'started', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'interested', 'creator', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'seasons', 'focus', 'was', 'infidelity', 'did', 'have', 'great', 'dark', 'suburban', 'tone', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'taking', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles.I', 'found', 'cast', 'be', 'great', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'watch', 'out', 'excelled', 'brutally', 'conflicted', 'teenager', 'Violet', 'Harmon', 'mother', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'Vivian', 'Harmon', 'living', 'American', 'Dream', 'become', 'nightmare', 'husband', 'Ben', 'played', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'psychiatrist', 'plenty', 'own', 'issues.Other', 'new', 'talents', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'Lily', 'Rabe', 'Nora', 'Montgomery', 'socialite', 'married', 'prominent', 'doctor', 'huge', 'demons', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'Tate', 'Langdon', 'son', 'Constance', 'Langdon', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'southern', 'belle', 'old', 'fashioned', 'manners', 'own', 'form', 'justice', 'most', 'terrifying', 'neighbor', 'Young', 'family', 'Desperate', 'Housewives.The', 'mini-series', 'very', 'well-written', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'take', ""'haunted"", 'house', 'finish', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'understand', 'everything', 'real', 'mind', 'warp', 'disturbingly', 'profound', 'profoundly', 'disturbing.TV-MA', 'LSVMy', 'rating', '16+American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'essentially', 'as', 'violent', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'season', 'violence', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'younger', 'more', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'are', 'many', ""'scary"", 'moments', 'frequent', 'mild', 'profanities', 'scene', 'drug', 'use', 'many', 'scenes', 'would', 'disturb', 'people', 'Episode', '6', 'think', 'far', 'most', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'episode', 'think', '16', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'handle', 'it.Suggested', 'rating', '16+', 'strong', 'violence', 'gore', 'disturbing', 'images', 'language', 'sexual', 'content', 'including', 'brief', 'nudity']",N/A

She becomes yet another of the very best film actors to make the transition to the small screen.  Even better, she is not playing some goody two shoes in this ghost filled series.  No, she lives next door to the Murder House in Los Angeles, in which an amazing amount of ghosts have taken up residence over the decades after a botched experience of trying to live in the house while still living. Charlotte (Lange) is tied to this house and all of the ghosts in it although we only discover this in layers and not even entirely in this first season.The first season involves yet another family taking up residence in the house, a husband, wife and teen daughter.  The husband is a psychiatrist who practices from home.  He is so clueless that he can't tell the difference if his new patient is a ghost or not! This was one of the more humorous aspects to the series.

1492429,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B005LAJ1O0,Claire,"[15, 52]","Maybe I'm in the minority here who finds ""American Horror Story"" absolutely repulsive or else I'm the only one who's willing to write about it. I have been shocked lately at what I've seen appear on the FX channel. I'm convinced this channel prides itself on being the most tasteless & morally bankrupt of all cable channels. At best this show is borderline pornographic with elements of ""torture porn,"" a concept that has experienced a resurgence of popularity lately.Maybe I am a tad on the prudish side but I think this show is just trying to capitalize on shock tactics by taking everything taboo to such extremes that it makes me feel downright embarrassed to watch it. TV shows should entertain me not make me cringe. Every element is depicted so graphically that there is no room left to use one's imagination. When it comes to being scared by a movie or tv show, many times what is left to the viewer's imagination becomes scarier than what is actually depicted. Here everything is graphically displayed in over-the-top images that leave one feeling disturbed, disgusted, dejected.I cannot think of a show that places more emphasis on sex (a perverted distorted kind) in combination with intense violent images including S & M tones and topped off with some language, though the language is the least of the problems. I truly think the creators/writers/producers of this show are merely relying on shocking the audience to keep its members tuned in.I wish this show would focus on scaring us instead of shocking us. There is a big difference between terrifying/ horrifying and plain old shocking. If this show's primary goal is to provide a way for the audience to feel frightened, then it overshoots is mark and instead repels and repulses rather than draws us in by being seductively thrilling. We aren't just taunted here, we are bludgeoned. This is a shame because the premise is so great- the setting of a haunted mansion with all kinds of ghosts and forces of darkness provides a limitless source of thrills, chills and spills. Don't get me wrong here- I love a good scare. But all those things are graphically exploited ad nauseum. It's almost a gore-fest. Even the title/opening sequence is a sick bloodfest similar to the ""True Blood"" opener (and that's nothing to be proud of.)I have never thought it enjoyable to watch graphic sex and, besides the stereotype in slasher flicks to have casual sex run rampant within, there really is no need to contain so much here. I have always thought watching two people have sex is like watching someone take a huge crap. (It seems so voyeuristic- (sp?) I mean do most people make it a point to sit and watch their friends or family members engaging in sexual intercourse? Does it become acceptable if it's on a tv show?) I'm not sure what part sex plays in chilling scare-you-to-death movies other than, as I said above, it seems to be a key ingredient without which no slasher flick is complete. Okay, if it must be in there then fine, but does it have to turn into a huge pork-fest where people are humping each other's brains out?Even worse is the combination of the borderline porn and the vulgar gore. Seeing a man get a chimney poker shoved up his rectum by a leather-and-chain-clad figure is totally sick. This show is obviously going for the gross-out and leaving no bases uncovered. I think it must be a contest on the FX channel to see which show can morally offend the most people. ""Sons of Anarchy"" and ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" as well as ""Anger Management"" and even at times ""The League"" (though I admit that one does make me laugh at times, once I've endured all the masturbation jokes and the actual masturbation scenes) all seem to be in contention for who can be the most morally bankrupt.Anyway, this show could have been cool but overdoes it with its wretched excess that's in-your-face and over-the-top. I wish creators would subscribe to the belief that subtle is better and less is more.

At first, I expected this to be the sign of a brilliant show, and that all these twists would come together in an equally brilliant culmination.  However, it quickly became apparent that the writers had simply run out of ideas, and were beginning to guide the show more like a soap opera.As another reviewer points out, the references to Columbine are tasteless.  Not to mention they are a prime example of the horrible writing; in one scene, the school killer describes asking a girl ""Do you believe in God?"" before he kills her...yet later, we actually get to SEE the killer kill that girl, and he never asks the question.I watched this show hoping to find something to replace my Breaking Bad fix, and to bide my time between new episodes of The Walking Dead.  But after this first season, I am done.  On that note, the last couple episodes are HORRIBLE.  The story telling gets almost cartoonish, with awkward failed attempts at comedy, and a pretty clear ripoff of Beetlejuice (although I should have guessed, given the obvious attempt with the Winona Ryder-esque daughter).If you enjoy mindless entertainment and don't care about plot holes galore, then this show might be for you.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","For those of us who thought the horror genre was gone forever as serial television, AMERICAN HORROR STORY arrived to dispel that notion.  Innovative and creative--with the most jarring and disturbing opening credits sequence in all of television--AMERICAN HORROR STORY is about an old Gothic mansion in LA.  The house harbors dark forces so powerful that all its inhabitants succumb to terror and madness--all its inhabitants lose their lives, either at their own hands, or at the hands of others; to die in the ""Murder House"", as it is known to those familiar with its history, is to be eternally cursed.  The ghosts of those who have died in the house are condemned to remain there forever.  And the Harmon family from Boston, a troubled trio moving cross country for a much-needed fresh start, comprises the essence of the DVD collection for AMERICAN HORROR STORY - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON.I had never seen this series when it made its original run on FX.  I received this 4-disc collection as a gift, and do I ever owe the giver some heartfelt gratitude.  The Harmons, psychiatrist Ben (Dylan McDermott), musician Vivien (Connie Britton), and their daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga), definitely need a change of scenery.  Ben has been unfaithful, while Vivien has just suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage.  They fall in love with an old, very unique house (constructed in the Twenties), and are surprised the sale price is so low.  When it's disclosed the previous owners have died in the house, they decide to take the home anyway.  The home ""comes"" with a housekeeper (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Breckenridge) who appears as a seductress to men, and as a matronly, elderly lady to women.  Headstrong next-door neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange) can't seem to stay away from the house, while troubled teen Tate (Evan Peters) becomes one of Ben's first patients, and becomes very attracted to Violet.  Finally, Ben is stalked by Larry (Dennis O'Hare), a horribly disfigured man who constantly warns Ben to take his family and flee the house.  This is the core cast as the series unfolds, with each succeeding episode introducing new characters--inhabitants from the past--and layer upon layer of storylines and subplots.  The episodes build to one very satisfying season finale.I mentioned AMERICAN HORROR STORY is innovative and creative.  Is it ever.  The writing, acting, editing (particularly the jump-editing), camera angles, and effects create a disturbing and compelling effect.  This is one exceptionally-made series.  However, one star off for the plot and logistical inconsistences (and they stick out like a sore thumb), nuisances that will not take away from the overall enjoyment of this series.  Special features include an audio commentary of the opening episode by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, along with behind-the-scenes looks at the cast, crew, and a detailed discussion of the making of the disturbing opening credits.  AMERICAN HORROR STORY - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is a must-have for all horror buffs.--D.

1492464,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B005LAJ1O0,Douglas King,"[32, 33]","With ""Nip/Tuck"" Ryan Murphy created a television show that supposedly revolved around the lives of two prominent plastic surgeons. The show, however, more often seemed more like a psycho-sexual horror story than it did a medical drama. So it was only logical that, for his next show on F/X (let's not even bring ""Glee"" into this conversation, alright?) he would just completely abandon storytelling based on any sort of conventional reality and create a show that exists within the loose, unpredictable, and often absurd genre of horror.The first season of ""American Horror Story"" involves a family of three (Psychiatrist/Father/Adulterer Ben, Wife/Mother/Woman-Scorned Vivien, and Daughter/Teenager/Depressive Violet) as they try to make a fresh start in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they're not aware that the beautiful and suspiciously underpriced house they bought has a history of various murders, suicides, and other brutality, and is haunted by not just one ghost, but a smorgasbord of the living dead (some malevolent, some benign).Although Ben, Vivien, and Violet are the show's supposed main characters, the most important and powerful character on the show is really the house itself. It's made clear throughout the season that the house is its own entity; drawing people to it, driving them to madness, and then containing them once they're dead. (One of the few ""rules"" of the show is that anyone who dies on the house's property is doomed to haunt it forever.) Over the years the house had claimed many victims, so the show each week often introduces the viewer to a new character, usually from a distant past, whose tragic fate involves haunting what the neighborhood refers to as ""the Murder House."" Some of the macabre characters who haunt the house include the historical Black Dahlia, a Columbine-esque teenage mass murderer, a modern gay couple, a severely deformed young man, and a housekeeper who appears as a matronly old woman when living women see her and as a naughty temptress when men see her.Every episode of the show is completely over-the-top, filled with all kinds of outrageous plot twists meant to shock, titillate, provoke, and crack up the audience.

Interestingly, though, is that each episode is entertaining enough to stand on its own and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in the context of what may have preceded it.Nevertheless, try to watch the series in order, from Episode One and on.  If you enjoy getting the creeps, this show does that without your even realizing it.  First you're watching a rather blah family living in a house that has a bad history.  You meet the neighbors and the husband's psych patients.  Yes, they're weird, but you'd expect that from a TV show with the word ""horror"" in its title.Ah, good.  You've let your guard down.  Now the fun begins.You're in the right frame of mind to soon be asking yourself, ""What the heck was that I just saw?""  And ""That didn't just happen, did it?""When the final credits roll, on each episode, you'll say, ""Oh, wow, that was creepy.""All the performers in the series are top-notch, from the leads to the incidental characters.  The wow factor about the cast is that one of the most talented and elusive actresses of our generation, Jessica Lange, is part of the troupe.  She plays one of the creepy neighbors.In many ways, the show feels like an experience in experimental theater.  Without warning, we will be treated to a bizarre segment that seems to have no connection to the storyline.  The scenes are bizarre, but provocative and interesting to watch.  But unlike experimental theater where drawing meaning and connections is solely up to the individual in the audience, the seemingly out-of-place vignettes in ""American Horror Story"" will make sense as the story continues to unfold.  Part of the show's creepiness is not knowing right away what certain things mean.  Tension builds when we feel we're on the brink of a revelation.This show is suited just fine for the more squeamish horror fan.  This is not a gratuitous gore fest.  One pretty girl suffers a severely deep gash in her face.  But the chills and thrills are not derived from seeing her bloody cheek; it's figuring out how the wound got there in the first place.",5,No hammy actors in this horror show!,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,2126,"['American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'indeed', 'series', 'overarching', 'storyline', 'Interestingly', 'though', 'episode', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'context', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'preceded', 'it.Nevertheless', 'try', 'watch', 'series', 'order', 'Episode', 'One', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'creeps', 'show', 'even', 'realizing', 'First', ""'re"", 'watching', 'rather', 'blah', 'family', 'living', 'house', 'bad', 'history', 'meet', 'neighbors', 'husband', 'psych', 'patients', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'weird', ""'d"", 'expect', 'TV', 'show', 'word', 'horror', 'title.Ah', 'good', ""'ve"", 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'Now', 'fun', 'begins.You', ""'re"", 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'soon', 'be', 'asking', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'just', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'happen', 'did', 'When', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Oh', 'wow', 'was', 'creepy', 'performers', 'series', 'are', 'top-notch', 'leads', 'incidental', 'characters', 'wow', 'factor', 'cast', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'elusive', 'actresses', 'generation', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'part', 'troupe', 'one', 'creepy', 'neighbors.In', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'experience', 'experimental', 'theater', 'warning', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'bizarre', 'segment', 'have', 'connection', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'are', 'bizarre', 'provocative', 'interesting', 'watch', 'experimental', 'theater', 'where', 'drawing', 'meaning', 'connections', 'solely', 'individual', 'audience', 'seemingly', 'out-of-place', 'vignettes', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'story', 'unfold', 'Part', 'show', 'creepiness', 'not', 'knowing', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'certain', 'things', 'mean', 'Tension', 'when', 'feel', ""'re"", 'brink', 'revelation.This', 'show', 'suited', 'just', 'fine', 'more', 'squeamish', 'horror', 'fan', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'fest', 'One', 'pretty', 'girl', 'severely', 'deep', 'gash', 'face', 'chills', 'thrills', 'are', 'not', 'derived', 'seeing', 'bloody', 'cheek', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'wound', 'got', 'there', 'first', 'place']",N/A

I liked the cast for it and eventually when the teasers were released I was all about it. I have always been a big horror fan and like most I am all about a good ghost story, especially a series. This is the first season of the show that would eventually be named ""Murder house"" for obvious reasons. I am happy to announce that this show was great as was the next season as is the current one now.The first season is all about a family of three who move into an old house, a house with history and guests who don't want to leave. Father Ben, wife Vivien and daughter Violet are trying t start over in life after a series of setbacks. Setbacks such as Vivien giving birth to a stillborn baby as well as her husband cheating on her with one of his students, who may not be completely out of the picture. All seems well enough until they hear the stories of their new house, ""Murder House"" as the locals call it. Things start up from there as previous residents of the home seem to not be able to leave. The reason being that some where up to twenty people have died in the house.This was an excellent show that kept me interested all the way to the very last episode. What made it even better was that I knew that I was going to get an ending since every season would be a different story. What better way to start out with than a haunted house tale. They way that the ghosts interact with the living in this show is great since they actually seem like real people who are still there. Now that is nothing new in this kind of story but the characters are very well written and acted as well.Dylan McDermott [husband], Connie Britton [wife], and Taissa Farmiga [daughter] are excellent as the family that moves in. each has their own problems to deal with and portray here and as the lead cast members the majority of the show falls on them. Still everyone here throughout the entire season is great from the smallest role to all the supporting roles. The writing, direction, and the way the show was shot all match the performances on every level.Now this show is not for everybody as some have called it a little risky, especially as far as the sexuality goes.

1492491,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B005LAJ1O0,fsnva,"[1, 1]","AMERICAN HORROR STORY is one of those series that is best enjoyed by getting the box set and viewing multiple episodes at once.  It's the perfect way to keep track of the series's many, many, twists and turns, along with some jaw dripping revelations over the course of the first season.  And let the viewer be warned yet again: there is graphic sexual content and violence, the kind that pushes the limit about as far as it can go for cable television.But for those who like this kind of stuff, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is must see TV.  The basic premise is one of those horror story tropes: family goes through emotional trauma (psychology professor husband is caught cheating with a student)and moves across the country to LA and a fresh start, which includes buying an old house with a past in a quiet neighborhood. This Murder House, as it is called, has more than a few things in common with the Overlook Hotel from THE SHINNING, in that it is a place where a lot of bad things have happened to a lot of people, mostly former owners and some unlucky visitors.  Basically, what dies in the Murder House, stays in the Murder House and within these walls, the ghosts are all too real. These ghosts want things of those who are still alive and will do whatever it takes to get them. Not all of this is explained up front in the first episodes and part of the fun is figuring out who is dead and who is still among the living (at least for the moment).One of the many things viewers might find off putting initially is that the story's principle characters, played by Dylan McDermott, Connie Britton, and Tessa Farmiga, are so down right unlikable and unsympathetic right from the get go.  McDermott's psychiatrist is an adulterer who is remorseful only because he got caught red handed, while Britton's wife is cold, bitter, and unforgiving-the complete opposite of the wife and mother she played on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  Teenage daughter Farmiga is sullen, full of resentment and hopelessly self absorbed.  Not the kind of people with whom you'd want to spend time, but without giving away any spoilers, it is safe to say that where these characters start out is not where they end up.  In the end, everyone is where they need to be, for good or bad.Over the course of the season one, the plot comes to include such elements as the birth of the Anti-Christ, a Columbine like massacre, miss treatment of the mentally challenged, illegal abortions, kinky sex, rape, multiple murders, and a character in a Gimp suite. All that and the enduring legacy of family dysfunction, seeping into the woodwork generation after generation like so much toxic waste. A lot of viewers will be turned off or rubbed the wrong way, and not with out good reason.  But for those who are game, it'll be well worth the watch.Maybe AMERICAN HORROR STORY's chief virtue is the excellent cast and superior acting which goes a long way toward helping sell the often outrageous actions of the characters.  And the most outrageous of them all is Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance Langdon, a faded southern belle who once lived in the Murder House herself and has left more than memories behind her there. Constance is the kind of part Bette Davis would have played back in her Baby Jane days, a human monster who makes even the dead cringe.  Lange is given great support by Frances Conroy as Moira, the maid who has been on the job a very long time; Evan Peters as a most troubled teen, a patient of McDermott's and secret boyfriend to Farmiga; and Denis O'Hare, as Constance's horribly disfigured ex lover who keeps hanging around for a reason.There are also appearances by such familiar faces as Charles S. Dutton, Zachary Quinto, Lilly Rabe, Matt Ross, Kate Mara, Mena Suvari, Eric Stonestreet, Morris Chestnut, Christine Estabrook, David Anthony Higgins, and Brando Eaton.Give credit to writers and creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, in AMERICAN HORROR STORY they have come up with something about as far from the saccharine sweetness of GLEE as it was possible to get.

1492521,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B005LAJ1O0,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 1]","If AMERICAN HORROR STORY doesn't give you nightmares, nothing will. There is nothing like this show on TV and it is beyond creey and scary. It is am homage to every horror film that has come before it and you'll be hooked after the first episode. Of course, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not for the faint of heart or people easily scared by things that go bump in the night even if it is only on TV. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is beyond all horror and thrillers you have ever seen.AMERICAN HORROR STORY is an actor's dream. There is depth to the characters and we see them over and over. This show was also a casting director's dream (or maybe nightmare). I can't imagine a more thoroughly perfect cast. Everyone plays his or her role with true delight. I could easily spend pages delving into each character and actor but let me start with one of the best. Jessica Lange is at her absolute best as freaky neighbor Contance Langdon. She puts the C in creepy and gee, she is not even one of the dead people in the show. She is attached heart and soul to the picturesque Victorian mansion next door.New buyers Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), his wife Vivien (Connie Britton) and daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) have the misfortune of moving into the house after a couple of family tragedies. Little do they know they have moved into LA's infamous ""murder house."" These three actors are just perfect for their roles. Britton can tell stories of joy, sadness and fear just from her facial expressions. Farmiga is the perfect troubled teen trying to make sense of a crazy world.The fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY is watching each episode and learning about the ""people"" who share murder house with the Harmons. Try not to learn to much of the plot ahead of time and just watch everything unravel. Who is dead and who isn't? Murder House is the a place of eternal misery. People who die in that house, whether by murder or natural causes, never leave.Another fascinating character is Jamie Brewer as Addie, Constance's daughter who was born with Down's Syndrome.Brewer is great in her role. Is she evil or just a victim of a horrible parent. She sees dead people. Then there is Evan Peters as Tate. Another great role of a trouble teenager with a seriously troubled past.So many characters have connections that should be revealed as you watch the series and not in a review.And to add to the mix, we have Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as the mysterious housekeeper Moira O'Hara?Why two actresses in one role? You'll find out soon enough and it's a stunner. Both actresses are perfect in their roles. Another standout is Kata Mara as Hayden McClaine. If you're having trouble with your ex-mistress, just wait until she is dead and starts visiting your wife!Another of my favorites is Zachary Quinto as one-half of the dead gay couple that lives in the house. You see my point about not knowing too much about the plot before you start watching? Such great writing and it makes me wonder what nightmares the writers were having to come up with all this horror and thrills.Watching this great cast interact is part of the fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY. We get to learn the back story of this house built in the 1920's for a famous doctor and his wife and son. Here is the beginning of the murder house.AMERICAN HORROR STORY also makes references to the 1940's murder of Elizabeth Short known forever as ""The Black Dalia"" and even the murder of actor Sal Mineo in the 1970's. Nothing is left unturn and no subject is taboo.AMERICAN HORROR STORY is addictive but it does have plenty of plot holes. We never know why the house seems to have a life and power of its own and why it feeds on human tragedy. Why are the souls trapped? Why do Constance and Addie see dead people? I could go on and on with questions but just sit back and enjoy these creepiest and scariest ride of your life.",5,"CREEPY, SCARY, FANTASTIC HORROR FUN",1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,3874,"['AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', ""n't"", 'give', 'nightmares', 'nothing', 'will', 'nothing', 'show', 'TV', 'creey', 'scary', 'am', 'homage', 'horror', 'film', 'come', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'first', 'episode', 'course', 'AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'people', 'easily', 'scared', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'even', 'only', 'TV', 'AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'actor', 'dream', 'depth', 'characters', 'see', 'over', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'casting', 'director', 'dream', 'maybe', 'nightmare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'perfect', 'cast', 'Everyone', 'role', 'true', 'delight', 'could', 'easily', 'spend', 'pages', 'delving', 'character', 'actor', 'let', 'start', 'one', 'best', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'absolute', 'best', 'freaky', 'neighbor', 'Contance', 'Langdon', 'C', 'creepy', 'gee', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'dead', 'people', 'show', 'attached', 'heart', 'soul', 'picturesque', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'door.New', 'buyers', 'Ben', 'Harmon', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'wife', 'Vivien', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'daughter', 'Violet', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'have', 'misfortune', 'moving', 'house', 'couple', 'family', 'tragedies', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'have', 'moved', 'LA', 'infamous', 'murder', 'house', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Britton', 'can', 'tell', 'stories', 'joy', 'sadness', 'fear', 'just', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Farmiga', 'perfect', 'troubled', 'teen', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'crazy', 'world.The', 'fun', 'AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'watching', 'episode', 'learning', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'murder', 'house', 'Harmons', 'Try', 'not', 'learn', 'much', 'plot', 'ahead', 'time', 'just', 'watch', 'everything', 'unravel', 'Who', 'dead', 'who', ""n't"", 'Murder', 'House', 'place', 'eternal', 'misery', 'People', 'who', 'die', 'house', 'murder', 'natural', 'causes', 'never', 'leave.Another', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Jamie', 'Brewer', 'Addie', 'Constance', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Down', 'Syndrome.Brewer', 'great', 'role', 'evil', 'just', 'victim', 'horrible', 'parent', 'dead', 'people', 'Then', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'Tate', 'great', 'role', 'trouble', 'teenager', 'seriously', 'troubled', 'past.So', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'connections', 'should', 'be', 'revealed', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'review.And', 'add', 'mix', 'have', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Alexandra', 'Breckenridge', 'mysterious', 'housekeeper', 'Moira', ""O'Hara"", 'Why', 'two', 'actresses', 'one', 'role', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'soon', 'enough', 'stunner', 'actresses', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'standout', 'Kata', 'Mara', 'Hayden', 'McClaine', ""'re"", 'having', 'trouble', 'ex-mistress', 'just', 'wait', 'dead', 'visiting', 'wife', 'favorites', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'one-half', 'dead', 'gay', 'couple', 'house', 'see', 'point', 'not', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'start', 'watching', 'Such', 'great', 'writing', 'wonder', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'having', 'come', 'up', 'horror', 'thrills.Watching', 'great', 'cast', 'interact', 'part', 'fun', 'AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'get', 'learn', 'back', 'story', 'house', 'built', '1920', 'famous', 'doctor', 'wife', 'son', 'Here', 'beginning', 'murder', 'house.AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'also', 'references', '1940', 'murder', 'Elizabeth', 'Short', 'known', 'forever', 'Black', 'Dalia', 'even', 'murder', 'actor', 'Sal', 'Mineo', '1970', 'Nothing', 'left', 'unturn', 'subject', 'taboo.AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'addictive', 'have', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'house', 'have', 'life', 'power', 'own', 'why', 'human', 'tragedy', 'Why', 'are', 'souls', 'trapped', 'Why', 'do', 'Constance', 'Addie', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'could', 'go', 'questions', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'creepiest', 'scariest', 'ride', 'life']",N/A

1492524,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAJ1O0,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 7]","Ah, AMERICAN HORROR STORY. You know, aside from the wonderfully wacky performances by Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Kate Mara and Denis O'Hare, as well very strong performances by Taissa Farmiga (who looks so much like her older sister Vera that it's creepy), Connie Britton (who is so gorgeous, it hurts), Frances Conroy and her younger, much sexier self Alex Breckenridge, Lily Rabe, Matt Ross, Jamie Brewer, and my personal favorite, Zachary Quinto... there's not much here.Well, you know, except for scenes like Vivien eating a cooked human brain, and believe me, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is LOADED with scenes like that. Ryan Murphy (responsible for another terrifically addictive FX show NIP/TUCK) and his co-showrunner and longtime colleague Brad Falchuk set out to create something that defies expectation of a horror story but keeps you in the game with its deceitfully addictive adult soap opera bits, all the while as parts of the show's mystery unravel as more questions are raised.What caused the house to be like this? Was it just the first murders, or was there something deeper? What does Constance really want with the Harmons? Does each new pope really get a message like the one presented in this show? Will Chad and Patrick ever get their perfect Halloween? Does Ben just REALLY like the stove?Actually, the best question is WHY DON'T THEY JUST LEAVE? That's the question that we all find ourselves screaming at the television when the show is on. And the answer to that question, initially, is this is the stupidest family to have ever soiled the earth with the imprints of their feet. There might as well be a sign out in front of the house that says ""I'M HAUNTED, MORONS!"" and the Harmons would keep crossing that threshold without a moment's hesitation. It's really too obvious, but you're having too much fun with Adelaide's constant break-ins, Tate's whole ""I'm totally tortured and indisputably dangerous, but feel free to date me"" vibe, Constance's casual racism, Hayden's instantaneous transformation from cuckolded lover to bat-$#1T CRAZY, the twins, the Frankenstein baby and Chad's fabulousness.However, as time goes on, Murphy and Falchuk do a very smart thing. They force a family member out of the house, and just a bit later, they force another family member to stay in the house. I'd hate to spoil anything here (other than Viv eating the brain, because that was awesome), but the answers are shocking. And what's even more important is that they work in the context of the show.The show is about truth and illusion, and coming from NIP/TUCK, Murphy and Falchuk are uniquely suited to do such a show. The illusion that this house will somehow save Ben and Vivien's too-fragile marriage as well as the eternally increasing distance from their teenage daughter Violet (who is already half a sociopath as the show starts). The truth is that the house, and its secrets, will destroy them the longer they stay; ultimately, the truth (no matter how painfully obvious it is) is not as powerful as the illusion.Another big part of this show's success is consulting producer and staff writer Tim Minear. Minear is a singular talent in genre entertainment. His ideas and his energy are always helping to branch out and make better whatever program he's working on. Sadly for Minear, all of the shows he's been a producer of (despite their pretty consistent level of excellence) have been cancelled. FIREFLY, STANDOFF, DRIVE, THE INSIDE, THE CHICAGO CODE, TERRIERS, WONDERFALLS... all ashes either during or just after their first seasons. His other shows like ANGEL and DOLLHOUSE actually lasted for at least two seasons, and AHS will join the ranks of those two shows, since it's been picked up for a second season on FX.Make no mistake: AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not a very good horror show, though. Is it creepy? Sure it is. But this show, aside from a few tingly moments (and that can go a few different ways since the show is pretty sexy at times too) doesn't offer much to actually scare you. It's more ""How CRAZY can we make this show?"" rather than ""How SCARY can we make this show?"" and that's problematic at times. Also, there are few actors I've seen in my life that are as wooden and utterly charmless as Dylan McDermott. He's always been the poor man's David Duchovny, much as Bill Pullman is the poor man's Alec Baldwin.Whether or not the new season will focus on a new family and/or a new house remains to be seen. Frankly, I hope that it, at the very least, doesn't change location because there's just way too much fun to be had with these characters. The only reason I would actually like them to go elsewhere is to escape from McDermott, because he adds nothing to the show.",4,The only horrific thing about this show is how addictive it

While I have to say that so far season 2 is superior, nonetheless season 1 is still well worth watching. You can almost visualize the writing staff sitting around asking themselves what they love most about horror movies and then finding the best way to shock and horrify hardcore fans with the best that the genre has to offer. If some of the scenarios or forbidding music feel familiar, you're absolutely correct but these thefts feel more like an homage than a rip-off (music from ""Carrie"" and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" are used particularly well). The cast is just phenomenal in both seasons and I can't say enough positive things about the boldness of starting from scratch with a fresh story in season 2 while using largely the same troupe of actors. Jessica Lange just oozes talent in very scene while Zachary Quinto and the rest of the cast do a fine job all around.

Instead, it definitely goes to the prime roots of our fears, not the cheesy one-dimensional villains of any given B horror flick, but the things that get us to cringe, things that tv audiences cried out against the show for being tasteless. Personally, I felt it showed the true causes of our fears. Things we don't want to think about, the show's creator wanted to get out of his head (and society as well as church-he's a devout Catholic, think about that for a moment) and had to have a good opportunity to do so.What you have is a man that was caught cheating on his wife with a teenage patient. To (reluctantly) start over, they move to Los Angeles and find a beautiful Victorian-era home and, even after finding out its grisly history, move in. Right after they do, bizarre thigns happen. Nothing expectant like blood creeping out the wall or messages appearing on steam-fogged mirrors. Much more disturbing and subtle. Not to mention an exceptionally twisted, psychotic neighbor with multiple layers of her character that reveals more than what's obviously wrong with her in the first place. With all but the last episode, there's a prologue that takes place at random times through the history of the house and shows how the ghosts came to be trapped in the house, some far more disturbing than others (including a nice twist of speculation on the Black Dahlia Murder).Exceptional storytelling with both obvious and subtle twists in the story as well the horror elements and the characters having a lot of depth to them (and not only Jessica Lange's character, either, she just ends up being a scene stealer). Not to mention the house itself gives plenty of creative freedom to do as the producers and showmakers wish to and they give theirselves no limit as to what they do- constantly pushing the limit, so some fo the stuff may very well be like a trigger for some (especially if a viewer or two are suicide survivors), but it all comes down to show what we Americans fear about ourselves.Honestly, as a horror fan that got tired of today's status quo on how horror films have become in the last decade and a half, I'm glad that this show came as a breath of fresh (maybe a little tainted) air.

1492532,A106016KSI0YQ,B005LAJ1O0,Jay Dickson,"[3, 4]","Despite its memorably creepy and pulsating title sequence, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is actually shorter on scares than I would have liked. The show's creators, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk (the creators of GLEE and NIP/TUCK), seemed far more interested in creating a complex narrative and a comprehensive mythos than in genuinely scaring their audience; yet even so, the series is still gripping and stays with you. The show is more than a miniseries than a series, with the episode run forming a narrative more or less complete in itself: a dysfuncional small family from Boston buys a faux-Jacobean mansion in Los Angeles, and discovers not only that it is ""The Murder House"" featured in local civic tours of gothic LA but that the many slaughtered occupants in the house cannot rest and can actively menace them. Murphy and Falchuk seem so wound up in going over the top as much as they can in the show's absurdly eventful two-hour pilot that most of the potential for instilling fear in its audience is drained right out. If you make it past about the third episode, however, the show builds up enough narrative momentum so that its elaborate entangling becomes fairly engrossing; and the fact that the Murder House has fairly consistent rules to its haunting (which become slowly revealed as the show works its way to its conclusion) is also quite satisfying.The best thing about the show are the little murderous incidents in the house's past that begin each episode; there's a lot of morbid narrative pleasure to be had in waiting for the former inhabitants to get it, usually as awfully as possible. The supporting actors who make up the various victims and victimizers in the house's history (some of whom remain around it still in the show's present, both living and dead) are some of the best actors working in the United States today, and are more than enough reason to watch the show. Jessica Lange (a deserved winner of the Emmy and the Golden Globe for the show) gets to play the most complex and fun character, a Virginia-bred neighbor who can turn in a second from honeyed hospitality to poison vindictiveness; she offers basically a Master's Class in Gothic acting, and she's well supported by a number of other superb actors such as Christine Estabrook, Denis O'Hare and Lily Rabe as her fellow walking wounded. Less effective are the actors who play the central Harmon family members who have moved into the house; through some dreadful and shallow creative decision, the Harmons are envisioned as sexy glamorpusses rather than as more ordinary people, and so it takes a while to feel much sympathy for or interest in Dr. Ben Harmon, with his improbably perfect ripped abs, or for his wife Vivien, with her eternally fabulous hair. (When does she even find time to go to the salon between all the hauntings and murder attempts?) The actors in question, Dermot Mulroney and Connie Britton, are both quite fine, but they seem centrally miscast, or at least far too done up and prettified. Fortunately they don't much get in the way of Lange and company (and Britton manages ultimately to turn in quite a strong performance overall).",4,The previous occupants,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3147,"['memorably', 'creepy', 'pulsating', 'title', 'sequence', 'AMERICAN', 'HORROR', 'STORY', 'actually', 'shorter', 'scares', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'show', 'creators', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'Brad', 'Falchuk', 'creators', 'GLEE', 'NIP/TUCK', 'seemed', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'creating', 'complex', 'narrative', 'comprehensive', 'mythos', 'genuinely', 'scaring', 'audience', 'yet', 'even', 'so', 'series', 'still', 'gripping', 'stays', 'show', 'more', 'miniseries', 'series', 'episode', 'run', 'forming', 'narrative', 'more', 'less', 'complete', 'dysfuncional', 'small', 'family', 'Boston', 'faux-Jacobean', 'mansion', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'discovers', 'not', 'only', 'Murder', 'House', 'featured', 'local', 'civic', 'tours', 'gothic', 'LA', 'many', 'slaughtered', 'occupants', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'rest', 'can', 'actively', 'menace', 'Murphy', 'Falchuk', 'seem', 'so', 'wound', 'up', 'going', 'top', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'show', 'absurdly', 'eventful', 'two-hour', 'pilot', 'most', 'potential', 'instilling', 'fear', 'audience', 'drained', 'right', 'out', 'make', 'third', 'episode', 'however', 'show', 'up', 'enough', 'narrative', 'momentum', 'so', 'elaborate', 'entangling', 'fairly', 'engrossing', 'fact', 'Murder', 'House', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'rules', 'haunting', 'become', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'show', 'way', 'conclusion', 'also', 'quite', 'satisfying.The', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'are', 'little', 'murderous', 'incidents', 'house', 'past', 'episode', 'lot', 'morbid', 'narrative', 'pleasure', 'be', 'had', 'waiting', 'former', 'inhabitants', 'get', 'usually', 'as', 'awfully', 'possible', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'various', 'victims', 'victimizers', 'house', 'history', 'whom', 'remain', 'still', 'show', 'present', 'living', 'dead', 'are', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'United', 'States', 'today', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'deserved', 'winner', 'Emmy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'show', 'play', 'most', 'complex', 'fun', 'character', 'Virginia-bred', 'neighbor', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'second', 'honeyed', 'hospitality', 'poison', 'vindictiveness', 'basically', 'Master', 'Class', 'Gothic', 'acting', 'well', 'supported', 'number', 'other', 'superb', 'actors', 'such', 'Christine', 'Estabrook', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'Lily', 'Rabe', 'fellow', 'walking', 'wounded', 'Less', 'effective', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'central', 'Harmon', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'moved', 'house', 'dreadful', 'shallow', 'creative', 'decision', 'Harmons', 'are', 'envisioned', 'sexy', 'glamorpusses', 'rather', 'more', 'ordinary', 'people', 'so', 'while', 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'interest', 'Dr.', 'Ben', 'Harmon', 'improbably', 'perfect', 'ripped', 'abs', 'wife', 'Vivien', 'eternally', 'fabulous', 'hair', 'When', 'even', 'find', 'time', 'go', 'salon', 'hauntings', 'murder', 'attempts', 'actors', 'question', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'are', 'quite', 'fine', 'seem', 'centrally', 'miscast', 'least', 'far', 'too', 'done', 'up', 'prettified', 'Fortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'way', 'Lange', 'company', 'Britton', 'ultimately', 'turn', 'quite', 'strong', 'performance', 'overall']",N/A

I had a hard time warming up to the family, but did eventually (the mom was kind of a snob, especially towards Jessica Lange's character).  The flashbacks to prior murders in the home were unsettling (although sometimes derivitive).  I didn't always like their music choices. (The Twisted Nerve song I thought was misplaced.  I don't think it should have been used because it's a song that almost feels specific to Kill Bill.  I immediately thought of Kill Bill and Darryl Hannah walking down the hallway in the nurse's uniform when they showed the boy walking down the hallway of his school. Probably a song that really shouldn't be used in a movie or show again...)  There were some things that I'm not sure were inconsistencies or something I just missed (I only watched the series once through), particularly the history between Jessica Lange and the maid (**SPOILER**:  Why was the maid the only one that aged?  And what happened to Lange's husband who was shot? Maybe someone could reply and explain **END SPOILER**).

I just want to give my general thoughts on this series.  My feelings about this show can be summed up in two words......Jessica Lange!!!  She portrays a southern matriarch with a dark twist.  Her ability to switch from sugar-sweet to a blood letting B*%#H is worth the purchase of this alone.  I would liken her performance in this series to that of Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.  In both of these you have a very strong southern woman who is not afraid to take charge of the situation.  The writers of this series should also be praised for constructing a story that hooks the viewer from the beginning, and then leads us down many dark hallways to understand just how haunted this house truly is.  The thing I really liked about the Horror Story is that it is self-contained.  I don't want to give anything away, but I was quite surprised at the ending.  I am on the edge of my seat as I wait for the beginning of Season Two of this fantastic series.  In the meantime, I will enjoy going back and watching Jessica deliver lines that make me want to whip up a Mint Julep and enjoy it in my swing on the verandah, while perhaps taking a crack shot at the neighbor's annoying dog (insert dark laughter here).

In this episode we get to learn more about Tate's crime and how he died.  It confirmed for me what I knew from the beginning that he was definately a ghost.  Tate scares me, but I find him to be the most interesting character in the show.  He is a whole lot of f'd up and I think we have only scratched the surface of what he is capable of.  I love his relationship with Violet.  It's disturbing, but also darkly romantic.  You have a deeply depressed suicidal girl in love with a psychotic murderous ghost.  It's weird but it works and I am dying to find out what will happen next for these two.  Also, I was proud of Vivian in this episode.  She finally gave that nasty adulterous husband the boot.  Ben is definiately losing it.  Vivian is becoming hot for the security guy, so we'll see how long it is before Rubber Man kills him.  I don't think he wants anyone near his baby mama.  Lastly, of course, we have the incredible talented Jessica Lange as Constance.  She tries to help Violet deal with what Tate is and hopes for her to help him cross over.  Also, there was a very touching scene between Constance and her Medium, Billie, where she told Addy how she really felt about her.

On one hand, AHS grabbed my attention in its early episodes and I thought this was going to be an incredibly fresh and innovative television series.  But somehow the show took a sudden dip and what seemed original or trend-setting suddenly became muddled, redundant as if the writers developed a mid-season inertia, unsure of its direction.  I likewise was disappointed with the show's rather flimsy conclusion.However, AHS is not a failure.  There are several effective scenes and some unexpected twists.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Golden Globe/Emmy winner Jessica Lange is simply stunning as the twisted Constance Langdon, who dominates every scene she's in.  Connie Britton is perfect as Vivian, the beleagured wife/mother required to run the gamut in an extremely demanding role.  The often critically panned Dylan McDermott didn't wow me as the misguided Ben, but his performance is overshadowed by his female counterparts.  Other notable performances:  Frances Conroy, Evan Lewis, Zachary Quinto, Denis O'Hare, Michael Graziadei, Eric Stonestreet and Lily Rabe.

Like a well written book and a can of pringles, you cannot watch just one episode.This single series horror serial has everything - mystery, despair, love, family dysfunction, loss, redemption (of sorts), humor - yes there are parts that I laughed out loud, sex, surprise, and of course . . . horror (some of it of the bloody, depraved kind).What is wonderful about this series?  Everything - the dialogue, the plot - even though the haunted house thing has been done - pun intended - to death, the acting, the cinematography, lighting, camera angles . . . and the ACTING.  Every single role in this series is well acted.  Jessica Lange is crazy good, literally.I do not generally like zombie like horror (too predictable), ""blood and guts gore"" or ""stupid blonde"" horror flicks - unless they are so stupid they are funny (e.g.Scary Movie 4orArmy of Darkness).I also do not like the ""running camera"" theory of cinematography with a lot of jiggling and movement.  There is some of that here - just enough.  There is some first person framing, and some very traditional horror angle framing.  In my view, all of it was just enough and not too much.Some reviewers faulted the series for the sex.  Yes, there is simulated sex in this series (no nudity), but really, nothing even close toGame of Thrones: The Complete First Seasonand to me, it relates to theme - there is a man vs. woman theme in this series.  The main male character has committed adultery, and is trying to reconcile with his wife.  So, as the various ghosts come on to him, and he ""sees""the sex, it is necessary for writers to get these points home visually.  All of these scenes are relatively short, and relate to internal failings of the male character, or the ""young love"" between the teenagers.What is particularly surprising here is the ability to take this somewhat overdone horror genre that is fairly predictable (which probably started beforeThe Amityville Horror (Widescreen/Full Screen)but that is the one I recall most vividly), and make it interesting.There are a few oddities - for example, the main young male character killed 15 kids at his school (note to those who were critical of the gore aspect, none of the actual kill shots are shown), and some of those kids come back to haunt him, even though they did not die in the house.  These gnawing questions that sometimes drive me nuts were not enough to detract from a core cohesive theme.If you enjoy very, very good acting, an interesting story, a lot of surprises, and can stand some gore and sex, this is absolutely a not to be missed series.

The first episode confused me and will probably strike most people as flat out weird, but after the initial shock, you realize with each passing episode just how unique and compelling this show is.American Horror story follows a family of three as they move into a new home called ""Murder House"" by the locals. Since the 1920's, people have been murdered in various ways and their spirits have stayed behind, trapped in the very place they died. In this case, the ghosts from all eras can take physical form as well as vanish in an instant. You slowly learn about the past of each spirit, which adds another element of depth.The writing is always clever, twisted and surprising. I wouldn't call AHS scary (at least to me), but the music and visuals make for one of the creepiest viewing experiences I've ever had.The cast is perfect in every way. You won't find much better acting on the big or small screen. Jessica Lange deserves a nomination of some sort come next year. There are also a bunch of guest stars from other popular movies and TV shows.A little warning about the content. This FX show is really rough for a non-premium station. They push the sex, language and violence further than I thought they would be allowed to. It doesn't bother me, but this may cause some people to tune out. Not the majority it seems because it has already been picked up for a second season and it is most watched debut show ever on FX.Time flies watching American Horror Story. It is the only show I can think of that ends way before you expect it to. I always hit the info button thinking I've watched half of the show tops and it reads 58 minutes.

Nemes ""kismetshortstep""","[2, 11]","The first episode was compelling, and I found myself wanting to watch another episode after each one ended as the story became more and more multi-layered. The problem was that this turned into a Columbine revenge wish-fulfillment fantasy very quickly, and I am glad that, from reading the reviews, I am not the only one who noticed this and found it inappropriate on several levels.  As it nears the end of the season, it changes from being fascinating and labyrinthine to being outright ludicrous, with the final episode becoming downright wacky and embarrassing and feels like a strangely compelling horror drama has suddenly and inexplicably become a rather bizarre and absurd comedy. My apologies to whoever is reviewing the reviews, but I don't want to give details for fear of spoiling, not that there is much to spoil.Funny thing was that it was the weirdness of the story that kept me watching at first and kept me clicking on the next one and the next one, and not the main characters who I found remarkably unappealing (especially the father, Ben, who struck me as a sub-par psychiatrist with an attitude towards his patients that seemed more fitting of a disinterested minimum wage fast-food worker and not someone who is trying to gain the trust of suffering people--he seems to hold them in active contempt, the reason for which becomes apparent at the end, where you get the ""moral"" of the story, and I find it amazing that I am expected to like this character and regard him as a hero).  I got a kick out of the daughter, Violet, but mostly because of the actress's hilariously snarky way of delivering lines and not so much out of the character herself.I'm not too interested in reading about or watching anyone's Mary Sue wish-fulfillment fantasy to begin with, but revenge fantasies are even worse. We all have our wish-fulfillment fantasies, but it's bad form to write them out and inflict them on the world at large.  I gave it two stars instead of one only because the initial handful of episodes were interesting enough to keep me watching, but since it went downhill into a personal revenge fantasy very quickly, I can't honestly give it anything better.  If you don't mind revenge fantasies, you'll love this because it is genuinely weird and labyrinthine in terms of general plot.  I might watch season 2 since it seems to involve an entirely new situation and characters, and I really hope it will be as fascinating as this series, but without the puerile revenge fantasy to ruin it.EDIT:  I have changed the stars from 2 to 1, based on this excellent review by another Amazon reviewer: http://www.amazon.com/review/R877GIEVOOTLJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B005LAJ1O0&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=.  I have to admit that this person has zeroed in on some of the things that have been grating me without me being able to put my finger on them, and a lot of the seemingly compelling and labyrinthine elements of the series are simply a trick of the way they decided to present a mashup of some remarkably unoriginal ideas as an original series.",1,"Fascinating and compelling at first, it becomes wholly inappropriate",1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,3070,"['first', 'episode', 'was', 'compelling', 'found', 'wanting', 'watch', 'episode', 'one', 'ended', 'story', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'multi-layered', 'problem', 'was', 'turned', 'Columbine', 'revenge', 'wish-fulfillment', 'fantasy', 'very', 'quickly', 'am', 'glad', 'reading', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'found', 'inappropriate', 'several', 'levels', 'end', 'season', 'being', 'fascinating', 'labyrinthine', 'being', 'outright', 'ludicrous', 'final', 'episode', 'becoming', 'downright', 'wacky', 'embarrassing', 'feels', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'horror', 'drama', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'become', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'absurd', 'comedy', 'apologies', 'whoever', 'reviewing', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'details', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'not', 'much', 'spoil.Funny', 'thing', 'was', 'was', 'weirdness', 'story', 'kept', 'watching', 'first', 'kept', 'clicking', 'next', 'one', 'next', 'one', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'found', 'remarkably', 'unappealing', 'especially', 'father', 'Ben', 'who', 'struck', 'sub-par', 'psychiatrist', 'attitude', 'patients', 'seemed', 'more', 'fitting', 'disinterested', 'minimum', 'wage', 'fast-food', 'worker', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'trying', 'gain', 'trust', 'suffering', 'people', 'hold', 'active', 'contempt', 'reason', 'apparent', 'end', 'where', 'get', 'moral', 'story', 'find', 'amazing', 'am', 'expected', 'like', 'character', 'regard', 'hero', 'got', 'kick', 'daughter', 'Violet', 'mostly', 'actress', 'hilariously', 'snarky', 'way', 'delivering', 'lines', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'herself.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'interested', 'reading', 'watching', 'anyone', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'wish-fulfillment', 'fantasy', 'begin', 'revenge', 'fantasies', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'have', 'wish-fulfillment', 'fantasies', 'bad', 'form', 'write', 'out', 'inflict', 'world', 'large', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'only', 'initial', 'handful', 'episodes', 'were', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'went', 'downhill', 'personal', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'very', 'quickly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'give', 'anything', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'revenge', 'fantasies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'genuinely', 'weird', 'labyrinthine', 'terms', 'general', 'plot', 'might', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'involve', 'entirely', 'new', 'situation', 'characters', 'really', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'fascinating', 'series', 'puerile', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'ruin', 'it.EDIT', 'have', 'changed', 'stars', '2', '1', 'based', 'excellent', 'review', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/review/R877GIEVOOTLJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm', 'ie=UTF8', 'ASIN', '=B005LAJ1O0', 'linkCode', '=', 'nodeID', '=', 'tag', '=', 'have', 'admit', 'person', 'zeroed', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'grating', 'being', 'able', 'put', 'finger', 'lot', 'seemingly', 'compelling', 'labyrinthine', 'elements', 'series', 'are', 'simply', 'trick', 'way', 'decided', 'present', 'mashup', 'remarkably', 'unoriginal', 'ideas', 'original', 'series']",N/A

1492667,A1X3R8V8KKWWGJ,B005LAJ1O0,Raeden Zen,"[1, 1]","Note that this review contains minor spoilers.American Horror Story takes a cliched theme, a haunted house, and completely flips it on its head.The acting is superb, especially Connie Britton. She of Friday Night Lights fame was a big reason why I decided to give this series a shot. And she didn't disappoint. Neither did any of the other actors. And if they had, this series would have fallen flat on its back.It has an intriguing beginning set in the past that grips you immediately as two young boys walk in a house, and a young girl, clearly mentally challenged, tells them they will die if they walk inside. Then it shifts to the present with a woman (Britton) who catches her cheating husband in the act. They move to California for a fresh start, as a way to repair what seems like a broken marriage; he cheated on her because she couldn't be intimate after a miscarriage. I believe the average viewer will consider the husband both a vile and sympathetic character, especially as the season progresses. His torment grows over time, exacerbated by the emergence of a house guest, who appears an aging, wrinkled mess to women, but as a sexy fantasy-completing maid to men.As the season progresses the questions that arise from the first several episodes are slowly fleshed out, almost as they would be in a good novel, in the form of a slow burn that makes you want to run every episode on loop. By the mid-point of the season I had called one of the punchlines, but I really had no idea how it was going to end. I had a hunch, and part of that theory panned out, but this series will keep you on the edge of your seat.It's less gore and more psychological thriller; Rosemary's Baby crossed with the House on Haunted Hill and the Sixth Sense, it's a series that will surely give you nightmares, and stick with you many days after you've finished.The bottom line: if paranormal thrillers are your thing, mixed in with some soap opera-ish drama, this series is worth exploring.-Raeden Zen",5,"A Different, Engrossing, Twisted, Addictive Horror Series",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1993,"['Note', 'review', 'minor', 'spoilers.American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'cliched', 'theme', 'haunted', 'house', 'completely', 'head.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'fame', 'was', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'series', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'did', 'other', 'actors', 'had', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'back.It', 'intriguing', 'beginning', 'set', 'past', 'immediately', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'walk', 'house', 'young', 'girl', 'clearly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'will', 'die', 'walk', 'inside', 'Then', 'present', 'woman', 'Britton', 'who', 'cheating', 'husband', 'act', 'move', 'California', 'fresh', 'start', 'way', 'repair', 'what', 'broken', 'marriage', 'cheated', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'intimate', 'miscarriage', 'believe', 'average', 'viewer', 'will', 'consider', 'husband', 'vile', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'especially', 'season', 'torment', 'time', 'exacerbated', 'emergence', 'house', 'guest', 'who', 'aging', 'wrinkled', 'mess', 'women', 'sexy', 'fantasy-completing', 'maid', 'men.As', 'season', 'questions', 'arise', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'slowly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'almost', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'novel', 'form', 'slow', 'burn', 'want', 'run', 'episode', 'loop', 'mid-point', 'season', 'had', 'called', 'one', 'punchlines', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'had', 'hunch', 'part', 'theory', 'panned', 'out', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat.It', 'less', 'gore', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'crossed', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'series', 'will', 'surely', 'give', 'nightmares', 'stick', 'many', 'days', ""'ve"", 'finished.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'paranormal', 'thrillers', 'are', 'thing', 'mixed', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'drama', 'series', 'worth', 'exploring.-Raeden', 'Zen']",N/A

Craig Zahler,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***American Horror works acceptably (until the end) because it keeps so many things in motion--- plots and timelines and things that go bump in the night. Sort of like Heroes (also a 2)-- and no scarier-- the show relentlessly churns and twists to surprising reveal after surprising reveal all delivered with maximum pathos, though a fair share of the performances are good. There is never once a scary moment--- quick cuts and lots of goofy canted shots pretty much guarantee there is never any atmosphere, unless you think music videos are atmospheric. The heavy handed music choices don't help, excepting the cool whistling bit and the piece that sounds stolen from Wojciech Kilar's superb score for (the otherwise crappy) Coppola-directed Dracula (I don't like to put Bram Stoker's name at the front of that one.)So AHS functions as a fast moving and surprising soap opera with a big budget, some good make up fx and some decent acting, which is why it gets a 2. Actually had the last double length episode not been the series nadir--- really bad dialogue and spacious melodrama that fails utterly--- the show would be slightly north of mediocre, but 'afterbirth' is pretty stinky, and the penultimate episode 'birth' not much better.Like most Stephen King stuff that I don't like*, it is essentially modern day fantasy with too much explanation of everything so it barely even functions as suspense, much less horror. Ghosts as lead characters who can appear and disappear at will puts this in a camp with things like Ghost (yes, the Swayze one) and Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. If you think Ghost and Blithe Spirit are horror, then American Horror Story is horror, but I don't (and you shouldn't) even if AHS has occasional gore and burn make up.Overall, American Horror Story is a mildly engaging soap with better than average acting for a soap and a lot more blood than the average soap, but actually less creepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon.",2,If R Kelly and M.

1492713,A3PZ0H4BMZOFRT,B005LAJ1O0,ShowBizBuff,"[3, 4]","Well into season two now, I wanted to go back and write a review of the first season of one of my favorite television series - especially as season two makes the first season look like ""Mary Poppins"" by comparison!After reading reviews here, I've realized that those who don't like the show tend to really HATE the show - often with nasty/insulting remarks about everything from the writing to the acting to Dylan McDermott's nude behind.  Am sort of wondering if this venom is because the show isn't mindless or gory enough; American fans of horror tend to like butchers and blood, I have a good friend myself who usually defines a ""good"" horror film by the body count.  The more people who die, and the more gruesome their deaths, the better the film.If that's you, you WILL probably hate ""American Horror Story"".  The writing here is more subtle, and much more clever.  It's about creeping you out slowly, confusing scenes that come to light later on (sometimes even in another episode) - if you just keep with it and let your brain be engaged instead of your visceral lust for blood and bodies, you'll ""get"" what's going on and understand the storylines and characters so much better.  It's a show that gets under your skin instead of assaulting your senses (and WOW, does season two amp up things, on this scale, a hundred-fold!), and even though season one and season two are two completely different anthologies - with completely different characters (some played by a handful of the same actors from season one) and story and even time-frame - I do think you're cheating yourself a bit if you don't watch the first season before viewing the second (especially to see Jessica Lange's brilliance).The story's been gone over before: the Harmon family - Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (the brilliant and beautiful Connie Britton), and their teenage daughter Violet relocate from the east coast to Los Angeles, to start fresh after Ben and Vivien's marriage almost ended due to Ben's infidelity.  Ben got an incredible deal on a beautiful home, and only upon the Harmon's arrival do they learn it's because a death occurred in the home.  Well, more than one death.  In fact, a murder.  And suicide.  And more than one.In fact, their home is known as the Murder House due to its dark and macabre history - a history that starts reflecting itself immediately when we (the viewers) learn that the ghosts of those who've died violently in the home all remain there ... and can still have more than a little influence on the living.Jessica Lange MORE than deserved the awards gotten for playing next door neighbor Constance Langdon, a southern belle who is the only living person around who knows the true nature of the Harmon's home.  She has a basket-case of a son named Tate (Evan Peters, fast becoming one of the best actors of his generation working today), and a sweet-natured daughter named Addie (Jamie Brewer), a young girl with Down's Syndrome whose condition allows her to see the ghosts who walk the Harmons home when others cannot.All figure into the a slowly developing plotline that I won't divulge here - but this is, again, one series you cannot only half-watch!  NOT a show where you can get up and make dinner in between, and certainly please pause it if you have to use the john!  No, ""American Horror Story"" takes some thought to keep up with what's going on - and to get the meaning of some things that at first may seem meaningless.  It's smart, wicked, bizzare and very adult television (much like ""Nip/Tuck"", by the same creators) with a dark sense of humor ... that also becomes horribly addicting.And for gore-lovers ... don't worry, you got that coming in season two.",5,"Innovative, refreshing, and more than a little creepy",1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,3692,"['Well', 'season', 'two', 'now', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'write', 'review', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'series', 'especially', 'season', 'two', 'first', 'season', 'look', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'comparison', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'realized', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'tend', 'really', 'HATE', 'show', 'often', 'nasty/insulting', 'remarks', 'everything', 'writing', 'acting', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'nude', 'Am', 'sort', 'wondering', 'venom', 'show', ""n't"", 'mindless', 'gory', 'enough', 'American', 'fans', 'horror', 'tend', 'like', 'butchers', 'blood', 'have', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'usually', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'body', 'count', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'die', 'more', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'better', 'film.If', 'WILL', 'probably', 'hate', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'writing', 'here', 'more', 'subtle', 'much', 'more', 'clever', 'creeping', 'slowly', 'confusing', 'scenes', 'come', 'light', 'later', 'sometimes', 'even', 'episode', 'just', 'keep', 'let', 'brain', 'be', 'engaged', 'instead', 'visceral', 'lust', 'blood', 'bodies', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'going', 'understand', 'storylines', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'skin', 'instead', 'assaulting', 'senses', 'WOW', 'season', 'two', 'amp', 'things', 'scale', 'hundred-fold', 'even', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'anthologies', 'completely', 'different', 'characters', 'played', 'handful', 'same', 'actors', 'season', 'one', 'story', 'even', 'time-frame', 'do', 'think', ""'re"", 'cheating', 'bit', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'viewing', 'second', 'especially', 'see', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'brilliance', 'story', 'been', 'gone', 'Harmon', 'family', 'Ben', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Vivien', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Violet', 'relocate', 'east', 'coast', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'start', 'fresh', 'Ben', 'Vivien', 'marriage', 'almost', 'ended', 'due', 'Ben', 'infidelity', 'Ben', 'got', 'incredible', 'deal', 'beautiful', 'home', 'only', 'Harmon', 'arrival', 'do', 'learn', 'death', 'occurred', 'home', 'Well', 'more', 'one', 'death', 'fact', 'murder', 'suicide', 'more', 'one.In', 'fact', 'home', 'known', 'Murder', 'House', 'due', 'dark', 'macabre', 'history', 'history', 'reflecting', 'immediately', 'when', 'viewers', 'learn', 'ghosts', 'who', ""'ve"", 'died', 'violently', 'home', 'remain', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'more', 'little', 'influence', 'living.Jessica', 'Lange', 'MORE', 'deserved', 'awards', 'gotten', 'playing', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Constance', 'Langdon', 'southern', 'belle', 'who', 'only', 'living', 'person', 'who', 'true', 'nature', 'Harmon', 'home', 'basket-case', 'son', 'named', 'Tate', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'working', 'today', 'sweet-natured', 'daughter', 'named', 'Addie', 'Jamie', 'Brewer', 'young', 'girl', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'condition', 'see', 'ghosts', 'who', 'walk', 'Harmons', 'home', 'when', 'others', 'can', 'not', '.All', 'figure', 'slowly', 'developing', 'plotline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'here', 'again', 'one', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'half-watch', 'show', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'up', 'make', 'dinner', 'certainly', 'please', 'pause', 'have', 'use', 'john', 'No', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'thought', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'meaning', 'things', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'meaningless', 'smart', 'wicked', 'bizzare', 'very', 'adult', 'television', 'much', 'Nip/Tuck', 'same', 'creators', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'horribly', 'addicting.And', 'gore-lovers', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'got', 'coming', 'season', 'two']",N/A

1492739,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B005LAJ1O0,The Wingchair Critic,"[2, 4]","'American Horror Story' (2011) is an innovative series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for FX, and one which further evolves the post-modern television thriller, a process which began with David Lynch's influential 'Twin Peaks' (1990-1991) and continued with Chris Carter's more commercially successful 'The X-Files' (1993-2002).Murphy and Falchuk clearly intend 'American Horror Story' to be as visually and narratively extreme as a program can possibly be for the current market, and so it comes as no surprise that the show does not air on the Fox channel itself.The plot has Ben (Dylan McDermott) and Vivienne (Connie Britton) Harmon and their teenage daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) moving from Boston to Los Angeles after Ben is caught in an adulterous affair with a young woman. The family buys a sprawling old mansion built in the 1920s, and Ben, a psychiatrist, sets about reestablishing his practice.Almost immediately, bizarre events begin to take place in and around the house. The Harmons also discover that their next door neighbor, Constance (Jessica Lange), is an intrusive, insistent, and increasingly threatening presence in their lives.Since Vivienne no longer trusts Ben, the couple finds coping with their impossible experiences difficult and isolating, while Violet, who is bullied at her new school, secretly begins a relationship with young Tate (Evan Peters), one of her father's troubled patients.'American Horror Story' certainly has an overall style of its own, and it becomes almost immediately clear to the viewer that the creators intend to heap an absolute maximum  superabundance of 'paranormal' events on the Harmons and on the audience. The Val Lewton-Jacques Tourneur ""less is more"" style of horror, seen in such classics as 'Cat People' (1941) and 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), is clearly not a style admired by Murphy and Falchuk.While the dominant 'supernatural' presence is a male figure in a zippered, head-to-toe black rubber body suit, there are also a pair of twin boys who have been murdered, a hideous dwarfish monster in the basement, a succubus of a housemaid who appears elderly to Vivienne but young and attractive to Ben, a pair of dead nurses, a 'mad doctor' and his anguished wife, the ghosts of two male homosexuals who believe the mansion still belongs to them, a horribly-scarred man who claims to have killed his own family, the spirit of Elizabeth Short, and others.And why is Vivienne's new pregnancy causing such alarm?'American Horror Story' offers not '13 Ghosts,' but seemingly 113 or more.As a result of this barrage of what are essentially old-fashioned monsters in newfangled  dress, 'American Horror Story,' while remaining interesting, becomes increasingly less suspenseful with each episode; the sense of objective reality is increasingly diminished, making it less and less possible to believe that Ben, Vivienne, and Violet are actually alive and existing in an ostensible 'real world' shared with the audience.While many previous films (of some ninety minutes or thereabouts) have utilized such a veiled technique to great effect, here, viewers of 'American Horror Story,' which is some five hundred minutes in length, are likely to simply stop caring whether the proceedings are actual, illusory, supernatural, or some combination of these. As in 'Lost' (2004-2010), answers to mysteries are often either too long in coming, only partial when finally revealed, or simply not addressed at all. It's an exhausting process.Viewers will easily recognize homages and references to older horror films throughout the series, from Whale's 'The Old Dark House' (1932), Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968), Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (1973), Curtis' 'Burnt Offerings' (1976) Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980) and Fulci's 'The House By the Cemetery' (1981) to Argento's 'Phenomena' (1985) and Amenabar's 'The Others' (2001), as well as the marked influence of David Lynch, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Nancy Grossman. &#8232;To their credit, Murphy and Falchuk (here and in season two, 'American Horror Story: Asylum,' 2012, which begins an entirely new narrative) actually root the source of their horrors in actualities like Nazism and all it entailed, necrophilia, genetic deformity, psychosis, serial murder, disfiguring scars, sadomasochism, limb amputation, self-mutilation, sexual pathology and perversion, abortion (dead babies, the severed limbs of children, and deformed offspring are everywhere in 'American Horror Story'), Draconian laws, personal betrayal and other fear-inducing elements of life; it is these  'actualities,' possible in everyone's life, that give the show its weird, gruesome, and often unpleasant power.Boris Karloff once said that he preferred 'terror films' to 'horror films,' as the latter were, in his opinion, largely designed to disgust and revolt rather than frighten. Karloff, then, wouldn't have appreciated 'American Horror Story,' which, in addition to bald sexuality, straddles both 'terror' and 'horror' and pushes the proverbial envelope to its absolute currently-accepted limit.",3,A Postmodern Monster Rally in Black Rubber,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,5089,"[""'American"", 'Horror', 'Story', '2011', 'innovative', 'series', 'created', 'Ryan',

1492742,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005LAJ1O0,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","American Horror Story is one of the hottest shows on television, but it's origins may surprise you. This innovate, unique drama, has similarities to several different shows, but most closely resembles Tales From The Crypt. Unlike Tales, the American horror stories each last one season instead of one episode. From season to season the story changes as does much of the cast, but one thing remains constant, it has some of the smartest and most daring people behind it. You may know the creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, as the guys who brought you Glee, but American Horror Story couldn't be more different. In this series they show a dark twisted side that they could never get away with on network television. As I said the story changes from season to season, so I can't really do a review of the series, but I can tell you about season one. The first season of American Horror Story introduces us to Los Angeles's famous murder house, which since it's creation, ninety years ago, has known nothing but death and heartache. The house is purchased by Dr. Ben Harmon, who knows nothing of the houses history. Dr. Harmon is moving his family across the country to give them a second chance after mistakes and personal tragedies. The story is gripping and easy to follow, but what I liked more were the flashbacks that told the history of the house and explain all the weird stuff that's happening. While the cast features some very experienced, award winning actors, it's a combination of Jessica Lange and Evan Peters who makes this show what it is. Lange is a veteran actress known more for her roles on the big screen, while Peters only just made an impression on me a couple of years ago in the film Clipping Adam. Their unique yet different styles and personalities are the reason this weird show works. In the same way they are able to connect with every character in the show, they are also able to connect with every member of the audience, and that's why they are two of the three cast members who are back for the new story, Asylum. American Horror Story is not like any other show you've seen on television, in fact, I'm pretty surprised they are able to get away with some of the stuff they are doing. It's hard to find a good TV show based on the Horror genre and when you do it's usually a lame comedy. Shows like the Munsters and the Addams Family are legendary, while shows like Harsh Realm and Freaky Links just fizzled out. American Horror Story is different though, as it's innovative and pushes the limits of what you can do on television. It's a show that is most definitely not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the unusual and tired of things like Twilight and The Walking Dead, that go absolutely nowhere, check out American Horror Story, you should be pleasantly surprised.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2807,"['American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'one', 'hottest', 'shows', 'television', 'origins', 'may', 'surprise', 'innovate', 'unique', 'drama', 'similarities', 'several', 'different', 'shows', 'most', 'closely', 'resembles', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Tales', 'American', 'horror', 'stories', 'last', 'one', 'season', 'instead', 'one', 'episode', 'season', 'season', 'story', 'changes', 'much', 'cast', 'one', 'thing', 'constant', 'smartest', 'most', 'daring', 'people', 'may', 'know', 'creators', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'Brad', 'Falchuk', 'guys', 'who', 'brought', 'Glee', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'series', 'show', 'dark', 'twisted', 'side', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'network', 'television', 'said', 'story', 'changes', 'season', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'review', 'series', 'can', 'tell', 'season', 'one', 'first', 'season', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'famous', 'murder', 'house', 'creation', 'ninety', 'years', 'ago', 'known', 'nothing', 'death', 'heartache', 'house', 'purchased', 'Dr.', 'Ben', 'Harmon', 'who', 'nothing', 'houses', 'history', 'Dr.', 'Harmon', 'moving', 'family', 'country', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'mistakes', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'story', 'gripping', 'easy', 'follow', 'what', 'liked', 'more', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'told', 'history', 'house', 'explain', 'weird', 'stuff', 'happening', 'cast', 'very', 'experienced', 'award', 'winning', 'actors', 'combination', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'who', 'show', 'what', 'Lange', 'veteran', 'actress', 'known', 'more', 'roles', 'big', 'screen', 'Peters', 'only', 'just', 'made', 'impression', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'Clipping', 'Adam', 'unique', 'yet', 'different', 'styles', 'personalities', 'are', 'reason', 'weird', 'show', 'same', 'way', 'are', 'able', 'connect', 'character', 'show', 'are', 'also', 'able', 'connect', 'member', 'audience', 'why', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'new', 'story', 'Asylum', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'not', 'other', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'fact', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'surprised', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'stuff', 'are', 'doing', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'TV', 'show', 'based', 'Horror', 'genre', 'when', 'do', 'usually', 'lame', 'comedy', 'Shows', 'Munsters', 'Addams', 'Family', 'are', 'legendary', 'shows', 'Harsh', 'Realm', 'Freaky', 'Links', 'just', 'fizzled', 'out', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'different', 'though', 'innovative', 'limits', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'television', 'show', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'fan', 'unusual', 'tired', 'things', 'Twilight', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'go', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'check', 'out', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'should', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",N/A

I was just expecting a typical haunted house story where a family moves into a house previously populated by many deaths.  It was quickly apparent though that this series goes way beyond that, entering into quirky, odd, bizarre territory.  All of the characters in AHS are exactly that, characters; each with a unique trait many people may be able to identify with, but seeing so many oddball characters gives AHS a certain charm.Connie Britton's character may be the only one who seems to have normal reactions to the goings on.  But before long, even her sanity seems to crumble under the weight of the house's sadistic past.  This show really puts its characters through the emotional ringer, and many times it's difficult to feel sorry for them, but the longer the show goes on, the more understandable the characters' actions become.Ah, and it does have some effective horror in it too, although the show's opening scene complete with a score from Saw composer Charlie Clouser hints at more horror than the show typically delivers.  Instead much of the drama plays out like an episode of Desperate Housewives, but more effectively, and the ghosts enter the picture to sabotage the family's lives every now and then.  The best moments of the show for me were the flashbacks, especially those involving Charles the surgeon and his nagging wife.There's great build up to the big events in the show, as well as some fantastic plot twists I never saw coming.  With such interesting plot devices and increasing drama, it's near impossible not to keep watching to see what happens next.  Thanks so much to Amazon for offering this show free to Prime members.

Plus, this show perpetuates assumptions that tell psychos (psychoanalysts), to blame you for your resulting behavior to enslave us all SO this show infects everyone. The best way to control anyone is too make them think they control their behavior:) You have a problem it is up to you to you to fix it, take some personal responsibility (LOL). Actually solving unhealthy behavior involves re-arranging the contingencies of reinforcement to reinforce healthy behavior, but that would take too much time, too many resources, and continuous adaption SO don&#8217;t tell anyone the truth and keep reinforcing shows like American Horror Story that spew propaganda endlessly. Yes, doing what works is documented in The Reluctant Alliance: Behaviorism And Humanism, but that is too difficult SO don&#8217;t tell anyone, let them keep watching shows like American Horror Story that make ignorance much easier and fun, we can be entertained while we do what fails (LOL).  It is also much easier to tell others to take responsibility and never take any responsibility SO American Horror Story continues shoving lies down our throats ad infinitum, it is easy and fun AND wins on every front.  Much more effective then telling you the facts. No problem ever gets solved, but the psychos get paid a ton to listen and you get to talk of taboo subjects in this culture and feel much better for an hour.  How great.  They don't have to do a thing, they put all the lies/ illusions on you.  You get to feel like you are solving problems, but actually you just schedule endless appointments and the vicious cycle never ends while shows like American Horror Story trumpet personal responsibility endlessly.  Yes, they do eventually criticize psychoanalysis, but still give it some credit while making sure they trumpet personal responsibility so this parasitic system always flourishes.  Everybody wins, we get to watch garbage entertainment like this show endlessly (LOL) AND psychoanalysis never dies!!!

I am not impressed with metal boxes.The series match the quality that was put into the blu ray production.It's scary without going for any cheap thrills. The acting is good. The photography is top-notch (though sometimes I did not understand why some scenes were shot, slanted, without any relation to the scene).Sex ? Well, there are no nude scenes (there are more nude scenes in one episode of Girls than in this entire season). And the sex scenes (only a few) are not tawdry. Hey, this is an adult movie.There are some inconsistencies though. Probably, because they have bought in several directors. But, that is indeed, the good part. Because, you do not feel like watching redundant episodes. Each episode has its character.No unnecessary product placements (a short mention of Nescaf&eacute;, though).  No ridiculous heavy-drinking or chain smoking scenes like in Mad Men.  There are some scenes where one of the gay couple is seen drinking white wine.Ugh. I don't know from where they picked up that.One of those TV series that you watch the whole season in a weekend. It is so addictive.

1492776,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B005LAJ1O0,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I love any well-made horror movie or series, and love American Horror Story (Season One just ended). It is a well-made, layered horror story centering on a dysfunctional family - Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), Vivien Harmon (Connie Britten), and teen daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga, wonder is she is related to Vera Farmiga?). Ben is a psychiatrist who is in the doghouse because Vivien discovered him having an affair with his student. Vivien is also suffering mental anguish over her recent miscarriage. The couple try to put things right by moving from Boston to LA, where they buy a restored Gothic mansion. Daughter Violet is a taciturn teen who resents her parents for putting her through this, and has a hard time at her new school.Little does the Harmon family realize that their home is horribly haunted. Yes, 'horribly' because it is not merely one or two otherworldly entities that inhabit this house, but a whole plethora of lost, unhappy, wandering souls that are somehow trapped within the confines of the malevolent house. The Harmon's next-door neighbor Constance (played to wicked perfection by Jessica Lange, in an award-worthy performance) appears to think she has the right to come and go as she pleases, which annoys Vivien no end, yet Constance also seems to know the true nature of the house. Then there's the mysterious housekeeper who talks herself into a position with the Harmons, and depending on one's point of view, can appear as a sexy, young nymphomaniac or a disfigured middle-aged housekeeper! There is nudity and sex scenes in this show, as well as graphic violence.As the episodes progress, viewers will be kept at the edge of their seats trying to figure out which character is really alive, and which character is merely a ghost. The other interesting aspect is working out the motives of the various entities. There are many supernatural entities in this show, and it could have been a real mess trying to make everything flow and connect. Fortunately, the writers and producers of this show have done a remarkable job of connecting everything together in a credible way (well, to the extent that this is possible in a supernatural-themed show).There are a lot of flashbacks to the past to show the history of the various occupants of the house, which is really important in helping viewers place the characters and their stories, and how the Harmons tie in with all of this.The story is creepy but the chills come more from watching the Harmon family slowly but surely crumble as a family unit, and of how their lives are irrevocably changed as a result of living in the house. The house is the main star of the show, it is like a huge forcefield that attracts and imprisons its occupants, with the trapped souls not ever having a chance at escaping. Having watched the season finale, I can't help but wonder how the producers are going to keep the storyline fresh and interesting, as the house becomes even more cluttered with trapped souls. I highly recommend this show for fans of ghost stories, haunted houses, and a well-executed horror drama.",5,A layered horror show that keeps one guessing!,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3088,"['love', 'well-made', 'horror', 'movie', 'series', 'love', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Season', 'One', 'just', 'ended', 'well-made', 'layered', 'horror', 'story', 'centering', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Ben', 'Harmon', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Vivien', 'Harmon', 'Connie', 'Britten', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Violet', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'wonder', 'related', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Ben', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'doghouse', 'Vivien', 'discovered', 'having', 'affair', 'student', 'Vivien', 'also', 'suffering', 'mental', 'anguish', 'recent', 'miscarriage', 'couple', 'try', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'moving', 'Boston', 'LA', 'where', 'buy', 'restored', 'Gothic', 'mansion', 'Daughter', 'Violet', 'taciturn', 'teen', 'who', 'parents', 'putting', 'hard', 'time', 'new', 'school.Little', 'Harmon', 'family', 'realize', 'home', 'horribly', 'haunted', 'Yes', ""'horribly"", 'not', 'merely', 'one', 'two', 'otherworldly', 'entities', 'inhabit', 'house', 'whole', 'plethora', 'lost', 'unhappy', 'wandering', 'souls', 'are', 'somehow', 'trapped', 'confines', 'malevolent', 'house', 'Harmon', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Constance', 'played', 'wicked', 'perfection', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'award-worthy', 'performance', 'think', 'right', 'come', 'go', 'Vivien', 'end', 'Constance', 'also', 'know', 'true', 'nature', 'house', 'Then', 'mysterious', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'position', 'Harmons', 'depending', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'can', 'appear', 'sexy', 'young', 'nymphomaniac', 'disfigured', 'middle-aged', 'housekeeper', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'graphic', 'episodes', 'progress', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'edge', 'seats', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'character', 'really', 'alive', 'character', 'merely', 'ghost', 'other', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'working', 'out', 'motives', 'various', 'entities', 'are', 'many', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'mess', 'trying', 'make', 'everything', 'flow', 'connect', 'Fortunately', 'writers', 'producers', 'show', 'have', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'connecting', 'everything', 'together', 'credible', 'way', 'well', 'extent', 'possible', 'supernatural-themed', 'show', 'are', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'show', 'history', 'various', 'occupants', 'house', 'really', 'important', 'helping', 'viewers', 'place', 'characters', 'stories', 'how', 'Harmons', 'tie', 'this.The', 'story', 'creepy', 'chills', 'come', 'more', 'watching', 'Harmon', 'family', 'slowly', 'surely', 'crumble', 'family', 'unit', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'result', 'living', 'house', 'house', 'main', 'star', 'show', 'huge', 'forcefield', 'occupants', 'trapped', 'souls', 'not', 'ever', 'having', 'chance', 'escaping', 'Having', 'watched', 'season', 'finale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'producers', 'are', 'going', 'keep', 'storyline', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'house', 'even', 'more', 'cluttered', 'trapped', 'souls', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'fans', 'ghost', 'stories', 'haunted', 'houses', 'well-executed', 'horror', 'drama']",N/A
