418463,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,6304391854,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[6, 6]","In 1952 Kenji Mizoguchi released Life of Oharu one of his most personal films. The film based on  the Ihara novel The Woman Who Loved Love, is also one of the great director's greatest achievements. With its formal style and long tracking shots the film takes some getting used to before being fully appreciated by Western audiences of today. The film takes attention and patience to reveal its intricacies.Mizoguchi deftly examines the place of women in Japanese society in this film. In fact it was a theme that ran through much of his filmmaking from Osaka Elegy onward. Oharu, beautifully acted by Kinuyo Tanaka, moves in an ever downward spiral for the crime of falling in love with a person below her class. At the opening of the film she is forced to reflect on her life as she stares at statues in a Buddist temple. She began life as a lady in waiting at the Imperial Palace of Kyoto. A youthful indescretion with a court page, Katsunosuke ( Toshiro Mifune) leads to the exile of her entire family. She becomes the concubine of Lord Matsudaira (Toshiaki Konoe) but only for the purpose of bearing him a male heir. After giving birth she is sent away from the palace.  She becomes a maid and then as she ages finds short lived hapiness as the wife of a fan maker. His untimely death leads her into a life of prostitution in order to survive.The story is told with great dignity and never attempts to judge Oharu for her actions. Oharu is simply a  part of the society in which she lives.I viewed this film on the Homevision VHS tape and while not great the picture is adequate. The picture is slightly soft and does not truly do justice to either the material or to the cinematography of Yoshimi Hirano. The English subtitles are burned into the print in white but are quite readable. This is quite rare and welcome on a film of this age.The film, while somewhat hard to find, is well worth seeking out and is highly recommended.",4,Examination of Woman's Place In Japanese Society,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,1936,"['1952', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', 'released', 'Life', 'Oharu', 'one', 'most', 'personal', 'films', 'film', 'based', 'Ihara', 'novel', 'Woman', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Love', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'director', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'formal', 'style', 'long', 'tracking', 'shots', 'film', 'getting', 'used', 'being', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'Western', 'audiences', 'today', 'film', 'attention', 'patience', 'reveal', 'intricacies.Mizoguchi', 'deftly', 'place', 'women', 'Japanese', 'society', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'theme', 'ran', 'much', 'filmmaking', 'Osaka', 'Elegy', 'onward', 'Oharu', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Kinuyo', 'Tanaka', 'moves', 'ever', 'downward', 'spiral', 'crime', 'falling', 'love', 'person', 'class', 'opening', 'film', 'forced', 'reflect', 'life', 'statues', 'Buddist', 'temple', 'began', 'life', 'lady', 'waiting', 'Imperial', 'Palace', 'Kyoto', 'youthful', 'indescretion', 'court', 'page', 'Katsunosuke', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'exile', 'entire', 'family', 'concubine', 'Lord', 'Matsudaira', 'Toshiaki', 'Konoe', 'only', 'purpose', 'bearing', 'male', 'heir', 'giving', 'birth', 'sent', 'away', 'palace', 'maid', 'then', 'finds', 'short', 'lived', 'hapiness', 'wife', 'fan', 'maker', 'untimely', 'death', 'life', 'prostitution', 'order', 'survive.The', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'dignity', 'never', 'attempts', 'judge', 'Oharu', 'actions', 'Oharu', 'simply', 'part', 'society', 'lives.I', 'viewed', 'film', 'Homevision', 'VHS', 'tape', 'not', 'great', 'picture', 'adequate', 'picture', 'slightly', 'soft', 'not', 'truly', 'do', 'justice', 'material', 'cinematography', 'Yoshimi', 'Hirano', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'burned', 'print', 'white', 'are', 'quite', 'readable', 'quite', 'rare', 'welcome', 'film', 'age.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'find', 'well', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'highly', 'recommended']",Life of Oharu VHS
418464,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6304391854,Ernest Jagger,"[6, 6]","""The Life of Oharu,"" is not only a great film, but it is highly recommended. I am looking forward to seeing this film on DVD someday, but in the meantime my VHS copy will have to do. I am not really surprised that some of the reviewers don't like this film: But I sure do. Kenji Mizoguchi is an acquired taste; and having seen many of his films, I think he was a very talented director. Too many people try to compare his films with Ozu, or Kurosawa, and this is not fair. They each had their own distinctive stamp on filmmaking. All of them were great Japanese directors. Moreover, his films deal with the role of women in Japanese society, and one can see this theme in ALL of his films.Furthermore, many try to compare this past master with contemporary times, and this is wrong. He had a message for his audience in his time, and this shows in his films: The role of women in Japanese society. And whether or not his films dealt with contemporary Japanese society, or feudal Japan, the message is still the same: The treatment of women in a male dominated society. Many refer to his works as feminist depictions on film, however, I look at his films as cinematic works of art. This film centers on the life of a woman named Oharu (Kinuyo Tanaka). The setting is 17th century Japan. During her younger days she was a lady in waiting at the Imperial  Palace. However, she falls in love with a man below her station, and as a result she and her family are expelled from the Palace and forced into exile.With her life now changed, she finds herself as a concubine. But life will deal even more harsh realities for her as she ages. Eventually she will become a prostitute. Oharu's fall from privelige to destitution and despair is one bleak portrait. And Mizoguchi shows [not tells] the viewer how this womans life has changed by the purely human act of being in love with a man whose only crime was being below her station. And the events in her life will spiral her further and further down into a life of despair. This is not a happy feel-good film. And those who have seen Kenji Mizoguchi's films know that this was not his style. The acting of Kenyuo Tanaka is terrific, and the film is a must have for those who admire great Japanese cinema. I highly recommend this film!
