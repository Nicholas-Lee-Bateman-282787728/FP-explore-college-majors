You can tell that everybody expected this to be the last season, it ends with Laura in Remington's apartment. Only it's empty, like season one and two. There's plenty of action, actually. Season three Mildred Krebbs gets to do more in this season, they were trying to get around and really show off Los. Angeles. Now they had introduced a character earlier, Major Descoine, I found it to be a shame that they never gave him more than two episodes, because he really stole the show. As I've said before, a great season. The chemistry is there, and some more of Remington's past is brought to light.

Laura is always the one who finally solves the crime, which as the only official private eye she should, but Steele offers class and mystery himself as well as expertise as a successful cat burglar. This is Pierce Brosnan before fame and Bond, and it proves that he is worthy of following in Cary Grant's footsteps as both a romantic lead and a competent comedic actor.

969656,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000E6ESC6,Bobby Underwood,"[32, 32]","Mystery and film lovers were delighted when Remington Steele returned for a third season. This stylish show filled the void for those fond of the light mystery and romance Stanley Donen had brought to the big screen. Season three was fun in the extreme, offering lovers of sophistated television all the fun they could handle.Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were back in September of 1984 and so was the opening theme by Henry Mancini. The season opened with a bang on the French Riviera and before the season concluded the attractive stars would become involved in cases that would take them from Ireland to the Island of Malta.Steele's references to classic films reached new heights when three huge stars from Hollywood's golden age appeared in ""Cast in Steele."" There was an episode  where Laura had to travel to Ireland to help Steele recover his memory, and another which took place at a baseball camp. ""Steele in the Chips"" was a wildly fun episode involving the formula for a no-calorie chocolate chip cookie.Guest stars like Lloyd Nolan, Geena Davis, Jean Smart, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Lamour, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Stephanie's dad), and Michael Constantine, who appeared in two episodes, added flair to an already great show fans had grown to love.""Remington Steele"" was never about the guest stars, however, but rather Steele and Laura themselves. Brosnan was terrific as the debonair man of mystery with a somewhat shady past and Stephanie Zimbalist was truly wonderful as the founder of the detective agency that couldn't get off the ground until she invented Remington Steele. The anticipation of their romance kept viewers coming back each week just as much as the mysteries.Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. One could say they were our generations Nick and Nora Charles. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura.Here are the cleverly titled episodes from season three: STEELE AT IT - LOFTY STEELE - MALTESE STEELE - SECOND BASE STEELE - BLUE BLOODED STEELE - STEELE YOUR HEART AWAY - A POCKETFUL OF STEELE - PUZZLED STEELE - CAST OF STEELE - BREATH OF STEELE - LET'S STEELE A PLOT - GOURMET STEELE - STRONGER THAN STEELE - HAVE I GOT A STEELE FOR YOU - SPRINGTIME FOR STEELE - STEELE IN THE FAMILY - DICED STEELE - NOW YOU STEELE IT, NOW YOU DON'T - ILLUSTRATED STEELE - STEELE IN THE CHIPS - STEELE TRYING - STEELE OF APPROVALThere are only a handful of shows in the history of television so beloved by fans. ""Remington Steele"" was a reminder to us all just how enjoyable and entertaining it can be.

969660,A1B219JKB6J3FU,B000E6ESC6,Carrie G. Koens,"[5, 5]","SEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots.  All around a great opening season for a classic show.SEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments.  The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.SEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons.  It's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting.  The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.  Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual ""Gumshoe"".  It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons.The good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them.  I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I've seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4 & 5), even though I have not yet watched them (I'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).One MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc.  One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax.  It's too bad that they don't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD's for years of non-skipping enjoyment.

969667,A1JWSDDIH5Z7DV,B000E6ESC6,D. R. Schryer,"[7, 7]","I thoroughly agree with the many reviewers who have praised this release and Remington Steele in general. I've been watching TV from its early days in the 1950s through the present and am convinced that Remington Steele was as good as general audience TV gets. No its not Shakespeare, but I don't think that most of us who watch TV really want weekly doses of Shakespeare. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and third seasons (as well as later seasons not yet available on DVD) even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season.

This smart, funny detective series was one of the last of its kind, wonderfully odd and full of sometimes all-too-realistic crimes to be solved, and this season solidifies its tight storytelling.During a trip to the Riviera, Laura (Stephanie Zimbalist) decides to go the distance with Steele (Pierce Brosnan) at last -- only to have him enmeshed in a web of blackmail, murder, and a precious dagger. Needless to say, that puts a damper on her romantic plans. Questions about his past crop up again when he turns up in Ireland, suffering from amnesia, after trying to discover his origins.But Steele's past isn't the only thing on these detectives' minds: a no-calorie cookie, a dead body that has to be kept hidden, restauranteurs trying to kill a savage critic, teenage pickpockets, baseball camps, obnoxious neighbors, Maltese treasure, and three aging movie stars ask for help in finding out who is trying to kill them.The comedy is still firmly in place: There are sinister plots centering on murder, embezzlement and Steele's attempt to redeem a teenage pickpocket, who reminds him of himself many years before. But woven in those is plenty of barbed humour, such as corporate bigwigs scrabbling on the floor for a fat-free cookie.Having gotten a solid formula in the second season, ""Remington Steele"" chugged along with more odd mysteries. Okay, few of these mysteries resemble real crimes (a comic strip inspires attacks on the cartoonist?), but they are often funny, witty and intelligent.We only get a few hints about Steele's past -- he may be from Ireland, but not much more than that. In one episode, Daniel Chalmers ropes Steele into an old scam, where Steele pretends to be the new Duke of Rutherford. Steele's reaction to this shows how far he's come, and how honest he's become over time.At the same time, Laura has become more sensitive to his murky past, and his attempts to overcome his criminal past. Sure, Zimbalist and Brosnan disliked each other in real life, but they had electric chemistry in many of these episodes. And Mildred (Doris Roberts) gradually becomes less of a maternal figure, and more of an equal to her younger cohorts.This season also has returning characters like Daniel Chalmers and Rocky Sullivan, and several new ones like Mulch, a bumbling entrepreneur who is always seeking the Big Moneymaker. Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Lamour and Lloyd Nolan also appear as themselves in one episode, and appear to be having lots of fun.The third season of ""Remington Steele"" is steele solid and entertaining, with more exploration of the mystery detective, and quite a bit more comedy.",5,Steele going!,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2715,"['debonair', 'ex-con-man', 'strait-laced', 'detective', 'return', 'third', 'season', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'smart', 'funny', 'detective', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'kind', 'wonderfully', 'odd', 'full', 'sometimes', 'all-too-realistic', 'crimes', 'be', 'solved', 'season', 'tight', 'storytelling.During', 'trip', 'Riviera', 'Laura', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'go', 'distance', 'Steele', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'last', 'only', 'have', 'enmeshed', 'web', 'blackmail', 'murder', 'precious', 'dagger', 'Needless', 'say', 'damper', 'romantic', 'plans', 'Questions', 'past', 'crop', 'up', 'again', 'when', 'up', 'Ireland', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'trying', 'discover', 'origins.But', 'Steele', 'past', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'detectives', 'minds', 'no-calorie', 'cookie', 'dead', 'body', 'be', 'kept', 'hidden', 'restauranteurs', 'trying', 'kill', 'savage', 'critic', 'teenage', 'pickpockets', 'baseball', 'camps', 'obnoxious', 'neighbors', 'Maltese', 'treasure', 'three', 'aging', 'movie', 'stars', 'ask', 'help', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'trying', 'kill', 'them.The', 'comedy', 'still', 'firmly', 'place', 'are', 'sinister', 'plots', 'centering', 'murder', 'embezzlement', 'Steele', 'attempt', 'redeem', 'teenage', 'pickpocket', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'woven', 'plenty', 'barbed', 'humour', 'such', 'corporate', 'bigwigs', 'scrabbling', 'floor', 'fat-free', 'cookie.Having', 'gotten', 'solid', 'formula', 'second', 'season', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'chugged', 'more', 'odd', 'mysteries', 'Okay', 'few', 'mysteries', 'resemble', 'real', 'crimes', 'comic', 'strip', 'inspires', 'attacks', 'cartoonist', 'are', 'often', 'funny', 'witty', 'only', 'get', 'few', 'hints', 'Steele', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'Ireland', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'Daniel', 'Chalmers', 'Steele', 'old', 'scam', 'where', 'Steele', 'be', 'new', 'Duke', 'Rutherford', 'Steele', 'reaction', 'how', 'far', 'come', 'how', 'honest', 'become', 'same', 'time', 'Laura', 'become', 'more', 'sensitive', 'murky', 'past', 'attempts', 'overcome', 'criminal', 'past', 'Sure', 'Zimbalist', 'Brosnan', 'disliked', 'other', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'electric', 'chemistry', 'many', 'episodes', 'Mildred', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'gradually', 'less', 'maternal', 'figure', 'more', 'equal', 'younger', 'cohorts.This', 'season', 'also', 'returning', 'characters', 'Daniel', 'Chalmers', 'Rocky', 'Sullivan', 'several', 'new', 'ones', 'Mulch', 'bumbling', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'always', 'seeking', 'Big', 'Moneymaker', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'also', 'appear', 'one', 'episode', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'lots', 'fun.The', 'third', 'season', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'steele', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'more', 'exploration', 'mystery', 'detective', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'comedy']",Remington Steele: Season 3

Laura & Remington still struggled with their double-edged business/romantic relationship; and actress Doris Roberts had, by now, settled comfortably into the Mildred Krebs role by showing her comedic flair as well as the tough & tender duality of her character. The season began with a typically stylish episode (""Steele At It"") as Remington returned to a bit of his past as a thief, stealing a jewel-encrusted dagger for a friend...and in true screwball fashion, managing to get Laura & Mildred involved! This was truly the peak season for the show as the cast & crew cooked up some very diverse & entertaining plots. ""Second Base Steele"" had Laura & Remington posing as ball players (Laura, a natural; Steele, hopelessly inept) to catch a killer; ""Steele Your Heart Away"" had Remington revisiting his Irish roots...and getting amnesia (a deftly fine comic performance from Pierce Brosnan); ""A Pocketful of Steele"" had Remington (once again) brushing up against his past when he befriends a young pickpocket (remember the curly-haired, impish child star Meeno Peluce?); ""Blue-Blooded Steele"" reunited Steele with his old pal, the charming con Daniel Chalmers (Stephanie Zimbalist's real life father Efrem, reprising his role) in a royal caper which infuriated Laura; ""Lofty Steele"" had someone tampering with Laura's digs to find a hidden treasure (they went as far as throwing Laura in a padded cell at a mental hospital, just to get her out of the way; BTW, a terrific performance from Ms. Zimbalist); and even Mildred took the spotlight in ""Hounded Steele"", finally revealing her personal life (poignantly) outside the office. There were familiar faces galore passing through the agency. Some on the verge of stardom (John Larroquette, Geena Davis, Jean Smart, Judith Light), and others legendary (Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford...and from my fave ""Cast in Steele"": Dorothy Lamour, Lloyd Nolan & Virginia Mayo).And that's just a handful of the episodes I remember well---but honestly, they're all good.As usual, 20th Century Fox did a fine job packaging these episodes.

969676,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000E6ESC6,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[3, 5]","Season 3 finds the beloved couple detective show reaching new heights . . . and unforunately a handful of lows!  There are no major changes to the format or cast this year.  The only change is that the pair are now finding themselves in many more exotic locales than just L.A (2 out-of-town in San Fran and Vegas, and 6 out-of-country in Mexico, Malta, Ireland, and England).As I said, there are a few misfires in this season, including what may be the most annoying and embarrasing episode of the series, STRONGER THAN STEEL, in which Laura tries to clear the man who played a super hero on TV during her childhood.  The whole Atomic Man bit with its weak attempt to recreate the then burgeoning sci-fi / comic convention craze just comes off as a laughable spoof, and among so many fine episodes, it sticks out like a sore thumb.Also painful are episodes that include athletes (Whitey Ford and Micky Mantle) and actors (Dorothy Lamour, Virginia Mayo, and Lloyd Nolan) playing themselves.  Nothing is worse than actors or athletes trying to ""be themsevles.""  The one with the actors is particularly bad, as it is obvious they pulled these three out of retirement with a giant wad of cash - it is clear the actors think the script is rubbish (and it is, with some of the LAMEST lines given to them) and as such they put NO effort into their lifeless roles.  The athletes - well, there is a reason they are swinging bats instead of winning oscars!!But, these few low points aside, there are also some FANTASTIC episodes, such as Steele's bout with amnesia in which he becomes a movie-trivia spouting fool while trying to remember why he is in Ireland - the pair trying to protect two clueless singing-telegram girls - Steele being attacked by cooks who think he is a ruthless restaurant critic - and Steele trying to reach out to a young street pick-pocket, in whom he sees the child he once was.But two episodes this season stand out as ""all-time best"" candidates.  The first is DICED STEELE which chronicles Steel attempting to bankrupt a suspected thief at a game of cards to lure him into betting the merchandise he stole.  Of course, Steele LOSES the game AND the $150,000 dollars the insurance company loaned him!  This sends the two off to Vegas to try to recover both money AND merchandise.  Meanwhile, a relentless investigator from the insurance company stumbles upon Steele's shady past, and thus we are introduced to Norman Keyes, who would return several times in season 4, always nipping at Steele's heels!The other stand-out is STEELE IN THE CHIPS - an episode co-written by Zimbalist herself, and so nearly a screw-ball comedy that the network was hesistant to air it for a long time.  It concerns several people going to lethal means to procure or destroy the recipe for a 1-calorie chocolate chip cookie, and includes an extended chase in the end taken straight from the playbook of IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!  This episode also brings us an early glimpse of Geena Davis (sporting a nice eighties-style Tennis outfit!!)Season 3 was definitely the show at its zenith.  While many great episodes are still to come in Season 4, they just never were quite as good as they were here!
