1060192,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000NQRSA6,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 2]","Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System is composed of 5 different Latin dance workouts lasting about 20 minutes each.  They are a lot of fun, and the difference of styles keeps the viewer from getting bored easily.  Lisa Nunziella leads it, and she teaches the routines very quickly by first doing the move with you twice before throwing it into the combo of dance steps already learned and taking it from the top.  If this is way too fast for you, though, don't despair, for also included on the DVD is a breakdown segment where Lisa will show you every dance move of a certain combo half time, and there is one of these for every routine.  Also, there is a place that has you do all routines 2 times each in what is called the ""Add Your Own Style"" segment.  Now, for a breakdown of each routine:Warm Up - The same warm up is used for all routines at the beginning of them, and it lasts about 5 minutes.  This will set the speed for the rest of the routines as it is FAST.  She will just start with a really fast step touch and never slow down after that.  Also, she will just throw moves at you with no explanation (and there is no breakdown for this segment) but by the end of this warm-up, whether you conquered all the steps or not, you will definitely be sufficiently warm.Cha-Cha - This entire routine pretty much is based on the 1-2-cha-cha-cha rhythm, and if you've ever done cha-cha before it should come pretty easily.  It's an intermediate/advanced section that is a lot of fun to do.  Lisa doesn't usually call each move it's proper name, but she rather calls it a ""turn step"" or a ""rock step"" so that can be kind of strange, but overall this routine is a lot of fun with a great rhythm.Salsa - This is definitely the most challenging section of them all, but I also found it to be the most fun.  The moves are extremely complex, making this an advanced routine, but they are really fun and unique to do.  You may recognize some moves from Lisa's earlier salsa DVDs, but they are mostly new moves and a lot of fun!Merengue - This routine was the most basic routine as pretty much the entire combo was just one step that had many variations.  It was definitely a beginner/intermediate workout that was really easy to do.  It had a few steps that were quite quick, but it was mostly just marching to the side, forward, or back.  It still managed to be a lot of fun, though, and I enjoyed it.Samba - This is a routine that isn't necessarily composed of challenging moves, but the moves are very technical and sometimes difficult to perform well.  Also, Lisa doesn't mention anything about having a bounce throughout the routine, which is something vital to any Samba routine.  This was my least favorite routine, as it wasn't that interesting to me because I had seen most of the moves before in other DVDs.  It's about an intermediate difficulty, but remember that the moves are slightly hard to pull off.Rhumba - This was a really fun section as it's unlike most dance routines in workouts today.  Although this section wasn't very cardio, the moves were a lot of fun to pull off, and I thoroughly enjoyed the smoothness of the combo.  Even though it didn't raise the heart rate as much as the other routines, it was still about an intermediate difficulty as some of the moves had twists and slides in them.  This was a really fun section; it just wasn't that great of a workout.Cool Down - Like the warm up, the cool down is the same for all of workouts.  It will start with some of the moves featured in the warm up before moving to some great stretches for the body.  There are modifications that one of the background dancers does, and there is also a yoga pose in the cool down, as well.  This was also about 5 minutes long.The routines can, of course, be put together if you are in the mood for a longer workout; you just have to be willing to skip the cool down at the end of the first routine and the warm up in the second routine.  Also included on the DVD are a blooper reel and a music advertisement.  Overall, I gave this workout 5 stars because it is a lot of fun to an intermediate/advanced exerciser/dancer as long as they are willing to learn the steps.  And if the viewer doesn't like one of the routines, there are four more, which makes this DVD well worth the price.  It's a great buy for Latin dance lovers everywhere!",5,This is a great Latin dance DVD with several workouts!,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,4354,"['Dance', 'Lisa', '5', 'Day', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'System', 'composed', '5', 'different', 'Latin', 'dance', 'workouts', 'lasting', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'difference', 'styles', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'getting', 'bored', 'easily', 'Lisa', 'Nunziella', 'routines', 'very', 'quickly', 'first', 'doing', 'move', 'twice', 'throwing', 'combo', 'dance', 'steps', 'already', 'learned', 'taking', 'top', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'despair', 'also', 'included', 'DVD', 'breakdown', 'segment', 'where', 'Lisa', 'will', 'show', 'dance', 'move', 'certain', 'combo', 'half', 'time', 'one', 'routine', 'Also', 'place', 'do', 'routines', '2', 'times', 'what', 'called', 'Add', 'Own', 'Style', 'segment', 'Now', 'breakdown', 'routine', 'Warm', 'Up', 'same', 'warm', 'up', 'used', 'routines', 'beginning', '5', 'minutes', 'will', 'set', 'speed', 'rest', 'routines', 'FAST', 'will', 'just', 'start', 'really', 'fast', 'step', 'touch', 'never', 'slow', 'down', 'Also', 'will', 'just', 'throw', 'moves', 'explanation', 'breakdown', 'segment', 'end', 'warm-up', 'conquered', 'steps', 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'sufficiently', 'warm.Cha-Cha', 'entire', 'routine', 'pretty', 'much', 'based', '1-2-cha-cha-cha', 'rhythm', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'cha-cha', 'should', 'come', 'pretty', 'easily', 'intermediate/advanced', 'section', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', 'Lisa', ""n't"", 'usually', 'call', 'move', 'proper', 'name', 'rather', 'turn', 'step', 'rock', 'step', 'can', 'be', 'kind', 'strange', 'routine', 'lot', 'fun', 'great', 'rhythm.Salsa', 'definitely', 'most', 'challenging', 'section', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'fun', 'moves', 'are', 'extremely', 'complex', 'making', 'advanced', 'routine', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'unique', 'do', 'may', 'recognize', 'moves', 'Lisa', 'earlier', 'salsa', 'DVDs', 'are', 'mostly', 'new', 'moves', 'lot', 'fun', 'Merengue', 'routine', 'was', 'most', 'basic', 'routine', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'combo', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'had', 'many', 'variations', 'was', 'definitely', 'beginner/intermediate', 'workout', 'was', 'really', 'easy', 'do', 'had', 'few', 'steps', 'were', 'quite', 'quick', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'marching', 'side', 'forward', 'back', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'it.Samba', 'routine', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'composed', 'challenging', 'moves', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'technical', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'perform', 'well', 'Also', 'Lisa', ""n't"", 'mention', 'anything', 'having', 'bounce', 'routine', 'something', 'vital', 'Samba', 'routine', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'routine', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'had', 'seen', 'most', 'moves', 'other', 'DVDs', 'intermediate', 'difficulty', 'remember', 'moves', 'are', 'slightly', 'hard', 'pull', 'off.Rhumba', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'section', 'most', 'dance', 'routines', 'workouts', 'today', 'section', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'cardio', 'moves', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'pull', 'off', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'smoothness', 'combo', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'routines', 'was', 'still', 'intermediate', 'difficulty', 'moves', 'had', 'twists', 'slides', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'section', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'workout.Cool', 'Down', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'same', 'workouts', 'will', 'start', 'moves', 'featured', 'warm', 'up', 'moving', 'great', 'stretches', 'body', 'are', 'modifications', 'one', 'background', 'dancers', 'also', 'yoga', 'pose', 'cool', 'down', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'about', '5', 'minutes', 'long.The', 'routines', 'can', 'course', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'mood', 'longer', 'workout', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'skip', 'cool', 'down', 'end', 'first', 'routine', 'warm', 'up', 'second', 'routine', 'Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'blooper', 'reel', 'music', 'advertisement', 'Overall', 'gave', 'workout', '5', 'stars', 'lot', 'fun', 'intermediate/advanced', 'exerciser/dancer', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'willing', 'learn', 'steps', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'routines', 'are', 'four', 'more', 'DVD', 'well', 'price', 'great', 'buy', 'Latin', 'dance', 'lovers', 'everywhere']",Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System
1060193,A3R74EHB34JTTP,B000NQRSA6,Amazon Customer,"[14, 14]","There's so many things I like about this DVD. I like that the instruction is separate, so you can just focus on the workout. To me, that saves a lot of time because you don't have to slow down for each change (and after you've seen a DVD 3 or 4 times, that becomes annoying).The pace is definitely fast. I would rate it at intermediate rather than advanced because it's low-impact. I'm not in the best of shape myself, but I've found that if you need to slow down, you can just step-touch until you're ready to jump back in.The music has an authentic sound (versus the classic canned-and-bland aerobic studio tracks) with a heavy drumbeat that's easy to follow. I like the enthusiasm of Lisa and her dancers, but I'll agree with other reviewers that you have to stay focused and concentrate in order to keep up.If you're in reasonably good aerobic shape, can focus well for longer periods of time (say, 20 minutes versus 10), and can follow dance steps without getting too lost, you'll enjoy this DVD. This is NOT for you if you're very out of shape and haven't exercised in a long while, if you like a mellow workout where you can 'zone out' a bit from time to time, or if you find dancing a bit challenging to begin with.All in all, a new favorite of mine.",5,Fun and efficient,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,1258,"['so', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'DVD', 'like', 'instruction', 'separate', 'can', 'just', 'focus', 'workout', 'lot', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'slow', 'down', 'change', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', '3', '4', 'times', 'annoying', '.The', 'pace', 'definitely', 'fast', 'would', 'rate', 'intermediate', 'rather', 'advanced', 'low-impact', ""'m"", 'not', 'best', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'found', 'need', 'slow', 'down', 'can', 'just', 'step-touch', ""'re"", 'ready', 'jump', 'back', 'in.The', 'music', 'authentic', 'sound', 'classic', 'canned-and-bland', 'aerobic', 'studio', 'tracks', 'heavy', 'drumbeat', 'easy', 'follow', 'enthusiasm', 'Lisa', 'dancers', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stay', 'focused', 'concentrate', 'order', 'keep', 'up.If', ""'re"", 'reasonably', 'good', 'aerobic', 'shape', 'can', 'focus', 'well', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'say', '20', 'minutes', '10', 'can', 'follow', 'dance', 'steps', 'getting', 'too', 'lost', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'NOT', ""'re"", 'very', 'shape', 'have', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'long', 'while', 'like', 'mellow', 'workout', 'where', 'can', ""'zone"", 'out', 'bit', 'time', 'time', 'find', 'dancing', 'bit', 'challenging', 'begin', 'with.All', 'new', 'favorite', 'mine']",Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System
1060194,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000NQRSA6,Colleen M. Schneider,"[20, 20]","Well, if you like to dance this might be a fun one to try.  I have Lisa's other two Salsa videos and they are in weekly rotation at my house.  The 5 day latin dance system is another great addition to her other videos.  She teaches you dance routines in the same building-block style, starting at full tempo, with the instruction segments always included on a separate portion of the disk.  This I like very much.  I can learn the routine in the instruction segment, but once I have it I'm not slowed down with having to go slowly through the first steps when all I really want is my work out.  The cool down and warmup are the same in all 5 segments, which is fine.  The warm up is good, if not extremly fast paced.  I wasn't crazy about the stretch afterward, just because I felt it was a little awkward to do a hamstring stretch and then go into a down dog (from yoga).  This I feel is much safer to do with a sticky mat and when you are in the proper alignment.  Other than that I really enjoyed the video.  My favorite segments were the Cha-cha and Salsa, which were the most fast-paced.  The Rhumba section is much slower and that one I would probably do in combination with a fast-paced segment on a a easier work out day.I find Lisa's cuing is excellent, as are her dancers, who have shown up on other videos of hers.  The set is minimal and the music is good.  Lisa's form is what you can expect from a world-champion dancer and even after you master the moves you can look to Lisa and her dancers for the best alignment and really start to perfect your form. I enjoy making my own work-out combinations or practicing all the segments together in the extras section.If you enjoy your cardio with a little Latin flair, give it a go, it is fun and before you know it your workout is done!",4,exercise=fun?,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,1795,"['Well', 'like', 'dance', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'one', 'try', 'have', 'Lisa', 'other', 'two', 'Salsa', 'videos', 'are', 'weekly', 'rotation', 'house', '5', 'day', 'latin', 'dance', 'system', 'great', 'addition', 'other', 'videos', 'dance', 'routines', 'same', 'building-block', 'style', 'starting', 'full', 'tempo', 'instruction', 'segments', 'always', 'included', 'separate', 'portion', 'disk', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'can', 'learn', 'routine', 'instruction', 'segment', 'once', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'slowed', 'down', 'having', 'go', 'slowly', 'first', 'steps', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'cool', 'down', 'warmup', 'are', 'same', '5', 'segments', 'fine', 'warm', 'up', 'good', 'not', 'extremly', 'fast', 'paced', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'stretch', 'afterward', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'awkward', 'do', 'hamstring', 'stretch', 'then', 'go', 'down', 'dog', 'yoga', 'feel', 'much', 'safer', 'do', 'sticky', 'mat', 'when', 'are', 'proper', 'alignment', 'Other', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'favorite', 'segments', 'were', 'Cha-cha', 'Salsa', 'were', 'most', 'fast-paced', 'Rhumba', 'section', 'much', 'slower', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'combination', 'fast-paced', 'segment', 'easier', 'work', 'day.I', 'find', 'Lisa', 'cuing', 'excellent', 'are', 'dancers', 'who', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'other', 'videos', 'hers', 'set', 'minimal', 'music', 'good', 'Lisa', 'form', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'world-champion', 'dancer', 'even', 'master', 'moves', 'can', 'look', 'Lisa', 'dancers', 'best', 'alignment', 'really', 'start', 'perfect', 'form', 'enjoy', 'making', 'own', 'work-out', 'combinations', 'practicing', 'segments', 'together', 'extras', 'section.If', 'enjoy', 'cardio', 'little', 'Latin', 'flair', 'give', 'go', 'fun', 'know', 'workout', 'done']",Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System
