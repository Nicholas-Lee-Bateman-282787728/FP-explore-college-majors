1640939,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B00BY8DE2I,Bert vanC Bailey,"[0, 0]","Low-life drug-dealing flick with Charlie Creed-Miles, a promising actor who played a despicable wife-beating cop in Injustice (2012), and did well in the hyperviolent, also made-for-TV Falc&oacute;n (2013).In this he plays Bill, just out on parole but risking a swift return if his dog as much as soils the sidewalk. The trouble starts when his younger son messes up with his old drug-dealing mates. The lowish budget is perfectly adequate to film this tale with panache, in fare not quite as violent as you'd expect from a Brit tough-guys flick (I'm thinking of the unmissable 'Sexy Beast,' e.g.). Still, there's a scene to excite the 14-year-old-boy in anyone, and the end makes for a gritty, well-rounded, satisfying plot.Dexter Fletcher makes a strong directorial debut with this, and co-wrote the often witty script with Danny King. The plot moves along nicely, and there's some depth of character, even if many secondary parts are weak, seldom rising above the 2-dimensional. Sad to see both Olivia Williams and Andy Serkis go wasted in roles that lack profiling and could have added much with richer dialogue: he's menacing enough despite a lack of good lines, but she's way too Knightsbridge for the part, ugly hairdo notwithstanding. Only Wild Bill's 11- and 15-year-old sons James (Sammy Williams) and Dean (Will Poulter) stand out; the first for a meaty part, while the second takes a convincing turn at brass-balled defiance.What's egregious is the lack of captions, given the accents. Daft marketing, in fact: the minor bother of a thousand pounds or two would have delivered them large English-speaking fans abroad. Ditto for the sound's quality - a recurring weakness in too much Brit fare, going back decades. Here, the music's up a few notches above the dialogue. No big deal, it's true, yet also .so. easy to correct that it rankles. Hopefully, if there's to be a next reunion of these talents, they'll get these right. And ideally, they'll re-release this with these two tech gaffes corrected.With captions this would be a minor gem in a career or two that may get some deserved fame.",4,A minor gem of a gangster flick,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2103,"['Low-life', 'drug-dealing', 'flick', 'Charlie', 'Creed-Miles', 'promising', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'despicable', 'wife-beating', 'cop', 'Injustice', '2012', 'did', 'well', 'hyperviolent', 'also', 'made-for-TV', 'Falc', 'oacute', '2013', '.In', 'Bill', 'just', 'out', 'parole', 'risking', 'swift', 'return', 'dog', 'as', 'much', 'sidewalk', 'trouble', 'when', 'younger', 'son', 'up', 'old', 'drug-dealing', 'mates', 'lowish', 'budget', 'perfectly', 'adequate', 'film', 'tale', 'panache', 'fare', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'violent', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Brit', 'tough-guys', 'flick', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'unmissable', 'Beast', 'e.g.', 'Still', 'scene', 'excite', '14-year-old-boy', 'anyone', 'end', 'gritty', 'well-rounded', 'satisfying', 'plot.Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'strong', 'directorial', 'debut', 'co-wrote', 'often', 'witty', 'script', 'Danny', 'King', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'depth', 'character', 'even', 'many', 'secondary', 'parts', 'are', 'weak', 'seldom', 'rising', '2-dimensional', 'Sad', 'see', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'go', 'wasted', 'roles', 'lack', 'profiling', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'much', 'richer', 'dialogue', 'menacing', 'enough', 'lack', 'good', 'lines', 'way', 'too', 'Knightsbridge', 'part', 'ugly', 'hairdo', 'notwithstanding', 'Only', 'Wild', 'Bill', '11-', '15-year-old', 'sons', 'James', 'Sammy', 'Williams', 'Dean', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'meaty', 'part', 'second', 'convincing', 'turn', 'brass-balled', 'defiance.What', 'egregious', 'lack', 'captions', 'given', 'accents', 'Daft', 'marketing', 'fact', 'minor', 'bother', 'thousand', 'pounds', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'delivered', 'large', 'English-speaking', 'fans', 'abroad', 'Ditto', 'sound', 'quality', 'recurring', 'weakness', 'too', 'much', 'Brit', 'fare', 'going', 'back', 'decades', 'Here', 'music', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'dialogue', 'big', 'deal', 'true', 'yet', 'also', '.so', 'easy', 'correct', 'Hopefully', 'be', 'next', 'reunion', 'talents', ""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'ideally', ""'ll"", 're-release', 'two', 'tech', 'gaffes', 'corrected.With', 'captions', 'would', 'be', 'minor', 'gem', 'career', 'two', 'may', 'get', 'deserved', 'fame']",N/A

1640941,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00BY8DE2I,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","British actor Dexter Fletcher makes a strong directorial debut with ""Wild Bill"", which he co-wrote with Danny King. ""Wild Bill"" Hayward (Charlie Creed-Miles) has just been released from prison, where he's spent 8 years for a laundry list of crimes as a result of his work with an East London drug-dealing syndicate. Unbeknownst to Bill, his two sons Dean (Will Poulter) and Jimmy (Sammy Williams), now 15 and 11 years old, have been abandoned by their mother and on their own for some time. After Bill is reluctantly reunited with his sons and apprised of the situation, his parole officer (Olivia Williams) puts Child Services onto them. Dean insists that Bill stay long enough to sort things out with Child Services, or Dean will turn him in to the cops for drugs. Bill's old drug-dealing colleagues don't want him hanging around, though, and are insisting he go to Scotland.Dexter Fletcher is a big admirer of Westerns, and we see some of that sensibility in ""Wild Bill."" Credit is also due editor Stuart Gazzard for perfect pacing. The film doesn't condescend to its barely working class characters. I especially like the way Will Poulter handles Dean. Dean is trying his best to earn a living and care for his younger brother, with limited success. We can sense his frustration at being unable to keep Jimmy out of trouble, and this made him the most sympathetic character to me. I don't think that anyone would change as much or as fast as Bill does over the course of this story. That's artistic license, but Bill's emotions always seem genuine, even if I question the result. ""Wild Bill"" is pretty unsentimental until it approaches its conclusion, which is also a plus. It has drama, underprivileged children, moral redemption, and violence. Something for everyone.The DVD (New Video Group 2013): Bonus features are a trailer (2 min), 10 deleted or extended scenes (13 min), a brief featurette in which the cast names their 3 favorite films (1  min), and a ""Making Of"" featurette (30 min), in which director Dexter Fletcher comments on his inspirations, casting, performances, and the shoot. The actors are interviewed about their reaction to the script, their characters, the shoot, and about working with Fletcher.

1640945,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00BY8DE2I,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[1, 1]","Directed by Dexter Fletcher (long-time actor, first-time director) from a screenplay he co-wrote with Danny King (Thieves Like Us), Wild Bill is an exceptionally well done film about a man named Bill, recently released from prison who's in no shape or mood to become a father, and his two sons, one of whom is too young to even remember him and the other who wants nothing to do with him.  But as the classic line from the Robert Frost poem goes, home is where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.  And Bill has nowhere else to go.A lot of what makes Wild Bill work are the performances of the cast. Charlie Creed-Miles (Injustice, The Last King) does an exceptionally nuanced turn as Wild Bill, bringing out the complex nature of the character, showing him alternately as a man with a past he largely wants to forget, who wants to be left alone to try and get on with his life, but at the same time a man who, however reluctantly at first, finds himself trying to do the right thing by his sons and by a woman he ends up getting to know. But Will Poulter (We're the Millers, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Son of Rambow) is truly outstanding as Bill's older son, Dean, his very expressive face showing Dean's turmoil of emotions as he in turn reluctantly comes to re-connect with his father even as he deals with Jimmy's increasing troubles and his own awkward relationship with a girl he has a major crush on.Highly recommended.",4,Exceptionally well done film about reluctant ex-con father and estranged son,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,1448,"['Directed', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'long-time', 'actor', 'first-time', 'director', 'screenplay', 'co-wrote', 'Danny', 'King', 'Thieves', 'Us', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'man', 'named', 'Bill', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'who', 'shape', 'mood', 'become', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'one', 'whom', 'too', 'young', 'even', 'remember', 'other', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'classic', 'line', 'Robert', 'Frost', 'poem', 'home', 'where', 'when', 'have', 'go', 'there', 'have', 'take', 'Bill', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go.A', 'lot', 'what', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'work', 'are', 'performances', 'cast', 'Charlie', 'Creed-Miles', 'Injustice', 'Last', 'King', 'exceptionally', 'nuanced', 'turn', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'bringing', 'out', 'complex', 'nature', 'character', 'showing', 'alternately', 'man', 'past', 'largely', 'forget', 'who', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'try', 'get', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'however', 'reluctantly', 'first', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'sons', 'woman', 'up', 'getting', 'know', 'Will', 'Poulter', ""'re"", 'Millers', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'Bill', 'older', 'son', 'Dean', 'very', 'expressive', 'face', 'showing', 'Dean', 'turmoil', 'emotions', 'turn', 'reluctantly', 're-connect', 'father', 'even', 'Jimmy', 'increasing', 'troubles', 'own', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'girl', 'major', 'crush', 'on.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
