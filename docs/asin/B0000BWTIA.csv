770913,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0000BWTIA,David Hugaert,"[2, 5]","An ""Odd Couple""-like premise, combined with a stellar cast, is most likely to make ""The In-Laws"" the runaway box-office blockbuster of the summer. The film's two main stars, Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, whose roles play off one another extremely well, you'd think they acted together previously. Brooks' Felix character plays comic foil to Douglas's Oscar-type persona, which provides great spontaneous comedy. Steve Tobias (Douglas) is a rogue-like CIA agent, who is nonchalantly paired with one of Chicago's top podiatrists, Jerry Peyser (Brooks), who falls prey to Tobias's scheme, and Peyser is ""recruited"" as a ""fait-accompli"" into Tobias's plans. The result is a mulligan's stew of chaos, as our heroes are jettisoned to and fro, to France and back to the U.S.A. - creating many memorable moments along their crazy journey. The plot leaves behind many hilarious scenes in its wake. For instance, the scenes where Brooks' character is somewhat ""paired"" with a gay Frenchman (especially the one where Jerry Peyser is in the jacuzzi with him, and showing a rather portly backside is priceless. Another scene where both Peyser and Tobias are on top of the John Hancock Building is also of grandesque proportions, where they take a flying leap off Chicago's second tallest structure, all while getting a birds-eye view of the city at night, eventually landing next to the famous orange sculpture on State Street (which can also be seen in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", for those keeping tabs on movie trivia). These are just a few surprises, but there are others just waiting to be seen at your local theater. Although Michael Douglas's prior feature ""It Runs In The Family"" garnered only a lukewarm reception from moviegoers, ""The In-Laws"", is most likely to get Mr. Douglas the props he deserves, as this is sure to have cash registers ringing like mad at theaters around the country.

When you start asking silly question you destroy the comedy and the Home Security Department is landing on your balcony, air borne and under-cover if not underwater. Because it is a comedy and nothing else. A silly comedy with spies from all over the world, planes that are hijacked, wrecked, or plain - funny for a plane - sacrificed. That's what happens when your father is a CIA agent at a third level of under-coverage, a triple under-cover-agent in one word. Just add to that a father in law who is a foot doctor who does not exactly like things slightly out of the ordinary because it is too exotic for his taste, like flying in a plane, taking a lift to a very high elevation, finding himself on the top panoramic floor of the highest skyscraper in Chicago, if not on the roof, getting down from up there with a parachute, making some noise to attract the attention of a torpedo while strutting around on Lake Michigan with a water scooter, a pedalo without pedals in a word but with a nice engine. But in spite of all the hullabaloo it is fun to have such a father and your bride is going to like every moment of it, especially when it goes with a lot of millions. And guess who is going to perform the wedding? Certainly not the Buddhist monk, the Jewish rabbi, or the Christian preacher whose denomination is not even mentioned. But you'll have to go check in the film itself because I am not going to say. One thing is important anyway for you and you better remember it: a father is unique and you have to take it the way it is, the way it comes, the way HE makes himself available because no one can change a father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,The Home Security Department is beyond laughability,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,1865,"['Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'manage', 'bring', 'Soviet', 'submarine', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'just', 'Chicago', 'When', 'start', 'asking', 'silly', 'question', 'destroy', 'comedy', 'Home', 'Security', 'Department', 'landing', 'balcony', 'air', 'borne', 'under-cover', 'not', 'underwater', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'else', 'A', 'silly', 'comedy', 'spies', 'world', 'planes', 'are', 'hijacked', 'wrecked', 'plain', 'funny', 'plane', 'sacrificed', 'what', 'when', 'father', 'CIA', 'agent', 'third', 'level', 'under-coverage', 'triple', 'under-cover-agent', 'one', 'word', 'Just', 'add', 'father', 'law', 'who', 'foot', 'doctor', 'who', 'not', 'exactly', 'things', 'slightly', 'ordinary', 'too', 'exotic', 'taste', 'flying', 'plane', 'taking', 'lift', 'very', 'high', 'elevation', 'finding', 'top', 'panoramic', 'floor', 'highest', 'skyscraper', 'Chicago', 'not', 'roof', 'getting', 'down', 'parachute', 'making', 'noise', 'attract', 'attention', 'torpedo', 'strutting', 'around', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'water', 'scooter', 'pedalo', 'pedals', 'word', 'nice', 'engine', 'spite', 'hullabaloo', 'fun', 'have', 'father', 'bride', 'going', 'like', 'moment', 'especially', 'when', 'lot', 'millions', 'guess', 'who', 'going', 'perform', 'wedding', 'Certainly', 'not', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'Jewish', 'rabbi', 'Christian', 'preacher', 'denomination', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'check', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'One', 'thing', 'important', 'anyway', 'better', 'remember', 'father', 'unique', 'have', 'take', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'HE', 'available', 'one', 'can', 'change', 'father.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

770925,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B0000BWTIA,Jason A. Miller,"[38, 46]","Why? Why why why?Well, there are positives to get out of the way first.  Albert Brooks is an inspired choice to recreate Alan Arkin's role from the original ""In-Laws"".  He brings to every movie a fully-formed nebbish ready to let loose 6 or 7 really memorable zingers, and this was no exception.  Michael Douglas has played a very wide range of stock characters, if not necessarily deep.  And the original ""In-Laws"" certainly wasn't technically perfect: it suffered from atrocious film editing.  Why not spruce it up with some CGI submarines, more expansive stunt sequences, and a Paul McCartney soundtrack?Most of the changes in the remake, however, don't make sense.  Brooks is playing a Chicago podiatrist, not a Manhattan dentist.  Michael Douglas has been saddled with a female sidekick, the likes of which Peter Falk didn't need.  There's considerable more emphasis placed on Brooks's daughter and Douglas's son... so they can argue at length about his pre-marital flings.  Candice Bergen has a strenuously unfunny cameo as Douglas's ex-wife (Falk was happily married in the original, albeit to a wife who had no idea what he did for a living).Most noticeably, the witty humor of the original is all but gone, save for a few Brooks gags.  That's all been replaced by a wide variety of warmed-over sex and toilet jokes, which have been funny in a hundred other movies since ""The In-Laws"" came out, and which are so familiar here that you'll laugh at the joke before it's even finished.  Indeed, with the main character being a nebbishy Jewish medical professional from Chicago, and his co-star an over-the-top CIA agent, you'll quickly realize that this is a remake of ""Meet the Parents"" more than anything else.The accomplished David Suchet shows up for a pointless role only faintly evocative of Richard Libertini's in the original.  I'm sure that blatant gags about repressed gay terrorists are still funny somewhere, but it is possible to do a movie without them.  Right?I wasn't expecting a carbon copy of the original ""In-Laws"".  However, I was expecting something lively and original.

The absurdity of how the plot proceeds is the source of comedy in this film, while the idea of the FBI chasing a potentially rogue deep-cover CIA agent isn't actually that strange - frankly I find the agencies themselves to be rogue operations relevant to the interests of common citizens.

I haven't seen the original that it is based on, so I can only write about what I have watched.It's an okay movie. There's only a couple of funny scenes. Most of it is pretty bland material, and it is probably one of the most predictable movies that has ever been made.(No way will you guess this, but everybody learns a valuable lesson... No way will you guess, but the groom learns about honesty and why it's important...)Plus, I found the bride and groom characters to be extremely irritating. I can't explain why, exactly, and it may just be my personality reacting to them, but they seem to be rather obnoxious people.However, in spite of being a dull and lifeless comedy, there are good points. The direction is agreeable and the special effects / sets are pretty good. About half of the actors do a good job, with Albert Brooks stealing the show completely.And, even if it isn't hilarious, it isn't painful to watch. The jokes aren't stupid or offensive, they're just not particularly funny (At least, not to me). This is good news, because it means that no matter who you are, you can at least give the movie a chance without being shocked by any nasty surprises or crude humor. You may not laugh, but, hey... like I said, ""Innocuous.""VIOLENT CONTENT - Some punches and kicks, people point guns at each other a lot, some slapsticky humor. There's no blood. Saturday morning cartoons have more violence within two minutes than this movie has in its entirity.LANGUAGE CONTENT - Not much. I think they say the ""F word"" once, there's a couple of the ""S word."" Scattered language throughout that doesn't amount to a whole lot.NUDITY / SEXUAL CONTENT - Almost nothing.

Now, another one comes starring Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, a buddy-buddy comedy loosely based on the 1979 film of the same title featuring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin.  Remake?  Not exactly.Main character is Michael Douglas's CIA undercover agent, whose son is going to marry the daughter of Albert Brooks, who plays a nervous foot-doctor.  As you know, the latter doesn't know the identity of Douglas, who, to him, looks at first acting very strange.  Normally your father of the bride wouldn't like to see the daddy of your son-in-law talking about a certain 'Olga' (actually, a nuke submarine), and kicking a stranger in the men's room.The poorly written script goes on, including the French villain played by David Suchet, before whom Albert Brooks, now in the secret of Douglas's real job, has to act like a real killer (named 'Cobra').  There is a story about arms dealers, bumbling FBI men, or the sub I mentioned, but sorry, they are all forgettable.But the comic pair of Douglas and Brooks work up to a point, and there are funny scenes surrounding Brooks and Suchet, even though it's just another gay joke (which is done well in itself).  When Brooks is on the screen, you can say that he gives every scene a great comic touch, with perfect comic timing.  Douglas, more serious and straight than him, is not bad as a foil, though I suspect someone else could be a better choice.The director is Andrew Fleming ('Dick'), who certaily has great ideas but somehow stops exploring them furthrr.  The supports are therefore underdeveloped, Candice Bergen as ex-wife of Douglas character, in particular.  Her turn as a comic (with sexual nature that makes you giggle) is surprisingly good, but she is given too short time to impress us, so is Robin Tunney or Lindsay Sloane.So should we see it?  It depends; there are good things, to be sure, but slick as it is, this new one is too tame and too normal.",3,Mildly Entertaining Comedy Featuring Great Albert Brooks,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,2062,"['pity', 'Albert', 'Brooks', ""n't"", 'do', 'many', 'films', 'when', 'always', 'time', 'money', 'spend', 'even', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'Now', 'one', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'buddy-buddy', 'comedy', 'loosely', 'based', '1979', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'featuring', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Remake', 'Not', 'exactly.Main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'CIA', 'undercover', 'agent', 'son', 'going', 'marry', 'daughter', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'nervous', 'foot-doctor', 'know', 'latter', ""n't"", 'know', 'identity', 'Douglas', 'who', 'first', 'acting', 'very', 'strange', 'Normally', 'father', 'bride', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'daddy', 'son-in-law', 'talking', 'certain', ""'Olga"", 'actually', 'nuke', 'submarine', 'kicking', 'stranger', 'men', 'room.The', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'including', 'French', 'villain', 'played', 'David', 'Suchet', 'whom', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'now', 'secret', 'Douglas', 'real', 'job', 'act', 'real', 'killer', 'named', ""'Cobra"", 'story', 'arms', 'dealers', 'bumbling', 'FBI', 'men', 'sub', 'mentioned', 'sorry', 'are', 'forgettable.But', 'comic', 'pair', 'Douglas', 'Brooks', 'work', 'up', 'point', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'surrounding', 'Brooks', 'Suchet', 'even', 'just', 'gay', 'joke', 'done', 'well', 'When', 'Brooks', 'screen', 'can', 'say', 'scene', 'great', 'comic', 'touch', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'Douglas', 'more', 'serious', 'straight', 'not', 'bad', 'foil', 'suspect', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'choice.The', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Fleming', ""'Dick"", 'who', 'certaily', 'great', 'ideas', 'somehow', 'stops', 'exploring', 'furthrr', 'supports', 'are', 'therefore', 'underdeveloped', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'ex-wife', 'Douglas', 'character', 'particular', 'turn', 'comic', 'sexual', 'nature', 'giggle', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'given', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'impress', 'so', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane.So', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'be', 'sure', 'slick', 'new', 'one', 'too', 'tame', 'too', 'normal']",N/A
770961,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000BWTIA,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 2]","This is a light, breezy comedy which is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name.  Albert Brooks is Jerry Peyser, a Chicago podiatrist (Alan Arkin was a NYC dentist) and Michael Douglas (Steve Tobias) reprises Peter Falk's role as a deepcover CIA agent. The basic plot remains unchanged - as the wedding of their children approaches the unsuspecting father of the bride (Jerry) is drafted into duty to help the undercover agent (Steve) who is involved in a high priority attempt to foil an outlandish plot. The original film relied on the cleverness of the plot and the dry comedic talents of Falk and Arkin combined with the chemistry between them which developed on the screen. In contrast, technology is at the heart of agent Tobias' modus operandi in this film, and the action is much faster paced than in the original.There are enough funny lines (with a few really hilarious sequences) and the pace is fast enough to make the film enjoyable light entertainment. Candice Bergen as Tobias' ex, supposedly mellowed through her conversion to mediation but in reality still extremely agitated by him, and especially the wonderful David Suchet as a gay arms dealer also provide some all too brief comic highlights. If you have seen the trailers or even just the TV ads, this is one film where they accurately represent its nature.
