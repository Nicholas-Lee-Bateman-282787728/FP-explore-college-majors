The experts in this program have found that few actually can - our brain operates on only 12 watts of energy and has been programmed to make efficient use of that limited power. The bad news is that we don't realize that our performance is being impaired attempting to multi-task; similarly, we don't realize what we don't notice.Only recently has multi-tasking become an issue - up until about 150 years ago or less there was little opportunity to try and multi-task.
