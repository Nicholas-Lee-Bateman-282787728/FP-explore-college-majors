817018,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0001Y4MK4,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 9]","""Tout contre L&eacute;o"" (""Close To Leo""), a 2002 film made for French television, recently released in the US on DVD, is a remarkably warm drama about a close and loving working-class rural family in crisis.Leo (Pierre Mignard), the oldest of four boys (ages 11-21) is openly gay and accepted as such by his siblings and loving parents.  But when Leo reveals he was diagnosed as being HIV+, the family decides to keep it a secret from 11 year old Marcel, who actually overheard the revelation.  Marcel, beautifully acted by Yaniss Lespert, ""acts out"" a bit to dispel both his hurt feelings at being ""left out"" of the discussion as well as his feelings for Leo, with whom he has an unusually close bond.  Following some medical tests, which apparently show the infection is progressing, Leo feels his life is over when he is put on a tedious drug ""cocktail"" regimen, and decides to ""take a holiday"" to put his feelings in perspective.  He agrees to Marcel's plea to tag along, not knowing that he is aware of his illness.  When Marcel confesses he does know, a conflict ensues since Leo is still very much in denial about the whole thing, and just wants to have a good time.In one climatic scene, Leo attempts to throw away his meds, and Marcel grabs a handful of the pills and tosses them in his own mouth.  When Leo forces Marcel to spit them out, the reply is that if Leo wants to kill himself (by not taking the medications), then he doesn't want to live either.  This shocks Leo into realizing that, if he indeed is making the decision to shorten his life by not sticking to the drugs with their potential side effects, he has to consider the impact watching this would have on Marcel and the rest of his family.  Deciding to send Marcel home, they say goodbye (assuming it will be for the last time) at the train station, in what is the most emotionally charged scene of the film.A warm, loving, sensual and endearing film, which is both sad and life affirming in parts.  The acting is generally first rate (The exception was Marie Bunel as the mother, whom I thought was badly over-acting, even in the context of dealing with her oldest son having a potentially fatal disease.)

All pieces somehow come together on the screen.One of the things I liked most about the film, is that we were two-thirds of the way along before the subject of ""sexuality"" was raised.  Therefore leaving the viewer to form a relationship with Leo, the 21 year old lead in the film, who in a very early scene announces to his family he is HIV Positive.  He actually refers to having AIDS.His family (mother, father and 2 brothers around Leo's age) determine it is best to keep his illness a secret from his youngest brother Marcel, age 12.  Unbeknownst to the family, Marcel overhears the family discussing Leo's illness.The next part of the movie is at times slow moving, and a little ""off"".  Several scenes lead the viewer to wonder exactly what the next scene will entail.  In general, it is these scenes that are the basis for each family member dealing with the startling news.The final 30 minutes is the best part of film in many respects. Doctors determine Leo's medical needs, and upon learning this, he embarks on a journey with his younger brother Marcel to Paris.  Here they bond, and meet a siginificant player in Leo's life.  They also come to terms with Leo's status as he shares this and other personal matters with Marcel.I found some of the scenes to be ackwardly intimate.  However, this is a French film.  And brothers who share close bonds and show affection towards one another is ""normal"".This is one of the few movies made in the 2000's (that I have seen) that deals head-on with AIDS, and how the diseases can still have devastating effects on family and loved ones.Just for the record, the film is in French with English subtitles.",4,"Ackwardly Intimate, Slow-Moving, Art-House Film",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1756,"['interesting', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Good', 'direction', 'great', 'acting', 'ackward', 'storyline', 'pieces', 'somehow', 'come', 'together', 'screen.One', 'things', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'were', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'subject', 'sexuality', 'was', 'raised', 'Therefore', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'form', 'relationship', 'Leo', '21', 'year', 'old', 'lead', 'film', 'who', 'very', 'early', 'scene', 'announces', 'family', 'HIV', 'Positive', 'actually', 'having', 'AIDS.His', 'family', 'mother', 'father', '2', 'brothers', 'Leo', 'age', 'determine', 'best', 'keep', 'illness', 'secret', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Marcel', 'age', '12', 'Unbeknownst', 'family', 'Marcel', 'family', 'discussing', 'Leo', 'illness.The', 'next', 'part', 'movie', 'times', 'slow', 'moving', 'little', 'Several', 'scenes', 'lead', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'exactly', 'what', 'next', 'scene', 'will', 'entail', 'general', 'scenes', 'are', 'basis', 'family', 'member', 'dealing', 'startling', 'news.The', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'many', 'respects', 'Doctors', 'determine', 'Leo', 'medical', 'needs', 'learning', 'journey', 'younger', 'brother', 'Marcel', 'Paris', 'Here', 'bond', 'meet', 'siginificant', 'player', 'Leo', 'life', 'also', 'come', 'terms', 'Leo', 'status', 'shares', 'other', 'personal', 'matters', 'Marcel.I', 'found', 'scenes', 'be', 'ackwardly', 'intimate', 'However', 'French', 'film', 'brothers', 'who', 'share', 'close', 'bonds', 'show', 'affection', 'one', 'normal', '.This', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'made', '2000', 'have', 'seen', 'head-on', 'AIDS', 'how', 'diseases', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'devastating', 'effects', 'family', 'loved', 'ones.Just', 'record', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles']",Close to Leo

The family decides it best to not tell the youngest brother Marcel (Yannis Lespert) because he is only 12 and would not comphehend the situation. What develops is a trip for both Leo and Marcel that takes them to Paris and binds them even closer.This movie is well written and well acted. The interworkings of the family is exposed after Leo reveals his status; and the director takes his time to explore the change that comes over each character. Mignard is excellent in playing Leo, a strong young man coming to terms with his own mortality, yet still trying to be brave for his parents and brothers. Lespert is impressive in his performance as a smart, strong willed 12 year old that is struggling to comes to terms with his brother's condition. The vulnerbility of Leo and Marcel is incredibly real; not to mention the grief and worry portrayed by Leo's family is so genuine you feel like a member of the family.

817021,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001Y4MK4,Grady Harp,"[18, 19]","CLOSE TO LEO as written and directed by Christophe Honore is one of the most sensitive, warmly human stories to be captured on film in recent years. This small but very touching film radiates the beauty that can be found in families devoted to each other, a type of love that seems all too rare these days.Leo (Pierre Mignard) at age 21 is the eldest of four sons of a small family in a little town in Brittany.  Leo is gay and is completely accepted for his lifestyle by his parents (father - Dominic Gould and mother Marie Bunel) as well as his younger brothers Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley), Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) and the youngest , 11 years old Marcel (Yannis Lespert).  When Leo discovers he is HIV positive, his family is supportive and plans to look for the best treatment and care. However, their discussion and closeness to Leo is not shared with Marcel who is 'protected' from AIDS information the family feels would be damaging to Marcel.  Problem: Marcel overhears the discussion and is enraged by his exclusion, forcing him into destructive behavior with his little friend.  Ultimately Leo accepts his family's advice to seek treatment in Brest and Paris and decides to take Marcel with him on his journey for help (and for a assignation with a previous lover).  As Leo's difficulty in facing his disease grows in intensity, he sends Marcel home and the ending of the movie is a sensitive climax best left for the viewer to absorb alone.Not only is this story one that restores our belief in the sanctity of family, it also presents a potentially cataclysmic topic with such reverence for privacy and for understanding that it becomes a major accomplishment due much more visibility than it has gained.  The glowing warmth and tenderness displayed by the father for his children and his wife, the beauty of the brotherly love as presented in the performances by these understatedly substantial actors, and the incredible dignity that Pierre Mignard and Yannis Lespert  as Leo and Marcel bring to their roles is astonishingly fine. This is a quiet, profound little film about family.  It merits your attention, not only for viewing but for a place in your film library.

He has three older brothers, Leo (Pierre Mignard), Tristan (Rodolphe Pauly), and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann), all around 20 years old. After some introductory scenes, the movie really starts with Marcel going off to bed but coming back to hear the father of the family (Dominic Gould) ask the others not to tell Marcel that Leo is HIV-positive, because Marcel is ""too young.""Marcel is soon acting a bit strangely and asking indirect questions.  The mother (Marie Bunel) evades the questions.  The other brothers make hints but back off on telling the story.  Marcel does get some reassurance and information from the mother of one of his classmates.Leo takes Marcel on a trip to Paris, where Leo hopes to rekindle a romance with an ex-boyfriend.  Marcel hears from Leo that Leo is indeed very sick and very gay.  After a while Marcel is able to figure out that that Leo is also very unhappy with his situation and with taking his meds.  Leo puts Marcel on a train back home to Finisterre (western Brittany), saying that Leo is counting on Marcel to lighten the atmosphere back home.  Then the movie goes on to its brief, unhappy conclusion.Family life is filled with touching, hugs, kisses, sharing beds (non-sexually), and apparent good humor.  Marcel finds himself having to counterbalance this with the adults' rapid mood swings and sudden distancing.  The alternation of childhood intimacy and adult discretion, followed by trauma, finally gets to Marcel.The boys are frequently not fully dressed, and the older brothers go skinny dipping.  There is one sex scene for Leo in Paris.Secrets are damaging, and talking through problems is helpful; the plot is successful, in part because, like Marcel, the audience is not told everything.  The main actors, Yannis Lespert and Pierre Mignard, do a fine job.Other than some trailers, there are no extras.  The actors' names are not matched up with their characters' names in the credits.

817023,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0001Y4MK4,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[4, 5]",".....can't.  Here we have a loving and supportive family of four sons, a family who so obviously, to us, express a true joy for life and caring for one another.  In fact, this type of behavior is even visually apparent (there are many scenes of this closeness which you will see).  Then, as a bolt from the blue, we have one of the older sons, Leo, who learns that he is HIV-positive---a fact which he shares by disclosing it to the family (who had already accepted him as gay).  Only the youngest brother of 12 years has been excluded from this knowledge, or so it's thought.Other reviewers of this 2002 film have expounded quite well on the effect knowledge of Leo's illness has on the family, particularly the 12 year old---the sibling most close to Leo.  My review here, however, is aimed at Leo's response to his illness, whether you could consider it a somewhat unlikely one, and why?  In doing this I think it's important to look at the film's timeframe.  It appears not to be the early to mid-80's, when this disease was new and those afflicted were dying, largely untreated, in high numbers.  Rather, when looking at the dress modes and general behavior of the younger set we are introduced to, we seem to find ourselves in the mid- to late 90's, possibly even the beginning of the next century.  At that point successful treatment/control of this disease appeared to be at hand---even though not being necessarily easy on the patient.  Inexplicably, though, our writer/director gives us a young man with all the apparent love and support in the world, who chooses to give it all up---even going so far as to break off the love of another man (who we do briefly meet and who seems, possibly, the supportive type---had he not been dropped).  This is my biggest problem with the film---that we are not provided any particular reason for Leo's final course of action.Usually, I find, the French are very good at getting this kind of film ""right;"" whereas American film makers so often screw it up.  But let me just mention one US film, involving this same subject, which gets it oh-so-very-right.  If you haven't had the opportunity to catch a viewing of 2005's ""Loggerheads,"" (also on DVD) you're missing out on a very well done little film.  It, too, involves a young man in an HIV-positive status, played by an American likely of the same age as the actor giving us Leo.  The really, really big difference in their situations, though, is that the ""Loggerheads"" character has been cut off/banished by his parents and, at the time we are introduced to him, surviving basically on his own.  Its story is a heart-rending one as well.....and that same ""Big Question"" remains as unanswered in it as it does in our French production, here.If any of you reading this have any thoughts as to the whys and wherefores of Leo's action, please feel free to make a Comment, below.  But whatever else, please do consider learning more about ""Loggerheads"" both on this website and elsewhere.

Marcel is the youngest of four brothers. The oldest one, Leo, finds out that he has AIDS.And in that moment appears very first ""?"" in that storyline. Is it really AIDS or HIV? Leo is 21. It is hard to believe that AIDS managed to develop to such degree that he will die.I tried to understand the reasons behind Leo's actions, but I just wasn't able. There is too many unclear parts in this story. Why did he visit his ex-boyfriend? Why did he throw away the pills? Why didn't he want to start the treatment? And so on.Instead of focusing on Leo's plot, the director decides to set his magnifying glass on the youngest Marcel...Which is not bad, but didn't help the viewer understand the choices that are made by Leo.The film is well played, for sure.

817026,A2MA1VI5Z5DDE9,B0001Y4MK4,R. Force,"[15, 18]","Lovers of foreign films will find this movie a gem.  Unlike most American offerings, foreign productions rely on human relationships and emotions to drive the plot rather than sterotypical situations and characters.  This film is no exception. The movie, which is more about family bonds at a time of crisis then it is about homosexuality and the horror of AIDS, is candid and enthralling from beginning to end. The relationships between the family members is touching, and at times inadvertently strange, especially if you're from an American family.  The love they have for one another comes across very strong and actions like cuddling while sleeping in the same bed and incidental nudity among brothers (things considered inappropriate in other cultures) are not in any way sexual but simply a natural part of family life. In my opinion a good movie allows you to think about bigger issues. While watching ""Close to Leo"" I couldn't help but wonder how much stronger and stable people, and in turn societies, would be if most families were like this. Maybe cultures in general have been too quick to demonize and think of such activities as suspect or improperly sexual.  Even the family's questionable decision to keep the plight of Marcel's favorite brother a secret is made out of concern and compassion not selfishness or malice.  The climax of the film does contains graphic sexuality and nudity between Leo and a hostel keeper, but it is done in a very realistic and poignant way. It is here where the audience is able to see how Leo's deep familial love enables him to make a final unselfish choice. By deciding to change his previous wanton behavior and send Marcel back home alone from Paris, he makes the decision to take possession of his own pain over his death and refuse to allow anyone in the family to take it upon themselves.Definitely a ""must see"" if you get the opportunity.",4,Good story...Great acting,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,1896,"['Lovers', 'foreign', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'gem', 'most', 'American', 'offerings', 'foreign', 'productions', 'rely', 'human', 'relationships', 'emotions', 'drive', 'plot', 'rather', 'sterotypical', 'situations', 'characters', 'film', 'exception', 'movie', 'more', 'family', 'bonds', 'time', 'crisis', 'then', 'homosexuality', 'horror', 'AIDS', 'candid', 'enthralling', 'beginning', 'end', 'relationships', 'family', 'members', 'touching', 'times', 'inadvertently', 'strange', 'especially', ""'re"", 'American', 'family', 'love', 'have', 'one', 'across', 'very', 'strong', 'actions', 'cuddling', 'sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'incidental', 'nudity', 'brothers', 'things', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'other', 'cultures', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'sexual', 'simply', 'natural', 'part', 'family', 'life', 'opinion', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'bigger', 'issues', 'watching', 'Close', 'Leo', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'stronger', 'stable', 'people', 'turn', 'societies', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'families', 'were', 'Maybe', 'general', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'quick', 'demonize', 'think', 'such', 'activities', 'suspect', 'improperly', 'sexual', 'Even', 'family', 'questionable', 'decision', 'keep', 'plight', 'Marcel', 'favorite', 'brother', 'secret', 'made', 'concern', 'compassion', 'not', 'selfishness', 'malice', 'climax', 'film', 'contains', 'graphic', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'Leo', 'hostel', 'keeper', 'done', 'very', 'realistic', 'poignant', 'way', 'here', 'where', 'audience', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'Leo', 'deep', 'familial', 'love', 'make', 'final', 'unselfish', 'choice', 'deciding', 'change', 'previous', 'wanton', 'behavior', 'send', 'Marcel', 'back', 'home', 'alone', 'Paris', 'decision', 'take', 'possession', 'own', 'pain', 'death', 'refuse', 'allow', 'anyone', 'family', 'take', 'upon', 'themselves.Definitely', 'must', 'see', 'get', 'opportunity']",Close to Leo
