I'm assuming that they did not want to get into specifics about the controversies of her visions.  Do you really think that she was threatened with excommunication over an argument about a novice?If this story piqued your interest into the life of Hildegard, I implore you to read an unedited biography - not published by the church - of her amazing life and visions.  There are editions that include her own sketches of her visions, which will make it easier for you to understand why she and her intercessors needed to describe her spiritual love for God, taking the form of human love...I'm just confusing the issue.  Hildegard was a true visionary who's only weakness was that she was human - if that is really a weakness.  I urge you to read more about this Saintly Woman.",3,An Introduction...,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,894,"['kindest', 'comment', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'introduction', 'life', 'Hildegard', 'Bingen', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'specifics', 'controversies', 'visions', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'threatened', 'excommunication', 'argument', 'novice', 'story', 'piqued', 'interest', 'life', 'Hildegard', 'implore', 'read', 'unedited', 'biography', 'not', 'published', 'church', 'amazing', 'life', 'visions', 'are', 'editions', 'include', 'own', 'sketches', 'visions', 'will', 'make', 'easier', 'understand', 'why', 'intercessors', 'needed', 'describe', 'spiritual', 'love', 'God', 'taking', 'form', 'human', 'love', ""'m"", 'just', 'confusing', 'issue', 'Hildegard', 'was', 'true', 'visionary', 'who', 'only', 'weakness', 'was', 'was', 'human', 'really', 'weakness', 'urge', 'read', 'more', 'Saintly', 'Woman']",N/A

She is one of the most talented actresses ever...The movie Hildegard was a little confusing to me because I had never heard the history of the storyline before, and I think the makers of the film left out a lot of information that they probably assumed people would already know (I know they always have to have some things end up on the cutting room floor, but it seemed there were large gaps in the story that just didn't make sense)...Overall, it was well made, but I suggest reading the full story of Hildegard before watching this movie.
