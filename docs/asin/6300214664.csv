214449,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300214664,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Silver Bullet, 1985 filmThis story begins with a full moon (which is said to affect people's behavior). A man sings an advertising jingle, later there is a howl. The small town has a celebration. One boy plays a prank on a girl. She overhears a delicate conversation between a man and a woman. Her brother uses a wheelchair. Later that woman swallows red pills. A furry creature breaks into her room and she screams! Her mother grabs a handy pistol and climbs the stairs. Too late! Marty plays poker with his Uncle Red. [A useful skill?] A man's TV viewing is disturbed; he takes his rifle and goes outside to his shed. He is the third victim. There is a sale on shotguns. Marty flies a kite. So does his friend Brady. After dark the people find another body. The men form a militia to search for the killer. [They have the right to keep and bear arms.]The Reverend tries to stop them from their ""private justice"". [Did he tip his mitt?] Are those men making too much noise while hunting? Should they keep their safeties on? [This is too comic for a horror story.] A baseball bat is not a good weapon against a werewolf. That night the Reverend has a nightmare! [Funny? Does it remind you of an Abbott & Costello movie?] Marty gets a special vehicle from his uncle Red. ""Be careful."" Late at night Marty climbs out of his window to ride his new tricycle and set off fireworks. He is watched. A small rocket stops the attack of the werewolf. Marty tells Janey about it. Janey visits people to ask for returnable glass bottles and cans (and also check for a wound). [The brand names show product placement.] She finds a baseball bat! Who can she confide in? Uncle Red listens, but he is doubtful. [When did these attacks begin?]A four-door Chevrolet follows Marty as he drives home. He takes a short cut but runs out of gas. The driver walks toward him, but departs when a witness appears. [Logical reaction?] Marty tells Red, who tells the Sheriff. A crazy story? The Sheriff investigates at night, alone. A bad career move? What creates a werewolf? Can they make a silver bullet? The next full moon arrives. [Note the dirt roads.] Uncle Red guards Janey and Marty while their parents leave. Then the lights go out. ""He's here!"" Marty is lucky in knowing how to use a revolver correctly. They are saved! [There is no final scene to wrap up the loose ends.] Did the Gun Control Fanatics ban this movie from TV?I once read a book that said the legends from the Hollywood films from the 1930s were invented for those movies. It was wolfsbane that kept away vampires, not garlic. The idea of a silver bullet was another Hollywood myth. Most people's knowledge comes from the movies and television, not history books. One article said the legends of werewolves were created after outbreaks of rabies (whose victims attacked other people). Werewolf and vampire movies became popular during the Great Depression, a distraction and entertainment for people damaged by economic forces beyond their control. Unless they gathered together to attack the castle of the Baron (the economic royalist). This may explain the renewed interest in horror movies since 2008 (the Great Recession). The triumph over the monsters in these movies represent hope to the viewers.

While I found it somewhat enjoyable, I felt like it was a fairly blah, hollow story. So, when SILVER BULLET opened at the theatre, I wasn't all that excited about it. Well, I went to see it and was pleasantly surprised! King wrote the screenplay, and fleshed out his tale by taking the time to develop the characters. I would say that Mr. King added some much needed warmth to the overall story. He also put in some interesting stuff like Corey Haims' suped-up wheelchair, the colorful townfolk, etc. to enhance the proceedings. I was impressed by Gary Busey (Predator 2) as Uncle Red. He brought a sincerity to the role. He was a caring person without being goopy about it! Everett McGill (The People Under The Stairs) was spot f-ing on as Reverend Lowe!

Stephen King adapted his own novella, Cycle of the Werewolf, into what is essentially a very entertaining and character driven horror film. King has always had a knack for creating characters we care about, and ""Silver Bullet"" is certainly no exception to that time honored fact.I don't understand why some people went into this looking for a gorefest. That's not what this movie is about. Contrary to some rather erroneous reviews, the special effects we do have in this film are very well executed and don't overwhelm or diminish the story in any way. The one thing people should remember with any horror film is that gore, in itself, is not intrinsically frightening. The key to pulling it off successfully is to present it in a way that goes hand in hand with the story you're trying to tell. Having gore in a movie simply because there's a werewolf is silly if you don't care about what's going on. But, that's just my opinion.Gary Busey, as many here have already reported, is very entertaining as Uncle Red. It was refreshing to see him playing a nice guy for a change, and his interaction with the kids as they try to convince him of what's going on was teriffic.This was simply a great movie.

The bad guys are really bad, really gross, they get killed immediately, and there is a Halloween night showdown that has almost no suspense or thrills.

214477,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300214664,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[19, 23]","Based on a novella written by author Stephen King titled Cycle of the Werewolf, Silver Bullet (1985) falls into the area of being very good, while not on the same level of other movies based on King stories like The Shining (1980) or Christine (1983), but certainly not dwelling in the depths of cruddiness like Maximum Overdrive (1986), which, by the way was the only film King ever directed, which says a lot based on how many of his stories have been adapted to the big and little screens.  I remember when Maximum Overdrive came out, and King made such a big deal about his directing it, saying something along the lines of if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself...boy did that film flop.  Anyway, thankfully Silver Bullet wasn't directed by King, but was put into the more capable hands of a man named Dan Attias, who later went on to work almost exclusively directing television episodes for such shows like SledgeHammer, Jake and the Fatman, Melrose Place, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and so on...the film lists a pretty impressive cast with Gary Busey (prior to his 1988 near-fatal motorcycle accident where he suffered massive head injuries), Corey Haim before he became really annoying (that period began shortly after the film The Lost Boys (1987) and has yet to end), perennial screen meany Everett McGill, and a young Megan Follows, who I most remember as Anne from the Anne of Green Gables series.  Also appearing in minor roles are Terry O'Quinn, probably most memorable as the psychotic killer step dad from the Stepfather films, and veteran actor Lawrence Tierney, who many would remember best as the gruff, curmudgeonly old man Joe Cabot from Quentin Tarantino's breakout film Reservoir Dogs (1992).As the film begins, we're presented with an older female narrative voice speaking of past events, specifically a particularly horrific series of events over the period of a summer long since past.  As the voice speaks, we are transported back to the unspecified time, and witness a fairly brutal decapitation of a lone rail yard worker, which, apparently was just the precursor to horror yet to come.  Soon afterwards we meet Marty Coslow (I thought it was Coleslaw, until I saw the credits), played by Haim.  A prior, unmentioned accident has caused the loss of use of Marty's legs, confining him to a wheelchair, but he seems to have adapted well, especially with the diesel powered wheelchair his Uncle Red (Busey) built for him.  Marty has a older sister named Jane (Follows), who is also the narrator at the beginning of the film, and they seem to have a very normal pre-teen sibling relationship where Marty plays pranks on Jane, and Jane gets frustrated with him because she believes their parents let him get away with much due to his condition.  Despite Marty's condition, the relationship mirrors most any sibling relation consisting of varying degrees of love and hate.  We also meet Uncle Red, a boozy, affable fellow who shares a special relationship with his nephew Marty, and also with Jane to some degree, based on the obvious indications that, while he is an adult, he still maintains a childlike quality of an adult who never grew up.  He's the uncle you wish you had, the one to get you into R-rated movies, cover for you if you skipped school, buy you fireworks, etc.Anyway, as the summer wears on, so do the murders.  The nature of the killings is obviously well beyond anything local law enforcement is accustom to (think Sheriff Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife in Mayberry, only without the humor), and the townspeople begin to get very agitated at the inability of the sheriff to find the killer.  Based on the viciousness of the murders and the title of the film, we know it's probably a werewolf, but within the context of the film and the story, something like that is just too fantastic...that is, until Marty has a run in with the supernatural creature.  Barely escaping, whom can he tell?  His sister?  He does, to which she doesn't initially completely believe him, until she comes across proof herself.  Really, the only one they can turn to is Uncle Red, who thinks they're crazy, but is willing to go along if only to help placate his upset nephew and niece, and also, maybe because he still retains a bit of the ability to see the world through the eyes of a child, all the wondrous and horrific elements adults may not notice, as they're too consumed with the reality of life.  So a member of the town is a werewolf?  Possibly...you will probably figure it out well before the identity is revealed, and there is a certain amount of predictability inherent in the story, but neither of these elements seem to spoil the film any.  The effects within the film may not win anyone any awards, but they are adequate and even pretty good at some points, but since the story doesn't solely rely on this aspect, I had very little problems with it.  It's the characters in the story that enthralled me, and their very realistic and seemingly sincere relationships that sells this movie more than anything else for me.  I truly liked them, and found them wholly interesting, thus I was concerned and even scared for them, when danger presented itself.  I enjoyed all the characters here, but I thought Busey was particularly good, playing a role that probably fit his personality very well.  The movie has a lot of heart, while avoiding the mushiness that so often accompanies it.  Kind of strange to talk of such these with regards to a horror movie, but there you go.If you're a fan of special features, you'll be disappointed because there is really any, except maybe if you count English subtitles.  The wide screen anamorphic print looks good, although the audio seemed a bit soft at times.Cookieman108",4,"""What's a kid gonna shoot a silver .44 bullet at anyway?""",1092700800,"08 17,

It was kinda dumped into cinemas without much marketing and was four years behind the big grossing werewolf films of the 1980s - The Howling and An American Werewolf In London. The result was that it did not perform at the Box Office. That is a shame because it is a little gem of a film, and is a better film than An American Werewolf in London. In fact it is up there with The Howling as the best werewolf film of the 1980s.What makes Silver Bullet so good? It is based on Stephen King's short story The Cycle Of The Werewolf. King himself wrote the screenplay. The cast are very good in their roles and bring the tale to life with a result that you care for, and can identify with the characters as the tale unfolds. Corey Haim gives probably his best performance as the young crippled lad, Marty who has to face life (and a werewolf) in a wheel chair. Megan Follows turns in a great performance as his resentful sister Jane who is also the films narrator. Gary Busey is very good as Marty's sympathetic but alcoholic uncle. Sterling support from other actors such as Quest For Fire's Everett McGill who is superb as the town's creepy minister and Terry O'Quinlan who plays the town sheriff.This film version of a Stephen King book succeeds so well because it brings King's book to life on the screen in a way that so many other film adaptations of King books fail badly to do. It combines the horror with the realistic depiction of everyday life. Friendship, loyalty, drunkeness, pettiness, and bigotry all feature among the townsfolk. The support crippled Marty gets from family and friends contrasts with the attitude of his girlfriend's slob of a father who thinks that cripples sponge off the welfare and should be put down....This film succeeds where so many fail and that is to place Stephen King's warts and all depiction of humanity up there on the screen.The horror is well catered for, scenes with the werewolf are scary and gory. The beast itself is a huge monstrousity, well brought to life by SFX whizz Carlo Rambaldi who created ET.I do have a criticism of the dvd though and that is the mono sound. I am disappointed that if they could not put the film into 5.1, then the distributor could at least have given it a surround sound soundtrack.I do though recommend the film to anyone who likes the genre, plus any fan of Stephen King's books who would like to see a decent adaptation up there on the screen.",5,Underrated werewolf movie,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,2494,"['first', 'saw', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'cinema', '1986', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'kinda', 'dumped', 'cinemas', 'much', 'marketing', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'big', 'grossing', 'werewolf', 'films', '1980s', 'Howling', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'result', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'perform', 'Box', 'Office', 'shame', 'little', 'gem', 'film', 'better', 'film', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'fact', 'there', 'Howling', 'best', 'werewolf', 'film', '1980s.What', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'so', 'good', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'Cycle', 'Werewolf', 'King', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'bring', 'tale', 'life', 'result', 'care', 'can', 'identify', 'characters', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'young', 'crippled', 'lad', 'Marty', 'who', 'face', 'life', 'werewolf', 'wheel', 'chair', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'great', 'performance', 'resentful', 'sister', 'Jane', 'who', 'also', 'films', 'narrator', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'very', 'good', 'Marty', 'sympathetic', 'alcoholic', 'uncle', 'Sterling', 'support', 'other', 'actors', 'such', 'Quest', 'Fire', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'who', 'superb', 'town', 'creepy', 'minister', 'Terry', ""O'Quinlan"", 'who', 'town', 'sheriff.This', 'film', 'version', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'King', 'book', 'life', 'screen', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'King', 'books', 'fail', 'badly', 'do', 'horror', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'everyday', 'life', 'Friendship', 'loyalty', 'drunkeness', 'pettiness', 'bigotry', 'feature', 'townsfolk', 'support', 'crippled', 'Marty', 'family', 'friends', 'contrasts', 'attitude', 'girlfriend', 'slob', 'father', 'who', 'cripples', 'sponge', 'welfare', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'down', '.This', 'film', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'fail', 'place', 'Stephen', 'King', 'warts', 'depiction', 'humanity', 'up', 'there', 'screen.The', 'horror', 'well', 'catered', 'scenes', 'werewolf', 'are', 'scary', 'gory', 'beast', 'huge', 'monstrousity', 'well', 'brought', 'life', 'SFX', 'whizz', 'Carlo', 'Rambaldi', 'who', 'created', 'ET.I', 'do', 'have', 'criticism', 'dvd', 'mono', 'sound', 'am', 'disappointed', 'could', 'not', 'put', 'film', '5.1', 'then', 'distributor', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'given', 'surround', 'sound', 'soundtrack.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'genre', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'up', 'there', 'screen']",Silver Bullet VHS

It's not scary.  The wolf in question, more often than not, looks like a bear.  The acting is pitched a bit high, unnaturally high.  The dialog, courtesy of Stephen King, never seems genuine.  The people who populate this unreasonable locale are more than a little simplistic.  At times this place and these angry people feel so artificial you wonder if this wasn't meant to be a parody.  As for the story, there are plot devices aplenty that make no sense.  Instead of the obligatory bar brawl there's a bar ""yell"" (designed solely to introduce the town bully).  The local yokels form a bumbling/stumbling slapstick mob that takes to the woods........when all of the murders clearly took place IN THE TOWN!  (The werewolf even has the fortitude to climb a trellis to kill the second victim in her bedroom.)  And, for the umpteenth time, King takes another feeble potshot against Christianity and Christians (a main staple throughout his work).  We get it, you despise religion and take every opportunity to rail against what you perceive is the hypocrisy behind it or the people who are sometimes linked with it.  Snooze.  That rant is getting old, find something else to pick on.  Singing the same song gives you a reputation, it doesn't make you an expert.The weird part of all this is that I actually like this stupid movie.  I can't recall the number of times I've watched it (and will continue to watch it).  I have yet to figure that out, especially considering I am not a fan of Stephen King's work.

The leading sleuth is a young boy in a wheelchair (a very young Corey Haim) who thinks that things are quite amiss in the town, and, when his friend dies, he decides to take some action. Despite the amateurish aspects of the film, it was a campy, good time watching it. It was quite reminiscent of seeing some of the 50s B-movie horror flicks with monsters, UFOs, werewolves, and things that go bump in the night.Certainly this is not a great movie by any means, but anyone who is a horror movie junkie should check it out. It does have some mystery in its first half, where many of the townsfolk are in terror at the shock of the brutal murders of many of the people in town. Marty (Haim), who feels clued into what is going on,  tries to convince his sister and Uncle Red (played by none other than Gary Busey) that the murderer is in fact not a man, but a werewolf. At first they are reluctant to believe him, but eventually he shows them proof that this may be the case, and that, in fact, it may be one of the members of the community who is a werewolf.While some parts (like the one where we actually get to see the confrontation with the werewolf) might have you unintentionally laughing, this is still a pretty fun movie just for its story line and plot. It is pretty cheesy and campy at times, but given that this is based on a Stephen King novel, maybe that is fitting. I believe this is a better than average film for the horror buffs, but if you are a werewolf film connoisseur, expecting more suspense and horror, I think it would be better to go with either ""An American Werewolf in London"" or one of the old Lon Chaney Jr. classic films, ""The Wolf Man.""Still, that being said, it is definitely worth a viewing.3  stars",3,"Campy, but entertaining and fun",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,1999,"['As', 'strange', 'times', 'acting', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'sort', 'plays', 'out', 'feel', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'sleaze', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'B-movie', 'feel', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'werewolf', 'who', 'ravaging', 'small', 'town', 'leading', 'sleuth', 'young', 'boy', 'wheelchair', 'very', 'young', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'who', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'amiss', 'town', 'when', 'friend', 'take', 'action', 'amateurish', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'campy', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'was', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'seeing', '50s', 'B-movie', 'horror', 'flicks', 'monsters', 'UFOs', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night.Certainly', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'movie', 'junkie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'mystery', 'first', 'half', 'where', 'many', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'terror', 'shock', 'brutal', 'murders', 'many', 'people', 'town', 'Marty', 'Haim', 'who', 'clued', 'what', 'going', 'tries', 'convince', 'sister', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'murderer', 'fact', 'not', 'man', 'werewolf', 'first', 'are', 'reluctant', 'believe', 'eventually', 'proof', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'members', 'community', 'who', 'werewolf.While', 'parts', 'one', 'where', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'confrontation', 'werewolf', 'might', 'have', 'unintentionally', 'laughing', 'still', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie', 'just', 'story', 'line', 'plot', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'times', 'given', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'maybe', 'fitting', 'believe', 'better', 'average', 'film', 'horror', 'buffs', 'are', 'werewolf', 'film', 'connoisseur', 'expecting', 'more', 'suspense', 'horror', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'go', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'one', 'old', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'classic', 'films', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'Still', 'being', 'said', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing.3', 'stars']",Silver Bullet VHS

Anyway Corey and his sister find out that a local towns person is non other then a Werewolf who is stalking certain sinners in their town.

214495,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,6300214664,Genevieve Hayes,"[2, 2]","It was probably just the result of an excellent marketing campaign, but Stephen King is known around the world as THE Master of Horror. I've read a lot of Stephen King novels and seen even more movies based on them, and I have always felt that King achieves mixed results in his work. Some of it is excellent, and some of it leaves you feeling as though he lost interest in the story and just stopped writing. Hardly the work of a ""master"". However, the one thing that King does consistently succeed at is his portrayal of childhood. King has a talent for describing the childhood that you wish that you had. The best example of this is ""The Body"" (a novella contained inApt Pupil : A Novella in Different Seasons), which was turned into the movieStand By Me (Special Edition). A lesser known, but still equally excellent example is ""Silver Bullet"".""Silver Bullet"", loosely based on King's ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" and scripted by King, is the story of Marty Coslaw (played by Corey Haim when he was still young and cute), a young, wheelchair-bound, boy who becomes convinced that a werewolf is murdering people in his small town in Maine. Ultimately, he convinces his sister (played by Megan Follows of ""Anne of Green Gables"" fame) and uncle (Gary Busey) that what he believes is true and together they must defeat the werewolf before it gets them.Although ""Silver Bullet"" is an excellent horror movie that is still very watchable, even more than 20 years after it was made, it is as a film about people that this film excels. King insights into the relationship between brothers and sisters and into how things can change as people transition from childhood to adulthood are deeper than many that I have seen in award winning dramas.This is an intelligent movie that speaks, without condescension, to the child in all of us. I would recommend this film to all children, but since many people out there are, like me, no longer children, I recommend this film to all adults too, as a way of revisiting the childhood memories you wish you had.",5,I wish I had seen this when I was a kid.,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2041,"['was', 'probably', 'just', 'result', 'excellent', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'Stephen', 'King', 'known', 'world', 'Master', 'Horror', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'seen', 'even', 'more', 'movies', 'based', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'King', 'achieves', 'mixed', 'results', 'work', 'excellent', 'feeling', 'lost', 'interest', 'story', 'just', 'stopped', 'writing', 'Hardly', 'work', 'master', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'King', 'consistently', 'succeed', 'portrayal', 'childhood', 'King', 'talent', 'describing', 'childhood', 'wish', 'had', 'best', 'example', 'Body', 'novella', 'contained', 'inApt', 'Pupil', 'Novella', 'Different', 'Seasons', 'was', 'turned', 'movieStand', 'Me', 'Special', 'Edition', 'lesser', 'known', 'still', 'equally', 'excellent', 'example', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'loosely', 'based', 'King', 'Cycle', 'Werewolf', 'scripted', 'King', 'story', 'Marty', 'Coslaw', 'played', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'cute', 'young', 'wheelchair-bound', 'boy', 'who', 'convinced', 'werewolf', 'murdering', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'Ultimately', 'sister', 'played', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'fame', 'uncle', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'what', 'true', 'together', 'must', 'defeat', 'werewolf', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'excellent', 'horror', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'even', 'more', '20', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'people', 'film', 'excels', 'King', 'insights', 'relationship', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'how', 'things', 'can', 'change', 'people', 'transition', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'are', 'deeper', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'award', 'winning', 'dramas.This', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'condescension', 'child', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'children', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'children', 'recommend', 'film', 'adults', 'too', 'way', 'revisiting', 'childhood', 'memories', 'wish', 'had']",Silver Bullet VHS

214503,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6300214664,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","Tarver's Mills is a quiet little town like most other quiet little towns. Then, one night, the homicides begin. The hometown police are perplexed and the citizens grow ever more frightened. Young, crippled Marty Coslaw (Corey Haim) and his resentful sister Jane (Megan Follows) come to suspect that a werewolf is loose in their midst, committing these acts of murder. They enlist the aid of their drunken, initially skeptic Uncle Red (Gary Busey) and soon, all three find themselves in the deadliest of peril as they attempt to thwart the ravening creature of the night.This movie is based on Stephen King's novella ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" and Stephen himself writes the screenplay. Silver Bullet is a very nice, little spookfilm and should be watched on a dark, rainy evening. Characterization is what drives this unassuming horror picture. The performance of the cast raises Silver Bullet above the other, more derivative lycanthropic shockers. Sadly, Corey Haim is an example of an actor who peaked way too early. It's indicative of his gone-to-seed movie career that his best films are Silver Bullet and The Lost Boys, both pictures taking place before Haim was seventeen. As the focus of Silver Bullet, Haim is sincere and real in his depiction of wheelchaired Marty Coslaw. Megan Follows is simply perfect as Jane, Marty's put-upon sister. Haim and Follows embody the typical quarrelsome sibling relationship of most families (Marty plays pranks on Jane; Jane calls Marty ""Booger""). But when the chips are down, they stick together. Throw their Uncle Red into that family dynamic, also. Uncle Red as winningly played by Gary Busey is the go-to adult, who is often inebriated but has enough childlike sensibilities in him to relate well to the Coslaw kids. Everett McGill, however, is exceedingly creepy as the town reverend.The movie is simple, straightforward and doesn't try to fool anyone. The storytelling is really well done; the film takes great pains to fill in character backgrounds and then scarily ups the ante during the tension-filled scenes.  The special effects are modest but effective. The werewolf isn't cheesy-looking at all; it is, instead, suitably fearsome and gory. The werewolf transformation at the end is pretty cool, even now. The narrative voice-over (an older Jane) adds emotional gravitas to the little film. So, c'mon, give this one a try.

214504,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6300214664,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","The movie ""Silver Bullet"" is a pretty decent to good werewolf movie.  The movie starts with a man being killed on the railroad by some unknown beast, but no one thought anything of that because the man was a drunk, but when a young lady is killed in an absolutely brutal murder by this same beast, people begin to suspect a brutal serial killer is on the loose.People are killed on a regular basis in this movie, but when the child named Grady is murdered, things really hit home with the main characters in this movie.  Marty, played quite well by Corey Haim, is a parapalegic whom becomes quite upset when his friend Grady is killed.  He suspects that maybe it is a monster.  Finally, a search team of beer bellies with shotguns go out into the woods looking for this killer and most, if not all of them are viciously killed by this beast.A curfew is put into effect by the local sheriff.  However, Marty unwittingly decides to celebrate the 4th of July out on the bridge late one night out in the middle of nowhere.  The werewolf shows himself to Marty and it appears that it is going to kill him, but Marty is able to shoot a rocket into the werewolf's eye and escape.  At this time, Marty faces the indellible task of convincing someone that he did indeed see a werewolf, but not only that, Marty must discover the werewolf's identity and kill him before the werewolf gets Marty.The acting in this movie is terrific with Gary Busey playing an alcoholic and comical uncle of Marty's.  The directing is also good and I think the storyline pretty good as well.  The weaknesses of this movie really inhere in the fact that the ending is kind of weak and the werewolf doesn't look as realistic as it could have.  Also, the comedy element takes away from the effectiveness of this movie as a horror flick.  Finally, the death scenes are poor except for a couple including the young lady killed in her bedroom.  Indeed, ""The Silver Bullet"" is a pretty good movie overall with some elements of horror, but the atmosphere of this movie fails fairly convincingly to present that critical element of fear and horror in the audience which is so absolutely essential in creating a successful and effective horror movie...that is the crucial point where this movie is clearly flawed as a horror movie.

214505,A319SKSB556033,6300214664,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 4]","Silver Bullet is my favorite of Steven King's horror adaptations (yes, I do like this better than The Shining) . King even penned the screenplay himself (from his short story 'The Cycle of the Werewolf'), but since he was also responsible for the awful Maximum Overdrive, that's no solid proof of quality. But it a damn cool movie.What makes it so different and unique is that it's horror movie told from a child's perspective (though I admit that the retrospective narration seems out of place) and has a brother/sister dynamic that's quite cute and makes you really care for the characters.Corey Haim plays Marty Coslaw, a young boy who is confined to a wheelchair for reasons unknown. His older sister Jane is forced to take care of him and throws tantrums whenever the mum and dad take Marty's side (which is always). But the chair doesn't stop Marty from being mischievous. Especially when his manic, reckless Uncle Red (a fat Gary Busey-absolutely brilliant, as always) builds him a motorized wheelchair/bike called the Silver Bullet.There is killer in their small town who strikes every month when the moon is full. The townsfolk gradually become more and more weary as autumn rolls on and Marty takes a personal offence when his best friend is murdered, his best girl is run out of town and a fireworks display is cancelled. Then he witnesses what the killer really is. But who is going to believe a kid's story of a werewolf? Despite the red-herrings, it's easy to figure out who it is before the main revelation. But it's still a fun mystery.Filmed with the little-used JDC-Scope process, Silver Bullet has brilliant cinematography by Armando Nannuzzi and a wonderful score by Jay Chattaway. There's not much horror to it, but I don't think it was ever the intention to dwell on the violence. Even though I would call this film suitable for kids (despite the 18/R-rating) it's still way better than the PG-13 junk we get these days.The film is also notable for Everett McGill (so evil as the baddie in Under Siege 2), an under-rated and under-used actor in a typically eccentric role as a charismatic Reverend.

The trick of the film, that I cannot reveal, is that the werewolf is THE person no one would suspect. The great merit of the film is that the werewolf is killed by a young handicapped boy and by his sister, with the help of their uncle and a silver bullet, of course. This executioning team is not a surprise in Stephen King's world of suspense. There is somewhere in his world the belief that only people who believe in dreams and nightmares, i.e. children, can confront and destroy evil in this world. The theme of the handicapped person at the center of the tale is common in King's books and many have to be quoted :  The Talisman ,  The Stand , for example. We could do the same thing with girls :  Carrie ,  The Firestarter , for two. The only shortcoming of the film is that we do not feel the twelve month cycle of the original novella that was written for a special calendar. But I guess this is not very important here. We can also regret the systematic compliance of King with the tradition when he deals with monsters like vampires or werewolves, and lately extraterrestrials. They are monsters, and nothing else, that have to be destroyed. There is never any kind of second vision, regeneration, epiphany. So don't look for any deviation from the normal course of such a story.

If your going to use a hunting dog to hunt Werewolves, I'll take a Dane any day!

214512,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6300214664,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[17, 18]","In Stephen King's thrilling adaptation of his novelette ""Cycle of the Werewolf"", the peaceful town of Tarker's Mills is suddenly terrorized by a maniacal killer.Corey Haim stars as Marty Coslaw, a wheelchair-bound eleven-year-old.  Megan Follows stars as Jane Coslaw, Marty's fifteen-year-old sister, who serves as the narrator of the movie.  Although Jane and Marty have their occasional brother-sister battles, they do genuinely care about each other, and this bond is shown throughout the movie.  Gary Busey stars as Uncle Red, Jane and Marty's alcoholic but caring uncle. Finally, Everett McGill stars as Reverend Lowe, pastor of the local church.Tarker's Mills is a peaceful town until a string of brutal and unsolved murders begin to take place.  At first, the townsfolk think a madman is on the loose.  Sheriff Joe Haller (Terry O'Quinn) is facing the wrath of the townspeople for his lack of urgency in solving the murders.  Unfortunately, Marty's best friend Brady Kincaid (Joe Wright) is one of the victims.  After Brady's murder, the townspeople decide they have had enough of the sheriff's lack of success in finding the killer, so they try their own brand of vigilante justice.  Unfortunately, this ends in disaster.After Brady's funeral, Marty begins to have suspicions about the killer.  He raises the possibility of a werewolf as being responsible to uncle Red, who justs laughs it off as totally crazy.  However, Marty is undeterred in his belief.  After the rash of murders, the town's carnival is cancelled.  Uncle Red gives Marty some fireworks as a gift, but tells him he must use them near his house.  Of course, an eleven-year-old boy with a new souped-up wheelchair isn't likely to follow directions from adults, so he heads off to a remote bridge to enjoy his fireworks.  Upon reaching the bridge, he hears rustles and movement in the surrounding woods.  In an instant, Marty comes face-to-face with a huge werewolf; just as he suspected.  He uses his last rocket to shoot at the werewolf, and it hits the wolf directly in the eye.  Marty manages to high-tail it out of there before the werewolf can regroup.Upon reaching home, he tells his story to Jane, who is somewhat skeptical, but this time she believes her brother.  She is assigned to pick up cans and bottles for a church fund-raiser, and while she's out, she decides to look for someone who has a hurt eye.  You'll never guess who she discovers wearing an eyepatch.  Will the werewolf succeed in catching Marty, or will he and Jane outsmart the wolf?This is a very good movie.  Stephen King wrote an excellent screenplay, and veteran director Dino De Laurentis does a fine job in bringing King's story to life.  Corey Haim and Megan Follows do fine jobs as Marty and Jane, but Gary Busey's performance as Uncle Red is the highlight of the movie.I give this film my highest recommendation.  The acting is good, and the story is well-developed.  Horror fans (namely Stephen King fans) will surely enjoy this great werewolf film.

Helping along the way are Gary Busey as Marty Coslaw's (Corey Haim) Uncle Red, Megan Follows as Marty's sister Jane, and Everett McGill as creepy Reverend Lowe.There are murders happening in and around town, and Marty is convinced it is the work of a werewolf, with whom he has a close encounter; a really close encounter. At first no one believes Marty, as you would expect, but then Jane is convinced. Finally Uncle Red is sort of convinced. The tension builds until the night that Jane and Marty's parents are away from home and Uncle Red stays with Marty, Jane, and a single silver bullet.While there are other werewolf movies with a higher scare factor, this one remains one of my favorites. I will watch this movie sooner than many others just because it is familiar and the characters are generally likable. It is like a cartoon in many ways, but these same qualities make it an easy to watch movie. There are a few intense moments to spike up the movie, including the encounter between Marty and the werewolf on an isolated walking bridge at night in the country, another encounter between a group of citizens out to hunt the murderer, and encounters between the werewolf in his human form and Jane and Marty.This movie is a must have for Stephen King fans as well as those who have a penchant for people who change into furry creatures.",4,Entertaining,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1575,"['movie', 'few', 'bone', 'chilling', 'moments', 'quot', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'quot', 'quot', 'Howling', 'quot', 'still', 'moments', 'where', 'fascinating', 'least', 'couple', 'places', 'where', 'tension', 'Helping', 'way', 'are', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Marty', 'Coslaw', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Marty', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'creepy', 'Reverend', 'Lowe.There', 'are', 'murders', 'happening', 'town', 'Marty', 'convinced', 'work', 'werewolf', 'whom', 'close', 'encounter', 'really', 'close', 'encounter', 'first', 'one', 'Marty', 'would', 'expect', 'then', 'Jane', 'convinced', 'Finally', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'sort', 'convinced', 'tension', 'night', 'Jane', 'Marty', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'home', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'Marty', 'Jane', 'single', 'silver', 'are', 'other', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'higher', 'scare', 'factor', 'one', 'one', 'favorites', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'sooner', 'many', 'others', 'just', 'familiar', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'likable', 'cartoon', 'many', 'ways', 'same', 'qualities', 'make', 'easy', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'intense', 'moments', 'spike', 'up', 'movie', 'including', 'encounter', 'Marty', 'werewolf', 'isolated', 'walking', 'bridge', 'night', 'country', 'encounter', 'group', 'citizens', 'hunt', 'murderer', 'encounters', 'werewolf', 'human', 'form', 'Jane', 'Marty.This', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'have', 'penchant', 'people', 'who', 'change', 'furry', 'creatures']",Silver Bullet VHS

This review contains some very limited SPOILERS.""The cycle of werewolf"" describes a small town in Maine haunted at every full moon by a ferocious werewolf and the film begins mostly faithfully to the book. However, very fast the director decided to change things, in my modest opinion without any real reason. Like in the book, the main hero, 11-years old Marty Coslaw, has lost the use of his legs and is bound to a wheelchair, but unlike in the book here he receives a big sister, who becomes the narrator of the story.There is also less victims than in the book and the human identity of the werewolf is revealed too early in the film. In the book, which covers one year, it occurs on 31 October - here, not only the story is shortened, but the solution to the main mystery also comes much faster. The special effects are not really very good and the incredible strength and great speed of the werewolf, which were so chillingly described in the book, are here missing in action. Finally, in the book the werewolf sometimes played a little with his victims, displaying occasionally some sadistic, depraved sense of humor, which made it even scarier - here this element is absent.Actors however are very good. Young Corey Haim did a darn good job as Marty and Megan Follows is excellent as his big sister Jane. But the real star is of course Gary Busey as Marty's heavy drinking and not very recommendable uncle. Everett McGill, who did such a great job in ""Quest for fire"", ""Dune"" and ""Twin Peaks"", is also excellent as a young local pastor, who desperately strives to keep his faith and sanity when his flock is being slowly devoured by a Beast from Hell...All in all, it is a honest little horror, not too gory and not too scary - but absolutely nowhere near the quality of the original book.

The 80's synthesizer track used here does little to add mood and dates the film. The werewolf make-up is hit or miss here as sometimes with the use of shadows the werewolf looks pretty darn good and other times he looks a little like Smokey the Bear.The acting is above average for this type of film and Gary Busey is always welcome in these crazy little films. I also liked that this werewolf picked his victims for reasons sometimes and they were not just all random. One of the biggest flaws is it is a little too easy to figure out who the werewolf is and that is one major setback. Even my wife who had never seen this film and isn't a really big horror fans said ""that guy looks like a werewolf""!

Mutilated corpses begin to turn up and a curfew is administered upon the residents of Tarker's Mills. One crippled boy nevertheless decides to ignore the curfew - which led to the cancellation of the Fourth of July Fireworks - and meets the mysterious murderer face-to-face one night. So begins a quest to discover the true idenity of this monster.Daniel Attias has produced one of the creepiest Stephen King films ever with 'Silver Bullet'. The screenplay (written by King) is an adaptation of his novella, 'Cycle of the Werewolf', about a lycanthrope who hunts down the townspeople of Tarker Mills. The film is well paced and has a 'whodunnit' feel, as well as plenty of extremely scary moments that will ensure you do not head for the 'eject' button, feeling you have wasted your hard earned dollars.Moreover, there is a great cast here, headed by veteran actor Gary 'Point Break' Busey, Corey 'The Lost Boys' Haim, and Terry 'The Stepfather' O'Quinn.I first watched this film when it came out for rental in the mid-eighties and it scared the bejezus out of me.

Originally released in 1985, Silver Bullet is based on a novelette created by horror writer Steven King in which a young boy (Cory Haim) discovers the grizzly murders happening in his sleepy little town are actually the result of a werewolf. A sharp contrast to the majority of horror movies being released at the time, Silver Bullet was not filled with sex crazed teenagers being killed off one by one. If you can imagine the concept, this horror movie actually tries to highlight the love of family and unbreakable spirit of youth. This is most definitely shown in the relationship between the character Marty and his sister and uncle. That said, this movie is not lacking in the scare department either. There are several sequences in this movie to make even the most jaded of horror fans jump in anticipation. And the best part of this film is: it's always fun to watch! How many movies can guarantee that? So as a movie, Silver Bullet will bring constant entertainment. Unfortunately as a DVD release, the entertainment quotient is only marginal. Silver Bullet was actually released on DVD in 2001 for countries belonging to Region 2 (U.K.) and with a few items that are not released on the U.S./Canadian release. Those features being: the original movie trailer and director commentary by Daniel Attias. Though those great features are not on this release, we are benefitted with Dolby Sterio, Widescreen/Letterbox, Chapter Selection, Close Captioning and subtitles in English and French. So although I'm overjoyed that I get to see this great movie in DVD quality and sound, I'm also from the camp that expects movies that are released on DVD to supply the viewing audience with special features that are not normally included on a general video release. ie. original trailer, actor/director commentary, cast bios, behind the scenes/making of featurette, deleted scenes, interviews, etc. It's because of this that I hesitantly give the DVD release only 4 stars instead of 5.",4,One of the Best Werewolf Movies Ever Made,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2096,"['Words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'joy', 'received', 'when', 'discovered', 'movie', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Originally', 'released', '1985', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'based', 'novelette', 'created', 'horror', 'writer', 'Steven', 'King', 'young', 'boy', 'Cory', 'Haim', 'grizzly', 'murders', 'happening', 'sleepy', 'little', 'town', 'are', 'actually', 'result', 'werewolf', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'majority', 'horror', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'was', 'not', 'filled', 'sex', 'crazed', 'teenagers', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'concept', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', 'highlight', 'love', 'family', 'unbreakable', 'spirit', 'youth', 'most', 'definitely', 'shown', 'relationship', 'character', 'Marty', 'sister', 'uncle', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'lacking', 'scare', 'department', 'either', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'movie', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'horror', 'fans', 'jump', 'anticipation', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'guarantee', 'So', 'movie', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'will', 'bring', 'constant', 'entertainment', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'release', 'entertainment', 'quotient', 'only', 'marginal', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'DVD', '2001', 'countries', 'belonging', 'Region', '2', 'U.K.', 'few', 'items', 'are', 'not', 'released', 'U.S./Canadian', 'release', 'features', 'being', 'original', 'movie', 'trailer', 'director', 'commentary', 'Daniel', 'Attias', 'great', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'release', 'are', 'benefitted', 'Dolby', 'Sterio', 'Widescreen/Letterbox', 'Chapter', 'Selection', 'Close', 'Captioning', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', ""'m"", 'overjoyed', 'get', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'quality', 'sound', ""'m"", 'also', 'camp', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'DVD', 'supply', 'viewing', 'audience', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'normally', 'included', 'general', 'video', 'release', 'ie', 'original', 'trailer', 'actor/director', 'commentary', 'cast', 'bios', 'scenes/making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'etc', 'hesitantly', 'give', 'DVD', 'release', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5']",Silver Bullet VHS

After the movie, while we were all loading back into the church van, our pastor walks up wearing an eye patch.  Now that was classic!  Out of this trip to the movies, I became hooked on all things Stephen King.  Today, I own all his books in hard back and all the videos made from his works.  I hope that lends some credibility to me when I make the statement &quot;This is one of the best Stephen King films&quot;.  Corey Haim is excellent as Marty (a wheel chair bound pre teen),  Gary Busey is hilarious and steals the show as Uncle Red (who builds Marty a wheel chair that is faster than my car). Everett McGill plays the pastor and the turmoil of his character is evident and well protrayed.  The special effect are very good considering the time period, with the ending sequence when the werewolf is killed still among the best of all werewolf movies.

Stephen King adapted his novella Cycle of the Werewolf to be even bloodier and more terrifying on screen.  Changing such things as the body count to the lunar cycle restraints for the Werewolf's savage killings King made an extremely entertaining Werewolf film possible.  The film is a bit dated in the special effects department, but for some reason that only adds to the appeal.  Knowing that at the time it was filmed the effects were top notch and the story keeping to key elements of the novella.  Such as who the Werewolf is and that the protagonist, Marty is still a parapalegic.  Great performances by Gary Busey as &quot;cool&quot; Uncle Red and Everett McGill (later to be seen in Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs).  The atmosphere and small town element are two of King's endearing qualities as a writer, he really can write about a tightly knit community.  Some really graphic death scenes and a sometime silly looking/sometime frightening Werewolf make this a perrenial favorite of any Horror film buff!  I recommend buying and reading Cycle of the Werewolf and then buying Silver Bullet.  For Horror fans, for Stephen King fans, and for movie fans in general this a great way to kill a rainy afternoon or a dark October night.&quot;What the heck you gonna shoot a .44 bullet at anyway, made out of silver?&quot;&quot;How 'bout a Werewolf?&quot;",5,&quot;Watch Out For The Werewolf&quot;,971913600,"10 19, 2000",2000,1529,"['Silver', 'Bullet', 'essential', 'Halloween', 'time', 'viewing', 'watching', 'television', 'edited', 'content', 'course', 'years', 'finally', 'decided', 'just', 'buy', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adapted', 'novella', 'Cycle', 'Werewolf', 'be', 'even', 'bloodier', 'more', 'terrifying', 'screen', 'Changing', 'such', 'things', 'body', 'count', 'lunar', 'cycle', 'restraints', 'Werewolf', 'savage', 'killings', 'King', 'made', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Werewolf', 'film', 'possible', 'film', 'bit', 'dated', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'reason', 'only', 'appeal', 'Knowing', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'effects', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'keeping', 'key', 'elements', 'novella', 'Such', 'who', 'Werewolf', 'protagonist', 'Marty', 'still', 'parapalegic', 'Great', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'quot', 'cool', 'quot', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'later', 'be', 'seen', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'People', 'Stairs', 'atmosphere', 'small', 'town', 'element', 'are', 'two', 'King', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'writer', 'really', 'can', 'write', 'tightly', 'knit', 'community', 'really', 'graphic', 'death', 'scenes', 'sometime', 'silly', 'looking/sometime', 'frightening', 'Werewolf', 'make', 'perrenial', 'favorite', 'Horror', 'film', 'buff', 'recommend', 'buying', 'reading', 'Cycle', 'Werewolf', 'then', 'buying', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'Horror', 'fans', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fans', 'movie', 'fans', 'general', 'great', 'way', 'kill', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'dark', 'October', 'night.', 'quot', 'What', 'heck', 'gon', 'shoot', '.44', 'bullet', 'anyway', 'made', 'silver', 'quot', 'quot', 'How', 'Werewolf', 'quot']",Silver Bullet VHS

What could be worse then having a huge, fast, blood thirsty man beast hunting you down? On top of there size and other beastly features they can sniff you out no matter where you try to hide. That's certainly enough reason to fear the wolfman also making him a must during Sid's personal horror film festival (this being the 10th on the season). Now there's a lot out there in the wolf department but when given the option to see a young Corey Haim team up with Gary Busey there really was no other choice as far as we're concerned.Silver Bullet takes place in the small town of Tarker's Mill that seems to have nothing interesting going on. Marty Coslaw (Corey Haim) is a young handicapped kid who lives at home with his parents and sister and is viewed as helpless. We'd have to suspect his experience from playing a paraplegic here helped him very much today when he pretends to be a crippled war vet begging for change outside a local diner. Anyway, a lot of extreme murders begin to take place putting the towns folk in fear. As they hunt for the killer it is soon discovered by Marty that a werewolf is doing the murders. So naturally his first option is to enlist the help of his drunk uncle Red (Busey). With a team compiled of a handicapped kid, his sister, and wasted uncle Busey how can you go wrong?Despite the jokes Silver Bullet was a killer flick packed with some great wolf action and laughs. Unlike most, this one doesn't waste anytime with the wolf as we see a decapitation within the first 3 mins! That right there is something revered by Sid in any film. Not only was the werewolf kick a** but Gary Busey is so entertaining to watch. Especially when he builds his nephew a motorcycle wheel chair to tear around town in. Sure came in handy when he had to run from the werewolf. This one is a great choice for any fan of the genre especially if you want to see a still somewhat sane Busey on screen. Even have to give it to Haim to was really good too. Unfortunately seems he shot all his talent away early on leaving him too bad to even get cast in a horrible B.

Hill ""Owner of shillpages.com""","[31, 31]","You don't normally expect to find well-crafted characters in horror movies, which is why SILVER BULLET can catch a first-time viewer by surprise. There are suspenseful scenes aplenty, but it really is the characters and their relationships that make this movie stand out. Corey Haim is Marty, eleven years old and reliant on a motorized wheelchair to get around. Megan Follows is his fifteen year old sister Jane, jealous of the special attention her brother gets because of his disability. Their parents are Bob and Nan, and Nan's brother is played by Gary Busey. Uncle Red is the sort of relative that families are not proud of and would probably rather not associate with at all; it's unfortunate for Nan then that Red loves his nephew Marty so much.Marty is just getting old enough to realise that Red isn't exactly an exemplary human being. Early in the film a friend of Marty's scares Jane with a snake, causing her to fall flat in a puddle of muddy water and ruin the outfit she's been showing off. It's the sort of prank that a brother would pull on a sister and then immediately regret it, and Marty's face shows the regret not only at that moment, but later at night when he gives Jane money to help make up for it even though it wasn't his fault. At that point she apologises for verbally wounding Marty in retaliation by telling him that Uncle Red, his idol, is a useless drunk.Because Marty gets preferential treatment from everyone, Jane always feels like she gets no attention, and that carries over to some of the reviews on this site that mention she's a minor character. The importance of her character (especially as the emotional center of the film) is too easily overlooked. When Marty confesses his nighttime encounter with a werewolf to her, she believes him enough to help look for evidence the next day, and her experience leaves her utterly convinced that Marty's story is the truth. At that point the familial relationship between brother and sister (and eventually Uncle Red) begins to strengthen until it reaches its peak at the film's very end with a heartfelt and touching (and not at all saccharine) piece of narration. The movie is narrated by Tovah Feldshuh as a grown-up Jane, and it takes place in the summer of 1976 (just ignore those anachronistic Diet Coke cans in the garage). It's a combination of the beautifully-done narration, the unusually romantic score and the genuinely good acting and interaction between the leads (Haim, Everett McGill as the town's concerned Reverend Lowe, and especially Follows and Busey) that gives the movie an almost lyrical sweetness that not only is unexpected from a low-budget horror movie but also quite simply *works*.This DVD edition is quite nice in the area of picture quality. Anamorphic widescreen at about 2.35:1, good contrast and sharpness, nothing distracting like severe edge enhancement or anything. A very pleasing image. Sound is good too... but the disc falls flat in the area of extras. Basically, there aren't ANY. One wishes they could have included the commentary that comes with the R2 edition (I believe).

I remember liking it then as a kid, but I had my doubts that I would have the same feelings about it now. In short, I was pretty right about that assumption. This movie wasn't a good as I thought it once was. Though its not a bad film, I just really couldn't get into it. The film is about a paralyzed boy that discovers that the town's reverend is actually a werewolf and that he has been responsible for a number of gruesome murders recently. With the help of his sister and his Uncle Red, they set out to kill the beast before it gets them! The basic story was decent, but there was just too many little unrealistic things that just take away from the film. Things like, oh, say a kid being able to shoot a firework DIRECTLY into a eye of a werewolf, perhaps? And then at the end of the film, being able to do the exact same thing with a gun, and make another direct hit in the other eye?? Are you kidding me? Ah, I know what you're saying..its just a movie, right? But things like this just get to me. Another thing that pissed me off was that the film didn't bother showing the dead body of the boy Brady, the main character's friend in the film. Here's the movie's chance to really do something and shock the audience by showing a dead kid, but they take the high road and don't show anything except a bloody kite..wow..scary. I can't stand when movies hold back punches, either by not having kids die in a film or not showing a kid's death. I guess I'm just a sick kinda of a guy, but I want a horror film thats not afraid to do stuff like that. Another thing I thought was dumb was that the werewolf actually used a baseball bat to kill two of its victims, which look totally ridiculous. The special effects in this film were hit and miss, in my opinion. Some of the death scenes, especially the first of the railroad worker, were pretty good. Other scenes, like the group of rednecks out in the fog getting taken out one by one by the werewolf, just looked silly. The transformation sequences were alright, but when the actual werewolf is show, it looks more like a bear than anything. Anyway, despite some of these flaws, this is still an ok little werewolf movie, but its nothing special. Its certainly not a American Werewolf in London or anything like that, but for a cheap price, its worth buying.",3,An OK Werewolf Movie,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2366,"['had', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'watched', 'film', 'remember', 'liking', 'then', 'kid', 'had', 'doubts', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'feelings', 'now', 'short', 'was', 'pretty', 'right', 'assumption', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'thought', 'once', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'paralyzed', 'boy', 'town', 'reverend', 'actually', 'werewolf', 'been', 'responsible', 'number', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'recently', 'help', 'sister', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'set', 'out', 'kill', 'beast', 'basic', 'story', 'was', 'decent', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'just', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'Things', 'oh', 'say', 'kid', 'being', 'able', 'shoot', 'firework', 'DIRECTLY', 'eye', 'werewolf', 'perhaps', 'then', 'end', 'film', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'gun', 'make', 'direct', 'hit', 'other', 'eye', 'Are', 'kidding', 'Ah', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying..its', 'just', 'movie', 'right', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'thing', 'pissed', 'off', 'was', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'showing', 'dead', 'body', 'boy', 'Brady', 'main', 'character', 'friend', 'film', 'Here', 'movie', 'chance', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'shock', 'audience', 'showing', 'dead', 'kid', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', 'bloody', 'kite..wow..scary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'when', 'movies', 'hold', 'back', 'punches', 'either', 'not', 'having', 'kids', 'die', 'film', 'not', 'showing', 'kid', 'death', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'sick', 'kinda', 'guy', 'want', 'horror', 'film', 'thats', 'not', 'afraid', 'do', 'stuff', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'dumb', 'was', 'werewolf', 'actually', 'used', 'baseball', 'bat', 'kill', 'two', 'victims', 'look', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'were', 'hit', 'miss', 'opinion', 'death', 'scenes', 'especially', 'first', 'railroad', 'worker', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Other', 'scenes', 'group', 'rednecks', 'out', 'fog', 'getting', 'taken', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'werewolf', 'just', 'looked', 'silly', 'transformation', 'sequences', 'were', 'alright', 'when', 'actual', 'werewolf', 'show', 'more', 'bear', 'anything', 'Anyway', 'flaws', 'still', 'ok', 'little', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'nothing', 'special', 'certainly', 'not', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'anything', 'cheap', 'price', 'worth', 'buying']",Silver Bullet VHS

Only a few survive, which cancels the rest of the town's celebrations for Independence Day. Uncle Red announces that he has to go back, leaving Marty by himself. That night, he sneaks out and shoots off some fireworks and finds out that the killer is a werewolf. Wounding the werewolf, he asks his sister Jane (Megan Follows) to go around town looking for people with an eye-patch. Only one person has one, Reverend Lowe (Everett McGill). Convinced that he is right, Jane agrees to help him solve the mystery in the town and find the real killer werewolf.Watchable, but fairly simple horror fare adapted from the Stephen King novella that uses standardized werewolf myths, kind of like King's use of vampires in ""Salem's Lot""; the werewolf morphs during full moons, for example, and can be killed by a silver bullet (hence the title). The identity of the werewolf is concealed throughout the movie, although it isn't difficult to work out and like in a plethora of horror flicks, the authorities just don't believe in werewolf-type things and the pesky kids are left to work out who it is and put an end to their evil deeds (ho hum).  The horror scenes are quite graphic and bloody, given the rating and that it's probably aimed at the teen market; there is enough there to at least bate the breath of the seasoned fan of the genre; however, the rest of the movie has the feel of a soap opera or HBO family flick, which makes the gore seem a little out of place. Gary Busey is likeable as the cheerful and bustling uncle, who drinks more than he should, while Corey Haim and Megan Follows do the all-American kid thing quite well (sorry Megan, I know you're Canadian) with their pleasant mix of cheesy smiles, fatalistic curiosity and a little brother-sister tension thrown into the mix. Haim's character is wheelchair-bound, and although the psychological ramifications of this aren't well explored, at least Busey builds him nice motorized hot-rod type.

Well, I always thought it was boring, but I kept watching it so I wouldn't feel bad that I spent 15 dollars on it. Well, I've finally come to terms with myself, and I'm going to get rid of it. Stephen King is a phenomenal writer, he's written some of the scariest stuff to ever hit the printing press. But this garbage, it just sucks. The werewolf transformations suck (just more proof that just because a movie is more recent, doesn't mean its more realistic); absolutely nothing compared to The Howling or AWiL. The dumb narration doesn't work, it makes it feel more like a drama than a horror (narration only works when the narrator has a dark, brooding voice, such as the voice of Vincent Price or the guy who narrated Black Sunday in the beginning), and it is simply not scary. Thats its biggest flaw, of course, it being a horror movie. I never care about great performances (unless the acting is just obviously terrible, and you can tell there is a camera being shoved in their face; i.e. Sorority House Massacre 2), but a movie has to at least be creepy. This trash can't even manage to do that. I'm not so sure it even takes itself seriously with all of the dumb dialogue (Ya gonna make lemonade in ya pants or what?). This movie fails as a teen drama, a comedy, and most importantly, a horror film.

The best aspect of the movie was the performance of Gary Busey as the uncle, who managed to bring a little life to this otherwise mundane ""horror"" flick.  Uncle Red (Busey), however, ""miraculously"" recovers from his extreme alcoholism as the movie progressives.  There is no explanation for this; he just turns out to be the one, really good guy with any intelligence in the entire movie; the one adult who first comes to believe his nephew.  Silver Bullet is, like so many movies of this type, full of massive numbers of logical errors and dead giveaways when it comes to the who-dunnit, who-is-it part.

This movie was made in 1985 and some of the production qualities are predictably dated, yet I found it as engaging as when I first watched it.Part of the attraction in this story lies in its strong casting. Corey Haim plays young Marty Coslaw who has been unable to walk since infancy. He is a likable character and had me rooting for him throughout the movie. Corey's older sister, Jane is credibly portrayed by Megan Follows (one of my favorite actors since I watched her performance in theAnne of Green Gables: The Collectionseries).Life in Corey's little town somewhere in Maine is quite idyllic until strange deaths occur. A decapitated man found on the railroad tracks is attributed to an accident, and many other gruesome deaths follow, until even the townspeople begin to wonder what is going on. Unfortunately, Corey finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time one night, and the scene is set for a confrontation between Corey and the otherworldly creature responsible for these murders, i.e. a werewolf.The actor playing the villain does a great job in convincing viewers of his wicked, bestial nature even when in adult form. Terry O'Quinn from the seriesMillennium: The Complete DVD Collectionplays the small-town sheriff who tries in vain to find the murderer until it is too late. Then there's Gary Busey! He plays Corey's goofball Uncle Red who builds a special motorized scooter/wheelchair that enables Corey to move fast from one place to another, and it's aptly called The Silver Bullet:) This movie is great fun for the whole family (though because of its content, it is suited more for ages 10 and up).",4,"Dated, yet still engaging werewolf story",1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1737,"['been', 'many', 'years', 'watched', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'production', 'qualities', 'are', 'predictably', 'dated', 'yet', 'found', 'as', 'engaging', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'it.Part', 'attraction', 'story', 'strong', 'casting', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'young', 'Marty', 'Coslaw', 'who', 'been', 'unable', 'walk', 'infancy', 'likable', 'character', 'had', 'rooting', 'movie', 'Corey', 'older', 'sister', 'Jane', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'watched', 'performance', 'theAnne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Collectionseries', '.Life', 'Corey', 'little', 'town', 'somewhere', 'Maine', 'quite', 'idyllic', 'strange', 'deaths', 'occur', 'decapitated', 'man', 'found', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'attributed', 'accident', 'many', 'other', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'follow', 'even', 'townspeople', 'begin', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'Corey', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'one', 'night', 'scene', 'set', 'confrontation', 'Corey', 'otherworldly', 'creature', 'responsible', 'murders', 'i.e', 'werewolf.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'villain', 'great', 'job', 'convincing', 'viewers', 'wicked', 'bestial', 'nature', 'even', 'when', 'adult', 'form', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'seriesMillennium', 'Complete', 'DVD', 'small-town', 'sheriff', 'who', 'vain', 'find', 'murderer', 'too', 'late', 'Then', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Corey', 'goofball', 'Uncle', 'Red', 'who', 'special', 'motorized', 'scooter/wheelchair', 'Corey', 'move', 'fast', 'one', 'place', 'aptly', 'called', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'content', 'suited', 'more', 'ages', '10', 'up']",Silver Bullet VHS
