I only wish the DVD came with an interview of the real Marva Collins, or at the least, a copy of the TV 60 Minutes story which is only 15 minutes long.Also, if the DVD came had a Spanish option, it would reach a lot more who need to hear her message.I also highly recommend her book where she and a co-author tell it like it is.She is as great as Martin Luther King Jr.  Both state that skin is not the issue, but the content of one's character which Marva Collins pinpoints with success.God bless them both.",4,Great movie lacked one issue,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,623,"['Yes', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'am', 'follower', 'Marva', 'Collins', 'who', 'consider', 'greatest', 'teacher', 'time', 'only', 'wish', 'DVD', 'came', 'interview', 'real', 'Marva', 'Collins', 'least', 'copy', 'TV', '60', 'Minutes', 'story', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'long.Also', 'DVD', 'came', 'had', 'Spanish', 'option', 'would', 'reach', 'lot', 'more', 'who', 'need', 'hear', 'message.I', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'book', 'where', 'co-author', 'tell', 'as', 'great', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'state', 'skin', 'not', 'issue', 'content', 'one', 'character', 'Marva', 'Collins', 'pinpoints', 'success.God', 'bless']","Marva Collins Story, The (DVD)"
1110488,A2N2S9PPHMW016,B000WMA736,JDavid,"[4, 4]","The Marva Collins Story is another example of an excellent made for television film (a film that probably cost very little to make and needed no expensive special effects or razzle dazzle) that brings a true story to the attention of the public.  Such quality television films reminds me once again of the broad variety of material that can make it on to the small screen, when the cinema fare is much more limited in scope.The film chronicles how Marva Collins, a highly dedicated public school teacher in an inner city Chicago school, gave up the security of her teaching position to start her own private school.  Frustrated by the apathy and low standards of her colleagues and the obstructiveness of the public school bureaucracy, and horrified by the related poor performance of so many of the students, Collins opened a school where she could carry out her own teaching philosophy.  Collins believed that children should be taught and challenged by the best material in history, literature, languages, math, and science.  This approach is called a classical education, the idea that the greatest accomplishments of Western civilization, the civilization that gave rise to our own country, are the common heritage of all.  Collins also had a fierce love for her students, who were mostly African-American children from poorer families.  This love manifested itself in a commitment and determination to their education that brooked no obstacles.Supported by her loving husband, but otherwise without any real financial or institutional support, Collins put together a successful school where she could demonstrate that poor black children, some of whom had been struggling in other school systems, could master great literature, foreign languages, persuasive composition, and above all, the best ideas of the past.The film is well-acted, with Cicely Tyson in the lead role, supported by a youngish Morgan Freeman as her husband.  The supporting actors who play the children and other adults are also excellent, bringing a realistic and sometimes humorous tone to the domestic and schoolroom scenes.Marva Collins went on to become extremely influential in the educational reform movement, contributing to the rise of private and charter schools that regrouped around high standards, high expectations, and high quality content.  There has also been a renewed interest among many Americans in classical education, for which Marva Collins deserves great credit.  While her own school unfortunately closed down during the economic recession of 2008-2009, her influence on the many children she taught as well as many more who were blessed by her inspiring example to the private, charter, and homeschooling movements has been profound.Although the film only introduces the viewer to her wonderful life work and does not extend beyond the initial success of her school, it is well worth seeing.  Highly recommended.",5,Great film of a true story,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,2915,"['Marva', 'Collins', 'Story', 'example', 'excellent', 'made', 'television', 'film', 'film', 'probably', 'cost', 'very', 'little', 'make', 'needed', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'razzle', 'dazzle', 'true', 'story', 'attention', 'public', 'Such', 'quality', 'television', 'films', 'once', 'again', 'broad', 'variety', 'material', 'can', 'make', 'small', 'screen', 'when', 'cinema', 'fare', 'much', 'more', 'limited', 'scope.The', 'film', 'how', 'Marva', 'Collins', 'highly', 'dedicated', 'public', 'school', 'teacher', 'inner', 'city', 'Chicago', 'school', 'gave', 'up', 'security', 'teaching', 'position', 'start', 'own', 'private', 'school', 'Frustrated', 'apathy', 'low', 'standards', 'colleagues', 'obstructiveness', 'public', 'school', 'bureaucracy', 'horrified', 'related', 'poor', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'students', 'Collins', 'opened', 'school', 'where', 'could', 'carry', 'out', 'own', 'teaching', 'philosophy', 'believed', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'challenged', 'best', 'material', 'history', 'literature', 'languages', 'math', 'science', 'approach', 'called', 'classical', 'education', 'idea', 'greatest', 'accomplishments', 'Western', 'civilization', 'civilization', 'gave', 'rise', 'own', 'country', 'are', 'common', 'heritage', 'Collins', 'also', 'had', 'fierce', 'love', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'mostly', 'African-American', 'children', 'poorer', 'families', 'love', 'manifested', 'commitment', 'determination', 'education', 'brooked', 'obstacles.Supported', 'loving', 'husband', 'otherwise', 'real', 'financial', 'institutional', 'support', 'Collins', 'put', 'together', 'successful', 'school', 'where', 'could', 'demonstrate', 'poor', 'black', 'children', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'struggling', 'other', 'school', 'systems', 'could', 'master', 'great', 'literature', 'foreign', 'languages', 'persuasive', 'composition', 'best', 'ideas', 'past.The', 'film', 'well-acted', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'lead', 'role', 'supported', 'youngish', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'husband', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'children', 'other', 'adults', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'bringing', 'realistic', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'tone', 'domestic', 'schoolroom', 'scenes.Marva', 'Collins', 'went', 'become', 'extremely', 'influential', 'educational', 'reform', 'movement', 'contributing', 'rise', 'private', 'charter', 'schools', 'regrouped', 'around', 'high', 'standards', 'high', 'expectations', 'high', 'quality', 'content', 'also', 'been', 'renewed', 'interest', 'many', 'Americans', 'classical', 'education', 'Marva', 'Collins', 'great', 'credit', 'own', 'school', 'unfortunately', 'closed', 'down', 'economic', 'recession', '2008-2009', 'influence', 'many', 'children', 'taught', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'more', 'who', 'were', 'blessed', 'inspiring', 'example', 'private', 'charter', 'homeschooling', 'movements', 'been', 'film', 'only', 'viewer', 'wonderful', 'life', 'work', 'not', 'extend', 'initial', 'success', 'school', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Highly', 'recommended']","Marva Collins Story, The (DVD)"
