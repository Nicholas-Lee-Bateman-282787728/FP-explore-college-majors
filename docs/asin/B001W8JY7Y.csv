It is just a peak into a weekend  episode where a middle-aged man Gianni, unemployed, and who lives with his mother.  Gianni runs low of money and through his acquaintances, condo manager, his doctor and earns some money tending to their elderly relatives.Running time is 1 hr. and 15 minute, and from the words of the writer/director/main actor, Gianni de Gorgio, it is low budget, and a director debut for Gianni de Gordio.  Gianni is a lover of wine, which he buys on credit The premise is a holiday Pranzo de Ferragosto on a hot weekend.  Gianni spends his time supervising the four elderly ladies, including his mother played by 94 year-old Valeria De Franciscis.  He cooks nice dishes, follows instructions for the custodial/dietary care, makes up the beds, and just plain good conversations with the ladies and settles disputes.The beautiful streets are an interesting view.  Director Gianni de Gordio in the extra features speaks about the budgeting, the choice on which ladies to use in the film.  You will also learn how much of the acting direction is not restricted.  The camera moves from room to room within a house.

This is a small film.  It is delightful.  Roma in August is not what it used to be, literally.  August was once the month of the eponymous emperor.  When the calendar went to twelve months, even the twelve Caesars could not stop it.  Bene. The year is divided into eights for farmers.  You thought there were four.  But that does not work.  We fit in Halloween, Groundhog Day. May Day and Lamas.  Midsummer begins at Lamas.  The Romani celebrated this day as the early harvest.  For a fortnight, they had a big party, ending on the feast of the Huntress, Diana.  The Catholic Capo di Capi co-opted her day for the Blessed Virgin.  So August 15 has become the Feast of the Assumption.  Enough history.The director, di Greggorio, had last done a gangster flick.  Here, he sort of plays himself.  He is the star.  He is the dreaded late middle age Mamma's boy.  He has no wife, no work, no dreams.  I love my bella Italia, but I must say that the law had to be made to restrict mothers-in-law as THE primary reason for divorce. Basta!So, we have the man assaulted by his condo manager. Sound familiar?  He has not paid his bills.  For example, EU 1.600 for electric.  He complains it is an exaggeration.  The manager rebuffs, ""For three years.""  You feel the burn on the arm being twisted.  And there is a load of other bills.  But there is a way out.  He must take the Manager's momma so that he can get away for this holiday.  The poor man accepts and must face his own mamma, saying, ""Do not get Snippy!""  What a pathetic hope, as mama loads her clip.For those of you who know the Eternal City, the scooter ride to find fish on a Sunday in August, for the great meal takes you all over.  The Swede will enjoy the biker Viking.  There is more to the story such as fish from the Tiber (a frightening thought) at the base of Hadrian's Tomb, known to Tosca lovers; but anything more here would just spoil the fun.Ciao bella",4,Roma in mid summer doldrum holiday,1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,2074,"['Do', 'not', 'let', 'four', 'stars', 'fool', 'thinking', 'film', 'not', 'first', 'rate', 'missing', 'star', 'people', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'so', 'regard', 'small', 'film', 'delightful', 'Roma', 'August', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'literally', 'August', 'was', 'once', 'month', 'eponymous', 'emperor', 'When', 'calendar', 'went', 'twelve', 'months', 'even', 'twelve', 'Caesars', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'Bene', 'year', 'divided', 'eights', 'farmers', 'thought', 'were', 'four', 'not', 'work', 'fit', 'Halloween', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'May', 'Day', 'Lamas', 'Midsummer', 'Lamas', 'Romani', 'celebrated', 'day', 'early', 'harvest', 'fortnight', 'had', 'big', 'party', 'ending', 'feast', 'Huntress', 'Diana', 'Catholic', 'Capo', 'Capi', 'co-opted', 'day', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'So', 'August', '15', 'become', 'Feast', 'Assumption', 'Enough', 'history.The', 'director', 'di', 'Greggorio', 'had', 'last', 'done', 'gangster', 'flick', 'Here', 'sort', 'plays', 'star', 'dreaded', 'late', 'middle', 'age', 'Mamma', 'boy', 'wife', 'work', 'dreams', 'love', 'bella', 'Italia', 'must', 'say', 'law', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'restrict', 'mothers-in-law', 'THE', 'primary', 'reason', 'divorce', 'Basta', 'So', 'have', 'man', 'assaulted', 'condo', 'manager', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'not', 'paid', 'bills', 'example', 'EU', '1.600', 'electric', 'exaggeration', 'manager', 'rebuffs', 'three', 'years', 'feel', 'burn', 'arm', 'being', 'twisted', 'load', 'other', 'bills', 'way', 'must', 'take', 'Manager', 'momma', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'holiday', 'poor', 'man', 'accepts', 'must', 'face', 'own', 'mamma', 'saying', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'Snippy', 'What', 'pathetic', 'hope', 'mama', 'clip.For', 'who', 'know', 'Eternal', 'City', 'scooter', 'ride', 'find', 'fish', 'Sunday', 'August', 'great', 'meal', 'Swede', 'will', 'enjoy', 'biker', 'Viking', 'more', 'story', 'such', 'fish', 'Tiber', 'frightening', 'thought', 'base', 'Hadrian', 'Tomb', 'known', 'Tosca', 'lovers', 'anything', 'more', 'here', 'would', 'just', 'spoil', 'fun.Ciao', 'bella']",Mid-August Lunch (Pranzo di ferragosto) [Regeon 2]

1244375,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001W8JY7Y,Andy Orrock,"[18, 18]","This small little movie will surprise you.  It clocks in at only 75 minutes, but even that 'light filling' will leave you satisfied all day.  In fact, at the 45-minute mark I suddenly became aware of the perma-smile plastered across my face.  I suspect it'll have that type of effect on most viewers.Star/writer/director Gianni Di Gregorio was responsible for the screenplay of 2009's sleeper art-house hit,Gomorrah (The Criterion Collection).  His 'Pranzo di Ferragosto' (literally, lunch on the Italian holiday celebrated on August 15th) couldn't be further removed from Gomorrah.  Far from that film's intertwined tales of the Neapolitan crime syndicate, Ferragosto's focus is around Gianni (the writer/director himself, whose hangdog profile is perfectly cast here), his aging but spry mother, and the apartment they share in Rome.Over the course of the film's first-half, down-on-his-luck Gianni finds himself tending to an ever-increasing roster of women pensioners, as one Roman after another sees Gianni as the perfect way to temporarily dump responsibility and flee the city.  The second-half of the film is where the treat happens: the camera mostly stays in the apartment as the woman chatter away and slowly bond.  What becomes clear: this is a group of individuals simply starved for companionship and the opportunity for idle, pleasant talk...the stuff of day-to-day life.  When the time comes to leave, well, that's when the movie's real payoff happens.  You won't easily forget it.Despite spending most of the time in the apartment, there's one brilliant interlude: director Di Gregorio puts himself of the back of Vespa as he traverses the city to round-up the ingredients (wine, fish, vegetables, bread) for the dinner.  He plants a camera on a car in front of two-wheeler and languidly leads it around the city.  No PR or slick advertising could top what Di Gregorio does here in terms of displaying his city's character and quirky charms.",5,"At only 75 minutes, this 'light filling' will leave you satisfied all day",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1958,"['small', 'little', 'movie', 'will', 'surprise', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'even', ""'light"", 'filling', 'will', 'leave', 'satisfied', 'day', 'fact', '45-minute', 'mark', 'suddenly', 'became', 'aware', 'perma-smile', 'plastered', 'face', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'have', 'type', 'effect', 'most', 'viewers.Star/writer/director', 'Gianni', 'Di', 'Gregorio', 'was', 'responsible', 'screenplay', '2009', 'sleeper', 'art-house', 'hit', 'Gomorrah', 'Criterion', 'Collection', ""'Pranzo"", 'di', 'Ferragosto', 'literally', 'lunch', 'Italian', 'holiday', 'celebrated', 'August', '15th', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'removed', 'Gomorrah', 'Far', 'film', 'intertwined', 'tales', 'Neapolitan', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Ferragosto', 'focus', 'Gianni', 'writer/director', 'hangdog', 'profile', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'here', 'aging', 'spry', 'mother', 'apartment', 'share', 'Rome.Over', 'course', 'film', 'first-half', 'down-on-his-luck', 'Gianni', 'tending', 'ever-increasing', 'roster', 'women', 'pensioners', 'one', 'Roman', 'sees', 'Gianni', 'perfect', 'way', 'temporarily', 'dump', 'responsibility', 'flee', 'city', 'second-half', 'film', 'where', 'treat', 'camera', 'mostly', 'apartment', 'woman', 'chatter', 'away', 'slowly', 'bond', 'What', 'clear', 'group', 'individuals', 'simply', 'starved', 'companionship', 'opportunity', 'idle', 'pleasant', 'talk', 'stuff', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'When', 'time', 'leave', 'well', 'when', 'movie', 'real', 'payoff', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'forget', 'it.Despite', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'apartment', 'one', 'brilliant', 'interlude', 'director', 'Di', 'Gregorio', 'back', 'Vespa', 'city', 'round-up', 'ingredients', 'wine', 'fish', 'vegetables', 'bread', 'dinner', 'plants', 'camera', 'car', 'front', 'two-wheeler', 'languidly', 'city', 'PR', 'slick', 'advertising', 'could', 'top', 'what', 'Di', 'Gregorio', 'here', 'terms', 'displaying', 'city', 'character', 'quirky', 'charms']",Mid-August Lunch (Pranzo di ferragosto) [Regeon 2]
1244376,A7KQB3WGH6HT7,B001W8JY7Y,Book lover -Philadelphia,"[2, 2]","I won't recap the story, which is delightful, but want to add two points.  There is an issue in Italy today of too many young men choosing to stay home with mama so she can cook and clean; the result is fewer marriages, dropping birth rate (I believe it's now less than replacement) and an economy that doesn't have a sufficient supply of new workers.  In addition, like some other members of the EU, Italy is heavily in debt and is outspending what it has - rather like Gianni, who has somehow been living in the condo for three years without paying the fees or electricity or his wine bills or......  Is Gianni's life a metaphor for his country?  Gianni's quandary - how to live and provide social services to the elderly with very little money - is also one that faces the Italian government.  At the end, one of the elderly ladies produces some previously hidden money; again, is this a metaphor for what Italian citizens are doing?Aside from the serious political interpretation of a light-hearted movie, there is another wonderful point.  Not one of the elderly ladies is a professional actress.  I took this out as a DVD and checked the feature, where Gianni the director showed his travels around Italy seeking just the right elderly ladies.  We get a chance to see and hear each of them in their own homes and that added a wonderful dimension.  Their lack of experience does not mean they did a poor job; on the contrary, they were extremely convincing.Finally, it seemed to me that the over-arching point of the film was the importance of socialization with one's peers.  That is so important to each lady and they come alive as they experience it.Kudos to the writer, director/lead actor and the ladies for a must-see film.",5,A delight...and it made me think,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1734,"['wo', ""n't"", 'recap', 'story', 'delightful', 'want', 'add', 'two', 'points', 'issue', 'Italy', 'today', 'too', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'choosing', 'stay', 'home', 'mama', 'can', 'cook', 'clean', 'result', 'fewer', 'marriages', 'dropping', 'birth', 'rate', 'believe', 'now', 'less', 'replacement', 'economy', ""n't"", 'have', 'sufficient', 'supply', 'new', 'workers', 'addition', 'other', 'members', 'EU', 'Italy', 'heavily', 'debt', 'outspending', 'what', 'rather', 'Gianni', 'who', 'somehow', 'been', 'living', 'condo', 'three', 'years', 'paying', 'fees', 'electricity', 'wine', 'bills', 'Gianni', 'life', 'metaphor', 'country', 'Gianni', 'quandary', 'how', 'live', 'provide', 'social', 'services', 'elderly', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'also', 'one', 'Italian', 'government', 'end', 'one', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'previously', 'hidden', 'money', 'again', 'metaphor', 'what', 'Italian', 'citizens', 'are', 'doing', 'Aside', 'serious', 'political', 'interpretation', 'light-hearted', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'point', 'Not', 'one', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'professional', 'actress', 'took', 'out', 'DVD', 'checked', 'feature', 'where', 'Gianni', 'director', 'showed', 'travels', 'Italy', 'seeking', 'just', 'right', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'hear', 'own', 'homes', 'added', 'wonderful', 'dimension', 'lack', 'experience', 'not', 'mean', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'contrary', 'were', 'extremely', 'convincing.Finally', 'seemed', 'over-arching', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'importance', 'socialization', 'one', 'peers', 'so', 'important', 'lady', 'come', 'alive', 'experience', 'it.Kudos', 'writer', 'director/lead', 'actor', 'ladies', 'must-see', 'film']",Mid-August Lunch (Pranzo di ferragosto) [Regeon 2]

The film glows with a richness of spirit that is very satisfying and humorous and uplifting.  Apparently Pranzo di Ferragosto (or Feast of Assumption) is that holiday in mid August when all Italians head for the shore to get away from the heat.  Gianni lives in Rome with his very elderly and demanding mother (Valeria De Franciscis), broke, with mounting tabs at the grocers and the winery, but he prides himself in his culinary skills with which he keeps his mother satisfied. He spends his days shopping and sipping wine with his old friend Viking (Luigi Marchetti).  When his friend and condo manager Alfonso (Alfonso Santagata) pays a visit to remind Gianni how he is behind in his rent and obligations for the condo, Gianni is depressed but Alfonso has a plan: take care of his mother (Marina Cacciotti) during the weekend of Pranzo di Ferragosto and Gianni's debts will be forgiven. Gianni agrees as does his mother, but when Alfonso arrives with his mother in tow he also brings his aunt (Maria Cali) who also needs a place to stay in Alfonso's absence.  The local doctor (Marcello Ottolenghi) pays a house call to check on Gianni and his mother and in passing asks Gianni to look after HIS mother (Grazia Cesarini Sforza), too!  This leaves Gianni with a full house, a shared television, minimal beds, but they all make do and  with the help of his old friend Viking the two to entertain the three old ladies.  They cook a fine mid-August meal and the old lades dress up and dance, having more fun than they have had since their youth.It is a slight story but one told with a warmth and compassion that is endearing to experience.

1244381,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001W8JY7Y,Haunted Flower,"[1, 9]","At first glance, ""Mid-August Lunch"" seems to be a commentary on how other cultures like Italians take care of their elder family members while we Americans ship them off to nursing homes. After the shenanigans begin with all these old ladies in tow, the difficulty of anyone taking care of their mother full time let alone four mothers starts to make our nursing homes look like fabulous accommodations.This film by Gianni Di Gregorio stars himself as the character Gianni who lives with his 93 year-old mother whom he takes care of, but he has fallen into quite a bit of debt. When the offer comes along to make his problems go away if he takes cares of the building manager's mother, he accepts it. Before long, he gets saddled with an auntie and someone else's mother and becomes a full-time cook/therapist/server to them at the expense of his sleep and occasionally his good humor and general well being.The attentiveness of Gianni even when his patience is wearing thin is sweet. His endurance for putting up with the ladies' demands is impressive to say the least. His own mother was enough of a pill before the others entered the picture, but combining all the other personalities and problems complicates the household quickly. Some of them don't get along. One woman is on a strict diet her son put her on to avoid dairy and she keeps trying to sneak macaroni salad since she can't resist it. Another is up till all hours of the night just telling stories about her memories. The third after barricading herself in her room the entire day pouting because Gianni's mother wanted her TV back, sneaks out at night to get drunk and then throws herself at Gianni!It is very much like taking care of a bunch of children, except that they all have several decades of experience and think they should be allowed to do whatever they want even if they are behaving immaturely or it threatens their health. This comedy does point out some of the positive qualities of hanging out with a bunch of little old ladies, but mostly works the comedy of the side effects of putting all these people in one apartment during Italy's biggest summer holiday, Pranzo di Ferragosto.Gianni Di Gregorio tells this story drawing from his own experience of taking care of his mother for many years illustrating the loneliness and vulnerability of the elderly as well as highlighting their fascinating wealth of knowledge and experience they draw from that others forget about.Luckily, it's a very short film coming in at 75 minutes because I couldn't take the stress of Gianni's self-imposed mini-nursing home any longer and it is plain to see why it can be easier to let someone else care for your relative when it is a demanding full-time job.
