If people had seen this film earlier, Bill Murray would not have had to wait for 'Lost in Translation' to be considered a serious actor.This is a wonderful film, but it commits the cardinal error of demanding attention, thought and consideration from it's viewers.  Of course, it was a commercial failure.Having said that, thanks to Columbia for releasing it on DVD.  My tape was wearing out.Now, how about doing it again, and doing it right this time?Where are the extras?  Where is the commentary track from Bill Murray and John Byrum?  How about including deleted scenes, or at least the storyboards and script excerpts that were never used?  They're out on the internet; they should be on this disc.The film copy itself is not the best quality.Bill Murray is enjoying a revival.  People are starting to recognize him for the talent he truly is.  This is one of his first dramatic pieces, and it is his first non-comedic starring role.  It is a serious film with a loyal and dedicated following. It deserves better treatment than this.When ""Resident Evil 2"" can be released as a 2-Disc set, with tons of extras, why is a film of this quality being treated this poorly?Shame on you Columbia and Sony!Having said that, please buy this DVD, it is one of the most amazing films you will ever watch!",3,"A GREAT Movie, but the DVD is not up to standards",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,1400,"['guess', 'can', 'read', 'everybody', 'else', 'telling', 'how', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'great', 'movie', 'agree', 'totally', 'people', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'earlier', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'wait', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'be', 'considered', 'serious', 'actor.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'cardinal', 'error', 'demanding', 'attention', 'thought', 'consideration', 'viewers', 'course', 'was', 'commercial', 'failure.Having', 'said', 'thanks', 'Columbia', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'tape', 'was', 'wearing', 'out.Now', 'how', 'doing', 'again', 'doing', 'right', 'time', 'Where', 'are', 'extras', 'Where', 'commentary', 'track', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'John', 'Byrum', 'How', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'least', 'storyboards', 'script', 'excerpts', 'were', 'never', 'used', ""'re"", 'out', 'internet', 'should', 'be', 'disc.The', 'film', 'copy', 'not', 'best', 'quality.Bill', 'Murray', 'enjoying', 'revival', 'People', 'are', 'starting', 'recognize', 'talent', 'truly', 'one', 'first', 'dramatic', 'pieces', 'first', 'non-comedic', 'starring', 'role', 'serious', 'film', 'loyal', 'dedicated', 'following', 'better', 'treatment', 'this.When', 'Resident', 'Evil', '2', 'can', 'be', 'released', '2-Disc', 'set', 'tons', 'extras', 'why', 'film', 'quality', 'being', 'treated', 'poorly', 'Shame', 'Columbia', 'Sony', 'Having', 'said', 'please', 'buy', 'DVD', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'films', 'will', 'ever', 'watch']",Razor's Edge VHS

Naturally to get the fullness of the story you will have to read the book. A closer to the book movie version (1946) was made with Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney (see my review). This version although closer to the book, however has Tyrone Power usurping some of the deeds the Summerset did in the book.This movie version went one step further to place Bill Murray in the center stage and cut out a lot of the mystery along with Maugham. At first you will say this is not like the book (and it is not); but the modification emphasized the meaning of the book and by changing Larry from a flyer to an ambulance driver emphasized the question of why him and not me? So you can get a feel for the question Larry asks and not just be an observer. Larry's evolvement with Sophie MacDonald once again takes you out of the realm of an observer. Possibly to save time and enforce the ""you are there"" feel, W. Somerset Maugham was completely removed from the story. I really like Anne Baxter (1946) but I have to say that Theresa Russell (1984) made an excellent Sophie MacDonald.Bottom line if you have nothing to compare the movie with it is watchable and insightful.

Dolnack,"[4, 5]","Bill Murray is brilliantly casted in the role of the main character; a man seeking the meaning of life on a spiritual quest that sacrifices everything and everyone in his world.There are significant differences between this film and the novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The narrator is not a character in the film as in the book. Larry Darell does not visit the Dalai Lama in the book as he does in the film, but rather spends several years in India living with a Hindu holy man. Larry's philosophical and religious revelations in the book stem from Hinduism rather than Buddhism, as in the film. There are also other significant small details that are not as obvious in the film as in the novel; for example, the effect of the Great Depression on Gray's family fortune and why he & Isabel must move to Paris and live with Uncle Elliot.It would be a mistake to think of this movie as a sort of spiritual parallel to ""Seven Years in Tibet"". It's actually got more in common with the Great Gatsby. This isn't a story about a Westerner becomming turned-on by Eastern religion as much as it's a story about aristocratic Americans from Chicago living as expatriats in Paris in the years 1918-to-1930-something, (as seen through European eyes).There are some fabulous acting performances in this film, foremost of which is Denholm Elliot in the role of Elliot Templeton (perhaps the best of his career). Bill Murray should have received on Oscar for his performance. Word on the street today is that what an incredible film ""Lost in Translation"" is, and how it shows a side of Bill Murray we haven't seen before, but I disagree. Those critics need to go back and have a look at ""The Razor's Edge"" and they will see that ""serious"" side of Murray, but in a much better-written and more moving story.This DVD is a nice presentation: a 16x9 widescreen picture that looks good and the sound is fine as well.

End cliche.I mean that. It's not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was a war film. It is not. I thought it was a chick flick. It is not. It is much, much more than these. It actually turns out to be an epic; director John Byrum, and actors Bill Murray and Theresa Russell are the reasons why.I won't write a synopsis of the motion picture; I will say that Bill Murray interjects just enough humor into the film to make it not as dark as it could have been. There are certainly some tragic tales and lessons here, but Larry Darrell (Murray) emerges as even more human than what his circumstances allow. His experiences serving in World War I disillusion him, so when he comes back home his life takes him on a different course than previously planned. He searches for himself, and that search takes him across the ocean to distant lands. He experiences severe hardship, disappointment and deep betrayal, but he NEVER complains.Theresa Russell gives a heart-felt performance as Larry Darrell's fiance, Sophie. The countryside vistas are elaborate and breathtaking. I just don't want to say much more if you've never seen the film. I watched it many years ago, but it had a more profound effect on me when I watched it today. Suffice it to say that the The Tibetan monk was right when he responded to Darrell's question with,""The path to salvation is narrow, and is as difficult to walk as a razor's edge.""",5,Murray and Russell are Sensational!,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,1561,"['Cliche', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'fan', 'liked', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'magnificent', 'film', 'End', 'cliche.I', 'mean', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'thought', 'was', 'war', 'film', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'chick', 'flick', 'not', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'epic', 'director', 'John', 'Byrum', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'are', 'reasons', 'why.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'synopsis', 'motion', 'picture', 'will', 'say', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'film', 'make', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'certainly', 'tragic', 'tales', 'lessons', 'here', 'Larry', 'Darrell', 'Murray', 'even', 'more', 'human', 'what', 'circumstances', 'allow', 'experiences', 'serving', 'World', 'War', 'disillusion', 'so', 'when', 'back', 'home', 'life', 'different', 'course', 'previously', 'planned', 'search', 'ocean', 'distant', 'lands', 'severe', 'hardship', 'disappointment', 'deep', 'betrayal', 'NEVER', 'complains.Theresa', 'Russell', 'heart-felt', 'performance', 'Larry', 'Darrell', 'fiance', 'Sophie', 'countryside', 'vistas', 'are', 'elaborate', 'breathtaking', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'watched', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'more', 'profound', 'effect', 'when', 'watched', 'today', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Tibetan', 'monk', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'responded', 'Darrell', 'question', 'path', 'salvation', 'narrow', 'as', 'difficult', 'walk', 'razor', 'edge']",Razor's Edge VHS

My father passed away a few months later.  I remember him telling me, ""it was a very good movie that had that funny guy in it, but it was a serious movie"".I never did see this 1984 version.  Then on TV I saw the 1946 version and decided to get a copy of the Billy Murray edition.  I found the more recent film better than the 1946 original.  Especially since it was shot on location.It seems this movie is having some sort of renaissance.  I see people giving this movie 5 stars, like myself, and saying its the best movie they ever saw and it changed their life.  While I wont go that far, I will say it is probably one of the most underrated movie you might ever see, since it was a box office bomb.  But it has been said in many reviews that a movie about enlightment and looking for the meaning of life, coming out in the 1980's decade of greed did not have an audience.  I agree with that.  Plus this movie just goes over a lot of people's head.  (Sort of like another movie which is also about your finding your soul and is more serious than it seems and that is the film, Joe vs the Volcano.)If I saw this movie when I was 24 when my father told me to, I probably would not have appreciated it as much.  I think to appreciate to this film you have to some life experiences ""under your belt"".  I think this movie would attract anyone who has lost a close love one and/or someone who ""saved"" your life mentally, physically or spiritually.I give it 5 stars.  Some parts especially early in the film, Murray goes act aloof and somewhat funny, but if you read the book that is how Larry Darell is. And Bill Murray in this movie walks around at times with a stare as if staring into space and not reacting  to incidents......but again read the book; perhaps its part of being shell shocked from the war.A movie very worthy of seeing.  And look at the 1946 version, also good with two Oscars wins to compare.  And its beyond belief how Theresa Russell did not get a supporting actress nomination and how an Oscar nod for the score by Jack Nitzsche did not occur.  The score has to rank up their with some of the greats.Now based on the high star reviews here and other movie review sites I have seen, its seem now its a much more appreciated film with the recognition that Bill Murray and every associated with the film, thought it should of had 28 years ago.

I relate to the character and numerous others I've loaned this movie to have come back in tears - but good tears.  Bill Murray is the perfect Larry because of the fact that the humorous little boy continues to shine through, THAT'S WHO HE IS, in spite of what he's endured, the experience of watching friends die and knowing human nature in a manner of which only combat veterans and law enforcement people ever experience.  Larry stays Larry, he just changes in a manner that only another PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) victim can relate to.  It's my opinion that many people miss the depth of the character Larry and see only the exterior of the character.  Do you have to act like Budda or Ghandi to seek the meaning of life, the reason for you existence?  The whole point of the movie is that Larry is just an average person tossed into circumstances and situations that preclude him from returning to what his existence was ""planned out"" to be (work in an office/firm, get married, kids, summer home, etc, etc)- life's experiences and fate dictated his new journey - a journey he obviously was forced travel, with truth always just steps further away.Hey, could go on forever about this movie.

Too bad that the critics of 1984 did not see it that way ( much like the similar difficulties that Robin Williams and Adam Sandler first had in doing ""serious roles"").Murray KNEW and UNDERSTOOD Maugham's Larry and he performed the role to utter perfection.There is so much to commend Murray's rendition over the previous version,such as the outstanding cinematography, the Stanley Black musical score and the outstanding performances of Theresa Russel,Denholm Elliott and Catherine Hicks.....but most of all it is Murray's true understanding of the heart of the material and message that Maughamintended.Could the film have been better? Probably only in the editing where vital scenes possibly were deleted in order to compact the film.But, even with that, this is a true masterpiece that seems to be appreciated so much more as the years go by (even by myself who was rather ambivilent about the film at the ""know-it-all"" age of then 29!!!).Having since read Maugham's novel and learned so much more about this aimless and disheartened generation of dreamers,THE RAZOR'S EDGE has to be one of the finest expositions ever written or filmed on this subject. Anyone with an interest in ""THE LOST GENERATION"" will improve their knowledge vastly by watching Murray's THE RAZOR'S EDGE.Other excellent companion films on ""THE LOST GENERATION"" would be THE MODERNS,THE GREAT GATSBY,SCOTT AND ZELDA, TOM AND VIV and A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY,NORA,WAITING FOR THE MOON,MODIGLIANI as well as the play THE VIOLET HOUR.",5,"""THE LOST GENERATION"":The post WW1 Upper crust who sought meaning to life.",1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,3126,"['Much', 'been', 'written', 'documented', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'known', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'were', 'American', 'upper', 'crust', 'who', 'being', 'disillusioned', 'War', 'End', 'Wars', 'World', 'War', '1', 'struggled', 'vehemently', 'many', 'ways', 'find', 'meaning', 'lives', 'returning', 'peacetime', 'America.Zelda', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Heningway', 'are', 'most', 'famous', 'authors', 'write', 'shallow', 'meaningless', 'existence', 'society', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'did', 'same', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE.This', '1984', 'adaptation', 'Maugham', '1940', 'novel', 'really', 'essence', 'intense', 'inner', 'outer', 'struggles', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'generation', 'had', 'endure.Lots', 'hopes', 'expectations', 'were', 'radically', 'altered', 'what', 'seemed', 'instant', 'War', 'rich', 'retuned', 'what', 'had', 'known', 'before', 'upper', 'stations', 'society', 'pampered', 'opulent', 'insular', 'quite', 'predictable', 'road', 'turned', 'existential', 'journey', 'frequently', 'lead', 'down', 'path', 'ultimate', 'ruin', 'due', 'alcohol', 'opium', 'Bohemian', 'society', 'Paris', 'travel', 'Greece', 'India', 'Tibet', 'find', 'God', '.No', 'matter', 'path', 'was', 'chosen', 'opting', 'life', 'back', 'comforts', 'American', 'wealth', 'eventually', 'ruined', 'Great', 'Depression', 'mind-expanding', 'wandering', 'streets', 'Temples', 'group', 'found', 'treacherous', 'walk', 'razor', 'edge', 'survive', 'all.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'marvelously', 'set', 'forth', 'plot', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'own', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'improve', 'writings', '.No', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'better', 'Too', 'bad', 'critics', '1984', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'way', 'much', 'similar', 'difficulties', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'first', 'had', 'doing', 'serious', 'roles', '.Murray', 'KNEW', 'UNDERSTOOD', 'Maugham', 'Larry', 'performed', 'role', 'utter', 'perfection.There', 'so', 'much', 'commend', 'Murray', 'rendition', 'previous', 'version', 'such', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'Stanley', 'Black', 'musical', 'score', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Theresa', 'Russel', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'most', 'Murray', 'true', 'understanding', 'heart', 'material', 'message', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Probably', 'only', 'editing', 'where', 'vital', 'scenes', 'possibly', 'were', 'deleted', 'order', 'compact', 'film.But', 'even', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'appreciated', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'years', 'go', 'even', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'ambivilent', 'film', 'know-it-all', 'age', 'then', '29', '.Having', 'read', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'aimless', 'disheartened', 'generation', 'dreamers', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'expositions', 'ever', 'written', 'filmed', 'subject', 'Anyone', 'interest', 'LOST', 'GENERATION', 'will', 'improve', 'knowledge', 'vastly', 'watching', 'Murray', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE.Other', 'excellent', 'companion', 'films', 'LOST', 'GENERATION', 'would', 'be', 'THE', 'MODERNS', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'GATSBY', 'SCOTT', 'AND', 'ZELDA', 'TOM', 'AND', 'VIV', 'A', 'MONTH', 'IN', 'THE', 'COUNTRY', 'NORA', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'THE', 'MOON', 'MODIGLIANI', 'as', 'well', 'play', 'THE', 'VIOLET', 'HOUR']",Razor's Edge VHS
336255,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302800498,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[19, 20]","Bill Murray's 1984 remake of the 1947 Tyrone Power vehicle based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 possibly fact-based novel of the same name, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is a consistently underrated film. By and large this is because Murray, universally considered as one of the finest comics of his generation, is cast (for the first time) in an unfamiliar dramatic role, a shift in paradigm not well accepted either by the critics or a large portion of the moviegoing public. Those who choose to penetrate their preconceptions will find that THE RAZOR'S EDGE is an intelligent and sensitive movie about generational dislocation and personal values.Larry Darrell has returned from 1918's Western Front carrying a vast burden: That of a human life given up to save his own. Returning to his affluent American family and fiancee Isobel (Catherine Hicks) he finds that he simply cannot adopt the thin produce-and-consume values of the burgeoning Jazz Age, and so returns to 1920s Paris. After sampling the Moveable Feast, Darrell works as a laborer, living in pensions and devouring anything in print in his exploration of the life of the mind and the malady of the spirit. Eventually, he vanishes into the Orient.In the interim, the jilted and angry Isobel has married Larry's friend, Gray Maturin (James Keach). Their mutual friend Sophie (Theresa Russell) has also married, in the wake of her unexpected pregnancy.Their carefully arranged lives collapse suddenly as Isobel and Gray are left penniless after the Crash of '29. They flee to Paris, where they are sheltered by Isobel's wealthy, snobbish, but kindly uncle Elliott Templeton (Denholm Elliott).Sophie is involved in a terrible auto accident that claims her husband and young son. Consumed with survivor's guilt, finding her values bankrupt, and with no internal compass to guide her, she turns to alcohol, opium and prostitution.Larry suddenly reappears after a decade spent beyond the Lost Horizon. By chance, he reacquaints himself with Isobel and Gray, and soon after discovers the dissolute Sophie living on the streets. He gently guides her back toward life. As his relationship with Sophie grows, the vengeful Isobel sets out to destroy it.Excellent performances are given by all the principals. Larry Darrell's character as created by Maugham has often been described as the prototype of the socially alienated seeker. Darrell may well be the inspiration for the Beats and the hippie counterculture of the 1950s and 1960s, but with a difference---he seems to have found a sense of himself, and in the end, grown comfortable in his own skin. Bill Murray does a fine job of showing us Larry's evolution from a spoiled and overindulged young man raised and existing in complacency, to the desperate quester of knowledge in books and unfamiliar places, and then to the quiet everyday yogin in wingtips that he becomes, living in society but not of it.James Keach, in his limited role as Gray, is the quintessential American optimist. Denholm Elliott is the presumptuous American expatriate who can never quite leave his Midwestern roots behind (and although consumed with appearances, regards Larry with a peculiar respect). Isobel (Catherine Hicks) is a shallow and destructive [...], unable to accept Larry and abide his life, but intolerant and unforgiving of his choices. Theresa Russell (typecast as usual but still one of my favorite actresses) plays the fallen and redeemed Sophie with both gentleness and bemusement, the doppleganger to Larry's singleminded spiritual explorer.A much finer film than it's limited exposure would indicate, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is not just about a man in search of himself---it is about a world that has not found itself.",4,The Path To Salvation Is Difficult...To Walk As A Razor's Edge,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,3706,"['Bill', 'Murray', '1984', 'remake', '1947', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'vehicle', 'based', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', '1944', 'possibly', 'fact-based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'consistently', 'underrated', 'film', 'large', 'Murray', 'universally', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'comics', 'generation', 'cast', 'first', 'time', 'unfamiliar', 'dramatic', 'role', 'shift', 'paradigm', 'not', 'well', 'accepted', 'critics', 'large', 'portion', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'who', 'choose', 'penetrate', 'preconceptions', 'will', 'find', 'THE', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'movie', 'generational', 'dislocation', 'personal', 'values.Larry', 'Darrell', 'returned', '1918', 'Western', 'Front', 'carrying', 'vast', 'burden', 'human', 'life', 'given', 'up', 'save', 'own', 'Returning', 'affluent', 'American', 'family', 'fiancee', 'Isobel', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'adopt', 'thin', 'produce-and-consume', 'values', 'burgeoning', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'so', 'returns', '1920s', 'Paris', 'sampling', 'Moveable', 'Feast', 'Darrell', 'laborer', 'living', 'pensions', 'devouring', 'anything', 'print', 'exploration', 'life', 'mind', 'malady', 'spirit', 'Eventually', 'Orient.In', 'interim', 'jilted', 'angry', 'Isobel', 'married', 'Larry', 'friend', 'Gray', 'Maturin', 'James', 'Keach', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Sophie', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'also', 'married', 'wake', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy.Their', 'carefully', 'arranged', 'lives', 'collapse', 'suddenly', 'Isobel', 'Gray', 'are', 'left', 'penniless', 'Crash', ""'29"", 'flee', 'Paris', 'where', 'are', 'sheltered', 'Isobel', 'wealthy', 'snobbish', 'kindly', 'uncle', 'Elliott', 'Templeton', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', '.Sophie', 'involved', 'terrible', 'auto', 'accident', 'husband', 'young', 'son', 'Consumed', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'finding', 'values', 'bankrupt', 'internal', 'compass', 'guide', 'alcohol', 'opium', 'prostitution.Larry', 'suddenly', 'decade', 'spent', 'Lost', 'Horizon', 'chance', 'Isobel', 'Gray', 'soon', 'discovers', 'dissolute', 'Sophie', 'living', 'streets', 'gently', 'back', 'life', 'relationship', 'Sophie', 'grows', 'vengeful', 'Isobel', 'out', 'destroy', 'it.Excellent', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'principals', 'Larry', 'Darrell', 'character', 'created', 'Maugham', 'often', 'been', 'described', 'prototype', 'socially', 'alienated', 'seeker', 'Darrell', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Beats', 'hippie', 'counterculture', '1950s', '1960s', 'difference', '-he', 'have', 'found', 'sense', 'end', 'grown', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'Larry', 'evolution', 'spoiled', 'overindulged', 'young', 'man', 'raised', 'existing', 'complacency', 'desperate', 'quester', 'knowledge', 'books', 'unfamiliar', 'places', 'then', 'quiet', 'everyday', 'yogin', 'wingtips', 'living', 'society', 'not', 'it.James', 'Keach', 'limited', 'role', 'Gray', 'quintessential', 'American', 'optimist', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'presumptuous', 'American', 'expatriate', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'leave', 'Midwestern', 'roots', 'consumed', 'appearances', 'regards', 'Larry', 'peculiar', 'respect', 'Isobel', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'shallow', 'destructive', '[', ']', 'unable', 'accept', 'Larry', 'abide', 'life', 'intolerant', 'unforgiving', 'choices', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'typecast', 'usual', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'fallen', 'redeemed', 'Sophie', 'gentleness', 'bemusement', 'doppleganger', 'Larry', 'singleminded', 'spiritual', 'explorer.A', 'much', 'finer', 'film', 'limited', 'exposure', 'would', 'indicate', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'not', 'just', 'man', 'search', '-it', 'world', 'not', 'found']",Razor's Edge VHS

Somerst Maugham's classic novel of the same name.  It is sort of a existentional story that is hard to catch in a Hollywood film.  The script keeps your intereest, as the story spans many years and changes in the lives of three men.  The star, and person who ""carries the water"" in the film is Bill Murray.  Murray was cast in a dramatic, thoughtful role.  He shows how his talent is not limited to comedy and plays a well-to-do Chicagoan, Larry  Darrell.  Before WWI he is the usual happy-go-lucky young man with a beautiful girlfriend, Isabel. After Larry returns from the war, he is a changed man, looking for what is important and meaningful in life.  He leaves Isabel and travels to Paris, then later finds his guru and inner peace in Nepal, India.  While he is gone, many dramatic changes take place.  Isabel marries his best pal, Gray, and Sophie's husband and child are killed in a automobile accident.  Sophie hits bottom and becomes a drunk and a hooker.  Isabel thrives with Gray and has two beautiful daughters, and continues to live with her rich, social climbing Uncle Elliot.  When Larry comes back, he runs into Sophie at a Speak Easy.  She is living the low-life and he helps her climb out of a life of drugs, alcohol and violence toward women.  She is sober three months and they plan a life together.  Isabel, still in love with Larry, sabotages their plans and Larry confronts her with his sadness and pain.  He has learned from his guru that ""The path to salvation is narrow and hard to walk as a razor's edge.""The casting for Isabel felt wrong and chemistry between her and Larry seemed off at first.  The relationship changes in the last half of the movie, and the scenes worked and the movie keeps your interest.

I avoided this movie version (when it was in theaters) because it was mostly panned by critics and the only clip I recall seeing at the time was the ridiculous scene in which Bill Murray acts like a seal when hopping out of a swimming pool (which is downright embarrassing to watch). However, I recently decided to give this a go since it was available to stream and, while I applaud the idea, it's just not close, in spirit or delivery, to the novel upon which it's based. First, Bill Murray's performance is terrible (unless you think someone who's questioning the meaning of existence should be on the verge of breaking in to a sketch comedy at all times). Secondly, the film's director, John Byrum (who's done some odd, but interesting film work), seems overwhelmed by the material. Third, the supporting cast isn't terribly strong (even the great Denholm Elliott is wasted here). Lastly, Murray and Byrum created the screenplay and sadly reworked several key scenes that, in essence, defeat the meaning of Maugham's original text. So, the long and short of it is that we're left with a film that has many good intentions, but is really a confused mess. I've noticed that several reviewers here on Amazon (even those who profess to love the film) don't fully understand the message/intent behind it and I believe that's likely because of the confusion created by a screenplay that's the product of writers who themselves may very well have not fully understood Maugham's text. In addition, I've read many reviews here on Amazon that state Roger Ebert gave the film a good rating. This simply isn't true (Google ""Ebert and Razor's Edge"" to read his original review online).I do applaud the idea of bringing this wonderful work to the screen. Moreover, the cinematography & costumes are quite good and the soundtrack (seeThe Razor's Edge Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) to the film is very engaging, which isn't surprising since it's the work of longtime film composer Jack Nitzsche.

While Bill Murray might be best known for films like Ghostbusters, he deserves much greater recognition for his role in The Razor's Edge; as much for his acting ability as his ability to adapt the script to his unique stage presence. While it is a favorite of mine, it should be recognized as one of the best films ever made (am I oveselling it?).For those who have read Maugham's novel, the stuffiness and pretense are replaced with life, vibrance, and cinematic scope. This is one of those movies that struts films occasional superiority to the written word. Grand vistas, poignant staging (the final staircase exit), and again Bill Murray.The movie retains all that is essential from the novel. Yet somehow, by not taking itself too seriously, Larry Darrel (Murray) is a more effective protagonist and philosopher. At each viewing I'm tempted to flee my cubicle for good and go in search of the meaning of life. Now that's power!Ultimately, it seems a shame that such worthwhile films as this gather dust while Ghostbusters airs weekly on TBS and the like. Buy the DVD now (even with its shortcomings). You will at least be entertained by Murray's wisecracks (and a funny if brief performance from his brother Doyle).

336266,A31TNJ8U99TP0,6302800498,pokemon mom,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie years ago, and I'm a big fan of Somerset Maughn, Bill Murray - not so much.  I do applaud his desire to give this story shape by making it into a movie.  For me the story was not so much about spirituality - although the film tries to drive that point through repeatedly.  But rather it was the dysfunctional jealousy and overwhelming need to possess another human being, that struck home with me.  Bill Murray's character, after a long absence from home, returns to find all his friends lives have moved on, so to speak.  Theresa Russell's character, was married and had children - which she tragically lost in an accident.  The accident killed her entire family, and she is left alone.  She turns to opium... so Bill Murray's character trys to get her off the drug.  In the process they fall in love, paint a house, decide to marry.  It's a beautiful thing.  She finds a reason to live again... They have another friend who is married and is secretly jealous, she wants Bill Murray all to herself.  She does not care that she is affluent, respected, and in a higher station in life... she claims she wants to protect Bill Murray's character from marrying beneath him, or at least what she thinks is beneath him...  However, Bill Murray and Theresa Russell have never been happier...  she knows Theresa Russell has an addiction problem... so she sabatoges everything.  She claims she wants to ""help.""  But what she does is keep leaving Theresa Russel surrounded by bottles of alcohol, knowing this is a problem for her.  While she does this... she says things to make Theresa Russel very insecure... she says Bill Murray doesn't really love her, that he feels sorry for her, that it's just a token attachment... She makes up a lot of things so that Theresa Russell will feel bad because she really loves Bill Murray and doesn't want to make his life a living hell, the way this ""friend"" is suggesting will happen....  Well, the minute she turns her back and walks away... this friend from hell - Theresa Russel drinks and goes right back to opium.  She is found dead in the river with her throat slashed.  Bill Murray goes to this ""friend"" from hell... this woman who is married and apparently just wants to string Bill Murray in her web of deceit... and Bill Murray looks at her and tells her - you killed her as surely as if you had taken the knife to her throat yourself.  Bill Murray and Theresa Russel had a chance at happiness after both having suffered unbelievable emotional hardship with their families... and this woman couldn't stand to see anyone happy - she had to destroy it.  So she orchestrated the whole murder. She played on every weakness Theresa Russell had....If you enjoy emotional and psychological profiling - there's a lot here.... I thought the book was better and more articulate because that is Somerset Maughn's forte... I've read just about everything he's written... you need the narrators vision in order to do it justice...  For example he talks about how this ""friend"" is thin... not because she's fit or is naturally beautifully thin - but he calls it a self-imposed mortification of the flesh... words matter - and those words are not in the film...  If you say someone is skinny, or show a skinny woman on screen - it's a very different thing than if you describe her as suffering from a peculiear self-imposed mortification of the flesh....",3,A study of human jealousy,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,3396,"['saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Somerset', 'Maughn', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'applaud', 'desire', 'give', 'story', 'shape', 'making', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'spirituality', 'film', 'tries', 'drive', 'point', 'repeatedly', 'rather', 'was', 'dysfunctional', 'jealousy', 'overwhelming', 'need', 'possess', 'human', 'being', 'struck', 'home', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'long', 'absence', 'home', 'returns', 'find', 'friends', 'lives', 'have', 'moved', 'speak', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'character', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'tragically', 'lost', 'accident', 'accident', 'killed', 'entire', 'family', 'left', 'alone', 'opium', 'so', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'trys', 'get', 'off', 'drug', 'process', 'fall', 'love', 'paint', 'house', 'decide', 'marry', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'reason', 'live', 'again', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'married', 'secretly', 'jealous', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'herself', 'not', 'care', 'affluent', 'respected', 'higher', 'station', 'life', 'protect', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'character', 'marrying', 'beneath', 'least', 'what', 'beneath', 'However', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'happier', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'addiction', 'problem', 'so', 'everything', 'help', 'what', 'keep', 'leaving', 'Theresa', 'Russel', 'surrounded', 'bottles', 'alcohol', 'knowing', 'problem', 'things', 'make', 'Theresa', 'Russel', 'very', 'insecure', 'Bill', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'sorry', 'just', 'token', 'attachment', 'up', 'lot', 'things', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'will', 'feel', 'bad', 'really', 'Bill', 'Murray', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'way', 'friend', 'suggesting', 'will', 'happen', 'Well', 'minute', 'back', 'walks', 'away', 'friend', 'hell', 'Theresa', 'Russel', 'drinks', 'right', 'back', 'opium', 'found', 'dead', 'river', 'throat', 'slashed', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'friend', 'hell', 'woman', 'who', 'married', 'apparently', 'just', 'string', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'web', 'deceit', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'killed', 'as', 'surely', 'had', 'taken', 'knife', 'throat', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Theresa', 'Russel', 'had', 'chance', 'happiness', 'having', 'suffered', 'unbelievable', 'emotional', 'hardship', 'families', 'woman', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'see', 'anyone', 'happy', 'had', 'destroy', 'orchestrated', 'whole', 'murder', 'played', 'weakness', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'had', '.If', 'enjoy', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'profiling', 'lot', 'here', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'more', 'articulate', 'Somerset', 'Maughn', 'forte', ""'ve"", 'read', 'just', 'everything', 'written', 'need', 'narrators', 'vision', 'order', 'do', 'justice', 'example', 'how', 'friend', 'thin', 'not', 'fit', 'naturally', 'beautifully', 'thin', 'self-imposed', 'mortification', 'flesh', 'words', 'matter', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'say', 'someone', 'skinny', 'show', 'skinny', 'woman', 'screen', 'very', 'different', 'thing', 'describe', 'suffering', 'peculiear', 'self-imposed', 'mortification', 'flesh']",Razor's Edge VHS

As someone who has carefully avoided Saturday Night Live and wouldn't see Caddyshack on a bet, I was really surprised to see Bill Murray's face on a film based on Sumerset Maugham's novel.Wow!  I think I was lucky to have avoided Murray's comic roles (I did see and like Lost in Translation and Groundhog Day) because I didn't have a lot of preconceptions to overcome.  Likewise I hadn't read the novel or see the Tyrone Power version of the film.  I was free to just take this as it was.And it was .....beautiful.  I was captured by Murray's performance from the beginning.  You can tell that this was a labor of love on his part -- he is so present and intense that his performance touches one deeply.  The casting was perfect.  Theresa Rusell is perfect as the tragically poetic Sophie. (Wasn't the beautiful prostitute in Crime and Punishment also named Sophie?) Everyone else is perfectly cast, including the most despicable Isobel, Catherine Hicks.I did have a bit of disappointment at the end when Murray's character walked through Paris in that same wooden, expressionless way.  Somehow that robotic walk which was so effective during most of the film, felt wrong in the end.  More movement would have been better.  Small quibble, though.

Nonetheless, I owe the discovery of this book (and author) to Murray, because I'd read of his desire to make the movie back in the early 80s and it created enough curiosity in me to read the book prior to the movie's arrival.Bill did well in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation because those roles allowed enough flexibility for the irreverence and class clownishness that is his stock in trade. As Larry Darrell, a man seeking meaning in life, Murray sadly falls short of the mark. Instead of playing a damaged man seeking purpose and enlightenment, he comes across as a guy who chooses simplicity over wealth; granted a part of the process, but not the end all. Thus, Murray's Darrell seems superficial in his spirituality.In fact, the only character who seems well cast is Denholm Elliott as the snobbish socialite Elliott Templeton, who narrates the novel and gives critical perspective. Unfortunately, he's wasted and relegated to only half of his character's capacity in this movie, and played more for laughs than anything else. Theresa Russell nails the bitter and tragic Sophie, but unfortunately never allows us to see Sophie's initial mild-mannered naivet&eacute;.Ironically enough, the information I've read from other reviewers is that Murray went into a bit of a funk after this movie bombed. His suffering may have brought him a clarity and wisdom he hadn't yet attained with his superstar fame in the early 80s. That a better version of this movie may have been possible only after Murray failed in his initial attempt is profundity fitting Larry's search.If this movie leads you to Maugham and this powerful book, then that merits at least a viewing, so I can't say that I don't recommend it.

336274,AJYGQV81FSFE2,6302800498,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[0, 0]","One cannot help but be mesmerized by the wordcraft of Willy Maugham. Perhaps the best novel of all time is his ""The Moon and Sixpence,"" a quasi-biographical social commentary of late 19th early 20th century mores and expectations.In this fine novel, ""The Razor's Edge,"" Larry, a young veteral of WWI, destined to financial ""success"" decides to go on the route to--pardon the cliche--""enlightenment."" The woman who loves him, Izzy, cannot stomach that and marries Gray Maturin, Larry's buddy who'se always been in love with Izzy.Well, heaven knows other reviewers have covered the stories theme so I won't repeat that here.As I travelled in the same portions of the world through with Larry treked--though not with anywhere near the conscientious ""search"" that Larry had on his mind, I always rather idenfied with the character, in the novel and in the film. The film's music--yes, I have the soundtrack--fits the story very well.I talked, however, with an associate a few years ago who pointed out a trait of the film that I hadn't considered before: one is always waiting for Bill Murray (Larry) to become Bill Murray, either an off the cuff crack, or something of that nature. In a way he does a few times, but it fits well into the script, even complements it. So, while that may be the viewer's problem rather than the film's, it's still true. One just expects that, I guess, from Murray.The only other comment I have relates to what the novel included and the film could not:That I recall, in the novel, the author points out that Larry had the luxury of adequate ""resources"" (money) to pursue enlightenment. So your average ""Joe,"" even if his conscience begged him to pursue what Larry did, couldn't dream of pursuing it. It costs money, takes time away from paying one's bills, paying attention to one's loved ones--what most of us would call ""reality.""Now, many will say, ""That's the point! That's what Larry gave up,"" to the wonderfully exclamatory comments of the author throughout the novel. But that ""reality"" is conditioned by ones ability--based on those ""resources""--to pursue one's dreams, or enlightenment, something perhaps more than we know would pursue if they could.Again, that would have been very difficult to fit into the film, but was at least mentioned in the novelAside from that I recommend the film--the earlier Tyrone Power release and this one--and the wonderful novel, and perhaps, if time and ""resources"" permit--pursue your own dreams.",4,Good film based on the book of one of history's great novelists,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,2469,"['One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'wordcraft', 'Willy', 'Maugham', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'novel', 'time', 'Moon', 'Sixpence', 'quasi-biographical', 'social', 'commentary', 'late', '19th', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'mores', 'expectations.In', 'fine', 'novel', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'Larry', 'young', 'veteral', 'WWI', 'destined', 'financial', 'success', 'decides', 'go', 'route', 'pardon', 'cliche', 'enlightenment', 'woman', 'who', 'Izzy', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'marries', 'Gray', 'Maturin', 'Larry', 'buddy', ""who'se"", 'always', 'been', 'love', 'Izzy.Well', 'heaven', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'stories', 'theme', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here.As', 'travelled', 'same', 'portions', 'world', 'Larry', 'treked', 'not', 'anywhere', 'conscientious', 'search', 'Larry', 'had', 'mind', 'always', 'rather', 'idenfied', 'character', 'novel', 'film', 'film', 'music', 'yes', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'very', 'well.I', 'talked', 'however', 'associate', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'who', 'pointed', 'out', 'trait', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'considered', 'one', 'always', 'waiting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Larry', 'become', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'either', 'off', 'cuff', 'crack', 'something', 'nature', 'way', 'few', 'times', 'well', 'script', 'even', 'So', 'may', 'be', 'viewer', 'problem', 'rather', 'film', 'still', 'true', 'One', 'just', 'guess', 'Murray.The', 'only', 'other', 'comment', 'have', 'relates', 'what', 'novel', 'included', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'recall', 'novel', 'author', 'out', 'Larry', 'had', 'luxury', 'adequate', 'resources', 'money', 'pursue', 'enlightenment', 'average', 'Joe', 'even', 'conscience', 'begged', 'pursue', 'what', 'Larry', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'dream', 'pursuing', 'money', 'time', 'away', 'paying', 'one', 'bills', 'paying', 'attention', 'one', 'loved', 'ones', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'call', 'reality', 'Now', 'many', 'will', 'say', 'point', 'what', 'Larry', 'gave', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'exclamatory', 'comments', 'author', 'novel', 'reality', 'conditioned', 'ones', 'ability', 'based', 'resources', 'pursue', 'one', 'dreams', 'enlightenment', 'something', 'perhaps', 'more', 'know', 'would', 'pursue', 'could.Again', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'fit', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'mentioned', 'novelAside', 'recommend', 'film', 'earlier', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'release', 'one', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'time', 'resources', 'permit', 'pursue', 'own', 'dreams']",Razor's Edge VHS
336275,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302800498,Westley,"[7, 17]","This movie was poorly reviewed by critics when it came out in 1984, and I had little interest to see it until I recently read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham.  Bill Murray plays Larry, a young man who fights in WWI and comes back a changed man.  Following the war, he begins a spiritual quest for the meaning of life, which leads him to Eurpoe and Asia.  He later meets up again with some of his American friends in Paris, where the film's denouement takes place.It's always a pretty interesting movie; however, Murray is severely miscast.  In the book, Larry is a very genial and sincere guy, but Murray plays him as a bit of a clown.  His performance makes the film too erratic in tone.  Fans of the novel will also likely be disappointed by several changes - the author is not present in the film and Elliot's role is greatly diminished.  Overall, fans of Murray and the novel are likely to be let down.",3,OK adaptation,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,907,"['movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'reviewed', 'critics', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1984', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'see', 'recently', 'read', 'novel', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Larry', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'WWI', 'back', 'changed', 'man', 'Following', 'war', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'meaning', 'life', 'Eurpoe', 'Asia', 'later', 'up', 'again', 'American', 'friends', 'Paris', 'where', 'film', 'denouement', 'place.It', 'always', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'movie', 'however', 'Murray', 'severely', 'miscast', 'book', 'Larry', 'very', 'genial', 'sincere', 'guy', 'Murray', 'bit', 'clown', 'performance', 'film', 'too', 'erratic', 'tone', 'Fans', 'novel', 'will', 'also', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'several', 'changes', 'author', 'not', 'present', 'film', 'Elliot', 'role', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'Overall', 'fans', 'Murray', 'novel', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'let', 'down']",Razor's Edge VHS
