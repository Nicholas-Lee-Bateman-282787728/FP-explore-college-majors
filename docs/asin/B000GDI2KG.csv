Jimmy Martin provides some commentary and scenes of impromptu jam sessions and people wandering the camp grounds are also included.But the focus here is on the musicians playing on stage and what an incredible line-up it is. Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs, the Osborne Brothers and the Country Gentleman are just a few of the outstanding artists that perform. There is even a band from Japan and a banjo centered stage jam that is excellent.In addition, the DVD has a ""time machine"" element to it, as you really do feel transported back to the early 70's with the clothes, the hair and the laid back atmosphere.This is highly recommended to all fans of that uniquely American music they call bluegrass.",5,Great Performances At A 1971 Bluegrass Festival,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,785,"['performance', 'based', 'documentary', '1971', 'bluegrass', 'festival', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Jimmy', 'Martin', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'impromptu', 'jam', 'sessions', 'people', 'wandering', 'camp', 'grounds', 'are', 'also', 'included.But', 'focus', 'here', 'musicians', 'playing', 'stage', 'what', 'incredible', 'line-up', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'Earl', 'Scruggs', 'Osborne', 'Brothers', 'Country', 'Gentleman', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'outstanding', 'artists', 'perform', 'even', 'band', 'Japan', 'banjo', 'centered', 'stage', 'jam', 'excellent.In', 'addition', 'DVD', 'time', 'machine', 'element', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'transported', 'back', 'early', '70', 'clothes', 'hair', 'laid', 'back', 'atmosphere.This', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'uniquely', 'American', 'music', 'call', 'bluegrass']",N/A

1002191,A19SPM4Y7A8OHN,B000GDI2KG,MrQ,"[5, 5]","This is like entering a time machine and what a pleasure it is.The filmmakers have brilliantly captured the essence of what Bluegrass was at this brief point in 1971. It was just after the beginning of the ""Bluegrass Festival"". On this Labor Day weekend it was bloody hot, dusty, and, as you can tell by segments filmed out in the camping area, people slept in primative tents, vans, cars; sat in pre-war style lawn chairs, drank cheap beer, ate bologna sandwiches, and dressed in clothes unworthy even of a goodwill store today.What the fans did not lack though, was a passion for Bluegrass that ran 24/7. Long late night jams was standard fare back then (they are rare today), and note that it did not stop with the fans. Some of the artists appearing on stage found their way to the jams after hours.Anyone familiar with the genre will be surprised at the number of recognizable faces appearing on stage (although most were so young that it may require a second or third viewing to realize). Although they would all become names in their own right in later years, on this day, for most of the artists, it was probably their first gig for September (for many, 15 to 18 more locales would be demanded of them that month--that's how vigorous the business was then); and they simply wanted the heat to end, get paid, and travel all night to the next show.Some of the memorable appearances are Earl Scruggs, Mac Wiseman, Jimmy Martin, Roy Acuff, Ralph Stanley, The Country Gentlemen, Chubby Wise, and Don Stover. This is only a subset though---there are several more. The presence of drums and amps on stage during the Osborne Brothers' tracks is noted. It brings joy to this reviewer to know that one of their performances during this era was captured on film. The viewer who enjoys all kinds of music will notice that the genre was not destroyed because of those devices---it was still Bluegrass, and in this reviewer's opinion, the energy of their performances is multiple levels above the other bands.As if this wasn't enough, the DVD features a commentary track (by Fred Bartenstein), and it too is top notch and worth a listen.To anyone who cherishes Bluegrass Music and the artists who put it on the map, this DVD is a must-have addition to your library.",5,A definite must have---emotional to those recalling that time,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,2259,"['entering', 'time', 'machine', 'what', 'pleasure', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'brilliantly', 'captured', 'essence', 'what', 'Bluegrass', 'was', 'brief', 'point', '1971', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'Bluegrass', 'Festival', 'Labor', 'Day', 'weekend', 'was', 'bloody', 'hot', 'dusty', 'can', 'tell', 'segments', 'filmed', 'out', 'camping', 'area', 'people', 'slept', 'primative', 'tents', 'vans', 'cars', 'sat', 'pre-war', 'style', 'lawn', 'chairs', 'drank', 'cheap', 'beer', 'ate', 'bologna', 'sandwiches', 'dressed', 'clothes', 'unworthy', 'even', 'goodwill', 'store', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'lack', 'was', 'passion', 'Bluegrass', 'ran', '24/7', 'Long', 'late', 'night', 'jams', 'was', 'standard', 'fare', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'rare', 'today', 'note', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'fans', 'artists', 'appearing', 'stage', 'found', 'way', 'jams', 'hours.Anyone', 'familiar', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'number', 'recognizable', 'appearing', 'stage', 'most', 'were', 'so', 'young', 'may', 'require', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'realize', 'would', 'become', 'names', 'own', 'right', 'later', 'years', 'day', 'most', 'artists', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'gig', 'September', 'many', '15', '18', 'more', 'locales', 'would', 'be', 'demanded', 'month', 'how', 'vigorous', 'business', 'was', 'then', 'simply', 'wanted', 'heat', 'end', 'get', 'paid', 'travel', 'night', 'next', 'show.Some', 'memorable', 'appearances', 'are', 'Earl', 'Scruggs', 'Mac', 'Wiseman', 'Jimmy', 'Martin', 'Roy', 'Acuff', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'Country', 'Gentlemen', 'Chubby', 'Wise', 'Don', 'Stover', 'only', 'subset', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'presence', 'drums', 'amps', 'stage', 'Osborne', 'Brothers', 'tracks', 'noted', 'joy', 'reviewer', 'know', 'one', 'performances', 'era', 'was', 'captured', 'film', 'viewer', 'who', 'kinds', 'music', 'will', 'notice', 'genre', 'was', 'not', 'destroyed', 'devices', '-it', 'was', 'still', 'Bluegrass', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'energy', 'performances', 'multiple', 'levels', 'other', 'bands.As', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'Fred', 'Bartenstein', 'too', 'top', 'notch', 'worth', 'listen.To', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bluegrass', 'Music', 'artists', 'who', 'put', 'map', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'addition', 'library']",N/A
1002192,A5Y1PJIOU21WD,B000GDI2KG,Paul Magnussen,"[2, 2]","This 1971 DVD is an interesting historical document.  It should be an interesting musical document too, and to a certain extent it is.  Unfortunately, the producers seem unable to believe in their own product; that is, believe that seeing and hearing Bluegrass musicians could be enough to hold anyone's interest unaided.  Despite the presence of some classic artists and classic line-ups, the camera is constantly cutting away.  Performances are interrupted by voice-overs, or simply cut short.The prize example is the opening number, which features Don Stover, one of the most interesting banjoists of that era, whom I never had the chance to see live. Of its 4'10"", all but 1'04"" shows (among other things) a barn, a dog, a horse, a session playing something different, people arriving, or people simply wandering about.  The next number, from Ralph Stanley with both Keith Whitley and Ricky Skaggs, is interrupted by a voice-over... and so on throughout the music.That said, there's still a great deal to enjoy of Bluegrass both old and (then) new: Chubby Wise, Del McCoury, The Country Gentlemen, a very young Tony Rice on his last gig with The Bluegrass Alliance, the Osborne Brothers (too bad about the drums)... even the Japanese group Bluegrass 45 are interestingly bad.  The extras include a second version with some very informative commentary.But the unexpected highlight of the show for me was a snippet of a quartet, labelled simply ""Nighttime Jam Session"".  It was so dead-centre of what good Bluegrass is about that for a couple of seconds I thought it was Ralph Stanley.
