694933,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B000063ENZ,Grindhouse and Horror,"[0, 0]","This film involves a group participating in a reality TV show where they travel through a haunted house that has these humanoid fiends wearing cloaks. The film has no nudity, and it doesn't really have any suspense or much effective atmosphere. The scenery and characters are also uninteresting, and it isn't scary at all. What it does have going for it is the gore. Some of the gore involves a woman being grappled and you see her guts splatter on the floor; a scene where a girl is pulled up through a chimney and her guts and bones splatter down; and a gory blood-spraying decapitation as well as some other gory scenes, like an intestine munching scene near the end. The film has some unnecessary filler, and it's a little bit slow in parts. In between the gore, the film may bore some people because there isn't much interesting stuff happening. Some of that unnecessary dialogue hurts the film; they should've taken out some dialogue scenes because it just slows up the pace. The only reason to see this flick is for the violence and gore. Since this is just an exploitation flick, the decision to not include any nudity hurts the film as well. A lot of the film is dimly lit, so this also might annoy some people.  I thought the cloaked fiends were cool and liked the gore, but whether or not you'll like it will depend on your taste.The movie has grain, but I thought it looked good overall. There are plenty of extras on the DVD. The teaser trailer is well done and has good music, but the best extra is the short flick called MULVA: ZOMBIE ASS KICKER. This short film is a shot-on-VHS piece of garbage. This is a ridiculous short horror comedy about a candy and junk-food addicted geek who has her Halloween interrupted by zombies. It has cheap gore and is absolutely awful. It was so bad that I enjoyed it; at least you get an entire short movie for an extra feature.",4,Gory low-budget horror that may bore some people,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1878,"['film', 'group', 'participating', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'where', 'travel', 'haunted', 'house', 'humanoid', 'fiends', 'wearing', 'cloaks', 'film', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'suspense', 'much', 'effective', 'atmosphere', 'scenery', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'uninteresting', ""n't"", 'scary', 'What', 'have', 'going', 'gore', 'gore', 'woman', 'being', 'grappled', 'see', 'guts', 'splatter', 'floor', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'pulled', 'up', 'chimney', 'guts', 'bones', 'splatter', 'down', 'gory', 'blood-spraying', 'decapitation', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'gory', 'scenes', 'intestine', 'munching', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'unnecessary', 'filler', 'little', 'bit', 'slow', 'parts', 'gore', 'film', 'may', 'bore', 'people', ""n't"", 'much', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'happening', 'unnecessary', 'dialogue', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'out', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'just', 'up', 'pace', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'flick', 'violence', 'gore', 'just', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'decision', 'not', 'include', 'nudity', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'film', 'dimly', 'lit', 'also', 'might', 'annoy', 'people', 'thought', 'cloaked', 'fiends', 'were', 'cool', 'liked', 'gore', 'not', ""'ll"", 'like', 'will', 'depend', 'taste.The', 'movie', 'grain', 'thought', 'looked', 'good', 'overall', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'DVD', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'music', 'best', 'extra', 'short', 'flick', 'called', 'MULVA', 'ZOMBIE', 'ASS', 'KICKER', 'short', 'film', 'shot-on-VHS', 'piece', 'garbage', 'ridiculous', 'short', 'horror', 'comedy', 'candy', 'junk-food', 'addicted', 'geek', 'who', 'Halloween', 'interrupted', 'zombies', 'cheap', 'gore', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'least', 'get', 'entire', 'short', 'movie', 'extra', 'feature']",Hell Asylum

They give the rundown and history of the house and spend half the movie showing interveiw style introductions to eacxh character. One by one they start off on there challenge and one by one there picked off by the worst looking ghosts off all time.It's all filmed like a stupid reality TV show. The weird thing is, when 2 guys are setting up the cameras in the house, they are putting down RTV which I liked, but thats it as far as mocking the stupid RTV stuff, it trys to just be a RTV show after that.The ghosts are just black hooded coats with blue Darth Maul makeup on who just raise there arms and then eat knitting string dipped in pigs blood trying to get the effect of eating someones guts for absolutly no reason.The characters are lame, they focus too much on one character and then kill her off before you eyes, they add stupid little side plots to it, they show nothing of the house, it leaves many questions to be asked and the end is total and utter crap.The film starts to look like it's about to get exciting and start to go somewhere, but before it does, the credits roll ater a predictable phrase.I'm glad my edition doesnt come with the extras 'cause I wouldnt have wanted to see them anyway. This film completly rips off the remake of House On Haunted hill.If you think this movie was the slightest bit entertaining, then go and find House On Haunted Hill (98/99?) and see what this badly titled film Hell Asylum is ripping off in an already done RTV satire.And who the heck are the other ghosts??? It explains who one of them is, but about 3 are seen... plus they needed to show the frankenstein bride they talk about.

694939,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000063ENZ,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","For years now the world has been subjected to some of the worst B horror out there courtesy of Full Moon Pictures (well worst or best depending of how you see it). There hasn't been a let up for the past decade which is something the brothers Sid couldn't be more happy about. Yeah sure these movies are simply awful at best, but provide enough entertainment value to keep us coming back for more year after year. One would ask what could possibly draw anybody to a film called Hell Asylum that has such an awful looking cover? Well for us it's simple. We have two reasons: 1) Joe Estevez! 2) It's a film we had previously watched nearly 8 years ago late on a Saturday night. So obviously it's worth it for us just on sentimental value alone. Please...most couldn't stomach this one to watch it all the way through once and you've got us revisiting it for a second time. Oh..no..no..not a second time.Hell Asylum opens up the only way it should, with a 10 minutes injection of Joe Estevez whose screen name here is Stan the investor. See Stan is getting pitched the idea for a new horror reality show in which he decides to invest all his savings of Arby's coupons into. Once the coupons clear the show starts rolling in what seems to be a county building closed for a long weekend. Our guess was the director was the janitor for this building and had the key to let the crew in to shoot for a couple days. The concept behind the show is to have 5 ""hot"" chicks stay in a haunted house to face their fears. So it's somewhat of a B show within an even more B movie. What isn't known is the building is really haunted by a few guy's that walk around in black robes. One by one they kill the crew and eat their insides, which were nothing more then red rope licorice with raspberry jelly poured on top. And that's pretty much the entire movie in full detail.In good conscience we could never recommend Hell Asylum on a serious level, but could recommend it to those who want to see nothing more then about 15 minutes of Joe Estevez. His acting in this one is so over the top it will leave you in tears and amazement in the fact he keeps getting work. Clearly he hasn't earned more then $50 for any of these roles but just having a job in today's economy is a good thing. Despite it's horrific acting, zero plot, and even less scares then you'd imagine it was still enjoyable to revisit it. Mostly because it took the old boy Sid back to better days...but even more then that Joe Estevez! We can't get enough of Uncle Joe and his horrendous acting which is what earned Hell Asylum a very generous 3 star rating. If you do decide you spend your time watching it make you you don't pay much for it.",3,Forget the girls...Uncle Joe Estevez is hottest thing Hell Asylum has to offer,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,2691,"['years', 'now', 'world', 'been', 'subjected', 'worst', 'B', 'horror', 'there', 'courtesy', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Pictures', 'well', 'worst', 'best', 'depending', 'how', 'see', ""n't"", 'been', 'let', 'up', 'past', 'decade', 'something', 'brothers', 'Sid', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'Yeah', 'sure', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'best', 'provide', 'enough', 'entertainment', 'value', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'year', 'year', 'One', 'would', 'ask', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'draw', 'anybody', 'film', 'called', 'Hell', 'Asylum', 'awful', 'looking', 'cover', 'Well', 'simple', 'have', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'Joe', 'Estevez', '2', 'film', 'had', 'previously', 'watched', 'nearly', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'late', 'Saturday', 'night', 'So', 'obviously', 'just', 'sentimental', 'value', 'alone', 'Please', 'most', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'one', 'watch', 'way', 'once', ""'ve"", 'got', 'revisiting', 'second', 'time', 'second', 'time.Hell', 'Asylum', 'up', 'only', 'way', 'should', '10', 'minutes', 'injection', 'Joe', 'Estevez', 'screen', 'name', 'here', 'Stan', 'investor', 'See', 'Stan', 'getting', 'pitched', 'idea', 'new', 'horror', 'reality', 'show', 'invest', 'savings', 'Arby', 'coupons', 'coupons', 'clear', 'show', 'rolling', 'what', 'be', 'county', 'building', 'closed', 'long', 'weekend', 'guess', 'was', 'director', 'was', 'janitor', 'building', 'had', 'key', 'let', 'crew', 'shoot', 'couple', 'days', 'concept', 'show', 'have', '5', 'hot', 'chicks', 'stay', 'haunted', 'house', 'face', 'fears', 'somewhat', 'B', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'B', 'movie', 'What', ""n't"", 'known', 'building', 'really', 'haunted', 'few', 'guy', 'walk', 'black', 'robes', 'One', 'one', 'kill', 'crew', 'eat', 'insides', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'red', 'rope', 'licorice', 'raspberry', 'jelly', 'poured', 'top', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'movie', 'full', 'detail.In', 'good', 'conscience', 'could', 'never', 'recommend', 'Hell', 'Asylum', 'serious', 'level', 'could', 'recommend', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', '15', 'minutes', 'Joe', 'Estevez', 'acting', 'one', 'so', 'top', 'will', 'leave', 'tears', 'amazement', 'fact', 'getting', 'work', 'Clearly', ""n't"", 'earned', 'more', 'then', '50', 'roles', 'just', 'having', 'job', 'today', 'economy', 'good', 'thing', 'horrific', 'acting', 'zero', 'plot', 'even', 'less', 'scares', 'then', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'revisit', 'Mostly', 'took', 'old', 'boy', 'Sid', 'back', 'better', 'days', 'even', 'more', 'then', 'Joe', 'Estevez', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'what', 'earned', 'Hell', 'Asylum', 'very', 'generous', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'do', 'decide', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much']",Hell Asylum
