A Christian lives in an American Muslim community, a family man uses steroids, supplements, and exercise to transform himself with an alleged ""fountain of youth,"" a New York couple trade their consumer conveniences to live on a eco-farm, and a born-again Christian lives in San Francisco's gay community--to name all but a few scenarios.  Spurlock himself injects interesting information to interrupt the absorbing drama with all its adjustments and turmoil.  First hand the participants learn what it is to live like someone else, and the audience's second-hand experience is amongst the best of reality television.  Informative and entertaining, '30 Days' is worth the forty minutes each episode presents.",5,In Another's Shoes,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,856,"['Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'FX', 'reality', 'show', 'Days', 'fascinating', 'adventure', 'where', 'participants', 'trade', 'lifestyles', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'lives', 'Christian', 'American', 'Muslim', 'community', 'family', 'man', 'steroids', 'supplements', 'exercise', 'transform', 'alleged', 'fountain', 'youth', 'New', 'York', 'couple', 'trade', 'consumer', 'conveniences', 'live', 'eco-farm', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'lives', 'San', 'Francisco', 'gay', 'community', 'name', 'few', 'scenarios', 'Spurlock', 'interesting', 'information', 'interrupt', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'adjustments', 'turmoil', 'First', 'hand', 'participants', 'learn', 'what', 'live', 'someone', 'else', 'audience', 'second-hand', 'experience', 'best', 'reality', 'television', 'Informative', 'entertaining', ""'30"", 'Days', 'forty', 'minutes', 'episode', 'presents']",30 Days - Season 1
979762,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000EXDRZ8,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 7]","I must admit, I am one of those viewers that was blown away by Morgan Spurlock's fascinating documentary entitled Super Size Me.  While some will argue that it was a purely one sided debate, I thought it rivaled that of Michael Moore, causing America to look inward at an issue plaguing our communities.  That is why I was very excited to learn that Morgan was not going to merely stop with the big McBusiness, but also focus more attention towards that growing, constantly changing, and always different community at large.  With ""30 Days"" he uses his same technique patented in Super Size Me which consists of someone following a untypical path for thirty days in all hopes that they will experience and see a new facet of America.  With each episode an hour long, creator Spurlock gives us the reality-based television that we all desire while also giving us a great glimpse of diversity, opinions, and a constantly changing society.  From a binge drinking mother of a party-hard college freshman to that of a heterosexual farm boy living for 30 days in a homosexual community, Spurlock is not afraid to go into a new topic headfirst.  We are given the chance to see if stubborn ideals do change, or if it were just an experiment gone bad.  Just as Morgan introduces each program, we only learn within the course of ""30 Days"".With a powerful jolt of energy and no-holds-bar honesty, Spurlock jumps directly into this series by focusing directly on himself and a current crisis in the United States, which is the minimum wage.  For 30 days, Morgan and his fianc&eacute;e live at the poverty line, experiencing what it would be like to live without - constantly working and sleeping in bug infested apartments - as a typical American.  While Morgan poses many other questions through the course of this first season, this initial episode is by far the most shocking.  As Morgan and his fianc&eacute;e struggle, we the viewer, cannot help but see the point that he is trying to make.  We see the issue at hand, and just like Super Size Me, he builds thesis backed with extremely detailed points.  As our series continues, Morgan does a great job with ideas, but it is ultimately the final result that just doesn't quite pack the same wallop that this initial episode enormously did.Other topics that Morgan explores in this series is the concept of a Christian living in a Muslim world, a man attempting to defy the issue of aging with medical technology, and my personal favorite (because it was the worst test Morgan did), the effects of binge drinking on a college mother.  While I will admit that I could not stop watching this series, I had trouble with some of them because it fell into the classic world of ""reality television"".  By watching this series, we knew that by the end the subject would reconsider their lifestyle; we knew that Morgan's experiment would be somewhat of a success, because most television series like to end on a positive note.  We, the viewer, like to think that a person can change and that our world is getting better.  I believe that I would have seen more strength and value in this program if Morgan would have chosen subjects that would not change, or chose not to change even being consumed in a new lifestyle for thirty days.  I sometimes felt that I could fast-forward to the very end of the episode and already know what the final conclusion was, due to a lacking conflict.  What I mean is that in the initial episode, Morgan continued to get hurt, causing monetary issues throughout the experiment, but in the rest, I felt there wasn't this conflict (or eruption of random occurrences), which honestly makes for stronger television.Don't get me wrong, I thought that this style of programming is very smart and extremely creative, but I just felt that it lacked in the ""entertainment"" side.  I think I was initially caught into this series because of how unique it was, but later found out that was nothing more than a small-screen version of Super Size Me.  Again, nothing wrong with this, but I felt that by the end of this initial season, Spurlock was running short of ideas, as well as engrossing combinations.  The example that comes to mind was the final (and my least favorite) episode with the binge drinking mother.  Why did she do this to herself?  Spurlock attempted to make connections between college drinking and a mother drinking the same way, but the overall results seemed muddled and very disconnected.  Why would any mother have casual conversations with her daughter about getting ""drunk""?  This whole episode seemed oddly surreal and completely beyond the normality of any mother/daughter relationship.Overall, I believe Spurlock to be witty, engaging, and completely intelligent about this series, but it is television (and he does ride the curtails of Super Size Me a bit much), and there is only a certain level that your creativity can go before it becomes stock.  I applaud ""30 Days"" for going above and beyond, and I especially applaud FX (whom I believe is challenging the likes of Showtime and HBO) for bringing this series to light.  I will watch the second season, but I will go in a little less excited.  I think Spurlock has a winner with this series, he just needs to strengthen his topics, become a bit grittier with his subjects, and really shock his audience like he did with his initial episode.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Small Screen Spurlock,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,5400,"['must', 'admit', 'am', 'one', 'viewers', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'fascinating',

Now, someone has finally come along with ""expose TV"" where a subject ""lives the life"" for 30 days.

Some of the subjects covered are living life of minimum wage, homophobia, American views of the Muslim religion, America's obsession with Anti-Aging, Binge drinking and more.

979764,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B000EXDRZ8,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[1, 1]","I really have to hand it to Spurlock - the ""fish out of water"" concept has been hacked to death in so many formats, be it drama or reality show. However, this DVD presents the idea well and is both entertaining AND informative. For me, the most informative segment is the one that deals with the Muslim religion. It would be difficult for anyone to hold the typical stereotypes that have become standard since 9/11 after watching this episode. The homophobe in the Castro district episode is also a brilliantly done turn on what opens up a man's views to make him not only tolerant but more understanding of people and a ""lifestyle"" that he was once taught to hate. The only episode that had me shaking my head was the one of the binge-drinking mom. Both mother and daughter are totally clueless; the mother's permisive upbringing of her daughter means she will have very little effect on the daughter, now in college. The daughter's steadfast belief that blacking out weekly is not a problem is absolutely disgusting. She's going to need more than luck if her behavior continues this way. The one good thing to come out of this is the younger son's POSSIBLE learning of how destructive it can be to live the life of a binge drinker. One can only hope. The Fountain of Youth show should be an eye-opener for those looking for quick fixes to turn back the clock. The cost can be extremely dangerous and effect others (although at times the wife in the episode comes off a little shrewish, it is refreshing to see that the she and the husband obviously care about each other). Spurlock actually takes the lead in one show trying to get by making minimum wage in Michigan with his girlfriend. Another eye-opener about how expensive just living can be, and the many things that can be taken for granted in America, but not by those just eeking out a $7/hour existence. Still, we all know that at the end of 30 days, Spurlock and his fiancee can pay any of the unpaid bills that are not incurred. Even knowing this, you can feel their stress.The style of the show is fantastic; the educational cartoons, the interviews on the streets getting people's perceptions, and the commentary by experts are all well done. The extra diary cams are a nice addition, as are the commentaries; about the only thing missing is a follow-up interview, but to be really effective it would have to mean the time lapse of about a year afterwards. Hopefully that can be done for future editions of this show. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

979771,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000EXDRZ8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Season 1 of Morgan Spurlock's 30 Days reality TV show provides us with great insights and education about important social, cultural and even environmental issues facing mankind today. The episodes all move along at a good pace and they each make their point without being overly preachy or rude. Morgan Spurlock himself inserts a brief commentary into each episode.This two DVD set has a total of 6 episodes some of which come with an optional audio commentary that enhances your understanding of the experience; watch the episode first and then re-watch it with any audio commentary there might be since the commentary won't let you hear what's being said. In addition, each episode has a ""lost diary cam"" bonus feature; this allows people and/or their partners to film themselves during the 30 day experience. It's fascinating!Here is a breakdown of the 6 episodes that you'll be able to watch on this 2 DVD set:Minimum Wage: Morgan and his fianc&eacute;e Alex work jobs that only pay the minimum wage or slightly above that. Can they make ends meet during their 30 day experiment to see if the minimum wage is enough to live on? Emergency room visits make things not be so easy. On the other hand, they really scrimp and save, even walking to work instead of spending for public transportation. Will they make it?Anti-Aging: Morgan Spurlock highlights the case of a 34 year old man whom he calls ""middle aged."" I didn't know I was so old! This man was quite the athlete in his younger years; but he has gained weight and he doesn't feel so energetic anymore. As a 30 day experiment, he decides to try an anti-aging drug regimen. Will this work? The effects on his life are really something.Muslims And America: A rather religious Christian man agrees to live with Muslims for 30 days. Can he reconcile himself to the possibility that their God is the same as his God and Jesus Christ? What about their religious teachings--are they the same or do they differ? If they differ, then in what ways do they differ? This episode is very well done.Straight Man In A Gay World:  A young straight man who loves his guns and the Bible travels to San Francisco's primarily gay Castro district to live, work and socialize with gay men. He attends a gay church and meets with their spiritual leader; he also meets with members of PFLAG (Parents and Friends Of Lesbians And Gays). Will this guy emerge from his 30 day experiment still believing that gays are sinners?Off The Grid: Two buddies (one man, one woman) move to a farm in Missouri where they must live in an ""eco-friendly"" village for 30 days. They must recycle everything and everything--including human waste which is used as fertilizer for planting food for the community. There's no electricity, no gas heat, no electric furnace or central air conditioning, either. How will they make it? Can they last the 30 days and see that they can reduce their ""carbon footprint?""Binge Drinking Mom: A woman is concerned about her college daughter's drinking. In fact, she's so concerned that she tries a 30 day trial of binge drinking to show her daughter the dangers and pitfalls of binge drinking. The daughter starts out very much in denial about her drinking and the potential problems that can result from drinking too much too often. Can this mother get her daughter to see the light after her own 30 day experiment?Overall, the 1st season of 30 Days is excellent. I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen and I practically devoured each episode. I highly recommend this for people who are concerned about the issues examined here; and people who want truly intelligent reality TV would do well to get this.

979772,A3PLI8V9LTC6MF,B000EXDRZ8,"Mr. Roger H. Geyer ""outcast_searcher""","[3, 4]","These 1 hour episodes seemed take care to be ""fair and balanced"", showing the given issue from multiple points of view, and stating empirical data -- to make the issues far more than the typical one-sided whining-fest so much of the ""news"" and ""news"" channel documentary shows offer these days. I was very pleasantly surprised how consistently this was done.Each episode had little ""pod"" sections where a particular aspect of the issue was amplified.  Morgan frequently took part in these, ensuring he had an active part in the series even when he wasn't in most of the episodes as originally planned.The episode with Morgan Spurlock and his girlfriend trying to survive on a minimum wage income was very interesting. They could have made it (barely) if they had no kids (actually, they have no kids, but they took in a couple of friend's or relatives kids, which resulted in a LOT of stress and spending in just 2 days) and never got sick. Of course in the real world, that doesn't happen. This dramatically shows the impact of modern medical costs to the poor. It also shows how the stresses of true poverty can play havoc with relationships. There were lots of good conversations and normal daily living issues that really brought the reality of miniumum wage living home.Unlike most of the commentary that goes with DVD movies, etc. these days, I thought that the commentary that went with each episode was VERY enlightening and well done.  It explained the main throughts and philosopy of some of the main folks producing the show, why they did things the way they did, and pointed out some of the techniques and key points that the viewer might not catch in one viewing.From these commentaries, I was happy to learn that apparently I ""got it"" -- that this show was about reaching out to people who lived radically different lives, and learning from the experience. (Think how much different the world could be if our first reaction to something we don't understand about someone was to try to empaphize with that person, instead of hurling insults (or worse)).Another key point of these commentaries was that they went with the flow of what REALLY happened in the episodes -- instead of trying to influence things or make them tell some tale that some producer wanted to get across.  Thus, for example -- one episode was only really 22 days and some commentary about the aftermath -- since for safety reasons the 30 days couldn't be completed.  Instead of trying to hide that or force the issue -- the producer and director just worked with that and made it an honest and integral part of the documentary. Gee. Reality TV that is actually about reality.  What a concept.The DVD set (two DVD's) was easy to navigate, and intuitive.  Each of the episodes had a commentary track, and also a ""missing documentary videos"" track, where the main character(s) in an episode spoke alone to the camera about their current thoughts and moods any night during the 30 days that they wished to.  Though the quality of these comments and insights varied widely, they added a nice extra behind-the-scenes dimension to the season which added some value to the DVD set, in my opinion.There were only six episodes, making a mighty short season.  This was the main drawback to me. Hopefully season two will have a more filled-out line-up, since this show has proven to be a winner for the F/X channel.I am editing an original review from watching 3 episodes on TV.

979777,ACTYP447JCDX0,B000EXDRZ8,Scott Bresinger,"[1, 2]","Like most people, I first encountered Morgan Spurlock through his hit documentary, ""Super Size Me,"" in which he goes on an all-McDonald's diet for a full month to see what would happen to his health. It was a brilliant conceit, even if some of his conclusions were questionable (one anti-Spurlock viewer staged a similar stunt, except he kept up his exercise routine during his ""diet,"" with no ill effect on his health, showing it's americans lack of exercise that's causing the obesity epidemic more than fast food.  Nevertheless, SSM was an effective piece of agitprop, so not wanting to abandon a good idea, his show for the FX network, ""30 Days,"" assigns various people ""life experiments"" for a full month to observe waht might happent to them.  While it's mostly fascinating, funny and even educational, you may find yourself asking some overlooked questions.In the pilot episode, Spurlock himself, along with his long-suffering fiance, attempt to live for a full month making minimum wage.  Between the two of them, they barely scrape by, and they don't even have children to feed.  His attempt to highlight the plight of the working poor (in an infotational manner) is often very moving, even angering.  To think that Congress continues to vote themselves raises while the minimum wage hasn't been raised in almost ten years!  After letting it sink in, however, questions arise.  Aren't there many public assistance programs designed to help the working poor?  Spurlock doesn't even mention this.In another episode, an average--i.e. somewhat flabby--American has a complete lifestyle change.  He goes on a combination of steroids and so-called Human Growth Hormone, along with a strict diet and exercise regime, to see if he can find the fountain of youth.  It's not giving anything away to report that he doesn't, although he does lose some weight.  It's eye-opening, but Spurlock never mentions what any reputable doctor could tell you: that simply having a better diet and more exercise can greatly improve your health, drug-free.Some of the other of these initial six episodes involve a Christian living with a Muslim family, and another Christian vecoming the houseguest of a gay man.  These are more successful, if only to show just how ignorant these average men of faith are about some of their fellow Americans.  In the end, they soften their opinions even if their lives aren't changed.After watching the shows (or listening the optional commentaries), you can decide for yourselves what, if any,questions need to be asked.  For myself, I admire Spurlock's attempt to treat sometimes divisive topics with humanity and an abundant sense of humor (there are many laugh-out-loud moments to be found here).  Still, like many of the participants, while I was enlightened a bit, my life was unchanged.

979779,AUB7WXM7IX81,B000EXDRZ8,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is Morgan Spurlock at his finest.  30 Days is compelling, thought-provoking, informative, and entertaining all at once.  It is easily the best reality show currently on television and possibly the best show on television right now.  The fact that it has been passed over for one Emmy award after another is nothing less than a travesty, especially when you consider the shows that actually win (30 Rock? Boston Legal?!)I do not give five-star reviews often, but I am emphatic in my opinion that this show deserves it.  Every episode tackles its subject matter intelligently and honestly, with Spurlock himself participating in one of his social experiments every season.  After Super Size Me, he took a chance on a reality show, a genre that had long worn out its value and welcome, and the results vastly exceed expectations (it certainly helps that it is on FX, a network with some courage).Supplanting a person from his or her lifestyle to one beyond his or her comfort zone for 30 days may seem gimmicky, but it's actually a perfect strategy.  It gives the individual enough exposure to effect a real change in his or her perspectives if he or she ever will, and it's worked every time so far, which is telling of us and our society.  Spurlock isn't content to merely shine light on the drama provoked by the scenario - he's after larger issues, and he uncovers his findings with tenacious precision, always commenting on the larger picture with astuteness, whether dealing with religious dichotomies, the sufficiency of minimum wage, binge drinking, or any other number of issues that affect us all.30 Days is a show that deserves to be seen.  Each episode shows the progress we can make if we just open ourselves up to other people's lives and ideas.  It comments on the very nature of our identities as human beings, flawed but capable of gradual change.  It's an important show that everyone can benefit from viewing.",5,Best Reality Series on Television,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,1930,"['Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'finest', '30', 'Days', 'compelling', 'thought-provoking', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'once', 'easily', 'best', 'reality', 'show', 'currently', 'television', 'possibly', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'fact', 'been', 'passed', 'one', 'Emmy', 'award', 'nothing', 'less', 'travesty', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'shows', 'actually', 'win', '30', 'Rock', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'often', 'am', 'emphatic', 'opinion', 'show', 'Every', 'episode', 'subject', 'matter', 'intelligently', 'honestly', 'Spurlock', 'participating', 'one', 'social', 'experiments', 'season', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'took', 'chance', 'reality', 'show', 'genre', 'had', 'long', 'worn', 'out', 'value', 'welcome', 'results', 'vastly', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'certainly', 'FX', 'network', 'courage', '.Supplanting', 'person', 'lifestyle', 'one', 'comfort', 'zone', '30', 'days', 'may', 'seem', 'gimmicky', 'actually', 'perfect', 'strategy', 'individual', 'enough', 'exposure', 'effect', 'real', 'change', 'perspectives', 'ever', 'will', 'worked', 'time', 'so', 'far', 'telling', 'society', 'Spurlock', ""n't"", 'content', 'merely', 'shine', 'light', 'drama', 'provoked', 'scenario', 'larger', 'issues', 'findings', 'tenacious', 'precision', 'always', 'commenting', 'larger', 'picture', 'astuteness', 'dealing', 'religious', 'dichotomies', 'sufficiency', 'minimum', 'wage', 'binge', 'drinking', 'other', 'number', 'issues', 'affect', 'all.30', 'Days', 'show', 'be', 'seen', 'episode', 'progress', 'can', 'make', 'just', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'ideas', 'comments', 'very', 'nature', 'identities', 'human', 'beings', 'flawed', 'capable', 'gradual', 'change', 'important', 'show', 'everyone', 'can', 'benefit', 'viewing']",30 Days - Season 1
