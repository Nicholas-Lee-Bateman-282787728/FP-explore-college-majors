Jim Carrey is brilliant in what I think is his best performance ever, Truman Show notwithstanding.I really don't even care for Carrey that much, but he is outstanding as Count Olaf and Count Olaf's various ""characters.""  One of them, ""Stefano"" is dead-pan hilarious.The kids do a great job, are charming and can actually act - performances without the slightest tinge of shmaltz or precociousness.  A nice supporting job by Meryl Streep as well.  Great sets, costumes, wonderful storytelling and superbly filmed and edited - definitely one of 2004's best - this movie was severely overlooked at Oscar time.Tim Burton did not direct this film - I'd heard he was approached, or declined to so - and I'm glad.

886503,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007PICAI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 5]","What a very strong and concrete film that director Brad Silberling has created.  I went into this film expecting child's fare, but when I exited I could have sworn that I saw something more on the adult menu.  Using tactics from the early Burton era, Silberling has done what others have only attempted when trying to adapt a young adult novel.  While others will spend the time trying to beautify or appeal to a younger audience, Silberling has taken Handler's stories and given them the darkness and pizzazz that they need.  He has obtained a top-notch cast to guide the audience through the story and into his genuine world of fantasy and wonder.  Using amazing visuals, Silberling pulls you into this film from the opening sequence and never let's your mind wander ... well ... at least wander away from the film.I had seen these stories before, but never found the time to read them.  My wife had read the first three and was curious on how they would handle this series.  So, to answer all of our questions, we decided to see the film.  The first impression that she saw that I thought was impressive was that Silberling transformed the film into a beautiful fantasy world.  From her perspective, he took a story that could be taken as a world similar to yours and mine, and transformed it into this mythological place where our world does exist, but with fantasy elements.  The use of Carrey as Olaf only helped create more of this mythological fantasy world.  His over-the-top eccentric nature only took us to a new level of excitement and wonder.  Coupled with the darkness of the cinematography and use of so many different stylish approaches, you have a young adult book easily adapted into a very sinister and dark film.  That is what struck me so much about this project, the darkness of the set, characters, and tone.  There was no light at the end of this dark tunnel, and Silberling makes sure to constantly remind us of that fact.  Each time we think that the orphans are going to a better place, there is this dark turn of events that reaches deep into the depths of the world and never lets go.  Silberling holds nothing back, and with that in mind perhaps this isn't the children's film that everyone was hoping it would be.  This reminds me of the film The Nightmare Before Christmas which Burton helped create, but really didn't appeal to children because of the darkness surrounding such a ""happy"" subject.  When we saw this film, children were not laughing, but instead seemed uncomfortable and lost, which only made Jen and I enjoy the film more.Another element that I thoroughly enjoyed was the element of curiosity that Silberling added to the film.  We are constantly reminded of the possibility that the children's parents were not who they seemed, and that Olaf was perhaps a part of a darker organization than just being ""Uncle"".  The golden spyglass was perfectly used to allow our minds to continually wander throughout the entire film wondering if the truth would ever be fully uncovered.  They eye was another great tactic that kept your imagination flowing.  That is something films do not allow to happen much anymore, to make the audience use their imagination.  Normally, it is all handed to you and your mind can rest ... that is not the case with this film.  You are always wondering, picturing a new world inside this one and constantly wishing there was more (in a good way!).  This was one of those films that I never wanted to end.  Like a classic X-Files moment, I wanted all my questions answered and they were not.  Silberling has sold me on the next installment when it happens just because I want to see his world, I want to see his people, and I cannot wait to see his darkness.Finally, I would like to say that this is better than any of the Harry Potter films could be.  The darkness was vibrant and imaginative, the actors played their parts with perfection, and the story plucked at that string that made you salivate for more.  Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events reminded me of another film that I recently watched called Unbreakable.  In Snicket, I felt as if I was watching the first chapter of a very explosive book.  I was watching the first chapter of superheroes, before they realized what they were capable of.  Silberling created a whole other world outside of what we were watching that I wanted to know more about, but was only shown snippets of that world.  There is always a first chapter to superheroes, and like Unbreakable, we witnessed the birth in this film.Overall, I walked out of the theater with my jaw on the floor.  This was so impressive and so beautiful that Silberling and everyone involved should be patted on the back.  If I had children and they were interested in seeing this film or one of the Harry Potter films, I know which line we will be in.  The eerie darkness surrounding this film made me think of early Burton and the shadowy films he used to release.  I highly suggest this film to everyone.  It is mind-blowing to say the least.  It is a fantasy film with coupled highlights of society and culture.  Both my wife and I walked away from this film very impressed.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,We are very concerned.,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,5198,"['What', 'very', 'strong', 'concrete', 'film',

886504,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0007PICAI,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[4, 6]","Lemony Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" are cult bestsellers among children. They don't have the wide appeal of the Harry Potter series, nor the controversy of His Dark Materials. There is a mixture of the morbid,the comical, and fantastical. In the movie version, however, what charm there was in the books is lost.Jim Carrey stars as the hammy Count Olaf, the villain of the piece. Carrey's performance is forgettable in its campiness. He twists his face a lot, but there's no depth. Meryl Streep stars as the paranoid Aunt Josephine, again a forgettable performance. The child actors who star as the trio of Baudelaire orphans-Klaus, Violet, and Sunny- succeed despite the leaden script. They are believeable and sympathetic.The special effects are spectacular, such as Aunt Josephine's cliffside house, or the house of snakes. There's a steampunk sensibility blending the technology of today (Count Olaf has keyless remote control for his car),aspects of the '30s (Count Olaf reads about Lon Chaney in a movie magazine) and a Victorian style. One half-expects to see the Baudelaire orphans stopping by Lyra's Oxford or the Magisterium's zeppelins soaring overhead to Bolvangar. This movie preceded ""Golden Compass"",having its look, but lacking its depth and interest.The movie IS all about a series of unfortunate events (complete with Jude Law's handsome silhouette&narration;) It's merely a series of vignettes.

886506,A2PCT57MWSAGX2,B0007PICAI,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","There is always a good and bad thing about a movie, and I can tell you that this movie contains both of these.After finishing the books for quite sometime, I noticed that there is going to be a movie about it...how great!!! I kept thinking how they'll make the movie, since one book for a movie will take them forever to finish up the thirteen books into movies. Then soon I discovered that they are doing three books at a time, at least for this movie. Then I start thinking how they are going to do it, since it is really hard for the whole plot to join into one big thing; this is the reason that kept me waiting for the movie to come out.It finally came, and that's how they put all the events together! ::SPOILER ALERT:: The beginning of the movie starts out quite the same as the book, where the Baudelaire childeren's (Emily Browning, Liam Aiken, and Shelby/Kara Hoffman), Violet, Klaus, and Sunny; were told that their parents were perished in a terrible fire. So after some scenes looking back at the destroyed house, they were send to Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), their new guardian. Then it all went the same way, and then Olaf decided to kill the children's, which never really happened in the book, in order to get his filthy hands on their fortunes. Then after that, Mr. Poe, the care taker of the Baudelaires affair send them to Uncle Monty, not because he believed the children's that Olaf is trying to kill them, but because of he thought that Olaf let them drive, which is ridiculus, in my opinion, but anyway, they spend a little time at Uncle Monty's, and have a really great time, until some tragic happened, where they are send to Aunt Josaphine, a woman who is scared of everything. Then after spending a little time there, the movie moves on into the ending of the first book. Overall, the movie can be called, organize.Like I said before, there is always a good part in a movie, and one good thing about this movie is that how they really organize the events so that it all fit togeher, since it is really hard for a movie to have three different plots. Another is that the actors in this movie is pretty good. The young leading actors are not as bad as Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter did on his first movie, where he don't know how to react to things...so in this case, this movie contains good young actors, but in my opinion, they can do better.I think there are a lot of mistakes/bad things in this movie. One thing that is not good about this movie is that the movie seems to be rushing the scenes. The Baudelaires just spend like, ten minutes with Count Olaf, and that's not enough time to express his evilness, which is another bad thing; the one thing that shows that Count Olaf is evil is slapping Klaus on the face and making them do hundreds of chores, but Count Olaf is a murderer, but the movie didn't tend to point that out. Also, Olaf's crew doesn't have their chance to express their evilness, they just stare at the Baudelaries and then make mean faces. Plus, when the Baudelaries are with different guardians, they only have a little time with them, and the audience just doesn't have time to get to know about the characters, well, except for Aunt Josaphine, who is clearly demonstrate that she is scared of anything, because she said so. And by saying that, I think that the characters should have act out their personality instead of saying, ""Count Olaf is evil."" yeah, we can tell that he is evil, but I think it is just not enough. Another thing is that since the scenes are movie so fast, that there are no excitement on knowing what's going to happen next, there is not mysteriousness that the books keeps you reading on.If you ask me if this movie is worth watching, I would say yes. Even though it is not a very good movie, it is good. I think people who read the books should go and see this movie and kind of, support Lemony Snicket. Though I think that this movie is not a good entertainment though...I am still thinking if I am going to buy the DVD when it comes out. So really, it is up to your decision, and I suggest you to...just to check out what's it all about.Also, opinion to the actors (the leading ones)...Emily Browning will not going to be as famous as Emma Watson, but she is going to be in movies I am certain of that. Liam Aiken will certainly not be as famous as Daniel Radcliffe, but I am sure that there are going to be girls around screaming his name, but I would rather scream his name than Daniel, cuz, Daniel is just...eeek.

886510,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0007PICAI,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 3]","If you are looking for a review of a movie about happy events and sunshine, then I am afraid that you must look elsewhere, for this review contains evil counts, snakes, comparisons, and unlucky orphans.  The movie, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans, Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman), whose parents died in a mysterious fire.  The executor of their parents' will, Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall), tries to find a new guardian for them, and, unfortunately for the Baudelaire children, it turns out to be the scheming and evil Count Olaf (Jim Carey), who plans to take the enormous fortune left behind by Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire.  Other guardians include the loving Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and the perpetually-terrified Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep).  Uncle Monty is a scientist who specializes in snakes (which is unfortunate for me) while Aunt Josephine lives in a large house above a lake infested by extremely dangerous leeches.  Anyway, no matter where the orphans go, Count Olaf is always right behind them, showing up in disguise at inopportune moments (although it's hard for Olaf to show up at a moment that is opportune).While a lot of people who have read the books have found certain flaws with this movie, I personally really enjoyed it.  One of the biggest complaints is that Jim Carrey hammed up the role of the sinister Count Olaf too much, but I rather enjoyed his performance.  Olaf in the books was so despicable he was stand-offish, even to the reader.  While he isn't likable in the movie, he is definitely more watchable.  And yes, some things were dropped from the books, but that is inevitable when adapting a book into a film.  One other thing that people didn't like was the addition of plot points from later books into this movie (the spyglass, the V.F.D. initials, and the cause of the fire); I personally see it as a bit of a strenght, because if future movies are not made, it does provide some closure, although the door for a sequel is definitely open.  Another strength is Streep in the role of Aunt Josephine.  In ""The Wide Window"", I detested her character, but Meryl Streep was able to provide much needed humor to her character, which made her scenes so much more enjoyable.  That's not to say that the other actors weren't good, as everyone, even Browning and Aiken, were wonderful in their roles, but out of all of the characters, Aunt Josephine was the one most in need of a good actor.Going back to what I said about the child actors, I must say that I was very impressed with the performances of Emily Browning and Liam Aiken.  They were able to hold their own with such actors as Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, and Catherine O'Hara (who played the kind but naive Justice Strauss).The final complaint most people had was that the ending of the movie was really the ending of the first book, but it made a good climax, and while I liked it where it was in the book series, I guess it was where it had to be for the movie.Overall, I really enjoyed this film, which is targeted at kids about half my age (I'm 18 as of this writing).  Although, I don't think this film is appropriate for children under the age of 8 (just a warning).  But the story is pretty good and comically dark, the actors are great, and it looks like they had a great time shooting it, and the backgrounds resemble the surreal beauties of a Tim Burton film.  So enjoy this film, if you are up to it.

I haven't read the Lemony Snickett books so I don't know how faithful the film is to the original material. On it's own, the film was great. Creative, fun, even dark and for a kid's movie that's pretty daring. I mean were talking about these people literally being murdered by this sadistic creep, Count Olaf. Don't fret parents. The ""hits"" are tastefully done so that the youngin's understand the seriousness of the subject without being traumatized. I appreciated that.I also kept feeling like I was watching a Tim Burton film. His style seemed to be all over this thing. Even though I couldn't find him in the credits I was sure he had some hand in it. It was nice to see a cool, offbeat movie in the vein of Edward Scissorhands or Beetlejuice. And I loved the kids. They were great and were not annoying in any way. Loved the supporting cast. I loved seeing Meryl Streep go bonkers. And Jennifer Coolidge and Catherine O'Hara from ""A Mighty Wind""; i wish I got to see more of them.And Jim Carrey. I thought he did...well. Honestly, I find him annoying and I agree with the other reviewers who find his acting ""style"" repetitive. Again, I don't know how the Count Olaf in the book is portrayed but I know that Jim did bring some sinister and devious qualities out in the Count.

886514,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0007PICAI,Benjamin,"[2, 3]","LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, based upon the first three books of the popular series, captures much of the charm and humor of the books, complete with the warnings about how sad and dismal the story is going to be and the explanations of what Sunny's gurgles mean.The story, an amalgam of plots from the books, is episodic yet strong. The acting done by the children is really engaging, and stars Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep both deliver strong, amusing performances. And the movie manages to be appropriately dark yet constantly fun.But if you're not really into the story driving the Baudelaire children, you are certain to be won over by the intensely lavish production designs in this film. It is, quite simply, beautiful to look at. The set design is great. The costumes are wonderful. The computer animation is seamless with the rest of the film. And the film is able to work in all its pieces in a way that makes good, narrative sense.It's absolutely beautiful.Plus, the score is tons of fun. It's dark yet well-tempoed and not forgettable.Hopefully, this won't be the last of the UNFORTUNATE movies, for the film had some weak spots. But, mostly, the story was conveyed well enough that I'm interested in learning more.Oh, and though I don't usually do this, I will admit that this film has the best credits that I've seen all year.

On the other there are various relatives of the Baudelaire children (Meryl Streep, Billy Connolley, etc.), all of whom seem unequipped to deal with the real world and its treacheries.Ironically, dear readers, the Baudelaire children themselves are completely capable of spotting the evil in the world and in finding their way around it. Every time Olaf (Jim Carrey)pops up it takes the kids about 2 seconds to see what he's up to, and after some Unfortunate Events, to get the best of him.The whole thing seems to take place in some Edward-Gorey-Tim-Burtony-gothic alternative universe (the film is really fun to LOOK at, the costumes and sets are great).  Yes, Jim Carrey is over-the-top, but in this part it sort of *works*:  it seems right, somehow, that the kids (and the audience) can see in a split second it's the same old Count Olaf and the same old Jim Carrey, but the adults in the film cannot.This is, readers, as it should be, and your kids will enjoy watching it with you (they do love the feeling they might be smarter than you, after all).

One day at the beach Mr. Poe informs them of the unfortunate event of their house and parents burning down. They are then shuffled around to various unrelated relatives. At every turn they are perused by their uncle Count Olaf, who covets their inheritance. Trying to explain this to grownups is almost impossible.Grate narration of the movie by Jude Law; he added a dimension that made you want to see what was happening next.The books offer such great (terrible) resources for the movie. However it was a bit much trying to cram three books into one movie. Each book has more than enough story line for a movie. The events were taken out of order which actually watered down the pathos and everyone could tell this even if they did not read the books. The details are there but we miss the purpose and the lessons.They chose just the right actors to play the Baudelaire brats, Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny (Emily Browning, Liam Aiken, Kara and Shelby Hoffman.) They did a great job of depicting the book characters. The addition of the underscore for Sunny was a notice touch.The only real negative part of the movie was using Jim Carry in the place of Count Olaf. He was too exaggerated even for Jim Carry and distracted from the spookiness of the story. What should have been a spooky but see though person turned out to be too clownish.They picked an excellent Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) born and brought up in Glasgow, Scotland, looks and sounds like a cross between John Cleese and Sean Connery.During the ending credits there ware some great drawings that make you think that this would have made a great cartoon series.Once Bitten",2,Great narration - over the top acting,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,1725,"['Baudelaire', 'children', 'lead', 'cushy', 'life', 'reading', 'books', 'inventing', 'biting', 'One', 'day', 'beach', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'unfortunate', 'event', 'house', 'parents', 'burning', 'down', 'are', 'then', 'shuffled', 'various', 'unrelated', 'relatives', 'turn', 'are', 'perused', 'uncle', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'covets', 'inheritance', 'Trying', 'explain', 'grownups', 'almost', 'impossible.Grate', 'narration', 'movie', 'Jude', 'Law', 'added', 'dimension', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'next.The', 'books', 'offer', 'such', 'great', 'terrible', 'resources', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'trying', 'cram', 'three', 'books', 'one', 'movie', 'book', 'more', 'enough', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'events', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'order', 'actually', 'watered', 'pathos', 'everyone', 'could', 'tell', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'details', 'are', 'there', 'miss', 'purpose', 'lessons.They', 'chose', 'just', 'right', 'actors', 'play', 'Baudelaire', 'brats', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'baby', 'Sunny', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Kara', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'depicting', 'book', 'characters', 'addition', 'underscore', 'Sunny', 'was', 'notice', 'touch.The', 'only', 'real', 'negative', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'using', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'place', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'was', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'even', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'distracted', 'spookiness', 'story', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spooky', 'see', 'person', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'too', 'clownish.They', 'picked', 'excellent', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'born', 'brought', 'up', 'Glasgow', 'Scotland', 'cross', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Sean', 'Connery.During', 'ending', 'credits', 'ware', 'great', 'drawings', 'make', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'cartoon', 'series.Once', 'Bitten']",N/A

Although, I really do like Jim Carrey and enjoyed his performance in the film as Count Olaf, he probably made him too likeable!! That is when compared to Count Olaf in the very first book in the series, The Bad Beginning. Count Olaf was really a very nasty piece of work in that book!! Jim Carrey make him much more comical than his literary counterpart. The character in the film even comes across as more of a jokester than a villain. Billy Connolly is terrific as Uncle Monty, but unfortunately, he disappears all too soon, just as the character does in the second book in the series, The Reptile Room. But, oddly enough, the character in the book seemed to spend more time with the orphans than in the film.  Meryl Streep is also very good as neurotic Aunt Josephine. The film is a feast for the eyes and the world of Lemony Snicket has an almost surreal look and feel to it. As others have mentioned, it looks very much like the sort of film that director Tim Burton would make. The children are all very good, with special mention going to the young Australian beauty, Emily Browning as Violet. She will probably go on to even bigger roles and stardom. I can't wait for the DVD release and all of the extras on it. It is most definitely worth seeing on the big screen if possible first, though. My only complaint is that the mysterious fire that killed the parents is not adequately explained in the film, but merely hinted at. I haven't read far enough in the book series to have been given any further insight into this. Others who haven't read any of the books will probably also find this still something of a mystery after the film is over. The film merely hints or vaguely suggests some connection between the fire, an eye and a magnifying glass.",5,"Count Olaf is not as bad as in the books, but a fine film",1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,1858,"['am', 'now', 'reading', 'second', 'book', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'series', 'having', 'just', 'read', 'first', 'really', 'do', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'film', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'probably', 'made', 'too', 'likeable', 'when', 'compared', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'very', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'Bad', 'Beginning', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'was', 'really', 'very', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'book', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'comical', 'literary', 'counterpart', 'character', 'film', 'even', 'across', 'more', 'jokester', 'villain', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'terrific', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'soon', 'just', 'character', 'second', 'book', 'series', 'Reptile', 'Room', 'oddly', 'enough', 'character', 'book', 'seemed', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'orphans', 'film', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'neurotic', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'film', 'feast', 'eyes', 'world', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'almost', 'surreal', 'look', 'feel', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'very', 'much', 'sort', 'film', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'would', 'make', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'special', 'mention', 'going', 'young', 'Australian', 'beauty', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Violet', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'even', 'bigger', 'roles', 'stardom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'extras', 'most', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'possible', 'first', 'though', 'only', 'complaint', 'mysterious', 'fire', 'killed', 'parents', 'not', 'adequately', 'explained', 'film', 'merely', 'hinted', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'far', 'enough', 'book', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'further', 'insight', 'Others', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'find', 'still', 'something', 'mystery', 'film', 'film', 'merely', 'vaguely', 'connection', 'fire', 'eye', 'magnifying', 'glass']",N/A

She was the best part of the film besides Jim, I would say.  I found the movie to be quite interesting during the first half, but then I began to drift off somewhere during the middle.

So, I did and that's when the first unfortunate event happened. NICKELODEON MOVIES made this! All Nick does is put out crap on their television channel like Fairly OddParents and Hey Arnold. I don't know if it was their fault that the movie was so bad, but it very well could be.So, here's the plot for the movie. There are 3 kids who have very rich parents. There's Violet, (Emily Browning) who loves to invent things, Klaus (Liam Aiken) who loves to read and of course Sunny (Kara Hoffman/Shelby Hoffman) who does nothing but bite and blab in her own language. (she's too young to have proper English) Then their giant mansion burns down in a mysterious fire, killing their parents and destroying everything they ever had. So, a banker named Mr. Poe takes them to the first orphan home place.Their first home is owned by Count Olaf.(Jim Carrey) Now, I like Jim Carrey and all, BUT he wasn't fit to play Count Olaf. Although he's funny and he does well in the humor, there's a bad thing with Jim Carrey in this movie. His humor covers up the fact that he's evil. More people are gonna think Count Olaf is a comedian and not an evil guy that wants to get the huge fortune carried by the 3 orphans, now that their parents are dead. It just doesn't work.Another problem with the movie is that it's seems rushed. The 2 houses after Count Olaf's only seem to be about 10 minutes. Just when you get to like one of the kids' guardians, they get killed. I just don't know where the 108 minutes the movie is all went. The movie just seemed really rushed.But, this movie isn't ALL bad. I guess Jim Carrey was funny and so were the subtitles that told what baby Sunny was saying. I liked the short part that was based on the 3rd book and I thought the special effects were good in that part. Their 3rd guardian, Aunt Josephine, who was played by Meryl Streep, did a great job.The layout for the movie was strange, though. They did the first part of Book 1, then Book 2, then Book 3, then the rest of Book 1. Only about 50% of the movie was something that actually happened in the book, also.SPOILER ALERT: If you don't want to know the ending of this movie, do not read on.But, the biggest problem with the movie was the ending. After the last part of Book 1 was over, Mr. Poe picks up the orphans and drives away to the next guardian. On their way, Mr. Poe stops at the burned-down mansion that was once resided by the kids. Inside the house, there is a letter that came in the mail. It was by the kids' parents. The letter says everything will be fine, although you've lost the house. Now, how the heck did the parents know the house was going to burn down in the first place and why has the letter been circling around the world? It certainly raises a lot of questions. Then, they just put the letter down, go to the car and it just shows the car driving off to the next house. Then it says the end. Oh, great. What happens next?Overall, A Series of Unfortunate Events is an okay movie, saved by most of the actors and, of course, Sonny's subtitles.

The movie plot is very much the same as the story of the first three books.#1 - The Bad Beginning#2 - The Reptile Room#3 - The Wide WindowIn the Series of Unfortunate Events isn't a happily ever after kind of story. There are three regular children:Violet, who loves to inventKlaus, who loves to readand Sunny who loves to biteViolet is the oldest, Claus the middle child, Sunny is the youngest.The book ""The Bad Beginning"" is the basis for the first part of the movie. The story begins when the Baudelaire children are informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, and thus begins a series of search for a suitable guardian and a safe place to live. The siblings closest member to their parents is supposedly Count Olaf, only he's not nice. He's exactly the opposite and he plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents.In The Bad Beginning, things, well, begin badly for the three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in The Reptile Room. As the siblings move in with their new guardian Professor Montgomery, they find he is a reptile scientist. In a room with many different reptiles, there's a newly discovered reptile that he called a deadly, dangerous snake. But it's not really dangerous at all. Later Montes get a new assistant and it is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course something terrible happens to Uncle Morty after that and Count Olaf again tries to kidnap the children.In the Wide Window, Mr. Poe places the children with a distant relative, Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephiine lives in a house on the edge of a hill, a house that is very literally above Lake Lachrymose, a lake infested with Lachrymose Leeches who would eat a human if they smelled food on them.Aunt Josephine is as eccentric as other relatives have been. She's a total grammar freak and so scared of every thing that the children have to live in a cold house and eat cold food because their aunt is afraid of accidents with fire. When Aunt Josephine meets Captain Sham who (who is Count Olaf in disguise), good fortune turns bad. Aunt Josephine dies and the apparent cause of death is jumping through the wide window in the living room, leaving the three children to Captain Sham (who is Count Olaf in disguise).As the orphans try to figure out a way to escape from Count Olaf, they discover their aunt is still alive and in hiding. So they  set out to find her and convince her to come back. This eventually leads them out onto the dreadful Lake Lachrymose where Count Olaf and the dreaded leaches catch up with them.While the books leave much to the imagination, the visual effects and stunning backdrdops of the movie are well detailed, in contrast to the often sparse details in the books.",5,Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,2902,"['Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'first', '3', 'books', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'printed', 'books', 'movie', 'plot', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'story', 'first', 'three', 'books.', '1', 'Bad', 'Beginning', '2', 'Reptile', 'Room', '3', 'Wide', 'WindowIn', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', ""n't"", 'happily', 'ever', 'kind', 'story', 'are', 'three', 'regular', 'children', 'Violet', 'who', 'inventKlaus', 'who', 'readand', 'Sunny', 'who', 'biteViolet', 'oldest', 'Claus', 'middle', 'child', 'Sunny', 'youngest.The', 'book', 'Bad', 'Beginning', 'basis', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'story', 'when', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'are', 'informed', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'banking', 'accountant', 'parents', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'fire', 'thus', 'series', 'search', 'suitable', 'guardian', 'safe', 'place', 'live', 'siblings', 'closest', 'member', 'parents', 'supposedly', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'only', 'not', 'nice', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'steal', 'immense', 'fortune', 'left', 'Baudelaire', 'parents.In', 'Bad', 'Beginning', 'things', 'well', 'begin', 'badly', 'three', 'Baudelaire', 'orphans', 'sadly', 'events', 'only', 'worsen', 'Reptile', 'Room', 'siblings', 'move', 'new', 'guardian', 'Professor', 'Montgomery', 'find', 'reptile', 'scientist', 'room', 'many', 'different', 'reptiles', 'newly', 'discovered', 'reptile', 'called', 'deadly', 'dangerous', 'snake', 'not', 'really', 'dangerous', 'Later', 'Montes', 'get', 'new', 'assistant', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'disguise', 'course', 'something', 'terrible', 'Uncle', 'Morty', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'again', 'kidnap', 'children.In', 'Wide', 'Window', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'children', 'distant', 'relative', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'Aunt', 'Josephiine', 'house', 'edge', 'hill', 'house', 'very', 'literally', 'Lake', 'Lachrymose', 'lake', 'infested', 'Lachrymose', 'Leeches', 'who', 'would', 'eat', 'human', 'smelled', 'food', 'them.Aunt', 'Josephine', 'as', 'eccentric', 'other', 'relatives', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'grammar', 'freak', 'so', 'scared', 'thing', 'children', 'have', 'live', 'cold', 'house', 'eat', 'cold', 'food', 'aunt', 'afraid', 'accidents', 'fire', 'When', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'Captain', 'Sham', 'who', 'who', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'disguise', 'good', 'fortune', 'bad', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'dies', 'apparent', 'cause', 'death', 'jumping', 'wide', 'window', 'living', 'room', 'leaving', 'three', 'children', 'Captain', 'Sham', 'who', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'disguise', 'orphans', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'escape', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'discover', 'aunt', 'still', 'alive', 'hiding', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'convince', 'come', 'back', 'eventually', 'out', 'dreadful', 'Lake', 'Lachrymose', 'where', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'dreaded', 'leaches', 'catch', 'up', 'books', 'leave', 'much', 'imagination', 'visual', 'effects', 'stunning', 'backdrdops', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'detailed', 'contrast', 'often', 'sparse', 'details', 'books']",N/A

A wonderful heartwarming story about how children learn to deal with things they have no control over. This is one of the best family movies ever. I would be surprised if the whole family didn't enjoy it.The children are intelligent and extremely resourceful. Their relatives are unique. As they stay with two different Uncles and an Aunt you learn their indiosyncracies. Two are benevolent and one is quite evil. You will find yourself both amused and terrified.

886539,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B0007PICAI,Chris,"[0, 2]","It seems like every year Hollywood comes out with a movie based on children's stories that I have never heard of.  I believe that part of the reason is that I do not read very many books and also the fact that I am in my twenties.  I have never heard of ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Polar Express"" and I've heard of, but never read, any of the ""Harry Potter"" books.  The same goes for ""Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events.""  But when I ask my brother about the story, he seems to know every plot detail of the book.""Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" is a story about the Baudelaire siblings: Violet, Klaus and Sunny, whose parents die in a house fire and the children become orphaned.  So they are forced to live with their closest relative.  And by closest, they mean the relative that lives closest to the children, not the relative they have the best relationship to.  It turns out that their closest relative is Count Olaf (played masterfully by Jim Carrey).  Count Olaf is a greedy, self loathing person, who wants to get custody of the Baudelaire kids in order to receive their parent's fortune.  The person that give Count Olaf original custody of the kids, takes custody away after Olaf tries to kill the kids by locking them in a car on railroad tracks.  As the children go to new guardians, Count Olaf keeps showing up and trying to steal the children.As mentioned earlier, Jim Carrey gives a really good performance.  A little too goofy at some points, but not too bothersome to take away from the character.  The two kids that talk do a fine job, along with Meryl Streep, who plays their paranoid Aunt Josephine.  Another great performance comes from Jude Law.  He doesn't actually appear in the movie, but he plays the voice of the movie, Lemony Snicket.  His haunting voice sets a perfect tone for the movie.Overall this movie was good enough.  It was not anything particuarly special but it was entertaining, due mainly to the performance of Jim Carrey.  Director Brad Silberling creates a beautiful movie that had a really big Tim Burton feel to it.

Then you're in luck because that's what's happened with this adaptation.  I'm stunned at how many people are giving five-stars to this film, which is monotonous and dull.Viewers also get ample opportunity to watch Jim Carrey do his thing as Count Olaf, a dusty, villainous fop who gains custody of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire following the mysterious death of their parents, and who repeatedly attempts to relieve his young charges of their inheritance.Olaf looks and acts a little like the love child of Ichabod Crane and Beetlejuice. Again and again, the camera pushes right in on his bushy muttonchops, his prosthetic tomahawk nose, his eyelash-length eyebrows and his chattering, mossy teeth as he says and does truly wicked things.Watching, I couldn't help wonder: Will the kids this movie is aimed at find Olaf funny?Will they be amused when he dons disguises to play other, equally unpleasant characters?And, seriously, has any movie, aside from ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Fletch"" actually benefited from the spectacle of one actor playing multiple roles?  Sure, Carrey must play these roles because they're all the same character... but one actor in various funny costumes is almost always a harbinger of showboating.Though his character elbows the kids out of the way, Carrey at least adds energy to a movie that always seems on the verge of blasting off yet never quite does, even as the young heroes bounce from one close call to the next.The film's other energy source is production designer Rick Heinrichs, who usually collaborates with Tim Burton; here, he almost out-Burtons Burton with the film's sinister seascapes, crumbling houses and exotic reptile rooms.Despite the great scenery, director Brad Silberling can't quite replicate the tone of the books. Handler's stories are funny despite their dark undertones, but they're not cute. Silberling mixes things around: The movie is cute despite its darkness, but it's rarely funny.  If ever there was a movie Wes Anderson should've made instead of ""Life Aquatic,"" this is it.The only time the movie really latches onto the spirit of the stories is, ironically, during the closing credits, an animated sequence that depicts the events in the movie and looks a little like an Edward Gorey cartoon.I overheard another member of the audience say, ""Wow, the whole movie should have been like this,"" and it startled me because I had just been thinking the same thing.",2,"Snicket's shadows are traded in for a ""Harry Potter"" glow.",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2638,"['Want', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'took', 'dark', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'best', 'selling', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'books', 'replaced', 'series', 'gloomy', 'edge', 'coppery', 'glow', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Then', ""'re"", 'luck', 'what', 'happened', 'adaptation', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'five-stars', 'film', 'monotonous', 'dull.Viewers', 'also', 'get', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'do', 'thing', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'dusty', 'villainous', 'fop', 'who', 'gains', 'custody', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'Sunny', 'Baudelaire', 'following', 'mysterious', 'death', 'parents', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'relieve', 'young', 'charges', 'inheritance.Olaf', 'looks', 'little', 'love', 'child', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'Beetlejuice', 'Again', 'again', 'camera', 'right', 'bushy', 'muttonchops', 'prosthetic', 'tomahawk', 'nose', 'eyelash-length', 'eyebrows', 'chattering', 'mossy', 'teeth', 'truly', 'wicked', 'things.Watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Will', 'kids', 'movie', 'aimed', 'find', 'Olaf', 'funny', 'Will', 'be', 'amused', 'when', 'disguises', 'play', 'other', 'equally', 'unpleasant', 'characters', 'seriously', 'movie', 'aside', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'Fletch', 'actually', 'benefited', 'spectacle', 'one', 'actor', 'playing', 'multiple', 'roles', 'Sure', 'Carrey', 'must', 'play', 'roles', ""'re"", 'same', 'character', 'one', 'actor', 'various', 'funny', 'costumes', 'almost', 'always', 'harbinger', 'showboating.Though', 'character', 'kids', 'way', 'Carrey', 'least', 'energy', 'movie', 'always', 'verge', 'blasting', 'off', 'yet', 'never', 'quite', 'even', 'young', 'heroes', 'bounce', 'one', 'close', 'call', 'next.The', 'film', 'other', 'energy', 'source', 'production', 'designer', 'Rick', 'Heinrichs', 'who', 'usually', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'here', 'almost', 'out-Burtons', 'Burton', 'film', 'sinister', 'seascapes', 'crumbling', 'houses', 'exotic', 'reptile', 'rooms.Despite', 'great', 'scenery', 'director', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'replicate', 'tone', 'books', 'Handler', 'stories', 'are', 'funny', 'dark', 'undertones', ""'re"", 'not', 'cute', 'Silberling', 'mixes', 'things', 'movie', 'cute', 'darkness', 'rarely', 'funny', 'ever', 'was', 'movie', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'instead', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'it.The', 'only', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'spirit', 'stories', 'ironically', 'closing', 'credits', 'animated', 'sequence', 'events', 'movie', 'little', 'Edward', 'Gorey', 'overheard', 'member', 'audience', 'say', 'Wow', 'whole', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'startled', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing']",N/A

And, while Jim Carrey is in a variety of outrageous characters, which he plays so well, and the cinematography is vivid and engrossing, taking you into a real fantasy world, the actual story is far too aggressive and abhorent to be suitable for children.

Snicket immediately begins devising ways to kill the children. When they are taken away from him, he dons various disguises to get them back. (This is where his other strange characters come into play.) Eventually, he tries to force the 14-year-old girl to marry him... so, in addition to being a psychotic killer, he's a pedophile.

We loved this film from the opening sequence until the very last person was thanked in the end credits. The transfer to DVD was absolutely stunning, true to the theater experience visually and audibly.After all this time, this film stands up beautifully as a film I dearly treasure. A recent rewatching came up becauseCity of Emberhad a few homages to this film. Although Lemony is a much better film, there's still some parallels in that more recent movie.There was a lot of debate over accuracy to the books, and how many books were used. In hind sight, this is just so not important. The books are great for what they are. This film is wonderful for what it is. We've just enjoyed this film as a fantastic wonderful story.The story is about three children that lose their parents in a sad house fire. The orphans are haunted by money grubbing Count Olaf who tries to kill them over and over again. The things that happen to these children is amazing.From my perspective, this film has very few missteps. The soundtrack is simply outstanding, it is almost another character that amplifies critical moments. The film has this fabulous retro-tech other world look, muted colors, dark scenery, and sparse landscapes. Audio is just great, surround sound is used to perfection. The pacing is virtually perfect, timing of each scene is spot on.The actors, oh so much to enjoy. Judd Law is so perfect as the narrator, he has a wonderful voice. The children are just so cool, the little girl is precious. My favorite line from her, ""She is the mayor of crazy town."" I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep at all, and I really like her in this film. Top to bottom, excellent cast. Jim Carrey, maybe a bit over the top, but it's the character. He doesn't necessarily steal this show.The biggest regret of this film, no more will be made. It didn't do nearly well enough in box offic or DVD sales. So nobody will finance another installment. Harry Potter is good, those films are a fantastic series. Lemony Snicket deserves to be up there right beside them in popularity.",5,"4 Years Later, I Still Love This Film",1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2146,"['Almost', '4', 'half', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'film', 'opening', 'day', 'vacation', 'Phoenix', 'loved', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'very', 'last', 'person', 'was', 'thanked', 'end', 'credits', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'true', 'theater', 'experience', 'visually', 'audibly.After', 'time', 'film', 'up', 'beautifully', 'film', 'dearly', 'treasure', 'recent', 'rewatching', 'came', 'up', 'becauseCity', 'Emberhad', 'few', 'homages', 'film', 'Lemony', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'still', 'parallels', 'more', 'recent', 'movie.There', 'was', 'lot', 'debate', 'accuracy', 'books', 'how', 'many', 'books', 'were', 'used', 'hind', 'sight', 'just', 'so', 'not', 'important', 'books', 'are', 'great', 'what', 'are', 'film', 'wonderful', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'story.The', 'story', 'three', 'children', 'lose', 'parents', 'sad', 'house', 'fire', 'orphans', 'are', 'haunted', 'money', 'grubbing', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'kill', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'things', 'happen', 'children', 'perspective', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'missteps', 'soundtrack', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'almost', 'character', 'critical', 'moments', 'film', 'fabulous', 'retro-tech', 'other', 'world', 'look', 'muted', 'colors', 'dark', 'scenery', 'sparse', 'landscapes', 'Audio', 'just', 'great', 'surround', 'sound', 'used', 'perfection', 'pacing', 'virtually', 'perfect', 'timing', 'scene', 'spot', 'on.The', 'actors', 'oh', 'so', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Judd', 'Law', 'so', 'perfect', 'narrator', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'children', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'cool', 'little', 'girl', 'precious', 'favorite', 'line', 'mayor', 'crazy', 'town', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'really', 'film', 'Top', 'bottom', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'maybe', 'bit', 'top', 'character', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'steal', 'show.The', 'biggest', 'regret', 'film', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'well', 'enough', 'box', 'offic', 'DVD', 'sales', 'nobody', 'will', 'finance', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'good', 'films', 'are', 'fantastic', 'series', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'right', 'beside', 'popularity']",N/A
886547,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0007PICAI,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 7]","Dear Amazon viewerIf you are reading this review of the movie adaptation of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events and am expecting a critique that is completely laudable, please click on one of the other tabs and do not read this review.  Suffice to say, I am compelled to comment on the movie adventures of the orphaned Baudelaire children, and how they and this movie fare compared to the original novels by Lemony Snicket.Of course, most people know this is a movie adaptation, which are two words meaning ""a movie that is based on a novel, so that it's probably not going to match the book 100%, and if it matches it by 70%, that's pretty good by American standards.""  (note-my quotes).  But this movie is based on the first three SUE books, The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window.  Remember, it's not too late to read a different Amazon review.  No?  I'll continue then.Having said all that, the story's about the Baudelaire children, Violet, fourteen years old, and a creative inventor, Klaus, the middle child who's a bookworm who retains all the knowledge he learns (ahh, someone I can relate to!), and the infant Sunny, who loves nothing more than to exercise her four sharp teeth on tables, Scrabble tiles, you name it.  Tragedy befalls these children upon the news that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed their beloved home.  It falls upon their family solicitor and executor, Mr. Poe, to take them to the odious Count Olaf, a fourth cousin thrice removed or vice versa.  Count Olaf, who schemes to have the children killed so he can inherit their wealth, and is played by Jim Carrey, lives in a rather tacky castle, and in terms of its grimness, via dirty dishes and dingy d&eacute;cor, it mirrors the book handsomely.  However, Jim Carrey's characterization is more like something wacky and over the top that he has done before, and not the Count Olaf of the books.  The bald head, whisp of hair, single eyebrow, and eye tattoo on the ankle have been preserved, but this movie is just another excuse for silly disguises and more variations of funnily accented voices.  You know, you can always read a review from someone else.  No?  Okay then.What some Lemony Snicket readers may find jarring is the sudden transition from the events in Book One to Book Two.  There is a train scene not in the book that highlights Violet's inventiveness, and the denouement, which is another word for ending, of Book One, is the movie's conclusion.  However, the Reptile Room segment, with the children's herpetologist uncle, Montgomery Montgomery, is splendid for its incredible reptiles, especially the Incredibly Deadly Viper, but the ingenuity Violet shows in the second book has been excised.In terms of atmosphere and setting, the one for The Wide Window is the best, with its gloomy overcast skies, the house of Aunt Josephine, their next guardian, perched precariously over a cliff and Lake Lachrymose.  This adventure is captured the best.I wish I could tell you this movie is perfect, but it isn't.  My heart aches to write that the actors portray the characters to a tee, but alas.  Granted, Timothy Spall, who played Peter Pettigrew in the third Harry Potter, is perfect as Mr. Poe save that he doesn't cough per the book.  Liam Aiken as Klaus is great, but he doesn't wear glasses.  Meryl Streep wasn't the best choice to play the electricity-phobic and grammatically compulsive Aunt Josephine, as I would've chosen Miranda Richardson.  The best cast characters are charming Emily Browning as Violet, Kara and Shelby Hoffman as Sunny, whose nonsensical words are translated into subtitles, and Billy Connolly as the kind Uncle Monty.My overall rating, as Sunny Baudelaire might put it, is, ""Klwatcho,"" which can be roughly translated as ""it didn't follow all parts of the book, but it was sort of fun to watch.""  The movie mainly succeeds due to the sympathy one feels towards the Baudelaires and the performance given by the child actors, who show how in the darkest moments, they can find some source of sanctuary, where they can look after one another.  Thus has ended the critique of a fairly interesting movie adaptation, which I hope will be topped by its successor for me to relate to you.By Orangey Hamlow",4,A series of fairly interpreted events,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,4262,"['Dear', 'Amazon', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'am', 'expecting', 'critique', 'completely', 'laudable', 'please', 'click', 'one', 'other', 'tabs', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'review', 'Suffice', 'say', 'am', 'compelled', 'comment', 'movie', 'adventures', 'orphaned', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'how', 'movie', 'fare', 'compared', 'original', 'novels', 'Lemony', 'Snicket.Of', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'are', 'two', 'words', 'meaning', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'match', 'book', '100', '%', '70', '%', 'pretty', 'good', 'American', 'standards', 'note-my', 'quotes', 'movie', 'based', 'first', 'three', 'SUE', 'books', 'Bad', 'Beginning', 'Reptile', 'Room', 'Wide', 'Window', 'Remember', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'read', 'different', 'Amazon', 'review', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'then.Having', 'said', 'story', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'Violet', 'fourteen', 'years', 'old', 'creative', 'inventor', 'Klaus', 'middle', 'child', 'who', 'bookworm', 'who', 'knowledge', 'ahh', 'someone', 'can', 'relate', 'infant', 'Sunny', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'exercise', 'four', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'tables', 'Scrabble', 'tiles', 'name', 'Tragedy', 'children', 'news', 'parents', 'perished', 'fire', 'destroyed', 'beloved', 'home', 'family', 'solicitor', 'executor', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'take', 'odious', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'fourth', 'cousin', 'thrice', 'removed', 'vice', 'versa', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'have', 'children', 'killed', 'so', 'can', 'inherit', 'wealth', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'rather', 'tacky', 'castle', 'terms', 'grimness', 'dirty', 'dishes', 'dingy', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'book', 'handsomely', 'However', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'characterization', 'more', 'something', 'wacky', 'top', 'done', 'not', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'books', 'bald', 'head', 'whisp', 'hair', 'single', 'eyebrow', 'eye', 'tattoo', 'ankle', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'movie', 'just', 'excuse', 'silly', 'disguises', 'more', 'variations', 'funnily', 'accented', 'voices', 'know', 'can', 'always', 'read', 'review', 'someone', 'else', 'No', 'Okay', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'readers', 'may', 'find', 'jarring', 'sudden', 'transition', 'events', 'Book', 'One', 'Book', 'Two', 'train', 'scene', 'not', 'book', 'Violet', 'inventiveness', 'denouement', 'word', 'ending', 'Book', 'One', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'However', 'Reptile', 'Room', 'segment', 'children', 'herpetologist', 'uncle', 'Montgomery', 'Montgomery', 'splendid', 'incredible', 'reptiles', 'especially', 'Incredibly', 'Deadly', 'Viper', 'ingenuity', 'Violet', 'second', 'book', 'been', 'excised.In', 'terms', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'one', 'Wide', 'Window', 'best', 'gloomy', 'overcast', 'skies', 'house', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'next', 'guardian', 'perched', 'precariously', 'cliff', 'Lake', 'Lachrymose', 'adventure', 'captured', 'best.I', 'wish', 'could', 'tell', 'movie', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'My', 'heart', 'aches', 'write', 'actors', 'portray', 'characters', 'tee', 'alas', 'Granted', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'who', 'played', 'Peter', 'Pettigrew', 'third', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'perfect', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'save', ""n't"", 'cough', 'book', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Klaus', 'great', ""n't"", 'wear', 'glasses', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'play', 'electricity-phobic', 'grammatically', 'compulsive', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'would', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'best', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'charming', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Violet', 'Kara', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'Sunny', 'nonsensical', 'words', 'are', 'translated', 'subtitles', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'kind', 'Uncle', 'Monty.My', 'overall', 'rating', 'Sunny', 'Baudelaire', 'might', 'put', 'Klwatcho', 'can', 'be', 'roughly', 'translated', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'parts', 'book', 'was', 'sort', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'mainly', 'due', 'sympathy', 'one', 'feels', 'Baudelaires', 'performance', 'given', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'show', 'how', 'darkest', 'moments', 'can', 'find', 'source', 'sanctuary', 'where', 'can', 'look', 'one', 'Thus', 'ended', 'critique', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'topped', 'successor', 'relate', 'you.By', 'Orangey', 'Hamlow']",N/A
886548,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007PICAI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","I've been curious about this wildly popular Lemony Snicket business for some time now, and I'm glad I finally got a chance to see the film.  This does stand out as something different, with its dark atmosphere and theatrically villainous antagonist.  It's largely a children's story that plays well to an adult audience.  Actually, I tend to think that there may well be more in this film for adults than there is for children.  The dark comedy of the story plays on a subtle level at times, and each of the Baudelaire children's small victories are more subdued than openly exciting.  In fact, the older children themselves - Klaus and Violet - are in many ways miniature adults.  The premise of the story, with the murder of their parents, the destruction of their home, and the complete upheaval their young lives are thrown into, would tend to suck the remaining childlike qualities out of any young teenagers.  Clearly, though, these were always seriously minded kids: Klaus the voracious reader and Violet the creative inventor.  Thanks to the subtitled translations of young Sonny's pre-articulate vocalizations, we see that she too operates on a level beyond that of mere babyhood much of the time.The series of unfortunate events that the newly-orphaned Baudelaire children suffer here all come at the hands of Count Olaf, their first in a series of really peculiar guardians.  Jim Carrey milks the role for all he's worth, but I can't help thinking that Christopher Lloyd would have been the natural choice for Olaf - certainly, that would have saved a lot of money on makeup.  Still, Carrey's Olaf easily steals every scene he appears in (and he assumes a number of guises).  Olaf wants the Baudelaire fortune, which will belong to the children once they come of age, and his basic plan is to arrange for an unfortunate accident to take the lives of the little heirs-to-be and claim the money for himself.  Once the children manage to convince Mr. Poe, the banker, that Olaf is remarkably unfit as a guardian, he continues insinuating himself into their lives in the pursuit of his greedy endeavors.  As for those other guardians, you have an eccentric herpetologist and an insanely timid aunt (Meryl Streep).  It becomes clear to the children that there is a great mystery here, some close connection between these characters and their parents.  The problem is living long enough to figure out what that mystery is.  Thanks to Violet's knack for invention and Klaus' book knowledge, the kids manage to pull through every dangerous dilemma forced upon them by the insufferable Olaf.Some surprising faces turn up in this film, including Cedric the Entertainer as a detective and Dustin Hoffman as a theatre critic (Jude Law, of course, serves as Lemony Snicket himself, the shadowy narrator of the tale).  It looks like a good time was had by all.  Liam Aiken and Emily Browning are quite engaging as the older Baudelaire children, while the tandem of Kara and Shelby Hoffman bring young Sonny to life in a surprisingly remarkable way.  I can't help but mention the ending credit sequence, as well, for it runs an astonishing twelve minutes, the first five of which are augmented by darkly surreal illustrations of the kids' travails.  Since the movie covers only the first three books in the series, don't look for ultimate resolution of the Baudelaire drama at the very end; there's reason to both anticipate and hope for a sequel.",5,"A darkly surreal, disarmingly serious adventure",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,3443,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'curious', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'business', 'time', 'now', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'something', 'different', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'theatrically', 'villainous', 'antagonist', 'largely', 'children', 'story', 'well', 'adult', 'audience', 'Actually', 'tend', 'think', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'more', 'film', 'adults', 'children', 'dark', 'comedy', 'story', 'subtle', 'level', 'times', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'small', 'victories', 'are', 'more', 'subdued', 'openly', 'exciting', 'fact', 'older', 'children', 'Klaus', 'Violet', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'miniature', 'adults', 'premise', 'story', 'murder', 'parents', 'destruction', 'home', 'complete', 'upheaval', 'young', 'lives', 'are', 'thrown', 'would', 'tend', 'suck', 'remaining', 'childlike', 'qualities', 'young', 'teenagers', 'Clearly', 'though', 'were', 'always', 'seriously', 'minded', 'kids', 'Klaus', 'voracious', 'reader', 'Violet', 'creative', 'inventor', 'Thanks', 'subtitled', 'translations', 'young', 'Sonny', 'pre-articulate', 'vocalizations', 'see', 'too', 'level', 'mere', 'babyhood', 'much', 'time.The', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'newly-orphaned', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'suffer', 'here', 'come', 'hands', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'first', 'series', 'really', 'peculiar', 'guardians', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'worth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'natural', 'choice', 'Olaf', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'money', 'makeup', 'Still', 'Carrey', 'Olaf', 'easily', 'scene', 'number', 'guises', 'Baudelaire', 'fortune', 'will', 'belong', 'children', 'come', 'age', 'basic', 'plan', 'arrange', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'take', 'lives', 'little', 'heirs-to-be', 'claim', 'money', 'children', 'manage', 'convince', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'banker', 'Olaf', 'remarkably', 'unfit', 'guardian', 'insinuating', 'lives', 'pursuit', 'greedy', 'endeavors', 'other', 'guardians', 'have', 'eccentric', 'herpetologist', 'insanely', 'timid', 'aunt', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'clear', 'children', 'great', 'mystery', 'here', 'close', 'connection', 'characters', 'parents', 'problem', 'living', 'long', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'mystery', 'Thanks', 'Violet', 'knack', 'invention', 'Klaus', 'book', 'knowledge', 'kids', 'manage', 'pull', 'dangerous', 'dilemma', 'forced', 'insufferable', 'Olaf.Some', 'surprising', 'turn', 'up', 'film', 'including', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'detective', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'theatre', 'critic', 'Jude', 'Law', 'course', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'shadowy', 'narrator', 'tale', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'had', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'are', 'quite', 'engaging', 'older', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'tandem', 'Kara', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'bring', 'young', 'Sonny', 'life', 'surprisingly', 'remarkable', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mention', 'ending', 'credit', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'astonishing', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'first', 'five', 'are', 'augmented', 'darkly', 'surreal', 'illustrations', 'kids', 'travails', 'movie', 'only', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'ultimate', 'resolution', 'Baudelaire', 'drama', 'very', 'end', 'reason', 'anticipate', 'hope', 'sequel']",N/A

886551,A1AKDW4P8V72R4,B0007PICAI,"David C. Anderson ""fenrisbooks""","[4, 5]","I have to ask myself, why even bother writing a review of this DVD? The best answer I can come up with is, there should be a review by someone who doesn't particularly like Jim Carrey and wouldn't watch this film under normal circumstances.That's where I'm coming from. So you could save the scathing rebukes of ""the film was made for the young and the young-at-heart and not for you"" and ""you just don't get it"". You're right. However, from a purely narrative standpoint, the film is fun, inventive enough, and sure to become one of those films that those born from 1983-1986 will refer to fondly and make their own children sit through at least once. It has all of the good things that these types of movies need - orphans, spiders, snakes, adults who don't listen to kids, etc. and it has that same ""doom and gloom, I'm sadder than you"" 14 year old goth girl that made Beetlejuice such a hit back in the late 80s. Unfortunately, as Beetlejuice had Michael ""cocaine-overdrive"" Keaton, this film has Jim Carrey.Before I start my Jim Carrey tirade, nothing in this film is more annoying than the director insisting (in a documentary included on the DVD) that they didn't really know what they were going to do with the character until Jim Carrey showed up on the set and managed to do his improv magic. Please. If you hire Jim Carrey, don't ever say that you were unaware that he was able yuk it up on the spot. It makes you look like an idiot - and a disingenuous idiot at that. So without further ado - my Jim Carrey essay: You either like Jim Carrey or you don't. If you do, you won't be disappointed with this umpteenth iteration of the mugging, improv-ing, try-hard character that we've seen in almost every film since Ace Ventura. I've given up on disliking the guy, and as I'm already invested in hating Robin Williams as a full time job, that would mean figting the same war on two fronts. And the truth is, this isn't the worst offender as far as its Carrey annoyance factor goes. Additionally, since Carrey spends most of his time in various disguises, he never gets to the point of mugging overkill - as each character is there and gone in a few scenes. The supporting cast certainly helps counterbalance what he attempts to infect - Catherine O'Hara is obliviously wonderful, Meryl Streep does her best work since Silkwood, and Billy Connelly manages to channel John Cleese almost perfectly. In the end, Carrey ends up being second in line to the incredibly irritating baby Baudelaire child, who speaks in goos and gahs that are translated through awkward and embarrassing subtitles.

886558,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B0007PICAI,drebbles,"[1, 2]","This movie is Hollywood's take on Lemony Snicket's series of darkly comic novels about the adventures of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents died in a fire. Based on the first three books in the series, the movie does a lot of things right, starting with Jude Law as Lemony Snicket, in silhouette only, narrating the movie much like Snicket narrates the books. Because it's based on three books, the storylines are condensed, but it works and the film moves right along. Fans of the books will love the inclusion of The Happy Little Elf. Things the movie doesn't do right is not having Klaus wear glasses (maybe the producers thought he would look too much like Harry Potter?) and Mr. Poe does not continually cough. The film uses subtitles to translate Sunny's speech, which is mildly amusing, but doesn't quite capture her speech the way the books do.Parts of this movie can be upsetting for younger children, starting of course, with the death of the Baudelaire parents (not seen on camera). An especially scary scene is when Count Olaf parks his car on a railroad track and locks the car so that the children are trapped in the car as a train is coming. I didn't like the scene when Count Olaf tried to force Violet to marry him in the books and I wish it hadn't been included in the movie. Young viewers might not get the implications, but the whole idea made me uncomfortable.The acting in this movie is quite good. The child actors, Emily Browning as Violet; Liam Aiken as Klaus; and twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman all do well in their roles. Billy Connolly is fine as Uncle Monty and Meryl Streep is great as Aunt Josephine who is afraid of everything (with good reason as it turns out). As for Jim Carrey, yes his acting is way over the top as Count Olaf; but then again Count Olaf's character is way over the top in the books.Fans of the quirky Snicket books should enjoy this darkly humorous movie.

I like Jim Carrey, and I think he's very talented. He proves he can do great comedy, like in ""The Mask"" and ""Bruce Almighty,"" and he proved that he could great do drama, like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" but he is just too big of a star for this movie. He was doing his own thing throughout, and while everybody else was on one level, he was on another, and the two didn't mix very well. I mentioned in my review for ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" that the second half of 2004 has been great visually. ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and now ""Lemony Snicket"" have great things to watch, and I think this movie actually requires a second viewing so you can look around and find all the little visual quirks you might have mixed. Look around the front hall when the children enter the home of Count Olaf. Paintings on the wall, the staircase.

This movie covers three of the books. ""The Bad Beginning,"" ""The Reptile Room,"" and ""The Wide Window."" I've read the books, and the movie covers the basic idea, but not word for word, and we jump the first book to the second to the third and back to the first again. We begin with the voice of Lemony Snicket at his typewriter, writing the story of the three Baudelaire children. There is Violet, who loves to invent, and whenever she is getting ready to invent something, she ties a ribbon to get the hair out of her eyes. There is Klaus, who loves to read, and is able to retain all the information he gets from books. Then there is baby Sunny, who has two teeth, and can bite anything. They always find her hanging from the table. She speaks in baby talk, and we get subtitles to translate what she says. Their parents die in a fire, and the banker Mr. Poe brings the children to live with their closet relative, and it's their parents third cousin four times removed or their fourth cousin three times removed. Whichever order, their relative is Count Olaf, a tall, actor with the tatoo of an eye on his ankle. He makes the children do chores, and cook roast beef dinners for his acting group, but his intentions are to kill the children and collect the fortune that their parents left behind. He tries to kill them, fails, and they get sent to live with their Uncle Monty, who is going to bring them on a trip to Peru, an animal lover with snakes, in cages, all over his house. Eventually they are sent to live with their safety freak Aunt Josephine, who doesn't like to open door with the knobs because she is scared that they will shatter and pieces will go into you eyes, and she doesn't like to cook things on the stove because she's scared that it'll blow up, so she feeds herself and the children cold cucumber soup. No matter where they go, they are always persued by Count Olaf, always in a different disguise, with his acting group not far behind, always with a clever trick up his sleeve to get that money.Besides Jim Carrey, ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" has some all star cast members. People that you see all the time, but don't know their names. There is Catherine O'Hara as Olaf's neighbor. Cedric the Entertainer as a police officer. Olaf's theatre group includes Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Adams, Luis Guzmen, and Craig Ferguson. These names may not mean anything, but if you see the movie, you'll recongize them right away. The music is something else to see. Thomas Newmen is a brilliant composer. He did the music for one of my favorite movies, ""American Beauty."" His music gives such a gloomy feel, but you can't help but smile at it's genius. Stay for closing credits and listen, and you'll fall in love. I have been trying to rack my brain figuring out who would have made a better Count Olaf, but I can't think of any. Carrey also brings to much comedy to the roll, something that takes away much of the seriousness to the character. Olaf is not a nice person. He lies, cheats, steals, and kills to get his way, and you don't use those characteristics when you think about Jim Carrey.Every single adult in this move, except for Count Olaf, is plain stupid. They just don't listen, which is a big problem in life. It's ironic that the children are always right, and the adults roll their eyes. What's so great about the film, is that Count Olaf uses the stupidity of these adults for his own benefit. Everything is connected to everything else. When Olaf is disguised, a person like you and me can see right through him, but not these characters. If they have any suspision that he is an imposter, they think that he is somebody completely different. It's darkly comic, and disturbing to think something like that could really happen. ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is a very good movie, aside from Carrey's unwantedness. He simply was not right for the role. Maybe a John Malkovich type would have fit better. It's enough to bypass that performance, and just let the visuals wash all over you. I would see a sequal, because this movie doesn't tie up all the lose ends, and I'm glad that they are different from the book seris, otherwise, we would all know exactly how it ends, or if it doesn't end. Lemony Snicket was with the voice of Jude Law, as the 2004 Jude Law film festival concludes. This year alone, he's in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" ""I Heart Huckabees,"" ""Alfie,"" ""Closer,"" ""Lemony Snicket,"" and ""The Aviator,"" and he has become one of my favorite actors. His narration is perfect for this film, and his addition if truely wanted. Not one of the best films of the year, but certainly one of the most entertaining.ENJOY!rated PG for thematic elements, scary situations and brief language.",4,A Wonderful Wonderful

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[2, 9]","I guess the first thing that crosses my mind when reviewing this film, is that I can't believe that it's geared for kids.  Based on the books of the same name, I really could not believe what was being presented as entertainment.  Though done in a whimsical fashion, the children of this film are virtually being stalked and endangered for their family's heritance; and the adults surrounding these children are being killed in an attempt to secure their custody.Looking much like a Tim Burton film, the film is dark and sorted; and tracks the accounts of the Baudelaire children.  The three orphans: Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny are thrust into the care of their Uncle Olaf, when a freakish house fire takes the lives of their parents in the beginning of the film. Uncle Olaf, played by Jim Carrey, has other plans for these children.  His intentions include pilfering the Baudelaire family fortune, as well as, eradicating the Baudelaire children.The three children possess various traits and talents which provide a plethora of tactics used to curtail Uncle Olaf's attacks.  These abilities include Violet's wizardry to invent things, Klaus' knowledge of books, and Sunny's ability to bite.  Each of these personas come into play throughout the film, and is very intriguing as the children continue to thwart Uncle Olaf's always obtrusive advances.Again, the film in itself is amusing at times; however, not what I would perceive as ""family value"" entertainment, unless of course you are a member of the Mansion family.  Remember being fore warned is to be fore told.  Watch with caution.

886569,AA50ZQDY2TPK5,B0007PICAI,game-dude,"[3, 4]","THE MOVIE IN GENERALI'm a huge fan of the books, and I expected a lot out of the movie.  As a matter of fact, I just bought the Reptile Room from this very web site not even 5 minutes ago.  I like this movie better in some ways, but not in most.THE TIME SPANThis movie isn't short, but it feels very short.  The time span representing the 1st book is very small.  They recieve the news of their parents death, go to Count Olaf's, meet his friends, almost get run over by a train, then escape him for a bit.  The book contains events to numerous to list.  But, I can tell you that the movie covers only about an eighth of those events.  Well, since the movie feels so short and it's only covering three books, add as much as you can, and try to parallel it to the book as best as you can.  The time representing the 2nd book follows the same example as before.  It's longer and leads into the mystery much more and interests me more, but it still needs to be longer and better.  The time representing the 3rd book is the best. This section of the movie is the most time you spend thinking about the mystery, so it tweaks your interest the most.  Aunt Josephine seems to know and reveal a lot about the secret scociety she, Uncle Monty, Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire were working against Count Olaf.  But it still could have been a little better too.  Work more into the storm and the Baudelaire Orphans giving themselves hives and swollen tongues by eating peppermint on pourpose to give themselves a little more time.  So the time span was short for each book and the play at the end is actually supposed to happen at the end of the Bad Beginning, so we could've worked things a little better with that too.THE MYSTERYI like the addition of the mystery in this movie.  Of course the book expands it and makes it much better, but they did a pretty good job here too.  I loke the way it unfolded and kept you guessing all through till the end, if you haven't read all the books that is.  Having only read the first 5 books, I don't know what really happens, but they did excellent at the mystery.THE ENDINGDon't get me wrong, I'd love it if they had fixed up the problems above, but I could've brushed it off as nothing if only the ending had been changed.  The only REAL problem with the ending is Count Olaf's escaping from prison at the end.  He should've never escaped jail, in fact if I'd had my way, I'd say he would have been killed in some way.  I really, really, really, really, really, really wish Count Okaf had at least spent the rest of his life in prison.  Other then that, the ending's extremely touching and I love it.  But if only Count Olaf had at least never escaped, then the movie would've been almost perfect.THE ACTINGCount Olaf: Jim Carrey overdoes Count Olaf's comical side way too much.  I don't imagine Count Olaf acting like that at all.  Add a bit more of a dastardly side to him and you would have had it much better.Violet: Emily Browning is an excellent actress, not to mention a very beautiful one.  While I'm reading the books I imagine Violet looking like Emily Browning.Klaus: I don't remember the name of the actor who does Klaus.  I think the first name is Liam, but I'm not sure.  I think LIam does good,  but they could've given him some fake glasses to make him feel more like Klaus, but he's still alright.Sunny: Sunny's perfect.Mr. Poe: One flaw, no coughing.Uncle Monty: Perfect.Aunt Josephine: PerfectLemony Snicket: I'm not sure if the real Lemony Snicket is acting for himself or if Jude Law is acting and voicing the character of Lemony Snicket in this movie.  But whoever is doing it is good, but it would be nice to see who it is.THE REMAINING THINGSOverall the movie doesn't live up to the book's standards in many ways, but it's still a good movie, and very touching.  Count Olaf's escaping in the end is the only thing that I just can't live with.

At the time I didn't really think about seeing it in the theaters.  I've never read the books, and although the preview looked intriguing, it nevertheless didn't persuade me to buy a ticket to sit the theater for 2 hours.  However, after seeing it on DVD, I would say it's not a bad way to spend a little time with your family or loved ones, because it's a pretty good, and ultimately different kind of family movie.The basic premise of the story is about 3 kids who have just been made orphans by the deaths of their parents in a fire.  They're sent off to the care of their distant uncle Count Olaf (Jim Carrey).  Olaf is really what precipitates the ""series of unfortunate events"", because he's greedy, conniving and malicious.  His whole plan is to stop at nothing to get the inheritance of the children.As I said before this movie is unusual.  It's supposed to be a family movie, and a bit of a comedy, but it's very dark.  It even tells you that in the beginning narration of the film, and some of its elements mock at the traditional Christmas style family movies.  But in the end it is a family movie because it does have a good morality, which is that family is important, and it does make you laugh with some of its characters: Jim Carrey is being his usual over-the-top, impersonating lunatic self.  He plays several different characters in the film and it's a bit of flashback to his ""In Living Color"" days; and the little baby, the youngest of the three children is absolutely adorable, they even ""translate"" her baby talk to give her real lines.  I didn't care for some of the other people as much: The actor who played Mr. Poe, the banker who looks after the children, seems to be more of a nuisance at times than a good addition to the cast; and Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine seemed like she had difficulty getting into her role at times.Other pluses for the film are its beautifully created sets, the costumes and the art direction.

So let's start with some good old syrupy nice cartoon for the grown babies children are, aren't they? But surprise, surprise! That does not last long and there is the disclaimer that announces that beginning is a hoax. And we start going down into the mud of a thriller whose main characters are three children who know, one, to invent something all the time, two, to read all the books they want and remember them, three, to bite at everything and on everything. And what's more these three kids are able to isolate themselves in some kind of contemplation sanctuary in which grown-ups cannot enter. Then they can face any danger imaginable and vanquish any fiend from hell and even lower than hell, that is to say from real life. They have to discover who killed their parents, who is trying to capture their fortune, and they must defeat that criminal on his very ground: illusions so real looking that they are real in reality though virtual for everyone real, except the kids. So they can go from one uncle to one aunt but the bad one will always come back and they are the only ones not to be lured by his comedian's performance. Then the film is a perfect pile and mine of inventive ideas and horrors, frightening animals and horrible situations, from the confrontation to giant serpents and snakes to the fall into some fathomless abyss or bottomless chasm. And beware of giant leeches that jump at your face. It is a real pleasure when they finally learn the truth and use it to escape the last trap of the bad uncle, the Beetlejuicy fake real marriage, and we really feel not sorry but proud for them who were able to prove inventive readers who know how to bite and could isolate themselves into surreal efficacy against criminals.

886589,AQ2RL6HTVI86T,B0007PICAI,"J. Bridell ""Lost Johnny""","[5, 7]",".There is a very telling sequence at the very beginning of LSASOUE, that sets the tone for the film.  Everything is in bright happy colors, everyone is smiling, a bunch of gophers pop up and then ""The Happy Little Elf"" comes out, but something is wrong.  The elf is smiling of course, but it is a forced smile, the colors and the music are trying much too hard to be happy and it rings painfully false, it is clear this is not the film we were going to see.  The narrator warns us that the story he is about to tell us is not happy, and that if we wanted to see a happy film we should go elsewhere, he hints that this is a depressing and sad story, that we might not want to hear it and we might want to go to the next theater over where, no doubt, there would be a happy, cheery film to see (The narrator could not have know The Ring Two was next door, but he can't be blamed for that).  The fortunate aspect of this unfortunate tale is that, in the end, it was not a depressing film at all, nor was it realistic, it was as off the wall as the Happy Little Elf, just not as colorful. The world  is never as happy or sad as we think, and neither is this film.  Tim Burtons name has been mentioned as the style of the film, I am forced to disagree, Burtons latest films have been pretty bad, he could learn something from this.  The story is of three orphaned children who's lives are a misery.  This is because the adults in there world are either very cruel or very stupid.  I am sure everyone will have an opinion about this, how children are mistreated and bounced in and out of foster homes and such based on the whim of people who are in charge based on the year they were born, not on there intellect or abilities to raise children.  I do not have children myself so I am more likely to identify with them then with the adults.  This film could have gotten very preachy but it did not, good for them.  It could have been very silly, especially with Jim Carrey who could get out of hand if allowed to, he did not.  I truly enjoyed this film because is was not what was promised.  Instead of a depressing story of hapless orphans, is a story of survival and of finding happiness where one can.  I like that.  Also it's wonderful blending of retro and future is perfect.  I love that stuff, Orlofs car has a tape player, a reel to reel, perfect.  There is death and mayhem, murder and betrayal, but it is still OK for kids (older kids) and it was done correctly, this is not easy.  The best thing about this film is the way the writers and cast tread so very carefully about the various landmines that could sabotage it, and there are so very many.  Also we are privy, I think, to the next great actress if her generation, Emily Browning.  She joins Dakota Fanning,Devigh Chase, and Emma Watson as the next wave of fine young stars who, I hope, we will see more of.  Finally there is the wonderful narration by Jude Law.  I think his best line is when we learn of the children's parents dying and how they were told about it, the narrator simply says that if you have never lost someone dear to you you wont understand, but that it's the worst feeling in the world and it never stops, this could have been so bad but it wasn't.

He was apprehensive about the movie, thinking it might ruin the experience of the books. But he, I and the whole family enjoyed this interpretation of the books. Hands-down, the movie sets are the best thing about the movie. They are a weird combination of 1930s London and Edward Gorey, but with touches of modern life thrown in -- credit cards, faxes and car phones. The effect gives the movie a gritty long-ago feel while keeping it in the present.Jim Carrey's portrayal of mean Count Olaf was marvelous, topping the sometimes spare descriptions in the books. Playing Olaf as an over-the-top ham actor, Carrey gave the role just the right blend of greed, self-love and evil.

""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round.The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but ""Lemony Snicket..."" entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!).There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles.

I can't really say I see where it's for kids but I really enjoyed it anyway. Violet  and Clause  (Emily Browning and Liam Aiken) along with their baby sister get stuck in a bad nightmare of a situation when their parents die in a tragic fire. Things get even worse when they have to live with the slimy and cruel Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). He hopes to just get his hands on their money and will do anything to get it including kill.Yes the movie is as morbib as it sounds but in a fun and clever way and it never goes overboard with violence. Although the scene where Olaf actually hits Clause wasn't needed. A scene where he locks them in  his car on railroad tracks with a train coming is nicely done though. It's clever and full of tension and excitement. The kids are smart and use their brains to get out of danger which is the only real good example one could get from this movie lol. The boy knows a lot about everything from reading lots and lots of books and the girl is just a good thinker when she ties her hair back in a ponytail.Jim Carrey is over the top as usual but the kids shine big time and are really good in their parts. Carrey shows he can act more when he's in dramas like Eternal Sunshine of a Spottless Mind or Truman Show. In comic roles he can try too hard to be funny and it can be often annoying. He is a  funny guy but he trys too hard to steal the show here. Sometimes he needs to take it down a few notches and take his riddeling ""lol"" and that's the case here. Still though probably no one else could've pulled off the part ""or maybe the under-used John Lithgow could've"". I think Meryl Streep is actually funnier though as their Aunt Josephine who's afraid of everything. It's funny when she warns  Clause to get away from the refrigerator because it might fall on him and crush him. Plus when they first arrive at the house she warns them to walk in slowly or they might fall and lose their heads. She's that way because she witnessed her late husband get eatten by leaches. Billy Connolly is also a delight as their Uncle Monty. He's obsessed with snakes and has a house full of them. So that's what makes him just a little strange.

Rooney,"[0, 0]","In ""Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" (2004), narrated by Jude Law, Jim Carey not only plays a hammy would-be actor, Count Olaf, but he mugs up his multiple parts so much that the movie gets overwhelmed by him. One can't tell it's Jim Carrey because of his weird make-up, but he's still an annoying presence. How do you shut him down or off without foregoing the movie altogether?The movie, a dark comedy, is based upon Daniel Handler's popular books which have been labeled ""subversive children's books"" because they are unconventional. Three children have been made orphans when their parents perished in a fire. They are the Baudelaire family (same name as a famous French poet). The three children are very resourceful: Violet is a clever inventor, Klaus is an avid reader who remembers everything he's ever read, and the youngest, Sunny, speaks in subtitles.Lawyer Poe, like a mannered character from a book rather than a real person, places them with Count Olaf, a crook who wants the wealthy orphans' inheritance. In a series of Perils of Pauline cliffhangers (cars planted on tracks in front of oncoming trains, leeches swarming and attacking, and a Charles Addams house teetering on the edge of a cliff), Olaf tries to kill off the kids.Meryl Streep acts like she's from another movie (a not very good one), and it's one of her poorest performances, ineffective and cloying. Keep an eye out for a pointless cameo appearance by Dustin Hoffman.Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly), a good guy, has a collection of snakes that may scare or delight the kiddos.At times the flick is overly cute. I find the story to be clunky and labored. I'm not sure that little kids are going to figure out what's going on, and Jim Carrey's over-the-top posturing may not register.The closing credits are very cleverly done, reminiscent of illustrator Gorey.

886602,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B0007PICAI,John Kwok,"[4, 4]","Director Brad Silberling, his writers and cast, have fashioned a truly entertaining film which owes much to the drawings of acclaimed New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams and the early work of director Tim Burton. Indeed, it is fair to say that Silberling has made an Addamesque version of ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"", combining the plots of the first three novels in the series. Jim Carrey is his usual manical self, but here it works, in the role of the villainous dilettante Count Olaf, though be warned that he does add a few of his self indulgent flourishes which distract from this otherwise, dark, tragic saga. To his credit, Silberling does a fine job in adhering to the bleak, dark atmosphere surrounding the Baudelaire children, remaining faithful to the spirit, if not actual content, of the Lemony Snicket novels.I haven't read the novels, but found the cast far more enjoyable than the cast for the first ""Harry Potter"" film. Emily Browning(Violet), Liam Aiken (Klaus) and Kara and Shelby Hoffman (Sunny) are a fine bunch of child actors portraying the Baudelaire children, with highest honors going to Emily Browning and Liam Aiken (Incidentally, as an inside morbid joke, the characters Klaus and Sunny are named after the real-life couple Claus and Sunny von Bulow featured in the film ""Reversal of Fortune"".). They easily hold their own against Jim Carrey's deliciously wicked villain Count Olaf. Billy Connelly chews up the scenery a bit as the children's herpetologist Uncle Monty, while Meryl Streep is just as memorable as the phobia-obsessed Aunt Josephine. Dustin Hoffman has an uncredited appearance as the critic of a play written, produced, and acted in by Count Olaf.

886603,A24RT6AVJXJZHF,B0007PICAI,"John P. Thiel ""John P. Thiel""","[2, 3]","This movie is based on the first three books in the series of thirteen very short volumes.  A lot of people, who apparrently hadn't read the book(s) say Jim Carey basically played himself in the movie, but this couldn't be further from the truth--he played the part perfectly.I'm not a big Jim Carey fan, but think he does get a bad rap for no apparrent reason.  The last big criticism of him was for Cable Guy--in which he actually played a serious role.  I suppose Cable Guy was a comedy, but it was a 'black comedy' and this movie is much the same.Sure this movie (and the written story) is funny, but it's also in that Harry Potter (or Peter Pan, or Alice in Wonderland, or The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, or many other much greater and confirmed classic 'children's stories') stream of being a good story for children that's not the traditional 'happily ever after.'  It wont give your kids nightmares or bruise their fragile sensibilities, but it might fire a few more brain cells than other childrens stories which strain themselves not to cross those lines parents draw  in our V-chip American society.Put more frankly, your kids wont turn into serial killers because they watched or read something that wasn't completely innocent, puritanical, or childish.Bottom Line: Because the movie really turned me onto the books, I'm glad I saw it.

886604,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0007PICAI,Jonathan Appleseed,"[119, 138]","It's somewhat difficult to review this film. Any adaptation of a book sets certain expectations for those who are seeing the movie - and the most common expectation is that the movie is going to parallel, as accurately as it can, the books.Does this do that? Yes and no.The central plot elements of the books are there: the greedy Count Olaf who wants to steal their fortune; the bumbling Mr. Poe who can't seem to understand anything; Uncle Monty, who makes them feel at home for the first time since losing their parents; and their Aunt Josephine, who is afraid of so many things - radiators, ovens, falling refrigerators, and, of course, realtors.However, the movie moves rather quickly to the second book, skirting swiftly around the first book and inserting a segue that didn't happen in any book to cause the movement. I was puzzled by this. There were other liberties taken, but as I ruminate over them, they seem rather insignificant. The resolution of Uncle Monty's ""scene"" was nearly identical to the one in the book, as was the resolution to the ""scene"" featuring Aunt Josephine. As I said, the central plot elements remained the same.In an interesting and altogether understandable move (as it was the most intriguing filmable climax), the ending of the first book was made the ending of the movie.All of the sets were well created: Olaf's, Monty's, Josephine's home - and even the ruined Baudelaire mansion. They were believable and well done.Some of the actors seemed out of place, particularly the ones playing Mr. Poe and Klaus. I don't understand why they were so far removed from their physical descriptions in the book. Surely finding someone taller to play Mr. Poe couldn't have been that difficult (he wasn't, by the way, coughing and sniffing constantly), and at the very least they could have put glasses on Klaus.Jim Carrey was somewhat over-the-top as Count Olaf and Captain Sham, but he was understated and perfect as Stefano. Count Olaf is, as any readers of the book know (and I've read and reviewed all of them) a rather over-the-top character, so I found his portrayal of Olaf to be spot-on and didn't have a problem with it as some ""real"" reviewers have.The person I saw the film with had never read the books, and when we were leaving, I asked his opinion. He said that he loved it, and in fact enjoyed it more than the Harry Potter movies. Personally, I disagree - and this is my review. &#60;grin&#62;The movie also gave away a few secrets, and I think that may have been because the filmmakers aren't certain whether or not they are going to make any more films. I'm not aware of any filming underway for a second set of ""Unfortunate Events"", so the kids portraying Violet, Klaus and Sunny will, and likely have, already outgrown their characters. Perhaps the filmmakers gave these secrets away believing that the story they were telling needed more resolution than it had. In any event, if they do make more films, it will be interesting to see how they handle the divulging of these secrets.If I had never read the books, I think I would have ""loved"" the movie too. However, I've read all of them, and while the filmmakers did a very good job recreating the spirit of Snickett's work, they didn't do an excellent one. Hence the four star review. (Four stars means very good - five stars means excellent, or superlative. At least in my book.)",4,Very good interpretation of Snickett's superlative books,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,3378,"['somewhat', 'difficult', 'review', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'certain', 'expectations', 'who', 'are', 'seeing', 'movie', 'most', 'common', 'expectation', 'movie', 'going', 'parallel', 'as', 'accurately', 'can', 'books.Does', 'do', 'Yes', 'no.The', 'central', 'plot', 'elements', 'books', 'are', 'there', 'greedy', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'steal', 'fortune', 'bumbling', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'anything', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'who', 'feel', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'losing', 'parents', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'who', 'afraid', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'radiators', 'ovens', 'falling', 'refrigerators', 'course', 'realtors.However', 'movie', 'rather', 'quickly', 'second', 'book', 'skirting', 'swiftly', 'first', 'book', 'inserting', 'segue', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'book', 'cause', 'movement', 'was', 'puzzled', 'were', 'other', 'liberties', 'taken', 'ruminate', 'seem', 'rather', 'insignificant', 'resolution', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'scene', 'was', 'nearly', 'identical', 'one', 'book', 'was', 'resolution', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'said', 'central', 'plot', 'elements', 'remained', 'same.In', 'interesting', 'altogether', 'understandable', 'move', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'filmable', 'climax', 'ending', 'first', 'book', 'was', 'made', 'ending', 'movie.All', 'sets', 'were', 'well', 'created', 'Olaf', 'Monty', 'Josephine', 'home', 'even', 'ruined', 'Baudelaire', 'mansion', 'were', 'believable', 'well', 'done.Some', 'actors', 'seemed', 'place', 'particularly', 'ones', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Klaus', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'physical', 'descriptions', 'book', 'Surely', 'finding', 'someone', 'taller', 'play', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'coughing', 'sniffing', 'constantly', 'very', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'glasses', 'Klaus.Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'somewhat', 'over-the-top', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Captain', 'Sham', 'was', 'understated', 'perfect', 'Stefano', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'readers', 'book', 'know', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviewed', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'found', 'portrayal', 'Olaf', 'be', 'spot-on', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'real', 'reviewers', 'have.The', 'person', 'saw', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'when', 'were', 'leaving', 'asked', 'opinion', 'said', 'loved', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Personally', 'disagree', 'review', '60', 'grin', '62', 'movie', 'also', 'gave', 'away', 'few', 'secrets', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'certain', 'not', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'more', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'filming', 'underway', 'second', 'set', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'kids', 'portraying', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'Sunny', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'already', 'outgrown', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'gave', 'secrets', 'away', 'believing', 'story', 'were', 'telling', 'needed', 'more', 'resolution', 'had', 'event', 'do', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'handle', 'divulging', 'secrets.If', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'too', 'However', ""'ve"", 'read', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'spirit', 'Snickett', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'excellent', 'one', 'Hence', 'four', 'star', 'review', 'Four', 'stars', 'very', 'good', 'five', 'stars', 'excellent', 'superlative', 'least', 'book']",N/A

Yes, kids, it's true. Jim Carrey actually did something right for a change. Don't get me wrong, his ""famous"" overacting is still present, but not to its usual extreme. He actually comes off as a clever, deceitful villain. As for the rest of the characters, they are all very imaginative, and pretty much mirror their characters from the books. Aunt Josephine is still the paranoid weirdo she was in the book (she's probably the best character in here), Uncle Monty is still a snake loving dude who treats the orphans like family, and Mr. Poe is still incredibly stupid. As for the orphans, Sunny steals the show with her humorous babble. Klaus is sort of boring...his character is just like in the book, but there's something about him that's just kind of...blah. Violet, the eldest orphan (who happens to be beautiful in this movie), is the one that's always saving them from their predicaments with her quick thinking. The environments in this movie manage to be melancholy and set a depressing mood while remaining colorful and easy on the eyes, something I'm sure was NOT easy to achieve. This is definitely a good movie to go see with the family. I also recommend it to anyone that's read books 1-3.

He is quite devilish and pulls off all three characters with unlikely perfection.  Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep are fine as guardians of the young children.  Connolly stands out from the pack, as the caring and well-meaning herpetologist uncle of the family.  Cedric the Entertainer and Dustin Hoffman have brief roles here, and the gentleman who plays Mr. Poe is great.As far as set design and special effects, they are wonderful.  There are elements of Tim Burton's films and the Harry Potter movies in the ""atmosphere"" of the sets.  They are dark, gloomy, and sometimes a little scary for the young lot.The music sets the tone in a neat and suspenseful manner.The extras on the disc include a rather tiring look at bloopers and the transformation of Jim Carrey into his multiple roles.  There is a brief look at how the children were picked for the film and an interactive bit with Carrey's characters.Overall, a fine family film, though very small children may be frightened.  Also, I recall only one curse word in the film(I could be wrong), but nothing to bad.  It's a safe bet that if your children can handle Harry Potter, they can handle the scares in this.Highly recommended.",4,Very Fun And Quite Unique,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,1937,"['Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'bought', 'young', 'daughter', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'fun', 'adventure', 'few', 'scares', 'scattered', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'young', 'old', 'alike.Since', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'can', 'only', 'base', 'review', 'what', 'witness', 'screen', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'are', 'wonderful', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'intelligent', 'not', 'too', 'mischievious', 'have', 'deep', 'love', 'other', 'little', 'sister', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'adorable', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'job', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'three', 'characters', 'flick', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Captain', 'Sham', 'Stephano', 'scientific', 'assistant', 'quite', 'devilish', 'off', 'three', 'characters', 'unlikely', 'perfection', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'are', 'fine', 'guardians', 'young', 'children', 'Connolly', 'out', 'pack', 'caring', 'well-meaning', 'herpetologist', 'uncle', 'family', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'have', 'brief', 'roles', 'here', 'gentleman', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'great.As', 'far', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'elements', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'atmosphere', 'sets', 'are', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'sometimes', 'little', 'scary', 'young', 'lot.The', 'music', 'tone', 'neat', 'suspenseful', 'manner.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'include', 'rather', 'tiring', 'look', 'bloopers', 'transformation', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'multiple', 'roles', 'brief', 'look', 'how', 'children', 'were', 'picked', 'film', 'interactive', 'bit', 'Carrey', 'characters.Overall', 'fine', 'family', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'frightened', 'Also', 'recall', 'only', 'one', 'curse', 'word', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'bad', 'safe', 'bet', 'children', 'can', 'handle', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'can', 'handle', 'scares', 'this.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
886613,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007PICAI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 2]","Tales read in One Thousand and One Nights and the Grimm Brother's accumulation of European stories based on local folklore still bring it's readers suspense and adventure.  Many of their stories were hauntingly disturbing as these tales dealt with murder, moral predicaments, and deceptions.  The suspense often seems to stem from threats to the very existence of the characters in the tales.  One of the stories that the Grimm Brother's delivered to the world is Hansel and Gretel where the parents plotted to leave their children in the woods as they were starving.  Another example would be One Thousand and One Nights where the foundation of the tale is the shrewd Shahrazad's ability to tell a tale that she interrupts at dawn by leaving the tale in what we call a cliff hanger.  Shahrazad's motive is to never end the story, but to leave it hanging with suspense in order to kept her head to her body as the king was to kill her at dawn.  These tales were handed down orally from parent to child, which often functioned as a learning tool.  For example, the Grimm Brother's Little Red Riding Hood taught children not to talk to strangers.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events has the same ingredients as the One Thousand and One Nights and the Grimm Brother's tales as it tells several tales within a tale, and each tale has a lesson.  The film opens with a blissful imagery of a happy elf, but this is suddenly crushed as Lemony Snicket's (Jude Law), the story's narrator, begins to inform the audience that this story will not be about a happy elf and if the viewer's came to see a story about a happy elf they better leave as this tale will not be pleasant.  Lemony's Snicket continues to explain that the film the audience is about to see will be both scary and unpleasant, much like the true tales of the Grimm Borther's.  Thus, be warned and let the story begin.The tale Lemony Snicket passes on to the audience reflects the unfortunate events of the three children of the Baudelaire family, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.  The oldest child, Violet (Emily Browning), is a clever girl with the hands of a brilliant engineer and inventor as every time she puts up her hair she begins to invent things.  Klaus (Liam Aiken), second in age, devours books as if it was as necessary as breathing itself and with his reading he has acquired a wide range of knowledge, which might come of use later.  The youngest of the three is Sunny who has the immense physical skill of biting and chewing on everything in her near vicinity.  Together the three children find ways to deal with the many dangers and threats that they encounter on a perilous journey that is framed with loom and doom.Initially it is revealed for the Baudelaire children through the banker Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall), whose name might be a nod toward the brilliant writer Edgar Allan Poe, that their parents have died in an unfortunate fire.  Mr. Poe has been given the responsibility of finding a new home for the three children as he finds the closest, physically that is, relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who is a distant cousin of the parents.  It becomes apparent that Count Olaf does not want the children as he refers to Sunny as a primate, and puts the children into hard physical labor in his crumbling house, which seems to be close to the home of Count Dracula.  Count Olaf reveals his true nature as he wants to get his hands on the large inheritance of the children as he begins to plot and scheme an unfortunate accident for the children.Hopefully, most children are not too frightened by the tale of Lemony Snicket as the story he unveils offers much suspense, horror, and creepy characters.  The story is evidently not meant for an older audience as the mise-en-scene is extravagantly fantastic or horrific, which only a child could appreciate.  The performance by Jim Carrey is hysterically exaggerated, but it fits with the theme and the atmosphere that the film projects.  The plot is also unmistakably easy to understand and follow, which might be needed for a younger audience.  It is encouraging to see that the film received a PG rating, which encourages parent's involvement in the story of Lemony Snicket.  The parental involvement could further the child's understanding of the film as the lessons of the tale will advance the child's knowledge of the world and it's many dangers.  The film offers a truly a remarkable cinematic experience for a younger audience as it follows the footsteps of the Grimm Brother's and Shahrazad's storytelling where valuable lessons can be learned.",4,Brilliant Film for a Young Audience in the Grimm's Footsteps,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,4580,"['Tales', 'read', 'One', 'Thousand', 'One', 'Nights', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'accumulation', 'European', 'stories', 'based', 'local', 'folklore', 'still', 'bring', 'readers', 'suspense', 'adventure', 'Many', 'stories', 'were', 'hauntingly', 'disturbing', 'tales', 'dealt', 'murder', 'moral', 'predicaments', 'deceptions', 'suspense', 'often', 'stem', 'threats', 'very', 'existence', 'characters', 'tales', 'One', 'stories', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'delivered', 'world', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'where', 'parents', 'plotted', 'leave', 'children', 'woods', 'were', 'starving', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'One', 'Thousand', 'One', 'Nights', 'where', 'foundation', 'tale', 'shrewd', 'Shahrazad', 'ability', 'tell', 'tale', 'dawn', 'leaving', 'tale', 'what', 'call', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'Shahrazad', 'motive', 'never', 'end', 'story', 'leave', 'hanging', 'suspense', 'order', 'kept', 'head', 'body', 'king', 'was', 'kill', 'dawn', 'tales', 'were', 'handed', 'down', 'orally', 'parent', 'child', 'often', 'functioned', 'learning', 'tool', 'example', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'taught', 'children', 'not', 'talk', 'strangers.Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'same', 'ingredients', 'One', 'Thousand', 'One', 'Nights', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'tales', 'several', 'tales', 'tale', 'tale', 'lesson', 'film', 'blissful', 'imagery', 'happy', 'elf', 'suddenly', 'crushed', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Jude', 'Law', 'story', 'narrator', 'inform', 'audience', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'elf', 'viewer', 'came', 'see', 'story', 'happy', 'elf', 'better', 'leave', 'tale', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'pleasant', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'explain', 'film', 'audience', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'scary', 'unpleasant', 'much', 'true', 'tales', 'Grimm', 'Borther', 'Thus', 'be', 'warned', 'let', 'story', 'begin.The', 'tale', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'audience', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'three', 'children', 'Baudelaire', 'family', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'Sunny', 'oldest', 'child', 'Violet', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'clever', 'girl', 'hands', 'brilliant', 'engineer', 'inventor', 'time', 'up', 'hair', 'invent', 'things', 'Klaus', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'second', 'age', 'books', 'was', 'as', 'necessary', 'breathing', 'reading', 'acquired', 'wide', 'range', 'knowledge', 'might', 'come', 'use', 'later', 'youngest', 'three', 'Sunny', 'who', 'immense', 'physical', 'skill', 'biting', 'chewing', 'everything', 'near', 'vicinity', 'three', 'children', 'find', 'ways', 'deal', 'many', 'dangers', 'threats', 'encounter', 'perilous', 'journey', 'framed', 'loom', 'doom.Initially', 'revealed', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'banker', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'name', 'might', 'be', 'nod', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'parents', 'have', 'died', 'unfortunate', 'fire', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'been', 'given', 'responsibility', 'finding', 'new', 'home', 'three', 'children', 'closest', 'physically', 'relative', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'distant', 'cousin', 'parents', 'apparent', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'not', 'want', 'children', 'Sunny', 'primate', 'children', 'hard', 'physical', 'labor', 'crumbling', 'house', 'be', 'close', 'home', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'true', 'nature', 'get', 'hands', 'large', 'inheritance', 'children', 'plot', 'scheme', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'children.Hopefully', 'most', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'frightened', 'tale', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'story', 'offers', 'much', 'suspense', 'horror', 'creepy', 'characters', 'story', 'evidently', 'not', 'meant', 'older', 'audience', 'mise-en-scene', 'extravagantly', 'fantastic', 'horrific', 'only', 'child', 'could', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'hysterically', 'exaggerated', 'theme', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'projects', 'plot', 'also', 'unmistakably', 'easy', 'understand', 'follow', 'might', 'be', 'needed', 'younger', 'audience', 'encouraging', 'see', 'film', 'received', 'PG', 'rating', 'parent', 'involvement', 'story', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'parental', 'involvement', 'could', 'further', 'child', 'understanding', 'film', 'lessons', 'tale', 'will', 'advance', 'child', 'knowledge', 'world', 'many', 'dangers', 'film', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'younger', 'audience', 'footsteps', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'Shahrazad', 'storytelling', 'where', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'learned']",N/A

This one of those rare movies that kids and grown-ups may both actual enjoy watching together.The movie takes place when the Baudelaire children are suddenly orphaned by a sudden and mysterious fire at their home- leaving them with nothing and with hardly any family left... Voilet, Klaus, and Sunny who are imaginatively creative, and intelligent children are sent to live with their uncle- Count Olaf who works them day and night while he lives off their parents large fortune. He attempts to kill them-- after the first incident the children are sent to live with another uncle(Bill Connolly) who isn't afraid of anything and lives in a mansion that has a lavish snake collection-- until Olaf shows up. The children are then sent to live with their crazy aunt(Streep) who is increadiably morbid and fearful person. She eventually is eating up by leeches. The children through their misfortune and mishaps more secrets about their mother and father as well, as the fact-- their not so misfortunate as long as they are together.With wonderful sets and an intelligently not over the top script this movie is simply perfect great for kids and adults.Jim Carrey is a jack of all trades in this movie showing up three times trying to ruin the lives of the young sudden orphans... and does just as good a job as he did as the Grinch as Count Olaf-- making us love and hate him at the same time.

886620,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007PICAI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 6]","I loved the end of this movie.  Specifically I loved the end credits as we see the small animated figures of the Baudelaire orphans fleeing from the figure of Count Olaf.  I loved the look of the animation and the layouts, which seemed to owe something to the cartoons of Chas. Addams, the nightmare of H.P. Lovecraft, Tim Burton's creations in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and those painting on velvet of kids and animals with large eyes.  Benjamin Goldman and Todd Hemker were the layout artists and animators for both the main titles and the credit crawl.  Goldman was the effects artist for the main titles on ""Elf"" and Hemker will have to spend the rest of his career trying to top this first movie credit.  I also loved the music by Thomas Newman, which was another reason I had to keep playing the end credits over and over again.  There are end credits where the music hooks you (e.g., ""Moulin Rouge""), but finding one that is visually interesting that does not involve outtakes or crazy credits is hard to find.  With ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" we have one of the all time greats.I like the children playing the Baudelaire orphans as well because they had both the appearance and attitude I anticipated having read the novels that served as the foundation for this first movie (there are more novels, ergo, there should be more movies, and I take the spyglass at the end, that is the end before the credits, as a token of a return visit).  Emily Browning is Violet, Liam Aiken is Klaus, with Kara and Shelby Hoffman playing Sunny.  All of them are trying to survive in a world that refuses to acknowledge either their intelligence or their plight.  As everyone who has been delighted by these stories is well aware, the lives of the Baudelaire orphans go from bad to worse.Unlike the adaptation of the Harry Potter novels, the only other reasonable point of comparison for the Lemony Snicket books, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is hampered somewhat by key literary aspects of the original narratives.  One of my favorite parts is when the definition of key terms are called into play, because Lemony Snicket is well aware that what a word means often has a lot to do with how it is said. Then there is the way that Sunny's various and sundry sounds can also be translated into meaningful conversation.  That latter can be accomplished by subtitles, which do wear a bit thin after a while, but the former is greatly reduced to the point that when it returns you realize how much you have missed it.  The great look of the film extends beyond the Baudelaire orphans to all of the sets, which provide an unsettling mixture of wonders and horror for the children to explore courtesy of production designer Rick Heinrichs (""Sleepy Hollow"") and art directors John Dexter (""Planet of the Apes"") and Martin Whist, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki making everything look creepy, even in direct sunlight.You know what I thought worked against the film?  You might not believe this, but I thought they were wrong to cast Jim Carrey in the part of Count Olaf and that Meryl Streep was pretty much wasted as Aunt Josephine.  For that matter I was not sure if Billy Connolly clicked as Uncle Monty, and all of this was surprising because I was certainly originally impressed by the casting when I first heard of who had been signed.  For me Count Olaf was pretty much the least funny character in the book, so every time Carrey starts going over the top (which is basically from the moment he appears on screen), it worked against the character for me.  Basically he was becoming too silly to really be dangerous and I think that affects the dynamic that made the novels work, which was black comedy rather than slapstick.  Just because the story is now being told in a more visual medium does not mean you monkey with the dynamic, especially when what Lemony Snicket offers is rather unique in terms of what is being sold in the children's literature section of your local bookstore.The DVD extras are quite impressive for a one-disc set.  Goldman and Hemker animation is used to good effect for the menus (be sure to press on the object in the middle of the special features menus and press on it several times).  There is audio commentary by director Brad Silberling, once by himself and once in the company of the ""real"" and extremely disappointed Lemony Snickert, who has serious doubts and grave concerns regarding pretty much everything from start to finish in the film (one constant lament is that the actors are all throwing their careers away).  The featurettes have to do with ""Bad Beginnings,"" ""Building a Bad Actor"" (to wit, Carrey), ""Making the Baudelaire Children Miserable,"" and ""Interactive Olaf"" for those who can never get enough of Jim Carrey.  In terms of ""Orphaned Scenes"" you will find eleven ""Dismal Deletions"" and five ""Obnoxious Outtakes"" (See for yourself as Oscar winning actress Meryl Streep puts a baby into a sleep so deep the infant cannot be aroused!).  These extras, plus the fact that I absolutely love the credit crawl, amply justify my rounding up on this DVD.",5,A DVD that definitely enhances enjoyment of the film,1114732800,"04 29,

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 0]","My second-grader has read all 13 Lemony Snicket books, so this 4-star rating is really hers - I probably would have gone with 3 stars myself. If you are not familiar with this series, it is a somewhat faux-dark comic story of 3 orphans with a fortune who are shuffled from relative to relative, each of which is more eccentric, and each of whom dies or disappears under mysterious circumstances - all except for the evil Uncle, or Count, Olaf, played by Jim Carrey.  The darkness in this movie is covered well - no deaths are shown, and it is all very fantastical. It also has a good heart, as the 3 orphans really discover the  meaning of family. However, it's still a dark story, and may not be what you are looking for. If you or your children have read the books, you should also be aware that this movie combines plot points from 3 of the 13 books.The performances are quite good - the orphans are well-cast, and you can't go wrong with Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep (who plays an aunt.) The settings and environment are also great. My daughter's main complaint was that so few of the books are covered, and that it wasn't done as a series. My main complaint is that unless you've read the books it's a bit disjointed and ends abruptly, so it doesn't really stand up as a stand-alone film. I felt like the writers and producers couldn't quite decide what they wanted it to be, so it lacks focus.

It's funny! I couldn't be that funny if I tried. His completely ludicrous laugh turned gasp when one of his plans gets foiled is just one example. As well, the DVD has bits and outtakes of him in each of his roles. A lot of mannerisms are his own! You can watch it several times and still laugh at the same things. Even just the things he says to fit each persona- just too funny in its predictability. The movie itself is a little weird, though. It was hard at first to tell what era the movie is supposed to be taking place in. Any, I guess. And, some people speak with English accents and some don't.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.IMPORTANT PRECISION: neither of us ever read any of the Lemony Snickett books, before watching this film or since...After their parents die in a suspicious fire, three orphaned Baudelaire children are entrusted to their closest relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carey). Those children are:- Violet Baudelaire (Emily Browning), a clever 14 years old damzel who is a natural born inventor- Klaus (Liam Aiken), slightly younger than Emily, a clever book-wormish type- Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman) is just a 2 years old toddler, mostly interested in chewing things...)))It is quite quickly revealed that Count Olaf, a very unsuccessful (although surprisingly gifted) actor is an unsavory character and his intentions are of most evil nature... And then the film really begins.This is by no means a bad film and in fact there are many good scenes. The children are very likeable and it is easy to root for them, especially considering how despicable, cruel and merciless is the main villain. There are some colourful secondary characters like the well meaning but completely clueless Mr Poe (Timothy Spall), the lawyer in charge of Baudelaire's estate, gentle but slightly mad Dr Montgomery Montgomery (Billy Connolly) and harmlessly psychotic aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep).However, considering that everybody (other than the children) in this film is either completely insane (that includes Count Olaf) or totally cut from reality, this film is really WEIRD. The visuals are also very peculiar - to say the least... When you add some creapy scary scenes, all of this makes this film unwatchable for little children, like younger than 8. There is not enough humour in this film and it actually is a waste of Jim Carey's talent (some of his comedies actually were good). Also, the whole mystery which is announced in the beginning is solved with a very anti-climactic way at the end. And finally, because this film was (of course!) supposed to launch a franchise (it will not happen), there is not even a real ending...For all those reasons this film is an average thing - watchable, but ultimately nothing more.

I'll bet its producers, banking on making a successful series of movies from the popular Lemony Snicket books, pulled their punches. The quest for commercial success nearly always squashes artistic considerations.The three young Baudelaire children - Violet, Klaus and Sunny - are naturally devastated when their parents are killed in a fire in their fashionable mansion. Violet and Klaus rightfully suspect arson. They are sent to live with a relative named Count Olaf [Jim Carrey], an aspiring actor who plans to kill the kids in order to inherit their vast fortune. When his plot is foiled, the children are sent to live with a series of guardians, but Olaf pursues them relentlessly.A short plot summary does not do justice to the movie's real assets. The movie takes place in the world of imagination. The children live in an amalgamation of time. 1885 meets 2005 and anywhere in between. The acting is superb but broad, as befits a satire. The photography, the sets and the art direction alone make it a movie worth viewing.Hopefully, the Snicket movie series will continue.

886641,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0007PICAI,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 3]","In 2004, Brad Silberling directed the film entitled ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"".  The film was based upon a series of dark children's books written by Daniel Handler, who created the pseudonym of Lemony Snickets.  The film's basic plot is that the wealthy parents of three children die in an inexplicable fire at their spacious home.  The orphaned children that include Violet Baudelaire (Emily Browning), Klaus Baudelaire (Liam Aiken) and the intelligent infant Sunny Baudelaire (Kara Hoffman & Shelby Hoffman), are taken by their parent's attorney, Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall, who played Peter Pettigrew in the 2004 ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), to a distant relative named Count Olaf (Jim Carrey).  The eccentric & unpleasant Count Olaf agrees to take the children in because he wants their inheritance and will do anything (including murder) to get it.  The children quickly figure this out after Count Olaf leaves them locked in his car on railroad tracks with an approaching train, but the children survive thanks to their own abilities and the timely arrival of Mr. Poe.  Unfortunately for the children, neither Mr. Poe nor any other adults believe their dire warnings that Count Olaf is attempting to kill them; but Mr. Poe does take the children to their Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and later to their Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep), each of whom meet tragic ends with Count Olaf very close by.  Eventually, they are returned to Count Olaf who decides upon another course to help ensure his ability to obtain the children's wealth.Upon watching this dark film, I was quickly reminded of the 1965 Jerry Lewis film entitled ""The Family Jewels"", in which an orphaned girl named Donna Peyton (Donna Butterworth) is taken by her chauffer named Willard (Jerry Lewis) to visit 5 of her 6 uncles (each played by Jerry Lewis).  The sixth uncle, named 'Bugs' (also played by Jerry Lewis), kidnaps Donna for a ransom; but in the end, Donna must decide whom she wants to be her legal guardian.  Similar to Jerry Lewis playing seven characters in ""The Family Jewels"", Jim Carrey plays Count Olaf, who disguises himself to be three other people; but where ""The Family Jewels"" is a light-hearted comedy, ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" was intended to be a dark comedy with cinematography & costuming similar to the 1991 ""The Addams Family"", as well as the 1995 French film ""The City of Lost Children"" (a.k.a., ""La Cit&eacute; des enfants perdus"").Though some may argue that ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" could not be based upon the Jerry Lewis' 1965 film ""The Family Jewels"" because of the books written by Daniel Handler, two significant facts must be pointed out: Daniel Handler was born in 1970 and the first of his books upon which ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" was based upon wasn't published until 1999.  Hence, it is entirely possible that Daniel Handler's dark children's books were inspired by the 1965 film ""The Family Jewels"", but he chose to have three orphaned children instead of one and created a single dark character in the form of Count Olaf to be the cause of the various unfortunate events.Though the special effects, cinematography, sets and wardrobe were impressive in ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"", the plot was rather predictable given its similarity to the 1965 film ""The Family Jewels"" and the ongoing inability for the children to convince any other adults about what was going on became tiresome.  Also, in spite of the good performances by Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep and Billy Connolly, their characters, as well as the children's characters, were not particularly engaging or comedic with the exception of Sunny.  Hence, I can only rate ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" with 2 out of 5 stars.  Other characters in the film include Lemony Snickets (voice of Jude Law) who narrates the film and one of the white-faced women (Jennifer Coolidge, who played Paulette Bonafont&eacute; in the 2001 ""Legally Blonde"") that was a friend to Count Olaf.",2,"A Cross Between ""The Family Jewels"" & ""The Addams Family""",1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,4092,"['2004', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'directed', 'film', 'entitled', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'series', 'dark', 'children', 'books', 'written', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'who', 'created', 'pseudonym', 'Lemony', 'Snickets', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'three', 'children', 'die', 'inexplicable', 'fire', 'spacious', 'home', 'orphaned', 'children', 'include', 'Violet', 'Baudelaire', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Klaus', 'Baudelaire', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'intelligent', 'infant', 'Sunny', 'Baudelaire', 'Kara', 'Hoffman', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'taken', 'parent', 'attorney', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'who', 'played', 'Peter', 'Pettigrew', '2004', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'distant', 'relative', 'named', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'eccentric', 'unpleasant', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'take', 'children', 'inheritance', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'murder', 'get', 'children', 'quickly', 'figure', 'out', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'locked', 'car', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'approaching', 'train', 'children', 'survive', 'thanks', 'own', 'abilities', 'timely', 'arrival', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Unfortunately', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'other', 'adults', 'believe', 'dire', 'warnings', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'attempting', 'kill', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'take', 'children', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'later', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'whom', 'meet', 'tragic', 'ends', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'very', 'close', 'Eventually', 'are', 'returned', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'course', 'help', 'ensure', 'ability', 'obtain', 'children', 'wealth.Upon', 'watching', 'dark', 'film', 'was', 'quickly', 'reminded', '1965', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'film', 'entitled', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'named', 'Donna', 'Peyton', 'Donna', 'Butterworth', 'taken', 'chauffer', 'named', 'Willard', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'visit', '5', '6', 'uncles', 'played', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'sixth', 'uncle', 'named', ""'Bugs"", 'also', 'played', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Donna', 'ransom', 'end', 'Donna', 'must', 'decide', 'whom', 'be', 'legal', 'guardian', 'Similar', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'playing', 'seven', 'characters', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'who', 'be', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'where', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'dark', 'comedy', 'cinematography', 'costuming', 'similar', '1991', 'Addams', 'Family', 'as', 'well', '1995', 'French', 'film', 'City', 'Lost', 'Children', 'a.k.a.', 'La', 'Cit', 'eacute', 'enfants', 'perdus', 'may', 'argue', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'based', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', '1965', 'film', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'books', 'written', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'two', 'significant', 'facts', 'must', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'was', 'born', '1970', 'first', 'books', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'was', 'based', 'upon', 'was', ""n't"", 'published', '1999', 'Hence', 'entirely', 'possible', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'dark', 'children', 'books', 'were', 'inspired', '1965', 'film', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'chose', 'have', 'three', 'orphaned', 'children', 'instead', 'one', 'created', 'single', 'dark', 'character', 'form', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'be', 'cause', 'various', 'unfortunate', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'wardrobe', 'were', 'impressive', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'plot', 'was', 'rather', 'predictable', 'given', 'similarity', '1965', 'film', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'ongoing', 'inability', 'children', 'convince', 'other', 'adults', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'became', 'tiresome', 'Also', 'spite', 'good', 'performances', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'comedic', 'exception', 'Sunny', 'Hence', 'can', 'only', 'rate', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', '2', '5', 'stars', 'Other', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Lemony', 'Snickets', 'voice', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'film', 'one', 'white-faced', 'women', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'who', 'played', 'Paulette', 'Bonafont', 'eacute', '2001', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'was', 'friend', 'Count', 'Olaf']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","I've never read any of the Lemony Snicket series of books, but the basic plot appealed to me far more than the Harry Potter series, if only because it seemed more fresh than the recycled Arthurian-mythos-as-children's tale.  My wife and I dragged our 10-year-old nephew to see it with us as our ""beard"" so people wouldn't wonder if we were some kind of freaks. Not that this stopped us from seeing the Power Puff Girls movie, but I digress.The movie begins with an animated short titled ""The Littlest Elf.""  I thought for a moment I was back watching the beginning of the Incredibles with that awful ""Bound, bound, bound and rebound"" Jackelope idiot.  Fortunately, the movie's narrator, Lemony Snicket (Jude Law), immediately sets things straight.  This is not a movie about a happy little elf.  It is a movie about dreadful things happening to good people.  He encourages us to leave the ""theater, living room, or airplane"" if we do not want to witness such things.I haven't seen a movie actually tell me to leave in a long time.  The reverse psychology works, of course-we did not come to see the Baudelaire children ride off into the sunset.  We came to watch them be challenged and rise above those challenges.To whit, a fire has recently orphaned three wealthy Baudelaire children: 14-year-old Violet (Emily Browning), 12-year-old (?) Klaus (Liam Aiken), and their baby sister Sunny (played by Kara or Shelby Hoffman, twins). Each child has a special power that they use to survive.The movie is something of a cross between League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Adams Family, and the A-Team. For Violet, her ""super power"" is the ability to invent things on the fly.  For Klaus, it's his photographic memory and vast knowledge from reading thousands of books.  And Sunny?  Well, Sunny can bite through practically anything.  A Mini-Jaws, if you will.The Hoffman twins play Sunny with a...well, sunny disposition.  Sunny never seems to get too upset by her situation, as if she knows the joke's on the adults.  Sunny doesn't quite speak, but does make a lot of cooing sounds that are essentially gibberish.  Fortunately for the viewers, we are treated to subtitles of what she's really saying-this clever device keeps the adults amused and often provides levity about what are sometimes decidedly grim situations.Aiken is suitably dour and introverted.  Klaus is the voice of reason, the person who starts screaming ""this is insane!"" when everyone else seems to be going along with the madness.  He's primarily there as a foil for Violet, and in that respect, he does a workman-like job.Browning is the true star of the show.  With her full-lipped pout and wide eyes, she's a teen version of Angelina Jolie.  Violet witnesses some horrible things and finds herself in awful situations, and it's a credit to Browning that she reacts in a believable fashion without whining or preaching.  She rapidly becomes the adult of the family, and it's easy to forget that she's only 14.The children are adopted by their new guardian, Count Olaf (Jim Carey). In general, I'm leery of Jim Carey in franchise movies.  I loved him in Mask, hated him as the Riddler in the Batman series, and absolutely loathed him as the Grinch.  What surprised me is just how perfectly matched Carey is for the part of Olaf.  Olaf is an actor, you see, and when his overt attempts to snatch the children's inheritance fail, he switches to more insidious roles by creating different personalities.  Olaf, backed by his acting troupe of misfits, oozes his way into each new guardian's life and ultimately offs them so he can bring the three orphans back into his clutches.All the annoying Carey-traits are perfectly pitched here, as Olaf lies, sneers, chatters, and calls Sunny a little monkey.  He's so eccentric he can't help himself, except when he is in disguise.  When he's undercover, Olaf disappears and new characters emerge-characters the children can immediately identify as being frauds.  The problem is that the adults are all oblivious to Olaf's scheming, which makes the plight of the children that much more desperate.Olaf could easily become a harmless caricature, but his deeds speak for themselves.  He abandons the children on railroad tracks.  He gives them impossible demands.  And at one point, he SLAPS Klaus.  Once that happened, I started paying attention.  Olaf is cartoony, yes, but he is definitely not harmless.The other guardians are played by Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine and Billy Connolly as Uncle Monte.  Josephine is a neurotic mess, terrified of every appliance in her house, which ultimately turns out to be just as deadly as she warned (shades of Final Destination).  Monte is a herpetologist who has a fondness for all manner of reptiles and amphibians, including three-eyed toads and giant pythons.The director (Brad Silberling) does an excellent job in marinating a child's perspective.  Characters loom above us, lean into the camera, and at other times are distantly off screen, talking but not saying anything of importance.  This is precisely how I remember adults as a child...big, scary, and sometimes not particularly helpful.The movie's score is perfect and the visuals all evoke a dreamy, Tim Burton-esque quality, without the obvious trademarks that make it so Tim Burton-esque.  This is a relief, because Burton's creepy/funny work has started to become a self-parody in its repetitiveness (Big Fish being a big exception).My nephew liked the movie a lot.  Although it condensed three of the books, he said the movie removed a lot of parts that weren't very exciting.  The ending is suitably climactic and uplifting, hinting at a long series that will hopefully live long enough to see the final end of Count Olaf.This movie is not for everybody.  But then, if you're a little quirky and have a tendency to think the worst of people, it may be just the palliative for you.",5,Old and young cynics alike will enjoy it,1104278400,"12 29,

The subject of the first movie in this series are the first three ""Lemony Snicket"" novels.  The movie opens with the Baudelaire children, Violet (Browning), Klaus (Aiken), and Sunny (Hoffman twins), finding out that their parents were killed in a fire that also destroyed their house.  Now, they are being sent to live with their nearest relative, Count Olaf (Carrey).  Unfortunately for them, all Olaf wants is The Baudelaire fortune, and he makes the children's lives a living hell as he works out a scheme to get the money.Jim Carrey plays Count Olaf with a maniacal glee.  His goofyness extends far beyond that of the source material, but that suits Jim Carrey just fine.  The child actors are all excellent in their respective roles, and are about what I imagined when reading the books.  The adaptation is a bit jumbled for the movie's sake, but works fairly well.  There are also ""additions"" to the movie that are not in the first three books, and one has to wonder if they were let in on some future secrets of the novel series or if the director was just filling in the story points with items of his own choosing.""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is an entertaining family movie that can be enjoyed by all.

886647,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0007PICAI,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[5, 5]","Adapting a series of what one would consider the modern equivalent of classic literary novels to the big screen can be quite a tough assignment even for the best in the movie business, especially for those little known directors or those with limited experience. But, if done properly, this can pay tremendous dividends for both the studio releasing the film and the director himself. For the studio, by hiring a lesser known director they save money on an already colossal production budget and receive huge profits upon its success in theaters. The director, on the other hand, will undoubtedly be hit with offers both left and right once he decides to move on to his next project, leading to a substantial increase in his salary. Everyone wins! So Brad Silberling, whose past theatrical experiences have sadly been limited to Caspar the Movie, City of Angels, and Moonlight Mile, had to have been happy with the news that he would now head the feature film adaptation of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events after Barry Sonnenfeld left due to the project's budget concerns. Already the project has successfully dodged a ""Wild, Wild West""-style bullet and looks scott-free from here!The story follows three recently orphaned children as they attempt to outrun and outwit their diabolical uncle who unabated desire for their family's inheritance will go to any lengths to have them removed permanently from achieving his goal. Violet, the oldest of the three Baudelire children, is a brilliant fast-thinker and invents things out of anything she can possibly find around the house. Klaus, the middle child and only boy of the family, is extremely intelligent and memorizes everything he reads in the dozen of books within the library of their family's mansion. Sunny, the infant child, has a tendency to bite and speaks only in unintelligent garble that only her two other siblings can understand. Due to an unforeseen unfortunate event which engulfs the family mansion in flames and takes the lives of their parents, the three Baudelire children - now the three Baudelire orphans - are sent to live with their distant relative, the cunning and dastardly Count Olaf, an untalented actor who wants to snatch the children's inheritance and use it for his devious purposes. Being found a negligent guardian after allowing the youngest child to sit in the driver seat of his car, though in all honesty this was all part of an elaborate attempt to have them run over by a train, they are then sent to live with Uncle Montgomery Montgomery, a professor in herpetology. After a strange lab assistant murders the professor mysterious during the night, the Baudelire orphans are sent to live with their grammar-wise Aunt Josephine, a widow who has lived in utter fear of practically everything after her husband was eaten alive years ago by fleshing-eating leeches. They find themselves once again in the possession of the evil Count Olaf after their far-distant aunt meets an untimely fate with the flesh-eating leeches of the lake and they must use their specific talents to defeat him before achieving his plan of marrying young Violet in yet another shrewd attempt to steal their inheritance.The story for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a practically flawless presentation of some of the most cultivated content, though still stylized enough to be categorized as a family-oriented feature, aimed for the pre-teenage set this side of the Harry Potter fantasy universe. Even with that in mind, that material is still enriching enough to spark a certain amount of constructive debate among its desired audience base. All of this is assured of course given that you are not one of the crazed novel enthusiasts who howl and moan every time a mere sentence is altered from the text. It is always more appropriate that you go into these sorts of films without any prior knowledge of the previously released texts as this sort of thing can only lead to nick-picking, a terrible and annoying habit which ruins the viewing experience for everyone involved - those members of the Harry Potter, and to a lesser extent The Lord of the Rings, sects know exactly what this means.As was the case with Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, there will undoubtedly be critics of Jim Carrey's amplified antics in the role of the villainous Count Olaf, no more so then from the fanatic fan-base of the literary series, clamoring that his interpretation of the character offset his truly monstrous nature and intentions as the novels indicate. Yes, Carrey does give about an amusing quality to Count Olaf, or maybe that is only do to the workings of the young orphans against him that we find so entertaining. In either case, crucial scenes such as the one where he is show slapping Klaus for speaking up against him in front of his acting troupe demonstrates the character's truly malevolent nature which must be despised and scorned rather then mock. This becomes even more evident when children take into account the idea that Count Olaf is attempting to kill his own relatives - no matter how distant - for his own profitable gain. Meryl Streep, an Academy-Award wining performer entirely unfamiliar with the realm of family-oriented productions such as this, takes to the role like a total natural with no question to her magic implored in the role of Aunt Josephine. And what is more is that she does this without having to be as drunk as a skunk as she was at the recent Golden Globes ceremony - Alright, that was not exactly an evaluation of her performance but rather a well deserved jab that has been in quite seclusion for quite some time waiting for the appropriate moment to be let loose. Jude Law, who without question has become the Colin Farrell of 2004 after appearing in what would seem like twenty films this year alone, gives to the narrator of Lemony Snicket a composed, mystifying, and regularly witty voice that could not have been delivered as respectively as he does here.If there is one distressing piece of criticism to be named concerning A Series of Unfortunate Events it would definitively have to be its rather prevalent list of redundant cameos. Was it truly imperative for the filmmakers to cast Cedric the Entertainer, a comedian whose past work few children within the picture's desirable age range would know anything about, in the role of the extraneous detective investigating the sudden death of Uncle Monty? Granted, the feature's intentions are for it to appear as a family picture set against the realm of fantasy and make-believe but his entire approach to the character, merely a toned-down version of his usual - for a lesser word - comical stick, seems offsetting to the rest of the film. What is to be said about Dustin Hoffman's brief appearance? True, his introduction as the critic attending Count Olaf's latest theatrical ""masterpiece"" is a bit amusing to say the least but it grows tiresome fast and is purely a waste of rich talent and covetable screen time. Veracious cinematic minds shaking their heads in utter disbelief that man behind Tootsie would stoop so low as to make a disastrous cameo need not fret, he does not receive credit for it. And last, and certainly in this case least of all, here is the most disgraceful display of overzealous product placement in recent cinematic memory, or at the very least since the last Adam Sandler picture. Gilbert Gottfried receives credit - how is it that he says one simple word and receives credit while Hoffman states a few lines and appropriates nothing - for his voice-over work as the AFLAC duck which makes a momentary appearance in the film, though to be true that is all too much to begin with. Had it not been for this careless list of cameo disasters then casting would have been practically perfect in every conceivable way possible - and did that just come off as too Mary Poppin-ish?Overall, though literary zealots may whimper and wail over the very thought of even the tiniest aspect of the franchise changing in this feature film adaptation, what to them may seem like a series of unfortunate events might, in fact, be the first steps of an even greater and more whimsical franchise ahead. One of the most marvelous aspects this film manages to present successfully to its audience is its ability to not only entertain but inform as well, not merely through a monotonous series of long-winded speeches but a variety of operations that, no matter how exaggerated they may be, reflect upon experiences in our own lives. The young children who are anticipated to be A Series of Unfortunate Events' core audience this holiday season are at quite a vulnerable age, standing at what some would consider ""the water's edge"". Slowly but surely they are beginning to mature into free-thinking and conscious adults and admirable members of society, or as close as they can be depending on the behavior of one's own family. Though it is suppose to be the direct responsibility of the parents to instill in their children lessons to assimilate throughout life, it certainly does not hurt to have popular culture such as films like this expand on their teachings. The most sensational thing pertaining to the characters of this film is that they teach us that even the best of individuals have their own little quirks about them but, despite these seeming strange to us, they do not change the natural good inside them that they have already demonstrated. In fact, they may even make them better individuals. Another lesson too many children in this world learn all too late in this life is that the world is not always a happy and fair place and events do not always work out in the way we would want them to. Those that raise their children with the hippie-dippy view of society, that being that all men and women no matter how evil they may seem have a source of good in them, should be jailed for child neglect. What a horrible and ignorant way to propagate their minds like that! But Lemony Snicket's most decisive lesson taught within the course of this film is that no matter where you are or how dire the situation may be, as long as you are surrounded by friends and family, you are never truly far from your home. Quite simply, this is the best family film this holiday season and will sure to go down as one of top ten family features of the year.",4,The Moose Hole - A Truly Fortunate Experience,1103587200,"12

Miller,"[4, 9]","Well, I always like to start with a little honesty so let me tell you I have not read the books so this review will not focus on adaptation of books to movie (now to continue).This movie is about three kids who unfortunately lose their parents, fortunately go to their Uncle Olaf's, unfortunately find out he's evil, and then attempt to find their niche of happiness all the while encountering crazy adventures.Now, I believe that the acting was very good.  I especially like the acting of the character's that played the two kids (Emma Browning and Liam Aiken.)  In addition, I thought it was interesting how a few of the other characters were played by fairly big names such as Meryl Streep.  Jim Carrey did a good job too as Count Olaf, yet it is hard for me to see him as playing a bad guy(s) (not the Grinch that is).Now, my problem with the movie isn't as much as movie issue as it is the story.  First, this is a movie really about nothing but a series of unfortunate events.  There is a stab at smart wit when trying to show that kids are intelligent, but that was but a brief moment in time.  Also, the story is a bit too fantastical, even for this kind of story.  Now I am sure my real fault would be with the books, however I wouldn't like the movie if I didn't like the books now would I (which admittedly again I haven't read.)  I mean there is no way that Olaf would have as much success as he did.The story is just dumbed down, yet that is what it is supposed to be fighting against.  Lastly too, I found Sonny (the baby) annoying her ""talking"" wasn't really that funny.However, it was a well-done movie and I have to give it credit for that, yet the story is still a problem.

Trying to read between the lines is like looking for substance and texture on the set of Jerry Springer.  Ain't gonna happen, so get over it.

Over-the-top at times, that is what Jim Carey brings to any movie.  Love or hate?  You decide.  I watched it with my kids at the theater and now at home on DVD and we love it for what it is, just a fun little movie.  Is Harry Potter the modern day equivalent of The Dead Sea Scolls?  No.  So why do people insist on looking for things that aren't there or will never be there.  Once in a while, you just have to relax and like something for what it is.

And, for anyone unfamiliar with the books, the implausibility of it all, coupled with its really quite disturbing undertones, is a major problem. Is this a seriously distorted adult's view of children or an unnecessarily frightening child's view of adults? And, on either level, what is going on here?So that's the bad news... and the good news? Everything else about the film is stunningly brilliant. The cinema photography, set design and production are quite incredible, recreating a visually distorted world in such detail and scale that it's up there with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" as one of the best examples of gothic cinema ever made. The acting is exceptional, with Jim Carrey delivering a series of wonderfully executed, superbly ""evil"", and extremely funny cameos, and with the two teenagers contributing quite outstanding performances. And, the whole ""feel"" of the film, from its opening ""this ain't where you think you are"" cartoon sequence to its beautifully executed end titles - so good that they're a work of art in their own right - is extremely clever and tightly controlled.Difficult to take-in first time around because of the uncomfortable implications of the plot, this is a film that deserves and rewards repeat viewing so that the incredible richness of what's on offer can be fully appreciated.

886656,A3713PP4MADKED,B0007PICAI,"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins""","[3, 3]","Let me start this by saying I have not read the ""Series of Unfortunate Events"" books, nor do I know anyone I am close to that has. That said, I knew nothing more about this movie than what was shown in the trailers. But it sure did look entertaining, which is why last night a couple of friends and I went and saw this.The movie starts off cheery and happy-only for you to realize it's a clever way to open up what is in reality a darker film. You would get the idea that this is a children's film, and it kind of us. Not much violence (if any at all), no cursing that I can remember, etc. However, this is a pretty dark movie, like a dark comedy. I guess the title Dark Children's Movie is fitting for anything. But don't get the idea the kids won't like this. The theater was pretty kid-dominant, and all the kids seemed to enjoy it for the most part.The plot if pretty simple: Three children's parents were killed in a fire, but these parents were extremely wealthy. So the children had to be given to their closest relative...this relative being the menacing Count Olaf, played to zany perfection by Jim Carrey. He doesn't want the children thought-he wants their fortune. They defy his first plan and are taken into custody by their next closest relative, but Olaf simply refuses to be stopped. He wants that fortune. He uses an arsenal of disguises to try and take the children back...but if you want to know any more, go see the movie.Some might think the movies awkward, and it is.

Most movies fall short of the greatness of their paperbound predecessors.  The Lemony Snicket books, sadly, are no different.I'm sure you've all heard the similarities of Snicket to Dahl and I certainly wouldn't be one to disagree.  The problem is the book was dealt the same blow that Willy Wonka was to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  The book is changed from a dark and brooding tale to a slightly comedic romp that winks at darkness.Mostly the fault would lay with Carrey.  He would make a fine hammy rubber faced man, and often does when it is called, but for the murdering dastardly Olaf I feel he missed a few notes.  Olaf is clearly sinister and Carrey just makes him almost a mockery of Ace Ventura with a unibrow.The strong suits of this movie are the children.  They fit into their roles like a dream.  Sadly they'll be much too old for a franchise due to the fact the books hardly age to proper cinematic time as, say, the Harry Potter series.  The other aspect that I would recommend this for are the sets.  One couldn't imagine the world Snicket describes more perfectly.So the movies make light of a wonderfully morbid series and it's shortcomings overtake it's brillance.My recommendation would be that the legnth and subject of the books would have made better for a brilliant set of hour long TV miniseries (one hour per book) because unlike Willy Wonka versus Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the Snicket books will long outlive the movie.",2,Lemony leaves a slightly sour taste,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,1550,"['Being', 'avid', 'reader', ""'m"", 'always', 'intrigued', 'how', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'movie', 'Most', 'movies', 'fall', 'short', 'greatness', 'paperbound', 'predecessors', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'books', 'sadly', 'are', 'different.I', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'similarities', 'Snicket', 'Dahl', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'disagree', 'problem', 'book', 'was', 'dealt', 'same', 'blow', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'book', 'changed', 'dark', 'brooding', 'tale', 'slightly', 'comedic', 'romp', 'darkness.Mostly', 'fault', 'would', 'lay', 'Carrey', 'would', 'make', 'fine', 'hammy', 'rubber', 'faced', 'man', 'often', 'when', 'called', 'murdering', 'dastardly', 'Olaf', 'feel', 'missed', 'few', 'notes', 'Olaf', 'clearly', 'sinister', 'Carrey', 'just', 'almost', 'mockery', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'unibrow.The', 'strong', 'suits', 'movie', 'are', 'children', 'fit', 'roles', 'dream', 'Sadly', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'franchise', 'due', 'fact', 'books', 'hardly', 'age', 'proper', 'cinematic', 'time', 'say', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'other', 'aspect', 'would', 'recommend', 'are', 'sets', 'One', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'world', 'Snicket', 'more', 'movies', 'make', 'light', 'wonderfully', 'morbid', 'series', 'shortcomings', 'overtake', 'brillance.My', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'legnth', 'subject', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'brilliant', 'set', 'hour', 'long', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'one', 'hour', 'book', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'versus', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Snicket', 'books', 'will', 'long', 'outlive', 'movie']",N/A

I think Jim Carey is great, the soundtrack sets the tone of the film and the cinematography, costumes and make-up are well-done.  I am a big fan of Disney productions, however.  I feel this film could learn a few things from Disney, as it was lacking in areas that could have been done better.  The child actors were all very good, however the script was written in such a way that did not allow them to really connect with the viewer or one another.  The storyline was warped and taken out of context from the books.  That was disappointing.  This is supposed to be a film for kids, but came across as being more of a film for teenagers and teenage angst.  I hope that, if there are future productions of Lemony Snicket, the directors will allow the personalities of the children to come to the forefront.  Let them become characters the audience can care about.One of the reasons this film did not do as well as it could have (and the same with Nannie McPhee) is due to the editing and the director's decisions to cut back on the run time of the film.  I feel this is a mistake.  If a film is 20 minutes longer by doing an effective job of connecting the viewers to the actors, we might be interested enough to see the movie more than just once.  Directors sink thousands of dollars into making films like this.  So, it would be nice if they take into consideration, the film could become a classic with a little more care to detail.

Fucito ""fabfriday""","[4, 7]","If you are looking for a very happy review, one that bestows the ultimate accolades on this film, I suggest you turn off your PC now, as this is not one of those reviews.....Before I get into the overall review of the film vs the books, keep in mind that as a stand-alone film, the movie is very good. As the first movie adaptation for this popular book series, there are some issues (and in saying ""issues"" I mean ""what the heck were those crazy screenwriters thinking rewriting such a great story in the first place?"")Jim Carey as Count Olaf has to be one of the best casting choices ever. Carey IS Count Olaf in every sense of the word. He captures the sinister character brilliantly, and the make-up is spot on with the books renderings. In fact, the children and the bulk of the cast are all very good choices, mirroring the books very closely.The music is outstanding and the imagery of the film looks like a joint-project between the late Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Olaf's tower, the Reptile Room, and the house along the lake come to life in vivid detail (and when I say ""vivid"" I mean ""holy cow this looks even cooler than I could've pictured it when reading it""). The closing credit animation is also worth watching as it is fantastic (again, think Edward Gorey).This movie would've been almost perfect, had I not read the first three books. Here is why I can not give it 5 stars. The books, written as they are, are perfectly suited to a screenplay with no real changes needed.Why they decided to chop up the first book, drop the wedding play (only to appear at the end of the film randomly), segue into a rail crossing segment that never existed in the books, mess around with the second story somewhat, and throw in a completely unrelated ""spy glass"" plot and secret society of people investigating arsons (to which the parents, uncle, and aunt were all part of) is beyond me. Throwing the wedding play from the first book into the film's end, again changed considerably (Olaf tells Violet to sign with her correct hand, and Klaus saves the day by burning up the certificate with a magic eye prism from Olaf's tower before the crowd) ruins the flow of the film, and will annoy loyal readers. Not too mention, the happy ending of this film, which tops a series of unfortuneate story changes in my opinion. Now, I have yet to read beyond the first 3 books, so maybe by book 11, the ending is happy. But it is quite out of place in the context of this film.So, if you watch the film ignoring (or having not read) the original storyline, it is a very enjoyable film (and by ""enjoyable"" I mean you'd much rather watch this film than finish your vegatables). If you are expecting the film to follow the books, you may find a bit of the film annoying and inaccurate.",3,Not Quite The Same As The Books......,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2774,"['are', 'looking', 'very', 'happy', 'review', 'one', 'ultimate', 'accolades', 'film', 'suggest', 'turn', 'off', 'PC', 'now', 'not', 'one', 'reviews', '..Before', 'get', 'overall', 'review', 'film', 'vs', 'books', 'keep', 'mind', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'are', 'issues', 'saying', 'issues', 'mean', 'what', 'heck', 'were', 'crazy', 'screenwriters', 'thinking', 'rewriting', 'such', 'great', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'casting', 'choices', 'ever', 'Carey', 'IS', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'sense', 'word', 'sinister', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'make-up', 'spot', 'books', 'renderings', 'fact', 'children', 'bulk', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'choices', 'mirroring', 'books', 'very', 'closely.The', 'music', 'outstanding', 'imagery', 'film', 'joint-project', 'late', 'Edward', 'Gorey', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Olaf', 'tower', 'Reptile', 'Room', 'house', 'lake', 'come', 'life', 'vivid', 'detail', 'when', 'say', 'vivid', 'mean', 'holy', 'cow', 'even', 'cooler', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pictured', 'when', 'reading', 'closing', 'credit', 'animation', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'again', 'think', 'Edward', 'Gorey', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'almost', 'perfect', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'Here', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'books', 'written', 'are', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'screenplay', 'real', 'changes', 'needed.Why', 'decided', 'chop', 'up', 'first', 'book', 'drop', 'wedding', 'play', 'only', 'appear', 'end', 'film', 'randomly', 'segue', 'rail', 'crossing', 'segment', 'never', 'existed', 'books', 'mess', 'second', 'story', 'somewhat', 'throw', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'spy', 'glass', 'plot', 'secret', 'society', 'people', 'investigating', 'arsons', 'parents', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'were', 'part', 'Throwing', 'wedding', 'play', 'first', 'book', 'film', 'end', 'again', 'changed', 'considerably', 'Olaf', 'Violet', 'sign', 'correct', 'hand', 'Klaus', 'day', 'burning', 'up', 'certificate', 'magic', 'eye', 'prism', 'Olaf', 'tower', 'crowd', 'flow', 'film', 'will', 'annoy', 'loyal', 'readers', 'Not', 'too', 'mention', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'series', 'unfortuneate', 'story', 'changes', 'opinion', 'Now', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'first', '3', 'books', 'so', 'maybe', 'book', '11', 'ending', 'happy', 'quite', 'place', 'context', 'film.So', 'watch', 'film', 'ignoring', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'storyline', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'mean', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'film', 'finish', 'vegatables', 'are', 'expecting', 'film', 'follow', 'books', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'film', 'annoying', 'inaccurate']",N/A

886666,A33XHXRTRZOQ12,B0007PICAI,"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man""","[1, 2]","Not being of school age, I haven't read the Lemony Snicket books upon which this movie is based, but I can tell you, there's a definite ""literary"" quality to the production. This whole movie, especially the artful, kabuki-like credits, looks like a PBS or BBC production, rather than something Dreamworks or Nickelodeon would come up with. The three children, the two older ones, Klaus and Violet, being played by Liam Aiken and Emily Browning, are subjected to one gawd-awful catastrophe after another: First their house burns down, taking their picture-perfect parents with it, thus orphaning them; then they're taken by the harmless, if somewhat clueless, Mr. Poe, their parents' banker, to their purported kinsman, Count Olaf, who wants nothing less than to do away with the children and keep their parent's substantial stipend for himself.Jim Carrey portrays Count Olaf as only Jim Carrey can: over the top, cartoonish and funnier than blazes. His every nuance provokes a chuckle, as when he tells the children, (as he's driving them to his first attempt to kill them,) that he wants to be ""the ULLLLL-timate dad!"", or when, disguised as Captain Sham, an archetypical ""old salt"" sea captain, he makes an oath by his stubby peg leg, which he comically lifts up for all to witness.Another great point about this movie is the incredible art direction, which somehow manages to make you believe that it's set at the turn of the last century or thereabouts, though, by observing most details, it's obviously set in at least the early sixties. Every detail is sweated, as in Violet's inventions, Olaf's ramshackle abode, Aunt Josephine's, (Meryl Streep, playing a neurotic bundle of nerves,) precariously situated house, (which is ALSO ramshackle,) and the old Czechoslovakian Tetra automobile, (a model as rare as hen's teeth in the West,) for Mr. Poe, the banker/caretaker that refuses to acknowledge that the nefarious Count Olaf is out to kill the kids.The big scene-stealing character in this film is the adorable little Sunny, the youngest of the Boudelaire children. This is a toddler, just barely out of diapers, whose every unintelligible utterance is given clever, hip subtitles, usually put-downs, making fun of the scary adults the kids are subjected to.Billy Connolly plays the one relatively sane guardian Poe finds for them, Uncle Monty Montgomery, (and even HE has flaws, considering that his house is overrun with dangerous reptiles and snakes). After endearing himself almost immediately to the children, he, like squirrelly Aunt Josephine, meets an untimely end at the hands of Count Olaf. Look out for Jennifer Coolidge and Craig Ferguson as members of Olaf's acting troupe.All in all, I'm really surprised that this cute little movie didn't do better at the box office.

I rarely gush and scream about how something is the best ever, but here I can make an exception!It surprises me how many people wrote about not enjoying this movie! It was and still is a great favorite of mine.Some fans of the book may be skeptical and ask such questions as...""DOes the movie follow the books?""""HOw could Jim Carrey pull off a roll like COunt OLaf?""or ""Is it good for kids?""First of all, some fans may be disappointed that the movie does not follow the books to the greatest detail. HOwever, I have seen much worse (disney, ect...). THough not identical to the books we know and love, the movie carries itself well and stays true to the overall plot and feel of the tale. SOme have objected to the placement of the ""Marvelous Marriage"" at the end of the film, as well as the addition of the train sequence, however, I think this made the story even better and I can find no fault in it.Next, how could a comedian like Jim Carry pull off a role like count olaf? I myself was skeptical at first, yet my fears were quickly abaited. Carry provides, what I believe, was his best performance in this book and not only gives us a stunning and diabolical-as-ever olaf, but the equally memorable characters of ""Stephano"" and ""Captain SHam"". If you have any sense of humor and come to this movie with a fairly clean slate, you will be on the floor rolling in peels of laughter. His humor is not out of place and adds even more to the story.Finally, ""IS this a kids movie?""WEll, let me say this. IF you let your kids read the books, this movie should be no problem. THere are a few mildly tense moments, though there is nothing terrible here. As the story demands, there are deaths, however, all violence is taken care of off screne and children will not even be haunted by screams. I suggested as a possible age to start at being around seven or eight. It's not as bad as some have made it sound!OVerall, this is an excellent movie to watch and own. Very funny, with a great lesson. Very entertaining!p.s. if you are looking for more laughs, try the outtakes (particularly ""Olaf's workshop""). ALso, the commentary is excellent!

It appeared to be dark and brooding and sinister in the beginning, but turned out to be a film that almost fell into the same trappings as the ill-fated Cat in the Hat movie that attempts to capture the Harry Potter crowd!  The movie could have used Tim Burton to provide the larger than life characters if that was the film's intentions.On the other hand, the great thing about this film was the significance of the young characters, Viola, Klaus, and Sunny.  They are left as orphans after their parents die from a house fire, and are forced to live with relatives that aren't even true-blooded relatives, such as Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly ), and Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep).  Jude Law narrates the film, and his image appears as a silhouette throughout the film.  Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall)and Catherine O'Hara (Justice Strauss) are the unusual law-abiding characters in the film.  But the main characters are the children, and how they overcome their misfortunes. They continually have to escape Count Olaf in order to find suited a guardian.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a delightful film that young viewers will find enticing and enjoyable to watch because of its adventurous and mysterious nature.  The film appears to promote knowledge and intelligence -- or the so-called Kantian mantra that knowledge is power.  Through each predicament that the children encounter, they are able to use the education they received from reading books!  However, the film lacks completeness.  There are holes in the plot that readers of the book will most likely notice, and for moviegoers, particular scenes do not provide a full explanation.",3,Adventurous Film at Best,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,1751,"['Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch', 'appeared', 'be', 'dark', 'brooding', 'sinister', 'beginning', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'almost', 'fell', 'same', 'trappings', 'ill-fated', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'movie', 'capture', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'crowd', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'provide', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'was', 'film', 'intentions.On', 'other', 'hand', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'significance', 'young', 'characters', 'Viola', 'Klaus', 'Sunny', 'are', 'left', 'orphans', 'parents', 'die', 'house', 'fire', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'relatives', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'true-blooded', 'relatives', 'such', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jude', 'Law', 'film', 'image', 'silhouette', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Justice', 'Strauss', 'are', 'unusual', 'law-abiding', 'characters', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'children', 'how', 'overcome', 'misfortunes', 'continually', 'have', 'escape', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'order', 'find', 'suited', 'guardian.Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'delightful', 'film', 'young', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'enticing', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'adventurous', 'mysterious', 'nature', 'film', 'promote', 'knowledge', 'intelligence', 'so-called', 'Kantian', 'mantra', 'knowledge', 'power', 'predicament', 'children', 'encounter', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'education', 'received', 'reading', 'books', 'However', 'film', 'completeness', 'are', 'holes', 'plot', 'readers', 'book', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'notice', 'moviegoers', 'particular', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'full', 'explanation']",N/A
886672,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0007PICAI,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 4]","From an artistic point of view, Lemon Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events contains surreal landscapes to die for and bookshelves to drive any bibliomaniac half mad. In fact, this movie seems to be mostly about madness, the reason you should read everything you can (just incase you get stuck in a dangerous situation) and survival in a cruel world. The sets should be morbid, but I found them to be darkly beautiful. This reminded me of places I traveled to in my mind as a child while reading fairytales.As in many of our favorite fairytales, the children are orphaned or have lost one of their parents to the evil clutches of death. While terrifyingly tragic, the children don't seem to show immediate and outwardly apparent remorse. When their parents die in the fire they are at a beach and then wander around in the charred ruins in a state of shock. Later, they again appear in the rebuilt home, but as the CGI experts fade the house into the reality, the dark ruins are strangely more beautiful than the original house.This adventure begins ""OH so innocently"" with a little elf and then turns into a lighthearted dark comedy where three children must face an unending series of aunts and uncles who are frankly, quite mad. Meryl Streep is delightful as Aunt Josephine in her rickety house on the edge of a cliff. I loved the huge window looking out to sea and the storm, not to mention the adventurous elements of surviving an entire house falling off a cliff.Count Olaf is creepy and subtly terrifying in all his disguises. The director and script writers seem to be playing right into a number of ominous childhood fears and insecurities.I was a little more than disturbed by the marriage scene but I realize this is a definite fear of women and girls the world over. In some countries, very young girls are still ""sold into"" marriage slavery. I think they could have found some other way to put Violet in jeopardy and I felt very uncomfortable with this scene. I was also uncomfortable with one of the comments Sunny made because it as definitely inappropriate for a baby to say, although definitely adult humor.Some of the adults in this movie also have a ""leering"" quality that is especially disturbing. You are left with the impression that no one in the Baudelaire family is safe. Even the somewhat nave Uncle Monty's home is filled with snakes.Throughout the movie Count Olaf attempts to gain the Baudelaire fortune through disguises and outright insult. His motivations are completely selfish all while he attempts to portray himself as selfless.The most interesting part of this movie is how Klaus uses his knowledge, Violet uses her ingenuity to solve complex emergencies especially when trains are heading straight towards the car or she must face falling into an ocean vs. escaping out of a tumbling mansion.Even Jim Carrey's over-the-top dinosaur interpretation is no match for the delightful Sunny as she playfully giggles with the ""deadly"" CGI viper or gives witty comments in baby speak and subtitles interpret her adorable repartee on various subjects. She steals the show and brings a bright optimism to the story.Strangely enough, the funniest part of the movie seems to be when Lemony Snicket explains how you can escape watching this movie by walking out of the theatre or airplane. Jude Law's voice is especially calming and he seems to tell the story with a hint of emotional involvement. The script is surprisingly good and very witty in places.What is even stranger is that the first few times I tried to watch this movie, I feel into a trance like sleep. On the third viewing I was able to keep from being totally hypnotized by the calming music. Definitely a movie you want on hand if you suffer from insomnia or you may just want to order the soundtrack. The movie isn't boring, the music is just like a lullaby.It is quite possible to love and hate elements of this movie all at the same time. I mostly loved the surreal Salvador Dali style landscapes (like Swans Reflecting)and the mostly high-quality script that constantly awakened the darker side of my humor. Not for young children because the morbid elements could give them nightmares. Even I had a few less than pleasant nightmares after watching this movie.~The Rebecca Review",4,Surreal Landscapes and Bookshelves,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,4277,"['artistic', 'point', 'view', 'Lemon', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'surreal', 'landscapes', 'die', 'bookshelves', 'drive', 'bibliomaniac', 'half', 'mad', 'fact', 'movie', 'be', 'mostly', 'madness', 'reason', 'should', 'read', 'everything', 'can', 'just', 'incase', 'get', 'stuck', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'survival', 'cruel', 'world', 'sets', 'should', 'be', 'morbid', 'found', 'be', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'reminded', 'places', 'traveled', 'mind', 'child', 'reading', 'fairytales.As', 'many', 'favorite', 'fairytales', 'children', 'are', 'orphaned', 'have', 'lost', 'one', 'parents', 'evil', 'clutches', 'death', 'terrifyingly', 'tragic', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'show', 'immediate', 'outwardly', 'apparent', 'remorse', 'When', 'parents', 'die', 'fire', 'are', 'beach', 'then', 'wander', 'around', 'charred', 'ruins', 'state', 'shock', 'Later', 'again', 'appear', 'rebuilt', 'home', 'CGI', 'experts', 'fade', 'house', 'reality', 'dark', 'ruins', 'are', 'strangely', 'more', 'beautiful', 'original', 'house.This', 'adventure', 'OH', 'so', 'innocently', 'little', 'elf', 'then', 'lighthearted', 'dark', 'comedy', 'where', 'three', 'children', 'must', 'face', 'unending', 'series', 'aunts', 'uncles', 'who', 'are', 'frankly', 'quite', 'mad', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'delightful', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'rickety', 'house', 'edge', 'cliff', 'loved', 'huge', 'window', 'looking', 'out', 'sea', 'storm', 'not', 'mention', 'adventurous', 'elements', 'surviving', 'entire', 'house', 'falling', 'off', 'cliff.Count', 'Olaf', 'creepy', 'subtly', 'terrifying', 'disguises', 'director', 'script', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'playing', 'right', 'number', 'ominous', 'childhood', 'fears', 'insecurities.I', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'disturbed', 'marriage', 'scene', 'realize', 'definite', 'fear', 'women', 'girls', 'world', 'countries', 'very', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'still', 'sold', 'marriage', 'slavery', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'Violet', 'jeopardy', 'felt', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'comments', 'Sunny', 'made', 'because', 'definitely', 'inappropriate', 'baby', 'say', 'definitely', 'adult', 'humor.Some', 'adults', 'movie', 'also', 'have', 'leering', 'quality', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'are', 'left', 'impression', 'one', 'Baudelaire', 'family', 'safe', 'Even', 'somewhat', 'nave', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'home', 'filled', 'snakes.Throughout', 'movie', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'attempts', 'gain', 'Baudelaire', 'fortune', 'disguises', 'outright', 'insult', 'motivations', 'are', 'completely', 'selfish', 'portray', 'selfless.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'how', 'Klaus', 'knowledge', 'Violet', 'ingenuity', 'solve', 'complex', 'emergencies', 'especially', 'when', 'trains', 'are', 'heading', 'straight', 'towards', 'car', 'must', 'face', 'falling', 'ocean', 'vs.', 'escaping', 'tumbling', 'mansion.Even', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'over-the-top', 'dinosaur', 'interpretation', 'match', 'delightful', 'Sunny', 'playfully', 'deadly', 'CGI', 'viper', 'witty', 'comments', 'baby', 'speak', 'subtitles', 'interpret', 'adorable', 'repartee', 'various', 'subjects', 'steals', 'show', 'bright', 'optimism', 'story.Strangely', 'enough', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'when', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'how', 'can', 'escape', 'watching', 'movie', 'walking', 'theatre', 'airplane', 'Jude', 'Law', 'voice', 'especially', 'calming', 'tell', 'story', 'hint', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'very', 'witty', 'places.What', 'even', 'stranger', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'tried', 'watch', 'movie', 'feel', 'trance', 'sleep', 'third', 'viewing', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'being', 'totally', 'hypnotized', 'calming', 'music', 'Definitely', 'movie', 'want', 'hand', 'suffer', 'insomnia', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'order', 'soundtrack', 'movie', ""n't"", 'boring', 'music', 'just', 'lullaby.It', 'quite', 'possible', 'love', 'hate', 'elements', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'mostly', 'loved', 'surreal', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'style', 'landscapes', 'Swans', 'Reflecting', 'mostly', 'high-quality', 'script', 'constantly', 'awakened', 'darker', 'side', 'humor', 'Not', 'young', 'children', 'morbid', 'elements', 'could', 'give', 'nightmares', 'Even', 'had', 'few', 'less', 'pleasant', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'movie.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
886673,ANUBY6KOT60WH,B0007PICAI,R. Galeano Valencia,"[4, 5]","For us, parents, used to the plain, simplistic and absolutely predictable (thus sometimes boring) moral code of the traditional children movies' storylines (as depicted for example in the Disney flicks pre-1995) this movie comes out as a true blessing. I have to admit that at the movie theater I was actually, shocked. Not only for how visually stunning this movie is, but mostly from not knowing if my 7 & 6 years old would be able to process the story. Afterwards -and I have to say for my surprise- I found out that my kids not only fairly well understood the nature of the drama that serves as the basement for the funny moments of the movie, but also began to ask interesting questions. Questions that in turn helped us as parents to openly talk about things that are not commonly discussed with 6 & 7 years old. I  found out that the movie turned out to be a great opportunity for education about some dark, yet undeniable facts of life: evil, greed, not-trustable adults, indifference... And also about things that can help us overcome difficult situations: love, family, strength of character, companionship, trust in your own capacities and putting them to the service of those you love, logical reasoning, intelligence...The Baudelaire children are three siblings that after tragically loosing their parents  happen to land in the hands of an evil relative (Count Olaf) who couldn't care less about the children's well-being and whose only real interest is to control the children's money. The Baudelaire kids despite their youth, come across surprisingly mature, realizing their real (and I would say even traumatic) situation and trying to overcome it in the best possible way by relying on each other and trusting in their own capacities and abilities. Not letting themselves down by all the nasty things that Count Olaf -and life in general- puts them through and learning how to defend themselves in order to survive.Some reviewers say that the books are way better than the movie. I haven't read any of the Lemony Snicket books yet. But IMO this is a great parent-children sort of movie.

A lot of interest angles to exploit and produce great lesson-sharing moments and talks. I highly recommend it.For those parents who disregard this movie as being too traumatic, or too ""heavy"", let me give you a word of advise: remember that in these days our post-modern society kids are constantly bombarded and exposed to visually stunning content (videogames, television, books, you name it)... Plus they get to live in a highly violent and aggressive sort of society. Thus for these visually ""advanced"" kids, living in an environment far from perfect, we parents need graphically attractive educational media and materials, with poignant and interesting stories that catch the attention of the young mind. Once this products come across, we concerned parents can magically appear and make a great educational moment out of virtually everything.

886677,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007PICAI,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","This is one of the more disappointing movies that I have seen in quite a while.  Although there were some good supporting performers and some marvelous sets, it was marred as a whole by a wretched set of performances by Jim Carrey and a poor set up at the beginning of the film to let us get to know and like the three children playing the Baudelaire orphans.  The movie starts off pretty much with the premise that we are going to like the children without actually having done anything to establish that in reality.  I found myself at the beginning disliking the possible fate of the children, but as things went along, we got no real opportunity to get to know them, or consequently to like them.  Halfway through the movie I was reduced to a complete state of I-just-don't-care-what-happens-next.I used really to like Jim Carrey as an actor.  His almost superhuman physical flexibility and supreme goofiness seemed to suit him for a host of roles, and he has enough acting ability to more or less support his attempts at more serious acting.  But his Count Olaf comes across more than anything as a gigantic clown, and the fear one feels of him is similar to the way some children react to painted comedians.  As I said, I used to have a great deal of liking for Carrey, but this film combined with other performances such as THE MAJESTIC and THE GRINCH and a few others has left me positively wanting to avoid any future efforts on his part.There were some superb supporting characters that were largely wasted in the film.  Billy Connolly, who was so superb in MRS. BROWN only a few years ago, was likable in his small role as Uncle Montgomery, but he, alas, met his fate rather quickly.  Timothy Sprall, who is well known to any fan of Mike Leigh's films, was not given too much of a chance to excel in his role as Mr. Poe.  Meryl Streep has a bit more room to create an interesting role, but she also unfortunately plays less of a role than Mr. Carrey.  Also unenjoyable are the young twins who play the youngest Baudelaire girl.  The problem is that it is pretty much impossible to use a pre-verbal child in a role that on the written page communicates meaning.  In the film, however, they attempt to supplement this with subtitles.  And there is not even the tiniest attempt to mesh Cedric the Entertainer into the film.  The one performance that is consistently good is that of Jude Law as the voice of Lemony Snicket.  In fact, however, he achieves this by doing a precise impersonation of the voice of Daniel Handler, the author of the novels.  Anyone who has heard him interviewed and then listened to Law can fail to see the similarity.Although the film fails pretty much across the board in engaging the viewer's emotions, it is consistently fascinating to look at.  I wouldn't be surprised if the film was one of the contenders for the Razzies for worst film of the year (that is pretty much a given), but it could also legitimately get an Oscar nomination for sets and art direction.  Rarely has such a bad movie looked this good.I must add that I do not know the books, and it is possible that some of the people who have given it good reviews have transferred some of the enjoyment they have experienced of the books over to the movies.  But without such an aide, I suspect most of us are going to find viewing this movie to be very unfortunate indeed.Oh, for the featured review at the time of my writing this I need to point out that there is a difference between an over-the-top performance and a purely ham performance,  That difference is illustrated in Carrey's performance here.",2,A truly unfortunate movie event,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,3605,"['one', 'more', 'disappointing', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'were', 'good', 'supporting', 'performers', 'marvelous', 'sets', 'was', 'marred', 'whole', 'wretched', 'set', 'performances', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'poor', 'set', 'up', 'beginning', 'film', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'children', 'playing', 'Baudelaire', 'orphans', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'premise', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'children', 'actually', 'having', 'done', 'anything', 'establish', 'reality', 'found', 'beginning', 'disliking', 'possible', 'fate', 'children', 'things', 'went', 'along', 'got', 'real', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'consequently', 'like', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'reduced', 'complete', 'state', ""I-just-don't-care-what-happens-next.I"", 'used', 'really', 'like', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'actor', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'physical', 'flexibility', 'supreme', 'goofiness', 'seemed', 'suit', 'host', 'roles', 'enough', 'acting', 'ability', 'more', 'less', 'support', 'attempts', 'more', 'serious', 'acting', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'more', 'anything', 'gigantic', 'clown', 'fear', 'one', 'feels', 'similar', 'way', 'children', 'react', 'painted', 'comedians', 'said', 'used', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'liking', 'Carrey', 'film', 'combined', 'other', 'performances', 'such', 'THE', 'MAJESTIC', 'THE', 'GRINCH', 'few', 'others', 'left', 'positively', 'wanting', 'avoid', 'future', 'efforts', 'part.There', 'were', 'superb', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'largely', 'wasted', 'film', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'superb', 'MRS.', 'BROWN', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'likable', 'small', 'role', 'Uncle', 'Montgomery', 'alas', 'met', 'fate', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Timothy', 'Sprall', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'fan', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'films', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'chance', 'excel', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'bit', 'more', 'room', 'create', 'interesting', 'role', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'less', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Carrey', 'Also', 'unenjoyable', 'are', 'young', 'twins', 'who', 'play', 'youngest', 'Baudelaire', 'girl', 'problem', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'use', 'pre-verbal', 'child', 'role', 'written', 'page', 'meaning', 'film', 'however', 'attempt', 'supplement', 'subtitles', 'not', 'even', 'tiniest', 'attempt', 'mesh', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'film', 'one', 'performance', 'consistently', 'good', 'Jude', 'Law', 'voice', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'fact', 'however', 'doing', 'precise', 'impersonation', 'voice', 'Daniel', 'Handler', 'author', 'novels', 'Anyone', 'who', 'heard', 'interviewed', 'then', 'listened', 'Law', 'can', 'fail', 'see', 'similarity.Although', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'board', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'consistently', 'fascinating', 'look', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'contenders', 'Razzies', 'worst', 'film', 'year', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'could', 'also', 'legitimately', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'sets', 'art', 'direction', 'Rarely', 'such', 'bad', 'movie', 'looked', 'good.I', 'must', 'add', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'books', 'possible', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'good', 'reviews', 'have', 'transferred', 'enjoyment', 'have', 'experienced', 'books', 'movies', 'such', 'aide', 'suspect', 'most', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'viewing', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'indeed.Oh', 'featured', 'review', 'time', 'writing', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'difference', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'purely', 'ham', 'performance', 'difference', 'illustrated', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'here']",N/A

Zwick,"[8, 16]","*1/2""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" - a creepy, cringe-inducing hunk of pseudo-Dickensian whimsy - proves, once and for all, that they just don't make good old-fashioned Victorian melodramas the way they used to.  Technically speaking, the film isn't actually set in the Victorian Era but rather in a never-never land in which 19th century fashions clash with late 20th Century technology.  And, indeed, it is the unique look of the film - achieved through extraordinary art direction and brilliant production and costume design - that is the one element of quality in the movie.The plot is vintage Dickens:  three adorable and resourceful youngsters, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, find themselves unexpectedly homeless and orphaned when a mysterious fire kills their parents and incinerates their house.  With no last will and testament specifying who is to raise them, the children are carted off to a distant ""relative"" by the name of Mr. Olaf, a creepy, sadistic eccentric who lives in a ramshackle mansion across town and hates children with a seething passion.  He also plays host to a troupe of ghoulish cretins (ostensibly fellow actors) who look like punk rock rejects from the dance clubs down in Soho.  In no time flat, Mr. Olaf has turned the three youngsters into his own personal slaves.  He even goes so far as to try to rub them out on the notion that he will then inherit their parents' money.  The plot involves the children repeatedly escaping from Olaf's diabolical clutches into the protective arms of other ""relatives,"" only to have him show up in various disguises, knock off the competition, and re-establish his primacy over the hapless trio.Although ostensibly a comedy, ""Lemony Snicket`s"" is, in actuality, an extremely dark, depressing movie, definitely not appropriate for young children, but even adults will be made uncomfortable by its obsessive emphasis on cynicism, sadism and death.  The movie reaches its nadir in a truly queasy scene in which the middle-aged Olaf attempts to marry his 14 year-old ward as a means of inheriting the money.  This is supposed to be funny?  Beyond that, the movie is boring and episodic, with little narrative thrust to hold the disparate and repetitive ""events"" (we'll agree that they are quite ""unfortunate"") together.Normally a big fan of Jim Carrey, I found his performance in this film to be repulsive and unwatchable, a new career low for him (well, his Grinch comes pretty close).  Even the normally can-do-no-wrong Meryl Streep falls victim to this film.One can only imagine what a master artist like Dickens would have done with this material, how he would have imbued it with wit and heart and a strong statement about human relationships and societal values.  ""Lemony Snickets"" could have been an imaginative, delightful story about a crazy but engaging old codger who brings magic and fun into the lives of three hurting children.  Instead, it's a dismal tale of a twisted old psychopath who spends two hours killing innocent people and terrorizing youngsters with the same fate if they don't do everything he asks them to.  I honestly can't imagine what audience these moviemakers thought they were appealing to with this movie.If this film, heaven help us, ever spawns a rash of sequels, we'll have to change the title to ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Movies.""",1,ghastly excuse for a children's film,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3366,"['*1/2', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'creepy', 'cringe-inducing', 'hunk', 'pseudo-Dickensian', 'whimsy', 'proves', 'once', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'Victorian', 'melodramas', 'way', 'used', 'Technically', 'speaking', 'film', ""n't"", 'actually', 'set', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'rather', 'never-never', 'land', '19th', 'century', 'fashions', 'clash', 'late', '20th', 'Century', 'technology', 'indeed', 'unique', 'look', 'film', 'achieved', 'extraordinary', 'art', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'production', 'costume', 'design', 'one', 'element', 'quality', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'vintage', 'Dickens', 'three', 'adorable', 'resourceful', 'youngsters', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'Sunny', 'find', 'unexpectedly', 'homeless', 'orphaned', 'when', 'mysterious', 'fire', 'kills', 'parents', 'house', 'last', 'will', 'testament', 'specifying', 'who', 'raise', 'children', 'are', 'carted', 'distant', 'relative', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Olaf', 'creepy', 'sadistic', 'eccentric', 'who', 'ramshackle', 'mansion', 'town', 'children', 'seething', 'passion', 'also', 'host', 'troupe', 'ghoulish', 'cretins', 'ostensibly', 'fellow', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'punk', 'rock', 'rejects', 'dance', 'clubs', 'down', 'Soho', 'time', 'flat', 'Mr.', 'Olaf', 'turned', 'three', 'youngsters', 'own', 'personal', 'slaves', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'try', 'rub', 'out', 'notion', 'will', 'then', 'inherit', 'parents', 'money', 'plot', 'children', 'repeatedly', 'escaping', 'Olaf', 'diabolical', 'clutches', 'protective', 'arms', 'other', 'relatives', 'only', 'have', 'show', 'up', 'various', 'disguises', 'knock', 'off', 'competition', 're-establish', 'primacy', 'hapless', 'ostensibly', 'comedy', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 's', 'actuality', 'extremely', 'dark', 'depressing', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'obsessive', 'emphasis', 'cynicism', 'sadism', 'death', 'movie', 'nadir', 'truly', 'queasy', 'scene', 'middle-aged', 'Olaf', 'attempts', 'marry', '14', 'year-old', 'ward', 'means', 'inheriting', 'money', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Beyond', 'movie', 'boring', 'episodic', 'little', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'hold', 'disparate', 'repetitive', 'events', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'are', 'quite', 'unfortunate', 'together.Normally', 'big', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'found', 'performance', 'film', 'be', 'repulsive', 'unwatchable', 'new', 'career', 'low', 'well', 'Grinch', 'pretty', 'close', 'Even', 'normally', 'can-do-no-wrong', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'victim', 'film.One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'master', 'artist', 'Dickens', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'material', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'imbued', 'wit', 'heart', 'strong', 'statement', 'human', 'relationships', 'societal', 'values', 'Lemony', 'Snickets', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'imaginative', 'delightful', 'story', 'crazy', 'engaging', 'old', 'codger', 'who', 'magic', 'fun', 'lives', 'three', 'hurting', 'children', 'Instead', 'dismal', 'tale', 'twisted', 'old', 'psychopath', 'who', 'two', 'hours', 'killing', 'innocent', 'people', 'terrorizing', 'youngsters', 'same', 'fate', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'audience', 'moviemakers', 'thought', 'were', 'appealing', 'movie.If', 'film', 'heaven', 'help', 'ever', 'rash', 'sequels', ""'ll"", 'have', 'change', 'title', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Movies']",N/A

886684,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B0007PICAI,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","This film is based on the first three books of the excellent series by Lemony Snicket. I have been a fan of the series for a long time, and the fact that the story was changed considerably in the movie and that some important parts were left out is hard for me to ignore. I can understand how people who have not read the books will have a totally different perception and enjoy the movie a lot more, but I found I could not really do it.The movie starts in Snicket's usual style; we get a warning about the sadness we are about to experience and a recommendation saying we would be better off watching something else. And the mood is somber from the beginning, when the Baudelaires lose their parents. The three orphans are Violet, a very smart girl that is keen on inventing new gadgets, Klaus, a boy that spends a large portion of his time focused on books, and Sunny, the toddler that has four sharp theeth that can bite into almost anything. Now they are faced with the grim situation of having to go live with their closest relative, Count Olaf (Carey), a greedy excentric whose only goal is to get a hold of the orphan's fortune. Thus begins a series of peculiar events, including a staged wedding, a confrontation with a ""dangerous"" snake, and a fight against leeches.There are several things that are good about the movie, for example the performance of the three kids and also of Meryl Streep, who plays the role of their aunt. I enjoyed the way in which Sunny's comments are introduced in the film. In the books, these are translated to us by Snicket in his narrator voice, and in the movie we get captions with what she intends to say. On the other hand, I did not like the performance of Jim Carey, I though it was over the top, making Count Olaf a bit more ridiculous than it should really be.

A passion for reading, a gift for invention in dour times, and an acute ability to chew and crunch are the brainiac virtues of our trio of resourceful orphans from the Baudelaire family. When an unfortunate accident consumes their parents, they find themselves in the custody of their conniving uncle Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), their next of kin as luck would have it. Olaf will leave no stone unturned and no atrocity unperpetrated to lay his slimy hands on the family fortune even if it means trampling over the kids.Sounds like a measly plotline but it comes shrink-wrapped in incessant action. No less than three volumes from the eponymous book series (that toppled the Potter franchise from the NYT bestsellers list) were smooshed into this film, and it's evident in the taut production.Some bits had me cringing, like cameos from a swarm of acquatic reptiles, or a stilt house literally crumbling over a cliff into misty depths below. But hats off to the editing, artistic handcuffs could have easily been chucked aside to dwell on more graphic version of events, but things firmly remain PG. As does the humor:""You can certainly turn a phrase,"" Aunt Josephine says.""I can flip it over and rub it down, too,"" Olaf replies salaciously.Ok, not quite. But that brings us to Jim Carrey, and one minor gripe thereof. His antics are pitchperfect for a film of this genre even if the books themselves had a leaning for the melancholy, but his screen presence is so strident he runs the risk of overshadowing everything else. This works well for capers like Ace Ventura or The Mask where he's the unequivocal centre of attention but it's a bit distracting in this case.Fortunately, there's Meryl Streep to balance out his comedic carte blanche, she's got a minor cameo but leaves an indelible mark on the film. Dustin Hoffman champions the meaningless guest appearance role like he did in Finding Neverland recently. Emily Browning as the eldest of the kids is no Christina Ricci to lend that eerie Addams Family flavor. Liam Aiken plays the geeky bookworm of a boy but appears too stumped to come off as erudite.The true star of the show if you ask me is the two-year old Sunny, the runt of the litter so to speak, and her sweet mumblings are hilariously timed. Plus, she's so, so, so cute.All in all a very confident film with a delectable blend of dark comedy and adventure.

I had read the first eight books in the series, and knew that the first three books were meant to be covered.My review at that time would mostly have been shock at the scene when Olaf tries to get the Baudelaires run over by a train. However, my review now differs significantly:First, I think Jim Carrey was the big highlight of the film. He played the role of the villainous Count Olaf, who is determined to get the fortune that is left to the protagonists, the three orphaned Baudelaire children (although the eldest is a teenager). While Olaf is portrayed in a darker light in the books, Carrey made him a humourous but still fairly threatening character. His attitude towards the youngest Baudelaire, Sunny, is particularly funny, which brings me to the other highlight: Sunny.Sunny is the youngest Baudelaire, and does not speak fluently yet. She is, however, given subtitles to show what she means to say. Her siblings understand her, but no one else does, and some of her comments are very funny, such as calling Aunt Josephine ""The Mayor of crazy town"" and saying ""Wow. You are nuts"" after Count Olaf mocks her baby talk.The film deviates from the book a lot, such as the aforementioned train scene, uncovered secrets before their time in the books, and the ending especially.

886690,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0007PICAI,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","Rewatching this film recently I realised it was a lot better than I had remembered. In my mind this film was just another vehicle for Jim Carrey's, rather annoying by now, rubber faced antics, but whilst these do exist the story was pretty decent as well.When the three Baudelaire children lose their parents and home in a mysterious fire they are passed into the care of the odious Count Olaf. Olaf rapidly treats the children as slaves and plots a way to bump them off so he can enjoy their sizeable inheritance. When he is found out the kids are moved to a kindly herpetologist uncle (played by Billy Connolly) and then to an anxious aunt (played by Meryl Streep) but Olaf keeps turning up in various disguises and with more fiendish plots. The children act together to foil these plans (Violet is an inventor, Klaus is a bookworm with a photographic memory and baby Sunny is a biter!), until the film comes to it's conclusion.This film has a certain dark feel to it, so much so that initially I thought this was a Tim Burton film. As other reviewers have mentioned here this film has a definite Burton-esque quality to it, which is no bad thing, and shows how good a job the actual director, Brad Silberling, did. The children actors are actually very good and not that annoying precocious type that can ruin a film and Connolly and Streep are very good in their supporting roles. Carrey is very good as Olaf and whilst you still get his annoying bottom jaw wiggle when he annunciates certain words and his stupid dinosaur walk which pops up in other films of his, he manages to play the various Olaf characters very well.All in all this is an atmospheric film with a good story and decent acting from all involved.

The film is full of terrific cameos by big stars.  Carey and Streep are excellent in their roles and the kids are perfectly cast, as well.  Like the Harry Potter series, this story plays on two levels.  The kids will enjoy it for the action while the adults will enjoy the dark story and adult humor that flies over the kids' heads.The downer is that this is a long series of books and a sequel to the film was never made.  Because of that, there are some MAJOR questions that never get resolved because they were planned for future films that were never produced.

So, my dad wanted to see national treasure but it was sold out so we had to see this. Itwas an ok movie but it wasn't great. Why, well alot and I mean ALOT was left out. They didn't use the original endings to the books (this movie was based on the first 3 books and I guess the last book I only rad the first 3 so far.) The endings had alot of plot holes. Part 3 (thrid book) I must admit was probably the best. Now, not to be a spolier but if you had read the first book and the part with the play and how count olaf was actually marrying violoit for the fortune blah blah what!?, this was skipped all the way before the end of the movie! whats up with that!? so, that kind of upset me there. Abyways. I think this movie deserves atlest three stars. If you want atleast a general idea of the series go ahead and watch this but I reccomend you stick with the book series it's a ewhole lot better! trust me!",3,I can only give this three stars....,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1137,"['Well', 'mom', 'dad', 'decided', 'take', 'see', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'incredibles', 'little', 'brother', 'wanted', 'see', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'incredibles', 'was', 'showing', 'already', 'would', 'be', 'late', 'was', 'bummed', 'out', 'So', 'dad', 'wanted', 'see', 'national', 'treasure', 'was', 'sold', 'out', 'had', 'see', 'Itwas', 'ok', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Why', 'well', 'alot', 'mean', 'ALOT', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'original', 'endings', 'books', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'first', '3', 'books', 'guess', 'last', 'book', 'only', 'rad', 'first', '3', 'so', 'far', 'endings', 'had', 'alot', 'plot', 'holes', 'Part', '3', 'thrid', 'book', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'Now', 'not', 'be', 'spolier', 'had', 'read', 'first', 'book', 'part', 'play', 'how', 'count', 'olaf', 'was', 'actually', 'marrying', 'violoit', 'fortune', 'blah', 'blah', 'what', 'was', 'skipped', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'up', 'so', 'kind', 'upset', 'there', 'Abyways', 'think', 'movie', 'atlest', 'three', 'stars', 'want', 'general', 'idea', 'series', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'reccomend', 'stick', 'book', 'series', 'ewhole', 'lot', 'better', 'trust']",N/A

Since the premise of the movie is already in so many reviews, I will not repeat it.Why did I like it?  As other viewers have said,  this movie falls into the ranks of an original story that holds your attention through the course of the movie.  In this movie you find yourself getting to know and like these three kids.  They have no super powers, no magic dust, or fairy princess.  They have clever minds and are extremely innovative.Despite what others have written Jim Carrey was very good in this movie as the villain.  I think he is a much better actor than people think.  Merryl Streep's character was very funny.My wife and kids also enjoyed the movie.

I first heard about Amazon.com about 5-6 years ago, and maybe at little bit before that, I had started writing reviews here in early 2001, so that should be about the right time. And it hard to believe that Amazon.com is 10 years old. And I hope more happy anniversites in the future from Amazon.com. And now on to the review of Lemony Snicket's A Series of UnFortunate Events. Jim Carrey returns to playing a villian in this movie, that is unrozineable, he doesn't look, sound, moves, or even acts like he normally does, the last time that we have seen him playing a villian, was How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). And both of these movies got 2 thumbs down from Ebert & Roeper, this one was a mild thumbs down from Roger Ebert. Now I can understand them hating How the Grinch Stole Christmas, since it was a comedy, but this film got good reviews from the movie critics. The film starts with a cartoon of a happy elf, and then we hear the voice of Lemony Snicket (Jude Law), that says that this is not the film you will not see, and is seen in the film, but lurking in the dark, writing the story down on a typewriter. And there is a really Lemony Snicket who wrote this series of books, and even has commentry of the dvd, with the director, or also has his own commentry. The tale is about 3 children Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and Sunny (Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman) Baudelaire, learn from Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall) that their parents was killed in a house fire, and now are oprhans, and with orders from their parents in their will, to take them to thier close family member Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who is their cousin, somehow removed. Or Sunny thinks that somebody's brain that has been removed. Olaf is an actor, and he has his own theatre, and he is evil, and makes the kids to chorces including making dinner from him and his acting troop, but he doesn't say that he wants Roast Beef, and they make him, Puttanesca. Along they way he way, he wins guardinship of the children, stop by a sotre, and parks his car on train tracks, and soon a train comes, and he is laughing wickedly in side, and who also be in the area, but Mr. Poe who can't hear the children because of the train, so they work a plan to not be hit. And then when the plan workds, Mr. Poe takes them from the count, and brings them to their next guiarden Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly), and then Count Olaf shows up claimning to be a scientist, and then kills him, when hte kids aren't looking, and then they are picked up again by Mr. Poe and move in with their Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep), whom you name it, she is afaird of it. And then the count shows up again claimming to be a sailor, but of course the kids are smart, and know it is really him behind all these disquises.",5,Jim Carrey returns to evil roots in Lemony Snicket,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,2900,"['am', 'going', 'start', 'review', 'bit', 'different', 'then', 'usually', 'do', 'would', 'like', 'wish', 'Amazon.com', 'happy', '10', 'anniversity', 'first', 'heard', 'Amazon.com', '5-6', 'years', 'ago', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'had', 'started', 'writing', 'reviews', 'here', 'early', '2001', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'time', 'hard', 'believe', 'Amazon.com', '10', 'years', 'old', 'hope', 'more', 'happy', 'anniversites', 'future', 'Amazon.com', 'now', 'review', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'UnFortunate', 'Events', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'villian', 'movie', 'unrozineable', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'moves', 'even', 'acts', 'normally', 'last', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'playing', 'villian', 'was', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', '2000', 'movies', 'got', '2', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'one', 'was', 'mild', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Now', 'can', 'understand', 'hating', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'was', 'comedy', 'film', 'got', 'good', 'reviews', 'movie', 'critics', 'film', 'cartoon', 'happy', 'elf', 'then', 'hear', 'voice', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'Jude', 'Law', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'seen', 'film', 'lurking', 'dark', 'writing', 'story', 'down', 'typewriter', 'really', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'who', 'wrote', 'series', 'books', 'even', 'commentry', 'dvd', 'director', 'also', 'own', 'commentry', 'tale', '3', 'children', 'Violet', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Klaus', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Sunny', 'Kara', 'Hoffman', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'Baudelaire', 'learn', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'parents', 'was', 'killed', 'house', 'fire', 'now', 'are', 'oprhans', 'orders', 'parents', 'will', 'take', 'thier', 'close', 'family', 'member', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'cousin', 'somehow', 'removed', 'Sunny', 'thinks', 'somebody', 'brain', 'been', 'removed', 'Olaf', 'actor', 'own', 'theatre', 'evil', 'kids', 'chorces', 'including', 'making', 'dinner', 'acting', 'troop', ""n't"", 'say', 'Roast', 'Beef', 'make', 'Puttanesca', 'way', 'way', 'guardinship', 'children', 'stop', 'sotre', 'parks', 'car', 'train', 'tracks', 'soon', 'train', 'laughing', 'wickedly', 'side', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'area', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'children', 'train', 'work', 'plan', 'not', 'be', 'hit', 'then', 'when', 'plan', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'count', 'next', 'guiarden', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'then', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'up', 'claimning', 'be', 'scientist', 'then', 'when', 'hte', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'then', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Poe', 'move', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'whom', 'name', 'afaird', 'then', 'count', 'up', 'again', 'claimming', 'be', 'sailor', 'course', 'kids', 'are', 'smart', 'know', 'really', 'disquises']",N/A

886696,A3E8OD9EKMMDEJ,B0007PICAI,"The Game ""B""","[2, 6]","Overall, i would say that this is a pretty average movie. Jim Carrey actually delivers great acting the audience, but why does he spazz out randomly in every movie he acts in? (If you could comment on why you think he does that would be great).The movie is about three Baudelaire children, Violet who is 14 years old and loves inventing things, Klaus who is 12 and loves reading, and sunny who is a baby who has an obsession for biting things. Their parents get killed in a terrible fire and now they are stuck on their own as orphans. Their best friend Mr.Poe who is now in charge of them drives them to one of their relatives, Count Olaf. It turns out that Count Olaf is a complete phyco and forces them to do hard chores every day, gives them a 1 room bedroom, and is downright harsh on them.After a few weeks with him, Mr Poe realizes that he is an idiot and just wants their fortune so he transfers the orphans to their Uncle Monty who lives in a large mansion like house. The house has a huge ""reptile room"" which is filled of make believe reptiles (mostly at least). However, Count Olaf disguises himself and enters the house. The orphans know who he really is, and keeps persuading Uncle Monty that he is Count Olaf in disguise. Of course, he doesn't believe them, but then is sneakily killed in the night while the orphans are sleeping by Olaf. It takes a lot of solving to finally find out that it was Olaf who killed him.The last stop for the Orphans is their Aunt Josephines house who lives of a cliff. Once again, guess who comes in disguise and enters the house, and the same thing basically happens as before. This is one of the few problems of this movie, repetition. Aunt Josephine gets kidnapped by Count Olaf, but she manages to right a note hinting where she is currently at. The Orphans figure it out and rescue her. They start sailing back (she was currently stranded on a cave across Lake Lachromose filled of deadly leaches)and are attacked by deadly leaches. Count Olaf then comes and tosses Aunt Josephine overboard, but Mr.Poe comes and saves them. The orphans try and convince Mr.Poe that it was Olaf who tossed her overboard, but once again he doesn't listen. At the end of the movie, Olaf holds a play where he is supposed to ""pretendly"" marry Violet. However, according to their law, it COULD actually be a real marriage without anyone knowing it, so Olaf takes advantage of this. The orphans know about it, but they are threatened that if they spread word about it to anyone, ther baby Sunny will be killed. At the end of the play, Count Olaf announces that he has actually really married Violet sending gasps all along the audience. Mr.Poe states that it is obsurd. Klaus in the meantime manages to rescue sunny, so she is no longer a threat. Count Olaf manages to escape, but the orphans end up safe after all.In my opinion, this movie is way to repetitive and dull. Count Olaf keeps reappering in disguise, Mr.Poe realizes that its actually him and then transfers them to somewhere else. (its the same like that for the first 1-5 books). The storyline also seems a little bit dull, them just trying to figure out if their parents are really alive or not, that is basically the whole story for the movie and books 1-12. However, the acting in this movie is very well done as well as the script. Jim Carrey does a wonderful job acting as Count Olaf as well as all of the actors of Count Olafs evil ""comrades.""

886697,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0007PICAI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 3]","Take a generous dose of Tim Burton's visual style, mix in liberal amounts of Roald Dahl's children's stories, add a little of Edward Gorey and Charles Addams' work and you get `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events', the newest Holiday film starring Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, Billy Connolly and others.The Baudelaire Children, Violet, Klaus and little baby Sunny, live happily with their parents while pursuing their various interests. Violet (Emily Browning), is the oldest and she likes to invent. Klaus (Liam Aiken) loves to read. Sunny (Shelby & Kara Hoffman) simply loves to bite. It should come as no surprise to anyone who loves children's books that each of these attributes will become very handy during the course of the story. Their happy lives are turned asunder when a mysterious fire burns down their happy home and kills their parents. The executor (Timothy Spall) of their parent's estate, leaves them in the care of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), perhaps a relative, they aren't quite sure. Olaf is a wannabee actor with his own troop of followers and he desperately wants to get his hands on the children's money. He becomes a male Wicked Stepmother and insists that they do everything that comes into his mind. When he realizes he won't get to their money that easily, he sets about trying to figure out other methods. During the course of events, the children are briefly in the care of the eccentric Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly), a scientist ready to lead a new expedition to Peru in search of snakes and Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep), an eccentric widower convinced that everything in her rickety house can kill.`Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' is based on the first three books of the enormously successful children's series. Brad Silberling (probably most famous for the movie version of `Casper' starring Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman and an animated friendly ghost) hits just the right tones. The story is dark, much like Roald Dahl's children's stories. The film starts with the death of the children's parents, not exactly happy stuff. Even as the children are dealing with these circumstances, we don't feel necessarily depressed. The children are smart and seem to be able to take care of themselves. Their independence seems to propel the story.The sets and style of the film seems to borrow heavily from Edward Gorey and Charles Addams cartoons. Everything is gray and dirty and dusty. The film's visual look is simply stunning. The gargantuan amount of detail in the three houses the children visit promise a lot of eye candy. If we were to revisit some of these homes (in a possible sequel? Who am I kidding?), we would find new and exciting surprises. There are many exterior scenes which are treated with the same attention to detail. All of this leads to a richly observed fantasy world that has been created for us, the viewer. The richer the details, the more real it seems.Jim Carrey seems to have found the perfect vehicle for his over the top acting style. His character, an actor, has portraits of himself lining every wall of the house. All of the portraits depict Olaf in a particular `important' role, as say Hamlet. Olaf has formed his own acting troupe and the desperate souls cling to him because they sense that he has something that will help them. Of course, this only serves to feed his ego as well. His acting proves useful when he feels that he must use a new disguise to try to fool the children or the adults. These disguises prove a useful vehicle for Carrey and his comic persona.Billy Connolly brings just the right levity to the situation as Uncle Monty. He is the type of adult that actually enjoys the company of children and therefore doesn't talk down to them. He treats them as equals and immediately suggests they go on an adventure. Violet and Klaus immediately feel as though they have found their new home with their eccentric Uncle. What kid wouldn't love an adult like that? Unfortunately, Olaf won't let the money get away from him that easily. Soon, they are deposited in the care of widowed Aunt Josephine. Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and she seems to relish the character of Aunt Josephine. Completely on edge, her character is afraid of everything and this brings no small amount of terror into the children's lives. At the same time, we like her character, because she seems to care for the children.`Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' is a great film for kids and will probably keep most parents amused. It may seem a bit dark during the beginning but this only forces the three children to bond together and create their own family.

886706,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007PICAI,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","Probably, the best part of 'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' is its end credit animation, which I suppose comes the closest to the wry humor of the original books.  As to the body of the film, well, I can say the film surely gives you one of the best production designs in recent years, plus curiously attractive, gloomy and moody photography of Emmanuel Lubezki ('Sleepy Hollow') and the good music score by Thomas Newman.[CO-PRODUCED BY NICKELODEON] If you haven't read the books by 'Lemony Snicket' which, refusing to give traditional happy endings, keep on recounting the endless 'unfortunate' events coming the three orphaned children of the Baudeliare family, well, that doesn't matter.  Picture to yourself the world of Harry Potter without magic, and the three lovable kids who must confront the most difficult (and often life-theatening) situations with the inventive skills of Violet, the knowledge of Klaus (gained from his father's library), and the teeth of Little Sunny.From the beginning, Klaus, Violet, and Sunny are thrown into the most painful situations -- newly orphaned, they are sent to the guardian Count Olaf, conceited, terrible amateur actor living in a ruined house, who only thinks of inheriting the enormous money the kids are supposed to have.  He is incredibly resourceful in making sinister plans to get rid of the children, but they are always wiser than he believes them to be.In addition to Jim Carrey playing Olaf, you can see Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Cerdric the Entertainer, Luis Guzman, Jennifer Coolidge, Catherine O'Hara, and Meryl Streep.  The film's narration of 'Snicket' is by Jude Law, and there are several guest appearances (one by Dustin).So how good is Jim Carrey playing the villain Count Olaf?  Or how about the three kids of the Baudeliare family?  It depends.  His over-the-top acting as Olaf is, I think, nothing refreshing or imaginative, just recycled antics of 'The Mask' and 'Ace' he did years ago.  I liked Klaus and Violet played by Liam Aiken and Emily Browning respectively, but they might look, to some, too clean and sanitized.  But in the film where deaths are only suggested, that cannot be helped.[WHERE IS TIM BURTON?] Finally, I make some comments on the director who should be in charge of controlling the actors, and I'm done.  Why did they choose Brad Silberling as director, best known for 'The Moonlight Mile' and 'City of the Angels' (let's forget the 'Casper' debacle)?  His direction always lacks in the boundless imagination of Tim Burton, or the wry humor of Barry Sonenfeld (who co-produced 'Snicket').  'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' remains reasonably attarative all through, largely because of its beautiful images.  But the film itself is soulless, even patronizing in having the characters say what should be unsaid, at the end of the film.  Next time, in making a sequel (which I heartily welcome), do it with another director, please.",4,Visually Great But Story Needs More Imagination and Humor,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2963,"['Probably', 'best', 'part', ""'Lemony"", 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'end', 'credit', 'animation', 'suppose', 'closest', 'wry', 'humor', 'original', 'books', 'body', 'film', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'production', 'designs', 'recent', 'years', 'curiously', 'attractive', 'gloomy', 'moody', 'photography', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'Hollow', 'good', 'music', 'score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', '[', 'CO-PRODUCED', 'BY', 'NICKELODEON', ']', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'Lemony"", 'Snicket', 'refusing', 'give', 'traditional', 'happy', 'endings', 'keep', 'recounting', 'endless', ""'unfortunate"", 'events', 'coming', 'three', 'orphaned', 'children', 'Baudeliare', 'family', 'well', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Picture', 'yourself', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'magic', 'three', 'lovable', 'kids', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'most', 'difficult', 'often', 'life-theatening', 'situations', 'inventive', 'skills', 'Violet', 'knowledge', 'Klaus', 'gained', 'father', 'library', 'teeth', 'Little', 'Sunny.From', 'beginning', 'Klaus', 'Violet', 'Sunny', 'are', 'thrown', 'most', 'painful', 'situations', 'newly', 'orphaned', 'are', 'sent', 'guardian', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'conceited', 'terrible', 'amateur', 'actor', 'living', 'ruined', 'house', 'who', 'only', 'inheriting', 'enormous', 'money', 'kids', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'incredibly', 'resourceful', 'making', 'sinister', 'plans', 'get', 'rid', 'children', 'are', 'always', 'wiser', 'be.In', 'addition', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'Olaf', 'can', 'see', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'Cerdric', 'Entertainer', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'film', 'narration', ""'Snicket"", 'Jude', 'Law', 'are', 'several', 'guest', 'appearances', 'one', 'Dustin', 'how', 'good', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'villain', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'how', 'three', 'kids', 'Baudeliare', 'family', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Olaf', 'think', 'nothing', 'refreshing', 'imaginative', 'just', 'recycled', 'antics', ""'The"", 'Mask', 'did', 'years', 'ago', 'liked', 'Klaus', 'Violet', 'played', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'respectively', 'might', 'look', 'too', 'clean', 'sanitized', 'film', 'where', 'deaths', 'are', 'only', 'suggested', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', '[', 'WHERE', 'IS', 'TIM', 'BURTON', ']', 'Finally', 'make', 'comments', 'director', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'charge', 'controlling', 'actors', ""'m"", 'done', 'Why', 'did', 'choose', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'director', 'best', 'known', ""'The"", 'Moonlight', 'Mile', ""'City"", 'Angels', 'let', 'forget', ""'Casper"", 'debacle', 'direction', 'always', 'boundless', 'imagination', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'wry', 'humor', 'Barry', 'Sonenfeld', 'who', 'co-produced', ""'Snicket"", 'Snicket', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'reasonably', 'attarative', 'largely', 'beautiful', 'images', 'film', 'soulless', 'even', 'patronizing', 'having', 'characters', 'say', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'unsaid', 'end', 'film', 'Next', 'time', 'making', 'sequel', 'heartily', 'welcome', 'do', 'director', 'please']",N/A
886707,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0007PICAI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 4]","I do a lot of work with youth and some children I worked with this summer convinced me that I should check out A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS books. I bought the first one, but didn't read it until almost 4 months later. When I finally did read it, I was hooked. The writing and witty wordplay in the novels is magnificent. As soon as I could, I bought the next two books in the series so that I could be prepared when the movie was released. Well, the film version is now here and I've seen it and I am very impressed. Very impressed, indeed.The movie begins with a cute little animation feature called THE HAPPIEST ELF. When it began, I thought this little animated cartoon was going to be an extra bonus, a cartoon featurette that we didn't know about. But, THE HAPPIEST ELF was just a gimmick, illustrating everything that LEMONY SNICKET'S SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS isn't. The movie revolves around the Baudelaire siblings, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They are enjoying themselves at the beach on a somewhat foggy day when Mr. Poe, a banker and semi-lawyer arrives to inform them of a most unfortunate event: that their home has just burned down with their parents inside. The children are not only orphans, but homeless as well. Thus begins the series of unfortunate events. The siblings find themselves in one harrowing situation after another, usually trying to avoid or foil the plans of Count Olaf, the man who is supposedly their closest kin. Olaf just wants the Baudelaire fortune and will stop at nothing to get it. Trains, snakes, leeches, and a play are all means Olaf uses in an attempt to inherit the Baudelaire fortune.  But all to no avail and don't be mistaken. Olaf may look like a decent enough chap and have a radiating and comical personality, but the man is a deathly menace. In the course of the movie he kills at least three people, dangles a baby from a tower, and tries to marry his own 14-year-old cousin. However, despite this series of unfortunate events, the Baudelaires are able to come together as a trio and defeat the attempts one after the other. They have each other and they learn that no matter how horrible things get, you can always create your own little sanctuary.LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS is a very entertaining movie and has one of the best messages about the importance of family that I have seen on screen in a long time (surprisingly, this movie delivers the message even better than THE INCREDIBLES and FINDING NEMO). However, the film has a very dark tone and the youngest of children will be frightened. Jim Carrey is perfectly cast as Count Olaf. In the books, the children fear Olaf from the moment they set eyes on him. However, despite all the horrible things he makes them do, he appears charming and fools adults into believing he's harmless. But Olaf is a very nasty, hateful, and evil man. He kills at least three people in the movie, though the audience never actually sees any of the deaths. Carrey's overexuberance is perfect for Olaf because it hides the very dark and sinister core of a person that he really is.  Emily Browning is an excellent Violet. However, though Liam Aiken captures the bookish, and depressed personality of Klaus, he was slightly miscast: he seems too old for the role he plays and he doesn't wear any glasses. Meryl Streep uses her superb dramatic skills to perfection, portraying the oversensitive Aunt Josephine. There are also several cameos, but the most memorable is the one Dustin Hoffman makes as the theatre critic who comes to see Count Olaf's ""play"".However, the most memorable character in movie is Sunny, portrayed by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman. Sunny doesn't say a whole lot because she can't speak English. She manages a few words here and there, but usually it's babytalk. In the books, though not everyone else can understand what Sunny says, Violet and Klaus can. To achieve this effect, the filmmakers used subtitles to illustrate what Sunny actually is saying in her ""babytalk."" These moments are hilarious and make Sunny the most enduring of the three siblings, which is the way it should be. Sunny should be the sunniest of the trio.The sets and costumes of the film are magnificient. The designers have built a world that is reminiscient of Dickens' world of class system full of elitism and paupery, yet strangely modern. It's a world that seems so real, but is actually on the verge of dreaming and waking.In the only overt advertising of the movie, there is one scene that includes the AFLAC Duck sitting on a boat. A piece of debris hits the boat and narrowly misses the duck. In my opinion, the filmmakers should have let the Duck get hit--it would have fit in with the movie's theme and tone better and also delivered AFLAC's marketing even better.Despite the movie's dark undertones and somewhat frightening images, LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS is the best family fair out right now.  It's Christmas time and theatres and televsion are full of movies full of cheesy cheer expounding the virtues of family. There's lots of fluff but outside of Charlie Brown, George Bailey, and a few other moments, there really isn't a lot of substance. It's almost ironic that the movie with the strongest message about love and family is in a film where people die, children are placed in harms way, and bad things happen all the time.  It just goes to show that often a series of unfortunate events is just the beginning to a wonderful and marvelous journey on this odyssey called life.",5,A Family Movie Unlike Any

886708,A2NAM6PUE3TGDU,B0007PICAI,Valarie Rose Revels,"[0, 0]","Having read the first three books (and more) that the movie is based on, I didn't know what to expect. You have the three young Baudelaire orphans who have gone through a tragic event, and then they are being hounded by the deadly Count Olaf. Could anybody make this into a film for kids? Yes.In a movie that looks like Edward Gorey meets Roald Dahl, the story of the ""woeful"" Baudelaire children and the nefarious Count Olaf captures the very dark humor of the books and the ingenuity the children employ to escape deadly situations. Some of the distinct physical characteristics each of the children possess in the books (Klaus' glasses, Sunny's dress, Violet's braids) are discarded in the movie, but what is left is their very special gifts (Klaus' photographic memory of everything he's read, Sunny's very sharp cutting teeth, Violet's genius at inventing) that help them escape Count Olaf's clutches.I had wondered how anyone could translate the murdering Count Olaf to the big screen. But when I saw Jim Carrey's Count Olaf, I knew there couldn't be anyone else. He captures the totally self-absorbed, ham-acting, and totally crazy Count Olaf. Sometimes, you find yourself laughing, sometimes frightened, and sometimes shocked at his joyfully bizarre behavior in his quest to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune.Match Jim Carrey's Count Olaf to Emily Browning's Violet, Liam Aiken's Klaus, and the twin's, Kara and Shelby Hoffman, baby Sunny and you have a perfect kids movie to rival some of Roald Dahl's very dark film adaptations (""Matilda"", ""The Witches"", ""James & the Giant Peach""). The rest of the cast was perfect as well -- Meryl Streep and Cedric the Entertainer in the same movie and it works!Three technical things about the movie deserve special note. The make-up for Jim Carrey's Count Olaf was exceptional. I had to check the credits to make sure it really was Jim Carrey. Make-up won a well-deserved Academy Award. The production design didn't win an Oscar, but the world that was created in a studio seemed so real, yet so fairy tale-like that I am still noticing little special details. The soundtrack from the movie is one of my favorites and I still love it because it's just so quirky and really fits the movie. I still listen to it years later.I highly recommend it.",5,Edward Gorey Meets Roald Dahl and It Works,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2298,"['Having', 'read', 'first', 'three', 'books', 'more', 'movie', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'have', 'three', 'young', 'Baudelaire', 'orphans', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'tragic', 'event', 'then', 'are', 'being', 'hounded', 'deadly', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Could', 'anybody', 'make', 'film', 'kids', 'Yes.In', 'movie', 'Edward', 'Gorey', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'story', 'woeful', 'Baudelaire', 'children', 'nefarious', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'books', 'ingenuity', 'children', 'employ', 'escape', 'deadly', 'situations', 'distinct', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'children', 'possess', 'books', 'Klaus', 'glasses', 'Sunny', 'dress', 'Violet', 'braids', 'are', 'discarded', 'movie', 'what', 'left', 'very', 'special', 'gifts', 'Klaus', 'photographic', 'memory', 'everything', 'read', 'Sunny', 'very', 'sharp', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'Violet', 'genius', 'inventing', 'help', 'escape', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'clutches.I', 'had', 'wondered', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'translate', 'murdering', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'saw', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'knew', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'anyone', 'else', 'totally', 'self-absorbed', 'ham-acting', 'totally', 'crazy', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Sometimes', 'find', 'laughing', 'sometimes', 'frightened', 'sometimes', 'shocked', 'joyfully', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'quest', 'get', 'hands', 'Baudelaire', 'fortune.Match', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'Violet', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'Klaus', 'twin', 'Kara', 'Shelby', 'Hoffman', 'baby', 'Sunny', 'have', 'perfect', 'kids', 'movie', 'rival', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Matilda', 'Witches', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'as', 'well', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'same', 'movie', 'Three', 'technical', 'things', 'movie', 'deserve', 'special', 'note', 'make-up', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'was', 'exceptional', 'had', 'check', 'credits', 'make', 'sure', 'really', 'was', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Make-up', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'production', 'design', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'world', 'was', 'created', 'studio', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'yet', 'so', 'fairy', 'tale-like', 'am', 'still', 'noticing', 'little', 'special', 'details', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'still', 'love', 'just', 'so', 'quirky', 'really', 'movie', 'still', 'listen', 'years', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Although the gloomy sets and attempts to murder the children might seem off putting, most kids like to be scared (a little).  They will love the resourcefulness of the children as they foil each plot.Carey is over-the-top in his characterization, but it's perfect for this movie.The setting veers from Victorian (mansions, costumes, manners) to modern (an automobile, refrigerator) in a bizarre way, but somehow it all works.

886711,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B0007PICAI,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[2, 2]","I have not read the book(s) that this movie is based on, so my opinion is just of the film which I enjoyed.First of all, the sets, costumes and scenary of the film are absolutely fantastic.  It's kind of a Victorian era meets modern times cross.  Women wear Victorian gowns and men wear Victorian suits, yet there are cars with telephones (big, black bulky Ma Bell telephones, but car telephones all the same).  The cars also have weird reel to reel tape players that you could imagine being invented and existing in some kind of alternate universe.  Aunt Josephine's house on Lachrymose Lake is spectacular as well perched over a high cliff with a telescoping shutter over the main room window.  In fact telescopes, lenses, lights and shutters seem to be a big part of the background as well as part of the plot.I also loved the actors that portrayed the Baudelaire orphans.  I thought both Violet and Klaus were well suited to their roles and did an outstanding job with them.  Meryl Streep plays Aunt Josephine and is also particularly good, although Cedric the Entertainer seems a little out of place in a small part.Jim Carey, on the other hand, is a bit of a different story.  People either love or hate Jim Carey, and with me it's mostly hate.  However, if you pick this up as a Jim Carey movie you may be disappointed because unlike most Jim Carey movies, it's not all about him.  Yes, his character, Count Olaf, is central to the plot, but this film is more of a medley of fantastic sets, good characters, and an interesting plot than a Jim Carey vehicle.  That said, Carey for the most part does an outstanding job in this film in a way that I have never seen before.  Except for a few Carey-esque smirks and squeals that really didn't reach the level of annoyance that I usually feel watching a Jim Carey movie, he does an outstanding job.  His portrayal of Stephano in particular is masterful and shows a depth of Carey's talent that I never suspected existed.  Ultimately, Carey fits the role of Count Olaf perhaps more than any other person on the planet could.The structure of the movie is pretty good, although the narration is a little disconcerting.  It's funny and well done, but who is this Lemony Snicket character and what's his relationship to the story he's telling?  And why is he apparently in a big clock?  This is never explained.  However, having a narrator does help explain events and keeps the movie moving along at a nice, fast clip.  Without a narrator, I don't know that you could cram as much into a feature length film as this one does.That said, one is left with a lot of unsatisfying questions at the end of this film.  Mainly concerning the Baudelaire parents, and what they did.  Also there are the tantalizing clues of the golden pocket telescopes and their meaning, as well as the ones dropped by Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine.  The movie did not do a good job of wrapping up those mysteries and kind of leaves one hanging instead.  Now it's very probable that some of these mysteries are out of the scope of this film, especially considering that the books run to 12 or 13 volumes, but still it leaves one feeling unsatisfied at the end.And for that reason, it's a four rather than a five.  A wonderful  film, that I will watch again, but also one that I just know could have been a little bit better.",4,An Interesting Film,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,3346,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'opinion', 'just', 'film', 'enjoyed.First', 'sets', 'costumes', 'scenary', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'kind', 'Victorian', 'era', 'meets', 'modern', 'times', 'cross', 'Women', 'wear', 'Victorian', 'gowns', 'men', 'wear', 'Victorian', 'suits', 'yet', 'are', 'cars', 'telephones', 'big', 'black', 'bulky', 'Ma', 'Bell', 'telephones', 'car', 'telephones', 'same', 'cars', 'also', 'have', 'weird', 'reel', 'reel', 'tape', 'players', 'could', 'imagine', 'being', 'invented', 'existing', 'kind', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'house', 'Lachrymose', 'Lake', 'spectacular', 'as', 'well', 'perched', 'high', 'cliff', 'telescoping', 'shutter', 'main', 'room', 'window', 'fact', 'telescopes', 'lenses', 'lights', 'shutters', 'seem', 'be', 'big', 'part', 'background', 'as', 'well', 'part', 'plot.I', 'also', 'loved', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'Baudelaire', 'orphans', 'thought', 'Violet', 'Klaus', 'were', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'also', 'particularly', 'good', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'little', 'place', 'small', 'part.Jim', 'Carey', 'other', 'hand', 'bit', 'different', 'story', 'People', 'love', 'hate', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'mostly', 'hate', 'However', 'pick', 'up', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'most', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'movies', 'not', 'Yes', 'character', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'central', 'plot', 'film', 'more', 'medley', 'fantastic', 'sets', 'good', 'characters', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'vehicle', 'said', 'Carey', 'most', 'part', 'outstanding', 'job', 'film', 'way', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'few', 'Carey-esque', 'smirks', 'squeals', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'level', 'annoyance', 'usually', 'feel', 'watching', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Stephano', 'particular', 'masterful', 'depth', 'Carey', 'talent', 'never', 'suspected', 'existed', 'Ultimately', 'Carey', 'role', 'Count', 'Olaf', 'perhaps', 'more', 'other', 'person', 'planet', 'could.The', 'structure', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'narration', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'funny', 'well', 'done', 'who', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'character', 'what', 'relationship', 'story', 'telling', 'why', 'apparently', 'big', 'clock', 'never', 'explained', 'However', 'having', 'narrator', 'help', 'explain', 'events', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'nice', 'fast', 'clip', 'narrator', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'one', 'said', 'one', 'left', 'lot', 'unsatisfying', 'questions', 'end', 'film', 'Mainly', 'concerning', 'Baudelaire', 'parents', 'what', 'did', 'Also', 'are', 'tantalizing', 'clues', 'golden', 'pocket', 'telescopes', 'meaning', 'as', 'well', 'ones', 'dropped', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Aunt', 'Josephine', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'wrapping', 'up', 'mysteries', 'kind', 'leaves', 'one', 'hanging', 'instead', 'Now', 'very', 'probable', 'mysteries', 'are', 'scope', 'film', 'especially', 'considering', 'books', 'run', '12', '13', 'volumes', 'still', 'one', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'end.And', 'reason', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'wonderful', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'also', 'one', 'just', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'better']",N/A

In fact, half their pleasure seemed to be in finding new errata. I won't argue - enjoyment of any kind is real enough enjoyment. On the whole, my consultants came away from the movie happy enough, but mostly happy with their own superiority in the lore of Lemony Snicket.I had only read (and not much enjoyed) the first book. I didn't think the movie-makers handled the book all that much more roughly than most scriptwriters handle most books. I found the effects generally good, and especially enjoyed Aunt Jo's lakeshore cottage, as would anyone who's survived a DIY renovation.Jim Carrey's mugging was a bit over the top, but about what I expected from Carrey and for Count Olaf. Sunny was a much more effective character in the movie than in the book, with more personality and a more positive role. Klaus and Violet were competently cast and acted. Violet, supposedly a fourteen year old girl, seemed like a junior Angelina Jolie with bee-stung lips and gothic tendency towards black fishnet. I came away unsure how she was being presented, and not sure that I wanted to know.I found the movie less than ordinary, arch goofiness without enough substance or effects to justify the movie as a whole. I'm not in the target demographic, however, and my companion film-goers were.
