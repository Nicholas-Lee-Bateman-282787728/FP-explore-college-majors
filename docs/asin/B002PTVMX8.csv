This would have a very grounding effect on anyone who was too young, or not yet born, in the early 1960's.  This documentary presents the facts of what occurred and the play out of those events on a personal level for both the Kennedy and Johnson families before the blurring effects of Camelot took root.  It also shows what can happen when a personal tragedy collides with the running of Government and the confusion that occurs as a result.This documentary is excellently produced and priced.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know what happened during the 24 hours after the Kennedy Assassination and how the personalities of those involved played out.",4,The Kennedy Assassination:  24 Hours After,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,774,"['excellent', 'historical', 'review', 'what', 'happened', 'hours', 'following', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'would', 'have', 'very', 'grounding', 'effect', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'not', 'yet', 'born', 'early', '1960', 'documentary', 'facts', 'what', 'occurred', 'play', 'events', 'personal', 'level', 'Kennedy', 'Johnson', 'families', 'blurring', 'effects', 'Camelot', 'took', 'root', 'also', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'collides', 'running', 'Government', 'confusion', 'result.This', 'documentary', 'excellently', 'produced', 'priced', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'happened', '24', 'hours', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'how', 'personalities', 'involved', 'played', 'out']",The Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After

1283322,ASBH6WZRY79PN,B002PTVMX8,"C. B. Miller ""C B Miller""","[8, 10]","As the title suggests, this DVD covers the first 24 hours after JFK was assassinated. The events are shown in chronological order; first in minutes, then hour sections. The historians/authors constantly put their own spin on the presentation of facts for dramatic purposes, which detracts from the program. It is therefore not presented, overall, in an objective fashion. They try and go inside Robert Kennedy's and Lyndon Johnson's heads and surmise what they were thinking at different points in time.It opens at thirty minutes before the assassination. It shows the famous ""Zapruder film"" footage and the race to Parkland Hospital and events therein. The narration is inter-cut with voiceover's by Secret Service men and Lady Bird Johnson. The program shows the large amount of confusion and shock that was occurring, thereafter. The one who comes shining through all of the events is First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. She leaned over and covered her husband's body after arrival at the hospital. The only time she left his side was when JFK was in the OR. Johnson is finally told at 1:10 PM was has happened to JFK. The fact the Secret Service men and JFK advisors had to basically ""steal"" JFK's casket in order to leave the hospital is like a ""dark comedy"", which sadly was true. After that the anger, tension and bad blood between Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy is shown. It is this section and that relationship that contains the most drama, speculation and conjecture by the historians of the show. They state everything as fact, but it is more POV pushing.In the end, the best part of the program was the information gleaned from the notes by respected historian, William Manchester from 1964-1965 generated originally for his tome, ""The Death of a President: November 1963"". A book that hopefully will be re-printed over the next few years as the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination draws near.",3,Dramatic & Interesting but ripe with conjecture...,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1911,"['title', 'DVD', 'first', '24', 'hours', 'JFK', 'was', 'assassinated', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'chronological', 'order', 'first', 'minutes', 'then', 'hour', 'sections', 'historians/authors', 'constantly', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'presentation', 'facts', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'program', 'therefore', 'not', 'presented', 'overall', 'objective', 'fashion', 'try', 'go', 'inside', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'heads', 'surmise', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'different', 'points', 'time.It', 'opens', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'assassination', 'famous', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'footage', 'race', 'Parkland', 'Hospital', 'events', 'therein', 'narration', 'inter-cut', 'voiceover', 'Secret', 'Service', 'men', 'Lady', 'Bird', 'Johnson', 'program', 'large', 'amount', 'confusion', 'shock', 'was', 'occurring', 'thereafter', 'one', 'who', 'shining', 'events', 'First', 'Lady', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy', 'leaned', 'over', 'covered', 'husband', 'body', 'arrival', 'hospital', 'only', 'time', 'left', 'side', 'was', 'when', 'JFK', 'was', 'OR', 'Johnson', 'finally', 'told', '1:10', 'PM', 'was', 'happened', 'JFK', 'fact', 'Secret', 'Service', 'men', 'JFK', 'advisors', 'had', 'basically', 'steal', 'JFK', 'casket', 'order', 'leave', 'hospital', 'dark', 'comedy', 'sadly', 'was', 'true', 'anger', 'tension', 'bad', 'blood', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'shown', 'section', 'relationship', 'most', 'drama', 'speculation', 'conjecture', 'historians', 'show', 'state', 'everything', 'fact', 'more', 'POV', 'end', 'best', 'part', 'program', 'was', 'information', 'gleaned', 'notes', 'respected', 'historian', 'William', 'Manchester', '1964-1965', 'generated', 'originally', 'tome', 'Death', 'President', 'November', '1963', 'book', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 're-printed', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'assassination', 'draws']",The Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After

1283325,A3UQQ6WYJ4EDQ1,B002PTVMX8,Joey D,"[23, 29]","Interesting on the surface. But as one gets toward the conclusion you find it's real point of view is to bolster Lyndon Johnson's standing in the minds of the American public. His manipulation of events on Air Force One is acknowledged, thankfully, but his back at Washington movements is given a damned if you do-damned if you don't slant. What is not acknowledged is that Johnson was on the brink of being arrested and having his whole political career flushed down the toilet right before the assassination took place or that he was going to be thrown off the ticket in the upcoming election. To those who think that Johnson was in on the ""shenanigans"", the section of Johnson at Parkland being kept in the dark as to what was going on will seem ludicrous. For a program that deals with the 24 hr period after the assassination, minute by minute and hour by hour, the controversial autopsy is  barely mentioned. I did find one of the on camera interviewees smiling and beaming as he talked about Kennedy's death jarring until the final moments when I realized that this was practically a tribute to Lyndon Johnson, who  I paraphrase) ""did the best he could under trying circumstances"". They promote his approval rating while the country was grieving together at an astounding 79% etc etc  but basically lay blame on Johnson's standing in history in that he wasn't Kennedy. No other explanation is explored. The History Channel in the last few years seem to be on a Johnson kick. They pulled the last THREE episodes of THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY at the behest of the Johnson family. Maybe this program was their atonement for daring to air that final episode of THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY.

This program details what really took place during the 24 hours immediately after the shooting in Dallas.  The program focuses mainly on the difficult position Vice President Lyndon Johnson was in and the difficult decisions he made during those 24 hours and beyond.  Focus is put on the events inside Parkland Hospital, the actual time of Kennedy's death, the well-being of Jackie, as well as the time before, during, and after Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One.  The bitterness and tension between Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy is also explored.  The Kennedy inner circle had criticized Johnson's behavior during this time, but the guest historians on this show stick up for Johnson and defend the decisions he made.  Whether or not you agree with these historians in sticking up for Johnson is up to your own judgement of the material presented.  Check out how Johnson was ""snubbed"" by the Kennedys after arriving in Washington that evening.  Fascinating stuff.

To cut a long story short they said at the end that the 3rd shot coming from the back was fired by a Mr. Hickey a Secret Service agent who was supposed to take care of the president. He fell back in the open car 2 behind and accidently hit the President that is why there was such an incredible cover up over the past 50 yrs. The third shot when contacting the head exploded.I was always of the opinion whether on purpose or not his own killed him. I do believe compared to Arab Countries Americans have many freedoms but to be honest their Govt. tells them little and I wonder exactly what the White House is a front for. Personally I believe after the death of  their president just a few months prior to the conclusion of WW2. All presidents since are questionable as to whether they are really in control. Who runs America? What propaganda do they use? Their Foreign Policies are Questionable!!! Have any of you seen &#34;American Empire&#34; Interesting.
