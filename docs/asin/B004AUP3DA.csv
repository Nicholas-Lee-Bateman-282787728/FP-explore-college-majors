1393825,A19L1OUMFT4VNE,B004AUP3DA,Basilides,"[3, 5]","This epic of the English Civil War could have been one of the really great TV dramas if it had been at least two hours longer. Film is the art of elision, television much less so. Peter Flannery's previous saga was more than twice as long as this is and I would have hoped that for the DVD extra footage would be added, because there are indications that the narrative has been compressed more than is good for it.Television in the past could always afford to dwell on dialogue scenes and explore the issues at length as film does not. This is neither one thing or the other, because it is a complex extended story like a TV adaptation of a 19thC classic novel yet the storyline is edited fast like a compressed film version. A great many things are happening very fast, in the public sphere and the private. But in biting off an awful lot of history it seems to be only barely doing justice to either the political issues or the personal stories of the characters. It's all very episodic, with short very strong filmic scenes such as the scenes of violence, spectacular historical crowd scenes, wide landscapes or a nude bathing scene, and a very impressively staged Battle of Edgehill left vividly in the mind, and in fact it is very strong visually in general.Essentially, it has all the elliptical or porous density usually found in film adaptations where a lot happens against a complex background, AND MUCH NECESSARILY HAPPENS BETWEEN SCENES because of the pre-determined amount of narrative complication that has to be fitted in. A good example would be 'La Reine Margot' which was based on a novel by Dumas but here in fact the actual template appears to be 'War And Peace' the novel, with which there are many correspondences.But with television we should not feel that so much has been left out to fit a limited time span especially when the story is an original one.With the third episode it has become clear that this really is 'Our Friends In The North' (Flannery's previous epic masterpiece of television drama), transposed to the middle of the 17th century and that the Sexby character is the equivalent of Geordie, the Daniel Craig character in 'Our Friends'. Both are extremely tough and capable of controlled violence. Geordie was not in charge of his own destiny and was pushed around by the prevailing events but survived and prospered in the end. He was the representative of Everyman and he was thoroughly apolitical working class.Sexby is also not in control but is a much more intelligent central character with some political consciousness from the start, and more wordlywise than Geordie who becomes more fully aware as the story proceeds. Geordie in 'Our Friends' at the 2/3 point is working as muscle for a Soho gangster, in the 70's during the glory days of police corruption and Soho porn. Sexby is working for Cromwell who is looking more and more like a gangster. Both become more and more sickened by what they are involved in and both are in love with a woman who is their salvation.Sexby and Geordie, like Pierre in 'War And Peace' are man in search of meaning. In each cases the answer is a particular woman who enables them to find peace. Sexby returns from Cromwell's massacres in Ireland demoralized and half broken, and as disillusioned and despairing as Geordie who descends into alcoholism after he becomes sickened by his Soho period; or as Pierre returning from the Battle of Borodino disillusioned, like Sexby, with his former hero he now considers a dictator and attempts to assassinate, and failing to do so has to endure the retreat from Moscow.In the end both characters reach a moral sticking point and act out of conviction.In Flannery's epic the peasant wisdom and humanity of Tolstoy's Platon Karatayev has divided and multiplied into the tribal groupings of Diggers, Ranters and Levellers but collectively represented by the radical and uncompromising (historical) John Lilburne (he corresponds to the Christopher Eccleston character in 'Friends'). Against them are arranged the trimmers and the forces of property and the status quo led by the great political realist Cromwell. The cental theme of this drama I suppose is the way that revolutionary ideals are always taken over by ruthless authoritarians like Cromwell, Napoleon or Stalin.ANGELICA FANSHAWE IS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER not to be confused with the woman of the same name who lived at the same time and wrote an autobiography which has nothing in common with this story.In 'Our Friends From The North' the writer had more success in dealing with an equally large chunk of history perhaps because he could rely on our familiarity with the news stories of the recent past. But in dealing with the very complex political conflicts on the Parliamentary side and deciding to make Cromwell a major character he is taking on a much greater challenge, especially with so little screen time.'Our Friends From The North' was one of the very finest works of Television literature ever seen so we owe to this writer the willingness to watch and think about this new project. At the very least we will learn a certain amount about the revolutionary politics of the Civil War. That means that we get to be reminded that Anarchism and Communism were really born here in the middle of the 17th Century, and didn't need Marx for anything that needed to be said before the introduction of modern banking and finance at the end of that century, and before the Industrial Revolution which grew out of them. (But Marx never did justice to finance capitalism anyway. He was too obsessed with the 'surplus value' created by labour to pay sufficient attention to the 'surplus value' created by money and credit.)",4,"Peter Flannery's 'War And Peace' rehearses more

1393826,A1QQBR1UPS2SME,B004AUP3DA,Carole Eberhardt,"[12, 14]",This was an enjoyable 2 disc DVD.  There were so many characters and plots that I think you need to watch it a few times to get them all straight. It was never clear if we were watching about real people or those that were invented for the story. It did not paint a very nice picture of Oliver Cromwell. He came off as unworthy and deceitful at the king whose head he wanted. The very power he despised was in the end the power he wanted for himself.  The movie was colourful and interesting with all playing their part well.

1393832,A4FX5YCJA630V,B004AUP3DA,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[52, 53]","First of all, let it be known that the blurb on the back of the DVD case is quite misleading in its attempts to market the product as more racy and spicy than it really is. The protagonist is described as a ""manipulative"" woman who ""exploits a country in crisis in a bid to better her own position"" and ""embraces her sexuality to the shock of her husband"". The tagline is ""in a country torn by war, she was the most dangerous weapon of all.""From all this you might be mistaken into thinking that ""The Devil's Whore"" is a typical bodice-ripper / faux-historical melodrama, when it fact it is quite a tasteful period piece with a respectable, wholly sympathetic heroine who neither is nor does any of the things the blurb describes. Though there are a few instances in which historical license is taken, there is also a genuine sense of wanting to capture the key events of the English Civil War and integrate the fictional character of Angelica Fanshawe into the proceedings without compromising the authenticity of the piece.Originally a four-part miniseries, which has here been spread across two discs without any noticeable breaks, ""The Devil's Whore"" alternates between two narratives: the life-story of Angelica Fanshawe (said to have been based on Anne Fanshawe, a memoirist who lived 1625 - 1680) and the English Civil War, following such recognizable figures as King Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Rainsborough, John Lilburne and Edward Sexby. A good balance is maintained between the weighty historical events and Angelica's more glamorous tribulations, and she is incorporated successfully enough into the proceedings that you may find it easy to believe the film's (utterly false) claim that this is the ""true"" story of her life and times.While still a child, Angelica Fanshawe's mother abandons her in order to become a nun in France, an occurrence that causes young Angelica to reject her faith and thus witness a vision of the devil that reoccurs throughout the series. On reaching womanhood, Angelica is happy enough to marry her childhood sweetheart (and cousin) Harry Fanshawe, but though he loves her dearly, he often feels emasculated by his spirited wife. It's her refusal to be subjugated that lands her husband in hot water with King Charles I, and soon Angelica finds herself negotiating a dangerous world on her own. She ends up rubbing shoulders with the likes of Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Rainsborough, unsure whether she's an ally or an enemy to them, as well as running from a past acquaintance with a vendetta against her. Her ultimate goal is to find a home and safety for herself, and despite the inclusion of no less than three love stories for her, each one has weight and poignancy, and provide Angelica with happiness and grief in equal measure.Roughly spanning the years from 1638 to 1660 (to be more specific, the historical storyline begins with Charles' embarrassing attempt to arrest members of Parliament in 1642, complete with his famous ""it would seem my birds have flown"" comment and ends with Cromwell's death in 1658, though Angelica's story begins and ends slightly before and after these events) the miniseries takes us through the Civil War: the chaotic courtroom trials of ""freeborn"" John Lilburne, the battles between the Cavaliers and Roundheads, the tension between various sects of Catholics and Protestants, the execution of King Charles, and the power vacuum that follows.It may help if you're familiar with the fundamentals of this time period, but even if you're not entirely sure what's going on, the film moves along briskly and entertainingly, making it easy to enjoy even if you can't follow every aspect. Though there are several deviations from historical record, there are also some nice little touches: the members of the crowd at the king's execution that dab their handkerchiefs in his blood, or the moles on Oliver Cromwell's face, or the presence of a small white poodle when Prince Rupert first appears.There are some odd glitches: after introducing Prince Rupert, he disappears from the story entirely (perhaps his scenes were cut?) and Angelica's visions of the devil are never explained or elaborated upon, but as is to be expected, the visuals are stunning. Filmed in South Africa (which now bears more of a resemblance to 17th century England than the modern-day England countryside does), the vistas are huge in scope, creating a striking backdrop for elaborate costumes and sets.The cast is top-notch. Andrea Riseborough (who at times bears an uncanny resemblance to Eva Green) is the high-light, simultaneously strong yet vulnerable, warm yet unattainable, and with an air of otherworldliness that makes it easy to see why she fascinates so many men. Despite the moniker ""devil's whore"" that is ascribed to her throughout the story, it is her name that reveals her true nature: more angel than devil, she carries the film with the help of a strong supporting cast.Dominic West is a strikingly charismatic and dominating as Oliver Cromwell, walking the fine line between sincere idealism and self-justified tyranny, and Michael Fassbender (appearing before his big break in Hollywood) is Thomas Rainsborough, a tragic foil to Cromwell. Peter Capaldi is excellent as usual as King Charles, a gentle-yet-proud man who slowly crumbles over the course of his story-arc, and the likes of Tim McInnerny, Tom Goodman-Hill and Harry Lloyd (whose names may not be familiar, but who pop up everywhere in British television) play small but crucial parts. Also noteworthy is the fact that the wife of John Lilburne (as played by Maxine Peake) is given significant screen-time and development; a worthy addition considering that she was a fascinating figure in her own right, despite often being overshadowed by her famous husband.Out of all the cast, the portrayal of Edward Sexby is probably most unlike his real-life counterpart (in appearance, personality and biography), but it's hard not to enjoy John Simm's embittered, war-scarred mercenary, a man who initially seems to enjoy bloodshed and who is unmoved by the ideals of those around him, only to gradually embrace a sense of personal conviction, driven almost entirely by his devotion to Angelica.The American release of ""The Devil's Whore"" goes by the slightly-less provocative title of ""The Devil's Mistress"" (which makes little sense in context), but both the title and the blurb give the impression of a much darker and grimmer viewing experience than it really is. The sex scenes and gore is non-gratuitous, and though there are a couple of attempted rapes, both are thwarted at the last minute. It's impossible to gauge just how sensitive each individual viewer will be when dealing with this material, but don't be put off by the title. ""The Devil's Whore"" is a memorable and enjoyable period-drama, with an intriguing heroine and a story that manages to balance out Angelica's fictional tale with the historical events of the time.",4,"""Show Me One Precedent in History for these Proceedings...""",1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,6970,"['First', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'blurb', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'quite', 'misleading',
