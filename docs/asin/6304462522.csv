424191,AGEIT17HENDIS,6304462522,Alfred Johnson,"[9, 16]","DVD REVIEWI have previously reviewed Stanley Karnow companion book, Vietnam-A History, that goes with this ten-part series. I have reposted that review below for the convenience of the reader. Most of the political points that I have made there apply here as well. I would only add that visually some of the footage brought the message home more clearly that on the printed page and I would bring to the attention of the reader some of those highlights here.This series spends much less time than Karsnow does on the long history of struggles against foreign invaders of Vietnam, particularly the Chinese. It really starts with the 19th century French occupation and more forcefully the take-over by the Japanese. When the dust of World War II settled there were massive forces in Vietnam who cried for independence but the vagaries of world politics and French imperialist designs to keep Indo-China as a colony frustrated that and led to the first of a series of post-war armed struggles for independence.The Vietnamese fighting against the French occupation that culminated in their historic victory at Dien Bien Phu and the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam in 1954 is well-documented here, as is the then shadowy American presence. President John Kennedy's early 1960's commitment to counter-insurgency as part of the global American-led fight against the expansion of the Soviet influence is explored. His initial escalation and the later increased escalation of President Lyndon Johnson are given full play here. Moreover, there are more than enough `talking heads' high officials from various American administrations to give viewers a clue as to why, when the deal went down in Vietnam they were all, more or less, clueless- except the few, very few, who saw a quagmire in the making.Something that is done in great detail here is an examination of the morale of the American soldier as time when on and the reasons for continuing the war seemed hopelessly inadequate. Along those same lines, and for comparison's sake, is a rather nice introduction to what the `enemy' thought about the whole thing, including interviews with General Giap, the military architect of the North Vietnamese strategies. Of course, no study of the course of the Vietnam War can be complete without an analysis of Tet 1968, both as a battlefield and in its relationship to a turn in American public opinion away from overt support for the war. Yes, for those who refuse to listen today in Iraq, Tet was a military defeat for the North Vietnamese. They admitted as much. However, in the modern world exclusively military objectives are not the only factors that will determine an outcome. Politically, the North by showing that this was indeed a strange adversary by American standards, moreover one committed to taking heavy casualties to achieve its goals, demonstrated that an American victory was no longer possible.Or so one would have thought in 1968. Again American politics intervened with the election of one Richard Nixon. The war dragged on for five more years. As a result, as graphically documented here, the American army was almost broken in the process of the Vietnamization of the war. The part devoted to the collateral results in Laos and Cambodia in the early 1970's produced by American actions bears close watching as well as this has not received nearly enough detailed attention.For those who want a case study in the limitations of a heavily armed army in modern warfare against a determined enemy this series is the place to look. If one solely wants a ten hour crash course into the Vietnam War era this is also your stop. This period of American history was part and parcel of my political coming of age and I found it informative and, as almost always with PBS productions, technically well done.&lt;strong>BOOK REVIEWVIETNAM -A HISTORY, STANLEY KARNOW, PENQUIN BOOKS, NEW YORK, 1983&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>As the current Bush Administration-directed quagmire continues in Iraq it is rather timely to look at the previously bout of American imperialist madness in Vietnam if only in order to demonstrate the similar mindsets, then and now, of the American political establishment and their hangers-on. This book, unintentionally I am sure, is a prima facie argument, against those who see Iraq (or saw Vietnam) as merely an erroneous policy of the American government that can be `fixed' by a change to a more rational imperialist policy guided by a different elite. Undeniably there are many differences between the current war and the struggle in Vietnam. Not the least of which is that in Vietnam there was a Communist-led insurgency that leftists throughout the world could identify with and were duty-bound to support. No such situation exists in Iraq today where, seemingly, from the little we know about the murky politics of the parties there militant leftists can support individual anti-imperialist actions as they occur but stand away, way away from the religious sectarian struggle for different versions of a fundamentalist Islamic state that the various parties are apparently fighting for.Stanley Karnow's well-informed study of the long history of struggle in Vietnam against outsiders, near and far, is a more than adequate primer about the history and the political issues, from the American side at least, as they came to a head in Vietnam in the early 1960's. This work was produced in conjunction with a Public Broadcasting System documentary in 1983 so that if one wants to take the time to get a better grasp of the situation as it unfolded the combination of the literary and visual presentations will make one an `armchair expert' on the subject. A glossary of by now unfamiliar names of secondary players and chronology of events is helpful as are some very good photographs that lead into each chapterThis book is the work of a long time journalist who covered Southeast Asia from the 1950's until at least the early 1980's when he went back after the war was over and interviewed various survivors from both sides as well as key political players. Although over twenty years has passed since the book's publication it appears to me that he has covered all the essential elements of the dispute as well as the wrangling, again mainly on the American side , of policy makers big and small. While everyone should look at more recent material that material appears to me to be essentially more specialized analysis of the general themes presented in Karnow's book. Or are the inevitably self-serving memoirs by those, like former Secretary of War Robert McNamara, looking to refurbish their images for the historical record. Karnow's book has the added virtue of having been written just long enough after the end of the war that memories, faulty as they are in any case, were still fresh but with enough time in between for some introspection.The first part of Karnow's book deals with the long history of the Vietnamese as a people in their various provincial enclaves, or as a national entity, to be independent of the many other powers in the region, particularly China, who wanted to subjugate them. The book also pays detailed attention to the fight among the European colonial powers for dominance in the region culminating in the decisive victory for control by France in the 1800's. That domination by a Western imperialist power, ultimately defeated by the same Communist and nationalist forces that were to defeat the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies, sets the stage for the huge role that the United States would come to play from the time of the French defeat in 1954 until their own defeat a couple of decades later. This section is important to read because the premises of the French about their adversary became, in almost cookie-cutter fashion, the same premises that drove American policy. And to similar ends.The bulk of the book and the central story line, however, is a study of the hubris of American imperialist policy-makers in attempting to define their powers, prerogatives and interests in the post-World War II period. The sub-title of the book, which the current inhabitants of the Bush Administration obviously have not read and in any case would willfully misunderstand, is how not to subordinate primary interests to momentary secondary interests in the scramble to preserve the Empire.Apparently, common sense and simple rationality are in short supply when one goes inside the Washington Beltway. Taking into account the differences in personality among the three main villains of the piece- Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon- the similarities of response and need to defend some sense of honor, American honor, are amazingly similar, individual rhetoric aside. There thus can be little wonder the North Vietnamese went about their business of revolution and independence pretty much according to their plans and with little regard to `subtleties' in American diplomacy. But, read the book and judge for yourselves. Do not be surprised if something feels awfully, awfully familiar.",5,The Lessons of Vietnam?,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,9072,"['DVD', 'REVIEWI', 'have', 'previously', 'reviewed', 'Stanley',

It is a non-stop marathon of philo-totalitarianism, apologetics for tyranny, whitewashing of mass murder, and outright lies, such as claiming the Khmer Rouge were American supported.  (They only recieved American assistance when they were out of power and a small part of an ad hoc group of armed bands harassing the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; during their oft-denied - by anti-war leftists like Noam Chomsky - autogenocide of millions of their own citizens, the Khmer Rouge were squarely in the communist bloc.)  There is an excellent overview of some of the - failed - attempts by other filmmakers to provide balance or rebuttal to this ugly piece of work in the book PBS:BEHIND THE SCREEN, which is highly recommended to anyone who wants an objective look at how public broadcasting conducts itself.  This film is more than bad, it is a morally vile apologia for the tyrannical subjugation of an entire country and the murder or exile of well over a million people, and the demonization of those - American and Vietnamese alike - who sought to prevent precisely that eventuality.  This film is the moral equivalent of Holocaust denial, and ought to viewed as such by anyone who watches it.",1,MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE LIES,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,1314,"['be', 'one', 'most', 'flagrantly', 'biased', 'dishonest', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'air', 'American', 'television', 'non-stop', 'marathon', 'philo-totalitarianism', 'apologetics', 'tyranny', 'whitewashing', 'mass', 'murder', 'outright', 'lies', 'such', 'claiming', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'were', 'American', 'supported', 'only', 'recieved', 'American', 'assistance', 'when', 'were', 'out', 'power', 'small', 'part', 'ad', 'hoc', 'group', 'armed', 'bands', 'harassing', 'Vietnamese', 'occupation', 'Cambodia', 'oft-denied', 'anti-war', 'leftists', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'autogenocide', 'millions', 'own', 'citizens', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'were', 'squarely', 'communist', 'bloc', 'excellent', 'overview', 'failed', 'attempts', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'provide', 'balance', 'rebuttal', 'ugly', 'piece', 'work', 'book', 'PBS', 'THE', 'SCREEN', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'objective', 'look', 'how', 'public', 'broadcasting', 'film', 'more', 'bad', 'morally', 'vile', 'apologia', 'tyrannical', 'subjugation', 'entire', 'country', 'murder', 'exile', 'well', 'million', 'people', 'demonization', 'American', 'Vietnamese', 'who', 'sought', 'prevent', 'precisely', 'eventuality', 'film', 'moral', 'equivalent', 'Holocaust', 'denial', 'ought', 'viewed', 'such', 'anyone', 'who']",Vietnam - A Television History VHS
424193,A5XSJUFT4KU82,6304462522,D. A. Frost,"[457, 464]","I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired on PBS in 1983 and I taped the whole thing. So when it came out on DVD I thought I'd invest in the new format, seeing as my tapes were now 20 years old and I wanted to be able to watch it again and share it with others without fear of it disintegrating.Boy, was I in for a letdown. First of all, this edition is loaded with commercials. That's right, commercials. That was the last thing I expected to see on an expensive DVD set. But no, every episode is prefaced with no less than 2 commercials: one for Liberty Mutual and one for the Scott lawn care company. I could have lived with a brief mention of the companies that funded the series, but not only are these full-blown commercials, they aren't even the companies that funded the making of the series! WGBH has sold commercial time to companies who had nothing to do with the making of this docmentary. If that weren't enough, we get to see the same commercials at the end of every episode, followed by a plug for PBS. I paid $60 for this???But the most shocking thing about this set is that it's been edited down from the original series. I couldn't believe it. I haven't had a chance to compare every episode on the DVD set with my old tapes, but there is a segment near the end of episode 1 that has been deleted. In the original episode 1, a French colonel being interviewed about Dien Bien Phu talks about the end of the infamous seige and refers to the Viet Minh as &quot;Red Termites&quot;. This has been lopped off the DVD version. I can only dismay at the thought of other expurgations. Was it purged for political correctness or to make room for the commercials? I can't say. I don't yet know if the other episodes are similarly truncated, but in my opinion none of them should have been. This series is too important to let commercial expediency diminish its journalistic integrity.Thank goodness I still have my old tapes. Now I think I will digitize them onto DVD so I can preserve the work in the form the film maker intended.",2,Big Disappointment,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2049,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'PBS', '1983', 'taped', 'whole', 'thing', 'So', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'thought', ""'d"", 'invest', 'new', 'format', 'seeing', 'tapes', 'were', 'now', '20', 'years', 'old', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'again', 'share', 'others', 'fear', 'disintegrating.Boy', 'was', 'letdown', 'First', 'all', 'edition', 'loaded', 'commercials', 'right', 'commercials', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'expected', 'see', 'expensive', 'DVD', 'set', 'episode', 'prefaced', 'less', '2', 'commercials', 'one', 'Liberty', 'Mutual', 'one', 'Scott', 'lawn', 'care', 'company', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'brief', 'mention', 'companies', 'funded', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'full-blown', 'commercials', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'companies', 'funded', 'making', 'series', 'WGBH', 'sold', 'commercial', 'time', 'companies', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'making', 'docmentary', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'get', 'see', 'same', 'commercials', 'end', 'episode', 'followed', 'plug', 'PBS', 'paid', '60', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'set', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'original', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'compare', 'episode', 'DVD', 'set', 'old', 'tapes', 'segment', 'end', 'episode', '1', 'been', 'deleted', 'original', 'episode', '1', 'French', 'colonel', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Dien', 'Bien', 'Phu', 'talks', 'end', 'infamous', 'seige', 'refers', 'Viet', 'Minh', 'quot', 'Red', 'Termites', 'quot', 'been', 'lopped', 'off', 'DVD', 'version', 'can', 'only', 'dismay', 'thought', 'other', 'expurgations', 'Was', 'purged', 'political', 'correctness', 'make', 'room', 'commercials', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'similarly', 'truncated', 'opinion', 'none', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'too', 'important', 'let', 'commercial', 'expediency', 'diminish', 'journalistic', 'integrity.Thank', 'goodness', 'still', 'have', 'old', 'tapes', 'Now', 'think', 'will', 'digitize', 'DVD', 'can', 'preserve', 'work', 'form', 'film', 'maker', 'intended']",Vietnam - A Television History VHS

There are 3 episodes on each DVD; each episode is about 50 minutes long (and the time went by quickly for me). It starts with a history of Vietnam before the USA got involved, and I found that to be very helpful. It gradually walks through the beginnings of the war and follows it through to the end, including the unrest within the USA regarding the war itself.Sometimes there is overlap between episodes...not the same footage, but similar topics.  However, it didn't occur enough to be annoying or repetitive. There is about 2 minutes of introductions and commercials at the beginning of each episode, but it's easy to fast forward through it.Some of the images are quite graphic and disturbing, but I'm glad they included them in the series, since they help to underscore the tragedy of war.The narrator is easy to understand.

It is the usual flash, trash, hype, and jive.  Rare events are featured which gives the viewer the impression that they were common.  Here is a hypothetical example.  A police officer kills an innocent person on purpose.  The program then implies that this is commonly done and is the official policy of the police agency and the US government advisors and the reason you never heard about these widespread killings was that there was an official government coverup.  The most useful thing you can do with this is to compare the information presented with the memoirs of Henry Kissinger and the books listed below.  This should cure you of ever believing what is presented in the news.Here is one example of the misrepresentation in the program.  You may remember the famous photo of the captured person being shot in the head.  This program calls him a Vietcong.  In reality this person was a regular North Vietnamese Army officer whose assignment was to kill the family members of South Vietnamese officials.  The Geneva Convention on Land Warfare requires combatants to wear distinctive uniforms.  It allows the killing of captured members of the other side who were not wearing distinctive uniforms.Another example of stupid comments is on one operation where the Marines went into an enemy stronghold to destroy the supplies and tunnel complexes and then leave.  The narrator makes the stupid comment that the enemy soldiers returned to the area after the Marines left as if the Marines had not accomplished their mission.It is common for government heads to say one thing in speeches and do another in private.  Saudi Arabia is an example in the recent middle east war.  Public speeches said that they would not help the US forces.  In private they allowed use of their bases.  This program shows similar speeches without commenting on what happened in private.  Cambodia is an example where they wanted out help against the North Vietnamese presence but gave speeches to the opposite.The Pentagon PapersA Rumor of WarDecent IntervalDecision for DisasterYou will learn from The Pentagon Papers that President Johnson was quite aggressive in escalating the war against the advice of the CIA and other agencies and that he would make decisions on his own without consultation.  This program gives the false inference that President Johnson was pulled into the war reluctantly and by others.The book Decision for Disaster is by an insider on the Bay of Pigs invasion.  You will learn about how unskilled the Kennedy white house staff and appointed state department officials were.  This same poor judgement carried over into the administration's policy in Vietnam.I was an army lieutenant in Vietnam and what is presented in this program is nothing near what I saw and did.",1,journalism and not history,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2886,"['usual', 'journalistic', 'mixture', 'important', 'trivial', 'direct', 'falsehoods', 'falsehoods', 'omission', 'usual', 'flash', 'trash', 'hype', 'jive', 'Rare', 'events', 'are', 'featured', 'viewer', 'impression', 'were', 'common', 'Here', 'hypothetical', 'example', 'police', 'officer', 'innocent', 'person', 'purpose', 'program', 'then', 'commonly', 'done', 'official', 'policy', 'police', 'agency', 'US', 'government', 'advisors', 'reason', 'never', 'heard', 'widespread', 'killings', 'was', 'was', 'official', 'government', 'coverup', 'most', 'useful', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'compare', 'information', 'presented', 'memoirs', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'books', 'listed', 'below', 'should', 'cure', 'ever', 'believing', 'what', 'presented', 'news.Here', 'one', 'example', 'misrepresentation', 'program', 'may', 'remember', 'famous', 'photo', 'captured', 'person', 'being', 'shot', 'head', 'program', 'Vietcong', 'reality', 'person', 'was', 'regular', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'officer', 'assignment', 'was', 'kill', 'family', 'members', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'officials', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'Land', 'Warfare', 'combatants', 'wear', 'distinctive', 'uniforms', 'killing', 'captured', 'members', 'other', 'side', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'wearing', 'distinctive', 'uniforms.Another', 'example', 'stupid', 'comments', 'one', 'operation', 'where', 'Marines', 'went', 'enemy', 'stronghold', 'destroy', 'supplies', 'tunnel', 'complexes', 'then', 'leave', 'narrator', 'stupid', 'comment', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'returned', 'area', 'Marines', 'left', 'Marines', 'had', 'not', 'accomplished', 'mission.It', 'common', 'government', 'heads', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'speeches', 'do', 'private', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'example', 'recent', 'middle', 'east', 'war', 'Public', 'speeches', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'help', 'US', 'forces', 'private', 'allowed', 'use', 'bases', 'program', 'similar', 'speeches', 'commenting', 'happened', 'private', 'Cambodia', 'example', 'where', 'wanted', 'out', 'help', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'presence', 'gave', 'speeches', 'opposite.The', 'Pentagon', 'PapersA', 'Rumor', 'WarDecent', 'IntervalDecision', 'DisasterYou', 'will', 'learn', 'Pentagon', 'Papers', 'President', 'Johnson', 'was', 'quite', 'aggressive', 'escalating', 'war', 'advice', 'CIA', 'other', 'agencies', 'would', 'make', 'decisions', 'own', 'consultation', 'program', 'false', 'inference', 'President', 'Johnson', 'was', 'pulled', 'war', 'reluctantly', 'others.The', 'book', 'Decision', 'Disaster', 'insider', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'unskilled', 'Kennedy', 'white', 'house', 'staff', 'appointed', 'state', 'department', 'officials', 'were', 'same', 'poor', 'judgement', 'carried', 'administration', 'policy', 'Vietnam.I', 'was', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'presented', 'program', 'nothing', 'what', 'saw', 'did']",Vietnam - A Television History VHS
424197,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,6304462522,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[53, 105]","In the 1980s when I first viewed this PBS series, from Boston's very liberal WGBH and produced/directed by a well-known leftist, I was somewhat ambivalent about it, not fully comfortable with its presentation, but unable to put my finger on what bothered me about it.  Today, some 15 years older and wiser, having studied history in some detail and being aware of Communism's 100 million victims during the 20th Century, I decided to take a fresh look.  I purchased the series on VHS videotape through eBay, as the DVD version was not then available -- which was a good thing as those videotapes preserved a lot of stuff which was NOT transferred to the DVD version.Notably, at the time of the first VHS release, there was some protest against the PBS ""documentary"", claims that it was highly biased towards the Vietnamese communists, and so the producers added short notes at the end of the videotapes, indicating where one might find those sources of contrary opinion, and rebuttals to the PBS series.  Those important end-notes have vanished from the DVD version, which I subsequently purchased to have a better quality reproduction for my historical archive.  The DVD version will therefore leave the viewer with the false impression there never was such a loud howl of protest as actually happened.  So I will repeat here several of the more important corrective end-notes, as have been censored off the DVD version, and to which the intelligent reviewer will naturally want to consult.Firstly and foremost, there is the book ""Losers Are Pirates"" edited by James Banerian, with contributions from ""Vietnamese refugees living in the USA"".  This book goes through the PBS ""Vietnam TV History"" series, section by section, stripping away its phoney objectivity, revealing the lies and half-truths, and more seriously the Lies Of Omission (the worst kind of lie, as Orwell noted).  For specific example, the PBS-WGBH series hardly informs the viewer of the vast evidence of Ho Chi Minh's deep commitment to Red Fascism, his years of study with communist cells in Paris, and later in Moscow and Beijing.  Nor does it educate about Ho's assassination program , which he participated in and later led after his return to Vietnam, during the chaotic years of French colonial rule, exterminating most of the pro-Vietnamese nationalist leaders who held democratic sentiments.  Ho wanted a communist totalitarian state from the get-go, but none of the documentation on that is ever presented.  Instead, Ho is falsely misportrayed as a ""Vietnamese Nationalist"", even as he was guilty of assassinating nationalist leaders.  Not to blame American leftists entirely, this was the cover story fabricated by the Vietnamese communists themselves.  Capitalizing on legitimate Vietnamese nationalist fervor, Ho Chi Minh created a gigantic illusion and lie about himself and his motivations, leading his people into a communist nightmare, leaving behind a trail of corpses,  complete with ""land reform"" programs which basically turned all colonial lands into state lands, abandoning the peasants except to forcibly organize them into communist agricultural communes, complete with thought-control, neighborhood spy systems, village level ""people's trials"", and with the inevitable firing squads.  Mass graves began to fill in Northern Vietnamese regions controlled by the communists, with anyone who dared to object, including whole families who tried to flee to French-held non-communist territory.None of this is detailed in the series, however.  Similarly not described, the repeated communist violations of treaty agreements made with the ""capitalist enemy"" of the south -- the Geneva Accords, the Paris Accords, and minor truces of all sorts -- were nearly immediately violated by the North Vietnamese, and their created Viet Cong cadres in the South.  The evidence for the Viet Cong being fabricated, controlled and by the North Vietnamese communists also is never detailed.  While many discontented Vietnamese nationalists joined the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, often as not, after being exposed to their propaganda and methods, the flow of desertions in the other direction was just as brisk.  But none of the testimony from Vietnamese officials or citizens on this important issue is revealed.  No hint of dissention on such issues ever appears, which are nearly uniformly cast as ""fact"" purely on the basis of testimony or claims from communist sources -- revealing how the PBS producers were NOT interested in objetivity, presenting both sides, but only that which would support the communists, and misportray the French and USA as villans.  Likewise, the NVA/VC terrorism in South Vietnam always exceeded, by perhaps a factor of 10, anything ever done by the USA during Operation Phoenix.  Viet Cong massacres of entire families of South Vietnamese officials, with public beheadings and disembowlments in the nature of the Fallujah criminals,  are never mentioned, even though this was a major terror tactic of the Viet Cong -- and one of the pre-existing factors which led to the creation of Operation Phoenix, which aimed to assassinate Viet Cong leaders.  Likewise, the massacre at Hue -- where NVA and VC forces executed something between 3-5000 civilians in cold blood -- is but one of many similar examples which are glossed over in the Vietnam TV History series.  Old communist thugs, sneering with pride at their butchery, are interviewed in such cases, without identifying who they really are, and it is misportrayed as if ""ordinary civilians"" are being interviewed, rather than high-up communist party officials, or spies who lived in Hue only to emerge after the NVA forces took over, helping after to ""round up"" the government workers and their families who would be shot in the head and dumped into pits in the jungle.  And so on.  ""Losers Are Pirates"" is filled with documentation and eye-witness testimony on the events NOT covered in this phoney PBS ""TV history"", which was a heart-break for all the refugees who survived the nightmare of communist aggression in SE Asia.Events DURING and AFTER the fall of South Vietnam are likewise obliterated from open discussion. For example, the full-scale NVA invasion (who were fully equipped with Soviet and Chinese tanks, artillery, troops, etc., in total violation once again of every treaty agreement) are NOT covered in the DVD version, supporting the overall lie that a communist victory was inevitable, and no treaty violation was worth to mention if that violation brought the communists closer to power.  In fact, the entire last segment  of the PBS series, titled ""Legacies"" which appeared in the VHS version, is NOT repeated on the DVD version.  Why would the PBS-WGBH producers leave out an entire segment of the original production?  Because ""Legacies"" was produced late in the series, after the first segments had been shown on USA television and after those segments had triggered the legitimate outrage from so many American military and Vietnamese refugees, who had lived through all those terrible events, and knew what was being lied about, and omitted.  So, ""Legacies"" was created to present at least some of the ""dark side"" of the communist victory.  It detailed some aspects of the miserable Boat People, hundreds of thousands of ""liberated"" Vietnamese risking death on the high seas just to escape the communist paradise.  You can still buy ""Legacies"" on VHS, separately, but even this small begrudging admission of communist crimes (white-washed as they were in ""Legacies"") was ""too much"" for PBS to include today.  ""Legacies""  also details the communist genocide in Cambodia -- sort of -- like Noam Chomsky, they cannot quite bring themselves to admit that millions were massacred by the communists, and of course they try to blame it all on the USA, even though it was communists who were pulling the triggers, and strangling victims in every case.The facts of Pol Pot's totally communist origins, his links to the Vietnamese communists and hence to Moscow and Beijing, is again glossed over and distorted, with emphasis placed on his much later disagreements and power-struggles with fellow Vietnamese communists.  Likewise, Sianouk's hate for democratic America, and love of the dictatorial communists is totally ignored.  Even ""Legacies"" fails to mention such ""small details"" as the tens of thousands of ordinary Vietnamese who were slaughtered during the last months of the war, in Vietnam, being deliberately machine-gunned and pounded by artillery as they fled along narrow roads leading south, away from the advancing NVA military.  The ""Highway of Terror"", where one had to carefully step over the corpses of women and children scattered mile after mile along the roads -- perhaps 50,000 dead civilians within a few days... but really, the photos of that atrocity are buried in North Vietnamese archives, never released to the public.  Much easier to point to Mai Lai.  But... this is ""ancient history"", and nobody wants to hear it today.Vietnam TV History instead displays numerous interviews with self-righteous communist cadres and old war-criminal Vietnamese generals, who give their ""heroic"" side of things, always with the smear against the USA and French, and distortion of fact and events -- as if only North Americans are liars, while Vietnamese communists can always be trusted to tell the truth --  but the producers don't even make the slightest attempt to counter their bald propaganda by  interviews with non-communist Vietnamese leaders, or by US generals or troops, except in ways that are calculated to make them appear as evil, stupid, cowardly, sadistic, and so forth.  No such prejudicial treatment is afforded to the communists, however!  Even the occasional racist or rapacious statement by a communist official is translated into English so as to ""tone it down"", always to make them appear as ""rational"", ""feeling"", ""knowledgable"" and ""honest"".  Only native Vietnamese-speakers will pick up on this, which is where ""Losers Are Pirates"" educates.  Exactly the opposite treatment is given by the PBS directors to American and South Vietnamese officials.The producers even use old East German and NVA propaganda movies, without identifying them as such, as if they are ""real"" battle-scenes!  And of course, how heroic the VC and NVA appear -- one never hears Ho Chi Minh roaring that ""he"" would willingly sacrifice the entire generation of Vietnamese Youth, and fight for 20 or 30 years if necessary, to secure a Red Fascist communist paradise., much as Hitler or Stalin screeched from their podiums, nor do we see any quotes from Chairman Ho praising Stalin and his cruel methods.  And one also never hears much about Laos, which was gobbled up by the Vietnamese communists, nor about the very many good things of South Vietnam -- its chaotic but vital democracy, the freedom of speech and of the press which existed, the higher GNP, food production, standard of living, etc., etc., which they held over the communist North... all that is distorted as well, as the South Vietnamese are misportrayed as drug-pushers, prostitutes, parasites living off American military encampments, secretly sympathetic to the communists, and cowards on the battlefield.  One wonders why the Tet offensive failed so miserably, as NOT ONE South Vietnamese city rose up to join the communist forces against the Americans -- perhaps because the VC during Tet had the bad habit of shooting rockets and mortar shells into residential neighborhoods of the cities they wanted to ""liberate""? -- and even after the fall of the South, so many Vietnamese took to boats or fled on foot, to escape what everyone knew was coming when the communists took over.  Many died in the escape attempts, and others who were caught trying to escape also faced death. Death camps (excuse me, ""re-education camps""), totalitarianism, controls over press, speech, thinking, actions, work, neighborhood spys, restrictions on travel, listening to foreign radio, etc., etc.  ""Vietnam TV History"" mentions nothing of any of this.  Any wonder why ordinary Vietnamese often behave so friendly towards Americans who visit Vietnam?Ho Chi Minh is always misportrayed as a gentle old fellow, loving of his countrymen, in his heart wanting a Jeffersonian democracy for Vietnam, but thwarted by those mean old Americans --- one wonders how it went so wrong, how Cambodia slipped into genocidal butchery, and so forth with so many well-intentioned enlightened communists being in control, and all the evil capitalist being driven out.  Of course, this is balderdash, and the butchery which gripped SE Asia after the fall of non-communist South Vietnam is totally the responsibility of the victorious communist forces, who after the war could have shaped events however they wished.  And they did, which is why genocidal butchery occurred!  That is what they wanted!  History shows, that is fairly standard practice whenever communists take over.Another rebuttal documentary is the VHS production ""Television's Vietnam: The Real Story"" and ""Televisions's Vietnam: The Impact of the Media"", which detail how our major news figures -- such as Walter Cronkite -- basically repeated the communist propaganda, helping to seal the fate of the South Vietnamese.  Don't believe it?  Get these documentaries and judge for yourself.  Both are available on a single VHS casette from Accuracy In Media [...]  This VHS, and the ""Legacies"" VHS, and the ""Losers Are Pirates"" book are necessary reading, assuming you want the facts.Don't take my word for anything, but don't believe the ""standard lies"" of the left-wing on this subject either. Educate yourself, by reading the penetrating analysis as given in these rebuttals.  Dig  deeper than the shallow propaganda presented in this PBS series. That is, assuming fact and truth hold meaning for you.  For the producers of this PBS series, fact and truth meant nothing.",1,Radical Left Pro-Communist Propaganda,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,13963,"['1980s', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'PBS', 'series',

U.S. Presidents really believed their Domino Theory.  (This is absolutely clear in press conferences with Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.)  They thought that stopping Communism with worth just about any cost.For the Vietnamese (or most of them), the war was just another in a long string of struggles against colonial domination--against China, France, Japan, France again, and finally the U.S.The series rightly stresses the U.S. refusal to allow a nationwide democratic vote in Vietnam in 1956--because the U.S. knew Ho Chi Minh, a revered anti-colonialist since the 1920s, would win.Thus the U.S. was in the absurd position of preaching democracy in words but denying it in fact.The U.S. supported a string of anti-democratic rulers in South Vietnam--some more obedient to Washington, some less, but all completely dependent on U.S. backing, since they did not have the backing of their own people.One of the most telling moments comes when Earhardt, a volunteer private in the Marines who joined early and was fully convinced he was helping his country, comes to the stunning realization, ""I was a Redcoat.
