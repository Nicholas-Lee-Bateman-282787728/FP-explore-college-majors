But I got really surprised... this season renovated 90210 as a good dramatic, full of twists series.

Currently mine is Teddy, played by Trevor Donovan and I like how the character grow up during the whole season (and not only told/showed in on or two episodes).The events who happen to any characters are really realistic: Teddy has a one-night-stand to a person who has open relationship and is going to a difficult time, a teacher who has his baby in the school (and I mean it: I had personally a teacher who brought his baby into his class!) and any more things.Well, Teddy's character is very well played (and has nothing to do with actors real life!!!!). Also the other cast member are playing very well their parts. Interesting is Naomis character who was (we remember) raped on the end of the 2nd Season by Teacher Cannon.The Episode ""Catch me if you Cannon"" is a word play from the movie ""Catch me if you can"" (with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks).As special guest we have this time: Nelly, Snoop Dog, and Sally Kellerman (""The Boston Strangler"" 1968), ""Bonanza"", ""Star Trek""), and again Kelly Lynch. In a small role: Robert Gant (""Queer as Folk"") as Doctor and Alan Ritchson (who was ""Aquaman"" in ""Smallville).Fazit: each story or character has his + and - like in the real world.THE DVD:Sound and picture are again very good and has english and other subtitles!!!  Also interesting are the Bonus-Features: contains any audio-commentaries with the Cast-Members and any short documentaries where running between five and nine minutes.

1351806,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B003L77GEM,barry,"[5, 5]","The third season of 90210 is definitely the best so far as the show fully fell into a great pace. The show is a definite guilty pleasure. You have an attractive cast with basically light, entertaining plot lines. Many plot lines last just an episode or two but this year we also had some very entertaining twist turning plot lines that were ongoing all season.  This basic premise works so well because the cast can really act. They take these varying plot lines and by making the characters so real and full of depth it all works. Also this season managed to show some extra superb acting.  AnnaLynne McCord as Naomi worked magic with the rape story line. Her performance made the well written story rise even higher. Superb.Everyone will have their favorite characters. For me I love Jessica Stroup as Silver and Michael Steger as Navid. To unite them as a couple made the show that much more of a treat for me. Of course we have the bad girl in Adrianna and the good girl in Annie. Both do their roles great justice.  And the love triangle of Adrianna, Silver and Navid was indeed a highlight this season.  The marriage of Ivy came out of an unexpected deep story line and gave the often overlooked Gillian Zinser a chance to shine in a very emotional plot development.With 90210 you will be greatly entertained by people you wish were your friends. If you don't like a particular story line wait a few episodes for it may just be wrapped up.

However, since I am a fan of budding, new young actor, Evan Ross and he appears as ""Charlie"", the long lost brother. In a limited role, he plays Shenae Grimes love interest to warm effect. His character was an author of intense mysteries. He was also a bit of an intellectual.Unfortunately, after Evan's role ended my interest began to wane.But the 10 weeks that he was on, was worthy of me investing in the DVD.This exposure only widens Mr. Ross' stature as he continues to build a great career. He has matinee idol looks. He has a youthful aura offering hin opportunities to play a role close to his age, like ""Charlie"" here during his ""90210 2010-11"". Or he can play a youth like his debut starring role in ""ATL"" and his role in ""Gardens of the Night"". He can play an adorable, sensitive teen as in ""According to Greta"" or his critically acclaimed, menace of a teenager in the excellent, but, unsettling ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"".But Charlie is probably his most mainstream role and a great launching pad to continue his  3-6 movies a year since 2006.",4,Evan Ross shines in a 10 Episode Run,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1160,"['only', 'watched', 'original', '90210', 'occasionally', 'interest', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'lasted', 'little', 'longer', 'However', 'am', 'fan', 'budding', 'new', 'young', 'actor', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'Charlie', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'limited', 'role', 'Shenae', 'Grimes', 'love', 'interest', 'warm', 'effect', 'character', 'was', 'author', 'intense', 'mysteries', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'intellectual.Unfortunately', 'Evan', 'role', 'ended', 'interest', 'began', 'wane.But', '10', 'weeks', 'was', 'was', 'worthy', 'investing', 'DVD.This', 'exposure', 'only', 'Mr.', 'Ross', 'stature', 'build', 'great', 'career', 'matinee', 'idol', 'looks', 'youthful', 'aura', 'offering', 'hin', 'opportunities', 'play', 'role', 'close', 'age', 'Charlie', 'here', '90210', '2010-11', 'can', 'play', 'youth', 'debut', 'starring', 'role', 'ATL', 'role', 'Gardens', 'Night', 'can', 'play', 'adorable', 'sensitive', 'teen', 'According', 'Greta', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'menace', 'teenager', 'excellent', 'unsettling', 'Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', '.But', 'Charlie', 'probably', 'most', 'mainstream', 'role', 'great', 'launching', 'pad', 'continue', '3-6', 'movies', 'year', '2006']",N/A

1351815,A3HGUIK1D2ITTN,B003L77GEM,Midan &quot;The Reviewer&quot; Allen,"[1, 5]","I began watching ""90210"" in June 2010 -- exactly one year ago. The first season intrigued me a little, so I went and picked it up at Best Buy. I finished the entire series that weekend, and pursued the second season (which had finished airing weeks prior). Let me just say: nothing will EVER compare to the first season.The characters of ""90210"" had chemistry (emphasis on the ""had""), and now it's to the point where I, the viewer, could care less about them. The writing has went downhill since the superb first season, and I'm pretty annoyed. NOTE: I'm actually watching season one as I write this!So, the third season kicks off with Naomi's downfall after her rape; Dixon and Annie cope with their father Harry and his departure; Adrianna realizes that there is nothing like ""show"" business -- and it is senior year at West Bev!Some new and old faces return with their drama, sparking some relevant interest, but it doesn't make me want to tune in every week. As a loyal fan of the series, I am going to purchase the third season DVD because there were some pretty good episodes -- but overall, it wasn't great. A lot of guest stars appear this season, including Evan Ross, Snoop Dogg, the Kardashians, Nelly, and Joe Jonas.I will let you know right now that Oscar -- Ivy's foreign friend who moves to West Bev -- will more than likely win you over with his sneaky, devilish charm as he tries to steal her away from Dixon. Liam and Annie connect for the first time, but Charlie (his witty half-brother who directs) woos Annie away from him. Adrianna begins taking an interest back in Navid, but he has his sights set on one of the ""90210"" gals we've grown to love. Silver loses it again, but it is not nearly as iconic nor chilling as her first performance in season one. Teddy reveals a great secret about his life and his reason for moving to West Bev. Naomi begins to regain confidence in herself, only to be knocked down again -- also sparking an out-of-the-norm love interest in a nerdy student. Ryan becomes accustomed to parenthood, and Jen runs away from him because of her lack of responsibilities.It is okay to own this set, but if you are unsure whether or not to buy it -- watch it first and judge the third season for yourself. It had a so-so start, as with the second season, but I think incorporating more characters and ignoring/writing out the great chemistry between the originals sells the series short.What happened to this show? It's pretty sad. And no, I will not be paying $40 to get this boxed set when it releases.When it goes on sale for $18.99, I'll let you know when it's on my shelf.DETAILS:--90210, the Third Season22 Full-length Episodes on Six DiscsAudio Commentaries from the CastBehind the ScenesFeaturettes--Grade: C-",3,It is becoming more and more undistinguished...,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,2755,"['began', 'watching', '90210', 'June', '2010', 'exactly', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'first', 'season', 'intrigued', 'little', 'went', 'picked', 'up', 'Best', 'Buy', 'finished', 'entire', 'series', 'weekend', 'pursued', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'finished', 'airing', 'weeks', 'prior', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'nothing', 'will', 'EVER', 'compare', 'first', 'season.The', 'characters', '90210', 'had', 'chemistry', 'emphasis', 'had', 'now', 'point', 'where', 'viewer', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'writing', 'went', 'downhill', 'superb', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'annoyed', 'NOTE', ""'m"", 'actually', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'write', 'So', 'third', 'season', 'kicks', 'off', 'Naomi', 'downfall', 'rape', 'Dixon', 'Annie', 'cope', 'father', 'Harry', 'departure', 'Adrianna', 'nothing', 'show', 'business', 'senior', 'year', 'West', 'Bev', 'new', 'old', 'return', 'drama', 'sparking', 'relevant', 'interest', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'tune', 'week', 'loyal', 'fan', 'series', 'am', 'going', 'purchase', 'third', 'season', 'DVD', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'episodes', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'lot', 'guest', 'stars', 'appear', 'season', 'including', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Kardashians', 'Nelly', 'Joe', 'Jonas.I', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'right', 'now', 'Oscar', 'Ivy', 'foreign', 'friend', 'who', 'West', 'Bev', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'win', 'over', 'sneaky', 'devilish', 'charm', 'steal', 'away', 'Dixon', 'Liam', 'Annie', 'connect', 'first', 'time', 'Charlie', 'witty', 'half-brother', 'who', 'woos', 'Annie', 'away', 'Adrianna', 'taking', 'interest', 'back', 'Navid', 'sights', 'set', 'one', '90210', 'gals', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'Silver', 'again', 'not', 'nearly', 'iconic', 'chilling', 'first', 'performance', 'season', 'one', 'Teddy', 'great', 'secret', 'life', 'reason', 'moving', 'West', 'Bev', 'Naomi', 'regain', 'confidence', 'herself', 'only', 'be', 'knocked', 'down', 'again', 'also', 'sparking', 'out-of-the-norm', 'love', 'interest', 'nerdy', 'student', 'Ryan', 'accustomed', 'parenthood', 'Jen', 'away', 'lack', 'responsibilities.It', 'okay', 'own', 'set', 'are', 'unsure', 'not', 'buy', 'watch', 'first', 'judge', 'third', 'season', 'had', 'so-so', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'think', 'incorporating', 'more', 'characters', 'ignoring/writing', 'out', 'great', 'chemistry', 'originals', 'series', 'short.What', 'happened', 'show', 'pretty', 'sad', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'paying', '40', 'get', 'boxed', 'set', 'when', 'releases.When', 'sale', '18.99', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'when', 'shelf.DETAILS', '90210', 'Third', 'Season22', 'Full-length', 'Episodes', 'Six', 'DiscsAudio', 'Commentaries', 'CastBehind', 'ScenesFeaturettes', 'Grade', 'C-']",N/A
1351816,A2GG3RUAMHF0KX,B003L77GEM,Mohit G.,"[1, 1]","The best season so far and surprisingly good storyline's. Once again, the focus is on Naomi throughout the season (I don't care much for her). She deals with the aftermath of her rape and gets terrorized by Mr. Cannon, who by the way is a terrific actor! Then she falls in love with a GEEK, Max. Frankly, the Naomi/Max storyline was very unrealistic. It's so not Naomi to fall for a geek. The cliffhanger too is about Naomi/Max as she tells him that she's pregnant in the finale. Once again, boring! It's already done with Adrianna. Moving on, Silver and Navid out of all people got into a relationship and it turns out that Michael Steger and Jessica Stroup have good chemistry. Navid and Dixon get into the music business. This arc was cool and Michael/Tristan have good comic moments. The Silver/Navid arc also brought out a true problem these days which is underage girls in porn. Adrianna...well...Adrianna brings all the drama to the show. She falls from being a pop diva to a manipulative, lying and conniving person who goes all out to destroy Silver. The Silver/Ade rivalry is fun to watch. Dixon takes the backseat in the later part of the season and in the beginning he breaks up with Ivy. Nothing much here. Annie and Liam get it on this season. Annie gets it on with Liam's estranged brother as well. These two are great together. The finale sees Liam going off on a fishing boat for the summer and the two kiss. What made this season so great was Teddy's coming out storyline. Beautifully handled. Great acting by Trevor Donovan. SO realistic and common these days. Overall, despite the irritable Naomi, everything was pretty great this season.PS: I know I missed Ivy but she is a pointless character who should have been cut from the show instead of Trevor (Teddy).",4,The Best Season so far... **CONTAINS SPOILERS**,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1780,"['best', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'storyline', 'Once', 'again', 'focus', 'Naomi', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'aftermath', 'rape', 'terrorized', 'Mr.', 'Cannon', 'who', 'way', 'terrific', 'actor', 'Then', 'love', 'GEEK', 'Max', 'Frankly', 'Naomi/Max', 'storyline', 'was', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'so', 'not', 'Naomi', 'fall', 'geek', 'cliffhanger', 'too', 'about', 'Naomi/Max', 'pregnant', 'finale', 'Once', 'again', 'boring', 'already', 'done', 'Adrianna', 'Moving', 'Silver', 'Navid', 'people', 'got', 'relationship', 'out', 'Michael', 'Steger', 'Jessica', 'Stroup', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Navid', 'Dixon', 'get', 'music', 'business', 'arc', 'was', 'cool', 'Michael/Tristan', 'have', 'good', 'comic', 'moments', 'Silver/Navid', 'arc', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'true', 'problem', 'days', 'underage', 'girls', 'porn', 'Adrianna', 'well', 'Adrianna', 'drama', 'show', 'being', 'pop', 'diva', 'manipulative', 'lying', 'conniving', 'person', 'who', 'destroy', 'Silver', 'Silver/Ade', 'rivalry', 'fun', 'watch', 'Dixon', 'backseat', 'later', 'part', 'season', 'beginning', 'up', 'Ivy', 'Nothing', 'much', 'here', 'Annie', 'Liam', 'get', 'season', 'Annie', 'Liam', 'estranged', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'finale', 'sees', 'Liam', 'going', 'off', 'fishing', 'boat', 'summer', 'two', 'kiss', 'What', 'made', 'season', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'Teddy', 'coming', 'out', 'storyline', 'Beautifully', 'handled', 'Great', 'acting', 'Trevor', 'Donovan', 'SO', 'realistic', 'common', 'days', 'Overall', 'irritable', 'Naomi', 'everything', 'was', 'pretty', 'great', 'season.PS', 'know', 'missed', 'Ivy', 'pointless', 'character', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'show', 'instead', 'Trevor', 'Teddy']",N/A

What needless drama!The characters are all so good-looking on the surface but have such horrible, twisted lifestyles! So shocking to even comprehend that people can degenerate into such animals! Cheating, lying, deceiving one another all the time, never learning any lessons in life, repeating the same mistakes and spiraling into the same cycle again. Is this what America has become today? Not good for the impressionable audience to imitate! The outwardly good-looking actresses just became all the more uglier!....A totally gross series!Stay away from ""90210"".Read:Hell: The Dogma of Hell, Illustrated by Facts Taken from Profane and Sacred History plus How to Avoid Hell",1,Gross,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,729,"['trashed', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'What', 'needless', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'good-looking', 'surface', 'have', 'such', 'horrible', 'twisted', 'lifestyles', 'So', 'shocking', 'even', 'comprehend', 'people', 'can', 'degenerate', 'such', 'animals', 'Cheating', 'lying', 'deceiving', 'one', 'time', 'never', 'learning', 'lessons', 'life', 'repeating', 'same', 'mistakes', 'spiraling', 'same', 'cycle', 'again', 'what', 'America', 'become', 'today', 'Not', 'good', 'impressionable', 'audience', 'imitate', 'outwardly', 'good-looking', 'actresses', 'just', 'became', 'more', 'uglier', 'totally', 'gross', 'series', 'Stay', 'away', '90210', '.Read', 'Hell', 'Dogma', 'Hell', 'Illustrated', 'Facts', 'Taken', 'Profane', 'Sacred', 'History', 'How', 'Avoid', 'Hell']",N/A

I seen her change for the last three years, she is really amazing when she lowered her standards.  I always think of her as a rich, shallow stuck-up snob who was like Blair Waldorf of 90210 and dating a nerd might really help her boost her popularity.  Annie comes from a long way, she's been through a lot for the last year from her car crash and I'm really proud of her and so is Dixon what he's been through with a gambling debt.  To me, I always thought Annie was perfect, but she's not she just like everybody else.  I always can relate to Dixon and Navid in the show, their my kind of guys to hang out with.  Especially Teddy, who comes a womanizer playboy from a gay decent man.  It's about time, they change the style to see what's inside the gay guy lifestyle.  Liam has been through a long way, he kind of took over Ethan's role as the rebel of the show.  Liam is like Ryan Atwood of 90210 on the show.  Silver came a long way, she is like the beautiful hard core rocker of the show, she is like the guy everybody wants to date.  She grew up on the show, born and raised as Kelly Taylor and David Silver half sister on the show. She grew up like her brother, who was creative genes on the show.  She's into flimmaking, music and writing on the show, that's what made every guy fall in love with her on the show.  She's like the girl, every guy wants to marry.  She is like Peyton Sawyer of 90210 on the show.  Our newcomer on the show Max, Max reminds a lot like Navid and Dixon on the show.  Even though he's dating a girl like Naomi, he does have some good looking chops on him.  If he gels his hair, wears Liam's clothes.  He could pass as a teen hearthrob. This show seen a lot of changes, it was really amazing.  What the characters been through, Debbie's divorce with Harry.  Ryan raising his son by himself when Jenn left.  Ryan and Deb also starts dating, the fourth season this is where will be more of the kids and no adults on the show.  We don't know if we get a fifth season, I like to say good luck.",5,90210 season third review,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2139,"['seen', 'lot', 'ups', 'downs', 'season', '3', 'Naomi', 'Clark', 'mean', 'girl', 'victim', 'rape', 'nice', 'girl', 'seen', 'change', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'really', 'amazing', 'when', 'lowered', 'standards', 'always', 'think', 'rich', 'shallow', 'stuck-up', 'snob', 'who', 'was', 'Blair', 'Waldorf', '90210', 'dating', 'nerd', 'might', 'really', 'help', 'boost', 'popularity', 'Annie', 'long', 'way', 'been', 'lot', 'last', 'year', 'car', 'crash', ""'m"", 'really', 'proud', 'so', 'Dixon', 'what', 'been', 'gambling', 'debt', 'always', 'thought', 'Annie', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'always', 'can', 'relate', 'Dixon', 'Navid', 'show', 'kind', 'guys', 'hang', 'out', 'Especially', 'Teddy', 'who', 'womanizer', 'playboy', 'gay', 'decent', 'man', 'time', 'change', 'style', 'see', 'what', 'gay', 'guy', 'lifestyle', 'Liam', 'been', 'long', 'way', 'kind', 'took', 'Ethan', 'role', 'rebel', 'show', 'Liam', 'Ryan', 'Atwood', '90210', 'show', 'Silver', 'came', 'long', 'way', 'beautiful', 'hard', 'core', 'rocker', 'show', 'guy', 'everybody', 'date', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'born', 'raised', 'Kelly', 'Taylor', 'David', 'Silver', 'half', 'sister', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'creative', 'genes', 'show', 'flimmaking', 'music', 'writing', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'guy', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'girl', 'guy', 'marry', 'Peyton', 'Sawyer', '90210', 'show', 'newcomer', 'show', 'Max', 'Max', 'lot', 'Navid', 'Dixon', 'show', 'Even', 'dating', 'girl', 'Naomi', 'have', 'good', 'looking', 'chops', 'hair', 'Liam', 'clothes', 'could', 'pass', 'teen', 'hearthrob', 'show', 'seen', 'lot', 'changes', 'was', 'really', 'amazing', 'What', 'characters', 'been', 'Debbie', 'divorce', 'Harry', 'Ryan', 'raising', 'son', 'when', 'Jenn', 'left', 'Ryan', 'Deb', 'also', 'dating', 'fourth', 'season', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'kids', 'adults', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'get', 'fifth', 'season', 'like', 'say', 'good', 'luck']",N/A

This episode, culminating in this scene is the real Revenge of the Nerds.  It actually makes the years of suffering in high school worth it.  Also, I thank Amazon for keeping the instant video version true to the DVD soundtrack.  The background song in the final scene, ""Mexican Mavis"" by Boy and Bear is the perfect background, almost telling the story by itself.  Another online video purveyor who shall remain nameless, with a red and white logo, has for some strange reason changed the background music for the final scene and the whole power of it gets completely lost.
