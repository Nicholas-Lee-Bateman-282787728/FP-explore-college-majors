I have seen much worse films with much larger budgets. I would like to see this film re-made with a bigger budget and more character development.,3,Shelter DVD review,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,259,"['Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'worth', 'damn', 'thought', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'acting', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'films', 'much', 'larger', 'budgets', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 're-made', 'bigger', 'budget', 'more', 'character', 'development']",Shellter
1397158,A120GIT50UISJP,B004DL0R7I,"Channel KDK12 ""Channel KDK12 - Serious Horror""","[6, 8]","In the midst of preparing for a weekend trip Zoey [Cari Sanders] is suddenly overcome with dizziness and faints. Men with gas masks move in and transfer her to an underground facility that was set up as a nuclear fallout station. Now it's being used to house the survivors of a viral outbreak that had a 99.9% kill rate. A rare few dropped into a deep coma for days before awakening, untouched by the virus. The station is run by a bizarre and sinister doctor [Will Tulin], who is recruiting survivors for his own plan to restore the population of the world. He treats Zoey with kindness at first, but gradually his plan to subordinate her will to his own becomes clear. The question is, will Zoey agree to help him with his plan, or rebel?The real experiments that this story is based on showed that ordinary people could do terrible things in high stress situations when ordered to do so by a superior. Shelter shows us, step by step, how such behavior could occur in an emergency. The relationship between the doctor and Zoey is fascinatingly complex, and the surrealistic, just-over-the-edge presentation of events works very effectively to show how a person could become a monster in a crisis. Shelter will make you ask what you would do, and will not let you off with any easy answers.",4,A fascinating exploration of obedience and rebellion,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,1291,"['midst', 'preparing', 'weekend', 'trip', 'Zoey', '[', 'Cari', 'Sanders', ']', 'suddenly', 'overcome', 'dizziness', 'faints', 'Men', 'gas', 'masks', 'move', 'transfer', 'underground', 'facility', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'nuclear', 'fallout', 'station', 'Now', 'being', 'used', 'house', 'survivors', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'had', '99.9', '%', 'kill', 'rate', 'rare', 'few', 'dropped', 'deep', 'coma', 'days', 'awakening', 'untouched', 'virus', 'station', 'run', 'bizarre', 'sinister', 'doctor', '[', 'Will', 'Tulin', ']', 'who', 'recruiting', 'survivors', 'own', 'plan', 'restore', 'population', 'world', 'Zoey', 'kindness', 'first', 'gradually', 'plan', 'subordinate', 'will', 'own', 'becomes', 'clear', 'question', 'will', 'Zoey', 'agree', 'help', 'plan', 'rebel', 'real', 'experiments', 'story', 'based', 'showed', 'ordinary', 'people', 'could', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'high', 'stress', 'situations', 'when', 'ordered', 'do', 'so', 'superior', 'Shelter', 'step', 'step', 'how', 'such', 'behavior', 'could', 'occur', 'emergency', 'relationship', 'doctor', 'Zoey', 'fascinatingly', 'complex', 'surrealistic', 'just-over-the-edge', 'presentation', 'events', 'works', 'very', 'effectively', 'show', 'how', 'person', 'could', 'become', 'monster', 'crisis', 'Shelter', 'will', 'make', 'ask', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'off', 'easy', 'answers']",Shellter

Especially when interaction between characters is key. The storyline was OK, but executed with weak enthusiasm. Watching was like being stuck in front of a school film. Indies with similar storylines have far surpassed the efforts of Shelter. It's not worth the watch.
