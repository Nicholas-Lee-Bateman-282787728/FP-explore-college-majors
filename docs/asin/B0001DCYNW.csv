800957,A1XPGRB6C8CKI6,B0001DCYNW,"Carlos Burning ""Carlos""","[16, 18]","In a few obvious respects the storyline of this somber film recalls the classic film noir ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" which starred Lana Turner and John Garfield.  ""Stateline Motel"" follows the adventures of a career criminal named Floyd (played by Fabio Testi).  On the same day that he is released from a Montreal prison where he was held for car theft, he and his murderous accomplice (Eli Wallach) stage a daring daylight jewel heist.  After evading the police in a high-speed car chase, they take off in separate directions, intending to meet later in the U.S. where they will split the loot.  With a fortune in stolen jewelry in his sole possession, Testi gets involved in a car accident, which leaves him stranded at the dreary backwater ""Last Chance Motel"" run by gorgeous Michelle (Ursula Andress) and her middle-aged husband (Massimo Girotti).  Irresistibly drawn to each other, Andress and Testi embark on a passionate affair, while the police seem to be drawing ever closer.  Though Testi's car is badly damaged, beyond the local mechanic's competence, he becomes trapped by a far more overriding circumstance: somehow, someone at the motel manages to steal his ill-gotten gains!  Meanwhile, Testi's drawn-out sojourn in the boondocks brings down the wrath of his partner-in-crime Eli Wallach, who seeks out his former accomplice with gun in hand.  To paraphrase Ursula, things rapidly go from worse to worst...As the pessimistic Michelle, Ursula Andress gives the performance of a lifetime.  While her fantastic beauty is literally breathtaking, her characterization is nearly heartbreaking: though she is an absolute Romantic (passionate, lonely, and adventurous) she seems to be dying piecemeal of the sheer dead-end banality surrounding her.  When rugged, lawless Testi arrives on the scene she seizes the opportunity to escape monstrous ennui, and thus shows all the courage and resourcefulness of a fairy tale princess under duress!  Unfortunately her opponent seems to be fate/the great status quo itself.Nearly as memorable as Andress is the film's overall atmosphere: the cold, harsh hinterland of rural Canada, which seems to press down on the human spirit like a leaden weight.  Perhaps this cruel ambience can be regarded as a metaphor for the ""real world.""  If so, Ursula's desire to evade it is classic: such is the way of a tragic heroine.",4,"""Everything Goes From Bad To Worse""",1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,2371,"['few', 'obvious', 'storyline', 'somber', 'film', 'classic', 'film', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'starred', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'John', 'Garfield', 'Stateline', 'Motel', 'adventures', 'career', 'criminal', 'named', 'Floyd', 'played', 'Fabio', 'Testi', 'same', 'day', 'released', 'Montreal', 'prison', 'where', 'was', 'held', 'car', 'theft', 'murderous', 'accomplice', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'stage', 'daring', 'daylight', 'jewel', 'heist', 'evading', 'police', 'high-speed', 'car', 'chase', 'take', 'off', 'separate', 'directions', 'intending', 'meet', 'later', 'U.S.', 'where', 'will', 'split', 'loot', 'fortune', 'stolen', 'jewelry', 'sole', 'possession', 'Testi', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'stranded', 'dreary', 'backwater', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Motel', 'run', 'gorgeous', 'Michelle', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'middle-aged', 'husband', 'Massimo', 'Girotti', 'Irresistibly', 'drawn', 'other', 'Andress', 'Testi', 'embark', 'passionate', 'affair', 'police', 'seem', 'be', 'drawing', 'ever', 'closer', 'Testi', 'car', 'badly', 'damaged', 'local', 'mechanic', 'competence', 'trapped', 'far', 'more', 'overriding', 'circumstance', 'somehow', 'someone', 'motel', 'steal', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'Meanwhile', 'Testi', 'drawn-out', 'sojourn', 'boondocks', 'down', 'wrath', 'partner-in-crime', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'who', 'out', 'former', 'accomplice', 'gun', 'hand', 'paraphrase', 'Ursula', 'things', 'rapidly', 'go', 'worse', 'worst', 'pessimistic', 'Michelle', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'fantastic', 'beauty', 'literally', 'breathtaking', 'characterization', 'nearly', 'heartbreaking', 'absolute', 'Romantic', 'passionate', 'lonely', 'adventurous', 'be', 'dying', 'piecemeal', 'sheer', 'dead-end', 'banality', 'surrounding', 'When', 'rugged', 'lawless', 'Testi', 'scene', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'monstrous', 'ennui', 'thus', 'courage', 'resourcefulness', 'fairy', 'tale', 'princess', 'duress', 'Unfortunately', 'opponent', 'be', 'fate/the', 'great', 'status', 'quo', 'itself.Nearly', 'as', 'memorable', 'Andress', 'film', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'cold', 'harsh', 'hinterland', 'rural', 'Canada', 'press', 'down', 'human', 'spirit', 'leaden', 'weight', 'Perhaps', 'cruel', 'ambience', 'can', 'be', 'regarded', 'metaphor', 'real', 'world', 'so', 'Ursula', 'desire', 'evade', 'classic', 'such', 'way', 'tragic', 'heroine']",N/A

800961,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,B0001DCYNW,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[0, 0]","This is a rather poor transfer of a seventies film directed by Maurizio Lucidi.  I am talking about the Wham! USA/Jef Films product.  ""Stateline Motel,"" often bringing up the great noir classic, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" about a criminal played by Fabio Testi comes to a crummy ""Last Chance Motel"" run by a middle-aged man and his curvaceous wife played by Ursula Andress, who is looking for a way out and sees it in our hero,  Testi had just helped rob a jewelry store with his partner, older and more savage, played by the great Eli Wallach.  Testi was entrusted with the jewels, but on his way to meet up with his partner, he wrecks his car and has to stay at the motel where no one can be trusted.  Meanwhile, the jewels disappear and the savage partner comes to find out what's happened.  It sounds good and plays out pretty well, but it is not as intelligent as it could be and the seventies style, European influence cause it become draggy.  Also in the cast are a young Barbara Bach, Howard Ross, Carlo De Mejo and Massimo Girotti.  The script is classic material from a novel written by Franco Enna, adapted by Fulva Gicca Palli, but the end product winds up like many European thrillers especially reminding me of ""Death Knocks Twice"" also starring Fabio Testi, which unfortunately is a mild divergence from reality, with Testi being good to watch, but the film itself is too interested in being current to a style that's gone out of style.  That ""style"" is the drawback to making ""Stateline Motel"" much more memorable.  It would have been nice if the print they used in the first place were in better shape, it's somewhat out of sync, both visually and audibly, probably a VHS to DVD.  I think Ursula comes out the winner, at least as far as our sympathies go.  It kept me guessing to the end.  I would have to say avoid the DVD as well if you can catch the movie any other way. But then, I don't regret it.  It is supposedly digitally remastered with enhanced audio, color, 86 minutes.  Ursula is more nude than in ""Mountain of the Cannibal God.""",3,Interesting Diversion Gone Awry,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2065,"['rather', 'poor', 'transfer', 'seventies', 'film', 'directed', 'Maurizio', 'Lucidi', 'am', 'talking', 'Wham', 'USA/Jef', 'Films', 'product', 'Stateline', 'Motel', 'often', 'bringing', 'up', 'great', 'noir', 'classic', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'criminal', 'played', 'Fabio', 'Testi', 'crummy', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Motel', 'run', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'curvaceous', 'wife', 'played', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'who', 'looking', 'way', 'hero', 'Testi', 'had', 'just', 'helped', 'rob', 'jewelry', 'store', 'partner', 'older', 'more', 'savage', 'played', 'great', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Testi', 'was', 'entrusted', 'jewels', 'way', 'meet', 'up', 'partner', 'car', 'stay', 'motel', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'Meanwhile', 'jewels', 'disappear', 'savage', 'partner', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'good', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'not', 'as', 'intelligent', 'could', 'be', 'seventies', 'style', 'European', 'influence', 'cause', 'draggy', 'Also', 'cast', 'are', 'young', 'Barbara', 'Bach', 'Howard', 'Ross', 'Carlo', 'De', 'Mejo', 'Massimo', 'Girotti', 'script', 'classic', 'material', 'novel', 'written', 'Franco', 'Enna', 'adapted', 'Fulva', 'Gicca', 'Palli', 'end', 'product', 'up', 'many', 'European', 'thrillers', 'especially', 'reminding', 'Death', 'Knocks', 'Twice', 'also', 'starring', 'Fabio', 'Testi', 'unfortunately', 'mild', 'divergence', 'reality', 'Testi', 'being', 'good', 'watch', 'film', 'too', 'interested', 'being', 'current', 'style', 'gone', 'style', 'style', 'drawback', 'making', 'Stateline', 'Motel', 'much', 'more', 'memorable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'print', 'used', 'first', 'place', 'were', 'better', 'shape', 'somewhat', 'sync', 'visually', 'audibly', 'probably', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'think', 'Ursula', 'out', 'winner', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'sympathies', 'go', 'kept', 'guessing', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'catch', 'movie', 'other', 'way', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'supposedly', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'enhanced', 'audio', 'color', '86', 'minutes', 'Ursula', 'more', 'nude', 'Mountain', 'Cannibal', 'God']",N/A
