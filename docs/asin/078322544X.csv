When I found out it was entirely from the Gospel of St. Matthew, I looked it up in the Bible and lo and behold...there it was.  After my Catholic education, it took this film to trigger my religious curiousity. And that may be what I mean...to see Jesus as a real man with emotions and not some spaced out actor. To see his followers as young handsome people and not just robed followers. You're either ready to experience that realization or you don't. I was lucky enough to see Ted Neeley perform JCS on stage a few years back...the ending was not to be believed.

Then moved to U.S.A. and here, in Denver, they announced the play and I went - and I finally saw Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson on the stage - I'll never forget! I bought the VHS and I was in heaven. Then I bought the DVD and was more than happy. And, finally, I bought this Special Edition and already lost the count how many times I saw it.

You've got to watch this movie knowing that it is a time capsule of tail-end hippy era fashions and staging. 'Superstar' is my favorite Lloyd-Webber musical because of its power. Ted Neeley is quite good as Jesus, rivalling vocally Ian Gillan's original performance. And his acting is sensitive and thoughtful. His Jesus is no mystic wimp. Perhaps the man himself was a little like this? It's an interesting question to ponder. And Carl Anderson: You are WONDERFUL! I've performed in two versions of 'Superstar' myself and yours was always the vocal interpretation I referred to, as should most performers.

If you are not a Christian and you like musicals, you may enjoy it. But if you are a Christian you will probably not like this portrayal of Jesus. Webber and Rice take the life of Jesus and turn it into an account of an influential and misunderstood human being who is not and doesn't claim to be anything other than just plain human. Jesus' words as recorded in the gospels are altered and radically added to, with the obvious goal of showing that Jesus did not consider himself to be either the Hebrew Messiah or the Son of God. (This intent may not be obvious by watching it, but a reading of the libretto makes it clear). His actions and words are much more 'human' than was portrayed in the gospels. And the actions and words of his apostles are also changed from the gospel accounts, largely for the worse as far as their moral character is concerned.",3,A humanistic portrayal of the life of Jesus,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,968,"['are', 'looking', 'something', 'Christian', 'inspirational', 'musical', 'not', 'really', 'intended', 'be', 'either', 'are', 'not', 'Christian', 'like', 'musicals', 'may', 'enjoy', 'are', 'Christian', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'Webber', 'Rice', 'take', 'life', 'Jesus', 'turn', 'account', 'influential', 'misunderstood', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'not', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'just', 'plain', 'human', 'Jesus', 'words', 'recorded', 'gospels', 'are', 'altered', 'radically', 'added', 'obvious', 'goal', 'showing', 'Jesus', 'did', 'not', 'consider', 'be', 'either', 'Hebrew', 'Messiah', 'Son', 'God', 'intent', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'obvious', 'watching', 'reading', 'libretto', 'clear', 'actions', 'words', 'are', 'much', 'more', ""'human"", 'was', 'portrayed', 'gospels', 'actions', 'words', 'apostles', 'are', 'also', 'changed', 'gospel', 'accounts', 'largely', 'worse', 'as', 'far', 'moral', 'character', 'concerned']",N/A
52129,A2HQ31XNN3OXES,078322544X,"Andrew Beaton ""lyrical chef""","[18, 19]","For many young people today, the idea of watching Jesus Christ Superstar immediately has three strikes against it: (1) dated, religious material (2) it's a movie musical (3) it's written by Andrew Lloyd Webber. No thanks. But they are making a grevious mistake.The music for this film is totally superb. Sir ALW lays down some shredding and funky grooves and knows how to write a good 70s pop song when the occasion calls for it. The overture alone is enough to establish the quality of the music to come. The juxtaposition of the hard-rocking score with the clean, sparse images of the Israeli desert is truly inspired. (In general, Norman Jewison's staging is quite brilliant.) For all the stuff he has written that I hate, Webber scores here, and he scores well. This is not ""Phantom of the Opera"" we're talking about.Of course, the whole conceit - a bunch of rag-tag, crazy thespians heading out to the desert in a hippie bus to perform the play without an audience - provides a welcome, very amusing piece of 70s cheese.The singers are entertaining across the board. Ted Neeley is an arena-rock Jesus, who lays out some high pitched notes like he was fronting Boston. Yvonne Elliman is genuinely terrific as Mary Magdalene. The growly-voiced Caiaphas takes out Jesus to protect his power and puts down some excellent songs in the process. Herod and Pilate provide comic relief and gravitas, respectively. And who can forget Larry T. Marshall as Simon, whose big number provides the unequivocal comedy high point of the film? I don't think words can encompass how great this scene is; you just have to see it.But fans of this movie know I have saved the best for last. Even if you have seen local productions or heard the score on CD, you cannot appreciate how good Carl Anderson is as Judas until you see this film. He absolutely destroys the opening song, ""Heaven On Their Minds"", taking notes that would be routine in the hands of any other man and transforming them into virtuostic runs. His performance  - and credible challenge to Jesus - sets up the dramatic tension between Jesus and Judas that provides the soul of the film.It's cheesy, it's a 70s relic, and at the end of the day, the movie delivers.

52135,AFDYHKAH8AJDT,078322544X,A. Sloan,"[18, 20]","I had the immense pleasure of seeing this Rock opera with both Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson in the late 90's when they put the revival on the road and I must say that 25 some odd years later that they had not lost any of their musical chops. (Although Neeley saved most of the usual high notes for the Garden of Gethsemane scene, Anderson let fly everything he had throughout the entire show.)  I have owned this musical in many of it's numerous incarnations and this is still my favorite outweighing even the original London cast's famous brown soundtrack cover. (which was my first ever 8 track no less!)The idea for Norman Jewison to shoot on location in the Holy Land gave a much needed air of authenticity on a concept that very easily could have fallen flat on it's face it not executed correctly on film. The editing and cinematography were beautiful.  The vastness of the landscape especially when Judas is alone with his thoughts, isolated is a very telling scene that puts humanity behind Judas that is rarely examined. (His struggle with his love for Christ and what drove him to betray him is hardly ever looked at in depth.)Caiaphas and Pilate portrayal were excellent as well.  Caiaphas had such an ultra cool demeanor and booming voice, as he demands the disposal of Jesus because of the grip the Pharisees had on the land was slipping away. Pilate's anguish is conveyed when he asks Jesus to say the word to save both he and himself finally having washing his hands of the entire thing in surrender is exhausting.  One of the most impressive yet hardly noted scenes to me is with Simon Zealotes although limited to one song, it clearly showed the mania, excitement and zeal (excuse the pun) that Christ's followers had for him.  The look in Simon's eyes is a bit frightening even to Christ himself when they are eye to eye but the joyous exuberance of everyone is infectious (like a group of children seeing Santa). ...ironic comparison huh, but it fits!  Everyone's performance was strong and commanding except for Yvonne Elliman's which I have always thought was seriously lacking.  She seemed to have the same expression in every scene.  The song ""I don't know how to love him"" is a wonderful song but her weepiness in every single song as well as in ""Try not to get worried"" is way too distracting for me that it almost blows the feel of the moment.However the biggest highlight for me is scene at the Garden of Gethsemane. The pleading and then resignation to the situation that Neely executes is extremely intense. Between the editing of the various works depicting Christ's Crucifixion and the orchestration that accompanies it is such a powerful scene it can bring you to tears.The music and movie are still phenomenal. The concept and the execution were all unique for the time that it was introduced and I don't know that I have seen the like since, when it comes to musicals on screen from then to this point in time.  It's fresh telling of the Biblical story of Christ gave a much-needed jolt to the youth of its time.And to those who don't think that Christians like this movie, I , a devout Christian and my entire family (2 of whom are Ministers) LOVE IT!

This is what a certain weird era of my childhood was all about. After hippies had a massive post-acid/ post-Manson/Altamont bummer, they turned to cults and Jesus. This captures that moment better than anything, even ""Godspell"", another relic of the ""Jesus Freak"" movement. Only Polyphonic Spree and the book ""The Jesus Sound Explosion"" would really touch on that weird period; it seems like a forgotten era.The songs were catchy as hell and all of the performers really rock, literally, especially Judas. And the costumes are awesome; while Jesus looks traditionally Jesus-y, the guards have crazy leather poofy hats and medallions and the chorus at the end is spectacular. Growing up Christian, this was a very controversial film for some as it seemed sacrerligious, yet potentially drew in 'the younger Generation' to the fold. In my house, we were not allowed to sing the theme song.So you can imagine how much fun it is to watch it now. I'm not even sure this could (or would) be made today, since the social climate is all wrong. As one youtube commenter said after watching the finale sequence, ""What the hell did I just watch?"" This is all-out rock'n'roll spiritual searching here people. No one seems to do that anymore. *sigh*After this brief spout of idealism would come the gnarly mid-70s films of urban psychosis, the 'Crazy New York' movies like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Mean Streets"". Things would soon get really dark after the post-60's come-down. The Jesus Freak movement was sort of the last gasp of the Peace and Love era.

A bunch of believers (in this case, hippies) going out into the wilderness to recreate the most important events of their religious belief is a very ancient and widespread practice dating back long before the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.  So it's kinda cool to see a 20th Century version of this.  I also feel a lot more comfortable with the movie's presentation of Jesus as a doubt-filled man, rather than some serene demi-god.  It makes Jesus more believable.  And presenting the story from Judas' point of view is interesting because it makes everyone involved sympathetic - Judas, the Macabees, Pilate, etc., in that no one seems to have a choice of action; it is, after all, god's plan and thus inescapable, despite the wishes of the people involved.My only complaint is the lousy commentary.  Both the director and Kneely seem to have nothing substantive to say about the film.  Perhaps too much time has gone by.  Most of their commentary is spent either admiring the scenery or complimenting each other.  Very tedious.  I wanted to hear why they did things they way they did, what they were trying to say in the film, and perhaps some anecdotes about the filming (there are a couple, but only just a couple).  Too bad.

I saw Jesus Christ Superstar in its original release in a Dolby 6 track 70mm print-up and the picture quality was stunning as was the multi-track sound. My friend saw it in Holland in Dolby 4 track 35mm magnetic sound and he was very impressed.

52150,ADES8B01WRPI3,078322544X,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[9, 47]","I grew up listening to the JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR movie soundtrack album, since the 1970s, and sometimes I am still a little nostalgic over this pretty entertaining movie, but having been personally Saved seven years ago, and studying the Bible a lot since 1999, I now see some very BAD teachings in this film, mainly that Judas the betrayer is really supposed to have been a really logical, reasonable fellow, and the #1 disciple in terms of interacting with Jesus.Has anybody else ever heard about a disciple named Peter, whom the Bible describes as the foremost #1 disciple during the life of Christ? I'm not a Catholic (who base their denomination upon the authority of Peter), but even I can see that this movie doesn't seem to say anything about Peter, while the Bible makes him the foremost disciple, always interacting with Christ, while the other disciples recognized Peter as the most prominent among the 12 disciples. According to this film, only Judas the Betrayer was the main disciple to interact with Jesus, if you can believe that, and you would not be wise to believe a movie over the actual Bible.If you know a lot about the Bible, then you will easily be able to discern Biblical truth, from outright LIES. If you can do that, then you will be able to enjoy much of this film. But more and more, I see that there is an underlying awfulness to the main theme of this film. If you don't know your Bible well, then you might start believing that this film is teaching you what is in the Bible. NOT HARDLY!This film centers on imaginary viewpoints and made up ideas from the supposed thoughts of Judas the Betrayer, while downplaying the authority and divinity of Jesus Christ! God help us all.Lately, the topic of Jesus has been selling hotter than usual. But, unfortunately, it is not the true Jesus as described in the Holy Bible, but it is a false portrait of Jesus that lies by saying that Jesus is all for any type of immoral behavior that modern people want to indulge in. This is a lie, of course. From over 3 decades ago, JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is a precursor of the bestselling, false teachings found in such trash as THE DA VINCI CODE or THE JUDAS GOSPEL, etc.This movie is as subtle as the snake in the Garden of Eden, whispering soothing LIES about what God has said, indeed! This film portrays Jesus as if he doesn't know what His life is all about, as if he is a foolish dreamer, and only Judas Iscariot, His BETRAYER, knows how to ""fix"" it all and make it okay, if only Jesus would listen to the advice of His betrayer. Nonsense!In fact, JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR tells the story of Christ from the viewpoint of his betrayer, and ignores that the Bible condemns Judas, it does not forgive him. The worst misrepresentation on this angle is that after Judas commits suicide, he comes back with a choir of angels, all dressed in white, descending from Heaven. The Bible teaches that Judas is in eternal punishment in Hell (Matthew 26:24; Mark 14:21), he most certainly did NOT go to Heaven!If you can correctly discern the incorrect portrayal of Judas, then I must say that many of the scenes can often be very decent portrayals of different Bible scenes. Many Bible scenes are portrayed accurately, so there is much drama and tension to go along with the catchy rock music soundtrack. Just don't get fooled as to what is counterfeit and what is the Gospel truth! There is a difference when comparing JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to the Bible scriptures.The director's commentary is the best reason to upgrade if you owned a previous version on DVD. The director and the actor who played Jesus reunite, and they tell MANY interesting anecdotes about the shooting of this movie, how things came together before the film, and where everybody went after the filming! If you have known this film for a long time, then you will probably enjoy the director's commentary. Sometimes it reveals things that I wish were not, but take it as it comes. for instance, they both talk about looking to the awful book, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, to get a different angle on Jesus and how Jesus thought about His ministry. This is very bad to do, since that LAST TEMPTATION book was so blasphemous and degrading towards Jesus.This movie, JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, is perhaps one of the modern landmarks of this movement to reinvent Jesus, (out of pure imagination), and it denies and/or perverts what the Holy Bible has taught us for the last 2,000 years or so. The Bible teaches that nobody gets Saved via false teaching, both the false teacher AND the followers of false teachings are BOTH rejected from entrance into Heaven. Beware!A better telling of the Jesus story from the early 1970s is THE GOSPEL ROAD, by Johnny Cash, on DVD, which is much truer to the Bible! But there really is no substitute for reading the Holy Bible for yourself, then you can be equipped to discern the truth from the counterfeits.Counterfeits are worth NOTHING in Heaven, and God knows the difference between those that love His Word and obey it, and those who pervert His Word and lie about it.

One could even find certain locales and spots as something peculiarly familliar from other movies which're shot on the said location as well; wherein in this case the production crew for this musical movie adaptation met up an obstacle with the Isareli government for some political grounds of resistance that they thus have FIDDLER ON THE ROOF director Norman Jewison to direct the film - being that the said movie director fell under the categrical favour with the Israeli government's regard. (SIDE COMMENT: I bet they would've done well effectively nowadays if they'd have Steven Spielberg to use for such in overcoming disrupting crumples for those kinds of situations. Btw, the 3rd Rambo flick which is supposedly going around in Afghanistan on its storyline, is shot in these same certain bounderies of the Holy Land as well, which could give you a certain shot of a reminder whenever you're watching that flick to exclaim on certain scenes- 'Hey, that's where they do the ditty for ""What's The Buzz""!', if you happen to be a fan of this JC SUPES flick, that is.)Reportedly, the film was shot with loud booming speakers heard throughout the desert plains of the Holy Land as the characters lip-sync their way in performing their respective roles; whence compared to the soundtrack - some of the segments that could be found in this movie, along certain interludes that are not found in the perfectly sounding soundtrack- have the actors singing 'live' against the backdrop tracks - which in the result comes to feature some great exclusive performances of the actors within the flick, certifying the good talent of its collective cast assembled for this movie, that in reflection to its original album performers quite levelled this third version as the best and on the pinnacle for what certified JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR to stand out as one of the most remarkable musicals ever made -- and in that respect, this movie version comes as the one responsible not only for propagating the musical's exposure into a wider general set of audiences, but have come to be as the definitive version, so timely that its essence fits perfectly with the Jesus Freak movement of the early flower power 70's, presenting its spirit most fittingly than in any other period or time upon this release that have come about in 1973.Filled with hidden symbolical relevance, and biblical metaphorical anecdotes - The movie works side by side with the movie soundtrack album, which both compliment each other in their own way - that the movie having certain elements that are not found within its album soundtrack compendium (which also have its own certain exclusive aspects that aren't consisted in the movie) ... and vice versa -- they both work well to give broader dimensions for this piece of creation from the writing team of Webber and Rice.It's kinda like the same case for what there is on Arthur C. Clarke's epic work 2001:A Space Odyssey and its respective motion picture adaptation filmed by the late Stanley Kubrick, which independent to each other although the movie is based upon the book written by Clarke - Kubrick's movielization compliments it well by going on its own way independently to its basis, which is developed by the author while it takes life at the same time when the film is being shot.You go figure it out - and see if this doesn't make sense.However, WEBBER in the latter sucessful years on his career, perhaps only driven by the regret of having sold the rights for the musical back then and out of the jealousy for the success of the movie thereof - highly criticised this movie rendition; and upon gaining back the rights by the time assumed and indeed expound some further presentations of JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR mainly on broadway, which only lambasted the work to a point of some overkill. Andrew lloyd Webber as if trying to find a nerve vying for a better presentation of the musical, rather only winded coming up with further depictions of this work of his with lyricist Tim Rice that are just of those such cranky types of interpretations which are nothing short of Webber's delusionary visions which are biproducts of Webber's accumulated deteriorated lack of spunk in his creative input, brought upon the man through the downside of success -- mainly, on his 1996 effort featuring Joanna Ampil (a singer following in the footsteps of her fellow nationality MISS SAIGON's Lea Salongga), playing the part of Mary Magdalene, with a squeemy Jesus and a totally over-acting Judas to match -- that'd been completely awful in every sense of the word, perhaps save only for its sessionist players, and was only made merely a little notable enough due to Alice Cooper's presence playing the part as King Herod - but the guy never appeared on the stage production except for its album companion.-----------------------------------------------------------------AS FOR THE DVD-I've found a copy somewhere with a french alternate language feature, and i guess it's kinda notable at that - seeing the flick dubbed in french, thus with the songs sang french version-wise.However, with what's issued : it only have director Norman Jewison's commentary. I guess a better reissue should surface, with commentaries from the cast themselves - including featurettes for the music and the making of the movie as well, plus the old tv-documentary feature for the film.I say, that's something that should be released out there for the love of anything that's just -- along with the complete Budokan concert of Cheap Trick, with Supertramp's gig at Paris.

I like how they approached it.  I thought Jesus was a bit weak as a vocalist, but I am used to the album.  I thought Judas was a tad ""different"".  Not really weak, but his timing seemed different.  Yes, I realize they both played the same parts in the Broadway production, but I guess it is my familiarity with the album's singers that makes me a tad biased.

Several of the actors from the Broadway version reprise their roles - but Ian Gillian (Christ) was touring with Deep Purple. Micky Dolenz (the Monkeys) & David Cassidy (The Partridge Family) were both considered for the role of Christ, before Ted Neeley (who was understudy to Ian Gillian - Christ, played a reporter/leper in Broadway version) was eventually chosen. It was mostly filmed in Israel - primarily the ruins of Avdat as well as some other Middle Eastern locales. I felt some of the scenes were a little ""harsh"", but remember this was the 70's and the USA was involved in the Viet Nam War - which does ""color"" this production. As with any movie (from the stage) settings can be larger, but also less intimate. Neeley won a Golden Globe in '74 for his performance.

Told entirely through catchy, rock opera music, it tells the story of the last seven days in the life of Jesus Christ, but is hardly a literal interpretation and consists mostly of the drama between Judas and Jesus.  The point of the film is to show the bible in a new way- that everyone, even Jesus's closest disciples helped contribute to the death of Jesus through their inescapable humanism.  Filmed in the Jerusalem desert, the production is wonderful.  It's as if the best singers, film makers, dancers, musicians, and songwriters (Andrew Lloyd Webber &amp; Tim Rice) came together for this one movie.  Carl Anderson stars as Judas and is arguably the best performer to ever perform the role.  Ted Neeley is fantastic too even though it takes a while to &quot;get&quot; the strenghth in his underacting.  Norman Jewison, who's experience and creativity as director shines through with every scene, takes the musical to another level, using a brilliantly conceptual theme that is introduced at the very beginning of the film.

Forty years ago some thought this blasphamous but in the wake of Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" Norman Jewison's film is as disarming as an episode of ""Captain Kangaroo"".  I had never listened to the LP or seen a stage version or this movie until now.  My verdict is that it's a very good film saddled with a weak actor playing Jesus.  Ted Neeley is as charasmatic as a potato and his vocalizing wouldn't get him past the audition phase of ""American Idol"".  Couldn't they find some other bozo with facial hair to play the part?  The scene where he chases the money changers from the temple is laughable because he couldn't frighten a toddler.  That said the rest of the film is virtually flawless.  Jewison seamlessly opens the film up from it's stage origins to the big screen.  Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's songs are fantastic.  The choreography is breathtaking.  Carl Anderson as Judas is spellbinding.  A thought.  Couldn't Anderson have played Jesus?  Yvonne Elliman brilliantly captures the conflict of Mary Magdalene's feelings for Jesus in her rendering of the showstopping song ""I Don't Know How To Love Him"".  I was impressed, save Neeley, with this production.  It probably served it's purpose by interesting me in other versions of the work.  Ironically there's a new production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" on Broadway.  I'm a metroliner away from New York and it is intriguing except for the prohibitive ticket prices for Broadway shows.

52179,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,078322544X,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Under Norman Jewison's direction, and Douglas Slocombe's  cinematography, this unconventional retelling of Christ's final days  with music and lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice comes to life onscreen in the desert of Jerusalem.As the introductory music begins, a bus reaches its destination, and its occupants disembark and prepare to play their roles.The most dramatic moment in that scene is when Ted Neeley, who plays the title character  is surrounded by the cast, and the scene changes to the place where Christ and his disciples-both male and female are currently residing as an apprehensive Judas (Carl Anderson) expresses his concerns about Jesus' doctrine, and the possibility  of clashes with their Roman occupiers.The devoted Mary Magdalene ( Yvonne Elliman), comforts Jesus and tries to get him to settle down for the night. Judas mocks her for her use of expensive ointment, claiming it could be sold to help the poor, and touches on her alleged history as a prostitute, but Jesus rebukes him.A pensive Mary later sings her character's signature tune,"" I Don't Know How to Love Him"", which reaffirms the Magdalene's image as a fallen woman, although the Bible itself never mentions that about her.During the next few days we see Jesus ride triumphantly into Jerusalem to the tune of the very modern ""Hosannah, Hey-sannah"", as if he were a celebrity on a modern-day red carpet, and as the title of this musical emphasizes, we will watch him go from a highly hailed persona, to someone who causes controversy, especially when he upsets the moneylenders in the temple, to someone who will lose everything ...Only in His case, for the redemption of mankind.But there is a lively moment with Larry T. Marshall's Simon Zealot, showing Jesus how he has recruited followers for Him, although the Zealot is misguided in recommending Christ render an anti-Roman message in his sermons.There is also an odd moment of a viewing of modern military tanks in the desert that purportedly touches on some antiwar message--typical of many films of that time.The film explores his relationship with the apostle, Peter(Philip Toubus), and the dream of an apprehensive Pontius Pilate( Barry Dennen), as a prefect and Divinity move closer to their destinies.Judas plots with the High Priests Caiaphas (Bob Bingham) and Annas(Kurt Yaghjihan) to bring down Jesus.After a hostile confrontation with Judas during the Last Supper, the Disciples sing of their shared destiny of being remembered throughout history as Judas runs off to betray Jesus.Soon an apprehensive Jesus sings ""Gethsemene"" as He is in the garden of that name awaiting His arrest. When Judas and the soldiers, come, Peter  offers to fight for his Master, but Jesus  resigns Himself to His fate.Soon Peter fulfills Jesus' prediction that he would deny Him, and his rebuked by Mary Magdalene.Brought before King Herod(Josh Mostel), Jesus fails to impress and earns the King's ire. When He appears before Pilate, he is  ultimately lashed and sentenced to death.Devastated by his betrayal, Judas meets a tragic fate. The song, ""Could We Start Again Please?""( which was written for the film but not in the original stage version) expresses the Magdalene's and Peter's longing to see Jesus again, but things have reached the point of no return.A Post-mortem Judas ponders Jesus' role in the world as He makes his fateful trip to Calvary.40 years after its release, this film may appear a bit dated, but the music is driven and passionate, and perhaps resulted in many conversions to Christianity in an era when many Hippies could identify with certain aspects of the lifestyle of Christ and His disciples.And its players could depart from their desert stage on a satisfactory note.",5,The Gospel According to the Hippie Generation!,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3739,"['Norman', 'Jewison', 'direction', 'Douglas', 'Slocombe', 'cinematography', 'unconventional', 'retelling', 'Christ', 'final', 'days', 'music', 'lyrics', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'life', 'onscreen', 'desert', 'Jerusalem.As', 'introductory', 'music', 'bus', 'destination', 'occupants', 'disembark', 'prepare', 'play', 'roles.The', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'scene', 'when', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'who', 'title', 'character', 'surrounded', 'cast', 'scene', 'changes', 'place', 'where', 'Christ', 'disciples-both', 'male', 'female', 'are', 'currently', 'residing', 'apprehensive', 'Judas', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'concerns', 'Jesus', 'doctrine', 'possibility', 'clashes', 'Roman', 'occupiers.The', 'devoted', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'Jesus', 'tries', 'get', 'settle', 'down', 'night', 'Judas', 'use', 'expensive', 'ointment', 'claiming', 'could', 'be', 'sold', 'help', 'poor', 'touches', 'alleged', 'history', 'prostitute', 'Jesus', 'him.A', 'pensive', 'Mary', 'later', 'character', 'signature', 'tune', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'Love', 'Him', 'Magdalene', 'image', 'fallen', 'woman', 'Bible', 'never', 'mentions', 'her.During', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'see', 'Jesus', 'ride', 'triumphantly', 'Jerusalem', 'tune', 'very', 'modern', 'Hosannah', 'Hey-sannah', 'were', 'celebrity', 'modern-day', 'red', 'carpet', 'title', 'musical', 'emphasizes', 'will', 'watch', 'go', 'highly', 'hailed', 'persona', 'someone', 'who', 'controversy', 'especially', 'when', 'moneylenders', 'temple', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'lose', 'everything', 'Only', 'case', 'redemption', 'mankind.But', 'lively', 'moment', 'Larry', 'T.', 'Marshall', 'Simon', 'Zealot', 'showing', 'Jesus', 'how', 'recruited', 'followers', 'Him', 'Zealot', 'misguided', 'recommending', 'Christ', 'render', 'anti-Roman', 'message', 'sermons.There', 'also', 'odd', 'moment', 'viewing', 'modern', 'military', 'tanks', 'desert', 'purportedly', 'antiwar', 'message', 'typical', 'many', 'films', 'time.The', 'film', 'relationship', 'apostle', 'Peter', 'Philip', 'Toubus', 'dream', 'apprehensive', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Barry', 'Dennen', 'prefect', 'Divinity', 'move', 'closer', 'destinies.Judas', 'plots', 'High', 'Priests', 'Caiaphas', 'Bob', 'Bingham', 'Annas', 'Kurt', 'Yaghjihan', 'bring', 'down', 'Jesus.After', 'hostile', 'confrontation', 'Judas', 'Last', 'Supper', 'Disciples', 'sing', 'shared', 'destiny', 'being', 'remembered', 'history', 'Judas', 'betray', 'Jesus.Soon', 'apprehensive', 'Jesus', 'Gethsemene', 'garden', 'name', 'awaiting', 'arrest', 'When', 'Judas', 'soldiers', 'come', 'Peter', 'fight', 'Master', 'Jesus', 'fate.Soon', 'Peter', 'Jesus', 'prediction', 'would', 'deny', 'Him', 'rebuked', 'Mary', 'Magdalene.Brought', 'King', 'Herod', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Jesus', 'impress', 'earns', 'King', 'ire', 'When', 'Pilate', 'ultimately', 'lashed', 'sentenced', 'death.Devastated', 'betrayal', 'Judas', 'tragic', 'fate', 'song', 'Could', 'Start', 'Again', 'Please', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'not', 'original', 'stage', 'version', 'Magdalene', 'Peter', 'longing', 'see', 'Jesus', 'again', 'things', 'have', 'reached', 'point', 'return.A', 'Post-mortem', 'Judas', 'ponders', 'Jesus', 'role', 'world', 'fateful', 'trip', 'Calvary.40', 'years', 'release', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'bit', 'dated', 'music', 'driven', 'passionate', 'perhaps', 'resulted', 'many', 'conversions', 'Christianity', 'era', 'when', 'many', 'Hippies', 'could', 'identify', 'certain', 'aspects', 'lifestyle', 'Christ', 'disciples.And', 'players', 'could', 'depart', 'desert', 'stage', 'satisfactory', 'note']",N/A

52181,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,078322544X,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 3]","I always think of Norman Jewison as the quintessential Hollywood director, a consummate professional with a rather wide range (e.g, The Cincinnati Kid (1965), In the Heat of the Night (1967), Fiddler on the Roof (1971), Agnes of God (1985), Other People's Money (1991), etc.) a man who has made many successful movies, a man who will do justice to the material in a popular, but not entirely mid-brow fashion.  He will attempt nothing fancy, but will go with the reasonable, and he will never stray far from the understanding that the purpose of a movie is to sell tickets and to entertain.  He is particularly good at translating stage plays onto the silver screen.  Here he is called upon to turn the once controversial Tim Rice/Andrew Lloyd Webber rock opera into a movie.  His framing conception is to park a bus load of performers (recalling perhaps a Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour or a Shakespearean troupe) on a barren spot in the Holy Land where they will put on an enthusiastic, low budget production of the play, which is filmed.  When they're finished they pack everything back into the bus and drive off.  Well, almost everything.  Christ, in the form of Ned Neeley, who is perhaps a little too slight, and a little too cute for the part (although no one will ever completely please attempting to play the son of God), is still up on that cross, presumably hanging around for the resurrection that never comes in the staunchly secular Rice/Webber musical.  This is Jewison's little statement as he has Yvonne Elliman (Mary Magdalene) and Carl Anderson (Judas) look back.Seeing this in the year two thousand and one for the first time has certain advantages.  One, it doesn't seem such a departure from the traditional London/New York musical, since one has already experienced Hair, Godspell, Tommy, etc.  Two, the propriety of playing the crucifixion story to rock music and the controversy of presenting a secular, perhaps sacrilegious Jesus to a mass audience are now mute points.  Most Christians, I dare say, now believe Jesus Christ, Superstar to be a positive thing for Christianity and even responsible for bringing many people into the fold.  Three, one can compare it with the recent film production directed by Gale Edwards and Nick Morris.That film, starring Glenn Carter as Jesus and J&eacute;rme Pradon as Judas and Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene, with its montage of twentieth century costumes, Judas in a black leather jacket, the Romans in Nazi uniforms, a priest looking like Darth Vader, etc. is snappier, more tightly focused than Jewison's methodically paced compilation.  Here, though, we have the groovy feel of threads from the 70s, bell bottoms and exposed chest hairs, along with some very strange head gear for the priests, and soldiers looking like construction workers in pink hard hats.  Here we have tanks bizarrely chasing Judas before he is herded among the goats.  Here we have a black Judas and an Hawaiian Mary Magdalene, while more recently we have a velvety black Mary Magdalene and a balding European Judas.  In both cases we have a blond Jesus dressed all in white often spotlighted in the golden hues of a renaissance painting. While the Edwards production is shot on an elaborately constructed stage, Jewison has the dry rocks and sands of Jerusalem as a backdrop for his scaffolding.  Throw in a camel or two and some goats, and there is more of a feel of the Middle East than in the recent film.  But does this matter?  Is JCS a play about a contemporary Jesus or a modern dress passion play pretending to be about Jesus?  Is Jesus a superstar like a rock musician or a superstar like the founder of a religion?  Part of the genius of the conception of Rice and Webber is this essential ambiguity.  Is he the Son of God, or a historical personage?  Most Christians would say he is both.  Rice/Webber emphasize that he was a man, like any other.Musically speaking, and this play is really about the music as much as anything else, both productions are beautiful.  The Jewison film is superior in the angelic voice of Yvonne Elliman and in the power and energy and full range vocals of Carl Anderson's Judas.  It suffers from a weak Jesus and some inexplicable guitar riffs and the addition of some music not composed by Webber and Rice.  Josh Mostel's libertine King Herod and his mocking &quot;King of the Jews!&quot; is on a par with Rik Mayall who did the mocking as a gay King Herod in the Edwards film.  Both could pass for fully degenerate denizens of Sodom and Gomorrah.  The pain and agony of the crucifixion is more graphically accomplished here, but Glenn Carter's blood-smeared Jesus is the more tortured.I could go on making comparisons, some you might agree with and some you might not.  But I really think the important thing is that both productions are wonderfully entertaining and engaging--how can one go wrong with such beautiful music and such a compelling story?  It's a matter of taste.  I had a lot of fun viewing them both.",4,The &quot;groovy&quot; version,987465600,"04 17, 2001",2001,5002,"['always', 'think', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'quintessential', 'Hollywood', 'director',

Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[2, 2]","Well, I'm biased, because Jesus Christ Superstar is my favourite rock opera, but even without the music, this is something special. You have to be prepared to suspend your disbelief quite a lot here, because the film starts and ends with the framing device of a load of contemporary hippies taking a magic bus to the desert and performing the story of the last days of Jesus. The film never entirely breaks free of this frame, because we see the Roman guards with machine guns and the traders in the temple with postcard racks. This is probably better (and cheaper!) than attempting to make a realistic backdrop because it allows the entire proceedings to be shot on location rather than the usual method of constructing sets in the studios and somehow putting in the 30 A.D. buildings in place on location. The central performances are excellent and if the actors don't live up to our expectations of what Jesus and Judas might look like, then more suspension of disbelief is aided by the fact that they're so damn good in the roles. The singing of Judas particularly is both powerful in the louder sections and constant in the quiet parts, which is quite difficult to achieve. Disco diva Yvonne Elliman makes a great Mary Magdalene, singing what some say is Rice's cleverest lyric to Webber's best melody, 'I Don't Know How To Love Him'.

We were the only people in the theatre, and from the opening desert landscape to the final haunting  sunset, I was completely mesmerized. Our family had already listened  extensively to the &quot;rock opera&quot; soundtrack, and were quite  famliar with the music and story.  But nothing could prepare us for the  explosion of sight and sound that confronted us that night.  It sounds  cliched, but I was completely &quot;blown away&quot;.In the years since,  JCSS has had a permanent place in my life. I played in the orchestra of a  local production, introduced it to my wife and children, saw the 1993-94  revivals starring Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson along with Dennis de Young  of Styx as Pilate (wow!), and watched this film in every available format,  from Beta to VHS to laserdisc...and now on DVD.I can honestly say that  this is the best presentation of the film I've ever seen...and I've seen  them all.  The colors are exquisite, the image clearer than ever, and while  the sound and &quot;look&quot; of the film are obviously dated and inferior  by today's standards, the result simply enhances the film's charm.I feel  that Ted Neeley is remarkable as Jesus...he &quot;owns&quot; this part.  Yes, he is small of stature and plays the character as seen through the  eyes of Judas, i.e. &quot;whiny&quot;.  But watch how he transforms as  Judas' attitudes evolve.  Also, no one has ever been able to match his  electrifying voice, especially in the Gethsemene sequence.Like many  others, this was my first view of the &quot;Passion Play&quot; in a manner  that brought home the human realities of it to me.  This is a film that is  really beyond criticism...either one loves it &quot;as it is&quot; or not.

At that time, my turnstile record player had gone bust, and I had not heard the concept albumn for years, not having yet bought the soundtrack on CD. I rented this movie from the video store and for the entire time I had it out, I had it playing on the TV continuously just so I could hear the soundtrack. I have always loved the concept albumn for the excellent music and knew all of the songs by heart.I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, because when it came out, I remembered hearing that it wasn't very good. Watching it for the first time in the 90's, I found it to be a fun reminder of the 70's in its setting, with its theme of a bunch of hippies traveling to the Israeli desert in a bus to stage the story of Jesus.While I found Yvonne Elliman's over-emoting extremely annoying, I loved the portrayal of Pontius Pilate by Barry Dennem. I also thought the portrayal of Herod by Josh Mostel was absolutely hilarious. Carl Anderson's performance of Judas was memorable.The first time watching it, I thought Ted Neeley made for a mighty wimpy Jesus. However, as I watched it the second time through, I noticed that in Gethsemane, he grew stronger throughout the course of the song and afterwards was much more self assured and strong in the role. I realized that his portrayal fit the idea of a Jesus who was tortured during his final days by his reservations about going through with the ""plan,"" which is, of course, the point of Gethsame when he asks at the beginning that the cup be taken from him and at the end resolves to drink ""your cup of poison"" and emerges ready to face his persecutors.Although I am not religious, this remains one of my favorite musicals because of the music.

Well, technically the play itself is what I mean, and I have seen this as a play as well...Both the film adaption and play are excellent.  I consider this to be one of the best musicals of all time.The film takes a cast of JCS and sticks them in a desert in Israel to act out the entire play.  Everyone in this is has a great voice and brings great life to their character.  And they look like they were having a ball.  There is no talking in this film, one must pay complete attention to the music as it tells the story.  This is Webber/Rice's signature.  Evita is told the same way.Ted Neeley, who plays our title character, looks just like the &quot;image&quot; of Jesus that we have inbedded in our heads.  It is so uncanny, and he is an amazing talent.  His voice is wonderful.  Yvonne Elliman is Mary Magdelene is just breathtaking.

It follows Jesus and gives the viewer a more human perspective on the Christ instead of the distant and iconic, divine Jesus that is often portrayed in movies. Jesus is more approachable and more easily understandable in this portrayal. You really feel Jesus' pain and agony when everyone turns on him after he is arrested. You can also see his confusion and fright in the days before his arrest. You can really feel for him and you finally understand what the human Jesus was feeling in the week before his death since he knew his fate. It gives you a peak into his pain and anguish. He wonders if he will die in vain, but this is merely the devil tempting him, and he decides that he must die to save the human race. &quot;To conquer death you only have to die.&quot;This movie is set in Israel and has minimal settings so that you can get a feeling of the land. It is beautiful done with beautiful photography. The cast is also wonderful. Ted Neeley plays an emotional and innocent Jesus Christ. He has a soft but emotional voice that will bring you to tears when he sings &quot;Gethsemane.&quot; His voice is purer than that of Judas, which cannot be said of some of the other recordings. He is a pure version of Jesus, which I like. Ted Neeley still plays the role of Jesus. He's really good!Carl Anderson was perfectly casted for the part of Judas because you really feel his anguish. You understand Judas and feel sorry for him because it was his destiny to turn over Christ. Barry Dennon from the Original London Cast returns as Pilate. He is perfect for the part and is a great voice actor. Yvonne Elliman is perfect as Mary Magdeline because she has such a beautiful voice. Her portrayal is unique and perfect. The Mary Magdeline in the musical is devoted to Christ and even has a bit of a love interest, which is I think based on the Gospel of Thomas. Larry Marshall is great as Simon the Zealot. Bob Bingham is perfect as Caiaphas! He is not portrayed as evil but someone who is truly worried about an uprising or revolt that would cause the Romans to crush Israel. Josh Mostel as King Herod is my only problem with this movie because he is not very good.I would wait for the new DVD that's coming out in August 2004. I have this version of the DVD and am disappointed because it doesn't have bonus materials of any mention. There are written biographies- you read them, and written production notes. I think there's a trailer too. But I heard there are going to be commentaries on the next DVD! Maybe even some interviews? I don't know!This is a great musical and I believe that it will deepen your faith because it allows you to see Jesus in a new, updated light. The dancing is unusual and funny at times, but I like the music and acting. The dancing isn't bad! I just find it amusing. The Temple scene is also interesting because they are selling pretty modern stuff. Get the new DVD in August 2004!

52194,A1NOJG0037EUQ6,078322544X,Eric Weiss,"[7, 11]","There are many powerful moments in this movie, and it is good to see a Jesus who &quot;offends&quot; His followers as well as His critics. In that sense, this is truer to the Gospels than some other Jesus portrayals.Though I like this movie, it is flawed in some major ways:1. Jesus seems ambivalent and unsure about why He is to die and about God's (His Father's) purpose for His death. This is an unnecessary detraction, for Webber &amp; Rice seem to be familiar enough with the Gospels so as to recognize that Jesus spoke of and understood the sacrificial &amp; atoning purpose of His death. Ultimately, a Jesus who doesn't know why He is dying becomes inexplicable, not just to Himself, but to those hearing and/or watching the story. Rewriting some of His lines could help this film/play immeasurably in this regard, even if it was having Jesus coming to realize the purpose of His life and death as He walks the path He walks - i.e., a gradual increasing understanding, rather than an early-realized one. To just reduce his death to that of an innocent good man who wanted to establish God's kingdom of love, who for whatever reason &quot;forgives&quot; those who are crucifying Him because &quot;they know not what they do,&quot; leaving us to ponder what meaning that might have for our lives - as some humanistic portrayals of Jesus do, and as Webber &amp; Rice seem to do here - is, to me, a fatal flaw. It leaves Jesus as a puzzle for humans to figure out in whatever way is &quot;meaningful&quot; to them. As much as I like much of this film, this is - as I said - a fatal flaw.But ... when Jesus and the crowds come to Jerusalem, and they sing &quot;Hosanna&quot; and then in one verse sing, &quot;Hey, J.C., J.C., would You die for me?&quot; the image freezes for a second on Jesus's face as He drops His smile and realizes that indeed He will have to die for them. It's a fantastic shot.2. The implication or suggestion that Mary Magdalene had or sought to have physical relations with Jesus. If, per the Gospels, she was one from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons and/or one whose many sins Jesus had forgiven, her relationship to Him would be other than as portrayed in this film. Apparently Webber &amp; Rice wanted to portray a different Magdalene.3. Pilate seems too sympathetic to Jesus, and too desirous of saving His life. But Brian Dennen is a superb Pilate, or a superb rendering of this characterization of Pilate!4. The Jews (not just the Jewish leaders) turn on/against Jesus too quickly and too violently after He is arrested, moreso than the Gospel records seem to indicate, I think. In the Gospels, Jesus indicates that it is the Chief Priests and the Scribes and the Pharisees and the Elders who will turn Him over. The people had some part in this, but not so strongly as the film portrays.5. Jesus acts angrily toward Judas in a couple scenes, once when  confronting him about Mary Magdalene, and again when He sends him away to betray Him. This doesn't fit the Gospel tale, but it does make sense if, per my first criticism, Jesus is confused about the reason He must die and views it as fate and knows that Judas is fated to arrange His arrest (and this does seem to be Jesus's view, per his statement to Pilate after Pilate has had him flogged and tries one last time to save His life - and Jesus tells him that it's all &quot;fixed&quot;). Carl Anderson is a fantastic Judas, though, maybe the star of the show.These flaws in the characterizations of Jesus and Mary Magdalene (and slightly in Pilate's case) ultimately make the whole work flawed, in my opinion, and if someone would rewrite some lines, I think it could be truer to the Gospels and just as powerful (though maybe there'd have to be some redoing of &quot;angel&quot; Judas's chorus-accompanied song &amp; dance number to Jesus of the show's theme song after Judas has died and before Jesus is crucified - I still don't quite get that scene).",3,"Good, but flawed",978739200,"01 6, 2001",2001,3947,"['are', 'many', 'powerful', 'moments', 'movie', 'good', 'see', 'Jesus', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'followers', 'as', 'well', 'critics', 'sense', 'truer', 'Gospels', 'other', 'Jesus', 'like', 'movie', 'flawed', 'major', 'ways:1', 'Jesus', 'ambivalent', 'unsure', 'why', 'die', 'God', 'Father', 'purpose', 'death', 'unnecessary', 'detraction', 'Webber', 'amp', 'Rice', 'seem', 'be', 'familiar', 'enough', 'Gospels', 'so', 'recognize', 'Jesus', 'spoke', 'understood', 'sacrificial', 'amp', 'atoning', 'purpose', 'death', 'Ultimately', 'Jesus', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'dying', 'becomes', 'inexplicable', 'not', 'just', 'Himself', 'hearing', 'and/or', 'watching', 'story', 'Rewriting', 'lines', 'could', 'help', 'film/play', 'immeasurably', 'regard', 'even', 'was', 'having', 'Jesus', 'coming', 'realize', 'purpose', 'life', 'death', 'path', 'i.e.', 'gradual', 'increasing', 'understanding', 'rather', 'early-realized', 'one', 'just', 'reduce', 'death', 'innocent', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'establish', 'God', 'kingdom', 'love', 'who', 'reason', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'crucifying', 'Him', 'quot', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'do', 'quot', 'leaving', 'ponder', 'what', 'meaning', 'might', 'have', 'lives', 'humanistic', 'portrayals', 'Jesus', 'do', 'Webber', 'amp', 'Rice', 'seem', 'do', 'here', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Jesus', 'puzzle', 'humans', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'quot', 'meaningful', 'quot', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'much', 'film', 'said', 'fatal', 'flaw.But', 'when', 'Jesus', 'crowds', 'come', 'Jerusalem', 'sing', 'quot', 'Hosanna', 'quot', 'then', 'one', 'verse', 'sing', 'quot', 'Hey', 'J.C.', 'J.C.', 'would', 'die', 'quot', 'image', 'second', 'Jesus', 'face', 'smile', 'indeed', 'will', 'have', 'die', 'fantastic', 'shot.2', 'implication', 'suggestion', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'had', 'sought', 'have', 'physical', 'relations', 'Jesus', 'Gospels', 'was', 'one', 'whom', 'Jesus', 'had', 'cast', 'out', 'seven', 'demons', 'and/or', 'one', 'many', 'sins', 'Jesus', 'had', 'forgiven', 'relationship', 'Him', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Apparently', 'Webber', 'amp', 'Rice', 'wanted', 'portray', 'different', 'Magdalene.3', 'Pilate', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'Jesus', 'too', 'desirous', 'saving', 'life', 'Brian', 'Dennen', 'superb', 'Pilate', 'superb', 'rendering', 'characterization', 'Pilate', '4', 'Jews', 'not', 'just', 'Jewish', 'leaders', 'turn', 'on/against', 'Jesus', 'too', 'quickly', 'too', 'violently', 'arrested', 'moreso', 'Gospel', 'records', 'seem', 'indicate', 'think', 'Gospels', 'Jesus', 'Chief', 'Priests', 'Scribes', 'Pharisees', 'Elders', 'who', 'will', 'turn', 'Him', 'people', 'had', 'part', 'not', 'so', 'strongly', 'film', 'portrays.5', 'Jesus', 'angrily', 'Judas', 'couple', 'scenes', 'once', 'when', 'confronting', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'again', 'when', 'away', 'betray', 'Him', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Gospel', 'tale', 'make', 'sense', 'first', 'criticism', 'Jesus', 'confused', 'reason', 'must', 'die', 'views', 'fate', 'Judas', 'fated', 'arrange', 'arrest', 'seem', 'be', 'Jesus', 'view', 'statement', 'Pilate', 'Pilate', 'had', 'flogged', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'save', 'life', 'Jesus', 'quot', 'fixed', 'quot', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'fantastic', 'Judas', 'though', 'maybe', 'star', 'show.These', 'flaws', 'characterizations', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'slightly', 'Pilate', 'case', 'ultimately', 'make', 'whole', 'work', 'flawed', 'opinion', 'someone', 'would', 'rewrite', 'lines', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'truer', 'Gospels', 'just', 'powerful', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'redoing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Judas', 'chorus-accompanied', 'song', 'amp', 'dance', 'number', 'Jesus', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'Judas', 'died', 'Jesus', 'crucified', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'scene']",N/A

52196,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,078322544X,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[8, 12]","Slightly irreverent, slightly surreal, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" remains unique amongst film depictions of the Christ story. First off, it's clearly a product of 1973. The fashion statements, music, choreography, catch phrases (""what's the buzz""), hairdos, and cinematography all scream early 1970s. For those unfamiliar with 1970s culture, prepare to feel slightly disoriented. This film belongs to a time when freeze frame, double exposure, and rack focus could be called ""effects"". Secondly, Judas Iscariot plays a central role here. He dramatically questions Jesus and sings ""he's just a man"" and, in the big finale, ""Do you think you're what they say you are?"" Jesus is not seen performing miracles (though they're mentioned in various songs); when confronted with a pack of lepers he's depicted as helpless and pleads ""there are too many of you!"" and they engulf him. Third, and most important, there is little or no emphasis on the resurrection in the film. We don't see the disciples looking upon his stigmata or spreading the word, ala St.Paul, about ""Christ is Risen"". We see Jesus on the cross uttering some of the famous final phrases (one is very badly altered to ""Father, why have you forgotten me?""), and then slumping over. Not only that, Jesus' mother doesn't appear anywhere. She isn't even mentioned. So, many things traditionally associated with Christianity are entirely left out of the movie. This raises a rather big ""why?"" Just what was the point of the movie and the Broadway musical that preceded it? If it was to inspire Christians then someone didn't do their homework. But maybe someone had something else in mind. The film's title ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" probably contains a clue. Surrounding Jesus with lavish musical numbers (lavish for the time, that is), juxtaposing ostentatiously dressed dancers and singers 1970s-style with shots of Jesus carrying the cross sends mixed messages. Is Christ being claimed as a ""Superstar"" in an irreverant or a glorifying manner? Should viewers laugh tongue-in-cheek or be in awe of the film's final scene? Strangely, either response makes sense. The film can be viewed as an attempt at a modern and popularized tribute or as a statement about the commericialization of religion. Nonetheless, the questioning atmosphere and the big diversions from traditional Christianity suggest that the movie/musical were not necessarily intended for the Inspirational section. But the movie contains no absolutely definitive statements on its position toward its subject matter.That said, the movie contains some great music and some stunning shots of the Israeli landscape (though the choice of scenery makes the story look as though it's happening in the middle of nowhere and the cast always seems too small for the wide shots). The ""whipping song"" contains a particularly intense guitar riff. The actor who portrays Pilate puts on a stunning performance (the clever use of a clear bowl when he washes his hands makes his famous statement even more pointed). And lastly, the King Herod scene is tremendously funny, though also bordering on the absurdly surreal.Overall, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" is an entertaining movie. It's dated and silly in places, but moving in others.

52203,AG6NBC3NLVVJ,078322544X,Gubben,"[4, 10]","Let me first say I had the original British record of JCS as pre-teen back in 1970 and it was one of my favorites albums for years. I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and was disappointed not because I thought it was badly made or the performances were off but simply because it was not what I imagined how it would look. I knew this album backwards and forward and in my mind created how the characters, the sets and costumes would look like and it was closer to one of those biblical movies like The Robe, or The Ten Commandments. Today viewing this movie as an adult I am glad Jesus Christ Superstar was not given the Hollywood bigger than life treatment but instead was produced as an experimental play would have been in 1973. The stripped down sets are bathed in Israeli desert sunlight, sets consist of scaffolds and ancient ruins in arid surrounding. The costumes are a mix of simple peasant clothes from 2000 years ago and modern military attire while the high priest resemble black scarabs. The performers arrive in an old bus and work to get in costume and prepare sets. The performancesl are all top notch with a few roles being played by actors/singers from the original concept album. True to that album what becomes of Jesus post crucifixion is not really addressed and performers in this re-enactment head back to their bus in the end to go home. This film does not escape the time in which it was made few do but I am grateful to the producers and director for taking a chance and giving a production that is as out of the box visually as the Tim Rice, Andrew Lloyd Webber concept recording was. I am excited to see this movie coming to Blu-Ray and hope they address my one real criticism of this production the audio.

I keep reading these reviews that say this movie upset so many people, or don't waste your money on this. The creators of this movie even say it is not all that christian because it really is only a rock opera, and that is all it should be looked at as.But enough on my complaining about other reviewers. I've watched this movie for years and never gotten sick of it. Just the creativity of the filming and the locations they film in are truly amazing. This whole movie is filmed in Israel. Besides the addition of Could We Start Again, Please? every song is included from the original album. However, only 2 of the original vocalist from the album are in this movie and that's Yvonne Elliman and Barry Dennen. Even though vocals were recorded at a different time, they try to keep the vocals sounding like they are walking and running through enviroments, which is why the vocals never sound perfect. To be quite honest, the only vocalist who sounds perfect is Yvonne Elliman, she has an amazing voice.Carl Anderson as Judas steals the show, his performance is just amazing from the start with Heaven On Their Minds, which i thought was the best song in the whole movie. Too bad he died just last year, he was still very young.Ted Neeley is a little shaky in the beginning but gets stronger as the movie progresses and him and Carl Anderson have such power together, especially during The Last Supper, but Ted Neeley really does a magnificent job on the song Gethsemane, which i think is his best performance in the movie.Again, Yvonne Elliman is errorless in her voice, she does such a great job. She is perfect in the songs Everythings Alright, Could We Start Again, Please? and of course her hit song I Don't Know How To Love Him.Barry Dennen is also a very talented actor, not the best voice in the world but he is a great actor, which makes up for that.Bob Bingham as Caiaphas i liked because i'm a singer myself and hearing that bass voice amazed me.The filming of this movie is not simple because it is filmed all on location in Israel, and the amazing thing is, that most of that set they are in was there, which is cool.Like most Religious movies, they try to stay loyal to the story but Jesus Christ Superstar does it in a different manner, trying to combine the story with modern times for example. The soldiers are wearing boots, purple shirts. Even though this was 1973, not really that modern anymore (lol).Also like most movies, it's not going to please everybody, no movie can do that, no matter what the story is about. Even the recent Passion of The Christ by Mel Gibson didn't please everybody.Overall, this is a Classic that really stands the test of time and i think will be talked about for years to come, not just for the story but for the performance side of this movie.Extras on the DVD are good as well, an Interview with Tim Rice and a great Commentary by Norman Jewison and Ted Neeley, and a Photo Gallery.",5,A Classic Musical and A Classic Movie,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2967,"['What', 'wrong', 'people', 'keep', 'reading', 'reviews', 'say', 'movie', 'upset', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'creators', 'movie', 'even', 'say', 'not', 'christian', 'really', 'only', 'rock', 'opera', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'as.But', 'enough', 'complaining', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'years', 'never', 'gotten', 'sick', 'Just', 'creativity', 'filming', 'locations', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'whole', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Israel', 'addition', 'Could', 'Start', 'Again', 'Please', 'song', 'included', 'original', 'album', 'However', 'only', '2', 'original', 'vocalist', 'album', 'are', 'movie', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'Barry', 'Dennen', 'Even', 'vocals', 'were', 'recorded', 'different', 'time', 'try', 'keep', 'vocals', 'sounding', 'are', 'walking', 'running', 'enviroments', 'why', 'vocals', 'never', 'sound', 'perfect', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'only', 'vocalist', 'who', 'perfect', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'amazing', 'voice.Carl', 'Anderson', 'Judas', 'show', 'performance', 'just', 'amazing', 'start', 'Heaven', 'Their', 'Minds', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'song', 'whole', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'died', 'just', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'young.Ted', 'Neeley', 'little', 'shaky', 'beginning', 'stronger', 'movie', 'progresses', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'have', 'such', 'power', 'together', 'especially', 'Last', 'Supper', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'really', 'magnificent', 'job', 'song', 'Gethsemane', 'i', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'movie.Again', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'errorless', 'voice', 'great', 'job', 'perfect', 'songs', 'Everythings', 'Alright', 'Could', 'Start', 'Again', 'Please', 'course', 'hit', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'Love', 'Him.Barry', 'Dennen', 'also', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'not', 'best', 'voice', 'world', 'great', 'actor', 'up', 'that.Bob', 'Bingham', 'Caiaphas', 'i', 'liked', 'i', ""'m"", 'singer', 'hearing', 'bass', 'voice', 'amazed', 'me.The', 'filming', 'movie', 'not', 'simple', 'filmed', 'location', 'Israel', 'amazing', 'thing', 'most', 'set', 'are', 'was', 'cool.Like', 'most', 'Religious', 'movies', 'try', 'stay', 'loyal', 'story', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'different', 'manner', 'trying', 'combine', 'story', 'modern', 'times', 'example', 'soldiers', 'are', 'wearing', 'boots', 'purple', 'shirts', 'Even', 'was', '1973', 'not', 'really', 'modern', 'anymore', 'lol', '.Also', 'most', 'movies', 'not', 'going', 'please', 'everybody', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'matter', 'what', 'story', 'Even', 'recent', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', ""n't"", 'please', 'everybody.Overall', 'Classic', 'really', 'test', 'time', 'i', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'years', 'come', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'performance', 'side', 'movie.Extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'Interview', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'great', 'Commentary', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'Photo', 'Gallery']",N/A

But it has aged tremendously. To center the film on the Jesus who started, without even knowing it, a revolution that leads him to die is pass&eacute;, and false because the Roman legions were by far strong enough to start that revolution. To center the film on Judas the traitor who delivers Jesus and then hang himself is also very untrendy and absurd now we have the Gospel of this poor systematically scapegoatish Judas. There is a lot of good singing and interesting music for sure but the general idea seems to me slightly outlandish. The emphasis is definitely by far too much on the Jews, the priests, high priest and other officials from the temple but also the crowd, simple people who really are too heavy on the ""crucify him"" bit. Today that sounds and looks definitely out of tone and the use of the good old Jewish purple to really emphasize this Jewish responsibility in the crucifixion is just coming from another age that Johan Sebastian Bach had been quite cautious not to follow even in his Saint John's Passion. Too bad because it has always been a good idea for me to put music, no matter which type, on these poetical myths of ours because they were invented and imagined in a language that was necessarily enriched with prosody and music from beginning to end. But the music must not be the tree that hides the forest and the forest is the revulsive contractions this century was going through in those days. A first globalization that was to reduce that Middle East to nothing at all for a few centuries just for the pleasure of Roman legions and the profit of Rome. A temple, a city and a people were not to be taken into account in such a prospect. But the film does not show that at all. Too bad.

A busload of actors and actresses roars out of the desert. Yvonne Elliman in a red top and bluejeans gets off. She does her eyebrows in a mirror. Yvonne is part Hawaiian, French and Japanese. A cross is lowered from the top of the bus. Carl Anderson immediately puts distance between himself and the others. Ted Neeley as Jesus prepares, and the drama begins. Black Judas broods on his mountaintop. Jesus' followers want to know, ""What's the buzz?"" Yvonne as Mary Magdalene cools Jesus' face and washes his feet. He defends her against Judas. Onionhead Caiaphas and conehead Annas are characters. Yvonne sings Everything's Alright, lighting a lamp. Judas gripes about ointment. Jesus says there will always be poor. Yvonne continues her pampering. Caiaphas exhorts, ""This Jesus must die!"" Jesus enters the city with Rosannas and palm fronds. Dancers materialize amid stone columns. I spot a sexy blonde. Pilate sings about his dream. An anachronistic temple scene follows, post cards and cash registers. The sick and crippled mob Jesus. He returns to his tent. Mary tucks him in and breaks into ""I Don't Know How To Love Him."" She strolls in the windy night, casting her shadow on a rock. Disconsolate Judas flees approaching tanks. He bargains with the council. Silver is dropped at his feet. Planes fly overhead. The Last Supper is a picnic. Jesus challenges Judas. Judas plants his kiss. Jesus is tried by Caiaphas and Annas. Mary reminds Peter he would deny Him. Jesus is taken to Pilate, then to Herod. Herod is a disgusting hedonist, frizzy-headed and big-bellied with colored glasses and a medallion. His ragtime piano and dance number is the most inappropriate skit in this irreverent Gospel. Yvonne Elliman and Peter do Could We Start Again Please? Yvonne has moves like Agnetha's. Judas feels remorse. Discordant music spurs him. He runs blindly, yanks off his belt and hangs himself. Pilate has Jesus flogged. The theme begins, ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Neeley turns and extends his arms. His garment is fresh. Judas descends singing, and dancers go wild. Soldiers raise the cross. Magdalene cries. A deranged piano plays. Silence. The cast is in street clothes. Yvonne boards the bus. She looks back as if something has been forgotten. The cross is seen against a setting sun. The Greatest Story Ever Told shows the divine side of Jesus. Superstar shows the human side. John Lennon's comment about The Beatles being more popular than Jesus made Superstar possible.

Pouliot,"[8, 8]","What is so surprising about this film is (in spite being dressed it up in modern garb) how faithful it is the spirit of the gospel, and how alluring is its very human portrayal of Jesus Christ. The movie's occasional blips and imperfections don't prevent it from being worth repeated viewings.Thought the sound quality is a bit disappointing, musically, the film hews very closely to the Broadway album. Two songs are added: ""Then We are Decided"" -- a deliberately disjointed piece in which Caiphas and Annas debate ways to sell their plans to the rest of the Sanhedrin -- and ""Could We Start Again Please?"" a sweet and anguished ballad in which Peter, Mary and the rest of the disciples plead with Christ to take them on a happier, safer track.Visually, the film is stunning. The desert locations are aptly sunny and chalky. The choreography is energetic and fitting. Costumes are spare and evocative -- a purple toga for Pilate, purple T-shirts and green cargo pants for the soldiers, black vulture-like costumes for the priests and simple monochrome peasant garb for Jesus and the Apostles. Ted Neely inhabited the role of Jesus (and has ever since, on the touring circuit) and Carl Anderson was utterly remarkable as a doubting, conflicted Judas. Yvonne Elliman ably reprised her Broadway and cast album role as Mary Magdalene.Director Norman Jewison seems to try to use the film to comment on contemporary issues. Roman soldiers tote automatic weapons; the sellers in the Temple hawk weapons, women and weed. Amazingly, this does not detract from the story of Jesus. Jewison commited a a few missteps, and they are jarring, if memorable. Israeli jets and tanks inexplicably chase Judas through the desert. The dance of Simon Zealotes is overactive to the point of weirdness. People who dislike the movie love pointing to these flaws. Yet there is so much heart and honesty in the film that these are easily forgiven.As in the cast recording, there is no explicit resurrection scene. The actors (except for Jesus) re-board the Israeli tour bus that brought them, their once-celebratory mood turned somber and reflective. Yet in the movie's last scene, a long shot of the setting sun, a shepherd leading a herd of sheep crosses the screen. Perhaps Jewison is hinting subtly to the life of the Church after the death of Christ. For a movie born in the tumult of the anti-religious 1970s, this is quite a statement of faith.",4,Faithful and watchable (with wrinkles),1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,2425,"['What', 'so', 'surprising', 'film', 'spite', 'being', 'dressed', 'up', 'modern', 'garb', 'how', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'gospel', 'how', 'alluring', 'very', 'human', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'movie', 'occasional', 'blips', 'imperfections', 'do', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'being', 'worth', 'repeated', 'sound', 'quality', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'musically', 'film', 'very', 'closely', 'Broadway', 'album', 'Two', 'songs', 'are', 'added', 'Then', 'are', 'Decided', 'deliberately', 'disjointed', 'piece', 'Caiphas', 'Annas', 'debate', 'ways', 'sell', 'plans', 'rest', 'Sanhedrin', 'Could', 'Start', 'Again', 'Please', 'sweet', 'anguished', 'ballad', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'rest', 'disciples', 'plead', 'Christ', 'take', 'happier', 'safer', 'track.Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'desert', 'locations', 'are', 'aptly', 'sunny', 'chalky', 'choreography', 'energetic', 'fitting', 'Costumes', 'are', 'spare', 'evocative', 'purple', 'toga', 'Pilate', 'purple', 'T-shirts', 'green', 'cargo', 'pants', 'soldiers', 'black', 'vulture-like', 'costumes', 'priests', 'simple', 'monochrome', 'peasant', 'garb', 'Jesus', 'Apostles', 'Ted', 'Neely', 'inhabited', 'role', 'Jesus', 'ever', 'touring', 'circuit', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'was', 'utterly', 'remarkable', 'doubting', 'conflicted', 'Judas', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'ably', 'reprised', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'album', 'role', 'Mary', 'Magdalene.Director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'try', 'use', 'film', 'comment', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'tote', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'sellers', 'Temple', 'hawk', 'weapons', 'women', 'weed', 'Amazingly', 'not', 'detract', 'story', 'Jesus', 'Jewison', 'commited', 'few', 'missteps', 'are', 'jarring', 'memorable', 'Israeli', 'jets', 'tanks', 'inexplicably', 'chase', 'Judas', 'desert', 'dance', 'Simon', 'Zealotes', 'overactive', 'point', 'weirdness', 'People', 'who', 'dislike', 'movie', 'love', 'pointing', 'flaws', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'honesty', 'film', 'are', 'easily', 'forgiven.As', 'cast', 'recording', 'explicit', 'resurrection', 'scene', 'actors', 'Jesus', 're-board', 'Israeli', 'tour', 'bus', 'brought', 'once-celebratory', 'mood', 'turned', 'somber', 'reflective', 'movie', 'last', 'scene', 'long', 'shot', 'setting', 'sun', 'shepherd', 'leading', 'herd', 'sheep', 'crosses', 'screen', 'Perhaps', 'Jewison', 'hinting', 'subtly', 'life', 'Church', 'death', 'Christ', 'movie', 'born', 'tumult', 'anti-religious', '1970s', 'quite', 'statement', 'faith']",N/A

Make no mistake, this is one of the great movie musicals, and it was at least 20 years ahead of its time. I'm grateful for having it in my collection, but I have to rate this Special Edition DVD with four stars instead of the five it should deserve.The DVD does full justice to Douglas Slocombe's striking cinematography, but there's a problem with the audio -- one that has been perpetuated in every video rendition of the movie to date: The balance is off between the vocals and Andre Previn's terrific orchestrations, meaning the instrumental side of the music is too subdued and a little muddy. This is not the way the movie sounded in theaters, nor is it the way it sounds on the soundtrack album. If Universal Home Video ever gets around to issuing JCS on Blu-ray (which is lo-o-o-o-ng overdue), I hope they (FINALLY!) take the trouble to get the audio mix right, rather than simply continuing the mistake of VHS, laserdisc and DVD.

The sound was just as good, but then I don't have super speakers and a monster TV.  The sad part of the movie is the historical discrepancies.  That's not what happened in real life.  Mary Magdaline was not a prostitute.  Jesus didn't suffer pain.  Think about this logically -- if he can overcome death, doesn't that lead to the fact that he can overcome pain, too.  He didn't say ""God why has thought forgotten me"" on the cross -- nor ""God, why has thou forsaken me.""  He said, ""God, you hath glorified me.""  And, doesn't that make sense, too.  Jesus chose to give his life for humanity.  He knew that he was one with God.  He definately would not have felt forsaken.  Jesus was a very special man and we keep judging him with out limited earth-bound thinking.  We don't have the capabilities to think as big as Jesus did, so we make things up.

52243,A2NJO6YE954DBH,078322544X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[96, 114]","After the bizarre Broadway staging of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera, the film version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; had to be a more traditional offering.  Producer-Director Norman Jewison filmed on location in Israel, using natural settings and sparsely constructed sets for what is essentially a string of music videos (since it was written as a studio album first, the music presents problems for moving from one scene to the next).  The framing device for the film is the cast arriving/departing by bus.  Ted Neeley's voice is suited to the role, but certainly he is the shortest Jesus I can recall seeing in films.  Yvonne Elliman and Barry Dennen remain from the original studio album and Broadway production as Mary Magdalen and Pilate, which is perfectly all right.  However, it is clearly Carl Anderson as Judas who gives the best performance in the film.  The film version suffers from the inadequate voices of several of the supporting cast members (most notably Josh Mostel as Herod) and the grossly reduced chorus of singers which never comes close to matching the number of bodies on screen, and there are a few unintentional laughs (as when Israeli tanks come over the dune and chase Judas).  But the use of paintings depicting the crucifixion and the final shot of sheep being herded past the cross the cast leaves behind on the hill, are particularly effective.  Of course as with most movies, if you want to watch it you want to get a hold of the widescreen edition, otherwise you cannot appreciate the Last Supper tableau or just enjoy the compositional elements of the shots.  Every Easter weekend I watch this film, even if I do not have time to do all of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or &quot;The Greatest Story Every Told.&quot;  The only thing radical here is the music, but I still have to think it qualifies as the requisite joyful noise.",4,Rice &amp; Lloyd Webber's Operatic Passion Play on Film,987206400,"04 14, 2001",2001,1889,"['bizarre', 'Broadway', 'staging', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'rock', 'opera', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'quot', 'had', 'be', 'more', 'traditional', 'offering', 'Producer-Director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'filmed', 'location', 'Israel', 'using', 'natural', 'settings', 'sparsely', 'constructed', 'sets', 'what', 'essentially', 'string', 'music', 'videos', 'was', 'written', 'studio', 'album', 'first', 'music', 'problems', 'moving', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'framing', 'device', 'film', 'cast', 'arriving/departing', 'bus', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'voice', 'suited', 'role', 'certainly', 'shortest', 'Jesus', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'films', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'Barry', 'Dennen', 'remain', 'original', 'studio', 'album', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Mary', 'Magdalen', 'Pilate', 'perfectly', 'right', 'However', 'clearly', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'Judas', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'film', 'version', 'suffers', 'inadequate', 'voices', 'several', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'most', 'notably', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Herod', 'grossly', 'reduced', 'chorus', 'singers', 'never', 'close', 'matching', 'number', 'bodies', 'screen', 'are', 'few', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'when', 'Israeli', 'tanks', 'come', 'dune', 'chase', 'Judas', 'use', 'paintings', 'depicting', 'crucifixion', 'final', 'shot', 'sheep', 'being', 'herded', 'cross', 'cast', 'hill', 'are', 'particularly', 'effective', 'course', 'most', 'movies', 'want', 'watch', 'want', 'get', 'hold', 'widescreen', 'edition', 'otherwise', 'can', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Last', 'Supper', 'tableau', 'just', 'enjoy', 'compositional', 'elements', 'shots', 'Easter', 'weekend', 'watch', 'film', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'do', 'quot', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Every', 'Told.', 'quot', 'only', 'thing', 'radical', 'here', 'music', 'still', 'have', 'think', 'requisite', 'joyful', 'noise']",N/A

Quido ""quidrock""","[4, 4]","But we have a new tradition of viewing this DVD every Christmas Night, to sort of shake off the story of the nativity and reground the last 7 days of Christ.  This, our favorite version of the telling of the tale, is crafted from the first true rock opera hit from partners Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.  It is odd, but the Webber format of Broadway operas is unpopular in our household; this first play was, however, truly enjoyable and a real departure from the norm back in 1973.Norman Jewison artfully stages the play to film by utilization of a mix of period costumes and scenes with modern day conveniences, particularly as they reflect the militarism of his modern day setting in Israel.  Most often praised are the performances of Carl Anderson, who took over the role that made Ben Vereen a star, as Judas,  (The Rice/Webber storyline is unique in its emphasis on Judas as a character, what drove him to his betrayal, and also the characterization of Jesus as one who has doubts about the wisdom of his final days), and the cinematography on a sparse set filmed in the desert region of Israel.  Controversial was Ted Neeley in the lead role, a man beset by media and hype which led his quiet revolution in a direction that led to his inevitable doom.  The film and play do not deal with the resurrection, also a controversial decision at the time of its writing; because the &quot;feel good&quot; aspects of resurrection generally help we Christians recover from the shock of Jesus portrayed on the cross.  Neeley, who has the voice for the role, did not have the stature, being slim and short.  Somehow, for me, this humanizes Jesus into belief as the quiet carpenter from Galilee, who must change his whole world in order to prepare a belief and values system for millions in the centuries to follow.  In the scene where Jesus clears the temple, there is little doubt that Jewison chose well; the fire and spirit in Neeley surfaces, and you throw your belief behind him thanks to this scene.A beautiful film that helped to bridge some of the gaps of the theater staging, with memorable music and outstanding Rice lyrics .... this is a film experience.",5,It's a little bizarre....,1009238400,"12 25, 2001",2001,2166,"['have', 'new', 'tradition', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'Night', 'sort', 'shake', 'story', 'nativity', 'reground', 'last', '7', 'days', 'Christ', 'favorite', 'version', 'telling', 'tale', 'crafted', 'first', 'true', 'rock', 'opera', 'hit', 'partners', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'odd', 'Webber', 'format', 'Broadway', 'operas', 'unpopular', 'household', 'first', 'play', 'was', 'however', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'real', 'departure', 'norm', 'back', '1973.Norman', 'Jewison', 'artfully', 'play', 'film', 'utilization', 'mix', 'period', 'costumes', 'scenes', 'modern', 'day', 'conveniences', 'particularly', 'reflect', 'militarism', 'modern', 'day', 'setting', 'Israel', 'Most', 'often', 'praised', 'are', 'performances', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'made', 'Ben', 'Vereen', 'star', 'Judas', 'Rice/Webber', 'storyline', 'unique', 'emphasis', 'Judas', 'character', 'what', 'drove', 'betrayal', 'also', 'characterization', 'Jesus', 'one', 'who', 'doubts', 'wisdom', 'final', 'days', 'cinematography', 'sparse', 'set', 'filmed', 'desert', 'region', 'Israel', 'Controversial', 'was', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'lead', 'role', 'man', 'beset', 'media', 'hype', 'led', 'quiet', 'revolution', 'direction', 'led', 'inevitable', 'doom', 'film', 'play', 'do', 'not', 'deal', 'resurrection', 'also', 'controversial', 'decision', 'time', 'writing', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'quot', 'aspects', 'resurrection', 'generally', 'help', 'Christians', 'recover', 'shock', 'Jesus', 'portrayed', 'cross', 'Neeley', 'who', 'voice', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'stature', 'being', 'slim', 'short', 'Somehow', 'Jesus', 'belief', 'quiet', 'carpenter', 'Galilee', 'who', 'must', 'change', 'whole', 'world', 'order', 'prepare', 'belief', 'values', 'system', 'millions', 'centuries', 'follow', 'scene', 'where', 'Jesus', 'temple', 'little', 'doubt', 'Jewison', 'chose', 'well', 'fire', 'spirit', 'Neeley', 'surfaces', 'throw', 'belief', 'thanks', 'scene.A', 'beautiful', 'film', 'helped', 'bridge', 'gaps', 'theater', 'staging', 'memorable', 'music', 'outstanding', 'Rice', 'lyrics', 'film', 'experience']",N/A

At the time it was released, JCS was daring, and, if not revolutionary, certainly contentious even in the wild 60s/70s.  As some have stated, it doesn't necessarily represent biblical truth.  Considering the endless debate over what qualifies, that bit of criticism is almost irrelevant.  In any case the film makes no promises nor pretends to be anything but a speculative take from Judas Iscariot's perspective on the last days of Jesus.  Whatever historical truth can be discovered in the Bible is more or less present in the film, modern trappings aside of course.  The politics of Jesus' arrest and murder fit perfectly with the situation at the time.  A country occupied by the Romans, local authorities trying to deal with internal unrest, and the potential bloodbath that could be triggered by the teachings of a so-called but increasingly popular ""messiah""... what else could it lead to except his very public and messy death?  Within that believable and so very human context, Jesus' life was indeed sacrificed for the lives of others.As for the film itself, Carl Anderson performs wonderfully, acquainting us with a Judas who was no less conflicted than he was pragmatic.  Ted Neeley's performance, vocal limitations aside, is also convincing and sincere.  The supporting cast give them a solid foundation, with remarkably earnest performances by Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene and Barry Dennen(superb as Pontius Pilate), that help carry this film to its poignant, heart wrenching climax.

Ted Neeley's reedy performance here just doesn't measure up. Yvonne Elliman reprises her fine Mary Magdalene and Carl Anderson is a fiery Judas. The other performances are okay to eh.The film seems fundamentally misconceived. First of all, the traveling-troupe-descending-on-Mid-East-ruin motif smacks of high concept/low budget: we don't have to build sets or hire extras! The prevailing hippy aesthetic was dated even in 1973 (though Herod's Song has some Glam flash). The choreographed scenes look like an aerobics class run amok. The cinematography is nice, but the expansive vistas dwarf the actors and emphasize the cast-of-dozens production. This is a wide screen spectacle without the spectacle.And then there's all that sun. This isn't ""Godspell"" for Christ's sake. JCS is a dark and doubt-ridden take on the Gospels that invests characters like Jesus, Judas and Pilate with psychological depth. That interiority is undermined here by all the blaring sun and wide shots.

JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is modern man's way to ask Jesus if it was all worth it.  While the libretto tends to &quot;martyrize&quot; Judas, the power of Christ still shines forth, and it's to the writers' credit that JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR in spite of all its modern juxtapositioning, remains a powerful and very spiritual experience.  The late Carl Anderson certainly shines in his role as Judas, giving us a man who can't believe in the divinity of his friend; who is jealous of the attention lavished on him; and who uses his own weakness to blame Christ for his predestined role.  Ted Neeley, though small in stature, has a powerful presence, and his &quot;I Only Want to Say&quot; still manages to bring a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye; Yvonne Elliman's soaring presence as the mystified Mary Magdalene is also a highlight, her love and devotion evidenced in every glance at the Christ; Barry Dennen is tremendous as Pontius Pilate, and even though his effeminancy is played up, his fear of deportation and the repercussions therein is brilliantly played.  Joshua Motel as the plump Herod brings a small role to vivid life in the sadly mocking &quot;Herod's Song.&quot;Jewison uses modern motif, such as the tanks, soaring airplanes and the very modern temple yard sale, to bring an air of unreality and fantasy to the production.The final scene where everyone boards the bus except Jesus is stunning in its irony and simplicity.In years to come, people will look back and see what a truly marvelous movie this is.

52271,AYWIO6OYAGFGQ,078322544X,"pm444 ""pm444""","[1, 1]","I came across this on cable HD on demand and chose it out of curiosity. At first, the elements that are dated (and there are some) had me smiling (and sometimes cringing), but the music kept me watching and listening.  It had been years since I'd listened to any performance at all, and I had never seen the film and had never listened to the movie soundtrack.  I was familiar with the original London studio recording, but that was it.  Three or four songs into the movie, I was hooked and watched it straight through. In spite of what one reviewer here called the film's ""hippy dippy"" traits, I ended up enjoying it enough to watch it again...and then proceeded to watch it many more times.Overall, I think it's extremely faithful to the original studio concept performance (as all fans of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" know, it appeared as a studio recording before it ever appeared on stage or screen).  Several of the performers from the studio version appear in the film, most notably Yvonne Elliman and Barry Dennen.  Ted Neeley plays Jesus, and reviewers tend to either love his performance or hate it.  I ended up really liking him in this role.  He looks the role, at least based on the visual images of Jesus that many of us grew up with, and he uses his voice to show the change from a rather naive character to one who feels the supreme disappointment and anger of betrayal, not just by Judas but by his own God.  I'm not discussing the accuracy of any of this from a theological or Biblical standpoint, but strictly from a dramatic perspective of what makes sense theatrically.The soundtrack (on the DVD, not the CD recording) sounds great.  The remastering is very clear and well balanced.  This is based on my HD cable reception, but I found that for a 2-channel stereo soundtrack, it was surprisingly dimensional and realistic.  I have downloaded the audio CD and there is a huge difference between the audio quality of that and the sound you'll hear on the DVD, with the DVD being much better.  The video image is excellent for a movie that was filmed in 1973 (again, based on my HD cable signal).  I expect that the DVD itself is probably even better.There are some elements of the film that date it, and the first time you watch the movie, they can be distracting, annoying, or even laughable.  But it's worth watching a second time, because they tend to fade into the background and are overpowered by the other elements that have aged very well.  The first time I watched, I was put off by the opening and ending with the entire cast showing up on a bus, unpacking their gear, and going into rehearsal mode.  But the music is so beautiful that this contrived set-up becomes not only acceptable but you can even see why the director chose to start and end this way.  Some of the costumes do look ""hippy dippy"", but I came to overlook that, too.  There are several brief scenes with fighter jets and tanks....again, just listen to the music and forget about the visual imagery.You can see that the filmmaker tried to keep the setting as authentic as possible, in spite of the jets, tanks, and some other modernisms.  There are some stunningly beautiful scenes, others that are good but not great, and still others that fall flat, but overall, it's successful.As anyone who has read about the various versions of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" will have already discovered, people have very strong opinions about the wide variety of performances that are available.  I have grown to appreciate and enjoy this movie in a way that I would never have guessed the first time I saw it, which was just a couple of weeks ago. Not only that, the movie has re-ignited my interest in the music, which I find that I am listening to over and over again.  For those reasons, I highly recommend this film.",5,Holds up well even after all these years,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,3799,"['came', 'cable', 'HD', 'demand', 'chose', 'curiosity', 'first', 'elements', 'are', 'dated', 'are', 'had', 'smiling', 'sometimes', 'cringing', 'music', 'kept', 'watching', 'listening', 'had', 'been', 'years', ""'d"", 'listened', 'performance', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'listened', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'familiar', 'original', 'London', 'studio', 'recording', 'was', 'Three', 'four', 'songs', 'movie', 'was', 'hooked', 'watched', 'straight', 'through', 'spite', 'what', 'one', 'reviewer', 'here', 'called', 'film', 'hippy', 'dippy', 'traits', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'then', 'proceeded', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times.Overall', 'think', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'original', 'studio', 'concept', 'performance', 'fans', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'know', 'appeared', 'studio', 'recording', 'ever', 'appeared', 'stage', 'screen', 'Several', 'performers', 'studio', 'version', 'appear', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'Barry', 'Dennen', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'Jesus', 'reviewers', 'tend', 'love', 'performance', 'hate', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'liking', 'role', 'role', 'least', 'based', 'visual', 'images', 'Jesus', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'voice', 'show', 'change', 'rather', 'naive', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'supreme', 'disappointment', 'anger', 'betrayal', 'not', 'just', 'Judas', 'own', 'God', ""'m"", 'not', 'discussing', 'accuracy', 'theological', 'Biblical', 'standpoint', 'strictly', 'dramatic', 'perspective', 'what', 'sense', 'theatrically.The', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'not', 'CD', 'recording', 'great', 'remastering', 'very', 'clear', 'well', 'balanced', 'based', 'HD', 'cable', 'reception', 'found', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'dimensional', 'realistic', 'have', 'downloaded', 'audio', 'CD', 'huge', 'difference', 'audio', 'quality', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'being', 'much', 'better', 'video', 'image', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '1973', 'again', 'based', 'HD', 'cable', 'signal', 'expect', 'DVD', 'probably', 'even', 'are', 'elements', 'film', 'date', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'even', 'laughable', 'worth', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'tend', 'fade', 'background', 'are', 'overpowered', 'other', 'elements', 'have', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'opening', 'ending', 'entire', 'cast', 'showing', 'up', 'bus', 'unpacking', 'gear', 'going', 'rehearsal', 'mode', 'music', 'so', 'beautiful', 'contrived', 'set-up', 'becomes', 'not', 'only', 'acceptable', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'why', 'director', 'chose', 'start', 'end', 'way', 'costumes', 'do', 'look', 'hippy', 'dippy', 'came', 'overlook', 'too', 'are', 'several', 'brief', 'scenes', 'fighter', 'jets', 'tanks', '.again', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'forget', 'visual', 'imagery.You', 'can', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'tried', 'keep', 'setting', 'as', 'authentic', 'possible', 'spite', 'jets', 'tanks', 'other', 'modernisms', 'are', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'others', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'still', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'overall', 'successful.As', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'various', 'versions', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'will', 'have', 'already', 'discovered', 'people', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'opinions', 'wide', 'variety', 'performances', 'are', 'available', 'have', 'grown', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'way', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 're-ignited', 'interest', 'music', 'find', 'am', 'listening', 'over', 'again', 'reasons', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
52272,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,078322544X,P Magnum,"[25, 26]","Jesus Christ Superstar was Andrew Lloyd Webber and Time Rice's first major success.  The rock opera was first a concept album that exploded on the charts hitting number one and spending almost a year in the top ten and unleashed Murray Head on the world.  It was then made into a successful Broadway play starring Ben Vereen.  In 1973, respected director Norman Jewison (In The Heat Of the Night, Fiddler On the Roof) brought it to the big screen.  The film was shot on location in Israel and that gives it an authentic feel.  There is no dialogue in the film, everything is sung in true opera fashion.  It kind is like a forerunner of the music video in that fact.  Mr. Jewison mixes the biblical setting with modern nuances such as guards carrying machine guns, tanks and planes appear and at the beginning of the film, the cast arrives by bus and at the end it leaves on the same bus.  The beginning of the film shows the cast setting up what appears to be a play.  They get into costumes and set up for the play.  The movie focuses on the last seven days of Jesus and Ted Neeley appears in the title role.  The movie focuses on Jesus' relationship with Judas, who is played by Carl Anderson.  The plot likens Jesus to a modern-day rock star, who rises above all the other prophets due to the hype-machine.  Judas thinks that Jesus is believing the hype and moving away from his humble roots.  He turns traitor in the belief he is helping the nation.  At the end, we are left wondering if this was just a play or was it real as all the cast members get on the bus except Mr. Neeley.  The movie fades out quite powerfully in the sunset on the cross.  The movie moves along through the series of songs and is well choreographed.  The album, play and film were highly controversial due to its take on the Passion of Jesus, but putting religious beliefs aside, it is an excellent film.",5,Controversial Rock Opera,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,1884,"['Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'was', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Time', 'Rice', 'first', 'major', 'success', 'rock', 'opera', 'was', 'first', 'concept', 'album', 'exploded', 'charts', 'hitting', 'number', 'one', 'spending', 'almost', 'year', 'top', 'ten', 'unleashed', 'Murray', 'Head', 'world', 'was', 'then', 'made', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'play', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Vereen', '1973', 'respected', 'director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'Heat', 'Night', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'brought', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Israel', 'authentic', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'film', 'everything', 'sung', 'true', 'opera', 'fashion', 'kind', 'forerunner', 'music', 'video', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Jewison', 'mixes', 'biblical', 'setting', 'modern', 'nuances', 'such', 'guards', 'carrying', 'machine', 'guns', 'tanks', 'planes', 'appear', 'beginning', 'film', 'cast', 'bus', 'end', 'same', 'bus', 'beginning', 'film', 'cast', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'be', 'play', 'get', 'costumes', 'set', 'up', 'play', 'movie', 'last', 'seven', 'days', 'Jesus', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'title', 'role', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'relationship', 'Judas', 'who', 'played', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'plot', 'Jesus', 'modern-day', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'other', 'prophets', 'due', 'hype-machine', 'Judas', 'Jesus', 'believing', 'hype', 'moving', 'away', 'humble', 'roots', 'traitor', 'belief', 'helping', 'nation', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'was', 'just', 'play', 'was', 'real', 'cast', 'members', 'get', 'bus', 'Mr.', 'Neeley', 'movie', 'out', 'quite', 'powerfully', 'sunset', 'cross', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'series', 'songs', 'well', 'choreographed', 'album', 'play', 'film', 'were', 'highly', 'controversial', 'due', 'take', 'Passion', 'Jesus', 'putting', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'aside', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

The next week after i got the movie, i had memorized every line. I can sing the whole thing, accurately imitating the voices of all the actors, accents included. Thats quite something. The choreography is incredible, and surprisingly my favorite character is not Jesus, but rather Judas. His voice is particularly striking, especially so in the opening scene (which by the way has some of the most beautiful scenery i have ever seen). The tale it tells is also very interesting and engrossing. You laugh at the funny singing in the beginning (""what's the buzz""), you wince when Jesus is whipped, and you cry when he dies on the cross. It's simply that powerful.

I wasn't disappointed.  I loved the setting, in the desert, the framing device of the hippie troupe arriving in the old bus, and the costumes that reminded me of those magical days.  The cast was excellent.  I like to think of Jesus as being physically stronger than he was portrayed here; Neely is quite small in stature.  But he held his own in spirit, I felt.  His voice is limited but he really spat out some of those songs, giving the impression of a much bigger character.  I didn't mind the ""screeching""--I found it actually quite moving.  All of the other principles are wonderful---the beautiful, compassionate Mary Magdalene, the tortured Judas, the aristocratic, sarcastic Pilate and the wonderfully chubby decadent Herod.  I disagree with the complaints that some reviewers here have made about the lack of agreement with the Jesus of the Bible.  I found the ideas very consistent with my understanding of the Jesus story, and even illuminating.  I loved the human aspects of Jesus as shown by his song in the Garden of Gethsemane.  It brought tears to my eyes!  The humor, the pathos, the tragedy, it's all here.  The music is great enough to carry the story.  My only complaint is that the story ended with the Crucifixion.

I know he's done well since then but, to me, nothing compares to JCS.  I was fortunate to see the musical twice on Broadway and was spellbound by that experience.  With unbridled enthusiasm, I gratefully went to see the movie when it came out.  I  was  appalled!  I don't know what Norman Jewison was thinking of.  He had a &quot;can't miss&quot; production and he proceeded to ruin it with incompetant acting and this abysmal idea that modern Israeli military men and equiptment wander around as part of the backdrop.  I have pondered that &quot;innovation&quot; for years and can only assume that Jewison was trying to make some sort of comment on the present day world being out of touch with the message of Jesus.  If that was the case, why use non-Christians to make the point?  Was the message to show that, 2000 years later, all is still in a state of turmoil in the land He grew up in?  Whatever it may have been, it was a distraction and not an enhancement.&quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; is something worth getting acquinted with.

This viewing brought me sensually back to the original 1973 theatrical experience, much more than previous views of the 2004 DVD print of Jesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition) (1973).  I replayed a few segments of that DVD in comparison with this newly remastered Blu-Ray, as well.I'm dumbfounded to have seen several negative reviews on this same page by customers who felt the sound track was not only substandard but even, in their words, atrocious or bad.  It's not.  I heard and saw detail, richness, and balance that were well suited to a remastered 1973 release.  Colors were somewhat muted at times, but still popped.  The Blu-Ray lifted a visual fog that I hadn't even realized was present in the DVD.  And the audio rendition delivered a remarkably pleasing tonality, balance, and dynamic range, in my experience.  I heard layers that I was not previously aware with the DVD.My experience was echoed by the review at Blu-ray dot com which gave the film 3.5 /5 (video) and 4.0 / 5 (audio).This is not a 5.1 remix, though.  It's a faithful and pleasing presentation of the original 4 track stereo (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0).Now, for the rest:  the casting, the score, performances and orchestration still blow me away, after all these years.... as does the clever theatrical presentation against the beautiful desert backdrop.

The problem is that  it's one ballad too many. We also get to see Elliman's waifish beauty to go  along with her heartfelt voice--it reinforces this work's attempt to  portray the Magdalen as a sympathetic character rather than the  &quot;fallen woman&quot; history has always insisted on making her. After  all, this is also the woman who may have had a crush on Our Lord. Barry  Dennen matches the Pilate he did before, giving the character a sense of  the stressed-out functionary caught in the middle. Otherwise, I was a bit  underwhelmed. Ted Neely as Jesus might have better stage abilities than  Deep Purple's Ian Gillan from the original cast (who knows?), but he's not  a very good singer. This is made obvious by the way he speaks some lines  rather than singing them. &quot;Herod's Song&quot; has always been a song I  have problems with--Josh Mostel's goofy Dixieland performance only makes it  worse. And the guy who plays Caiphas can't sing either--he's not the solid  basso Victor Brox was. But this is an OK substitute for the original, which  after all never appeared in visual form.

Powers ""show maniac""","[5, 20]","When Norman Jewison was to direct the movie of the rock opera he decided to film in naturalistic settings at the location where the story took place.  So far,so good. But under the oppressive,scorching sun and arid desert heat it becomes apparent that Mr Jewison lost his mind.A troupe of hippies traveling in a dilapatated bus pull up in the middle of the desert,disembark and start to dress in their costumes to begin the re-telling of the story of the last seven days in the life of Jesus Christ.For the first twenty minutes or so the concept of a minimalist staging is going along well and then Mr Jewison slowly began channeling Federico Fellini and Ken Russell and even added a couple of oddball touches himself.Mr Jewison himself:  A platoon of Roman soldiers(all six of them) dressed in lavender tank tops and skin tight jeans are obviously meant to be on sentry patrol.  But in the open desert what are they guarding? Sand?Federico Fellini:  ""King Herods Song"" has got to be the gayest, ""you go girl snap"" scene ever filmed in the life of Christ. When Herod tires of toying with him and has a hissy fit because Jesus won't ""walk across his swimming pool"" he shoos Christ away by throwing bagels at him. Herods' court looks like a drag show and to punch across the gay element Herod wears Elton John sunglasses.Another Felliniesque touch is the title song itself. Judas lowered from a helicopter cable dressed in a sequined and fringed outfit that would have made Liberace jealous.  The actual performance of the number by Carl Anderson etal is quite entertaining even though it seems like a Las Vegas show number on steroids.The Ken Russell Effect:  When Jesus chases the moneylenders out of the temple he knocks over a stand of ""Greetings from Jerusalem -Wish You Were Here"" postcards, blushes and slightly turns his head as he banishes the hookers dressed in almost nothing, then he knocks over a table of slot machines,cash registers,assault rifles and assorted other bric a brac not usually associated with Jerusalem circa 33A.D.When Judas has second thoughts about his betrayal of Christ for 30 pieces of silver he is chased across the desert by Israeli Army tanks and buzzed by jets from the Israeli Air Force.It may not appear that I like this movie but I really do despite some of its silliness and the music was and is still pretty terrific.Carl Anderson makes a powerful Judas and Yvonne Elliman sings her original role of Mary Magdalene and the beautiful ""I Don""t Know How To Love Him"" belongs to her and her alone.Now what can one say about Ted Neeley that hasn't terrified children and adults alike all over the world.  He looks to be the perfect Jesus, the straight long hair, the light beard, his eyes, but he ruins it every time he opens his mouth. He acts like a petulant and somewhat self-centered brat and if he's not having a temper tantrum he's glum.  Well ok  i guess anyone would be glum if they knew they were going to die in a couple of days but then again God/Jesus knows the future and his death will just amount to a three day nap. Mr Neeley is actually not a bad singer but he relies too much on the premise,""why sing when you can screech"".  I can't take credit for this but Ted Neeley has been permanently named ""The Screaming Jesus"" The movie ends with the crucifixion and then the hippies reboard the bus to leave. However the hippie who played Jesus is MIA. Was he left hanging on the cross?The bottom line,despite my discussing some of the bizarre choices and extravagances used to portray the last seven days in the Life of Christ this is still a pretty wonderful film and the music even after all these years is still amazing.",4,JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,3671,"['When', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'was', 'direct', 'movie', 'rock', 'opera', 'decided', 'film', 'naturalistic', 'settings', 'location', 'where', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'oppressive', 'scorching', 'sun', 'arid', 'desert', 'heat', 'apparent', 'Mr', 'Jewison', 'lost', 'mind.A', 'troupe', 'hippies', 'traveling', 'dilapatated', 'bus', 'pull', 'up', 'middle', 'desert', 'disembark', 'start', 'dress', 'costumes', 'begin', 're-telling', 'story', 'last', 'seven', 'days', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ.For', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'concept', 'minimalist', 'staging', 'going', 'along', 'well', 'then', 'Mr', 'Jewison', 'slowly', 'began', 'channeling', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'even', 'added', 'couple', 'oddball', 'touches', 'himself.Mr', 'Jewison', 'platoon', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'six', 'dressed', 'lavender', 'tank', 'tops', 'skin', 'tight', 'jeans', 'are', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'sentry', 'patrol', 'open', 'desert', 'what', 'are', 'guarding', 'Sand', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'King', 'Herods', 'Song', 'got', 'be', 'gayest', 'go', 'girl', 'snap', 'scene', 'ever', 'filmed', 'life', 'Christ', 'When', 'Herod', 'tires', 'toying', 'hissy', 'fit', 'Jesus', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'swimming', 'pool', 'shoos', 'Christ', 'away', 'throwing', 'bagels', 'Herods', 'court', 'drag', 'show', 'punch', 'gay', 'element', 'Herod', 'Elton', 'John', 'sunglasses.Another', 'Felliniesque', 'touch', 'title', 'song', 'Judas', 'lowered', 'helicopter', 'cable', 'dressed', 'sequined', 'fringed', 'outfit', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Liberace', 'jealous', 'actual', 'performance', 'number', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'etal', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'even', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'show', 'number', 'steroids.The', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'Effect', 'When', 'Jesus', 'moneylenders', 'temple', 'stand', 'Greetings', 'Jerusalem', '-Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'postcards', 'blushes', 'slightly', 'head', 'hookers', 'dressed', 'almost', 'nothing', 'then', 'over', 'table', 'slot', 'machines', 'cash', 'registers', 'assault', 'rifles', 'assorted', 'other', 'brac', 'not', 'usually', 'associated', 'Jerusalem', 'circa', '33A.D.When', 'Judas', 'second', 'thoughts', 'betrayal', 'Christ', '30', 'pieces', 'silver', 'chased', 'desert', 'Israeli', 'Army', 'tanks', 'buzzed', 'jets', 'Israeli', 'Air', 'Force.It', 'may', 'not', 'appear', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'silliness', 'music', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'terrific.Carl', 'Anderson', 'powerful', 'Judas', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'original', 'role', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'beautiful', 'Don', 't', 'Know', 'How', 'Love', 'Him', 'belongs', 'alone.Now', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Ted', 'Neeley', ""n't"", 'terrified', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'world', 'be', 'perfect', 'Jesus', 'straight', 'long', 'hair', 'light', 'beard', 'eyes', 'time', 'mouth', 'petulant', 'somewhat', 'self-centered', 'brat', 'not', 'having', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'glum', 'Well', 'i', 'guess', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'glum', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'couple', 'days', 'then', 'again', 'God/Jesus', 'future', 'death', 'will', 'just', 'amount', 'three', 'day', 'nap', 'Mr', 'Neeley', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'singer', 'too', 'much', 'premise', 'why', 'sing', 'when', 'can', 'screech', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'credit', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'been', 'permanently', 'named', 'Screaming', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'crucifixion', 'then', 'hippies', 'reboard', 'bus', 'leave', 'However', 'hippie', 'who', 'played', 'Jesus', 'MIA', 'Was', 'left', 'hanging', 'cross', 'bottom', 'line', 'discussing', 'bizarre', 'choices', 'extravagances', 'used', 'portray', 'last', 'seven', 'days', 'Life', 'Christ', 'still', 'pretty', 'wonderful', 'film', 'music', 'even', 'years', 'still', 'amazing']",N/A

The music! What we have here is the premise of a group of people, for whatever reason, traveling via bus into a rocky desert to perform their version of Jesus Christ Superstar.  There is no narration, no introduction as to why these people are here other than they show up, unload the bus of props and costumes, and get on with the play.The pluses of this movie, is for one thing, lack of competition from other video sources to view the reenactment of the hit broadway musical in full theatrical, and yet visual form of holy land that Jesus once roamed. Yvonne Elliman, who had her most stirring moments in the original production, is also presented here in glistening form singing, ""I don't know how to love him."" Carl Anderson also gives a great performance as Judas, and of course actor Ted Neeley is here to introduce his role he has been sandled with for the rest of his life in touring many of these shows. His frame is small, but his presence is powerful, and he gives an honest performance to boot.The desert locations are grand, and the movie does not expect you to believe this is a period piece with the uses of army tanks and flying jets abound in the dust frames.All I can say is, if you like the original broadway audio album, the movie is quite suitable.  My only minor complaint is the chorus of the song, ""Suuerstar.""

This can be attributed, I think, to the excellent choreography, singing, staging and concept.Strip the foregoing away and you find a fairly typical, albeit searching, retelling of the last week or so of Christ's ministry and death.  No, it isn't a line by line retelling of the New Testament scripture--not even close--but it definitely follows the spirit of the Gospels.  Judas, for instance, isn't seen as involved in a conspiracy, along with Jesus, to fulfill Jesus' mission on Earth.  Jewison shows Judas as an emotionally tortured man, who tries to understand Jesus but, when Jesus doesn't live up to expectations, betrays him.  Jesus understands Judas' betrayal and knows it must be, but still it IS a betrayal.Jesus--unlike the Gospels--is shown as a 'Messiah' sometimes uncertain of himself.  He questions God's motive in putting him to death but finally accepts his role as the ultimate martyr.  On the other hand, he frequently tells his followers via operatic son that they don't 'care about him' and will forget him 'ten minutes after I'm gone.'  There are many excellent scenes but the last scene, in which the actors are departing in their bus, is perhaps the most memorable.  Carl Anderson, who has played Judas, is the last to enter.  He casts a last, lingering look back on the hill on which Christ's cross is silhouetted by the setting sun.  What in the World happened?By the way, I read Tom Keogh's lead-in Amazon Review.  Apparently Keogh was put off by Neeley as a 'wimpy-looking Jesus.'  I wasn't.

It showed a side of Jesus that is true to  the Biblical record, but is rarely portrayed in movies and that is the  *WRATH* of Jesus. Sometimes, he got angry.The prophet said &quot;he  loved righteousness and hated iniquity (inequity).&quot;Jesus Christ,  Superstar really highlighted many aspects of the humanity of Jesus.And  the bit with the bus took me awhile to figure out - but my theory is - the  people who were involved in the crucifixion of Jesus were bit players. They  were actors in a drama far bigger than they understood or grasped. I  suspect that is what Tim Rice was communicating. (As to the many  anachronisms, I'm still not sure what they mean)Remember, Jesus said  &quot;Look at your blank faces, I'll be forgotten - 10 minutes after I'm  dead&quot; and his followers refuted him, but in fact, after the  crucifixion, they all went back to fishing for a time. Or, in this case,  they got back on the bus and went home.I love the story of Jesus and I  think this movie told it well. It presents a sympathetic view of Judas  Iscariot, Pilate and Herod, yet that too, has a degree of legitimacy, based  in the four gospels.This is a movie you'll want to see more than once.

52303,A18C1PCR8WUAST,078322544X,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[25, 26]","I saw this film the week it came out and though I've never been a Christian, it had a powerful affect on me given its depth of humanity, the stark beauty of the physical landscape (shot in the desert outside Israel; so harsh were shooting conditoins that heat exhaustion and unclean water kept Yvonne E., and others quite ill with dysentery). The unforgiving intensity of the landscaps made the intensity of the emotional landscape so much greater, as do the solid performances and simple direction. Jewison seems to stay out of the way, allowing his actors and dancers to work without having to compete with the sort of flashy camera-work we were just then beginning to see. They are all nearly swallowed up by the enormity of the space and light of the desert, and this somehow makes us feel that what anyone doing what Jesus was trying to do--speak simple truths in the face of the religious and political climate of the time--all the more against-the-odds impossible. Between the Roman occupation and the near impossibility of survival in the harsh climate, ordinary humans seem smaller even than we really are, and the idea of a ""personal God"" (rather than the rule-laden Hebrew traditional God)  and the idea of living in a state of genuine, unselfish love, rather than surviving at all costs and fearing a distant and paternal God, to be impossible notions given this context. Jewison successfully makes this ""strange land"" an actual character in the story, adding a dimension that Rice and Webber never captured on their album. In fact, I believe it was this choice that made the film a success--we are mesmerized by the concept of attempting to bring about any sort of change in such a place, at such a time.While many have complaints about this entire project, from initial recording to the making of this film, to even now, picketers at performances of it, I have to say that of all the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber projects, only this one seems to have come from any real passion (excuse the pun), rather than from calculation. Compared to the later emptiness of ""Cats"" it is quite rich. The greatest bit of genius comes from having made the primary emotional relationship between the spiritual purist Jesus and his politically savvy right-hand man, Judas, rather than the traditional focus on trying to define the exact nature of the love that existed between Jesus and Mary (as though such a thing is possible in any context). This unusual angle on the story brings out an entirely different set of human truths than the more common approach. How does a man, Judas, who is more literal minded, seeing the mission as one of political change by an occupied people, deal with the pragmatic problems caused when he is partnered with a spiritually focused man--one who is being driven by love and not practicalities, not mindful of the price he and his followers may pay for spreading his message (or rather, willing to pay that price and therefore ignoring the coming crisis)? The best writing is therefore given to Judas, both lyrically and musically, and Carl Anderson is extremely compelling in the role, even during the final number (""Jesus Christ, Superstar"") which now seems so dated (white lace leather fringed jumpsuits and white Afro wigs); his grounded performance makes them unimportant. From the first moment as the rest of the cast get off the bus which has brought them to the location and dance, get into costume, interact, etc., Judas is already walking off alone--a man whose path has already separated him from the rest of the group's. Anderson is also the final one back on the bus; both he and Yvonne pause and look around them in exhausted awe at the bleak desert, and the viewer feels Anderson has himself changed as a result of playing this difficult and complicated role. We don't see Neely again, reinforcing the physical absence of Jesus. The bus acts as bookends for the film, and while probably the actual mode of transportation for the cast to and from the desert, it reminds one, too, of the refurbished school buses of the 60's/early 70's as alternative homes and communal travel vehicles.The use of modern things combined with ancient perpetuates the truth that these problems are on-going and inextricably connected to human existence regardless of time and place. Particularly the guns, tanks, planes which serve  to represent Judas` conscience (in two brief scenes in the desert that bookend Judas' betraying visit to Caiaphas and the rest of the Sanhedrin on their fabulous scaffolding set) and then to represent what will soon become a state of continual warfare, springing from the use by others of Jesus' ideals, are effective, and right now, all the more relevant, especially in the context of the Middle East and its endless ""holy"" wars (an oxymoron if ever there was one).Two new songs were written for the film, making the story-telling more coherent. The first, the conversation between Annas and Caiaphas about ""What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?"" which shows the political and self-serving decision the Sanhedrin (the Jewish ruling body) felt themselves forced to come to in order to manage the political uprising that Jesus' teachings seemed, from their point of view, to be in danger of causing, was an excellent decision that filled a hole in the original score, and explained the fears these powerful men were experiencing. The second, a rather annoying plea from Mary and Peter,""Could we start again, please,"" is less interesting, both musically and from the story-telling point of view, but it does pose the question that most never stop to think about--""what happens to us now that you're gone and we have given up our old lives?"" The confusion of Jesus' followers must have been terrible, and pondering it helps to explain how the fanatical Paul (formerly Saul) who had never even met Jesus, was able to step in and assume the leadership position that resulted, 30 years later, in the writings of the first four books of the Aramaic books by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as they tried to remember what they had experienced, as well as the rest of Aramaic books. Many people are unaware that the writings the various branches of Christianity would be founded on originated with the ideas of Paul, rather than Jesus, as he was the only one of the two who wrote anything down, and that he made all the rules that came later, after Jesus' death. (It is not my intention to get into a theological discussion here or criticise anyone--merely to point out how the song, ""Could we start again, please?"" articulates the dilemma that led to Paul's place in history.)There are also additional verses in Pilate's trial scene which point out that Pilate has no crime on which to pin any charges, let alone an execution, on the innocent Jesus, as well as a heart-stopping extra verse in ""Hosanna,"" wherein the crowd asks the suddenly alarmed Jesus, ""Would you die for me?"" (a freeze-frame is used to good effect as time stops for a moment as the question seems to hit the smiling Jesus like a slap in the face), and these additions help to tell the story. And unlike the more than a hundred changes director Alan Parker requested of Rice and Webber in order to make ""Evita"" less dangerous and more Madonna- and audience-friendly (and which resulted in a disaster the great Patti LuPone, Broadway's original Evita, never even went to see), these couple of changes helped to tell the complex story more fully, rather than diluting it, or making it less controversial (which it was at the time).The exuberant dancing, while specific to the period, is still great fun to watch, and the lovely molasses-and-velvet voice of Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene is matched by her earthy and understated portrayal of a woman trying to understand the nature of her feelings for a man so far outside of her own experience. It's nice to have the character, rather than the writers, wrestle with the problem--it's another example of how the Tim Rice and Norman Jewison let the actors do the work, rather than doing it for them. Most other story-telling about the ""passion of Jesus"" fixate on Mary and try to answer questions for us, rather than just letting her be in the story, dealing as all of us have to when our worlds are turned upside down and we find ourselves on a ride we don't fully understand but need to be on. I found that to be a refreshing change, and as pivotal to why this story works as the Jesus-Judas relationship. While Ted Neely may not be the greatest actor around, he does a good job of humanizing Jesus--which as I understood from the interviews at the time, was the goal of the entire project in the first place. He is especially good in the intense ""Garden of Gethsemane"" scene, where he grapples, questions, then accepts the by-now inevitable fate he is facing, and any time he and Anderson have serious work to do together.There are other nice, subtle details, too, such as the silent but very present wife of Pilate, who advises him via shakes of the head and exchanged looks--keep an eye on her as she tries to keep her husband from falling off the tightrope he's found himself on.  Dennen keeps his performance simple yet quietly tormented, and we are filled with sympathy for a man who has been swept up in events he neither understands nor can control, which is a nice change from the usual simplistic demonizing of Pilate. Herod, the most powerful Jewish king, and who was notorious for the very Romanic decadence of his court, is parodied with great humor by a loony Josh Mostel (a nice break from the growing atmosphere of doom).  Again, none of the characters are presented in the way we expect, and this may be the biggest reason ""Jesus Christ, Superstar"" works.",5,"A moving, deeply human story (in song and

Well, good grief, what was this Keogh chap expecting -- Arnold Schwarzenegger?  The Incredible Hulk?  Ted Neeley pulls off an amazing feat:  he is at times beautiful, at times stern and intimidating, and at times a poignant and troubled Jesus.  We do believe in him.  He was a carpenter by trade, not a heavyweight boxer.  I think he is well cast.  In fact, Neeley has been reprising this role in theaters even into the present.  I have seen him do a backstage interview and tour, and he is clearly a very good and generous-hearted man, but that's the icing on the cake.)The music will stay with you:  I first knew the music through the album, which my mother owned when I was child.

52308,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,078322544X,V. Berk,"[4, 4]","Jesus Christ Superstar is perhaps the boldest of all musicals made during the last seventy years, even though the story it tells is one that has been told, retold, and read for centuries.  The way this show presents its subject material, and context has gotten it banned in a heavily Christian nation in Africa, and scolded by many Christian churches, but this musical has proven appealing to both people of faith, and those without.  This musical was ahead of its time, starting an era of adaptation for Christianity, which wasn't moving into the new world very well, considering science was beginning to take a stronger grip over cultural knowledge and concepts.  I consider this one of the first big steps into making Christianity more believable, and up to the standards of modern society.Like any great musical the opening is an overture giving us samples of all the music to come.  During the overture we see the cast arrive via bus, after being presented with a long landscape shot that shows us the remains of the Roman civilization.  Without a single word being exchanged we are presented with our cast, led by skilled singers Ted Neeley, and Carl Anderson.  These first shots in the overture are important; in it the actors already give you an idea of how it is that they're portraying their respective roles.The actual musical starts with the song Heaven on Their Minds which is sung by the disciple Judas Iscariot, who of course would later betray Jesus.  There initially was controversy over Anderson, a black man, being cast in this role, because many regarded Judas as the greatest villain in history, and that this was a racist move by the producers.  In this first song all thoughts of racism quickly evaporate, as Anderson's powerful singing ability blows the audience away.You quickly learn that Judas is not the villain of this story; in fact he's portrayed as a good, very confused man; someone who doesn't quite know how to cope with his feelings in regards to Jesus.  This humanization outraged many in the Christian church, several objecting that Judas was a villain and should've been portrayed as the sniveling, plotting individual in the corner who'd sell you out for pieces of silver.  This is one of the main reasons Jesus Christ Superstar is a giant step forward in today's Christian society, because it recognizes that people have weaknesses, and that anyone can act rashly out of confusion, or haste.The first song performed by Anderson is one of love, and respect for Jesus, but also one of great confusion, because he's shown as not knowing what it is that Jesus wishes to accomplish; he thinks Jesus is becoming self-centered, caring more for him rather than the poor and needy.  This entire song is performed by Anderson on the mountains overlooking Christ and his followers, creating one of the best landscape shots in the entire movie, but it also catches the purpose of this song.  Judas is far from Jesus and pleading for him to listen to his warnings, but of course he can't be heard from that distance.  Perhaps he's too frightened to actually express himself, and confront Christ, or maybe he really is ignored by Jesus.  By the end of this song you can easily feel sorry for Anderson's character.  After his suicide nothing could've have been more controversial than Judas coming back as an angel.The same thing that outraged the church about this shows Judas was same for Jesus, who's portrayed more as a vehicle for spreading the word of God more so than a divine being.  This Jesus shows human weakness, passion, and even rage, which made him more human than most other incarnations.  Jesus would rather not die, and is even tired of his task of spreading the word, losing his inspiration over the last three years, which is why Judas in this story feels that he's slipping in the first place.  Jesus, is as he put it in one song, ""sad and tired.""Ted Neeley sings the part right, and his eyes provide the best aspect of his portrayal of Christ.  In his eyes there lies a great deal of complexity that shows someone who's incredibly troubled from a mental stand-point.  He's been slowly beat down over the past three years and his exhaustion isn't present in his mannerisms, or actions, but it's all there in those eyes.  He speaks like someone who's obviously a step above your average civilian, and he sounds like a happy person who's simply doing what he feels must be done but those eyes of his...These eyes show someone well over thirty; someone who's tired and teetering on the edge of self-destruction.Another noteworthy performance is Barry Dennen as Pontius Pilate, who is portrayed very sympathetically.  He is shown as someone who really doesn't want to kill Jesus, because he really has no incentive for committing such an act, but he has peers and the population pressuring him into it from all angles.  The performance given by Dennen, though not as grand as Anderson or Neeley, is worth noting in this film, for he performs the songs with full emotion, while acting each scene to its fullest, but never quite going overboard.With music by the infamous Andrew Lloyd Webber (The Phantom of the Opera) and lyrics by Tim Rice (based on the book by Rice) this musical was helmed by Director Norman Jewison.  Having just finished the future classic, Fiddler on the Roof, Jewison was ready to tackle this obscure rock opera, and was willing to push it to the max.  So what did Jewison do to try and provide something new, new, and extraordinary?  He packed up the entire cast and took them overseas to shoot the entire film on location; as accurately as possible.  The entire movie is shot on the ruins of the Roman Empire, where this story is thought to have unfolded two thousand years ago.  It is hard to believe these ruins once housed one of the largest empires in human history.The desert in this film does not look dry, and forbidding, it actually appears very surreal and not at all some place you wouldn't want to be.  You may wonder why I point this out, but if you pay attention to some other movies you'll see that lots of them do not shot deserts in a really fashionable style, often making them look dry, and depressing, or just plain boring; which deserts probably are in real life.  Jewison takes the desert and utilizes effective camera angles to capture the beauty of this landscape, and they way he transitions from music number to music number are very effective.  No transition here seemed to have been forced onto the viewer, and all of it seems to fit together like some sort of film puzzle, but for the most part it works well.Jewison's style reminds me of Stanley Kubrick, to a certain degree (mind you no one can compare to Kubrick).  It's a very dry filmmaking, not really showing much bias towards any of the characters, for they all get treated with mostly the same camera angles.  You get to judge these characters entirely by their actions, and not by the way they are filmed, and that's how any story should be presented, and that is not letting any character get away without having to prove themselves to the audience; even if they are Jesus.  In this film you don't have any dramatic shots of Jesus, or Judas that distinguish themselves over the other characters.  Jewison's style is beautiful, but he doesn't let the filming control the musical, letting the actors, and the music tell the story more than his film.This movie isn't at all Christian propaganda (the churches that have scorned the musical can prove that) and is something that everyone should try to be exposed to at some point or another.  If you don't believe in the Christian faith you shouldn't avoid this musical, because none of it is propaganda, in fact it's one of the most believable adaptations of Jesus I've ever seen.  Come to this musical with an open mind, and remember that it's just a story; forget its inspiration came from a religious text, because as a musical it really isn't something to miss.  If you are of faith this musical can bring up some questions for you about it, but you shouldn't dwell on them.  If you think what the Bible says is what happened one-hundred percent, no questions asked, I can tell you now that odds are you will not like Jesus Christ Superstar.Now sit back and let yourself get swept away by one of the most groundbreaking musicals of all time.",5,Rock Opera Provides Believable Portrayal of Judas and Christ,1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,8348,"['Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar',

The great acting and singing by Ted Neeley, in the title role of Jesus, is powerful, dramatic and memorable.
