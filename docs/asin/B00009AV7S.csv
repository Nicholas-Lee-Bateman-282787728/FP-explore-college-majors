I have to say that I like these movies better than most episodes, because of the longer and more involved storylines.In this one, Timmy has gone a year without losing his fairies and is rewarded with a cupcake that grants its holder one rule-free wish. Apparently a kid keeping their fairy for that long is a rare occurence because kids lose their fairies when others find out about them.Timmy can't decide on his wish at the moment, so he decides to hold onto the cupcake - and so the cupcake ends up in the hands of several other people, causing several different worlds based on the wishmaker's wish (a monkey bites the cupcake and the world becomes something ala Planet of the Apes) and the cupcake even ends up in Crocker's hands..Overall this is a good movie for anyone who likes FOP",4,Entertaining FOP movie,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,861,"['Channel', 'Chasers', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'Fairly', 'Oddparents', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'movies', 'better', 'most', 'episodes', 'longer', 'more', 'involved', 'storylines.In', 'one', 'Timmy', 'gone', 'year', 'losing', 'fairies', 'rewarded', 'cupcake', 'holder', 'one', 'rule-free', 'wish', 'Apparently', 'kid', 'keeping', 'fairy', 'long', 'rare', 'occurence', 'kids', 'lose', 'fairies', 'when', 'others', 'find', 'out', 'them.Timmy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'wish', 'moment', 'hold', 'cupcake', 'so', 'cupcake', 'up', 'hands', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'causing', 'several', 'different', 'worlds', 'based', 'wishmaker', 'wish', 'monkey', 'cupcake', 'world', 'something', 'ala', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'cupcake', 'even', 'up', 'Crocker', 'hands..Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'FOP']",The Fairly Odd Parents - Abra-Catastrophe The Movie
753369,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00009AV7S,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[1, 2]","For Nickelodeon, they've really seemed to hit it big with some of their Nicktoons recently. There is no doubt about it. Especially with their recent cartoons, Jimmy Neutron and Chalk Zone. Still, nothing to mind seems to out-wish that theory better than The Fairly Odd Parents. The cartoon is sort of like the Cinderella story evolving around Timmy Turner, who gets some cool fairy godparents to cheer his life up. The godparents are also a little strange and straight. One of them, Cosmo, is like Timmy, with a short attention span, and the other Wanda, is the one that tries to keep Cosmo straight. Still, the wackiness can only end, if Timmy, tells his secret of having godparents around, and sending them back to Fairy World.In the 2003 film, Abra-Catastrophe, which recently premiered on Nickelodeon, celebrates the first ever fairyversary that Timmy celebrates with his godparents. For his celebration almost every fairy gives him something very magical, from silly nose glasses, to a magical bag, and even Easter Eggs. But, that isn't it, Timmy also recieves the responsibility of a rule-free muffin, granting him one wish that can bend the rules. Unfortunately, Timmy loses his muffin, and tries to get it back, and tries not to get it in the hands of his fairy-demented teacher, Denzel Crocker. Sadly, things take a turn for the worse, twice.The first time, when it falls in the hands of a monkey named Bippy, who turns the world into the one big global jungle, where apes rule the world. But, when the muffin gets in the hands of Timmy's mentally-estranged teacher, all war breaks out, as he captures Wanda, and it is up to Timmy and Cosmo to rescue her from his forceful danger. It is just an unbelieveable feeling, but shocking when Denzel captures Timmy's parents, Timmy blabs his unknown secret, that he has fairy godparents, to save all four of them, fairy godparents and Timmy's parents from Denzel's dangerous sight. However, once Timmy eats the muffin he gets back from Mr. Crocker, he gets his godparents back, and erases all memory from others that he has fairy godparents. Still, he almost loses them in the end, when the head fairy, tries to take them away, but Cosmo and Wanda try to get re-assigned back to Timmy. Thankfully, they became Timmy's fairy godparents.I have to admit, Butch Hartman, who created The Fairly Odd Parents did a fantastic job creating this series from day one, back in 2001. Still, Butch has that in his bloodline away, as the brother of the late Phil Hartman from Saturday Night Live fame. I really love the series, and I loved the movie. He really should keep the magic moving, and create more fairy mayhem. It truly is the best animated series around right now.",5,It Is About Wishfully Time,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,2712,"['Nickelodeon', ""'ve"", 'really', 'seemed', 'hit', 'big', 'Nicktoons', 'recently', 'doubt', 'Especially', 'recent', 'cartoons', 'Jimmy', 'Neutron', 'Chalk', 'Zone', 'Still', 'nothing', 'mind', 'out-wish', 'theory', 'better', 'Fairly', 'Odd', 'Parents', 'cartoon', 'sort', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'evolving', 'Timmy', 'Turner', 'who', 'cool', 'fairy', 'godparents', 'cheer', 'life', 'up', 'godparents', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'strange', 'straight', 'One', 'Cosmo', 'Timmy', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'other', 'Wanda', 'one', 'keep', 'Cosmo', 'straight', 'Still', 'wackiness', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'Timmy', 'secret', 'having', 'godparents', 'sending', 'back', 'Fairy', 'World.In', '2003', 'film', 'Abra-Catastrophe', 'recently', 'premiered', 'Nickelodeon', 'first', 'ever', 'fairyversary', 'Timmy', 'godparents', 'celebration', 'almost', 'fairy', 'something', 'very', 'magical', 'silly', 'nose', 'glasses', 'magical', 'bag', 'even', 'Easter', 'Eggs', ""n't"", 'Timmy', 'also', 'responsibility', 'rule-free', 'muffin', 'granting', 'one', 'wish', 'can', 'bend', 'rules', 'Unfortunately', 'Timmy', 'muffin', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'not', 'get', 'hands', 'fairy-demented', 'teacher', 'Denzel', 'Crocker', 'Sadly', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'hands', 'monkey', 'named', 'Bippy', 'who', 'world', 'one', 'big', 'global', 'jungle', 'where', 'apes', 'rule', 'world', 'when', 'muffin', 'hands', 'Timmy', 'mentally-estranged', 'teacher', 'war', 'breaks', 'out', 'Wanda', 'Timmy', 'Cosmo', 'rescue', 'forceful', 'danger', 'just', 'unbelieveable', 'feeling', 'shocking', 'when', 'Denzel', 'Timmy', 'parents', 'Timmy', 'blabs', 'unknown', 'secret', 'fairy', 'godparents', 'save', 'four', 'fairy', 'godparents', 'Timmy', 'parents', 'Denzel', 'dangerous', 'sight', 'However', 'once', 'Timmy', 'muffin', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Crocker', 'godparents', 'back', 'memory', 'others', 'fairy', 'godparents', 'Still', 'almost', 'end', 'when', 'head', 'fairy', 'take', 'away', 'Cosmo', 'Wanda', 'try', 'get', 're-assigned', 'back', 'Timmy', 'Thankfully', 'became', 'Timmy', 'fairy', 'godparents.I', 'have', 'admit', 'Butch', 'Hartman', 'who', 'created', 'Fairly', 'Odd', 'Parents', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'creating', 'series', 'day', 'one', 'back', '2001', 'Still', 'Butch', 'that', 'bloodline', 'away', 'brother', 'late', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'fame', 'really', 'love', 'series', 'loved', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'keep', 'magic', 'moving', 'create', 'more', 'fairy', 'mayhem', 'truly', 'best', 'animated', 'series', 'right', 'now']",The Fairly Odd Parents - Abra-Catastrophe The Movie
753370,A2QW2V285U824L,B00009AV7S,"Steven Bailey ""Cinemaven""","[1, 3]","How does a grown man review something called ""The Fairly OddParents: Abra-Catastrophe"" without looking like a complete fool? I'll start by saying it's a feature-length spin-off of one of the funniest TV cartoons I've seen in years.For those not in the know, ""The Fairly OddParents"" is cable channel Nickelodeon's latest hit cartoon series, and deservedly so. It concerns 10-year-old Timmy Turner, whose only means of facing a kid-unfriendly world are Cosmo and Wanda, two fairy godparents willed upon him to grant him his every wish. Cosmo and Wanda can serve Tommy only as long as he never reveals his secret to anyone else.This sounds a lot more precious than it plays. Butch Hartman, a former Cartoon Network writer who created and oversees the series, is definitely the right man for this cartoon. It has the kind of in-jokes, pop-culture references, and outrageous-looking settings and characters one used to associate with ""Rocky and Bullwinkle.""As for ""Abra-Castastrophe,"" like most recent cartoon spin-offs, it provides more of the same, though if you're a fan of the show, that's hardly a bad thing. Basically, the movie has Timmy  do battle with each of the grown-ups who cause him grief in the series: Vickie, a babysitter with the sensibility of Eddie Haskell; Jorgen von Strangle, the fairy overseer who has a definite Schwarzenegger complex; and most of all, Timmy's science teacher, Mr. Crocker, whose obsession with proving the existence of fairy godparents sends his into spasms whenever he simply mentions them.Why a movie? Because any cartoon that smells of demographic appeal these days is instantly spun off into a movie. (How opportunistic is ""Abra-Catastrophe""? Nickelodeon ""premiered"" it on their network three days before its release on DVD.) But at least this one, unlike ""Rugrats Go Wild"" and ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie,"" doesn't completely reek of cynicism, keeping the wacko tone of the TV show intact. It lags a bit in its climactic ""battle"" scene but picks up cheerily towards the end.If you're an ""OddParents"" fan, you've probably seen the movie already and are waiting in line to buy the DVD as we speak. (I know I'm there!) Non-converts might want to watch a couple of episodes of the TV show first, to understand the ""back story.""
