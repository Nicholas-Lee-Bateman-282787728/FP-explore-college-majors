It gives clear insight to what the war photo journalists had to do to get their photos & stories to the masses. Interesting stories from both U.S. and Vietnamese war photo journalists. Also, their is a bonus feature of a Vietnamese girl who escaped Vietnam, was raised in the United States, and goes back to see the native country in which she was born. She goes to Hanoi, Central Highlands, and Saigon to talk to some Vietnamese people about what happened during the Vietnam War and how it has affected their lives. Very moving at times. Yes, their are still photos, but they serve to show us the horror of war. Tim Paiges' story is amazing in itself, that he lived to tell what happened to him and how the experience has changed him. Well worth seeing in my opinion.",4,Very good...!,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,812,"['bought', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'clear', 'insight', 'what', 'war', 'photo', 'journalists', 'had', 'do', 'get', 'photos', 'stories', 'masses', 'Interesting', 'stories', 'U.S.', 'Vietnamese', 'war', 'photo', 'journalists', 'Also', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'who', 'escaped', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'raised', 'United', 'States', 'back', 'see', 'native', 'country', 'was', 'born', 'Hanoi', 'Central', 'Highlands', 'Saigon', 'talk', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'what', 'happened', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'how', 'affected', 'lives', 'Very', 'moving', 'times', 'Yes', 'are', 'still', 'photos', 'serve', 'show', 'horror', 'war', 'Tim', 'Paiges', 'story', 'amazing', 'lived', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'experience', 'changed', 'Well', 'seeing', 'opinion']",National Geographic - Vietnam's Unseen War - Pictures from the Other Side

This great power uses napalm to destroy the crops of the peasants of the country and conducts massacres against the peasants in the South that it pretended to be protecting. Many years later it was impossible for the country of peasants to grow crops to feed themselves because of the residual effects of the napalm  which poisoned the soil.This film shows how the Vietnamese peasants lived in caves during the war.I was lucky to escape this horrible war by joining the Peace Corps, Many of the soldiers from the great power who returned home lived in cardboard boxes in the alleys of cities, had nightmares for years after the war ended and became drug addicts.",5,Vietnam's Unseen War Shows The People We Never Saw Alive In Films of the War.
