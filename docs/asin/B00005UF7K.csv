I figured anything with Kirk Cameron in it ought to be worthwhile.  I had no idea that what makes this movie is the inspiring story of a little british boy who has a brain tumor and the never waivering faith of his mother who sets out with help from many (and the shining light of God's presence) to give her son the will to fight and to live and know that he will be cured!  Based on a true story, the film is replete with an unforgettable musical score, top notch direction and marvelous performances by the entire cast!  It is not over-sentimentally sappy and never preachy.  It is a honest depiction of God's incredbile working power!  The one negative review in this forum is obviously from one cynical viewer who has missed the point of the entire film.  Believe the four and five star reviews on this one folks.

684014,A86OI3JXIV1LN,B00005UF7K,Josh,"[12, 45]","When I was on vacation, me and my sister turned over to PAX TV to see what was on, and it was none other than 'Miracle of the Cards.'  I saw Kirk Cameron, so I had to stick around to see what it was about. . .  I'm sorry I ever did.  Not only is the story completely bland and uninteresting, but the acting is, by far, some of the worst I have seen in recent memory.  All the performances are blocky, uninspired, and insipidly tireless.  We get one yelling session after another from the boy's mother, and his father just stands by and says &quot;Yes dear. . .&quot;  Then we get to the doctor, who is nothing more than a hapless dope who doesn't know what the heck he's doing.  The boy, too, is a hopeless case as a little actor as he tries to act out sympathetically, but ends up grating on your every nerve.  And don't even get me started on the lifeless, derivative score, terrible useage of pop songs throughout, and the pitiable direction of Mark Griffiths (who can't seem to make even a decent film yet) all contribute to this phenomenally bad film which drags on and on and on. . .  The hypocrisy in the film is also ver &quot;in your face,&quot; with a mother who claims to be a good loving, Christian woman but curses anyone who annoys her and says that the &quot;miracle of the cards&quot; was a &quot;miracle of the world,&quot; completely shattering her &quot;miracle of God&quot; image and statements throughout the film.  You almost get the feeling it doesn't WANT to end.  Skip this movie at all costs!  Don't rent it, don't watch it at a friends, and most certainly don't even give it a second thought!

He breaks the Guinness World record for receiving the most get-well cards (1.3 million cards from all around the world). While investigating the 'real facts' behind this true-life story which includes a real life miracle, a skeptical reporter (Kirk Cameron) expects to uncover an over-sensationalized account of God supposedly intervening in the lives of believers. What he finds is nowhere close to what he expects. This really is a heartwarming story of love and faith in the face of death.This is a true story which non-believers will probably see as a fantasy .
