Read ""Maximumdread""","[15, 19]","This movie is just plain bizarre, but Soderberg has this knack of making the totally bizarre work for the movie rather than against it.  In other words, this movie was for me absolutely watchable and enjoyable despite the  fact that Soderberg is constantly testing the patience of the viewer.  It  has a John Waters quality in that regard.  Soderberg achieved the same  thing with the unconventional &quot;The Limey&quot;, although &quot;The  Limey&quot; is nowhere near as strange as  &quot;Schizopolis&quot;.Besides all the laughs and strange stuff that  left my mouth hanging open, I really enjoyed the way that this movie just  barely tells a story.  There _is_ a story buried in all the strange  sequences (I won't even bother trying to describe these sequences), but  it's just that: buried.  The story is only revealed through glimpses, just  enough to keep you watching.As I see more and more of his movies, I  become more and more of a Soderberg fan.  I really liked &quot;Sex, Lies,  and Videotape&quot;, but did not really keep up with Soderberg after that.  I've been going back and catching up and having a blast.  I was especially  impressed with his acting ability in this movie.  (I saw an interview with  Soderberg in which he says that he starred in this movie because he could  not find anybody else to do some of the strange things he does.)

Soderbergh is the writer, director, and lead actor in the film.  He plays an office worker who gets called on to write a speech for a self-help guru who is the figurehead of a philosophy called ""Eventualism.""  He also plays (in act 2 of the movie) a libidinous dentist who is having an affair with the wife of the character he plays in act 1.  Meanwhile, a deranged guy with a pest control suit and car is staging some daring videos involving acts of sex and violence - and he aims to film his attempt to kill the self help guru in act 3.  In act 3 the Soderbergh character is often filmed speaking in foreign languages while other characters speak English and respond as if there's nothing unusual about the foreign speech (French & Italian may come in handy here!).  Soderbergh introduces the film in a short sequence at the beginning and at the end he answers questions from a supposed theater audience - except you don't hear the questions.  There are a variety of bizarre sequences and non-sequiturs in the film, and it's hard to figure out what the point of it all is.Then, on the DVD Soderbergh interviews himself in a very amusing satirical ""director's commentary"" where he speaks as a pretentious, narcissistic ""artist"" who sees himself at the center of the social and cultural universe.  Which may be the point of the characters in the film itself... and even the little news clip interruption where the news show announces some common lady from New Mexico has been appointed to make all decisions and judgments about things in America.

185994,A34D06JL7LC6MU,1572521481,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Steven Soderbergh is one of those directors that are not afraid of doing something different or challenging. You won't find something more ""different"" than Schizopolis.The film doesn't have a plot exactly. It has a few loosely related scenes that form an incoherent whole. Giving Schizopolis a synopsis is easier than something likeEraserhead, but I'll be damned if I know what this movie's about.The film begins with Soderbergh introducing the film. He says a few funny things that quickly make it clear that this will be something offbeat, before a title card appears that reads: ""No fish were harmed during the making of this film.""At first, Soderbergh plays Fletcher Munson, a copywriter whose boss, Lester, dies suddenly leaving Fletcher to write an important speech that Lester was supposed to write. Later, Soderbergh also plays Dr. Jeffrey Korchek who is having an affair with Fletcher's wife. At least, that seems to be the case. When Korchek first sees her approaching his house, he does say ""I'm having an affair with my wife."" Everything is going well until Korchek falls for a patient...That looks exactly like Fletcher's wife.The script (I should say ""film,"" as Soderbergh didn't have a script when he began shooting) is full of terrific puns and dialogue. The banter between Fletcher and his wife (which parallels that of a bug man who has seemingly no relevance to the plot at first) is very amusing. Soderbergh's comment on an empty, modern-day marriage I'm guessing. Lester's funeral scene quite possibly the most politically incorrect eulogy ever put on film.Many storylines going on in the film don't seem to be going anywhere and, admittedly, many don't. It's all very surreal, almost a way of expressing cinema in an abstract way rather than as a coherent narrative piece. Some scenes seem like they could be a meditation on modern-day life (or the modern-day world), but the film's meaning (if there is one) has not been revealed by Soderbergh, to my knowledge. Maybe the film is better off when just accepted for its weirdness and watched than thought about and analyzed.Despite this, you will find yourself wondering ""what the f**k is going on?"" several times during the movie.As an actor, Soderbergh has an interesting screen presence. He has a rubber-like face that allows hysterical facial expressions, as well as very good comedic timing.Overall, Schizopolis is one of the most experimental films I've ever seen (from a director who works in the mainstream, anyway). Luckily, it's an experiment that works. I'll be damned if I know why it works, but it does. It's not perfect, but it's amusing throughout and brings an entirely new meaning to ""non-linear storytelling."" If you're looking for something impenetrable, this is what you want.Schizopolis is probably best summed up by a line Korchek's friend says to him in the film; ""And than another funny thing happened, followed by two things that were pretty amusing, and the whole thing ended with something that was just hysterical.""GRADE: B",4,A Very Funny Experiment,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,3022,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'directors', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'challenging', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'something', 'more', 'different', 'Schizopolis.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'exactly', 'few', 'loosely', 'related', 'scenes', 'form', 'incoherent', 'whole', 'Giving', 'Schizopolis', 'synopsis', 'easier', 'something', 'likeEraserhead', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about.The', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'introducing', 'film', 'few', 'funny', 'things', 'quickly', 'make', 'clear', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'offbeat', 'title', 'card', 'reads', 'fish', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'film', 'first', 'Soderbergh', 'Fletcher', 'Munson', 'copywriter', 'boss', 'Lester', 'suddenly', 'leaving', 'Fletcher', 'write', 'important', 'speech', 'Lester', 'was', 'supposed', 'write', 'Later', 'Soderbergh', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Korchek', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'Fletcher', 'wife', 'least', 'be', 'case', 'When', 'Korchek', 'first', 'approaching', 'house', 'say', ""'m"", 'having', 'affair', 'wife', 'Everything', 'going', 'well', 'Korchek', 'patient', 'exactly', 'Fletcher', 'wife.The', 'script', 'should', 'say', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'script', 'when', 'began', 'shooting', 'full', 'terrific', 'puns', 'dialogue', 'banter', 'Fletcher', 'wife', 'bug', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'relevance', 'plot', 'first', 'very', 'amusing', 'Soderbergh', 'comment', 'empty', 'modern-day', 'marriage', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Lester', 'funeral', 'scene', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'eulogy', 'ever', 'put', 'film.Many', 'storylines', 'going', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'anywhere', 'admittedly', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'very', 'surreal', 'almost', 'way', 'expressing', 'cinema', 'abstract', 'way', 'rather', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'piece', 'scenes', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'meditation', 'modern-day', 'life', 'modern-day', 'world', 'film', 'meaning', 'one', 'not', 'been', 'revealed', 'Soderbergh', 'knowledge', 'Maybe', 'film', 'better', 'off', 'when', 'just', 'accepted', 'weirdness', 'watched', 'thought', 'analyzed.Despite', 'will', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'f**k', 'going', 'several', 'times', 'movie.As', 'actor', 'Soderbergh', 'interesting', 'screen', 'presence', 'rubber-like', 'face', 'hysterical', 'facial', 'expressions', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'comedic', 'timing.Overall', 'Schizopolis', 'one', 'most', 'experimental', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'director', 'who', 'mainstream', 'anyway', 'Luckily', 'experiment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'know', 'why', 'not', 'perfect', 'amusing', 'entirely', 'new', 'meaning', 'non-linear', 'storytelling', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'impenetrable', 'what', 'want.Schizopolis', 'probably', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'line', 'Korchek', 'friend', 'film', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'followed', 'two', 'things', 'were', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'whole', 'thing', 'ended', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'hysterical', 'GRADE', 'B']",N/A
185995,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,1572521481,Lleu Christopher,"[2, 4]","This is a boldly experimental film that has only the merest of plots. Along with Sex, Lies and Videotape, Schizopolis highlights Steve Soderbergh's talent as an alternative director, before he settled into a more conventional and less interesting style. It's difficult to describe this movie or compare it to anything else, which is refreshing. This is one of the few films that is truly unique. If it must be characterized, I suppose you could call it a broad satire on modern life. There is a cult called Eventualism that is a connecting thread. A significant point is that this Scientology-like cult, whose leader is played by Soderbergh (who also has another role as a dentist), is no more ridiculous than anything else in the film. Everything, from the sitcommish way a husband greets his wife after work to office politics is reduced to absurdity. If there is a message here, it may be that the line separating the ordinary from the bizarre is razor thin. There is something disconcerting about seeing everyday conversations transformed into non sequiturs. In one scene, people spontaneously start talking Chinese. In others, they simply talk nonsense. As in a David Lynch film, people's very identities are subject to change. Is reality really as solid and reliable as we normally assume? While some people will find this simply confusing and pointless, if you let yourself get into the mood, it will make you think.

185996,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1572521481,Robert I. Hedges,"[22, 22]","This is far and away the most unique and original movie I have ever seen. There is no close second place. Steven Soderbergh wrote, starred in, and directed this little-known masterpiece, and I am now a loyal fan. The caution on the box perhaps best summarizes the film: ""Warning: All attempts at synopsizing the film have ended in failure and hospitalization."" This is truth in advertising if I have ever seen it. Think of ""Schizopolis"" as a narcissistic, paranoid blend of equal parts ""Head,"" ""1984,"" ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" and ""Unarius.""The film is absolutely impossible to categorize. It occurs in three principal acts, but they are all circular and the plots entangle themselves in the end in an almost Seinfeldesque manner. Steven Soderbergh stars as both Fletcher Munson and Dr. Jeffrey Korchek. Munson is a curiously self-absorbed speechwriter for New Age guru (and founder of ""Eventualism"") T. Azimuth Schwitters, while Korchek, a dentist with a Muzak fixation dominates act two by having an affair with Munson's disenchanted wife from act one. Throughout all this, local exterminator (and celebrity) Elmo Oxygen uses very unconventional pillow talk to seduce housewives while plotting against Schwitters. Eddie Jemison, noteworthy as ""Nameless Numberhead Man,"" is the perfect comic foil for Munson.Although you will need to watch this movie several times to even scratch the surface of the nuances it contains, several themes are apparent, most notably the satirical approach to contemporary society which is infused throughout the film in many ways, most notably in the dialogue. When Munson greets his wife after work he says ""Generic greeting,"" to which she replies ""Generic greeting returned."" Later in the film several other dialogue issues occur with Soderbergh's characters speaking in Japanese, French, and Italian seemingly at random and to great comic effect.From the outset, this film is highly segmented (much like an episode of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"") and confrontational. There is even an explicit warning in the beginning which says ""If you don't understand this film, it's your fault and not ours."" This type of in-your-face humor is very uncommon and I simply loved it. The film is extremely difficult to follow if you are approaching it like a conventional movie with a well developed plot and characters, but if you can deal with the exceptional stream-of-consciousness, non sequitur humor that Soderbergh uses here, ""Schizopolis"" will become one of your favorites, too.I highly recommend this film.",5,Viewing Prerequisites: A Working Knowledge Of Japanese And Dentistry,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2544,"['far', 'away', 'most', 'unique', 'original', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'close', 'second', 'place', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'wrote', 'starred', 'directed', 'little-known', 'masterpiece', 'am', 'now', 'loyal', 'fan', 'caution', 'box', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'Warning', 'attempts', 'synopsizing', 'film', 'have', 'ended', 'failure', 'hospitalization', 'truth', 'advertising', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Think', 'Schizopolis', 'narcissistic', 'paranoid', 'blend', 'equal', 'parts', 'Head', '1984', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'Unarius', 'film', 'absolutely', 'impossible', 'categorize', 'three', 'principal', 'acts', 'are', 'circular', 'plots', 'entangle', 'end', 'almost', 'Seinfeldesque', 'manner', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Fletcher', 'Munson', 'Dr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Korchek', 'Munson', 'curiously', 'self-absorbed', 'speechwriter', 'New', 'Age', 'guru', 'founder', 'Eventualism', 'T.', 'Azimuth', 'Schwitters', 'Korchek', 'dentist', 'Muzak', 'fixation', 'act', 'two', 'having', 'affair', 'Munson', 'disenchanted', 'wife', 'act', 'one', 'local', 'exterminator', 'celebrity', 'Elmo', 'Oxygen', 'very', 'unconventional', 'pillow', 'talk', 'seduce', 'housewives', 'plotting', 'Schwitters', 'Eddie', 'Jemison', 'noteworthy', 'Nameless', 'Numberhead', 'Man', 'perfect', 'comic', 'foil', 'Munson.Although', 'will', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'even', 'scratch', 'surface', 'nuances', 'several', 'themes', 'are', 'apparent', 'most', 'notably', 'satirical', 'approach', 'contemporary', 'society', 'infused', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'notably', 'dialogue', 'When', 'Munson', 'wife', 'work', 'Generic', 'greeting', 'Generic', 'greeting', 'returned', 'Later', 'film', 'several', 'other', 'dialogue', 'issues', 'occur', 'Soderbergh', 'characters', 'speaking', 'Japanese', 'French', 'Italian', 'seemingly', 'random', 'great', 'comic', 'outset', 'film', 'highly', 'segmented', 'much', 'episode', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'confrontational', 'even', 'explicit', 'warning', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'fault', 'not', 'ours', 'type', 'in-your-face', 'humor', 'very', 'uncommon', 'simply', 'loved', 'film', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'follow', 'are', 'approaching', 'conventional', 'movie', 'well', 'developed', 'plot', 'characters', 'can', 'deal', 'exceptional', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'non', 'sequitur', 'humor', 'Soderbergh', 'here', 'Schizopolis', 'will', 'become', 'one', 'favorites', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

He discovers that he has a doppelganger Dr. Korchek, (also played by soderbergh) who is a dentist and loves listening to ""muzak."" He later discovers that his wife is having an affair with him.The film has breaks in it which are similar to the ones in some of Paul Verhoven's films, (notably Robocop and Starship Troopers.) There are also scenes where different characters converse in unusual manner. Munson and his wife talk to each other in what was dubbed 'generic speak.' They talk to each other as if they are narrating what is happening. Another charachter, a pest exterminator talks to women by using random words together in phrases that almost seems like a code.The film has some very nice cinematograpgy including a scene filmed at 2 frames per second and another in time-lapse photography. The acting is not very good but acceptable.The special features on the DVD are a theatrical trailer, what looks like a deleted scene, and two audio comentaries. One with Steven Soderbergh interviewing himself, the other with producer John Hardy, actor and casting director David Jensen, production sound mixer Paul Ledford, and actor Michael Malone.This film would probably be appreciated most by diehard Soderbergh fans.",3,Very Weird. has some cool scenes.,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1577,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.Schizopolis', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'clost', 'weirdness', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead.The', 'film', 'Fletcher', 'Munson', 'speechwriter', 'played', 'Soderbergh', 'new-age', 'scientology-esque', 'guru', 'doppelganger', 'Dr.', 'Korchek', 'also', 'played', 'soderbergh', 'who', 'dentist', 'listening', 'muzak', 'later', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'him.The', 'film', 'breaks', 'are', 'similar', 'ones', 'Paul', 'Verhoven', 'films', 'notably', 'Robocop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'where', 'different', 'characters', 'converse', 'unusual', 'manner', 'Munson', 'wife', 'talk', 'other', 'what', 'was', 'dubbed', ""'generic"", 'speak', 'talk', 'other', 'are', 'narrating', 'what', 'happening', 'charachter', 'pest', 'exterminator', 'talks', 'women', 'using', 'random', 'words', 'together', 'phrases', 'almost', 'code.The', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'cinematograpgy', 'including', 'scene', 'filmed', '2', 'frames', 'second', 'time-lapse', 'photography', 'acting', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'acceptable.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'what', 'deleted', 'scene', 'two', 'audio', 'comentaries', 'One', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'interviewing', 'other', 'producer', 'John', 'Hardy', 'actor', 'casting', 'director', 'David', 'Jensen', 'production', 'sound', 'mixer', 'Paul', 'Ledford', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Malone.This', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'appreciated', 'most', 'diehard', 'Soderbergh', 'fans']",N/A
