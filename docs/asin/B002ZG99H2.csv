1312421,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG99H2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","It seems like every year there are a dozen or so `buddy cop' movies made, and nearly every one of them is a pointless regurgitation of the last one.  `The Other Guys' doesn't break any new ground, but what it does do it layer the typical scenarios with ridiculously witty dialog and a cool charisma that makes for a memorable and entertaining ride.  I remember reading a critic state that they finally got the `buddy cop' movie right, so now they should stop trying.  I agree.  This film narrowly misses genre perfection (Mark Wahlberg tries way too hard here and drags the first half of the film down a peg) and so the studios really should let this genre alone for a while; let it rest.  The biggest surprise here was Will Ferrell.  His comedic timing has rarely been better than it is here, and he really plays it smart.  His one-liners are hysterical, and yet he never resorts to his usual outlandish behavior.  He keeps it very cool throughout; playing a variation of his shtick in a manner we haven't seen from him before.  He slays the dialog, selling every preposterous line after another.  And really, it is the dialog that makes this film so entertaining.  The TLC references (Michael Keaton finally makes a noteworthy impact), the whole Tuna bit, Walhberg's fawning over Mendes, JERSEY BOYS...there is just too much to love about this movie.  Like I said, it's nearly perfect.  Wahlberg has never been my favorite actor, but the first half of the film sinks in his efforts to be funny (NOT NATURAL) but Ferrell is a laugh riot (where was his Globe nomination?) and together with some smart scripting they make `The Other Guys' a must see summer blockbuster.Oh yeah, and Ice T's narration was just plain brilliant!",4,I ain't too proud to beg...,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,1724,"['year', 'are', 'dozen', 'so', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'made', 'nearly', 'one', 'pointless', 'regurgitation', 'last', 'one', 'Other', 'Guys', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'what', 'do', 'layer', 'typical', 'scenarios', 'ridiculously', 'witty', 'dialog', 'cool', 'charisma', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'remember', 'reading', 'critic', 'state', 'finally', 'got', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'right', 'so', 'now', 'should', 'stop', 'trying', 'agree', 'film', 'narrowly', 'genre', 'perfection', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'here', 'drags', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'down', 'peg', 'so', 'studios', 'really', 'should', 'let', 'genre', 'alone', 'while', 'let', 'rest', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'here', 'was', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedic', 'timing', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'really', 'smart', 'one-liners', 'are', 'hysterical', 'yet', 'never', 'usual', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'very', 'cool', 'playing', 'variation', 'shtick', 'manner', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'dialog', 'selling', 'preposterous', 'line', 'really', 'dialog', 'film', 'so', 'entertaining', 'TLC', 'references', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'finally', 'noteworthy', 'impact', 'whole', 'Tuna', 'bit', 'Walhberg', 'fawning', 'Mendes', 'JERSEY', 'BOYS', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'said', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Wahlberg', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'sinks', 'efforts', 'be', 'funny', 'NOT', 'NATURAL', 'Ferrell', 'laugh', 'riot', 'where', 'was', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'together', 'smart', 'scripting', 'make', 'Other', 'Guys', 'must', 'see', 'summer', 'yeah', 'Ice', 'T', 'narration', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'brilliant']",N/A

I used to hate his style of comedy and believed it was too crude and offensive and just plain goofy for most viewers, and to be perfectly honest sometimes I still believe this.

This of course leads to the two of them constantly getting into arguments while going for car rides across the city of New York.The movie isn't flawless because Will Ferrell's character tends to repeat some of the themes over and over, such as his obsession with the Little River Band and his cluelessness to understand he somehow attracts extremely hot women.Expect whackiness to dominate the entire storyline, and expect a few failed jokes along the way too.

1312434,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99H2,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 8]","Like Laurel and Hardy, like Abbot and Costello, like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are perfectly mismatched in the buddy cop film ""The Other Guys,"" although outward appearances suggest this would not be the case. They could not be anything less alike, physically, behaviorally, or even professionally; Wahlberg, for example, has been nominated for an Oscar, and Ferrell ... hasn't. Despite this - or perhaps because of this - they play off of each other with the timing and precision of natural born comedians. They are, quite simply, inherently funny together. I haven't seen a better pairing of actors in a comedy for quite some time, save only for Steve Carrel and Tina Fey in this year's ""Date Night,"" where they were given license to flaunt their impressive improvisational skills.""The Other Guys"" is, in this reviewer's humble opinion, one of the year's funniest films. It is not, however, merely a vehicle for Ferrell and Wahlberg to act goofy in front of the camera; director Adam McKay and his writing partner Chris Henchy actually bother to tell a story, and they put their characters into genuinely humorous situations. This is quite a turnaround for McKay, whose previous film, ""Step Brothers,"" reached a new low, begging the question of why comedies weren't allowed to be funny anymore. I doubt he read my review for that film, but perhaps he came to understand that, to get a real comical reaction from the audience, he must provide them with more than vulgar characters and disposable one-liners comprised mostly of four-letter words. Let's hope he keeps this in mind for his next film.The film opens with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as a pair of hotshot New York cops, who, along with just about everyone else, painfully mock the NYPD's lowliest staff members - otherwise known as the other guys. These include Detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell), a forensic accountant, and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg), a former street cop. Gamble is calm and gullible, the kind of guy who plays it safe, likes to hum his favorite songs, isn't the quickest when it comes to punch lines, and is perfectly content doing paperwork. Hoitz, on the other hand, is angry and bitter, hungry for some actual police work and not at all comfortable with sitting behind a desk all day. He has been stuck with Gamble ever since embarrassing himself in public incident, the details of which are too funny to give away.For reasons I will not reveal, Gamble and Hoitz have the opportunity to step up and be real detectives, which will hopefully win them some degree of respect. Gamble, through his paperwork, becomes suspicious of a wealthy British investor (Steve Coogan), although no one, not even the police captain (Michael Keaton), takes the case seriously. Because of this, things go from bad to worse every time Gamble and Hoitz delve further into the investigation. To describe every bad moment between them, to mention every disaster that befalls them, would do little more than ruin the hilarity. I will say, however, that there are many well-written jokes related to Gamble's mock wooden gun (a replacement for his actual gun) and his Prius, which in due time loses one of its doors and is riddled with bullet holes.A curious but nonetheless amusing recurring gag involves Gamble's wife, a doctor named Sheila, played by the indisputably beautiful Eva Mendes. She's so gorgeous that Hoitz is at a loss to explain why Gamble thinks she's merely ordinary. She's also quite accommodating, at times exceedingly so, and yet Gamble continuously refers to her as an unbearable nag. This is, we eventually discover, a trend in Gamble's life, having previously been involved with - and indifferent to - a number of smoking hot women, the kind most men would give their eye-teeth to spend just an hour with. Let is suffice to say that Gamble has his reasons for being the man he is. Let it also suffice to say that Hoitz and Gamble are on completely different frequencies when it comes to women. This connects to the film's one weakness: Hoitz's romance with an aspiring ballet dancer, an unnecessary character who's part of an equally unnecessary subplot.Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Other Guys"" is the way it uses comedy to send an insightful message about corporate greed, partly through the antics of Coogan's character but most obviously through a series of graphs and figures displayed during the end credits. I recommend you stay and study them carefully. You may learn a thing or two. If you simply don't have the time for them, at least you'll have seen Ferrell and Wahlberg in action, and that is truly a sight to behold. Yes, it's an unlikely pairing, but oh, what a pairing it is. They're such a great team. I wouldn't mind seeing their surnames displayed on marquees and posters, immortally joined, able to draw in audiences with the promise of a comedy classic.

Straight cop + ridiculous cop, they don't mesh well: hijinks ensue. I admit, the trailer didn't pull me into the theater for that very reason and I like both main actors in most everything they've done. Luckily this was on the rental cue and I got a chance to watch it. I think this is one of the best films either actor has been in and best film director Adam McKay has pulled off. The reason it works so well is because everyone here is at the top of their game, from the top billing down to the smallest supporting cast member. Farrell has moved from doing goofy bit parts to goofy characters with occasional punch to goofy characters that never drop the ball. His character is FLAWLESSLY funny and never suffers for weak spots in dialogue. And then there's Walburg who plays the straight cop but manages to both allow Farrell to have his high moments and still slip in that odd phrase or look that makes him believable AND funny. And THEN you get a great supporting cast who, again, hit it just right AND then you get stunt work that makes the action/danger seem real, hightening the intensity and humor. I literally laughed nearly non-stop through this film and haven't seen anything this funny in awhile.

Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Anne Heche and the voice of: Ice-TWRITTEN BY: Adam McKay and Chris HenchyDIRECTED BY: Adam McKayRated: PG - 13Genre: Action / ComedyRelease Date: 06 August 2010Review Date: 12 August 2010Wow - what a movie! The laughs never stop in The Other Guys! I was literally laughing every two to three seconds, over and over again, non stop, for nearly two hours! Hands down, the funniest film of the year so far! And don't think for a second that all the laughs come solely from Will Ferrell; Mark Wahlberg, Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes are hysterical as well!The first few minutes or so had me wondering what was up with my man Mark Wahlberg. I was like, `why is he over-acting so badly?' But the more layers we peeled back from his character, Terri Hoitz, I realized the beauty Wahlberg was giving the character. Hoitz is a pissed off child, throwing tantrum after tantrum and its hilarious!Hoitz is so pissed because his desk-dork of a partner, Allen Gamble (Ferrell) wants nothing more out of his 9 to 5, than to be confined to the inside walls of their office. This does not sit well with Hoitz as he has a blood thirsty taste for action, and wants to be on the road with their piers, taking down the bad guys. Whatever do these two do for a living, you ask? Hoitz and Gamble are New York detectives who are the laughing stock of the entire police department. Unlike their hot-shot comrades, they are referred to as - the other guys.Officer Hoitz realizes he has to do something drastic if he is to get Gamble to go on a call with him. So naturally, after losing it with Gamble numerous times in the humorous opening sequence, Hoitz comes does just that; the details of which will not be divulged here.  Just know that they take a call, and a case develops which is the entire force for the entire movie. In most films, this is called the `plot.'I wouldn't really call it a plot in this case however; for in most films, the plot would be comparable to a heart or some other vital organ that keeps the movie going. No, it's not vital at all in The Other Guys; it's more like a container, to fill with lots of useless stuff!  But everyone involved in this film knows that you are either going to love it or hate it, and if you love it then it requires no plot at all!Nine and a half times out of 10 any movie that relied on this method, would not be a stellar flick; but The Other Guys is the rare exception. The movie is simply so much fun, and is stuffed with so many brilliant laughs, that we don't even have the lung power to calm down from our fits of dry heaving laughter, to even worry with a plot! There's a bad guy, he's doing bad stuff and our guys are out to stop him; that's all we need - now dump all the funny stuff right on top of it, please!We know Mark Wahlberg can act, so let's talk about Mr. Ferrell for a minute shall we? What a performance. He's playing an idiot as usual, yes; but he's so damn good at it here. Just like Steve Carell in Dinner for Schmucks, Ferrell is so into character - that you really believe he is this ridiculous of a tool. You believe him when he tells Mark Wahlberg that he has about six copies of the Little River Band CD in his Prius. And you believe him when he explains that he was so intoxicated that he honestly mistook a tube of tooth paste for astronaut food.Ferrell is a comedic genius; easily in the top five best comics working today. His height, body type and child like sensibility give him an edge over other comics. He also has a divine gift of pronouncing things in a gravely entertaining fashion; such as the way he referred to the female mountain lion as `Karen' in Talladega Nights, or how he repeatedly calls his Captain (Michael Keaton) by his first name, `Gene', in this film. These aren't necessarily funny names on their own, but coming out of Ferrell's mouth while in his shiny little character - they're as good as gold!I loved the scenes with Eva Mendes. She really pushed the comedy with Ferrell as a couple who we look at and just ask `how?' and `why?' Walberg's character Hoitz particularly finds them an odd match when he is invited over for dinner. He must have asked nearly half a dozen times who she was; not buying for a second that she could possibly be Gamble's wife in even the slightest minute form of reality.Most films would not have had the guts to try a joke like this that many times, but The Other Guys does, and I'm thankful for it! Far too many times have I wished a comedy would take the joke to the next level; just slide it a tad bit further past the line of normal acceptance, before it's gone too far. The Other Guys carries its jokes to that same line, carefully sets them down before it, looks the audience dead in the eye - and then hauls off and boots it across the line, time and time again! I know some audience members will find this tiresome, but I found it refreshing, to see a film that just doesn't give a damn and knows how much fun it truly is.And before we leave, we can't not mention the performance of the man himself - Michael Keaton. Where has he been? Man, do I miss him! He killed as the Captain here folks, let me tell you. His little back story for his character and what he does with his spare time, nearly threw me out of my seat laughing. Classic, classic stuff! I've long missed seeing Keaton's physical mannerisms when he's going off in a rant, and they are nicely on display once more for us, in this movie.Writer and director Adam McKay has a perfect record with his four films. All of them starring Will Ferrell, and all of them sensational. From Anchorman, to Talladega Nights, to Step Brothers to The Other Guys; where will he take us next? I don't care if it's a black and white musical with Muppets, giant skunks, vampires and dinosaurs; I'll be in line to buy a ticket to his next film.",5,The Other Guys Review,1283990400,"09 9,

Jackson.  So I'm kinda surprised I didn't like this movie more than I did.Ferrell and Wahlberg play mismatched cop buddies who hit the streets trying to replace the recently departed dynamic duo (Johnson and Jackson).  Their polar opposite personalities make a good setup for the Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello type of humor.  And, while I did find myself laughing out loud at times, there were other dry spells where I was slightly bored.  For me, some jokes hit and some missed.As with most movies with Will Ferrell, you expect some crazy antics and this plot doesn't fail to deliver.  Some of the craziness was a bit over the top for me, however, and detracted slightly from my enjoyment.Eva Mendes, who plays Ferrell's character's wife, is smoking hot, as usual.  In the storyline, she's undervalued by her husband, but Wahlberg's character picks up the slack by letting her know how much HE appreciates her every time he gets the chance.

They've both got pasts, which keeps them doing desk jobs, while admiring the pair of super cops who can do no wrong, Highsmith and Danson (also great cop names).  But when they accidentally stumble upon a scheme (not knowing the full depth of the diabolical plan), they must man up and prove themselves to be the cops they've always wanted to be.  Or at least give it a shot.THE OTHER GUYS is surprisingly enjoyable.  It's not nearly as good as some other Will Ferrell vehicles; but then, we all know that, funny as Ferrell can be, he can also miss the mark by a mile (LAND OF THE LOST?  SEMI-PRO?).  Here, he's pretty much good.  In fact, most of the acting is good--Mark Wahlberg shows some surprising comedy chops, deadpanning against Ferrell's showmanship.  Also along for the ride are Michael Keaton (a pleasant surprise); Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr., as Gamble and Hoitz's main competition; Steve Coogan, doing his TROPIC THUNDER supporting thing with equal brilliance; Eva Mendes, holding her own against Ferrell; and Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as Highsmith and Danson, giving brilliant self-parodies that are unfortunately underused.So, you're asking yourself: Why the three stars?  Because the film just doesn't congeal.  It feels shallow, unfinished; while the performances are all good, some of the jokes are left to dwindle.  There were very many potentially hilarious moments where the audience didn't laugh at all, because the film just didn't go that one extra step; and other instances where it went a step too far.  Adam McKay and Ferrell make a brilliant team (and we'll throw Wahlberg into the mix, hoping the three reunite for a movie again in the future); but this movie is one of their lesser efforts, primarily because it doesn't feel finished.  It's good for a few laughs, but nothing on the level of their previous collaborations.  It just isn't as memorable as ANCHORMAN, TALLADEGA NIGHTS, or STEP BROTHERS.  If you're a fan of Ferrell, or want to see Mark Wahlberg being intentionally funny (sounds harsh, but yeah, you remember THE HAPPENING), then you should see this movie.

The film is co-written with Chris Henchy (""Land of the Lost"", ""Spin City""), featuring cinematographer Oliver Wood (""The Bourne Identity"" films, ""Face/Off"", ""Fantastic Four"") and music by Jon Brion (""Step Brothers"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Magnolia"").The summer film took the #1 spot from ""Inception"" in the box office and brought in over $168 million and it helps that the film received nearly 80% of positive reviews from film critics.  If anything, if you want to spoof the buddy-cop film genre, ""The Other Guys""delivers in insanity, gags and all out entertainment.  Now, ""The Other Guys"" receives its Blu-ray and DVD release on December 14th.  The Blu-ray release ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" features the original theatrical release and an unrated version with nine additional minutes.VIDEO:""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  As usual, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment gives us a wonderful picture quality featuring plenty of detail, dark blacks and wonderful colors.  First, let's talk about the detail...impressive.  You'll see the skin pores on Will Ferrell's face, you will see how New York City's detail is captured remarkably well in HD.  Even the dents, bullet holes and broken windshield...  Images are sharp, colors are vibrant and I detected no banding, artifacts or edge enhancement.  PQ for ""The Other Guys"" is awesome!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Also included is an English audio description track in Dolby Surround.""The Other Guys"" sounds absolutely awesome via lossless.  The film has its fair share of action sequences, car chases, explosions and plenty of cars crashing, gun shots, glass crashing and the sound effects sound great as it comes from the surround channels.  Action sequences, although numerous, the film tends to take its break from the action scenes while focusing on the comedic dialogue. Dialogue and music is clear through the center and front channels.  As for LFE, there is a good amount of bass bumping courtesy of the hip hop music soundtrack throughout the film.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Hindi.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" comes with the following special features in High Definition in English Stereo with subtitles in English, Portuguese and Spanish:* ""Pimps Don't Cry"" music video - (3:50) A Funny or Die music video with Eva Mendes with Cee-Lo Green.* Extreme Close Up - (5:17) Interviews on the set with the cast and director of ""The Other Guys""extremely close up (literally).* Everyone Hates The DVD Guy - (4:47) The cast and crew showing their distaste towards  the DVD Guy (who is videotaping the crew during their off-time moments).* Lendl Global Commercial - (:36) A commercial for Lendl Global.* Bed Bath and Way Beyond - (4:06) Adam McKay talks about working with Michael Keaton.

And as many of Will Ferrell's films have had its up and downs in the box office, ""The Other Guys"" is one of those films that you can't help but laugh, enjoy and just see how far these guys go with their insane story and improvisation.There are so many buddy cop films out there, especially comedy and action-based films that have have made us laugh but ""The Other Guys"" is unlike any of those films.  It's unique comedy style is driven by how different this film is.  For example, the main protagonists, Allan and Terry... these guys don't get along.  Allen, who is somewhat of an uber-nerd and unlikely cop has only dated hot women and his wife (played by Eva Mendes) is hot!  And the two talk about their sexual nature as if it was no problem.  But yet Allan keeps saying how his wife is so plain.  And just seeing his partner Terry having his eyes fixated on Mendes' breasts and when he goes to give her a kiss goodbye on the cheek, he tries to kiss her on the neck and that was so hilariously wrong, but it shows you the instability of Allan and Terry's working relationship.The fact that these two individuals are so different is what makes this comedy work.  Yes, films like ""Bad Boys"" have two protagonist who are different but yet they back each other up and hang out despite their differences.  With Allan and Terry, these guys are just so different and are literally oil and water, so seeing these two work together is just hilarious and fun.  Especially when you get to know their backstory.  The very quiet Allan, a former pimp?  The very angry Terry once learned ballet and art?  Unusual it may be, it works.As for the Blu-ray release, ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition"" is a pretty solid Blu-ray release. Awesome PQ, very good AQ and over a 100 minutes of special features.But it all comes down to your acceptance of these type of comedy films.  Will Ferrell excels at self-deprecating humor while Mark Wahlberg was probably the actor people aren't used to seeing in comedy films.  Both are very different in the types of films they have done, but yet it works because in the film, they are different and despite their differences, they manage to work as a team. Personally, I want to see more of Detective Allen Gamble and Detective Terry Hoitz... As long as Director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell collaborate again, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.Overall, if you have enjoyed Adam McKay/Will Ferrell films like""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and ""Taladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"", you'll love ""The Other Guys: The Unrated Other Edition.",4,"Blu-ray: If you are familiar with Will Ferrell films and have enjoyed them

1312452,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG99H2,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Parts of this rambunctious 2010 buddy-cop action comedy are hilariously funny, but director Adam McKay (Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy) can't seem to keep up the momentum he sets up in the movie's first fifteen frenetic minutes. Perhaps due to Will Ferrell's presence, it starts to feel like a feature-length manifestation of one of his Funny or Die videos or at its worst, a padded skit fromSaturday Night Live. On the upside, pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg as mismatched and thoroughly inept NYPD desk jockeys is inspired casting and provides several giddy moments, but the screenplay co-written by McKay and Chris Henchy fails to sustain the sharpness of its initial satirical edge through the rest of the story.Ferrell plays mild-mannered Allen Gamble, who is perfectly content as a precinct pencil-pusher. He's partnered with Wahlberg's Terry Hoitz, a hot-headed screw-up desperate to get his old beat back. Terry lost his self-confidence as well as his gun when he inadvertently shot Derek Jeter before a Yankees game, a tactical error that has made him the subject of constant ridicule at the station. Both Allen and Terry idolize the superstar macho detectives (played with comic relish by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who have caused millions of dollars of damage in their relentless pursuit of the city's biggest crime rings. When their fate gets sealed in a most surreal stunt jump, Terry and Allen begin to piece together a convoluted white-collar conspiracy involving a billionaire's plan to cover the losses he has incurred for a multinational conglomerate.In the meantime, the reluctant partners get to know each other personally and discover some intriguing surprises, including Allen's hot, attentive physician wife Sheila. Whether spouting Zen-like psycho-babble or driving his tomato-red Toyota Prius, Ferrell is in typical deadpan form here except when reenacting his outrageous college years as a pimp. Wahlberg works best when he acts incredulous at his circumstances such as seeing a surprisingly funny Eva Mendes as Sheila helplessly smitten with Allen. It's also good to see Michael Keaton back in fine comic form as the precinct captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath & Beyond and cannot help but share his wisdom by quoting TLC lyrics.Steve Coogan manages a few funny moments as the targeted billionaire, as do Ron Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a competitive pair of bumbling partners. The 2011 DVD offers only three extras - a ten-minute making-of featurette (""Crash and Burn!: On the Set of The Other Guys"") which focuses mostly on the opening sequence; a four-minute short focused on unused scenes of Keaton at his retail job; and five deleted scenes. The Blu-Ray disc adds several more featurettes; a gag reel; an audio ""mom-mentary"" recorded by the mothers of Ferrell, McKay, and Henchy; the music video for the closing credits version of ""Pimps Don't Cry""; a Judd Apatow-like ""Line-o-rama""; and even more deleted and extended scenes.",4,Frenetic Buddy Cop Comedy Starts Strong But Peters Out in a Convoluted Storyline,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,2997,"['Parts', 'rambunctious', '2010', 'buddy-cop', 'action', 'comedy', 'are', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'up', 'momentum', 'up', 'movie', 'first', 'fifteen', 'frenetic', 'minutes', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'presence', 'feel', 'feature-length', 'manifestation', 'one', 'Funny', 'Die', 'videos', 'worst', 'padded', 'skit', 'fromSaturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'upside', 'pairing', 'Ferrell', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'mismatched', 'thoroughly', 'inept', 'NYPD', 'desk', 'jockeys', 'inspired', 'casting', 'several', 'giddy', 'moments', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'McKay', 'Chris', 'Henchy', 'sustain', 'sharpness', 'initial', 'satirical', 'edge', 'rest', 'story.Ferrell', 'mild-mannered', 'Allen', 'Gamble', 'who', 'perfectly', 'content', 'precinct', 'pencil-pusher', 'partnered', 'Wahlberg', 'Terry', 'Hoitz', 'hot-headed', 'screw-up', 'desperate', 'get', 'old', 'beat', 'back', 'Terry', 'lost', 'self-confidence', 'as', 'well', 'gun', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'shot', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'Yankees', 'game', 'tactical', 'error', 'made', 'subject', 'constant', 'ridicule', 'station', 'Allen', 'Terry', 'idolize', 'superstar', 'macho', 'detectives', 'played', 'comic', 'relish', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'who', 'have', 'caused', 'millions', 'dollars', 'damage', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'city', 'biggest', 'crime', 'rings', 'When', 'fate', 'sealed', 'most', 'surreal', 'stunt', 'jump', 'Terry', 'Allen', 'begin', 'piece', 'together', 'convoluted', 'white-collar', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'billionaire', 'plan', 'cover', 'losses', 'incurred', 'multinational', 'conglomerate.In', 'meantime', 'reluctant', 'partners', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'personally', 'discover', 'intriguing', 'surprises', 'including', 'Allen', 'hot', 'attentive', 'physician', 'wife', 'Sheila', 'Whether', 'spouting', 'Zen-like', 'psycho-babble', 'driving', 'tomato-red', 'Toyota', 'Prius', 'Ferrell', 'typical', 'deadpan', 'form', 'here', 'when', 'reenacting', 'outrageous', 'college', 'years', 'pimp', 'Wahlberg', 'best', 'when', 'incredulous', 'circumstances', 'such', 'seeing', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Sheila', 'helplessly', 'Allen', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'back', 'fine', 'comic', 'form', 'precinct', 'captain', 'who', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'share', 'wisdom', 'quoting', 'TLC', 'lyrics.Steve', 'Coogan', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'targeted', 'billionaire', 'do', 'Ron', 'Riggle', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Jr.', 'competitive', 'pair', 'bumbling', 'partners', '2011', 'DVD', 'only', 'three', 'extras', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Crash', 'Burn', 'Set', 'Other', 'Guys', 'mostly', 'opening', 'sequence', 'four-minute', 'short', 'focused', 'unused', 'scenes', 'Keaton', 'retail', 'job', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'several', 'more', 'featurettes', 'gag', 'reel', 'audio', 'mom-mentary', 'recorded', 'mothers', 'Ferrell', 'McKay', 'Henchy', 'music', 'video', 'closing', 'version', 'Pimps', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Judd', 'Apatow-like', 'Line-o-rama', 'even', 'more', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes']",N/A

I feel like a lot of people fail to understand that comedy is a dynamic art, and it requires constant experimentation. Were successful comedians to simply stick to the same formula time and time again, the comedy would grow stale, and nobody would be amused- not the actors, not the writers, and certainly not the audience. The downside of experimentation and trying new things, of course, is that there is always the risk of falling flat (which does happen at times in this movie). Personally, I would much rather watch a variety of comedic approaches, even if some will of course not be as funny as others.Therefore, though ""The Other Guys"" is not on par with the very best, it's still quite enjoyable- and the very concept of Will Ferrell as an action star/hard boiled detective (reformed from his days as a pimp in college, mind you), is hilarious in itself. Wahlberg is clearly out of his depth here (I suspect those confused looks on his face are not necessarily called for in the script, but generated from genuine bewilderment), but he does an admirable job of trying to keep pace with his costar.

I had my hopes up going in, finding the premise really promising, that is, until the wheels fell off in the movie's second half. THE OTHER GUYS is basically Mark Wahlberg whining a lot - whenever he's not being angry a lot - and Will Ferrell doing that Will Ferrell thing he does. They play NYPD detectives Gamble and Hoitz, except that they are NYPD detectives who are relegated to long term desk duty and, therefore, headed for career obscurity.Meanwhile, Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson get extended cameos as the hotshot top cops who then get sidelined unexpectedly (in a scene that cracked me up, even though we all saw that punchline coming). Now Gamble and Hoitz aim to fill those big shoes and hog the glory, bogart the media pub. It's tough going, though. Gamble comes transferred from Forensic Accounting; he's an officious paper pusher. And the hotheaded Hoitz, he's actually a good cop, but he's still living down having shot Derek Jeter. In New York City, that's pretty unforgivable (in Boston, it probably gets you a medal and a lobster). The blundering duo does eventually bump into a case and it involves one of those high stakes corporate swindles. Enter Steve Coogan as a Wall Street financier, except that Steve Coogan doesn't elevate the film. The film could've actually done with less of him.The thing of it is that, going in, I was really sold on the premise, and the off left field casting of Wahlberg and Ferrell as partners had me curious. There were a lot of good bits at the start, some of which set up character structure, cresting with Ferrell's hilarious ""tuna versus lion"" routine and the quiet fight at the funeral. Samuel Jackson and the Rock were funny for as long as they were around, and I liked that we never do learn what was up with Michael Keaton's habit of dropping lines from T.L.C. lyrics. I didn't necessarily buy into the film's recurring gag of Gamble as babe magnet. But Eva Mendes is good.I guess it bugs me that this film couldn't settle on a genre or couldn't seamlessly accommodate the two genres. Just when you'd think it was a buddy cop action flick with moments of levity, it'd shift into over-the-top send-up mode. See, once you go spoofy and you break with the rules of conventional reality, you've essentially just surrendered that element of grounding and believability. Hoitz's rage issue as a running joke gets really old. Ferrell's lack of restraint eventually lost me. For me, Gamble and Hoitz started out as interesting characters who then became caricatures of themselves, and I don't give one bit of cr@p about caricatures. I already saw MACGRUBER.

While good-intentioned, this duo is progressing down a path that will place them perilously close to comedic irrelevance.  Something new needs to emerge and interrupt what seems to be an almost systematic disintegration of an otherwise great pairing.The Other Guys MIGHT be an improvement to what is otherwise a re-imagining of their preceding project, Step Brothers, and even Talladega Nights before that, but it still just that:  A ritualistic adherence to the ""buddy"" theme that I'm pretty damn tired of seeing.I'm being unnecessarily cruel, but it's only because I care.  There's some real class present here, and it feels as if it's being buried under an insistent barrel of paper-thin jokes that quickly lose their welcome.  Where this movie needs to be slick as oil, it's essentially syrup, and this applies to its comedy as well:  Simply a trudge through the matter of a humorous concept rung through to its limits for us to see for a minute longer than what is appropriate.Even the plot feels monotonous and excessive, acting as an uninspired impression of corporate heisting and all that over-your-head nonsense.  It's convoluted, and not really worth analyzing in the first place.  The real story applies to our duo who, despite the predictability of each ones' characteristics, have a surprising amount of depth that leads me to believe that Wahlberg and Ferrell could work together again.While the comedy may often overstay its welcome, it is anything but conventional when Wahlberg and Ferrell are on the screen together, and this is when the film sparkles, even if it never really shines.  Their joint efforts usually make it work, and their genuine commitment is admirable.In fact, if anything, this is a movie chock full of recognizable faces, from Mendes and Keaton to the backseat duo in Jackson and Johnson, both of which are responsible for some of the most hilarious scenes in the entire movie.Despite all of this, The Other Guys still feels like a bruised horse that's tired of being flogged, and deservedly so.  I feel that this could be seen as a significant point in time for the professions of McKay and Ferrell:  Either reinvent oneself and move on from past tradition that has now proven to be obsolete, or fall in the pit that Robin Williams is still trying to find his way out of.",2,The Other Guys,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2466,"['relentless', 'nature', 'comedy', 'Ferrell', 'McKay', 'deploy', 'starting', 'wear', 'recall', 'defining', 'moments', 'time', 'Other', 'Guys', 'good-intentioned', 'duo', 'progressing', 'down', 'path', 'will', 'place', 'perilously', 'close', 'comedic', 'irrelevance', 'Something', 'new', 'needs', 'emerge', 'interrupt', 'what', 'be', 'almost', 'systematic', 'disintegration', 'otherwise', 'great', 'pairing.The', 'Other', 'Guys', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'improvement', 'what', 'otherwise', 're-imagining', 'preceding', 'project', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'even', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'still', 'just', 'ritualistic', 'adherence', 'buddy', 'theme', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'damn', 'tired', 'seeing.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'unnecessarily', 'cruel', 'only', 'care', 'real', 'class', 'present', 'here', 'being', 'buried', 'insistent', 'barrel', 'paper-thin', 'jokes', 'quickly', 'lose', 'welcome', 'Where', 'movie', 'be', 'slick', 'oil', 'essentially', 'syrup', 'comedy', 'well', 'Simply', 'trudge', 'matter', 'humorous', 'concept', 'rung', 'limits', 'see', 'minute', 'longer', 'what', 'appropriate.Even', 'plot', 'feels', 'monotonous', 'excessive', 'acting', 'uninspired', 'impression', 'corporate', 'heisting', 'over-your-head', 'nonsense', 'convoluted', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'analyzing', 'first', 'place', 'real', 'story', 'applies', 'duo', 'who', 'predictability', 'ones', 'characteristics', 'have', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'believe', 'Wahlberg', 'Ferrell', 'could', 'work', 'together', 'comedy', 'may', 'often', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'anything', 'conventional', 'when', 'Wahlberg', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'screen', 'together', 'when', 'film', 'sparkles', 'even', 'never', 'really', 'shines', 'joint', 'efforts', 'usually', 'make', 'work', 'genuine', 'commitment', 'admirable.In', 'fact', 'anything', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'recognizable', 'Mendes', 'Keaton', 'backseat', 'duo', 'Jackson', 'Johnson', 'are', 'responsible', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'entire', 'movie.Despite', 'Other', 'Guys', 'still', 'bruised', 'horse', 'tired', 'being', 'flogged', 'deservedly', 'so', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'significant', 'point', 'time', 'professions', 'McKay', 'Ferrell', 'reinvent', 'oneself', 'move', 'past', 'tradition', 'now', 'proven', 'be', 'obsolete', 'fall', 'pit', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'way']",N/A

Will Ferrell has not been this good since ""Old School"" and Mark Wahlberg was ever bit his comedic equal in this fantastic film.  From Samuel L.

Are you kidding me?  The two losers meander down to arrest him and fall into a very large case of fraud and an attempted robbery, of a very large nature.  I am trying very hard not to give away any of the punch lines in this film but admittedly it is difficult to write this review without doing so, since I was laughing the entire movie.  From driving the Prius into a bucket full of cocaine, all the way to being disgusted about the four homeless guys using it as a sex toy, I was laughing continually.Have I said yet it was too damn funny, and this is coming from the guy who only a few months ago said Will Ferrell was washed up.  Talk about eating your words.  Even Eva Mendes was fabulous as the homely housewife of Will Ferrell that Mark Wahlberg couldn't seem to stop ogling.With some movies you see all the laughs crammed into the two minute commercial and when you see the full length feature there is nothing left.  With this movie the commercial is only the tip of the iceberg.  The explosion scene was funny but trust me, if you liked the commercials, you will flat out love the movie.

Swanson,"[0, 0]","I loved Anchorman's goofiness, and am glad that The Other Guys almost measures up to it (and surpasses Step Brothers and Talledega Nights, McKay and Ferrell's other collaborations). There are a few typically stupid cop satire moments, but there are also many sharp and sly digs at modern Hollywood films in general that surpass the norm for this genre. Wahlberg works well by playing the straight man to Ferrell's dry wit here, and Keaton is a standout. But the real star is director/writer McKay's sense of humor in both roles; he knows cop movies inside out and works with their cliches nicely, getting laughs in places you might not expect. There are misses as well as hits, but far more of the latter.A couple of hilarious scenes had us cracking up over and over, especially the ""gator's b's better be usin' jimmies"" line. Will is still the best at those ironically weird moments, and McKay knows how to use him to the max. It feels like much of this was improv, so there's a nice fresh feeling throughout, which adds a lot of zing. Eva Mendes was perfect in her scene, another good comedic surprise.The blu-ray is excellent, with a good transfer but better yet many very fine extras, including two good gag reels and a""mom-mentary"" with the mothers of Will, Adam, and the other writer, Chris Henchy; it's quite funny...imagine your mom talking to the world about how hot The Rock is. And the unrated version has in this case truly edgy extras; use the marker feature to see how good some of the cut scenes were, and how blue. But the greatest and coolest surprise of this movie is the end scene about corporate conspiracy, and then the closing credits listing a bit of the litany of Goldman Sachs' brutal crimes against us all. I couldn't have been more amazed and impressed that McKay would use his platform to actually try to say something useful and true at the end of a Hollywood spoof. Well done, sir.I think this flick will age well, and it's somehow very good to know that everybody watching this in the future will be reminded how much GS has ripped this country off. It's a good thing McKay mentions it, because it's sure being kept as quiet as possible while none of those weasels does one day of jail time for the biggest financial crime in American history.

Sometimes he plays a button down guy as inStranger Than Fiction, who breaks out of his everyday character and finds true love in the process, and sometimes he is just an over the top alpha male as inTalladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Widescreen Edition)or a lovable jerk as in Anchor Man, and let's not forget the random acts of unnecessary nudity as in Old School.Mark Wahlberg appears to be getting better and better. Shooter is perhaps my favorite. In recent movies, I think he has vastly expanded his range as an actor. InThe Departed (Widescreen Edition)he was a typical alpha male police detective, yet inThe Lovely Boneshe offered a very delicately nuanced portrayal of a grieving father.When you put these two guys together on screen in this movie you have movie magic. Because The Other Guys manages to accomplish what other comedies do not, which is to be funny without even trying.A large part of the credit has to go not only to the actors, but also to the writers. In Gamble and Hoitz they play two cops who have fallen from grace and end up being partnered together.As you might expect we learn more about them as we go along. Hoitz hates Gamble, and has rage management issues, and occasionally goes off at Gamble over the fact that he just does not like him. Everything he does is annoying. A particularly funny bit is the Lion Tuna metaphor, which had me clutching my sides.The desk pop, faceback, meeting Gamble's hot wife played by Eva Mendez, channeling the inner pimp, the Prius, the coked up crime scene, wooden gun, every situation is hilarious, but also very well paced. We are allowed to recover a little before the next situation happens.Perhaps the revelation in this movie is Wahlberg, outside of his usual genre, showing how funny he can be, and Ferrell shows that he can be funny even playing a character who is an introvert who would sit behind the desk than hit the streets, funny without even trying.Both of these fallen cops accidentally stumble onto a major fraud, they get heat from above, they persist, deepening the fall from grace. We also have brief performances from Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Samuel L Jackson, and two words from Brooke Shields.Inevitably, perhaps one must compare with another recent cop comedy Cop Out. Let's just say that this movie is incomparably better, and about the best comedy I have seen in almost a year.

1312511,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B002ZG99H2,Luke Killion,"[6, 6]","""The Other Guys"" is the latest collaboration of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, who created other recent comedy classics such as Talledega Nights and Anchorman.  This movie has a great combination of insider police humor and current hot button issues in New York City, namely white collar crime. It crosses a few genres, equal parts buddy cop movie, with a comedic take on action flicks, as well as investigations of corporate corruption.  It is in the same vein as Kevin Smith's ""Copout"" which was also released in 2010 and follows the exploits of eccentric cops battling crime in New York.McKay directed and cowrote this movie, which really has some solid and intricate writing, which is counterbalanced by the antics of Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's characters, Terry Hoight and Allan Gamble. The opening scene is an obvious ribbing of cliche driven cop action flicks, played to perfection by the team of Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock, whose fate shows a touch of reality and provides a counterpoint to the duo of Ferrell and Wahlberg, whose identity is created as being known only for their mediocrity and incompetence, hence they are ""the other guys.""  Ferrell is an accountant desk cop, who is goaded into discharging his weapon in a ""desk pop"" in order to fit in with his coworkers. Even though he seems like the ""office geek,"" his development throughout the movie shows a hilariously dark past and an instant magnestism with women, which baffles Wahlberg's character, dubbed the ""Yankee Clipper,"" an action hungry self proclaimed ""peacock"", who is in the doghouse for accidentaly shooting a baseball player while on a ballpark security detail. They are relagated to being the butt of every joke from their fellow officers, yet when they stumble upon the malfeasance of a multi national coroporation, the odd couple take on the treachery of Wall Street's dark side. Given that this movie was filmed in 2009, just a year after the stock market crash and during the bailout controversy, McKay proves to be as socially conscious as he is hilarious.There is quite a cast in this movie, aside from the great preformance of Ferrell and Wahlberg. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife, who dumbfounds Wahlberg as to how Ferrell could marry a woman of her stature. Michael Keaton is the duo's captain, who trys to be lenient despite their bumbling, as he works a demeaning side job at Bed, Bath and Beyond to finance his son's NYU education, where he allegedly ""explores his bi-sexuality and DJing skills."" Rob Riggle, of Daily show fame (as well as the tazer cop in ""The Hangover"") teams up with Daymon Wayans to replace the recently fallen Jackson and Rock as the top dogs, who become the new self promoting glory hounds of the NYC media. Steve Coogan plays Ershon, the bunko businessman who's scams range from Nigeria to Chechnya, with a penchant for bribing with pairs of tickets to the Jersey Boys and Mama Mia and Ray Stevenson rounds out the cast as the neo-conservative security expert who plays the foil to the heroic other guys.  The undercover informant at the end also hints at a new case ""the other guys"" have a lead on; a sequel is likely in the offing.",5,"Hilarious version of ""brains and brawn"" NYPD partners",1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,3156,"['Other', 'Guys', 'latest', 'collaboration', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'who', 'created', 'other', 'recent', 'comedy', 'classics', 'such', 'Talledega', 'Nights', 'Anchorman', 'movie', 'great', 'combination', 'insider', 'police', 'humor', 'current', 'hot', 'button', 'issues', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'namely', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'few', 'genres', 'equal', 'parts', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'comedic', 'take', 'action', 'flicks', 'as', 'well', 'investigations', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'same', 'vein', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Copout', 'was', 'also', 'released', '2010', 'exploits', 'eccentric', 'cops', 'battling', 'crime', 'New', 'York.McKay', 'directed', 'cowrote', 'movie', 'really', 'solid', 'intricate', 'writing', 'counterbalanced', 'antics', 'Ferrell', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'characters', 'Terry', 'Hoight', 'Allan', 'Gamble', 'opening', 'scene', 'obvious', 'ribbing', 'cliche', 'driven', 'cop', 'action', 'flicks', 'played', 'perfection', 'team', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Rock', 'fate', 'touch', 'reality', 'counterpoint', 'duo', 'Ferrell', 'Wahlberg', 'identity', 'created', 'being', 'known', 'only', 'mediocrity', 'incompetence', 'hence', 'are', 'other', 'guys', 'Ferrell', 'accountant', 'desk', 'cop', 'who', 'goaded', 'discharging', 'weapon', 'desk', 'pop', 'order', 'fit', 'coworkers', 'Even', 'office', 'geek', 'development', 'movie', 'hilariously', 'dark', 'past', 'instant', 'magnestism', 'women', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'dubbed', 'Yankee', 'Clipper', 'action', 'hungry', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'peacock', 'who', 'doghouse', 'accidentaly', 'shooting', 'baseball', 'player', 'ballpark', 'security', 'detail', 'are', 'relagated', 'being', 'butt', 'joke', 'fellow', 'officers', 'yet', 'when', 'stumble', 'malfeasance', 'multi', 'national', 'coroporation', 'odd', 'couple', 'take', 'treachery', 'Wall', 'Street', 'dark', 'side', 'Given', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '2009', 'just', 'year', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'bailout', 'controversy', 'McKay', 'be', 'socially', 'conscious', 'hilarious.There', 'quite', 'cast', 'movie', 'aside', 'great', 'preformance', 'Ferrell', 'Wahlberg', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Ferrell', 'wife', 'who', 'Wahlberg', 'how', 'Ferrell', 'could', 'marry', 'woman', 'stature', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'duo', 'captain', 'who', 'trys', 'be', 'lenient', 'bumbling', 'demeaning', 'side', 'job', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'finance', 'son', 'NYU', 'education', 'where', 'allegedly', 'bi-sexuality', 'DJing', 'skills', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'Daily', 'show', 'fame', 'as', 'well', 'tazer', 'cop', 'Hangover', 'up', 'Daymon', 'Wayans', 'replace', 'recently', 'fallen', 'Jackson', 'Rock', 'top', 'dogs', 'who', 'become', 'new', 'self', 'promoting', 'glory', 'hounds', 'NYC', 'media', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Ershon', 'bunko', 'businessman', 'who', 'scams', 'range', 'Nigeria', 'Chechnya', 'penchant', 'bribing', 'pairs', 'tickets', 'Jersey', 'Boys', 'Mama', 'Mia', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'out', 'cast', 'neo-conservative', 'security', 'expert', 'who', 'foil', 'heroic', 'other', 'guys', 'undercover', 'informant', 'end', 'also', 'new', 'case', 'other', 'guys', 'have', 'lead', 'sequel', 'likely', 'offing']",N/A

1312516,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG99H2,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","A while back I wrote about a movie that I thought would end buddy cop movies forever. Yes, COP OUT was truly that bad. And this is coming from a fan of both Kevin Smith and Bruce Willis. But the buddy cop movie has been born again with two unlikely leads in Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. And they're bringing it to life as the anti-thesis of the buddy cop heroes by being THE OTHER GUYS.THE OTHER GUYS starts out like every other buddy cop film made in the past with two mega heroes in the forms of P.K. Highsmith (Samuel Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) chasing a car load of criminals. Suffice to say that they costs the city millions, do a ton of damage to vehicles and eventually blow up the front of one of the Trump Towers all in an attempt to arrest this carload for some minor offense. They're declared heroes and return to the precinct to let everyone know that they're leaving the paperwork for the rest of them to fill out...for the other guys.Allen Gamble (Ferrell) is fine with this. He's there to back up the page grabbing hero's crumbs and take care of the dirty work they leave behind. But his partner Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) isn't as pleased. He wants to take on the bad guys on the street. He was on the rise at one time, heading for the limelight when he accidentally shot...well I won't say because that ends up being on truly funny joke.Gamble and Hoitz are left behind to do paperwork and in a way not be much in the line of detectives; even if that's the area they're assigned to. That all changed when Highsmith and Danson jump off a building while trying to catch a group of crooks who used a zip line. Again, what happens is hilarious and I don't want to spoil it but it results in the heroes deaths.Now the city needs a new team of heroes and Hoitz wants it to be a part of that. But he can't stand his partner. Gamble has a lead on Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan), a businessman who has building construction going on but hasn't filed for permits for scaffolding. Neither of them realizes that in trying to serve the arrest warrant for this minor offense the two of them will find themselves taking on a top level criminal.Along the way they face opposition from their captain (Michael Keaton), the D.A. and various other law enforcement organizations. They even find their case turned over to the S.E.C. where their lead agent is Ershon's lawyer. Taken off the case and demoted to lower positions, the only way to get the bad guy is if they do it on their own terms.So much for the bare basics of the movie. Surrounding this plotline are all sorts of jokes that are some of the funniest I've seen in some time. Enough so that on occasion you find yourself using the pause button until you stop laughing or to back up and witness what made you laugh all over again.One running joke is that every hot woman that the duo comes across wants to jump Ferrell's bones. The first glimpse of this is when he takes Wahlberg home to meet ""the old ball and chain"". His wife is played by Eva Mendes, looking quite attractive and doing everything she can to please him while he tells Wahlberg how plain she is. All Whalberg can do is keep asking, ""No really, who is she?"" He can't believe this is Ferrell's wife. And the same holds true for every attractive woman they meet who tries to get Ferrell's number.Wahlberg's character is the stock shoot first and ask questions later kind of guy. In his mind every criminal ties into some drug deal. Ferrell is the more cerebral one who looks for deeper crimes which seem to stare him in the face and he still doesn't get. They make the perfect pair, combining to make a winning team. Or at least you would think they would. Instead they more bumble into the crime being committed and are fortunate to simply survive.There are all sorts of comedy at play here. The verbal jokes are funny, the physical humor is hilarious and the stabs at the standard buddy cop films are spot on. I've never been a huge fan of Ferrell feeling that he got too caught up in playing the seemingly same character over and over again. But this is one time that he shines in a role meant for him. And Whalberg with his demands to be let lose to fly like a peacock and constant referencing to things he learned as a child to use to bully the kid down the block is funny in his own way.I wasn't sure I would like this movie. I was afraid that it was going to turn out like most movies with a decent trailer where the best scenes were offered there with tons of filler surrounding them. That doesn't turn out to be true. Sure those scenes are funny, but the entire film has funny scenes from beginning to end. This movie is not just a movie to watch a single time but to add to your collection. Its one that I know I'll end up watching more than once.",4,BUDDY COP MOVIES RESURRECTED!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,4812,"['while', 'back', 'wrote', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movies', 'forever', 'Yes', 'COP', 'OUT', 'was', 'truly', 'bad', 'coming', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'been', 'born', 'again', 'two', 'unlikely', 'leads', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', ""'re"", 'bringing', 'life', 'anti-thesis', 'buddy', 'cop', 'heroes', 'being', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'GUYS.THE', 'OTHER', 'GUYS', 'out', 'other', 'buddy', 'cop', 'film', 'made', 'past', 'two', 'mega', 'heroes', 'forms', 'P.K', 'Highsmith', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Christopher', 'Danson', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'chasing', 'car', 'load', 'criminals', 'Suffice', 'say', 'costs', 'city', 'millions', 'do', 'ton', 'damage', 'vehicles', 'eventually', 'blow', 'up', 'front', 'one', 'Trump', 'Towers', 'all', 'attempt', 'arrest', 'carload', 'minor', 'offense', ""'re"", 'declared', 'heroes', 'return', 'precinct', 'let', 'everyone', 'know', ""'re"", 'leaving', 'paperwork', 'rest', 'fill', 'out', 'other', 'guys.Allen', 'Gamble', 'Ferrell', 'fine', 'there', 'back', 'up', 'page', 'grabbing', 'hero', 'crumbs', 'take', 'care', 'dirty', 'work', 'leave', 'partner', 'Terry', 'Hoitz', 'Wahlberg', ""n't"", 'as', 'pleased', 'take', 'bad', 'guys', 'street', 'was', 'rise', 'one', 'time', 'heading', 'limelight', 'when', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'up', 'being', 'truly', 'funny', 'joke.Gamble', 'Hoitz', 'are', 'left', 'do', 'paperwork', 'way', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'line', 'detectives', 'even', 'area', ""'re"", 'assigned', 'changed', 'when', 'Highsmith', 'Danson', 'jump', 'off', 'building', 'trying', 'catch', 'group', 'crooks', 'who', 'used', 'zip', 'line', 'Again', 'what', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'results', 'heroes', 'deaths.Now', 'city', 'new', 'team', 'heroes', 'Hoitz', 'be', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'partner', 'Gamble', 'lead', 'Sir', 'David', 'Ershon', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'businessman', 'who', 'building', 'construction', 'going', ""n't"", 'filed', 'permits', 'scaffolding', 'trying', 'serve', 'arrest', 'warrant', 'minor', 'two', 'will', 'find', 'taking', 'top', 'level', 'criminal.Along', 'way', 'face', 'opposition', 'captain', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'D.A', 'various', 'other', 'law', 'enforcement', 'organizations', 'even', 'find', 'case', 'turned', 'S.E.C', 'where', 'lead', 'agent', 'Ershon', 'lawyer', 'Taken', 'off', 'case', 'demoted', 'lower', 'positions', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'bad', 'guy', 'do', 'own', 'terms.So', 'much', 'bare', 'basics', 'movie', 'Surrounding', 'plotline', 'are', 'sorts', 'jokes', 'are', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'Enough', 'occasion', 'find', 'using', 'pause', 'button', 'stop', 'laughing', 'back', 'up', 'witness', 'what', 'made', 'again.One', 'running', 'joke', 'hot', 'woman', 'duo', 'jump', 'Ferrell', 'bones', 'first', 'glimpse', 'when', 'Wahlberg', 'home', 'meet', 'old', 'ball', 'chain', 'wife', 'played', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'looking', 'quite', 'attractive', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'please', 'Wahlberg', 'how', 'plain', 'Whalberg', 'can', 'do', 'keep', 'asking', 'really', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ferrell', 'wife', 'same', 'true', 'attractive', 'woman', 'meet', 'who', 'get', 'Ferrell', 'number.Wahlberg', 'character', 'stock', 'shoot', 'first', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'kind', 'guy', 'mind', 'criminal', 'ties', 'drug', 'deal', 'Ferrell', 'more', 'cerebral', 'one', 'who', 'deeper', 'crimes', 'seem', 'stare', 'face', 'still', ""n't"", 'get', 'make', 'perfect', 'pair', 'combining', 'make', 'winning', 'team', 'least', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'Instead', 'more', 'bumble', 'crime', 'being', 'committed', 'are', 'fortunate', 'simply', 'survive.There', 'are', 'sorts', 'comedy', 'play', 'here', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'physical', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'stabs', 'standard', 'buddy', 'cop', 'films', 'are', 'spot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ferrell', 'feeling', 'got', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'playing', 'seemingly', 'same', 'character', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'time', 'role', 'meant', 'Whalberg', 'demands', 'be', 'let', 'lose', 'fly', 'peacock', 'constant', 'referencing', 'things', 'learned', 'child', 'use', 'bully', 'kid', 'down', 'block', 'funny', 'own', 'way.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'most', 'movies', 'decent', 'trailer', 'where', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'offered', 'there', 'tons', 'filler', 'surrounding', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'Sure', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'entire', 'film', 'funny', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'watch', 'single', 'time', 'add', 'collection', 'one', 'know', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 5]","Watching THE OTHER GUYS, I was reminded of a story told to me many years ago by legendary screenwriter John Lee Mahin:He had just finished writing the script for MOGAMBO (1953), the African adventure movie that starred Clark Gable and Ava Gardner.Gable approached him one day and he was angry,  ""You son-of-a-bitch,"" he said.  ""You've given Ava all of the funny lines.""""That's right,"" Mahin replied, ""but the audience isn't going to laugh until they see your reaction.""That's one of the basic rules of comedy.There always has to be a straight man.Would Lou Costello have been funny without Bud Abbott?Would Jerry Lewis have gotten all those laughs without Dean Martin (or somebody like him) to play off of?That's the problem with THE OTHER GUYS.Almost everybody in it wants to be the comic, even the actors who usually play more serious roles (e.g. Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg).  Nobody is doing the Bud Abbott or Dean Martin part, and the result is that most of the attempted humor just lies there.  It's simply not funny.The basic story premise, which is actually pretty good, centers on a pair of misfit NYPD detectives (Will Ferrell and Wahlberg), sentenced to life behind a desk, who stumble onto what might be the ""crime of the century"".  In their own inept ways, they attempt to solve it.In all fairness, there are some very funny moments in this movie, such as the scene in which Ferrell and Wahlberg play ""bad cop and badder cop"" or when Ferrell sends messages to his wife (Eva Mendes) through her mother.  Unfortunately, these scenes are few and far between.Ferrell is, without doubt, a skillful comic performer, but there is little chemistry between him and the film's other actors, and so much of the movie, particularly the action sequences, is so far over-the-top that it just comes off as stupid, not even amusing.Perhaps the underlying problem with this picture is that writer (with Chris Henchy)-director Adam McKay was never sure what kind of comedy he wanted to make.  At times, it seems like he was trying for another AIRPLANE, while at other moments the picture looks like a misguided effort to do an action/comedy ""buddy"" movie (e.g. 48 HOURS).That's another rule of comedy.  Pick your style and stick with it.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains both the theatrical and an extended version of the movie, as well as a couple of ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes.

Will Ferrell plays Gamble, a dedicated, nerdy investigator who has been partnered with the disgraced Detective Hoitz (played by the surprisingly funny Mark Wahlberg) who ruined the World Series by shooting baseball giant, Derek Jeter. Because they are the laughing stock of the Department, each sets out to change his fate by doing something bold and fabulous. Gamble is on the trail of a Wall Street con artist who didn't keep up with his permit licenses, and Hoitz just wants to catch a bad guy and prove that he can do good police work. Using a Toyota Prius as their official police vehicle, they set out to solve a somewhat convoluted crime (ponzi type scheme which would eventually devastate the police pension fund) and we are witness to some of the funniest scenes in the movie. Gamble's eventual flashbacks on his own ""life of crime"" (he was a pimp in college), as well as Hoitz's reaction to Gamble's beautiful wife(played by Eva Mendes) will have you in stitches. I think some of the most overlooked stars of the movie (probably because they don't last long) were Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel Jackson. I could not stop laughing when they jumped off a roof yelling ""aim for the bushes"", believing themselves to be indestructible or invincible. It was priceless. And not to be overlooked is the surprisingly funny Michael Keaton, who does a wonderful job playing the hard working, tough Police Captain who moonlights at the local Bed, Bath & Beyond. In conclusion, there are so many things that made this movie enjoyable, from the wonderful cast to the decent storyline. Most of all, it offers moments of pure fun.

1312526,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B002ZG99H2,Mike,"[1, 3]","Synopsis:  Detective Terry Hoitz (played by Mark Wahlberg) is an angry, yet not necessarily sharp, detective who is assigned to desk duty after accidentally shooting Derek Jeter (himself) at the World Series.  He's partnered up with Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) who is a bookworm/improbable ladies man that would rather work behind a desk than get into the action.  Both of whom respect high-powered detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are respectively at the top of their game.  After Danson and Highsmith end up jumping to their deaths during a bank robbery, this opens up the opportunity for the ""other guys"" to step up and become the next big pair of detectives.  Though other tandems are taking over the cases that many consider to be tougher and higher priority, Hoitz and Gamble end up uncovering a plot by businessman David Ershon (Steve Coogan) to steal millions in order to cover his company's losses.  Will Hoitz learn to calm it down a bit in order to be effective? Will Gamble grow a pair?  Will ""the other guys"" be able to unfoil the plot or be unfoiled as police heroes while trying?  Michael Keaton appears as Gene Mauch the hard-nosed captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath, and Beyond while often quoting TLC lyrics.Keaton was the largest reason while I enjoyed this film because I wasn't expecting him to be as laugh-out-loud funny as he was.  As for the others, Wahlberg's an action guy with a chip on his shoulder, Ferrel's a bumbling pseudo-nerd, and both Jackson and The Rock are hard-nosed and abrasive.  In short, there's really no surprises here; most everyone else is typecast in the types of roles they're known for and this film's no different.  It wasn't bad, just not something that knocked me off my socks.  Keaton's performance makes it a decent rental; fans of action-comedies or humor in the Will Ferrell variety will probably like it enough to purchase.",3,Good But Not Necessarily Memorable,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,1933,"['Synopsis', 'Detective', 'Terry', 'Hoitz', 'played', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'angry', 'yet', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sharp', 'detective', 'who', 'assigned', 'desk', 'duty', 'accidentally', 'shooting', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'World', 'Series', 'partnered', 'up', 'Detective', 'Allen', 'Gamble', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'bookworm/improbable', 'ladies', 'man', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'desk', 'get', 'action', 'whom', 'respect', 'high-powered', 'detectives', 'Danson', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Highsmith', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'are', 'respectively', 'top', 'game', 'Danson', 'Highsmith', 'end', 'up', 'jumping', 'deaths', 'bank', 'robbery', 'up', 'opportunity', 'other', 'guys', 'step', 'up', 'become', 'next', 'big', 'pair', 'detectives', 'other', 'tandems', 'are', 'taking', 'cases', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'tougher', 'higher', 'priority', 'Hoitz', 'Gamble', 'end', 'up', 'uncovering', 'plot', 'businessman', 'David', 'Ershon', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'steal', 'millions', 'order', 'cover', 'company', 'losses', 'Will', 'Hoitz', 'learn', 'calm', 'down', 'bit', 'order', 'be', 'effective', 'Will', 'Gamble', 'grow', 'pair', 'Will', 'other', 'guys', 'be', 'able', 'unfoil', 'plot', 'be', 'unfoiled', 'police', 'heroes', 'trying', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Gene', 'Mauch', 'hard-nosed', 'captain', 'who', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'often', 'quoting', 'TLC', 'lyrics.Keaton', 'was', 'largest', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'was', 'others', 'Wahlberg', 'action', 'guy', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'Ferrel', 'bumbling', 'pseudo-nerd', 'Jackson', 'Rock', 'are', 'hard-nosed', 'abrasive', 'short', 'really', 'surprises', 'here', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'typecast', 'types', 'roles', ""'re"", 'known', 'film', 'different', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'something', 'knocked', 'off', 'socks', 'Keaton', 'performance', 'decent', 'rental', 'fans', 'action-comedies', 'humor', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'variety', 'will', 'probably', 'enough', 'purchase']",N/A

Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play NYPD Partners who are opposites in every sense, Will's character is just an accountent who is looking to stay out of trouble with a very mundane look at life while Mark's character is the overassuming overexaggerated cop whos looking to make a name for himself. I was a little skepticle of this film mainly because the other lead role is Mark Wahlberg and he doesn't normally do comedy films, as a matter of fact this is his comedy debut in hollywood. I am very familiar with Will Ferrell's work (Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers) usually his comedy is more or less the same everytime but it is very hilarious either way. I have to say that Mark Wahlberg was HILARIOUS in this movie, and I'm sorry I ever doubted this man because he really does have the comedic chops, his comedy style is more like an agravatted boy and theres nothing more hilarious than to see a grown man act like a child and Mark Wahlberg pulls it off very well. The Star cast is also joined by the action junkies such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and veteran Samuel L. Jackson who play the big time cops in the beginnning of the film but later meet their doom. The jokes in this film are funny more or less whether it is Mark Wahlbergs assumption of druglords after him and girlfriend cheating on him with strangers or Will Ferrel's random outburst this film is just a delight from beginning to end. Although I love all the actors in this film there is one actor that is truly the funniest in this film and I have to give it to Mr. Michael Keaton (The Original Batman) his humor in this film in drop dead hilarious and I enjoyed every bit of time he had in this film, possibly the funniest character in the movie.

1312552,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG99H2,RMurray847,"[6, 10]","I don't think I'm saying anything terribly controversial or original when I state that Will Farrell movies tend to be a mixed bag.  His most beloved star vehicles TALLEDEGA NIGHTS and ANCHORMAN, feature many truly hilarious moments, but also moments that just seem a bit weird and random.  Farrell and his friend/co-writer/director Adam McKay just can't seem to stop taking diversions that are little more than whims.  Sometimes these random moments have a life and excitement of their own (Ron Burgundy playing the flute in a restaurant), others are simply head-scratchers.It's a measure of how expensive THE OTHER GUYS must have been to make when I thought of how few of these quirky diversions Farrell takes.  McKay & Co. have made a more straightforward comedy, one relying heavily on expensive action sequences...and thus must have felt a bit more constrained to sticking with a linear plot and not a series of sketches held together with a theme.But it's also a measure of Farrell's talent that the film still feels fresh and offbeat.  Farrell plays a police detective who is really just an accountant with a badge and gun.  He works his desk and hums while typing on his keyboard.  He loves to see others running to where the action is...and loves staying safely at his desk.  He'd probably be happy doing this his entire career, except that he's also got a VERY reluctant partner (Mark Wahlberg)...a once up-and-coming hotshot cop who accidentally put a bullet into Derek Jeter, costing the Yankees a World Series.  Wahlberg urgently wants to get back on the streets...and when NYPD loses two of its most famous cops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson)...his desperate need reaches a boiling point, and he DRAGS Farrell out into the field.  Unfortunately, Farrell's vehicle is a Prius, and it's very non-threatening profile generates some pretty funny wisecracks.  (""I literally feel like I'm riding inside a vagina,"" says Wahlberg.)It is very amusing to see Wahlberg making fun of his usual intensity.  Imagine his character in THE DEPARTED almost totally neutered by a career blunder.  He's got good timing, and creates genuine chemistry with Farrell.  Eva Mendes is welcome as Farrell's wife...she's WAY too hot to be married to Farrell, yet Farrell's character seems to draw hot women to him.  It's so non-sensical as to be quite funny...particularly in the way it perplexes Wahlberg.  Mendes, in many films, consistently shows flashes of having some nice comic ability, but has yet to be truly challenged.  THE OTHER GUYS doesn't challenge her either...her character is more of a device than a real person.There are other nice supporting turns.  Steve Coogan is always nice to see.  Michael Keaton has a thankless role as the captain...but still gets off a few nice one-liners.  Jackson & Johnson are hilarious (and their early scenes spoofing car chases and the mayhem they cause are pretty impressive).  I must say, though, that I'd gladly never see Rob Riggle in a film again.  Here and in THE HANGOVER, he plays obnoxious, toxic cops to virtually no comic effect.  He's loud and amused with himself.But the film belongs to Farrell.  He once again brings his character who is outwardly calm but clearly seething with repressed emotions.  But Farrell has dug just a little bit deeper here.  He's tried to bring logic to his character, rather than simply serving comic needs.  The turmoil he is roiling with seems genuine.  I gather from interviews and such that Farrell is a fairly happy family man.  But he also encapsulates what a lot of people feel, I think..the feeling of being trapped in a life that isn't entirely what one imagined when setting out in the world.  He carries an inchoate rage.  In Farrell's hands, this is mined for humor...but you can also imagine how quickly it could be mined for drama.  He's a master at teetering between out-of-control and dangerously out-of-control.There are a couple of Farrell & McKay's patented ""random"" moments.  While drinking with Wahlberg in an Irish pub, Farrell frequently stops mid-conversation to sing verses in sad Irish songs while accompanied by an older chorus of Irish men.  It's odd but somehow charming.  But the film has many sustained jokes that continue to pay off.  Coogan (as a Wall Street bad-guy) keeps putting off tough questioning by offering Farrell & Wahlberg tickets to Broadway shows.  They accept and then beat themselves up later when they realize they've been bribed.I laughed a lot.  That's ultimately they key to my recommendation.  But I certainly appreciate the fact that the filmmakers realized they had a good concept and gave it some meat.  Farrell was allowed to create a fully realized comic creation, and was given a stellar supporting cast.  Wahlberg was probably the best possible choice to play the partner...and although I hope it doesn't happen I can certainly envision a sequel.",4,Solid laughs and a more credible than usual Will

1312554,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG99H2,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","""The Other Guys"" starts off as just another cop-buddy movie  but, about a third of the way in, it suddenly finds its mojo and turns into a clever, frequently hilarious send-up of not only police procedurals but the whole corporate and bank bailout outrages of the past several years.The mismatched big-city detectives are played by Will Ferrall and Mark Wahlberg, the former a forensic accountant named Allen Gamble who prefers crushing numbers at his desk to crushing criminals on the streets, and the latter, a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy hothead named Terry Hoitz, who's been busted down to an office clerk for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter at the ballpark, and who`s chomping at the bit to get back to doing what he does best.  Together, Allen and Terry mount an investigation into  a billionaire (Steve Coogan) who's become the target of a corporate client (Anne Heche) to whom he owes a great deal of money.""The Other Guys"" could easily have been just another big-budget throwaway filled with lame comic set-ups and even lamer jokes.  Instead, screenwriters Chris Henchy and Adam McCay (who also directed the film) have come up with a manic mixture of goofiness and near-surrealism that they have refined into a tasty comic brew.  Most of the dialogue is sharp and witty, and the situations stop just short of all-out theater-of-the-absurd.Much of the success of the film can be attributed to the wonderful performances by the two leads, whose decidedly different acting styles complement one another so completely.  Wahlberg's deadpan, ""straight-man"" restraint provides a perfect foil for Ferrall's more over-the-top comic outrageousness, and part of the joy lies in watching these two old pros find their rhythm and go with it.  There's also a goodly number of ""name"" players in the supporting cast, including Eva Mendes as Allen's ultra-supportive ""plain"" wife, Sheila; Michael Keaton as the police captain who moonlights as a manager at Bed Bath & Beyond; Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. as a pair of hyperkinetic, shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later cops (their brief scene at an elementary school career day is itself worth the price of admission); and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson in cameo roles as a pair of super-charged, risk-taking detectives who take the phrase ""let's hit the pavement"" to a whole new, fatally literal level.  And all are excellent.There's not much point in trying to look too deeply into ""The Other Guys.""  Just sit back and enjoy watching big-budget Hollywood filmmakers get one right for a change.",4,High-spirited and amusing cop-buddy romp,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2559,"['Other', 'Guys', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'cop-buddy', 'movie', 'about', 'third', 'way', 'suddenly', 'mojo', 'clever', 'frequently', 'hilarious', 'send-up', 'not', 'only', 'police', 'procedurals', 'whole', 'corporate', 'bank', 'bailout', 'outrages', 'past', 'several', 'years.The', 'mismatched', 'big-city', 'detectives', 'are', 'played', 'Will', 'Ferrall', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'former', 'forensic', 'accountant', 'named', 'Allen', 'Gamble', 'who', 'crushing', 'numbers', 'desk', 'crushing', 'criminals', 'streets', 'latter', 'stereotypically', 'gung-ho', 'trigger-happy', 'hothead', 'named', 'Terry', 'Hoitz', 'who', 'been', 'busted', 'down', 'office', 'clerk', 'accidentally', 'shooting', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'ballpark', 'who', 's', 'chomping', 'bit', 'get', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'Together', 'Allen', 'Terry', 'mount', 'investigation', 'billionaire', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'who', 'become', 'target', 'corporate', 'client', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'whom', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'Other', 'Guys', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'big-budget', 'throwaway', 'filled', 'lame', 'comic', 'set-ups', 'even', 'lamer', 'jokes', 'Instead', 'screenwriters', 'Chris', 'Henchy', 'Adam', 'McCay', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'manic', 'mixture', 'goofiness', 'near-surrealism', 'have', 'refined', 'tasty', 'comic', 'brew', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'witty', 'situations', 'stop', 'just', 'short', 'all-out', 'theater-of-the-absurd.Much', 'success', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'decidedly', 'different', 'acting', 'styles', 'complement', 'one', 'so', 'completely', 'Wahlberg', 'deadpan', 'straight-man', 'restraint', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Ferrall', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'comic', 'outrageousness', 'part', 'joy', 'watching', 'two', 'old', 'pros', 'find', 'rhythm', 'go', 'also', 'goodly', 'number', 'name', 'players', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Allen', 'ultra-supportive', 'plain', 'wife', 'Sheila', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'police', 'captain', 'who', 'manager', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Jr.', 'pair', 'hyperkinetic', 'shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later', 'cops', 'brief', 'scene', 'elementary', 'school', 'career', 'day', 'price', 'admission', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'cameo', 'roles', 'pair', 'super-charged', 'risk-taking', 'detectives', 'who', 'take', 'phrase', 'let', 'hit', 'pavement', 'whole', 'new', 'fatally', 'literal', 'level', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'trying', 'look', 'too', 'deeply', 'Other', 'Guys', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'one', 'right', 'change']",N/A

1312559,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B002ZG99H2,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","For me this movie was non-stop laughs from beginning to end.  Starting out with the Kings of the NYPD; Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson in the midst of some real action.  Their parts in this film are short lived though, and the department must move on without them.  This after their rather comical exit...Enter Gamble (Will Ferrell), and his 'angry about everything' partner, Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), at their desk job. You may think at the beginning, that Ferrell will be a one dimensional character, similar to his previous roles, although I saw more in this movie.  Ferrell switches-up all over the place so that you really never know what will come out of him next as he is his old brilliant self in this department.  After all, isn't that what we loved Ferrell for in Saturday Night Live? That's what he reminds me of here.The cast is standout hilarious as a whole. Of Wahlberg, for instance, I have never seen him play a role as he does here. He's refreshingly daring in an action role filled with comedic timing.  He's downright funny in this, with his sparking anger issues as Hoitz.  He and Ferrell play off each other so well that you would think they have been acting together for years; his explosive personality just keeps adding to the fun.  There are so many funny lines between these two that I would get writer's cramp just attempting to list only some of them.Give a listen to all the music lyrics and song title references that go between Ferrell and the quite excellently cast Michael Keaton, as they speak in a sort of code.  He is absolutely wonderful as the Captain of the department.  Gamble continually slips-up and calls him, ""Gene"" - his first name.  Keaton could be explored a bit more although what he does add to the movie (with his mannerisms and quick wit as always) is perfect in itself.  Take a good look at the special features if you do own the DVD.  What Keaton does in his spare time is left to his own improvisation.  The director, Adam McKay, just lets him go completely 'Michael Keaton'.  Fans of his will know what that's all about.The very lovely and quick-witted, Eva Mendes, rounds off the cast as Sheila (Gamble's ""plain wife"").  While Hoitz is over for dinner at their home, he cannot stop repeatedly asking,  ""Who is that?""  Hoitz can't get her off of his own mind throughout the movie.  Gamble remains empty-headed and unaware of his wife's attractiveness while it is blatantly obvious.This is not only a Will Ferrell movie by design, it's supported by a truly amazing and engaging cast in some laugh out loud roles and scenarios.  Together they add in sarcastically overboard comedy and 'out to lunch' action everywhere.  Each actor plays off of the others and makes this a truly funny picture that you won't want to miss.  There won't be a fan of any of these actors that will be disappointed with ""The Other Guys"".",4,Welcome Back Will Ferrell Of The SNL Days!,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2869,"['movie', 'was', 'non-stop', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'end', 'Starting', 'out', 'Kings', 'NYPD', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'midst', 'real', 'action', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'short', 'lived', 'department', 'must', 'move', 'rather', 'comical', 'exit', 'Enter', 'Gamble', 'Will', 'Ferrell', ""'angry"", 'everything', 'partner', 'Hoitz', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'desk', 'job', 'may', 'think', 'beginning', 'Ferrell', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'similar', 'previous', 'roles', 'saw', 'more', 'movie', 'Ferrell', 'switches-up', 'place', 'so', 'really', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'next', 'old', 'brilliant', 'self', 'department', ""n't"", 'what', 'loved', 'Ferrell', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'what', 'here.The', 'cast', 'standout', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'Wahlberg', 'instance', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'role', 'here', 'refreshingly', 'daring', 'action', 'role', 'filled', 'comedic', 'timing', 'downright', 'funny', 'sparking', 'anger', 'issues', 'Hoitz', 'Ferrell', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'would', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'acting', 'together', 'years', 'explosive', 'personality', 'just', 'adding', 'fun', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'lines', 'two', 'would', 'get', 'writer', 'cramp', 'just', 'attempting', 'list', 'only', 'them.Give', 'listen', 'music', 'lyrics', 'song', 'title', 'references', 'go', 'Ferrell', 'quite', 'excellently', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'speak', 'sort', 'code', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Captain', 'department', 'Gamble', 'continually', 'slips-up', 'Gene', 'first', 'name', 'Keaton', 'could', 'be', 'explored', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'add', 'movie', 'mannerisms', 'quick', 'wit', 'always', 'perfect', 'Take', 'good', 'look', 'special', 'features', 'do', 'own', 'DVD', 'What', 'Keaton', 'spare', 'time', 'left', 'own', 'improvisation', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'just', 'go', 'completely', ""'Michael"", 'Keaton', 'Fans', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'about.The', 'very', 'lovely', 'quick-witted', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'cast', 'Sheila', 'Gamble', 'plain', 'wife', 'Hoitz', 'dinner', 'home', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'repeatedly', 'asking', 'Who', 'Hoitz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'own', 'mind', 'movie', 'Gamble', 'empty-headed', 'unaware', 'wife', 'attractiveness', 'blatantly', 'obvious.This', 'not', 'only', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'design', 'supported', 'truly', 'amazing', 'engaging', 'cast', 'laugh', 'loud', 'roles', 'scenarios', 'Together', 'add', 'sarcastically', 'overboard', 'comedy', ""'out"", 'lunch', 'action', 'everywhere', 'actor', 'others', 'truly', 'funny', 'picture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fan', 'actors', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Other', 'Guys']",N/A

There was much more action than I expected. Pretty much every single character has their own comedic quirks to them. Will Ferrell plays his usual ""not-all-there"" character but with the twist that his character actually has his very smart moments. And for someone as serious as Wahlberg's character, I was surprised by how many times he made mistakes as well. There is only one scene that I found that truly did not make sense *SPOILER ALERT* and that was the fight between Sheila and Allen. It went from a loving moment of song to ""let's make love"" ""You have to let me be"" ""I'm pregnant"" ""Gator's b* better be using jimmies"" ""Get Out!""Why Allen had his freak-out moment made no sense and neither did Sheila's sudden confession of being pregnant.In any case I can understand this movie getting 3 star ratings but I really don't think it deserves a 1-2. It has stars who know how to act, humor, action, discusses ""white collar crime"" instead of the usual drug cartel premise. Does it overuse CGI and explosions? Yes. Does the comedy miss sometimes?

1312564,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B002ZG99H2,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`The Other Guys' is a pretty decent comedy film that follows the tired and tested police buddy movie format.Will Ferrell joins Mark Wahlberg as they attempt to bring an unscrupulous Ponzi investor to justice. But to be honest the storyline takes a backseat to the comedy interaction between Ferrell and Wahlberg who are both genuinely funny and made me chuckle out loud at numerous points. If you have seen other Ferrell films with his slightly offbeat, random comedy then you know what to expect. Saying that, this doesn't maintain that level of quirkiness the whole way though, like other films of his (Talladega Heights springs to mind), but it does come back to the more outlandish humour at regular intervals.To be honest the story is pretty weak and formulaic, but you don't really notice this as you watch the film. You are so engrossed in the lines and back and forth between the characters that you don't pick this film apart too much and if you take it on face value as the light hearted comedy it is, you should enjoy this just fine.

I don't know what it is about Will Ferrell, but even though his films do good business at the box office and get generally good reviews, he still seems to be somewhat underrated.  ""Talladega Night"", ""Step Brothers"" and this one are three of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but they never seem to be elevated to ""classic"" status like a ""Caddyshack"" or an ""Animal House"", a league in which I think all three films truly belong.Of the three, this one is the weakest, but only because at times it seems to try too hard.  And it also drags on a bit long, even in the theatrical version.  Wahlberg (who should've been nominated for an Academy Award in ""The Fighter"" like most of his co-stars were) clearly can't do comedy very well, and his role probably should've been totally straight instead of hamming it up with unnecessary B-story lines about his artsy ex-girlfriend and his lust for Ferrell's wife (played by the smoking hot Eva Mendes, whose smoking hotness is the whole joke).  But that's not to say he's totally miscast for this movie, just that the part should've just continued to play up his tough guy uptightness instead of making him a third-rate goofball where he's got no chance against Ferrell.Other than that, it's just wall-to-wall laughs, played for absurdity and maximum humor, with a supreme supporting cast.  In addition to Mendez, you get the hilarious Michael Keaton in what I hope is a big comeback for him after many years of obscurity, Rob Riggle in another tour de force performance not unlike his role in ""Step Brothers"", and Dwayne Johnson & Samuel L. Jackson as two over-the-top arrogant cops whose roles are far too brief (again though...that's basically part of the joke).Not to sound hackneyed, but if you liked ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"", you'll like this one too.

It looked funny but i had hoped they didn't do that usual, show all the funny moments in the commercial deal as they usually do. Well sadly what you saw in the previews is what you see in the movie, but that doesnt really ruin them when you see the film. Ferrell and Walhberg have an excellent chemistry and they mesh well together as two loser cops trying to find there niche' after the parting of two super-hero cops, played by Samuel L Jackson, and The Rock. Thats about as depth as the story gets except for a man they are hunting down about scafeling permits, but i won't really comment on that as to not give to much away.The movie finds itself in the usual mid range humor, to the more crude and hateful humor that you see in these types of film. It plays out a lot like a Naked Gun film with some of the initial silliness, but doesnt take it quite as far. Most of the jokes are clever, and cunning with a lot of well played out action sequences, which is rare for a comedy such as this. Explosions, car chases, and lots of shooting make this a comical Lethal Weapon of sorts and some of the over the top stunts give a big nod to those type of films. The language i thought was a bit over the top which could have gotten it an R rating to be honest, except for dropping the F-bomb once or twice which was unheard. But it was still enjoyable none the less. So if you want a little above the run of the mill buddy cop comedy film then this is for you. Stay away from a movie like Cop Out, its about as horrible as you can get. Also i would like to give a big thumbs up to Micheal Keaton for some very funny moments as the Police Captain, welcome back!!Its nothing special but the other guys delivers some laughs in a well needed action type comedy, sure to please 70% of audiences.
