925944,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000ACPALW,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The transfer is middling to poor quality, there's a pesky RE logo present throughout that's annoying.This film is mainly for Rosalind Russell fans (it's the only reason I bought it).  The comedy is all over the place.  The story involves an overage spoiled rich `girl' (Russell), who wants her father (a senator) to get her a commission as an officer in the army so she can fly to Paris on the government's dime to be with her boyfriend Lt. Col. Schuyler (Sky) Fairchild.  She's not picky; she could easily see herself as a general.  Her father though, tricks her into joining the army as a private.  During basic training, she meets up with her ex-husband (Paul Douglas).  The result is pretty predictable.  And although Russell can toss barbs like no one else, she's easily undone by scene stealer Marie Wilson as Clara Schneiderman, alias Danger O'Dowd (a model......of sorts).  Favorite scene has Russell going through the physical exam, smoking, while being told to inhale and exhale.This is a cute film, hardly a classic.  But I enjoyed watching it and don't mind adding it to my collection.",4,"""Any insanity in your family?""

The only glaring hole in the film--and it IS glaring---is the casting of PAUL DOUGLAS---as a romantic lead???? Ugh!!! Daffy Duck would have played the lead better in looks and in personality!!

A fun movie, I really enjoyed this film. While some of the actors seemed a little wooden, this was because many of them were actual WACs assigned to Fort Lee at the time. Some of the scenes with the WACs going through ""environment trials"" for uniforms are especially hilarious! It's also notable for General Omar Bradley's brief appearance.",3,A great film about the Women's Army Corps,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,440,"['stuck-up', 'self-centered', 'socialite', 'decides', 'become', 'WAC', 'officer', 'predictable', 'results', 'fun', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'actors', 'seemed', 'little', 'wooden', 'was', 'because', 'many', 'were', 'actual', 'WACs', 'assigned', 'Fort', 'Lee', 'time', 'scenes', 'WACs', 'going', 'environment', 'trials', 'uniforms', 'are', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'also', 'notable', 'General', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'brief', 'appearance']",Rosalind Russell: Double Feature #1

Her father talked her into joining the WAC so she can go with him. She joined thinking she was going to become an officer.Scenes included real WACs at Fort Lee marching to briefings, in classes, parades, being issued clothing and getting their shots, as was the 14th WAC band.When her ex-husband, working for the Quartermaster Corps creating and testing new uniforms and equipment, spots his ex-wife in uniform he requests that she be assigned to his project. One scene the women were dressed in arctic uniforms and placed in a controlled environment with -20 degrees and wind like a blizzard. Another day they were testing wet weather outfits.This romantic comedy brought back many memories and chuckles of my own Basic Training and my time spent at Fort Lee.
