""Victorian & Albert"" has gorgeous sets and costumes, but I really wish they'd given the actors some lessons in period movement.  In particular the one who played Queen Victoria.  The real queen never had a tiny waist, hollow cheekbones, and prominent shoulder blades--even at 18.  But at least it's understandable that the producers wanted her to conform to a modern ideal of beauty.  The actress's movements, however, are atrocious-and she's never still.  She has a heavy (audible!) tramping walk, she wriggles her arms, she hunches and shrugs her shoulders, she has a million little pouts and grimaces.  And on top of it all there's her prolonged, husky giggle.

672050,AAXUNK0W2DZG5,B00005O7N7,"Amazon Customer ""leneker""","[14, 14]","""Victoria and Albert"" is a stunning costume drama concentrating on the early part of their marriage with some brief scenes in the later years culminating in the death of Albert.  The film is well-written and well-acted and well worth seeing.So many films about Victoria concentrate upon the long years as a widow.  It is refreshing to see her here as a giddy young teenager just handed the keys to the largest empire in the world.  The adolescent battles with her mother would rock the kingdom. She is clearly reluctant to share her power and majesty with a husband, especially her dour straight-laced cousin Albert whom her family wants her to marry.  However the 'arranged' part of the marriage goes out the window during a visit when Victoria conveniently falls in love with Albert and desires him for the many qualities that she perceives in him.Despite her great love for him the early years are especially tempestuous as Albert struggles to fulfill the role that his family has raised him for. Victoria's ministers despise the German prince and struggle to keep him from becoming the power behind the throne (a position they want for themselves). Albert serves as something of a gigolo to the young woman and this is the cause of many 'storms' within the palace.  Through hard work and ability Albert is able to bring the Queen around and become a key figure in Victoria's reign.Sure this is not a history book, and many things go by the wayside.  Their shocking inability as parents to view their children as more than diplomatic tools is a sad reality.  In the movie this gets brushed aside for the most part (although Victoria is shown as being more concerned about doing her duty and having a son than about her child).  This can be easily overlooked as the movie is ""Victoria and Albert"" not ""Victoria, Albert, Vicky, Bertie, Alice, Affie, Helena, Louise, Arthur, Leopold, and Beatrice"".  The fact is that Albert mostly saw his children as ways to expand his power throughout Europe and into the future, Victoria mostly saw her young children as people who made Albert happy or cross.  Since this movie is mostly about their early years of marriage the short shrift given to the children was understandable. It is a love story about two people and in that it succeeds.Give that this show attempts to compress a marriage of over twenty years into a little more than 3 and half hours, it is a remarkable accomplishment and I highly recommend it.  It is captivating from start to finish.",5,get this movie !

672054,A1H3S4KTB6QJ8H,B00005O7N7,"C. Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham""","[0, 0]","I was completely enthralled with this period piece. It focuses mostly on the meeting, brief romance and marriage of the Queen and Prince Albert; but also gives a behind-the-scenes view of Victoria's ascension to the throne (she was just shy of her 18th birthday!), her personal struggles with her very demanding and power-seeking mother, and her and Albert's struggles and triumphs to live as man and wife while raising a family and fulfilling their royal duties.  Apart from the romantic theme, there is quite a bit of British history woven throughout the movie which I found fascinating. I also sympathized with Albert's frustration of being in the Queen's shadow as Prince Consort (and not allowed to assist her in her royal duties although he was more than capable, as he proves later in their marriage). This is a lavish, well-acted and brilliantly executed 2-part dramatization. I wasn't surprised to learn that the producers of this movie also worked on a previous BBC favorite of mine; the 1995 mini series Pride and Prejudice. Victoria Hamilton, the actress who plays Queen Victoria, also portrayed ""Mrs. Forster"" in P&P; and ""Henrietta Musgrove"" in the 1995 production of Jane Austen's Persuasion.If you like romantic period pieces with a good amount of British History tossed into the mix, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie.Enjoy,Cris LaRue for Amazon.com",5,Excellent in Every Way,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,1373,"['was', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'period', 'piece', 'mostly', 'meeting', 'brief', 'romance', 'marriage', 'Queen', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'also', 'behind-the-scenes', 'view', 'Victoria', 'ascension', 'throne', 'was', 'just', 'shy', '18th', 'birthday', 'personal', 'struggles', 'very', 'demanding', 'power-seeking', 'mother', 'Albert', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'live', 'man', 'wife', 'raising', 'family', 'fulfilling', 'royal', 'duties', 'Apart', 'romantic', 'theme', 'quite', 'bit', 'British', 'history', 'woven', 'movie', 'found', 'fascinating', 'also', 'sympathized', 'Albert', 'frustration', 'being', 'Queen', 'shadow', 'Prince', 'Consort', 'not', 'allowed', 'assist', 'royal', 'duties', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'later', 'marriage', 'lavish', 'well-acted', 'brilliantly', 'executed', '2-part', 'dramatization', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'learn', 'producers', 'movie', 'also', 'worked', 'previous', 'BBC', 'favorite', 'mine', '1995', 'mini', 'series', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Victoria', 'Hamilton', 'actress', 'who', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'also', 'portrayed', 'Mrs.', 'Forster', 'P', 'P', 'Henrietta', 'Musgrove', '1995', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion.If', 'like', 'romantic', 'period', 'pieces', 'good', 'amount', 'British', 'History', 'tossed', 'mix', 'then', 'will', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'movie.Enjoy', 'Cris', 'LaRue', 'Amazon.com']",N/A
672055,A2FS38D943KX12,B00005O7N7,chefdevergue,"[5, 9]","Maybe I am guilty of having overly high expectations, but I guess I expected more from this production than it delivered.  Certainly the most of the cast boasts an impressive resume, although I found the two principals to be somewhat wanting.  The real Victoria, on her absolute best day, came nowhere close to being as cute as Victoria Hamilton, and it appeared at times that Prince Albert's German accent (in the hands of Jonathan Firth) actually became more pronounced as the production wore on.  He starts out sounding English & ends up sounding German (or Middle European at least)?  How truly odd.These are quibbles.  Mostly I was disappointed because whoever wrote the script seemed settle for a series of romantic vignettes, linked together by an outdoor shot (""Windsor Castle, Ten Years Later --- 1861,"" for example).  Victoria & Albert struggle with the conflict of their duties & their feelings.  Victoria & Albert squabble.  Then Victoria & Albert hold hands & profess their love for each other.  Really really schmaltzy music begins to play.  Cue the next outdoor transitional shot with a subtitle.  Repeat several times over the next few hours.  There was no sense of coherent narrative.As many other reviewers have mentioned, historical accuracy is sacrificed early & often.  No need to go into specifics as it has been covered before --- suffice it to say, the producers apparently reached a fork in the road --- one could try to be reasonable accurate in telling the story, or one could appeal to the masses & churn out a schmaltzy love story with two appealing leading players (the real Victoria & Albert weren't nearly this sympathetic).  Obviously a lot of people loved the choice the producers made, so who am I to criticize?My favorite part of this production?  Peter Ustinov's turn as the aging William IV --- but sadly, he is pushing up daisies before the first hour is finished.

Jonathan Firth's Albert is potrayed as a gentle, decent, thoughtful man, made to leave his homeland and struggle to find acceptance in an entirely different country. But in the scene where this devoted father of nine comforts hs wife during labor while nearby, his critics suggest that he should be at a men's club instead, we see that, by following the German tradition on dealing with childbirth, he is a man ahead of his time. One of the more delightful moments ofthe film is when, during their courtship, he and Victoria play a duet together on the piano. One of the saddest, is when the Christmas tree, a custom Albert introduced to England, arrives a few days before his death on December 14,1861. It was nice to see a grown-upKate Mayberly in films again. She plays the couple's second daughter, Alice, who followed her older sister into marriage in the German Nobility, became the mother of Russia's last Czarina, and died of diptheria at the age of 35.The relationships of the Queen and her cabinet members is touched upon, as is the relationship with her overbearing mother. Peter Ustinov has a certain strained charisma as the Queen's predecessor, who is still aware of his sister-in-law's antics despite ill health.

Victoria is portrayed by a woman who looks very much like Victoria's photographs and portraits' likeness, but presents her as a simpering, brainless girl, rather than the hot-tempered, dignified and strong woman she was.  After reading the biography ""We Two"", this dvd was quite a letdown, and I greatly preferred the movie ""The Young Victoria"" (starring Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend) over this.  The Dutchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, did quite a bit of research on the Queen, and presented that in that movie and in a book of Victoria and Albert's life at their summer/vacation home (""Victoria and Albert-A Life at Osborne House"").  Almost nothing in this movie represents the truth, spare a few notable quotes.  Queen Victoria didn't think much of Albert when they met at age 16, but when she was a bit older thought of him as quite stunning and very much enjoyed his company--this movie lets you think that this wasn't so, and even portrays her as being against the marriage after her coronation.

672066,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00005O7N7,John D. Cofield,"[75, 76]","Victoria and Albert is a magnificent costume drama with excellent stars, a compelling story, and lovely settings. As you watch this, please keep in mind that this is a romanticized, not completely factual dramatization of the married life of Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert.  In other words, enjoy it, but don't take it as accurate history.The first episode is good drama and fairly good history.  The young Victoria is shown living a cloistered life in Kensington Palace, used by her ambitious mother and others to maintain a toe hold on power.  Then, after the death of her uncle William IV, Victoria's early reign is also depicted accurately as she took on her responsibilities with a dutifulness which characterized her entire reign.  Her daughterly relationship with her first Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne is also well done.  Finally, her meeting with Prince Albert and their hesitant courtship, engagement, and marriage is both compelling and true to history.It is with the second episode that the drama begins to overwhelm the history.  Victoria and Albert are shown with a family of six children (they really had nine) whom they bounce on their knees, cuddle and nuzzle in public, and obviously adore.  Unfortunately the real Queen Victoria was not fond of children, and Prince Albert saw his progeny as useful tools for carrying out his long range plan for the liberalization of Europe, but not a whole lot more.  The whitewashing of their troubled relationship with their eldest son and heir Bertie is really ridiculous.  Bertie could never do right and was a constant disappointment to his parents, as they never ceased telling him.  While Prince Albert's last meeting with Bertie, in which he says something like &quot;I'm sorry we've been so hard on you&quot; is charmingly acted, nothing like that ever took place.  I also found the scenes in which Albert repeatedly ponders whether he really loves Victoria a bit unbelievable.  Finally, Victoria's composure after Albert's death is completely at odds with history, which records her retreating into deep mourning for the next four decades.Regardless of the inaccuracies, this is a beautiful piece of work and well worth the price.  If you like this Victoria and Albert, may I suggest that you also look into the mini-series Edward the King, produced in the mid 1970s, which covers Bertie's life and times.  It is just as well written and acted, and contains a far more true to life depiction of Victoria and Albert.",4,"Great Costume Drama, So-So on the History",1004572800,"11 1, 2001",2001,2495,"['Victoria', 'Albert', 'magnificent', 'costume', 'drama', 'excellent', 'stars', 'compelling', 'story', 'lovely', 'settings', 'watch', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'romanticized', 'not', 'completely', 'factual', 'dramatization', 'married', 'life', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'consort', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'other', 'words', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'accurate', 'history.The', 'first', 'episode', 'good', 'drama', 'fairly', 'good', 'history', 'young', 'Victoria', 'shown', 'living', 'cloistered', 'life', 'Kensington', 'Palace', 'used', 'ambitious', 'mother', 'others', 'maintain', 'toe', 'hold', 'power', 'Then', 'death', 'uncle', 'William', 'IV', 'Victoria', 'early', 'reign', 'also', 'depicted', 'accurately', 'took', 'responsibilities', 'dutifulness', 'characterized', 'entire', 'reign', 'daughterly', 'relationship', 'first', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Lord', 'Melbourne', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Finally', 'meeting', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'hesitant', 'courtship', 'engagement', 'marriage', 'compelling', 'true', 'history.It', 'second', 'episode', 'drama', 'overwhelm', 'history', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'are', 'shown', 'family', 'six', 'children', 'really', 'had', 'nine', 'whom', 'bounce', 'knees', 'cuddle', 'nuzzle', 'public', 'obviously', 'adore', 'Unfortunately', 'real', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'was', 'not', 'fond', 'children', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'saw', 'progeny', 'useful', 'tools', 'carrying', 'out', 'long', 'range', 'plan', 'liberalization', 'Europe', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'whitewashing', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'eldest', 'son', 'heir', 'Bertie', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'Bertie', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'right', 'was', 'constant', 'disappointment', 'parents', 'never', 'ceased', 'telling', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'last', 'meeting', 'Bertie', 'something', 'quot', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'hard', 'quot', 'charmingly', 'acted', 'nothing', 'ever', 'took', 'place', 'also', 'found', 'scenes', 'Albert', 'repeatedly', 'really', 'Victoria', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'Finally', 'Victoria', 'composure', 'Albert', 'death', 'completely', 'odds', 'history', 'retreating', 'deep', 'mourning', 'next', 'four', 'decades.Regardless', 'inaccuracies', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'work', 'well', 'price', 'like', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'may', 'suggest', 'also', 'look', 'mini-series', 'Edward', 'King', 'produced', 'mid', '1970s', 'Bertie', 'life', 'times', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'far', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'depiction', 'Victoria', 'Albert']",N/A

Since I'm not, and since it seemed to cover what I do know of her fairly accurately, I'm giving this movie a high mark. First off, I happen to really enjoy period pieces that can pull the viewer in and help them to understand life from another time in history. Braveheart, Gettysburg, Three Soverigns For Sarah, Charles Dickens/Jane Austen movies, and even films about more recent times such as Enemy At The Gates and American Graffiti. If they keep them in their proper time and place (clothing, speech, sets, etc.), I'm glued. (Titanic was almost perfect except for the ""Can I bum a smoke"" line DiCaprio made after stopping Rose from jumping off the ship).Victoria and Albert caught my attention right off and held it til the end. It not only brought two historical figures to life, but it made them both human, with being vulnerable to human feelings and emotions. One can imagine how Victoria felt when she angrily spoke to her mother as THE QUEEN. One can also imagine how her mother felt being spoken to in that manner by her daughter THE QUEEN. How about Albert's feelings when Victoria poo poo'd him when he would try to help her with her duties, instead giving him a frivolous task to keep him ""happy.""I would have liked to have seen more of the relationship that Victoria and Albert had with their children, which was only touched upon and glossed over. Also, it would have been nice to see Victoria's affect first hand on the everyday people of England - her subjects - as she ruled for the majority of the 19th century. After all, a whole period in time was named for her. But that would have increased the time of this movie from four hours to six hours, I'm sure - not that I would have minded.I feel this is probably the best version out there of these two larger than life figures.

However, I kept forgetting this was supposed to be about queen Victoria. Young Victoria was short, chunky and homely as a mud fence. She was also said to have had a beautiful voice and a lovely laugh. If you were to put her in today's nondescript clothing and plunk her into a shopping mall she would be indistinguishable from all the other shoppers. The actresses that portray her are always very pretty, slim, and tallish. Victoria was one of the most photographed and recognizable women of her time. It's like making a movie about Eleanor Roosevelt and casting Elizabeth Taylor in the lead. The three cardinal sins of hollywood are to be fat, short,and homely. It is thought such people could not possibly have passionate fascinating personalities and movie makers believe that the public will not accept a feminine romantic lead who has such unfortunate dimensions. As a result, they are OK with an old fat Victoria but can't stomach a young chubby Victoria.Victoria and her times are a fascinating study. Movies about Victoria should concentrate more on the historical backgroud and the complexity of her personality. She had noble and maddingly neurotic traits. Royals were the rock stars of their day. People wanted to dress and do as they did. For example: When anesthesia was discovered in the early 1800s doctors were reluctant to give it to women in childbirth because, according to the Bible, God wanted them to suffer the pains of childbirth due to the sins of Eve. Victoria was having none of that and when offered said GIVE ME DRUGS. Her use of anesthesia during labor made it permissible for women to bypass the bible and avoid hours of painful labor.I'm still waiting for that 8 part series on Victoria and her times that realy does justice to the topic.

Mazza,"[46, 47]","&quot;Victoria and Albert,&quot; directed by John Erman, stars Victoria Hamilton and Jonathan Firth as Britain's Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert.  The superb supporting cast includes an impressive band of acting veterans, among them Peter Ustinov (as William IV) and Diana Rigg (as young Victoria's governess).  The film follows the courtship and married life of this royal couple.V&amp;A is a visually stunning period piece, but ultimately it's the fine performances that really make the film work.  There is a wonderful chemistry between the two leads, who furthermore capably rise to the challenge of portraying the pair over a long span of time.

Having given birth to 9 children by then, she was far from svelte!Victoria blamed Bertie for his father's death.  She could barely stand to be in the same room with him for many months afterwards.  The touching scene with the two of them and Alice is balderdash.Recognizing the limited timeframe, they certainly could have deleted some of the more extraneous scenes and found room for anecdotes that DID enhance the actual story being told -- Vicky's marriage, and the time Albert spent with her preparing for it -- the actual death of her mother [we saw the last visit, but never her reaction] -- The Lady Flora scandal early in her reign.Historical issues aside ... it was ok.  Reasonably well acted by most, attractive costumes, good production values. As someone who is very familiar with the era and the personalities being portrayed, I did find much of the heavy, plodding 'exposition-dialogue' to be pretty tedius.

672088,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B00005O7N7,Serene Night,"[10, 11]","Victoria and Albert was a lukewarm retelling of the lives of Queen Victoria and her consort. The screenwriter chose to portray Prince Albert as  uninterested in Victoria and uninterested in politics and only involving himself out of boredom and to help Victoria which was simply not true. Albert was an ambitious man, and worked very hard to be the power behind the throne, and was groomed to do so from a young age. If he didn't love Victoria at the outset, he certainly would never act like he didn't.  Albert had few friends in England and his number 1 supporter was his wife.  Albert had a Teutonic disregard for women in general, but there are no records to suggest he wasn't in love with her.The actors who played the famous couple were alright, but I felt the chemistry wasn't strong between them, which hampered the believability of the love story. The screenwriter chose to white wash some of the more Victorian attitudes, such as the attitude towards children. (Queen Victoria did not particularly like them, but especially babies), and their attitude towards Bertie (they didn't much care for him either).  Victoria was not a good mother. She ignored her children as most Victorian moms did, leaving them to the care of governesses. Albert was somewhat better, even good daddy material for the time period, but he had high standards which his eldest son never met.I felt the dismissal of Victoria's beloved governess made it appear that this was mostly Victoria's idea, when in fact this was Albert's plotting.  I think the writers should have worked a bit harder to portray Victoria's courtship and relationship with Albert from the beginning. Victoria's reluctance to wed Albert had much to do with the first impression he made when he came to court (he was ill and vomited, and wore a poorly fitted clothing)... Showing this early encounter might've humanized Albert, and shown how the ugly duckling had become a swan. Instead the about face Albert makes, with the Byron poetry seemed just sort of odd.Eh. I felt this could've been done better.

This includes some young people, as well as many senior citizens whose bodies have grown old, their hearing ability or their ability to understand what is being said has diminished, but their interest in good, solid, well-acted drama and comedy has NOT diminished; rather, it has increased since they were youngsters.  Therefore, these folks need help in their understanding and/or hearing what is being said, in order to fully enjoy the tale.  This translates into a need for sub-titles, or as some call it, ""captions for the hard-of-hearing.""  Lack of same denies pleasure to those who seek it, as well as knowledge and information.  As we grow older, I find that we become more interested in history, which only a few selected movies open up to us.  One might argue, ""but there are books on the subject!"" which doesn't hold water for obvious reasons.  The positive reviews I've read have whetted my appetite for ""Victoria and Albert"" as well as some other movies of interest, but disappointment comes again.Interestingly, A&E;'s ""Emma"" (fiction) and ""Jane Eyre"" (fiction), which I have and love, both offer sub-titles, but the important historical stories do not.  That doesn't make sense, in my book.  A & E and BBC both create marvelous productions, and I could weep when I discover that I, and millions more like me, are denied enjoyment of them for lack of sub-titles.  The powers-that-be in both of those institutions, whoever the folks are who make the decisions, need to perhaps seek the advice of the elderly members of their families and get their viewpoints, in order to understand.I don't know if anyone who sees this ""review"" has any ""pull"" with the powers-that-be, but if so, please get the word out.  And can we have some comments from others who will voice their opinions about the lack of sub-titles?By the way, I visited a young friend (abt 45-ish) one day who has normal hearing, and she put on a DVD.  I asked her to activate the sub-titles, which she did, and at the end of the movie, she said, ""Well!! I got parts of the dialogue that I had missed before without the sub-titles!!""",1,"Again, sheer disappointment",1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2217,"['When', 'will', 'producers', 'great', 'stories', 'DVD', 'realize', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'perfect', 'hearing', 'young', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'senior', 'citizens', 'bodies', 'have', 'grown', 'old', 'hearing', 'ability', 'ability', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'diminished', 'interest', 'good', 'solid', 'well-acted', 'drama', 'comedy', 'NOT', 'diminished', 'rather', 'increased', 'were', 'youngsters', 'Therefore', 'folks', 'need', 'help', 'understanding', 'and/or', 'hearing', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'order', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'tale', 'need', 'sub-titles', 'call', 'captions', 'hard-of-hearing', 'Lack', 'same', 'denies', 'pleasure', 'who', 'seek', 'as', 'well', 'knowledge', 'information', 'grow', 'older', 'find', 'become', 'more', 'interested', 'history', 'only', 'few', 'selected', 'movies', 'open', 'up', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'are', 'books', 'subject', ""n't"", 'hold', 'water', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'positive', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'movies', 'interest', 'disappointment', 'again.Interestingly', 'A', 'E', 'Emma', 'fiction', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'fiction', 'have', 'love', 'offer', 'sub-titles', 'important', 'historical', 'stories', 'do', 'not', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'book', 'A', 'E', 'BBC', 'create', 'marvelous', 'productions', 'could', 'weep', 'when', 'discover', 'millions', 'more', 'are', 'denied', 'enjoyment', 'lack', 'sub-titles', 'powers-that-be', 'institutions', 'whoever', 'folks', 'are', 'who', 'make', 'decisions', 'need', 'perhaps', 'seek', 'advice', 'elderly', 'members', 'families', 'get', 'viewpoints', 'order', 'understand.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'review', 'pull', 'powers-that-be', 'so', 'please', 'get', 'word', 'can', 'have', 'comments', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'voice', 'opinions', 'lack', 'sub-titles', 'way', 'visited', 'young', 'friend', 'abt', '45-ish', 'one', 'day', 'who', 'normal', 'hearing', 'put', 'DVD', 'asked', 'activate', 'sub-titles', 'did', 'end', 'movie', 'said', 'Well', 'got', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'had', 'missed', 'before', 'sub-titles']",N/A

Thinking on the production and viewing it again the second time I have come to apperciate the production and the leading actors do an amazing job as Victoria (Victoria Hamiliton) and Albert (Jonathan Firth).I especially like how Albert married Victoria even though he was not in love with her as Victoria was with Albert. But he took his marriage vows very seriously and he grew to love Victoria and was faithful to her.Victoria and Albert were very moral people and they as the first family wanted to set the example to the country.In my view there are some sences that I would of perfered if they were not in the production but they are shone upon in a bad light by the royal couple which I think is good. (these days good morals are a non existence)If you are interested in the royals or a truly amazing love story that actually happened you well enjoy this production.,4,Victoria Hamilton Shines as Queen Victoria,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1140,"['purchased', 'set', 'actually', 'watching', 'reccommendation', 'friend', 'reviews', 'written', 'production.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'own', 'production.At', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'Thinking', 'production', 'viewing', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'come', 'apperciate', 'production', 'leading', 'actors', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'Victoria', 'Victoria', 'Hamiliton', 'Albert', 'Jonathan', 'Firth', '.I', 'especially', 'how', 'Albert', 'married', 'Victoria', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'love', 'Victoria', 'was', 'Albert', 'took', 'marriage', 'very', 'seriously', 'grew', 'love', 'Victoria', 'was', 'faithful', 'her.Victoria', 'Albert', 'were', 'very', 'moral', 'people', 'first', 'family', 'wanted', 'set', 'example', 'country.In', 'view', 'are', 'sences', 'would', 'perfered', 'were', 'not', 'production', 'are', 'shone', 'bad', 'light', 'royal', 'couple', 'think', 'good', 'days', 'good', 'morals', 'are', 'non', 'existence', 'are', 'interested', 'royals', 'truly', 'amazing', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'happened', 'well', 'enjoy', 'production']",N/A
