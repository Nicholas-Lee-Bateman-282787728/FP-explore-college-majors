1166326,AIMR915K4YCN,B001AMG2EA,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 1]","THE STEPMOTHER opens w/ a man named Frank Delgado (Alejandro Rey) coming home to find his wife Margo having sex w/ another man. Hubby strangles the interloper to death in his driveway, loads him up in his Corvette, and takes him away for burial. While covering the corpse w/ dirt, a squabbling couple shows up, and the man kills the woman! What are the odds? All this while Frank's wife takes a shower! Early the next day, a carload of swingin' hipsters arrive, led by Dick (Larry Linville!), and a movie director called ""THE GOOF"". They dance to ultra-mod flute-music in the living room, while Frank sulks. Meanwhile, the cops are on the case, looking into both murders. The hep-cats are playing beach volleyball. Frank scowls and frowns a lot, haunted by guilt, or perhaps intestinal bloating. The cops show up at the beach pad, asking questions and looking concerned. Frank scowls some more. Soon, the police are quite suspicious, making Frank look nervous. Uh-oh! Frank sees Margo out at a restaurant w/ Dick. Now, he's paranoid, jealous, and enraged! It's all a misunderstanding, but Frank pushes Dick off of a building! SPLAT! Frank's son flies in from Mexico. It's not long before Margo seduces junior, and father and son have a talk. THE STEPMOTHER is another CROWN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES release. A perfect drive-in movie for its time, complete w/ ample female nudity, 70s ambiance, and serious groove-itude. Besides, how could anyone not like a film w/ a character called ""THE GOOF"" in it?

Chow,"[0, 0]","Crown International wasn't so much a movie studio as a 60s-70s purveyor of schlock that occasionally qualified as guilty pleasures, which unfortunately doesn't include STEPMOTHER. The only notable features of this thriller without thrills are the scenes in which Katherine Justice, an attractive and usually somewhat straitlaced actress from that era, slinks around in the nude, the fact that her first name is misspelled in the credits (&#34;Catherine&#34; with a &#34;C&#34; instead of &#34;K&#34;), and a cameo appearance from Claudia Jennings, a bombshell from the same era whose specialty IS slinking around in the nude.  The male lead is Alejandro Rey, who seems considerably aged from several seasons of being exasperated by The Flying Nun.  In a supporting role is another familiar character actor from those days - John Anderson, who looks like he's working off a severe hangover.  It really sounds like a guilty pleasure, doesn't it?

1166329,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B001AMG2EA,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","The is the first film written and directed by Howard Avedis, a somewhat well-known figure in 70s exploitation cinema, whose best-known film is probably his next,The Teacher(1974), and who seemed like many of his peers to want to do ""art films"" - but instead had to accept just throwing in the occasional odd expressionist touch in the cheesy stuff that he in fact did make.  THE STEPMOTHER doesn't give the audience any time to get bored with ""exposition"" or any of that unnecessary stuff.  A couple are in bed having sex; it seems the woman may not be into it, but it also doesn't quite seem like rape.  But then the husband comes home.  He's about to go upstairs, but he sees the shadows of the couple in turn in the window.  They freeze-frame, something I thought might have been a flaw at first in either the film or this copy, but Avedis uses this technique several times over the course of the film - for no purpose that I could figure out.  Hey, it's ""arty"", man.  Anyway the adulterer comes out of the house and is set upon by the husband, Frank Delgado (Alejandro Rey) and quickly strangled to death.  Frank and the adulterer know each other and are apparently friends by the way; our Frank turns out to be rather hot-blooded.  He decides to take the body (in the dead man's car) to someplace deserted and bury it, but a couple is having an argument nearby which spooks him a bit.Cue next day.  Frank wakes up in bed next to his wife, Margo (Katherine Justice, auburn-haired and exceedingly cute).  The two decide to go to the beach to pal around with some friends, though Frank's not into it.  Cue the sexy montage (well, sexy girls - and guys dressed in suits).  We learn that Frank is an architect, with partner Dick Hill (Larry Linville, best known for playing Frank Burns on M*A*S*H) - and that the dead man was Alan Richmond, a rich friend and client of theirs, whose house they were building and whose money they really needed.  Frank's gotten himself in some hot water, which just gets hotter as he finds himself being investigated by a fairly zealous cop (the tall and garrulous John Anderson, a character actor who is easily the most familiar face here besides Linville), and getting increasingly paranoid about his wife, who he soon starts to think might be having an affair with his partner - after seeing them for a flash of a second at a restaurant.Eventually Frank gets involved in another death, and in the last third of the film the title becomes apparent, as his teenaged son Steve (Rudy Herrera Jr., simply dreadful) comes home to visit from Mexico City, just as Frank has to fly to Acapulco on business.  Margo, tired of Frank ignoring her since the murder, sets out to seduce Steve (not all that difficult) and the two end up going to a cabin (located apparently just a few minutes away) up in the mountains, where Frank finds them at the climax of the film, which ends in a ludicrous scene that would kill any serious film but actually gives this piece of silly trash something memorable to take away from it.The acting here is generally not very good - Anderson as the cop is a reliable professional as always, and Justice seems believable enough as the unjustly scorned and horny wife; she also seems genuinely stoned in the scene where she's seducing Steve after smoking dope.  Rey alternates between being decent and pretty bad though; his very 70s suits and ties are probably the best thing he has going in this film.  Shot cheaply and without quite the sense of location that THE TEACHER had, and without as much high-quality nudity, this is definitely not my favorite Howard Avedis film so far, though I'm eager to see more.  The theme song, ""Strange Are the Ways of Love"" by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster and sung appropriately enough by ""Manuel"" was nominated for an Oscar - the only Oscar nomination that Crown Internation Pictures ever received.  It should also be noted that 1970 Playboy Playmate of the Year Claudia Jennings, something of a cult 70s sleaze-film actress, makes one of her first appearances here as - what else? - a soft-porn actress in a brief scene where she disrobes.Obviously not even close to a great film, maybe not even a good one, but fun if you're into this sort of thing for sure.",3,Fun 70s cheese with some arty twists to go with the babes and bodies,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,4255,"['first', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Howard', 'Avedis', 'somewhat', 'well-known', 'figure', '70s', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'best-known', 'film', 'probably', 'next', 'Teacher', '1974', 'who', 'seemed', 'many', 'peers', 'want', 'do', 'art', 'films', 'instead', 'had', 'accept', 'just', 'throwing', 'occasional', 'odd', 'expressionist', 'touch', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'fact', 'did', 'make', 'STEPMOTHER', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'exposition', 'unnecessary', 'stuff', 'couple', 'are', 'bed', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'also', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'rape', 'then', 'husband', 'home', 'go', 'upstairs', 'shadows', 'couple', 'turn', 'window', 'freeze-frame', 'something', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'flaw', 'first', 'film', 'copy', 'Avedis', 'technique', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'film', 'purpose', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'Hey', 'arty', 'man', 'Anyway', 'adulterer', 'house', 'set', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Delgado', 'Alejandro', 'Rey', 'quickly', 'strangled', 'death', 'Frank', 'adulterer', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'apparently', 'friends', 'way', 'Frank', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'hot-blooded', 'take', 'body', 'dead', 'man', 'car', 'someplace', 'deserted', 'bury', 'couple', 'having', 'argument', 'nearby', 'bit.Cue', 'next', 'day', 'Frank', 'up', 'bed', 'wife', 'Margo', 'Katherine', 'Justice', 'auburn-haired', 'exceedingly', 'cute', 'two', 'decide', 'go', 'beach', 'pal', 'around', 'friends', 'Frank', 'not', 'Cue', 'sexy', 'montage', 'well', 'sexy', 'girls', 'guys', 'dressed', 'suits', 'learn', 'Frank', 'architect', 'partner', 'Dick', 'Hill', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'M*A*S*H', 'dead', 'man', 'was', 'Alan', 'Richmond', 'rich', 'friend', 'client', 'theirs', 'house', 'were', 'building', 'money', 'really', 'needed', 'Frank', 'gotten', 'hot', 'water', 'just', 'hotter', 'being', 'investigated', 'fairly', 'zealous', 'cop', 'tall', 'garrulous', 'John', 'Anderson', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'easily', 'most', 'familiar', 'face', 'here', 'Linville', 'getting', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'wife', 'who', 'soon', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'partner', 'seeing', 'flash', 'second', 'restaurant.Eventually', 'Frank', 'involved', 'death', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'title', 'apparent', 'teenaged', 'son', 'Steve', 'Rudy', 'Herrera', 'Jr.', 'simply', 'dreadful', 'home', 'visit', 'Mexico', 'City', 'just', 'Frank', 'fly', 'Acapulco', 'business', 'Margo', 'tired', 'Frank', 'ignoring', 'murder', 'out', 'seduce', 'Steve', 'not', 'difficult', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'cabin', 'located', 'apparently', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'away', 'up', 'mountains', 'where', 'Frank', 'climax', 'film', 'ludicrous', 'scene', 'would', 'kill', 'serious', 'film', 'actually', 'piece', 'silly', 'trash', 'something', 'memorable', 'take', 'away', 'it.The', 'acting', 'here', 'generally', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Anderson', 'cop', 'reliable', 'professional', 'always', 'Justice', 'believable', 'enough', 'unjustly', 'scorned', 'horny', 'wife', 'also', 'genuinely', 'stoned', 'scene', 'where', 'seducing', 'Steve', 'smoking', 'dope', 'Rey', 'being', 'decent', 'pretty', 'bad', 'very', '70s', 'suits', 'ties', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'Shot', 'cheaply', 'quite', 'sense', 'location', 'THE', 'TEACHER', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'high-quality', 'nudity', 'definitely', 'not', 'favorite', 'Howard', 'Avedis', 'film', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'eager', 'see', 'more', 'theme', 'song', 'Strange', 'Are', 'Ways', 'Love', 'Sammy', 'Fain', 'Paul', 'Francis', 'Webster', 'sung', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'Manuel', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Crown', 'Internation', 'Pictures', 'ever', 'received', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', '1970', 'Playboy', 'Playmate', 'Year', 'Claudia', 'Jennings', 'something', 'cult', '70s', 'sleaze-film', 'actress', 'one', 'first', 'appearances', 'here', 'what', 'else', 'soft-porn', 'actress', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'disrobes.Obviously', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'great', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'fun', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'sure']",N/A
1166330,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B001AMG2EA,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 2]","""The Stepmother"" is a decent potboiler about lust, betrayal, and murder from producer Hikmet Avedis (which is normally a warning sign). The film is carried by a great performance from Alejandro Rey as haunted architect Frank Delgado, who becomes embroiled in two separate murders. The film opens with terrible music and the murder of Delgado's wife's lover at the hands of an enraged Rey. While he seems to have put a lid on that successfully, Rey and Larry Linville (a prototype pre-MASH Frank Burns), his business partner, have both romantic and monetary issues to overcome, and Rey is a hothead with little self-control. I won't reveal what happens with Linville, but I will say that although contrived, it's interesting. The crimes are being investigated by a wannabe Columbo (Peter Falk has nothing to worry about) who, while none too bright, is extremely grating. Along with that distraction there are other negatives to the film, not the least of which is watching a bunch of fully dressed fifty-somethings frolic on a beach: I never need to see that. There are unexpected B-movie joys here, though, my favorite of which is without question the jazz-funk flute dance.Although the film starts and ends with implausible coincidences and features completely moronic police work, the acting really does make the film highly watchable. The technical aspects of the film are middling at best and are very dated, especially the endlessly repeated freeze frame effect used for plot transitions. The subplot about the hot young stepmother, Margo, getting high and making a pass at her stepson is both repulsive and laughable. (This pass is extraordinarily clumsy, somewhat akin to the pass Torgo makes at Margaret in ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"".) Despite the obvious flaws, though, the film is very watchable and manages to overcome its history as an example of exploitation cinema, largely through the performance of Alejandro Rey.",3,"Murder, Betrayal, Larry Linville, And A Jazz-Funk Flute Dance!",1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,1929,"['Stepmother', 'decent', 'potboiler', 'lust', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'producer', 'Hikmet', 'Avedis', 'normally', 'warning', 'sign', 'film', 'carried', 'great', 'performance', 'Alejandro', 'Rey', 'haunted', 'architect', 'Frank', 'Delgado', 'who', 'embroiled', 'two', 'separate', 'murders', 'film', 'terrible', 'music', 'murder', 'Delgado', 'wife', 'lover', 'hands', 'enraged', 'Rey', 'have', 'put', 'lid', 'successfully', 'Rey', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'prototype', 'pre-MASH', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'business', 'partner', 'have', 'romantic', 'monetary', 'issues', 'overcome', 'Rey', 'hothead', 'little', 'self-control', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'Linville', 'will', 'say', 'contrived', 'interesting', 'crimes', 'are', 'being', 'investigated', 'wannabe', 'Columbo', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about', 'who', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'extremely', 'grating', 'distraction', 'are', 'other', 'negatives', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'watching', 'bunch', 'fully', 'dressed', 'fifty-somethings', 'frolic', 'beach', 'never', 'need', 'see', 'are', 'unexpected', 'B-movie', 'joys', 'here', 'though', 'favorite', 'question', 'jazz-funk', 'flute', 'film', 'starts', 'implausible', 'coincidences', 'features', 'completely', 'moronic', 'police', 'work', 'acting', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'highly', 'watchable', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'middling', 'best', 'are', 'very', 'dated', 'especially', 'endlessly', 'repeated', 'freeze', 'frame', 'effect', 'used', 'plot', 'transitions', 'subplot', 'hot', 'young', 'stepmother', 'Margo', 'getting', 'high', 'making', 'pass', 'stepson', 'repulsive', 'laughable', 'pass', 'extraordinarily', 'clumsy', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'pass', 'Torgo', 'Margaret', 'Manos', 'Hands', 'Fate', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'though', 'film', 'very', 'watchable', 'overcome', 'history', 'example', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'largely', 'performance', 'Alejandro', 'Rey']",N/A
1166331,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B001AMG2EA,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie opens with a man attempting to have sex with ""Margo"" who is half asleep. She says, ""no"" pretty much like a wife says ""No"" to her husband, but gives in anyway. Apparently they have some screen sex (bed sheet pulled up to her neck). The real husband Frank Delgado (Alejandro Rey aka Carlos Gomez of the ""Flying Nun"" series)comes home and the next thing you know he is loading a body into his car with the proverbial shovel while his wife (Catherine/Katherine Justice) showers (nudity).The dead man is a client Alan Richmond (Mike Kulcsar). While he is burying him in a shallow grave there is a weird credit roll as if the movie was over. There is another couple out in the woods, although we don't know how close or what they saw. The guy went there to have some fun, the woman went there to frustrate him. They next thing you know he grabs her by the hair, gets her on the ground and slaps her and...well we don't know at this point.The next morning a group of 4 hippy-esque people show up to go party. Frank reluctantly goes along with them, mostly because he will have to talk to Dick Hill, played by Larry Linville who is uncool in this movie as he was as Frank Burns in M.A.S.H. His wife Sonja is played by Marlene Schmidt.Meanwhile the cops have found the body of a strangled Mexican woman and that of Alan Richmond who were both strangled about the same time. The case is investigated by Inspector Darnezi (John Anderson, Star Trek: The Next Generation ""The Survivors"") and Chief Inspector (Duncan McLeod).The guys are architects. They were designing a house for Richmond, who was ready to seal the deal. It appears everyone knew he was sleeping with Margo, except Frank.Now the movie is not a who-dun-it. We know who did it. So it is about crime solving, but the inspectors are not entertaining like Columbo, where how they find out holds our interest. The killing plays havoc on their lives. Frank is told about the affair and he is haunted with images of Alan Richmond. This is all find and well, but never fits into the movie. The title ""Stepmother"" is about Margo.The script is very bad. The actors did what they could to rescue it.  Not worth the time to watch.",2,OH!
