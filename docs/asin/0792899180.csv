On the one end it seems somewhat of a propaganda film.  On the other end, it clearly shows that the Chinese are able to look back with some criticism on the cultural revolution and other surrounding events. There was one disconnection though that seemed kind of obvious and awkward to me - in particular the father's transition from sorry gambler to family man and upstanding citizen.  Of course, this may have to do with the theme of survival.  Perhaps he had to change his ways in order to survive, and ultimately to live.  But here I didn't think that there was a lot of flow in the film.

""To Live"" takes a different approach to narrate the confusing periods in Chinese history in the 20th century, to tell a store of life, and a history of a nation.  Don't get me wrong!  It's not a heavy movie like other portrayal movies of Chinese History such as ""Farewell My Concubine"", ""Blue Kite"" or ""the Last Emperor"" (they're good movies as well, but no comparison to ""To Live""); quite the contrary, ""To Live"" is humorous, delightful, positive, and encouraging. It's not only a good comedy that makes you laugh, but also makes you laugh with tears in your eyes, sad and sore in your heart.The main story line is how am ordinary family of Fu Gui (Ge You) and Jia Zhen (Gong Li) went through their lives in various movements, wars and revolutions in China.  A careless gambler, Fu Gui, lost everything he had - money, property and family - only left with a set of puppets. It's the same set of puppets that went through all the ups and downs with Fu Gui, his family and friends. Through all the tragic and comic moments and events, through all the bitter-sweetness and irony, the characters were in such a positive spirit that they could make jokes of anything in life, but only through the body languages and their eyes, you could see the heartache.There is an old Chinese proverb that states, ""the old man lost his horse, but it turned out to be his good luck"".  The entire movie is based on this theory: whether you gain or lose, promote or demote, you would never know if it were good for you at the end.

But Master Fugui---marvelously portrayed by the star of this film, Ge You---chooses to be selfish when he has the freedom of choice.  Later on, after he loses all,  he's a lot more amenable toward playing things safe as he adopts a new tune to sing: Hark, ""the ship of revolution! Advance through the storm with Chairman Mao!""  Then life becomes a simple odeal to live through as best one can; as we are taken through the Communist Party takeover of mainland China, then through Mao's nonsensical ""Great Leap Foward"" (when Jiazhen asks the party cadre in charge: ""If you take all our pots away how are we to cook?""  To which the party hack responds: ""We're racing towards Communism, and you worry about food?""---But the recycled metal turned out to be useless for smelting into steel).  Common folk are even more adversely affected later during the ""Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"" (which was initiated by Mao in 1966).  During this time when the family, in need of a doctor, asks in a hospital for one they receive this reply:  ""The Red Guards [Mao's fanatical followers] are in control! Doctors? ""They're all reactionaries, we've overthrown them.""  And then they all frantically do nothing useful as the patient on the table awaits the help that is sought after elsewhere.  ""You must bear it, no matter what"" Fugui had advised a friend earlier, in not dissimilar circumstances, but such advice was something that he too followed himself; & had to, to survive.  Such was life in China under Mao.  ""Coming out alive wasn't easy"" for the family portayed herein, nor for the Chinese people.  This is a captivating film & Ge You's fine acting holds it together.  It's a snapshot of 3 generations of a Chinese family's struggle ""To Live,"" but it would be more true to characterize this as a struggle ""To Survive""---with all the melancholic repercussions associated with such a simple instinct; & is thus a stand-in for the slice of Chinese history that this film represents.

157782,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792899180,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 5]","Not.What I think Zhang Yimou's message here is that the will of the people ""to live,"" as in the title, to survive and overcome obstacles is what defines the Chinese people.  They ride the ox of communism as a boat rides a wave.  They adapt.Consider that tall and thin Fugui (played with consummate skill by You Ge) says that a chick will become a chicken when it grows up, and then a sheep and then an ox and then the Communist Party.  But as the film ends he tells his grandson only that the chick will become a chicken and then a sheep and then an ox.  He doesn't mention communism.  In this way we know that the people have tamed the ox.Zhang's film is an epic parable of life in China in the 20th century.  It opens before the communist revolution with protagonist Fugui as a wayward son who is gambling the family fortune away.  His wife, Jiazhen (Gong Li) pleads with him to stop, but he cannot.  He is addicted to vice.  Symbolically he represents the old regime.  He loses everything, wife included and goes to live in the streets.  After some time the revolutionary war begins and he and his friends find it convenient to switch sides and join the revolutionary army--he as an entertainer for the troops, a puppeteer.  He and wife reunite and become loyal and even enthusiastic communists.  He is lucky to have lost his fortune for now he is recognized as a hero of the revolution, while the man who won his family's house at dice is declared a counter-revolutionary and meets a bad end.As in every Zhang Yimou film I have seen, everything is beautifully and exquisitely done.  His work is characterized by an artist's sense of color and form, by an engaging simplicity in the telling, and by a subtle sense of what is going on politically, and especially by a deep and abiding sense of humanity.  Here the transformation of Chinese society from feudalism to communism to the capitalist/communism hybrid that exists today is shown through the eyes and experiences of the people; and what is emphasized is the endurance and the will of the people to survive, adapt and finally to flourish regardless of who might be in power.I would compare Zhang Yimou to the very greatest directors, say, to Stanley Kubrick, to Francis Ford Coppola, to Louis Malle, to Krzysztof Kieslowski in sheer artistic talent.  Like Malle he is warm and honest about human beings and what they do without being maudlin or sentimental.  Like Coppola he has an epic-maker's vision, and like the Coppola of the Godfather films, a strong sense of family.  Like Kubrick he is creative and always aware of the needs of the audience, and like Kieslowski he is clever.This is in some respects Zhang Yimou's finest achievement because of the way he tells the story of communism in China.  I am reminded of the way Louis Malle tells the truth about human sexuality without inciting the censors.  Here Zhang Yimou tells the truth about the communist experience in China, subtly demonstrating its cruelties and stupidities without, amazing enough, incurring the wrath of the authorities.  (Some of his films have been banned in China, but I understand they are readily available nonetheless.)  Here the kids are smiling and happy as they work in the steel mill.  The accident that kills Fugui's son is seen as just that, an accident and not the fault of the ""Great Leap Forward.""  The members of the educated class, who are ridiculed, beaten and banished (and worse) during the ""Cultural Revolution,"" accept their fate as their just deserts--the doctor who insists that it is better to wear the placard shaming him that is hung from around his neck than it is to take it off.  The local official who has preached and practiced the communist line faithfully, who finds himself being labeled a capitalist, also accepts his fate as though in doing so he is furthering a cause larger than himself.In a way Zhang Yimou's international celebrity and reputation as one of the world's greatest film makers protects him.  In another sense his depictions of the sins and excesses of the old regime before communism are so well done and appreciated by all, that such an expression also protects him.Nonetheless, I do not personally consider this Zhang Yimou's best film.  I prefer the startling beauty of Raise the Red Lantern (1991) and Red Sorghum (1987) as well as the charming Not One Less (1999) or the simple but powerful, The Story of Qiu Ju.  However, this is an outstanding film.Notable in a supporting role is Wu Jiang as Wan Erxi the strong young man with the limp who marries the mute daughter.

Fugui (You Ge) seems to ruin things for himself and his family, Jiazhen (Gong Li) leaves Fugui in disgust, but history intervenes to change everything. These two are tossed about amidst the tumultuous events of mid 20th century China, but endure. Their story is one of great sorrow, fleeting joy, and incredible irony.This is a first rate production. The acting, filming, and sets are all excellent. As for authenticity, I know nothing of the particulars of life in China at this time, so I cannot comment. As for the general historical events, this film falls far short of depicting the suffering inflicted by the Nationalists and Communists both.To Live depicts the tragedy of the combat between Marxist and Nationalist forces well. It shows a political execution and depicts the fear inspired by the Maoist regime. This reveals only a small part of the tragic events of mid 20th century China. The Chinese Nationalists carried out purges and `bandit extermination' eventually killing more than ten million. The atrocities of Chiang and the Kuomintang are not needed for the storyline of this movie, but the absence of these facts diminish this films' historical accuracy. Not to be outdone by their rivals. The Maoists killed more than 35 million. You would know none of this from this film. It rightly depicts political persecution and the absurd dictates of the Cultural Revolution. But it ignores the famines that killed millions. In one scene, an attendant in a common kitchen shovels out food like it exits in abundance. If fact, famine and malnourishment stalked tens of millions and the number of executions was staggering.This film is highly entertaining, and partially correct in terms of history. Of course, an authentic history of this period would probably have been censored, so one can hardly blame the producers for this. It is a fine film, well worth watching.

Principally, the story uses the backdrop of the revolution to alter China's political structure more and more toward Communism, and this works winningly as the family continues to have to rethink their commitment to political principles while enduring some devastating losses.  The acting is superb, the cinematography is unforgettable, and the story is equal parts pain and pleasure, with humor thrown in to boot.TO LIVE is, arguably, not for everyone.  It is a pure drama, and, as a consequence, there are several passages that may seem meaningless to the viewer as their significance can only be measured by the events to come; patience is a virtue that is heavily rewarded in viewing this stellar film from one of the most creative directors working in the world today.

Bestick,"[2, 3]","The triumph of Director Zhang Yimou's epic film is how deeply he makes us care about ordinary people buffeted by history and struggling to surmount their own frailty.  Fugui (a great performance by Ge You) starts out as a weak, spoiled young man addicted to the roll of the dice.  After losing his house, wife Jiazhen (a sensitive turn by Gong Li) and child, Fugui emerges from his self inflicted purgatory vowing to stand by his family.  He hits the road to make money as a puppet master, only to get gang pressed into the Kaomintang and later into Mao's Communist army.  Released after the civil war, he heads home desperate to slip quietly in to daily life under the new Communist order.History has a way of imposing itself on people living in ideological societies.  This film is so effective because Zhang makes his political points through the particularity of what happens to Fugui and his family.  Fugui and Jiazhen's young son bears the brunt of the senseless sacrifices demanded by Mao's Great Leap Forward.  What happens to their daughter and her husband brings home the inmates-running-the-asylum feel of the Cultural Revolution.  Like Zhang's Not One Less, this film is subversive precisely because it doesn't club you with its social messages.  You watch, you feel, and you draw your own conclusions about how the Communist rulers are meeting the needs of the Chinese people.To Live covers a broad swath of time, from the 1940s to the 70s.  The story unfolds with a seemingly effortless flow that reveals Zhang's true artistry.  The compositions, whether it's a landlord's palace or a peasant's alley, are perfectly staged.  Every actor's gesture serves the larger plot.  The pacing propels you through the story but pauses just long enough to let you absorb the big emotional moments.

The film chronicles the lives of a married couple, Fugui and Jiazhen, from the 1940s, prior to the Communist takeover, to the 1970s in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution.  Despite many heartbreaking hardships, they remain committed to each other and to their family.  The film gave me as a Westerner an instructive introduction to modern Chinese history through the life experience of this family.  It also offers a compelling example of marital and familial loyalty.That this film was made in Communist China is remarkable.  In a low-key but pointed manner, the movie is very critical of the Communist Chinese system.  A Chinese student friend informed me that the film was banned from movie theaters in China, although one could find it on video/dvd.  The film shows the negative consequences of Communism's ceaseless public pressure to accomplish various goals and insure social conformity.  Fugui's precious puppets are almost destroyed in the 1950's as part of a community drive to produce steel and are finally destroyed completely in the 1960's to shield the family from scrutiny during the Cultural Revolution.  Fugui is fearfully eager to prove that he and his family are loyal supporters of the Revolution given their wrong social origins as members of the upper classes.  He frantically retrieves his letter of commendation from the Communist army when his wife nearly ruins it in the laundry.  The letter is carefully framed and provides them with important political protection.  His fears of not fitting in with Communist society and possibly being targeted as a troublemaker or enemy of the state lead to the death of their precious son.  After days without adequate rest because of the mass effort to meet their area's steel quota, Fugui overrides his wife's wish to let their son sleep and miss school because an important Communist political functionary will be visiting the school.  In a heavily symbolic moment, the overtired functionary, who has fallen asleep at the wheel, crashes into a wall killing the overtired and also sleeping son.  The Communist leader turns out to be Fugui's old friend who had worked with him in the traveling puppet theater and served with him when both were forced into the Communist army.  While optimism and benevolent social goals mark Communist society at the time, the system also created an atmosphere of fear and conformity.  Fugui and his family, as well as his former friend the Communist bureaucrat are all suffering.A generation later during the Cultural Revolution, the pathology of Communism has worsened.  The fanatical cadres of younger Communists turn on the older generations, including the old Communist leaders, doctors, scientists, intellectuals, artists, and professionals.  The requirements for social conformity have only intensified.  In the tragic climax of the film, Fugui and Jiazhen's only surviving child dies in childbirth because all the doctors have been expelled from the hospitals by the zealous Marxist students.  What was once a mix of hopeful altruism and oppressive force has degenerated into outright insanity.But Fugui and Jiazhen survive this senseless and entirely avoidable tragedy as they have survived so much already.  This is the film's final word--that the strength of the Chinese people, rooted in fidelity to marriage and family--will withstand personal failings as well as large political and social forces, even the anti-human and anti-Chinese Marxist system.It is well-known how much China has distanced itself from the Cultural Revolution and even the central economic philosophy of traditional Marxism.  The Chinese enjoy much greater economic and personal freedom than in that sad era.  Yet political and religious freedoms are still greatly circumscribed, as the anniversary of Tianamen Square and the present experience of many Chinese Christians remind us.  But the Chinese people, strong and resilient, will continue to seek for that better life that all mankind hopes for.",5,A Window into Communist China,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,4078,"['Live', 'outstanding', 'film', 'directed', 'talented', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'film', 'lives', 'married', 'couple', 'Fugui', 'Jiazhen', '1940s', 'prior', 'Communist', 'takeover', '1970s', 'aftermath', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'many', 'heartbreaking', 'hardships', 'remain', 'committed', 'other', 'family', 'film', 'gave', 'Westerner', 'instructive', 'introduction', 'modern', 'Chinese', 'history', 'life', 'experience', 'family', 'also', 'compelling', 'example', 'marital', 'familial', 'loyalty.That', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Communist', 'China', 'remarkable', 'low-key', 'pointed', 'manner', 'movie', 'very', 'critical', 'Communist', 'Chinese', 'system', 'Chinese', 'student', 'friend', 'informed', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'movie', 'theaters', 'China', 'one', 'could', 'find', 'video/dvd', 'film', 'negative', 'consequences', 'Communism', 'ceaseless', 'public', 'pressure', 'accomplish', 'various', 'goals', 'insure', 'social', 'conformity', 'Fugui', 'precious', 'puppets', 'are', 'almost', 'destroyed', '1950', 'part', 'community', 'drive', 'produce', 'steel', 'are', 'finally', 'destroyed', 'completely', '1960', 'shield', 'family', 'scrutiny', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'Fugui', 'fearfully', 'eager', 'prove', 'family', 'are', 'loyal', 'supporters', 'Revolution', 'given', 'wrong', 'social', 'origins', 'members', 'upper', 'classes', 'frantically', 'letter', 'commendation', 'Communist', 'army', 'when', 'wife', 'nearly', 'laundry', 'letter', 'carefully', 'framed', 'important', 'political', 'protection', 'fears', 'not', 'fitting', 'Communist', 'society', 'possibly', 'being', 'targeted', 'troublemaker', 'enemy', 'state', 'lead', 'death', 'precious', 'son', 'days', 'adequate', 'rest', 'mass', 'effort', 'meet', 'area', 'steel', 'quota', 'Fugui', 'wife', 'wish', 'let', 'son', 'sleep', 'miss', 'school', 'important', 'Communist', 'political', 'functionary', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'school', 'heavily', 'symbolic', 'moment', 'overtired', 'functionary', 'who', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'crashes', 'wall', 'killing', 'overtired', 'also', 'sleeping', 'son', 'Communist', 'leader', 'out', 'be', 'Fugui', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'traveling', 'puppet', 'theater', 'served', 'when', 'were', 'forced', 'Communist', 'army', 'optimism', 'benevolent', 'social', 'goals', 'mark', 'Communist', 'society', 'time', 'system', 'also', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'conformity', 'Fugui', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'former', 'friend', 'Communist', 'bureaucrat', 'are', 'suffering.A', 'generation', 'later', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'pathology', 'Communism', 'worsened', 'fanatical', 'cadres', 'younger', 'Communists', 'turn', 'older', 'generations', 'including', 'old', 'Communist', 'leaders', 'doctors', 'scientists', 'intellectuals', 'artists', 'professionals', 'requirements', 'social', 'conformity', 'have', 'only', 'intensified', 'tragic', 'climax', 'film', 'Fugui', 'Jiazhen', 'only', 'surviving', 'child', 'dies', 'childbirth', 'doctors', 'have', 'been', 'expelled', 'hospitals', 'zealous', 'Marxist', 'students', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'mix', 'hopeful', 'altruism', 'oppressive', 'force', 'degenerated', 'outright', 'insanity.But', 'Fugui', 'Jiazhen', 'survive', 'senseless', 'entirely', 'avoidable', 'tragedy', 'have', 'survived', 'so', 'much', 'already', 'film', 'final', 'word', 'strength', 'Chinese', 'people', 'rooted', 'fidelity', 'marriage', 'family', 'will', 'withstand', 'personal', 'failings', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'political', 'social', 'forces', 'even', 'anti-human', 'anti-Chinese', 'Marxist', 'system.It', 'well-known', 'how', 'much', 'China', 'distanced', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'even', 'central', 'economic', 'philosophy', 'traditional', 'Marxism', 'Chinese', 'enjoy', 'much', 'greater', 'economic', 'personal', 'freedom', 'sad', 'era', 'political', 'religious', 'freedoms', 'are', 'still', 'greatly', 'circumscribed', 'anniversary', 'Tianamen', 'Square', 'present', 'experience', 'many', 'Chinese', 'Christians', 'remind', 'Chinese', 'people', 'strong', 'resilient', 'will', 'continue', 'seek', 'better', 'life', 'mankind', 'hopes']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[6, 7]","After watching this last night it's a shame that not more people have seen this movie, judging by the amount of reviews and ratings. Now that director Yimou Zhang ('Hero' & 'House of Flying Daggers') has become more popular, I'm hoping this will change.'Huozhe' or 'To Live' takes us on a trip in China that will last us from the 40's through the 70's. Through that time, we will see life through eyes Fugui and Jiazhen, a husband and wife with 2 children, as well as Fugui's mother. Others here have called it a Chinese `Gone with the Wind,' but in this respect it's more like a Chinese `Les Mis&eacute;rables,' albeit on a smaller scale. What's most remarkable about it is how it manages to be both a political film and an objective one--it judges the political happenings that serve as its backdrop, yes, but we never get the sense that it is PRE-judging them. `Huozhe' is no propaganda film--it allows its events to unfold organically, and allows us to infer its meaning on our own.Not once is this movie boring, effectively placing us there, with the family. The acting seems so natural that it feels like you are there, traveling with them, rather then viewing them through a camera. This of course shows the strength of Zhang's directing. You Ge plays Fugui, a popular actor in China, won the award for the Cannes Film Festival. Li Gong is beautiful, and portrays her character with such passion, it's no wonder she has been nominated nearly a dozen times, winning most.Emotional without being sappy, honest, & historically accurate, the film does have a black shroud covering it. In times of sadness, it's lifted a bit to allow us to see happiness, indeed, life, pull this family together. It even has bits of humor in it, at times, I laughed along with the family as much as I felt their pain. Little details, such paintings in the background that chip away as time goes by, shows how much care went into making this film. Characters that seem unimportant become part of the story later.What a wonderful film.

The film is shot with excellent color, sets, costumes, dialogue, direction, and acting.  There are scenes of dynamic proportions and others of dynamic emotions.  By the time the film came to a close, I was almost in awe of what I had seen.  It reminds me of the movie ""The Last Emporer"" and the book ""One Man's Bible"" although the former covers a much larger scope of history.I was aware of most of this history having read about it in the newspapers as it was happening.  However, I have to admit that the Cultural Revolution and other changes were confusing but ""To Live"" gives a good understanding of the effect, if not the cause, of these events.  I understand that the writer and director were disciplined for their artistic endeavors in this movie.  It isn't surprizing given the clear political statement that is made about the arbitrary nature of the purges.Post WWII Chinese history is complex and so is their culture.

157814,A1D3KO8LSOQ3M2,0792899180,"Reader ""wyj3""","[0, 4]","There is a subtle emphasis on food in the two movies of Yimou Zhang that I have seen, but no plain indication of the Great Chinese Famine of 1958-1961, brought on by the so-called Great Leap Forward to an extent that has been debated.  But the historical fact of it is not debated, whatever the whole truth about its causes and whatever the toll, whether 15 million or 36 million.  Perhaps Chinese audiences do not need to be reminded of it, but some occidental audiences might need to understand this much about the meaning of a plate of food in such movies.The movie hardly brings out the worst of the prolonged cataclysms protrayed incidentally: the civil war, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.  The war scenes are handled in a stylized rather than realistic manner, but this is typical of movies all over the world.  Blood and guts, pain and misery, death and destruction, realistically portrayed, in such quantity as war makes for, all for somebody's stubborn greed, would have all the banality of evil and hardly be entertaining or even interesting.  The terribly costly political mistakes are not portrayed in their fullness either.  When the Red Guards, who in reality caused so much destruction, appear, the movie's squad of them turns out to be exceptional, being led by a shrewd, good-hearted guy.  So in this sense of not showing how bad these chapters of history really were, the movie could be considered propaganda.  But anybody inclined to dismiss the movie as propaganda should see it and consider how even propaganda has to appeal to already existing values of the target population.  This movie appeals to, or counts on, primary values of simple, suffering humanity, values that I hope Americans share.  It is remarkable that the movie was allowed to be made in China at all; I hope that it can be shown in China.After hearing the downright weird voices in the puppet shows and reflecting on them, I realized that our own animated cartoons use strange voices, too.Personally I think that anybody interested in China should read of Gladys Aylward and other Christians before the Communist take-over.  See, for example, _Gladys Aylward:  the Little Woman_ (ISBN 0802429866), not the movie made about her, _The Inn of the Sixth Happiness_, which distorts reality quite unnecessarily.The more profound the art, the more to be sought is He who gave many convincing proofs of His having risen from the dead -- for His, not Chairman Mao's, are the words that will not pass away although heaven and earth will -- and the more memorable is the question, ""Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into the sky?""

Following a fairly prosaic plot line about a married couple during three decades of huge upheaval in China (1940s-60s), the film manages to wind around you insidiously and you find yourself uncontrollably immersed. Indeed, the plot is merely the delivery method for a much deeper message.Ge You and Gong Li play husband and wife, enduring self-inflicted tragedy after tragedy, yet clinging to the fundamental sanctuary of family, love, and devotion. The backdrop of Chinese history provides a tempting palate for Yimou to expostulate, yet he avoids making a film that focuses on political commentary. He chooses instead to focus on a greater story; no matter how difficult the circumstances, people rely on love and family to heroically struggle onward and survive, as the deceptively simple title implies.It is hard to imagine a more tragic and yet hopeful movie than To Live. It spotlights our humanity in ways that are as uplifting as they are somber.
