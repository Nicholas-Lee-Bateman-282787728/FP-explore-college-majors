553268,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B00004W1ZO,Carl Malmstrom,"[6, 8]","There is nothing new to anime in the first DVD of Dual.  Everything that does not smack of a previously issued AIC series (like Tenchi Muyo, El-Hazard or Photon) is obviously borrowed from Gainax's Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Even some of the characters can be best summarized as hybrids of existing characters: Kazuki, the male lead, is Eva's Shinji crossed with El-Hazard's Makoto.  Mitsuki's father owes equal parts to Gendo Ikari (Eva, again) and Fujisawa-sensei (El-Hazard, again) and possibly even Nobuyuki, Tenchi's father.That said, though, the series is just plain fun.  Possibly more than any other AIC Series I've seen so far, it knows how to have subtle fun with itself.  You know what's coming and the series has fun with that.  Nothing's original, but nothing's boring, either.  Somehow, the producers once again find a way to make you wonder about the fate of the characters (and the world[s] they inhabit) even though, if it's anything like Tenchi, El-Hazard or Photon (and it probably will be), the answers are probably quite obvious.I highly recommend this disc even though there's nothing really new about it.  It's a lot of fun.  It was the first anime series in quite some time to make me actively eager for the next installment to come out.",4,"Unoriginal, Yet Oddly Compelling",977011200,"12 17, 2000",2000,1260,"['nothing', 'new', 'anime', 'first', 'DVD', 'Dual', 'Everything', 'not', 'smack', 'previously', 'issued', 'AIC', 'series', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'El-Hazard', 'Photon', 'obviously', 'borrowed', 'Gainax', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Even', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'summarized', 'hybrids', 'existing', 'characters', 'Kazuki', 'male', 'lead', 'Eva', 'Shinji', 'crossed', 'El-Hazard', 'Makoto', 'Mitsuki', 'father', 'equal', 'parts', 'Gendo', 'Ikari', 'Eva', 'again', 'Fujisawa-sensei', 'El-Hazard', 'again', 'possibly', 'even', 'Nobuyuki', 'Tenchi', 'father.That', 'said', 'series', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'Possibly', 'more', 'other', 'AIC', 'Series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'how', 'have', 'subtle', 'fun', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'series', 'fun', 'Nothing', 'original', 'nothing', 'boring', 'either', 'Somehow', 'producers', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'wonder', 'fate', 'characters', 'world', '[', 's', ']', 'inhabit', 'even', 'anything', 'Tenchi', 'El-Hazard', 'Photon', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'answers', 'are', 'probably', 'quite', 'obvious.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disc', 'even', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'lot', 'fun', 'was', 'first', 'anime', 'series', 'quite', 'time', 'make', 'actively', 'eager', 'next', 'installment', 'come', 'out']",N/A

You can see plenty of Evangelion ideas here to be used as &quot;Netas&quot; for fun.  The hero is compared to Shinji, Mitsuki (Heroine) as Shouryu Asuka and Ms.  D as Ayanami Rei.The world setting is a parallel world with ancient  artifacts, and there is an evil(?) non-profit organization who wants to  conquer the world...From the director who created the &quot;Tenji&quot;  world, you can observe that some Tenji ideas (e.g. Harlem Home) are being  used here. Also, the Gundam-Fight ideas from G-Gundam. Some 3D CG  animations were used but I consider it as a failed trial here, you can  easily tell which scenes are created by 3D modeling because they're too  fake.It'll be in the amusing type. About 4 out of 5 stars, nice rhymes  and smooth motions.

553270,ALE78K49RKLE9,B00004W1ZO,"""gabeegs""","[4, 5]","AIC has done a really wonderfull thing and taken two series and combined them into one. I know that this will lead to people getting upset about it stealing from &quot;their&quot; favorite shows.  That's why it seems so familar to everyone.  I love Neon Genesis and I love the Tenchi Muyo OVAs, so to me this seems like the best of both worlds.  I love the way that the characters interact with each other just like they do in Tenchi. Some charaters don't seem to be to well thought out and don't have too much feeling to them.  That can be attributed to the length of this series though.  I found that the story moves right along making you smile and laugh.... sorry it's not as serious as neon genesis is but it does have some exciting mecha battles.  You'll find yourself rooting for your favorite girl to hook up with Kazuki. There is just a whole lot of fun in viewing this anime. This first DVD out of four deals with setting up the characters and the situation. There are some hidden things on these discs that are pretty neat that wil enhance the viewing experince of the series(there are secrets on all the discs). The animation is really pretty darn good with a style like that of Tenchi Muyo.  I gave this series a 5 because they were just as fun as the tenchi series were, and since I am a huge fan of Tenchi then what else could I have given this?  The only thing about this series that I absolutely hated was the inclusion of the CGI. They detracted from the viewing experience and they did not blend well with the animation.  Yuk!!!!  If you are a fan of Tenchi Muyo then you can't afford to miss these.",5,Tenchi + Neon Genesis = Dual,993427200,"06 25, 2001",2001,1618,"['AIC', 'done', 'really', 'wonderfull', 'thing', 'taken', 'two', 'series', 'combined', 'one', 'know', 'will', 'lead', 'people', 'getting', 'upset', 'stealing', 'quot', 'quot', 'favorite', 'shows', 'why', 'so', 'familar', 'everyone', 'love', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'love', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'OVAs', 'so', 'best', 'worlds', 'love', 'way', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'just', 'do', 'Tenchi', 'charaters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'length', 'series', 'found', 'story', 'moves', 'right', 'making', 'smile', 'laugh', 'sorry', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'neon', 'genesis', 'have', 'exciting', 'mecha', 'battles', ""'ll"", 'find', 'rooting', 'favorite', 'girl', 'hook', 'up', 'Kazuki', 'just', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'viewing', 'anime', 'first', 'DVD', 'four', 'deals', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'situation', 'are', 'hidden', 'things', 'discs', 'are', 'pretty', 'neat', 'wil', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'experince', 'series', 'are', 'secrets', 'discs', 'animation', 'really', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'style', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'gave', 'series', '5', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'tenchi', 'series', 'were', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tenchi', 'then', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'only', 'thing', 'series', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'was', 'inclusion', 'CGI', 'detracted', 'viewing', 'experience', 'did', 'not', 'blend', 'well', 'animation', 'Yuk', 'are', 'fan', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'miss']",N/A
553271,A873NN1HNDUG8,B00004W1ZO,Minh Doan,"[0, 0]","To sum it up, I would call this one &quot;Evangelion - Light&quot;.Basically, it is the story of a boy suddenly trapped in an alternate world were he must cope with piloting a giant battle robot (called Core Robot) in an ongoing war, while being in the middle of a love tug-of-war with three girls (a fourth one coming up on the 3rd DVD/VHS!).Oddly, I feel the driving force of the story was not the large-scale robot battles, but the often-humorous burden of the main character of being the object of affection of several girls, all of who are or was a pilot of those Core Robots.  And it shows that he is in it over his head!As for the ending of the series, all I can say about it (without spoiling it) is that it is... odd.A VERY subjective opinion here, for those who prefer the subtitled versions: I think the dubbing was excellent, never too often overdone.  This is one of those rare anime shows where you would rather listen to it in dubbed English than subtitled.

553272,A1N2E1GTHUSG7P,B00004W1ZO,Ryoko's Husband,"[0, 0]","Greetings;In the span of but a single moment, the fate of the world is changed. A construction worker is told to dispose of an alien artifact off of the site he is working on, in one scenario, he simply tosses the strange stone-like device into the back of a dump truck, in another, he pockets the device. In the world that the main character Kazuki inhabits, the device was simply tossed away and the world was able to continue on more or less as it was meant to. The boy however, it would seem, is a kind of x-factor in the alternate world where the device was kept and studied and for this, he is able to see much of that alternate plane...I would not of course want to give away too much, though I have indeed watched the whole series through and loved it, the final episode was very Tenchi-esque, that is to say episode 14, touches on the whole, why not have it all feeling you get from Tenchi Muyo. I especially loved it when the 'evil' leader's wife from the alternate universe tries over and again to get Kazuki to seduce her daughter for the sake of forcing him to marry her and therefore inherit the specialized mecha that he comes to pilot, moreover his own special abilities to operate it.As some have mentioned, many times it does indeed seem to feel a great deal like el-hazard, which was indeed a series done by the folks behind Tenchi, though overall not quite nearly as famous. Something interesting you will notice watching the show is that each of the women who end up in Kazuki's life tend to have a unique cooking style. One prepares Japanese cuisines, another Chinese and so forth. With the 4 volues I bought to the dvd series, the insert page that comes inside the dvd case, the one that usually tells you the episode titles and chapter selections, it lists out what is, or as near as I can tell, the speciality of the main, featured woman. Some don't come out and list who's it is, though there is always a picture of them. A picture of the actual dish and the recipe guide, which I always found to be a nice personalization. I also received decal in one of my copies, the kind you would hang in a mirror or a window, clear, with one of the girls posed, almost cel-like. Could possibly be one in each, but several if not all of mine were used copies, so that is difficult for me to say at this time.This is just a personal opinion, but I really didn't mind the soundtrack either for that matter.Oh, something else I remember. Back when the series was consideribly newer, back when you could also find it on a number of vhs tapes, I remember reading about it. It was compared more to tenchi muyp gxp, which, it is sort of reminescent of, yes. The special mecha Kazuki ends up piloting is the same one that Seina Yamada in GXP ends the series operating. Kazuki even is able to summon light hawk wings, which is a Jurai power, so there is certainly that element for a crossover. I even recall reading about how a number of characters from GXP are seen here and vice versa, though this isn't something I am able to confirm as I have never bothered to investigate this, though I honestly don't doubt it at all.Thank you and take care...",5,Big Tench Muyo fan.
