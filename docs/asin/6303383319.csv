But I was disapointed to be truthful. I love SNL movies, but this was probably the worst. Pat was funny...in some parts. But the hour  and eighteen minutes that this movie last...it lags on. They could of made  this a thirty minute short TV thing. I was disapointed to see Dave Foley in  drag...again. I was glad to see Tim Meadows with a small role, he needs to  get off of SNL and move on with his career or just find something else to  do. Kathy Griffin was horrible, I just wanted her to go away.

371438,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303383319,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","I was floored going through all the reviews of ""It's Pat"".  There were a plethora of one and five star reviews but little in the middle which is where my opinion lies.  Julia Sweeney's Pat is an inspired creation that worked as an occasional SNL skit.  My favorite sketch involved Pat being stranded on a desert island with Harvey Keitel.  In voiceover Keitel reveals that he still hasn't discovered Pat's gender after numerous sexual encounters. There's nothing wrong with Sweeney's performance who in real life is a beautiful woman.  The mere fact that she keeps you guessing at the ambiguity of her character's gender is all the more amazing.  Equally fine is Dave Foley as Pat's beau Chris.  There's real chemistry and electricity, literally and figuratively, between he and Sweeney.  The problem is there's not much of a story here or possibly the one-joke nature of the premise is stretched way too thin.  Even the Roxbury boys made a more satisfying film out of very little.  When this played theatrically, if it lasted very long or was tested in many markets, it was savaged by the critics.  That's entirely unfair because this is not a bad movie just a very slight one.

371442,AVGX4BYF7J559,6303383319,"Jer ""kingjer151""","[1, 1]","SynopsisThis film was directed by Adam Bernstein. An androgynous person tries to answer the hard questions in life about love and their career and evaluate themselves. His/Her friends also have a hard time trying to figure out their gender. If I was Pats friend I would be trying to get into bed with them so I could find out their gender. Some androgynous people turn me on.Plot RatingWe've seen all of this before. Trying to find out who you are, where your going in life but the added twist of trying to figure out Pat's gender throughout the whole movie is a great thing. If Pat wasn't enough you are also trying to figure out the gender of Pats love interest and how exactly they have sex. My mind is full of interesting details on how that is done. My recurring thought is that they both have male and female genitalia and they stick them in their own holes. The gender confusing one liners are a lot of fun. The plot gets a 8/10Actor/ActressesJulia Sweeney does a great job at playing the gender bender character who struggles at finding the perfect job and mate for him/herself. She truly does carry the movie with some slapstick comedy and gender queer antics. Dave Foley plays Pat's counter part and that relationship makes trying to find out Pats gender all the more confusing. The best line is ""I love to stroke your pussy pat"". Charles Rocket does a great job at playing Kyle. Pats obsessed neighbor who will stop at nothing to find out the gender of this intriguing person. I use to be obsessed with people and look how I turned out. (I'm pretty much a stalker with people now). He is another character that carries the movie. It's interesting what happens to him at the end of the movie. So don't get lazy and not watch the credits. The people in the movie were convincing but not the greatest. I give their acting ability a 7/10.DVD ExtrasThis movie comes from Walt Disney video. Unfortunately for this one there are no special features. People need to learn that there are viewers that want to see commentaries, interviews, deleted scenes, etc. I give this a 0/10Personal ThoughtsThis movie isn't going to win academy awards or be a bestseller but it is a great movie to chuckle at and argue with your friends at what sex Pat really is. Again, it's a shame that there weren't any interviews because I think they would have been hilarious since it seemed like they had a good time making the film.It's Pat gives us a taste at what it would be like to be a gender queer person living an everyday life and it's something that I haven't seen in a movie in awhile.

I always enjoyed SNL when Julia was on the show and Pat was one of her best characters.  However, this movie wore through the carpet to the pad below.  They literally exhausted everything that could be considered good about the character.  Pat was so out of touch that she literally became irritating.  I ended up not liking her at all and couldn't wait for the movie to end.  I was on my tablet 2/3 of the way through, while my girlfriend continued to watch.
