804195,A3CJE9CW4TNW7P,B0001GF2GU,Benjamin E. Cressy,"[8, 15]","ABOUT THE DISC...The color transfer on this disc is great.  Everything is vibrant and sharp Unfortunately, it was shot with the ratio of 2.00:1 and we see it in 1.77:1 (it was released in some theaters this way).  The 2.0 Mono sound mix is in good shape, too. The only extras are subtitles, scene selections and a trailer. The movie was shot with 2 different endings and it would have been nice to see the 2nd ending included as a supplement.ABOUT THE MOVIE... (FROM MY WEBSITE, [...])Veteran director Robert Aldrich tried to re-work the success of ""The Dirty Dozen"" with a blatantly anti-war remake, ""Too Late the Hero"". Unfortunately, an able cast is wasted in this very anti-war effort, which plays out more like an anti-Vietnam allegory than a tale of wartime heroics.In the spring of 1942, American Lt. Lawson (Cliff Robertson, ""Up from the Beach"") sits lazily on a Pacific island, doing everything possible to avoid hazardous duties. Captain Nolan (Henry Fonda, in a one-scene cameo) disrupts his comfort with a hazardous assignment. Lawson is flown to the New Hebrides for a cooperative mission with the British. We find that the British hold one end of the island; the Japanese hold the other. Lawson and a patrol will penetrate enemy territory to destroy a vital radio station.At first, the film seems utterly predictable. Lawson is a type we've seen before - an unlikely soldier who redeems himself heroically by the final act. But with the introduction of the English characters and their Japanese counterparts, all audience expectations are shattered. Captain Hornsby (Denholm Elliott), the unit commander, proves to be a bungling - and homosexual - idiot, and the men have no faith in him. Pvt. Hearne (Michael Caine, ""Play Dirty"") is obviously dis-satisfied with Hornsby's indecisive ""leadership"", and after his incompetence results in unnecessary deaths, Hearne breaks into an open rebellion. Before long, the mission goes downhill, and Lawson and Hearne find themselves united in a mutual struggle for survival behind enemy territory.Aldrich all-too-clearly means to convey a heavy-handed message that war is bad - very bad. He's got several points to make: officers are corrupt, cold-blooded incompetents. In one scene, Hornsby is seen to shoot wounded prisoners without flinching. In the past, typical Japanese characters have been portrayed universally as evil, murderous dogs. Here, Aldrich tries far too hard to humanize them. First, he introduces a sympathetic Japanese character, Major Yamaguchi (Ken Takakura) in the second half of the film. Yamaguchi is tall, handsome and compassionate - even though he is taunting the fleeing Allied soldiers over loudspeakers spread throughout the jungle. He urges them to surrender, promising good treatment - and seems utterly sincere.Secondly, Aldrich makes the English out as the villains. Pvt. Campbell (Ronald Fraser) is a coward who runs from battle, but also loots the bodies of dead soldiers - both English and Japanese. He stirs up dissension and even murders one of his own men who won't cooperate with an attempt to surrender to the Japanese. History has taught us just how badly the Japanese mistreated their prisoners and how cruel they were. Any movie that makes them out to be saints and paints the Allied forces as incompetent, murdering thieves needs to be scrutinized carefully. ""The Dirty Dozen"" made no attempts to glorify Nazism, and 11 of its 12 main characters, a band of criminals, found redemption through self-sacrifice.The ensemble cast is what holds this piece together. The actors are all very capable and seem sincere, despite the lunacy of much of the script. Robertson seems a comfortable lead, although Lawson's character is never totally fleshed out. As the film begins, he's obviously a coward, but steps into the role of leader far too easily in the second half. He doesn't seem to struggle with his previous notions of warfare or leadership, his role has suddenly shifted without explanation. Robertson is so good, though, that this can be overlooked somewhat and is forgivable. As Hearne, Caine is the real star of the film. He's just as cynical as Lawson, but is open and blunt about it. He knows that Hornsby is incapable of leading and isn't afraid to point it out to him, even if it means a threat of court-martial. Throughout, his arguments seem legitimate, and Caine always come across as completely sincere. Finally, Denholm Elliott is exceptionally fine as Hornsby. He doesn't seem to know his role as a leader-of-men too well, and this often results in the deaths of his men and, ultimately, a botched mission.The jungle locations are beautifully photographed by cinematographer Joseph Biroc, but never come across as particularly dark and foreboding. Here, gory death and destruction takes place among beautiful trees, ferns and flowers. Again, this is a film meant as an anti-Vietnam statement, and the jungle locations are a perfect setting.Unfortunately, as I've repeated ceaselessly, ""Too Late the Hero"" can't seem to decide supposed to be a movie about a jungle patrol in the New Hebrides in 1942, not a movie about a patrol in Cambodia in 1968. The social commentary on the Vietnam War is delivered too heavily and blatantly distorted. The characters garnish little sympathy, and there is not enough action to keep the slow, talkative pace flowing. As a drama, it almost succeeds; as the action spectacular the trailer claims, it is barely serviceable.",3,Movie is a Mixed Bag and the DVD is Slightly Lacking,1140393600,"02 20,

The fake anti-war beginning gets taken over by the pro-war middle and end. As usual, you have the ""i hate the army/navy"" soldier/sailor, but in the end, their true heroism comes out.  This is one of those movies that gives buddy war movies a good name. And pro-war movies. Cain and Robertson play off each other pretty good. I like 50s, 60s, & 70s Britiss actors just to listen to their accents(Burton, O'Toole, Harris, etc.) It's hard to imagine getting such a crappy mission with only 1 day before a 4-week leave period for Robertson. It is said that it had a message to tell about the Vietnam War at the time, but Robertsond and Cain play the ""die for my country"" heroes just with the right amount of cynicism and patriotism.

804198,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0001GF2GU,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[40, 43]","There's been any number of films made over the years about various conflicts, real and fictional, that take place during the terrible conflict known as World War II, many set in the European theatre, but we must also remember a great many battles also took place in the South Pacific, as the Allies faced an equally difficult and dangerous enemy in that of the Japanese forces.  In Too Late the Hero (1970), Robert Aldrich presents a strong and realistic tale of a small band of soldiers tasked to do the impossible on a relatively remote and insignificant island, in an effort to prevent the deaths of possibly thousands of allied soldiers.  Directed by Robert Aldrich (The Flight of the Phoenix, The Dirty Dozen, The Longest Yard), the film stars Oscar winners Michael Caine (Get Carter, Sleuth) and Cliff Robertson (Charly, Brainstorm).  Also appearing is Ian Bannen and Ronald Fraser (both appeared in Aldrich's earlier film Flight of the Phoenix), Harry Andrews (Theatre of Blood, Equus), Denholm Elliott (The House That Dripped Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark), Ken Takakura (Black Rain) along with a special guest appearance by Henry Fonda (12 Angry Men, Spencer's Mountain).As the film begins, set in the spring of 1942, we see Lieutenant Sam Lawson (Robertson) sunning himself on the beach of the relative safety of some Island in the South Pacific.  He hardly appears to fit the bill of a soldier committed to the war effort, as his only goal seems to be getting as far away from the conflict as possible with his skin intact.  This is learned during the ensuing argument he has with his commanding officer as he's given an assignment, interrupting his impending leave, that will take him to some remote island, forced to assist some British forces in their effort to aid American forces, specifically in terms of a convoy of ships traveling through dangerous, Japanese controlled waters.  Arriving on the remote island, which the British seem to have an uneasy (to say the least) co-existence with Japanese forces (the British reside on the south part, the Japanese on the north, and the middle more or less a no man's land), Lawson finds he's stuck with a rather odd squad of misfits, would be deserters, and soldiers more willing to self inflict wounds rather than fulfill their duties, the mission turns out to be one with little hope of survival, as it takes them deep into Japanese territory.  Somehow they manage to complete the mission (not without many casualties on both sides), but the survivors learn of a secret the Japanese would do anything to keep, and thus begins a race back to the British encampment, as the determined soldiers (what's left of them) are hounded incessantly by an equally determine force to keep their secret.I think the element I liked most about this film was the sense of realism within the characters, especially that of Caine and Robertson.  So often in films like this we're shown heroic characters who show little concern of sacrificing themselves for the greater good, and while that can make for a strong and up lifting story, presented here are characters that are more a bit more cynical, possessing the self preservation gene present in most of us normal, non-Hollywood character types.  I'm not saying they would turn against their own in order to do save their skins, but the instinct of self-preservation certainly seemed to outweigh their commitment to duty (sometimes the two elements align themselves, as they did in this film, so there is a sense of heroism, even though it's a tenuous mask).  The characters in this film may not be very appealing, but I think many of us could relate much more than we'd probably like to admit, if given we were in a similar situation.  Another thing I liked about this film was the portrayal of the Japanese forces, led by Major Yamaguchi (Takakura).  He wasn't a soulless, cruel leader, but only one intent on performing his task, even capable of acts of mercy (his offers of lenient treatment if the group surrendered seemed genuine after he went back on his promise to kill a couple of captured soldiers).  I'm not saying you're going to gain an affinity for the Japanese cause in terms of their role in the war by the end of the film, but by not pushing the vilification of the character, it provided a rich sense of depth to the role, and gave the feeling that the soldiers, no matter what side they fought on, shared some commonalities, despite the motivations of their respective leaders.  The pacing of the story was a little uneven at times, but it really picks up in the last half, as the men struggle to return to their safe haven.  I liked the dialogue throughout, and was impressed by a very strong supporting cast.  It was kind of odd seeing Bannen and especially Fraser essentially the same roles here as they did in Aldrich's The Flight of the Phoenix, but it worked there, and it works here.  I really liked Denholm Elliott's character of Captain Hornsby, a very determined sort who pushes forward, committed to completing his task, despite his inadequacies as a leader, and the fact that his charges have little or no faith in his abilities (some of the men got killed under dubious circumstances).  The film is filled with many tense scenes, as most of the story takes place in the thick of a claustrophobic jungle, but the tensest scenes occur at the end, during a deadly game of Red Rover.  All in all a great film, a bit on the lengthy side (it runs about 2 hours, 15 minutes).Initially Anchor Bay released the film on DVD in pan and scan and wide screen (1.85:1), but this MGM DVD release features only a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is clear and sharp here, and the audio comes through cleanly in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.  The only special feature available is a theatrical trailer for the film.Cookieman108",4,They could save thousands...or themselves.,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,5833,"['been', 'number', 'films',

The character studies and plot developments are a strange mix but it all seems to work thanks to Robert Aldrich's direction. Cliff Robertson is an American Navy Lieutenant sent on a mission in the New Hebrides in 1942 to destroy a Japanese radio site. Henry Fonda plays Captain Nolan who devices the mission and sends Robertson, fluent in Japanese, on his way to meet up with a British infantry patrol to execute the plan. Events go awry out in the jungle and Robertson finds himself at odds with a private played by Michael Caine.

The irony and ideology of the characters portrayed by Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson is at the heart of this drama and that is what makes this film succeed and very worthwhile.

But if you enjoy war films, and your tired of seeing the same story where the good guys win all the time. This one is for you. Too Late the Hero, has all the elements for a enjoyable war action film. This film shows, mistakes are made in war; not all go by the books, and it's not only the enemy that dies in battle. The film takes place in a jungle setting, where a simple patrol goes on a fateful mission, where things go wrong. You see some classic actors here; most British, and in my books the British made some of the best underrated war films out there, like Dunkirk, and Ice Cold In Alex. Definately worth owning the DVD on this one. Did you know when it went out of print on DVD by Anchor Bay Studios, it shot up to over 100.00 used? Good thing MGM re-released it here. But as with most MGM DVD's you won't get the inner sleeve, and you get one format here; widescreeen. If you find the Anchor Bay release you will get the wide and standard screen format, along with extras. Anchor Bay also released "" Hell in the Pacific "" in wide and standard format (also out of print, but re-released by MGM).

804205,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0001GF2GU,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Even the greatest directors sometimes make weak films. Robert Aldrich was a GIANT of cinema and some of his films achieved immortality - think only of ""Vera Cruz"", ""Dirty Dozen"", ""Attack"", ""Ulzana's raid"", ""Emperor of the North"" or ""What ever happened to Baby Jane"". This film however is, in my personal opinion, one of his weakest and I hardly managed to finish watching it and even had to fast forward some of the bits here and there... Some SPOILERS ahead...So what went wrong? First, the story. It doesn't make much sense. Launching a kind of ""suicide mission"" across the Japanese lines to destroy a radio station? REALLY? As if it was not simpler to send a squadron of bombers to simply blow it to smitherens, especially considering that everybody in the whole Pacific seems to know where this radio shack is... But OK, that is only a minor point.Then there is the length. This is a very long film in which people walk and fight and die a lot in a steamy jungle. So it should be an interesting war film - but for some reason, here it doesn't work. This whole film is simply BORING. I completely couldn't develop any attachement to anybody in it - in fact, convicted murderers in ""Dirty Dozen"" seemed to be nicer people than this bunch of permanently aggravated, depressed, bitching, moaning and very boring people. Even Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson couldn't make their characters interesting or likeable. As for Henry Fonda, he appears just in a cameo and his whole purpose seems to be just attracting attention by his name on the poster...In fact, the only person who is somehow interesting in the whole film is Captain Hornsby, a slightly hapless but nevertheless extremely courageous commander of the whole mission behind the Japanese lines, magistrally played by Denholm Elliott, who later played Dr. Markus Brody in ""Indiana Jones"" franchise... But he has not enough screen time...The fighting scenes are poorly filmed, there is absolutely no comparison with the deadly gunfights in ""Dirty Dozen"" or the incredible confrontation of Jack Palance's character with a Tiger tank in ""Attack"". Jeez, the fights are actually worse even than in ""Apache"", a western which aged so much but still remains a better Aldrich film than this one...Once the mission is accomplished and the surviving soldiers run for their lifes towards allied lines, this film could have been even better - but once again somehow it just doesn't work. The whole idea of Japanese soldiers chasing the British with giant camouflaged loudspeakers amused me greatly, but somehow I do not think this was the effect Robert Aldrich searched...The final ""running of the gauntlet"", supposedly dramatic, made me frankly laugh - for Christ sake, didn't anybody have the idea of just hide in a hole in the jungle and wait for the NIGHT?I feel bad when writing this review, because Robert Aldrich is one of my absolutely most favourite film makers and for 19 years he really ruled, from ""Apache"" in 1954 to ""The Emperor of the North"" in 1973. I was so impatient to discover this film, one of few by this director I didn't know yet - but my disappointment was cruel. So, even if it is with a broken heart, I simply can not give to this film more than two stars, because it bored me almost to death and made me waste a whole evening which I will never get back.",2,"""Oh no lieutenant!

Sam Lawson is about to go on a 4-week leave when he is called upon to take part in one more mission.  On a small island in the New Hebrides, Lawson joins a group of British misfits as they plan to march across the island and destroy a Japanese radio outpost.  Upon completing their mission, albeit with a few casualties, the survivors discover something that could save the lives of thousands of Allied troops.  Can they get back to their base before their Japanese pursuers cut them off?  The jungle setting is perfect and it adds to a building sense of being trapped by the end of the movie.  The movie clocks in at 144 minutes and tends to drag a bit in the middle but overall, director Robert Aldrich has made a very effective anti-war film.  Enough action to keep the story moving, and a climax that will have you on the edge of your seat.Michael Caine leads the way as Pvt. Tosh Hearne, the Cockney medic who makes no bones about his disgust with the mission, Lawson, and his inept commanding officer.  Caine was perfect for the part of this sarcastic trooper.  Cliff Robertson is very good as Lt. Sam Lawson, an American officer who speaks Japanese who must accompany the British patrol on their mission. The dialogue between Caine and Robertson provides some of the movie's high points.  The patrol includes Ian Bannen as the crazy Pvt. Thornton, Ronald Fraser as the cowardly Pvt. Campbell, Denholm Elliot as the inept Capt. Hornsby, and Percy Herbert as the veteran Sgt. Johnstone.  Henry Fonda even makes a brief one-scene appearance as Nolan, Lawson's commanding officer.  Ken Takakura is excellent is Major Yamaguchi, the Japanese officer pursuing the patrol across the island.  The bare-bones DVD offers widescreen presentation and a theatrical trailer.
