It was Edward Furlong's best work since American History X, the first scene with Michael Berryman was so well-done it gave me shivers, and Ostensen and screenwriter Signe Olynyk, a TV writer working on her first big-screen presentation, were doing a bang-up job at keeping the parallel time structures in hand, keeping fantasy separated from reality without stupid &#8220;fuzzy camera&#8221; tricks, the works. This is a movie that had every hallmark of &#8220;you totally ignored this when it first came out and so I'm going to natter on about it to you endlessly until you sit down and watch it just to shut me up.&#8221;And then... the cliff raced up, and the movie didn't even attempt to swerve.Plot: Jack (Furlong), a screenwriter who had one big hit and then suffered a tremendous case of writers' block, has been sent by his agent to a farm in the middle of nowhere owned by Penny (Kristin Booth, who previously worked with Furlong in Detroit Rock City) and her autistic son, who takes a liking to Jack from the get-go. The goal: Penny will lock Jack in the farm's meat locker for five days to break his writer's block. (Jack's agent has given Penny a few other instructions Jack doesn't know about, it seems, and they are revealed over the course of the movie, leading to some freaky-yet-hilarious scenes.) Initially, it seems like it's working; Jack takes some of the things he and Penny experienced on the drive to the farm, conjures up a resident butcher for the farm named Gunnar (Berryman), and writes some really good stuff. And then... smack, there's the wall. Penny starts dropping in regularly with coffee, and of course she's written a script she wants Jack to look at, but the old joke turns out to have some legs, as Jack and Penny bounce ideas off one another, and Jack's script gets back on track. But nothing is ever as easy as it seems...There is so much to love about this movie. If I could pinpoint the moment where I could say &#8220;turn it off here and just imagine the ending&#8221;, I'd tell you to do that, because the first hour and change of this movie is well worth your time. This could have been the path to redemption for Edward Furlong's career that a handful of movies in the past decade tried to be and, ultimately, failed for some reason or other (usually because they suck, viz. Intermedio). For that matter, it could have been Michael Berryman's highest-profile performance since The Hills Have Eyes. Berryman is a very good actor when someone gives him a script that's got enough meat on the bone for him to sink his teeth into it, and it shows here better than, perhaps, it ever has; the portions of this film containing Berryman are its best. I won't go so far as to say he's the only thing about the movie worth the price of admission&#8212;there's enough good in the rest of the first hour to keep you satisfied even when he's not on screen&#8212;but if you're used to seeing Berryman in bit parts and schlock like Brutal, prepare to be very pleasantly surprised. If only they hadn't managed to completely blow the ending. **",2,Negative Kelvin.,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,3231,"['Zero', 'Justin', 'Thomas', 'Ostensen', '2011', 'hour', 'Justin', 'Thomas', 'Ostensen', 'first', 'fictional', 'feature', 'Zero', 'was', 'ready', 'sing', 'movie', 'praises', 'was', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'best', 'work', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'first', 'scene', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'was', 'so', 'well-done', 'gave', 'shivers', 'Ostensen', 'screenwriter', 'Signe', 'Olynyk', 'TV', 'writer', 'working', 'first', 'big-screen', 'presentation', 'were', 'doing', 'bang-up', 'job', 'keeping', 'parallel', 'time', 'structures', 'hand', 'keeping', 'fantasy', 'separated', 'reality', 'stupid', '8220', 'fuzzy', 'camera', '8221', 'tricks', 'works', 'movie', 'had', 'hallmark', '8220', 'totally', 'ignored', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'so', ""'m"", 'going', 'natter', 'endlessly', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'just', 'shut', 'up.', '8221', 'then', 'cliff', 'raced', 'up', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'swerve.Plot', 'Jack', 'Furlong', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'big', 'hit', 'then', 'suffered', 'tremendous', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'been', 'sent', 'agent', 'farm', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'owned', 'Penny', 'Kristin', 'Booth', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'Furlong', 'Detroit', 'Rock', 'City', 'autistic', 'son', 'who', 'liking', 'Jack', 'get-go', 'goal', 'Penny', 'will', 'lock', 'Jack', 'farm', 'meat', 'locker', 'five', 'days', 'break', 'writer', 'block', 'Jack', 'agent', 'given', 'Penny', 'few', 'other', 'instructions', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'are', 'revealed', 'course', 'movie', 'leading', 'freaky-yet-hilarious', 'scenes', 'Initially', 'working', 'Jack', 'things', 'Penny', 'experienced', 'drive', 'farm', 'up', 'resident', 'butcher', 'farm', 'named', 'Gunnar', 'Berryman', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'then', 'smack', 'wall', 'Penny', 'dropping', 'regularly', 'coffee', 'course', 'written', 'script', 'Jack', 'look', 'old', 'joke', 'out', 'have', 'legs', 'Jack', 'Penny', 'bounce', 'ideas', 'off', 'one', 'Jack', 'script', 'back', 'track', 'nothing', 'ever', 'as', 'easy', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'could', 'pinpoint', 'moment', 'where', 'could', 'say', '8220', 'turn', 'off', 'here', 'just', 'imagine', 'ending', '8221', ""'d"", 'tell', 'do', 'first', 'hour', 'change', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'path', 'redemption', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'career', 'handful', 'movies', 'past', 'decade', 'tried', 'be', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'reason', 'other', 'usually', 'suck', 'viz', 'Intermedio', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'highest-profile', 'performance', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Berryman', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'when', 'someone', 'script', 'got', 'enough', 'meat', 'bone', 'sink', 'teeth', 'here', 'better', 'perhaps', 'ever', 'portions', 'film', 'containing', 'Berryman', 'are', 'best', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'price', 'admission', '8212', 'enough', 'good', 'rest', 'first', 'hour', 'keep', 'satisfied', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'screen', '8212', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Berryman', 'bit', 'parts', 'schlock', 'Brutal', 'prepare', 'be', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'managed', 'completely', 'blow', 'ending', '**']",N/A

If you're looking for blood and guts and lots of flesh, this isn't the film for you.  But if you enjoy a complex, compelling, and uniquely twisted plot-line that focuses on suspense and intrigue, you might actually find this film right up your alley.  It's refreshing to see independent filmmakers surpass the overused gore techniques and sexual concepts that are generally a cheap and lazy way to sell their film to an audience over-exposed and over-stimulated to the point that even serial killer films no longer garnish an emotion out of them.  For a change here is a horror film that requires the audience to think.  What a concept?  I, for one, would like to see more movies on this level.  I'm just about sick to death of the slasher splashers, the big-breasted dim-witted dumb blonde stars in heated sex scenes, and dialogue that specifically focuses on the usage of a four-letter word in every format possible.  As a horror fan I would like to consider myself a little more deserving of a challenging film such as Below Zero, where thought surpasses the visual eye-candy so many young horror viewers thrive on. Different generations have different concepts of what is considered a great horror film.  Like my husband said, ""Opinions are like #ssholes...everyone has one.""

1545232,A3BT78P0UT2Z5F,B0083K4NFW,The Brock Lesnar of Reviewing - The Most Hated,"[0, 0]","I didn't expect much from ""Below Zero"" and actually anticipated a below average movie but was pleasantly surprised by how this film played out in the end. Edward Furlong does a nice job as the main character, a writer with writers block who's agent has set up a week in the country to help get his creative juices flowing again with a little twist. At first I was skeptical thinking this to be an average movie about a writer writing a story with the scenes being shown to us as he types them but than I was surprised by the twists that will have you like ""huh"" at first, than ""wow"" afterwards.As I stated, Edward Furlong is the writer trying to create his next body of work, his agent sets him up in the country at a slaughterhouse with a goofy country woman and her very quite son. Once acquainted with his new surroundings he is locked up in a meat locker for 5 days thanks to a deal his agent made with the woman to help get his creative juices flowing again. As he starts writing, his story takes shape with a tow truck driver who crashes and finds a slaughterhouse where he looks for help but instead gets accidentally locked in the meat locker of a serial killer. We see each scene play out, twist and change as he writes them while events start happening around and outside of his room an slaughterhouse that will help change the out come of the movie and story being written.I enjoyed ""Below Zero"" and found the small cast to be quite good, Edward Furlong looks and acts better than the last time I saw him which was in ""Night of the Demons"". The twists and ending were actually quite nice and made me glad I took the time to check this film out. Overall I think ""Below Zero"" is a nice little indie gem that most people will be enable to enjoy in the end.",4,"""Below Zero Above Average""",1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1764,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Zero', 'actually', 'anticipated', 'below', 'average', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'end', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'nice', 'job', 'main', 'character', 'writer', 'writers', 'block', 'who', 'agent', 'set', 'up', 'week', 'country', 'help', 'get', 'creative', 'juices', 'flowing', 'again', 'little', 'twist', 'first', 'was', 'skeptical', 'thinking', 'be', 'average', 'movie', 'writer', 'writing', 'story', 'scenes', 'being', 'shown', 'was', 'surprised', 'twists', 'will', 'have', 'huh', 'first', 'wow', 'afterwards.As', 'stated', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'writer', 'trying', 'create', 'next', 'body', 'work', 'agent', 'sets', 'up', 'country', 'slaughterhouse', 'goofy', 'country', 'woman', 'very', 'quite', 'son', 'Once', 'acquainted', 'new', 'surroundings', 'locked', 'up', 'meat', 'locker', '5', 'days', 'thanks', 'deal', 'agent', 'made', 'woman', 'help', 'get', 'creative', 'juices', 'flowing', 'again', 'writing', 'story', 'shape', 'tow', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'slaughterhouse', 'where', 'help', 'instead', 'accidentally', 'locked', 'meat', 'locker', 'serial', 'killer', 'see', 'scene', 'play', 'out', 'twist', 'change', 'events', 'start', 'happening', 'around', 'room', 'slaughterhouse', 'will', 'help', 'change', 'out', 'come', 'movie', 'story', 'being', 'written.I', 'enjoyed', 'Zero', 'found', 'small', 'cast', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'better', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'Night', 'Demons', 'twists', 'ending', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'nice', 'made', 'glad', 'took', 'time', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'Overall', 'think', 'Zero', 'nice', 'little', 'indie', 'gem', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'enable', 'enjoy', 'end']",N/A

In northern rural America, he meets Penny (Kristin Booth) who has just the place. Penny is very likeable. She has the ""Fargo"" accent and laughs at her own jokes with a snort. She is single and says things like, ""You can make anything good with ketchup, just not a marriage."" She aspires to be an actress or a screenwriter, while she cares for her mute son.Once Jack is locked up in a room in a meat processing factory. The movie then becomes the account of his writing. But don't let this deter you from watching this film. Michael Berryman, the face of ""These Hills Have Eyes"" and an underrated actor becomes an unsavory character in the script. The film bounces back and forth from the script to Jack's imprisonment which is becoming more unbearable as the plot twists. Jack incorporates his surroundings and characters he meets into the story.At some point you have to ask yourself, ""Is there a limit on plot twists before the movie becomes a BOSH?"" This one approaches that number. In some ways this film reminded me of ""Misery"" i.e. a writer being tortured to write.I enjoyed the ending...at least I think that was the ending.

Jack (Furlong) is a struggling screen writer with a bad case of writer's block. Him and his agent come up with the idea of locking himself in a freezer until he finishes writing. While he is in the freezer writing about his serial killer the line between real and imagined begins to blur and Jack is finding it hard to distinguish what is real and what his mind is doing to him. This is another movie where the idea is better then the actual movie. While there are some creepy parts in this I found it confusing. The idea of Jack not able to tell what is real and what isn't is neat, but the problem is that the movie jumps all over the place and it is very hard to relax watching it because you never know what is going on. Normally that would be a good thing because you feel what the character is feeling but it comes off as being like there was a new writer every ten minutes and it was all cut together that way. I found it very hard to follow and by the end I found it hard to be surprised about the twist. Overall, not bad but a little confusing to follow.
