670684,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005NYFS,Alistair McHarg,"[4, 4]","Charles Bukowski, a man whose life and work unapologetically celebrate nihilism, once said there was no more depressing an environment than the track.  At the track, he maintained, one found life's most determined losers, people dedicated to despair and self-destruction.  Naturally, he himself was an habitue.Croupier immerses viewers in the same sort of bleak world, and it does so brilliantly.  With one carefully managed detail after another, the film offers up an insider's view of a closed community.  This vivid sense of place is the greatest success of Croupier, from the glossy facade to the crooked management to the jaundiced, cynical employees, everything is believable.  Our tour guide of this underworld is Jack, Clive Owen, who slithers through it with an aloof, pathological detachment.  Jack's unwillingness to gamble and hatred of cheaters becomes increasingly ironic as we learn how disingenuous he is.Jack belongs to that large human underclass that wants to profit from sin without being tainted.  Reserved and elegant in his tuxedo, (shades of Bond, James Bond), his methods and mannerisms have the beautiful precision of surgery.  He seems to be fed by the doom, the relentless defeat surrounding him, like a vampire.  In this regard he is indistinguishable from a pimp or a drug pusher, hiding behind a businesslike veneer, pretending to be guiltless, when in fact he is among the victimizers.Viewers slow to notice the ever-widening schism are reminded of it when Jack speaks of himself in the third person, (never a good sign when it comes to mental health).  Those who didn't notice this will surely smell a rat when he splits his identity in two, Jack (the real person) and Jake (the croupier).  While Jack may be smooth enough to sell himself this twaddle, his girlfriend, the thoroughly winning Gina McKee, notices his personality disintegrating.  At this point the film is really gathering steam and promises to be a chilling psychological drama like Memento or The Machinist.Unfortunately the third act consists almost entirely of Jokers, and no amount of Jokers adds up to 21.  Having Count Basie and Lester Young turn up in Jack's club and play It's A Small World After All for 45 minutes straight would have been more believable.  Converting the film into a cute twist, suspense thriller is a red herring fiesta, and smells about the same.  ER's Dr. Corday, Alex Kingston, is poorly cast as the femme fatale - although one scene reveals that she is assembled rather nicely.  The miraculous appearance of Jack's car is equally implausible, while the publication of his book is gratuitous.  Jack's response to his girlfriend's demise removes any empathy we might have left, while the puppet master role of his dad is beyond ludicrous.Overall, a terrific performance by Owens and clear-eyed look into a dark world - however, it disintegrates into facile card tricks better suited to a child's birthday party.",4,Les Jeus Sont Faits,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2940,"['Charles', 'Bukowski', 'man', 'life', 'work', 'unapologetically', 'celebrate', 'nihilism', 'once', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'depressing', 'environment', 'track', 'track', 'maintained', 'one', 'found', 'life', 'most', 'determined', 'losers', 'people', 'dedicated', 'despair', 'self-destruction', 'Naturally', 'was', 'habitue.Croupier', 'viewers', 'same', 'sort', 'bleak', 'world', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'one', 'carefully', 'managed', 'detail', 'film', 'up', 'insider', 'view', 'closed', 'community', 'vivid', 'sense', 'place', 'greatest', 'success', 'Croupier', 'glossy', 'facade', 'crooked', 'management', 'jaundiced', 'cynical', 'employees', 'everything', 'believable', 'tour', 'guide', 'underworld', 'Jack', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'aloof', 'pathological', 'detachment', 'Jack', 'unwillingness', 'gamble', 'hatred', 'cheaters', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'ironic', 'learn', 'how', 'disingenuous', 'is.Jack', 'belongs', 'large', 'human', 'underclass', 'profit', 'sin', 'being', 'tainted', 'Reserved', 'elegant', 'tuxedo', 'shades', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'methods', 'mannerisms', 'have', 'beautiful', 'precision', 'surgery', 'be', 'fed', 'doom', 'relentless', 'defeat', 'surrounding', 'vampire', 'regard', 'indistinguishable', 'pimp', 'drug', 'pusher', 'hiding', 'businesslike', 'veneer', 'pretending', 'be', 'guiltless', 'when', 'fact', 'victimizers.Viewers', 'slow', 'notice', 'ever-widening', 'schism', 'are', 'reminded', 'when', 'Jack', 'speaks', 'third', 'person', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'mental', 'health', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'will', 'surely', 'smell', 'rat', 'when', 'identity', 'two', 'Jack', 'real', 'person', 'Jake', 'croupier', 'Jack', 'may', 'be', 'smooth', 'enough', 'sell', 'twaddle', 'girlfriend', 'thoroughly', 'winning', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'personality', 'disintegrating', 'point', 'film', 'really', 'gathering', 'steam', 'promises', 'be', 'chilling', 'psychological', 'drama', 'Memento', 'Machinist.Unfortunately', 'third', 'act', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Jokers', 'amount', 'Jokers', '21', 'Having', 'Count', 'Basie', 'Lester', 'Young', 'turn', 'up', 'Jack', 'club', 'play', 'A', 'Small', 'World', 'All', '45', 'minutes', 'straight', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'Converting', 'film', 'cute', 'twist', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'red', 'herring', 'fiesta', 'same', 'ER', 'Dr.', 'Corday', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'poorly', 'cast', 'femme', 'fatale', 'one', 'scene', 'reveals', 'assembled', 'rather', 'nicely', 'miraculous', 'appearance', 'Jack', 'car', 'equally', 'implausible', 'publication', 'book', 'gratuitous', 'Jack', 'response', 'girlfriend', 'demise', 'empathy', 'might', 'have', 'left', 'puppet', 'master', 'role', 'dad', 'ludicrous.Overall', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Owens', 'clear-eyed', 'look', 'dark', 'world', 'however', 'facile', 'card', 'tricks', 'better', 'suited', 'child', 'birthday', 'party']",N/A

670686,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005NYFS,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","Nine years after its production, 'Croupier' is now remembered as the vehicle which shot Clive Owen into movie stardom...and rightfully so.  He's mesmerizing here in Mike Hodges' taut adaptation of Paul Mayersberg's beguiling script.  Mayersberg received an Edgar Allan Poe nomination for Best Screenplay. [NOTE: Amazon's sister site IMDB - in a delightfully goofy phonetic slip-up - notes that the Poe Awards ""honor the achievements of writers in the field of mystery at all.""]Mayersberg's tale features layers of intricacies, secret deals, snitches, stories within stories, all presented to you by a narrator (Owen's Jack Manfred) who may or may not be leveling with you.  Like countless others, I scrambled online to see if the IMDB chatboards would lead to a bit of resolution.  The prevailing opinion there is that Mayersberg and Hodges have deliberately left some things subject to interpretation.  Apparently, this conclusion is reinforced by the Director's commentary.  One reviewer noted that re-watching Croupier with Hodges' commentary was ""like watching an entirely different film.""  Unfortunately, we had a DVD without that track.

It also stands up as one of his best yet.  Although somewhat obscure and fairly unknown, this is one movie that Owen fans should get ahold of an add to their collection!Clive Owen plays Jack Manfred, an aspiring writer who is hounded by his father to find a decent job.  With the writing gig not quite working out for him (writer's block surely doesn't help), he finally takes one of those leads and becomes a croupier (dealer) at a local casino.  What he uncovers and encounters fascinates him, though certainly it could have appalled anyone.  This might be the start of a new book, finally stimulating his creative talents once again, while at the same time earning a good reputation at the blackjack tables as one heck of a croupier.  Toss in a mysterious woman (Alex Kingston of ""ER"" fame [she played Dr. Corday]), and his concerned girlfriend, and you have a strange mix of intrigue and drama, with much depth and flavor.It does have an R-rating, mainly for language, nudity, drug use and violence.  There is nothing quite gory about the film, the language is not a constant string of 4-letter words, the nudity is brief and the drug use fairly minor.  Still, be wary if you are offended by any of these items or if you were debating showing the film to anyone impressionable.  Overall, though, this is a fantastic movie that delivers drama, some minor action, and a great deal of intrigue.  It isn't preachy enough to be over anyone's head and it never gets too side-tracked by trying to fit into any one genre.

670693,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005NYFS,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Owen Cline was the croupier in question. He was an aspiring writer, and he narrates this story. He is a man of few words, but I quess that is because he admires Hemmingway rather than Faulkner. It is an interesting story about casinos and the gaming industry. Jack is the protagonist, but as he writes a book, it is almost as if he is simultaneously a character; and the character is named Jake. Sometimes Jack will do things he wouldn't normally do, just to make things more interesting for Jake.One thing Jack won't do is gamble. Though he is surrounded by temptation, he refuses to gamble. He is like an alcoholic who refuses to drink, knowing that once he starts in again he won't be able to stop. But perhaps Jake could take a gamble, just for the sake of the story...There is a character, Matt, who looks like Davey Jones of The Monkees. I am wondering if this actor was the son of Davey Jones, he looks so much like him. He is a short little croupier who is somewhat of a nihilist. Napoleon Complex personified, taking revenge on a world of taller people by letting them lose their money by gambling. He's also running a little scam on the side. He pays a punter off in higher denomination chips than he was supposed to. Jack, the croupier, notices this. He makes a stink about it. The croupiers are all on camera, but they can still get away with things if done right.That was the deal, though. I couldn't always tell what was going on, as I hadn't been born in a casino, and wasn't familiar with the finer points of roulette or black jack. Still, it was very entertaining. Owen Cline's performance is top notch. Jack does take a gamble, for the sake of Jake, and the story. Jack does write his book, but there is a price to be paid. Jack feels like he had only one book in him, and now it is done.

670698,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00005NYFS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","I think Clive Owen is a fabulous actor. Even though I enjoy his films so much, this film is actually kind of a stinker. There's a couple of redeeming moments, none of which have to do with this being a good film.Story of a story. Jack, Clive Owen, is writing a novel. He's lost his job and needs work. His father sets him up to be a croupier (dealer in a casino) in a casino. We join Jack interviewing, getting the job, being a croupier, and then getting involved in a heist. Early in the film we don't hear voice over narration of the story he is writing. About 30 mintues in, we start to hear voice over narration, Chapter One, Jack does this or that...Chapter Two... After about 45 minutes of this, it gets very annoying and in the way of the mystery.There's a backdrop of a relationship with his girl friend Marion, played by the stunning Gina McKee. And Jack has a bit of woman trouble with another dealer, Bella (played by made up to be mousy Kate Hardie); and a ""professional"" gambler Jani de Villiers (played by Alex Kingston).Here's the good parts. Clive Owen. He's handsome, he moves gracefully, he has a beautiful voice...what more could a person want? Well he does tend to feel like he's reading his lines, but that aside, early Clive Owen is good stuff. The other good part, Alex Kingston. She is one of the more sensual women I've seen on screen in a long time. No she is not drop dead fabulous incredible gorgeous woman in some superstar mold. She is ever so sensual. Her beauty is of the Reubens variety, a very curvey, well proportioned woman. There is a hugely surprising bedroom scene where she just very casually shows up complete full front naked. It's shocking and exciting.What's wrong with this film. Just about everything else. There is no way to figure out anything that is happening in this film. In a mystery, there must be clues that the viewer in hind sight will say, ah I could have figured that out; or ah that makes sense; or ah I got it before the director told me. No the mystery is totally 100% complete and totally random. There's no way you could figure it out. So in the end, it's no mystery, it's just annoying. At 1 and a half hours, its still 20 minutes too long. They could have dropped the whole voice over narration nonsense.Oh the technology is funny. Released in 1998, probably filmed much earlier. Jack types on a Video writer. This was a funny little moment between typewriters and computers. It was essentially a typewriter with a 4-6 line gray LCD screen, memory, and the ability to edit your words after the fact. It was incredibly complex to fix mistakes, but it was better than correction fluid. The weird part about this movie (and a goof on the director's part), once you typed something into a Video writer, it was done. The final scene of Jack printing out his novel is from a computer to a laser printer; and that is simply not possible with the Video writer. Ah geekdom, its a horrible cross to bear.The movie is not rated, but would definately be R rated. There are two scenes with very naked women. Oddly, they both casually take off their clothes, and just sort of end up naked without any attention or fanfare. As I seem to recall, there is no sex scene as a result of this nakedness (there's racier scenes in most PG-13 films). There's a good amount of strong language (definately more than 2 f bombs). Not much violence, a fight scene, but most television fights are more graphic than this one. So, an R rating. Not for younger viewers.Unless you are a huge Clive Owen fanboy, avoid this movie. Alex is pretty, but not worth slogging through an hour and a half of lines being read. The whole casino talk never really connected with anything in the plot anyway. And the mystery is a total mess. Really didn't care for this one at all.",2,Great if you are trying to complete your Clive Owen collection,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,3799,"['think', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'Even', 'enjoy', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'actually', 'kind', 'stinker', 'couple', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'none', 'have', 'do', 'being', 'good', 'film.Story', 'story', 'Jack', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'writing', 'novel', 'lost', 'job', 'needs', 'work', 'father', 'up', 'be', 'croupier', 'dealer', 'casino', 'casino', 'join', 'Jack', 'interviewing', 'getting', 'job', 'being', 'croupier', 'then', 'getting', 'involved', 'heist', 'Early', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'voice', 'narration', 'story', 'writing', '30', 'mintues', 'start', 'hear', 'voice', 'narration', 'Chapter', 'One', 'Jack', 'Chapter', 'Two', '45', 'minutes', 'very', 'annoying', 'way', 'mystery.There', 'backdrop', 'relationship', 'girl', 'friend', 'Marion', 'played', 'stunning', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'Jack', 'bit', 'woman', 'trouble', 'dealer', 'Bella', 'played', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'mousy', 'Kate', 'Hardie', 'professional', 'gambler', 'Jani', 'Villiers', 'played', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'good', 'parts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'handsome', 'gracefully', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'person', 'want', 'Well', 'tend', 'feel', 'reading', 'lines', 'aside', 'early', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'good', 'stuff', 'other', 'good', 'part', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'one', 'more', 'sensual', 'women', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'drop', 'dead', 'fabulous', 'incredible', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'superstar', 'mold', 'ever', 'so', 'sensual', 'beauty', 'Reubens', 'variety', 'very', 'curvey', 'well', 'proportioned', 'woman', 'hugely', 'surprising', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'where', 'just', 'very', 'casually', 'up', 'complete', 'full', 'front', 'naked', 'shocking', 'wrong', 'film', 'Just', 'everything', 'else', 'way', 'figure', 'out', 'anything', 'happening', 'film', 'mystery', 'must', 'be', 'clues', 'viewer', 'hind', 'sight', 'will', 'say', 'ah', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'ah', 'sense', 'ah', 'got', 'director', 'told', 'mystery', 'totally', '100', '%', 'complete', 'totally', 'random', 'way', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'So', 'end', 'mystery', 'just', 'annoying', '1', 'half', 'hours', 'still', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'dropped', 'whole', 'voice', 'narration', 'technology', 'funny', 'Released', '1998', 'probably', 'filmed', 'much', 'earlier', 'Jack', 'Video', 'writer', 'was', 'funny', 'little', 'moment', 'typewriters', 'computers', 'was', 'essentially', 'typewriter', '4-6', 'line', 'gray', 'LCD', 'screen', 'memory', 'ability', 'edit', 'words', 'fact', 'was', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'fix', 'mistakes', 'was', 'better', 'correction', 'fluid', 'weird', 'part', 'movie', 'goof', 'director', 'part', 'once', 'typed', 'something', 'Video', 'writer', 'was', 'done', 'final', 'scene', 'Jack', 'printing', 'out', 'novel', 'computer', 'laser', 'printer', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', 'Video', 'writer', 'Ah', 'geekdom', 'horrible', 'cross', 'bear.The', 'movie', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'definately', 'be', 'R', 'rated', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'very', 'naked', 'women', 'Oddly', 'casually', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'just', 'sort', 'end', 'up', 'naked', 'attention', 'fanfare', 'seem', 'recall', 'sex', 'scene', 'result', 'nakedness', 'racier', 'scenes', 'most', 'PG-13', 'films', 'good', 'amount', 'strong', 'language', 'definately', 'more', '2', 'f', 'bombs', 'Not', 'much', 'violence', 'fight', 'scene', 'most', 'television', 'fights', 'are', 'more', 'graphic', 'one', 'So', 'R', 'rating', 'Not', 'younger', 'viewers.Unless', 'are', 'huge', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fanboy', 'avoid', 'movie', 'Alex', 'pretty', 'not', 'worth', 'slogging', 'hour', 'half', 'lines', 'being', 'read', 'whole', 'casino', 'talk', 'never', 'really', 'connected', 'anything', 'plot', 'anyway', 'mystery', 'total', 'mess', 'Really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'one']",N/A

In the same way, Croupier goes beyond the relatively simple story by having Manfred always narrating the events as he sees them in his own worldview. It provodes a lot more depth in his character and the movie in general.Manfred is not a cruel character, but his love of croupier work, and how it intimately relates to his own life, gives him a detached quality.

670705,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005NYFS,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","Jack Manfred is a writer seeking to find the elusive inspiration required to pen his first novel. He hasn't always been a writer, however. Before sitting down in front of a word processor he experienced first hand the lure of the casino; his father traipsed around the world gambling away everything he had and often alienated his young son in the process. Now Manfred has settled down with his store detective girlfriend Marion and his Duran Duran hat and spends his time trying to put it all down on paper. The casino has different ideas for Jack, calling him back when his father pulls some strings and gets his son a job as a croupier in a London gaming house. Much like the alcoholic who continually hears the siren sound of the liquor bottle and the neighborhood bar, Manfred initially fights the impulse to return to dens of iniquity full of roulette wheels, chips, and lost souls looking to buck the odds. As much as Jack hates to admit it, he does have a mathematician's mind for gambling. During the interview for the job, he pulls chips off the felt and stacks them with the precision of a surgeon. Manfred can keep track of multiple bets with cool ease; can analyze the motives and psychologies of the gamblers sitting down at the table, all while keeping his mask of exterior detachment firmly in place. Obviously, and agonizingly, he gets the job.It quickly becomes apparent to Jack that returning to the &quot;house of addiction&quot; poses numerous difficulties. Marion, at first enthused about her boyfriend's new job and big paycheck, begins to notice subtle changes in Jack after he begins work. Other employees at the casino exert their own nefarious influences on our hero, with one of the female croupiers luring Jack in with her wiles while a male croupier tempts Jack in a different way. One immutable rule of the house applying to all employees concerns gambling: don't do it. Obviously, the owners of the gaming house don't want chronic gamblers as employees because debts accrued at the tables will ultimately lead to stealing or cheating. Another rule concerns fraternization with customers and employees outside of the casino: again, don't do it. Knotty relationships with fellow workers can cause one to lose concentration or lead to nasty emotional blowups. Mixing things up with the punters can lead to scams and cheating.Manfred, essentially an honest guy, manages to break nearly everyone of these rules in record time, although he does keep himself out of serious trouble until he meets a beautiful gambler by the name of Jani de Villiers. This woman attempts to lure Jack into a situation that could, and does, have serious and lingering problems of a decidedly life threatening nature. Through it all--the eventual blowup with Marion, the increasing problems with fellow employees, and the lure of Jani--Jack Manfred finally writes. He writes about his job as a croupier, about the lost souls swirling about the gaming tables, and he does it so well his book must surely lead to success and fame. Maybe.&quot;Croupier&quot; is a wonderful effort from director Mike Hodges, the same bloke who did &quot;Get Carter&quot; way back in the day. The movie boasts Clive Owen as Jack Manfred, the stunningly gorgeous Alex Kingston in the role of punter supreme Jani de Villiers, and Gina McKee as Jack's straight arrow girlfriend Marion. Owen steals the show, as he should, in his role as the cynical, icy Jack Manfred. Our hero has a lot of personal problems--from his childhood difficulties dealing with a father addicted to gambling to attempting to change course and earn a living as a writer--and Owen believably pulls it all off. I read somewhere this actor is on the shortlist to fill the role of James Bond when Pierce Brosnan steps down, and I couldn't agree more with the choice. In fact, I noticed a striking resemblance between Owen and Sean Connery while watching &quot;Croupier.&quot; Maybe it was some of this guy's mannerisms or his subtle charm, but whatever it was the comparison is a valid one. Heck, some of the interior shots of the casino where Jack works reminded me of an early James Bond film, with the snappy dialogue and expressive eye contact. I don't want to overemphasize Clive Owen, though. Alex Kingston does a bang up job as de Villiers, a woman so beautiful you can barely look at her without sunglasses. Even better, we get to see A LOT of Kingston in this role.Performances are key to this film because the plot tends to confuse at points. After awhile, I quit trying to piece it all together and just sat back to enjoy Owen as he navigated through a host of personal problems. I wouldn't want to call &quot;Croupier&quot; a &quot;slice of life&quot; film, although it certainly fits that bill nicely. The movie isn't primarily about casinos either even though it does give the viewer great insight into the sordid world of gaming houses. &quot;Croupier&quot; is a film about Jack Manfred's personal pain and how he attempts to deal with it as an adult. He's an arrogant guy who thinks he can remove himself from the real world and its attendant problems--his voice-overs and mannerisms hint at his personal belief that HE is above petty problems faced by the mere mortals staring back at him over stacks of chips--but ends up enmeshed in numerous difficulties nonetheless because while he won't gamble at the tables, he does gamble in his personal life. Watch the movie to find out how Jack's risks lead to a major plot twist at the end of the film, and figure out for yourself whether he wins or loses.",5,Clive Owen steals the show,1073088000,"01 3,

Our leading man thinks he's a writer, but with his dismal success at the career, he turns back to the skill he knows best from his past life--dealing cards.  His former-police-officer live-in girlfriend is dismayed at the change in her man, from a homebody to a hard-living man who is out late nights at the casino.  The croupier, however, is very clearly NOT a gambler.  He's defined himself as the man who deals the cards, not the one who loses to the house odds (he did come from a failure of a gambler of a father in South Africa, that is).Well, the dealings of the casino aren't as upright as our croupier is himself, and he is faced with temptation after double-cross after inside plea after perfect score, again and again.  The fascinating movie gets to what the true fabric of a man is, especially in light of his father's behavior.  Our croupier faces a number of women of different walks of life--his upstanding fianc&eacute;e, a fellow croupier and druggie, and a wealthy gambler who gets herself in her own pickle of debt.Watching the croupier find his true self and his lot in life (Is he a writer?  Just a card dealer?  A cheater on the girlfriend who loved him?  A man willing to sacrifice his morals for a score?  How much of his old man is in him?  What constitutes gambling?) makes for fascinating cinema, and this movie delivers a gut-punching twist at the end.

670713,A2VG8F8TL6AYDR,B00005NYFS,"""lexo-2""","[7, 31]","Mike Hodges and Paul Mayersberg's &quot;Croupier&quot; was released in Britain as a low-budget sleeper and went on to do some serious business in the USA, based on some very high-powered reviews and, presumably, audience loyalty.Yes, Mike Hodges directed that camp classic, Flash Gordon.  He also directed one of the finest British gangster movies, Get Carter, with Michael Caine, many years ago.  Paul Mayersberg's script for Croupier must have tempted him somehow or other, but frankly, it's hard for this viewer to see how.It's not that Clive Owen doesn't bear up manfully as the eponymous novelist/casino dealer of the title.  It's not that Gina McKee isn't good as his long-suffering girlfriend, or that Alex Kingston isn't luscious as a mysterious South African woman, or that Kate Hardie doesn't bring her own brand of weird hoydenish charm to her role as a fellow croupier (croupiette?) with a &quot;troubled&quot; past.  It's that this film sucks.  And the fault can be slapped in the face of the writer.The plot, insofar as there is one, is pretty risible - Owen plays a novelist, Jack Manfred, who has worked as a croupier in his homeland of South Africa.  Down on his luck, he takes a job in a London casino.  Here he meets a Ruthless Casino Owner, a Breezily Amoral Fellow Croupier who takes him to a Decadent Nightspot, and after a while he gets involved with a Luscious Femme Fatale (Kingston) who has a bizarre nude scene - she walks into a room without a stitch on and proceeds to put on a nightgown before going to sleep with Jack, who is in the room already, and I mean Sleep.  Why did this happen?  Did we just totally have to see a naked woman at some point in this film?  Not that Alex Kingston isn't exceptionally easy on the eye, cause she is - but the scene makes no sense, as we are led to assume that the two characters don't ever actually have sex.Meanwhile, Jack tries to write his novel about an Amoral Croupier, but his Life Is Becoming Like His Book.  Whatever chance this film had of being interestingly nuanced and ambiguous is steamrollered by a galumphing voice-over of stunning literal-mindedness.  Just when we can see Owen thinking &quot;What an interesting woman&quot;, the voice-over says &quot;Jack thought, what an interesting woman&quot;, and so on.Most of the time frame of the film is compressed into the last ten minutes.  The voiceover is so boringly obvious, the dialogue so cheesy, that you wonder why this wasn't a novel, just as you wonder why Owen's character wasn't a screenwriter.  I'm prepared to believe that Mayersberg knows a lot about the business of casinos, but it doesn't make him a writer.The original audience for this movie knew what they were doing when they let it die.  What Americans have since seen in it frankly escapes me.  Croupier is a bunch of fine actors and a good director struggling to polish a lump of tacky, third-rate coal.  It was never going to be a diamond.  Let it go.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[5, 5]","Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a writer in search of inspiration who needs a ""real"" job to make ends meet at least until he manages to finish and sell his first book. Taking advantage of his previous experience as a croupier, Jack somehow ends up in a casino, where he will find not only a way to earn the money he needs, but also the inspiration he was seeking so desperately. Jack decides that ""he would write about the world he knew, from the inside"".As a consequence, he starts to write a book based on his experiences in the casino, and at the same time shares with us the world of numbers, and odds. For some spectators, watching this film will be similar to visiting a new world that they weren't aware of before...The director (Mike Hodges) mixed the events with Jack's detached reflections on them, and the result is quite good. I found some of Jack's insights particularly interesting, for example those about people who are addicted to gambling, and their behaviour.In general, this is a great movie, somewhat acid but very good all the same.

Yes, the man who gave us Flash Gordon is back. Not that he went anywhere; Hodges disappeared from Hollywood after Flash Gordon, but has kept playing around the edges, directing episodes of HBO's excellent anthology series The Hitchhiker, a few other made-for-TV flicks, and the odd big-screen indie offering (Black Rainbow, A Prayer for the Dying, et al). Hard to tell whether Croupier was meant as his way back into Hollywood or just another Black Rainbow. It ended up being neither, somehow, despite reams of praise from just about every major-league critic in the book.The story centers around Jack (Clive Owen, the driver in those BMW short films directed by big names), a writer struggling with his book and rapidly spending his advance. His father, a well-known gambler pulls a few strings and gets Jack a job as a croupier in a local casino. The job breaks Jack's writers' block, and he writes about (of course) his job and the odd characters he meets there, on both sides of the table. There's a bit more to the story than that, but given the film's pace and development, it's hard to say what without spoilers other than to say there's a thriller-type element to the film.I spent much of my time watching it wondering what about it, exactly, caused Roger Ebert to call it a godsend. Make no mistake, it's a quite good little film, does what it sets out to do with very little fuss, and gives American viewers ample opportunity to see more of Alex Kingston (Dr. Corday on ""ER"") and Kate Hardie (Safe, The Krays), both of whom are so easy on the eyes it's almost criminal. Owen gives a smashing performance given that his role throughout most of the film is simply to react to what goes on around him; he never makes it boring, though, as a lesser actor might well have done. But it really is a minor film, one which in a year where more releases drew as much attention as the year's finest (Before Night Falls, Requiem for a Dream, et al.) would probably have been written off as an easy way to kill ninety minutes. And that's pretty much it; you can spend ninety minutes in many worse ways (e.g., Planet of the Apes, Scary Movie 2, Dude Where's My Car?...), but ultimately there's nothing here to have drawn the rain of praise this film received with its American release. ***",3,"Minor, but good.",1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,2542,"['[', 'Please', 'note', 'actually', 'review', 'VHS', 'version', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'amazon', 'yet', ']', '*', '*', '*Croupier', 'Mike', 'Hodges', '1998', 'hard', 'watch', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'film', 'not', 'expect', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'pop', 'up', 'somewhere', 'snarl', 'lying', 'BITCH', 'Yes', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'back', 'Not', 'went', 'anywhere', 'Hodges', 'disappeared', 'Hollywood', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'kept', 'playing', 'edges', 'directing', 'episodes', 'HBO', 'excellent', 'anthology', 'series', 'Hitchhiker', 'few', 'other', 'made-for-TV', 'flicks', 'odd', 'big-screen', 'indie', 'offering', 'Black', 'Rainbow', 'A', 'Prayer', 'Dying', 'et', 'al', 'Hard', 'tell', 'Croupier', 'was', 'meant', 'way', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'Black', 'Rainbow', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'somehow', 'reams', 'praise', 'just', 'major-league', 'critic', 'book.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Jack', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'driver', 'BMW', 'short', 'films', 'directed', 'big', 'names', 'writer', 'struggling', 'book', 'rapidly', 'spending', 'advance', 'father', 'well-known', 'gambler', 'few', 'strings', 'Jack', 'job', 'croupier', 'local', 'casino', 'job', 'Jack', 'writers', 'block', 'course', 'job', 'odd', 'characters', 'there', 'sides', 'table', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'given', 'film', 'pace', 'development', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'spoilers', 'other', 'say', 'thriller-type', 'element', 'film.I', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'caused', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'call', 'godsend', 'Make', 'mistake', 'quite', 'good', 'little', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'fuss', 'American', 'viewers', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'see', 'more', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'Dr.', 'Corday', 'ER', 'Kate', 'Hardie', 'Safe', 'Krays', 'whom', 'are', 'so', 'easy', 'eyes', 'almost', 'criminal', 'Owen', 'smashing', 'performance', 'given', 'role', 'most', 'film', 'simply', 'react', 'what', 'never', 'boring', 'though', 'lesser', 'actor', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'done', 'really', 'minor', 'film', 'one', 'year', 'where', 'more', 'releases', 'drew', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'year', 'finest', 'Night', 'Falls', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'et', 'al', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'easy', 'way', 'kill', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'can', 'spend', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'many', 'worse', 'ways', 'e.g.', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', 'drawn', 'rain', 'praise', 'film', 'received', 'American', 'release', '***']",N/A
670723,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005NYFS,Robert Moore,"[8, 8]","This is basically a decent movie held together by an absolutely stunning lead performance.  In fact, Clive Owen is so spectacular as Jack Manfred, a writer who once again takes a job as a croupier in an English casino, a job he has despised in the past, that he actually makes what would otherwise be a decent film a semi-great one.  The film in the end fails to achieve true greatness, primarily because of narrative difficulties and a gimmicky plot twist near the end that leaves an unpleasant taste in one's mouth with its triviality.  But that is the director and writer's fault, and not Owen's.  His character, gradually getting sucked into the world he abandoned, suffers a spiritual crisis as he becomes increasingly detached and evolves into a dispassionate and detached observer.  There is a plot, but to be honest the story completely failed to hold my attention and I'm not sure it deserved my time.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, is a different matter altogether.Although this is one of the most riveting performances by an actor in recent years, Owen was sadly not eligible for an Academy Award nomination because the film was shown on Dutch TV before nominations were made.  Because it was a relatively low budget film that received scant notice in the United States, showing almost exclusively in art houses, it is entirely possible that Owen might not have been acknowledged with a nomination even if he had been eligible, but it would have been interesting to find out.  What is marvelous about his performance is the way he manages to appear completely dispassionate while at the same time containing powerful emotional reserves.  He seems an intensely passionate individual who has completely internalized his passions.  Incredibly, Owen's best moments are when he is working at a croupier, speaking only as the demands of his trade require, while we listen to his narrating what he is observing, apparently a narration that forms the text of the book he is writing.  I heard Owen interviewed on NPR and there he stated that he insisted on doing the narration first, and then they would shoot the scenes with the narration playing, allowing him to express facially what the words articulate.  Owen has great eyes, and he recalls the old expression that the eyes are the windows of the soul.If anyone other than Clive Owen had the lead in this film, it would almost certainly have been, at best, average.  As it is, his performance drives the entire film to something very nearly great.  One of the problems that I have always had with auteur theory is that in many films it will lead one to privilege the director as the creative force, while in many cases the director clearly plays a subservient role.  Sometimes that crucial figure is the producer, sometimes the writer.  In at least one case, THE LIMEY (and without meaning to take anything away from director Stephen Soderbergh), editor Sarah Flack has as much claim as anyone to claim the title ""auteur.""  In this film, that distinction belongs to Owen.For some reason of which I am unaware, this film was long unavailable in the United States in any form.  I missed it when it first hit the theaters in 1999, so I was delighted when I discovered that it was finally available in DVD.  That lack of availability has led, I believe, to Clive Owen being less well known than he deserves.  He did go on to make a celebrated series of BMW commercials directed by major film directors such as Ang Lee, John Frankenheimer, Tony Scott, John Woo, and several cutting edge action directors, and memorably appeared in Robert Altman's GOSFORD PARK and another Mike Hodges film BETTER OFF DEAD.  This summer saw him in the unfortunate KING ARTHUR in the title role.  The next year or so will feature Owen in a variety of releases, which will hopefully bring him more of the notice he deserves.",4,Stunning lead performance in otherwise average film,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,3857,"['basically', 'decent', 'movie', 'held', 'together', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'lead', 'performance', 'fact', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'so', 'spectacular', 'Jack', 'Manfred', 'writer', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'job', 'croupier', 'English', 'casino', 'job', 'despised', 'past', 'actually', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'decent', 'film', 'semi-great', 'one', 'film', 'end', 'achieve', 'true', 'greatness', 'primarily', 'narrative', 'difficulties', 'gimmicky', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'unpleasant', 'taste', 'one', 'mouth', 'triviality', 'director', 'writer', 'fault', 'not', 'Owen', 'character', 'gradually', 'getting', 'sucked', 'world', 'abandoned', 'spiritual', 'crisis', 'increasingly', 'detached', 'dispassionate', 'detached', 'observer', 'plot', 'be', 'story', 'completely', 'failed', 'hold', 'attention', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'deserved', 'time', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'other', 'hand', 'different', 'matter', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'performances', 'actor', 'recent', 'years', 'Owen', 'was', 'sadly', 'not', 'eligible', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'Dutch', 'TV', 'nominations', 'were', 'made', 'was', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'received', 'scant', 'notice', 'United', 'States', 'showing', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'art', 'houses', 'entirely', 'possible', 'Owen', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'acknowledged', 'nomination', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'eligible', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'What', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'way', 'appear', 'completely', 'dispassionate', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'containing', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'reserves', 'intensely', 'passionate', 'individual', 'who', 'completely', 'internalized', 'passions', 'Incredibly', 'Owen', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'working', 'croupier', 'speaking', 'only', 'demands', 'trade', 'require', 'listen', 'narrating', 'what', 'observing', 'apparently', 'narration', 'text', 'book', 'writing', 'heard', 'Owen', 'interviewed', 'NPR', 'there', 'stated', 'insisted', 'doing', 'narration', 'first', 'then', 'would', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'narration', 'playing', 'allowing', 'express', 'facially', 'what', 'words', 'articulate', 'Owen', 'great', 'eyes', 'old', 'expression', 'eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'soul.If', 'anyone', 'other', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'had', 'lead', 'film', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'average', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'something', 'very', 'nearly', 'great', 'One', 'problems', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'auteur', 'theory', 'many', 'films', 'will', 'lead', 'one', 'privilege', 'director', 'creative', 'force', 'many', 'cases', 'director', 'clearly', 'subservient', 'role', 'crucial', 'figure', 'producer', 'sometimes', 'writer', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'THE', 'LIMEY', 'meaning', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Soderbergh', 'editor', 'Sarah', 'Flack', 'as', 'much', 'claim', 'anyone', 'claim', 'title', 'auteur', 'film', 'distinction', 'Owen.For', 'reason', 'am', 'unaware', 'film', 'was', 'long', 'unavailable', 'United', 'States', 'form', 'missed', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', '1999', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'discovered', 'was', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'lack', 'availability', 'led', 'believe', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'being', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'did', 'go', 'make', 'celebrated', 'series', 'BMW', 'commercials', 'directed', 'major', 'film', 'directors', 'such', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'John', 'Woo', 'several', 'cutting', 'edge', 'action', 'directors', 'memorably', 'appeared', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'film', 'BETTER', 'OFF', 'DEAD', 'summer', 'saw', 'unfortunate', 'KING', 'ARTHUR', 'title', 'role', 'next', 'year', 'so', 'will', 'feature', 'Owen', 'variety', 'releases', 'will', 'hopefully', 'bring', 'more', 'notice']",N/A

Mostly people who work in the casino business.""""And the girls?""""They're just girls.""""Croupier"" is the kind of movie that instinctively understands that kind of dialogue, and, more importantly, what kind of story ought to surround it. It's British film noir, a slick, coolly haunting portrait of the gambling London underground. But the movie has a decidedly international feel - good film noir is good, national origin regardless.But ""Croupier"" is better than that - an idealized version of the genre that seduces while it shocks. It plays itself as an easy mark, much like its protagonist, casino dealer Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) sees his clients as their grubby fingers plop chips onto the table.But as the tense closing sequences, which play like the last blackjack game before bankruptcy, unfold, the mark becomes pretty clear. It's pleasurable to find disjointed fragments come together, but there's a deeper, more rattling effect at work from director Mike Hodges, who set the standard for British gangster flicks with ""Get Carter"" in 1971.It opens with Jack, played by Owen with detached charm, struggling to make the right ends meet as a writer. A publisher wants a soccer novel, complete with blood, sex and drugs. Jack obliges but supplements his starving artist lifestyle as a croupier - that's dealer in American lingo -  at the London-based Golden Lion casino.Having excelled at it in South Africa, Jack knows this game. When he returns to the mirror-filled basement of the casino, his narration welcomes him back to ""house of addiction."" We come to learn what he's talking about. He's the son of a gambler, who seemingly hasn't made the right ends meet once in life. Jack won't gamble, can't gamble - it's against the croupier rules. There's other rules to which Jack commits himself. And then, one by one, he breaks them.Screenwriter Paul Mayersburg populates the scene with the typical noirish fare - a faithful girlfriend (Gina McKee), a troublemaker (Kate Hardie), a mystery woman (Alex Kingston). Jack begins to write a casino novel and croupier named Jake; the two personas begin to blur.""Croupier"" makes much of the two ends of gambling addiction - indeed, in Jake's mind, the only two personalities in life - that of the gambler and the croupier. Gamblers have hope. Croupiers have odds. Gamblers have superstitions. Croupiers have rules. Gamblers lie. And under most circumstances, croupiers, good ones anyway, certainly do not. Just how that figures into the central sequence of the film, how morality can honestly fit into a immoral situation, is best discovered on your own. But the repercussions of that scene are stark. And then a final twist, a big javelin right into the heart of the plot, puts the pieces in place. Better yet, it reveals all the pieces that didn't seem to exist.My favorite movies are these - the kind that wants it both ways and gets what it wants. Owen gives a fine performance - some have hailed him as a good candidate for James Bond movies - but his best work is to stay solid and move within the plot, rather than overshadow it. McKee is appropriately put-upon as the girlfriend, while Hardie, who plays a dealer named Bella, gamely plays the fringe character who ""used to be in the game.""The real difference maker is Hodges, who understands noir is best filmed without snappy editing tactics and inhabiting a world where nearly everyone smokes their own brand of cigarette. His camera plays fine tricks with the casino mirrors and drab, dead-looking flats.It's that little film of sleaze that hangs over every scene that completes the portrait. Characters speak lines like they've spoken them before, playing the same game with new faces that turn out to be old faces.

I was first exposed to Owen in Bourne Identity. Although limited to only a few scenes and even fewer lines, his performance was impressive.  Unfamiliar with his work, I sought to find other films in which he had appeared. I was disappointed by ""The Rich Man's Wife"" and ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,"" to name a few, before then I finally stumbled onto ""Croupier.""Owen plays a writer (Jack) struggling to find the right plot and setting for his first novel. His only support, both emotional and financial, is from his live-in lover who nonetheless is also quick to cruelly judge both his writing and his character.  Down to his last pennies, after a phone-call tip and recommendation from his father, he reluctantly takes a job as a card dealer (a croupier), a craft he already knows all too well. Jack detests the work and the gambling environment, but he hopes his tenure in the occupation will only be temporary until he can find direction for his writing. Ironically, it is this repugnant experience  and the events that confront him in the casino which actually provide the inspiration he has been seeking.Owen is brilliant in his understated, but very believable performance. He ably portrays an enigmatic figure, holding his emotions in check until the right moments, not trying to overcompensate for the measured pace of the film. To his credit, Director Mike Hodges does not overburden us with too much action. He also chose to have Owen's character narrate, a device which not only helps to explain some of the technical aspects of card playing, but, more important, provides a writer's sensibility to the story. At times, Jack's lines literally become part of the texture of a few of the scenes. Hodges is not so good in his overall approach, however, typically excluding some important details  (is it his editing?), presumably to allow the viewer to draw his own conclusions. Yet, what omissions or flaws there are do not markedly detract from the mystery or suspense, including  what occurs in the surprise ending.  Wonderful supporting performances by McKee and others also complement what we get from Owen, making this, in total, a very good film to see. I caution you, though: listen carefully to what Jake has to say.",4,This is a keeper,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2433,"['somewhat', 'amazing', 'see', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'suddenly', 'cast', 'major', 'character', 'big', 'studio', 'productions', 'especially', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'least', 'here', 'States', 'was', 'first', 'exposed', 'Owen', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'limited', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'even', 'fewer', 'lines', 'performance', 'was', 'impressive', 'Unfamiliar', 'work', 'sought', 'find', 'other', 'films', 'had', 'appeared', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Wife', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'name', 'few', 'then', 'finally', 'stumbled', 'Croupier', 'Owen', 'writer', 'Jack', 'struggling', 'find', 'right', 'plot', 'setting', 'first', 'novel', 'only', 'support', 'emotional', 'financial', 'live-in', 'lover', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'also', 'quick', 'cruelly', 'judge', 'writing', 'character', 'last', 'pennies', 'phone-call', 'tip', 'recommendation', 'father', 'reluctantly', 'job', 'card', 'dealer', 'croupier', 'craft', 'already', 'too', 'well', 'Jack', 'work', 'gambling', 'environment', 'tenure', 'occupation', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'temporary', 'can', 'find', 'direction', 'writing', 'Ironically', 'repugnant', 'experience', 'events', 'confront', 'casino', 'actually', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'been', 'seeking.Owen', 'brilliant', 'understated', 'very', 'believable', 'performance', 'ably', 'enigmatic', 'figure', 'holding', 'emotions', 'check', 'right', 'moments', 'not', 'trying', 'overcompensate', 'measured', 'pace', 'film', 'credit', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'not', 'overburden', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'also', 'chose', 'have', 'Owen', 'character', 'narrate', 'device', 'not', 'only', 'explain', 'technical', 'aspects', 'card', 'playing', 'more', 'important', 'writer', 'sensibility', 'story', 'times', 'Jack', 'lines', 'literally', 'become', 'part', 'texture', 'few', 'scenes', 'Hodges', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'overall', 'approach', 'however', 'typically', 'excluding', 'important', 'details', 'editing', 'presumably', 'allow', 'viewer', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'what', 'flaws', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'markedly', 'detract', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'including', 'what', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Wonderful', 'supporting', 'performances', 'McKee', 'others', 'also', 'complement', 'what', 'get', 'Owen', 'making', 'total', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'see', 'caution', 'listen', 'carefully', 'what', 'Jake', 'say']",N/A

The first half of the film, which deals with the world of casino gambling from the point-of-view of a croupier, is constantly fascinating.  I was absorbed by the inner workings of the casino, the different types of gamblers who frequent them, the nocturnal lives of croupiers, and their attitudes towards gamblers.  I also found Jack (Clive Owen) to be eminently interesting.  I liked the way the screenplay gradually peels away the layers of Jack's character to reveal his core of contradictions (although he strictly refrains from gambling on games of chance, he becomes more and more willing to gamble on much riskier ventures, subsequently anteing up his girlfriend, his security, his life).  I should note that although I enjoyed watching Jack, I did not enjoy listening to his narrated thoughts.  I realize that the voiceover narration is necessary to convey the intricacies of casino gambling, but I felt it was excessive to the point of distraction.  The display of some emotion could have eliminated large chunks of unimportant voiceover exposition.  Okay, so Jack is detached, but I don't think he had to be that detached.  But this becomes a minor quibble when compared to the bigger distractions that effectively bring about the film's collapse during the second half, which deals with the heist.  I just don't get it.  How can a screenwriter so perceptive about the psyches of gamblers and croupiers be so dense as to not see all the holes in the plotted heist?  How can a director so attentive to the details of casino gambling be so sloppy when handling a casino heist?  I have a strong urge to type out all the frustrating shortcomings in the plot and I would do it right now if it wouldn't take me forever.  And what's up with that ending?  Either I am too stupid to understand all the intricate complexities of the plot or it's a big cheat.

Having now seen ""Croupier,"" I understand a bit more why he was considered, as it's fairly clear that the 007 from the opening casino scenes in ""Dr. No"" was a model for Owen's look and performance here, right down to the way he dangles his cigarette.  Still, he lacks that final ingredient of panache, looking a bit more like a slightly less dopey but more hairy Nicholas Cage than a young Connery.  His sociopathic performance here, too, lacks significant depth, though it is appropriate for the muted goings on that is ""Croupier's"" plot.  As a frustrated writer searching for his muse, Owen's Jack is pulled into myriad scenes depicting the sad state of the controlled and controlling that comprises the gambling world, itself a thinly veiled metaphor for society in general.  The first half of the film may remind viewers of ""Fight Club"" in both tone and execution; by the time the story takes some twists -- at least one unexpected -- it seems a different animal.  The performances here are good, especially from Alex Kingston, whose South African accent and desire to get naked are both plusses.  But by the middle of the film, it's not clear whether what we are seeing is real or some fantasy conjured up by ""Jake,"" Jack's steely alter ego.  In the end, it doesn't seem to matter, as ""Croupier"" reaches for and basically attains the sort of muddled climax that intellectuals find thought provoking.

But Jack does have a talent: he's a gifted Croupier (a dealer - an attendent who collects and places bets). When his gambler/con-artist father arranges an interview with the head of a Casino, Jack reluctantly agrees only because he needs the money. But once behind the gaming tables, Jack is in his element and reigns supreme. Here every gambler loses because the odds are always stacked against them, and Jack ""never gambles."" The rush Jack gets from his job energizes everything else in his life and becomes the inspiration for the Novel he always wanted to write, but soon Jack will experience what he's always known: ""hold on tightly, let go lightly"" - everything has a consequence. Since he is no longer dependent on his girlfriend Marion, she feels threatened. His success has also made him a target of temptation, and the man who ""never gambles"" may become the biggest gambler of them all. The acting by Gina McKee as Marion is outstanding, and Clive Owen, who also narrates this film in the third person, was perfectly cast as Jack, the Croupier. He plays the role with a detached, cool and calculated sense of irony that makes the character facinating to watch.

Being a 007 fan, I decided to watch some movies featuring the top contender: Clive Owen.  The first film I watched was ""Croupier"".""Croupier"" stars Clive Owen as an aspiring writer with big dreams and little chance of success.  His father (Nicholas Ball) snags him a job as a croupier at a local casino.  When he begins working there, Owen realizes that his life as a croupier would make a great novel.  Owen begins writing the novel, all the while being drawn deeper into a web of deceit and dangerous gambles.The cast - which includes Nick Reding, Alexander Morton, Gina McKee, Paul Reynolds, Kate Hardie, and Alex Kingston - is very good.  Clive Owen is spectacular.  He was a perfect choice for the role.  He makes it very clear how detached his character feels from the rest of society, and he also shows us how amused and disgusted he is with the gamblers he sees every day.  As a 007 fan, I thought it was interesting to see him in the casino scenes, because he had the sort of casual cool that Sean Connery did in the Bond films.Mike Hodges' directing is superb.  He captures Owen's feeling of detachment and creates a dark, smoky atmosphere for the film.  Paul Mayersberg's script is well-written and absorbing.Simon Fisher-Turner's music is great, particularly the theme song.  It also adds to the mood of the film.I loved ""Croupier"" when I first watched it, and I still do.
