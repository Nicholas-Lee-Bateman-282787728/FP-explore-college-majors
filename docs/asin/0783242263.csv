I love Beethoven 1 & 2 but this sequal was boring and ridiculous. The original cast are gone and the new characters are just boring. The villians in this movie are really stupid. The only interesting thing about this movie was looking at Beethoven. This movie really wasted my time and I suggest saving your time and money. Not funny or interesting at all!!! Anyway I can't wait to see the fourth one though!!!,1,This 3rd sequal is not worth it!,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,513,"['watched', 'third', 'sequal', 'right', 'seeing', 'two', 'original', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'love', 'Beethoven', '1', '2', 'sequal', 'was', 'boring', 'ridiculous', 'original', 'cast', 'are', 'gone', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'boring', 'villians', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'stupid', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'looking', 'Beethoven', 'movie', 'really', 'wasted', 'time', 'suggest', 'saving', 'time', 'money', 'Not', 'funny', 'interesting', 'Anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'fourth', 'one', 'though']",N/A

71343,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,0783242263,Brett Johnson,"[3, 4]","I put off seeing the original &quot;Beethoven&quot; for a long time due to the fear that it wouldn't be suitable for anyone over the age of 6.  Instead, it turned out to be a funny, cute and fairly smart family movie.  It was a nice surprise.That brings us to &quot;Beethoven's 3rd&quot;.  The actors from the first two films in the series are gone.  They are actually replaced by another group of talented and enjoyable actors (Judge Reinhold, Julia Sweeney, Joe Pichler &amp; Michaela Gallo).  Sadly, that's pretty much where the compliments end.The screenplay treats the viewer as if they have been in a state of arrested development since they were a toddler.  You get the usual &quot;hit in the crotch&quot; and &quot;sprayed with poop&quot; scenes that these lowbrow movies love so dearly.  I am also floored by how many times an action scene is either played in slow motion or fast motion.  Over and over and over again.  Perhaps it's meant to distract us from the fact that this movie sorely lacks a decent plot or any worthwhile humor.  It doesn't work.I truly recommend seeing the charming original &quot;Beethoven&quot; but stay far, far away from this poor sequel.",1,Another insulting piece of junk.,1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,1176,"['put', 'off', 'seeing', 'original', 'quot', 'Beethoven', 'quot', 'long', 'time', 'due', 'fear', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'suitable', 'anyone', 'age', '6', 'Instead', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'funny', 'cute', 'fairly', 'smart', 'family', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'quot', 'Beethoven', '3rd', 'quot', 'actors', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'are', 'gone', 'are', 'actually', 'replaced', 'group', 'talented', 'enjoyable', 'actors', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Julia', 'Sweeney', 'Joe', 'Pichler', 'amp', 'Michaela', 'Gallo', 'Sadly', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'compliments', 'end.The', 'screenplay', 'viewer', 'have', 'been', 'state', 'arrested', 'development', 'were', 'toddler', 'get', 'usual', 'quot', 'hit', 'crotch', 'quot', 'quot', 'sprayed', 'poop', 'quot', 'scenes', 'lowbrow', 'movies', 'love', 'so', 'dearly', 'am', 'also', 'floored', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'action', 'scene', 'played', 'slow', 'motion', 'fast', 'motion', 'over', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'meant', 'distract', 'fact', 'movie', 'sorely', 'decent', 'plot', 'worthwhile', 'humor', ""n't"", 'work.I', 'truly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'charming', 'original', 'quot', 'Beethoven', 'quot', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'poor', 'sequel']",N/A

Wondering why the original cast are missing?  Simple- the new family are their relatives and have been so kind as to take care of Beethoven.The only recognisable actor in the film is Judge Reinhold who plays the father in the family.  Beethoven's 3rd is basically a film which trys to act as an improvement and replacement on the original Beethoven movie.  In the end though, it just proves to be completely unnecessary and ridiculous.",1,Roll over Beethoven,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,534,"['Straight', 'video', 'nonsense', 'Beethoven', 'returning', 'once', 'again', 'new', 'batch', 'cutesy', 'puppies', 'Wondering', 'why', 'original', 'cast', 'are', 'missing', 'Simple-', 'new', 'family', 'are', 'relatives', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'kind', 'take', 'care', 'Beethoven.The', 'only', 'recognisable', 'actor', 'film', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'who', 'father', 'family', 'Beethoven', '3rd', 'basically', 'film', 'act', 'improvement', 'replacement', 'original', 'Beethoven', 'movie', 'end', 'just', 'be', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'ridiculous']",N/A

OK, maybe it's because I'm a grown-up.  Kids did like it.  But I found the acting amusingly terrible, esp. the phony performance put up by the wife.  The kids are not even likable.  The Penny girl is kinda pretty but not particularly convincing.  The two villains are the bright spots besides the dog (or the three dogs that play Beethoven), but after about 60 minutes, nothing in this movie has any redeeming value left.
