686422,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00005UW9Z,bookloversfriend,"[15, 16]","It is amusing that the one reviewer was turned off by the fact that this movie, The Fairy Princess, should have fairies in it.  The movie is in fact fast-paced with the plot taking a new direction every few minutes.  If you're bored by this, you should be playing video games.  It's not at all predictable.  I thought of several possible endings (and could give you one that would be better than the one they used).Small children as well as grownups should delight in this film.  It has a pleasant story.  The casting, for a change, is good.  The child is appealing.  The father is okay.  The fairy is quite appealing.  In fact, the movie avoided all of the mistakes usually found in family fare.The only reasons I withhold the highest rating are the scene at the school play where the midgets dance.  It wasn't amusing and went on too long.  And the rock music during the birthday party.  It was inappropriate for this kind of film.  Also, rock music at the end while the credits are passing, but you can stop the DVD at that point.  Too bad, though, because good music at the end can be a nice cap for a pleasant experience.Bottom line: don't miss adding this one to your collection.  Even at regular price, it would be worth it.  At this price, it's a steal.",4,a pleasant surprise,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,1261,"['amusing', 'one', 'reviewer', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'fact', 'movie', 'Fairy', 'Princess', 'should', 'have', 'fairies', 'movie', 'fact', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'taking', 'new', 'direction', 'few', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'bored', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'not', 'predictable', 'thought', 'several', 'possible', 'endings', 'could', 'give', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'used', '.Small', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'grownups', 'should', 'delight', 'film', 'pleasant', 'story', 'casting', 'change', 'good', 'child', 'appealing', 'father', 'okay', 'fairy', 'quite', 'appealing', 'fact', 'movie', 'avoided', 'mistakes', 'usually', 'found', 'family', 'fare.The', 'only', 'reasons', 'withhold', 'highest', 'rating', 'are', 'scene', 'school', 'play', 'where', 'midgets', 'dance', 'was', ""n't"", 'amusing', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'rock', 'music', 'birthday', 'party', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'kind', 'film', 'Also', 'rock', 'music', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'passing', 'can', 'stop', 'DVD', 'point', 'Too', 'bad', 'though', 'good', 'music', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'nice', 'cap', 'pleasant', 'experience.Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'adding', 'one', 'collection', 'Even', 'regular', 'price', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'steal']",Dazzle

And she only has six days!With only the help of two clumsy midget detectives, Oddkin and Bodkin, can Tom find the spell that will save Crystal?'Dazzle' is an enchanting film, suitable for all the family, but especially for children. It is a tale of courage and love, spiced with a sprinkling of humour and a dash of madness.

686428,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00005UW9Z,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[4, 6]","Synopsis:Dazzle is the story of Tom Nightengail (Maxwell Caulfield), a well known chidren's author, and writer of books about fairies.  Recently widowed and now the single parent of a daughter, he has lost all joy in his life and all that he his left is in his daughter Melissa.Every night he reads to her, and unbeknownst to them both, a real life fairy named Crystal (Chantell Stander) listens in as well by the window.  Yet on one particular night, the little fairy suffers an accident that transforms her into a human being, complete with amnesia.From there she enters the Nightengails' lives and turns them upside down... in a mostly good way.  But not all is well, because others are searching for her, others whose plans are not kind.The question is, can the Nightengails keep her safe and will Tom learn to love again?About the Movie:Dazzle stars Maxwell Caulfield, Chantell Standler, Mia Sara and Jeff Fahey among others.Overall, this is standard direct to DVD fare. Made in England with mostly English actors, its production values are higher than many more adult oriented films, but the script and storyline are purely kid focused, including slapstick elements that make it somewhat cheesy. It's a pure fantasy film, involving fairies and gnomes and an evil wizard who collects fairies for sport.  Most adults and older children wouldn't have the patience to sit through it, but many younger kids would probably enjoy it.There really isn't any objectionable content in this film, except perhaps, the fact that when the Nightengails meet the fairy, she's naked.  Of course, nothing explicit is shown and it's all implied.  It also deals quite a bit with magic, though not of the incantation sort.Overall, this is not that great a movie.  Most adults would become bored of it quickly. It drags rather badly at points. But kids would enjoy it and though the film appears to be unrated, it's certainly safe for them to watch.About the DVD:The Dazzle DVD comes in a hard case in full screen format in Dolby Digital Stereo.  It has no subtitles and is in English only.  Total running time is 85 minutes.  Both sound and picture in this DVD release are decent.The bonus features are a pair of filmographies of Maxwell Caufield and Jeff Fahey respectively.Bottom line: 2 stars",2,"A movie for kids, that's a bit of a yawner",1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,2279,"['Synopsis', 'Dazzle', 'story', 'Tom', 'Nightengail', 'Maxwell', 'Caulfield', 'well', 'known', 'chidren', 'author', 'writer', 'books', 'fairies', 'Recently', 'widowed', 'now', 'single', 'parent', 'daughter', 'lost', 'joy', 'life', 'left', 'daughter', 'Melissa.Every', 'night', 'unbeknownst', 'real', 'life', 'fairy', 'named', 'Crystal', 'Chantell', 'Stander', 'as', 'well', 'window', 'one', 'particular', 'night', 'little', 'fairy', 'suffers', 'accident', 'human', 'being', 'complete', 'amnesia.From', 'Nightengails', 'lives', 'upside', 'down', 'mostly', 'good', 'way', 'not', 'well', 'others', 'are', 'searching', 'others', 'plans', 'are', 'not', 'kind.The', 'question', 'can', 'Nightengails', 'keep', 'safe', 'will', 'Tom', 'learn', 'love', 'again', 'Movie', 'Dazzle', 'stars', 'Maxwell', 'Caulfield', 'Chantell', 'Standler', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'others.Overall', 'standard', 'direct', 'DVD', 'fare', 'Made', 'England', 'mostly', 'English', 'actors', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'higher', 'many', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'films', 'script', 'storyline', 'are', 'purely', 'kid', 'focused', 'including', 'slapstick', 'elements', 'make', 'somewhat', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'film', 'involving', 'fairies', 'gnomes', 'evil', 'wizard', 'who', 'fairies', 'sport', 'Most', 'adults', 'older', 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'many', 'younger', 'kids', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'it.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'objectionable', 'content', 'film', 'perhaps', 'fact', 'when', 'Nightengails', 'meet', 'fairy', 'naked', 'course', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'shown', 'implied', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'magic', 'not', 'incantation', 'sort.Overall', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Most', 'adults', 'would', 'become', 'bored', 'quickly', 'rather', 'badly', 'points', 'kids', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'be', 'unrated', 'certainly', 'safe', 'watch.About', 'DVD', 'Dazzle', 'DVD', 'hard', 'case', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'subtitles', 'English', 'only', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '85', 'minutes', 'sound', 'picture', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'decent.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pair', 'filmographies', 'Maxwell', 'Caufield', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'respectively.Bottom', 'line', '2', 'stars']",Dazzle
