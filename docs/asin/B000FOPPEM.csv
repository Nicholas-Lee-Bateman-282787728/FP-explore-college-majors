The book was a bit better in detail, but books usually are.  This book was translated to video format keeping true to the theme of the story.  It seems like the ending could have been closer to the ending of the book, but I'm sure they had their reasons.  Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman made a great team in Sphere.
