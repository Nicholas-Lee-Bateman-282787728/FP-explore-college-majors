However, sometimes the execution got on my nerves.  I liked the young man more than the young woman.  I hate it when movies have characters in them that do not respond when someone asks them a question or makes a statement.  The person just looks off into space or walks off.  Normal people don't do that and the young woman did it in this movie way too much for me.  I don't mind slow paced character study movies.  However, when the movie gets to its main point, I want the point to be made loud and clear.  I'm not a fan of ambiguous endings that are left to viewer interpretation.  I had to suspend belief about the ending.  When there is a realization like the one at the end, I would enthusiastically tell everyone in creation, I'm just sayin'. Having said all that, I did enjoy the movie.  I just got the feeling that it was trying to be deeper than it came across.P.S.  I was recently told that in Korean culture, no response to a question could mean the person did not want to say anything hurtful or may not have known what to say.  So now I understand why the woman acted as she did.  So for that reason I'm going from a three star to a four star.",4,Yes and No,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1280,"['liked', 'cinematography', 'story', 'director', 'writer', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'sometimes', 'execution', 'got', 'nerves', 'liked', 'young', 'man', 'more', 'young', 'woman', 'hate', 'when', 'movies', 'have', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'respond', 'when', 'someone', 'question', 'statement', 'person', 'just', 'off', 'space', 'walks', 'off', 'Normal', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'young', 'woman', 'did', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'paced', 'character', 'study', 'movies', 'However', 'when', 'movie', 'main', 'point', 'want', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'loud', 'clear', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'are', 'left', 'viewer', 'interpretation', 'had', 'suspend', 'belief', 'ending', 'When', 'realization', 'one', 'end', 'would', 'enthusiastically', 'tell', 'everyone', 'creation', ""'m"", 'just', 'sayin', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'deeper', 'came', 'across.P.S', 'was', 'recently', 'told', 'Korean', 'culture', 'response', 'question', 'could', 'mean', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'say', 'anything', 'hurtful', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'say', 'So', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'woman', 'acted', 'did', 'So', 'reason', ""'m"", 'going', 'three', 'star', 'four', 'star']",Maybe

It's quiet and thoughtful, but it's worth it to get to the end to find out what happens. I liked it - it's sweet. If you feel like watching something that doesn't hit you over the head with violence or heart-pounding action, then you might like this. Take a chance on it and enjoy.",5,Sweet story,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,321,"['rather', 'slow', 'develop', 'story', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'worth', 'get', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'liked', 'sweet', 'feel', 'watching', 'something', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'violence', 'heart-pounding', 'action', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'Take', 'chance', 'enjoy']",Maybe

1606177,A33G4HF1D4LN0U,B00A7059LI,Moanakai,"[0, 0]","Love the lead male, have seen in other Korean films and his acting is superb. However, you need to be very patient with this movie which even for me was difficult, to get to the last approximately 20 minutes when it is all pulled together in a way that you can't see coming. The very end could have been a little stronger. So considering the majority of the movie where the director seemed to jump from one scene to another without filling in the details, and the plodding movement of the film (2 stars), to the 4 star pulling together of the film, I rate it 3 stars overall. The greatest point of the film is that nothing happens by coincidence and we tend to meet those people we're supposed to meet, for whatever reasons.",3,Mixed reviews for this one,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,724,"['Love', 'lead', 'male', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Korean', 'films', 'acting', 'superb', 'However', 'need', 'be', 'very', 'patient', 'movie', 'even', 'was', 'difficult', 'get', 'last', 'approximately', '20', 'minutes', 'when', 'pulled', 'together', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'very', 'end', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'stronger', 'So', 'considering', 'majority', 'movie', 'where', 'director', 'seemed', 'jump', 'one', 'scene', 'filling', 'details', 'plodding', 'movement', 'film', '2', 'stars', '4', 'star', 'pulling', 'together', 'film', 'rate', '3', 'stars', 'overall', 'greatest', 'point', 'film', 'nothing', 'happens', 'coincidence', 'tend', 'meet', 'people', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'meet', 'reasons']",Maybe
