The story is fascinating--an actress supposedly being hired by a movie company to play a role, but in reality she really has been hired to be murdered by someone who needs to kill her. The plot is sometimes difficult to follow. And the screenplay has many plot holes which make the story hardly believable. Because of the excellent direction and acting, the plot holes becomes noticable mainly after the movie ends. You then realize how illogically the characters have been acting and how preposterous this contrived story is. Still, it has its fun moments.",4,"Intriguing, but...",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,677,"['found', 'acting', 'directing', 'atmosphere', 'writing', 'excellent', 'loaded', 'suspense', 'surprises', 'story', 'fascinating', 'actress', 'supposedly', 'being', 'hired', 'movie', 'company', 'play', 'role', 'reality', 'really', 'been', 'hired', 'be', 'murdered', 'someone', 'who', 'kill', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'screenplay', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'make', 'story', 'hardly', 'believable', 'excellent', 'direction', 'acting', 'plot', 'noticable', 'mainly', 'movie', 'then', 'realize', 'how', 'illogically', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'acting', 'how', 'preposterous', 'contrived', 'story', 'Still', 'fun', 'moments']",N/A

137318,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,0792836642,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","Arthur Penn is one of those directors who had a checkered career. Coming out of live TV, he came into his own in the 1960s with the movies MICKEY ONE, THE CHASE, and especially BONNIE & CLYDE. LITTLE BIG MAN (1970) was his last major success and NIGHT MOVES (1975) was his last critical one. By the time DEAD OF WINTER was made (1987), his career had been in decline for over a decade and he no longer was a force to be reckoned with. He was actually the third and final director on this film. It has Penn's edgy camerawork, maximum impact editing and bursts of cringe inducing violence. It also features the typical strong performances from its principal actors. There's Mary Steenburgen (in 3 roles), Roddy McDowall, and Canadian opera singer turned actor Jan Rubes  (remember the man in the original THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY?). There are a number of Hitchcock like elements to DEAD OF WINTER although it's a reworking of a celebrated B movie, Joseph H. Lewis' MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (1945). Jan Rubes character is even named Joseph Lewis.Down-on-her-luck actress Katie McGovern (Steenburgen), who lives with her injured husband and brother, auditions for a part in an unfinished movie and to her astonishment, is hired on the spot. She is whisked away for a screen test to a house in Upstate New York by the man conducting the audition (McDowall) to meet the producer, a crippled psychiatrist (Rubes). On the way there, a fierce winter snowstorm begins and before long Katie realizes that there is more going on than meets the eye. After her arrival, she learns that she is expected to play the part of a sibling to a psychotic sister (also Steenburgen) and then after that...she'll no longer be needed. A few twists and turns later, Katie tries to turn the tables on her kidnappers. What she does and what happens to them makes for a most a harrowing ending. Penn delivers a good, old fashioned thriller in the classic tradition with tense situations and colorful performances that suit the material. It's not a great movie but it is a well crafted one. McDowall is great and Steenburgen really shines.",4,Arthur Penn Meets Alfred Hitchcock.,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2103,"['Arthur', 'Penn', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'had', 'checkered', 'career', 'Coming', 'live', 'TV', 'came', 'own', '1960s', 'movies', 'MICKEY', 'ONE', 'THE', 'CHASE', 'especially', 'BONNIE', 'CLYDE', 'LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', '1970', 'was', 'last', 'major', 'success', 'NIGHT', 'MOVES', '1975', 'was', 'last', 'critical', 'one', 'time', 'DEAD', 'OF', 'WINTER', 'was', 'made', '1987', 'career', 'had', 'been', 'decline', 'decade', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'was', 'actually', 'third', 'final', 'director', 'film', 'Penn', 'edgy', 'camerawork', 'maximum', 'impact', 'editing', 'bursts', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'violence', 'also', 'typical', 'strong', 'performances', 'principal', 'actors', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', '3', 'roles', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Canadian', 'opera', 'singer', 'turned', 'actor', 'Jan', 'Rubes', 'remember', 'man', 'original', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'JOURNEY', 'are', 'number', 'Hitchcock', 'elements', 'DEAD', 'OF', 'WINTER', 'reworking', 'celebrated', 'B', 'movie', 'Joseph', 'H.', 'Lewis', 'MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'JULIA', 'ROSS', '1945', 'Jan', 'Rubes', 'character', 'even', 'named', 'Joseph', 'Lewis.Down-on-her-luck', 'actress', 'Katie', 'McGovern', 'Steenburgen', 'who', 'injured', 'husband', 'brother', 'auditions', 'part', 'unfinished', 'movie', 'astonishment', 'hired', 'spot', 'whisked', 'away', 'screen', 'test', 'house', 'Upstate', 'New', 'York', 'man', 'conducting', 'audition', 'McDowall', 'meet', 'producer', 'crippled', 'psychiatrist', 'Rubes', 'way', 'there', 'fierce', 'winter', 'snowstorm', 'long', 'Katie', 'more', 'going', 'meets', 'eye', 'arrival', 'expected', 'play', 'part', 'sibling', 'psychotic', 'sister', 'also', 'Steenburgen', 'then', ""'ll"", 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'needed', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'later', 'Katie', 'turn', 'tables', 'kidnappers', 'What', 'what', 'most', 'harrowing', 'ending', 'Penn', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'thriller', 'classic', 'tradition', 'tense', 'situations', 'colorful', 'performances', 'suit', 'material', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'crafted', 'one', 'McDowall', 'great', 'Steenburgen', 'really']",N/A

She's an aspiring actress who answers an audition call held by Mr. Murray (Roddy McDowell). She passes and agrees to journey to upstate New York where she'll prepare herself for the part and make an audition tape. She and Mr. Murray head north in a bad snow storm. After a long drive, they reach their destination, an old, isolated mansion where their host is an elderly, wheel-chair bound psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Lewis (Jan Rubes). Over the next few days, Katie will master her part for the video recording which will be sent, she's told, to a film director. She learns the speech patterns and vocal mannerisms of a woman who looks like her. She's told this woman was the star of the film but had a break down and will have to be replaced. She makes the tape to the great satisfaction of Dr. Lewis and Mr. Murray. So far, so good. Then Katie discovers some photographs of the actress, very dead. The car, the only way back to civilization, won't start. The phone lines are out. She appears to be drugged part of the time. She tries to escape through the snow but is tracked down and forcibly returned by Mr. Murray, still the soul of politeness as he forces her back. She makes her way to the attic, a gloomy place stuffed with boxes and chests. She nearly steps in a huge bear trap. And in a chest she finds the body of the person she was trained to imitate. One morning she awakens from a drugged sleep and sees fresh blood stains on her pillow and the sheet...and sees a bandage on her hand where one of her fingers has been cut off. Then she learns the dead woman has a wealthy sister who also looks like her...and who is walking into the mansion for a meeting with Dr. Lewis. Katie McGovern is going to have to be ruthless and smart if she's going to survive the day.The story is a nice, complicated tale of murder, blackmail, and things that go bump in the night, especially in the attic. Steenburgen is an actress who is so open and natural that she has a high likeability factor. Even though you know much of the time what to expect, Steenburgen makes getting there nerve-wracking. Roddy McDowell as the obsequious, excitable and murderous manservant to Jan Rubes does a very nice job. Rubes turns in a solid performance as a ruthless murderer who can lie to your face and make you believe it.The movie has some holes in the story, but it's such a well-handled genre piece -- the spooky, isolated mansion, the heroine in distress, the things that jump out -- that, in my opinion, it's a lot of fun. Arthur Penn has done some first-rate films (Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man). He knows how to keep a story moving and how to build atmosphere. One of his best films, Night Moves, is going to be released on DVD soon.

On the surface it's a very well written, tightly paced and moody story.

137326,A106016KSI0YQ,0792836642,Jay Dickson,"[2, 3]","Arthur Penn's 1987 DEAD OF WINTER has much going for it: two absolutely terrific performers in Mary Steenburgen (in three roles) and Roddy McDowall; fine cinematography; and fantastic use of its setting, a mansion in upstate New York filled with secret panels and mysterious attics. Unfortunately, its screenplay is so silly that the film doesn't quite live up to its cult reputation. In the largest of her three roles, Steenburgen plays an out-of-work actress summoned upstate from Manhattan to film what she is told will be an audition video for a major motion picture by a sinister wheelchair-bound producer (the uncharismatic Jan Rubes) and his twitchy assistant (McDowall); before long, she realizes the producer is not what he seems and neither is the audition video.Although the screenplay is pretty ingenious and showing us how Steenburgen is stymied by her many attempts to escape the mansion (although it steals much from the classic 1940s B-movie MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS, which the movie acknowledges by naming one of Steenburgen's minor roles here ""Julie Rose""), it never succeeds in making the central blackmail plot make very much sense. (Too much depends upon Rubes and McDowall having miraculously found an exact duplicate for the Julie Rose character in Steenburgen's actress character Katherine.) And though casting Steenburgen in a third role as the nasty Evelyn at least allows her the chance to show some of her range, the whole thing becomes completely absurd when Evelyn attempts to murder Katherine with a knife: the whole thing seems too reminiscent of the famous campy still from DEAD RINGERS showing one of the Bette Davis twins with a gun to the other's head, and the complete unreality is heightened by dolling Evelyn up in an absolutely absurd floor-length dark mink coat with matching floppy hat (so as to better disguise the stunt double work during the knife fight).

But, however many faults the movie has, it still grips me, and evokes the fear and suspense necessary for it to qualify as a taut thriller. You have a claustrophobic setting, disturbing older men, a woman in distress, and murder. These ingredients come together to make for a very interesting hour and a half. At the very least, I found myself entertained.The film starts out with the murder of a woman in an abandoned parking lot on a snowy winter's night. Next we are in New York City, where we are exposed to the struggling actor's life of Katie McGovern (Mary Steenburgen). She is just looking for that one good role (with good pay, of course). After she does well at an audition, the man hosting it, Mr. Murray (Roddy McDowall), invites her upstate to an isolated country house, in order to do some test screening. Katie agrees. She tells her boyfriend she will call him once there, and is off. Once Katie arrives at the house, she is introduced to the man in charge, Dr. Joseph Lewis (sinisterly portrayed by Jan Rubes). Uneasy things begin to occur (the phones lines go dead, and the car won't start), and soon Katie's world turns upside down as the two older men begin to unveil their frightening plan upon the unsuspecting actress.There are things to knock about ""Dead of Winter"". Many of them involve aspects of what film critic Roger Ebert has termed ""The Idiot Plot"". This is where characters are in certain situations that go on for far too long because, instead of doing the sensible thing, they act with fairly bad judgement, thus enabling the movie to exist and continue on. A few examples: Why go hours upstate to an isolated house for a screen test? Why believe that an old *doctor* is in charge of casting a movie? Why, when you see that the two men whose house you are in have thrown your driver's license in the fireplace, do you act casually, as though nothing is wrong? I won't go on, as I don't want to give away too much of the film. Suffice it to say, you will need to suspend some disbelief, and just go with the flow.There are many good elements about ""Dead of Winter"". The direction by Arthur Penn is steady, and moves along at a good pace. The casting is great. Mary Steenburgen, Roddy McDowall, and Jan Rubes are all perfect in their roles. The setting is superb - an old, wood interior, victorian style house in the middle of the countryside. A fierce blizzard snowing-in the hapless actress. All of the elements come together very well.Some night, when the wind is howling outside, the snow drifts are accumulating around your house, and you're feeling just a wee bit isolated, decide on a good night of suspense, and watch this movie.

The actress is resourceful as she plots her revenge on her hosts in a harrowing and exciting finale.",4,"Creepy, claustrophobic and entertaining thriller",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,793,"['screen', 'test', 'unemployed', 'actress', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'chilly', 'frosty', 'tale', 'deceit', 'murder', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'dual', 'identity', 'plot', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'heavy-handed', 'Steenburgen', 'chores', 'here', 'expertly', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Jan', 'Rubes', 'are', 'two', 'elderly', 'men', 'who', 'lure', 'desperate', 'actress', 'isolated', 'mansion', 'there', 'begin', 'enact', 'deadly', 'scheme', 'cash', 'bundle', 'money', 'film', ""n't"", 'explore', 'angle', 'McDowall', 'accommodating', 'devious', 'extreme', 'Steenburgen', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Steenburgen', 'move', 'figure', 'way', 'dire', 'situation', 'actress', 'resourceful', 'revenge', 'hosts', 'harrowing', 'exciting', 'finale']",N/A

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[17, 25]","It's a cold, snowy, blustery Saturday evening here in Wisconsin, and I thought this would be the best movie to put on as I settled in for a cozy nite. I've had the film for a while; the MGM/UA dvd has a dual-disc, with full-screen on one side and widescreen on the other. The Widescreen side doesn't seem to play. Still, it's fun to watch Mary Steenburgen chew up the scenery, in multiple roles. ""Dead of Winter"" isn't a great film on the levels that film purists demand, but it was well thought out by director Arthur Penn. I won't blab away the plot, but things are pretty creepy throughout, and Mary is a fine heroine. I've always been a huge fan of the late, great Roddy MacDowell. I was always hoping he would get an Oscar nomination before he left us. He was a little over the edge here, but I thought he was great in ""Fright Night"". There's no doubt he would've won the Supporting Oscar for ""Cleopatra"" (1963), but Fox submitted his name to the Academy as Best Actor instead, and he got ripped off. Jan Rubes is especially convincing as the old man with alterior motives. William Russ was a handsome romantic interest, though his involvement was minimal, and I don't think his career went anywhere after this. Too bad. This film takes on its own character, and runs with it. Creepy, scary and loads of fun, especially on a blustery winter nite.

Back ""Video Voyeur""","[0, 0]","I first saw part of ""Dead of Winter"" on a cable channel with commercials while channel surfing and became intrigued with it enough to purchase a used copy.  I am happy I did.  This is a damsel in distress movie starring Mary Steenburgin as a young struggling actress who is offered a tryout as a replacement for a different actress who unfortunately died during filming.  She is selected for the role in order to fill in the few remaining scenes in order for the Director to be able to finish the movie due to her uncanny resemblance to the dead actress.  This is what she is told but isn't the real reason for her hiring as we find as the movie progresses!  The filming is being done in an isolated cabin in the snowed in woods of upstate New York.  Slowly but surely our heroine becomes wary of the cameraman and his assistent when the phone becomes inoperable, the car won't start and she sees all of her identity papers burning in the fireplace.  All of the loose ends get tied up in the thriller of an ending, including the loss of her finger which was surgically severed by the assistant.  Jan Rubes plays the cameraman who was at one time a practicing Psychologist and Roddy McDowell plays his assistant.
