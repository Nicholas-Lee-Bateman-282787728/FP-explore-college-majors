549773,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00004STGP,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Over the past several months I have, seemingly, grabbed every film documentary about the ""beat"" literary movement of the 1950s that I could get my hands on. This film, ""The Source"", continues that quest. And why am I interested in this movement, essentially a literary movement and not particularly, at least overtly, a consciously political movement that would not seem to fit in with other literary movements that I have given space to here? Well the short answer is that I just like the free verse spontaneous literary styles of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and company. More to the point I have been trying, as this documentary and others reviewed in this space have attempted as well, to link the liberating effects of that 1950s scene as forbears of my own generation, the Generation of '68, a much less literary-inclined generation.That idea sets one of the parameters of my interest. Another is the question of what of this collective wealth of archival footage, interviews and readings that virtually all the films reviewed have presented gives the best idea of what was going on then for those of us who were really too young (or were not born yet)to appreciate this breathe of fresh air. This effort is one the better ones for two reasons. First, the producers have established clearly who they believe are (as I do) the central players in this drama, the above-mentioned Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs. Of course, the ""beat' scene is not complete without recognizing the role that madman-for-all seasons Neal Cassady, Zen-master poet Gary Snyder, street poet Gregory Corso, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti (if for no other reason that the establishment of the City Lights Bookstore, a central hangout) , and host of other minor poets, hangers-on and crazies played. They are given space here, as well. But without the core literary/philosophical leadership of the three there make not have been such a phenomenon.Secondly, and more importantly, in recognition of that centrality the producers have given over a fair amount of time for a rather short documentary (about an hour and a half) to extensive readings of Kerouac's work (by Johnny Depp) , Allen Ginsberg's ground-breaking and defining ""Howl"", and Burroughs ""Naked Lunch"" (by Dennis Hopper, who else, right?). These readings are important. ""Beat"" was driven by the sounds of jazz and the blues, among other aural influences so the sounds (and nuances) of the works are more critical than more cerebral efforts. Although to our current ears much of this may sound self-indulgent this was the breakout sound of the ""beats"", and to paraphrase Kerouac's ending to ""On The Road"", the sound of the fathers, the fathers that we never knew, Kerouac/Ginsberg/Burroughs.",4,"The Beat ""Beat""",1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2760,"['past', 'several', 'months', 'have', 'seemingly', 'grabbed', 'film', 'documentary', 'beat', 'literary', 'movement', '1950s', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'film', 'Source', 'quest', 'why', 'am', 'interested', 'movement', 'essentially', 'literary', 'movement', 'not', 'particularly', 'least', 'overtly', 'consciously', 'political', 'movement', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'other', 'literary', 'movements', 'have', 'given', 'space', 'here', 'Well', 'short', 'answer', 'just', 'free', 'verse', 'spontaneous', 'literary', 'styles', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'William', 'S.', 'Burroughs', 'company', 'More', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'documentary', 'others', 'reviewed', 'space', 'have', 'attempted', 'as', 'well', 'link', 'liberating', 'effects', '1950s', 'scene', 'forbears', 'own', 'generation', 'Generation', ""'68"", 'much', 'less', 'literary-inclined', 'generation.That', 'idea', 'one', 'parameters', 'interest', 'question', 'what', 'collective', 'wealth', 'archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'readings', 'virtually', 'films', 'reviewed', 'have', 'presented', 'best', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'then', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'too', 'young', 'were', 'not', 'born', 'yet', 'appreciate', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'effort', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'producers', 'have', 'established', 'clearly', 'who', 'believe', 'are', 'do', 'central', 'players', 'drama', 'above-mentioned', 'Kerouac', 'Ginsberg', 'Burroughs', 'course', 'beat', 'scene', 'not', 'complete', 'recognizing', 'role', 'madman-for-all', 'seasons', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'Zen-master', 'poet', 'Gary', 'Snyder', 'street', 'poet', 'Gregory', 'Corso', 'Michael', 'McClure', 'Lawrence', 'Ferlinghetti', 'other', 'reason', 'establishment', 'City', 'Lights', 'Bookstore', 'central', 'hangout', 'host', 'other', 'minor', 'poets', 'hangers-on', 'crazies', 'played', 'are', 'given', 'space', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'core', 'literary/philosophical', 'leadership', 'three', 'make', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'phenomenon.Secondly', 'more', 'importantly', 'recognition', 'centrality', 'producers', 'have', 'given', 'over', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'rather', 'short', 'documentary', 'hour', 'half', 'extensive', 'readings', 'Kerouac', 'work', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'ground-breaking', 'defining', 'Howl', 'Burroughs', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'else', 'right', 'readings', 'are', 'important', 'Beat', 'was', 'driven', 'sounds', 'jazz', 'blues', 'other', 'aural', 'influences', 'so', 'sounds', 'nuances', 'works', 'are', 'more', 'critical', 'more', 'cerebral', 'efforts', 'current', 'ears', 'much', 'may', 'sound', 'self-indulgent', 'was', 'breakout', 'sound', 'beats', 'paraphrase', 'Kerouac', 'ending', 'Road', 'sound', 'fathers', 'fathers', 'never', 'knew', 'Kerouac/Ginsberg/Burroughs']",N/A

The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer.  The Source is glossy and gorgeous.  The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from ""Howl.""  Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film.  Their efforts are impressive.Just to let the skeptics out there know, there is no room for doubt in this documentary.  The beats are heroes and saviors--and not much else is considered.  That some of them were minor talents is brushed over.  Massive beat generation fans would give it five stars.  A totally sanitized version of William S. Burroughs is presented, and it is implied that Kerouac was only a heterosexual, which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious.  The film's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted.  One memorable quotation was, ""you can overdose on anything including sushi.""

I looked forward to seeing this video in anticipation of learning something. After all, these writers influenced the era in which I was growing up and opened unique and dramatic new ways of viewing the world. Tracing the early beginnings in the 1940s and bringing the movement right up to the present, it showed the changes in these young men (and they were ALL men) through the years.With the exception of Allen Ginsberg, they look like they all turned...out of touch with reality and locked into a way of thinking whose off-kilter attitude which was once hip, turned into an off-kilter attitude which never grew out of the fifties and seems &quot;mental&quot; today. Gregory Corso and Lawrence Ferlinghetti look like bad smelling derelicts. On a talk show in later years Kerouac, with slurred speech insists that the Vietnam war was a plot of the Vietnamese to get American jeeps and, in a later interview with William F. Buckley Jr., his eyes are red-rimmed and droopy and his words seem like babble as he is demolished by the precise cutting words of his host. The film moves fast and the clips come one after another. Often, the cast of characters are not identified and it was hard for me to follow just who was who. There's Ken Kesey. And Neal Cassady. And short film clips from 50s TV shows from Father Knows Best and Alfred Hitchcock poking fun at the Beatniks. It was hard to follow any individual story line and I found myself getting bored.Several well known actors were hired to read some of the writing itself. Johnny Depp did a good job of reading Kerouac and Dennis Hopper read from Burroughs. John Turturro, was emotional in his reading of insberg's &quot;Howl&quot; but he never rose above the material. I wish this film was better. I would really like to know more about the beats. For years I've carried around the idea that some day I'd pick up acopy of &quot;On the Road&quot; or &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in a secondhand book store and explore these writers for myself. But frankly, after hearing bits andpieces of them in this film, I've lost most of my interest. These ravings from angry young men intent on ripping preconceived culture apart certainly did influence our world. I say &quot;hooray&quot; for the effort. I'm personally glad that they opened the way to the future. But, after seeing this film, I'm not sure I want to enter their world through their words.",4,The reality of the beat generation brought up to date,1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,2659,"['Released', '1999', 'coincide', 'publication', 'quot', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'Book', 'Beats', 'quot', 'Chuck', 'Workman', 'documentary', 'kaleidoscope', 'film', 'clips', 'photos', 'interviews', 'particular', 'focus', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'video', 'anticipation', 'learning', 'something', 'writers', 'influenced', 'era', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'opened', 'unique', 'dramatic', 'new', 'ways', 'viewing', 'world', 'Tracing', 'early', 'beginnings', '1940s', 'bringing', 'movement', 'right', 'up', 'present', 'showed', 'changes', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'ALL', 'men', 'years.With', 'exception', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'look', 'turned', 'touch', 'reality', 'locked', 'way', 'thinking', 'off-kilter', 'attitude', 'was', 'once', 'hip', 'turned', 'off-kilter', 'attitude', 'never', 'grew', 'fifties', 'quot', 'mental', 'quot', 'today', 'Gregory', 'Corso', 'Lawrence', 'Ferlinghetti', 'look', 'bad', 'smelling', 'derelicts', 'talk', 'show', 'later', 'years', 'Kerouac', 'slurred', 'speech', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'was', 'plot', 'Vietnamese', 'get', 'American', 'jeeps', 'later', 'interview', 'William', 'F.', 'Buckley', 'Jr.', 'eyes', 'are', 'red-rimmed', 'droopy', 'words', 'seem', 'like', 'babble', 'demolished', 'precise', 'cutting', 'words', 'host', 'film', 'moves', 'fast', 'clips', 'come', 'one', 'Often', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'identified', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'just', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'short', 'film', 'clips', '50s', 'TV', 'shows', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'poking', 'fun', 'Beatniks', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'individual', 'story', 'line', 'found', 'getting', 'bored.Several', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'were', 'hired', 'read', 'writing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'reading', 'Kerouac', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'read', 'Burroughs', 'John', 'Turturro', 'was', 'emotional', 'reading', 'insberg', 'quot', 'Howl', 'quot', 'never', 'rose', 'material', 'wish', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'beats', 'years', ""'ve"", 'carried', 'idea', 'day', ""'d"", 'pick', 'up', 'acopy', 'quot', 'Road', 'quot', 'quot', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'quot', 'secondhand', 'book', 'store', 'explore', 'writers', 'frankly', 'hearing', 'bits', 'andpieces', 'film', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'most', 'interest', 'ravings', 'angry', 'young', 'men', 'intent', 'ripping', 'preconceived', 'culture', 'apart', 'certainly', 'did', 'influence', 'world', 'say', 'quot', 'hooray', 'quot', 'effort', ""'m"", 'personally', 'glad', 'opened', 'way', 'future', 'seeing', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'enter', 'world', 'words']",N/A
549779,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B00004STGP,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","This 90 minute documentary put together by Chuck Workman is one of the finest portrayls of literature from the so called ""Beat Generation"" and their misrepresentation upon entering mainstream pop culture. The film begins with some funny skits impersonating ""beatniks"", the most  memorable being Steve Martin's SNL bongo banging, beret wearing, goateed hack poet making declarations against Sputnik and going ""Zoom Zoom......(checking his notes, then) Zoom"" again. This brings the main issue and title of the film into question: getting on record what the movement was all about from the artists who produced their most notable literature, such as Kerouac and Ginsberg.  While many people snicker and deride them as loony lefties, much of this perception was derived from their market value upon getting published.Ginsberg really broke the real controversy with ""Howl"" in 1955, which was never a favortie of mine, but John Turturro's reading of the poem in this film really brought the intensity and feel of it to life. The only literature that I am really familiar with is that of Jack Kerouac (which was read by Johnny Depp), a native son of Lowell, which is just up the highway from my hometown of Winchester, Ma. I first picked up ""On The Road"" in high school, and loved it; only after that was I aware of the contraversy surrounding the whole beat movement and their influence on the counter culture of the 1960's. From Kerouac's book I got a real sense not only of the heartbreak of being down and out and getting ""beat"" by life (in the way his non literary aspirations and hopes never really came to fruition), but also of the post WWII era.  I think one of the most overlooked aspects of Kerouac's writing is the way his travels showed the opening up of the country through the interstate highway system, the end of the depression, the bebop jazz age, and the friendliness of people from all types of communities that Kerouac met for a brief but memorable moment.  People who are quick to disparage Kerouac (who for me really was the most prolific writer of the beats, producing 15 quality novels) often forget that he was quite the all american boy; he was the star running back for Lowell High in the late 30's and was recruited to play for Columbia, though his battles with coach Lou Little caused him vicious pain and disillusionment, when Jack had broken his leg and was told to ""suck it up"" and play through the pain.After this and his rejection from the Navy on psychological grounds, Jack really found solace in writing, but he still managed to join the Merchant Marine during the war and make the U Boat run to England in 1943, when the waters were far from being totatlly safe.  In fact, his ship  was later sunk by a torpedo with great loss of life after he had returned to New York. The sense that the beats were somehow disenfranchised, on the fringes of society gave their movement momentum, and considering the paranoia of McCarthyism of the early 50's, they had some valid points regarding freedom of speech and tolerance of ethnic and personal differences, ones that today are widely excepted. The Beats were almost like the forefathers of the underground artistic wing of the civil rights movement. Considering the heinous era of Kennedy's assasination, Vietnam and Nixon's paranoid goon squads, the beats are seen as the counterbalance. I think it is very possible that without the McCarthy's and Nixons of the world, the beats would have been far less controversial and their appeal to publishers would have dropped accordingly.  Their art shows a pendulum effect that took place in post war America, people were taking sides and party poltics of the early 20th century were put aside in favor of a rabid culture war that was more like the Civil War era, and the bickering of today's baby boomer politicians certainly carry that legacy.  When people go too far in one direction, the oppostion goes too far in the other, relagating the centrist to obscurity. That might be the lesson of the beats, that many of them were ""worked"" by both the media and in some cases the law, but they did give voice to a sizable minority that felt left out in the cold, and their art is now published the world round.",4,"Intelligent editing and the ""Beat Generation's"" standpoint in their own words",1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,4226,"['90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'put', 'together', 'Chuck', 'Workman', 'one', 'finest', 'portrayls', 'literature', 'so', 'called', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'misrepresentation', 'entering', 'mainstream', 'pop', 'culture', 'film', 'funny', 'skits', 'impersonating', 'beatniks', 'most', 'memorable', 'being', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'SNL', 'bongo', 'banging', 'beret', 'wearing', 'goateed', 'hack', 'poet', 'making', 'declarations', 'Sputnik', 'going', 'Zoom', 'Zoom', 'checking', 'notes', 'then', 'Zoom', 'again', 'main', 'issue', 'title', 'film', 'question', 'getting', 'record', 'what', 'movement', 'was', 'artists', 'who', 'produced', 'most', 'notable', 'literature', 'such', 'Kerouac', 'Ginsberg', 'many', 'people', 'snicker', 'deride', 'loony', 'lefties', 'much', 'perception', 'was', 'derived', 'market', 'value', 'getting', 'published.Ginsberg', 'really', 'broke', 'real', 'controversy', 'Howl', '1955', 'was', 'never', 'favortie', 'mine', 'John', 'Turturro', 'reading', 'poem', 'film', 'really', 'brought', 'intensity', 'feel', 'life', 'only', 'literature', 'am', 'really', 'familiar', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'was', 'read', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'native', 'son', 'Lowell', 'just', 'highway', 'hometown', 'Winchester', 'Ma', 'first', 'picked', 'up', 'Road', 'high', 'school', 'loved', 'only', 'was', 'aware', 'contraversy', 'surrounding', 'whole', 'beat', 'movement', 'influence', 'counter', 'culture', '1960', 'Kerouac', 'book', 'got', 'real', 'sense', 'not', 'only', 'heartbreak', 'being', 'down', 'getting', 'beat', 'life', 'way', 'non', 'literary', 'aspirations', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'fruition', 'also', 'post', 'WWII', 'era', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'aspects', 'Kerouac', 'writing', 'way', 'travels', 'showed', 'opening', 'country', 'interstate', 'highway', 'system', 'end', 'depression', 'bebop', 'jazz', 'age', 'friendliness', 'people', 'types', 'communities', 'Kerouac', 'met', 'brief', 'memorable', 'moment', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'quick', 'disparage', 'Kerouac', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'most', 'prolific', 'writer', 'beats', 'producing', '15', 'quality', 'novels', 'often', 'forget', 'was', 'quite', 'american', 'boy', 'was', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'Lowell', 'High', 'late', '30', 'was', 'recruited', 'play', 'Columbia', 'battles', 'coach', 'Lou', 'Little', 'caused', 'vicious', 'pain', 'disillusionment', 'when', 'Jack', 'had', 'broken', 'leg', 'was', 'told', 'suck', 'up', 'play', 'pain.After', 'rejection', 'Navy', 'psychological', 'grounds', 'Jack', 'really', 'found', 'solace', 'writing', 'still', 'managed', 'join', 'Merchant', 'Marine', 'war', 'make', 'U', 'Boat', 'run', 'England', '1943', 'when', 'waters', 'were', 'far', 'being', 'totatlly', 'safe', 'fact', 'ship', 'was', 'later', 'sunk', 'torpedo', 'great', 'loss', 'life', 'had', 'returned', 'New', 'York', 'sense', 'beats', 'were', 'somehow', 'disenfranchised', 'fringes', 'society', 'gave', 'movement', 'momentum', 'considering', 'paranoia', 'McCarthyism', 'early', '50', 'had', 'valid', 'points', 'regarding', 'freedom', 'speech', 'tolerance', 'ethnic', 'personal', 'differences', 'ones', 'today', 'are', 'widely', 'excepted', 'Beats', 'were', 'almost', 'forefathers', 'underground', 'artistic', 'wing', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'Considering', 'heinous', 'era', 'Kennedy', 'assasination', 'Vietnam', 'Nixon', 'paranoid', 'goon', 'squads', 'beats', 'are', 'seen', 'counterbalance', 'think', 'very', 'possible', 'McCarthy', 'Nixons', 'world', 'beats', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'less', 'controversial', 'appeal', 'publishers', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'accordingly', 'art', 'pendulum', 'effect', 'took', 'place', 'post', 'war', 'America', 'people', 'were', 'taking', 'sides', 'party', 'poltics', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'were', 'put', 'aside', 'favor', 'rabid', 'culture', 'war', 'was', 'more', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'bickering', 'today', 'baby', 'boomer', 'politicians', 'certainly', 'carry', 'legacy', 'When', 'people', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'direction', 'oppostion', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'relagating', 'centrist', 'obscurity', 'might', 'be', 'lesson', 'beats', 'many', 'were', 'worked', 'media', 'cases', 'law', 'did', 'give', 'voice', 'sizable', 'minority', 'felt', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'art', 'now', 'published', 'world', 'round']",N/A

549781,A257946FG7O1GR,B00004STGP,"Xam ""mixed media man""","[23, 23]","This is a serious documentary on the beat / hippie movement. It has tons of old footage and interviews with many of the most prominent beat figures like Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Corso, Ferlinghetti etc etc. It has historical footage of events like the Democratic National Convention in '68 and the be-in in San Francisco in '67. This is the perfect movie for someone who loves the beats or someone who has never heard of them. I didn't know much about them when i first watched this documentary on PBS, but after watching it i immediately became interested in their movement. I started reading a lot of the major works like On The Road, Naked Lunch, and Howl and turned into a major fan. This movie is exceptionally well-made and presented. It does have some Hollywood stars like Johnny Depp, but they are only reading the works of Beat authors, and do not have a major role. This is just a great documentary which contains valuable information and interviews with major beat characters who have since passed away. This is a must have for any fan of the beats, hippies, yippies, drugs, american literary movements, the counterculture, or just good documentaries in general. I absolutely love it and have watched it several times.",5,The counterculture lives!,986947200,"04 11, 2001",2001,1234,"['serious', 'documentary', 'beat', '/', 'hippie', 'movement', 'tons', 'old', 'footage', 'interviews', 'many', 'most', 'prominent', 'beat', 'figures', 'Ginsberg', 'Kerouac', 'Burroughs', 'Corso', 'Ferlinghetti', 'etc', 'etc', 'historical', 'footage', 'events', 'Democratic', 'National', 'Convention', ""'68"", 'be-in', 'San', 'Francisco', ""'67"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'beats', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'watched', 'documentary', 'PBS', 'watching', 'i', 'immediately', 'became', 'interested', 'movement', 'started', 'reading', 'lot', 'major', 'works', 'Road', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Howl', 'turned', 'major', 'fan', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'well-made', 'presented', 'have', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'are', 'only', 'reading', 'works', 'Beat', 'authors', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'major', 'role', 'just', 'great', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'information', 'interviews', 'major', 'beat', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'must', 'have', 'fan', 'beats', 'hippies', 'yippies', 'drugs', 'american', 'literary', 'movements', 'counterculture', 'just', 'good', 'documentaries', 'general', 'absolutely', 'love', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times']",N/A
