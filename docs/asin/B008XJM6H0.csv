Of the first season there are many episodes I have never seen which was a surprise to me, I have noticed this in other cartoon series, Transformers for example, I am convinced that they showed certain shows in different regions, kinda cool because I tend to remember most of what I had seen, so new stuff is, well new stuff.

I got it thinking it was gonna contain new material on it. But No it contains the exact same extras as BCI. The only new things in this set are The 30th Celebration of He-Man. They all talked about the toys and thier Memories. But they do have a soundtrack, it's very short. It doesn't contain half of the music that was used in the 80s Cartoon. There was ALOT more music in the cartoon that wasn't on the CD. I'd say the entire CD is about 15 minutes long. So, I'd suggest if you already own the BCI sets, then don't get this, save your money.

1578137,A6S7BFWB40M6B,B008XJM6H0,KAB,"[18, 20]","UPDATE:As many may have noticed, DISC 3 of SEASON 2 in the collections that were sent out does not play properly. Many disatisfied customers have contacted MillCreekEntertainment and received replacement discs (the replacement disc does resemble DISC 7 of SEASON 1 but it is, in fact, the defective disc, just from its individual release). The replacement disc does play perfectly but the fact that so many collections have the same defective disc suggests a major oversight on Mill Creek's part that could have been avoided with attention to detail. Hopefully, Mill Creek understands the problem in future releases and will correct it. Anyway, on to the original review...I bought this in honor of the 30th Anniversary of Filmation's most successful project (and because my BTC-BCI discs are starting to show signs of scratching).Anyway, the film and sound on these discs are CRISP and CLEAR! Weighed against my BTC/BCI sets , these seem to be IMPROVEMENTS on what was already pretty impressive several years ago (believe me; this is saying something since these discs cram more material on a single disc than the original company did. Therefore, of importance to note is that the episodes are in widescreen format). True, the BTC/BCI sets contain twice as many of those entertaining Character Profiles on their discs as these do (four separate sets with 50 Profiles per rather than two to complete the original series).Anyway, there are a few minor drawbacks even to the collection honoring the Thirtieth Anniversary of MOTU. About a minute of the ""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" is missing from these and the original sets and is, therefore, probably gone forever (it has been rumored that the master film for the ""Diamond Ray..."" episode was damaged). It's not missing much but it creates an awkward transition in the episode (watch carefully and you'll know what I mean). Also, the ""New Adventures..."" is in ""fan favorite"" format here and the complete sets have been out of print for long enough that a working copy now would cost quite a bit of money for two sets of 32-33 episodes. This collection's treatment of the ""New Adventures..."" is, unfortunately, reflexive of how MOTU fans treated the ""New Adventures..."" back when they were first run.Of additional note is the fact that Disc 3 of Season 2 (the 11th of 22 Discs I think) has a glaring issue in which only seven of ten episodes will play properly (the problem begins around midway through ""Three on a Dare"" for a lot of people and is pervasive through ""Just a Little Lie"" and ""One For All."") In a collection of 189 episodes, this costs us at least three but, since the problem has occurred on many peoples' discs, it is a problem with how the discs were pressed and, therefore, should be addressed. Until such a time, I have deducted one star since I originally typed this.Anyway, in terms of the original ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" and the 2002 series, this collection is great for those who didn't invest in the BTC/BCI sets. For those who still have working copies of the original sets, if you wish to purchase at all (there is no REAL new material here), I would recommend purchasing this collection at a reasonable price (it is available NEW for $55.00 just twenty-four hours after its release) and once Mill Creek has had time to address the problems in these sets. While the BTC-BCI sets retain the advantage of including a more impressive library of CHARACTER PROFILES, again I say, the production value of the episodes appear to be slightly improved on this collection.",4,This Collection HAS the Power,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,3557,"['UPDATE', 'many', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'DISC', '3', 'SEASON', '2', 'collections', 'were', 'sent', 'out', 'not', 'play', 'properly', 'Many', 'disatisfied', 'customers', 'have', 'contacted', 'MillCreekEntertainment', 'received', 'replacement', 'discs', 'replacement', 'disc', 'resemble', 'DISC', '7', 'SEASON', '1', 'fact', 'defective', 'disc', 'just', 'individual', 'release', 'replacement', 'disc', 'play', 'perfectly', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'collections', 'have', 'same', 'defective', 'disc', 'major', 'oversight', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'attention', 'detail', 'Hopefully', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'problem', 'future', 'releases', 'will', 'correct', 'Anyway', 'original', 'review', 'bought', 'honor', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Filmation', 'most', 'successful', 'project', 'BTC-BCI', 'discs', 'are', 'starting', 'show', 'signs', 'scratching', '.Anyway', 'film', 'sound', 'discs', 'are', 'CRISP', 'CLEAR', 'Weighed', 'BTC/BCI', 'sets', 'seem', 'be', 'IMPROVEMENTS', 'was', 'already', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'believe', 'saying', 'something', 'discs', 'cram', 'more', 'material', 'single', 'disc', 'original', 'company', 'did', 'Therefore', 'importance', 'note', 'episodes', 'are', 'widescreen', 'format', 'True', 'BTC/BCI', 'sets', 'contain', 'twice', 'as', 'many', 'entertaining', 'Character', 'Profiles', 'discs', 'do', 'four', 'separate', 'sets', '50', 'Profiles', 'rather', 'two', 'complete', 'original', 'series', '.Anyway', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'even', 'collection', 'honoring', 'Thirtieth', 'Anniversary', 'MOTU', 'minute', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'Disappearance', 'missing', 'original', 'sets', 'therefore', 'probably', 'gone', 'forever', 'been', 'rumored', 'master', 'film', 'Diamond', 'Ray', 'episode', 'was', 'damaged', 'not', 'missing', 'much', 'awkward', 'transition', 'episode', 'watch', 'carefully', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Also', 'New', 'Adventures', 'fan', 'favorite', 'format', 'here', 'complete', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'print', 'long', 'enough', 'working', 'copy', 'now', 'would', 'cost', 'quite', 'bit', 'money', 'two', 'sets', '32-33', 'episodes', 'collection', 'treatment', 'New', 'Adventures', 'unfortunately', 'reflexive', 'how', 'MOTU', 'fans', 'treated', 'New', 'Adventures', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'run.Of', 'additional', 'note', 'fact', 'Disc', '3', 'Season', '2', '11th', '22', 'Discs', 'think', 'glaring', 'issue', 'only', 'seven', 'ten', 'episodes', 'will', 'play', 'properly', 'problem', 'around', 'midway', 'Three', 'Dare', 'lot', 'people', 'pervasive', 'Just', 'Little', 'Lie', 'One', 'collection', '189', 'episodes', 'least', 'three', 'problem', 'occurred', 'many', 'peoples', 'discs', 'problem', 'how', 'discs', 'were', 'pressed', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'time', 'have', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'originally', 'typed', 'this.Anyway', 'terms', 'original', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', '2002', 'series', 'collection', 'great', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'invest', 'BTC/BCI', 'sets', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'working', 'copies', 'original', 'sets', 'wish', 'purchase', 'REAL', 'new', 'material', 'here', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'collection', 'reasonable', 'price', 'available', 'NEW', '55.00', 'just', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'release', 'once', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'had', 'time', 'address', 'problems', 'sets', 'BTC-BCI', 'sets', 'retain', 'advantage', 'including', 'more', 'impressive', 'library', 'CHARACTER', 'PROFILES', 'again', 'say', 'production', 'value', 'episodes', 'appear', 'be', 'slightly', 'improved', 'collection']",Masters of the Universe - 30th Anniversary
