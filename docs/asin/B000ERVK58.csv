978345,AQ990HW13DP08,B000ERVK58,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[3, 3]","This sad and gritty film has earned a half dozen festival awards and nominations. It follows the tragic fates of three young women from Jersey City's ghetto--Suzette (a pregnant runaway teenager), Marisol (a crack addict and young mother), and Oz (a drug dealer), whose lives intersect after their separate paths to prison. Nearly every influence in their lives, whether personal or social, is harmful to them, including school, music, home, friends, drug and alcohol abuse, and, most of all, their trash-talking, gangsta boys. The girls live in a malevolent universe that is parallel to anything you would consider normal. Whether they got there by bad luck, bad choices, or by a heartless society that has victimized them is debatable. The director shows his hand, though, with several shots of the Statue of Liberty.",4,all bad all the time,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,819,"['sad', 'gritty', 'film', 'earned', 'half', 'dozen', 'festival', 'awards', 'nominations', 'tragic', 'fates', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'Jersey', 'City', 'ghetto', 'Suzette', 'pregnant', 'runaway', 'teenager', 'Marisol', 'crack', 'addict', 'young', 'mother', 'Oz', 'drug', 'dealer', 'lives', 'intersect', 'separate', 'paths', 'prison', 'Nearly', 'influence', 'lives', 'personal', 'social', 'harmful', 'including', 'school', 'music', 'home', 'friends', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'most', 'trash-talking', 'gangsta', 'boys', 'girls', 'live', 'malevolent', 'universe', 'parallel', 'anything', 'would', 'consider', 'normal', 'got', 'there', 'bad', 'luck', 'bad', 'choices', 'heartless', 'society', 'victimized', 'debatable', 'director', 'hand', 'several', 'shots', 'Statue', 'Liberty']",On the Outs

In most films depicting the harsh realities of growing up in the ghetto, the main characters are men, and black. I am proud now to see women playing the lead roles in ghetto stories.I can relate to 2 out of the 3 stories. Marisol was my mother before she(my mom) was killed. I was Marisol's daughter, hungry and wondering when or if my mom was coming home.I made a real personal connection with Oz. I related to her tomboyish ways and her attitude. Oz was tough, but only because she had to be. With an aging grandmother, and a drug-addicted mother who has repeatedly let her down in life, Oz's only choice of survival that she knew was the streets. She had to make the way for her and her brother whom she loved terribly. At seventeen, that was a lot to take on. And she thought she could, until it all came crashing down on her too fast.Suzette was a promising young teenager. And she was just that; a teenager. With a hard-working mom who was rarely at home, Suzette was free. Too free. She broke the rules and took a chance on a situation she simply didn't understand. Daydreams defaced reality and she ended up pregnant. Seeing that the boyfriend accepted her situation, she did what most teenagers who believe in fairy tales do; she put her trust in him and a dream. Then she gets caught with his gun and ends up in juvie.I must say that I am glad to see a film like this in a latin perspective. It shows how black and latin livelihood are very similar in the ghetto and that we are not alone in our struggles. It shows three latin teenage girls who buckle under the pressure with the choice of taking responsibility for their actions and making it better or worse.Respectable applause. Shout out to Judy Marte (Oz). Good job on being a remarkable tomboy for the very first time. You made an impact on me.",5,Watched it 8 times.

978347,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ERVK58,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 9]","Chances are that if you watch much film and/or television--you won't find the subject matter of ""On The Outs"" to be particularly new or enlightening.  This small film is a cautionary tale of drug use in the inner city and how it affects the local youth.  By intertwining three character studies, the film gives you several different tales of addiction, dealing, and corruption that intersect at a juvenile detention center.  But while the stories told in ""On The Outs"" may seem quite familiar, that does not mean that this film isn't also worth seeing.  For what is unusual, ""Outs"" is told from the vantage point of three underaged girls--and that's not a demographic that is commonly investigated in these types of film.  Believably written and performed, ""On The Outs"" is a worthy addition to the genre of realistic urban street films.The film follows three girls.  We have Oz, a successful drug dealer who is alienated from her addict mother.  She bounces into and out of the detention center frequently on routine drug busts, it's just a normal part of her regular life.  Marisol, a single mother, struggles with an addiction and the potential loss of her daughter into the foster system.  And Suzette, a young girl with a supportive mother, falls in love with a local street dealer and tries to enter his world.  All three characters are believable and all of the actresses, though unknown, are effective at depicting the different stages within these sometimes unpleasant stories.This is not a fun film, but nor does it seek to deliver some ""important"" political message.  It's just a slice-of-life drama about characters caught up in a system.  While you may root for them, there will be no conventional ""happy endings""--their situations are too realistic to tie everything up nicely.  Glimmers of hope and moments of heartbreak alternate in this quiet, small film.  Effective, but not groundbreaking, the film succeeds due to the committed performances and nicely realized scenarios.

I found the first 70 minutes of the movie kind of boring, and I had a very hard time keeping my attention on the movie. I yawned two times.  I could not feel sorry for these characters because, simply, put, as the saying goes, ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.."" This one criminal woman was behind bars crying hysterically when she learned her baby is going to be taken away to foster homes. Well, what do you expect when mom is a crack addict--it made me think she should have thought about that before using illicit drugs. They all offend against society and then cry the blues when they get caught. Oookay where is the tear jerking scene?It makes you more aware that many young people who are irresponsible living for pleasures of the flesh and quick sensations are having babies left and right which will be supported by our tax dollars, that we live in a society that is so dysfunctional. MULTITUDES and multitudes of such youngsters are doing the same thing--popping out babies having irresponsible relations because it feels good, hense: Poverty breeding more poverty and misery, birth control is never even entertained or thought about. Just living for the moment at the expense--consequences of having sex of course and nothing to do with family planning--of children who are born to such unresponsible, even dope-addicted, so called parents. What a very very sad world we live in.But more often than not, these young people brought trouble to themselves. And even when given a chance, reoffend..and get caught.

""On the Outs"" has all of this and more. It's a daring, bold and courageous character study of three teenage girls caught in a whirlwind of inner city desperation and desolation. Each actress gave an amazing performance, especially Judy Marte who just has an effortless and natural screen presence. I'll say it here first and mark my words, Marte may be one of this generations most gifted and promising actresses. She plays Oz, a thugged out drug dealer caring for her mentally disabled brother and battling internally with her dope fiend mother. Then there is Paola Mendoza as Marisol, a crack-addicted single mother who loses custody of her child while in a juvenile corrections center. And then there is Anny Mariano as Suzette, a young impressionable teen who falls in love with a drug dealer and his dangerous world.
