The movie is about a loser who falls inlove with his new neighbor and kidnaps her dog to get her attention. The sick and unrealistic thing is that they actually get closer from this, you can see jokes coming from a mile away in this lame unrealastic plotHow can any say this is a romantic comedy? Whats romantic about stealing a womens puppy? And another thing, why don't the two actors playing the french people speak french in the scenes where they are alone? I never saw the end of this but I already knew what was gonna hap... he gets the girl. David Spade and Artie Lange have some real funny parts, but they can't save this miserably script (which Spade co-wrote) This just missed getting pne star because its so terrible its almost funny, but almost is the key word.",2,"Semi--Funny, unrealistic, and stupidly predictible.",1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,896,"['David', 'Spade', 'was', 'funny', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'even', 'funnier', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'site', 'movie', 'loser', 'who', 'inlove', 'new', 'neighbor', 'kidnaps', 'dog', 'get', 'attention', 'sick', 'unrealistic', 'thing', 'actually', 'get', 'closer', 'can', 'see', 'jokes', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'lame', 'unrealastic', 'plotHow', 'can', 'say', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Whats', 'romantic', 'stealing', 'womens', 'puppy', 'thing', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'two', 'actors', 'playing', 'french', 'people', 'speak', 'french', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'alone', 'never', 'saw', 'end', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'gon', 'hap', 'girl', 'David', 'Spade', 'Artie', 'Lange', 'have', 'real', 'funny', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'miserably', 'script', 'Spade', 'co-wrote', 'just', 'missed', 'getting', 'pne', 'star', 'so', 'terrible', 'almost', 'funny', 'almost', 'key', 'word']",N/A
111293,A2582KMXLK2P06,0790742896,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I shouldn't like this movie as much as I do.  I've always had mixed feelings with David Spade as an actor.  Sometimes his sarcasm is really witty and funny, other times just plain annoying.  Maybe I was in the right mood this morning (pumped up for some NFL football!) but I found his performance truly remarkable and hilarious throughout Lost & Found.It's about David's character trying to impress his French neighbor that he finds really attractive (and you know, good taste there- she's just an unbelievably good looking woman!) So what does he do?  How does he impress the lady of his dreams?  By stealing and hiding her dog of course!  That's the theme for the entire film.  David's plan is to return the dog later that night once David and his neighbor become close and hit off a relationship, however... that darn dog!  He's insane!  He can ruin any plan that originally had good intentions!  The dog eventually swallows an important wedding ring and so, in one extremely funny segment, David has to search through an entire park full of dog poop and retrieve the ring, lol.  Not a job I'd personally want no matter HOW much money you paid me, haha.David's clumsy, overweight roommate tends to be more trouble than helpful.  Whenever the attractive neighbor makes an unexpected appearance while David is holding onto the dog, he has to quickly and frantically find a way to hide the dog which leads to several more funny segments.  His roommate/friend always comes close to spilling the beans and (unintentionally) revealing the dogs location but due to David's quick reactions and timing, he's able to prevent that from occurring.  In one instance, the roommate picks up and holds the dog while peeking through the curtains as David and the French woman have a conversation outside, and David claps in the womans face as a way to distract her from glancing over near the curtains, lol.The French woman has a French man in her life and he frequently tries ways to flatter her, so a little competition between David and the man takes place.  They both get under each others skin pretty effectively!Overall, I really enjoy this movie.  Perhaps it's slightly more foul-mouthed than what you'd normally see in a romantic comedy since this film has a clear intention of being offensive on several occasions (but usually avoids using the F word which is a rarity in films that attempt the same style) and it's worth watching for the clever and well-told storyline as well.  Even David Spade is more bearable than usual.

111295,A2S02XWWNNHUIX,0790742896,C. E. Miles,"[3, 3]","Let me begin by asking you this: Are you a David Spade fan? If you are then you will definitely like this movie. If not, then chances are his  antics will grow tiresome very early. I have found that with many people  it's either love or hate with David Spade. On the other hand I enjoy his  comedy and I loved this movie. Spade plays Dylan, a struggling restaurateur  who falls for his beautiful new cello playing neighbor played by the always  lovely and charming Sophie Marceau (The World is Not Enough). Unfortunately  she hardly knows he exist. Dylan soon devises a plan to win her affections  involving kidnapping her dog. As you may guess things quickly turn sour for  Dylan. A missing ring, Lila's greasy ex-boyfriend, an obnoxious prot&eacute;g&eacute;  that wants to be ""just like him"" not to mention a huge catering gig that  could make or break his business, and you have some really funny moments.Jeff Pollack's direction keeps the film moving, and tries to keep all of  the gag's believable, even Spade's Neil Diamond impression. Spade is his  usual sarcastic self, and his chemistry with Marceau is very good. Artie  Lang is very funny as the Spade wanna be, a part that must have been  written with Chis Farley in mind. There are also several good cameo's by  John Lovitz (The Dog Whisperer), Martin Sheen (The Bank President), and  several card playing old ladies that anyone over thirty will surely  recognize.

The story was cute; nerdy guy falls in love with the girl next door (Sophie Marceau) who totally outclasses him, and he decides the best way to  woo her is to steal her dog and charm her while he pretends to help her  find it.I thought the romance angle was enchanting and the better part  of the script than the goofy Spade skits with the dog. Much of the film was  Spade having sarcastic dialogue with the pooch and it was sadly unfunny.  His bits with Marceau were better. By far the funniest scene in the movie  was his Neil Diamond impression. That was one of the few scenes worthy of  his comedic talent.The lately ubiquitous Sophie Marceau is sweet as the  girl next door. She really didn't have much to do in this film except be  French and adorable, which is not much of a stretch for her. She handled it  with aplomb.Probably the most consistently humorous character was Artie  Lange as the psychotically sycophantic Wally. He stole just about every  scene he was in, and with his enormous size and girth was visually the  perfect comic foil to the diminutive Spade.Martin Sheen had a bit part  as the banker, Mr. Millstone and once again proved that no matter how small  a part you give him, he will overact and ruin it.I gave it a 6 overall.

Witty dialogue, well developed characters, and the classic story of boy stalks hot chick, boy steals hot chick's dog, hot chick finds boy mildly tolerable, boy lip syncs a Neil Diamond song, hot chick finds out boy stole her dog from smarmy foreign boyfriend, boy apologizes, hot chick marries him for a green card.  Fresh off her winning performance in Braveheart, Sophie Marceau is serviceable as Spade's love interest and concert cellist.  She didn't know how lucky she is to act alongside such a talent.

I know it didn't do too well in theaters, but GIVE IT A CHANCE!Lost & Found is the story of a restaurant owner (spade) named Dylan Ramsey, who is doing okay with his cafe, but not so well in the ladies department. He goes through one meaningless relationship after another, until he meets Lila, his new, cello playing neighbor who moves from France with her dog, Jack. Dylan fails to get any sort of attention from this girl until he decides to kidnap her dog, in order to spend time with and get to know her. Humor ensues, romance ensues. All-in-all, a great, fun romantic comedy that i recommend to anyone.",5,"Great comedy, with a good heart, and that David Spade touch!",1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,644,"['movie', 'real', 'keeper', 'folks', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'theaters', 'GIVE', 'IT', 'A', 'CHANCE', 'Lost', 'Found', 'story', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'spade', 'named', 'Dylan', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'doing', 'okay', 'cafe', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'ladies', 'department', 'one', 'meaningless', 'relationship', 'Lila', 'new', 'cello', 'playing', 'neighbor', 'who', 'France', 'dog', 'Jack', 'Dylan', 'get', 'sort', 'attention', 'girl', 'kidnap', 'dog', 'order', 'spend', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'Humor', 'ensues', 'romance', 'ensues', 'All-in-all', 'great', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'i', 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A
