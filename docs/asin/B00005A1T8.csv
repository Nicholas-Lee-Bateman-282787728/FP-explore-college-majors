Alpha's prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and reasonable cost make it a worthwhile purchase.With stand-up comics Phyllis Diller and Jack E. ('Fat Jack') Leonard, plus the musical talents of Johnny Tillotson and the cheesecake appeal of Jayne Mansfield, one would expect THE FAT SPY to be a decent comedy. Instead, this bomb's notoriety is as a dweller on many ""Worst Movie"" lists. Brian Donlevy looks embarrassed as he lurks among the ashes of his screen career.Miss Mansfield was 5 and 6 months pregnant when this odiferous beach film (must've been low tide) was shot on-location at Cape Coral, Florida. Here, several nonsensically unrelated plotlines are loosely tacked onto the search for a fountain of youth at a remote island off Florida's coast. Donlevy is both Jayne's father and angry owner of the island which has been invaded by prying teen treasure hunters. 'Fat Jack' plays a pair of brothers-- one who's in love with Jayne and the other who has the hots for Miss Diller.Yah, it's THAT stupid!

575983,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B00005A1T8,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[13, 15]","Describing this movie is like describing the love of a child or incense smoke rising, but I will do my best. The Fat Spy is a story as old as time itself, the ongoing search for the Fountain of Youth. Only this time our heroes discover that the Fountain is not actually a fountain of water, but two black twin roses growing from the same stem.Well I'm sure everyone buys or sees this movie for one reason, Jayne Mansfield, so let's talk about her. I've never seen her as heavy as she did in this movie. Granted she is still beautiful and stunning, but the hourglass figure is gone as she is a bit thick in the middle. By modern spaghetti-thin model standards, she could even be described as fat, but to me who can appreciate a fine woman, she looked great. One scene has her wrapped in only what can be described as the happiest towel in Hollywood. You get some great cleavage and chest shots as she dries herself. She also sings a number to her love interest 'Irving'. Unfortunately, this film will not cement Jayne's acting abilities for immortality. Let's face it, she was what she was. A great body and a rival (ha ha) to Marilyn Monroe. Jayne seems to go out of her way to act just like her with the dreamy, whispery voice and dumb blonde routine that Marilyn found inescapable as her career went on. In one scene where Jayne is tied to an AC unit she screams for help. She suddenly pauses and turns to the camera and pathetically starts doing the Marilyn pout and blowing kisses.This film which was probably filmed on a budget that couldn't drive a car across the country was shot on a lake which was supposed to be a beach. This film is actually a musical and any excuse possible is used to throw in bad singing and worse dancing. Take for instance the song sang before the opening credits even start. ""When people got money, they sure act funny"". One scene has the teenage group on the beach deciding they need to go to Cape Coral after 'discovering' a sign posted by a Florida Tourist attraction. All the girls swim out to the boat to start it up, while the guys all make their way to the dock, where quite handily, drums and guitars are found. They sing a number while waiting for the girls to pull up with the boat. Another song is sung by Phyllis Diller. She mostly talks words to music rather than singing, so there is some mercy here. However the drop on the floor and laugh until you cry scene is the 'Everybody do the Turtle' song. The song is so terrible, it will linger in your head for days.There are some loose ends that don't quite tie up as the movie ends. One kid goes fishing in a rubber raft (he sings a song while fishing of course), and catches a mermaid. Well after going back to shore he decides he loves her and wants to go find her. He starts moping around and the last mention of him is his clothes are found on the shore. Reckon he swam out naked to find his love.The film quality is terrible, even on DVD. The picture is grainy and the sound is horrible. At times you can't hear the lines because the surf is too loud. Then there are the cartoon balloons that try to move the movie along and attempt to assist the viewer in the progress of the film. Just before the ending credits there were promises of upcoming movies: The Return of Fat Spy, Bride of Fat Spy, and Son of Fat Spy.

Well, a year ago I bought all the dvds available on amazon.com with her. I have just watched this.3 years ago I bought the ""Promises, Promises"" video and loathed it. Now if I try to remember it, I see flashes of good looking Jayne. Well you know how it goes, time makes all things look better. It even makes you think a stinker like that wasn't so bad.Well and here comes ""The Fat Spy"". Can't be that bad I thought. I opens with 2 guys singing a catchy song, which still turns in my head. Then you see a company boss who is giving orders to her daughter, played by Jayne Mansfield. He is sitting at his desk watching towards the camera, as if his interlocutor is on the other side of the desk. But Jayne is standing right beside him.Is someone not shown in the picture? Was this filmed in Cinerama (R) and he's been cut-off? Or is it just the movie was filmed? Some madcap trick? A way to spare money because they only had one camera and having the actors speak lines while standing next to each other would solve the problem? Seems like it.Then cut to a bunch of youngsters driving a boat to an island. The plot is unintelligible as the scenes seem to be trown in the movie like that. They start singing and dancing like in a beach movie. Some awkward dances, balloons explaining what's happening. The scene where at the end the girls get into the boat while the guys walk on the pier and start singing, well, I thought that it was the girls turn to get wet and pick up the boys, who stay dry this way. Some singing solo, the most awful one being by the girl in blue bikini, especially her dance movies while singing LOL. Horrible, just horrible.Jayne Mansfield sports an awful hairstyle (if you can call it that), she lives up to her reputation as just trying to act like MM, and there is not one other actor that can be called one here.The only redeemable parts are when JM flies to the island, because she acts silly and looks great with helmets (really) and when she holds her boyfriend at gunpoint.Phyllis Diller, well, she must be worst of the lot here. I love her but here, oh well, she just plain sucks. Her name is funny though (Camille Salamandre). She looks so weird, why does she always have frizzy hair and wears make up only on her upper eyelids??To tell the truth, I was bored out of my mind, couldn't wait to get it over with, and, counting on the movie ending at 75min as the cover says, I checked my dvd player and it said there were other 6 minutes of it.
