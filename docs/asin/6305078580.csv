They are mostly just fun. I don't view these movies as horror. There is a great deal of humour in them. Just  imagine several Puppets running around with their own personality and  killing method. Either killing for good causes, but not always. Not easy to  really explain these movies in a few lines. But if you are looking at this  review, I am pretty sure you allready know what the movies are about.With this boxed set you really do get your moneys worth. Before I bought  it I was sceptical, so many bad reviews on sound and picture. But both  image and audio is OK. Really, how much do you expect from a series that  has been made for direct release on VHS? The quality is not something to  brag about, but it is OK. At least I did not expect more from it.You get  all seven movies, and each one of them has a great making-of featurette, as  well as trailer and some cast-info. In addition to the seven movies you get  an 8th DVD. This disc contains 45 trailers. All Full Moon Pictures  trailers. Only a few of them are out on DVD, but it is still fun to look at  all the silly, but cool, movies they make.So all in all, you do get your  moneys worth, and it really is a great oppertunety to own all the movies  with some added extras. If you are a fan, then you need this box. If you  are new to the series, then you should look into what the movies are like.  Maybe rent one on VHS, I am pretty sure you will be hooked.

447419,A13JPNQI7WEQ7C,6305078580,A. Snyder,"[1, 2]","Anyone who has a soft spot for B-Movies knows of B-movie legend Charles Band's production company Full Moon. Anyone that knows Full Moon knows that the company's bread and better was the Puppet Master franchise. The first film was released in 1989 and was a huge success fro the new company. A sting of solid sequels followed throughout the early 90's all the way through Puppet Master 5, which was advertised and proclaimed to be ""the final chapter"". A spin-off trilogy entitled ""Puppet Wars"" was then announced to start in 1995. However some drama went down at the house of Full Moon that would change the company forever. The major change is that the partnership between Full Moon and Paramount (their distributor) ended. Information differs for why their partnership dissolved but this event marks the decline of Full Moon and the dark years of the company began.Out of these dark years of Full Moon came the resurrection of the Puppet Master franchise with the release of the sixth film ""Curse of the Puppet Master"", a sequel no doubt made to make a quick buck for the failing company and the final product shows it. Following is a list of problems with the film:#1 - THE PLOT. The plot is a complete rip-off of the 1973 horror film SSSSSSS. In that film a father turns his aid/daughters boyfriend into a snake. In this one a puppet. Not much difference.#2  - STOCK FOOTAGE. Many of the puppet scenes are recycled footage from previous entries. Even scenes from the horrid wavy DVD transfer from Puppet Master II are present! Stock footage spliced in to represent ""new footage"" just reeks of cheapness and laziness.#3 - CONTINUITY. Some continuity errors from previous entries is acceptable, but bringing back characters that were clearly destroyed in other entries and bringing them back without even the lamest explanation isn't acceptable and an insult to the fans.#4 - THE EFFECTS. This marks the first entry not to feature those nifty stop motion effects of the late great Dave Allen. Instead we get stiff and poor rod puppetry.#5 - THE TITLE. This one may be minor but I hate when series start going all wonky with the sequel titles (Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street...I'M LOOKING AT YOU!). The titles of the first films were straight forward with numbers...so why change it now?Overall I felt that this was a cheap-jack entry made with no intention other than $$. They took a plot from an old movie, slapped in stock footage and called it good. Hard to believe this drivel came from the same director of the enjoyable ""Puppet Master III."" Surprisingly this isn't the worst entry in the series as Retro Puppet Master, Puppet Master: The Legacy, and Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys would be soon to come. A tenth entry entitled ""Puppet Master: Axis of Evil"" is being filmed at the moment but I wouldn't hold my breath. My advice so far is stick to entries 1 - 5.

447421,A364W6U6YL219D,6305078580,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[2, 3]","Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) After part five was promised to be 'The Final Chapter,' Full Moon Entertainment promptly started promoting the return of their popular characters in the ""Puppet Wars"" series, which looked to be fairly ambitious in scope, at least if you believed the drawn-long-before-the-movie-was-made poster art. But once again, Full Moon's ideas were bigger than their bank account, so instead we get this extremely cheap and tedious hour and fourteen minutes.The 'story' has the puppets suddenly and mysteriously under the thumb of a maniacal scientist trying to use their secrets to construct a life size puppet/human hybrid. Why? I have no idea. In and around this, the scientist's daughter and slow witted handyman frolic. Of course, the young dimwit is targeted by the scientist as the perfect specimen for his experiments, thereby seriously jeopardizing the romance. Finally, waaaaayy into this stodgy soap opera, the scientist sends the puppets out to kill a couple of guys. Yawn. This is far and away the worst of the Puppet Master movies.  This one truly looks like it was shot over a weekend on a budget of about $10,000. It was directed by David DeCoteau, who also made the best of the series, part three. But apparently recognizing the handicaps he was working with here, DeCoteau wisely chose to throw one of his female pseudonyms on for the credits.My last round of long winded squawking about this movie is in regards to where it fits in the continuity of the series. (I don't know why I care about this, but I do.) It doesn't work as a continuation of part five, since that set up the idea of more adventures with their new puppet master. About the only place it fits is between parts two and four (since three was a WWII era flashback). That still leaves two untold stories--#1: what happened at the mental hospital they were heading to at the end of part two; and how that led them into the clutches of the evil doctor here. Then you somehow have to #2: get the puppets from this movie's nonsensical non-ending back to the Bodega Bay Inn for parts four and five. It's too bad; when these movies work they are fun little flicks.

Andre Toulon was a man whose friends were killed by the Nazis, so he transferred their souls into killer puppets so Toulon and his friends could get even with the Nazis.  After Toulon died, the puppets had many different masters, and their latest master is only interested in two things: 1, Using the puppets to put on shows and make money.  2, Find a way to copy Toulon's technique of converting people into puppets.  So far, all the attempts of the new master have been unsuccessful, but now he thinks he's found a way.  He finds a young man named Tank who is very dumb but incredibly strong and an expert at woodworking.  The new master tricks Tank into carving up a puppet body so he can transfer Tank's soul into it.

447423,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,6305078580,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER""Puppet Master"" is one of my all time favorite film series ever without a doubt. In fact it could be my favorite, right up there with ""Hellraiser"" and ""The Evil Dead"". I remember not even knowing about this film when it first came out and was completely surprised when I happened upon it at the video store. I grabbed it and checked it out that night. Of course I went to the mall that weekend and bought it since I had to have it. Eventually like all of them I grabbed the DVD as well since I had the VHS at first only.The story follows a young man that goes by Tank who has a great talent for wood carving. He is approached one day by a man named Dr. Magrew and his daughter Jane. They step in on his behalf when he is being picked on by some local bullies and then notice a piece of wood he was working on. Magrew quickly offers him a job at his museum to carve for him. Things go well and he strikes up a romance with Jane who introduces him to the Puppets that her father now has. Of course things are not as they seem and there may be more to Dr. Magrew than anyone including his daughter think.Now this came out years after the 5th film which was supposed to be the final film in the series. Even still it is the final Puppet Master film to have that old school Full Moon feel to it. Now that does not mean it is as good as the others. In fact it falls short of those original ones but it may still be the best of the sequels since then. Now it is obvious that the puppets are not used like they were before with the stop motion stuff. With that said that did not stop me from liking this flick, there was just something else I can't put my finger on that brings it down in the ratings for me.It could be the ending that just seems kinda, eh, but I get what they were going for. Writer Benjamin Carr came up with an interesting storyline for this installment but it wasn't executed to its full potential. Maybe that's on director David DeCoteau who has done some great films [including the best film in the franchise if you ask most ""Puppet Master 3""] but like I said it is not a horrible flick. That saving grace may be the acting here. George Peck is excellent as Dr. Magrew and may be the MVP of the production; he does not get enough work in my opinion. Emily Harrison who plays his daughter is great here as well and plays the girl next door type perfectly. Josh Green plays young Tank and plays him kinda weird and quirky but still friendly. Those performances plus the supporting players did a great job.This was a fun addition to the series that does not live up to its predecessors but is better than the things that followed.

447425,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,6305078580,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is an enjoyable, albeit not original, entry in the infamous Puppet Master series.  It has a script that blatantly mimics the classic creature feature ""Sssssss"" scene by scene.  Instead of a mad scientist turning humans into cobras, Dr. Magrew (George Peck) is turning them into living puppets.  He recruits an adorably dopey young man, Robert, (Josh Green) to become his new lab assistant.  His incredibly cute daughter Jane (Emily Harrison) is smitten by him.  Meanwhile, they are harassed by Joey (Michael D. Guerin) the town muscle head who likes to wear tank tops and lift weights.  Instead of employing snakes to commit murders, Dr. Magrew uses Andre Toulon's living puppets, especially Blade and Tunneler.Though not as well crafted as ""Sssssss,"" ""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is highly recommended because of its character development.  You can't help but adore poor Robert and Emily - a type of Romeo and Juliet.  You feel much sympathy for them, knowing that their love is doomed by Dr. Magrew's evil plans.  The cast is a gorgeous one, lending the film a touch of eroticism.  The acting from the leads is rather good considering that none of them are big name stars.  Many fans complained about the film's open ending - a lack of resolution.  The open, downbeat ending was a very popular device used in the 1970's.  It was often used to chill and terrify the audience.  The ending for ""Curse of the Puppet Master"" is very much like the one for ""Sssssss.""""The Curse of the Puppet Master"" deserves a place in the mad scientist genre.  I liken Dr. Magrew to Dr. Victor Frankenstein who strove to create new life.  Furthermore, if you haven't seen ""Sssssss,"" I recommend that you do.  Watch ""Sssssss"" and ""The Curse of the Puppet Master"" back to back and you will be surprised at the similarities.  The two films were released over twenty-five years apart.  The cast in ""Sssssss"" was high caliber.  Strother Martin was the mad scientist, Heather Menzies played his daughter, Dirk Benedict was the lab assistant, and Reb Brown was the bullying jock.  Does Hal Dresner know that Benjamin Carr stole his screenplay?  Only joking.  After all, imitation is the best form of flattery.",4,Mad Scientist Turns Humans Into Living Puppets,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2211,"['Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'original', 'entry', 'infamous', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'series', 'script', 'blatantly', 'classic', 'creature', 'feature', 'Sssssss', 'scene', 'scene', 'Instead', 'mad', 'scientist', 'turning', 'humans', 'cobras', 'Dr.', 'Magrew', 'George', 'Peck', 'turning', 'living', 'puppets', 'adorably', 'dopey', 'young', 'man', 'Robert', 'Josh', 'Green', 'become', 'new', 'lab', 'assistant', 'incredibly', 'cute', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Emily', 'Harrison', 'smitten', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'harassed', 'Joey', 'Michael', 'D.', 'Guerin', 'town', 'muscle', 'head', 'who', 'wear', 'tank', 'tops', 'lift', 'weights', 'Instead', 'employing', 'snakes', 'commit', 'murders', 'Dr.', 'Magrew', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'living', 'puppets', 'especially', 'Blade', 'Tunneler.Though', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'crafted', 'Sssssss', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'highly', 'recommended', 'character', 'development', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'adore', 'poor', 'Robert', 'Emily', 'type', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'knowing', 'love', 'doomed', 'Dr.', 'Magrew', 'evil', 'plans', 'cast', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'lending', 'film', 'touch', 'eroticism', 'acting', 'leads', 'rather', 'good', 'considering', 'none', 'are', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'Many', 'fans', 'complained', 'film', 'open', 'ending', 'lack', 'resolution', 'open', 'downbeat', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'device', 'used', '1970', 'was', 'often', 'used', 'chill', 'terrify', 'audience', 'ending', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'Sssssss', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'place', 'mad', 'scientist', 'genre', 'liken', 'Dr.', 'Magrew', 'Dr.', 'Victor', 'Frankenstein', 'who', 'strove', 'create', 'new', 'life', 'Furthermore', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Sssssss', 'recommend', 'do', 'Watch', 'Sssssss', 'Curse', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'back', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'apart', 'cast', 'Sssssss', 'was', 'high', 'caliber', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'was', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Heather', 'Menzies', 'played', 'daughter', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'was', 'lab', 'assistant', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'was', 'bullying', 'jock', 'Does', 'Hal', 'Dresner', 'know', 'Benjamin', 'Carr', 'stole', 'screenplay', 'Only', 'joking', 'imitation', 'best', 'form', 'flattery']",N/A

Puppet Master 6 (released under the title Curse of the Puppet Master) however is the major drop of the series and was made when Full Moon Pictures was having some finacial trouble. During this hard time at Full Moon they pumped out really cheap and really lame sequels in their successfull franchises (Subspecies IV and Trancers 6). Curse comes out better than some of their other sequels but it is still a band filmThe story is a direct steal from the 1970's horror film Ssssssssss. When have a young simpleton boy taken in by a freindly magician (with a dark secret) and his daughter. The boy and the daughter fall in love but her father has other plans for the boy....to turn him into a living puppet! Oh, the magician also has our lovable killer dolls as pets in cages.Fans of the series will notice many plot holes, the most noticable one being the return of Ms. Leech who was clearly burned to death in Puppet Master II.What makes this sequel sink lower is that Full Moon pulls a ""Roger Corman"" with some of the films footage. What I mean by this is that Full Moon pulls footage from previous Puppet Master films and splices it into this film play as NEW material. This is not flashback type storytelling containing clips from previous films. Roger Corman was notorious for this as he lifted scenese from previous films and spliced it into his new films. An example is the Deathstalker series where each sequel contains footage from the first Deathstalker played off as ""new"" footage. This is extremely cheap and hackeyed filmmaking that is an insult to fans.Curse of the Puppet Master may not be the worst of the overlong series (Retro Puppet Master and Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys take that ""prize"") but it is close.

As it sucks you in, and has you wondering whats going to happen, it's just all of a sudden over, and the credits begin to roll.It's like they ran out of funding for the movie, and didn't have any money left to shoot any more to finish it. I cant understand why the heck anyone would just  make an ending like that, one that's over in the blink of an eye.The rest of the film was kinda cheesy. The puppets looked pretty stupid, with their only animation being their hands moving up and down like... well, I don't know, like bad puppetearing I guess, kind of like bad imitations of ""Thunderbird's"". It almost seems like they where toys with limited animation that should have been playing door bell kind of music as they move around.I liked the plot and the movie up until the last 5 minutes. It just ceased to go on when it was starting to pick up and needed a final scene.

447428,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,6305078580,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","After sitting through the two previous train wrecks that were Puppet Master 4 and 5, I felt that this series had really no where to go but up. Thankfully, with Curse of the Puppet Master, the storyline goes totally away from the previous 2 movies. Though apparently the plot of this film rips off the old Sci-Fi Horror movie called Sssssss. Its a about a young man named Robert a.k.a ""Tank"" who is hired by the ""new"" puppet master named Dr. Magrew to help create the perfect puppet. Dr. Magrew has been unsuccessful in re-creating Andre Toulon's ability to bring puppets to life so far , but the Dr. has a dark secret, in that he's wanting to put Robert's soul into the puppet that Robert himself is creating so that the puppet will live. Again, the plot isn't great, but its gotta be better than the storyline to Part 4 and 5. However, just like the other Puppet Master films, there are some horrible screw ups that takes place here. First off, the puppet Leech Woman returns in this one, though she was clearly destroyed in Puppet Master 2. Not even that, but Leech Woman doesn't even have a kill in the film!! In fact, most of the puppets don't do much at all. The death count isn't that high as well. The end of the film makes no sense either. Throughout the movie, Robert is working on a puppet thats made out of wood. Yet, at the adbrupt ending of the film, the puppet that Robert had been working on appears to be some futuristic mechanical gadget made of metal, not wood. The ""special"" effects, if one has the nerve to call them that, have to been the worst of the series, and the editing and directing is horrible. Actually, in some cases, old footage is used from previous Puppet Master films and injected into this one. And don't worry, the acting is just as bad as everything else. Take special note of the way over-acting tough guy Sheriff!! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry! In a nutshell, this is horribly cheap-made film with crappy effects, bad directing, and terrible acting. To say its better than the some previous Puppet Master films in the series may be just splitting hairs, cause at this point, who really cares? But since this story, though it may have been ripped off, is slightly better than previous storylines about little demons from the underworld coming back to earth to do..well..whatever, I gotta give this film a slightly better rating than those previous sequels. As a stand alone film, its a tough watch.
