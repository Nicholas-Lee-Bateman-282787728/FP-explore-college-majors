1145184,A1H1V1OHRMSDTR,B00144PA06,"21st Century MAC Fan ""P.t.J.""","[11, 11]","I really enjoyed this show when it was originally on TV! It was nice to be able to see it all again on high quality DVD! Some of the included special feature interviews and commentaries touch on the controversy back then, when apparrently the show had already been CANCELLED, but NetWork exersized last minute contractual options to do several special TV Movie episodes over that summer, thus pulling the rug out from under Pierce Brosnan, who's agent reportedly had already negotiated a James Bond deal! (Pierce Brosnan didn't get James Bond role until years later) Stephanie Zimbalist was great it this, her signature role. I was a bit disappointed with plot twist in last few episodes where they have Laura Holt marry Remington Steele in sham marriage to prevent his deportation, & handsome I.N.S. agent assigned to discredit marriage becomes competitive love interest romancing Laura Holt! They perpetuate continueing theme of them never really getting together! (though last scene in final episode hints that they finally do) I have quarrel with quality of DVD DISKs in set I recieved! In 3 or 4 of the disks, there were sections that would not play (picture/sound disintigrated during Doris Roberts Interview,etc) In the last season ONE OF THE DISKS WAS completely MISSING! Then the VERY LAST DISK there was TWO of them (one on top of the other -BOTH had a defect in playing at same spot on each!)

1145186,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00144PA06,Bobby Underwood,"[57, 58]","Remington Steele was a truly stylish television show that tapped into the kind of Stanley Donen light mystery with romance that was missing from the movies. Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were perfectly cast and the show only got better with each episode. The evocative Henry Mancini theme music captured the sense of mystery and romance perfectly.Laura Holt (Zimbalist) couldn't get her private detective agency off the ground in spite of her skills until she invented the phantom agency head, Remington Steele. Business was booming and everything was going swell until Pierce Brosnan showed up and assumed the identity of the nonexistent Steele! Brosnan's Steele was debonair and stylish, his past a shady mystery ala' ""To Catch a Thief.""Each season Laura discovered new things about his past in Ireland and his exploits in other countries. Steele was a classic film buff and would make constant references to films of the 1930's and 1940's pertaining to the case. It made all us film buffs who knew just what he was talking about feel like we were insiders, and was one of the many charms of this wonderful show.Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura. Season one had one of the best episodes (Vintage Steele) as the tables were turned and Steele got a glimpse at Laura's past!The overall quality of the show improved with season two as Doris Roberts was added to the cast as Mildred Krebs, and two other characters were lost. The show became even more fun than before, and both Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist settled in for good as everyone's favorite TV couple. The show never looked back after season two began.Season three's ""Steele Trying"" was perhaps the most representative episode of what Remington Steele was all about. Steele invents a case as a ruse so the two can whisk off for a romantic San Francisco weekend. It all goes awry, of course, when there turns out to be a very real case which interferes with all Steele's plans. Wonderful music and a romantic backdrop add to the fun as Remington and Laura have fun and a little romance along the way as they solve the mystery.Brosnan and Zimbalist had a wonderful repore and viewers fell in love with Michael Gleason's show from the start. Both leads had a flair for comedy which was mingled with the romance and mystery, making for sophisticated fun. Doris Roberts added mightily to the feel of the show as she adored the ""Boss"" but loved Laura also. Both Brosnan and Zimbalist became creative forces behind the camera over time but it was Michael Gleason who made and kept the show fun and interesting week after week.Few shows hold a soft spot in viewer's hearts like Remington Steele. It was romantic mystery and escapism for an hour each week and classic film fans especially loved this show. One of the best shows ever on television as pure entertainment. A must have for fans.",5,Fun Mystery and Romantic Atmosphere Makes for Great Entertainment,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3178,"['Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'truly', 'stylish', 'television', 'show', 'tapped', 'kind', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'light', 'mystery', 'romance', 'was', 'missing', 'movies', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'show', 'only', 'got', 'better', 'episode', 'evocative', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'theme', 'music', 'captured', 'sense', 'mystery', 'romance', 'perfectly.Laura', 'Holt', 'Zimbalist', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'private', 'detective', 'agency', 'ground', 'spite', 'skills', 'invented', 'phantom', 'agency', 'head', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Business', 'was', 'booming', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'swell', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'showed', 'up', 'assumed', 'identity', 'nonexistent', 'Steele', 'Brosnan', 'Steele', 'was', 'debonair', 'stylish', 'shady', 'mystery', 'ala', 'Catch', 'Thief', 'season', 'Laura', 'discovered', 'new', 'things', 'past', 'Ireland', 'exploits', 'other', 'countries', 'Steele', 'was', 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'would', 'make', 'constant', 'references', 'films', '1930', '1940', 'pertaining', 'case', 'made', 'film', 'buffs', 'who', 'knew', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'feel', 'were', 'insiders', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'charms', 'wonderful', 'show.Brosnan', 'Zimbalist', 'were', 'terrific', 'screen', 'couple', 'tradition', 'ones', 'remember', 'fondly', 'was', 'fun', 'anticipation', 'viewers', 'week', 'week', 'watched', 'two', 'become', 'involved', 'mystery', 'danced', 'growing', 'affection', 'other', 'was', 'always', 'fun', 'little', 'tidbits', 'Steele', 'past', 'were', 'discovered', 'Laura', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'Vintage', 'Steele', 'tables', 'were', 'turned', 'Steele', 'got', 'glimpse', 'Laura', 'past', 'overall', 'quality', 'show', 'improved', 'season', 'two', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'was', 'added', 'cast', 'Mildred', 'Krebs', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'lost', 'show', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'before', 'Brosnan', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'settled', 'good', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'TV', 'couple', 'show', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'began.Season', 'three', 'Steele', 'Trying', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'representative', 'episode', 'what', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'Steele', 'case', 'ruse', 'two', 'can', 'whisk', 'off', 'romantic', 'San', 'Francisco', 'weekend', 'awry', 'course', 'when', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'real', 'case', 'Steele', 'plans', 'Wonderful', 'music', 'romantic', 'backdrop', 'add', 'fun', 'Remington', 'Laura', 'have', 'fun', 'little', 'romance', 'way', 'solve', 'mystery.Brosnan', 'Zimbalist', 'had', 'wonderful', 'repore', 'viewers', 'fell', 'love', 'Michael', 'Gleason', 'show', 'start', 'leads', 'had', 'flair', 'comedy', 'was', 'mingled', 'romance', 'mystery', 'making', 'sophisticated', 'fun', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'added', 'mightily', 'feel', 'show', 'adored', 'Boss', 'loved', 'Laura', 'also', 'Brosnan', 'Zimbalist', 'became', 'creative', 'forces', 'camera', 'time', 'was', 'Michael', 'Gleason', 'who', 'made', 'kept', 'show', 'fun', 'interesting', 'week', 'week.Few', 'shows', 'hold', 'soft', 'spot', 'viewer', 'hearts', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'was', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'escapism', 'hour', 'week', 'classic', 'film', 'fans', 'especially', 'loved', 'show', 'One', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'television', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'must', 'have', 'fans']",Remington Steele - Seasons 1-5

I was a James Bond fan long before I ever discovered RS, and after watching a few fan-cast videos of Pierce Brosnan in the role of Remington Steele, the nameless ex-felon and all-around scoundrel, I decided to look the series up on Hulu. I think I finished all 5 seasons in two weeks--yea, it was THAT good!Stephanie Zimbalist is such a beautiful, talented actress; her character, Laura Holt, runs the Remington Steele Detective Agency. When an unnamed, jewel thief walks into her life and masquerades as the nonexistent Remington Steele, Laura must learn to work alongside a mysterious, dashing man.Pierce Brosnan, in a role BEFORE James Bond, is an absolutely hilarious, carefree, film lover with a knack for getting into trouble whether it is with the cops, suspects, clients, and even with Laura! You can't help but fall in love with Remington the fist moment he steps on screen--and you'll find yourself going crazy as you wait for Laura and Remington to have a quiet scene together, alone, away from flying bullets and murder attempts!Mildred Krebs, played by Doris Roberts, is the constant go-between for Laura and Remington; she is the glue that holds not just the Detective Agency but the TV series as well. This is the best role I've seen her in; if you liked her in Everybody Loves Raymond, you just have to see her in Remington Steele!It doesn't matter who you are, how old you are (I'm 20), or what genera you enjoy, Remington Steele is one of the best shows ever produced.
