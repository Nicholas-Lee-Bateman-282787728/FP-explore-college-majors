Though casting US actors, Hill's and 'Bambino's' performance is non-existant.  That coupled with the absolute poor viewing/film condition, made it all too easy to quit watching within 20 min of start.............",1,One word - LOUSY!,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,329,"['bust', 'actor', 'Hill', 'Co.', 'Every', 'trilogy', '34', 'Name', 'Nobody', '34', 'movie', 'abyss', 'casting', 'US', 'actors', 'Hill', 'performance', 'non-existant', 'coupled', 'absolute', 'poor', 'viewing/film', 'condition', 'made', 'too', 'easy', 'quit', 'watching', '20', 'min', 'start']",Boothill

1396665,A1I0MKOZ67K9Q8,B004D4YE8S,rocketfuel,"[0, 0]","I remember when the Trinity series with Terrance Hill came out in the theaters in the early 70s.  I was in Copenhagen at the time (I assume they were in the theaters in the States) and laughed my ass off.  They weren't perfect, and were, after all, spaghetti westerns, but they were fun to watch.  This one, undoubtedly the first attempt that never made it to the big screen may have the elements that might have made it entertaining, but the camera work, lighting and overall film quality (which would be bad even for a home movie) make it virtually impossible to follow.  Too many close ups in very dim lighting.  Its a shame, too, because it looked like a lot of effort went into the costumes and sets (as much as I was able to see).  The follow up movies are great for anyone who likes spaghetti western movies or even comedy.",1,HARD TO WATCH,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,830,"['remember', 'when', 'Trinity', 'series', 'Terrance', 'Hill', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'early', '70s', 'was', 'Copenhagen', 'time', 'assume', 'were', 'theaters', 'States', 'laughed', 'ass', 'off', 'were', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'were', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'undoubtedly', 'first', 'attempt', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'may', 'have', 'elements', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'entertaining', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'overall', 'film', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'even', 'home', 'movie', 'make', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'follow', 'Too', 'many', 'close', 'ups', 'very', 'dim', 'lighting', 'shame', 'too', 'looked', 'lot', 'effort', 'went', 'costumes', 'sets', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'follow', 'up', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'anyone', 'who', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'movies', 'even', 'comedy']",Boothill
