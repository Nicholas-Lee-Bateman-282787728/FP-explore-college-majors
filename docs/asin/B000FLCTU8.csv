She created the part of Blanche (it was written for her), but, because of the omnipresent film, the performance everyone knows is Vivien Leigh's.  It is excellent, of course, but it's illuminating to see the different take Tandy brings.  Also, there is precious little film of the late great Canadian actor William Hutt, and the chance to see him should be precious to anyone in the theatre.  The excerpts from the plays are not great cinema, but they do offer flashes of undiluted Williams.  And then there's Williams himself, playing host to his own life.  There are all sorts of ways to pick this program apart for what it lacks, but what it offers cannot be replaced or duplicated by anything elsewhere.",5,flawed but valuable,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,809,"['disc', 'worth', 'grabbing', 'only', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'do', 'chunk', 'STREETCAR', 'created', 'part', 'Blanche', 'was', 'written', 'omnipresent', 'film', 'performance', 'everyone', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'excellent', 'course', 'illuminating', 'see', 'different', 'take', 'Tandy', 'brings', 'Also', 'precious', 'little', 'film', 'late', 'great', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'William', 'Hutt', 'chance', 'see', 'should', 'be', 'precious', 'anyone', 'theatre', 'excerpts', 'plays', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'cinema', 'do', 'offer', 'flashes', 'undiluted', 'Williams', 'then', 'Williams', 'playing', 'host', 'own', 'life', 'are', 'sorts', 'ways', 'pick', 'program', 'apart', 'what', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'replaced', 'duplicated', 'anything', 'elsewhere']",N/A
992761,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B000FLCTU8,Char,"[5, 5]","An 80-minute appreciation of Tennessee Williams in the form of an interview juxtaposed with scenes of biographical import from Williams' plays.  This film was produced in 1973 when Williams was 62 years old.  The interviews occur over a one-year period set in New Orleans and Key West.  The viewer also sees outdoor settings and photographs that evoke Williams' childhood in small towns of Mississippi.  There are pictures of his grandparents (described as the ""gentlest"" people he has ever known), his parents, his sister, and numerous photos of Williams as a child and at various ages throughout his life.  There are several interior and exterior views of Williams' actual dwelling places as a writer.  The film focuses most on the ""world"" of Williams' Memory, which is where Williams feels he truly ""lives.""  His memories derive from his life spent in the South.Tennessee comes across as a genial and perhaps unintentionally charming person.  He laughs often.  It's a pleasure to listen to his Southern accent.  He's careful and thoughtful before answering the interviewer's questions.  Most moving for me were his frequent readings from his poetry and plays.  By the time the film was ending, I'd concluded that most of his works and his thought processes were Poetry.Williams is an excellent reader of his works.  His poems are more exquisite than I've ever guessed, having seen only a few movies based on some of his more outstanding plays.It was interesting to hear Williams speak of the origins of Southern idioms.  Also to learn of his penchant for Chekhov and how he felt that Chekhov's own particular Russian ""world"" was very comparable to the world of Williams' world of the American South.  I found that a most unexpected comparison.In a phrase from one of his poems, Williams speaks of himself as telling ""Truth disguised as illusion.""When asked why he thinks so many people identify with his characters and thus with him, he expresses surprise.  He says he can't imagine that many people do identify with his eccentric characters and with a character so eccentric as himself.  The interviewer says that many people may see themselves as inwardly, though not apparently, eccentric.  Williams then experiences an illumination.  He laughs and says that he feels relieved to know that it is alright for him to be eccentric and he says he'll go on being so with greater ease now!There was a lovely guilelessness about Tennessee Williams. He had a sense of humor, and he enjoyed laughing at his own humor!I felt that the characters in the plays and Williams himself were almost all persons who expressed themselves, generally speaking, in a startling, ""naked"" way.  Or, perhaps, another popular adjective from our contemporary usage would be ""transparent.""  So, the frankness and honesty of Williams and the characters who, by his own admission, represent his own inner selves, are salient features of the illusionistic but non-illusory Truth Williams brings to life on the stage.This film is an excellent study of Tennessee Williams as a person and an artist (who happens to reflect the phenomenon of Southern culture at a particular point in its transition).  As an opportunity to listen to Williams read from his works, the film is a moving experience.  There is the added advantage of being able to view scenes featuring some of the 20th century's most outstanding actors.  I place a high value on this study of Williams and his work.",5,Genial views of a Genius.,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,3447,"['80-minute', 'appreciation', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'form', 'interview', 'juxtaposed', 'scenes', 'biographical', 'import', 'Williams', 'plays', 'film', 'was', 'produced', '1973', 'when', 'Williams', 'was', '62', 'years', 'old', 'interviews', 'occur', 'one-year', 'period', 'set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Key', 'West', 'viewer', 'also', 'outdoor', 'settings', 'photographs', 'evoke', 'Williams', 'childhood', 'small', 'towns', 'Mississippi', 'are', 'pictures', 'grandparents', 'described', 'gentlest', 'people', 'ever', 'known', 'parents', 'sister', 'numerous', 'photos', 'Williams', 'child', 'various', 'ages', 'life', 'are', 'several', 'interior', 'exterior', 'views', 'Williams', 'actual', 'dwelling', 'places', 'writer', 'film', 'most', 'world', 'Williams', 'Memory', 'where', 'Williams', 'truly', 'lives', 'memories', 'derive', 'life', 'spent', 'South.Tennessee', 'across', 'genial', 'perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'charming', 'person', 'often', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'Southern', 'accent', 'careful', 'thoughtful', 'answering', 'interviewer', 'questions', 'Most', 'moving', 'were', 'frequent', 'readings', 'poetry', 'plays', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'ending', ""'d"", 'concluded', 'most', 'works', 'thought', 'processes', 'were', 'Poetry.Williams', 'excellent', 'reader', 'works', 'poems', 'are', 'more', 'exquisite', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'guessed', 'having', 'seen', 'only', 'few', 'movies', 'based', 'more', 'outstanding', 'plays.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Williams', 'speak', 'origins', 'Southern', 'idioms', 'Also', 'learn', 'penchant', 'Chekhov', 'how', 'felt', 'Chekhov', 'own', 'particular', 'Russian', 'world', 'was', 'very', 'comparable', 'world', 'Williams', 'world', 'American', 'South', 'found', 'most', 'unexpected', 'comparison.In', 'phrase', 'one', 'poems', 'Williams', 'telling', 'Truth', 'disguised', 'illusion', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'identify', 'characters', 'thus', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'identify', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'character', 'so', 'eccentric', 'interviewer', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'see', 'inwardly', 'not', 'apparently', 'eccentric', 'Williams', 'then', 'illumination', 'relieved', 'know', 'alright', 'be', 'eccentric', ""'ll"", 'go', 'being', 'so', 'greater', 'ease', 'now', 'was', 'lovely', 'guilelessness', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'enjoyed', 'laughing', 'own', 'humor', 'felt', 'characters', 'plays', 'Williams', 'were', 'almost', 'persons', 'who', 'expressed', 'generally', 'speaking', 'startling', 'naked', 'way', 'perhaps', 'popular', 'adjective', 'contemporary', 'usage', 'would', 'be', 'transparent', 'So', 'frankness', 'honesty', 'Williams', 'characters', 'who', 'own', 'admission', 'represent', 'own', 'inner', 'selves', 'are', 'salient', 'features', 'illusionistic', 'non-illusory', 'Truth', 'Williams', 'life', 'stage.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'study', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'person', 'artist', 'who', 'reflect', 'phenomenon', 'Southern', 'culture', 'particular', 'point', 'transition', 'opportunity', 'listen', 'Williams', 'read', 'works', 'film', 'moving', 'experience', 'added', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'view', 'scenes', 'featuring', '20th', 'century', 'most', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'place', 'high', 'value', 'study', 'Williams', 'work']",N/A

It's comprised of candid interviews with Williams talking mostly about how the south influenced his writing.  The interviews take place in New Orleans and Key West, two southern places he called home.In between takes, there are dramatizations of scenes from some of his plays, including The Glass Menagerie, Night of the Iguana, Streetcar Named Desire, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. With really no introductions, other than being the play TW is talking about right before the scene, those not familiar with his work may not know which play each scene is from.  The most notable are Jessica Tandy as Blanche DuBois in Streetcar, and Burl Ives reprising his role as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.What really outshines these skits is TW's reading of poems, mostly his own, and a few monologues from his plays. He appears slightly intoxicated in some parts, and I'm sure he was, but his deep mellow dialect is just soothing to listen to. He does not have that Southern twang, but he easily convinces you that the South runs deep in his blood. He even says the traditional southern dialect evolved from ""Blacks"" and that he has often thought of himself as black.Very few biographical elements are shared, but like I said, what is shared is very candid and from TW himself. The scene where he talks about Laura from Glass Menagerie being based on his sister Rose is treated with hesitancy and almost brings him to tears.  TW also briefly discusses his childhood, his family, and various other topics.Having previously searched YouTube for clips of interviews and such just to get a feel for how he sounded, I found this DVD to be quite wonderful. TW is so humorous and quite the storyteller.

992766,A315WMPERH1S0Z,B000FLCTU8,Tee,"[3, 3]","This is an outstanding 1974 Canadian television documentary on America's greatest playwright, Tennessee Williams which consists of a detailed exclusive interview with Tennessee and excerpts of his work performed by, among others, Burl Ives, Jessica Tandy, Colleen Dewhurst, Maureen Stapleton, Michael York, and James Naughton.  These little dramatic segments were also performed exclusively for this production.  This remarkable film took several years to cross the American border because Tennessee talks frankly, if briefly, about being gay which even PBS was uncomfortable with at the time.  (The excerpt from STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE with Tandy also features the unedited monologue about discovering her beau's homosexuality that was watered down in the film version).It's really wonderful to see and hear Tennessee talk about his work. He seems friendly, lucid, and amusing. I am a huge fan of Tennessee's work and have wanted this DVD for years and finally bought it.
