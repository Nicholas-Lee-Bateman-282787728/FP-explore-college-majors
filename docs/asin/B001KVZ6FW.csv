1209256,A2CKO47KWC90A0,B001KVZ6FW,"10-yr-old Movie Critic ""Perry's Previews""","[1, 1]","The following review was published on La Jolla Light, Del Mar Times, Rancho Santa Fe Record, Carmel Valley Leader, Solana Beach Sun, and We Chinese in America newspapers, and my website [...]---------------Have you ever wondered how many balloons it takes to lift a real house?  Over 20 million!  Carl Fredrickson, a widowed 78-year-old curmudgeon and main hero in the uplifting Pixar 3-D movie ""Up"", has the curiosity and courage to try it!While heading toward his dream home in his floating house to the remote ""Paradise Falls"", the lost world in South America that he and his deceased wife Ellie always wanted to go, Carl finds an unwitting stowaway on his front porch: a chubby 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell.Together, Carl and Russell explored the forest with their newly-discovered exotic friend that Russell named ""Kevin.""  Soon, they discovered that the faded hero and nature explorer Charles Muntz has been chasing Kevin for over 50 years at Paradise Falls.  To save Kevin, Carl and Russell must go through an unimaginable adventure that changes their lives forever.When I asked Pete Docter, the tall and ""animated"" director, why he chose balloons to float the house instead of seagulls (or other flying devices), he responded, ""There is something very magical and poetic about the balloon for me as a child.  When I let go of it, I'm not getting it back.  It is a bit like Carl's relationship with his wife Ellie."" Jonas Rivera, ""Up"" producer added, ""And balloons are much more colorful than seagulls too!""My favorite character is Russell because I always want to be an explorer myself.  I love exploring the Torrey Pines State Reserve and Carmel Creek which inspire me to write poems.I love the dazzling actions, amazing visual effects, and the beautiful music.  ""Up"" is about escape, friendship, and connections.  My favorite scene is the last scene.  After their long and arduous quest to explore nature's wonders, Carl and Russell each found someone to love.UP (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy)",5,Up is a Beautiful Escape - DVD review & director Pete Docter interview,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,2029,"['following', 'review', 'was', 'published', 'La', 'Jolla', 'Light', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Times', 'Rancho', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Record', 'Carmel', 'Valley', 'Leader', 'Solana', 'Beach', 'Sun', 'Chinese', 'America', 'newspapers', 'website', '[', ']', '-Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'many', 'balloons', 'lift', 'real', 'house', '20', 'million', 'Carl', 'Fredrickson', 'widowed', '78-year-old', 'curmudgeon', 'main', 'hero', 'uplifting', 'Pixar', '3-D', 'movie', 'Up', 'curiosity', 'courage', 'try', 'heading', 'dream', 'home', 'floating', 'house', 'remote', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'lost', 'world', 'South', 'America', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'Carl', 'unwitting', 'stowaway', 'front', 'porch', 'chubby', '8-year-old', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'named', 'Russell.Together', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'explored', 'forest', 'newly-discovered', 'exotic', 'friend', 'Russell', 'named', 'Kevin', 'Soon', 'discovered', 'faded', 'hero', 'nature', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'been', 'chasing', 'Kevin', '50', 'years', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'save', 'Kevin', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'must', 'go', 'unimaginable', 'adventure', 'lives', 'forever.When', 'asked', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'tall', 'animated', 'director', 'why', 'chose', 'balloons', 'float', 'house', 'instead', 'seagulls', 'other', 'flying', 'devices', 'responded', 'something', 'very', 'magical', 'poetic', 'balloon', 'child', 'When', 'let', 'go', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'back', 'bit', 'Carl', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'Jonas', 'Rivera', 'producer', 'added', 'balloons', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'colorful', 'seagulls', 'too', 'favorite', 'character', 'Russell', 'always', 'want', 'be', 'explorer', 'love', 'exploring', 'Torrey', 'Pines', 'State', 'Reserve', 'Carmel', 'Creek', 'inspire', 'write', 'poems.I', 'love', 'dazzling', 'actions', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'beautiful', 'music', 'escape', 'friendship', 'connections', 'favorite', 'scene', 'last', 'scene', 'long', 'arduous', 'quest', 'explore', 'nature', 'wonders', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'found', 'someone', 'love.UP', 'Two-Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy']",N/A
1209257,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001KVZ6FW,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 6]","`Up' is another Pixar gem.  Able to transport the minds of young and old and enhance its story with sympathy and charm, the movie is understandably touted as one of the year's best.Since the beginning of their marriage, Carl Frederickson (Edward Asner) and his wife Ellie (Elie Docter) have yearned to move to Paradise Falls in South America.  Smitten by his childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl and Ellie scrimp and save, but contingencies force them to open their savings jar until one day Ellie passes away, and Carl is forced to live alone with his dream broken and nothing but his memories intact.Around his house construction workers are building new city buildings, and a job foreman coaxes Carl to sell his house.  One day Carl confronts a worker who damages his mailbox, and the ordeal sets Carl up to be placed in a nursing home.  Carl then meets a young boy scout who wishes to earn his final merit badge, assisting an elderly person.  The boy gets more than he bargained for as Carl desperately tries to regain his footing and elude those who would change his life forever.Colorful and cute, Carl's journey and the characters he encounters are enough to enthrall, but the story is even more transporting.  The peril is enough to keep even teenagers interested, yet keep their sympathies for the elderly intact.  The way the animated scenes unfold is the most engrossing aspect of yet another successful Pixar project.",5,'Up' Goes Just There for Another 'Pixar' Gem,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1459,"['Up', 'Pixar', 'gem', 'Able', 'transport', 'minds', 'young', 'old', 'enhance', 'story', 'sympathy', 'charm', 'movie', 'understandably', 'touted', 'one', 'year', 'best.Since', 'beginning', 'marriage', 'Carl', 'Frederickson', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'Elie', 'Docter', 'have', 'yearned', 'move', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'South', 'America', 'Smitten', 'childhood', 'hero', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'scrimp', 'save', 'contingencies', 'force', 'open', 'savings', 'jar', 'one', 'day', 'Ellie', 'away', 'Carl', 'forced', 'live', 'alone', 'dream', 'broken', 'nothing', 'memories', 'house', 'construction', 'workers', 'are', 'building', 'new', 'city', 'buildings', 'job', 'foreman', 'coaxes', 'Carl', 'sell', 'house', 'One', 'day', 'Carl', 'worker', 'who', 'damages', 'mailbox', 'ordeal', 'sets', 'Carl', 'up', 'be', 'placed', 'nursing', 'home', 'Carl', 'then', 'young', 'boy', 'scout', 'who', 'earn', 'final', 'merit', 'badge', 'assisting', 'elderly', 'person', 'boy', 'more', 'bargained', 'Carl', 'desperately', 'regain', 'footing', 'elude', 'who', 'would', 'change', 'life', 'forever.Colorful', 'cute', 'Carl', 'journey', 'characters', 'are', 'enough', 'enthrall', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'transporting', 'peril', 'enough', 'keep', 'even', 'teenagers', 'interested', 'yet', 'keep', 'sympathies', 'elderly', 'intact', 'way', 'animated', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'most', 'engrossing', 'aspect', 'yet', 'successful', 'Pixar', 'project']",N/A

It begins with a lyrical and deeply touching portrayal of a life-long love affair of two people who meet and fall in love as kids -- and then marry and grow old together. This section, which lasts just a few minutes, is worth the price of admission alone. I can't think of another movie, animated or not, which paints such a lovely pictures of a marriage with all its joys and sorrows.The other point that makes this movie stand apart is that the hero is a grumpy old man, beautifully voiced by Ed Asner. Again, it's wonderful to see a movie with a protagonist in his ""golden years.""Apart from that, we have the usual cartoon fare -- a quest, a pair or heroes, some adorable sidekicks, a nasty villain. It's all very well done and amusing and often pretty to look at.

1209276,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001KVZ6FW,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Up / B001KVZ6G6I wasn't sure I'd enjoy ""Up"" - the previews all seemed like a stereotypically Grumpy Old Man who comes to appreciate the life that he turned his back on through the Power of Friendship, or something equally wholesome and two-dimensional.Of course, this is a good example of how previews just aren't everything. Our grumpy old man has a name, Carl, and it turns out he's not so grumpy after all - but he has suffered a terrible and heart-wrenching loss. Pixar is to be congratulated for managing, again, to really flesh out a character in scenes that involve little-to-no actual dialogue, and in such a surprisingly short time - after the first 15 minutes of the film, I can almost guarantee you will care more about Carl than you have for the protagonists of the last dozen films you've watched. (OK, mileage will vary there, but seriously, Pixar does a wonderfully direct and succinct job of making you care for Carl as a person.)There's so much to like about ""Up"". There's such a strong theme here of journeying to capture what you ""lost"", even if what you're trying to capture is something you never actually had. His tag-along friend, Russell, is also searching for something he has lost-yet-never-had, as he hopes that by finishing his merit badges, he might somehow regain the love that he remembers having from his father. If that doesn't break your heart, then nothing will. And the comic relief, Dug the Dog, is actually funny and heart-warming as well.To my surprise, I really, really enjoyed ""Up"".

I had the pleasure of taking my oldest daughter to see this (her first time seeing a movie in the theater), and seeing her facial expressions was priceless. This adorable story is one of the funniest Pixar films I've seen, about an old man who just lost his adventurous wife (in what, I may add, is one of the saddest Pixar montage scenes ever made). In order to fulfill his promise to her, and avoid submission to an ""old folks home,"" Carl Fredricksen uses about a thousand or so balloons and takes off for South America where he will retire to live out the rest of his days at Paradise Falls -- the place his wife so desperately wanted to go before her death. Along the way, though, he is joined by Cub Scout Russell, the very depiction of youth that Carl both envies and at times despises. Along the way they befriend a rare bird, come across ""talking"" dogs and run into their nemesis --  Carl's childhood hero, Charles Muntz -- who's been trying to kidnap the bird and hence thwart their mission.As usual, Pixar throws in so many slight ""Easter Eggs"" story lines that it would take more than just one viewing to pick up on all of them. One example of an ""Easter egg"" storyline plot is the fact that when Carl and Russell first meet, Russell, reading from his Cub Scout guide, asks Carl if he can help him cross the street, cross his lawn, cross anything -- anything so he can get his final badge of helping an senior citizen. Of course, most viewers will/should pick up that Russell helps Carl do another sort of ""crossing"" by near movie's end. It's a theme that's central to Carl's character and storyline: crossing his heart. Keeping that promise that's so important to those closest to us in life. And what results is one of the sweetest, most touching endings to a Pixar movie. Of course, this comes from a guy who teared up when first watching the ending ofMonsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), when Sully pops that final splinter into the door, steps through and hears Boo's voice, ""Kitty!"" Oh. &lt;sniff> Oh, man. &lt;sniff, sniff>Now that I'm a father, those emotions and little cute moments in most of Pixar's movies appeals to me, and touches me, much more than it did before parenthood (although it was still good back then too).

1209286,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001KVZ6FW,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Pixar has a pretty good track record if you ask me.  Of their releases there is only one that I cannot stand (`Cars') but there are quite a few I consider absolutely wonderful (`Ratatouille', `The Incredibles') and one that I consider a near masterpiece (`Finding Nemo').  In my personal opinion, `Up' is the best thing they have ever done.  It is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece in animated filmmaking.Seriously.The plot is pretty simple on the outset.  Carl Fredricksen (who looks an awful lot like Spencer Tracy) is a crotchety old widower who is holding onto the only memory he has of his departed wife; their home and a dream of adventure.  When circumstances shift, paving the way for Carl to be court ordered to a nursing home, he decides to try his hand at adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his roof and going up, up, up and away.  With a young stowaway named Russell, an overweight boy-scout of sorts, Carl sets off in hot pursuit of Paradise Falls, the land he and his beloved wife always dreamed of exploring.Let's get one thing straight; this is a story about a floating house, so don't expect it to be realistic.  To those who pick apart plot holes such as ""where was Russell's mother this whole time"" and the like, sure it isn't realistic, but are you really expecting it to be?One thing I will agree on is that this is a very sad and dramatic film that may not be suitable for all children.  I do feel that it may be good for children who face similar situations as Russell to see their home life displayed in a sweetly appealing setting like the one presented in this animated film, but I do also feel that some subjects discussed may be too deep or even unsettling at times for young ones.  It was choking me up.  Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to themes such as the inability to have children (or it possibly could have been a miscarriage) and the death of a spouse.  Themes such as single parent families and neglect come into play as well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.The film will make you smile and laugh, but it will make you cry A LOT.With that solitary caution (it does tend to get very violent towards the end as well, and with attacks made on a child I find that it may be a concern to a parent) I have to say that this is a very, very, very good movie; great even.  No, better than great; it is a MASTERPIECE.  The animation is stellar, the concept is original and engaging, the humor is strong and the gags are all on point, fresh and welcome.  For me, it was nice to see such strong emotional themes explored in this context.  It adds a different layer to the general consensus of dramatic entertainment.  Sure, this is no where near as gritty or as overwhelming as `Grave of the Fireflies', but `Up' allows the humor to play a perfect balance to the mature point of view this film is taking.There are very few animated films that can handle both sides of the spectrum with such grace and eloquence.",5,"Two thumps up, up, up, up, up!",1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,2991,"['Pixar', 'pretty', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'ask', 'releases', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Cars', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'consider', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Ratatouille', 'Incredibles', 'one', 'consider', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'personal', 'opinion', 'best', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'quite', 'frankly', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'animated', 'filmmaking.Seriously.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'outset', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'who', 'awful', 'lot', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'crotchety', 'old', 'widower', 'who', 'holding', 'only', 'memory', 'departed', 'wife', 'home', 'dream', 'adventure', 'When', 'circumstances', 'shift', 'paving', 'way', 'Carl', 'be', 'court', 'ordered', 'nursing', 'home', 'try', 'hand', 'adventure', 'tying', 'thousands', 'balloons', 'roof', 'going', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'away', 'young', 'stowaway', 'named', 'Russell', 'overweight', 'boy-scout', 'sorts', 'Carl', 'off', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'land', 'beloved', 'wife', 'always', 'dreamed', 'exploring.Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'story', 'floating', 'house', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'realistic', 'who', 'pick', 'apart', 'plot', 'holes', 'such', 'where', 'was', 'Russell', 'mother', 'whole', 'time', 'like', 'sure', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'are', 'really', 'expecting', 'be', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'agree', 'very', 'sad', 'dramatic', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'children', 'do', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'children', 'who', 'face', 'similar', 'situations', 'Russell', 'see', 'home', 'life', 'displayed', 'sweetly', 'appealing', 'setting', 'one', 'presented', 'animated', 'film', 'do', 'also', 'feel', 'subjects', 'discussed', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'even', 'unsettling', 'times', 'young', 'ones', 'was', 'choking', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'introduced', 'themes', 'such', 'inability', 'have', 'children', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'miscarriage', 'death', 'spouse', 'Themes', 'such', 'single', 'parent', 'families', 'neglect', 'come', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'sweet', 'also', 'laced', 'sadness.The', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'laugh', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'LOT.With', 'solitary', 'caution', 'tend', 'get', 'very', 'violent', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'attacks', 'made', 'child', 'find', 'may', 'be', 'concern', 'parent', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'even', 'No', 'better', 'great', 'MASTERPIECE', 'animation', 'stellar', 'concept', 'original', 'engaging', 'humor', 'strong', 'gags', 'are', 'point', 'fresh', 'welcome', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'strong', 'emotional', 'themes', 'explored', 'context', 'different', 'layer', 'general', 'consensus', 'dramatic', 'entertainment', 'Sure', 'where', 'near', 'gritty', 'as', 'overwhelming', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'humor', 'play', 'perfect', 'balance', 'mature', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'animated', 'films', 'can', 'handle', 'sides', 'spectrum', 'such', 'grace', 'eloquence']",N/A

The kid-film industry churns out film after film, each as dry and unoriginal as thelast.  While there are some worth mentioning, these are few and far between.And then something made me feel incredibly comfortable.  It was that familiar lamp, which hopped across the screen and squashed the 'i' in Pixar.  When I saw that, I knew I was in good hands.Pixar's 'Up' is one, if not the, best animated film in recent past.  It tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, who, as a young boy, dreamed of adventure, inspired by his idol Charles Muntz.  When he meets a girl who shares his affinity for adventure, they become friends.'Up' wastes no time in pulling the audience into the film on an emotional level.  A wordless yet brilliant montage near the beginning of the film tells the story of the two ""adventurers"" from childhood to adulthood and beyond.  By the time these masterful five minutes are over, we all feel a connection with Carl on a very deep level.The writing is excellent, with very smart comedy throughout.  the characters are lovable and the animation is, as always, superb.So, in this day and age of throwing ten bucks at some guys who don't care about the quality of movie you and your kids are watching, 'Up' is a funny, fresh, and wonderful reprieve.

1209304,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001KVZ6FW,Armando N. Roman,"[8, 9]","Like a lot of people, I was skeptical when I first heard about the story for Up. An old guy taking his house to South America, via balloons, because his wife wanted to go there before she died? It didn't sound dumb by any means, just kinda weird. Then I realized how weird the stories for WALL-E, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille and a few others sounded, and I knew I'd be seeing it no matter what. I may not like everything Pixar's done, but they have a good track record, and just like with WALL-E, they knocked another one outta the park with Up. If you ask me, I think this movie has the most heart of all Pixar's films, and that's pretty hard to do given the amount of heart that most of them have.Up is the story of Carl Fredricksen, a balloon salesman who lives alone in an old fashioned house now in the middle of a construction site. He runs into a little trouble one day when he's encouraged to sell his house, and takes off with thousands of balloons tied to it. He wants to go to Paradise Falls, a beautiful location in South America that he and his now deceased wife were going to go, but things keep preventing them from taking the trip when they were younger. Everything seems to be going to plan at first, but Carl soon discovers that he's not alone. Russell, a boyscout, was on the porch when the house took off, and is now along for the ride. The two make it to South America, and try to make it to Paradise Falls, but discover a rare bird, 'talking' dogs, and someone that Carl used to admire when he was younger. What's in store for these guys is the definition of adventure.Personally, eventhough kids obviously loved this film, I think Up is a little more for adults than children, kind of like how The Incredibles was. The theme of an old man trying to fulfill a promise made to his dead wife is pretty emotional, and seeing the couple grow old in a montage is sure to tug at anyone's heart strings. The cast of characters here is great, and since the cast is fairly small, everyone gets their share of time. Russell and Dug steal every scene they're in, and the humor is typical Pixar, with a lot of little jokes that anyone can enjoy. Having a boyscout out in the middle of a South American jungle is pretty hilarious on its own when you think about it. I can honestly say that this is one of the few movies in the last couple of years that I enjoyed every minute of. I was never bored, and didn't want the movie to end. The final scene did bring a tear to my eye, not because I found it sad, but because of how beautiful it was. Up deserved every bit of that Best Picture award nomination it got, and it's a shame that it didn't win it.Simply put, the picture and audio quality for the blu-ray are perfect. There's NOTHING bad I can say about either, though it might've been even better if there were a 7.1 track in addition to the 5.1 DTS-HD Master. Either way, if you're looking for an animated movie, or any movie at all, to show off your home theater system, Up is sure to impress.And just like the audio/visual quality, the extras are great too. First you get the dvd and digital copy, and both are good to have since you can have one in the car and the other on your computer or portable media player, then keep the blu-ray for home. Disc one, the blu-ray disc, has a good number of extras. Partly Cloudy is the short that played before the movie in theaters, and Dug's Special Mission is a brand new short where we get to see what Dug was doing before Carl and Russell meet him. There are also two featurettes about the animators going to South America for ideas for the scenery, and one involving the movie's antagonist and a kind of alternate ending with them. There's also an extensive commentary track that'll cover everything not given its own feature on either disc. Very informative, and I liked that they'd point out extra jokes that you might've missed. Disc 2 has even more, with featurettes for the four main characters (Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin), an extended montage scene of Carl and Ellie when they were younger and growing up (get ready to cry during this one), and more extras covering music, promos, trailers and much more. Basically, the only possible thing missing from this set is the 3D version of the movie, which I'm sure will come out on its own when 3D tvs start to sell better.If you like Pixar, you'll get Up regardless of the reviews. It's definitely a worthy follow-up to WALL-E, which is to me, Pixar's best movie to date. This is definitely one for the whole family, or anyone who just wants to watch a great movie with an excellent story and memorable characters. For the movie itself, or the blu-ray, there's nothing bad I can say at all. This is one of those rare perfect sets.",5,"I have just met you, and I love you.",1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,4743,"['lot', 'people', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'story', 'Up', 'old', 'guy', 'taking', 'house', 'South', 'America', 'balloons', 'wife', 'wanted', 'go', 'there', 'died', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'dumb', 'means', 'just', 'kinda', 'weird', 'Then', 'realized', 'how', 'weird', 'stories', 'WALL-E', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Ratatouille', 'few', 'others', 'sounded', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'seeing', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'everything', 'Pixar', 'done', 'have', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'just', 'WALL-E', 'knocked', 'one', 'outta', 'park', 'Up', 'ask', 'think', 'movie', 'most', 'heart', 'Pixar', 'films', 'pretty', 'hard', 'do', 'given', 'amount', 'heart', 'most', 'have.Up', 'story', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'balloon', 'salesman', 'who', 'alone', 'old', 'fashioned', 'house', 'now', 'middle', 'construction', 'site', 'little', 'trouble', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'encouraged', 'sell', 'house', 'off', 'thousands', 'balloons', 'tied', 'go', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'beautiful', 'location', 'South', 'America', 'now', 'deceased', 'wife', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'things', 'keep', 'preventing', 'taking', 'trip', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'Everything', 'be', 'going', 'plan', 'first', 'Carl', 'soon', 'not', 'alone', 'Russell', 'boyscout', 'was', 'porch', 'when', 'house', 'took', 'off', 'now', 'along', 'ride', 'two', 'make', 'South', 'America', 'try', 'make', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'rare', 'bird', ""'talking"", 'dogs', 'someone', 'Carl', 'used', 'admire', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'What', 'store', 'guys', 'definition', 'adventure.Personally', 'eventhough', 'kids', 'obviously', 'loved', 'film', 'think', 'Up', 'little', 'more', 'adults', 'children', 'kind', 'how', 'Incredibles', 'was', 'theme', 'old', 'man', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'made', 'dead', 'wife', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'seeing', 'couple', 'grow', 'old', 'montage', 'sure', 'tug', 'anyone', 'heart', 'strings', 'cast', 'characters', 'here', 'great', 'cast', 'fairly', 'small', 'everyone', 'share', 'time', 'Russell', 'Dug', 'steal', 'scene', ""'re"", 'humor', 'typical', 'Pixar', 'lot', 'little', 'jokes', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Having', 'boyscout', 'out', 'middle', 'South', 'American', 'jungle', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'own', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'end', 'final', 'scene', 'did', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'not', 'found', 'sad', 'how', 'beautiful', 'was', 'Up', 'deserved', 'bit', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'got', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'it.Simply', 'put', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'perfect', 'NOTHING', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'better', 'were', '7.1', 'track', 'addition', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'way', ""'re"", 'looking', 'animated', 'movie', 'movie', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'Up', 'sure', 'impress.And', 'just', 'audio/visual', 'quality', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'First', 'get', 'dvd', 'digital', 'copy', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'can', 'have', 'one', 'car', 'other', 'computer', 'portable', 'media', 'player', 'then', 'keep', 'blu-ray', 'home', 'Disc', 'one', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'good', 'number', 'extras', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'short', 'played', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Dug', 'Special', 'Mission', 'brand', 'new', 'short', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Dug', 'was', 'doing', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'meet', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'featurettes', 'animators', 'going', 'South', 'America', 'ideas', 'scenery', 'one', 'involving', 'movie', 'antagonist', 'kind', 'alternate', 'ending', 'also', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'track', ""'ll"", 'cover', 'everything', 'not', 'given', 'own', 'feature', 'disc', 'Very', 'informative', 'liked', ""'d"", 'point', 'out', 'extra', 'jokes', 'might', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Disc', '2', 'even', 'more', 'featurettes', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'Dug', 'Kevin', 'extended', 'montage', 'scene', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'growing', 'up', 'get', 'ready', 'cry', 'one', 'more', 'extras', 'covering', 'music', 'promos', 'trailers', 'much', 'more', 'Basically', 'only', 'possible', 'thing', 'missing', 'set', '3D', 'version', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'own', 'when', '3D', 'tvs', 'start', 'sell', 'better.If', 'Pixar', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Up', 'regardless', 'reviews', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'WALL-E', 'Pixar', 'best', 'movie', 'date', 'definitely', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', 'excellent', 'story', 'memorable', 'characters', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'rare', 'perfect', 'sets']",N/A

This takes the step of ripping the original DVD to back up my copy for personal use out of the equation, and I don't have to feel like I'm doing something illegal. (Backing up something you have paid for, and want to last, is only prudent) This review is twofold, in that I personally really enjoyed this film. Also I want to commend Amazon for resolving an issue, literally within a minute of my complaint. First: This film is both going to tug at your heart strings, as the depth of the film reaches into the universal inevitability that we all are going to die. That we all love someone who is going to pass, and that it is a painful process. It will bring tears to your eyes. At the same time, the promise of new, different, and rewarding relationships are possible throughout life, and that all we need do, is be open to them. What a wonderful, funny, entertaining, and fulfilling story. It's colorful animation will entertain the kids, and the underlying 'grown-up' content is there for Mom and Dad. You will not be disappointed. As for the second part of my review, this deals with the professional side of Amazon, and why this company continues to be the success that it is. I ordered this film as a gift for my wife, for Valentines day. I was remiss, and found I was looking for a gift way late in the process. However! Amazon, offering Saturday, (Next day in my case) delivery would get the gift to my home, with one day to spare. This service was of course at a premium. I'm a Prime Member, and feel the service is well worth it. So I paid the $6.99 to get the item here by Saturday. As you may have surmised already, it did not make it on time. I was disappointed with Amazon, who has served me so well, for better then 12 years. The package arrived, Tuesday the 16th. With Monday being a holiday, I could understand that it did not get here then. But it was still later then promised. I found the contact by email button within the 'My Order's' portion of my account, and sent an email to Amazon, explaining my situation. I kid you not, within One Minute, they sent an email back to me, indicating that I would be receiving a refund of the $6.99 I paid, back to my MasterCard. That's customer service. Thanks Amazon.

Hey I guess that makes me a big kid for watching it, lol.It's about an old man who takes a special journey to South America to visit a place he and his wife talked about visiting while the wife was alive.  Well after the wife finally dies, the old man decides to take the journey himself by actually lifting his house off the ground by way of thousands of floating balloons.It's funny because throughout the film, a crucial element to the storytelling is the old man constantly dragging his floating house around everywhere he goes, lol.  To join him on the adventure is a young boy scout looking for a badge that's awarded for helping the elderly.Is it just me or does the old man look almost identical to Joe Paterno, Penn State's football coach?  It's almost too hard to believe it's just a coincidence.  Back when I was watching previews of this film from the TV commercials last year, I could have sworn Disney actually designed the old man to look like Joe.  Maybe not...I don't know about anybody else, but the beginning segment involving the old man as a child and introducing himself to the woman who would turn out to be his wife is REALLY emotional and downright devastatingly sad.  I was seriously sitting there crying as the film quickly went through the motions of the man and woman starting out as children, then growing up and getting married, fixing up their house, not being able to have a baby, growing old, and eventually leading to the wife departing.  Maybe it's just me but the amount of sadness in this particular segment is really unbelievable.Upon landing in South America, the old man and the boy scout meet up with some animals and have the adventure of a lifetime.Up is a really good animated film for anyone looking to spend a little entertainment with their family.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned when watching the first 10 minutes- make sure you have some tissues available, lol.  Really effectively well done bit of storytelling there.  Incredibly touching on so many levels.  The film never goes in *that* direction ever again.

Let's review.The Movie: The previews for this movie didn't grab my attention right away like the ones for Monsters Vs Aliens, Ice Age 3, and other awesome summer movies. But when everyone kept saying how great this movie was, I was pulled into the hype and rented it. I originally thought this movie would be another dissapointment just like the last two Disney movies I saw (Bolt (SUCKED!) and Walle (Okay)), but surprisingly, it wasn't. This movie had it's moments, and like everyone said, the animation was amazing (even if they still can't make humans as good as Dreamworks). This movie entertained me, but not as much as the two awesome movies I mentioned before that I saw this summer. It had a fairly good plot, and it did make me tear up a little bit. It was a good movie, but not as good as say Cars, Ratatouille, or Monsters Inc. Those are Pixar classics, this is just a good movie. I'd give the movie a 7.5, maybe an 8, out of ten. It's definately worth seeing once.The Dvd: OMG. The DVD starts out with an ad from Pixar. Not just a movie preview or an ad for other movies, but an actual ad! It's just some bs from a bunch of Pixar workers saying how you should get the two disc dvd, the toys, games and books based on this movie, and a bunch of other crap. They're basically saying ""You won't have fun with this dvd, go out and spend more money on the two disc dvd just so you can actually have some bonus features). Nice job Pixar (sarcasm). Speaking of which, this dvd has NOTHING! It doesn't just have no bonus features it had no menu what so ever. I couldn't believe it when the dvd went from previews to the movie in two seconds with no warning what so ever. There's no menu, which means if you need captions, a different language, or you need to go straight to a scene, you're basically screwed if you buy this dvd! No menu?! Come on Pixar, or were you two busy making sellout commercials to make a menu?!Overall: The movie was good, but do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this crappy, no menu dvd! It's crappy, and it's only worth the rental price of $4, maybe not even that! Pixar, do you really think you can make people buy your two disc dvds just so they can get a basic menu?! Not cool!Movie: 7.5/10Dvd: 0/10 (stay away from it!

1209327,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B001KVZ6FW,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","Everything about the latest Pixar release, Up, sounds like it shouldn't work.  The main character is a curmudgeonly senior citizen (voiced perfectly by Ed Asner), the villian is an even older crank (voiced by Christopher Plummer) with an army of talking dogs at his beck and call and the movie begins where many stories would end:  at what appears to be the conclusion to a rich and fulfilling life enjoyed by the now bitter and lonely main character.The grumpy old man in question is Carl and as the movie begins, we are treated to a brief but brilliantly crafted prologue that shows us how he met and married his childhood sweetheart Ellie.  In a much talked about 4 minute passage of the film that contains no dialogue, we watch their life together from their wedding day to Ellie's death.  It is a beautiful segment that speaks volumes about the joys and disappointments of life without a single word being spoken.Flash forward to the present, where Carl has become an angry shut-in desperately clinging to his home and the memories of his past life with Ellie. With developers pressuring him to sell his home, and facing the prospcet of being carted off to a retirement community, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his beloved home and float away to Paradise Falls, an exotic locale that he and his late wife always dreamed of visiting but never quite got around to.Ok, so the whole floating house thing requires the willing suspension of disbelief, but that's really not a problem since as soon as Carl is airborne, we are swept up in the story which, as it turns out, is fairly conventional. Carl is unknowingly accompanied by Russell, a jovial wilderness scout who is attempting to earn his ""assisting the elderly"" merit badge.  When the two arrive at Paradise Falls, they are joined by Doug, a talking dog who has rebelled from his pack, and Kevin, a rare and exotic bird that is being hunted by the movie's villian.Again, the plot is fairly conventional.  Carl finds himself becoming very close with Russell and he learns that life is always full of new beginnings.  He also has to foil the plans of the would be bird hunter and his canine minions.  Nothing that happens in Up (aside from dogs flying fighter planes) will come as much of a shock to anyone.  What will stay with you, however, is the generosity of spirit and adventure the film offers and the surprisingly powerful emotions that it stirs up by merely showing us that life doesn't have to end when the people we love are lost.  That's a bold statement for any film to make, let alone a cartoon about a man and his floating house.",4,Another winner from Pixar,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,2614,"['Everything', 'latest', 'Pixar', 'release', 'Up', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'main', 'character', 'curmudgeonly', 'senior', 'citizen', 'voiced', 'perfectly', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'villian', 'even', 'older', 'crank', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'army', 'talking', 'dogs', 'beck', 'call', 'movie', 'where', 'many', 'stories', 'would', 'end', 'what', 'be', 'conclusion', 'rich', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'now', 'bitter', 'lonely', 'main', 'character.The', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'question', 'Carl', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'brief', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'prologue', 'how', 'met', 'married', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Ellie', 'much', 'talked', '4', 'minute', 'passage', 'film', 'dialogue', 'watch', 'life', 'together', 'wedding', 'day', 'Ellie', 'death', 'beautiful', 'segment', 'volumes', 'joys', 'disappointments', 'life', 'single', 'word', 'being', 'spoken.Flash', 'forward', 'present', 'where', 'Carl', 'become', 'angry', 'shut-in', 'desperately', 'clinging', 'home', 'memories', 'past', 'life', 'Ellie', 'developers', 'pressuring', 'sell', 'home', 'facing', 'prospcet', 'being', 'carted', 'off', 'retirement', 'community', 'Carl', 'tie', 'thousands', 'balloons', 'beloved', 'home', 'float', 'away', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'exotic', 'locale', 'late', 'wife', 'always', 'dreamed', 'visiting', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'to.Ok', 'whole', 'floating', 'house', 'thing', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'really', 'not', 'problem', 'as', 'soon', 'Carl', 'airborne', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'story', 'out', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'Carl', 'unknowingly', 'accompanied', 'Russell', 'jovial', 'wilderness', 'scout', 'who', 'attempting', 'earn', 'assisting', 'elderly', 'merit', 'badge', 'When', 'two', 'arrive', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'are', 'joined', 'Doug', 'talking', 'dog', 'who', 'rebelled', 'pack', 'Kevin', 'rare', 'exotic', 'bird', 'being', 'hunted', 'movie', 'villian.Again', 'plot', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'Carl', 'becoming', 'very', 'close', 'Russell', 'life', 'always', 'full', 'new', 'beginnings', 'also', 'foil', 'plans', 'would', 'be', 'bird', 'hunter', 'canine', 'minions', 'Nothing', 'Up', 'aside', 'dogs', 'flying', 'fighter', 'planes', 'will', 'come', 'much', 'shock', 'anyone', 'What', 'will', 'stay', 'however', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'film', 'offers', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'up', 'merely', 'showing', 'life', ""n't"", 'have', 'end', 'when', 'people', 'love', 'are', 'lost', 'bold', 'statement', 'film', 'make', 'let', 'alone', 'cartoon', 'man', 'floating', 'house']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","Many people disagree with me about this, but I'm sticking to my guns because of the level of enjoyment I received from these films. The disagreement is thatWall-Ewas some sort of exceptional film andThe Incredibleswas only so-so. I had the exact opposite experience. I found Wall-E to be so-so and The Incredibles to be a wonderful film because of the human element attached to it. Also, both The Incredibles and this film, UP, had a PG rating and not a G, which might mean that deeper, perhaps disturbing things, made this film carry more emotional weight. And it most certainly does.Edward Asner plays Carl Fredricksen, a man who's loved and lost. Yes, we ACTUALLY get to see an old person pass away at the end of their life ...in an animated feature. Imagine that. Reality. This gives Up more bite and we empathize with Carl on a very basic human level. Whereas with Wall-E, we're trying to gain empathy for a machine that's acting like a human. Not the same thing.Into Carl's lonely life comes wannabe boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's trying to earn a merit badge. But Carl wants none of his help, nor does he want to help Russell gain the badge.Amidst Carl's life is his understanding that his now dead wife Ellie never got to have any adventures. She married Carl and bought a home, which took over their lives and made them home-bodies. They both grew up worshipping adventurer Charles Muntz and wanting to go and find out what happened to him. But Ellie never made it. So, when Carl's house is being threatened by developers and his life steered toward Shady Oaks retirement facility, Carl attaches a mass of helium balloons to his house and floats away. Trouble is, that pesky boy scout is on-board, too.Eventually they make their way to South America and discover dangers, foes, friends, and, yes, adventure. Talking dogs with an obsession for squirrels add a high amount of hilarity to several scenes, as does a unique bird that befriends Russell and loves chocolate.More telling is the friendship that blossoms between Russell and Carl as the generation gap closes, and Carl learns to open his heart (and mind) to new experiences. Also learning to let go of Ellie's memory adds an incredibly deep plot-line to an amazing story.The animation, like most 3-D style animations, is impressive. The colors, shadows, and depth made the scenes come alive. But it's the story that makes it all worthwhile. Just like The Incredibles, this is a tale about human beings doing unique things but with regular challenges and mental hurdles. It is this that drives me to see complex animated films, not a robot .",5,The Human Element Makes Animation Watchable...,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2615,"['Many', 'people', 'disagree', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'guns', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'received', 'films', 'disagreement', 'thatWall-Ewas', 'sort', 'exceptional', 'film', 'andThe', 'Incredibleswas', 'only', 'so-so', 'had', 'exact', 'opposite', 'experience', 'found', 'Wall-E', 'be', 'so-so', 'Incredibles', 'be', 'wonderful', 'film', 'human', 'element', 'attached', 'Also', 'Incredibles', 'film', 'UP', 'had', 'PG', 'rating', 'not', 'G', 'might', 'mean', 'deeper', 'perhaps', 'disturbing', 'things', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'emotional', 'weight', 'most', 'certainly', 'does.Edward', 'Asner', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'lost', 'Yes', 'ACTUALLY', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'person', 'pass', 'away', 'end', 'life', 'animated', 'feature', 'Imagine', 'Reality', 'Up', 'more', 'bite', 'empathize', 'Carl', 'very', 'basic', 'human', 'level', 'Wall-E', ""'re"", 'trying', 'gain', 'empathy', 'machine', 'acting', 'human', 'Not', 'same', 'thing.Into', 'Carl', 'lonely', 'life', 'wannabe', 'boy', 'scout', 'Russell', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'who', 'trying', 'earn', 'merit', 'badge', 'Carl', 'none', 'help', 'want', 'help', 'Russell', 'gain', 'badge.Amidst', 'Carl', 'life', 'understanding', 'now', 'dead', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'never', 'got', 'have', 'adventures', 'married', 'Carl', 'bought', 'home', 'took', 'over', 'lives', 'made', 'home-bodies', 'grew', 'up', 'worshipping', 'adventurer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'wanting', 'go', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Ellie', 'never', 'made', 'So', 'when', 'Carl', 'house', 'being', 'threatened', 'developers', 'life', 'steered', 'Shady', 'Oaks', 'retirement', 'facility', 'Carl', 'mass', 'helium', 'balloons', 'house', 'floats', 'away', 'Trouble', 'pesky', 'boy', 'scout', 'on-board', 'too.Eventually', 'make', 'way', 'South', 'America', 'discover', 'dangers', 'foes', 'friends', 'yes', 'adventure', 'Talking', 'dogs', 'obsession', 'squirrels', 'add', 'high', 'amount', 'hilarity', 'several', 'scenes', 'unique', 'bird', 'Russell', 'chocolate.More', 'telling', 'friendship', 'Russell', 'Carl', 'generation', 'gap', 'closes', 'Carl', 'open', 'heart', 'mind', 'new', 'experiences', 'Also', 'learning', 'let', 'go', 'Ellie', 'memory', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'plot-line', 'amazing', 'story.The', 'animation', 'most', '3-D', 'style', 'animations', 'impressive', 'colors', 'shadows', 'depth', 'made', 'scenes', 'come', 'alive', 'story', 'worthwhile', 'Just', 'Incredibles', 'tale', 'human', 'beings', 'doing', 'unique', 'things', 'regular', 'challenges', 'mental', 'hurdles', 'see', 'complex', 'animated', 'films', 'not', 'robot']",N/A

Cars is a movie that sufferd from many of these plot holes, but stile thanks to its wild idea was entertaining. Though for an adult it dosn't really make sense. Finialy Up. It takes what is like with Cars and takes out most of the cheap uncreative plots and situations.

He can't go to the movies because most don't provide earphones or closed captioning for the deaf/hearing impaired.

1209334,AGCOCRW8A56U8,B001KVZ6FW,buddyhead,"[0, 1]","The action and scenery in Up are breathtaking, particularly as so much of the action takes place in high places: a floating house; a dirigible; dogs in planes; and thousand foot waterfalls.  The attention to detail, color, and perspective, especially in 3D, is stunning.  The premise, of an old balloon salesman escaping reality via thousands of balloons attached to his home, is clever, and the story is energized and given comic relief by a little boy who's accidentally along for the ride.But the real scene-stealers are the emotional moments that serve as bookends to the movie.  The first is a montage spanning the courtship, marriage, and gorgeous relationship between main character Karl and his lifelong love, Ellie.  It is one of the most beautiful moments I've ever seen in a movie- film or CGI; it comes out of the blue and gives your heartstrings an unexpected yank, much like the ""When She Love Me"" (Sarah Mclachlan) scene in Toy Story 2.  The other, between Karl and the 8 year old thorn in his side, Russell, ties the film up in a tidy package (and would be a spoiler to reveal).  Both are superbly done, and the theater was full of silently crying adults squeezing unaware kids on their laps, or leaning over to kiss them in adjacent seats.A consequence of that kind of true life emotional drama is making the fantastic action scenes more unrealistic by comparison.  Imagine how much more cartoonish events in The Incredibles or Flushed Away would seem if sandwiched between scenes of Beaches or Love Story.  And some of Up's action might be unsettling to young kids, especially the menacing guard dogs that appear throughout the film.

Like all Pixar movies, there's plenty of laughs and entertainment for young and old. It's not strictly a kid's movie.What is unusual is 2 things:- first Pixar movie to use the RealD 3-D technology- some non-traditional story elements that reflect the realities of modern life, rarely seen in mainstream children's animationFirst, the 3-D experience is fantastic! You get a pair of plastic glasses when you pay for the ticket. They cost more than a normal movie ($16.50 in NYC vs $12.50 normally). Unlike the flimsy paper glasses you're used to with red and blue lenses, these glasses are clear. They look like normal reading glasses and don't interfere with the colors onscreen, so you see clearly through them. And what you see is amazing! The effects really look real, instead of like flat cardboard cut-outs placed in front of one another. You can move your head around and the 3-D effect is maintained.The effects really have depth and some of the more spectacular shots are the flying ones, where you see buildings or canyons far below. You really have to experience this for yourself.Now for the story elements:-- WARNING! POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK ----- WARNING! POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK ---The film has two story elements that you might not expect from a Disney/Pixar film. First is Carl and Ellie's inability to have children. You see them grow old, then eventually, Carl becomes a widower. At this point in the film, I felt my eyes wetting up.Second is the little boy (Russell)'s non-traditional family situation. He has an absentee father (who is mentioned in the film, but never seen) and a guardian who is not his mother. Russell also has Asian features, perhaps the first Pixar film to have such a major character.Some people may consider these plot elements controversial. I didn't.-- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW ---- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW --UP is a depiction of modern life, changing times, then a return to innocence. It deals with growing old, modernization, friendship, selflessness, and many themes that can be enjoyed by all audiences. Like all Pixar movies, it doesn't dumb you down.I highly recommend this film if you can still catch it in theaters. Undoubtedly, the cheap paper glasses is what you'll get for the DVD/Blu-ray release of this movie (because of costs), so the theater is your only chance to experience the real 3D effects.

1209338,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001KVZ6FW,Caleb Williams,"[1, 1]","What an inspiring and yet, another genuinely enjoyable feature film from the artists at Disney & Pixar studios. I went into this having high hopes as I'm a massive fan of all Disney/Pixar collaborations with the exception of Wall-E which I simply did not enjoy for reasons I honestly cannot explain. I have to say my expectations were not only met, but surpassed. This not only warmed the heart but tickled me to the point I was in genuine tears of laughter. These types of films have developed a way of telling a story through the art of pictures; there is no need for words but music and moving images can tell just as much of a story than an entire script could. Even though I didn't enjoy Wall-E, this is something that I will praise it for. The makers have developed a way of telling a story without needing to explain it to you through dialogue. Well paced and well depicted animation is all you need to really tell a story and this is why I appreciated this that little bit more.The movie tells the story of Carl Fredricksen an elderly man who, as a child, idolised explorer, Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz, while Carl was a young boy was discredited as a fraud by claiming to have discovered the bones of a giant bird which he found at Paradise Falls in South America. Determined to prove himself, Charles vows to not return until he has brought back a living specimen of the bird. Meanwhile, Carl meets Ellie, a feisty young girl with the same explorative dreams as Carl and they become fast friends. Then begins the silent homage to their life as it shows them becoming married and living their lives together still as in love as the day they first fell for one another. Sadly, Ellie, in her old age passes away and Carl is left alone in the home they bought and decorated together and around the home skyscrapers are being built with Carl being constantly pressured to sell his home to the company building the skyscrapers. After a series of more annoying events, Carl decides he's had enough and wants to go on that adventure to Paradise Falls him and Ellie always wanted to go on. But instead of just jumping on a plane, he fills his house with balloons and decides to fly there and take his house with him.After the initial launch of the house, there is a lot more to the story as we are gradually introduced to Russell, a wilderness explorer aiming to achieve his ""help the elderly"" badge so he can become a senior Wilderness Explorer and in order to do this he is determined to help Carl with anything he needs help with. Then, when they make it to the wilderness we meet Kevin the giant bird and a talking dog named Dug. These are characters, although extremely different from one another, blend well together and actually make for a heart warming good guy ensemble cast. Some of the contents of the film are actually quite clich&eacute;. The grumpy old man who's grumpy because he never accomplished his dream and the young boy who has all the ambition in the world and just wants to impress his family. These are character traits indicative of the Disney genre, although that is no bad thing. The setting, although at times filled with vibrant colours, is actually quite bland and unimaginative, though that doesn't take anything away from the animation which, as you'd expect from a Pixar movie, is superb.The comedy, again as you would expect, is very witty and at times unusual but always funny. The bizarre traits of the animal characters dragged along for the ride are both genuine and hysterical, such as the typical dog traits for Dug, but fitted with a human voice amplifies those traits to a comically terrific level. The voice acting of all involved is, again spot on. Although not voiced by major names, the voices fit the characters well; from the loveable old man Carl voiced by Edward Asner, to the adorable Russell voiced by the young talent new on the scene, Jordan Nagai. One of the voices, I wish to point out for personal reasons really took me by surprise as I only realised who this man really was through simply browsing Wikipedia, and I was overjoyed to discover who this man was. Christopher Plummer was the voice of Carl's hero, Charles Muntz. Now the name may not ring any bells with most modern film fans, but to those fans of the old movies, especially fans of musical, The Sound of Music you will recognise this man as Captain Von Trapp himself. That's a little nerdy joy for me, so I hope you'll forgive me for getting a little carried away.Overall, there's nothing bad I can say about this film. It's got originality to it that you see all the time with the Pixar outings, yet it keeps to the same old formula Disney has made famous since its creation, yet the mixing styles never get boring. Sure, to some the formulaic layout of the Disney movies may get a tad tedious, and they have even grated on me from time to time, but I adore the Disney/Pixar collaborations simply because they're fun and remind me of the simpler time when I was a kid. This is another strong outing from the team and I would strongly recommend it to all film fans of all ages, as there's something there for everyone.",5,"As Expected, Brilliant.",1270684800,"04 8,

""Up"" is, perhaps, their most charming, touching, and exciting animated feature yet - at least in my opinion. If there is a fulfilling movie for all the family, this is surely one. ""Up"" comes in a fabulous package that includes both Blue Ray and DVD copies of the film, plus a Digital Copy.Early in the film, we meet young Carl Fredricksen, who dreams of embarking on an adventure trip to South America, just like his hero, Charles Muntz, a famous adventurer.  Carl meets young Ellie, who also has the same dreams and aspirations. Carl makes a living by selling balloons, and eventually falls in love, gets married to and ages together with Ellie. Unfortunately, they are not able to realize their dream of going to Paradise Falls, in South America, due to lack of money. Sadly, Ellie passes away due to old age, and Carl is left alone in the house that he shared with his one and only love. Some time after this sad episode, Russell, a young explorer, knocks at his door. He claims that he needs to get a badge for assisting an elderly person, so that he can earn the title of Senior Wilderness Explorer. After being pestered by Russell for a while, Carl agrees to help him, and gives him some work at his yard.One day, just when Carl is about to be forced to move to a retirement home, he attaches thousands of balloons to the foundation of his house, creates his own makeshift blimp,  and flies away, to everyone's surprise. He doesn't realize that Russell was at the porch of his home by the time his house took off. Initially angry at the kid, Carl unwillingly accepts his uninvited guest on his trip. After some time, too, Carl learns about the need of love that Russell had, and takes him under his umbrella. Together they will embark on an unforgettable journey, which will include storms, exotic wildlife, talking dogs, and in which they will meet an unexpected ghost from the past.""Up"" is a beautiful and colorful movie, with great, true values and feelings. It's about life, aging, death, and friendship, and I'm very sure that it will reach your heart and the best of you. This fascinating set includes four discs. Disc One is the Blue Ray with the feature film, plus extras, like the theatrical short ""Partly Cloudy,"" alternate scenes, a making-of documentary, and more.

1209355,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001KVZ6FW,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","Disney/Pixar's ""Up"" is such a wonderful film, one that can make you laugh just as much as it can wow you with its sense of good old fashioned adventure. It features characters that are both funny and endearing, which is to say that they surpass mere cartoon goofiness and go for something more meaningful. The plot is both a harrowing journey and a flight of fancy, both of which can easily appeal to any child that loves hearing a good bedtime story. Because many adults keep that part of themselves alive (and I count myself as one of them), this movie can appeal to them too. It's become quite clear that the Pixar team really knows what they're doing; even after the release of ten films, they remain as fresh and exciting as ever. They're not merely masters of computer animation, but also of direction and screenwriting.Released theatrically in both 2-D and 3-D formats, ""Up"" tells the gratifying story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Edward Asner), an elderly man who grew up loving adventure and idolizing an aviation expert named Charles Muntz. For many years, Carl was happily married to his childhood best friend, Ellie, also an adventure lover. Upon her death, he finds himself both longing for excitement and in a struggle with construction workers, who are building high rises directly next to his quaint wooden house. So as to escape spending his remaining days in a retirement home, Carl ties thousands of balloons to his home, allowing it to lift off its foundation and sail through the air like an airship. He hopes to fulfill on the dream he and Ellie shared: To go to the South American wonder of nature known as Paradise Falls.Much to Carl's chagrin, he's picked up a passenger. Enter Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), a Boy Scout very intent on earning his final merit badge (assisting a senior citizen). Inexperienced but admirably determined to explore the wilderness, pudgy little Russell immediately gets on the old man's nerves; he's not a companion so much as he's extra baggage, a talkative young man who inadvertently makes things more difficult than they need be. As time goes on, however, Carl begins to see Russell in a different light, not as a liability, but merely as a boy who's still in the process of growing up. He's at just the age of discovering the difference between things that sound fun and things that actually aren't. He's also at the age when he tries to make sense of why he so rarely sees his father, who works all the time.Upon their arrival in South America, Carl and Russell begin the long and dangerous process of pulling the floating house towards a majestic waterfall, where Ellie had always wanted their house to be located. They have to hurry, though; the helium in the balloons is starting to lose its lifting power. As the journey forward, they meet an elderly Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has gone mad with the desire to prove to the world that a rare species of bird actually exists. When he learns that one of those birds has been spotted by Carl and Russell--a tall, brightly feathered fowl Russell names Kevin--it becomes a life or death struggle for survival, not merely for the bird, but for everyone involved.There's a beauty to this movie that goes beyond the vivid color palate and striking scenery. The story is a perfect combination of mature themes and childlike whimsy, and the characters can tickle our funny bones just as easily as they can warm our hearts. They're not shallow cartoon caricatures but fully developed individuals with surprisingly realistic personality quirks. You actually care for them. This applies, strangely enough, to a series of dogs owned by Charles, each equipped with a special collar that translates their mannerisms into human speech; the lead dog is an adorable golden retriever named Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson, the film's writer and co-director). In spite of their ability to speak, the emotional essence of real dogs remains unchanged--Dug loves unconditionally and proves useful, but he's also very easily distracted by small things like tennis balls and the possibility that a squirrel is nearby.There's also beauty to film's simplicity, which basically reaffirms the idea that convoluted plots and cumbersome details don't always make a film more interesting. There are essentially five main characters, and they're engaged in a story that aims to entertain rather than challenge. Obviously, there are times when story should aim to challenge. Case in point: Last year's Disney/Pixar film ""WALL-E,"" which achieved greatness in large part because of its well-rounded social commentary on wastefulness and gluttony. But in the case of a film like ""Up,"" there was no reason to make a point of any kind; even its message of living life to the fullest isn't forced on the audience. It just wanted to be a charming story, and a charming story it is. Young and old alike will adore ""Up,"" one of the year's most delightful films.",5,Floating Towards Adventure,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,4946,"['Disney/Pixar', 'Up', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one',

1209356,AN9J46667D80O,B001KVZ6FW,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","What an incredibly delightful, beautiful, wonderful and, dare I say, uplifting movie this is! A true piece of art from the animators at Pixar, bringing together a great story line, some wondrous visuals and some very memorable characters.Up is the latest in a string of great Pixar films going back to the likes of Toy Story, which I still haven't seen. It's the best of their movies I've seen so far, and certainly the most beautiful to look at (beating out the previous best looking film, Finding Nemo). It's sweet without being saccharine, touching and enjoyable.The film tells the story of an old man who, in his youth, met the girl of his dreams. They married and held out an ambition to visit far off exotic locales in South America. Little things (like real life), keep them from doing this until finally, for the wife, it's too late. Her husband (wonderfully voice by Ed Asner), despondent, lonely and no longer really belonging anywhere, ties off a bunch of balloons and takes his house into the air in a manner that looks almost plausible.Joining him is a young ""Wilderness"" Scout (continuing the trend in popular entertainment whereby the Boy Scouts don't exist, but all other forms of scouts do), who is trying to earn what is most emphatically not called a Merit Badge for helping the elderly. They wind up meeting a very colorful moa-type bird and a dog who talks by virtue of a collar (and is obsessed with squirrels).The film is flawless. Seriously, I couldn't find a single thing to dislike (something I had no problem with during last year's Wall-E). The visuals are stunning, the plot is great and the acting is wonderful. It's without a doubt the best film I've seen all year (though considering the string of movies I've seen recently, this isn't saying a lot).

Up fit that mold perfectly. It centers on a cranky elderly man named Carl whose intent on fulfilling a dream of his late wife of taking a trip to an exotic place in South America. Unintentionally a wide eyed kid, Russell, tags along, and Carl has no choice but to deal with the annoyance.In truly unique Pixar fashion they make the totally impossible believable, like that a house could fly with helium filled balloons, or that a device could be made to allow dogs to speak. There are wonderfully funny and inventive things abound. But it's the compelling characters and heartfelt story are really what makes it so great. There's a five minute montage at the beginning that, without the use of dialog, encapsulates the life of a married couple, and it's truly a most brilliant accomplishment. That sets the tone for the rest of the film, and while it doesn't end quite as strong as it starts it never losers its heart and sense of wonder.Ratatouille was one of my favorite films of 2007, Wall-E one of my tops from 2008, and now Up ranks easily as one of 2009's best films. I love Pixar.The special features in the four disk set leave some to be desired. I'm not sure why Disney can't do commentaries for these Pixar masterpieces. The blu-ray extra disk in the four disk set basically includes only a short making of documentary and a few other small things. Nevertheless, the four disk set is definitely the one to get. Even if you don't have a blu-ray player the DVD version is also included, and once you do go blu-ray you won't have to buy the movie again to watch it that way.

I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes.  From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny (and it's cheaper here at Amazon) to anyone who appreciates art.By the way, this is not ""a funny cartoon"" but a suspenseful and sentimental adventure story, with a few laughs along the way.

When I say this about Disney and Pixar's Up, I mean it both for how the film makes us feel as well as the way it looks. It's filled with glorious animation and spectacular colors. This is the kind of film that will inspire you to buy a Blu-Ray player, if you haven't done so already. Vibrant does it minimal justice.Much like Wall.e, Up is something kids will have a blast with, but will also force them to think. It's not a mindless bouncing off the walls disaster, like so may cartoons have been in the past.Like most great films, Up centers around a love story. Two kids meet and fall in love at a young age, due mainly to their shared common interest in being explorers. They are Carl and Ellie and we see their relationship grow and prosper and eventually turn into a wholesome marriage. This is all shown to us in what I considered to be the film's most original and touching moment. It's all done without dialogue, and is accompanied by a heartfelt score.Sadly, Ellie passes away and leaves Carl alone and heartbroken. They had plans together to travel to one of their favorite places: Paradise Falls. They had a jar with their life savings set aside and everything. But as is too often the case, life got in the way of their plans and with unforeseen bills and expenses, the trip was never had. In case it's not blatantly obvious, you're crying your eyes out by this point in the film.We see that Carl has turned into the sweetest old man imaginable, complete with a full head of white hair and a set of large, dark, square-framed eye glasses. He lost a piece of himself when Ellie died and his beloved home becomes a valuable keepsake for him to remember her by.When he is threatened with losing his sacred home to a rich tyrant, Carl must act fast. Having several hundreds of balloons stored in his home (which is meaningful to the story) he remedies a brilliant plan. He will take his house, with the help of those balloons and a whole lot of helium, and will fly away to Paradise Falls!His plan works, but he soon realizes he has unintentionally brought someone along with him; a small boy-scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai).The two befriend one another and embark on an incredible adventure, involving a classic villain voiced by Christopher Plummer, and several other interesting creatures. Marking it as only the second animated film to ever be nominated for an Oscar for best picture of the year; Up is sure to become a timeless classic.",5,Up Review,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,2755,"['UPSTARRING', 'Voices', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Jerome', 'RanftWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'Bob', 'PetersonDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'Thomas', 'McCarthyRated', 'PGGenre', 'Animation', 'AdventureRelease', 'Date', '29', 'May', '2009What', 'beautiful', 'film', 'When', 'say', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'Up', 'mean', 'how', 'film', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'filled', 'glorious', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'colors', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'already', 'Vibrant', 'minimal', 'justice.Much', 'Wall.e', 'Up', 'something', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'blast', 'will', 'also', 'force', 'think', 'not', 'mindless', 'bouncing', 'walls', 'disaster', 'so', 'may', 'cartoons', 'have', 'been', 'past.Like', 'most', 'great', 'films', 'Up', 'centers', 'love', 'story', 'Two', 'kids', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'young', 'age', 'due', 'mainly', 'shared', 'common', 'interest', 'being', 'explorers', 'are', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'see', 'relationship', 'grow', 'prosper', 'eventually', 'turn', 'wholesome', 'marriage', 'shown', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'film', 'most', 'original', 'touching', 'moment', 'done', 'dialogue', 'accompanied', 'heartfelt', 'score.Sadly', 'Ellie', 'away', 'Carl', 'alone', 'heartbroken', 'had', 'plans', 'together', 'travel', 'one', 'favorite', 'places', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'had', 'jar', 'life', 'savings', 'set', 'aside', 'everything', 'too', 'often', 'case', 'life', 'got', 'way', 'plans', 'unforeseen', 'bills', 'expenses', 'trip', 'was', 'never', 'had', 'case', 'not', 'blatantly', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'point', 'film.We', 'see', 'Carl', 'turned', 'sweetest', 'old', 'man', 'imaginable', 'complete', 'full', 'head', 'white', 'hair', 'set', 'large', 'dark', 'square-framed', 'eye', 'glasses', 'lost', 'piece', 'when', 'Ellie', 'died', 'beloved', 'home', 'valuable', 'keepsake', 'remember', 'by.When', 'threatened', 'losing', 'sacred', 'home', 'rich', 'tyrant', 'Carl', 'must', 'act', 'fast', 'Having', 'several', 'hundreds', 'balloons', 'stored', 'home', 'meaningful', 'story', 'brilliant', 'plan', 'will', 'take', 'house', 'help', 'balloons', 'whole', 'lot', 'helium', 'will', 'fly', 'away', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'plan', 'soon', 'unintentionally', 'brought', 'someone', 'small', 'boy-scout', 'named', 'Russell', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', '.The', 'two', 'befriend', 'one', 'embark', 'incredible', 'adventure', 'involving', 'classic', 'villain', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'several', 'other', 'interesting', 'creatures', 'Marking', 'only', 'second', 'animated', 'film', 'ever', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'best', 'picture', 'year', 'Up', 'sure', 'become', 'timeless', 'classic']",N/A

Up is that film. I wasn't sure what to make of the preview, which featured this grumpy old man sitting on a porch of a floating house held aloft by thousands of baloons. The film is so much more than that. It's rediscovering the adventure of life when you think there's nothing left. The opening montage, which shows how two people meet, marry, and grow old together, is perfect. You understand how this old man is the way he is. The adventure begins when his home is threatened by urban development, and his ingenious and original way of dealing with it. Ed Asner is the absolute perfect choice for Mr. Frederickson, and all the voice actors are spot-on with their roles. The speaking dogs are wonderful, and how they speak is a refreshing take on how to portray talking animals. The visuals are stunning, which is what we've come to expect from Pixar, but these are exceptional. The attention to detail is down-to-the-minute-detail. I saw this film in 3D at the theater, which was an experience, and I maust say there really isn't anything lost in viewing it in regular play. The sound is just right, without over-whelming the voice tracks, which happens a LOT in movies anymore.

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 3]","Pixar has found a home with Disney and, with apologies to Dreamworks and other animation studios, no one has come close in recent years to their fresh, inventive, and importantly, timeless spirit in computer animation.  In UP, a tale of loneliness and friendship is told in a simple, heartfelt way.  This is one of the best films of the year and puts live action films to shame.Carl begins as an adventure-loving boy whose childhood friendship with a girl, Ellie, grows into a marriage as adults and a dream to visit their ideal destination, Paradise Falls in South America.  Later widowed, Carl becomes a crusty, elderly man who longs for escape. In time, his neighborhood is transformed into an urban development, and one fateful day with the threat of being committed to a retirement community, he takes his house on a bold, unlikely trip by balloons through the skies to South America.  Unfortunately, he discovers an accidental passenger in the form of a Boy Scout named Russell who is looking to get his final merit badge by helping a senior citizen.  Carl must make a momentous decision that changes his life and affects Russell.  Their joint flight arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Paradise Falls.  Along the way they encounter an unusual, giant bird dubbed Kevin and a dog named Dug whose thoughts are vocalized through his special electronic collar.  This motley group encounters a mysterious, dangerous presence that threatens them and jeopardizes Carl's journey to his final destination.Pete Docter (Wall-E, Toy Story) and Bob Peterson (Finding Nemo) bring their story and screenplay talents to the fore as co-directors.  It's really a story about unfulfilled, broken dreams and things left undone, and the spirit and drive to recapture those feelings.  The film begins with a subplot involving the friendship and growing romance of a young Carl and Ellie who share a passion for life and adventure.  The imaginative vignettes tell a complete love story in an opening montage that ends as our film is only beginning-wow!What makes this film head and shoulders above most animations is its poignant confrontation of life's ups and downs.  It's about life and death told in terms that are not disingenuous.  In the grand tradition of Disney classics as Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, movies about finding a safe place from danger are at the core of children's animation, and this film plays on that tradition.  The novelty here is that the lead character is elderly.  There is a sense of The Wizard of Oz in its otherworldly journey of discovery and camaraderie, and even the climax smacks of Saturday morning cliffhangers.  A nice change of pace is the lack of contemporary, inside jokes or puns based on pop culture that are staples of such Dreamworks hits as the Shrek films.  The situations here are organically amusing from natural conflicts and plot.Carl (voiced to perfection by Edward Asner) is a mean, bitter soul who rediscovers his innocence and humanity through Russell, who in turn discovers the safety of a nuclear family with Carl and some unlikely companions.  Kevin is cute, emanating amusing sound effects and body movements without uttering a single line of dialogue.  Dug is a riot as the misfit dog whose heart of gold is matched by his incessant habit of having his `talking' interrupted at any moment by a sudden spasm of posturing and shouting, ""point"" or ""squirrel""! It's a hoot.  Christopher Plummer is effectively sinister as a blast from the past.  The only criticism of the movie is minor at the end when we are not quite sure about Russell's parents and how much they are part of his life.  John Ratzenberger's (Cheers) streak of doing a voice in every major Pixar release is intact.The computer animation is so good, that anything not human looks like a picturesque postcard.  When Carl's balloons sprout above his house, we admire their stunning, vibrant colors.  Interesting uses of cinematography are employed as if this were a live action feature.  The final image is ironic as it is iconic, a fitting end to a fairy tale.This one ranks highly alongside Pixar favorites like Finding Nemo and Wall-E.

More so made by the fact that it was terribly projected when I first saw this film in the cinema. Can't see it was an optimal presentation, nevertheless, the picture projection in cinemas have been disappointments of late. This BD puts every non-digital projection cinema to shame. If this edition has 3D capabilities, this would be the final nail in the coffins of cinema projection. The audio quality is superb. Dialouge is clear and even my most favourite moments where the soundtrack hums softly (especially in the bittersweet opening), it is subtle and poignant.Without reiterating the plot, this movie is one of the best films of this year. Beats Transformers 2 right out of the block. I couldn't even imagine how on earth TF2's gross could beat this similarly box office friendly film. I guess good clean and well-intentioned fun is out of the question for today's kids. You don't get to see a senior citizen as a protagonist in any movies that often nowadays.

The story is completely 100% improbable, but so believeable and heartwarming.Up is a road movie. In the first 10 minutes Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner's voice) grows up, falls in love, gets married, and his wife dies before they can take their dream adventure trip to Paradise Falls. The first teary eyed moment. To avoid being hauled off to a retirement home, Mr. Fredricksen, ties a million balloons to his house and floats the house away. A young boy trying to earn his 'help the elderly' badge is a stow away in the house. The wonderful part of this movie is the boy and old man trying to get the house to Paradise Falls.The movie is one part Incredibles, one part Wizard of Oz, one part The Red Balloon, little bit Skinny and Fatty, and toss in a little Gran Torino (not the foul language or violence, but the relationship with the neighbor boy). The relationship between the old and the young boy is the real point of this film.It's hard to imagine how animation can get better than this. This film had wonderful pacing. It acted more like a film than a cartoon. Everything moved gracefully and naturally. It also didn't try to be the kind of creepy animated realism like Polar Express.This movie is for all ages.

Continually improving their animating abilities (no matter what Pixar movie it is I am awestruck at the quality) and writing ORIGINAL (sans the very average Cars) stories, the geniuses out west could take the easy route but that is not the Pixar way.If you have seen the trailers you are no doubt focused on the balloons that carry the lead role away in his house but the main focus is that this is a LOVE STORY.  The first 10 minutes are some of Pixar's best work ever which is very analogous to the first 30 minutes of WALL-E which is brought down by a very average 2nd and 3rd act (WALL-E).  We learn of Carl Fredricksen falling in love with Elle, are quickly shown highlights of their happy life together and their continual goal to go on a great adventure in South America.  A great adventure that they never were able to take together due to lack of money and Elle's death (this is a deeper movie than other Pixar productions so be prepared to talk to your kids).After Elle is gone, Carl decides that he must take action to go on that adventure they never got to do.  Along the way he meets up with a young boy, talking dog(s), crazy bird and an antagonist that Karl must defeat.The animation in Up is of course top notch.  The story is creative and original, and it's a joy to watch.  The only thing that hurts this movie is it's not very kid-friendly in my opinion.  I took my 4 1/2 year old daughter and 30 minutes in she wanted to leave (we stayed for the whole thing).  I feel the main audience for this movie is adults and senior citizens (yes I am serious) with children and teenagers second this time around.  Kids will probably like it but not like Toy Story, Monsters or Nemo.For fun I will rank the Pixar movies according to me but this is completely subjective.

We see them get married, suffer through the inability to have children, and then grow old together in bliss until she dies one day.  We see how from the very beginning as children they shared a fascination for this South American adventurer Charles Muntz, and how they perpetually planned for, but had to put off their plans to visit the fabled Paradise Falls that Muntz had explored.  When she dies and he faces eviction from the house they had always lived together, he sets off determinedly for Paradise Falls.Russell too has his back story -  he misses his father, who used to do simple things with him like sit by the street and count blue cars together, but now his father doesn't have time for him.  It is when Carl asks him why, that the movie strongly hints that Russell's parents are divorced and his dad is now with another woman named Phyllis.  At the end of the movie, Russell's father is still not there for him, despite having promised (only his mother shows up at the boy scout ceremony), but Carl is there for him instead.The movie ends in heartwarming Pixar fashion - through her old scrapbook, Ellie has left a message for Carl to start a new adventure - and he does, and we see Carl take on his new role as surrogate father for Russell, and we also see that his old house has miraculously landed right next to Paradise Falls, just like in the old painting that Ellie had done years ago over their fireplace mantel.The movie has sad and funny moments and is one that the whole family can enjoy together.

1209375,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B001KVZ6FW,Daryl B,"[0, 0]","Disney/Pixar is on a roll. After delivering last summer's endearing ""Wall-e"", they've again upped (no pun intended) the ante and created another animated masterpiece that will appeal to children and adults alike.The story follows Carl, who as a young man, dreamt of great adventure. This love led him to his wife, Ellie, who like Carl, fantasized about a faraway place in South America. As on old man and now without his beloved wife, Carl faces the loss of his home, the one connection to his wife, and being forced into a retirement community. When Carl is finally pushed to the brink and makes a bad decision, the courts decide its time for him to be placed in a nursing home. Carl, however, has other plans and, unknowingly with a persistent boy named Russell in tow, floats away toward the site that his childhood hero visited in his great exploits. Once there, Carl quickly finds out that his hero is not all he was cracked up to be and must find a way to safely return Russell and himself home.This little film, like ""Wall-e"", is one of the most charming and touching in the Disney/Pixar pantheon.  Comparable to ""Wall-e"" with its environmental message, this movie also delivers an important commentary about friendship and the importance of living life to its fullest. There are several scenes that are sure to tug at your heart strings but also enough laughs and action to keep the little ones happy. The characters are rich and well developed---Carl, a loveable old curmudgeon (voiced by Ed Asner) and Russell, a sweet kid who needs a paternal influence in his life. My favorite character is Doug, a ""talking"" dog, who's dialogue is exactly what you would picture a dog saying if they could really speak.

1209377,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B001KVZ6FW,Davewise,"[2, 3]","Based on previews I expected ""Up"" to be another very funny, quality movie from Pixar; however, when I sat down to watch it I got that and much more. It starts sweet with the main character, Carl, as a little boy meeting Ellie, a little girl who shares his desire for adventure and admiration of the explorer Muntz. Carl and Ellie get married and move into the abandoned house where they met. Ellie painted a picture of living in the house beside the big waterfall in the lost valley where Muntz had traveled. As they grow old together they save for this dream only to use the money for other needs as they arise.The movie turns sad when Ellie passes away and Carl is almost forced into living at a retirement home. To avoid giving up the house, Carl uses an abundance of balloons (doubtlessly saved up from his work selling them) to lift his house off the ground, intending to sail it to that lost valley in South America. Carl soon discovers Russell, a young scout who was trying to earn his last merit badge by helping the old man, accidentally came along for the ride. The two go on an adventure which sees them encounter a rare bird species, a pack of talking dogs, and the adventurer Muntz.  Along the way Carl ends up making some hard choices, such as choosing between fulfilling his and Ellie's dream and rescuing the rare bird. In the end, Russell and Carl each provide something the other needs - Russell needing a father figure and Carl needing a new adventure and purpose.There are lots of humorous scenes throughout, my favorite being when Carl and Russell first encounter Dug, one of the dogs who can talk via special collars. But it's the story of Carl and Ellie which makes it so much more than a funny cartoon. Even with relatively little screen time and dialog, the scenes where their relationship unfolds are very moving, like any good movie love story. You feel it when Ellie passes away and you understand Carl's motivations afterward. By the end, the movie will have you laughing and crying.",5,"Sad, funny, and ultimately Up-lifting",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,2012,"['Based', 'previews', 'expected', 'Up', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'quality', 'movie', 'Pixar', 'however', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'got', 'much', 'more', 'sweet', 'main', 'character', 'Carl', 'little', 'boy', 'meeting', 'Ellie', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'shares', 'desire', 'adventure', 'admiration', 'explorer', 'Muntz', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'get', 'married', 'move', 'abandoned', 'house', 'where', 'met', 'Ellie', 'painted', 'picture', 'living', 'house', 'big', 'waterfall', 'lost', 'valley', 'where', 'Muntz', 'had', 'traveled', 'grow', 'old', 'together', 'save', 'dream', 'only', 'use', 'money', 'other', 'needs', 'arise.The', 'movie', 'turns', 'sad', 'when', 'Ellie', 'away', 'Carl', 'almost', 'forced', 'living', 'retirement', 'home', 'avoid', 'giving', 'up', 'house', 'Carl', 'abundance', 'balloons', 'doubtlessly', 'saved', 'up', 'work', 'selling', 'lift', 'house', 'ground', 'intending', 'sail', 'lost', 'valley', 'South', 'America', 'Carl', 'soon', 'discovers', 'Russell', 'young', 'scout', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'earn', 'last', 'merit', 'badge', 'helping', 'old', 'man', 'accidentally', 'came', 'along', 'ride', 'two', 'go', 'adventure', 'encounter', 'rare', 'bird', 'species', 'pack', 'talking', 'dogs', 'adventurer', 'Muntz', 'way', 'Carl', 'up', 'making', 'hard', 'choices', 'such', 'choosing', 'fulfilling', 'Ellie', 'dream', 'rescuing', 'rare', 'bird', 'end', 'Russell', 'Carl', 'provide', 'something', 'other', 'Russell', 'needing', 'father', 'figure', 'Carl', 'needing', 'new', 'adventure', 'are', 'lots', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'being', 'when', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'first', 'encounter', 'Dug', 'one', 'dogs', 'who', 'can', 'talk', 'special', 'collars', 'story', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'Even', 'relatively', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'where', 'relationship', 'unfolds', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'feel', 'when', 'Ellie', 'away', 'understand', 'Carl', 'motivations', 'afterward', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'crying']",N/A
1209378,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B001KVZ6FW,David A. Wend,"[4, 5]","When I first saw the trailers for UP I was wondering how Pixar could mix a flying house, an old man and a boy into a story that would be interesting. I was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity of the writers. The story of UP could be directed to quite a few people I know.  In a nutshell, the story is about being young-at-heart.Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children seeking adventure. They both want to follow in the footsteps of their hero Charles Muntz to a place in South America called Paradise Falls.  Muntz is a figure based on the explorers of the past and reminded me of the Lost World by H. G. Wells. Muntz has found a kind of lost world where a bird exists that is not found anywhere else.  Scientists scoff at Muntz that a skeleton of the bird is a forgery and the explorer sets off to prove himself.As for Carl and Ellie, as the years go by they have to use their adventure money for other things. They get older and although they don't loose sight of their adventure they never manage to do it.  We watch in the opening minutes as Carl and Ellie grow older and Ellie become ill and dies.  On his own, Carl's neighborhood changes so that his home is boxed in by high-rise buildings.  When Carl is consigned to a retirement home he decided to take a different course and takes the adventure he had been putting off.Carl's character as a curmudgeonly old man is forced to change as he inadvertently takes Russell, a Wilderness Explorer Scout, along for his adventure. When Carl gets to his destination he is challenged by the very Charles Muntz who inspired his adventure.  He has a choice to save a rare bird that Muntz has been trying to capture for decades (for his personal glory) or let Muntz take the bird. In making his decision, Carl grows back into the caring person he had been with his wife.The characters are beautifully brought to life. Carl, voiced by Ed Asner, did remind me of Spencer Tracey with the square jaw and busy eyebrows.  He comes off as lovable under his hard exterior. Charles Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer made an effective villain with his single-minded determination to get his bird.  Then, there also are Muntz's faithful dogs, who have the ability to talk, that provide a lot of the comedy.  The chubby Russell is an endearing character for his stance of what is right and wrong.I have read some criticism of Up that Carl and Muntz are too old for the roles they are taking, that it is impossible for a house to float along with thousands of balloons and the dogs flying airplanes is ridiculous.  Isn't that the essence of story telling? If we can't be delighted, at least on occasion, by the impossible and allow a little fantasy into our lives then we are the poorer for it.  The guys at Pixar have made another wonderful film that touches on life and shows us the possibilities.",5,UP is a First-Class Adventure,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,2840,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'UP', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'Pixar', 'could', 'mix', 'flying', 'house', 'old', 'man', 'boy', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'ingenuity', 'writers', 'story', 'UP', 'could', 'be', 'directed', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'nutshell', 'story', 'being', 'young-at-heart.Carl', 'Fredericksen', 'Ellie', 'meet', 'children', 'seeking', 'adventure', 'want', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'hero', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'place', 'South', 'America', 'called', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'Muntz', 'figure', 'based', 'explorers', 'past', 'reminded', 'Lost', 'World', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'Muntz', 'found', 'kind', 'lost', 'world', 'where', 'bird', 'not', 'found', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Scientists', 'scoff', 'Muntz', 'skeleton', 'bird', 'forgery', 'explorer', 'prove', 'himself.As', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'years', 'go', 'have', 'use', 'adventure', 'money', 'other', 'things', 'get', 'older', 'do', ""n't"", 'loose', 'sight', 'adventure', 'never', 'manage', 'do', 'watch', 'opening', 'minutes', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'grow', 'older', 'Ellie', 'become', 'ill', 'dies', 'own', 'Carl', 'neighborhood', 'changes', 'so', 'home', 'boxed', 'high-rise', 'buildings', 'When', 'Carl', 'consigned', 'retirement', 'home', 'decided', 'take', 'different', 'course', 'adventure', 'had', 'been', 'putting', 'off.Carl', 'character', 'curmudgeonly', 'old', 'man', 'forced', 'change', 'inadvertently', 'Russell', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'Scout', 'adventure', 'When', 'Carl', 'destination', 'challenged', 'very', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'who', 'inspired', 'adventure', 'choice', 'save', 'rare', 'bird', 'Muntz', 'been', 'trying', 'capture', 'decades', 'personal', 'glory', 'let', 'Muntz', 'take', 'bird', 'making', 'decision', 'Carl', 'back', 'caring', 'person', 'had', 'been', 'wife.The', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'brought', 'life', 'Carl', 'voiced', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'did', 'remind', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'square', 'jaw', 'busy', 'eyebrows', 'off', 'lovable', 'hard', 'exterior', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'made', 'effective', 'villain', 'single-minded', 'determination', 'get', 'bird', 'Then', 'also', 'are', 'Muntz', 'faithful', 'dogs', 'who', 'have', 'ability', 'talk', 'provide', 'lot', 'comedy', 'chubby', 'Russell', 'endearing', 'character', 'stance', 'what', 'right', 'wrong.I', 'have', 'read', 'criticism', 'Up', 'Carl', 'Muntz', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'are', 'taking', 'impossible', 'house', 'float', 'thousands', 'balloons', 'dogs', 'flying', 'airplanes', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'essence', 'story', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'delighted', 'least', 'occasion', 'impossible', 'allow', 'little', 'fantasy', 'lives', 'then', 'are', 'poorer', 'guys', 'Pixar', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'life', 'possibilities']",N/A

1209391,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B001KVZ6FW,Deborah Earle,"[1, 2]","This 2009 flick is Pixar's most imaginitive film to date.In the 1930s, a wide-eyed lad with glasses, flight goggles, and a helmet over them named Carl Fredericksen(Jeremy Leary)sits before a movie screen in a cinema full of equally awed viewers, watching a newsreel featuring his personal hero, aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz( Christopher Plummer)have his career chronicled in an episode ending with his discreditation over a discovery he claimed to have made.Muntz vows never to return from the jungles of South America until he can prove his discovery valid.Upon leaving the theatre, Carl's young life skips merrily along, until, to his great surprise, he meets the wild, red-haired Ellie(Elie Docter), with whom the staid and quiet young boy shares a passion for flight, and develops a desire to travel to Pardise Falls in South America, since Charles Muntz is her personal hero, as well.Eventually, they grow up, and marry to the delight of Ellie's boisterous backwoods family, and Carl's elegantly staid family.They go directly to their dream house, the old boarded-up cottage where they used to pretend they were exploring in a dirigible.Over the years, Carl is employed as a balloon vendor at a local zoo, where Ellie works as a guide.In their spare time, they picnic on a hill and describe what they see in the clouds.After learning that Ellie cannot have children, Carl brings her out of her depression by reminder her of her dream to visit South America, and they begin saving for it. Their dream is waylaid by unforseen expenses, and Life's calamities.Life continues, and they grow old together. Sadly Ellie passes away  before their dream can be fullfilled.Carl retired to the house he and Ellie shared. But things will not be quiet for very long.The city literally begins to spring up around the Frederickson's cottage. Danny Mann's construction worker, Steve, working on behalf of his foreman, Tom(John Ratzenberger), unsuccessfully tries for the umpteenth time to buy the property.At the same time, a Junior Wilderness explorer named Russell( Jordan Nagai), arrives at Carl's door, hoping to acquire his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge.Carl declines the offer, and diverts the boy.Legal trouble results in Carl's being committed to an assisted living home. Two male nurses(Donald Fullilove, and Jess Harrell) arrive to escort him to his new home.But guided by Ellie's spirit, he trumps them all by releasing a mountain of balloons tied to the roof of his house, which pull the house away from its moorings, to the astonishment of the nurses, of a little girl playing in her bedroom in her apartment  highrise, whose world is momentarily but gloriously bathed in an array of colors by the balloon's reflections, and by sundry townspeople.""We're on our way, Ellie!"" Carl solemnly declares as he steers the flying wooden vessel, making his late wife's childhood imaginings a reality.He is given an unexpected companion  for the journey. Young Russell was caught on the porch when the voyage began, and while Carl is initially reluctant to let him in, the chatty lad is soon given a chance to earn his badge for assisting the elderly in a way he never expected.They reach South America with a thunderous jolt, and manage to tie themselves to the floating house as they explore the jungle.They encounter a rainbow colored flightless bird, whom Russell entices with chocolate and names ""Kevin"", and a mysterious dog with a talking collar named Dug (Bob Peterson). Once again, curmudgeonly Carl accepts the company of both, only reluctantly.But the companionship of both will be invaluable.The old man and the boy form a bond during their adventure. The widowered septegenarian learns why the young scout is in need of a father figure who will stand beside him when he receives his final badge.As they doggedly approach Paradise Falls, the spot where Ellie had dreamt of having a house, since childhood, they find themselves diverted by a pack of canines, who, like Dug, have collars enabling them to talk. The most notable of these are the Doberman, Alpha( also voiced by Bob Peterson), and Beta (Delroy Lindo), a bulldog, and another dog named Gamma(Jerome Ranft).The dogs'owner, as it turns out, is Charles Muntz, and Carl is delighted to meet his boyhood hero.But Carl and Russell realize Muntz's sinister designs on Kevin and must fight to save the bird.Despite Carl's initial refusal to get involved when Kevin is seized, Russell's derring-do forces him to act, ultimately giving the phrase, ""Spirit of Adventure"" a whole new meaning.In the end, we see how a lonely widower's life is renewed after loss, and how sorrow gives way to new adventures, new hope, and new joys, if we allow it.I would give this delightful fantasy the Ellie Badge.In the final analysis, ""Up"" is simply ""Up-lifting""!",5,"Wildly Imaginitive, and Wonderful!",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,4808,"['2009', 'flick', 'Pixar', 'most', 'imaginitive', 'film', 'date.In', '1930s', 'wide-eyed', 'lad', 'glasses',

1209396,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001KVZ6FW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[12, 16]","A touching, very fun and hilarious animated film that is incredibly beautiful and highly detailed.  Disney*Pixar has once again raised the bar for quality CG animation and awesome storytelling.  ""Up"" is probably the best film thus far to come out in 2009 and a fantastic Blu-ray release from Walt Disney Studios.  There's no doubt about it, this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!From the creators of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" comes ""UP"" from Disney*Pixar.  With the yearly success of CG animated films by Disney's Pixar Animation Studio, ""Up"" is not just a film that improves upon modern CG animation, it's a clever film that manages to capture youth but also old age.  Through this film we see pain, loss, laughter, compassion through the wisdom of age but also the naivety and spontaneous side of youth.  An adventure, fantasy film that will capture your attention and make you laugh but also have you in awe of what Pixar Animation Studios was able to accomplish.""Up"" is directed by Pete Docter (writer for ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Toy Story"" films),  a screenplay co-written by Bob Peterson (""Ratatouille"", ""Finding Nemo"") and music by Michael Giacchino (""Lost"", ""Fringe"", ""Star Trek"",""Alias"", ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"").  The film has received mostly all positive reviews from film critics and the film was a box office success making over $292 million worldwide.  The film was the second highest grossing film domestically by Pixar (after ""Finding Nemo"") and the fifth highest grossing animated feature in the US of all time.And now that film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Nov. 3rd.  ""Up"" on Blu-ray is presented in a four-disc release which includes a Blu-ray Disc, a second Blu-ray Disc with the special features, a DVD copy of the film and a Digital Copy of the film.The film first introduces us to a young Carl Fredricksen who is watching his idol, the famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer, ""The Insider"", ""Nicholas Nickelby"", ""A Beautiful Mind"") who brings back the skeleton of a 13 ft. bird that he found in South America. Of course, because this bird is a species not known to man, scientist calls the bones as fake and Muntz then decides to leave back to South America and to prove people wrong, he would return with the living bird and won't return until he finds it.For young Carl, Muntz was his hero and he would wear his pilot goggles and carry a balloon that would say ""Spirit of Adventure"" named after the flying vehicle that Muntz rides.  But Muntz is also the hero of a girl named Ellie.  Both kids love adventure and meet each other in a rundown house which they call their club house.We then see Carl and Ellie as children and later become young adults who marry and renovate the run down club house to be an actual home.  Ellie's dream and her passion for adventure is to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America and Carl makes his promise to her that he will make it happen.As they grow older, each time they save money for their trip to Paradise Falls, they run into financial situations in which they have to dip into their savings.  Since Carl makes a living as a balloon vendor, they enjoy a simple life and live in the same house, still in love with each other.  But as time has passed for both Carl and Ellie, by the time they are ready to go on their trip, the two have become very old and eventually, Ellie passes away.Now older Carl (voice by Edward Asner, ""Lou Grant"", ""Mary Tyler Moore"") is alone, an angry recluse and feels that he has nothing to live for with his wife gone.  His home is all he has and it's his constant memory of his love for Ellie.  But his home is now in an area where commercial buildings are being built and the construction company has tried to buy his home but since it's his memory of Ellie, Carl refuses.  Meanwhile, a Wilderness Explorer, a boy named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) needs his final merit badge and to achieve that, he needs to to ""assist the elderly"".  Russell is a talkative young boy, a bit much for Carl and Carl sends him off to hunt a snipe.One day, a vehicle of the construction company smashes into his mailbox that he and Ellie painted together and Carl is so much in rage that he beats the construction worker in the head and leads him to bleed.  He goes into court and is ordered to move into the Shady Oaks Retirement Home.On the day he is to leave his home and start his new life at the retirement home, Carl unleashes his plan by using all his balloons which takes his home out of the ground and flies off and literally avoiding from him to separate himself from the home that he and Ellie had lived in for decades.  His goal is to make good with that promise he made to Ellie and that is to move their home to Paradise Falls in South America.All seems good for Carl, until he receives a knock on the door and realizes that young Russell was snipe hunting on the porch all this time.  Thus Carl is shocked that his plans may be thwarted because he has a child with him.Carl and Russell end up in South America where they  meet a very tall bird which Russell names it ""Kevin"" and also meet up with a dog named Dug who is able to talk (due to a neck collar that allows speech) who seems to be hunting for the bird for his master.  The four end up being on an adventure through tough terrain in South America.  Why is Dug after Kevin?  Why is Kevin needing the help of Carl and Russell?  And who is the original master of Dug who built the talking collar?  But most of all, will Carl be able to keep his promise to Ellie by bringing the house to Paradise Falls?VIDEO & AUDIO:""Up"" is an audio and visual treat.  Presented in 1080p (1:78:1), Disney*Pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film, literally I was floored by how incredible this film looks.  From the moment I saw the CG skin of Carl, the detail of the clothing, of leather, the detail inside the home of Carl and Ellie, the detail on the plants, the rocks, the sky, you name it...""Up"" is an incredible looking film on High Definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again.By watching how the creative arts group at Pixar actually went up high into the Tepui mountains, saw all the rock formations for themselves, a chance to embrace, draw and see how things are in the area but also see how Paradise Falls looks in reality, definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of ""Up"" was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes.  From the flowers, the plants, the unusual rock formations, the sky and weather conditions, the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again, so much detail... I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks.There are also details in the way Russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement, the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs, the slobber of the dogs.  Just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more!  There is just a lot of well-thought out details that come along with the film and you just can't help but be impressed.Picture quality is absolutely fantastic!  Walt Disney Studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on Blu-ray and the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and dark but again, the sheer amount of detail is just incredible.  No compression, no banding.  If there was a film that I can easily classify as ""reference quality"", ""Up"" is definitely a film I would put high up there.As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 and 2.0 DTS-HD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby).  The film also sounds incredible.  From the dogs barking all around you, the sound of the weather around South America, the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film.  Sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels.  The film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of LFE usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks.This is definitely a film that sounds incredible on Blu-ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive.  Overall, this is a soundtrack that has its immersive moments but what captures your attention and what sets the mood is the beautiful soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino.  The beautiful music that captures that feel of yesteryear is just amazing.As for subtitles, subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.The DVD features video in widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 Televisions.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 Surround Sound.  Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES""Up"" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p (1:78:1) for all bonus material on both Blu-ray discs, audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital (also, in French and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital) and English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles:DISC 1:* Audio Commentary by Director Pete Docter and Co-Director Bob Peterson.

The film does a great job of balancing his story, his emotions of trying to keep Ellie's memory alive through his home, while Russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters, total opposites together and trying to make things work.But what I found touching is that initial first 10-15 minutes of the film and seeing Carl and Ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life.  The inability to have a child, to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors.  One thing that the Pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also, an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of Russell.There are some deep things that happen in the film, circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults, these emotions that touch you profoundly.  Of course, a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between Carl and Ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child, Russell and the old man Carl together and having to work together, despite Carl getting a bit annoyed by Russell's youth and non-stop talking and moving.But it's the pacing set by the screenwriters that work.  The film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout.  The humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept.  And again, the film never gets boring.  It's just an exciting and fun ride when both Carl and Russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending.And the fun doesn't stop there.  This Blu-ray release is packed.  Four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the Pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere.  That was great to see.  But also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game.  And of course, a DVD for those long commutes and a digital copy as well.As for the PG rating, this is the second Pixar animated film to get the rating since ""The Incredibles"" and mainly its because of the action sequences.  Those sequences are not scary at all and I watched the film with my six-year-old.  If anything, he was asking questions which related to Carl and Ellie's marriage (parts which relate to a scene in which Carl and Ellie are unable to have children and the scene where Carl is mourning after Ellie's passing).""Up"" is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults.  The film is mature enough for adults to appreciate, enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively, fun and exciting for children to enjoy.  Definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year thus far.  Overall, ""Up"" is absolutely magnificent and this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Another magnificent Disney/Pixar release.

I try not to spoil the movie plot in my reviews, so this may not be as thorough as some, but sometimes discovering details for yourself is half the fun.It's a sweet movie... surprising, in some parts... that has character moments everyone in your family can relate to.  It deals with lost love, growing old, being a child, childhood adventure, and family.  If you're a dog lover, you will have something that appeals to you too.This movie can be heart-breaking, at times.  I know in the theater I misted up in three separate parts, and viewing the DVD at home does not change the pathos of those moments.  Your experience may vary.  As a woman starting the last stretch of the road towards fifty years of age, and the mother of two children, though, there was a lot in this movie I could relate to.In the end, you are rewarded for all the teary bits, I promise.

1209406,A3R38F596RB869,B001KVZ6FW,"D. Kendrick ""Music Man Movie Dan""","[1, 1]","I'm always keen to see the Pixar films. For me (and my girlfriend), they are the pinnacle of 3D animation films. All people involved seem to understand that the animation side is secondary to character development and depth. Although I enjoy 3D animated films from other studios (Sony, Dreamworks etc), they always seem to fall into the typecast bucket.For example: token black guy/girl who says things like ""That's what I'm talking about"", or ""You can't touch this"" etc etc, whether they're a hippo, a zebra or a mammoth. Then there's the central annoying white guy/girl, who usually does something to annoy all his/her friends, and ends up redeeming his/her self. And at the end there's always the obligatory terrible dance tune like ""I like to move it move it"".

However, my attitude quickly changed. This is truly a movie for people of all ages. And it contains a number of important messages. First, take advantage of your relationships while you have them, for nothing on this earth is permanent, as Carl discovers when Ellie, his wife, dies and they have never fulfilled their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. Probably every one of us have wished that we could have done something with a spouse, a parent, a child, or even a close friend who we will never see again. Second, age is no barrier when it comes to establishing a close bond, as Carl finds out when he and Russell befriend each other. Russell is a boy scout in need of a father figure. And Carl, who by now is a crotchety old man and is initially resistant to Russell, finds in him the companion with whom he will finally journey to Paradise Falls, albeit in a rather unconventional way (as he, Russell, and his entire house are carried by hundreds of balloons to their destination). Finally, don't give up your dream. Some day it will be fulfilled, even if it is in a way you never suspect.This has turned out to be one of my favorite films.

That, in a nutshell, is the story behind this movie.We've come to expect from Pixar to deliver movies that impress us with technologically advanced animation and uplift us with characters and interesting and novel storyline. In that regard ""Up"" is a worthy successor to all the previous Pixar feature movies. The technical brilliance of the animation is, as always, amazing, and the attention to details in every scene is simply astounding. The human characters are realistic mostly in terms of their personality, and it is to Pixar's credit that they are not trying to simulate actual human form in all of its details.

1209415,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001KVZ6FW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[216, 234]","Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie. But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful animated movies like ""Up,"" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little story about loss and love.As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their ""clubhouse"" together, and lived a long, sadly childless life together. When Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't going quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away toward South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge.And the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (""I am jumping on you, bird!""), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.Industry experts were babbling about how ""Up"" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (""Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything."" ""Cool! My mom loves that game!"") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing he's clinging to the past. Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, chattery Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (""I hid under your porch because I love you"") and act the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.The two-disc edition is going to have some very nice extras, but once again people with regular-def DVDs are going to get shafted because the Blu-ray edition will have a bunch of exclusive stuff. Grr. As for this one, there's a digital copy, the director's audio commentary, kinda-alternate-ending ""The Many Endings of Muntz,"" and the documentary ""Adventure Is Out There"" about the research for this movie.There are also a pair of adorable animated shorts. ""Partly Cloudy"" has a much-abused stork having to deliver potentially harmful baby creatures from a kind but clueless cloud. And ""Dug's Special Mission"" is a sort of backstory for the adorable Dug, explaining what the heck he was doing before he met up with Carl and Russell.""Up"" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy.

1209417,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001KVZ6FW,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious asRatatouilleor last year'sWall-E, but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer (The Sound of Music) has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, ""Partly Cloudy"", a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to onscreen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film.",5,Human-Sized Pixar Adventure Impressively Balances Character Depth and Genuine Thrills,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,4448,"['have', 'admit', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'took', 'immediate', 'personal', 'liking', 'Pixar', '2009', 'sure-fire', 'contribution', 'box', 'office', 'Emeryville', 'studio', 'impressive', 'computer-generated', 'artistry', 'reflecting', 'most', 'dependable', 'cash', 'cow', 'industry', 'first', 'unique', 'casting', 'Asian', 'lead', 'character', 'cherubic', 'hyper-curious', 'nine-year-old', 'Japanese-American', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'stowaway', 'named', 'Russell', 'second', 'reference', 'Fenton', 'Creamery', 'two-minute', 'walk', 'former', 'home', 'Oakland', 'Beyond', 'two', 'points', 'surprisingly', 'mature', 'sometimes', 'melancholy', 'comedy', 'adventure', '78-year-old', 'protagonist', 'self-proclaimed', 'destiny', 'visit', 'mythical', 'place', 'wife', 'have', 'dreamed', 'ever', 'first', 'met', 'kids', 'start', 'moaning', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'exotic', 'animals', 'talking', 'dogs', 'acts', 'aerial', 'derring-do', 'miscellaneous', 'Indiana', 'Jones-type', 'thrills', 'counterbalance', 'film', 'more', 'sentimental', 'moments.Co-directed', 'scripted', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'movie', 'Great', 'Depression', 'when', 'young', 'shy', 'boy', 'named', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'tomboyish', 'Ellie', 'abandoned', 'house', 'turned', 'clubhouse', 'discover', 'are', 'aspiring', 'adventurers', 'who', 'dream', 'meeting', 'intrepid', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'F.', 'Muntz', 'going', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'South', 'America', 'impressively', 'executed', 'montage', 'watch', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'grow', 'up', 'get', 'married', 'grow', 'old', 'together', 'When', 'Ellie', 'away', 'Carl', 'solitary', 'curmudgeon', 'unwilling', 'sell', 'home', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'met', 'Ellie', 'high-rises', 'being', 'built', 'unexpected', 'altercation', 'construction', 'worker', 'accidentally', 'over', 'Carl', 'mailbox', 'Forced', 'move', 'retirement', 'home', 'plan', 'tie', 'thousands', 'helium-filled', 'balloons', 'dazzling', 'effect', 'house', 'float', 'away', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'What', ""n't"", 'count', 'appearance', 'Russell', 'porch', 'early', 'flight', 'together', 'face', 'series', 'adventures', 'involving', 'large', 'flightless', 'bird', 'iridescent', 'colors', 'searching', 'chicks', 'lovable', 'golden', 'retriever', 'named', 'Dug', 'who', 'thoughts', 'way', 'voice-activating', 'collar', 'Muntz', 'who', 'become', 'Captain', 'Nemo-like', 'figure', 'deep', 'jungle', 'massive', 'zeppelin.There', 'refreshing', 'emotional', 'economy', 'story', 'why', '96-minute', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ambitious', 'last', ""year'sWall-E"", 'same', 'time', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'dilemmas', 'presented', 'feel', 'so', 'human-sized', 'Even', 'film', 'more', 'formulaic', 'second', 'half', 'limited', 'perspective', 'main', 'character', 'rudder', 'feel', 'key', 'difference', 'other', 'more', 'populated', 'Pixar', 'confections', 'vocal', 'work', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'perfectly', 'Carl', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'reveal', 'vulnerability', 'Nine-year-old', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'right', 'energetic', 'bounce', 'Russell', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Sound', 'Music', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'various', 'shades', 'Muntz', 'Peterson', 'stellar', 'vocal', 'work', 'Dug', 'squeaky-voiced', 'Alpha', 'German', 'shepherd', 'leader', 'dog', 'pack', 'Younger', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'bored', 'film', 'more', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'even', 'idea', 'cheering', 'septuagenarian', 'more', 'patient', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'rewarded.The', '2009', 'DVD', 'chock', 'full', 'extras', 'beginning', 'obligatory', 'short', 'preceded', 'screenings', 'movie', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'charming', 'concoction', 'clouds', 'fancifully', 'give', 'birth', 'animals', 'five-minute', 'short', 'focuses', 'Dug', 'misadventures', 'Several', 'pieces', 'deal', 'individual', 'components', 'film', 'instance', 'character', 'development', 'inception', 'onscreen', 'character', 'how', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'house', 'evolved', 'how', 'balloons', 'Muntz', 'zeppelin', 'came', 'being', 'are', 'alternate', 'endings', 'dealing', 'what', 'do', 'Muntz', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'backstory', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'interesting', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'visit', 'Tepuis', 'Mountains', 'South', 'America', 'research', 'film', 'overall', 'design', 'storyline', 'piece', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'score', 'various', 'trailers', 'film']",N/A

And adults will be reaching for the tissue box.  So this is a movie I see both adults and kids liking.The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars (that was a hard thing to do since I loved this movie so much) was because it was slow moving at parts and the whole villain with attack dogs didn't quite work for me for some reason.

The old man does eventually ""realize to live life"" but seeing as how he had a long, beautiful life to start with... it made no sense at all that he was as grumpy and rotten as he was to begin with.

Yearning for her. And on. Yearning! I don't see this as appropriate for anyone under the age of say, 13, and I can't imagine anyone at 13 would want to sit through that.THEN. There is no plot.SLIGHT SPOILER:So this old man wants to move his house to the top of this waterfall to achieve the childhood dream his dead wife never got to see fulfilled. He takes this dream quite literally and moves the actual house to the waterfall... amazingly he gets to South America in a blink of an eye and a storm.... only to magically be at the waterfall but not quite close enough... so he wants to drag the house to the other side of the canyon to get to  the exact position... and so he moves the house... and he moves the house... and this is the plot... the house, moving the house, getting the house just right... seriously?There are obstacles that come between him and moving the house to the exact position he wants it in.He also inexplicably moves in and out of jungle even though the landscape is shown to be a huge, rocky ledge.Oh then there's the villain who is somehow still quite active and alive?... considering he must be over a century old. He also has been sitting in the jungle for oh, 60 years at least, and has had access to lots of fancy gidgets and wizmos and serves gourmet food.I give it 2 stars for being colorful.

1209444,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B001KVZ6FW,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[6, 12]","The story goes that whenToy Storywas first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.The rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.The beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.The first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.  Will a persistentDennisfinally melt Mr. Wilson's icy heart?...  Uh, that is, will a persistent Russell finally melt Mr. Fredericksen's icy heart?  Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?Do you really have to ask?The second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning shortFor the Birds.  This produces lots of funny jokes, but at the expense of any remaining plausibility,...and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embitteredCaptain Nemo, a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.  This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.Finally, this movie gets an ""F"" for its understanding of the problems ofCryptozoology.  As a practical matter, in order to protect a rare and endangered animal you first have to prove that it exists, and that ultimately requires a specimen.  If you can bring it in alive, so much the better, but bring it in you must.  As one by no means heartless or cruel scientist investigating Bigfoot put it, we need a body.  The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.

Toy Story: When Buzz realizes he's a toy and can't cope with it, and when Woody admits that he should be strapped to the rocket and not buzz. A Bugs Life: When Flick is ran out of town because everyone finds out the HERO bugs were just circus bugs. Toy Story 2: When Jesse tells her story about a girl who loved her but then gave her away because she was to old. Monsters Inc.:(the best one before UP) When Sully has to bring boo back to where she came from, and when he finally sees her again after a couple of years. Finding Nemo: The opening scene, when Dory and Marlin are splitting up, and when Nemo and Marlin finally see each other again. The Incredibles: Can't remember any sad moments in that movie unfortunately. Cars: When Lightning helps the old Vet get across the finish line, and when Lightning finally falls for Route 66. Ratatouille: Can't remember anything unfortunately and I never saw WALL-E because my friend told me how boring it actually was. So now is the review.This was probably the best Pixar movie hands down. I have never seen a movie that was so perfect in everything. Even the pre movie  that Pixar does was perfect. So the plot is that a man named Mr. Fredrickson is a guy who people think he would never be on an adventure. That is until one day a million balloons come out of the house and he starts floating off to S. America. Unfortunately he brings a cub scout named Russel along for the ride. There are many adventures the duo goes through along the way, from finding a rare bird, to meeting a talking dog. They go through everything. Here is why though the movie is one of the best ever. It is the most emotional and heart warming movie anyone will ever see. The emotional scenes are countless and they really are tear jerkers from the start. Like the background on why Mr. Fredrickson never leaves his house, when some guy nearly sets the house on fire by Charles Muntz (you'll find out who he is in the movie), The badge Russel gets, and the ending on where the house lands up. However there is one scene though that literally made everybody... and I mean everybody start crying in the theater which is extremely rare for any movie to do(For anyone that did see the movie I think you know which scene I'm talking about.)I have to commend everyone that worked on this film. It really was the perfect 4 star movie. In fact it's so good that it's a shame that the Academy won't vote this for best picture(trust me it was that good.) So if you are thinking about seeing this movie... then you should definately see this movie.

1209455,AB2G52VQUY8PZ,B001KVZ6FW,"G. G. Decker ""colonelrambo396""","[5, 25]","Well, everybody has to jump the shark sometime, right? The A-Team had Stockwell, MASH had Alan Alda as a director, Firefly had the entire fourth disc (The last four episodes have their moments, but let's be honest: They're not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs. The Bounty Hunter and the Brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event.).And Pixar has Up. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.Savvy credit-watchers will note that Up does not boast the involvement of John Lasseter at all, and Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird except in the role of ""Executive Producers."" ""Executive Producer"" is a Hollywood term that means ""I'll give you some money and take the credit for your success, but I'm not doing any work.""This is understandable. Lasseter, Stanton and Bird have been practically living in the studio since Toy Story. They have families, and they've made a pile of money. I don't blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids. Unfortunately, like Jim Henson's death, they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable.Like all Pixar movies, Up is technically impressive. The visuals are stunning in some places, and the animation is exquisite (whoever researched the dogs earned his money.) Unlike Pixar movies, however, the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely. It's like a Dreamworks movie got lost and Pixar kidnapped it. (Hey-yoh!)There are a lot of things wrong with the movie, but I think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy. Every other Pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird had for something. Toys and Finding Nemo were about their kids. Cars was about their parents. Ratatouille was about their own passion for creation. No matter what the movie, either Bird or Stanton (or both) were speaking through the main characters. It's why the movies were so good, why the characters rang so true. They were honest.The creative heads behind Up not only fail to empathize with the main character, they don't even seem to like him at all. Let's have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie.1) He meets the love of his life in a decrepit, run-down old house, and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm. (They later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple)2) He marries the love of his life, and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren. (I say ""apparent"" because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel.)3) During the musical montage, they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring, but on three occasions, they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies.4) During the musical montage, the main character buys plane tickets to the Amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement.5) But before he can present the tickets to her, she has a heart attack and dies. During the musical montage.6) The neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial. Surrounded by glass and steel monoliths, he is the last holdout and won't sell to the developer.7) A construction worker backs over his mailbox, which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage, and though well meaning won't let the old man repair it himself.8) The old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who wouldn't let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane.9) The old man flies his house to the Amazon, following the footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared, and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place.10) Only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him.So in the course of the movie, he loses his wife, his house, and his childhood hero. But it's all okay because he helped a small, annoying kid rescue a large, annoying bird.Furthermore, nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all. The land developers won't listen to him. The guys from the old folk's home won't listen to him. The annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the Amazon won't listen to him. His childhood hero won't listen to him. The talking dog, who is the lone bright spot in the movie, won't listen to him. The only person in the movie who gave a rat's rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes.His character isn't even well written. When we initially meet him, he's shy. Almost timid. Under his wife's influence, he's happy. But after her death, he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7, Asner variant. Sure, his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers, but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that I can't help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching Abe Vigoda and Wolford Brimley movies. Memo to Pixar: Not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky.And he's not the only character who's taken directly from the Saturday Morning TV School of Character Stereotypes. The other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his ""helping the elderly"" merit badge. He's your standard annoying, wise-beyond-his-years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways. At one point, the kid is talking about his estranged father (Aww! He lacks a father figure. And look! The main character lacks a son! I wonder where this is going...) he remarks that what he really remembers is the little, boring, everyday stuff that he did get to do, not the big, important stuff that he didn't. That thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster. Pardon me while I gag myself with a screwdriver.The villains aren't particularly fleshed out either. The land developer has no dialog, and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness (lessness... lessness... lessness.) I won't harp on him, because he's not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain, though I will point out that Pixar has done the Corporate Villain so much better in both Monster's Inc and The Incredibles.The other villain, which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention, is the main character's childhood hero. A celebrated explorer, he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the Amazon rainforest. He sets out for the rainforest, vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he's not a liar. When we find him next, he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press, but downright bat-guano insane. It is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer/archaeologist/botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory.The main problem with the villain is that the writers think that ""bat-guano-insane"" is a substitute for personality. Every other villain in a Pixar movie has had human motivations, and has been sympathetic to some degree. Even the Aussie dentist in Finding Nemo was more clueless than evil. This guy is just completely inhuman, and not in the ""I believe what I was programmed to believe"" way that the Wheel was in Wall-E. He's just... one-dimensional. It's like someone said ""Oh, let's just make him a hunter who kills people. That's good enough, right?"" and everyone just nodded.The one character, or group of characters, that are well written and fully realized are the dogs. The villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command, and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into English. This opens up the inevitable ""I would like that ball!"" and ""SQUIRREL!"" jokes that actually work. They're the only thing in the movie that does.I'd be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie wasn't taken whole cloth from the clich&eacute; factory as well. The whole denouement is so laughably derivative I would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they weren't taking themselves so seriously. The villain sets the main character's house on fire as a distraction, because the main character is defending the large bird. Seeing his whole life go up in flames, the old man rushes to extinguish the flames, leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird. How the main character was supposed to stop the villain, who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun, isn't discussed. But the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go.After the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving (+1), the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place. And he does it, by jiminy. The house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home.But it's all hollow. We know this, because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music, and the color scheme is just slightly muted, even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment. All that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression, only to turn away in disgust at what he had become. And quite frankly, I'm not altogether certain he didn't. By this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much I'm sure I missed some things.When the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself, the main character finally ""gets it."" He expunges the house of everything inside, so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more. The last we see of the furniture, as the house flies away, is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife's chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward. (Yeah! You dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife. Forget her, it's time to go save some kid you don't know and a bird you don't like!) He chases after the villain, who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below. The villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the ""I threw my back out"" joke that was so much better in The Incredibles. See, it's funny because they're both so old. Also old people smell like prunes.Seriously. That's how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain's airship. They smell prunes. They couldn't even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word ""liniment.""Needless to say, the kid is rescued. The villain was dispatched through the use of a high-fall the likes of which I haven't seen since I watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999.Finally, we're treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge, with the main character standing by his side because the kid's father couldn't be there (all together now: Awwww!) and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars, just like the kid used to do with his dad (and again: Awwwwww!) and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded, or at least it's unenforceable because he now lives in the villain's airship.Oh, and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago, the last we see of the house, it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it. What a coincidence.I suppose Up was an accurate enough title for the movie, given the infatuation with flight. But if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it ""Trite.""That's not something I ever thought I'd be able to say about a Pixar movie. Usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice. This one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber.I have more complaints, like about how this movie is a violent departure from Pixar's classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion, and the fact that it's not only okay, but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects. Heck, if the people who made Up had done Cars, the residents of Radiator Springs would just pack up and move to California, because it's just a road, right? Move on.But I'm running long, so I won't. In conclusion, I just want to say that I will no longer buy a Pixar movie on DVD just because Pixar did it. It was my last vestige of fanboy mentality, and Up snuffed it out. I don't know whether I should be angry or grateful.",1,Pixar jumps the shark,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,13415,"['Well', 'everybody', 'jump', 'shark', 'sometime', 'right', 'A-Team', 'had',

The film loses its way a bit in the 2nd half.  The dialogue isn't the greatest, especially among the talking dogs.

His Wilderness Explorer motif is perfect.  I love that huge, ultra prepared backpack!

UP is Pixar's tenth animated feature film and I would say that it's among the studio's best, except that each of its pictures tends to rank pretty much right up there. And it's looking more and more like there's no end in sight concerning Pixar's run of awesome. (Rumor has it that John Lasseter, Pixar's head honcho, once broke wind and it smelled like dandelions on a gorgeous summer day.)While on the surface still very much geared towards kids' sensibilities, UP trots out some fairly mature adult themes. If the first twelve minutes of UP don't at least choke you up, then you are a soulless cyborg. The opening act is a nearly dialogue-less montage, and it encapsulates the life of a man. This segment is absolutely key to setting up the rest of the story, makes you root for the old cranky, creaky gent Carl Fredricksen. The stuff that he goes thru, the sadness that crushes him, the dreams and hopes that get dashed because life simply got in the way - you know exactly why he goes on to do what he does. Which is sail away in his house strung up on thousands of balloons.You'd have to be an utter grinch to bring up the slovenly physics involved, so let's not. Hundreds of feet up in the air, Mr. Fredricksen hears a knock on his door. Bemused, he opens it and sees Russell cowering on his porch. Russell is a tubby eight-year-old wilderness scout, and he's enthusiastic and, if I'm brutally honest, borderline annoying. The kid needs to earn his Assisting the Elderly badge and he's set his eyes on Mr. Fredricksen. We learn eventually that Russell's overeagerness may be his way of compensating for tough times at home. UP, at its core, is about these two characters and their emotional journeys and it's also about the process of, while not exactly putting the past to bed, at least moving on. Carl and Russell move on to South America (""It's like America - but South!"").UP is an extremely moving, heartbreaking picture, but it's also very funny and features several things which may make you cry out ""Adorable!"" ad nauseam. The main villain of the piece is deranged and sinister, and his assistants consist of a pack of talking dogs. Which leads me to this: I love Dug! Dug is one of the talking dogs, a rambling, whuffy Labradorish type, and he's exactly what you'd expect a lovable dog to be like. Dug isn't as clever or focused as the other dogs. He just wants to be loved, and Bob Peterson, the co-writer & co-director of the thing, comes up with the perfect voice for him. Also a neat character is Kevin the giant bird, but Kevin doesn't have a fancy collar which allows her dialogue.The animation is flawless. Why even go into it? It's Pixar.The single DVD version also comes with two riotous bonus animated shorts. ""Partly Cloudy,"" which preceded UP in the theaters, pokes holes in the bird and the bees theory. Babies instead come from clouds. ""Partly Cloudy"" tells the story of one slightly seedy-looking cloud which leans towards making the not-so-cute babies and the poor stork that has to deliver them. ""Dug's Special Mission"" is narrated thru Dug's perspective as we see the moments leading up to Dug's first meeting with Mr. Fredricksen and Russell.I like the visual twist of a house kept aloft by a gazillion balloons, and then this floating house being toted around by our characters as if it were one big balloon. Rather than chilling in the crib, Mr. Fredricksen and Russell actually spend more time outdoors tethered to the house and towing it with them. ""Adventure is out there!"" is an often mentioned motto in the movie, and our characters land themselves in a wild, exotic adventure. Fun for the kids, fun for the grown-ups, and bolstered by powerful dramatic undertones. UP is absolutely terrific and everyone should go check i--SQUIRREL!""",5,"""I do not like the cone of shame.""",1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,3861,"['Pixar', 'machine', 'so', 'many', 'feathers', 'cap', 'now', 'Vegas', 'showgirl', 'UP', 'Pixar', 'tenth', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'studio', 'best', 'pictures', 'rank', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'there', 'looking', 'more', 'more', 'end', 'sight', 'concerning', 'Pixar', 'run', 'awesome', 'Rumor', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'Pixar', 'head', 'honcho', 'once', 'broke', 'wind', 'smelled', 'like', 'dandelions', 'gorgeous', 'summer', 'day', 'surface', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'sensibilities', 'UP', 'out', 'fairly', 'mature', 'adult', 'themes', 'first', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'UP', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'choke', 'up', 'then', 'are', 'soulless', 'cyborg', 'opening', 'act', 'nearly', 'dialogue-less', 'montage', 'life', 'man', 'segment', 'absolutely', 'key', 'setting', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'root', 'old', 'cranky', 'creaky', 'gent', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'stuff', 'thru', 'sadness', 'dreams', 'get', 'dashed', 'life', 'simply', 'got', 'way', 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'do', 'what', 'Which', 'sail', 'away', 'house', 'strung', 'up', 'thousands', 'balloons.You', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'utter', 'grinch', 'bring', 'up', 'slovenly', 'physics', 'involved', 'let', 'not', 'Hundreds', 'feet', 'up', 'air', 'Mr.', 'Fredricksen', 'knock', 'door', 'Bemused', 'Russell', 'cowering', 'porch', 'Russell', 'tubby', 'eight-year-old', 'wilderness', 'scout', 'enthusiastic', ""'m"", 'brutally', 'honest', 'borderline', 'annoying', 'kid', 'earn', 'Assisting', 'Elderly', 'badge', 'set', 'eyes', 'Mr.', 'Fredricksen', 'learn', 'eventually', 'Russell', 'overeagerness', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'compensating', 'tough', 'times', 'home', 'UP', 'core', 'two', 'characters', 'emotional', 'journeys', 'also', 'process', 'not', 'exactly', 'putting', 'past', 'bed', 'least', 'moving', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'move', 'South', 'America', 'America', 'South', '.UP', 'extremely', 'moving', 'heartbreaking', 'picture', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'several', 'things', 'may', 'make', 'cry', 'Adorable', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'main', 'villain', 'piece', 'deranged', 'sinister', 'assistants', 'consist', 'pack', 'talking', 'dogs', 'Which', 'love', 'Dug', 'Dug', 'one', 'talking', 'dogs', 'rambling', 'whuffy', 'Labradorish', 'type', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'lovable', 'dog', 'be', 'Dug', ""n't"", 'as', 'clever', 'focused', 'other', 'dogs', 'just', 'be', 'loved', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'co-writer', 'co-director', 'thing', 'up', 'perfect', 'voice', 'Also', 'neat', 'character', 'Kevin', 'giant', 'bird', 'Kevin', ""n't"", 'have', 'fancy', 'collar', 'dialogue.The', 'animation', 'flawless', 'Why', 'even', 'go', 'Pixar.The', 'single', 'DVD', 'version', 'also', 'two', 'riotous', 'bonus', 'animated', 'shorts', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'preceded', 'UP', 'theaters', 'pokes', 'holes', 'bird', 'bees', 'theory', 'Babies', 'instead', 'come', 'clouds', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'story', 'one', 'slightly', 'seedy-looking', 'cloud', 'towards', 'making', 'not-so-cute', 'babies', 'poor', 'stork', 'deliver', 'Dug', 'Special', 'Mission', 'narrated', 'thru', 'Dug', 'perspective', 'see', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'Dug', 'first', 'meeting', 'Mr.', 'Fredricksen', 'Russell.I', 'visual', 'twist', 'house', 'kept', 'aloft', 'gazillion', 'balloons', 'then', 'floating', 'house', 'being', 'toted', 'characters', 'were', 'one', 'big', 'balloon', 'Rather', 'chilling', 'crib', 'Mr.', 'Fredricksen', 'Russell', 'actually', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'outdoors', 'tethered', 'house', 'towing', 'Adventure', 'there', 'often', 'mentioned', 'motto', 'movie', 'characters', 'land', 'wild', 'exotic', 'adventure', 'Fun', 'kids', 'fun', 'grown-ups', 'bolstered', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'undertones', 'UP', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'everyone', 'should', 'go', 'check', 'i', 'SQUIRREL']",N/A

1209478,A2O1C9EGYQVS1K,B001KVZ6FW,hunter_aran,"[2, 4]","This is a review about the type of package you get with the Bluray. First to those who are complaining about the price... if you think that this pack is really going to sell for more than $30 on release day, you are a poor shopper. Target, Walmart and others will have a special first week discount just like they did with the Bolt Bluray/Dvd combo pack and Amazon will most likely discount it to be competitive as well. Second I think the appearance of Blurays bundled with Dvds is the best thing ever! Here is why: I am a childless adult and I love animated movies like Wall-e, Bolt, Ice Age but let's face it--they are KIDS MOVIES. MOST KIDS DO NOT HAVE A BLURAY PLAYER IN THEIR ROOM. As such, the largest audience for these movies is not going to find much use in a Bluray unless the whole family watches it in their home's entertainment center. Most parents will not buy a Bluray and instead buy a Dvd due to price and its usability as I just described. Junior is not going to drag the Bluray into his room only to find out it does not play on his Dvd player and then leave the disc it on the floor among his toys like all the other  Dvds he has collected; at least that's what parents don't want so they don't buy the Bluray. So this package is ingenious because it solves this problem and you get every possible format. I bet many would not have otherwise bought the Bluray if it did not have this Dvd addition. I wish all Blurays were packaged like this because I am always willing to pay $5-10 more than that special multi-disc Dvd edition to get this!

But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its - her actually - chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course.

Some of them like Wall-E which have dynamic animation, and others like Toy Story have a great story but might not be as visually appealing. Up manages to bring together both of these into a wonderful experience for the whole family, as well as for animation fans.The movie starts out with the young Carl Fredrickson who is a fan of the famous explorer, Charles Muntz, and through this befriends a hick girl named Ellie. They later on marry, and keep planning for their own expedition, but as the years go by the burdens of ""real life"" makes their dream go unfulfilled, and Ellie eventually dies of old age. Carl is now an old man living in his and Ellie's old dream home, which is in danger of being bought out by a large construction company. So, being a longtime balloon salesman, Carl sticks hundreds of balloons to his house and flies it to South America in the hope of leaving it on the cliff at a place called Paradise Falls. The only hiccup in this is the chubby boy scout Russell was stranded on Carl's porch when it took off, and is now along for the ride. Once in South America, they land the house on the opposite end of the plataeau that the falls are located, so Carl and Russell have to carry the house still floating by balloons to the other end like a giant parade float. They encounter an exotic flightless bird, that Russell calls Kevin, which is being chased by dogs with special collars that allow them to talk. One of the dogs is Dug who quickly befriends them. The other dogs force them to where their owner is, who turns out to be Carl's childhood hero, Muntz. He's been there this whole time ruthlessly looking for a rare bird, which is what Kevin is. Carl and Russell barely escape with Kevin's help, but Kevin gets caught by Muntz's mutts. After finally getting the house to the falls, Russell leaves Carl to go rescue Kevin. Carl eventually decides to go to by flying his house after Muntz in his giant zepplin, and despite being in probably in his 80s, Carl manages to free Kevin and Russell with Dug's help. They then hijack the zepplin and head to the States.Up was a pure delight. It took a brave move in making a senior citizen the main hero in a family adventure animated film. The first few minutes are very endearing, and really pulls you into this journey of Carl, and ultimately what he decides to do with himself now that he's nearing the end of his life.

He seems to go back and forth as to which one he likes the most. Right now it is between WALLE and the Incredibles. This was great movie to add to the pixar collection as it was really funny and dramatic. I like story telling, and this gave us a great story and an adventure to go on. My wife and I both told each other after we watched it that we couldn't wait until this one came out on DVD so our son could watch it as he is still too young to go the theater.

1209502,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B001KVZ6FW,James Horlan,"[2, 3]","I'm not sure if this is the best movie I've ever seen, but for the life of me I can't think of one better.  I'm not usually a watcher of Pixar stuff for some reason, indeed the last one I'd seen was the first Toy Story.  No good reason why that's so, I just never got around to them.  But something about the premise of Up grabbed me, so when I saw it in a used DVD bin, I snagged it.  Two watchings in two days later, and I ordered this particular Blu-Ray copy of it, after bragging about Up to anyone and everyone I came across.What's great about it?  Where do I start?  First, there's the house made of balloons.  It makes for amazing cover art, and arouses curiousity.  Petty you think?  Not really, the eye likes what the eye likes, and that's not to be discounted.  The characters for another.  Carl Frederickson isn't some to good to be true hero or precocious kid, he's a crotchety old man who actually behaves like an old man.  Go figure eh?  He doesn't look much like voice talent Ed Asner, but Asner's voice is letter perfect for the performance.  His sidekick, Russell, voiced by Jordan Nagai, acts just like a little kid would act.  He's very observant at times, but naive and obtuse a lot of the time as well, just like a real life version of Russell would be.  The two of them make for a great team, even if Carl is a little slow to grasp that.  And that's what's terrific about the roles, neither of them know everything, or instantly figure out what to do.  They have to think, and the movie shows them thinking. Not a lot of movies have the patience, or the sense, to allow its characters to think.  But Up does.  The supporting characters, like Christopher Plummer's Charles Muntz, the dog Dug, and all the rest are excellently handled as well.The highlight of the supporting characters, for me, was the young/old versions of Ellie Frederickson.  The young version is voiced by the director's daughter, and she has the right bit of spunk and adventure for the shy and callow Carl (they look to be about 8-10 years old in those scenes).  The adult version, who marries Carl, is done without a voice, and is part of the most touching montage I've ever seen on screen.  We watch 50 years of their lives in a few minutes, with no dialogue, yet it spoke volumes.  This is why the cliche ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is so relevant even today.  I think I've watched it five or six times and I still tear up during it.The computer artistry is what one expects from Pixar, even someone like me who isn't a habitual watcher of their films.  The balloon house, the airship, the dogs (don't laugh, they're a riot), all of it was done with amazing technical proficiency, and always adds to the story.But it really comes back to Carl and Russell in the end.  I cared about them, what happened to them, and more importantly what they took out of those adventures.  I've not heard anything about an Up sequel, and there's nothing on its Wikipedia page, but I would love to see another adventure with the two of them in it.  Either way, Pixar has made a fan out of me for a long time, I hope they can keep it up.Five stars",5,Magic,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,3134,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'better', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'watcher', 'Pixar', 'stuff', 'reason', 'indeed', 'last', 'one', ""'d"", 'seen', 'was', 'first', 'Toy', 'Story', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'something', 'premise', 'Up', 'grabbed', 'when', 'saw', 'used', 'DVD', 'bin', 'snagged', 'Two', 'watchings', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'ordered', 'particular', 'Blu-Ray', 'copy', 'bragging', 'about', 'Up', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'came', 'across.What', 'great', 'Where', 'do', 'start', 'First', 'house', 'made', 'balloons', 'amazing', 'cover', 'art', 'curiousity', 'Petty', 'think', 'Not', 'really', 'eye', 'what', 'eye', 'likes', 'not', 'be', 'discounted', 'characters', 'Carl', 'Frederickson', ""n't"", 'good', 'be', 'true', 'hero', 'precocious', 'kid', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'old', 'man', 'Go', 'figure', 'eh', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'voice', 'talent', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Asner', 'voice', 'letter', 'perfect', 'performance', 'sidekick', 'Russell', 'voiced', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'just', 'little', 'kid', 'would', 'act', 'very', 'observant', 'times', 'naive', 'obtuse', 'lot', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'version', 'Russell', 'would', 'be', 'two', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'even', 'Carl', 'little', 'slow', 'grasp', 'what', 'terrific', 'roles', 'know', 'everything', 'instantly', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'think', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Not', 'lot', 'movies', 'have', 'patience', 'sense', 'allow', 'characters', 'think', 'Up', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'dog', 'Dug', 'rest', 'are', 'excellently', 'handled', 'well.The', 'highlight', 'supporting', 'characters', 'was', 'young/old', 'versions', 'Ellie', 'Frederickson', 'young', 'version', 'voiced', 'director', 'daughter', 'right', 'bit', 'spunk', 'adventure', 'shy', 'callow', 'Carl', 'look', 'be', '8-10', 'years', 'old', 'scenes', 'adult', 'version', 'who', 'Carl', 'done', 'voice', 'part', 'most', 'touching', 'montage', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'watch', '50', 'years', 'lives', 'few', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'why', 'cliche', 'picture', 'thousand', 'words', 'so', 'relevant', 'even', 'today', 'think', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'still', 'tear', 'up', 'it.The', 'computer', 'artistry', 'what', 'one', 'Pixar', 'even', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'habitual', 'watcher', 'films', 'balloon', 'house', 'airship', 'dogs', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', ""'re"", 'riot', 'was', 'done', 'amazing', 'technical', 'proficiency', 'always', 'story.But', 'really', 'back', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'end', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'took', 'out', 'adventures', ""'ve"", 'not', 'heard', 'anything', 'Up', 'sequel', 'nothing', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'adventure', 'two', 'way', 'Pixar', 'made', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'hope', 'can', 'keep', 'up.Five', 'stars']",N/A

Ed Asner voice Carl Fredricksen, who takes to the skies to escape predatory commercial real estate developers, hoping to make the dream of a home in the Amazon come true. There are perils along the way of course. Too-helpful ""Wilderness Explorer"" Russell needs a ""Helping the Elderly"" merit badge to fill out his award sash. And Carl's old idol, Charles Muntz, awaits in the jungle with his pack of trained, talking dogs.Pixar serves up a great story that winds back to pick up hints laid earlier on and that cleverly uses the standard household items of the elderly - dentures, a glass money jar and a four-footed cane -- to good and often hilarious use. The quality of the animation is off the charts, as usual, and the writing is mostly good. The loss of a star is partly due to a bit of repetitive and uninspired canine dialog. But mostly it's due to making Carl, shown early on as a bad walker, perform gymnastics and daring feats (climbing up the side of a blimp, anyone?) that would be daunting for a boy a 10th his age.By the way, the 3D version of ""Up"" was neat, but didn't add much to the visual experience, After a few minutes, the 3D effect became ""normal"" and hence unnoticeable.

1209524,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B001KVZ6FW,"JJD ""John""","[0, 0]","Well..My review title may seem a bit pretentious at first, but there is a reason for that.Calling this a ""movie"" or ""kid flick"" just doesn't seem to cover the bases here. This is indeed a film in every sense of the word. Yes, it is a Pixar film, but it is far more than your average Disney fare and, to my mind, the best film Pixar has done to date.I can't begin to express the pure and raw emotion this tale evokes. If you have ever loved and lost, or known the real joy/heartache of true love, this will move you in ways you will not expect. While there are plenty of prat falls and comedy to make this a joy to watch with the kiddies, the true heart of this story is told within the first ten minutes...and it does so with very few words. To me, the heart of this film lies within the story of Carl and Ellie Fredrickson. Bonded by youth and a love for an intrepid explorer, they found each other...Carl is the shy and timid kind, where Ellie is a seemingly endless fountain of energy and enthusiasm. It is a kind hearted exploration of the human condition...and it is profound in it's simplicity.Enter Russell...Wilderness Explorer extraordinaire. He's the lad many of us were in our youth, wide eyed and naive enough to see the world as one big adventure. It's in his naivity, despite a broken home and uncaring father, that we fondly remember the rose-colored glasses of youth...and he embodies that time in our lives when it was all going to be okay.Dug is the most accurate portrayal of a dog I have ever seen on screen...animated or not. He shows the unconditional love and loyalty that we all come to expect from a perfect canine companion. I have to give kudos to the animators here, because I could see every single (yet matted) hair on him with incredibly life-like precision. His expressions and over all painted (or pixelated) enthusiasm left me wanting to reach out to the screen and give him a great big hug and a Milk Bone.The voices could not be more perfectly casted...Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz is incredible and I had to store away my images of Baron Von Trapp. Ed Asner as Carl Fredrickson may seem type-casted as the crotchety fellow..but he does it with as much panache as he conquered the role of the lovable Lou Grant. Through all of the digital computer designs and colors..you see THE MAN. Beyond that..you see the person inside of us all.I won't go into the story..as I am sure most have you have seen the film already. What I will say to those who have not, PLEASE see this film as it is my pick for the best that 2009 had to offer. I would even go so far as to say it is my personal pick as the most moving film of the decade. In a world as jaded and cynical as we live in now..this is 90 minutes of pure joy that will easily make you remember that, despite all the politics and ills of today, there truly is the capacity for warmth and love...even in a silly little ""kiddie flick"".",5,"Pixar's best ""film"" to date!!!",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2924,"['Well..My', 'review', 'title', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'first', 'reason', 'that.Calling', 'movie', 'kid', 'flick', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cover', 'bases', 'here', 'indeed', 'film', 'sense', 'word', 'Yes', 'Pixar', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'average', 'Disney', 'fare', 'mind', 'best', 'film', 'Pixar', 'done', 'date.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'express', 'pure', 'raw', 'emotion', 'tale', 'have', 'ever', 'loved', 'lost', 'known', 'real', 'joy/heartache', 'true', 'love', 'will', 'move', 'ways', 'will', 'not', 'expect', 'are', 'plenty', 'prat', 'falls', 'comedy', 'make', 'joy', 'watch', 'kiddies', 'true', 'heart', 'story', 'told', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'heart', 'film', 'story', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'Fredrickson', 'Bonded', 'youth', 'love', 'intrepid', 'explorer', 'found', 'other', 'Carl', 'shy', 'timid', 'kind', 'where', 'Ellie', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'fountain', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'kind', 'hearted', 'exploration', 'human', 'condition', 'profound', 'simplicity.Enter', 'Russell', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'extraordinaire', 'lad', 'many', 'were', 'youth', 'wide', 'eyed', 'naive', 'enough', 'see', 'world', 'one', 'big', 'adventure', 'naivity', 'broken', 'home', 'uncaring', 'father', 'fondly', 'remember', 'rose-colored', 'glasses', 'youth', 'time', 'lives', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'okay.Dug', 'most', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'dog', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'animated', 'not', 'unconditional', 'love', 'loyalty', 'come', 'expect', 'perfect', 'canine', 'companion', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'animators', 'here', 'could', 'see', 'single', 'yet', 'matted', 'hair', 'incredibly', 'life-like', 'precision', 'expressions', 'painted', 'pixelated', 'enthusiasm', 'left', 'wanting', 'reach', 'out', 'screen', 'give', 'great', 'big', 'hug', 'Milk', 'Bone.The', 'voices', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'perfectly', 'casted', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'incredible', 'had', 'store', 'away', 'images', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Carl', 'Fredrickson', 'may', 'seem', 'type-casted', 'crotchety', 'fellow..but', 'as', 'much', 'panache', 'conquered', 'role', 'lovable', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'digital', 'computer', 'designs', 'colors..you', 'see', 'MAN', 'Beyond', 'that..you', 'see', 'person', 'all.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'story..as', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'already', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'PLEASE', 'see', 'film', 'pick', 'best', '2009', 'had', 'offer', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'personal', 'pick', 'most', 'moving', 'film', 'decade', 'world', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'live', 'now..this', '90', 'minutes', 'pure', 'joy', 'will', 'easily', 'make', 'remember', 'politics', 'ills', 'today', 'truly', 'capacity', 'warmth', 'love', 'even', 'silly', 'little', 'kiddie', 'flick']",N/A

1209529,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B001KVZ6FW,J. O. Booker,"[4, 4]","Probably the best animated film this decade. Up is one of those films that makes you look at yourself, at all the promises you made to yourself that one day, that magical day, when you have enough money, when you win the lottery, when you get a break in your schedule, you're going to take that trip, treat yourself out to that nice dinner you deserve, do that thing you've always planned from the time you were bold enough to dream. Once upon a time you were a cub scout, the world was a magical place awaiting exploration. Then one day you woke up, looked in the mirror, opened your front door, and realized that you were old and all you have left are memories and old pictures of the way you used to look when you were young.This is the perfect family movie. I say this because usually when you hear the words ""family film"" it's usually a film that is very basic, basic and safe enough to take your kid to see. Rarely do you see a film that is basic enough for a kid to get into yet sophisticated enough for an adult to relate with on a level that a child who hasn't been through life's changes cannot possibly understand. Up is that type of film, about an old man holding on to the past, to an old dream, resisting the changes occurring around him. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame plays the gruff irascible Mr. Henrick who, along with a stowaway scout named Russel set out for South America's Paradise Falls by way of a cloud of colorful balloons anchored to an old house full of old dreams.The animation in this movie is very colorful, vibrant, realistic, and reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films in this respect. In fact, the characterizations in this film, particularly the part played by Asner, the main character, is downright scary at times, seems like a live action movie, not because the animation's all that, but because the emotions and humanity are so damn real and don't seem forced. This, along with another one of my favorites, Wall-E, shows why America stands heads and shoulders above everybody in this medium. Sorry went on so long but there aren't enough superlatives to say how fantastic and beautiful this film is.

Rooney,"[1, 2]","""Up"" is unusual for an animated movie because it celebrates the life and heroism of an elderly man, Carl Fredricksen, (voice by Ed Asner), a widower who fulfills his deceased wife's desire to go to Paradise Falls in South America. The movie traces the couple's meeting, their marriage, their life together, and her passing. Now in old age his house is the only one left in the middle of a big construction site. He refuses to sell the home because this was where he and wife Ellie lived.Carl is a curmudgeon like Mr. Magoo who gets himself in trouble by physically reacting to the building guys trying to buy his house. He's going to be taken away to an institution and lose his house.An eight-year-old boy, Russell a Wilderness Explorer Scout, comes to his house, hoping to earn a merit badge for assisting the elderly. The old grouch relents finally and gives the kid the make-work task of finding a bird, a snipe.The night before they're going to take him away, Carl (he had been a balloon salesman) ties his house to thousands of balloons, and it flies away to Paradise Falls. He can navigate it like a blimp. When the house got pulled away from its foundation, Russell was trapped under the porch and is now airborne with Carl.When they arrive at the Falls, Russell befriends a big rare bird, and a good dog joins them. Bad dogs with collars containing talking devices chase them led by an evil Doberman, Alpha.At the beginning of the movie we see a Carl as a boy watching a movie newsreel about his hero Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher Plummer) who flies a dirigible on his explorations. At Paradise Falls Carl meets up with the now mad Muntz, controller of the scary dogs, who wants the big bird. Carl's childhood hero has become his nemesis.Carl is resourceful and ingenious, but Russell is a klutz. As the movie progresses, the two are like action heroes performing unbelievable feats.

Its nothing terribly new and honestly I found the story itself realtively borring. I think that it could have been allot better without the annoying ADD chubby Asian kid Russell.

So I did not like the whole settings for this animation from the start. It took me a long time to even bother to watch this. And the first time, I watched here and there because of my 33 months old. He adores this movie. There are a lot of emotional ups and downs and my boy acts it out. He calls Russell baby and loves to follow what he says and how he acts. It is not an animation of 3 year old. But there is nothing that's out of ordinary that should be objected to. All are part of every day life that young and old has to confront. So far, Pixar has managed well mixing materials for young and old together well enough to be enjoyed by all groups. The Incredibles being the prime example. Story of middle aged man going through their mid-life crisis wrapped around comic characters that a whole family can enjoy. That's the mastery of Pixar's series. Younger ones that don't understand should be just ignoring the depths of the issues naturally and depth of the story is only unlocked as they ""understand"" the underlying story. That's mastery!On the second viewing, all the details of the movie grab my attention and as usual all over the movie there were subtle mastery of story telling. The old man was genuine character, not something that someone just came up with. He was someone that most of us could associate with. Russell is also one of our boy and who I once was. With all the badges earned still unsure of oneself. Through all the bravery, weak and naive and so very much a child.I see poor reviews of Pixar movies and they center around Pixar not being purely children's animation. I have a very strong objection to that type of idea. 1. I watch all Pixar movies with my boy ever since he was able to watch them. He chooses what he wants to watch. Toy Story 2, Cars, Up. I talk with him, tell him stuff. We don't quite communicate yet but he listens and ""appreciates"" the interaction. 2. Things like infertility, death and family issues, younger ones just don't understand and they will just skip those scenes naturally. It will be wrong to assume that 2-3 year old struggling with life and death and infertility questions. It's more likely the adults watching it has those questions they themselves haven't worked out with themselves. Deal with it. Pixar present them in best possible way.UP is another gift by Pixar to humanity. Thank you, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Lasseter. This is a 175 million dollar gift from them to you.

There are some moments in which it seems rushed, particularly after the duo meets their sole antagonist, but this decision ultimately helps the simple concept from compromising itself, as well as keeping the attention of youngsters (who will adore this movie, by the way).I didn't think that things could get much better with Brad Bird having helmed films such as Ratatouille and The Incredibles, and my expectations weren't terribly high after discovering the directing talent behind the movie (Pete Docter, who was partially responsible for Monsters, Inc. - the one Pixar film I found more than a little unappealing) but, alas, this absolutely superlative company has surprised me yet again.UP is hilarious, suspenseful, imaginative, and simply touching.

1209546,ARK323I3EV98D,B001KVZ6FW,Jordan D. Wilson,"[0, 0]","Time and time again, Pixar has showcased to the world their ever-growing and nearly limitless talents to the world of animated filmmaking. From Toy Story to Finding Nemo, from Monsters Inc. to Wall-E, their craft and skill has expanded and deepened, and their stories have been sealed within a generation. With their newest film Up, I believe that they have once again reached new heights (pun intended).Directed by the masterful Pete Docter, who previously wrote Wall-E, Toy Story, and who wrote and directed Monster's Inc, Up opens with the meeting of two young children named Carl and Ellie, who both want to be explorers one day. The film then transitions to what is by far the finest sequence Pixar has ever shot, showing us how these two destined souls fall in love and marry, move into their dream house, and experience hope, hardship, tragedy, and death. The opening is startlingly moving and poetic, which is due in large part it being silent, aside from a beautiful and heartbreaking score by Michael Giacchino. It is the most daring and ambitious depiction of marriage and life that I've ever seen in an animated movie.There is a flash forward, and Carl Frederickson (voiced by Ed Asner), who is now a widower, has become a cranky, impatient, and cynical old man. He has been stricken by loss and disappointment to such a great extent that on a good day, he will leave the house only to get as far as his own front porch, where he sits and watches the city he lives in grow and expand without him.After a government agency, headed by a man wearing a suit, sunglasses, and a cell phone, threatens to take Carl's house away from him and put him in a ""retirement community,"" Carl decides to finally escape. He isn't going to let anyone take Ellie's dream house away, so he ties hundreds and hundreds of helium balloons to it and sets afloat toward the legendary Paradise Falls, the place where he and Ellie's beloved hero, explorer Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), went missing decades earlier after finding the bones of a lost creature and being accused of being a fake. This is also where Ellie and Carl always dreamed of going, and Carl now seeks to fulfill that dream for her.Carl is joined on his journey by a Wilderness Explorer Scout named Russell, who is one of the finest child characters I have ever seen, mostly because, although he annoys Carl like he is supposed to, he never became tiresome to me. That is a rare thing.The action sequences that follow when Carl reaches his destination are quite entertaining, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film. Pixar's films are always very good at tickling the funny bones of both adults and children alike, and this is certainly no exception. There are dogs with faulty voice enhancing collars, a giant colorful bird-creature named Kevin who loves chocolate, and of course, Charles Muntz's beautifully crafted airship. The look of the film is dazzling, particularly the brilliant flock of balloons that carries the house across the sky. The use of color here is sublime.My girlfriend of nearly four years, Courtney, recently lost her grandmother, to whom she was very close. Her grandfather took his grandson to see Up shortly after his wife of 40 years passed away. After watching it, he called Courtney to tell her what a tremendous affect it had on him. He said that he cried many times throughout the film, and that afterwards, he felt uplifted and comforted by its message. I myself nearly fell into tears after hearing that, and the movie means more to me for it having helped him as it did.",5,Pixar Makes Me Cry,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,3596,"['Time', 'time', 'again', 'Pixar', 'showcased', 'world', 'ever-growing', 'nearly', 'limitless', 'talents', 'world', 'animated', 'filmmaking', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Wall-E', 'craft', 'skill', 'expanded', 'deepened', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'sealed', 'generation', 'newest', 'film', 'Up', 'believe', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'reached', 'new', 'heights', 'pun', 'intended', '.Directed', 'masterful', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'who', 'previously', 'wrote', 'Wall-E', 'Toy', 'Story', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Monster', 'Inc', 'Up', 'meeting', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'named', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'explorers', 'one', 'day', 'film', 'then', 'transitions', 'what', 'far', 'finest', 'sequence', 'Pixar', 'ever', 'shot', 'showing', 'how', 'two', 'destined', 'souls', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'move', 'dream', 'house', 'experience', 'hope', 'hardship', 'tragedy', 'death', 'opening', 'startlingly', 'moving', 'poetic', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'being', 'silent', 'aside', 'beautiful', 'heartbreaking', 'score', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'most', 'daring', 'ambitious', 'depiction', 'marriage', 'life', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'animated', 'movie.There', 'flash', 'forward', 'Carl', 'Frederickson', 'voiced', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'who', 'now', 'widower', 'become', 'cranky', 'impatient', 'cynical', 'old', 'man', 'been', 'stricken', 'loss', 'disappointment', 'great', 'extent', 'good', 'day', 'will', 'leave', 'house', 'only', 'get', 'as', 'far', 'own', 'front', 'porch', 'where', 'city', 'grow', 'expand', 'him.After', 'government', 'agency', 'headed', 'man', 'wearing', 'suit', 'sunglasses', 'cell', 'phone', 'take', 'Carl', 'house', 'away', 'put', 'retirement', 'community', 'Carl', 'finally', 'escape', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'anyone', 'take', 'Ellie', 'dream', 'house', 'away', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'helium', 'balloons', 'afloat', 'legendary', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'place', 'where', 'Ellie', 'beloved', 'hero', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'went', 'missing', 'decades', 'earlier', 'finding', 'bones', 'lost', 'creature', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'fake', 'also', 'where', 'Ellie', 'Carl', 'always', 'dreamed', 'going', 'Carl', 'now', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'her.Carl', 'joined', 'journey', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'Scout', 'named', 'Russell', 'who', 'one', 'finest', 'child', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'mostly', 'Carl', 'supposed', 'never', 'became', 'tiresome', 'rare', 'thing.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'follow', 'when', 'Carl', 'destination', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'Pixar', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'tickling', 'funny', 'bones', 'adults', 'children', 'alike', 'certainly', 'exception', 'are', 'dogs', 'faulty', 'voice', 'enhancing', 'collars', 'giant', 'colorful', 'bird-creature', 'named', 'Kevin', 'who', 'chocolate', 'course', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'airship', 'look', 'film', 'dazzling', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'flock', 'balloons', 'house', 'sky', 'use', 'color', 'here', 'sublime.My', 'girlfriend', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'Courtney', 'recently', 'lost', 'grandmother', 'whom', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'grandfather', 'took', 'grandson', 'see', 'Up', 'shortly', 'wife', '40', 'years', 'passed', 'away', 'watching', 'called', 'Courtney', 'tell', 'what', 'tremendous', 'affect', 'had', 'said', 'cried', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'afterwards', 'felt', 'uplifted', 'comforted', 'message', 'nearly', 'fell', 'tears', 'hearing', 'movie', 'more', 'having', 'helped', 'did']",N/A

1209550,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B001KVZ6FW,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[19, 28]","My mom and I went to see this movie.  We both loved it.  I'm 24 and her 43.  I don't think I've ever seen a Pixar movie in theaters.  After this though, I will see them all.  There should not be any spoilers here.  I will try to tell you about the movie without ruining it for anyone.Firstly, the 3D glasses are great.  I was worried they would be red and blue and ruin the look of the movie.  Well they look like regular sun glasses, and while they are grey you still see the color of the movie.  The 3D was not what I expected.  I thought it would be thing flying out at me and looking like they were coming right at me.  No no, this my friends in a 3D that I have never seen.  The pictures just looks more amazing than any movie I have ever seen.  Imagine if there was something 1000 times better looking than blu ray.  That's is what I got when watching the film.  It only added to the greatness that I felt.Now, for the movie.  One part of the movie is about a boy.  The boy turns into a man, and then a senior.  It shows you some important things that happen in the mans life.  Things that happen when he's  very young.  Then when he's older.  I will not say what happens, but this movie did make me get teary.  My mom said you forget that it's a cartoon.  Anyway, I think one part of the movie is about the man learning that there are always new things to do in life, and you can't have one thing happen and decide to give up and stop trying these things.The other part of the movie in my opinion is about a young boy.  Not the boy who is the man.  But, another boy who's a scout of some sort.  He always wants to go on adventures.  He learns a lot about what a true adventure is.  While at the same time learning how to stay safe, help others and believe in himself.The Older man has to leave his house one day.  Something he does makes this happen.  But, he does not want to leave.  For the reason that he has many memories in his house.  He decides to go to a place that he once told someone close to him he would go.  So he gets a bunch of balloons and goes!  Little does he know that the boy who is a scout is at his door!  The boy knocks and the man lets him in.  Though not a first.  The two travel to this place the man once said he would go and have a lot of adventure on the way.  Some of the things the boy does, reminds the man of the person he once knew.  In fact the person who he had promised the trip.  Maybe the boy will learn to believe in himself and the man will learn to live and to be friendly as he once was.  The two learn the things that are important from each other.  Though, they may not realize it at the time.Oh and there is also a dog who learns to have friends.  I can't forget that!What is comes down to is this.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen.  The 3D work is that which I have never seen.  It is absolutely amazing.  It will make you laugh at times.  While at the same time either making you think about something in your life or in someone you know.  I can't see anyone not enjoying this movie.  So go see it.  Tell your friends and go see it again.  Then, when your friends go see it, go again with them.",5,What an amazing movie.,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,3165,"['mom', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'loved', ""'m"", '24', '43', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'theaters', 'will', 'see', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'spoilers', 'here', 'will', 'try', 'tell', 'movie', 'ruining', 'anyone.Firstly', '3D', 'glasses', 'are', 'great', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'be', 'red', 'blue', 'look', 'movie', 'Well', 'look', 'regular', 'sun', 'glasses', 'are', 'grey', 'still', 'see', 'color', 'movie', '3D', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'thing', 'flying', 'out', 'looking', 'were', 'coming', 'right', 'friends', '3D', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'pictures', 'just', 'more', 'amazing', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Imagine', 'was', 'something', '1000', 'times', 'better', 'looking', 'blu', 'ray', 'what', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'only', 'added', 'greatness', 'felt.Now', 'movie', 'One', 'part', 'movie', 'boy', 'boy', 'man', 'then', 'senior', 'important', 'things', 'happen', 'mans', 'life', 'Things', 'happen', 'when', 'very', 'young', 'Then', 'when', 'older', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'get', 'teary', 'mom', 'said', 'forget', 'cartoon', 'Anyway', 'think', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'man', 'learning', 'are', 'always', 'new', 'things', 'do', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'happen', 'decide', 'give', 'up', 'stop', 'trying', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'young', 'boy', 'Not', 'boy', 'who', 'man', 'boy', 'who', 'scout', 'sort', 'always', 'go', 'adventures', 'lot', 'what', 'true', 'adventure', 'same', 'time', 'learning', 'how', 'stay', 'safe', 'help', 'others', 'believe', 'himself.The', 'Older', 'man', 'leave', 'house', 'one', 'day', 'Something', 'happen', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'reason', 'many', 'memories', 'house', 'go', 'place', 'once', 'told', 'someone', 'close', 'would', 'go', 'So', 'bunch', 'balloons', 'Little', 'know', 'boy', 'who', 'scout', 'door', 'boy', 'knocks', 'man', 'not', 'first', 'two', 'travel', 'place', 'man', 'once', 'said', 'would', 'go', 'have', 'lot', 'adventure', 'way', 'things', 'boy', 'man', 'person', 'once', 'knew', 'fact', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'promised', 'trip', 'Maybe', 'boy', 'will', 'learn', 'believe', 'man', 'will', 'learn', 'live', 'be', 'friendly', 'once', 'was', 'two', 'learn', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'other', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'time.Oh', 'also', 'dog', 'who', 'have', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'What', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', '3D', 'work', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'times', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'think', 'something', 'life', 'someone', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'not', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'So', 'go', 'see', 'Tell', 'friends', 'go', 'see', 'again', 'Then', 'when', 'friends', 'go', 'see', 'go', 'again']",N/A
1209551,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001KVZ6FW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","I'm not an aficionado on animated films and, truth be told, I rarely watch them. With that said, I have not seen every Pixar film, but I can tell you there's never been one I didn't like. Whenever I end up watching one I'm stunned at how many levels it succeeds on as a motion picture and it's probably not a bold statement to imply that Pixar is the most consistently reliable animation studio.The film's opening is an achievement in the animated medium simply for the emotional response it evokes from it's viewers with stark simplicity. Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children, brought together by their mutual yearning for adventure. The story of their entire relationship concluding with her death is told using no words and is handled more poignantly than it would have been in many live-action films. Carl (now voiced by Ed Asner), a balloon salesman, adjusts to life without Ellie wandering his home without purpose and frequently annoyed by the construction occurring right outside. After city officials decide to place Carl in a nursing home, he attaches a great number of balloons to his house and begins steering his floating house to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie and himself had for years dreamed of going. Of course, Russell, a young, nave Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""help a Senior citizen"" badge is standing on the porch of the floating house.The story picks up steam upon their landing, where they discover a rare bird (nick-named Kevin by Russell) that begins following them. Problem is there's a group of mysterious dogs with collars allowing them to speak tracking the bird. One of these dogs is Dug, a marvelous creation courtesy of Pixar. Dug, the comic relief of this film is an adorable, funny, sympathetic character in a film that already has more memorable characters than just about any film this year.Up is such an impressive film. It uses none of the animated film-clich&eacute;s; there is no adult innuendo, no clich&eacute;d, mass-produced characters. It's geared towards children, but will appeal to all audiences because it's really a quality film. It has truly human characters that are emotionally complex and funny. The fact that Pixar continues to create characters that are both human and sympathetic is more of an achievement in animation than 3D is.With a beautifully vivid color palette and inspired voice work by Asner, Jordan Nagai (as Russell), Bob Peterson (as Dug), and Christopher Plummer (as the film's antagonist, you'll know about him when you see the film), Up is one of those films that makes it unfortunate the Academy has a Best Animated Film category. It will more than likely win this award come Oscar-time, but Up isn't just one of the best animated films of the year it's one of the best films of the year. It succeeds on so many levels that animated films should not and most live-action films do not. It's a great animated film, yes but also just a great film, period; A stunning achievement on all levels.GRADE: A",5,A Stunning Achievement,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,2991,"[""'m"", 'not', 'aficionado', 'animated', 'films', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'rarely', 'watch', 'said', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Pixar', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Whenever', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'one', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'how', 'many', 'levels', 'motion', 'picture', 'probably', 'not', 'bold', 'statement', 'imply', 'Pixar', 'most', 'consistently', 'reliable', 'animation', 'studio.The', 'film', 'opening', 'achievement', 'animated', 'medium', 'simply', 'emotional', 'response', 'viewers', 'stark', 'simplicity', 'Carl', 'Fredericksen', 'Ellie', 'meet', 'children', 'brought', 'together', 'mutual', 'yearning', 'adventure', 'story', 'entire', 'relationship', 'concluding', 'death', 'told', 'using', 'words', 'handled', 'more', 'poignantly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'live-action', 'films', 'Carl', 'now', 'voiced', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'balloon', 'salesman', 'life', 'Ellie', 'wandering', 'home', 'purpose', 'frequently', 'annoyed', 'construction', 'occurring', 'right', 'outside', 'city', 'officials', 'decide', 'place', 'Carl', 'nursing', 'home', 'great', 'number', 'balloons', 'house', 'steering', 'floating', 'house', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'place', 'Ellie', 'had', 'years', 'dreamed', 'going', 'course', 'Russell', 'young', 'nave', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'trying', 'earn', 'help', 'Senior', 'citizen', 'badge', 'standing', 'porch', 'floating', 'house.The', 'story', 'up', 'steam', 'landing', 'where', 'discover', 'rare', 'bird', 'nick-named', 'Kevin', 'Russell', 'following', 'Problem', 'group', 'mysterious', 'dogs', 'collars', 'allowing', 'speak', 'tracking', 'bird', 'One', 'dogs', 'Dug', 'marvelous', 'creation', 'courtesy', 'Pixar', 'Dug', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'adorable', 'funny', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'already', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'just', 'film', 'year.Up', 'such', 'impressive', 'film', 'none', 'animated', 'film-clich', 'eacute', 'adult', 'innuendo', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'mass-produced', 'characters', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'will', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'really', 'quality', 'film', 'truly', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'funny', 'fact', 'Pixar', 'create', 'characters', 'are', 'human', 'sympathetic', 'more', 'achievement', 'animation', '3D', 'is.With', 'beautifully', 'vivid', 'color', 'palette', 'inspired', 'voice', 'work', 'Asner', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'Russell', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'Dug', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'film', 'antagonist', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'Up', 'one', 'films', 'unfortunate', 'Academy', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', 'category', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'win', 'award', 'come', 'Oscar-time', 'Up', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'animated', 'films', 'should', 'not', 'most', 'live-action', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'great', 'animated', 'film', 'yes', 'also', 'just', 'great', 'film', 'period', 'A', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'levels.GRADE']",N/A

Up is for everyone. It made me laugh out loud, and it made me cry.I thought it would be tough for Up to match the emotional power ofWall-E. The two Pixar films are similar in their lack of dialogue in the first act, which helps deepen the emotional impact. Up begins with Carl, a shy young boy star-struck by a famous explorer; and kookie Ellie, who has a similar obsession. The two kids become fast friends, and vow to one day travel to Venezuela. After getting married, they buy their dream home and fix it up, hoping to fill it with children. Carl and Ellie's life together from childhood through old age is depicted, silently, with delicacy and subtlety. These first 15 minutes is like a celebration of a happy marriage, and you truly feel Carl's pain when he is left alone. He sits slumped in his chair, talking to the house as if it is the missing Ellie.When developers close in on Carl's beloved home, he decides to fulfill his promise to Ellie and travel to Paradise Falls. A former balloon vendor, Carl lifts his home with hundreds of colorful balloons. Stowing away on the porch is Russell, a plump, plucky kid trying to earn a scouting badge.Later, man and boy are joined by a golden retriever who can talk with his collar, and a huge, colorful bird. Dug the dog is priceless: spot-on for every dog that ever lived, including his obsession with squirrels. Through a series of close calls and adventures, the quartet vanquishes a villain and saves the day. And Russell earns his scouting badge.In the process, Carl learns to let go of his mourning for Ellie, and live life again. When this happens, a magical thing happens. Before, Carl's craggy face is gray and monochromatic. At the moment of his transformation, Carl's face is awash in color, and he is surrounded by beautiful hues.

1209559,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B001KVZ6FW,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[3, 4]","Carl Fredricksen is a young boy enthralled by the legend of and adventures of Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), a Zeppelin flying globe trotter who has discovered a lost world in South America called Paradise Falls. Muntz is disgraced because one of his discoveries is deemed a fraud. He leaves vowing not to return until he has the living animal as proof. None of this dissuades Carl from his hero worship of Muntz. On his way home, Carl having a backyard adventures discovers a kindred soul in Ellie, a girl his age who wants to grow up to be an adventurer herself. Ellie makes Carl promise to take her adventuring to Paradise Falls, they grow up to be best friends, they marry, and get jobs but life keeps getting in the way of the adventure to Paradise Falls until a lifetime passes and Ellie dies, and the hope and spirit of adventure die in Carl too.As Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) settles into retirement, the neighborhood he has known with Ellie has changed around him. Instead of neighbors houses and Oak trees his house is the last standout amongst strip malls and skyscrapers. One day he is surprised by a knock at his door it's a Wilderness Explorer named Russell who is trying to earn a badge in assisting the elderly. Carl gets rid of the kid by sending him on a snipe hunt and he thinks it's the last he's seen of Russell. Through a mishap during a confrontation with an official of the construction company trying to buy Carl's house, he finds himself being forced to go to a retirement home. Carl trying to honor his vow to Ellie to go to Paradise Falls spends the night filling thousands of balloons with helium and escapes the clutches of the retirement home by deploying the balloons and the house floats away headed for Paradise Falls. There's one little problem, after Carl is aloft and sailing on the currents of the wind he's again surprised by a knock at the door, it's Russell who was looking for the snipe under Carl's house. Carl and Russell make it to Paradise Falls and there the adventures begin, but not what they expected it to be. They're befriended by a giant bird Russell names Kevin, a talking dog, and the aged Charles Muntz still obsessed with vindicating his name and returning to civilization with a living creature which turns out to be Kevin.UP is a great adventure for young and old, children will love it for the adventures Carl and Russell have in trying to get to Paradise Falls and the adventures once they get there. And adults will remember the promises of their youth and the adventure they sought and will hopefully make the discovery Carl does, life is the adventure!I think too many movies have sequels made, not because the story can carry it, but because the original made a lot of money, but as UP was ending I was wondering and ready to see what the next adventure for Carl and Russell will be!Like Wall-E before it UP is taking full advantage of the full expressive effects of the medium, there's an almost 20 minute nonverbal beginning & it works to fantastic effect! It's a great adventure for kids and for adults too, it shows you how to open yourself again after your world seems to be shrinking.I noticed some reviews unfavorably mentioned the beginning 20 minutes as not being for children, but that's absolutely incorrect. While the first 20 minutes tell the poignant story of Carl and Ellie's life there is nothing explicit or anything used just for sensational effect. This movie is all about love, hope, adventure, either capturing those emotions or recapturing them in your life.",5,Life is The Adventure!

But I'd heard great things and had lots of folks recommend it as an awesome movie so I went ahead and rented it.My overall thoughts:I like the idea of an animated film about an adult. The story of the man who went on an adventure in his lawn chair has always intrigued me and I loved his simple philosophical reason for his trip, ""You can't just sit there."" (paraphrased). So this story idea appeals to me. Very much.I loved Russell, the little kid who pesters Mr. Fredericksen and Dug, a speaking dog they find on their adventures. Mr. Fredericksen is extremely spot-on. I've encountered this guy before. Russell and Mr. Fredericksen have a Mr. Wilson and Dennis the Menace type of relationship which wasn't my favorite but as the adventure progressed, so did the relationship, and it ended up being a very, very sweet thing.This film is darker than I thought it might be and I don't see it appealing to any kids I know. For starters the opening takes a long time to get to the current story and I was bored with it. Secondly, it's creepy when they encounter the many scary dog minions and the evil master. Kevin the bird annoyed me and though I understand there had to be something thrown in to make the movie more edge of the seat, it just didn't work for me.",3,"Great Idea, But....",1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,1345,"[""'m"", 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'animated', 'movies', 'usually', 'vs.', 'loving', ""'d"", 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'had', 'lots', 'folks', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'movie', 'went', 'ahead', 'rented', 'it.My', 'overall', 'thoughts', 'like', 'idea', 'animated', 'film', 'adult', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'adventure', 'lawn', 'chair', 'always', 'intrigued', 'loved', 'simple', 'philosophical', 'reason', 'trip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'paraphrased', 'story', 'idea', 'appeals', 'Very', 'much.I', 'loved', 'Russell', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Fredericksen', 'Dug', 'speaking', 'dog', 'find', 'adventures', 'Mr.', 'Fredericksen', 'extremely', 'spot-on', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'guy', 'Russell', 'Mr.', 'Fredericksen', 'have', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'type', 'relationship', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'adventure', 'progressed', 'so', 'did', 'relationship', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'very', 'sweet', 'thing.This', 'film', 'darker', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'appealing', 'kids', 'know', 'starters', 'opening', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'current', 'story', 'was', 'bored', 'Secondly', 'creepy', 'when', 'encounter', 'many', 'scary', 'dog', 'minions', 'evil', 'master', 'Kevin', 'bird', 'annoyed', 'understand', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'thrown', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'edge', 'seat', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A

I don't want to return it, as Amazon doesn't know when they'll be able to provide a replacement (and given the legal issues with Luxo, I'm not sure they ever will). I can probably fix it, but pretty annoying to deal with this on something that cost $120.A little more detail on the item. It's not a standalone lamp (and this is probably why mine broke). It is actually a flat plastic base, with the lamp permanently attached. Since the base of the lamp can't move, it put a lot more strain on the point where the bottom 'neck' of the lamp meets the round base, and the plastic 'dowel' (for lack of a better term) broke. The break isn't somewhere visible, and crazy glue will probably take care of it, but grrrrr...Anyway, the base the lamp is attached to is roughly the size/shape of the base of the box pictured. There's an indentation with an adjustable 'thumb' which holds your disc cases (spines out, like books - not as pictured in the box).Overall, the quality is what I expected for the price. The lamp base and shroud are metal. Most of the armature is plastic. The lamp works, and is powered by batteries in the base (not AC).

Surprisingly sad at various points, this is an amazingly emotional film, which somehow feels funny, in a good way.After seeing this in 3D in a theatre, I think the blu-ray is better. The 3D still felt like an effect; the blu-ray through hdmi on a decent flat screen is astonishing. The colors on Kevin the ""snipe"" were easily the deepest vermillion, most translucent purple, and so on, that I have yet to see on our LCD screen. Incredible, and a pleasure just on its own.Add a perfect script, flawless animation with especially natural lighting effects, and an overall patina of unstinting quality, and Pixar has made an animated feature that will wear as well as any film of any sort. The retro feel is integral to its charm, and the whole story feels timeless. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Up. Even the sad bits feel authentic, not Disney fake.The various extras are excellent, especially the short that preceeded Up in theatres, and the fascinating documentary about Tepui, the original Paradise Falls area in Venezuela.

1209587,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B001KVZ6FW,K.T. May,"[1, 2]","Irony strikes when Disney/Pixar produces one of their most complex and entertaining pictures yet and give it such a simple title.Up is a lovely, touching story of the power of human emotion.  Carl, (Ed Asner), and Ellie meet as kids and instantly bond over their shared love of famed explorer, Charles F. Muntz, (Christopher Plummer).  They plan to travel to Paradise Falls in South Africa together and end up falling in love in the process.  Their dream takes a back seat as mature responsibilities like getting a job and running a house take over.  They try to have children but Ellie unfortunately has a miscarriage which will have you shedding a tear or two at the very beginning of the movie, (ahh Disney, always the tearjerker).  Unable to have children, they are content to enjoy each other's company and focus on their dream of Paradise Falls. Just when they think they have finally saved up enough money to be able to go, Ellie succumbs to old age and passes away, leaving Carl alone to grow more and more bitter by the day.Despite construction going on around his house, Carl refuses to move out, not wanting to leave his and Ellie's house behind.  An accidental altercation occurs when the construction workers ruin Carl's mailbox and the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home.  Not having any of that, Carl spends the night attaching thousands of balloons to his house and in the morning, he takes off, headed for Paradise Falls and leaving all those who don't understand behind.  Unfortunately for Carl, his peace is abruptly cut short when Russell, a Wilderness Explorer who is trying to earn his last badge for ""Assisting the Elderly"", is trapped on the now-flying porch.  And this is just the beginning of Carl's adventures!Along the way, Carl and Russell meet Kevin, a huge bird whom Russell names without realizing that she is, in fact, a female bird, and Dug, a dog with a voice-translating collar who can speak his thoughts at the turn of a dial.  Dug is the comic relief in the film and you will be quoting ""Squirrel!"" for weeks after watching this film.  Carl and Russell encounter many obstacles along the way, (what happens when some of the balloons begin to pop?), and even eventually meet up with Charles Muntz, whom Carl realizes wasn't the person he idolized all these years.The depiction of emotion in this film is stronger than in any other Pixar film before it.  You can feel Carl's pain for the loss of his wife in his actions and the way he talks about her to others.  You can feel the warmth and will shed a few tears at the end of the film when Carl discovers what his wife's true dream was all along.  And you will understand the fear they encounter when confronted with immediate danger, and the frustration they experience when it stands in the way of Carl's dream.  Will he ever make it to Paradise Falls?  Will the house be able to withstand all the wear and tear?Another stunning feature in Up is in the vibrancy of the colors and the detail of the animation.  Every single balloon tied to the house has an actual string coming from it!  The colors of the balloons and Kevin the bird, as well as many other elements, are rich and deep and will keep the kids oohing and aahing and asking you to put the DVD on again!Up will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you want to watch it again and share it with others.

The animation was stupendous, as I would expect from Pixar, but the story was awful.They spent too much time on the back story. It was over 20 minutes into the film before his ""adventure"" started, and most of the back story was irrelevant to the rest of the movie. Twenty minutes of mostly irrelevant stuff and no time on the plan to or work he did to fill up the balloons. Carl keeps talking to the house as if it were Ellie, but it was just their house. It was Ellie who had the dream to go to Paradise Falls, not Carl, and she didn't get to go.The Charles Muntz story line didn't make sense. The guy was an accomplished adventurer when Carl Fredricksen was a kid. Now Carl is an old man who has outlived his wife and uses a cane to get around, but Muntz is doing fine and wielding swords?Actually, a lot of this movie just didn't make sense to me. I know, animated films always have stuff in them that doesn't make sense, but too many things just didn't work for me in this one, such as an elderly man acting like an action hero who drags his floating house around on a leash.I think in end the reason I didn't enjoy this is that it wasn't fun. It's not fun to see a couple realize they can't have kids. It's not fun to watch someone outlive his lifelong love. It's not fun to see an elderly person forced to abandon his home. It's not fun to see someone's lifelong hero disappoint him. It's not fun to see someone plummet to his death (since when did they start doing that to the bad guys in Disney/Pixar movies?).

And, what adventure!Without giving away the detail, I belive this picure will be an enduring classic right up there with Toy Story.  I even like it better than the brilliant Wall-E, because it's more real.

But still, adventure is out there!And, actually getting to meet one's hero can turn out in a way you don't expect, and not necessarily good.This is an animated movie with a mind and a soul, when so many seem to have neither.

There are three reasons why Up was supremely satisfying.First, the movie is visually breathtaking. I watched the film in 3-d, which meant that I wore the goofy glasses. This was the first movie I have ever seen in 3-d, and it was awesome. I was like a little kid seeing a lightsaber fight for the first time. In addition to 3-d, the storyboards and animation was beautiful. Vibrant colors and exotic scenes dominated the screen, and I was completely absorbed in the art.The second reason Up was a great movie was the humor in the movie. As I've already mentioned, the film was hilarious. Not just a few laughs, mind you, but whole-theatre laugh-out-loud-for-several-moments funny. The main two characters, grumpy old Mr. Fredricksen and young and clumsy Russell, are wonderfully dynamic with each other, each completing the others comedy. Plus, Kevin and Dug are hysterical.Finally, Up succeeds because of the story. Like books, movies often fail if the story is weak. The writers for Up created a heart-wrenching but soul-laughing story, and the director knew where and when to stir each emotion. Mr. Fredricksen is a widower and Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer looking to earn a badge for his scout troop, and the two form an unlikely duo. The development of their relationship propels the plot with a satisfying conclusion.Overall, this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I'll even confess that not all of the tears that came to my eyes were from laughter. The film was fantastic, especially in 3-d, and I urge you all to go and watch it. Take your special someone, your kids, your friends, or your robot-nanny and watch it.

Every curmudgeon was once an adventurous and wide eyed child but as life takes you on its unpredictable path, you can lose sight of that and forget. Up is an adventure story of the best kind. A disillusioned old man realizes that true joy, the stuff of life, isn't about the destination but lies in meaningful companionship while on the journey.

I saw at the same time as everybody else and loved it when it came out.  I brought older kids, in their early teens to the film and we were surrounded by parents and kids about 4 or 5 in age.  Young kids in my experience tend to want to get up and go to the bathroom, etc, and can be quite annoying during a movie.  Well not with this film.  The kids sat through the movie glued to the screen sitting quietly with their parents.  And the early teenagers and I loved the film as much as the young children did!  The tale is a heart bending one.  An elderly man who had a loving marriage with no children desires to keep the house they lived in for many years as urban development surrounds him.  People are sympathetic if not completely understanding but see him as an elderly man who should be interacting with other people his age in a retirement home.  An altercation with a construction worker seems to determine his fate and he seems destined to be taken to the retirement home.  Not sure how this would happen, but this is the story.  Carl, the old man, devises a way to escape with his house.  With a large amount of balloons, he lifts himself and his house into the air planning to travel to South America where a legendary waterfall exists and his wife always wanted to go there.  Along for the ride accidentally is Russell, a young Wilderness scout who stopped by to earn a badge for assisting the elderly.  The South American trip includes a talking dog named Dug who believes that Carl is his new master and a man named Munce who was once Carl's idol as a child.  Munce is determined to catch a rare bird and has spent his life in pursuit of it.  Ultimately, Carl and Russell find themselves in pursuit of rescuing the bird, named Kevin by Russell and preventing Munce from capturing it.  The film is quite a lot of fun and holds meaning regarding friendship between people and animals and the importance of staying connected in the world.  Just a wonderful movie and the DVD contains two great short animated movies and a documentary about a place in Venezuela which represented the fictional place, Paradise Falls.",5,A Pixar Gem!,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2205,"['came', 'love', 'Pixar', 'late', 'then', 'had', 'backtrack', 'watch', 'films', 'saw', 'same', 'time', 'everybody', 'else', 'loved', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'brought', 'older', 'kids', 'early', 'teens', 'film', 'were', 'surrounded', 'parents', 'kids', '4', '5', 'age', 'Young', 'kids', 'experience', 'tend', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'bathroom', 'etc', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'movie', 'Well', 'not', 'film', 'kids', 'sat', 'movie', 'glued', 'screen', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'parents', 'early', 'teenagers', 'loved', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'young', 'children', 'did', 'tale', 'heart', 'bending', 'one', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'loving', 'marriage', 'children', 'keep', 'house', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'urban', 'development', 'People', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'completely', 'understanding', 'see', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'interacting', 'other', 'people', 'age', 'retirement', 'home', 'altercation', 'construction', 'worker', 'determine', 'fate', 'destined', 'be', 'taken', 'retirement', 'home', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'would', 'happen', 'story', 'Carl', 'old', 'man', 'way', 'escape', 'house', 'large', 'amount', 'balloons', 'house', 'air', 'planning', 'travel', 'South', 'America', 'where', 'legendary', 'waterfall', 'exists', 'wife', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'there', 'ride', 'accidentally', 'Russell', 'young', 'Wilderness', 'scout', 'who', 'stopped', 'earn', 'badge', 'assisting', 'elderly', 'South', 'American', 'trip', 'talking', 'dog', 'named', 'Dug', 'who', 'Carl', 'new', 'master', 'man', 'named', 'Munce', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'Carl', 'idol', 'child', 'Munce', 'determined', 'catch', 'rare', 'bird', 'spent', 'life', 'pursuit', 'Ultimately', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'find', 'pursuit', 'rescuing', 'bird', 'named', 'Kevin', 'Russell', 'preventing', 'Munce', 'capturing', 'film', 'quite', 'lot', 'fun', 'meaning', 'regarding', 'friendship', 'people', 'animals', 'importance', 'staying', 'connected', 'world', 'Just', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'DVD', 'two', 'great', 'short', 'animated', 'movies', 'documentary', 'place', 'Venezuela', 'represented', 'fictional', 'place', 'Paradise', 'Falls']",N/A

1209617,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B001KVZ6FW,"Maine Writer ""David""","[1, 3]","Up is a triumph. It is, in the purest sense, a children's movie -- but not just for the young and young-at-heart, but also for the child that is buried deeply away in each and every one of us. Unlike so many other kids' movies today which aim for the lowest common denominator, go for the cheap laughs (mainly), and mistake bodily functions for humor, Up transcends its genre. Indeed, Up is not only far funnier than the competition, it actually goes for the heart in a way that is completely genuine and heartfelt, and neither cloying, simplistic, nor manipulative. This isn't a Dreamworks money-grab, and thank goodness for that. It aspires to something far greater, and it achieves it.I could go into the details, but this is movie that I think needs to be discovered afresh by each viewer.  That isn't to say that it won't bear repeated viewings; indeed, I'm ready to see it again a day later.  Rather, I think it is such a complete, well-crafted, and timeless tale that the extra bit of sweetness for me was having very little idea about what was about to unfold on the screen.I'd recommend avoiding the 3-D version. It was distracting and unnecessary, though hardly gimmicky.  I think it takes away from the visual experience of the film, which has a palette of warm, spectacular colors that transport you to that sunlit place of your first kiss, your first adventure, and your first experience of life's fragility and tragic beauty. As I watched the film unfold, I thought of my true love who wasn't there beside me and wept tears of gratitude for having loved and been loved, and tears of sadness in knowing that everything is passing. Up eloquently reminded me of the great, small, painful, wondrous, confusing, passionate, and ultimately meaningful mysteries of life.",5,Easily Pixar's Best,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1777,"['Up', 'triumph', 'purest', 'sense', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'young-at-heart', 'also', 'child', 'buried', 'deeply', 'away', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'kids', 'movies', 'today', 'aim', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'go', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'mainly', 'mistake', 'bodily', 'functions', 'humor', 'Up', 'genre', 'Indeed', 'Up', 'not', 'only', 'far', 'funnier', 'competition', 'actually', 'heart', 'way', 'completely', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'cloying', 'simplistic', 'manipulative', ""n't"", 'Dreamworks', 'money-grab', 'thank', 'goodness', 'something', 'far', 'greater', 'it.I', 'could', 'go', 'details', 'movie', 'think', 'needs', 'be', 'discovered', 'afresh', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bear', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'indeed', ""'m"", 'ready', 'see', 'again', 'day', 'later', 'Rather', 'think', 'such', 'complete', 'well-crafted', 'timeless', 'tale', 'extra', 'bit', 'sweetness', 'was', 'having', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'unfold', 'screen.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'avoiding', '3-D', 'version', 'was', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'though', 'hardly', 'gimmicky', 'think', 'away', 'visual', 'experience', 'film', 'palette', 'warm', 'spectacular', 'colors', 'transport', 'sunlit', 'place', 'first', 'kiss', 'first', 'adventure', 'first', 'experience', 'life', 'fragility', 'tragic', 'beauty', 'watched', 'film', 'unfold', 'thought', 'true', 'love', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'beside', 'wept', 'tears', 'gratitude', 'having', 'loved', 'been', 'loved', 'tears', 'sadness', 'knowing', 'everything', 'passing', 'Up', 'eloquently', 'reminded', 'great', 'small', 'painful', 'wondrous', 'confusing', 'passionate', 'ultimately', 'meaningful', 'mysteries', 'life']",N/A

It was that love that lead him to Ellie, a girl who also idolized Charles.  The two eventually married.The years went by, and the two never did fulfill their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America.  Buy the time our story really begins, Carl (voiced now by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man.  The land around his house has been sold to a developer who seizes on one action by Carl to take away his house, too.The night before Carl has to leave, however, he seizes on an opportunity.  He blows up hundreds of helium balloons and sets out for South America.  He has a stowaway in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer looking to get his badge for helping the elderly.  Together, the two set out on a wild adventure that includes a giant bird and Dug, a talking dog (Bob Peterson).  Will they reach Paradise Falls?I've got to admit that the last couple of Pixar movies haven't been the homeruns I've come to expect from them.  This movie was perfect in every way, however.So let's get the negative out of the way first.  This movie is fairly predictable.  I guessed most of the major plot points for the first two thirds of the film not too far into it.  But, as always, the ride through those elements is absolutely wonderful.  And the movie features the return of Pixar's patented climax that will not quit.The movie expertly balances comedic and tender moments.  This is especially true when Dug shows up.  I can't stop laughing at his antics.  But a musical montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the climax also moved me to tears.  Some have found it too serious, but I think the two are blended perfectly to present us with an uplifting message on the power of people who love us in our lives.Of course, they bring all this together with the perfect visuals.  Once again, there are some truly breathtaking moments.  I don't know how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.The movie is rated PG for mild peril related to a storm early on and elements of the climax.  I think only the easily frightened will have a problem with it.  Additionally, the movie does touch on death and divorce as it relates to our two main characters.  Frankly, I think both are handled well, but parents might want to be prepared to discuss that with their kids.This truly is an uplifting movie that will make you laugh and send leave you wanting to hug the ones you love.

To say it's beautiful to look at - is a wild understatement. If ever a film showed how good HI DEF can be, then ""Up"" is it. The man-hours that must have been put into this - the detail is gob-smacking.The faint stubble increasing on Mr. Fredricksen's chin as the days go by (he wouldn't have shaved), the scuffing on the caps of his shoes, the fingerprint smears on his goggles as he watches the Munz footage as a child in a cinema, the dust particles in the beams of light as the young Carl wanders into an abandoned house on hearing a girl's voice (the love of his life, a young Ellie), the grown-up Ellie, her hair blowing gently in the wind (viewed from the back) as she sits in her chair having been given the awful news about...I don't why it's all so touching, so funny or so charming - it just is.Other brill things include Ed Azner's perfectly cast voice as the grumpy old man Carl, the constantly chattering and whining Russell, the 8-year old Wilderness Explorer boy scout who latches onto to him, his house and his dreams, Dug the soppy talking dog, Kevin the tall South American bird who mimics everything and races across the screen like a demented gangly Road Runner, Christopher Plumber's fantastically sinister voice as the elderly Munz the Explorer - it's all magical stuff.

Animation has long been a force in motion pictures because, to be plain about it, you can draw (or in the modern world, computer animate) things that would be difficult to impossible to replicate with ""live-action"" films.  (CGI blurs the boundaries, but this isn't the place for that discussion.)UP is a film with characters more believable and lovable than any ten brain-dead films you're likely to see beween now and Halloween.  It is sad and poignant, and it is often laugh out loud funny.The film begins with a young boy, Carl, who is adventurous and playful and meets a young girl, Ellie, who is even more adventurous.  We learn in this early part that a famous explorer hasn't been seen for decades after heading off to Paradise Falls in a South American jungle.  As children, Carl and Ellie idolized this explorer. After their pre-pubertal meet-cute, we're treated to an exceptional montage giving us a sense of the life Carl and Ellie enjoy together, ending with an elderly Carl who has recently lost the love of his life.Thus begins the next act of the film.  Carl, voiced wonderfully by treasured Ed Asner, is still living in the home he shared for years with Ellie.  The rest of the neighborhood has been leveled by a high-rise construction company, and they have Carl in their sites.  Carl flies off the handle in an altercation with the construction crews, and is ordered to a retirement home.Carl instead hitches the home to a flock of helium balloons and heads the old home place for Paradise Falls.  He soon discovers a stowaway quaking on the front porch: zealous Explorer Scout Russell, who happened to be on Carl's porch trying to earn his ""Help the Elderly"" merit badge.They make their way through a few flying perils and arrive near the mysterious Paradise Falls, where they find dogs who can mysteriously speak.  (An hilarious recurring joke makes much of the fact that dogs can be totally and suddenly distracted by even a mention of a squirrel.)The film recycles a few old chestnut themes like ""following your dream"" and ""being there for one another,"" but it does so with such a knowing and tender and kind-hearted perspective that you can't help but be enchanted by this exceptional film.

Up offers the audience a moving portrait of a former child nerd who grows into a grumpy old loner.

Then the major action begins as he decides to go away and realize his childhood dream of finding this land in South America, but this annoying kid ends up on his porch, ruining his fantasy escape. However, he learns better and in the end appreciates the boy and becomes his unofficial adoptive grandfather. Everything in this film is wonderful, there is no fault in it that I find.

No wonder, too--the story is endearing with lots of action depicting the classic struggle of good versus evil; the animation is the best I've ever seen and the voiceovers leave nothing to be desired. The plot moves along very nicely with good character development and the action works very well alongside the tender message of the film that left me with a tear in my eye. Indeed, ""Up"" will remain one of the finest animated films of all time because it deals with so many universal issues and themes we think about in life--friendship, loyalty, love, the struggle of good versus evil and the desire to make your biggest dreams come true.The film starts with us meeting two young kids, Carl and Ellie who worship their childhood idol, South American explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Carl and Ellie play together as kids and they grow up to be sweethearts and marry, too.  They are happy together; but their childhood dream of going to Paradise Falls where Charles Muntz discovered bones from an exotic bird never gets accomplished. Muntz has long since returned to Paradise Falls after he was labeled a fraud back home; he told reporters when he left again for South America's Paradise Falls that he will bring back the actual bird dead or alive to prove his discovery was real but he never returned.With time, Ellie and Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) become elderly and Ellie passes away. Carl's house is forever being threatened by new construction; and the court orders him to live at Shady Oaks nursing home after Carl accidentally hits construction worker Steve (voiced by Danny Mann) with his mailbox! Carl also meets a young wilderness explorer, Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). Carl devises a successful plan to have his house float away to Paradise Falls using helium balloons; but after taking off, Carl soon discovers that Russell is along for the ride!Of course, there's much, much more to the plot with action and heartrending scenes that really are memorable. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much away. Suffice it to say that Carl does get to South America with Russell where they meet Kevin, a rare bird that loves chocolate and Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson), an incredibly sweet golden retriever. Unfortunately, however, there are some other animals that are not exactly friendly; and this causes huge problems after their other encounter with the now elderly and rather evil Charles Muntz.This two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. We get an animated short entitled ""Partly Cloudy;"" ""Adventure Is Out There;"" ""Dug's Special Mission;"" an optional running commentary with co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson--and more! The second DVD lets you access the digital copy and the digital copy code is provided with the artwork inside the DVD case.""Up"" just couldn't be better; the film leaves nothing to be desired.

Its ""sad"" scenes, the ones centering on Carl's (voiced expertly by Ed Asner) personal journey of dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of his childhood dreams, are really quite beautiful and unreservedly recommended.The other stuff, however... Well, at the risk of making a pun, it could've probably used a little more time on the drawing board. Dug the dog, for instance, does a Stimpy voice that proved the be the bane of my existence during the scenes in which he is prominent. Be you 5 or 50, there's just nothing cool or funny about a Stimpy voice, and it killed a lot of the already spread-too-thin comedy of the film.Speaking of 5 or 50, this film is directed at kids, but I would advise parents to watch it first to determine how they feel about it before sharing it with the younger set. I know it's a Pixar cartoon, and Pixar cartoons are universally assumed to be kids' movies, but this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with childhood. As I mentioned, it's about dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of childhood dreams. Are these really problems that kids face? Perhaps I define ""kids' movie"" differently than some, but I just wonder if I were to rotoscope ""Chinatown"" and run commercials for it during reruns of ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" whether or not it would be hailed as a kids' movie. I see the distinction thematically, not aesthetically, is all I'm saying, and I would advise parental discretion.As for a specific recommendation, my take is that this is not a film that needs to be watched over and over again. While it is good enough to watch once, a DVD or Blu-Ray copy of the film would be extraneous and would inevitably end up just collecting dust on the shelf, with each glance in its direction conjuring memories of the film's weaker moments rather than its strengths.",3,"By The Time I Get Done With This Review, You're Gonna Feel So Assisted!",1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1874,"['like', 'Up', 'things', 'well', 'extremely', 'well', 'sad', 'scenes', 'ones', 'centering', 'Carl', 'voiced', 'expertly', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'personal', 'journey', 'dealing', 'loss', 'recognizing', 'facade', 'childhood', 'dreams', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'unreservedly', 'recommended.The', 'other', 'stuff', 'however', 'Well', 'risk', 'making', 'pun', 'could', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'drawing', 'board', 'Dug', 'dog', 'instance', 'Stimpy', 'voice', 'proved', 'be', 'bane', 'existence', 'scenes', 'prominent', 'Be', '5', '50', 'just', 'nothing', 'cool', 'funny', 'Stimpy', 'voice', 'killed', 'lot', 'already', 'spread-too-thin', 'comedy', 'film.Speaking', '5', '50', 'film', 'directed', 'kids', 'would', 'advise', 'parents', 'watch', 'first', 'determine', 'how', 'feel', 'sharing', 'younger', 'set', 'know', 'Pixar', 'cartoon', 'Pixar', 'cartoons', 'are', 'universally', 'assumed', 'be', 'kids', 'movies', 'film', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'childhood', 'mentioned', 'dealing', 'loss', 'recognizing', 'facade', 'childhood', 'dreams', 'Are', 'really', 'problems', 'kids', 'face', 'Perhaps', 'define', 'kids', 'movie', 'differently', 'just', 'wonder', 'were', 'rotoscope', 'Chinatown', 'run', 'commercials', 'reruns', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'kids', 'movie', 'see', 'distinction', 'thematically', 'not', 'aesthetically', ""'m"", 'saying', 'would', 'advise', 'parental', 'discretion.As', 'specific', 'recommendation', 'take', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'once', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'copy', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'extraneous', 'would', 'inevitably', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'collecting', 'dust', 'shelf', 'glance', 'direction', 'conjuring', 'memories', 'film', 'weaker', 'moments', 'rather', 'strengths']",N/A

Bottom line: This is a must own for both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking people.Forgot to say, lately Pixar films have had such weird premises (Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up) that when I first hear what the plot will be I think: WTH? and when I watch them the first time I'm left kind of unsatisfied after having already known too much about the plot through trailers and previews...

1209649,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001KVZ6FW,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Up"" is an oddly incongruous film from Pixar in that it has primarily adult themes but a relatively simple visual style and an over-the-top adventure plot. Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is an elderly widower who had always dreamed with his wife Ellie of far-flung adventures. In particular, they wanted to visit ""Paradise Falls"" in South America, where their childhood hero, an adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), made his name. Before he is forced into a retirement home, Carl takes one last shot at his dream. He attaches about 20,000 helium balloons to his house, hoists some sails, and sets the house aloft. But Carl has an unintended guest: an boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai), overeager to get his Wilderness Explorer ""Helping the Elderly Badge"", is on the porch.Carl and Russell have only a few days to deposit the house atop Paradise Falls before the balloons deflate. The boy's idealism and enthusiasm clash with Carl's sense of urgency. Russell befriends a giant bird and a talking dog named Dug (Bob Petersen) but cannot understand Carl's increasing desperation. Carl is an old man who feels the pressure of very limited time to fulfill his life's dream, and at first he doesn't' have much patience with Russell's cheerful but easily distracted temperament. Now, this is entertaining to watch, but how much would a child understand or care about Carl's problem? ""Up"" does not limit its appeal to children, as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"" did, but I wonder if it has not done the opposite and taken on themes that are irrelevant to children.I hope this will not spoil the movie for anyone, but I feel compelled to mention the strangest thing about this film: There is a man living in the jungle who is right out of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". He is worshiped and served by a group of violent primitives (in this case domesticated dogs), and he collects the heads (in this case helmets) of those who have dared trespass his little fiefdom, whom we assume he has killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz. Should I be surprised to see a Kurtz character in a ""family film""? There is nothing graphic about ""Up"", and I don't think this guy is any scarier than a typical Pixar villain. ""Up"" is an entertaining film, though it lacks the visual interest and innovation that I've come to expect from Pixar (it was intended to be shown in 3D).

To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.

This was definitely cute although a little out there in the storyline.After his adventurous wife of many years dies, Mr.Fredericksen turns somewhat recluse.  It had always been their dream to go to Paradise Falls and live there and when he's about to be shipped off to a retirement home, Mr. Frederickson gets an idea.  When they come to collect him the next day, he and his house take off while tied to hundreds of balloons.  The only problem is the local Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell was on his porch and is carried along with him.  They manage to land, but not quite near Paradise Falls and with the house still floating they decide to drag it around to the falls.  But some strange characters show up, a wild colorful bird, and a talking dog, and things start to get a little more interesting.  Namely when the talking dog turns out to belong to a old hero of Mr. Frederickson's and is desperate to get ahold of the strange bird and take it away from its babies.For characters all the voice actors did a great job.  I really liked Mr. Frederickson, he was a great character and while surly, still lovable.  Russell on the other hand drove me nuts, its a bit harsh but I kept hoping Darwinism would kick in for him as he just kept doing such stupid things for a kid his age.  I loved the bird and the dog, the dog especially since it could talk really sounded and acted like what I thought a dog would.  The other talking dogs were great as well. *Spoilers ahead*  Another problem character I had was the crazy explorer after the bird, he was really evil for being in a child's movie and trying to kill a child in it.For a plot it was pretty simplistic but charming all the same.  Sure there's a lot of unbelievable aspects but it is a kid's movie and fantasy elements can be accepted.  I have to say that my favorite part of the movie was probably in the beginning where it showed snapshots and Mr. Frederickson and his wife's life together.  Since it was pixar you know the graphics were good, and they really did a wonderful job on the animations.  It was very colorful.Not a bad Pixar movie, there are others out there I like better, but this one was rather sweet.  Definitely a good kid's movie.Review by M.

With better story lines than most Hollywood dramas, Pixar never fails to impress and most of the time astound! 'Up' is a beautiful looking film with a very emotional theme and is probably a little too adult for the younger kids. Pixar leaves out the wisecracking side characters and adds depth to the story of an old man who loses his life partner and must find a way to keep on going. He decides to complete one of the many adventures he and his wife had planned for so many years, but like many of us never seemed to get to it. Yes!, it does sound a little too deep for an animated film, but animated films have come along way and if this is the direction they're headed that's fine by me!The film has some of the most impressive animation ever done and the characters are, well.....almost real! Pixar hasn't really had a bad film and this is certainly among one of their best, but with winners such as Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, I'm not sure if this slightly downer is going to become a film to watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film and deserves a heap of credit trying to follow Wall-E, but with such an emotionally adult theme, I'm not sure who this film is targeted for?The 4 disc Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras and the usual standard DVD, digital copy blah, blah, blah, and is certainly one of the best Blu Ray releases I've seen so far.

No movie should cost more than $20; and with so many DVD's these days being bargain priced at $10, this film is way overpriced. As if the company is ashamed to ask for so much $$$, they've even included a label that reads ""a $74 dollar value""? Really? How is that possible when all I want is the movie? I could care less for the 3D glasses or the extra special features or the on-line bonus material or the digicopy disc. Does anybody really care about all that stuff? Doesn't 90% of the population just want the movie and maybe a decent documentary to go with it? Does Pixar really think so little of its fans that it thinks it can pull the wool over our heads like this?I had planned on completing my Pixar collection on Blu-Ray since the transfers look fantastic but now I have to reconsider. We are currently in a recession and I don't have the extra money for this. Of course, this begs the question, why? Why does Pixar have to charge so much extra for their movies? Surely, a popular title like Up will be mass produced to sell a bazillion copies, therefore allowing for more economic pricing. Could it be that the greed that sank the Disney Corp. after ""The Lion King"" topped the box office has now affected Pixar? Has Pixar succumb to its own success? I prayed the day wouldn't come. I was a HUGE Disney fan, to the point of near religious devotion, before the company sold their heart and soul (Cinderella 2, anyone?) for a cheap buck. Please, John Lasseter, give us reasonable pricing and try to remember what made your company special in the first place---caring more about the art and less about the money.

I NEVER use a digital copy, as I don't have an I-anything and the idea of watching a high def on a screen smaller than 32 inches makes no sense to me. When I first saw this, I thought the description of his package being a four disc edition was a typo.I LOVE the idea of packaging a Blu-ray and a regular DVD together in the same package, since I don't have Blu-ray in every room of my house and would like to watch a movie in a room other than the one my home entertainment system is in and I've been forced to buy two copies of the same movie to do so. HD DVD had the right idea by putting one of each on the two sides of the disc, but I'll take a separate DVD copy instead.What I'm annoyed about is the practice of putting the extras on a separate disc, since one of the ideas behind Blu-ray was to put out a disc that could hold roughly three times the information a DVD could, so I find putting extras on a separate disc is nothing more than an excuse to jack the price up, as is the digital copy.Since this is the way it is (and it's not confined to Disney, by the way), I will have to buy the four disc set because the three disc set is only offering the movie, extras, and the useless digital copy.

It omits a soft glow rather than a harsh light (were you to use a conventional globe).The base also houses a handy adjustable shelf which you can slot your various blu-ray cases.It's larger than I envisioned and despite the cheap Chinese build, it's a centrepiece that I'm sure will impress all that view it (just don't let anyone play with it).As long as you can purchase this and pick it up (would not take the risk with shipping) I would recommend it and if you are a big Pixar fan this item is the ultimate keepsake.Just like their movies which evoke emotion, this item will bring a smile to your face every time you glimpse it.As far as the movie itself is concerned I can't really add anything that has already been stated in all the sterling reviews that have been posted however I will add that when I went and saw this at the cinemas some families left due to the high emotional response that their children had to some events throughout the movie.

1209692,AHF97M45JFCB,B001KVZ6FW,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Perhaps I should begin this review with some interesting facts about 2009's Up before even beginning to break down the nuts, bolts and personal opinions of the film.  Up represents director Pete Docter's first Pixar project since 2001's Monsters Inc, it was Pixar's first ever 3D film, it was the first Disney collaboration to earn a PG rating since Pixar's The Incredibles, it features Pixar's first Japanese/Asian-American character, it was the first Disney/Pixar film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (only the second animated film ever to do that), and until Toy Story 3, it earned notoriety as the second most commercially successful Pixar work (behind Finding Nemo).  Now that's quite a bit of distinction!So what's with all the hype you ask? I can't be positive but in my opinion it is the least Pixar-like of all of the Pixar films.  How so? Well I typically associate the company with plot concepts so overly clever that they would be charming even if every other aspect of the film bombed (which has, to date, never happened in case you're wondering).Up is, well, different.  It starts out by recapping a very-human couple's lifespan then transforms into a fairly straightforward adventure story.  No monsters here, no robots, living toys, and even the talking animals are explained scientifically!Up is a comedy adventure about a 78-year-old widower and retired balloon salesman named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), who finally fulfills a rather unorthodox lifelong dream of great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and sails toward the wilds of South America.  It is this flying house gimmick that will forever stick in the collective minds of the public (and inspired the film's title) but beyond the superficial there lies a pretty charming tale of the human condition that harkens back to vintage Disney in their 2D prime.Up opens by telling Carl's story with extraordinary tenderness and a sense of pacing that hints of a brisk, consistent emotionally charged story. However, the balloon driven air-abode represents the introduction to the second half of the film, which essentially transforms our gray-haired heart string tugger into a bit of a geriatric action hero; a sort of Indiana Jones' great grandfather if you will.Fortunately this is Pixar here people, and any doubts of pointless exposition are offset by the unique dynamic established when Carl finds himself an unintentional guardian of a boisterous young scout precisely 70-years his junior.This young Wilderness Explorer (think boy scouts without the legal snares for rights), Russell (Jordan Nagai), provides some wonderfully humorous moments that act as the perfect catalyst to bring out the comedic best from the ever-grumpy Carl.The visuals, which as is par for the course with the companies involved, are appropriately awesome with photo-realistic texturing, mind-boggling lighting effects, and characters positively charged with personality.The score comes from none other than living legend Michael Giacchino (no stranger to Pixar's scoring demands, having worked with them on The Incredibles & Ratatouille).  It is appropriately epic when need be and charmingly intimate when the film's proverbial heart calls for it.In all Up provides a very charming emotionally laced 96-minute joyride that manages to pack a whole lot of charm into what really boils down to a fairly straightforward adventure piece.  Like all of Pixar's works, it succeeds in providing something appealing to viewers from any conceivable age groups and does so with an effortlessness that hints to the reality that Pixar could very well be the best place to work in the whole world.",4,A Brilliant Prose Spread Across Two Story Arcs,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,3677,"['Perhaps', 'should', 'begin', 'review', 'interesting', 'facts', '2009', 'Up', 'before', 'even', 'beginning', 'break', 'down', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'personal', 'opinions', 'film', 'director', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'first', 'Pixar', 'project', '2001', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'was', 'Pixar', 'first', 'ever', '3D', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'Disney', 'collaboration', 'earn', 'PG', 'rating', 'Pixar', 'Incredibles', 'Pixar', 'first', 'Japanese/Asian-American', 'character', 'was', 'first', 'Disney/Pixar', 'film', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'only', 'second', 'animated', 'film', 'ever', 'do', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'earned', 'notoriety', 'second', 'most', 'commercially', 'successful', 'Pixar', 'work', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Now', 'quite', 'bit', 'distinction', 'what', 'hype', 'ask', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'positive', 'opinion', 'least', 'Pixar-like', 'Pixar', 'films', 'How', 'so', 'Well', 'typically', 'associate', 'company', 'plot', 'concepts', 'so', 'overly', 'clever', 'would', 'be', 'charming', 'even', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'bombed', 'date', 'never', 'happened', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', '.Up', 'well', 'different', 'out', 'recapping', 'very-human', 'couple', 'lifespan', 'then', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'adventure', 'story', 'monsters', 'here', 'robots', 'living', 'toys', 'even', 'talking', 'animals', 'are', 'explained', 'scientifically', 'Up', 'comedy', 'adventure', '78-year-old', 'widower', 'retired', 'balloon', 'salesman', 'named', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'who', 'finally', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'great', 'adventure', 'when', 'thousands', 'balloons', 'house', 'wilds', 'South', 'America', 'flying', 'house', 'gimmick', 'will', 'forever', 'stick', 'collective', 'minds', 'public', 'inspired', 'film', 'title', 'superficial', 'pretty', 'charming', 'tale', 'human', 'condition', 'back', 'vintage', 'Disney', '2D', 'prime.Up', 'opens', 'telling', 'Carl', 'story', 'extraordinary', 'tenderness', 'sense', 'pacing', 'hints', 'brisk', 'consistent', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'story', 'However', 'balloon', 'driven', 'air-abode', 'introduction', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'essentially', 'gray-haired', 'heart', 'string', 'tugger', 'bit', 'geriatric', 'action', 'hero', 'sort', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'great', 'grandfather', 'will.Fortunately', 'Pixar', 'here', 'people', 'doubts', 'pointless', 'exposition', 'are', 'offset', 'unique', 'dynamic', 'established', 'when', 'Carl', 'unintentional', 'guardian', 'boisterous', 'young', 'scout', 'precisely', 'junior.This', 'young', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'think', 'boy', 'scouts', 'legal', 'snares', 'rights', 'Russell', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'wonderfully', 'humorous', 'moments', 'act', 'perfect', 'catalyst', 'bring', 'out', 'comedic', 'best', 'ever-grumpy', 'Carl.The', 'visuals', 'as', 'par', 'course', 'companies', 'involved', 'are', 'appropriately', 'awesome', 'photo-realistic', 'texturing', 'mind-boggling', 'lighting', 'effects', 'characters', 'positively', 'charged', 'personality.The', 'score', 'none', 'other', 'living', 'legend', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'stranger', 'Pixar', 'scoring', 'demands', 'having', 'worked', 'Incredibles', 'Ratatouille', 'appropriately', 'epic', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'charmingly', 'intimate', 'when', 'film', 'proverbial', 'heart', 'it.In', 'Up', 'very', 'charming', 'emotionally', 'laced', '96-minute', 'joyride', 'pack', 'whole', 'lot', 'charm', 'what', 'really', 'down', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'adventure', 'piece', 'Pixar', 'works', 'providing', 'something', 'appealing', 'viewers', 'conceivable', 'age', 'groups', 'so', 'effortlessness', 'reality', 'Pixar', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'place', 'work', 'whole', 'world']",N/A

1209695,A34PUCLNFN62D3,B001KVZ6FW,Paco Caldern,"[25, 34]","A wonderful short film stretched into a two hour movie. Bigger ain't always better.The first part is moviemaking at its best and a milestone in animation. The two minute depiction of a lifetime marriage is a class act in itself: moving storytelling without a word spoken. Audiences the world over mellow and cry; why shoudn't they? Whereas, the scene when the balloons burst out and the house takes flight constitutes the film's showstopper, meaning not only that it's the most spectacular, but that it marks the emotional conclusion of the story, and should have ended it right there. For beyond that point, the sentimental balloon can only deflate and go down.Two minor gripes on the descent:Supposedly, once you buy the idea of a balloon flying house, anything goes. It does not. Talking dogs that fly planes can extract a laugh or two, but they totally wreck the mood created so far. It's like matching a Magritte with ""Dogs Playing Poker"" (a painting lampooned in the movie, by the way) on the basis that they're both surreal images. Not so. One pertains a subtle magic that's incompatible with the other's bold crassness.Second, I don't quite get the villain. Sort of an airborne Captain Nemo; a discredited, embittered mad genius bent on vindication, if not revenge. In an obvious nod to both Verne and Disney, Muntz's art-deco zeppelin resembles Nemo's lavish Nautilus. Yet the man ought to be a centennial old geezer by now, instead of the silverhaired swasbuckling fiend that comes up with talking devices for dogs but can't catch a giant peacock that only requires a bite of chocolate. That's another thing: people who love nature and adventure tend to grow happy and wise as they get older. Would anyone kill an endangered bird, let alone shoot a kid, after a lifetime of experiencing nature's wonders? Sorry, doesn't click.At long last, the movie ends as it should: the house arrives at the falls, the boyscout earns his badge, and the old man reacquaints himself to life.

Funniest thing is the Alpha Dog is a doberman and his translator is broken and he sounds like a chipmunk.Even though the dogs are wearing translators they are still dogs and they are constantly distracted by the thought of a squirrel running by.As you can tell, these are way-out weird plot elements.

Up is possibly the best animated movie of the year and it could even be considered the best movie of the year, live action or animated. And Disney has once again produced an outstanding package, with a bonus DVD and Digital Copy. The blu-ray is simply mind-blowing, but Disney has taken care to produce a top-quality DVD and digital copy as well, within the constraints imposed by the two standard-def formats. The soundstage too is simply amazing, whichever version you choose to watch.The story is original and takes the viewers on a rollercoaster (sorry, balloon) ride to a little known corner of the world. We can identify with the lead character, as we are all adventurous in our minds, but time and monetary constraints do not usually allow us to explore such regions of our world. There are plenty of thrills and spills on the way and perhaps no live action feature could do justice to a story of this nature. All the characters, man or animal, are lively. The dialogue is witty too. The supplements are good, though not exceptional. There are some moments which may be somewhat scary to very small children, so parents should watch it along with them.This is not only a film for kids, it is a film for all ages. And I mean it also in the sense that it will stand the test of time, long after we are gone. The 3-D version will eventually find its way to homes via the new 3-D blu-ray standard, but until then this 2D release will do just fine.

The extras here really pleased me and that was a big factor in my 5 star award for this release.You get ""Dugs Special Missions"" which is a new short that follows the misadventures of Dug the dog.  This is really cute and I think for children, Dug is a memorable character from the film.You also get the short film ""Partly Cloudy"", now if you saw Up in the theater and got there on time, you might remember the short film about the unlucky cloud.  It's really a nice short film and I was  happy to know they included it here.You also get the Making of Up and the Many Endings of Muntaz which are essentially alternate endings.  Now on the extra blu ray exclusive bonus disc you have:Global Guardian Badge Game - this is a simply multiplayer geography game.Married Life - is an extended character back story feature8 All New Documentaries.

1209720,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B001KVZ6FW,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[1, 5]","Up isn't actually my first Pixar disappointment. I didn't really like A Bug's Life or Cars, and in my opinion The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E fell short of their potential. Up has really gotten a lot of attention though, absolutely adored by critics and constantly popping up in pop culture. I feel like if DreamWorks or Blue Sky Studios (who don't have such polished reputations) had made this film, it would be called ""fine but unremarkable"" or ""underwhelming"".Up gets off to a promising start. After their childhood back-story is established, there is a long montage of the married life between Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie. It evoked real emotion, as I watched time pass in their world, it reminded of how ""time flies by"" in the real world, and a lot of the regret that comes with long-term procrastination, with distant dreams that you want to happen but secretly know won't.Carl somehow lifts his house off the ground using balloons. It's required I guess, the lifting of the house is a huge part of Carl and his character. You need it for him to even get started on his journey. It even adds a layer of adventure, makes it *epic*. But then the movie feels the need to have an antagonist.Charles Muntz is a poorly handled villain in a movie that didn't need one. He's spent years in South America looking for this cryptid bird, and he's become so afraid that someone will steal his glory that he's ready to kill. It's ridiculous think he wouldn't want to join up with other explorers and make his life easier. He may want all the credit, but to turn evil? He's rather vengeful toward to the bird, which seems to be outside the nature of this kind of character. He cares about his dogs, but not a bird that has pretty much dominated his life for years? How could he NOT have caught this thing by now? If he's never owned chocolate, how come Beta and Gamma could recognize its smell? Why doesn't he show the world his other amazing discoveries and become famous again? He could have been portrayed as a willing but broken old man who just wants to do something meaningful. He could even have symbolized what happens to a person when they can't admit to themselves that some dreams can't be realized.Ed Asner was great as Carl, and Jordan Nagai was pretty good as Russell. Was I emotionally involved in their ""I don't have a son, and I don't have a dad"" relationship? No, I found it tired and sentimental.Up is rather barren, you don't see much of anything. There's a bird, a zeppelin, dogs, and that's all. At one point Muntz mentions how he's lots so many dogs to the labyrinth. Suddenly I got really interested. ""Wow, a giant maze out here...that just sounds so cool!"" The labyrinth is sort of seen, but they don't actually go in or anything. The film's whimsy doesn't remedy this and works against it.

""Up"" ranks as one of the most original tales the team has come up with, featuring one of the most unlikeliest heroes. Carl Fredericksen (perfectly voiced by Ed Asner) was a young boy who idolized Charles Muntz, a revered explorer whose discovery of a rare South American bird fossil turned out to be faked. Forcing him back to the Amazon, Muntz vanishes for years. Carl unexpectedly finds common ground in his dreams of flight & exploration with a sprightly girl named Ellie. In one of the most touching episodic montages I've ever seen, Carl & Ellie live out their lives together: From marriage to daydreaming on a grassy hill to the ""Paradise Falls Fund Jar"" (which keeps getting raided when emergencies arise) to Ellie's illness & subsequent death. Now alone, old and beside himself, Carl is facing the mothballing of his remaining days in a retirement home. What to do? Simple: The retired balloon salesman attaches thousands of colorful balloons to his quaint little home & sails off to Paradise Falls, the place him & Ellie had long ago dreamed of going to. Unfortunately, Carl has picked up a passenger cowering on his porch: Russell, a pudgy Wilderness Scout who's trying to earn a merit's badge for helping the elderly. Russell is soon driving the old curmudgeon crazy.Upon arrival, Carl soon learns that this expedition is more than he bargained for as Dug--a cute dog fitted with a human-voiced collar--and ""Kevin"", the rare bird of Muntz's obsession--are along for the ride. Sure enough, Carl encounters the elderly Muntz, whose hero worship of him soon turns deadly once the half-crazed Muntz discovers Carl is harboring Kevin. And so, the movie's tempo shifts from a reflective, whimsical tale into an action-packed adventure full of offbeat twists & turns.In the ""adventure book"" that Ellie leaves behind, she writes to Carl: ""Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one!"" And that alone sums up what the film is saying: Never stop living, and be there for the younger generation.DVD extras include the charming & amusing original short ""Partly Cloudy"", and the new short ""Dug's Special Mission"", an extension of the movie's plot.An animated film that will always remain one of Disney-Pixar's most special efforts!",5,Disney-Pixar reach new heights,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,2338,"['Just', 'when', 'think', 'Disney-Pixar', 'animation', 'hit', 'ceiling', 'come', 'up', 'engaging', 'film', 'ranks', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'tales', 'team', 'come', 'up', 'featuring', 'one', 'most', 'unlikeliest', 'heroes', 'Carl', 'Fredericksen', 'perfectly', 'voiced', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'idolized', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'revered', 'explorer', 'discovery', 'rare', 'South', 'American', 'bird', 'fossil', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'faked', 'Forcing', 'back', 'Amazon', 'Muntz', 'years', 'Carl', 'unexpectedly', 'common', 'ground', 'dreams', 'flight', 'exploration', 'sprightly', 'girl', 'named', 'Ellie', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'episodic', 'montages', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'live', 'out', 'lives', 'together', 'From', 'marriage', 'daydreaming', 'grassy', 'hill', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'Fund', 'Jar', 'getting', 'raided', 'when', 'emergencies', 'arise', 'Ellie', 'illness', 'subsequent', 'death', 'Now', 'alone', 'old', 'beside', 'Carl', 'facing', 'mothballing', 'remaining', 'days', 'retirement', 'home', 'What', 'do', 'Simple', 'retired', 'balloon', 'salesman', 'thousands', 'colorful', 'balloons', 'quaint', 'little', 'home', 'sails', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'place', 'Ellie', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'dreamed', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'Carl', 'picked', 'up', 'passenger', 'cowering', 'porch', 'Russell', 'pudgy', 'Wilderness', 'Scout', 'who', 'trying', 'earn', 'merit', 'badge', 'helping', 'elderly', 'Russell', 'soon', 'driving', 'old', 'curmudgeon', 'crazy.Upon', 'arrival', 'Carl', 'soon', 'expedition', 'more', 'bargained', 'Dug', 'cute', 'dog', 'fitted', 'human-voiced', 'collar', 'Kevin', 'rare', 'bird', 'Muntz', 'obsession', 'are', 'ride', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Carl', 'elderly', 'Muntz', 'hero', 'worship', 'soon', 'deadly', 'once', 'half-crazed', 'Muntz', 'discovers', 'Carl', 'harboring', 'Kevin', 'so', 'movie', 'tempo', 'shifts', 'reflective', 'whimsical', 'tale', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'full', 'offbeat', 'twists', 'turns.In', 'adventure', 'book', 'Ellie', 'Carl', 'Thanks', 'adventure', 'Now', 'go', 'have', 'new', 'one', 'alone', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'film', 'saying', 'Never', 'stop', 'living', 'be', 'there', 'younger', 'generation.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'charming', 'amusing', 'original', 'short', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'new', 'short', 'Dug', 'Special', 'Mission', 'extension', 'movie', 'plot.An', 'animated', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'one', 'Disney-Pixar', 'most', 'special', 'efforts']",N/A

WHen I saw it in digital 3D, I was excited but also very doubtful, because I was unsure of whether or not Disney would be able to reach the heights that they did with ""WALL-E"". But I walked out of the theater totally amazed! It is indeed Pixar's best film yet, even better than WALL-E.Yesteday I bought this at HMV. When I got home, I watched the movie and then explored the features.SOUND QUALITY: 5/5: This edition has what most blu-rays lack nowadays- reak ooomph. You can feel it when the house ascends from the ground! The score is vivified here too, almost in a way that the score plays a real charater in the film. The subwoofer and back speakers create a sense of surrounding too- something that makes you feel like you're in it.PICTURE: Infinite/5- This may just have the best picture quality for the Blu-Ray format. WALL-E and Bolt were both deemed to be the best Blu-Ray releases, but this one beats them put of the park. No grain, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, just perfect. No complaints about the picture at all! The Boosted-Up colors in ""WALL-E"" looked great, but this movie takes on a more natural look, whereas they still srike you. The montage looked great, but what looked the best were the scenes in Muntz's blimp.EXTRAS: 4/5- They were pretty good extras, but this didn't need to have two discs- a lot of the features could easily fit on one disc. That said, they're still cool. The alternate endings one was really cool, the game was a fun play, and the documentaries were worth watching for sure.TOTAL: 5/5- Do get this Blu-Ray.

1209739,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B001KVZ6FW,RJ Smoove,"[2, 2]","To be honest, the first time I saw Up in theatres, I liked it, but I just did not see what everyone was so excited about. I kept thinking to myself, ""What's the big deal?"" I am very happy to say that I finally see what the big deal is. Up is a beautiful, heartfelt story. It captures the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) perfectly from his youth, to his golden years. The montage near the beginning was one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen, and probably the most wonderful thing that I have seen in a Pixar film to date. The scene itself set a variety of moods, from sad to joyous, but the music really brought it to life. It was perfectly set to another great score by Michael Giacchino, who also blew me away with his Star Trek score. In my opinion, Up has to be the best Pixar film yet. They have done nothing but good things for the last couple of decades. It seems like everything they make becomes a classic. Until I saw Up for the second time, I would never have imagined myself ever saying that it was the best they have done so far. But it is the truth. The imagination is a beautiful thing, and those guys over at the Disney Pixar studios have plenty of it. I loved the maturity in the tone of the story, even though it remained a children's' movie all the way through. I'm sure not too many kids would have picked up on the little hints like, *Possible Spoiler* why they were sad in the pregnancy doctor's office, or why Ellie couldn't make it up that hill, etc. But those are the kinds of things that make both children and adults love these movies so much. There is something in it for every single person in the crowd. Everything in the film is well done, but this story is undoubtedly character driven.The characters were all delightful. Carl reminded me so much of my own grandpa. So sad deep inside from the lost of his wife, and so grumpy because of his sadness, but also so caring for others and eager for adventure. Russell, I'll admit he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do. We were supposed to feel what Carl felt. Then over time, as we heard Russell's story and saw how nice of a person he was, we grew to care about him like we did for Carl. Doug and Kevin were great from the start. Even though Doug started off trying to capture Kevin for his master, he was always so sweet and funny that we never disliked him for it. Kevin made me laugh out loud a couple of times, especially when he mimicked Carl. Charles Muntz was an unlikely, yet great villain. He was the sole motivation for Ellie and Carl's fixation on South America, but his dedication to his quest drove him crazy. This was just an all around fantastic movie. The only reason I cannot give it a full score is the little things that I didn't like, like the dogs flew the airplanes and tied Russell up. The explanation for them being able to speak was acceptable, and the fact that they could speak added dimension to them as characters, and ultimately the story itself. But then they did those things that pulled me out of the story. Yeah, I do understand that the whole premise of a floating house, and everything is not really based on anything practical, and nor does it try to pretend that it is possible. Of course it's a children's movie, and they are expected to be like that. I just didn't like those aspects of it, but they didn't take anything away from how brilliant the overall film was. It was a masterpiece. I cannot wait for Toy Story 3, and whatever Pixar has slated after that.",5,Another Beautiful Entry in Pixar's Filmography,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3553,"['be', 'honest', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Up', 'theatres', 'liked', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'say', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Up', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'life', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'voiced', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'perfectly', 'youth', 'golden', 'years', 'montage', 'beginning', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'wonderful', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'most', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'Pixar', 'film', 'date', 'scene', 'set', 'variety', 'moods', 'sad', 'joyous', 'music', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'was', 'perfectly', 'set', 'great', 'score', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'who', 'also', 'blew', 'away', 'Star', 'Trek', 'score', 'opinion', 'Up', 'be', 'best', 'Pixar', 'film', 'yet', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'last', 'couple', 'decades', 'everything', 'make', 'classic', 'saw', 'Up', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'imagined', 'ever', 'saying', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'truth', 'imagination', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'guys', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'studios', 'have', 'plenty', 'loved', 'maturity', 'tone', 'story', 'even', 'remained', 'children', 'movie', 'way', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'little', 'hints', '*Possible', 'Spoiler*', 'why', 'were', 'sad', 'pregnancy', 'doctor', 'office', 'why', 'Ellie', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'hill', 'etc', 'are', 'kinds', 'things', 'make', 'children', 'adults', 'love', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'something', 'single', 'person', 'crowd', 'Everything', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'undoubtedly', 'character', 'driven.The', 'characters', 'were', 'delightful', 'Carl', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'grandpa', 'So', 'sad', 'deep', 'inside', 'lost', 'wife', 'so', 'grumpy', 'sadness', 'also', 'so', 'caring', 'others', 'eager', 'adventure', 'Russell', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'annoyed', 'first', 'soon', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'were', 'supposed', 'feel', 'what', 'Carl', 'felt', 'Then', 'time', 'heard', 'Russell', 'story', 'saw', 'how', 'nice', 'person', 'was', 'grew', 'care', 'did', 'Carl', 'Doug', 'Kevin', 'were', 'great', 'start', 'Even', 'Doug', 'started', 'off', 'trying', 'capture', 'Kevin', 'master', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'sweet', 'funny', 'never', 'disliked', 'Kevin', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'couple', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'mimicked', 'Carl', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'was', 'unlikely', 'yet', 'great', 'villain', 'was', 'sole', 'motivation', 'Ellie', 'Carl', 'fixation', 'South', 'America', 'dedication', 'quest', 'drove', 'crazy', 'was', 'just', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'full', 'score', 'little', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dogs', 'flew', 'airplanes', 'tied', 'Russell', 'up', 'explanation', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'was', 'acceptable', 'fact', 'could', 'speak', 'added', 'dimension', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'story', 'then', 'did', 'things', 'pulled', 'story', 'Yeah', 'do', 'understand', 'whole', 'premise', 'floating', 'house', 'everything', 'not', 'really', 'based', 'anything', 'practical', 'try', 'pretend', 'possible', 'course', 'children', 'movie', 'are', 'expected', 'be', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'aspects', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'how', 'brilliant', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Pixar', 'slated']",N/A

From the beautifully drawn posters to the triumphant end, this film's a winner.Carl Fredricksen (v. by Ed Asner) admired explorers even from boyhood. His particular favorite hero was Charles Muntz (v. by Christopher Plummer) who traveled to Paradise Falls in South America and discovered a new species of bird.  Unfortunately, all he was able to recover was a skeleton.  Scientists examined the skeletal remains and stated the bird was a fake. So, Muntz returned to Paradise Falls in ignominy vowing to find the bird and reclaim his honor.Young Carl was a true believer in Muntz's dream.  So, it turned out was Ellie.  The two adventurers made an instant team and built their dreams together into a marriage.  They always planned to go to Paradise Falls, but life intervened.Then, Ellie died leaving Carl alone in their big house.  We see him embittered and embattled struggling against the encroachment of a new development right next door.An unfortunate accident has Carl declared a menace to society and sent to a retirement home.  But, Carl has other ideas.  He's taking his house with all the treasure of a lifetime and he's using helium balloons tied up in the fireplace and getting out of there...What Carl doesn't know is that he's got a stowaway on the front porch.  Young Russel (v. by Jordan Nagai) is trying to win his Wilderness Scouts badge for assisting the elderly when he gets snared in Carl's scheme.The adventure's begun.  Yes, the two do get to Paradise Falls.  They even find Muntz and some adventure....""Up"" is a multi-generational film that will lift spirits of both young and old.  I'd strongly recommend grandparents taking their kids to see this film.  One thing--while the story looks like it's good for even the very young, the children below 7 in the audience didn't quite understand all the facets in this story.

1209741,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001KVZ6FW,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","Over the years, PIXAR movies have excelled in sprinkling in moments of deep emotion within all the inventive fun.  I remember particularly well the sadness when Jessie the Cowgirl sings about her long lost owner in TOY STORY 2 or the final moment of MONSTERS INC. when Scully sees Boo again (the one moment makes watching the whole movie worthwhile...not that it wasn't already).  WALL E certainly had many touching moments.But Pixar's new UP has them all beat.  There are some moments of such profound emotion that I almost hesitate to call this movie a comedy.  The opening ten minutes nearly caused me to lose my composure altogether!  We meet Carl Fredricksen as a young boy in a movie theater (probably during the early days of the depression), enchanted by the true-life adventures of Charles Muntz, a dashing explorer of the newly discovered Paradise Falls in South America...a man who is fearless, flies a dirigible and is a bit of an inventor too.  Carl is a shy boy, particularly when he meets Ellie, a talkative, high-spirited girl who also idolizes Muntz.  The two become fast friends, Carl silent and admiring, Ellie fast-paced and brave.  Through an extremely well-executed montage, we literally see Carl & Ellie go from young friends, to boyfriend/girlfriend to husband & wife.  We see the path their marriage takes (and we see quite clearly how their dream of one day living at Paradise Falls never comes true) right to its end with Ellie's death.  (This is not a spoiler, in my opinion...I told you WHAT happens in the first 10 minutes, but not HOW...which is key.)  This montage has several touching moments, and the ultimate affect was to leave me feeling very sad...a feeling I couldn't shake for a long time, actually.Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is not a happy widower.  He mostly sits on his porch and watches his once quiet small-town street become part of a sprawling metropolis.  He's the kind of old man that kids always steer clear of.  He carries with him the feeling that he let his beloved Ellie down in life, mostly because he couldn't take them to Paradise Falls.  It's a bitter feeling.Then one day, when he has nothing left to lose...he inflates thousands of helium balloons, attaches them to his house, and floats his entire home away in the hopes of drifting to South America to finally give his house a home there.  It's such an absurd idea, but is beautifully executed (not a big surprise from the visual geniuses at Pixar) and the image of this old wooden house carried by these brightly colored balloons becomes almost iconic.Carl has accidently flown away with a young boyscout named Russell cringing in fear on his front porch.  Since Carl can't toss the unwanted kid overboard, he must bring him inside.That's enough plot.  Carl and Russell have a number of heart-stopping or hilarious adventures...eventually joining forces with a large purple ostrich-like bird named Kevin and best of all, they meet Dug, a simple little dog who has a wonderful collar around his neck that allows his thoughts to be turned into speech.  Pixar & Disney movies have always thrived best when there are some colorful ""side kicks"", and Dug is one of my recent favorites.  Carl and his gang even meet old Charles Muntz, who is not necessarily quite like the man Carl used to admire.UP is one of the best movies I've ever seen about growing and being OLD.  It's not just a movie with an old man as its hero.  It gives us a clear emotional picture of the frailty, the disappointments, the loneliness and the sadness of being an old man.  It also clearly shows that old men can have amazing resources, wisdom and frankly, a lot to offer the world.  Carl had thought his life was nearly over except for waiting around for the actual end.  He discovers this isn't quite true.  For this alone, UP is a movie I dare to call IMPORTANT...because kids are going to see it, and it has the potential  to actually change the way some of its young viewers see their grandparents.It's also a visual treat.  The floating house tops the list of great images, but Pixar does great things with an old dirigible as well.  And if you can see the movie in 3D, that's a plus.  The 3D isn't essential, and there are no moments in the film when you know the director was simply cow-towing to the desire to give us one of those ""in your face"" 3D moments that never quite work anyway.  But the 3D adds loveliness to the experience, and it's worth the extra 3 bucks.This may be the least purely funny Pixar movie.  I laughed at plenty, don't get me wrong.  It's surely funnier than most films...but it's no TOY STORY or RATATOUILLE.  But it is a classic nonetheless.  It's been a few days since I've seen it, and I would happily go again...even though the opening scene (and a few others later in the film) are sure to wrench some tears.  UP takes you on an emotional journey that is as layered and textured as anything you could expect from a film.  Frankly, I don't know how Pixar keeps doing it.  It is truly a company staffed entirely by miracle workers, apparently.Simply put, GO SEE UP!  Now!!",5,10 stars!

Both the quality of their productions and the excellence of their scripts stand out among animated films.  I particularly loved this one because it shatters all previous templates for what a film is supposed to be about.  The main protagonist is a 78-year-old man who bears a resemblance to to Spencer Tracy and his main traveling companion is a young, rotund Asian boy scout.  Along the way they acquire a delightfully absurd and gigantic bird and a talking dog (while I saw this film I was reading Clifford D. Simak's CITY, which features several talking dogs, so for a while talking dogs were a motif in my cultural life).  All of this while attempting to relocate a house carried by thousands of helium-filled balloons to a mythical spot in South America called Paradise Falls.  And the entire affair was prefaced by a story within the story, of the story of Carl and Ellie's long life together.I've yet to see a Pixar movie that wasn't a complete delight.  And as for the appropriateness for small children, I would not hesitate to show it to one.  I think a child will find it entertaining, moving, and inspiring.

It hits a home run for me every time!Those first 5 minutes are so funny and touching.  As kids, Carl and Ellie share a passion for their explorer hero, Charles Muntz, and his voyages to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America.  They marry, with a newlywed goal of actually going there, but life's challenges prevent it from happening.  They have their careers, he as a balloon vendor, and she as an animal trainer, at the local zoo.  Clearly, they love kids, they love people, and they love each other.And then Ellie dies, their fantasy unfulfilled.It's easy to call old, lonely Carl Frederickson a ""curmudgeon,""  and I had this sense from the previews.  However, a curmudgeon is ""an ill-tempered person full of resentment and stubborn notions.""  Okay...maybe he WAS a curmudgeon for a short period!  But most of his life he was not, and he certainly is not a curmudgeon by the end of the story.Carl finds that he is going to be shipped off to Shady Oaks, a relaxing place for seniors to be seen and not heard.  But Carl, with a lifetime of experience handling helium balloons and that fantasy about Paradise Falls, makes other plans.  And the elderly-assisting, snipe-hunting  Russell, a dedicated and enthusiastic (but terribly urban) Wilderness Explorer Scout, finds himself, accidentally, on the same journey.And this is all in the first 10 minutes!Ed Asner is the voice of Carl, and  Jordan Nagai is Russell.  These are well-matched voices with the characters, and the evolution of Carl and Russell throughout this story is touching, comical, and uplifting.  Dug, the speaking dog (it will make sense in the story), is a perfect sidekick - SQUIRREL!So who will like this movie?  If you are not really a fan of animated movies, the unique story may still be worth the investment of time.  It's a movie for all ages, and all cultures.  In fact, you probably have to be dead NOT to enjoy it!Don't let go of your dreams.  Love as if every day is your last.  Look for adventure.  Keep those promises.

There are definitely some aspects of the movie that don't contribute as much as others, and I'm not sure how well it really plays to children as opposed to adults, but two montages in particular were hauntingly powerful for me. I and people I love certainly teared up in certain parts. Yet it's far from depressing, to my mind. It reaffirms that life with people you love--however quiet and unassuming and (sometimes) full of sacrifices--is the ultimate adventure, whether or not it turned out exactly as you might have dreamed. That meaning, and ultimately happiness, in life comes from caring and extending oneself for others, at any age. That older people have an incredible amount to offer, even if they can't do everything they might wish to. That bonds of affection and trust between generations can be strengthening and healing to both. That life doesn't have to end with death or abandonment or old age, so long as you can open yourself up to loving and serving others.For that alone, I think this movie was valuable.",4,Adventuring with Pixar,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1418,"['Welcome', 'world', 'Carl', 'crotchety', 'old', 'widower', 'life', 'passed', 'got', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wanted', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'Russell', 'young', 'deeply', 'lonely', 'kid', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'affection', 'support', 'world', 'adults', 'never', 'seem', 'have', 'time', 'him.Up', 'love', 'loss', 'aging', 'growing', 'up', 'loneliness', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'are', 'definitely', 'aspects', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'as', 'much', 'others', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'really', 'children', 'opposed', 'adults', 'two', 'montages', 'particular', 'were', 'hauntingly', 'powerful', 'people', 'love', 'certainly', 'teared', 'up', 'certain', 'parts', 'far', 'depressing', 'mind', 'life', 'people', 'love', 'however', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'sometimes', 'full', 'sacrifices', 'ultimate', 'adventure', 'not', 'turned', 'out', 'exactly', 'might', 'have', 'dreamed', 'meaning', 'ultimately', 'happiness', 'life', 'caring', 'extending', 'others', 'age', 'older', 'people', 'have', 'incredible', 'amount', 'offer', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'might', 'wish', 'bonds', 'affection', 'trust', 'generations', 'can', 'be', 'strengthening', 'healing', 'life', ""n't"", 'have', 'end', 'death', 'abandonment', 'old', 'age', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'open', 'up', 'loving', 'serving', 'others.For', 'alone', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'valuable']",N/A

Carl is a recent widower who decides to set his house afloat and take it and himself to Paradise Falls, somewhere in South America. Chance has young Boy Scout Russel on the house with him, and when close to their destination both decide to work together to get the house right where it needs to be. In comes Kevin, a massive ostrich/peacockesque creature, along with well-meaning pup Dug, and together the foursome work to beat the evil Charles Muntz who is bent on using Kevin to further his fame.But that's just the plot. Up succeeds so well because of its storytelling power, and how well it balances its light and dark moments. The film moves from its deeply sad prologue to scene after scene incredible imagination. The visuals can't be beat; a house suspended by balloons drifting through the clouds, a chase over a canyon, the characters climbing the walls of a zeppelin. The pacing is also noteworthy- the film never drags and consistently has a new and original turning point to keep it exciting. The film also does an excellent job in dealing with adult love and loss in a manner that is both abrupt and warm, and wouldn't detract its younger viewers from enjoying the film's lighter parts.

Thank God they are not the child of their parent company!Up is fantastical tale of Carl Fredericksen, an old man with nothing left to lose letting go and following his childhood dream. Hitching a ride on Carls flying home is Russell, a young widerness explorer scout and together the mis-matched pair set off in the footsteps of Carls childhood hero, daredevil explorer Charles Muntz (wonderfully voiced by Christopher Plummer), to Paradise Falls in darkest South America.As with Wall-E, Up does not start like a kids movie, adults of an emotive disposition will be in tears within the first 10 minutes and most of the first quarter is scene setting, done, like Wall-E again, with a minimal amount of dialogue. Revealtions, when they come, will also mean more to an adult audience; the very real perception that we are all too busy chasing the dream to realise the dream is what we already have in everyone and everything around us; the moral that one should never meet ones heroes because even heroes are fallable. And, of course, for the kids, the triumph of good and friendship over evil.However, Up is a genuine family film. Pixar have really mastered the balance of enjoyment for all ages and the reward for the little ones to sit patiently through that first quarter is plenty of cute and comical once our heroes land in the jungle. Dug the clueless golden retriever and his pack, Squirrel! and Fred the bird are a joy. Not manic, or over the top, or Disney stupid but well rounded fall guys that you warm to immediately. Subsequent adventures may see septuagenarian Carl turn into some kind of Indiana Jones (the only incongruous note to the film considering his previous incapacitation) but Up is still head and shoulders above anything else produced outside of the Pixar stable. It is beautifully well observed and loaded with deft touches; the animation is, yet again, impeccable.So there are plenty of morals to be taught and lessons to be learnt and good will out etc. etc. But there's talking dogs (dozens more than Bolt (and a dozen times funnier!)), a flying house, a chocolate addicted bird and a crazy scientist explorer. The dark bits are not excessively so and many of the funny bits are laugh-out-loud funny. If it is perhaps, too plodding for younger audiences then that is to Pixars credit for not dumbing down and chasing the pandering parent pound. Up is another addition to their impressive catalogue of genuine family classics.Another great film, a film that's for life, not just the holiday season.",5,"Pixar create another beautiful, timeless...

That is until recently while browsing through channels on my television when I encountered the film rolling its opening credits.  I decided to watch the film, and I must admit, I was completely surprised by what the film had to offer to its viewing audience.The general story of the movie is actually a rather depressing one.  Revolving around an old man by the name of Carl Fredricksen, it begins by depicting the man's childhood.  As a child, Carl was obsessed with exploration, planes, discoveries, and an explorer by the name of Charles Muntz.  He meets a little girl by the name of Ellie, who is basically a female version of Carl.  Like Carl, she has an obsession with exploration and the greatly renowned explorer Charles Muntz.  The two of them make a vow to one day venture to Paradise Falls in South America, the location where their hero Muntz discovered the skeleton of a new species of exotic bird.Years go by, and eventually Carl and Ellie get married.  As time progresses, complications in their lives (such as a miscarriage of their only child) prevent them from ever going to Paradise Falls despite the promise that they made to one another.  Until the one day when Carl decides to purchase flight tickets to South America in order to fulfill his promise to his aging wife.  The two never make it though, seeing how Ellie dies that very same day, leaving Carl alone.One day, Carl meets a Wilderness Explorer by the name of Russell, who wishes to receive his ""Assisting the Elderly Badge"", and asks Carl if there's anything he can do to help him.  After convincing Russell to leave, Carl gets evicted from his home after assaulting a construction worker.  In order to avoid giving up his home, Carl turns his house into a giant hot air balloon, by utilizing thousands of balloons that are tied to the roof.  He begins his journey to Paradise Falls, in order to fulfill his promise to his now deceased wife.What Carl didn't know was that Russell had stowed away on the flying home, and now the two are stuck working together through their adventures in South America.  The two begin to bound, as they fight for their lives and meet new friends, such as Doug the talking dog, and Kevin the giant blue bird.  The story depicts the problems that arise as the group begins to see things turn for the worse with each passing minute.  They all learn to put their differences aside.The film provides great sequences of laugh inducing jokes, many of which come from the group of talking dogs (Doug the Golden Retriever, and Alpha the Doberman Pinscher).  There's plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy and the story touches the audience on several levels.  ""Up"" is a movie that provides such a wide range of emotions that it's sure to please any member of the family, from the young to the young at heart, there's sure to be something in the movie for everyone.  Portions of the film can be cute, others can be funny, while others can be quite sad.The animation is stupendous, and every actor did a great job providing voice-overs for every character.  The plot is original, and the viewers never truly know what is going to happen next.  Overall, Disney did an excellent job providing a child friendly film that can be enjoyed by adults as well.

But we are talking about Pixar here. These are the same people who challenge reality with their 3 Dimensional pixel interpretations of it. So, yeah, the continuous shots way UP there had me a little phobic.It's a little embarrassing really. There I am - a grown man - trying to maintain composure, while surrounded by a bunch of laughing children who no better than I do that it's only a movie.It's only a movie. It's only a movie.Luckily there was plenty of comedy to relax me between my phobic fits. From the trailer you'd think the funniest character in here is the dog with the talking collar. Oh, he's funny alright. But what got me are the old fogies who go at it. Who knows if Pixar will get an Academy Award for this one. But there should be some kind of trophy for being the first company to animate two cranky geezers putting the smack down on each other.One of these cranks is Carl Fredricksen, who goes on a last second honeymoon balloon ride to Paradise Island. His co-pilot is a boyscout who effectively overlooks or just plain ignores Carl's crusty exterior. They make it to Paradise Island alright. That's where they find ""Dog"" (that's his name), and this other old crank who has been there long before them. Two cranks as neighbors, even in Paradise, never works. So the fighting begins.

1209792,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B001KVZ6FW,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[0, 0]","I am a constant fan of of Pixar, have been since their breakout hit Toy Story all the way back in 1995 when i was only 14 years old.  I've grown up with these films, and I've never missed one in theaters.  I have always been amazed at how fantastic the animation in all their films are, and how heartwarming they are as well.I will admit that in the past few years I've been somewhat disappointed with the fair coming from Pixar, I was not a fan of Cars or Ratatouille and all though it was a FANTASTIC action film I felt that The Incredibles missed the mark somehow, but last year with the release of the phenomenal Wall*e, they once again proved that they have what it takes to make a good film.  Not to say that the above mentioned were not good, in fact just the opposite. I loved all of them, it was just that with the likes of Toy Story 2, Monster's Inc, and the pitch perfect Finding Nemo under their belt the aformentioned three seemed a bit less than.And now with UP, Pixar proves that their ""less than"" era is good and gone. UP tells the story of Carl Fredrickson a 78 year old retired balloon salesman, whom after the death of his beloved wife Ellie finds himself lost and desperately alone.  With the BIG city doing it's best to crush his tiny world in on him and label him a menace by forcing him out of his home; all he has left of his life with Ellie, he hatches a plan to take himself and his home to South America to Paradise Falls to make his and Ellie's dream of visiting there come true.You'd think all would go as planned, and to begin it does. Then Carl finds himself stuck with young Russell, a stowaway cub scout on his hot air home.  Together they find themselves on an adventure much different than they had thought.  Enter a group of talking dogs. On one end of  the group the  goofy and lovable Dug, at the other the creepy and menacing Alpha...well, except the voice. (see the film and you'll catch my drift) Add a giant flightless bird that Russell names Kevin, and throw Carls childhood adventuring hero into the mix and you have a fantastic and at times suspenseful adventure.The animation, once again is top notch, I was not able to see it in 3D so I'm not able to give a heads up on how it is in 3D, but it looks fantastic in 2D just the same.  The balloons that Carl attaches to his house look so real, and in wider shots showing the whole of the floating house the balloons have lives of their own.  I would love to know what kind of program they used to give each balloon it's own individual trajectory.  The character animation looks fantastic particularly on Kevin and the dogs.  Kevin looks like a real bird and moves like one as well, ""it's"" fluid movements and birdlike qualities suck you in and make you believe ""it's"" truly there.  The dogs, mostly pitbulls, dobberman pincher's, rottweillers, and a few labs, look awesome as well.  They are given a slight cartoonish flair; but for the most part look and move and even act like real dogs.  Dug, is a wonder of animation, his movement's are so lifelike even more so than the rest of the pack of dogs.  When he is punished and tucks his tail and lowers his head it looks like a real dog! Carl, Russell, Ellie and Muntz look fantastic as well; each with their own shape and animation quarks.  Carl with his Cary Grant face and golf balled walker, Russell with his yellow scout suit and HUGE backpack, Ellie with her beautiful smile and expressive eyes and Muntz; well watch the movie to find out about who he is and what he's like.  And the landscapes are fantastic! The rainforest type areas are astonishing to look at, as are the city scapes and even the barren rock structures.The music is fantastic as well, it's simple, whimsical and filled with a sweetness that conveys what the film is about, adventure and love.  From the sad, emotional parts to the funny parts, to the fast paced action, and creepy suspenseful parts, the music flows with the film.  It does what the background music should do, be in the background.  It makes each moment all the more wonderful.But, the thing that I love most about the film; is it's heart.  The first 15 minutes of the film showing Carl's meeting Ellie and their marriage and life together is done so wonderfully. It has no vocals, just a beautiful and whimsical tune to take you on their life journey. My father passed away a few years ago, so my mother was very touched by this sequence; the way they focused on Carl and Ellie just sitting and holding hands, or Carl dusting and glimpsing her and stopping to just stare at what he has been blest with.  I'm giving nothing away when I say that when Ellie dies my mother and I both were close to tears.  It's this emotional resonance that makes this film so amazing.  Ellie is in the film physically all of 15 minutes but her presence and spirit dominate the film more so than any other character in it.  UP truly is a love story, pure and simple.  It's all so a story about finding your place in new and unwanted circumstances, and finding something inside yourself you thought was not there.  It is a fantastic and beautiful film in every way.For parents.  There are a few sequences that may frighten smaller children, the large pack of dogs are a bit creepy early on in the film, as are a few other scenes with said dogs.  Also a few other scenes of peril may have them asking questions of ""why is so and so doing so and so?""  For slightly older kids there are elements of death, divorce and abandonment in the film as well that may have your children wondering, so be ready for questions. I still feel that the film is fine for all kids 1 to 100!",5,Fun...Funny...and ultimately Touching.,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,5636,"['am', 'constant', 'fan', 'Pixar', 'have', 'been', 'breakout',

I can see it winning for technical animation for the graphics though.  The dogs are a lot of fun, the story at the beginning is interesting, though the overall story in general is pretty shallow. I would say that the first 3/4 of the movie is very good.  They do seem to make a considerable mistake in the latter part of the film in trying to turn it into a action film.  There are better animated films out there (ie: Toy Story, Meet the Robinsons, The Incredibles, Bolt etc), but Up is an enjoyable enough film, it's just not an all-time great movie or anything, it's a little above average.",3,"Overrated, a good, but not great movie",1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,704,"['Up', 'considerably', 'overated', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'deserve', 'best', 'picture', 'awards', 'such', 'thing', 'can', 'see', 'winning', 'technical', 'animation', 'graphics', 'dogs', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'story', 'beginning', 'interesting', 'overall', 'story', 'general', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'would', 'say', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'seem', 'make', 'considerable', 'mistake', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'trying', 'turn', 'action', 'film', 'are', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'there', 'ie', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'Incredibles', 'Bolt', 'etc', 'Up', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'all-time', 'great', 'movie', 'anything', 'little', 'above', 'average']",N/A

1209796,A1PPOI55JO8VU1,B001KVZ6FW,S.Papstein,"[1, 2]","(notice 3 stars is not a bad score! I would give it a 7.5)Pixar has established itself in the movie industry as the premire animation studio. Unrivaled in nearly every category from original concepts, to deep symbloism, to energetic color, and detailed animation, Pixar is nearing legendary status. You have to tip your hats to a studio that packs such quality and passion on a yearly base. The latest installment, Up, capitalizes on many of the stellar qualities Pixar has be known for.Up's greatest trait is how it uses animation. Pixar Studios continue to amaze me with the extreme detail and color used in their films. Lush, vivid palate of colors pop and shine through the film. The crisp animations put in Up are truly a site to see. Using wilderness to their advantage, Pixar paints beautiful vistas with their South American backdrop.Thematically, Up's story keeps Pixar's wonderful reputation of giving strong social comentary and overarching alligories. Matching the strength of Cars and Wall-E, Up holds more than its own  in depth. Up's message turned to be more entertaining than the plot was. Pixar delved into the absurdity realm one too many times for me to think of Up as a true masterpiece. As enjoyable as it was, Up transformed into more of a ""Saturday morning cartoon"" at pivital points where it could have achieved greatness. The opening third of the movie was some of the best story-telling and direction I have seen the company produce, and the ending was very heart-warming. It's a shame that the middle section could not keep the same greatness in story. It was a par movie, plot wise, but I couldn't help but think Pixar mixed to many concepts together.Pixar Studios has produced fine film. Up meets, and pushes past, many of Pixar's renown movie making qualities. Animation? Brilliant. Concept? Fantastic. Story? Janky in the middle, but superb on the inside and out. Exicution? As you've came to expect. This may not be Pixar in it's prime, but missing any Pixar film would be tragic.",3,"Not Sky-High, But It Has Lifted Off The Ground",1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,2013,"['notice', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'bad', 'score', 'would', 'give', '7.5', 'Pixar', 'established', 'movie', 'industry', 'premire', 'animation', 'studio', 'Unrivaled', 'nearly', 'category', 'original', 'concepts', 'deep', 'symbloism', 'energetic', 'color', 'detailed', 'animation', 'Pixar', 'nearing', 'legendary', 'status', 'have', 'tip', 'hats', 'studio', 'such', 'quality', 'passion', 'yearly', 'base', 'latest', 'installment', 'Up', 'many', 'stellar', 'qualities', 'Pixar', 'be', 'known', 'for.Up', 'greatest', 'trait', 'how', 'animation', 'Pixar', 'Studios', 'continue', 'amaze', 'extreme', 'detail', 'color', 'used', 'films', 'Lush', 'vivid', 'palate', 'colors', 'pop', 'shine', 'film', 'crisp', 'animations', 'put', 'Up', 'are', 'truly', 'site', 'see', 'Using', 'wilderness', 'advantage', 'Pixar', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'South', 'American', 'backdrop.Thematically', 'Up', 'story', 'Pixar', 'wonderful', 'reputation', 'giving', 'strong', 'social', 'comentary', 'overarching', 'alligories', 'Matching', 'strength', 'Cars', 'Wall-E', 'Up', 'more', 'own', 'depth', 'Up', 'message', 'turned', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'was', 'Pixar', 'delved', 'absurdity', 'realm', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'think', 'Up', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'As', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'Up', 'transformed', 'more', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'pivital', 'points', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'greatness', 'opening', 'third', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'story-telling', 'direction', 'have', 'seen', 'company', 'produce', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'heart-warming', 'shame', 'middle', 'section', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'same', 'greatness', 'story', 'was', 'par', 'movie', 'plot', 'wise', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Pixar', 'mixed', 'many', 'concepts', 'together.Pixar', 'Studios', 'produced', 'fine', 'film', 'Up', 'meets', 'pushes', 'many', 'Pixar', 'renown', 'movie', 'making', 'qualities', 'Animation', 'Brilliant', 'Concept', 'Fantastic', 'Story', 'Janky', 'middle', 'superb', 'inside', 'Exicution', ""'ve"", 'came', 'expect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Pixar', 'prime', 'missing', 'Pixar', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'tragic']",N/A

I was completely surprised at how touching and emotional this movie was for me as an adult. I expected the usual level of ""Disney cute"" - and I got it to the extreme, but I had no idea how deep this movie would go to pull at my heart strings. I've never cried when watching a cartoon, but I cried several times during this movie.Towards the beginning of the movie, without giving anything away, I'll just say that you watch something deeply beautiful unfold, and then something deeply sad happens. Young children most likely won't even realize what happened, but adults will get it. It was done so well, that it was really touching. By the end of the movie I was crying because I was so touched and uplifted. It was more moving than many adult movies I've seen lately, and so well done. There was ultimately some very positive messages in this movie. I was surprised at how meaningful it was.Then there was the whimsy. What a creative story. It was truly a work of visual art, and a wonderful, well-written and conceived original fantasy. There was so much creative genius - from the house carried away by balloons to the collar on the dogs that could make them talk. There were many surprises that had me laughing gleefully. There was sensational character development. In fact, I found myself really caring about what happened to them. The writers and animators have an uncanny ability to make the characters just so cute! The actors did a fantastic job as well.All I can say is that I loved this movie. It was precious, adorable, beautiful and so worth seeing for adults and children alike.

The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.The Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):DISC 1: (BD)* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.DISC 2: (BD)Documentaries* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was ""egg"" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.Extras* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.* Screen Saver option.DISC 3 (DVD)* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.DISC 4 (Digital Copy).* Code both unlocks the copy and gets you the usual points at the Disney site.Overall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage.

1209803,A2QW2V285U824L,B001KVZ6FW,"Steven Bailey ""Cinemaven""","[1, 2]","UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away - because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise - is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting - perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that - at least in the audience I was in - when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie - particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action - nothing off-color in the least.

I still think the movie's strength is in the first 15 minutes or so, but the ending is more effective and emotional than I had remembered.Up is a strangely unique film in that it has very well-defined characters, but not a very engaging storyline. The two heros, Carl Fredericksen and Russell, are brought to life so vividly and organically, they are literally three-dimensional personalities.Russell, one of the most delightful creations to come out of Pixar Animation Studios, is perhaps more interesting because so much of his tragic backstory is hidden, and we hear just pieces of it. He throws in comments like how his father doesn't have time for him anymore, or how his mother won't let him have a pet, but these clearly sad circumstances are expressed with the earnestness and surface-level indifference that a young boy would have in real life.Where the movie lets us down is in its overall narrative; there are many amusing scenes with the exotic ""snipe"" bird Kevin and the talking dog Dug, but the whole conflict surrounding Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz is, to me at least, not particularly interesting or compelling. It seems to slow down the ""real"" story, of Carl and Russell, rather than contribute to it.Fortunately, this doesn't take up too much of the movie - the last 15 minutes or so bookends the stellar opening with their life back in the city, and how their friendship continues even after their adventure. Up, at times, is painfully moving and emotional, which unfortunately gets lost in some extraneous narrative.

No headaches either. In short, the movie was funny, charming, lovable characters, heartwarming, well written, clever and the animation was outstanding. A couple of little PC lessons were in the movie but not enough to mention. I did like the overall theme of the importants of a man in a child's life. Seems us men get villainized more then we get endorsed.Due to the PG rating I did not bring my 3 year old with me. There were a few short scary scenes that would have bothered him but most of the movie would be considered G rated. Because we do not have TV at home my son is not used to (or desensitized to) violence or intense movie scenes but if your child is accustomed to it I think this PG movie should be okay for them. It really was very mild.The short was also amusing. Not their best but entertaining non-the-less.Note: As great a character as Dug the dog is it's not an original idea.

But of course what really shines is the touching story of an old man that was never able to re-visit the vacation spot that he and his wife have always wanted to visit. Pixar has an amazing ability to make mature stories that adults can enjoy and relate to, but tell them in such a way that kids enjoy them as well.On the surface a ""kids"" movie that centers on a senior citizen is not a kid's cup of tea so to speak.

Playful humor and bouts of heartfelt poignancy combine with quite a bit of unexpected adventure to produce a film that will easily appeal to minds both young and old, and those that have never forgotten the allure of chasing dreams.Ever since he was a young boy, Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) has craved the excitement and adventure of exploration - a passion shared by his childhood friend and sweetheart, Ellie. After marrying, the couple always planned to travel to a remote paradise deep within South America, but continual setbacks forever delayed their journey. Now, at the age of 78, Carl is finally able to fulfill his lifelong dream, and in a daring flight he takes to the skies in his balloon-lifted house. But his adventure has only just begun...With Pixar's unbelievably successful track record, it's considerably more impressive seeing their films continue to be of such a high caliber, general appeal and repeat-viewing sensibility. Up is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining of Pixar's films, and one of the best the computer animated film genre has to offer. With an unlikely set of heroes, hopelessly romantic fantasy, suspenseful action, a beautiful score and a completely outlandish, unique plot, Up captures the spirit of adventure wholeheartedly.Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of Up, as with most of Pixar's films, is the blend of lighthearted comedy with insight and sentiment. There's plenty of comic relief, but the heavier ""growing old"" montage at the beginning and the later meaningful fulfillment of dreams and sacrifices for grander causes creates a deeper, satisfying resonance. The simple repetition of significant actions, such as tying a letter to a balloon, making promises by crossing the heart or toying with a grape soda pin (and even the idiosyncratic straightening of a bird figurine) suggests heartbreaking affectivity that further deepens the classical romance that fuels Carl's motives for adventure. Up is a film with something for everyone and definitely worthy of repeat viewings.- The Massie Twins",4,Up Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,2187,"['Pixar', 'once', 'again', 'crafted', 'truly', 'magical', 'journey', 'fantastical', 'land', 'full', 'brightly-colored', 'creations', 'comical', 'explorers', 'Playful', 'humor', 'bouts', 'heartfelt', 'poignancy', 'combine', 'bit', 'unexpected', 'adventure', 'produce', 'film', 'will', 'easily', 'appeal', 'minds', 'young', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'allure', 'chasing', 'dreams.Ever', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'craved', 'excitement', 'adventure', 'exploration', 'passion', 'shared', 'childhood', 'friend', 'sweetheart', 'Ellie', 'marrying', 'couple', 'always', 'planned', 'travel', 'remote', 'paradise', 'deep', 'South', 'America', 'continual', 'setbacks', 'forever', 'delayed', 'journey', 'Now', 'age', '78', 'Carl', 'finally', 'able', 'fulfill', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'daring', 'flight', 'skies', 'balloon-lifted', 'house', 'adventure', 'only', 'just', 'begun', 'Pixar', 'unbelievably', 'successful', 'track', 'record', 'considerably', 'more', 'impressive', 'seeing', 'films', 'continue', 'be', 'such', 'high', 'caliber', 'general', 'appeal', 'repeat-viewing', 'sensibility', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'Pixar', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'genre', 'offer', 'unlikely', 'set', 'heroes', 'hopelessly', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'beautiful', 'score', 'completely', 'outlandish', 'unique', 'plot', 'Up', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'wholeheartedly.Perhaps', 'most', 'rewarding', 'aspect', 'Up', 'most', 'Pixar', 'films', 'blend', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'insight', 'sentiment', 'plenty', 'comic', 'relief', 'heavier', 'growing', 'old', 'montage', 'beginning', 'later', 'meaningful', 'fulfillment', 'dreams', 'sacrifices', 'grander', 'causes', 'deeper', 'satisfying', 'resonance', 'simple', 'repetition', 'significant', 'actions', 'such', 'tying', 'letter', 'balloon', 'making', 'promises', 'crossing', 'heart', 'toying', 'grape', 'soda', 'pin', 'even', 'idiosyncratic', 'straightening', 'bird', 'figurine', 'heartbreaking', 'affectivity', 'further', 'classical', 'romance', 'Carl', 'motives', 'adventure', 'Up', 'film', 'something', 'everyone', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'repeat', 'viewings.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

One of the ones that a grown-up can watch without ever being tempted to reach for the remote to  see what else is on.Beneath a predictable but nevertheless fairly well executed adventure, this story tells the tale of how its protagonists come to terms with their own inner pain, and move on to embrace what life yet has to offer them. In this it's hardly unique: let's face it, the same could be said of virtually everything Hollywood produces.What makes this movie is how well it achieves this.

1209820,A11R3N5VU1SE04,B001KVZ6FW,Theo,"[0, 0]","Pixar movies are like kids and parents.  You love 'em all.  But Up has a wonderful moral that sets it apart.Carl Fredrickson is a curmudgeonly 78 year old widower weighed down by a broken promise made to his deceased wife Ellie when they were children to take her to the faraway Paradise Falls discovered by their hero, explorer Charles Muntz, in a baloon.If there has ever been a character like Ellie in cinema, I've never seen her.  An adventurous tomboy that grows up into a lovely young lady and loving wife to Carl.  It's impossible not to fall in love with her.  And though most of her time onscreen is a wordless montage of her life with Carl at the beginning of the film, you'll miss her the rest of the movie, just as Carl does.When commercial development forces him out of his shell following Ellie's death, Carl keeps his promise to Ellie, taking off in their home, lifted by thousands of helium-filled baloons to South America and Paradise Falls.  Along the way, an inconvienent stoway--a fellow wounded soul, 8 year old boy-scout Russell--inadvertantly teaches Carl (with the help of a wonderful message left by Ellie) the wonderful, life affirming lesson that what matters in life is having each other.  Russell draws the fun Carl out of curmudgeonly Carl, and you can see the man Ellie fell in love with, and understand why she considered her life with him all she ever needed.Amazingly, the movie itself tracks this theme.  Though it's all entertaining, and has its excitement, what you'll remember most is the montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the time Carl and Russell spend together, respectively filling the holes in their lives left by loved ones.Dog lovers will appreciate Dug, a dog that Carl and Russell meet along the way that can talk with the aid of a specialized collar. Any dog owner that's ever wondered what their persistently happy (albeit easily distracted--Squirrel!!) dog is thinking will thank Pixar for explaining.Kids will love it, but it's adults that will (hopefully) get the message.The Blu Ray 4 disc edition contains some extras:Partly Cloudy--Everyone knows where babies come from...storks!  Partly Cloudy explains where storks get them.A ""Dug"" Short--Wouldn't have fit in the movie, but I'm glad it's on the DVD.Both of these are on the regular edition of the DVD, but Up should be seen in Blu Ray.There's a nice backstory to the Married Life montage of Carl and Ellie's life together.  It's interesting to see what made it and didn't make it from the original storyboards.  Maybe I was prejudiced by the movie, because I saw it first, but I'm glad the evolution of ideas led Pixar to what's in the film.",5,Perfect,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2661,"['Pixar', 'movies', 'are', 'kids', 'parents', 'love', 'Up', 'wonderful', 'moral', 'apart.Carl', 'Fredrickson', 'curmudgeonly', '78', 'year', 'old', 'widower', 'weighed', 'down', 'broken', 'promise', 'made', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'take', 'faraway', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'discovered', 'hero', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'baloon.If', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'character', 'Ellie', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'adventurous', 'tomboy', 'up', 'lovely', 'young', 'lady', 'loving', 'wife', 'Carl', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'most', 'time', 'onscreen', 'wordless', 'montage', 'life', 'Carl', 'beginning', 'film', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'Carl', 'does.When', 'commercial', 'development', 'forces', 'shell', 'following', 'Ellie', 'death', 'Carl', 'promise', 'Ellie', 'taking', 'off', 'home', 'lifted', 'thousands', 'helium-filled', 'baloons', 'South', 'America', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'way', 'inconvienent', 'stoway', 'fellow', 'wounded', 'soul', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy-scout', 'Russell', 'inadvertantly', 'Carl', 'help', 'wonderful', 'message', 'left', 'Ellie', 'wonderful', 'life', 'affirming', 'lesson', 'what', 'matters', 'life', 'having', 'other', 'Russell', 'fun', 'Carl', 'curmudgeonly', 'Carl', 'can', 'see', 'man', 'Ellie', 'fell', 'love', 'understand', 'why', 'considered', 'life', 'ever', 'needed.Amazingly', 'movie', 'theme', 'entertaining', 'excitement', 'what', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'most', 'montage', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'life', 'together', 'time', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'spend', 'together', 'respectively', 'filling', 'holes', 'lives', 'left', 'loved', 'ones.Dog', 'lovers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Dug', 'dog', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'meet', 'way', 'can', 'talk', 'aid', 'specialized', 'collar', 'dog', 'owner', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'persistently', 'happy', 'easily', 'distracted', 'Squirrel', 'dog', 'thinking', 'will', 'thank', 'Pixar', 'explaining.Kids', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'will', 'hopefully', 'get', 'message.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', '4', 'disc', 'edition', 'extras', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'Everyone', 'where', 'babies', 'come', 'storks', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'where', 'storks', 'get', 'them.A', 'Dug', 'Short', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DVD.Both', 'are', 'regular', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Up', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'Blu', 'Ray.There', 'nice', 'backstory', 'Married', 'Life', 'montage', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'life', 'together', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'original', 'storyboards', 'Maybe', 'was', 'prejudiced', 'movie', 'saw', 'first', ""'m"", 'glad', 'evolution', 'ideas', 'led', 'Pixar', 'what', 'film']",N/A

Is it the best?"" I'm not sure it's the best, but it is a superb piece of filmmaking.Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, a widower, who still lives in the tiny brightly colored clapboard house he and his wife spent their marriage in. Now that he no longer has his wife and best friend with him, he spends his days thinking about the past and watching his neighborhood become a very different place. A huge development is growing around him and Carl is being pressured to sell his house to the developer. One afternoon, Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby Wilderness Explorer, rings his bell and wants to help Carl with something, anything, to achieve his Senior Assistance badge, the last badge he needs to become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. But Carl is grumpy and doesn't need anything and only wants to be left alone. One morning, Carl reveals he has tied thousands of helium balloons to his house and rigged a navigation system and sets off to find the fabled Paradise Falls in South America, a place he and his wife always wanted to visit. After he takes off, and begins to enjoy the solitude, there is a knock at the door. Russell has returned and unwittingly become a guest for the journey. When they eventually make it to South America, they meet Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl's boyhood idol, and a disgraced adventurer who is still searching for a rare breed of bird, a bird that looks like a cross between a pelican and a dodo bird. Carl and Russell inadvertently befriend the bird and a dog-named Dug (Bob Peterson) wearing a collar provided by Muntz, which allows him to speak.""Up"" is a perfect film. The characters are interesting, funny, believable and human. The story is touching, brilliant, funny and human. It isn't often a film can make you cry one moment and then burst out with a guffaw of laughter the next. Many live action films have difficulty creating genuine emotions like this. When you are watching an animated film that manages to accomplish this, you realize you are experiencing something special.We first meet Carl as a young boy as he watches a newsreel about his hero, Muntz. On his way home, he walks past an abandoned old house and finds a tomboy, Ellie playing inside. Ellie is everything Carl isn't and they become friends. In a brief, silent montage, we watch many of the key moments in their life, including the moment they decide to start saving their loose change to buy tickets to visit Paradise Falls, a place they both fell in love with because of Muntz's adventures there. But like most married couples, there are setbacks, bills to pay. This sequence is so true to life, so sweet and so moving that it catches us off guard and manages to create some really emotionally jarring moments for us. This may seem strange for an animated film, but Pixar doesn't just create animated films. They are always going for something else, something more interesting and more memorable. I have said before that even ""just OK"" Pixar films are heads and shoulders above most other studio fare and most animated films can't even come close to achieving the same level of skill and storytelling. Pixar is the king of animation and if the studios don't watch out, they just may become the King. Period.As a lonely old widower, Carl (voiced by Ed Asner, the star of ""Lou Grant"" and ""Mary Tyler Moore"") does what you might expect a lonely old man to do. He goes about his routine and sits a lot, remembering the past. He and Ellie clearly loved one another and he still clearly cherishes the mementos of their life together. Particularly touching is a handmade badge he has worn ever since Ellie gave it to them when they were kids.When Russell shows up on his doorstep, Carl's first instinct is to rudely brush him off. But Russell is determined to get his last badge, and ultimately his promotion, and won't take no for an answer, shoving his foot in the door like a salesman. Returning a few days later, Russell unwittingly becomes a guest along for the journey. As they make their way south, Russell and Carl learn more about each other. Carl, grumpy and surly as he is, finds he needs to help the young Wilderness Explorer. But does Russell end up helping Carl?This is not the funniest Pixar film ever, but it achieves a more interesting balance of emotions. It isn't often that you find yourself crying during an emotional scene and a few minutes later, laughing your head off. Between these two extremes of emotion, we spend a lot of time with Russell and Carl and watch as their relationship grows and expands. All of this makes them distinctly believable, distinctly human. And they are animated characters.Russell is a persistent kid, a self-effacing kid, who likes to talk. As he talks, he reveals a lot about his life. Carl is an introspective old man, a lonely old man and a man of few words. Basically, they are complete opposites. But because Carl is quiet, he listens, and as he and Russell journey to South America, he learns a lot about the Wilderness Explorer. Even more interesting than what we learn about the young boy is how we realize Carl has learned something. Carl makes a small gesture, or his eyes widen. These are very subtle moments, but they work because they make Carl seem so lifelike.When they arrive in South America, they find Dug (Bob Peterson), a dog that has been trained by Muntz to help him find the fabled birdlike creature he has been hunting for. Muntz has, in fact, trained many dogs, and supplied them with special collars allowing them to speak. Dug is a bit of a loser compared to the other dogs, a dumb but very affectionate dog, he has been cast off on a mission of his own by the other dogs in his pack. They are much more daring and pack-oriented. Dug is more of a house pet. They can't stand him and know they would be better off without him. Interestingly, this is exactly the same ploy Carl uses early in the film to get rid of Russell.As they move along, dragging Carl's floating house to his prized position near Paradise Falls, Dug excitedly joins them, eager for the companionship and the attention.He also wants to be close to them because one of the birds has already become friends with Russell. But Dug doesn't really present a threat to the bird and they continue on their merry way.Until Carl and his crew come across Muntz (Plummer). Muntz has spent the last half-century searching through South America for the bird. He stores his huge airship in a cave and lives very much like Captain Nemo. Initially, Carl is thrilled to meet his childhood idol, but when he realizes he wants to capture the bird they have befriended, his feelings change and he tries to protect his new feathered friend.Muntz, who has spent so many years searching for the bird, clearly doesn't want to let the bird go and will do anything in his power to capture the bird. But Carl, Russell and Dug have some tricks up their sleeve to throw a few roadblocks in his path. Plummer does a great job of giving Muntz just the right amount of menace, respectability and loopiness.The addition of the trained dogs is brilliant. Dug and the others add a lot of fun to the story and the opportunity for some brilliant visual puns.""Up"" is a brilliant animated effort, often achieving the same level of storytelling and skill many live action filmmakers can only dream of.As usual, there is a new Pixar animated short before the film. ""Partly Cloudy"" is especially charming and reminds me of some of the classic animated cartoons Disney made in the 40s. A bedraggled stork has to put up with the exotic babies his cloud creates for him to deliver, longing for a cute puppy or kitten instead of the mix of dangerous and funny animals his cloud creates for him.

The choices they made to go with this story are just too dry and made up as it went, like the Mad Libs of Pixar movies. Carl is going to fly to South America in...a house. Ok, err..Carl and Russel face an army of...dogs. There's not enough dialogue, though I admit more than Pixar's last film, WALL-E, but whoever wrote the script was not putting much effort into this. The relationship between Carl and Russel is bland and uninteresting. Carl is a typical old man, and Russel is a typical little boy. I think I have seen this relationship before. I don't mind seeing it again, but it has to at least be interesting ,but it was not. Yes, they have pasts and problems but they're still not interesting. I have to admit Dug's ""please be my prisoner"" line is catchy and the alpha's chipmunk voice was funny, but it's not enough to save the movie. Now how about that villain?

1209825,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001KVZ6FW,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 3]","Pixar makes adult movies that are family friendly. It is a grand tradition that Disney has had a grip on since the days ofOld YellerorBambi. That tradition continues with ""Up,"" a film that is one part melodrama, one part adventure film and just a smidgen of buddy-movie. It is also 100% Pixar.Ed Asner gives voice to Carl Fredricksen, an adventure obsessed man who, along with his beloved wife, Ellie, were fans of explorer Carl Muntz. But Muntz vanished in disgrace when he is accused of falsifying the discovery or a new species in the mysterious Paradise Falls. That doesn't matter to the young Carl and Ellie, who make a vow to get to Paradise Falls one day. In the film's most poignant segment and its main opener, Carl and Ellie marry and you watch their life together unfold. This, again, is why Pixar excels at movie making. Their life is wonderful and filled with love, at the same time, it is heartbreaking. You watch as grow old together, dreaming of their adventure together and working at the zoo that serves as a surrogate. And when Ellie begins to falter before Carl can make her dream come true, there wasn't a dry eye over 30 in the audience.Carl, now a widowed septuagenarian, soon finds himself in a world he no longer understands, and decides to make one more desperate attempt at making it to Paradise Falls. Stowaway Russell and Carl are soon floating on a house heading for South America. But Carl Muntz, still bitter and a bit mad from decades searching for his lost bird, is there and doesn't want anyone stopping him from taking his discovery away. Carl, Russell, Dug the talking dog must save ""Kevin"" and get Carl's home to its final destination before Muntz destroys everything.It's a fun movie and more than a little dangerous (ifThe Incredibleswas too much for you, then stay home from this), as Pixar depicts Carl and Russell evolving from a ""get off my lawn"" curmudgeon and somewhat naive and gawky kid into friends. Dug the Dog and the rest of the talking animals are the comic relief (""the cone of shame"" alone was worth the price of admission). And when the line ""Now go have one of your own"" appears, if you don't get a lump in your throat, then I don't know why you're reading this review in the first place.""Up"" is sentimental and wildly imaginative. Movies that touches on love, life, loss and adventure are hard to come by, and once again, Pixar captures it eloquently.

In my opinion, just like ""Watchmen"" is not a comic (similar to Wall-e), ""Up"" is a genre's step towards maturation.Pixar has been doing this ever since they came up with Toy Story (probably still my favorite of them all). They knew that half of their audience were the parents that had to sit for 90 minutes in the movie theater with their kids and while trying to not get them bored they started adding bits of adult references to their films. And now, the final step has been taken. In my opinion, ""Up"" is more of an adult movie then a children's animation film.And it is good.

Ellie tells Carl of her dream e to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep.As adults Carl (Edward Asner) and Ellie wed in the same house where they first met He makes a living as a toy balloon vendor and she is a zookeeper.Unable to have children, they try instead to save up for that trip to Paradise Falls. Just as they seem to finally be able to take their trip, Ellie dies of old age, leaving Carl alone, becoming a bitter old man. Soon, the city grows around Carl's house with construction. Carl refuses to move. After confronting a construction worker (Pixar fave John Ratzenberger) over a broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into Shady Oaks Retirement Home. He comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and uses his old professional supplies to create a makeshift airship using ten thousand helium balloons which lift his house off its foundations.Little does he know that Russell, (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a l snipe hunt by Carl the day before.After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine, hoping to reach the falls while there's still enough helium in the balloons to keep the house afloat...Written and directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, the film will make you laugh cheer and even tug at your emotions a bit--In fact. it's those very adult themes of of loneliness and loss that provided the film's biggest surprise--The trailers for the feature gave absolutely no indication that a film featuring balloons would be--especially in the first half hour so heavy...Nothing wrong with that mind you--just not what I expected from Pixar--And anyone seeing the film with small kids may need to answer some questions afterwards...Asner an industry legend, is perfect as the voice of Carl....While no one has a voice quite like Plummer....Large birds and mean dogs figure in as well.UP is a very enjoyabbe trip that in the end--will lift your spirits.",5,Tugger,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2736,"['Pixar', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'latest', 'effort', 'UP', 'lot', 'what', 'audiences', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'films', 'able', 'fun', 'characters', 'eye-popping', 'animated', 'visuals', 'said', 'UP', 'also', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'unique', 'different', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'Jeremy', 'Leary', 'introverted', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'extroverted', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Ellie', 'Elie', 'Docter', 'Soon', 'realize', 'share', 'passion', 'adventures', 'hero', 'famed', 'explorer', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Ellie', 'Carl', 'dream', 'e', 'move', 'clubhouse', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'South', 'America', 'promise', 'Carl', 'keep.As', 'adults', 'Carl', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'Ellie', 'wed', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'first', 'met', 'living', 'toy', 'balloon', 'vendor', 'zookeeper.Unable', 'have', 'children', 'try', 'instead', 'save', 'up', 'trip', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'Just', 'seem', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'trip', 'Ellie', 'old', 'age', 'leaving', 'Carl', 'alone', 'becoming', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'Soon', 'city', 'Carl', 'house', 'construction', 'Carl', 'move', 'confronting', 'construction', 'worker', 'Pixar', 'fave', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'broken', 'mailbox', 'court', 'orders', 'Carl', 'move', 'Shady', 'Oaks', 'Retirement', 'Home', 'up', 'scheme', 'keep', 'promise', 'Ellie', 'old', 'professional', 'supplies', 'create', 'makeshift', 'airship', 'using', 'ten', 'thousand', 'helium', 'balloons', 'lift', 'house', 'foundations.Little', 'know', 'Russell', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'Wilderness', 'Explorer', 'trying', 'earn', 'Assisting', 'Elderly', 'badge', 'stowed', 'away', 'porch', 'being', 'sent', 'l', 'snipe', 'hunt', 'Carl', 'day', 'before.After', 'storm', 'around', 'while', 'find', 'large', 'ravine', 'facing', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'body', 'weight', 'providing', 'ballast', 'allowing', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'pull', 'floating', 'house', 'two', 'begin', 'walk', 'ravine', 'hoping', 'reach', 'falls', 'still', 'enough', 'helium', 'balloons', 'keep', 'house', 'afloat', 'Written', 'directed', 'Pete', 'Docter', 'Bob', 'Peterson', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'cheer', 'even', 'tug', 'emotions', 'bit', 'fact', 'very', 'adult', 'themes', 'loneliness', 'loss', 'provided', 'film', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'trailers', 'feature', 'gave', 'absolutely', 'indication', 'film', 'featuring', 'balloons', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'heavy', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'mind', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Pixar', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'film', 'small', 'kids', 'may', 'need', 'answer', 'questions', 'afterwards', 'Asner', 'industry', 'legend', 'perfect', 'voice', 'Carl', 'one', 'voice', 'quite', 'Plummer', '.Large', 'birds', 'mean', 'dogs', 'figure', 'well.UP', 'very', 'enjoyabbe', 'trip', 'end', 'will', 'lift', 'spirits']",N/A

Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clich&eacute;d by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too.

When I first saw this in theaters, I was bewildered in a lot of ways. This was the first Pixar movie I'd seen in theaters in a looong time, it was also my first 3D viewing, and it also reminded me of why I haven't tried watching said movies in a while (&lt;-- noisy kids distracting me). But in buying the Blu-ray and having a chance to watch all the extras in the comfort of my own home, I dare say the movie left such a long-lasting, subconscious resonance, that I just about instantly remembered and picked up on so many of the wonderful themes addressed in the film's spectacular screenplay: age, dreams, preoccupation with life, feeling a sense of fulfillment, loneliness and separation, the hardships of death and the eventual resolve of letting the past go, companionship, and last but not least, the spirit of adventure(!). The movie itself succeeds on many levels, and a lot of that has to do with fine, fine voice acting from Ed Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and the various sound effects cues of Kevin via Tom Myers, the sound designer. The script thoroughly and deservedly reflects that innocence I mentioned and evokes something of an almost goofy, yet chummy quality throughout the film. Right from the get go of Muntz's opening film reel to the very end when Carl awards Russell the Ellie Badge are we captivated in such amorous ambiance. Literally, the movie is a wondrous adventure within itself. Up is a masterpiece. But in saying what I've already said, it's really just a matter of seeing and believing it for yourself. Certainly, everybody's interpretation or opinion on the film will vary, but here's hoping this writer's take will help some of you to see the great qualities that make this film so very, very enjoyable. Up is definitely one for the ages.Video - 5.0Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in glorious 1080p using AVC and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, it shouldn't be any surprise that Pixar-to-BD equals a perfect score. They're world-renowned for their art and animation as it is, so a direct digital transfer should be a no-brainer. The plethora of color schemes is fantastic. Vibrancy amongst the different locales, isolated locations, and various environments/characters are perfect. Edges are as straight and smooth as a computer can make them. Contrast and black levels have zero discrepancy, and there's not a single sign of aliasing, saturation, banding, EE, DNR, artifacts, noise, or bad editing. The transfer is flawless and worthy of CG demonstration to your guests.Audio - 5.0As with most Pixar/Disney movies, a lot of the sound relies on dialogue and music, with environmental and incidental sound effects on the side. With that said, Up's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track is as crisp and clean as the video. Dialogue is crystal clear with directionality and effortless noise distribution across the front stage. Separation between voices and the uplifting score by Michael Giacchino is also spot on. Surrounds are subtle at first until Carl actually gets his house up and flying into the air. The creaking of the house and inflation of the balloons are great and all, but I'd say the funner parts are during their trip into the storm and dog fight sequence towards the end. LFEs are especially prominent when that thunderstorm starts thundering. It's so scary and ominous, yet so cool and sexy for audiophiles. This is yet another outstanding audio effort from Pixar Studios to demo your systems with.Extras - 4.0Yes, as spectacular as the movie and A/V specs are, the Extras, while cool in their all-HD-ness, only get a 4 from me. The Cine-Explore takes commentary beyond commentary with it's innovative P-i-P approach using storyboards, CG composites, etc. to give audiences a more in-depth look at the film's construction. It's really cool, and I really appreciate Pete Docter and Bob Peterson's insight. I also really enjoy the Pixar shorts and idea of an interactive game. But only 48 minutes of production documentaries? I expected a little more than that. What about interviews with Asner and Nagai or Tim Myers and the rest of the sound crew? The documentaries, while extremely intriguing and informational, feel a bit too short, in my opinion, and very truncated in terms of the scope they could've achieved. Ah, well. Kudos to the production and art staff for their efforts anyway.Overall - 5.0Movie, Video, and Audio are on a level of excellence I think we've all come to expect from Pixar and Disney/Buena Vista these days. While the Extras leave just tad more to be desired, I can't see any reason in the Milky Way why I wouldn't recommend this intriguing work of art known as Up. It's a heartwarming, uplifting, and fun-for-the-whole-audience-adventure movie that will have you crying, laughing, and cheering all sorts of things.",5,Up (Blu-ray),1277164800,"06 22,

1209833,A96JD9312DHWC,B001KVZ6FW,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[0, 0]","Up was the story of two kids that happened to fall in love with one another, and their love contniued through childhood and into adulthood and beyond. During those years was a lot of happiness and a single want for both of the people involved: they wanted to go on a trip and follow their childhood idol to a waterfall that was placed in a really remote locale. The only problem with this plan was that life kept getting in the way and, ultimately, an old man's love fell ill and vanished from his life. This left him with nothing save memories and a house that the two had built, and even that was being threatened by building springing up all around their home. Then something happened to make the house a monolith that was to be torn down so, in his desperation, the old man turned to the one thing he knew. Balloons. Rigging the house with them, he took the home and saw it go airborne, finally allowing him and his memories the chance that they always wanted. The only problem with that was the stowaway that the old man wasn't expecting and the things he found when he got closer to his dream.Up was not what I expected was was good nonetheless. It was sad, however, and the beginning of the movie touched me and made me wish that the old man would have gotten to do the things he wanted to do when he had his love by his side. you could tell he wanted that as well, and that the house wa smore than a house to him - it was a reflection of the life he had spent with the only person that understood him. As his balloon quest took him on his way, he was forced to choose between this and something he knew was right - and that said a lot on the way things normally play out. On one hand there is the ""right"" thing to do. On the other is the ""things one wants to do.""I liked the tale because it took all sorts of things and showed them for what they were. Talking dogs, a person who was not what he was supposed to be, the love of a mother for its children, the hopes of a son as he wants nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale. I also liked the fact that the ending was one I did not expect, just as the movie was one I was not expecting. That made me happy and, truthfully, the whole saga touched me and made me feel good about this pick-up.I'm not sure if I would call this a kid's tale, and I say that because of the way it began. It was sad - depressingly so - and I didn't think all of that was what all parents want for their kids. It does have a lot of morality issues it places in front of its viewers, however, and those were interesting to see as they played out before this audience of one. Personally, i liked the story quite a bit and would say that i would be worth watching for children and parents alike. I'm not accustomed to saying that these day, either, but I thought this happened to be true here and recommend this for consumption on all age ranges - provided that parents agree with what is shown in the beginning.",5,"Flight, dreams, and the unexpected",1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,3014,"['Up', 'was', 'story', 'two', 'kids', 'happened', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'love', 'contniued', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'years', 'was', 'lot', 'happiness', 'single', 'want', 'people', 'involved', 'wanted', 'go', 'trip', 'follow', 'childhood', 'idol', 'waterfall', 'was', 'placed', 'really', 'remote', 'locale', 'only', 'problem', 'plan', 'was', 'life', 'kept', 'getting', 'way', 'ultimately', 'old', 'man', 'love', 'fell', 'ill', 'vanished', 'life', 'left', 'nothing', 'save', 'memories', 'house', 'two', 'had', 'built', 'even', 'was', 'being', 'threatened', 'building', 'springing', 'up', 'home', 'Then', 'something', 'happened', 'make', 'house', 'monolith', 'was', 'be', 'torn', 'down', 'so', 'desperation', 'old', 'man', 'turned', 'one', 'thing', 'knew', 'Balloons', 'Rigging', 'house', 'took', 'home', 'saw', 'go', 'airborne', 'finally', 'allowing', 'memories', 'chance', 'always', 'wanted', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'stowaway', 'old', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'things', 'found', 'when', 'got', 'closer', 'dream.Up', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'was', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'sad', 'however', 'beginning', 'movie', 'touched', 'made', 'wish', 'old', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'do', 'things', 'wanted', 'do', 'when', 'had', 'love', 'side', 'could', 'tell', 'wanted', 'as', 'well', 'house', 'smore', 'house', 'was', 'reflection', 'life', 'had', 'spent', 'only', 'person', 'understood', 'balloon', 'quest', 'took', 'way', 'was', 'forced', 'choose', 'something', 'knew', 'was', 'right', 'said', 'lot', 'way', 'things', 'normally', 'play', 'out', 'one', 'hand', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'one', 'do', 'liked', 'tale', 'took', 'sorts', 'things', 'showed', 'what', 'were', 'Talking', 'dogs', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'mother', 'children', 'hopes', 'son', 'nothing', 'more', 'recognition', 'Dad', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'more', 'such', 'well-crafted', 'tale', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'ending', 'was', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'just', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'made', 'happy', 'truthfully', 'whole', 'saga', 'touched', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'pick-up.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'call', 'kid', 'tale', 'say', 'way', 'began', 'was', 'sad', 'depressingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'what', 'parents', 'want', 'kids', 'have', 'lot', 'morality', 'issues', 'front', 'viewers', 'however', 'were', 'interesting', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'audience', 'one', 'Personally', 'i', 'liked', 'story', 'quite', 'bit', 'would', 'say', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'children', 'parents', 'alike', ""'m"", 'not', 'accustomed', 'saying', 'day', 'either', 'thought', 'happened', 'be', 'true', 'here', 'recommend', 'consumption', 'age', 'provided', 'parents', 'agree', 'what', 'shown', 'beginning']",N/A

With each work they release, our expectations naturally get higher and higher. Perhaps this is why I was not impressed with Pixar's ""Up"" very much. The film flies, but doesn't soar.The best part of ""Up"" is its opening 10 minutes, where a young boy named Carl Fredricksen meets a tomboyish girl Ellie. They marry, and spend the life together (not without sad moments, however), both dreaming of someday travelling to Paradise Falls in South America. This excellent introductory section almost looks like a stand-alone short film with a very emotional conclusion.The rest of the film is about the 78-year-old Carl and his adventures, accompanied by a very talkative little boy named Russell. Carl sets out for South America in his house floating in the sky using thousands of balloons. Their journey is full of actions, jokes and lessens to be learned - you get chases, visual gags, and even ""dog fights"" (literally) - and they are always entertaining, if not as touching as the film's initial part.With superb visuals, ""Up"" remains entertaining throughout, but its story lacks something that draws the viewers into the fantasy world it depicts.

1209837,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001KVZ6FW,Turfseer,"[25, 82]","It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist--on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels.

By the time the opening sequence has concluded, we already have an appreciation for Carl and a longing to have known even more about his deceased wife, Ellie.Carl is old, but he's also determined.  Skyscrapers and strip malls surround the old house that he and Ellie so painstakingly restored and though the land developer has offered to pay Mr. Fredricksen handsomely for his home and property, he refuses to sell.  However, in the end, through a careless act on Carl's part and a huge wrangling of the judicial system by the developer, Carl is forced to sell his property and ordered to move.  But, good old Carl is stubborn and sets about turning his entire home into a giant airship through the use of thousands of helium-filled balloons.  When the men from the retirement home come to take him away, Carl leaves them behind as he flies up, up, and away.Carl thinks he's alone as he begins his journey to see Paradise Falls in South America, the dream destination he and Ellie always wanted to go.  However, there's a stowaway aboard on the front porch, a Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) that Carl thought he had gotten rid of by sending on a snipe hunt.  Carl reluctantly agrees to take Russell with him, but on the condition that Russell will go home once they reach Paradise Falls.  But the journey to paradise is filled with all kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.Unlike 2008's WALL-E, UP doesn't have an agenda.  Instead, it's a story about one man's redemption.  Carl is a good man who lived a good life, but the death of his beloved Ellie not only turned him crotchety, but caused him to lose his way.  It takes the unbridled honesty and passion of a child to get Carl back on track and face what he could become, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer).Of course, if that's not enough for you, UP also features all kinds of comedy for all ages.  Kids will love Dug and the rest of the talking dogs.  Adults will appreciate the zingy one-liners Carl delivers.  There are also all kinds of allusions throughout the movie (e.g. the dogs in the airplanes repeat lines taken directly from STAR WARS).UP has great characters, moving story, and witty dialog.  Simply stated, it's the best movie of 2009.The regular DVD includes the shorts ""Partly Cloudy"" and ""Dug's Special Mission"". ""Partly Cloudy"" features a stork sent to deliver dangerous baby critters.  The stork longs to have a regular delivery like the other storks, but in the end realizes just how important his job is.  As a side note, in watching UP you can catch a glimpse of a few of the clouds from ""Partly Cloudy"".  ""Dug's Special Mission"" illustrates what happens to Dug immediately preceding his discovering of Carl and Russell in the Jungle.",5,Best Movie of 2009,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,3526,"['best', 'picture', '2009', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'giant', 'blue', 'aliens', 'plot', 'stolen', 'DANCES', 'WITH', 'WOLVES', 'was', 'best', 'picture', '2009', 'low-budget', 'film', 'military', 'bomb', 'squad', 'Iraq', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'However', 'can', 'compare', 'elegance', 'beauty', 'simplicity', 'UP.Though', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'UP', 'story', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'touchingly', 'story', 'Carl', 'life', 'grew', 'up', 'wanting', 'experience', 'adventure', 'married', 'girl', 'dreams', 'together', 'lived', 'very', 'happy-though', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet-life', 'time', 'opening', 'sequence', 'concluded', 'already', 'have', 'appreciation', 'Carl', 'longing', 'have', 'known', 'even', 'more', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Ellie.Carl', 'old', 'also', 'determined', 'Skyscrapers', 'strip', 'malls', 'surround', 'old', 'house', 'Ellie', 'so', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'land', 'developer', 'offered', 'pay', 'Mr.', 'Fredricksen', 'handsomely', 'home', 'property', 'sell', 'However', 'end', 'careless', 'act', 'Carl', 'part', 'huge', 'wrangling', 'judicial', 'system', 'developer', 'Carl', 'forced', 'sell', 'property', 'ordered', 'move', 'good', 'old', 'Carl', 'stubborn', 'sets', 'turning', 'entire', 'home', 'giant', 'airship', 'use', 'thousands', 'helium-filled', 'balloons', 'When', 'men', 'retirement', 'home', 'come', 'take', 'away', 'Carl', 'up', 'up', 'away.Carl', 'alone', 'journey', 'see', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'South', 'America', 'dream', 'destination', 'Ellie', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'However', 'stowaway', 'aboard', 'front', 'porch', 'Wilderness', 'Scout', 'named', 'Russell', 'Jordan', 'Nagai', 'Carl', 'thought', 'had', 'gotten', 'rid', 'sending', 'snipe', 'hunt', 'Carl', 'reluctantly', 'take', 'Russell', 'condition', 'Russell', 'will', 'go', 'home', 'once', 'reach', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'journey', 'paradise', 'filled', 'kinds', 'strange', 'even', 'dangerous', 'adventures', 'terrifying', 'heights', 'thick', 'vegetation', 'talking', 'dogs', 'rare', 'endangered', 'birds', 'ancient', 'explorer', 'bent', 'capturing', 'prey', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.Unlike', '2008', 'WALL-E', 'UP', ""n't"", 'have', 'agenda', 'Instead', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'redemption', 'Carl', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'good', 'life', 'death', 'beloved', 'Ellie', 'not', 'only', 'turned', 'crotchety', 'caused', 'lose', 'way', 'unbridled', 'honesty', 'passion', 'child', 'get', 'Carl', 'back', 'track', 'face', 'what', 'could', 'become', 'Charles', 'Muntz', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', '.Of', 'course', 'not', 'enough', 'UP', 'also', 'kinds', 'comedy', 'ages', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'Dug', 'rest', 'talking', 'dogs', 'Adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'zingy', 'one-liners', 'Carl', 'delivers', 'are', 'also', 'kinds', 'allusions', 'movie', 'e.g', 'dogs', 'airplanes', 'repeat', 'lines', 'taken', 'directly', 'STAR', 'WARS', '.UP', 'great', 'characters', 'moving', 'story', 'witty', 'dialog', 'Simply', 'stated', 'best', 'movie', '2009.The', 'regular', 'DVD', 'shorts', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'Dug', 'Special', 'Mission', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'stork', 'sent', 'deliver', 'dangerous', 'baby', 'critters', 'stork', 'longs', 'have', 'regular', 'delivery', 'other', 'storks', 'end', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'job', 'side', 'note', 'watching', 'UP', 'can', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'few', 'clouds', 'Partly', 'Cloudy', 'Dug', 'Special', 'Mission', 'what', 'Dug', 'immediately', 'preceding', 'discovering', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'Jungle']",N/A

1209840,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B001KVZ6FW,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[1, 1]","I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could. I do feel that if someone tied that many balloons to a house it could fly. So find a way to see this film it will truly lift your spirits and melt your heart. Oh, if you start yelling `Squirrel' at the top of your lungs no one will think you're out of your mind.",5,An animated film as real as it can get.,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,2255,"['have', 'never', 'reviewed', 'Pixar', 'film', 'Amazon', 'just', 'yet', '10th', 'feature', 'had', 'be', 'Pixar', 'Toy', 'Story', 'spit', 'out', 'one', 'hit', 'bringing', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'legendary', 'Disney', 'Characters', 'single', 'one', 'been', 'incredible', 'just', 'out', 'Pixar', 'predecessors.This', 'second', 'film', 'Pixar', 'be', 'given', 'PG', 'rating', 'Incredibles', 'Incredibles', 'was', 'more', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'superhero', 'action', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Up', 'are', 'very', 'adult', 'oriented', 'are', 'extremely', 'real', 'elements', 'lead', 'main', 'characters', 'adventure', 'previous', 'one', 'had', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'beautiful', 'sequence', 'dialogue', 'score', 'show', 'husband', 'wife', 'sharing', 'happy', 'times', 'devastating', 'ones', 'one', 'being', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'Even', 'words', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'full', 'emotion', 'just', 'something', 'young', 'audience', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'scene', 'where', 'Carl', 'construction', 'worker', 'also', 'moment', 'very', 'hard', 'explain', 'very', 'young', 'person', 'story', 'changes', 'gears', 'rip', 'roaring', 'hysterical', 'adventure', 'cast', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'especially', 'bringing', 'two', 'legends', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'Christopher', 'Plumber', 'Everyone', 'will', 'love', 'Russell', 'eager', 'young', 'explorer', 'who', 'adventure', 'also', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'again', 'real', 'live', 'issues', 'such', 'parent', 'separation', 'course', 'pure', 'Disney', 'magic', 'film', 'especially', 'animals', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'dogs', 'uses', 'technology', 'make', 'speak', 'instead', 'traditional', 'imaginative', 'talking', 'animal', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'making', 'actually', 'believable', 'someone', 'can', 'create', 'device', 'make', 'animal', 'speak', 'still', 'keep', 'own', 'natural', 'characteristics.Up', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Pixar', 'film', 'date', 'love', 'one', 'just', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'as', 'real', 'could', 'do', 'feel', 'someone', 'tied', 'many', 'balloons', 'house', 'could', 'fly', 'So', 'find', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'truly', 'lift', 'spirits', 'melt', 'heart', 'Oh', 'start', 'yelling', 'Squirrel', 'top', 'lungs', 'one', 'will', 'think', ""'re"", 'mind']",N/A

1209842,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B001KVZ6FW,V. Berk,"[2, 3]","Up is a great film and defiantly ranks as one of Pixar's best- as well as one of the best animated films of the last ten years.  The only films that can compare are Pixar's Wall-E and The Incredibles.  The film is just a pure delight and one of the most mature films to come from the company that is without a doubt the most consistently entertaining studio in all of Hollywood.  It was easily the most mature, well thought out film I viewed during the 2009 Summer Movie Season, and I'm sure it will be considered one of the best films of the year.Story:  The story is one that has the light-hearted fantasy feel of a children's movie, while at the same time retaining the dark elements of an adult tale of obsession and greed.  Its plot is a very complex analysis about the passion of love, loss, and obsession and I was fascinated every-single second.  But, I should warn parents, behind the cute old man and the flying house this is ranks up with The Incredibles as one of the darkest films to receive the PG rating within the states.The story is about an old man who, after the death of his wife, lives a lonely, uneventful wife.  After assaulting a construction worker he is deemed a threat to the community and is told that he shall be removed from his home and forced into a retirement community.  With little choice he chooses to fulfill the dream that him and his spouse shared of placing their home near Paradise Falls in South America.Using thousands of helium filled balloons he begins this expedition, but along the way he is joined by many unexpected companions, ranging from a determined scout, a talking dog, and a large exotic bird.  In the end he is forced to decide what matters most in life.The film is modeled after the serials of the 1930s-1950s and carries along that fun, adventurous spirit throughout.Animation:  It's Pixar, what do you expect?  As usual it is top of the line and obviously had long hours of emotional effort put into it.  The animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.Voices:  Voice-acting is also top of the line.  Every voice actor is clearly treating the role seriously and having a fun time doing it.I highly recommend Up to children and adults- heck, I would recommend the movie to an adult, regardless of whether or not they had children.  It's just that good of a movie that it transcends age groups to be the most widely appealing film of the summer.Up emotionally compelling and full of fun with endless imagination.

Young Carl Fredricksen and friend Ellie have a shared passion: adventure. Specifically, they both idolize adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who travels the world in his gigantic airship, the Spirit of Adventure. But when Muntz can't prove that a unique skeleton he brought back from South America's Paradise Falls isn't a fake, he is publicly disgraced. Vowing to go back and find the proof to clear his name, he boards his airship in anger and disappears into the clouds.Meanwhile, Ellie tells Carl that she wants a house on top of Paradise Falls, and Carl innocently crosses his heart in promise to give it to her. When they grow up, Carl and Ellie marry, and, as in It's A Wonderful Life, they move into the rickety old house they once played in. They fix it up and live there for many happy years until Ellie passes away. Carl ends up as a crotchety old widower with an enormous building project going up all around him - and they want him out. So, remembering his promise to Ellie, and to escape his gloomy fate, he ties a zillion helium balloons to his house and takes off for South America and Paradise Falls.This is an adventure par excellence, very European in feel, with the charm of Ratatouille. But it is an odd assortment of characters. Besides Carl, who looks very much like Spencer Tracy and is played by Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), there's a stowaway: boy Wilderness Explorer, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's working on his Helping Old People merit badge; a canine named Dug (Bob Peterson) that they meet in South America, and who has an electronic collar that allows him to talk; and Kevin... There are a pack of dogs, all with talking collars, but three main ones besides Dug: Alpha (again, Bob Peterson), Beta (Delroy Lindo) and Gamma (Jerome Ranft). Alpha has trouble with his collar, so that it produces a very high-pitched voice, which for an alpha dog is very embarrassing.Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., story for WALL-E et al) and Bob Peterson (screenplay for Finding Nemo, story artist for Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life) co-directed this tale from a script by Peterson. It's a very sweet and funny story, full of poignant reminders that, while we need to seek adventures in life, the most important adventures are the ones we go on in our daily lives: such as marriage and parenting. The importance of fatherhood resonates in the relationship between Carl and Russell. Then there's Kevin...I think the biggest laugh comes when Russell's face is slammed against the window of Muntz's airship, and then is dragged across it making a streaking sound, while Muntz's eyes follow it inside. Of course, Russell is funny in general, being so naive. Then there are the dogs, who refer to Russell as ""the small mailman"" because of his Explorer uniform. Just about every dogism is used, from their love of balls and hatred of squirrels, to the dreaded ""cone of shame."" Dug is especially enjoyable because he is the quintessential dog every kid loves.Visually, the film is stylized in a very lovable way, similar to a children's book. My favorite part are the balloons - they're terrific. This type of imagination and adventure builds strong values in kids. Contrast it with the previews that precede the movie of Disney fare that do little more than teach kids to live in out-of-touch dream worlds. It's hard to understand how Pixar and Disney joined forces. Disney doesn't seem to have a clue, and Pixar has every clue. I thank God for Pixar. They are just about the only bastion of good-quality, family-oriented movie-making left. Walen Media, who is so into books,  should borrow a page from Pixar's.

Just when you think it will be impossible for Pixar to top themselves, they amaze you by surpassing their already lofty standards.  I thought the only slight stumble from Pixar was ""Ratatouille"", but then they release ""Wall*E"" and ""Up"".  ""Up"" may be the best animated film I've ever seen and is about as perfect an animated film as can be made.  Every aspect of ""Up"" is first-rate -- a wonderful story, incredible animation, great casting (yes, voice casting is critical and Ed Asner is wonderful) and a movie that delivers across a range of emotions that connect with adults and children.  I won't bother recapping the plot, plenty other have done that.We have 3 children (5,7 & 10) and they all are equally mesmerized and entertained by this movie.  We all loved the movie when we saw it in the theaters and the Blu-ray version of ""Up"" does complete justice to the picture.  Watching this movie on a 52"" HDTV at home, while not up to theater standards, certainly is about as close to being in the theater as you can get.Storytelling is an art form and we often take for granted how hard it is to create truly wonderful stories.  The folks at Pixar have spoiled us by making it appear too easy, constantly churning out movies that will be classics for generations, just like the old Disney animated movies.  If you have not seen ""Up"", do yourself a favor and buy a blu-ray player, or if you have one, then buy the blu-ray version of ""Up"" and treat yourself to a wonderful, hynotic and mesmerizing bit of storytelling.

1209856,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B001KVZ6FW,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[11, 33]","I'll get the good stuff out of the way first.Last year I lost someone who meant the world to me. The first 20 minutes of ""Up"" so perfectly captured the joy of love and the despair at its loss, that I cried almost continually.As for the rest of the film... eh.Pixar is perennially complimented for its focus on story, story, story -- in particular, character-driven stories. Up to the point where Carl ""takes off"", ""Up"" is a character-driven story.Unfortunately, once Carl lands in Paradise Falls (courtesy of a Wilderness Scout GPS system) he now is obliged to have the adventure he's been waiting 50 years for. What will it be? I know! His childhood hero, Charles Muntz, is still alive, still trying to catch a phororhacos to prove the bird actually exists. And guess what? Muntz (voiced by a wasted Christopher Plummer) is actually a villain, murderous in his attempts to keep anyone from ""stealing"" his discovery.The last third of the film is violent in a way that's downright mean-spirited for a PG ""family"" film. Muntz leaves Russell tied to a chair where he can fall out of the dirigible, and comes after Carl with a sword. And though he's been in the jungle for half a century, Muntz somehow has access to microcircuitry that make it possible for his dogs to talk. (Even Bob Pease isn't that clever.) And, of course, Muntz isn't reformed, but falls to his death.Can you say obvious? Can you preposterous? Can you say stupid?This isn't character-based storytelling, it's plot-based melodrama. What happens to Carl occurs because it ""has"" to in order for him (and Russell) to strut his (their) stuff.This isn't good storytelling. It stinks, in fact. Bad Pixar. Bad Pixar. Not even all the very funny stuff you expect from a Pixar film, which is present in abundance, can save ""Up"" from being shallow and dismally predictable.Unlike most Pixar films, it's unlikely I'll want to see this one even a second time.A Note on 3DI saw 3D movies when I was a kid, but don't remember the details. (Yes, they used gray Polaroid filters, not red and green, despite what all the ""experts"" tell you.) Pixar's use of 3D is superb. It never draws attention to itself, except when it's visually pertinent. And every object has depth and roundness -- this isn't the ViewMaster sort of image, with multiple planes of flat objects.As for the RealD system, there is nothing _fundamentally_ new about it. The digital projector eliminates registration and timing problems, and the use of circular polarization means you don't have to hold your head perfectly level. But it works the same as the first polarized 3D movies did at the GM exhibit at the 1938 World's Fair. (I have a bunch of the viewers.)However... One reviewer commented at the loss of ""vividness"" when you put the glasses on, ascribing it to the unavoidable loss of light in the viewing filters. To my surprise, this reviewer was correct. The colors are not only somewhat desaturated, but look ""odd"" in a way I can't quite explain. This is not simply a drop in light level; something else is going on, but I don't know what it is.THOUGHTS ON THE BLU-RAY (AND FURTHER THOUGHTS ON THE FILM)Because I could get the BD set for $15.50 (including tax and shipping), I was a hypocrite and bought it. The image quality (on a 60"" Kuro) is far superior to what I saw in the theater. (This was likely the fault of that particular theater's presentation, as the 3D editions of ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" at another theater were much better.) The BD also makes you aware of the subtle naturalness of the animation.A second viewing only confirmed what an utter botch this film is. If you replace the talking dogs with regular dogs, you have a serious adult film lightened only (a bit) by the presence of an irritating child. It's obvious that the talking dogs are there for humor (and there's no denying they /are/ funny -- when they're not threatening to rip out a character's throat), and to appeal to the kids. (The dogs are the focus of the TV spots.) Without them, there's little in this film to appeal to children.In one of the supplements, Pete Docter explains the difficulties in figuring out how to kill off Muntz. Muntz is supposed to be Carl's psychological ""Doppelganger"", the person Carl was in the process of becoming, so it's necessary to get rid of him so that Carl can progress. This thought had never crossed my mind (I don't remember any review, anywhere, that raised it), and the story does essentially nothing to develop it. Indeed, the ""reveal"" that Muntz is a psychopathic murderer comes much too soon, cancelling any opportunity for interaction between him and Carl that would have clarified their implied relationship.Of course, once you get rid of the talking dogs, you're left with a fairly conventional drama of the sort we've seen too many times before -- a grumpy old person who's just lost their spouse is restored to happiness by a child who brings light and happiness into their wretched life.When Walt Disney was making ""Snow White"", he said he never wanted to do anything ""ugly"". ""Up"" has a number of truly ugly moments that are out of place in a movie intended for all ages. Yes, life /can/ be ugly, and there is no reason why children shouldn't be exposed to it. (When Disney's daughter complained about the death of Bambi's mother, his resonse was that that was the way life was.) But you don't do it in a film that's an unpalatable mish-mosh of broad humor and crude terror -- including, but not limited to, a child being tied to a chair and left where he will fall to his death.It's interesting how this particular sequence seems to invert a similar sequence in ""Snow White"". Remember where she's hanging from a vine and about to drop who-knows-how-far to her possible death? The animators argued over ""whether the fall would kill her"" -- then realized they were talking about an animated character, albeit one who seemed very real to them (which, of course, is very much the point of the film). In ""Up!"", it doesn't matter that Russell is put in a situation where he's likely to be killed, /because/ he's an animated figure and /can't/ die.",3,A downer.

If you are reading this with a different version, be aware that Amazon does this from time to time and reviewers have no control over it.""Up"" is an enjoyable film that proves once again that Disney/Pixar can take an oddball story and make it entertaining, heartwarming, and endearing all at once.  The events are a childlike fantasy, with only a few dark edges around them.  The action, while fast-paced, is never too scary for little ones, and the laughs are many.  There is some intensity to ""Up"", with death bracketing the beginning and end of the film, but the tale told in between makes this easier to take.  Each of the characters has some depth to them, and we learn enough about them in the story to truly care and be drawn in.The Four-Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo + BD-Live version of ""Up"" is crammed from end to end with just about anything you could imagine wanting from the home video experience.  In this decently-priced collection we have a Blu-Ray disc of the movie, complete with optional online-accessible content; a DVD edition of the film, the ""Extras"" disc with ""making of"", ""bonus materials"", short films and more, all of it representing an amazing Disney/Pixar production.  I was pretty impressed with all the featurettes that explained where most of the story's ideas came from and how they were researched.  The Blu-Ray is bright, colorful, and detailed, with textures being probably the most noticeable effect.  The DVD scales quite nicely, still managing to render well on a player with upscaling.  Extra features include stuff for the grown-ups, such as an explanation of why the story ended the way it did and some alternate ideas that the writers explored.  Last, the BD-Live content changes periodically, and can be accessed through a computer or through a Blu-Ray player that is Internet-enabled (such as the Playstation 3 I used to watch this collection).If you missed ""Up"" in the theaters, you'll find this to be just as charming and fun as Disney/Pixar's previous offerings.  If you saw it in theaters and want to own ""Up"" at home, I have to say that this Blu-Ray looks just as good to me as it did in the theater, with the added bonus of a DVD (for compatibility) and extra goodies to enhance enjoyment of the film across the board.",5,Everything and More,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2341,"['NOTE', 'review', 'was', 'posted', '4-disc', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'version', 'Up', 'are', 'reading', 'different', 'version', 'be', 'aware', 'Amazon', 'time', 'time', 'reviewers', 'have', 'control', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Disney/Pixar', 'can', 'take', 'oddball', 'story', 'make', 'entertaining', 'heartwarming', 'endearing', 'once', 'events', 'are', 'childlike', 'fantasy', 'only', 'few', 'dark', 'edges', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'never', 'too', 'scary', 'little', 'ones', 'laughs', 'are', 'many', 'intensity', 'Up', 'death', 'bracketing', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'tale', 'told', 'easier', 'take', 'characters', 'depth', 'learn', 'enough', 'story', 'truly', 'care', 'be', 'drawn', 'in.The', 'Four-Disc', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'Combo', '+', 'BD-Live', 'version', 'Up', 'crammed', 'end', 'end', 'just', 'anything', 'could', 'imagine', 'wanting', 'home', 'video', 'experience', 'decently-priced', 'collection', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'movie', 'complete', 'optional', 'online-accessible', 'content', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film', 'Extras', 'disc', 'making', 'bonus', 'materials', 'short', 'films', 'more', 'representing', 'amazing', 'Disney/Pixar', 'production', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'featurettes', 'explained', 'where', 'most', 'story', 'ideas', 'came', 'how', 'were', 'researched', 'Blu-Ray', 'bright', 'colorful', 'detailed', 'textures', 'being', 'probably', 'most', 'noticeable', 'effect', 'DVD', 'quite', 'nicely', 'still', 'managing', 'render', 'well', 'player', 'upscaling', 'Extra', 'features', 'include', 'stuff', 'grown-ups', 'such', 'explanation', 'why', 'story', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'alternate', 'ideas', 'writers', 'explored', 'Last', 'BD-Live', 'content', 'changes', 'periodically', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'computer', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'Internet-enabled', 'such', 'Playstation', '3', 'used', 'watch', 'collection', '.If', 'missed', 'Up', 'theaters', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'just', 'charming', 'fun', 'Disney/Pixar', 'previous', 'offerings', 'saw', 'theaters', 'want', 'own', 'Up', 'home', 'have', 'say', 'Blu-Ray', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'theater', 'added', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'compatibility', 'extra', 'goodies', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'board']",N/A
1209859,AUTBHG6070SL4,B001KVZ6FW,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[4, 4]","Pixar keeps raising the bar - and this time it's Up. This joyous fantasy creates a very odd couple indeed. An iconic grumpy old man and a congenitally cheerful and sincere little boy launch onto an adventure blended from equal parts past (the old guy's) and future (the kid's). There's bit of an eco-fable in there, with the big bad urban developers and the rapacious hunter, but that never becomes annoying. Instead, Up keeps delivering wild sight gags layered on appealing interactions between the characters. Speaking of characters (and speaking of them speaking), Dug the dog is way up on my list of favorites. If you never learned to love dog-drool as a child, he might not hit a heart-string - but that's your problem, not mine.I'm sure others will tell you about the rest of the movie, but two parts really stood out for me: the first five minutes, and the ten minutes (or so) before that. Those first few minutes of the movie create a charming back-story with more plot and heart than a lot of movies manage in an hour or two. They define The Quest that the rest of the movie pursues, so effectively that you'll never question any silliness in pursuing it. But, before the first minutes of this movie, Pixar presents one of their signature short features. This time - well, it would take longer to tell than to watch. It's about the stork who delivers the babies. It carries an affectionate reminder that some are harder to love than others, but that just makes the job that much more important.-- wiredweird(PS: Note how much more limber and energetic the old guy gets as he spends more time with that earnest little boy - that part of the movie is absolute non-fiction.

1209866,AP3B615GM191G,B001KVZ6FW,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","A few years ago, I watched the film ""Gran Torino"" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life.  However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether.  Thankfully, Pixar's ""Up"" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction (""progress"") on all sides of him.  Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized.  However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time.  As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers.  There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog ""Dug""...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers.  An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell.  With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now.  The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.Thus, I consider ""Up"" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.",5,"""Gran Torino"" For The Family Set",1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,2330,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'film', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'take', 'themes', 'such', 'aging', 'friendship', 'coming', 'terms', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'However', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'harsh', 'language', 'non-political', 'correctness', 'would', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'past', 'hang-ups', 'kids', 'are', 'ruled', 'out', 'altogether', 'Thankfully', 'Pixar', 'Up', 'explores', 'same', 'themes', 'much', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'fashion.Basically', 'story', 'centers', 'Carl', 'Fredricksen', 'senior', 'citizen', 'widower', 'who', 'being', 'cajoled', 'old', 'relic', 'house', 'construction', 'progress', 'sides', 'Instead', 'going', 'out', 'smoothly', 'though', 'Carl', 'being', 'retired', 'balloon', 'salesman', 'fly', 'home', 'gaggle', 'helium', 'balloons', 'Paradise', 'Falls', 'mystical', 'place', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Ellie', 'always', 'dreamed', 'never', 'quite', 'realized', 'However', 'one', 'hitch', 'plan', 'being', 'completely', 'helpless', 'boy', 'scout', 'Russell', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'wrong', 'porch', 'wrong', 'time', 'make', 'way', 'falls', 'Carl', 'Russell', 'encounter', 'slew', 'new', 'characters', 'challenges', 'making', 'truly', 'adventure', 'sense', 'word.The', 'first', 'level', 'film', 'really', 'kiddies', 'intended', 'viewers', 'are', 'enough', 'sight', 'gags', 'involving', 'rotund', 'Russell', 'crotchety', 'Carl', 'crazy', 'characters', 'talking', 'dog', 'Dug', 'squirrel', 'keep', 'interest', 'whole', 'runtime.However', 'much', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'will', 'truly', 'move', 'even', 'most', 'adult', 'viewers', 'amazing', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'film', 'marriage', 'ups', 'downs', 'Carl', 'Ellie', 'really', 'up', 'Carl', 'character', 'development', 'forced', 'venture', 'out', 'world', 'again', 'bond', 'young', 'Russell', 'passing', 'moment', 'new', 'adventure', 'viewers', 'get', 'feeling', 'Carl', 'taking', 'small', 'step', 'closer', 'making', 'clean', 'break', 'past', 'living', 'here', 'now', 'scene', 'where', 'finally', 'fact', 'enough', 'make', 'eyes', 'begin', 'water.Thus', 'consider', 'Up', 'be', 'pinnacle', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'animated', 'films', 'ability', 'make', 'laugh', 'tantalizing', 'senses', 'really', 'draw', 'characters', 'successes/struggles']",N/A
