I don't know exactly why, they just do. I think because it gives far mor insight as to what's happening.These three women living on the outskirts of a dying town smacked of ""The last picture show"". Life has dealt each a pretty hard hand and it's hard to tell if Mom Nora, older sister Trudi, or young Shady Lynne has it the worst. Nora's found love where she could and it's burnt her every time and that's been passed right on down to her two daughters.They've no faith that it will ever change, yet they continue to try to find love anyway.

Having been in  this little place with not a lot to see or do, I could totally relate to  the frustrations of the characters to be living there.

GAS FOOD LODGING is nothing less but A BEAUTIFUL TALE about coming of age, love, and caring despite all the little sticks in the wheels that might occur along the way.A mother (Brooke Adams) tries to raise her 2 daughters alone in a deserted new Mexico town. The oldest one Trudi (Ion Skye)is a daydreamer, promiscuous young woman but when she happens to meet a young boy that will in return treat her as badly as she used to treat other guys, she's left with nothing but her mother (Not so much a role model). And her younger sister Shade (Fairuza Balk)who fantaisizes about love, and about finding a man for her mom while watching Mexican love stories in a deserted theater near her home. But Shade will too learn that love might hit you at the very moment, you thought you were full of it and it might not always be the first boy that a lady come across that will make them feel that way.Later, Trudi meets a man and falls in love. She eventually falls pregnant but the man in question disappeared soon after that. And the two girls father (A STILL REALLY AMAZING JAMES BROLIN) reappears out of nowhere, offering Shade a ride home after she fled from a strange night out.Directed by ALLISON LANDERS and landing FAIRUZA BALK the award for independant's best lead actress on its year of release, GAS FOOD LODGING has a whole lot to be acclaimed for. So my deepest congratulations to the whole talented team of workers on this one. This is a nice, touching little tale about coming of age in a small town in which everyone would feel the need to escape to find some freedom and fresh air. A little piece of art about caring for one an other.

328169,A163N66ALZDACR,6302690420,LBloom,"[0, 1]","This movie reminded me of those drive-in classics I used to see just when I was old enough to drive and hear curse words in a movie. The story here is about a woman and her two teenage daughters living in trailer along the freeway, henceforth the title. They argue and fight a lot and say f... a lot but always seem to end up sort of stuck with each other. I agree with most of the other reviews here...you can almost feel the dirt road under the wheels of you tires or the screen door slamming and people yelling and cursing each other.The younger characters herein sound like they're at about the same age except I was that age about 15 years before this was made. The idea of being stuck in a small town, bored to death and convinced that no matter what you'll still be there tomorrow.Pretty raw dialogue in lots of places. No cinderella, fairy tales or teen comedies here either. I want to warn those who look for any of those that it ain't here.The movie takes place in Mew Mexico and has some racial overtones to it as well. The reason that I've mentioned that is that I felt like I'd seen something similar to it with but set in another state and also in case my title might mislead someone into thinking that this is some redneck movie about growing up in the south but it ain't that either. This is also not really a chick movie in the sense that I've always understoood the term.The characters both males and females are pretty raw and uncultured and unrefined and again seems to avoid the ususal movie cliches that I think I've covered in full above. No teen comedy, redneck comedy, soap opera, or love story here.I could actually live without hearing an actual argument over who took the last tampon. That seems to be what everybody herein does real well is to argue about mom working at the diner to the neighbor installing his satellite dish to the idiot at the movies who can't focus the projector or the guy that's heard bout the girl who likes to swallow. (It isn't porn either) Argue and fight and then life goes on. No one ever seems to apologize to each other but no one seems to care.If you grew up under these circumstances you may not be shocked at the language but I felt that for some who were expecting something lighter to be forewarned. Most of us from small towns pretended to be shocked in front of our parents but in reality we hear thesame language everyday.Fairuza Balk's narration makes it somewhat more interesting as she seems to be trying to find a new husband for her mother whose first one vanished or something and she's dated a bunch of losers so her daughter figures that finding mom a new husband will free them all of their restrictions.I passed through New Mexico once in lifetime and as well as I remember it looked a lot ilke this movie. I give credit for avoiding all the usual movie cliches that I could think of anyway. This is slow moving, dirt roads, pick up trucks, trailer parks and truckstops. I like the realism of it and It seems to accurately capture the feeling of frustration of being trapped in a hick town in the middle of nowhere, the only way out if you're a woman is to get married and hope to escape. It's that this sort of doesn't always happen in reality either which is another point that this movie makes real well. Life is unfair.It's definitely not something I want to sit through everyday of the week. But once in a while, I could see myself watching this just for the hell of it.",5,Dirt Road Reality May Be Too Real For Some,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,3453,"['movie', 'reminded', 'drive-in', 'classics', 'used', 'see', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'drive', 'hear', 'curse', 'words', 'movie', 'story', 'here', 'woman', 'two', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'living', 'trailer', 'freeway', 'title', 'argue', 'fight', 'lot', 'say', 'f', 'lot', 'always', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'sort', 'stuck', 'other', 'agree', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'dirt', 'road', 'wheels', 'tires', 'screen', 'door', 'slamming', 'people', 'yelling', 'cursing', 'other.The', 'younger', 'characters', 'herein', 'sound', ""'re"", 'same', 'age', 'was', 'age', '15', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'idea', 'being', 'stuck', 'small', 'town', 'bored', 'death', 'convinced', 'matter', 'what', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'there', 'tomorrow.Pretty', 'raw', 'dialogue', 'lots', 'places', 'cinderella', 'fairy', 'tales', 'teen', 'comedies', 'here', 'either', 'want', 'warn', 'who', 'look', 'ai', ""n't"", 'here.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Mew', 'Mexico', 'racial', 'overtones', 'as', 'well', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'felt', ""'d"", 'seen', 'something', 'similar', 'set', 'state', 'also', 'case', 'title', 'might', 'mislead', 'someone', 'thinking', 'redneck', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'south', 'ai', ""n't"", 'also', 'not', 'really', 'chick', 'movie', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'always', 'understoood', 'term.The', 'characters', 'males', 'females', 'are', 'pretty', 'raw', 'uncultured', 'unrefined', 'again', 'avoid', 'ususal', 'movie', 'cliches', 'think', ""'ve"", 'covered', 'full', 'teen', 'comedy', 'redneck', 'comedy', 'soap', 'opera', 'love', 'story', 'here.I', 'could', 'actually', 'live', 'hearing', 'actual', 'argument', 'who', 'took', 'last', 'tampon', 'be', 'what', 'everybody', 'herein', 'real', 'well', 'argue', 'mom', 'working', 'diner', 'neighbor', 'installing', 'satellite', 'dish', 'idiot', 'movies', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'focus', 'projector', 'guy', 'heard', 'girl', 'who', 'swallow', ""n't"", 'porn', 'Argue', 'fight', 'then', 'life', 'one', 'ever', 'apologize', 'other', 'one', 'care.If', 'grew', 'up', 'circumstances', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'shocked', 'language', 'felt', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'lighter', 'be', 'forewarned', 'Most', 'small', 'towns', 'pretended', 'be', 'shocked', 'front', 'parents', 'reality', 'hear', 'thesame', 'language', 'everyday.Fairuza', 'Balk', 'narration', 'somewhat', 'more', 'interesting', 'be', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'husband', 'mother', 'first', 'one', 'vanished', 'something', 'dated', 'bunch', 'losers', 'daughter', 'figures', 'finding', 'mom', 'new', 'husband', 'will', 'free', 'restrictions.I', 'passed', 'New', 'Mexico', 'once', 'lifetime', 'as', 'well', 'remember', 'looked', 'lot', 'ilke', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'avoiding', 'usual', 'movie', 'cliches', 'could', 'think', 'anyway', 'slow', 'moving', 'dirt', 'roads', 'pick', 'up', 'trucks', 'trailer', 'parks', 'truckstops', 'realism', 'accurately', 'capture', 'feeling', 'frustration', 'being', 'trapped', 'hick', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'only', 'way', ""'re"", 'woman', 'get', 'married', 'hope', 'escape', 'sort', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'reality', 'point', 'movie', 'real', 'well', 'Life', 'unfair.It', 'definitely', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'sit', 'everyday', 'week', 'once', 'while', 'could', 'see', 'watching', 'just', 'hell']",Gas Food Lodging VHS

328171,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302690420,Randy Keehn,"[0, 0]","My initial impression of ""Gas Food Lodging"", midway through the film, was that it didn't have much to say to me.  I saw a younger teenage daughter in a broken home, a nice well-meaning mother who is exasperated with the older teenage daughter, the older daughter who seems destined for trouble, and some supporting cast that lead me to wonder what was in the town's water.  Things happen and more scenes of disfunction appear.  I began to see that some things were connecting while others were falling apart.  Still no redeeming message until the very end.  At that point all that had happened came together in a most beautiful yet poignant way.  The message was delivered and the film, from my perspective, was endowed with purpose.The next day I thought more and more about ""Gas Food Lodging"".  I understood it as a ""coming of age"" story of a teenage girl.  She saw the redeption of everything in her life coming in the form of expected love.  However, every expression or exanple of love that she witnessed was broken or never real in the first place.  Things kept descending along with her faith that all would be well if everyone could just let it happen.  Her search to find the answers failed until the answers found her.Once the impact of the movie finally sunk in, I was reminded of ""The Last Picture Show"" of 20-some years earlier.  In that book and movie we saw a teenage boy realizing his coming of age in a small Texas town in the middle of nowhere.  Sonny also had trouble finding structure as everything around him seemed to fall apart.  His outcome was not as reassuring as our young heroine's but it, too, ended with hope emerging from tragedy.  Being a teenager is no easy task especially when there is a lack of good role models.  It's easy to get lost, misguided, or trapped in solitary confinement.  ""Gas Food Lodging"" leads us in all those directions and then shows us a future of hope.

328172,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302690420,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Gas Food Lodging (Allison Anders, 1992)I'm easy, I admit it. I'll watch any movie in which Ione Skye appears topless. Lovely woman, she is. Of course, the movie being directed by Allison Anders helps. Lovely movies, she makes.This one concerns a mother (Brooke Adams) raising her two children, the wild older one (Skye) and the bookish younger one (Fairuza Balk) in a little town in the desert. There's young love, there's heartbreak, there's weird, malformed prejudice and hints of magic. Then their father (James Brolin) comes back into the picture, and everyone's world gets turned upside down.Anders has a reputation for making deeply personal, quirky films (Things Behind the Sun, Grace of My Heart, etc.), and Gas Food Lodging is no different. It rambles, basically plotless for much of its length, around these three characters, their friends and adversaries. If you like your films with a good, solid plot, this one's not for you. But Anders has a certain magic touch that seems to work well with the slice-of-life films she so often helms; she is capable of crafting characters the viewer can identify with and care about, and that makes all the difference. I liked this movie a great deal, perhaps more than any of Anders' other movies I've seen, and I definitely recommend it. *** ",4,"Good, like all of Anders' movies.",1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,1292,"['Gas', 'Food', 'Lodging', 'Allison', 'Anders', '1992', ""'m"", 'easy', 'admit', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movie', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'topless', 'Lovely', 'woman', 'course', 'movie', 'being', 'directed', 'Allison', 'Anders', 'Lovely', 'movies', 'makes.This', 'one', 'mother', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'wild', 'older', 'one', 'Skye', 'bookish', 'younger', 'one', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'little', 'town', 'desert', 'young', 'love', 'heartbreak', 'weird', 'malformed', 'prejudice', 'hints', 'magic', 'Then', 'father', 'James', 'Brolin', 'back', 'picture', 'everyone', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down.Anders', 'reputation', 'making', 'deeply', 'personal', 'quirky', 'films', 'Things', 'Sun', 'Grace', 'My', 'Heart', 'etc', 'Gas', 'Food', 'Lodging', 'different', 'basically', 'plotless', 'much', 'length', 'three', 'characters', 'friends', 'adversaries', 'like', 'films', 'good', 'solid', 'plot', 'one', 'not', 'Anders', 'certain', 'magic', 'touch', 'work', 'well', 'slice-of-life', 'films', 'so', 'often', 'helms', 'capable', 'crafting', 'characters', 'viewer', 'can', 'identify', 'care', 'difference', 'liked', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'perhaps', 'more', 'Anders', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'definitely', 'recommend', '***']",Gas Food Lodging VHS
