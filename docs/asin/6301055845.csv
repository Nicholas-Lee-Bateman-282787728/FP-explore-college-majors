""The Last Emperor's"" added scenes, however, only enhance it.  This brilliant epic is far more literate, interesting, and enlightening than most, revealing truths about human nature while educating its audience about some of the most important happenings in 20th Century history.  The mind-blowing shots of China's Forbidden City may be the film's greatest single asset, but the sweeping score and excellent acting certainly don't hurt.  Of course, you can't have a great epic without a great story, and the journey of China's last emperor ""from emperor to citizen"" (as he called his autobiography) is certainly that.  But even a great story requires a great script, and the screenplay for ""The Last Emperor"" avoids bad dialogue and sentimentality, filling the actor's mouths with humanity and truth.  In other words, ""The Last Emperor"" is an epic for the discerning viewer.

By now everyone knows it depicts the life of the last emperor of China during the 1900's. A century full of many evolutionary changes in society. One that says hello to the future and goodbye to old traditional ways. Of course the last emperor of China was a foolish ugly man with no actual control at all. He was just a puppet in died a lonely tragic life. But towards the end of his life he really did come full circle and was able to appreciate his existence even more during rehabilitation. Certain things in the film aren't mention such as the emperor being impotent. He shots blanks so there's no way he could have gotten his wife pregnant. Of course we know in the film that it's the driver who gets her pregnant. But it still should have been revealed that the emperor was impotent and incapable of having a child. I remember watching this movie on HBO way back in the 80's when i was a little kid and always felt a connection with the film. Every time it was on i just had to sit there and watch it in all its 3 hour plus glory. As i've gotten older i have only found even more appreciation for the film as i can understand certain parts better now that i am older. The ironic thing was that during the 80's when the film was released the emperor's real life brother was still alive and still might be alive today. One of my favorite parts of the film is that it was actually shot in the Forbidden City and isn't some fake sound stage. The costumes, music, and acting are beyond lush and on point. Even though I think John Lone who plays the emperor is gay in real life, but I digress. It shows the Chinese culture in a way that perhaps many Americans didn't know existed. This truly is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and with each growing decade it will attract many new legions of fans. Of course this masterpiece was directed by a wonderful phenomenal director who i just adore and also have respect for a lot of his work. But this one is the one film that stands out the most on his resume of impressive films. Bernardo just pushes the envelope like no other director and is ok with racy topics. I am not a huge fan of drama films as they tend to be very dark and hard to watch. But as I mentioned this one is sooo different and really stands out from the crowd.

244272,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6301055845,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 2]","""The Last Emperor"" tells the amazing true story of Pu Yi,the Middle Kingdom's last emperor. From its gripping opening sequence in which the young Pu Yi is torn from his mother's arms to his life as a nobody in the gray blandness of Communist China, it is a powerful spectacle. Ryuichi Sakamoto&David; Byrne's soundtrack captures the epic sweep of the movie. Bernardo Bertolucci's direction is superb&his; international cast is perfect.""The Last Emperor"" begins with Pu Yi being taken to the Forbidden City. He grows up under the shadow of the menacing Empress Dowager; he is incredibly dependent on his voluptuous wet nurse,who still breastfeeds him when he's older. Eunuchs surround him. When he is enthroned as emperor,he's worshipped as a living god. All very heady stuff for a young child. Growing up,he is naive to the eunuchs robbing him blind;he's as much a slave as his own slaves are. Reginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole) comes into Pu Yi's life as the first father figure he's ever had,instructing him in Western culture. In accordance with royal norms, Pu Yi takes a wife Wan Jung (the luminous Joan Chen) and a concubine. When the Chinese Empire is overthrown, Pu Yi is vulnerable to Japan's offer of Manchukuo. They prey on his weakness,his desire for power. Pu Yi's life crumbles around him. His concubine is impregnated by his taxi driver (she gets a forced abortion);his wife carries on a passionate affair with a beautiful female Japanese spy&succumbs; to a fatal opium addiction. Pu Yi's life goes from one form of imprisonment to another. From being imprisoned in the Forbidden City,he goes to being a prisoner of Communism. Communist China is just as oppressive,though it proclaims uniformity&equality.; Instead of spectacles of lamas sounding horns, Pu Yi beholds the spectacle of the Red Army dancing as they wave Mao's Little Red Book. A kindly jailer befriends Pu Yi-only to be killed arbitrarily during the Cultural Revolution. Pu Yi survives Communism; it doesn't save him.""The Last Emperor"" succeeds in painting the portrait of an era. It shows how much China changed over the course of nearly a century. However,there are some interesting details that got lost,for logical reasons. Bertolucci depicts Pu Yi as a passionate heterosexual man,joyously making love to his wife&his; concubine. In fact,Pu Yi never consummated any of his marriages,abandoned his Empress on their wedding night&there;'s compelling speculation that he was in fact gay. Reginald Johnston is depicted as a celibate bachelor. It's true Johnston never married. However,when he returned to Scotland,he had two different girlfriends there,one of whom burned his letters to her after his death.""The Last Emperor"" is a ravishing,sensual spectacle. It inspired me to write an ""alternate history"" in which Wan Jung finds solace&love; in Reginald Johnston's arms instead of getting addicted to opium. One can only wonder what sort of rating this movie would've had if Ang Lee had choreographed love scenes between Peter O'Toole and Joan Chen. Lust,caution indeed. ""The Last Emperor"" is a powerful,superb spectacle.

This film draws one's attention to the matter at hand, not to itself, its director, or any present flaws (to my eye, there are few or none).Indeed, The Last Emperor may be one of the small handful of Perfect Films yet created in the history of film, able and willing to showcase all that is good and all that is necessary about the arts and their ability to drive our own will to identification.I won't bother with plot or synopses here. Suffice it to say that this film is the twentieth century encapsulated, in every best and worst way that one might imagine, somehow made at once informative and accessible. It is the sort of film from which no-one can turn, both pedagogical and affecting, the sort of film that makes grown men cry and cynics pray, even if they're not sure to whom their prayer is addressed.As a final aside: though there are many poor reviews of the DVD media here, the situation is somewhat more mixed than many of them let on. The DVD is indeed of a poorer resolution than most anamorphic widescreen DVDs.

His life encompassed the power struggles of influential warlords, the invasion & occupation by Japan and civil war, which ultimately consolidated the power of the Communist forces under Mao Zedong.Though there are composite characters and omissions, the storyline is highly factual in the film.

244284,A9XKE4OE48BNK,6301055845,Byron,"[30, 31]","This is not a rating of the film, which is excellent, but of this particular edition.Unfortunately Criterion fell into the same trap that the producers of the previous ""Apocalypse Now"" DVDs did.  They allowed  Vittorio Storaro, the original cinematographer, to tamper with the widescreen image. Storaro has been on a crusade for the last few years to advocate 2.00:1 as the most desirable widescreen aspect ratio. This is fine if applied to new productions but, disastrously, he wants to demonstrate his passion for this by going back and chopping up movies he worked on in years past.  Despite whatever care he may have taken in this project, it is painfully obvious in many scenes that some of the screen image has been cropped from the sides.  I compared this to the scenes in their original ratio of 2.35 and there is significant information missing. In tight scenes inside cars you often lose portions of people seated on either side of the picture. The worst for me, though, was what happened to a couple of the breathtaking scenes where the child emperor is viewing the large assembled crowd of his subjects. In the original framing you can see the complete perfectly symmetrical formations filling the screen and perfectly tapering off right at the edges of the picture. In this version chunks of that image are chopped off on either side and a lot of the power and beauty of the scene is diminished.I had been eagerly anticipating this release but the butchering of the image took all of the joy out of it for me. Even though other aspects of the package such as the extras are very nice and well done, I ended up selling off my copyI'm surprised and disappointed that Criterion let something like this happen.Fortunately the new Apocalypse Now blu-ray has corrected the previous poor decision and is restoring that movie to its original 2.35 widescreen aspect ratio. I just hope that Criterion, or someone, will do the same thing somewhere down the line and give us a proper release of The Last Emperor.It's been frustrating since the previous Artisan DVD was in the proper aspect ratio but the transfer itself was horrible. The visual quality of this transfer is a huge improvement but the picture is chopped.

The acting is superb, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the story is significant if not moving.  If you are a movie lover you will certainly appreciate the beauty and power of this film.  So why only 3 stars?  I simply can't give the DVD more than 3 stars, becuase quite frankly, this movie deserves a better film transfer and better audio on DVD.  The picture is sub-par when you compare it to almost all the new DVD releases today, and the sound is a little better, but not by much.  Perhaps the studio should revisit this title and clean it up with a loaded new special edition release with a squeaky clean anamorphic picture transfer with DD 5.1 and DTS sound to boast.  This DVD's director's cut is also much longer than the original, which in my opinion, doesn't hurt the film at all, but it doesn't improve the film drastically either.

I found this odd, since I thought that one of the film's finer points were its performances.In this film, Pu-Yi grows to a man who was deposed as the last emperor of China while still a child, and thus he wanders from country to country as a young man who is wealthy but without purpose. Thus, never really coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer king, he jumps at the chance to sell himself out as a puppet to the Japanese when they offer him the opportunity to rule at least part of China again. As Emperor of Manchukuo, Pu-Yi is blind to the barborous acts and experiments that the Japanese perform upon his subjects, blind to the fact that his wife has an affair with a servant to produce a royal heir, and most of all, blind to his role as puppet in the Japanese scheme for world domination. Not until the end of World War II does he seem to even have an inkling of what has been going on.Now for the part of the movie to which I really object. Although it is compelling to see Pu-Yi slowly owe up to his responsibility for what happened in China during the Japanese occupation and come to terms with the fact that he is, after all, just a man like any other man, I strongly object to the Maoists as the good-guys in this quest for redemption. The Communist Chinese did the same type of reindoctrination on many other people - among them Christian missionaries, Buddhist monks, and believers in democracy and a free press - anyone who simply got in their way and needed their world view ""readjusted"". On top of that, how the Communists reindoctrinate people in this film is G-rated compared to what really went on in such camps. For details, consult the novel ""1984"". These points are completely whitewashed. Without the flaw of the portrayal of the Communist Chinese as the patient and kindly savers of lost souls this would have pretty much been a perfect film.

For inevitably the reason given for shortening the films is that ""audiences won't be able to sit through something that long,"" when in fact they're truncated so that theaters can have more show times and thus sell more tickets.)If you've only seen the shortened version of THE LAST EMPEROR (the one that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1987), then you should definitely check out this disc. On the other hand, the full length version of THE LAST EMPEROR has been available to laserdisc player owners for several years through a grey-market Japanese import. If you've seen that disc, this DVD will come less as a revelation than as a disappointment. It's not that it doesn't improve on the Japanese disc (which had a fairly murky transfer). It just doesn't take full advantage of DVD's superior color fidelity, resolution and contrast.Nor is the transfer 16:9 enhanced, an odd omission for a film so thoroughly dependent on widescreen composition. The audio is a definite improvement over the Japanese disc, but why wasn't more attention paid to color and texture in the imagery? This was the last film Bertolucci made with both cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti. It would be nice to see the final collaboration of the team who created THE CONFORMIST, one of the most visually significant films in the history of cinema, given the due it deserves. It's not that the disc is bad; it just doesn't *sing* the way it ought.Then again, neither does the movie. THE LAST EMPEROR is handsome, stately, a trifle dull and more than a little safe. It compares favorably with other big budget spectaculars like DOCTOR ZHIVAGO or GONE WITH THE WIND or SPARTACUS, but it falls short of Bertolucci's best work or great History Films like ANDREI RUBLEV or THE RED AND THE WHITE or THE LEOPARD. It is certainly pleasant, occasionally interesting, and beautifully manicured. What it isn't is the extraordinary celebration of life and film that Bertolucci at his best provides. No wonder it won so many awards; it's as homogenized and prettified (though not quite as aimless) as the Oscar ceremony itself.",4,Ho hum,969580800,"09 22, 2000",2000,2497,"['One', 'nicest', 'things', 'home', 'video', 'particularly', 'DVD', 'see', 'full-length', 'versions', 'films', 'studios', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'enjoy', 'theaters', 'practice', 'mutilating', 'longer', 'films', 'particularly', 'non-American', 'ones', 'one', 'most', 'insulting', 'habits', 'Hollywood', 'developed', 'lot', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'hypocritical', 'inevitably', 'reason', 'given', 'shortening', 'films', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'something', 'long', 'when', 'fact', ""'re"", 'truncated', 'so', 'theaters', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'show', 'times', 'thus', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'shortened', 'version', 'THE', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'one', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', '1987', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'disc', 'other', 'hand', 'full', 'length', 'version', 'THE', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'been', 'available', 'laserdisc', 'player', 'owners', 'several', 'years', 'grey-market', 'Japanese', 'import', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'disc', 'DVD', 'will', 'come', 'revelation', 'disappointment', 'not', ""n't"", 'improve', 'Japanese', 'disc', 'had', 'fairly', 'murky', 'transfer', 'just', ""n't"", 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'DVD', 'superior', 'color', 'fidelity', 'resolution', 'contrast.Nor', 'transfer', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'odd', 'omission', 'film', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'dependent', 'widescreen', 'composition', 'audio', 'definite', 'improvement', 'Japanese', 'disc', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'attention', 'paid', 'color', 'texture', 'imagery', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'Bertolucci', 'made', 'cinematographer', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'designer', 'Ferdinando', 'Scarfiotti', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'final', 'collaboration', 'team', 'who', 'created', 'THE', 'CONFORMIST', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'significant', 'films', 'history', 'cinema', 'given', 'due', 'not', 'disc', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", '*sing*', 'way', 'again', 'movie', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'handsome', 'stately', 'trifle', 'dull', 'more', 'little', 'safe', 'favorably', 'other', 'big', 'budget', 'spectaculars', 'DOCTOR', 'ZHIVAGO', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'SPARTACUS', 'short', 'Bertolucci', 'best', 'work', 'great', 'History', 'Films', 'ANDREI', 'RUBLEV', 'THE', 'RED', 'AND', 'THE', 'WHITE', 'THE', 'LEOPARD', 'certainly', 'pleasant', 'occasionally', 'interesting', 'beautifully', 'manicured', 'What', ""n't"", 'extraordinary', 'celebration', 'life', 'film', 'Bertolucci', 'best', 'wonder', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'homogenized', 'prettified', 'not', 'quite', 'aimless', 'Oscar', 'ceremony']",N/A

It is quite simply of godawful design both functionally and aesthetically. The still image they chose for the cover graphic is both boring and pretentious. Beth Dorfsman...where are you?How the mighty have fallen. I remember the days when Criterion Laserdiscs were the ultimate home video indulgence. Their design was nearly always leagues above the competition, as was their commitment to providing outstanding liner notes, superior transfers -- the whole experience. If you would have shown me this pathetic little piece of cardboard back in 1990 I would have been utterly flabbergasted. Although Criterion did not release an LD of The Last Emperor, we all owned gorgeous Japanese imports with glossy black gatefold jackets, one of which displayed an entire diagram of the Forbidden City. I understand that the very small format of Blu-Ray provides some challenges, but Criterion has delivered outstanding presentations on recent releases such as ""If..."" ""Jigoku"" and many others.I also think it is a cynical, telling move that they did not include the Director's Cut on this release. It is quite simply so you will not flood the market with the Standard-Def version and they can do a shameless double-dip. And this is from the guys who are so concerned with you the viewer, right?Alas, the transfer also does not look particularly stellar. There is of course higher resolution but this soft image is certainly not a show-off title in your collection. Honestly, I watched the film on Laserdisc a couple of years ago and I enjoyed it every bit as much then if not more.

244294,ATYKXNLVOZN02,6301055845,Constant Viewer,"[0, 0]","This grandiose film has conquered audiences by its sheer beauty and by an intriguing alternation of scenes from Pu-Yi's early life as emperor with moments later in his life when he was a former emperor and even later, when he was a prisoner of the Communist Chinese government.  The early imperial scenes are beautifully observed and strike the viewer as convincing recreations of life inside the Forbidden City in the Manchu Dynasty's final years.  In particular the dying Dowager Empress' final moments ring true,  right down to the insertion of a black pearl in the dead woman's mouth (it was stolen when her tomb was ransacked during the Chinese Civil Wars of the 1930s).  The scene of the child Pu Yi's coronation, a ceremony conducted in private in contrast to the splendid installation rituals of the West, is interrupted when the boy is distracted by a curtain fluttering in the wind; he runs through it to encounter vast courtyards of dignitaries and officials in their carefully serried ranks.  Such moments contrast the child's unguarded innocence and the vast machinery of government he is supposed to operate.  Ultimately the Manchu line is brought to an end and replaced by a republican government, but the boy emperor remains confined within the Forbidden City, which thus assumes its full identity as the first of the prisons he will occupy. Whether it is any more enjoyable to him, as a palace, than are the squalid Communist prisons he later occupies, is perhaps the central question the film poses.  That question is never fully answered, but for that very reason the film sends the viewer away wondering.  In recent decades we have seen the sad, ultimately tragic consequences, played out on a world stage, of the lives of those who come to regard themselves as palace prisoners.

244297,AUHG8KSHI529U,6301055845,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","I think this is a beautiful film of a tragic and pathetic story.  It begins with a baby being ripped from his mother and brought to the palace for cruel political reasons.  He is raised as the Emperor of China, but is in reality a prisoner of those who benefit from the illusion and structure of that power the boy never gets to wield.Pu Yi's rumored non-traditional sexual development is handled delicately in the movie and is part of his pathetic character development.  Including his trying to pass off his wife's pregnancy from his driver as his to the Japanese, when they are already well aware and murder the baby when it is born and take the wife away to finish her destruction through opium.The story told as a series of scenes reflected upon as Pu Yi goes through his re-education in a communist prison camp.  If I have one criticism of the film, it is that it is far too soft on the horrors of Mao's regime.  It was no less corrupt than what went before and was more thoroughly vicious.  What it did offer was a more consistent order.  It was an order of terror and misery, but it was order.John Lone is fabulous as Pu Yi as was Joan Chen as Wan Jung.  Peter O'Toole is very fine as the English bachelor tutor, Reginald Johnston.  Ruocheng Ying gives my personally favorite performance as the man in charge of the detention center and therefore in charge of re-educating the Emperor.  When Pu Yi sees him later as a denounced prisoner of the insane children's brigades, I think it is a very touching scene.I wish we would see more of Victor Wong.  Here he plays Pu Yi's valet and his conflict of still being the Emperor's servant and not being his servant in prison is one of the many treasures in this movie.  He is a very fine actor.There is much more to see in this movie and the DVD has done us the favor of giving us an hour of additional footage that makes this story even richer.  For me, the length of the movie adds to its beauty and emotional impact.  It is a tragedy that takes time to develop and express its sorrow.

Director Bertolucci manages to create not only a complex empathy for his protagonist, but he also manages to allow us to share in the young boy's claustrophobia.  The effect is stunning and the film deserves its academy awards.  Everything is top-notch in this film.  The acting is superb, the script is great, the visual shots of the Forbidden City are simply stunning, and the story is an epic tale, full of intrigue and human emotion.  THE LAST EMPEROR is a piece of art and an emotional piece at that.Of course, the film is quite long.  I did not see the original release of THE LAST EMPEROR, so I cannot comment on whether the Director's Cut made a wise decision in lengthening an already long film.  I think that the length serves the film well in that it does not rush the storyline and allows the audience to sink into its reality.  However, I found myself much more interested in Pu Yi's childhood than his later adult life.  If any scenes had to be sacrificed, I would choose these later scenes.  But, despite its length, THE LAST EMPEROR is a great film by any standards and deserves a place on your shelf.",5,An Epic Film that Captures its Audience Inside the Walls,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1648,"['film', '218', 'minutes', 'can', 'still', 'create', 'enough', 'interest', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'not', 'portray', 'story', 'China', 'final', 'monarch', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'young', 'boy', 'brought', 'enclosed', 'walls', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'replace', 'real', 'emperor', 'Instead', 'film', 'time', 'period', 'story', 'watching', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'transported', 'walls', 'Director', 'Bertolucci', 'create', 'not', 'only', 'complex', 'empathy', 'protagonist', 'also', 'allow', 'share', 'young', 'boy', 'claustrophobia', 'effect', 'stunning', 'film', 'academy', 'awards', 'Everything', 'top-notch', 'film', 'acting', 'superb', 'script', 'great', 'visual', 'shots', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'are', 'simply', 'stunning', 'story', 'epic', 'tale', 'full', 'intrigue', 'human', 'emotion', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'piece', 'art', 'emotional', 'piece', 'that.Of', 'course', 'film', 'quite', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'release', 'THE', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Director', 'Cut', 'made', 'wise', 'decision', 'lengthening', 'already', 'long', 'film', 'think', 'length', 'film', 'well', 'not', 'rush', 'storyline', 'audience', 'sink', 'reality', 'However', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'childhood', 'later', 'adult', 'life', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'would', 'choose', 'later', 'scenes', 'length', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'great', 'film', 'standards', 'place', 'shelf']",N/A

In fact, I saw it twice just to immerse myself in it. But I do agree that the fuller TV-released version of the film, included on Disc 2 of the new Criterion collection, tells a deeper, more gripping story.As a longtime journalist, who has started reporting from Asia occasionally in the last several years, I know how vitally important it is for Americans to find windows into this powerfully emerging part of our world. Every indication suggests that world history is turning in the direction of a Chinese ascendancy in this 21st Century -- but we know so little about Chinese culture, geography and history.As a longtime specialist in analyzing the impact of spirituality on contemporary life, I'm watching the spread of Asian influences around the globe -- and I realize that we understand very little about this emerging realm.Bertolucci doesn't give us a full vision of China. His film was made more than 20 years ago -- and his subject stretches back a century before that. But this is a very important film about understanding Chinese history -- and Western cultural appreciation of that world. Disc four, really, was my favorite in this new set. The lengthy historical documentary with Ian Buruma -- and even the intriguing interview with David Byrne about the creation of music for the film -- are really enlightening.I recommend this Criterion set as THE way to explore the world of this film -- and the world of the filmmakers trying to peer into China -- and our emerging world as we all try to peer across the Pacific into this realm.",5,"Finally, a Complete Version of ""Last Emperor"" That Helps Us Make Sense of This Globally Important Story",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1658,"['longtime', 'Bertolucci', 'fan', 'was', 'fascinated', 'even', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'fact', 'saw', 'twice', 'just', 'immerse', 'do', 'agree', 'fuller', 'TV-released', 'version', 'film', 'included', 'Disc', '2', 'new', 'Criterion', 'collection', 'deeper', 'more', 'gripping', 'story.As', 'longtime', 'journalist', 'who', 'started', 'reporting', 'Asia', 'occasionally', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'know', 'how', 'vitally', 'important', 'Americans', 'find', 'windows', 'powerfully', 'emerging', 'part', 'world', 'indication', 'world', 'history', 'turning', 'direction', 'Chinese', 'ascendancy', '21st', 'Century', 'know', 'so', 'little', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'geography', 'history.As', 'longtime', 'specialist', 'analyzing', 'impact', 'spirituality', 'contemporary', 'life', ""'m"", 'watching', 'spread', 'Asian', 'influences', 'globe', 'realize', 'understand', 'very', 'little', 'emerging', 'realm.Bertolucci', ""n't"", 'give', 'full', 'vision', 'China', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'more', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'subject', 'stretches', 'back', 'century', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'understanding', 'Chinese', 'history', 'Western', 'cultural', 'appreciation', 'world', 'Disc', 'four', 'really', 'was', 'favorite', 'new', 'set', 'lengthy', 'historical', 'documentary', 'Ian', 'Buruma', 'even', 'intriguing', 'interview', 'David', 'Byrne', 'creation', 'music', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'enlightening.I', 'recommend', 'Criterion', 'set', 'way', 'explore', 'world', 'film', 'world', 'filmmakers', 'trying', 'peer', 'China', 'emerging', 'world', 'try', 'peer', 'Pacific', 'realm']",N/A
244305,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,6301055845,David E. Levine,"[7, 11]","My attention did not wane while waching this long film. This is the story of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, who was installed at the age of three. At a very young age, he learned that he could do whatever he wanted to do. However, within a few years, when he was still a pre teenage boy, he discovered that China became a repubilic and that he was only a figurehead, as he reigned in the cloistered Forbidden City. He was living in a beautiful setting, with an English tutor played by Peter O'Tole but, he was basically a prisoner in this setting. As he grew, his life continually changed. He married both the woman who by virtue of the union was the Empress as well as a ""secondary consort."" He began to modernize, cutting his hair and playing tennis in western style tennis clothes. Another change in China forced him to flee where he became a western style playboy.As the Japanese overrran Manchuria, he was reinstalled there and, quite frankly was duped. He was a figurehead and altough purportedly, he was a sovereign Emperor, the equal of Japan's Hirohito, in fact, it was Hirohito who was in control. As he returned to his old title, the old traditions were gone as he now dressed in modern military uniforms. Ultimately, the Communists took over and he was imprisoned and ""re-educated"" as he became a common citizen. This is not so much an action movie as it is the unfolding of a process. It is experiential for the viewer. The movie is sort of set in 1950 Communist China with the bulk of the movie being flashbacks to 1908 when he was installed, on forward. Finally, the movie moves beyond 1950, ultimately to 1967. It is beautifully filmed and superbly directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. It certainly held my attention thus, five stars.Now, here is my reservation: this movie won the 1987 academy award for best picture. This director's cut adds about 55 minutes to the legnth of the film. Yes, it's long but that is not my reservation. Rather, since the movie won best picture, I would like to see what the members of the academy saw when they bestowed that honor. A movie that is nearly an hour longer is not the same one that won best picture. I think that this should be a two dvd set with one showing the picture as it was released and the other showing the additional scenes.",5,Five stars with a reservation,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2294,"['attention', 'did', 'not', 'wane', 'waching', 'long', 'film', 'story', 'last', 'emperor', 'China', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'who', 'was', 'installed', 'age', 'three', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'learned', 'could', 'do', 'wanted', 'do', 'However', 'few', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'pre', 'teenage', 'boy', 'discovered', 'China', 'became', 'repubilic', 'was', 'only', 'figurehead', 'reigned', 'cloistered', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'was', 'living', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'English', 'tutor', 'played', 'Peter', ""O'Tole"", 'was', 'basically', 'prisoner', 'setting', 'grew', 'life', 'continually', 'changed', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'virtue', 'union', 'was', 'Empress', 'as', 'well', 'secondary', 'consort', 'began', 'modernize', 'cutting', 'hair', 'playing', 'tennis', 'western', 'style', 'tennis', 'clothes', 'change', 'China', 'forced', 'flee', 'where', 'became', 'western', 'style', 'playboy.As', 'Japanese', 'overrran', 'Manchuria', 'was', 'reinstalled', 'there', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'duped', 'was', 'figurehead', 'altough', 'purportedly', 'was', 'sovereign', 'Emperor', 'equal', 'Japan', 'Hirohito', 'fact', 'was', 'Hirohito', 'who', 'was', 'control', 'returned', 'old', 'title', 'old', 'traditions', 'were', 'gone', 'now', 'dressed', 'modern', 'military', 'uniforms', 'Ultimately', 'Communists', 'took', 'over', 'was', 'imprisoned', 're-educated', 'became', 'common', 'citizen', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'movie', 'unfolding', 'process', 'experiential', 'viewer', 'movie', 'sort', 'set', '1950', 'Communist', 'China', 'bulk', 'movie', 'being', 'flashbacks', '1908', 'when', 'was', 'installed', 'forward', 'Finally', 'movie', '1950', 'ultimately', '1967', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'superbly', 'directed', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'certainly', 'held', 'attention', 'thus', 'five', 'stars.Now', 'here', 'reservation', 'movie', 'won', '1987', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'picture', 'director', 'cut', '55', 'minutes', 'legnth', 'film', 'Yes', 'long', 'not', 'reservation', 'Rather', 'movie', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'members', 'academy', 'saw', 'when', 'bestowed', 'honor', 'movie', 'nearly', 'hour', 'longer', 'not', 'same', 'one', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'two', 'dvd', 'set', 'one', 'showing', 'picture', 'was', 'released', 'other', 'showing', 'additional', 'scenes']",N/A

Allen,"[3, 4]","The Last Emperor (1987) Starring John Lone Informs Us ""It's Lonely At The Top.""The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone, Joan Chen, and Peter O'Toole won the ""Best Picture"" Academy Award for 1987, and is a curious departure from movies which usually win that honor.The movie is about China and a man chosen by the Chinese Empress Dowager in 1908 to be the next Emperor of China (the little boy named ""Pu Yi"" was one of many princes the polygamous and dead former Chinese Emperor left behind, and was not the son of the Empress Dowager).The toddler aged little boy begins his life in the monster royal palace in Peking (later renamed ""Beijing"") in a royal building complex called the Forbidden City, and grows to early manhood there.China becomes a Republic in 1911, and the Chinese Monarchy ends, but the young Emperor is allowed to continue life in the Forbidden City into his early manhood in the 1920's when he and his two young wives are evicted by the unstable, warlord dominated, constantly changing government system which had replaced the monarchy.The young evicted monarch and his wives keep their considerable fortune, and move to a coastal city in China and live ""the good life"" as rich people there until 1931 when the former Manchuria (NW China) becomes a newly named country called ""Manchukuo"" and the young ex-Emperor of China is installed as the new monarch of the new country.He remains in that job as Head Of State until the end of World War II, and is taken prisoner by the invading Russians who turn him over to the Chinese Communists who gain control of China in 1949, and keep the former Emperor of China and Monarch of Manchuria (aka Manchukuo) imprisoned for 10 years until he is released in bad health in 1959, only 53 years old, but looking much older, and clearly a broken man.His final years are spent in Peking (Beijing) where he dies in 1967 during the Chinese Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao organized to delay the invasion of capitalist money into China and the start of China as a huge sweatshop for WalMart and other western business enterprises.The Emperor had a rich and glamorous life up to 1945, and a hard life from 1945 when the Communists were about to take over China, which they achieved in 1949.The movie starts out showing the Emperor as a prisoner in 1950, and we see his former expensive ""easy living"" life in flash backs. The Communists who imprisoned the Emperor throughout the 1950's demanded that the Emperor confess his crimes, sins, shortcomings, etc. etc., and the movie alternates between his time in the 1950's as a prisoner when he recalls his past, and flash backs of his memories of it.The prison life he lives is dull and gray and awful and ugly. The previous life is colorful and attractive in most ways.The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone is a visual treat since most of the movie centers around ""the good old days"" of the Emperor's pre-1945 life in the Forbidden City, as a rich civilian in a coastal Chinese city in the 1920's, and as Monarch of Manachuria (aka Manchukuo)from 1931 through 1945.The colors, particularly the gaudy use of red and gold, are dazzling.The music score and presentation in the movie are very well done.The movie is a 1980's Reagan era ""rich is best, greed is good"" testimonial. The Chinese Emperor lives like Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas who won a Best Actor Academy Award in 1987 for his portrayal of an Ivan Boesky type character...wheeler dealer sleezebag Wall Street type rich guy famous for being ruthless) did in the movie titled ""Wall Street"" (1987) also starring Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah.

244309,A3MCC5MAJYJYMD,6301055845,Dhaval Vyas,"[3, 10]","'The Last Emperor' is the story of a man who is not the least bit interesting. The emperor is living better than a God in his palace city while the Chinese people are living worse than his mouse. Trust me, the emperor's dog, if he had one, was probably living better than the Chinese people. The only thing I saw this man really ""doing"" during the entire film was play tennis. Other than that, he just sits or stands there expressionless letting events happen around him. No doubt, the filmmaking is impressive, but a movie cannot rely solely on that. Also, the movie portrays the Empress Dowager as some kind of enigmatic god-like creature. In reality, the Empress was an extremely cruel woman who does not deserve to be protrayed the way she was.

244312,A29VKODW4R5U7W,6301055845,dooby,"[113, 119]","I won't go into the movie itself. It is already well known. It swept the Oscars winning all 9 for which it was nominated, including Best Picture and Best Director. A first for an independent foreign film. It is an historical epic about a culture which until then was little known in the West. It tells the story of China's Last Emperor, a weak and ineffectual man who came to the throne hailed as The Son of Heaven and The Lord of 10,000 Years. His misfortune was to be born at the twilight of Imperial Rule in China. Enthroned as a God, he is cast out by Chinese Republicans, used as a puppet by the invading Japanese, humiliated by the Communists and then ""re-educated"" to finally become a ""useful"" member of society - a common gardener. It is the story of one man's tragedy and of an ancient civilisation's painful march into the modern era. A film not to be missed.This is a truly magnificent set. Criterion at its best. Spread over 4 discs, it includes both versions of the film, fully restored and remastered, plus an additional 6 hours worth of Extras; about everything you could possibly want to know about the film, the director or the central character, Pu Yi.The roaring controversy however is over the decision to crop the film from its original 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio down to a narrower 2:1. Vittorio Storaro who was responsible for this has defended his action and Criterion has taken the line that they follow the wishes of the creator. However after having seen the new cropped versions, my preference is still for the older 2.35:1 widescreen.The newer versions by and large look fine and you won't notice the cropping unless you do a 1 to 1 comparison. However in more than a few scenes, the new visual composition looks askew - awkward and ugly. Scenes that were originally perfectly framed now appear inadvertently cropped - arms, ears, sometimes whole figures are cut in half - Eg. during the enthronement of little Pu Yi, the court official who issues the proclamation is standing toward the left edge of the screen but is otherwise supposed to be fully visible. In the new 2:1 crop for the TV version, he is cut into half. In the new 2:1 crop for the Theatrical version, the panning is more to the left and only his arm is missing. This is just one of many instances which infuriate viewers. Criterion should remember that its customers are avid cinephiles who scrutinise films in minutest detail and expect faithfulness to the original release. I for one do not take kindly to a creator coming back to redo his work with the result that it looks uglier than before. Especially when I know that he has an ulterior motive for the revision.For those who are still unaware, Vittorio Storaro pioneered a new film format in 1998 called Univisium (aka Univision) which just so happens to have a 2:1 aspect ratio. It is intended as a compromise format between the 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio and the new 1.78:1 widescreen TV aspect ratio. Storaro wants his new 2:1 aspect ratio to be the new universal aspect ratio for all films. So far only he has used it in shooting his newer films. No one else is interested so he has gone about reformatting (cropping) all the older films he has shot into this new 2:1 Univisium format. He has already mutilated Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" to the chagrin of film fans worldwide. Now he has come round to mangling Bernado Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"".His various statements in support of this cropping are illogical, contradictory and at points ludicrous. The question is, when did he first consciously compose his pictures for the 2:1 format? Criterion cites Storaro's claim that ""The Last Emperor was the first film he shot specifically for 2.0 framing"". Storaro on an earlier occasion had already made the claim that he first conceived of shooting for 2.0 during the filming of ""Apocalypse Now"" way back in 1978. He said this in support of his cropping the war classic down from its original 2.35:1 to 2:1 for its Redux Edition and subsequent video transfer. These two statements are patently contradictory and cannot both be correct.Both ""Last Emperor"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" were shot in Technovision which is in 2.35:1. The only format using 2:1 aspect ratio at that time was the old SuperScope. Why choose 2.35:1 Technovision, when (as he now insists) he wanted to shoot in a 2:1 aspect all along? Criterion also trots out the red herring that the producers had initially hoped to release it on 70mm. But that means composing for 2.2:1 not an odd ratio like 2:1. Actually I personally believe the films were indeed composed for 2.2:1 and they would look just right if reframed in that ratio. The only reason for cropping it down to 2:1 is to accommodate Storaro's new Univisium format. For all the Storaro apologists out there (and there are many), the Oscars he won for ""Last Emperor"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" were for the films in their original 2.35:1 presentation NOT the new 2:1 crops. I hope Criterion bans him from supervising any more transfers of his old films. In his monomaniacal quest to promote his Univisium dream, he has become more like a vandal than an artist.But enough carping. Aside from the cropping issue, Criterion's transfer of The Last Emperor is the best so far. Truly gorgeous picture quality. One caveat however. The 218min TV Version is not up to the quality of the Theatrical Cut. The TV version is darker, grainier, softer, cooler and has slightly higher contrast. You'll notice it immediately if you watch the films one after the other. Still, it's good enough to eclipse any previous versions.A minor detail on the TV version: The single profanity uttered in the original film - where the Red Guard curses Pu Yi during the Cultural Revolution, has now been eliminated. In the TV version, the original ""F___ Off,"" has been replaced with a more polite ""Buzz Off"".The Extras are what make this Criterion set really worth getting.There are 2hr 40mins worth of extras on Disc 3 and another 2hr 45mins worth of extras on Disc 4. I especially liked the Southbank Show's 61min Special Edition (British ITV Production) on the Making of The Last Emperor. It includes interviews with Pu Jie, the Emperor's younger brother, as well as the prison governor who helped ""re-educate"" him. We also get to see archive footage of the real Pu Yi, as the Japanese puppet in Manchuria, his capture by Russian paratroopers, his testimony at the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, and finally his ""re-education"" at a Chinese labour camp.On more than one occasion, Bertolucci speaks of the penultimate ""Cricket"" scene as a metaphor for freedom or metamorphosis. Personally I see the cricket as a symbol of renewal or rebirth. (Every year the cricket dies in autumn only to be reborn once again in spring.) That penultimate scene where Pu Yi disappears into the mists of history and the cricket slowly emerges from its wooden box is for me one of the most poetic in cinema history - it marks a new beginning, a rebirth for both Pu Yi and for his country. The final scene itself is delicious in its mix of cheery sarcasm and sadness. As the loud jarring notes of ""Yankee Doodle"" resound in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, we watch in dismay as hordes of chattering tourists come pouring in. And the bitter reality dawns on us - 2,100 years of Imperial Glory have been reduced to nothing more than a tourist attraction.Of the extras, only 3 are brand new. On Disc 1 is ""Making The Last Emperor"" a new 45min documentary with interviews of the technical crew that swept the Oscars. One fascinating titbit was that the replica of the Empress Dowager's Golden Robes weighed in at an astonishing 50lbs because it was made out of gold-plated aluminium. The old lady playing the Empress Dowager spent 1 week in hospital recuperating from exhaustion after the filming. The second new documentary is a 25min interview with composer David Byrne on both his and Ryuichi Sakamoto's collaborative efforts in producing the splendid score. Ironically the most eastern sounding pieces were written by Byrne while Sakamoto wrote most of the more western sounding music. The documentary ""Beyond the Forbidden City"" hosted by Professor Ian Buruma, is a 45min, ""Cliffs Notes"" version of China's tumultuous years, from the reign of the Empress Dowager CiXi (Tsu-Hsi) who selected Pu Yi as her heir, to the end of Imperial Rule, the Japanese invasion, the Chinese Civil War, Mao Tse Tung's disastrous Great Leap Forward (where 30-million Chinese died at the hands of their own government), culminating in the madness of Mao's lunatic Cultural Revolution, during which Pu Yi himself passed away - or as the Empress Dowager would have put it ""The Emperor is on High. He is riding the Dragon now.""Criterion's set comes with a sumptuous 98-page booklet printed on thick glossy paper and filled with handsome photos and articles.

It's also an essay on the corrupting power of an absurdly sheltered life. Following the private and public trials of Puyi, who ascended to the imperial throne before his fourth birthday, it's one soul-crunching onslaught of manipulation after another over the course of several decades. Almost every single member of the cast is either disgustingly entitled or a steadfast, unwavering fanatic to a self-serving cause, including the emperor himself who often falls into both camps. He's naive and misguided, a result of his isolated regal upbringing, but also wants desperately to make a lasting positive mark on the world. It's frustrating to watch his attempts at reform explode on the launchpad over and over again due to the oppressive presence of a corrupt group of advisors, a hamstring he's never able to overcome. Though it has a tendency to linger far too long, the film is drop-dead gorgeous when it's set inside China's famous forbidden city.

Here goes the UK release review, just in case you may be considering an alternative to this one:Nothing to be said about the movie, it is just a masterpiece. But this tranfer is awful. Scene by scene comparison shows that it is not signficantly better than the upgraded dvd. Details are blurry, and the DNR is so excessive that it is distracting. Plus, following the US release, it has cropped the sides to show an artificial 2.00:1 ratio instead of the original 2.35:1 ratio. A disaster.

244326,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6301055845,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[9, 13]","This film, along with 1900, are Bernardo Bertolucci's greatest films (so far).  The Last Emperor is one of my all time favorites, safely secure in my top ten list.  The late Gene Siskel called this film ""one of the greatest films I've seen since I became a film critic"" (I'm paraphrasing here).  It's one of the most mysterious, beguiling, and transendant epics ever made.The film is remarkable for many reasons.  Bertolucci's career was on the wane at the time.  He's a marvelous filmmaker, but he's been erratic his whole career, going for long periods without making any films, and making uneven films as well.  This film came at a time when Bertolucci wasn't really respected by critics at large.  His previous two films, Luna and Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man, were pretty much dismissed by critics and audiences alike (especially the latter).  Somehow, Jeremy Thomas, a fabulous producer, managed to scrap together funds for this film, and after the film was completed, Bertolucci had returned to his top form, making arguably his best film.  The film, on paper, is a recipe for disaster.  It had no known stars, it's directed by a filmmaker who doesn't make blockbusters, it's about a little known Chinese emperor (little known in the West, anyway), it's a long film, and it's a long, costly shoot (though not as much as other epic films).  Yet, it's a rare film where everything seems to work.The film is also remarkable that it's one of the few Best Picture Oscar winner that not only deserves its wins, but is a real work of art.  The Best Picture Oscar, unfortunately, has been known to go to films of dubious or questionable quality, or to films that are safe and non-controversial (remember the Brokeback Mountain vs. Crash controversy).  Very rarely does an artistic work like this even get nominated, much less win in every category it's nominated in.  The film isn't a feel good, easy to digest Best Picture.  It's a demanding film, one that you have to use every portion of your eyes to adore.  It's so immensely challenging visually and thematically.  Perhaps the Academy was so overwhelmed by the beauty and majesty of this film that they felt compelled to give it the awards it so richly deserved.The Criterion version of this film does it complete justice.  You get two versions of the film.  You get the original 164 minute, theatrical version and the 218 minute TV version.  Bertolucci said that the director's cut of this film is the 164 minute version, not the longer version.  I was always under the impression that the 218 minute cut was his film.  It wasn't.  Bertolucci was under contract to deliver a longer version for Chinese television, and that's what the longer version is.  It's not a director's cut.  Many assumed (including me) that since the 5 1/4 hour version of 1900 was a director's cut (which it is, and it's available on DVD now), that the television version of The Last Emperor was as well.  It is not.As for the controversy of the ""new"" framing, it isn't like Bertolucci wasn't there to approve this transfer.  He's very much alive and I know that Bernardo isn't going to let his film be squeezed and butchered by his cinematographer, Vittorio Storario (one of the best ever).  When they both say the film was intended to be shown in a 2:1 aspect ratio, I believe them.  The transfer for the 164 minute version is the best I've ever seen it.  The early Artisan DVD is an abomination.  Colors and textures are butchered, which is insulting, considering how beautiful this film is.  I accept that this is the proper framing.  When Berlin Alexanderplatz was restored, it was overseen by Xaver Schwarzenberger, the original cinemtographer.  Many were angry at Xaver for ""tinkering"" with Fassbinder's film, but Xaver knew the material better than anyone (except maybe Fassbinder himself), and he was the only one who really had any credibility over the transfer.  There is no discernible reason as to why a cinemtographer would butcher his own work, and that includes Xaver and Vittorio.This set has many, many extras, almost as expansive as the film itself, and a 90 page booklet with interviews, essays, and articles about the film, the production, and Chinese history.  This set (and the film) are endlessly fascinating, and for any serious cinema person out there (and you know who you are), this is a must film.  It's one of my top ten films, and it's so ravishing and enthralling I never really get tired of seeing it.",5,A film that solidifies my faith in cinema....,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,4463,"['film', '1900', 'are', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'greatest', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'safely', 'secure', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'late', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'called', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'became', 'film', 'critic', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'one', 'most', 'mysterious', 'beguiling', 'transendant', 'epics', 'ever', 'made.The', 'film', 'remarkable', 'many', 'reasons', 'Bertolucci', 'career', 'was', 'wane', 'time', 'marvelous', 'filmmaker', 'been', 'erratic', 'whole', 'career', 'going', 'long', 'periods', 'making', 'films', 'making', 'uneven', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'came', 'time', 'when', 'Bertolucci', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'respected', 'critics', 'large', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'Luna', 'Tragedy', 'Ridiculous', 'Man', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'especially', 'latter', 'Somehow', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'fabulous', 'producer', 'managed', 'scrap', 'together', 'funds', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'Bertolucci', 'had', 'returned', 'top', 'form', 'making', 'arguably', 'best', 'film', 'film', 'paper', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'had', 'known', 'stars', 'directed', 'filmmaker', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'blockbusters', 'little', 'known', 'Chinese', 'emperor', 'little', 'known', 'West', 'anyway', 'long', 'film', 'long', 'costly', 'shoot', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'epic', 'films', 'rare', 'film', 'where', 'everything', 'work.The', 'film', 'also', 'remarkable', 'one', 'few', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'not', 'only', 'wins', 'real', 'work', 'art', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'known', 'go', 'films', 'dubious', 'questionable', 'quality', 'films', 'are', 'safe', 'non-controversial', 'remember', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'vs', 'Crash', 'controversy', 'Very', 'rarely', 'artistic', 'work', 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'much', 'less', 'win', 'category', 'nominated', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'easy', 'digest', 'Best', 'Picture', 'demanding', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'use', 'portion', 'eyes', 'adore', 'so', 'immensely', 'challenging', 'visually', 'thematically', 'Perhaps', 'Academy', 'was', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'beauty', 'majesty', 'film', 'felt', 'compelled', 'give', 'awards', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved.The', 'Criterion', 'version', 'film', 'complete', 'justice', 'get', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'get', 'original', '164', 'minute', 'theatrical', 'version', '218', 'minute', 'TV', 'version', 'Bertolucci', 'said', 'director', 'cut', 'film', '164', 'minute', 'version', 'not', 'longer', 'version', 'was', 'always', 'impression', '218', 'minute', 'cut', 'was', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Bertolucci', 'was', 'contract', 'deliver', 'longer', 'version', 'Chinese', 'television', 'what', 'longer', 'version', 'not', 'director', 'cut', 'Many', 'assumed', 'including', '5', '1/4', 'hour', 'version', '1900', 'was', 'director', 'cut', 'available', 'DVD', 'now', 'television', 'version', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'not.As', 'controversy', 'new', 'framing', ""n't"", 'like', 'Bertolucci', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'approve', 'transfer', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'know', 'Bernardo', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'film', 'be', 'squeezed', 'butchered', 'cinematographer', 'Vittorio', 'Storario', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'When', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'shown', '2:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'believe', 'transfer', '164', 'minute', 'version', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'early', 'Artisan', 'DVD', 'abomination', 'Colors', 'textures', 'are', 'butchered', 'insulting', 'considering', 'how', 'beautiful', 'film', 'accept', 'proper', 'framing', 'When', 'Berlin', 'Alexanderplatz', 'was', 'restored', 'was', 'overseen', 'Xaver', 'Schwarzenberger', 'original', 'cinemtographer', 'Many', 'were', 'angry', 'Xaver', 'tinkering', 'Fassbinder', 'film', 'Xaver', 'knew', 'material', 'better', 'anyone', 'maybe', 'Fassbinder', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'had', 'credibility', 'transfer', 'discernible', 'reason', 'why', 'cinemtographer', 'would', 'butcher', 'own', 'work', 'Xaver', 'Vittorio.This', 'set', 'many', 'many', 'extras', 'almost', 'as', 'expansive', 'film', '90', 'page', 'booklet', 'interviews', 'essays', 'articles', 'film', 'production', 'Chinese', 'history', 'set', 'film', 'are', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'serious', 'cinema', 'person', 'there', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'must', 'film', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'films', 'so', 'ravishing', 'enthralling', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing']",N/A

Shkodra,"[2, 2]","...a prison within a prison...an emperor imprisoned within the walls of a puppet state only to serve the interests of those who made him an emperor...and when Pu Yi is out of the chinese prison after having served a ten year correction sentence, he sees his former prison warden forced to march in a humiliating parade of denunciation organized by young chinese cultural revolutionaries who are as much under the spell of an illusion as the former emperor was before: the vicious circle is complete - the entire world is a prison, and there's enough room for you too, just wait for your turn: this seems to be one of the main ideas of this epic movie.Bertoluci's ""The last emperor"" is a magnificient film of epic proportions. While I was watching this truly beautiful work many years ago I couldn't help thinking about what made this film both a commercial and critical success comparing to his former work ""Novecento"", a more commercial than critical fiasco, and thinking what went wrong with his previous work. Maybe with the emperor Bertoluci had much less ambitions as far as the interpretation of the history of a country and of its politics is concerned, or maybe he didn't set the standarts as high as he did before the release of ""Novecento"", or maybe because here he doesn't venture onto political or poor class preachifying.I don't know whether one can consider ""The last emperor"" to be a typical Bernardo Bertoluci movie or not. You certainly find his typical storytelling, the famous Bertoluci intimacy and closeups. But you also find some strange, bizarre acts, typical of Bertoluci's movies characters, like the servants checking the little emperor's excrements, the emperor hurling his pet mouse at the doors which keep him imprisoned, the emperess eating orchid blooms at a state reception, the eunuchs carrying their testicles in phials out into the courtyard. Having said that, I think the great Bernardo should consider himself very lucky to have worked in this and numerous other films with Vittorio Storaro, one of the best in his domain - remember some truly great scenes, like the beggars outside the Forbidden City's gates, the chanting monks, the city's interiors almost impenetrable in darkness, the crimson blossom of blood in the water filled sink where Pu Yi cuts his wrists in an attempt to put an end to his life, the almost puritanical whites of the communist prison, and many, many other beautiful scenes.All in all a great movie, maybe too bloodless to be an epic work, but surely beautiful enough to be called a masterpiece.",4,The Forbidden City - a theatre without an audience...,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,2559,"['prison', 'prison', 'emperor', 'imprisoned', 'walls', 'puppet', 'state', 'only', 'serve', 'interests', 'who', 'made', 'emperor', 'when', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'chinese', 'prison', 'having', 'served', 'ten', 'year', 'correction', 'sentence', 'former', 'prison', 'warden', 'forced', 'march', 'humiliating', 'parade', 'denunciation', 'organized', 'young', 'chinese', 'cultural', 'revolutionaries', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'spell', 'illusion', 'former', 'emperor', 'was', 'vicious', 'circle', 'complete', 'entire', 'world', 'prison', 'enough', 'room', 'too', 'just', 'wait', 'turn', 'be', 'one', 'main', 'ideas', 'epic', 'movie.Bertoluci', 'last', 'emperor', 'magnificient', 'film', 'epic', 'proportions', 'was', 'watching', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'work', 'many', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'comparing', 'former', 'work', 'Novecento', 'more', 'commercial', 'critical', 'fiasco', 'thinking', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'previous', 'work', 'Maybe', 'emperor', 'Bertoluci', 'had', 'much', 'less', 'ambitions', 'as', 'far', 'interpretation', 'history', 'country', 'politics', 'concerned', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'standarts', 'as', 'high', 'did', 'release', 'Novecento', 'maybe', 'here', ""n't"", 'venture', 'onto', 'political', 'poor', 'class', 'preachifying.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'can', 'consider', 'last', 'emperor', 'be', 'typical', 'Bernardo', 'Bertoluci', 'movie', 'not', 'certainly', 'find', 'typical', 'storytelling', 'famous', 'Bertoluci', 'intimacy', 'closeups', 'also', 'find', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'acts', 'typical', 'Bertoluci', 'movies', 'characters', 'servants', 'checking', 'little', 'emperor', 'excrements', 'emperor', 'hurling', 'pet', 'mouse', 'doors', 'keep', 'imprisoned', 'emperess', 'eating', 'orchid', 'blooms', 'state', 'reception', 'eunuchs', 'carrying', 'testicles', 'phials', 'out', 'courtyard', 'Having', 'said', 'think', 'great', 'Bernardo', 'should', 'consider', 'very', 'lucky', 'have', 'worked', 'numerous', 'other', 'films', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'one', 'best', 'domain', 'remember', 'truly', 'great', 'scenes', 'beggars', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'gates', 'chanting', 'monks', 'city', 'interiors', 'almost', 'impenetrable', 'darkness', 'crimson', 'blossom', 'blood', 'water', 'filled', 'sink', 'where', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'wrists', 'attempt', 'put', 'end', 'life', 'almost', 'puritanical', 'whites', 'communist', 'prison', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'beautiful', 'scenes.All', 'great', 'movie', 'maybe', 'too', 'bloodless', 'be', 'epic', 'work', 'surely', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'masterpiece']",N/A

When it was released on DVD I dumped the VHS and bought the DVD format, then there was a second version of the movie and here comes the sad part. It was the original director's cut of 218 minutes (read 3 hours and 38 minutes). Dump the short version and buy the complete movie. Never regretted it. And what do I see now? The Last Emperor on Blu-ray? Far out! But there's a catch. Despite the bunch of documentaries, bonus material and interviews and so on, and so on, The Criterion Collection's edition on Blu-ray offers us a 164 minutes version of the movie. That's almost an hour less than the Artisan DVD edition I own. I don't get it. If Blu-ray offers us high definition quality and 8 hours of time, why not have the whole movie on Blu-ray DVD? There's plenty of room for whatever else they want to put in. I don't know if director Bertolucci agreed or not on that, but whoever decided to mutilate and desecrate the movie in this edition is a shame and tasteless ignorant (unless it is a mistake in printing the running time information). That's why I rate it only 3 stars. If you ask me for the movie itself, it is a 5 star 2 thumbs up movie not only for the director's superb work, but also for the cast, costumes, photography, locations, script, everything.

To look at the history of this country in the first seven decades of the 20th century through the exclusive eyes of the last emperor who lived locked up in the Forbidden City all his life till he was freed by the Japanese and marched to Manchuria to become the last emperor there is kind of debilitating and disappointing. Then he was captured by Mao Zedong's troops and was re-educated in some kind of rehabilitation camp and finished his life as a gardener. At the end of his life he saw the mounting pressure coming from the Red Guards and announcing the Cultural Revolution. The vision is both sorry and disappointed in a way. But does this film present a picture of this man, or of China, or of the world that is worth remembering? He is too capricious to be in anyway great or even remembered. He lost all his power when Sun Yat Sen arrived and yet he survived as some kind of a symbol that the Japanese used. He accepted to sell himself to the Japanese as this symbol precisely.

It tells of Pu Y, who became China's last emperor during the early part of the 20th century.  He lived  in the Forbidden City, unknowlegable of the world and even the country  around him.  As a very young child and through his teens he had everything  done for him, but then is pitched away when the country becomes involved in  war.  Not aware of life it becomes an uphill task to accustom himself.  The  story is incredible and actually excellent material for a mini-series. And,  unlike a lot of mini-series would not be boring or stretched beyond  interest.  There is a lot of material here.  But rather than rely on that  material, director Bernardo Bertolucci elects to ignore the foundation and  depend instead on never letting the audience forget the size of the tale.  We are as an audience, therefore, put off everytime the story moves to a  new plateau.  We are forced to ask questions that are not answered because  he attempts to cram too much spectacle into a three-hour movie.Technically,  the film is superior.  Its costumes, art direction and editing are  incomparable.  The music score co-written by David Byrne (formerly of the  rock band, Talking Heads) is also superb.  But it's the cinematography that  is really the thing here.  If it wasn't for that, the few bare threads of  the original story that do come through would have been non-existant,  leaving the film as shallow as they come.But the characters are the thing  here and they become mere backdrops for Bertolucci's overblown  self-awareness.  It's not that Pu Y comes across cold and distant as some  critics have remarked.  And it's certainly not John Lone's very brave  performance of said character that creates problems.  It is simply the  overall flatness of the characters.  They have no dimension.  Whether its  the otherwise excellent editing or the director-penned screenplay (more  likely) the film is, for this critic, GREATLY lacking in depth.There is a  &quot;director's cut&quot; available on DVD.  But the hopes for  improvements have been greatly diminished by the opinion of some of the  reviews that have been written.So, in short, if you want to see how  cinematography and other technical qualities can save a movie, see this  film.

But the real story is about China, and its turmoil through the wars and revolutions of the 20th century.The film's richness and beauty are almost daunting, but it's certainly a film which anyone interested in the art of cinema will want to see. The Criterion standard DVD special edition, on which this review is based, includes two versions of the film, the original theatrical release and the director's special television release.

244345,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,6301055845,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","I can understand someone loving ""The Last Emperor"" (as I do), or beingbored stiff. Visually ravishing, it is an epic film about an empty man,the last emperor of China Pu Yi.Raised from birth with no real experience of the outside world, trainedonly to fulfill his role as a symbolic figurehead, we watch Pu Yi sweptalong by the great tides of history in the 20th century east. Onlyafter going through ten years 're-education' at the hands of theChinese communists does he start to seem connected to the world and tohimself.The film forces a lot of challenging 're-thinking'. While clearly notforgiving the murderous excesses of the Chinese cultural revolution inthe 60s, it does show that ' at least in this specific case ' theharshness of the Chinese communists was better for Pu Yi as a humanbeing than the false kindness of all those that surrounded him for muchof his life.There are weak spots. Peter O'Toole - who I usually love - is at hismost self-consciously theatrical as Pu Yi's western tutor, a tone thatmakes it feel like he's in a different film. Some scenes feel like pureexposition, with characters having conversations only so we theaudience understands historical context. And it's sometimes hard tostay fully connected to a 165 minute epic about an empty man (although'Citizen Kane' could be looked at that way).But in the end, when Pu Yi finds some measure of happiness andwholeness as a simple gardener, there is a fascinating feeling of deepemotional reward for much of what felt flat earlier.Note: The Italian TV cut is almost a full hour longer than the featureversion (which Bertolucci is now said to prefer), I find each havedifferent strengths. I agree that the longer version is a bit ""moreboring"" to quote the director himself, but it also fills out the storyin important ways. By giving us more information about Pu Yi'schildhood, and time in prison (even if some of those scenes do feel abit clunky with exposition) his character feels much more fleshed out,less of a cipher. More a man, less a symbol. And some of the importantchanges both in the story and in his personality feel less sudden orconfusing. Probably my personal 'perfect' version would split thedifference, but I was very glad to see this alternate cut.",5,"Like Bertolucci's earlier ""1900"", a film full of great achievement and some real flaws",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,2249,"['can', 'understand', 'someone', 'loving', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'do', 'beingbored', 'stiff', 'Visually', 'ravishing', 'epic', 'film', 'empty', 'man', 'last', 'emperor', 'China', 'Pu', 'Yi.Raised', 'birth', 'real', 'experience', 'outside', 'world', 'trainedonly', 'fulfill', 'role', 'symbolic', 'figurehead', 'watch', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'sweptalong', 'great', 'tides', 'history', '20th', 'century', 'east', 'Onlyafter', 'going', 'ten', 'years', 'hands', 'theChinese', 'communists', 'start', 'seem', 'connected', 'world', 'tohimself.The', 'film', 'lot', 'challenging', ""'re-thinking"", 'clearly', 'notforgiving', 'murderous', 'excesses', 'Chinese', 'cultural', 'revolution', 'inthe', '60s', 'show', 'least', 'specific', 'case', 'theharshness', 'Chinese', 'communists', 'was', 'better', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'humanbeing', 'false', 'kindness', 'surrounded', 'muchof', 'are', 'weak', 'spots', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'usually', 'love', 'hismost', 'self-consciously', 'theatrical', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'western', 'tutor', 'tone', 'feel', 'different', 'film', 'scenes', 'feel', 'pureexposition', 'characters', 'having', 'conversations', 'only', 'theaudience', 'understands', 'historical', 'context', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'tostay', 'fully', 'connected', '165', 'minute', 'epic', 'empty', 'man', ""although'Citizen"", 'Kane', 'could', 'be', 'looked', 'way', '.But', 'end', 'when', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'measure', 'happiness', 'andwholeness', 'simple', 'gardener', 'fascinating', 'feeling', 'deepemotional', 'reward', 'much', 'what', 'felt', 'flat', 'earlier.Note', 'Italian', 'TV', 'cut', 'almost', 'full', 'hour', 'longer', 'featureversion', 'Bertolucci', 'now', 'said', 'prefer', 'find', 'havedifferent', 'strengths', 'agree', 'longer', 'version', 'bit', 'moreboring', 'quote', 'director', 'also', 'out', 'storyin', 'important', 'ways', 'giving', 'more', 'information', 'Pu', ""Yi'schildhood"", 'time', 'prison', 'even', 'scenes', 'do', 'feel', 'abit', 'clunky', 'exposition', 'character', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'less', 'cipher', 'More', 'man', 'less', 'symbol', 'importantchanges', 'story', 'personality', 'feel', 'sudden', 'orconfusing', 'Probably', 'personal', ""'perfect"", 'version', 'would', 'split', 'thedifference', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'alternate', 'cut']",N/A

Bernardo Bertolucci is known for such cinematic extravaganzas as 1973's LAST TANGO IN PARIS and 1977's 1900; and to add to his credits, 1987's Best Picture winner THE LAST EMPEROR!A film of major diversity. An Italian director (Bertolucci), a predominately Chinese cast including frequent costars John Lone and Joan Chen, British actor and seven-time Oscar nominee Peter O'Toole, an American producer named Jeremy Thomas, and distributed by an American studio, Columbia Pictures!John Lone is the title character, Chinese emperor &quot;Henry&quot; Pu-Yi, who became the last Emperor of China at the age of 3, and would be the &quot;Lord of Ten Thousand Years!&quot; Nothing would prepare him for the change that would eventually occur when he is forced into abdication, forced into retaking his kingdom, and forcing him to attempt suicide after his arrest and capture by Chinese and Russian communist troops after World War II. Eventually, after serving his time for conspiracy, he released from prison and lives out the rest of his life in 1967 -- as a simple gardner.Imagine. From Emperor to gardner, totally heartbreaking! Heartbreaking is the fact that it cost him EVERYTHING! His wife &quot;Elizabeth&quot; Wan Jung, played with grace by the gorgeous Joan Chen; his kingdom and his freedom. But, you can't simply hate the guy! He is, of course, a man who was spoiled by his servants and soldiers as a child.The film has both an epic scope and an excellently-written character story. (Though most historians believed that the film embellished on certain facts, like Pu-Yi's homosexuality.) It is played competently by an Asian cast and a wonderfully witty Peter O'Toole, who should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor that year, as the Emperor's patient tutor Reginald &quot;R.J.&quot; Johnston.Needless to say, I cried at the very end of this film! I LOVED that scene between the elder Pu-Yi and a little boy who appears to be just like the Emperor as a child. And the symbolic message this film taught with the cricket in the jar, as the little boy opens the jar to reveal the insect (by then, Pu-Yi has magically disappeared). An epic film with a heart (like my PRISONER OF WAR)!Winner of all 9 of its nominations including: Best Picture - Jeremy Thomas, producer; Best Director - Bernardo Bertolucci; Best Adapted Screenplay - Bertolucci and Mark Peploe; Best Cinematography; Best Art Direction/Set Decoration; Best Costume Design; Best Score; Best Sound; and Best Film Editing.THIS FILM IS APPROXIMATELY: 2 HOURS AND 40 MINUTES.But well worth it!",5,Bertolucci's Last Epic!,988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,2599,"['mean', 'great', 'respect', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'known', 'such', 'cinematic', 'extravaganzas', '1973', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'PARIS', '1977', '1900', 'add', 'credits', '1987', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'A', 'film', 'major', 'diversity', 'Italian', 'director', 'Bertolucci', 'predominately', 'Chinese', 'cast', 'including', 'frequent', 'costars', 'John', 'Lone', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'British', 'actor', 'seven-time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'American', 'producer', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'distributed', 'American', 'studio', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'John', 'Lone', 'title', 'character', 'Chinese', 'emperor', 'quot', 'Henry', 'quot', 'Pu-Yi', 'who', 'became', 'last', 'Emperor', 'China', 'age', '3', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Ten', 'Thousand', 'Years', 'quot', 'Nothing', 'would', 'prepare', 'change', 'would', 'eventually', 'occur', 'when', 'forced', 'abdication', 'forced', 'retaking', 'kingdom', 'forcing', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'arrest', 'capture', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'communist', 'troops', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Eventually', 'serving', 'time', 'conspiracy', 'released', 'prison', 'out', 'rest', 'life', '1967', 'simple', 'gardner.Imagine', 'Emperor', 'gardner', 'totally', 'heartbreaking', 'Heartbreaking', 'fact', 'cost', 'EVERYTHING', 'wife', 'quot', 'Elizabeth', 'quot', 'Wan', 'Jung', 'played', 'grace', 'gorgeous', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'kingdom', 'freedom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'hate', 'guy', 'course', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'spoiled', 'servants', 'soldiers', 'child.The', 'film', 'epic', 'scope', 'excellently-written', 'character', 'story', 'most', 'historians', 'believed', 'film', 'embellished', 'certain', 'facts', 'Pu-Yi', 'homosexuality', 'played', 'competently', 'Asian', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'witty', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'year', 'Emperor', 'patient', 'tutor', 'Reginald', 'quot', 'R.J.', 'quot', 'Johnston.Needless', 'say', 'cried', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'LOVED', 'scene', 'elder', 'Pu-Yi', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'just', 'Emperor', 'child', 'symbolic', 'message', 'film', 'taught', 'cricket', 'jar', 'little', 'boy', 'jar', 'reveal', 'insect', 'then', 'Pu-Yi', 'magically', 'disappeared', 'epic', 'film', 'heart', 'PRISONER', 'OF', 'WAR', 'Winner', '9', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'producer', 'Best', 'Director', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Bertolucci', 'Mark', 'Peploe', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction/Set', 'Decoration', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Best', 'Score', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Best', 'Film', 'Editing.THIS', 'FILM', 'IS', 'APPROXIMATELY', '2', 'HOURS', '40', 'MINUTES.But', 'well']",N/A

The digital artifacts and shimmering are so bad that it's nearly  impossible to enjoy the film.  I have yet to see the director's cut of this  movie because I had to stop watching.

244359,A3EULZNXT15RWX,6301055845,M. Olic,"[5, 15]","Bertolucci said in one of his interviews located on disc 4 that watching a movie is personal experience and that everyone is entitled to his own opinion. I'll take his word on this and write my own review of his movie.This movie was ordered by Chinese communist government to promote their propaganda of lies and distort truth. They even hired a communist director Bertolucci to make it really big. In the end this movie won many Oscars but historic events later made this movie obsolete and completely forgotten. Although Pu Yi is officially the last emperor of China, Mao Tse-tung was the last one in reality.You are all familiar with Chinese state propaganda and their calls for state integrity and unification. Movie is basically about treason of last emperor and his collaboration with Japanese invaders. Pu Yi is presented as a puppet manipulated by foreign powers that betrayed Chinese people and caused death and destruction to his homeland. This is a fact but taken out of context.All Chinese warlords including Mao and his communists had foreign sponsors whether they were Americans, Russians, Japanese, British or someone else. You either have your sponsor or you are out of the game. If Pu Yi was traitor serving Japanese wasn't then Mao also a traitor by importing foreign ideology developed by Karl Marx and getting sponsored by Stalin and USSR? Was communism popular in China at all or thanks to Stalin and Russian tanks Mao forced communism on Chinese people? If Pu Yi was responsible for crimes against humanity in Manchuria wasn't Mao responsible for big famine in late '50s when more than 30 million people perished? Mao also introduced his own version of Stalin gulags and built laogais to enslave people and force them to work for free.Bertolucci frequently mentions his favorite scene with little Pu Yi and a cricket symbolizing his transformation from an emperor to the gardener. This is supposed to be good thing but if you watch the movie you will see that this transformation was forceful in order to humiliate Pu Yi and show to the people that only Mao is their true leader. Maos's government is presented as mercifull one that spared Pu Yi's life and instead reeducated him. In the end of the movie we see full glory of Mao's Cultural Revolution where Pu Yi's dungeon master was accused of treason by mindless hordes of young people fully brainwashed by Mao's red booklets. Accordions start playing, red flag is waved. This somewhat whitewashes Chinese government and distance their party leaders from Mao. After that scene Pu Yi ends in his former home palace. Young boy wearing hat with red star stops him from sitting on the throne. Pu Yi explains that he is the former emperor and shows him a cricket. This scene is important because it shows that post-Mao Chinese government needs to change but this scene also remains a conflict between director Bertolucci and Chinese government. While Bertolucci meant that China should be more open to the West and become democratic, Chinese government seem to be content that changes after Mao's death and his cult of personality are adequate and no new changes are needed. Movie was made in 1987, two years before Tiananmen massacre when all illusions about democratic China were shattered. Since then, Bertolucci's career wend like downward spiral and his beloved Italian communist party is kicked out of parliament for good. China has transformed herself but not into democratic and free society but into that old fascist warlords China from the beginning of the 20th century. Money keeps pouring in and out of China by foreigners while corruption and crime rate soar.Although Pu Yi is officially the last emperor of China, Mao Tse-tung was the last one in reality. Mao had his own transformation, from assistant librarian to communist dictator. He was called Great Leader Chairman Mao and lived in a compound near Forbidden City. After his death he was embalmed and buried in Mao Mausoleum like an Egyptian Pharaoh.It is sad how all ended up making this movie obsolete and forgotten. Many will rate this movie with 5 stars but I had to deduct 2 of them for following reasons. This is propaganda movie twisting historic facts, picture and audio quality are poor for Criterion Collection. Longer version is definitely much better but it is TV quality not movie theater like with wrong aspect ratio. Theatrical version looks better but not by much. Just compare this Criterion edition of Last Emperor with ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" shot 20 years before by another Italian director Sergio Leone. Both versions are labeled as restored so there are no excuses for poor quality of Last Emperor. All these complaints do not mean that you shouldn't buy this edition. Full length edition with beautiful scenery of Forbidden City and fantastic music by Ryuichi Sakamoto are great reasons to own it while you can. Most Hollywood movies are good on eyes only while story telling is mindless and moronic. That doesn't mean they sell poorly or that you shouldn't buy them.It is interesting that movie was released by Columbia Pictures but mostly financed independently. At that time Coca Cola Co. was the owner while in 1989 Sony bought it. Another interesting fact is that Ryuichi Sakamoto responsible for music in the movie also plays movie character Amakasu, member of Japanese military police monitoring Pu Yi and often telling him what to do. His cover was the head of Manchukuo Film Association producing mostly Japanese war propaganda movies.",3,Communist propaganda,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,5514,"['Bertolucci', 'said', 'one',

Taken from his mother at the age of three and raised to believe in his own divinity as absolute monarch, Pu Yi?s marriage to Wan Jung (Joan Chen) is marred by her opium addiction and the tragic death of their only child and heir to the throne. Peter O?Toole appears as Reginald Johnston, English tutor to his majesty in the ways of diplomacy and the outside world. The film presents China?s Forbidden City as allegory for the pampered but caged existence of wealth and the destructive nature of absolute power. Eventually forced to flee his gated paradise, Pu Yi succumbs to the decadence of becoming a playboy, a stooge of the Japanese, and a victim of China's cultural reforms and re-education programs.The film is a poignant, heart-breaking, tragic and sweeping saga that won, among its other award, the Oscar for best cinematography. But you'd ever guess it by looking at this DVD transfer. The 2:35:1 image has not been anamorphically enhanced and exhibits just about every digital anomaly that one can find on a poorly mastered DVD. There's edge enhancement, aliasing, fine detail shimmering, color smearing, tiling, color distortion, loss of fine details, extremely low contrast levels, disturbing halos and fading of the film?s negative. There are chips, scratches, tears and camera negative jitter. The audio is a rather dismal 2.0 mix. After viewing this travesty it is my sincere hope that whoever was responsible for mastering this DVD will never get the opportunity to be near such equipment again. There are no extras and no reason why anyone should invest in this DVD.BOTTOM LINE: JUST DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!  There's nothing to recommend the print used or the mastering employed to bring it to the small screen. If there was room to rate this disc as 'zero' stars I would have done just that.

Besides, the sound is far better on the Optimum copy than on Criterion.Despite being filled with extras, the Criterion copy sports a sound mix that is filled with effects, while the Optimum copy has them in a much more discreet way.This over-emphatization of sound effects, results in some dialogues being lost to the dogs.No. I usually admire and revere the work that the guys at Criterion do, especially when it comes to Japanese movies such as those of Akira Kurosawa (in those they have surpassed themselves).But here, nah, not worth the effort and the money (despite of all the extras).Maybe in a future, when those involved in this chopping will be gone, we might stand a better chance at having the full movie as it was actually presented and restored the way Criterion knows.Until then and if you have the chance to have a Region/Code Free DVD player, stick to the British copy. It is far, far superior.But in the end it is up to you. Do you care more about the Bonuses and Extras offered, rather than the movie itself?Then stick to the Criterion copy (it is stuffed with tons of material).But if you, like me, are more focused on the movie and don't give a hoot about the wrappings, the candles and the cherries, than try to get hold of an Optimum DVD of this movie (you may still find it at Amazon.co.uk).",3,"No, no, no.

244372,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6301055845,P Magnum,"[5, 7]","1987's The Last Emperor is the vast and sprawling epic about the life of Pu Yi, who was the last emperor in China.  Pu Yi ascended to power at the age of three and is taken to be raised behind the walls of the Forbidden City.  He is tutored by an Englishman, Reginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole), who is respectful yet not afraid to admonish the boy emperor and they develop a bond. Pu Yi also develops a bizarre attachment to his wet nurse.  Pu Yi is nothing more than a symbol and figurehead and he is the last vestige of the old way of life in China.  Outside the walls of his city, China is changing and he eventually becomes a victim of the cultural changes and reforms that occurred in the first part of the 20th century.  John Lone portrays Pu Yi as an adult and Joan Chen is Wang Jung, who is his arranged wife, but they grow to truly love one another.  Both actors are very good in their respective roles.  The film was long upon in its initial release, coming in at just under three hours, but this new director's cut adds almost another hour of additional footage.  Bernardo Bertolucci is the film's director and he crafted a magnificent looking film, with expansive sets and ornate sets, but the film is slowly paced and the additional hour only makes it much more tedious.  It is a good film, but not one that deserves the nine Oscars it took home in 1987.

However, for some reason I tried again the next night.  Fortunately that's when Peter O'Toole entered and things perked up considerably.  After that I was hooked and sat still without squirming or snacking for the remainder...almost three hours.Visually, the film is amazing, as you can expect from Bertolucci.  The shots inside the Forbidden City alone, make the it worth watching.  As time passes the costumes and decors are equally interesting.The actors are perfect.  John Lone is terrific.  He is so handsome and sympathetic that he makes you care deeply about a man, who probably wasn't really that nice.  Joan Chen as the beautiful Empress is a perfect match. Peter O'Toole is always a delight to watch. The supporting actors are all wonderful, especially the man who played the Governor of the prison.I found the comments of many of the readers instructive and interesting.  My knowledge of this period of history is negligible so I am open to suggestions... It seems, from what several people have written that Bertolucci, a member of the Communist party, softsoaped the treatment that the prisoners endured, which casts grave doubts on the accuracy of the story.  Several others have commented that the Emperor was gay while another person wrote that he was married five times.  ???  So with the accuracy of the facts up in the air,  I decided to just take the film on its own terms and enjoy it...seeing it almost as a work of fiction, ""based on"" some true characters.  As such I can love it.  I prefer to see the Emperor as a basically good man, innocent and with good intentions, who was a victim of his situation. Again John Lone is such a lovely person that I found it hard to see him as anything less, although the real Emperor might truly have been a creep.The basic story is fascinating, and I, for one, to do not see it as tragic that he ended up as a gardener.  He seemed to be happier in his last days than he ever had been...arranging the plants and smiling at his co-workers.  He seemed to have found a state of peace and even joy that was truly lovely.  The closing scene in the palace is charming, although I found his sudden ""disappearance"" inappropriately strange.

244377,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301055845,Randy Keehn,"[10, 12]","I saw ""The Last Emperor"" a few years back and the movie has staid with me in many a positive way.  I was truly amazed at the quality of the sets, the costumes and and the color throughout the movie.  I had the feeling that we were seeing scenes shot in the Forbidden City itself.  The tale is one that deserved telling because it gives us the story of China in the 20th Century.The prime focus of the story, obviously, is the last emporer of China, Pu Yi.  We are given ample time to see the Old China through the many facets of his seclusive life in a setting of grandeur.  Every aspect of every scene shown reinforces the imagery of a world of imperial power totally seperated from the hundreds of millions subjected to his rule.  When rebellion reached the gates, it was time to take the best offer and leave.  However, a grandiose lifestyle dating back to one's earliest memory is not replaced by a modest town house.  We watched the dethroned emporer drift into an aimless life of spoiled affluence.  During the Japanese invasion, the conquering army installs Pu Yi as a sort of puppet emporer to give a semblance of authority to their control.  Ultimately, Pu Yi falls victim to the Communist regiem that fells no need to treat the fallen emporer any different form any othe Chinese individual in need of re-education.  In a sense, Pu Yi comes to represent everything wrong with the Old China and everything wrong with the New China.  All of this takes place with occassional shifts in time between past and present.The question arises as to what category this movie fits into; an historical drama or a morality play on how the mighty have fallen.  In a way it is a combination of both.  The visual experience of history in ""The Last Emporer"" is often breath-taking and the contemplation of the life of Pu Yi impacts us in a similar manner.  Yet we may come away asking ourselves just what is the message of this nearly three-hour movie.  I, for one, was not able to immediately answer that question.  However, it seems that everything I have read or viewed about 20th Century China since has brought me back to ""The Last Emporer"".

Unfortunately, this film was not presented as Bertolucci intended. The DVD fills in the holes, and is actually a valid history lesson. It's worth your attention.  I still don't understand it's Oscar for Editing; the &quot;fight&quot; scene in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; is still used in film schools as a masterpiece of editing, and it should've won, at least in that category. I have a new respect for the film, and, as epics go, it's among the best. Bertolucci is best known for close-ups and intimacy; he was certainly in touch with his material. The extended version is the one to see, but be sure you have a lot of time, with no distractions. You'll find it quite compelling. I do have some problems with other Oscars it won: Best Sound (do you remember the thunderstorm in &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;?); Best Cinematography (remember the vast panoramas in &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;?); Best Music (Morricone's intense score in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;).

Svendsen,"[206, 218]","When I was informed that the Blu-ray of the deluxe 4 disc Criterion edition would be missing the extended cut of 218 minutes, I sent an e-mail to Criterion to confirm this information.  I have included my e-mail and the response I received from Jon Mulvany at Criterion.  I hope this helps in your decision if you are planning to upgrade to the Blu-ray.Dear Jon,I have long been a fan of your company and the fine treatment it gives to movies.  I originally purchased one of my all time favorite movies, The Last Emperor earlier this year when it was given the deluxe 4 disc treatment, I was thrilled with all of the extras that were included.  I was most impressed that both versions of the movie were included for me to chose from.  When it was announced that it was coming to Blu-ray, I sold my copy and was waiting to upgrade.  I was!  I have learned that the 165 min. version is the only one that will be included on the Blu-ray and not the 218 min (my preferred version) cut.  WHY, WHY WHY?  I am sad to say, that if this is indeed really true, I will not be upgrading to the Blu-ray version since this would in fact be considered a step down from the standard DVD edition.  Why give us a great product initially, but then short change us on the Blu-ray upgrade,  How sad!!!Michael RuizJon's reply is as follows:Hi Michael,When we made the special edition dvd of The Last Emperor, we pulled out the stops. The film won nine Academy Awards - from best picture and director to production design and editing.  On top of that, it was the first international film of this scale produced in China, and that story in and of itself was extraordinary. In short, all aspects of the film merited attention and discussion. In addition to the director's cut of the film -- the original theatrical version -- we gave an entire disc to the longer Italian television version of the film for comparison. We also included an elaborate bound book and slipcase to hold the four disc set. Although the set was expensive, at $59.95, it was as close to definitive as we could make it, and we felt it offered good value.When it came time to make the Blu-ray edition, we felt strongly that a single-disc edition containing all the added content of the four-disc version would offer our customers the best version of the film, the best value, and the best user experience. Having addressed the myth that the television version is the director's cut with our DVD box set, we didn't feel that including it as an extra Blu-ray disc was worth the added cost to the customer. Similarly, because the Blu-ray market place is still much smaller than the market for DVDs, the cost per copy of printing Blu-ray sized perfect-bound books would have driven the price of our edition up to a level we considered prohibitively expensive for consumers.We also know that many or our customers already own the current dvd set. For them we are offering an upgrade program that will allow them to have the director's preferred version of the film on Blu-ray, while keeping the rest of the original package. Just send in your disc 1 and we'll send you the blu-ray disc for a $20 (+ $5 shipping and handling) replacement fee.  If you are determined to have all the content of the DVD edition as well as the Blu-ray disc content, you could always go that route -- buy the DVD set and trade in disc 1 for a Blu-ray. In the end I think the cost would still be less than we would have had to charge to make an all Blu-ray version of our original edition.I hope this helps you understand our thinking. Thanks, as always, for your support of Criterion.Sincerely,Jon Mulvaney",4,Blu-ray edition is not a direct carry over from the deluxe 4 DVD edition,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3626,"['When', 'was', 'informed', 'Blu-ray', 'deluxe', '4', 'disc', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'extended', 'cut', '218', 'minutes', 'sent', 'e-mail', 'Criterion', 'confirm', 'information', 'have', 'included', 'e-mail', 'response', 'received', 'Jon', 'Mulvany', 'Criterion', 'hope', 'decision', 'are', 'planning', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray.Dear', 'Jon', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'company', 'fine', 'treatment', 'movies', 'originally', 'purchased', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'earlier', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'given', 'deluxe', '4', 'disc', 'treatment', 'was', 'thrilled', 'extras', 'were', 'included', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'versions', 'movie', 'were', 'included', 'chose', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'coming', 'Blu-ray', 'sold', 'copy', 'was', 'waiting', 'upgrade', 'was', 'have', 'learned', '165', 'min', 'version', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'not', '218', 'min', 'preferred', 'version', 'cut', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'indeed', 'really', 'true', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'upgrading', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'would', 'fact', 'be', 'considered', 'step', 'down', 'standard', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Why', 'give', 'great', 'product', 'initially', 'then', 'short', 'change', 'Blu-ray', 'upgrade', 'How', 'sad', 'Michael', 'RuizJon', 'reply', 'Hi', 'Michael', 'When', 'made', 'special', 'edition', 'dvd', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'film', 'won', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'picture', 'director', 'production', 'design', 'editing', 'top', 'was', 'first', 'international', 'film', 'scale', 'produced', 'China', 'story', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'short', 'aspects', 'film', 'merited', 'attention', 'discussion', 'addition', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'gave', 'entire', 'disc', 'longer', 'Italian', 'television', 'version', 'film', 'comparison', 'also', 'included', 'elaborate', 'bound', 'book', 'slipcase', 'hold', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'set', 'was', 'expensive', '59.95', 'was', 'as', 'close', 'definitive', 'could', 'make', 'felt', 'offered', 'good', 'value.When', 'came', 'time', 'make', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'felt', 'strongly', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'containing', 'added', 'content', 'four-disc', 'version', 'would', 'offer', 'customers', 'best', 'version', 'film', 'best', 'value', 'best', 'user', 'experience', 'Having', 'addressed', 'myth', 'television', 'version', 'director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'including', 'extra', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'was', 'worth', 'added', 'cost', 'customer', 'Similarly', 'Blu-ray', 'market', 'place', 'still', 'much', 'smaller', 'market', 'DVDs', 'cost', 'copy', 'printing', 'Blu-ray', 'sized', 'perfect-bound', 'books', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'price', 'edition', 'up', 'level', 'considered', 'prohibitively', 'expensive', 'consumers.We', 'also', 'know', 'many', 'customers', 'already', 'own', 'current', 'dvd', 'set', 'are', 'offering', 'upgrade', 'program', 'will', 'allow', 'have', 'director', 'preferred', 'version', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'keeping', 'rest', 'original', 'package', 'Just', 'send', 'disc', '1', ""'ll"", 'send', 'blu-ray', 'disc', '20', '+', '5', 'shipping', 'handling', 'replacement', 'fee', 'are', 'determined', 'have', 'content', 'DVD', 'edition', 'as', 'well', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'content', 'could', 'always', 'go', 'route', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'trade', 'disc', '1', 'Blu-ray', 'end', 'think', 'cost', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'charge', 'make', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'original', 'edition.I', 'hope', 'understand', 'thinking', 'Thanks', 'always', 'support', 'Criterion.Sincerely', 'Jon', 'Mulvaney']",N/A

I'm not a fan of long movies (especially if that means another ""Titanic""), but Bertolucci's visual compositions in conjunction with authentic period feel and some good acting made the film both bearable and enjoyable.  What's missing is an authentic sense of the tragic (how can such an unfortunate, shielded, quarantined victim of circumstance be convincingly shown to have a ""fatal flaw""?) and, more regrettably, a moving, memorable sense of the elegiac.  The material the director is working with would seem to allow multiple possibilities for conveying a profound sense of loss, of inexorable change occurring within the context of painful memories which nevertheless serve as consolations, filling the void produced by the tyranny of time and change.  But Bertolucci seems so averse to the melodramatic mode (essential to effective elegy) and attached to the notion of spectacle that the movie simply fails to connect as personally as it should.Although ""The Last Emperor"" took the Best Picture award, it was released during the same year as ""Empire of the Sun,"" arguably Spielberg's most complex, impressive cinematic achievement.  A movie set in Shanghai, it offers more insight into the Western and Japanese occupation of China than into the Chinese themselves.  Yet it resonates with life and energy, violence and destruction, death and loss--seen through the eyes of another Spielberg innocent--as Bertolucci's ""Important Great Film"" does not.  It's cinematic spectacle that goes beyond artful travelog or illustrated history, providing a perspective that is at once universal and intimately personal.

244390,A18IK6YI6T3RK2,6301055845,Shannon Deason,"[8, 10]","This is one of those great epic movies, it is exhaustively thorough, but mesmerizing.  What makes the movie so special is that it was filmed on location, the director got special access to the Forbidden City and later in the film to the actual mansion Pu Yi lived in at Changchun, when he was instaled as the puppet Emperor of Manchukuo.  The movie begins with the Emperor as a little spoiled boy, and the scenes are very mysterious and you get a rare glimpse into the daily richuals of the imperial court, it's fascinating, the scene when he goes to see the Dowenger Empress Cixi is amazing, she sort of floats out on her throne, with incense creating a mysterious fog, it's just great cinema.  I apperciated that the movie tells you Pu Yi's entire story, up to him as a middle age man, and it's shocking to see how he ended up.  This man was once considered a deity and to be reduced to what he was in the end was stunning.  It is interesting to note that Pu Yi's body was moved from its common grave in Beijing and moved in the mid 1990's to the Qing Tombs of his ancestors, so in the end he was given his due respect, he now lies with his fellow Emperors, given in death the respect he was rarely afforded in life.  Great movie, most deserving of all of its Academy Awards.  O'Toole is very good in this, his charcter is composite of serveral people, but he's essential to the narrative of the movie.",5,LAST EMPEROR,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,1404,"['one', 'great', 'epic', 'movies', 'exhaustively', 'thorough', 'mesmerizing', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'director', 'got', 'special', 'access', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'later', 'film', 'actual', 'mansion', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'lived', 'Changchun', 'when', 'was', 'instaled', 'puppet', 'Emperor', 'Manchukuo', 'movie', 'Emperor', 'little', 'spoiled', 'boy', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'mysterious', 'get', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'daily', 'richuals', 'imperial', 'court', 'fascinating', 'scene', 'when', 'see', 'Dowenger', 'Empress', 'Cixi', 'amazing', 'sort', 'floats', 'out', 'throne', 'incense', 'creating', 'mysterious', 'fog', 'just', 'great', 'cinema', 'apperciated', 'movie', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'entire', 'story', 'up', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'shocking', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'man', 'was', 'once', 'considered', 'deity', 'be', 'reduced', 'what', 'was', 'end', 'was', 'stunning', 'interesting', 'note', 'Pu', 'Yi', 'body', 'was', 'moved', 'common', 'grave', 'Beijing', 'moved', 'mid', '1990', 'Qing', 'Tombs', 'ancestors', 'so', 'end', 'was', 'given', 'due', 'respect', 'now', 'fellow', 'Emperors', 'given', 'death', 'respect', 'was', 'rarely', 'afforded', 'life', 'Great', 'movie', 'most', 'deserving', 'Academy', 'Awards', ""O'Toole"", 'very', 'good', 'charcter', 'composite', 'serveral', 'people', 'essential', 'narrative', 'movie']",N/A

244393,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301055845,Simon Davis,"[8, 11]","I believe that approaching such a monumental film as Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" to write a review is akin to attempting to climb Mt. Everest, so huge and overwhelming is the task. With that in mind it is best just to view the film from what appeals to you about such a painstackingly researched, elaborate production that was years in the making.With every screening of this masterpice of the 1980's I am inspired to travel to China again to enjoy all the rich history and culture that is so beautifully captured in this visually stunning and very emotional true story of Pu Yi the last emperor of China.Winner deservadly of 9 Acadmey Awards the film is by far the very best production that Bertolucci has undertaken and what a mammoth task that is indeed. The story follows the life of China's last tragic emperor from age 3 till his death in the 1960's. This period is not only a large period of time in any one person's life but it also includes some of the most important changes to occur in China's long history in its move from an ancient absolute monarchy to a modern day People's Republic with all the upheavals that that intails.The look of ""the Last Emperor"" is unsurpassed for a modern motion picture with its stunning recreation of the Chinese court within the Forbidden City. The use of the actual locations in Beiijing, the location photography,and  the attention to detail in costumning, ceremony and characterisation will leave you speechless and the great thing is that in almost all instances the production has stuck closely to historical fact (as much as is possible in any motion picture that has to tell a story in a certain amount of time) I admire ""the Last Emperor"" as a stunning piece of entertainment and as a fascinating history lesson and insight into a world now sadly vanished forever.Apart from the visuals which really are the crowning glory of this production it is the actors themselves who deserve special merit here. It would have been easy for all of them to be totally overwhelmed by the sheer weight of this production however they are as memorable as any other part of ""The Last Emperor"". The 3 actors who play Henri Pu Yi at various stages of his life are perfect and each in their turn, as the Emperor grows older bring great conviction to their parts. John Lone is simply wonderful in his playing of the adult Pu Yi who experiences so many horrific happenings in his sad life once he is no longer emperor. He is what I would call an instinctive actor and so much of his playing is done with his eyes or with a brief smile. His is a masterful capturing of a man essentially with no purpose or place in his own life . His scenes in there-education centre and in his later life as a humble gardener in the public gardens of Beiijing are very memorable and his is the main character to carry this immense story through its second half. Another stunning performance is delivered by the very beautiful and highly talented Joan Chen. She is an actress I know unfortunately very little about but some of the most memorable moments in ""The Last Emperor"" belong to her. In the course of the film she develops from a naive young bride especially chosen to be the wife of the emperor of China, through to a disillusioned and neglected Empress , to a puppet consort and veritable prisoner of the Japanese, to a tragic opium addict who has her child murdered and ends up insane. Chen's is a most stunning performance and her scenes where she warns Pu Yi that the Japanes are using them for their own  evil intentions are extremely powerful. Who can forget her scene at the reception in Manchuria were she begins eating the Orchid blooms out of a sense of hopeless situation she has found herself in ? This disturbing visual image  will stay in your mind for a long time. As a  winner of 9 Academy Awards I feel both Lone and Chen should have won for their playing of the last tortured consorts of Imperial China.The supporting roles are equally well cast with Peter O'Toole making a memorable if not entirely accurate  Reginald Johnston the last emperor's tutor and confidante. His subtle underplaying brings alive his sense of awe at the world he has found himself in , so different to anything he has ever experienced before in his native Scotland. Also memorable are Lisa Lu in the brief role of the infamous Empress Dowager who is responsible for selecting Pu Yi as emperor,the various actors portraying Pu Chieh the emperor's younger brother and Maggie Han who is stunning as Eastern Jewel, the traitor to Pu Yi's cause who is responsible for also ruining the Empresse's life  through an opium addiction. All these actors and those that make up the rest of this film add to the rich tapestry of characters that unfold throughout the films long running time. It is because of these well cast individuals that the films length seems to always fly by in half the time.Viewing ""The Last Emperor"" is a moving and very memorable experience. Even if you are not a history buff you will be guaranteed a great viewing experience filled with stunning visuals, a tragic but compulsively interesting story and a set of actors ideally cast. It remains even after all these years one of my absolute favourites and I never fail to enjoy some new aspect of this extraordinary work of art. You are guaranteed a memorable view of one nation's recent tragic history.

244395,AI0OAQ6E2O8VF,6301055845,"Ted ""Ted""","[6, 8]","This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Last Emperor, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, is biographical film about the last emperor of Imperial China, Aixin-Jueluo Puyi, better known as Puyi. The film covers his live from just beofore his coronation at age 3 to just before his death at the age of 67 The film is largely accurate but some material has been added for dramatic license. The film has been seen by Puyi's brother and others who knew him and they have assisted in the film's production.The film has an excellent score with music by David Byrne, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Cong Su. It includes traditional Chinese music along with neoclassical pieces. The main title theme is quite good and makes good use of the marimba and erhu despite it not being officially Chinese music.The film was also nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won each award it was nominated for.The DVD set is fully loaded with special features. This is a four disc set with two versions of the film on two discs and the special features on the other discs.Disc one contains the theatrical version of the film along with a trailer and optional audio commentary by Bertolucci, producer Jeremy Thomas, writer Mark Peploe, and one of the film's composers, Ryuichi Sakamoto.Disc two contains the extended television version of the film.Disc three contains ""The Italian Traveler: Bernardo Bertolucci"" a documentary about Bertolucci's travels and their influence on his films, films made by Bertolucci in China during the film's preproduction, ""The Chinese Adventure of Bernardo Bertolucci"" a retrospective on the film's production, a documentary of interviews with Storaro, editor Gabriella Cristiani, costume designer James Acheson, and art director Gianni Silvestri.Disc four contains a BBC documentary on the film's production, a 1989 interview with Bertolucci, an interview with David Byrne that includes some of his notes, and an interview with cultural historian, Ian Buruma who discusses early 20th Century China.Also included is a large booklet with a lot of extra material.The two drawbacks are that the special features include footage from Bertolucci's other films that some may find objectionable and that the film is not in its original aspect ratio which Criterion almost always does. This caused some criticism but it was done at the request of Bertolucci himself.The film recieved a PG-13 rating which was probably for violence, mild sexuality, and brief female nudity (breastfeeding).This is one of Criterion's largest releases for a single film and I recommend it highly.",5,"An excellent film, excellent release.

This would have some negligible reasoning if 16x9 televisions didn't exist, but as they are becoming prevalent, it is absolutely ridiculous and backward to issue this deluxe version in this aesthetically damaging release. And this isn't the first time Storaro did this to a film he lensed. It happened with the dvd iterations of ""Apocalpyse Now"" as well, to godawful results.If apologists wish to push this version off as the true vision of Bertolucci and Storaro, then let all original negatives be PHYSICALLY altered, excised to 2.00:1 - if this can be agreed to and performed, then integrity of presentation will be acheived. If this re-worked aspect ratio is what was truly intended, the apologists will have no argument against this procedure. If that extra visual information was not intended to be seen, it should therefore be permanently removed, correct?I really wanted to purchase this, and maybe I still will but for the supplements. I cannot however watch the film itself in this Criterion presentation. It's ironic that for the longest time, Criterion's badge of honor (at one time labeled as such on laserdisc jackets) was that films issued by them were always in the Original Aspect Ratio.

He is a decent man, but years living a certain way and only understanding things in the very specific terms that were given to him, he is confused by the outside world and all of the changes.This is a film that also does wonders on a high-def set just because of the extremely vibrant and beautiful use of colour that the director and cinematographer use throughout the entire movie, and the way that the colours change and lose their vibrancy just as the child does.Great film, great music, a must have for movie collectors.",5,Criterion Does it Again.,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1103,"['So', 'know', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'really', 'Mercedes', 'DVD', 'releases', 'one', 'different.With', 'versions', 'film', 'amazing', 'special', 'features', 'silky-smooth', 'DVD', 'trasfer', 'will', 'recommend', 'film', 'almost', 'anyone.For', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'movie', 'came', 'where', 'win', 'something', '9', 'Oscars', 'very', 'strange', 'considering', 'was', 'Italian', 'director', 'all-star', 'foreign', 'cast.It', 'story', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'China', 'fall', 'grace', 'political', 'human', 'standpoint', 'Communist', 'Revolution', 'decent', 'man', 'years', 'living', 'certain', 'way', 'only', 'understanding', 'things', 'very', 'specific', 'terms', 'were', 'given', 'confused', 'outside', 'world', 'changes.This', 'film', 'also', 'wonders', 'high-def', 'set', 'just', 'extremely', 'vibrant', 'beautiful', 'use', 'colour', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'use', 'entire', 'movie', 'way', 'colours', 'change', 'lose', 'vibrancy', 'just', 'child', 'does.Great', 'film', 'great', 'music', 'must', 'have', 'movie', 'collectors']",N/A
