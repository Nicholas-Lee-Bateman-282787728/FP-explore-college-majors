My mom and I laughed so hard at him and his antics and comments. It was wonerfully funny, and is definately worth owning. I did love season one more, but I still love this so much that I quote it frequently or now have inside jokes with my mom about some of Karl's thoughts. I would absolutely hate to spoil it, but I will say if you love season one, this is a must. The extras in this season are also a good reason to get the dvds.",5,Too funny for words,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,550,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'season', 'two', 'season', 'one', 'ending', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'came', 'back', 'do', 'one', 'mom', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'antics', 'comments', 'was', 'wonerfully', 'funny', 'definately', 'worth', 'owning', 'did', 'love', 'season', 'one', 'more', 'still', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'quote', 'frequently', 'now', 'have', 'inside', 'jokes', 'mom', 'Karl', 'thoughts', 'would', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'spoil', 'will', 'say', 'love', 'season', 'one', 'must', 'extras', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'reason', 'get', 'dvds']",Idiot Abroad: Series 2

Given Japan's modernity and wealth, it should be one of the best places for the host to visit but he didn't seem to find fun things to do.  He visited a cat cafe that looked claustrophobic and cheap, did some exercises with workers, visited a cheap looking dollar store, got beaten by a monk with a bamboo pole sitting in some kind of hut so it looked like he was some kind of POW in the Phillipines and opined after climbing Mount Fuji, ""Japan's done.""",4,the rotted fish menu item in Japan might be as big a hoax as the Great Wall according to the host,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,709,"['rotted', 'fish', 'ingestion', 'laugh', 'inducing', 'best', 'part', 'otherwise', 'surprisingly', 'boring', 'episode', 'remember', 'times', 'rotted', 'fish', 'was', 'mentioned', 'common', 'food', 'offered', 'Allied', 'prisoners', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'camps', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Given', 'Japan', 'modernity', 'wealth', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'places', 'host', 'visit', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'fun', 'things', 'do', 'visited', 'cat', 'cafe', 'looked', 'claustrophobic', 'cheap', 'did', 'exercises', 'workers', 'visited', 'cheap', 'looking', 'dollar', 'store', 'got', 'beaten', 'monk', 'bamboo', 'pole', 'sitting', 'kind', 'hut', 'looked', 'was', 'kind', 'POW', 'Phillipines', 'opined', 'climbing', 'Mount', 'Fuji', 'Japan', 'done']",Idiot Abroad: Series 2

The accomodations, food, and detours Mr. P endures are fun to watch because of his reluctant, child-like, grumpiness.
