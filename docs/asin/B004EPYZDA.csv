Cooper ""possum""","[0, 0]","A few months ago I watched this movie on HBO; I don't know why I did, as I knew absolutely nothing about finance, economics, or banks. But because this movie was so involving and exciting, and because I wanted to understand what the heck they were talking about, I started to read. I read Too Big to Fail. Then I read Sheila Bair's book, because I wondered why all the men in the movie were so intimidated by her. It's eleven books on the 2008 financial crisis later, and I'm still fascinated by cdo's and cds's and the investment bank culture and the role of the Treasury and the Fed.

Some people are not going to take to a story of economics no matter how many excellent actors are in that film. At dead center of the entire crisis is Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, played wonderfully by William Hurt.A number of factors led to this crisis but key to it was the government's ceasing to regulate this industry years before. Then there was the overheated real estate market with people being allowed homes for which they were never properly qualified.  Also, they tapped constantly into the equity of the home, even though that was based on runaway high figures which would ultimately crash and burn.  This all came to a head in 2008 with Lehman Brothers threatening to go under. James Woods is wonderful too as the man who won't listen to sense at Lehman Brothers.Paul Giamatti (as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke) points out that his academic speciality had been the Great Depression and if they did not act on this crisis there would not only be another but it would much worse than the one from the 1930s.  Billy Crudup is also great as banker-economist Timothy Geithner, who jogs through the streets and calls Paulson to tell him that the man in the street has no inkling he is facing Armageddon and then, back in his office, juggles white cards of which behemoths to force into mergers.If the above is your kind of story, tune in.

1398369,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B004EPYZDA,Dave,"[0, 0]","This was a very good portrayal and probably as close actual events and actions resulting from the lending/housing bubble.  However, it did not go back far enough into history to explain what really caused the bubble.  Without a long, laborious explanation, the initiator of the bubble was the government itself and its efforts to make home ownership possible for minorities.  It started with the government pressuring banks to eliminate redlining, the practice in which banks/mortgage companies would not lend for mortgages in certain neighborhoods they deemed to be substandard credit risks due to the type of people who lived there and the general standards of home maintenance that prevailed in such neighborhoods necessary to maintain home values.  This discriminated against minorities who just happened to live or want to buy a house in such neighborhoods.  With the establishment of Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sponsored agencies that were founded to increase mortgage lending through guarantees and pack ageing of home mortgage securities that could be sold to domestic and foreign investors, the demand for such &#34;safe&#34; US investments grew exponentially world wide.  This resulted in reduced credit standards accepted by these government sponsored agencies that spread to the worldwide US mortgage market and cause an overheating of the housing construction industry.  This film starts when the effects of the reduced credit standards began to result in higher levels of mortgage loan defaults began to result in a domino effect in worldwide credit markets.  In summary, well intentioned government policies begun in the Clinton administration eventually resulted in many people paying too much for homes they could not afford on a long term basis.  It was the fault of people borrowing money that they should have realized they could not repay, the government pushing for lower credit standards, the financial industry for accepting lower standards because it fueled a profitable business in what most thought were safe government backed securities.  The problem was that the government never guaranteed such mortgages but the overwhelming presence of Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac gave the impression that they were guaranteed.  Ultimately, the government had to step in and guarantee debt from such mortgages.  Wall Street was at fault, but equal blame lies with people who borrowed on terms they could not repay and with a government who unintentionally encouraged them to do so.  Overall, the blame lies with those promising something to good to be true and those believing in those promises.  Common sense was ignored by all affected.  Government blame goes to both the Clinton administration and the Barney Frank/Chris Dodd team in Washington that were fanning the flames of easy credit, as well as the Bush administration for taking credit for increased home ownership while not doing anything to thwart unrealistic expectations.  We must guard against our government leading us into situations that our own common sense tells us we must avoid.  This is not the only problem our government will create for us, nor will it be the last.  While Obama cannot be tagged with this one, he is in the process of leaving us with many more.",4,"Excellent Movie About What Happened When Credit Standards Were Lowered, But....",1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,3266,"['was', 'very', 'good', 'portrayal', 'probably', 'close', 'actual', 'events', 'actions', 'resulting', 'lending/housing', 'bubble', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'far', 'enough', 'history', 'explain', 'what', 'really', 'caused', 'bubble', 'long', 'laborious', 'explanation', 'initiator', 'bubble', 'was', 'government', 'efforts', 'make', 'home', 'ownership', 'possible', 'minorities', 'started', 'government', 'pressuring', 'banks', 'eliminate', 'redlining', 'practice', 'banks/mortgage', 'companies', 'would', 'not', 'lend', 'mortgages', 'certain', 'neighborhoods', 'deemed', 'be', 'substandard', 'credit', 'risks', 'due', 'type', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'general', 'standards', 'home', 'maintenance', 'prevailed', 'such', 'neighborhoods', 'necessary', 'maintain', 'home', 'values', 'discriminated', 'minorities', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'live', 'want', 'buy', 'house', 'such', 'neighborhoods', 'establishment', 'Ginnie', 'Mae', 'Freddie', 'Mac', 'government', 'sponsored', 'agencies', 'were', 'founded', 'increase', 'mortgage', 'lending', 'guarantees', 'pack', 'ageing', 'home', 'mortgage', 'securities', 'could', 'be', 'sold', 'domestic', 'foreign', 'investors', 'demand', 'such', '34', 'safe', '34', 'US', 'investments', 'grew', 'exponentially', 'world', 'wide', 'resulted', 'reduced', 'credit', 'standards', 'accepted', 'government', 'sponsored', 'agencies', 'spread', 'worldwide', 'US', 'mortgage', 'market', 'cause', 'overheating', 'housing', 'construction', 'industry', 'film', 'when', 'effects', 'reduced', 'credit', 'standards', 'began', 'result', 'higher', 'levels', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'defaults', 'began', 'result', 'domino', 'effect', 'worldwide', 'credit', 'markets', 'summary', 'well', 'intentioned', 'government', 'policies', 'begun', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'eventually', 'resulted', 'many', 'people', 'paying', 'too', 'much', 'homes', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'long', 'term', 'basis', 'was', 'fault', 'people', 'borrowing', 'money', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'could', 'not', 'repay', 'government', 'pushing', 'lower', 'credit', 'standards', 'financial', 'industry', 'accepting', 'lower', 'standards', 'fueled', 'profitable', 'business', 'what', 'most', 'thought', 'were', 'safe', 'government', 'backed', 'securities', 'problem', 'was', 'government', 'never', 'guaranteed', 'such', 'mortgages', 'overwhelming', 'presence', 'Ginnie', 'Mae', 'Freddie', 'Mac', 'gave', 'impression', 'were', 'guaranteed', 'Ultimately', 'government', 'had', 'step', 'guarantee', 'debt', 'such', 'mortgages', 'Wall', 'Street', 'was', 'fault', 'equal', 'blame', 'people', 'who', 'borrowed', 'terms', 'could', 'not', 'repay', 'government', 'who', 'unintentionally', 'encouraged', 'do', 'so', 'Overall', 'blame', 'promising', 'something', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'believing', 'promises', 'Common', 'sense', 'was', 'ignored', 'affected', 'Government', 'blame', 'both', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'Barney', 'Frank/Chris', 'Dodd', 'team', 'Washington', 'were', 'fanning', 'flames', 'easy', 'credit', 'as', 'well', 'Bush', 'administration', 'taking', 'credit', 'increased', 'home', 'ownership', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'thwart', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'must', 'guard', 'government', 'leading', 'situations', 'own', 'common', 'sense', 'must', 'avoid', 'not', 'only', 'problem', 'government', 'will', 'create', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'Obama', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tagged', 'one', 'process', 'leaving', 'many', 'more']",N/A

As history, even if you followed these events closely as they were unfolding, there is no way to know if it is accurate. I certainly question whether Hank Paulson was as heroic as he is depicted here. Indeed, I strongly doubt it. That this small group of people, none of them ever elected to anything, seem to run the country if not the world, is dismaying; which doesn't make it untrue. That several of them are still running the country - there are claims that Geithner ignores even direct presidential orders he doesn't like - is deeply shocking. That these same characters spanned two administrations of different parties suggests that our elections hardly matter. All of this, IF TRUE, is disturbing in the highest degree; but we don't and cannot know how much of it is true. I am reminded of The Great Caruso, a terrific movie which was so well done it inspired a generation of talented singers, including by his own admission Jos&eacute; Carreras, to devote their lives to opera; but it was largely made up out of whole cloth, bearing little relation to the actual life of Enrico Caruso.

TOO BIG TO FAIL is based on the very long book by Andrew Ross Sorkin that stunned the country with its moment by moment details of how the financial meltdown of 2008 when at the end of President Bush's term the powerful battle between the backs and lending institutions of Wall Street imploded requiring a government bailout to avert a global financial disaster.  The story was adapted for the screen by Peter Gould and directed at breakneck speed by Curtis Hanson, allowing the public to not only see the institutions involved in this scandal but also introduce the players from all parts of the battlefield disclosing details we did not know and the gradual history of the financial mess that had been brewing at the public's expense for years.The film is populated with major actors portraying the big names and while there are clips of President Bush, Warren Buffet and others taken form the CNN newsreels, the big names in the film include such extremely memorable performances  as William Hurt as Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Billy Crudup as Federal Reserve of NY President Timothy Geithner, Paul Giamati as Ben Bernanke, Topher Grace as Paulson's Chief of Staff Jim Wilkinson, James Wood as Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld, Matthew Modine as CIT CEO John Thain, Tony Shalhoub as CEO of Morgan Stanley  John Mack, Bill Pullman as CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon, Ed Asner as Warren Buffett, Victor Slezak as CEO of Bank of America Greg Curl, Ajay Mehta as CEO of Citigroup Vikram Pandit, Michael O'Keefe as JC Flowers, as Barney Frank of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack scandal, Nancy Pelosi as Nancy Pelosi, and Cynthia Nixon as the PR for Paulson Michele Davis.Each member of this huge cast plays very well, with special kudos to William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and James Wood.  Each character is believable but the problem with the film is that it moves past our eyes so quickly with fleeting identifiers of who each actor is portraying that it is next to impossible to keep the players straight.  There is a lot of information and so many board meetings and long work hours that even though the viewer an appreciate the rising calamity and the impact it has globally, it at times becomes word soup.  Even the film's opening credits pack so much information so quickly that we are dizzy before the story starts.  Is that a problem with the film or with our lack of insider information of how we came so close to the biggest financial disaster since the Great Depression? Probably both. Perhaps multiple screenings of this film will allow the audience to catch up tot he speed of what is truly a remarkable docudrama of a harrowing time for this country and the world.  It is very much worth spending time with this terrifying movie.

The cast of William Hurt as Hank Paulson (Treasury Secretary), Paul Giamatti as Ben Bernanke (Chairman of the Federal Reserve), Ed Asner as Warren Buffett, Billy Crudup as Tim Geithner (President of New York Fed), James Woods as Dick Fuld (CEO/Lehman Brothers), Mathew Modine as John Thain (CEO/Merrill Lynch), Ajay Mehta as Vikram Pandit (CEO/Citigroup), Bill Pullman as Jamie Dimon (CEO/JPMorgan), Tony Shalhoub as John Mack (CEO/Morgan Stanley), Evan Handler as Lloyd Blankfein (CEO/ Goldman Sachs), Ayad Akhtar as Neel Kashkari (Asst.

While the financial meltdown was a difficult subject to turn into a movie script, having great acting made it less painful and more interesting. But in order to do so, the director was forced to ""spoon-feed"" the audience on the intricacies of the financial system to keep them in the loop of understanding. In doing so, they also were careful to remain politically neutral, even though responsibility and blame could have been attributed to one party and one President.I personally hate movies that fake political neutrality when reality calls for assessing blame and assigning responsibility. I also hate movies that create dialogue to do the thinking for the audience (and then spoon feed it back to us): that is dialogue designed solely to ensure that the audience ""gets it."" However, in this case the screenwriters and the director didn't seem to have much of a choice? Even so, as we were being carefully led around by our noses we still only knew what one of the actors was thinking: Hank Paulson, as his soliloquy although devoid of any moral culpability, did help connect the dots.Ben Bernanke came off being the conscience of the high-level financial cabal of bankers, FDIC director, hedgefund managers, and Federal Reserve Chairman. Even with heavy-handed ""coaching,"" the plot still was a hard sell. It was uneven, had lots of dead spots, claimed moral and political neutrality, and then came to a most unsatisfactory conclusion: With Tim Geithner predicting that because of lack of stronger regulations, it would just be a matter of time before the meltdown would happens again?It would have helped, to have shown the impact that the meltdown had on ""real (common) people."" The whole world of the financial manipulators just seemed such a compartmentalized abstraction that it was difficult to connect it to the system of morality and legality of which normal people are a part?  As a result, the acts that caused the crash seemed to have existed in another dimension, a realm wholly removed from the people it hurt.Somehow, I kept saying to myself, if Michael Moore had written the film script, then this may have been a better movie.

The human element, emotion and interplay of the characters is what really elevated this from dry documentary to riveting tale of hubris, greed and narrow minded thinking. The heady runup of the housing market, fueled by subprime loans with variable rates, given out freely to unqualified buyers with little or no down payments, came close to causing a worldwide economic collapse. The perpetrators of this ridiculous Ponzi scheme thought they could do no wrong - that the upward march of housing prices would keep the whole rickety ship afloat.The film really works because of the ensemble of top notch actors that HBO assembled - William Hurt, James Woods, Paul Giamatti, Billy Crudup, Edward Asner, Topher Grace, Matthew Modine, Bill Pullman, Tony Shalhoub, Cynthia Nixon and others. The fact that most of the actors physically resembled their real-life counterparts added an aura of believability and credibility.

In Too Big To Fail (TBTF) it was the first time, including the Congressional Hearings, where I have ever heard CDS's explained in layman terms.I am the first to admit that I find non-fiction much more palatable when wrapped around a good story.  What TBTF does is to almost perfectly cast a star studded ensemble around a really good story.I loved the characterizations of John Mack by Tony Shalhoub (""Cover your ears.

Despite having more employees than many private sector corporations, neither the Treasury, Federal Reserve or SEC knew that the British Banking Regulators had to approve any merger by Barclay's.  BTW, this oversight was further compounded by Treasury steadfastly refusing to backstop Lehman for the 30-days it would take for a Barclay's share holder vote2.) Dick Fuld walking into a meeting with a Korean bank that had already agreed to take a stake in Lehman sans their ""toxic: real estate.  Fuld wanted the suitor to take another look at the real estate, which caused a loss of ""face"" and killed the deal3.) See #1.  Not knowing how long it would take to enact the proposed toxic asset buy back program (AKA ""Cash for Trash"")4.)

1398385,A2SH17ZKPJNI76,B004EPYZDA,Karen Sampson Hudson,"[6, 10]","HBO has produced a marvelous film with spot-on acting from the book by Andrew Ross Sorkin.  Although this is ""old news"" to those of us who followed the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, it is presented concisely and clearly.Some facts to ponder:1. The federal government's bailout to the banks was to enable them to continue lending.  This did not happen as the banks did NOT lend to consumers.2. Wall Street bankers are sociopathologically greedy.  Their incomes have increased to record highs even though they did NOT lend and did NOT help the American economy to rebound.3. High finance is not brain surgery.  The ""best and the brightest"" are found in occupations (and service professions) unrelated to, and far from, the mindset on Wall Street.Grammatical notes:  In English, the correct verb form is ""to lend,"" not ""to loan.""  ""Loan"" is a noun.In English, we buy a ""house,"" which is the building.  We live in a ""home,"" which is the  environment, sense of ease and familiarity, that we create in the building. One can buy a house.  One cannot buy a home.Apparently finance majors are not taught proper word use of their native language, as well as any kind of business ethics.",5,excellent HBO presentation,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,1184,"['HBO', 'produced', 'marvelous', 'film', 'spot-on', 'acting', 'book', 'Andrew', 'Ross', 'Sorkin', 'old', 'news', 'who', 'followed', 'financial', 'crisis', 'fall', '2008', 'presented', 'concisely', 'clearly.Some', 'facts', 'ponder:1', 'federal', 'government', 'bailout', 'banks', 'was', 'enable', 'continue', 'lending', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'banks', 'did', 'NOT', 'lend', 'consumers.2', 'Wall', 'Street', 'bankers', 'are', 'sociopathologically', 'greedy', 'incomes', 'have', 'increased', 'record', 'highs', 'even', 'did', 'NOT', 'lend', 'did', 'NOT', 'help', 'American', 'economy', 'rebound.3', 'High', 'finance', 'not', 'brain', 'surgery', 'best', 'brightest', 'are', 'found', 'occupations', 'service', 'professions', 'unrelated', 'far', 'mindset', 'Wall', 'Street.Grammatical', 'notes', 'English', 'correct', 'verb', 'form', 'lend', 'not', 'loan', 'Loan', 'noun.In', 'English', 'buy', 'house', 'building', 'live', 'home', 'environment', 'sense', 'ease', 'familiarity', 'create', 'building', 'One', 'can', 'buy', 'house', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'home.Apparently', 'finance', 'majors', 'are', 'not', 'taught', 'word', 'use', 'native', 'language', 'as', 'well', 'kind', 'business', 'ethics']",N/A

I watched (most of) it then and found the TV production excellent.  Now it's available on DVD, and watching it a second time, I liked it even better.The financial crisis of 2008 was a major turning point in the history of modern finance.  People are still debating what it meant, why it happened, why people did what they did at the time, and what the outcome will be.  To me it seems clear that the problems which caused the crisis still exist today.  In some respects they have been mitigated and in other respects they are even worse.  Anyone who can vote ought to either read the book or watch the movie (or both) to have at least a passing understanding of the issues involved.Sorkin interviewed well over 100 people to write his book (as well as reading plenty of documents).  How does one journalist get access to so many of the major players in the worst financial crisis since the 1930's?  I presume he told each one that others, who had criticized their actions, would be talking to him so they may as well get their own version of reality out there while they had the chance.  OK so given that each person has reasons to try to protect their own reputation, is there any value in compiling it into one story?  Yes, I really think there is value.  This is not an academic work; it spends almost no time explaining the background for the crisis (one speech in the middle of the movie briefly describes what underlay the crisis) and almost no time exploring what might come next.  Instead it is a day by day, almost hour by hour description of how disaster unfolded, and what many of the most powerful financial actors in the world did in response to it.&#34;Hank&#34; Paulson may appear as the character with the most face-time on screen, but there is no &#34;lead character&#34; in this crisis.  Timothy Geithner, Ben Bernanke, Nancy Pelosi, John McCain, Presidents Bush and Obama, Christine Lagarde (now at the IMF; then the French Minister of Finance), Warren Buffett, the heads of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Lehmann Bros, Wells Fargo, the Prime Minister of Japan, and I don't know how many others, all make their appearances.  Yes, probably James Wood as Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers gets the most unsympathetic treatment in this drama--and he did such a good job in the part, too!  This is a great, sad, controversial story.This is one of the most important stories of the generation and it is very well-done.

1398387,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EPYZDA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[100, 104]","In the realm of made-for-TV movies, there is no question that HBO has been leading the way with critically acclaimed and Emmy nominated fare within recent years. Why? They simply have made an effort to be a prestige label and to support and produce edgier, more sophisticated entertainment--oftentimes projects that you can't imagine any other network or studio championing. Turning Andrew Ross Sorkin's provocative chronology ""Too Big To Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System--and Themselves"" into a film version seemed like a somewhat dubious idea. Financial crisis as entertainment isn't the most comfortable notion, and yet the story is rife with drama and intrigue. Curtis Hanson's (L.A. Confidential) riveting docu-drama chronicles the pivotal period in 2008 where the United States, and indeed the world, faced an insurmountable financial collapse. As we still feel the devastating repercussions and are still exposed to the some of the same risk, this makes ""Too Big To Fail"" a must-see project for serious minded and adult audiences.Centered around Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson (William Hurt, who we will be seeing around Emmy time), the film charts the period when Lehman Brothers was spiraling into bankruptcy and how the government's decision not to bail them out exacerbated a worldwide crisis with AIG. Like a house of cards, the tenuous balance of the economic system was in danger of toppling unless some major moves and compromises could be made. Introducing a huge cast of characters, the narrative puts Paulson at the center of the action as he wrestles to maintain an overall financial stability. As a dramatic recreation and interpretation of events, this plays as a blow-by-blow thriller. Even though you might be aware of the outcome, it doesn't lessen the film's brisk pace or unrelenting intensity. Seriously, I found this to be edge of your seat exciting as well as enlightening. Truly an important piece for the time in which we live.Aside from Hurt's stellar work (his best performance in years), the film boasts an oily and uncompromising turn by James Wood as the Lehman CEO and an increasingly desperate portrayal of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank by a great Billy Crudup. In addition to these larger roles, the film boasts the most impressive cast of the year with Paul Giamatti, Ed Asner, Bill Pullman, Topher Grace, Cynthia Nixon, Tony Shalhoub, Matthew Modine, Kathy Baker and many other familiar faces. Smart, provocative, chilling, literate, and most of all, incredibly entertaining--I highly recommend ""Too Big To Fail"" as one of the year's best dramas produced for television. In truth, I didn't expect to be as engaged and involved as I became. Anticipating a somewhat dry history lesson, HBO has instead served up an irresistible and important contemporary thriller. Don't miss it.

William Hurt and this all star talented cast understand their role in this very complicated game of high economics. This is an excellent film to use for an economics course. The terminology used through the movie is higher than our understanding.What I enjoyed about this film is that there is a scene which considers the audience in explaining some of the complicated terminology and explaination of finance enough to help the audience understand in layman terms what this entire country was up against and is still up against.We haven't nearly crawled out of the woods yet in this disaster. What needs to be understood is that we just made it in the nick of time and only by a 1/16th of a hair from the Great Depression. We have truly no idea how close we have come to complete and total disaster. What I also enjoyed about this film is that there was a humility behind these giants behind our money in which even Hurt's character is so very frightened that he vomits and is so terrified of the possible outcome of the mess that was made due to toxic lending and lack of legislation and control in lending practices. It should have taught many NOT to be so damned greedy, even in our personal lives. I mean, how big does your house have to be?This is an important movie to watch in that most of our banks and lending finds so many of us to be stupid enough to chase after ""things"" that we wish to afford and are too whimsical to accept that we cannot. Greed is what nearly destroyed us and still many of the banks who were saved by the few who did not want to take that chance have not repaid those banks from bailing them out.

At this point the movie comes together in one scene which explains the whole crisis in layman's terms and why mommies and kitties will die if AIG goes under...okay maybe not the last part, Ben Bernake does that later.Billy Crudup plays Timothy Geithner the head of the NY Federal Reserve.

In 2008 the United States economy began to crumble. Bank after bank began to fail and Lehman Brothers (the 4th largest) was on the ropes. Secretary of Treasury Hank Paulson (Hurt), Federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke (Giamatti) and New York Fed President Tim Geithner (Crudup) all are working to try and save it. They more they find out the worse it gets and they are left with a decision to save the country or the bank. But the answer isn't as easy as it sounds. I know what your thinking. Another movie about this, hasn't there been enough? Normally I would agree but this one had Paul Giamatti so I had to watch it. This one stands far above the other ones made about the crisis and also is pretty impressive in the way it is presented. This movie made the crisis and the reasons for what was done simple enough for me to understand. Unlike the others this one is about how the government handled it and not the Wall Street CEO's which is why I didn't want to throw stuff at the TV as much. This movie was all the more impressive in the way that it really made the government the good guy in this whole mess and made you side with them. Which is almost impossible to do these days.
