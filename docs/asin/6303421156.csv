Charlie grows up being overpowered by his father's decisions and the expectations of his family to marry a neighbor's daughter (Victoria), all for material gain (his family would expand their land territory and she would increase her family's treasure chest).  After his father's death, Charlie grows up: learning how to run a farm, and how to fight in battle, and how to care for his comrades on the front (the Great War).  His greatest achievement is realizing who he really loves - Nellie.While realizing that his marriage to Victoria (Nellie's sister) was a sham, that his sister had robbed him and left his estate naked, and that he had killed a man - Ginger - in cold blood (because of built up hate), Charlie breaks down in front of his future wife, Nellie and says:  ""The truth is too much for me.""This great family drama (that portrays the vices of people, evil intentions, and ugly face of reality in our world) has a positive outcome after Charlie has a cathartic moment:""The most frightening thing in life is to come face to face with yourself!""Now, after a bloody marriage, bloody war, and blood-dried estate farm, Charlie and Nellie can start life afresh.

Casey,"[7, 8]","Set in the rural areas around Newcastle during the years 1913-1918, this impressive dramatization of Cookson's work centers on the personal struggles of a wealthy young land owner (Charlie) who is seen by many around him as a weakling and utter failure until he is thrown into the cauldron of military service on the Western Front and is forced by circumstances to fight and lead or perish.  Much of his inspiration and will to survive comes from the love and devotion of Nellie, the troubled younger sister of his unfaithful, stunningly beautiful wife Victoria.Although the starring roles are played ably by Lloyd Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the most memorable and arresting performance was delivered by Maria Miles as Nellie.  Maria Miles brought her character to life and graced her with a beauty that surpassed even that of Catherine Zeta-Jones.  In fact, the character of Nellie emerges from personal depression to become one of the genuinely strong and likeable figures in of the Cookson series (and I have seen them all).",5,Stirring Drama --- Maria Miles delivers an exceptional performance.,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1031,"['Set', 'rural', 'areas', 'Newcastle', 'years', '1913-1918', 'impressive', 'dramatization', 'Cookson', 'work', 'centers', 'personal', 'struggles', 'wealthy', 'young', 'land', 'owner', 'Charlie', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'around', 'weakling', 'utter', 'failure', 'thrown', 'cauldron', 'military', 'service', 'Western', 'Front', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'fight', 'lead', 'perish', 'Much', 'inspiration', 'will', 'survive', 'love', 'devotion', 'Nellie', 'troubled', 'younger', 'sister', 'unfaithful', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'starring', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'ably', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'most', 'memorable', 'arresting', 'performance', 'was', 'delivered', 'Maria', 'Miles', 'Nellie', 'Maria', 'Miles', 'brought', 'character', 'life', 'graced', 'beauty', 'surpassed', 'even', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'fact', 'character', 'Nellie', 'personal', 'depression', 'become', 'one', 'genuinely', 'strong', 'likeable', 'figures', 'Cookson', 'series', 'have', 'seen']",The Cinder Path VHS

The Girl - (16 February 1996)""The Girl"" focuses on a young woman who must overcome emotional and physical obstacles to finally come into the life she deserves. This tale is no different.

Catherine Zeta Jones played the role of an unfaithful, unloving wife, but did a good job.  The lead role was well played and the best part was that it all ended happily.",5,First Rate,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,301,"['Have', 'loved', 'Ms.', 'Cookson', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Good', 'story', 'love', 'war', 'infidelity', 'revenge', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'played', 'role', 'unfaithful', 'unloving', 'wife', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'ended', 'happily']",The Cinder Path VHS

He lets his father bully him, covers up one murder, and later commits another; he marries, goes to war, and gets a commission because other people tell him to, not through any will of his own. His wife warns him that she won't be faithful, and he clearly doesn't love her, but still gets angry when she does exactly what she told him she would. Worst of all, he treats his own sister like a hired hand. Near the end when she steals from him and emigrates I cheered for her.It wasn't helped by the lead actor looking like a deer caught in headlights in every scene.",1,Unbelievable story and acting,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,648,"['hero', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'nice', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'like', 'father', 'bully', 'up', 'one', 'murder', 'later', 'war', 'commission', 'other', 'people', 'tell', 'not', 'will', 'own', 'wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'faithful', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'love', 'still', 'angry', 'when', 'exactly', 'what', 'told', 'would', 'Worst', 'own', 'sister', 'hired', 'hand', 'end', 'when', 'cheered', 'her.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'helped', 'lead', 'actor', 'looking', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'scene']",The Cinder Path VHS

Her stories are full of overcoming odds to become successful and, usually, find love. Most of her heroines begin life as not loved.  There are lots of not so nice men in the stories. The Cinder Path is full of rich characters. Most notice that Catherine Zeta-Jones is in it, but she is the weakest character. It takes place just before WWI breaks out and carries you through the war.I particularly like her stories because they deal with the middle and lower classes. The films stay true to the periods. They are not Up Stairs, Down Stairs. They concentrate on the challenges of adversity.",4,Stories for Women,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,678,"['Catherine', 'Cookson', 'wrote', 'challenges', 'women', '19th', 'early', '20th', 'centuries', 'stories', 'are', 'full', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'become', 'successful', 'usually', 'find', 'love', 'Most', 'heroines', 'begin', 'life', 'not', 'loved', 'are', 'lots', 'not', 'nice', 'men', 'stories', 'Cinder', 'Path', 'full', 'rich', 'characters', 'Most', 'notice', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'weakest', 'character', 'place', 'just', 'before', 'WWI', 'out', 'war.I', 'particularly', 'stories', 'deal', 'middle', 'lower', 'classes', 'films', 'stay', 'true', 'periods', 'are', 'not', 'Up', 'Stairs', 'Down', 'Stairs', 'concentrate', 'challenges', 'adversity']",The Cinder Path VHS
