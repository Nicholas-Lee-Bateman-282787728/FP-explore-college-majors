When season 3 was released it was missing the 1-hour 'Roast' episode.  Months later they discontinuted the DVD and RE-RELEASED it as the 'Roast Edition' just in time for the release of Kiss' 'Sonic Boom' CD(so it could sit next to it at your local Wal*Mart).  Season 5 is missing an episode called 'KISSteria', a 1-hour episode of the band on tour in Australia.  Any fan of the show or the band should know the episode I'm talking about.  I tried to contact A&E home video at least 3-4 times BEFORE season 5 was released to ask if the episode was on the DVD.  I got the run around.  Saying things like 'since it is not released yet, we do not know blah blah' and this was the day BEFORE Amazon started to sell it.  So I suggest this: DON'T BUY IT.  This has been done twice by A&E and it smacks of greed.  Maybe it's not on the DVD because the whole episode is all about KISS and not Gene and his family - who knows.  But the simple fact is they do not include every episode and call it 'the complete season 5' just like they did with season 3.  It has all the Family Jewels graphics, etc. of a regular episode.

Nick & Sofia do NOT behave as such spoiled kids this time, thank God.Of course there are still some stupid, hard to swallow situations (specially the one with the birthday cake in the car, gimme a break!) but nothing important.Paul Stanley appears for the first time on the show and he speaks, like, 3 sentences and they are ALL brilliant! Great to have him.There are also chapters that all KISS freaks such as me will LOVE (specially the return to Gene's childhood home).After the 4th season I wanted the series to STOP.

Let me say that right out of the gate.I did start watching this show on A & E.  I enjoy it.I like the family.  Nick & Sophie are refreshing as they are NOT into bad things after learning from their Dad that because you are in rock and roll that the drugs and alcohol do NOT need to be a part of that.I still say A LOT of these situations are staged just for the cameras.Best episode  ""The Demon Turns 60"".  For Kiss fans, the ONLY episode with Paul Stanley.Shows are wide screen that is good.No real good extras, just additional footage.And, the DVD makers, A & E or Gene or all of the above so to speak should be ashamed of themselves for releasing both the 4th & 5th season on the same day and to make it worse 12-21-10.  I could NOT find the DVD's in stores, had to order online.If you are a fan you will enjoy the DVD package.

1379494,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0040LAH8A,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[5, 7]","After four seasons the show remains excellent and there are many highlights in season 5. Gene's 60th Birthday is certainly one of them (it's the first time Paul is on the show!), Gene goes on Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? , the hour long 100th episode special, Shannon's Tazer party and Nick promoting his Incarnate book were all great parts of the fifth season. I never thought the show would last as long as it did and season 5 is just as good as any Family Jewels season, I find the episodes are still entertaining and fun to watch, I mean, the show is still a good one after all that time the quality has not gone down. I like Gene Simmons Family Jewels better than most reality shows and that's not just because I'm a KISS fan but mostly because those people are likable and I actually like them, they seems like nice people and their lives are interesting to a certain degree.I like that season 5 is being released on DVD, I really do, but the bad part is that there is an episode missing. The special episode on the Australia tour which aired this past summer is not included, I feel like it should be here because it was a highly interesting special and one that KISS fans would love to see again. I'm glad that I own the episodes on DVD but it would've been great to have the missing episode included. If I would've known it wasn't included I still would have bought the DVD, it's not like it ruins EVERYTHING it's just too bad it's not here. If you want to won this season, you should. Just be aware that there is an episode missing. 4/5 for the episodes and 3/5 for the DVD lacking an episode (after all it's not a ""complete"" season then).",3,DVD is missing an episode but this is an overall great season of the show,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1657,"['four', 'seasons', 'show', 'excellent', 'are', 'many', 'highlights', 'season', '5', 'Gene', '60th', 'Birthday', 'certainly', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'Paul', 'show', 'Gene', 'Are', 'Smarter', 'Than', 'Fifth', 'Grader', 'hour', 'long', '100th', 'episode', 'special', 'Shannon', 'Tazer', 'party', 'Nick', 'promoting', 'Incarnate', 'book', 'were', 'great', 'parts', 'fifth', 'season', 'never', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'season', '5', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'season', 'find', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'mean', 'show', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'quality', 'not', 'gone', 'down', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'better', 'most', 'reality', 'shows', 'not', 'just', ""'m"", 'KISS', 'fan', 'mostly', 'people', 'are', 'likable', 'actually', 'nice', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'interesting', 'certain', 'degree.I', 'season', '5', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'really', 'do', 'bad', 'part', 'episode', 'missing', 'special', 'episode', 'Australia', 'tour', 'aired', 'past', 'summer', 'not', 'included', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'here', 'was', 'highly', 'interesting', 'special', 'one', 'KISS', 'fans', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'have', 'missing', 'episode', 'included', 'would', ""'ve"", 'known', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'not', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'here', 'want', 'won', 'season', 'should', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'episode', 'missing', '4/5', 'episodes', '3/5', 'DVD', 'lacking', 'episode', 'not', 'complete', 'season', 'then']",N/A
