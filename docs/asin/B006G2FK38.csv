It kept surprising and delighting me with its little twists and unexpected turns.  At the end, I realized I'd seen a really neat little comedy of Japanese manners executed by director Koji Fukada.  It's a film that gets to the heart of some uniquely Japanese characteristics: a general inability to say 'no,' to leave thoughts unfinished or open to interpretation, to try to maintain an air of civility at all costs, and a general unease about the role and position of gaijin (non-Japanese) in today's society.We don't think much when Kagawa (Kanji Furutachi) shows up in Mikio's (Keji Yamaguchi) staid life.  Mikio runs a small, local printing press in the bottom floor of his little living space which he shares with his second wife and daughter by his first wife.  Kagawa claims a loose connection to Mikio's father.  Mikio accepts the tale at face value and ultimately ends up offering a spare room and cutting him in on the printing work.  From there, Kagawa gets incrementally bolder and more outrageous.  Things start to get really weird for Mikio when Kagawa's supposed wife Annabelle (Bryerly Long, you had me at 'hello') shows up and shacks up.  Annabelle's roots and story are never quite fixed, which is entirely the point.Kagawa's game is increasingly difficult to predict.  Ultimately, he works Mikio into a fully compromised position (you can almost hear 'checkmate').  At that point, he announces gleefully to Annabelle, ""It's time.""  What happens next...well, you need to see it for yourself.If you have any interest into how Japanese society functions (it's always fascinated me), then you owe it yourself to see this interesting take on things.",4,A really neat little comedy of Japanese manners executed by director Koji Fukada,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1725,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Hospitalit', 'eacute', 'kept', 'surprising', 'delighting', 'little', 'twists', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'end', 'realized', ""'d"", 'seen', 'really', 'neat', 'little', 'comedy', 'Japanese', 'manners', 'executed', 'director', 'Koji', 'Fukada', 'film', 'heart', 'uniquely', 'Japanese', 'characteristics', 'general', 'inability', 'say', ""'no"", 'leave', 'thoughts', 'unfinished', 'open', 'interpretation', 'try', 'maintain', 'air', 'civility', 'costs', 'general', 'unease', 'role', 'position', 'gaijin', 'non-Japanese', 'today', 'society.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'when', 'Kagawa', 'Kanji', 'Furutachi', 'up', 'Mikio', 'Keji', 'Yamaguchi', 'staid', 'life', 'Mikio', 'small', 'local', 'printing', 'press', 'bottom', 'floor', 'little', 'living', 'space', 'shares', 'second', 'wife', 'daughter', 'first', 'wife', 'Kagawa', 'loose', 'connection', 'Mikio', 'father', 'Mikio', 'tale', 'face', 'value', 'ultimately', 'up', 'offering', 'spare', 'room', 'cutting', 'printing', 'work', 'there', 'Kagawa', 'incrementally', 'bolder', 'more', 'outrageous', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'really', 'weird', 'Mikio', 'when', 'Kagawa', 'supposed', 'wife', 'Annabelle', 'Bryerly', 'Long', 'had', ""'hello"", 'up', 'shacks', 'up', 'Annabelle', 'roots', 'story', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'fixed', 'entirely', 'point.Kagawa', 'game', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'predict', 'Ultimately', 'Mikio', 'fully', 'compromised', 'position', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', ""'checkmate"", 'point', 'gleefully', 'Annabelle', 'time', 'What', 'next', 'well', 'need', 'see', 'yourself.If', 'have', 'interest', 'how', 'Japanese', 'society', 'functions', 'always', 'fascinated', 'then', 'owe', 'see', 'interesting', 'take', 'things']",Hospitalite: Welcome To Our House

I love learning about everything from the food, the beliefs, customs, and overall way of life. Movies are a great vehicle to give us a glimpse into societies we'd otherwise may never have exposure to. Hospitalit&eacute; does just that as it delves into the quiet household of Mikio Kobayashi (Kenji Yamauchi) and his family.Mikio lives a somewhat plain life along with his beautiful, and notably younger, wife, daughter, and his divorced sister. The family drama alone is fairly entertaining, but things get a little more exciting for the family when Kagawa (Kanji Furutachi) arrives. Kagawa claims to be the son of a financier who once helped Mikio's printing business. Mikio has some recollection of this, so he feels obligated to be hospitable to Kagawa.Before you know it, Kagawa invites himself to be a live-in employee along with his non-Japanese wife (we are never quite sure of her nationality). Thus the concept of hospitalit&eacute; comes into play. The Kobayashi's adapt around their new visitors, which both brings them closer and draws them apart in some respects. I think anyone who's ever had an unwelcomed house guest can relate to this situation, and those who have know that it often can bring out the best and worst of us.The film becomes more than just a wacky comedy, but more about family, community, and of course, hospitality. The Japanese culture is always been on I've been very interested in, so this movie provided a lot of enlightenment and entertainment for me. The director wrote about the film inside the DVD case for the film and discussed about Japan's historical view of outsiders. He said he'd like to see more foreigners in Japan to mix things up and keep it interesting. That thought provides a lot of insight and more meaning into the film.I enjoyed this film mostly due to its message and honesty. I too hope that the world becomes more accepting of other cultures and people who are simply different. The film does a great job of showing a family and their conflicts and milestones as a result of accepting an outsider. However the humor for me was possibly lost in translation, as I felt the film was fairly dry with exception to a few humorous scenes. I had trouble really liking most of the characters, often becoming annoyed with some of them. But hey, maybe that is the point and I'm not supposed to love them, but accept them? Either way, I felt as if I were missing something on many occasions and lost interest during a few periods of the film.Though the film didn't quite have the laughs or relevant characters for me, it still achieved what it set out to do. It makes a strong statement, and does so in an honest, artful and sometimes quirky manner.Source: criticnic.com 18-September-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Film Movement",3,Enlightening and quirky film about hospitality,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,2841,"[""'m"", 'always', 'intrigued', 'other', 'cultures', 'way', 'life', 'love', 'learning', 'everything', 'food', 'beliefs', 'customs', 'overall', 'way', 'life', 'Movies', 'are', 'great', 'vehicle', 'give', 'glimpse', 'societies', ""'d"", 'otherwise', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'exposure', 'Hospitalit', 'eacute', 'just', 'quiet', 'household', 'Mikio', 'Kobayashi', 'Kenji', 'Yamauchi', 'family.Mikio', 'somewhat', 'plain', 'life', 'beautiful', 'notably', 'younger', 'wife', 'daughter', 'divorced', 'sister', 'family', 'drama', 'alone', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'exciting', 'family', 'when', 'Kagawa', 'Kanji', 'Furutachi', 'Kagawa', 'be', 'son', 'financier', 'who', 'once', 'helped', 'Mikio', 'printing', 'business', 'Mikio', 'recollection', 'obligated', 'be', 'hospitable', 'Kagawa.Before', 'know', 'Kagawa', 'be', 'live-in', 'employee', 'non-Japanese', 'wife', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'nationality', 'Thus', 'concept', 'hospitalit', 'eacute', 'play', 'Kobayashi', 'adapt', 'new', 'visitors', 'closer', 'draws', 'apart', 'respects', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'unwelcomed', 'house', 'guest', 'can', 'relate', 'situation', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'often', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'worst', 'us.The', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'more', 'family', 'community', 'course', 'hospitality', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'always', 'been', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'interested', 'movie', 'provided', 'lot', 'enlightenment', 'entertainment', 'director', 'wrote', 'film', 'DVD', 'case', 'film', 'discussed', 'Japan', 'historical', 'view', 'outsiders', 'said', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'foreigners', 'Japan', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'keep', 'interesting', 'thought', 'lot', 'insight', 'more', 'meaning', 'film.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'mostly', 'due', 'message', 'honesty', 'too', 'hope', 'world', 'more', 'accepting', 'other', 'cultures', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'different', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'family', 'conflicts', 'milestones', 'result', 'accepting', 'outsider', 'However', 'humor', 'was', 'possibly', 'lost', 'translation', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'dry', 'exception', 'few', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'had', 'trouble', 'really', 'liking', 'most', 'characters', 'often', 'becoming', 'annoyed', 'hey', 'maybe', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'supposed', 'love', 'way', 'felt', 'were', 'missing', 'something', 'many', 'occasions', 'lost', 'interest', 'few', 'periods', 'film.Though', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'laughs', 'relevant', 'characters', 'still', 'achieved', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'strong', 'statement', 'so', 'honest', 'artful', 'sometimes', 'quirky', 'manner.Source', 'criticnic.com', '18-September-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'Film', 'Movement']",Hospitalite: Welcome To Our House
1514872,A2IYRRHZMF49L1,B006G2FK38,J  Tate,"[2, 2]","Mikio Kobayashi (Kenji Yamauchi) runs a printing business on the ground floor of his home. His second and very young wife Natsuki (Kiki Sugino) handles the financial affairs of the shop and looks after his daughter Eriko (Erika Ono).  Into their lives comes a manipulative con man/blackmailer named Kagawa (Kanji Furutachi) claiming to be the son of an old friend of Kobayashi's father. Kagawa rapidly takes over the job of a sick employee and gets room and board provided too. Kagawa then also brings his wife to live in the house,  the wife says she is from Brazil but one has doubts about this statement as she later says she is from Bosnia. Her English sounds American.  What follows is that Kobayashi's life and the life of his family is turned inside out and upside down. Although this movie starts off subtly and slowly it picks up speed as it goes along, secrets are revealed and the plot thickens.  I found this film to be primarily an outing and criticism about Japanese xenophobia.  The xenophobia is most pronounced in the neighborhood watch group that wants to clear their small area of Tokyo from foreigners and the homeless.  It's interesting though that despite the xenophobia Kobayashi's young daughter Eriko is learning English and that his divorced sister, who also lives with them, hopes to move abroad and also wants to learn English. This movie is a black comedy/drama that despite it's slow start eventually builds to a raucous finish.  It is like hospitality taken to the absurd when manipulative people are able to almost totally overcome the lives of weaker and gentler people.  I give it 4 stars for being different and entertaining.",4,Hospitality Taken To The Absurd,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,1660,"['Mikio', 'Kobayashi', 'Kenji', 'Yamauchi', 'printing', 'business', 'ground', 'floor', 'home', 'second', 'very', 'young', 'wife', 'Natsuki', 'Kiki', 'Sugino', 'financial', 'affairs', 'shop', 'daughter', 'Eriko', 'Erika', 'Ono', 'Into', 'lives', 'manipulative', 'con', 'man/blackmailer', 'named', 'Kagawa', 'Kanji', 'Furutachi', 'claiming', 'be', 'son', 'old', 'friend', 'Kobayashi', 'father', 'Kagawa', 'rapidly', 'job', 'sick', 'employee', 'room', 'board', 'provided', 'too', 'Kagawa', 'then', 'also', 'wife', 'live', 'house', 'wife', 'Brazil', 'one', 'doubts', 'statement', 'later', 'Bosnia', 'English', 'sounds', 'American', 'What', 'Kobayashi', 'life', 'life', 'family', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'movie', 'subtly', 'slowly', 'up', 'speed', 'along', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'plot', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'primarily', 'outing', 'criticism', 'Japanese', 'xenophobia', 'xenophobia', 'most', 'pronounced', 'neighborhood', 'watch', 'group', 'clear', 'small', 'area', 'Tokyo', 'foreigners', 'homeless', 'interesting', 'xenophobia', 'Kobayashi', 'young', 'daughter', 'Eriko', 'learning', 'English', 'divorced', 'sister', 'who', 'also', 'move', 'abroad', 'also', 'learn', 'English', 'movie', 'black', 'comedy/drama', 'slow', 'start', 'eventually', 'raucous', 'finish', 'hospitality', 'taken', 'absurd', 'when', 'manipulative', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'almost', 'totally', 'overcome', 'lives', 'weaker', 'gentler', 'people', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'being', 'different', 'entertaining']",Hospitalite: Welcome To Our House
1514873,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006G2FK38,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","The Japanese film ""Hospitalite"" has a gentle quirkiness that is rather disarming.  I knew nothing about the film before settling in to watch it and, to a large degree, the film thwarted my every expectation.  What begins as a lightweight family drama morphs into a twisty game of manipulation before settling into a true celebration of life.  Seriously, you've got no idea where this story will end up from where it begins.  And that's always a positive from my perspective.  Elements of drama, black comedy and even slapstick take turns in this tale that gets increasingly odd as it progresses.  But the odder it got, the more charmed I became.  I can understand how some might find the beginning too subtle as it establishes the characters and their relationships with gentle humor, but it is exactly this more mild mannered approach that really sells the big finale.  And the final section of the film is quite big, quite unexpected, quite jubilant and surprisingly meaningful as well.The movie is set in a small print shop, a family business fallen on hard times.  The store also serves as a domicile for its proprietor, his second wife, his young daughter and his divorced sister.  The family dynamic is well established, their lives are run by routine and what's expected by society (there are plenty of nosy neighbors).  An old acquaintance makes a mysterious appearance and before you know it, he has insinuated himself into a new job and a new place to live within the print shop.  His actions seem suspicious and his presence is somewhat unsettling.  But he starts to see thinly veiled secrets and the undercurrents of emotions that this family are keeping stifled.  With this knowledge, he starts to get more and more intimately involved.  I don't want to reveal too much, so I'll just say that the home takes on a whole new dimension.  Is the stranger sinister?  Or is he liberating?I really had a good time with ""Hospitalite"" after its slow burn beginning.  It's a truly original piece that turns out to be unexpectedly joyous and life-affirming.  The Bonus Short Film on the DVD is ""Miyuki"" a twelve minute entry from America.  It doesn't really tie into the main feature thematically aside from the fact that its central character is Japanese.  It tells the slight, but amusing, story of a transplant in New York looking for friendship and connectivity through Internet personals.  She doesn't get quite what she bargained for.  It was pleasant enough, but not particularly essential.  I've seen dozens of similar stories that cover the same terrain, but it was cute.  It pales next to the bold originality of ""Hospitalite.""  So if you want to sample something quite unusual, this is an easy recommendation.  But remember, it may start slowly but it just keeps gaining momentum.

I am a subscriber of their DVD-of-the-month Club but this is an older release that I hadn't see yet.&#34;Hospitalit&eacute;&#34; (2010 release from Japan; 95 min.) brings the story of a man who owns a small printing company along with his (much younger) wife and his divorced sister. The business is literally run from the front room of the house. One day a stranger shows up, claiming to be the son of a well-doer who gave the family some much needed help back in the day. As it happens, the only other employee of the shop has health issues, so the man decides to hire the stranger and give him room and board. This becomes a major issue as not much longer after that, a woman claiming to be the stranger's wife, a gorgeous looking Brazilian, shows up. At this point, we are about 30 min. into the movie and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience.Couple of comments: first of all, I have no idea why the movie's title for the US release is &#34;Hospitalit&eacute;&#34; (as opposed to, say, &#34;Hospitality&#34;). Second, the movie offers some seldom-seen ideas about the lack of diversity in Japanese society, which in fact is one of the most homogenous cultures and societies in the world. Third, there are several winning performances, notably American actress Bryerly Long (in the role of the Brazilian woman) and Kumi Hyodo as the young wife. As always, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and on this release, it is a great US shortie called &#34;Miyuki&#34; (12 min.), about a lonely young Japanese woman who recently moved to New York and out of desperation tries the internet to meet people, with unintended consequences. Watch!Bottom line: &#34;Hospitalit&eacute;&#34; is a pleasant movie, striking a great balance between comedy and drama, and with winning performances.
