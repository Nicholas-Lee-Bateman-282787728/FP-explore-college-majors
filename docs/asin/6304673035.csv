Here's another in a long, line of Presley vehicles that combines a juvenile plot, silly acting, and endless three chord songs with inane lyrics. This guy's acting was worse than his singing---and that's saying something. The most conspicuous thing about the movie is the amount of grease is Presley's hair and the repetitiveness of his monosyllabic dialogue. He was a real cornball with a gnat's IQ and no talent. Truly, do his idol-worshipping fans realize that Presley's IQ was under 80?

This piece gives you both, a sort of sixties resort  acapulco, and some sizzling Esquivel tinged Latin Pop.  The title song, in  it's kind of non pc sort of way, is one of my favorites of the title track  variety(though thanks to a collection bought at a truck stop in New Mexico,  I have a great affection for many of them).  &quot;This is no time for  Siesta, this is time for fun&quot; demands Elvis, and truly the music is  fun.  No room to rhumba in a sports car is great for the title alone..  oh, Elvis is a cliff diver in this one, and as he is conquering his circus  performer demons he sings one of the great Elvis songs, which is one of a  small subgenre of his numbers.  The subgenre has to do with a guy trying to  get to some ethnic girl, but the only way she can communicate is through  the cultural dance of her heritage....Elvis's earlier foray into this  subgenre was The Blue Hawaii steel string tinged Rock-a-Hula Baby(penned by  Ed Wood girlfriend Dolores Fuller).

Both of them were learning new languages. Ursula Andress was just learning English (reason for her voiced being dubbed in ""Dr. No""), and Elvis had to learn Spanish because some of the songs he sang have Spanish lyrics. So it was hard work for them. You have to hear Elvis sing in Spanish. It's so different. Here, he plays a former circus performer who comes to Acapulco to get away from his past. He's hired as a lifeguard at a hotel, and sings for the guests at night. Being a lifeguard wasn't easy, because when he was in the circus, he was in the acrobats. On one swing he missed his partner who fell to the ground and resulted in a terrible accident. When a rival lifeguard learns about it, he challenges him to dive again since now Elvis' character is afraid of heights. He's finally able to gain back his courage, beats up the rival Alejandro Rey in a great fight scene, and climbs to the highest clif and makes the highest dive. He wins the heart of Ursula Andress, too.

After a rollicking duet while Elvis bicycles through the streets to where Raul tells him to go he gets hired by a hotel to sing because their regular singer is sick. Among various singing engagements Elvis encounters a sultry, female bullfighter, and the daughter of a chef who has a mission in mind. I also got treated to the lifeguard being played by Alejandro Rey, a good-looking guy I remember from The Flying Nun. Elvis' character, Mike, has a secret we see in flashbacks but that he keeps hidden. However, Rey finds out and calls him a coward.

430633,A2I92HD4VS0SJW,6304673035,Terry,"[0, 0]",This movie came in very good condition. Elvis and a Mexican boy are together as close friends. Elvis swings and sings at a club and the people enjoy him. One highlight in the movie is where Elvis goes to the top of a high cliff and gets his courage up and takes a jump into the water way down below and comes up unhurt. Another highlight is Elvis plays a bullfighter and he does a great job of it with people shouting &#34;ole&#34;.

To keep them occupied, I told them that Elvis never left Hollywood to make this movie so they needed to spot the real Elvis shots and the other location shots that featured a double.  It worked.  Between songs, they had fun picking out the real locations from the bad rear-projection shots of Elvis.""Bossa Nova Baby"" is the only real song worth anything (like ""Return to Sender"" was the only real song in GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!).  The rest all sound like bad Mexican tunes about bulls or bullfighters.  Ursula Andress is hot but she's a long way away from Honey Rider in DR.
