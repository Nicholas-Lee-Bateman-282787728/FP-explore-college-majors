864477,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0006A9FJ6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","In this film, as has-been tennis player Peter Colt surprisingly ascends to prominence, his agent manages to line him up with a new Frito Lay potato chip to endorse, called ""Surprisingly Zesty."" This, to me, is as good a label as any when trying to describe this film. WIMBLEDON is surprisingly zesty. Tennis, in the states, is fairly popular but not as huge as the big three sports. So to say that this romantic sports film manages to be very entertaining is an unexpected triumph.Love is such a strange racket, especially when it comes with no strings attached (sorry). WIMBLEDON tells of what happens when British tennis pro Peter Colt, on the very last legs of his career (once ranked 11th in the world, he's now 119th), meets young and fiery American, Lizzie Bradbury, as she competes for the very first time in the Wimbledon tournament, the most hallowed of grand slams. Sparks go up, and Peter and Lizzie venture into a mutually agreed carefree romance.Peter, having earned a wild card berth into the tournament but having already decided to retire immediately afterwards, finds his game suddenly elevated. And, because athletes are ridiculously superstitious, he assumes his unexpected success stems from his fling with Lizzie, as, so far, he's spent the eve of each of his Wimbledon matches with her. As he keeps winning, the pressure is on to maintain the romantic routine. This, even as he begins to seriously fall for Lizzie. On the other hand, Lizzie finds herself losing her game face and focus. And, this, as she begins to seriously fall for Peter.So there goes the carefree romance...I happen to dig tennis. I date back to Sampras, Agassi, Graf, Hingis (when she was at the top of the world), and even as far back as my man John McEnroe. But most folks I know just aren't that into tennis. However, regarding WIMBLEDON, you don't have to be a fan of the sport to get into the story. This is tennis made accessible and the play on the court is grippingly presented. You actually get into the matches. Paul Bettany has that slim, athletic build to convincingly pull off his role, and he did plenty of the stunts (even if, a lot of times, the tennis ball had to be inserted graphically). One only wishes that Kirsten Dunst had been on the court more (but, no, she isn't as convincing as Bettany on the tennis court).I don't know too much of Paul Bettany. I've only ever seen him in two other films, the rollickingA Knight's Tale (Special Edition)(he plays Geoffrey Chaucer) and the mediocreFirewall (Widescreen Edition)(where he plays the lead villain). This is actually Paul Bettany's first time as a romantic lead, yet I wasn't all that surprised by how easily he shouldered that role. Guy simply spews that casual charisma (these Brit gents all must attend How To Be Disarming and Urbane 101). Of course, his rootability is enhanced by the film's use of ""radiohead,"" a device in which the audience is allowed to listen to Peter's turmoiled, neurotic thoughts during his matches. It's fun listening to his mind state scale increasingly frantic heights, the deeper he advances. Peter Colt is such a warm, wry, and engaging character. You can't help but pull for this underdog, on and off the court.I don't want to say too much about Kirsten Dunst, 'cause I've been crushing on her for a while now. I'll just end up gushing like a numbnut. But, listen, the romance is frothy and light and easy to swallow, buoyed by Bettany and Dunst's sparkling chemistry. Even if you don't dig the tennis play, the love story makes you want to stick around. Not to mention, WIMBLEDON is pretty funny, with one of my favorite moments taking place during one of Peter's matches and involving a sheepish Jon Favreau.The leads are ably supported by Sam Neill (as Lizzie's stern pops), Jon Favreau (as Peter's dubiously sly agent), Nicolaj Coster Waldau (as Peter's German friend and practice partner), and a fresh-faced James McAvoy (as Peter's brother, who bets against Peter in his matches). I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Peter and Dieter, it comes off with such effortless warmth. Tennis bedrocks such as Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Mary Carillo, and John Barrett (the voice of English tennis) give their seal of approval by being in the movie as themselves. This opens up several funny moments with Johnny Mac poking fun of his (in)famous personality. The film crew received permission to shoot scenes on Wimbledon grounds, this lending the picture another layer of authenticity.Who wins Wimbledon? Who loses? Does Peter end up being an unhappy tennis director at a posh health club? Will Lizzie manage to curb her temper and refocus her drive? Does John McEnroe drop any F bombs?Look, just go see the movie.",5,"""Surprisingly zesty.""",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,4722,"['film', 'has-been', 'tennis', 'player', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'surprisingly', 'prominence', 'agent', 'line', 'up', 'new', 'Frito', 'Lay', 'potato', 'chip', 'endorse', 'called', 'Surprisingly', 'Zesty', 'as', 'good', 'label', 'when', 'trying', 'describe', 'film', 'WIMBLEDON', 'surprisingly', 'zesty', 'Tennis', 'states', 'fairly', 'popular', 'not', 'as', 'huge', 'big', 'three', 'sports', 'say', 'romantic', 'sports', 'film', 'manages', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'unexpected', 'triumph.Love', 'such', 'strange', 'racket', 'especially', 'when', 'strings', 'attached', 'sorry', 'WIMBLEDON', 'tells', 'what', 'when', 'British', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'very', 'last', 'legs', 'career', 'once', 'ranked', '11th', 'world', 'now', '119th', 'young', 'fiery', 'American', 'Lizzie', 'Bradbury', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Wimbledon', 'tournament', 'most', 'hallowed', 'grand', 'slams', 'Sparks', 'go', 'up', 'Peter', 'Lizzie', 'venture', 'mutually', 'agreed', 'carefree', 'romance.Peter', 'having', 'earned', 'wild', 'card', 'berth', 'tournament', 'having', 'already', 'decided', 'retire', 'immediately', 'afterwards', 'game', 'suddenly', 'elevated', 'athletes', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'superstitious', 'unexpected', 'success', 'fling', 'Lizzie', 'far', 'spent', 'eve', 'Wimbledon', 'matches', 'winning', 'pressure', 'maintain', 'romantic', 'routine', 'even', 'seriously', 'fall', 'Lizzie', 'other', 'hand', 'Lizzie', 'losing', 'game', 'face', 'focus', 'seriously', 'fall', 'Peter.So', 'carefree', 'romance', 'happen', 'dig', 'tennis', 'date', 'back', 'Sampras', 'Agassi', 'Graf', 'Hingis', 'when', 'was', 'top', 'world', 'even', 'far', 'back', 'man', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'most', 'folks', 'know', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'tennis', 'However', 'regarding', 'WIMBLEDON', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'sport', 'get', 'story', 'tennis', 'made', 'accessible', 'play', 'court', 'grippingly', 'presented', 'actually', 'get', 'matches', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'slim', 'athletic', 'build', 'convincingly', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'did', 'plenty', 'stunts', 'even', 'lot', 'times', 'tennis', 'ball', 'had', 'be', 'inserted', 'graphically', 'One', 'only', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'had', 'been', 'court', 'more', ""n't"", 'as', 'convincing', 'Bettany', 'tennis', 'court', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Paul', 'Bettany', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'rollickingA', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Geoffrey', 'Chaucer', 'mediocreFirewall', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'where', 'lead', 'villain', 'actually', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'first', 'time', 'romantic', 'lead', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'how', 'easily', 'shouldered', 'role', 'Guy', 'simply', 'casual', 'charisma', 'Brit', 'gents', 'must', 'attend', 'How', 'Be', 'Disarming', 'Urbane', '101', 'course', 'rootability', 'enhanced', 'film', 'use', 'radiohead', 'device', 'audience', 'allowed', 'listen', 'Peter', 'turmoiled', 'neurotic', 'thoughts', 'matches', 'fun', 'listening', 'mind', 'state', 'scale', 'increasingly', 'frantic', 'heights', 'deeper', 'Peter', 'Colt', 'such', 'warm', 'wry', 'engaging', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pull', 'underdog', 'court.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', ""'ve"", 'been', 'crushing', 'while', 'now', ""'ll"", 'just', 'end', 'up', 'gushing', 'numbnut', 'listen', 'romance', 'frothy', 'light', 'easy', 'swallow', 'buoyed', 'Bettany', 'Dunst', 'sparkling', 'chemistry', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'tennis', 'play', 'love', 'story', 'want', 'stick', 'around', 'Not', 'mention', 'WIMBLEDON', 'pretty', 'funny', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'Peter', 'matches', 'involving', 'sheepish', 'Jon', 'Favreau.The', 'leads', 'are', 'ably', 'supported', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Lizzie', 'stern', 'pops', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Peter', 'dubiously', 'sly', 'agent', 'Nicolaj', 'Coster', 'Waldau', 'Peter', 'German', 'friend', 'practice', 'partner', 'fresh-faced', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Peter', 'brother', 'who', 'Peter', 'matches', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Dieter', 'off', 'such', 'effortless', 'warmth', 'Tennis', 'bedrocks', 'such', 'Chris', 'Evert', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'Mary', 'Carillo', 'John', 'Barrett', 'voice', 'English', 'tennis', 'give', 'seal', 'approval', 'being', 'movie', 'up', 'several', 'funny', 'moments', 'Johnny', 'Mac', 'poking', 'fun', 'famous', 'personality', 'film', 'crew', 'received', 'permission', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'Wimbledon', 'grounds', 'lending', 'picture', 'layer', 'authenticity.Who', 'wins', 'Wimbledon', 'Who', 'Does', 'Peter', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'unhappy', 'tennis', 'director', 'posh', 'health', 'club', 'Will', 'Lizzie', 'manage', 'curb', 'temper', 'refocus', 'drive', 'Does', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'drop', 'F', 'bombs', 'Look', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'movie']",Wimbledon

864481,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006A9FJ6,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""Wimbledon"" was a delight for me.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst.  Bettany who was in ""A Knight's Tale"" & ""A Beautiful Mind"" as well some English films ""Gangster No. 1,"" ""Dead Babies"" & ""Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)"" has good screen magnetism with his blond hair/blue eye looks and a the self-assuming character of Peter Holt for whom modesty was a way of life.  Dunst, who it will be interesting to see in Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" this year, does a good job as the driven tennis professional Lizzie Bradbury who has a lack of tolerance for movers & shakers but connects with Peter Holt.  Sam Neill as Lizzie's dad isn't called upon for a lot, but delivers with believability.  Eleanor Bron does a nice cameo as Peter Holt's mom who falls back in love with his dad during the flick, kind of a foil character romance.  She appeared in the Beatles' ""Help"" film back in the 60s and more recently in ""Iris.""  The special features on the DVD are also interesting.  As I watched the film, I didn't have an inkling of all the efforts that went into the excellent tennis sequences, actors hitting at air with tennis balls being computer generated.  It looked fantastic on screen.  The movie builds nicely to the climax as Holt seeks Bradbury among the cheering crowd.  I thoroughly enjoyed this romantic little gem.
