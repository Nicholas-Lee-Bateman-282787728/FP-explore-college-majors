1296043,A2WD3M51OL9W19,B002VRNJFS,Russell M. Ogg,"[31, 32]",The first of the 3 segments on this DVD I had previously viewed on TV. The 2nd and 3rd segment covered the informant that ratted on the Hells Angels during the Rock Machine/ HA war in Canada. The quality of the re-enactments and the depth of the reporting is very good. As usual the opinions of the producers is slanted towards making the police look as heroic as possible. If you like these documentary style programs then this is a good one to watch.,3,Outlaw Bikers,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,452,"['first', '3', 'segments', 'DVD', 'had', 'previously', 'viewed', 'TV', '2nd', '3rd', 'segment', 'covered', 'informant', 'ratted', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'Rock', 'Machine/', 'HA', 'war', 'Canada', 'quality', 're-enactments', 'depth', 'reporting', 'very', 'good', 'usual', 'opinions', 'producers', 'slanted', 'towards', 'making', 'police', 'look', 'as', 'heroic', 'possible', 'documentary', 'style', 'programs', 'then', 'good', 'one', 'watch']",Outlaw Bikers: Raise Some Hell
