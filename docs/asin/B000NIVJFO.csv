Grasping the lives of eight prep school boys, we discover what makes a successful Oxford or Cambridge applicant and are able to ponder why education is important in anyone's life. The boy aspirants couldn't be more different. When they put their heads together, they're stunning. All seem so affable to one another and chime in like solo parts to a Greek chorus.The real debate comes over education. Enter test expert Mr. Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) whose tart, acerbic leadership would make him a fine host for The Weakest Link. In contrast there's the prep school teacher, Mr. Hector (Richard Griffiths) who is a living celebration of literature. (""All literature is consolation,"" he wisely says.) He has them enact drama scenes and recite poetry with passion. His great Achilles heel, however, is having a propensity to touch his male students, revealing a dark side to the education system and tarnishing his educational touch.Much of the rest of the faculty offer a different venue, especially Mrs. Linott (Frances de la Tour) who has the necessary sobriety to tell Mr. Hector his actions are ""not The Annunciation,"" and the students that history is ""Masculine ineptitude."" Even the headmaster (Clive Merriweather) is complicit for a situation that needs some reigning in.

What did not work for me was the new teacher, who was sooo unbearable and superior that you knew he had to be a liar about his credentials, and yet as smart as he is supposed to be, gets lured into a 'date' by the lad everyone adores.I was also sad that Richard Griffiths got sidelined in the movie, not just the play, because the boor is so omnipresent with his smug yet deer in the headlamps look that he was distracting!The French lesson at the start was priceless. The boys together were great. It was only when they got split off for more in-depth analysis we sort of lost them, ironically.The end is sad, but what else can you do!? The headmaster was appropriately awful generally, but in this day and age, I am afraid that all the teacher's actions given the situation did not ring true. Compare Notes on a Scandal, for example, there it is an older woman, younger man, but still, major explosions, not oh well, he was being appreciative.Alan Bennett has some cracking lines, but they are from the arrogant lad-great job Dominic Cooper--whom we don't like, the sad old plump teacher, and the gay chap pining for love from either one of them!

1056945,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B000NIVJFO,A. Hickman,"[10, 12]","Having somehow missed the play by Alan (""The Madness of King George"") Bennett when it was reaping awards in both London and New York, I was unprepared for the richness of the film version of ""The History Boys,"" which manages to say something profound about literature, sex, adolescence, and, of course, history.  The story concerns a group of eight over-achieving grammar-school students in Thatcher's England who hope to be admitted to Oxbridge.  The scene in which Hector (brilliantly played by Richard Griffiths, of ""Withnail and I,"" who was criminally overlooked at this year's Academy Awards) explicates Thomas Hardy's poem ""Drummer Hodge""--about the transiency of youth in a time of war--for young Posner (Samuel Barnett), a gay boy in love with Dakin, the class Romeo, is alone worth the price of admission.  At the same time that the scene speaks volumes about the romantic ideals and disappointments of both teacher and pupil, it is a set-piece that may be appreciated without reference to the remainder of the film.There are many such moments, and performances, in a film whose cast first performed their roles on stage at the National Theatre in London in 2004.  Some viewers might have trouble with the fact that some of the ""boys"" look (and often are) older than the actor (Stephen Campbell Moore) who plays Irwin, their pragmatic university coach, who is, like Prosner, surprised into romance by the charismatic Davin (Dominic Cooper).  The latter ""boy,"" though basically heterosexual, is not adverse to experimentation.  [That the film tends to take a rather myopic view of homosexuality as pederasty will probably keep it from being seen by mainstream audiences.]Despite its flaws, however, ""The History Boys"" manages to say some important things about young boys and their choices in the modern world (the female slant is relegated to a few barbs from Mrs. Lintott, played by the always reliable Frances de la Tour).  Rudge, for instance, would rather be playing rugby than attending university, although as a ""legacy"" (his father was a servant at Oxford) he is a shoo-in for admission.  It is Rudge (Russell Tovey) who defines history as ""one f---ing thing after another.""  Ultimately, it is Alan Bennett's own definition of history as ""subjunctive"" (i.e., a product of wish-fulfillment) that leads him to revisit the days of childhood ""innocence.""  Perhaps, in memory, he is somewhat blinkered to the potential for tragedy that is inherent in child abuse, even when the abuser is as likeable as Griffith's Hector.  [Indeed, the boys are so sophisticated (some might say jaded) that they willingly take turns allowing themselves to be groped by Hector when riding tandem on his motorcycle.]  But the film itself triumphs over such flaws, especially in its audacity for milking entertainment out of poetry and for not stooping to apologize, or condescend, to its audience.",4,Subjunctive History,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2889,"['Having', 'somehow', 'missed', 'play', 'Alan', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'Bennett', 'when', 'was', 'reaping', 'awards', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'unprepared', 'richness', 'film', 'version', 'History', 'Boys', 'say', 'something', 'profound', 'literature', 'sex', 'adolescence', 'course', 'history', 'story', 'group', 'eight', 'over-achieving', 'grammar-school', 'students', 'Thatcher', 'England', 'who', 'hope', 'be', 'admitted', 'Oxbridge', 'scene', 'Hector', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Withnail', 'who', 'was', 'criminally', 'overlooked', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'poem', 'Drummer', 'Hodge', 'transiency', 'youth', 'time', 'war', 'young', 'Posner', 'Samuel', 'Barnett', 'gay', 'boy', 'love', 'Dakin', 'class', 'Romeo', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'same', 'time', 'scene', 'volumes', 'romantic', 'ideals', 'disappointments', 'teacher', 'pupil', 'set-piece', 'may', 'be', 'appreciated', 'reference', 'remainder', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'moments', 'performances', 'film', 'cast', 'first', 'performed', 'roles', 'stage', 'National', 'Theatre', 'London', '2004', 'viewers', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'fact', 'boys', 'look', 'often', 'are', 'older', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'who', 'Irwin', 'pragmatic', 'university', 'coach', 'who', 'Prosner', 'surprised', 'romance', 'charismatic', 'Davin', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'latter', 'boy', 'basically', 'heterosexual', 'not', 'adverse', 'experimentation', 'film', 'take', 'rather', 'myopic', 'view', 'homosexuality', 'pederasty', 'will', 'probably', 'keep', 'being', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'audiences', ']', 'flaws', 'however', 'History', 'Boys', 'say', 'important', 'things', 'young', 'boys', 'choices', 'modern', 'world', 'female', 'slant', 'relegated', 'few', 'barbs', 'Mrs.', 'Lintott', 'played', 'always', 'reliable', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Rudge', 'instance', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'playing', 'rugby', 'attending', 'university', 'legacy', 'father', 'was', 'servant', 'Oxford', 'shoo-in', 'admission', 'Rudge', 'Russell', 'Tovey', 'who', 'history', 'one', 'f', '-ing', 'thing', 'Ultimately', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'own', 'definition', 'history', 'subjunctive', 'i.e.', 'product', 'wish-fulfillment', 'revisit', 'days', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'Perhaps', 'memory', 'somewhat', 'blinkered', 'potential', 'tragedy', 'inherent', 'child', 'abuse', 'even', 'when', 'abuser', 'as', 'likeable', 'Griffith', 'Hector', '[', 'Indeed', 'boys', 'are', 'so', 'sophisticated', 'might', 'say', 'jaded', 'willingly', 'take', 'turns', 'allowing', 'be', 'groped', 'Hector', 'when', 'riding', 'tandem', 'motorcycle', ']', 'film', 'triumphs', 'such', 'flaws', 'especially', 'audacity', 'milking', 'entertainment', 'poetry', 'not', 'stooping', 'apologize', 'condescend', 'audience']",N/A

The dialogue is crisp and insightful, the plot layered and intelligent and the acting superb throughout. The seven young males portraying a high school class of advanced students preparing for their Oxford University interviews constitute a perfect blend of both similar and diverse lifestyles and socio/religious belief systems. Their performances are further enhanced by amazing performances by Richard Griffiths (Hector), Stephen Campbell Moore (Irwin) and Frances de la Tour (Mrs. Lintott) as the three history teachers preparing them for their upcoming college reviews.As the all important day draws closer the young men are not only challenged in the classroom but within themselves to discover what history is and the part they play in its continuation. They begin to understand that history consists of not only events of the past but is part of the everyday fabric of random events in which they live. It is something to be embraced, lived and passed on.`The History Boys' is a tremendous film filled with wit, wisdom and a wonderful soundtrack of upbeat tunes you already know and love.

1056948,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B000NIVJFO,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[2, 3]","I recently acquired 3 new films, including the History Boys.  This was the last of the 3 I chose to view, and it is clear I saved the best for last.  I was expected a good movie - but instead I got an excellent movie.Set in 1983, the film follows the plight of 8 students studying history in an effort to get accepted into Oxford.  But what makes the film stand out is the storyline and depth of several characters.  For me, that included Hector, their teacher, and Posner, the young student - who somewhat early in the film declares he may be homosexual.  His plight plays out throughout the film.  Generations apart, I found the story's of Hector and Posner almost identical in nature.  In many respects, this was a very sad story, but it rarely left the viewer feeling sad, or feeling sorry for the people.What should turn people off (a teacher having any type of sexual indiscretions with his students), is instead written, acted and directed so well, one can only feel compassion for the characters.  It is truly an amazing feat.The end result is a film about youth, about growing old, about the future, and about the past.  Rolled into well produced movie.  Midway through the movie, I knew this was a solid 4 stars in the famous Amazon rating system.  But the film closes in such a marvelous, yet unexpected way that I could see no reason not to give it 5 stars.  At a few points, the film drags a little slow; but considering recent films that scrap too much film to the cutting room floor, this was was near perfect in length.Well worth your 112 minutes.

1056949,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000NIVJFO,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 12]","For five years I chased after a college degree in history and never once did I come across conversations and debates as interesting as the ones found in ""The History Boys."" That fact is both a curse and a virtue for this very British, very charming film. One on hand we are treated to intelligent people speaking intelligently about history. On the other hand we have to endure them peddling this myth that out there, somewhere, there is a classroom where students care, teachers care, and stimulating debate thrives. I'm going to let me positive feelings win out and recommend this film, for we do go to the pictures to live in a land of make believe, and this is make believe, make no mistake.At the heart of this film we have a debate over the role of education. In one corner stands Hector (Richard Griffiths) who is standing up for knowledge for the sake of knowledge. To him being happy is king and he has no use for the stuffy pretensions of scholars or the clinical manipulation that is enacted to get kids into the great schools of England. In the other corner stands Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) who is brought in specifically to work those manipulations. His ideas are more contemporary and possibly more relevant. But it is also those ideas that have transformed universities into corrupt, money making corporations that have no responsibility to their students. Writer Alan Bennett also touches upon the politics of sexual abuse. Hector does have a knack for reach arounds which does taint his good natured beef. A grope is a grope, as they say in the film, but there are no intentions of making it that easy on the viewing public. The brave soul who tattles on his is not one of his ""victims,"" but rather a nosy crossing guard. And the thought that this had been going on for decades without anybody knowing is absurd. The school, ever the opportunist, seizes the day to push him and his archaic methods out the door. Never mind if it kills the joy the learning, as long as they win the approval of Oxford who cares?The production value is of some concern as it looks as though it were shot in a day on a mediocre camcorder. But don't go for the visuals, go for the script, which is Bennett's adaptation of his Tony award winning play. At times it does lecture like one of my dusty old professors, and it is hard to pin down, philosophically speaking. But it does have a brain in its head, and since this is 2006 that means we should probably forgive it for most everything else. Griffith's acting is superb as he looks like a natural fit. He is helped out by his build which screams out ""Jolly old fat guy!"" Near the end the film plays dirty for no good reason and then launches into what happened to these kids after they left school. Most of them go on to live in mansions (thus enabling the myth that college education = mansion), but there is a reminder to do what you want. I found my happiness by swearing off my need for my college's approval and dropping out. You may think that I'm silly for giving up on the dream of the mansion, but I think you are silly for sacrificing your love of theater just to go sit in some silly stone building. ***1/4",3,A Different Take on the School Room Drama,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,3171,"['five', 'years', 'chased', 'college', 'degree', 'history', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'come', 'conversations', 'debates', 'as', 'interesting', 'ones', 'found', 'History', 'Boys', 'fact', 'curse', 'virtue', 'very', 'British', 'very', 'charming', 'film', 'One', 'hand', 'are', 'treated', 'intelligent', 'people', 'speaking', 'intelligently', 'history', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'endure', 'peddling', 'myth', 'there', 'somewhere', 'classroom', 'where', 'students', 'care', 'teachers', 'care', 'stimulating', 'debate', 'thrives', ""'m"", 'going', 'let', 'positive', 'feelings', 'win', 'out', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'go', 'pictures', 'live', 'land', 'make', 'believe', 'make', 'believe', 'make', 'mistake.At', 'heart', 'film', 'have', 'debate', 'role', 'education', 'one', 'corner', 'Hector', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'standing', 'up', 'knowledge', 'sake', 'knowledge', 'being', 'happy', 'king', 'use', 'stuffy', 'pretensions', 'scholars', 'clinical', 'manipulation', 'enacted', 'get', 'kids', 'great', 'schools', 'England', 'other', 'corner', 'stands', 'Irwin', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'who', 'brought', 'specifically', 'work', 'manipulations', 'ideas', 'are', 'more', 'contemporary', 'possibly', 'more', 'relevant', 'also', 'ideas', 'have', 'transformed', 'universities', 'corrupt', 'money', 'making', 'corporations', 'have', 'responsibility', 'students', 'Writer', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'also', 'politics', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Hector', 'have', 'knack', 'reach', 'arounds', 'taint', 'good', 'natured', 'beef', 'grope', 'grope', 'say', 'film', 'are', 'intentions', 'making', 'viewing', 'public', 'brave', 'soul', 'who', 'not', 'one', 'victims', 'rather', 'nosy', 'crossing', 'guard', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'decades', 'anybody', 'knowing', 'absurd', 'school', 'ever', 'opportunist', 'day', 'push', 'archaic', 'methods', 'out', 'door', 'Never', 'mind', 'joy', 'learning', 'as', 'long', 'win', 'approval', 'Oxford', 'who', 'production', 'value', 'concern', 'were', 'shot', 'day', 'mediocre', 'camcorder', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'visuals', 'go', 'script', 'Bennett', 'adaptation', 'Tony', 'award', 'winning', 'play', 'times', 'lecture', 'one', 'dusty', 'old', 'professors', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'philosophically', 'speaking', 'have', 'brain', 'head', '2006', 'should', 'probably', 'forgive', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'Griffith', 'acting', 'superb', 'natural', 'fit', 'helped', 'out', 'build', 'out', 'Jolly', 'old', 'fat', 'guy', 'end', 'film', 'dirty', 'good', 'reason', 'then', 'what', 'happened', 'kids', 'left', 'school', 'Most', 'go', 'live', 'mansions', 'thus', 'enabling', 'myth', 'college', 'education', '=', 'mansion', 'reminder', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'found', 'happiness', 'swearing', 'off', 'need', 'college', 'approval', 'dropping', 'out', 'may', 'think', ""'m"", 'silly', 'giving', 'up', 'dream', 'mansion', 'think', 'are', 'silly', 'sacrificing', 'love', 'theater', 'just', 'go', 'sit', 'silly', 'stone', 'building', '***1/4']",N/A

There were about 3 mins., late in the film, that made me somewhat uncomfortable (they deal with a planned sexual relationship between a student and a teacher), but otherwise I loved it. The script is amazingly witty and wise, and the acting is first rate throughout! One very funny scene is in French, and I was surprised to discover how much I remember from 3 courses I had long, long, LONG ago. (Using the DVD's subtitles, which show the French words, helped me quite a bit.)Basically the film shows eight first-rate students at a British ""high school"" getting ready to take an entrance exam for Oxford, with three teachers prepping them--plus an administrator whose personality is often like 10 fingernails in search of a chalkboard. At the end, after we get the results of their exam, we are briefly told what becomes of the eight students in later life.The extras on the DVD include a commentary track for the whole film, a short behind-the-scenes video about making the film, and some so-so home movies of the the actors' world tour with the stage play from London to Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, and finally Broadway in New York City, where they were awarded a Tony (the cast of the movie were all in the play).",5,THE MOST ENJOYABLE FILM I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR!,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,1291,"['HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'were', '3', 'mins.', 'late', 'film', 'made', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'deal', 'planned', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'student', 'teacher', 'otherwise', 'loved', 'script', 'amazingly', 'witty', 'wise', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'One', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'French', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'remember', '3', 'courses', 'had', 'long', 'long', 'LONG', 'ago', 'Using', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'show', 'French', 'words', 'helped', 'quite', 'bit', 'Basically', 'film', 'shows', 'eight', 'first-rate', 'students', 'British', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'ready', 'take', 'entrance', 'exam', 'Oxford', 'three', 'teachers', 'prepping', 'administrator', 'personality', 'often', 'like', '10', 'fingernails', 'search', 'chalkboard', 'end', 'get', 'results', 'exam', 'are', 'briefly', 'told', 'what', 'eight', 'students', 'later', 'life.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'whole', 'film', 'short', 'behind-the-scenes', 'video', 'making', 'film', 'so-so', 'home', 'movies', 'actors', 'world', 'tour', 'stage', 'play', 'London', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Australia', 'finally', 'Broadway', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'were', 'awarded', 'Tony', 'cast', 'movie', 'were', 'play']",N/A

1056954,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B000NIVJFO,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","Set in the early Eighties, THE HISTORY BOYS looks at the fate of a group of boys preparing for the Oxbridge examination in a context where they are forced into succeeding.  Felix, the head teacher (Clive Merrison) is so obsessed with the need for success that he engaged part-time history teacher Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) to work with his boys, even if that means eroding some of the teaching time normally occupied by maverick Hector (Richard Griffiths).  Based on a Royal National Theatre success, Alan Bennett's screenplay looks at what &#34;education&#34; actually means; does it actually consist simply of learning information so as to pass exams, or is it a process of lifelong learning?  Hector certainly embraces the latter cause, but his ideas are not necessarily embraced by the boys, especially ambitious go-getter Dakin (Dominic Cooper).  The screenplay also looks at the subject of homosexuality in schools, memorably addressed in Eighties films such as ANOTHER COUNTRY (1982).  In THE HISTORY BOYS Bennett takes a sympathetic view: many teachers - including Hector and Irwin - are often frustrated by the need to sustain a respectable facade, even if that means repressing their sexual instincts.  This repression often leads to the breaking of taboos - for example, abusing the boys.  On the other hand the boys themselves are equally repressed, partly by an educational culture that imposes certain ideals of masculinity on them (to be 'successful' you must also be good with women), and partly by the belief that homosexuality is a disease.  Posner (Samuel Barnett), the smallest of the scholarship boys, experiences this conflict most acutely.  In the end the film calls for a more liberal point of view: while moral standards should be sustained, perhaps educational cultures could be more accommodating towards those - learners and educators alike - who desire to be different.",4,Clear-Eyed Analysis of Tensions within a British Grammar School,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1903,"['Set', 'early', 'Eighties', 'THE', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'fate', 'group', 'boys', 'preparing', 'Oxbridge', 'examination', 'context', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'succeeding', 'Felix', 'head', 'teacher', 'Clive', 'Merrison', 'so', 'obsessed', 'need', 'success', 'engaged', 'part-time', 'history', 'teacher', 'Irwin', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'work', 'boys', 'even', 'eroding', 'teaching', 'time', 'normally', 'occupied', 'maverick', 'Hector', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Based', 'Royal', 'National', 'Theatre', 'success', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'screenplay', 'what', '34', 'education', '34', 'actually', 'actually', 'consist', 'simply', 'learning', 'information', 'so', 'pass', 'exams', 'process', 'lifelong', 'learning', 'Hector', 'certainly', 'latter', 'cause', 'ideas', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'embraced', 'boys', 'especially', 'ambitious', 'go-getter', 'Dakin', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'screenplay', 'also', 'subject', 'homosexuality', 'schools', 'memorably', 'addressed', 'Eighties', 'films', 'such', 'ANOTHER', 'COUNTRY', '1982', 'THE', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'Bennett', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'many', 'teachers', 'including', 'Hector', 'Irwin', 'are', 'often', 'frustrated', 'need', 'sustain', 'respectable', 'facade', 'even', 'repressing', 'sexual', 'instincts', 'repression', 'often', 'breaking', 'taboos', 'example', 'abusing', 'boys', 'other', 'hand', 'boys', 'are', 'equally', 'repressed', 'partly', 'educational', 'culture', 'certain', 'ideals', 'masculinity', 'be', ""'successful"", 'must', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'women', 'partly', 'belief', 'homosexuality', 'disease', 'Posner', 'Samuel', 'Barnett', 'smallest', 'scholarship', 'conflict', 'most', 'acutely', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'liberal', 'point', 'view', 'moral', 'standards', 'should', 'be', 'sustained', 'perhaps', 'educational', 'cultures', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'accommodating', 'towards', 'learners', 'educators', 'alike', 'who', 'desire', 'be', 'different']",N/A
1056955,AY1HVIM2V067E,B000NIVJFO,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[6, 8]","This tightly crafted and brilliant film would be, and probably is, an excellent introduction to modern British drama in college-preparatory American schools from Grade 9 because it's about a topic many students can relate to.The problem, as some of the negative reviews at this site make clear, is that America is in a serious moral panic, and is using ""zero tolerance"" of even venial and de minimis conduct such as Hector's with a signal lack of success to prevent much more serious and widespread problem of physical and sexual abuse within nuclear families, a problem most prevalant in America's most Fundamentalist, and zero-tolerant, regions.Not to mention (oh, what the hell) the fact that Americans can seriously entertain, and get their rocks off about, their own government torturing people.Which should tell us something.My experience: the teacher should say to boys especially, who are mature enough, something like:""Right you lot, there are some 'gay' issues raised in this film, but it's about academic success in a competitive world during a time when you are looking for an identity and under considerable stress in your studies. These issues, men, are a sideline and not as important as being loyal and kind to your friends and magnaminous to your enemies, who you shall overcome if your cause is just, and you fight the good fight"".""Furthermore, you lot, this movie resolves the tension between preparing for tests and actually learning a bloody thing or two for love of the game, by showing you that the best way to pass the test is NOT to cheat, or swot the night before, but to try to understand and love literature, art, and the rest of that girl stuff the best you can. Or else play golf as best you can and have a father who was a college servant.""""For one thing, your knowledge will impress the ladies no end if that is your desire, as it normally, but not universally, is. Right? Right.""This, especially when delivered brisk and in sergeant-major style (whether in the style of the USMC or in the style of Horse Guards as above) will short-circuit most of the sniggers and guffaws. My own high school English teacher assigned ""Linda's"" role in Death of a Salesman to a boy in an all boys school, told him and the rest of the class that that was that, and to start reading the play out loud.Harry Truman was essentially right. Old Give-em-hell Harry said that boys don't need ladies and failures as teachers, but male role models. The problem is that these male role models need to be after all multicultural, tolerant of gays, and all the rest of that New Model stuff, but social mechanisms make such language almost (but not quite) unusable because it's so precisely unheard.We survived Pete Dunderdale's gender neutral casting of Death of a Salesman (at St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois, in 1966) and we fell under the spell of the great Arthur Miller. The theater in our class worked its ancient rough magic: there was a respite from the constant teasing and bullying in the class, a respite that comes from the compassion that flows in turn from Aristotle's ""pity and terror"".Once the ""gay"" issues are put into proper perspective, students can watch this film as a dialectic between ""Hectoring"" (learning gobbets for their own sake) and ""Ir-winning"" (learning test taking strategies) to realize that the two approaches fit together as Yin, and Yang; without Hector's passion for subject matter, or Irwin's gamesmanship, the students won't succeed. Class discussions can focus on questions such as ""is there any such thing as useless knowledge?"", ""is Mr. Hector a bad man, or a man who did a bad thing?"", or, in certain Borstals, on ""is Mr Hector a ponce or not?""The foaming at the mouth in Amazon reviews such as the one above, in which the author sets his face against ""altruistic posers"" (?), is in fact the subject matter of the film. It ain't called ""liberal"" education for nothing, lads, and if any of you lot have a problem with that, if any of you lot would destroy what's left of the sweetness of life, or the ability to forgive a good man who's done a bad thing, then you don't belong in a ""liberal"" education, and would do better at the technical Borstal learning a useful trade, such as gun-smithing or horse-shoeing.I'm quite serious. Bennett's film is an implicit protest against the Thatcherism that was breaking out at the time of the film, and a sociological phenomenon common today, which the ruralization of the cities: the careful structuring of white-collar work so as to admit at least a subset of men and boys whose fathers had industrial work, but who have no serious prospect of ever proving their manhood at a coal face.At least, not until very recently: British coal faces have been re-opening owing to the price of oil, giving the lie to Thatcher's policies. However, a generation has as a result of the Mad Woman serious problems in being men and is aging without even a holiday the Isle of Man.It appears that these Yobs, although dressed in the latest City fashions, make it their business to riot at football games, to prove their absent masculinity, and of course they hound queers in a way that the History Boys, in their early 1980s urbanity, a lost urbanity, would find Wilkesian and therefore amusing (""is it joined-up writing, sir?""). Ir-winnism by itself is the forced march these Yobs endure to essentially display the mere shadow educational attainment and it makes nonsense of education, and has made nonsense of their lives.Bennett, as in The Madness of King George, is Shakespearean because both British playwrights work through the tragic equation to get to a green world of compassion and forgiveness; a world under systematic attack today. Shakespeare found a way out of Renaissance mayhem. King George forgets ""America"" and realizes what a lucky man he is, especially in comparision to his rotter of a son. The boys forgive Hector's transgression by way of realizing a much larger corruption as does Isabella in Measure for Measure: the fact that the Headmaster is sexually exploiting Fiona, and ruining her in such a way that she will be a sex object and a secretary all her days. And, of course, in Miller, nobody dast blame Willy Loman.Silence is death. Oh, is this a ""gay"" saying? Goodness gracious me. The fact remains that sex is only a part of life, that people have the right to sexual identity when they don't harm others, and that what matters in life is pretty much what Mr. Hector says and not what Irwin merely pretends to say: the truth: yup, silence is death although ""'tis as easy as lying"" (as Hamlet says about playing the recorder to the corrupted Rosencrantz...or perhaps, Guildenstern...oh dear).Five stars.

I didn't read any reviews, and I expected this movie to be more like ""Dead Poets' Society,"" or perhaps ""School Ties,"" which wasn't the movie's fault, but still. It is about a group of plucky working class lads who are in their last year of grammar school in England in the early eighties. Acceptance at Oxford or Cambridge is their chance to make something of themselves. They are aided in their quest by two very different teachers. Of course, as is a given in these kinds of movies, they learn Life Lessons, not just lessons from their texts. Nobody stands on their desks, but there is a charming scene where they act out a scene in French - and several have a tendency to sing. The French speaking scene goes on for quite awhile, sans subtitles, so it may be helpful to have a translator during it. You can get the gist without it, but it's probably funnier when you know exactly what's being said.In this day and age, a teacher taking sexual advantage of his students would be treated much differently than it is in ""History Boys.""

1056957,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,B000NIVJFO,Found Highways,"[4, 8]","I don't know if Alan Bennett thinks it's impossible to be gay and happy or it's impossible for anyone to be happy. This movie (while it does have witty dialogue and an interesting story) is full of the ""sad homosexual"" character from another era - - in movies like The Children's Hour, The Detective, Advise & Consent.It's believable that Hector (in his fifties or sixties in the 1980s, when this movie takes place) would have made a loveless marriage long ago and now gropes seventeen-year-olds on his motorbike, but Irwin, the new teacher just out of university, can find lots of gay adult men. It's England in the eighties! Ever hear of Boy George? Elton John? The Notting Hill parades every year? Gay clubs? Personal ads?Irwin doesn't need Hector's speech about ""innoculating"" himself against the torment of falling in love with the boys. Not to mention, this perpetuates the idea that grown gay men want boys. (One of the episodes of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries dealt with a gay teacher in a much more believable way.)The last scene, which brings the boys' lives up to date (presumably to around the year 2000), is even more annoying. One of the boys (also gay) has become a teacher himself. He is apparently unmarried (to anyone of either sex) and has inherited Hector's aura of tragic self-pity along with his erudtion.It may have been a mistake for Alan Bennett to write a story that must have been inspired by his own school experience, but setting it decades later.The soundtrack uses eighties music, but not the original versions of the songs. A Muzak version of The Clash - - what's the point? The movie Billy Elliot used period music much better. (Now that I think aboout it, Billy Elliot dealt with several of the same themes - - getting out of an impoverished environment, appreciating art for its own sake, and dealing with someone else's love when you can't return it in the same way.)Another quibble: a couple of the actors might have been able to pass for ""boys"" on stage, but they were a little too old for the screen.

More importantly it is a story about their relationships to some rather eccentric teachers (a would be feminist, an eccentric, inclined to grope, teacher that wants the students to do more than ""just learn""  and a young teacher with a frustrating secret that thinks he has all of the answers to everything.

The writing by Alan Bennett closely adapted from his prize winning play that was on the boards of theaters around the globe before being captured for posterity on film is 'rich and strange' and so full of those values of achieving a true education that it serves not only the audience well but presents a gold standard for educators pondering how to transform their pupils into thinking, creative members of society.Very briefly, THE HISTORY BOYS are eight brilliant but 'crass' young men in Cutler's Grammar School, each coming from backgrounds not considered 'quality' by the British class standards.  These boys are rowdy but committed to gaining admission to Oxford - a step toward erasing their class standing and proving their worth.  The headmaster (Clive Merrison), himself not too well educated, is bound to get these eight bright boys into the best schools and in that light he hires a new teacher Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) to buff the boys into a classy group who will be able to pass their essays and oral examinations.  The existing teachers are the testy, frank Mrs. Lintott (a fine Frances de la Tour) and the massively obese Hector (Richard Griffiths in a stunning performance) who teaches 'general studies', a time when he lovingly coaxes the boys to embrace poetry, music, sentimentality, drama, art, and in general everything that allows them to take the moment and live it fully.  The boys are torn between Irwin's pragmatic 'teach them how to take exams' approach Hector's teach them how to embrace intelligence and life.  Hector is known among the boys for fondling and the knowledge is accepted by the lads until Hector is seen fondling one of the boys on his motorbike and reported.  This opens all manner of avenues of introspection, one of the boys confides to Irwin that he is homosexual, another of the lads declares that Irwin is gay and attempts a physical liaison with him, and the permutations move an down the  line.  But the exams come and the joy of accomplishing goals puts a different twist on matters and the ending is a touching as any on film.The entire cast is the original group that started the play and in addition to the fine performances by the adults, the boys are extraordinarily fine: Dominic Cooper (Dakin), Jamie Parker (Scripps), Samuel Barnett (Posner), James Corden (Timms), Sacha Dhawan (Akhtar),  Samuel Anderson (Crowther), Russell Tovey (Rudge), and Andrew Knott (Lockwood). There is an obvious camaraderie among the actors that obviously grew from their long association with the roles.  But the most impressive performance is the polished veteran actor Richard Griffiths who has created a role that will long remain in everyone's heart long after the movie has passed playing.  For this viewer this is one of the very finest films of the past year!  Highly Recommended.

In the tradition of ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" and ""Dead Poets Society"" it is about eight precocious boys on the cusp of manhood eager to get into Cambridge or Oxford. They are awaking to both learning and sex-- at least some of them-- with members of both sexes. Alan Bennett wrote the screenplay based on his brilliant award-winning play. He used all the actors from the stage production. It is difficult to imagine anyone else in these roles-- should the play be staged in your city-- particularly the eight fine young actors.There are wonderfully funny scenes in the film but underneath is a sense of sorrow or that the world is a serious, sometimes frightening place. The boys to a person are sympathetic although my favorites in no particular order are Dakin, Posner and Timms. Many of us have had at least one Hector from our school days, not necessarily one who groped his male students, but an eccentric who did everything unorthodox in the classroom and nothing by the book, thereby getting into trouble with pedantic deans or headmasters.As we would expect from the likes of Mr. Bennett, this film is chockfull of memorable lines. Who can forget Timms' description of Michelangelo as a nancy as evidenced in his sculptures of women since they are actually men with women's breasts--he uses the vernacular-- applied with an ice cream dipper? (Mr. Bennett has used this image before). Then there's Ms. Lintott on the ineptitude of men, causing history to consist of women ""following behind with the bucket."" Or Professor Hector reminding his students that there is no such thing as general studies. Or his description of learning something from someone else as ""if a hand has come out and taken you in."" And finally, ""take it, feel it and pass it on.""This is a movie you will want to see again and again.",5,One Of The Best Films of 2006,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,1892,"['History', 'Boys', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'one', 'will', 'endure', 'tradition', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'eight', 'precocious', 'boys', 'cusp', 'manhood', 'eager', 'get', 'Cambridge', 'Oxford', 'are', 'awaking', 'learning', 'sex', 'least', 'members', 'sexes', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'brilliant', 'award-winning', 'play', 'used', 'actors', 'stage', 'production', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'roles', 'should', 'play', 'be', 'staged', 'city', 'particularly', 'eight', 'fine', 'young', 'actors.There', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'underneath', 'sense', 'sorrow', 'world', 'serious', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'place', 'boys', 'person', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'favorites', 'particular', 'order', 'are', 'Dakin', 'Posner', 'Timms', 'Many', 'have', 'had', 'least', 'one', 'Hector', 'school', 'days', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'who', 'groped', 'male', 'students', 'eccentric', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'unorthodox', 'classroom', 'nothing', 'book', 'thereby', 'getting', 'trouble', 'pedantic', 'deans', 'headmasters.As', 'would', 'expect', 'likes', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'film', 'chockfull', 'memorable', 'lines', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Timms', 'description', 'Michelangelo', 'nancy', 'evidenced', 'sculptures', 'women', 'are', 'actually', 'men', 'women', 'breasts', 'vernacular', 'applied', 'ice', 'cream', 'dipper', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'used', 'image', 'before', 'Then', 'Ms.', 'Lintott', 'ineptitude', 'men', 'causing', 'history', 'consist', 'women', 'following', 'bucket', 'Professor', 'Hector', 'reminding', 'students', 'such', 'thing', 'general', 'studies', 'description', 'learning', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'hand', 'come', 'out', 'taken', 'finally', 'take', 'feel', 'pass', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",N/A

It was also hard to believe that the stud in the movie that was banging the headmaster's female secretary would relish the challenge of bedding down his male teacher as well.

1056964,A106016KSI0YQ,B000NIVJFO,Jay Dickson,"[5, 11]","A group of exceptionally bright grammar school boys in Sheffield are torn between conflicting approaches to their preparatory education for Oxbridge: on one hand, the ""tell-them-what they-want-to-hear"" model offered by the relatively young, pinched, repressed Erwin (Stephen Campbell Moore); on the other, by the capacious and truly engaged model espoused by wise, life-embracing Hector (Richard Griffiths). Guess who wins. Actually, one might even say that it turns out to be a false battle, because really the boys learn to embrace BOTH systems. The message of the film seems to be do what they ask you to do to get what you want (such as admission to an Oxford college), but remember all the same to smell the roses (or to enjoy the Hardy poems) along the way. What could be more cleanly efficient? The screenwriter, Alan Bennett, seems to make it seem all too easy and cold-blooded. There turn out to be no bad consequences ultimately for the boys' choices.This film is adapted by Bennett from his own much-honored play was filmed very quickly after opening in London and then on Broadway so as to retain the young cast. Even so, some of them seem quite a bit long in the tooth to be playing high school students, and it's hard to see what he really gained by keeping them since so often they lose their individuality and become instead an aggregate consciousness to contend with both Erwin and Hector (in these moments, they not only always agree with one another but finish each other's setences). The dialogue is extremely stagey and self-conscious: you see the ideas being worked out before you and the machinery of a well-constructed play clicking into place. As always with British plays about inspiring teachers, there's an evil headmaster figure seeking to bring the Miss Jean Brodie figure (here, Hector) down, and Clive Merrison unfortunately plays the part here with all too much cartoonish relish. The best reason to see this is for the three absolutely splendid performances by the boys' three teachers: Stephen Campbell Moore, the tremendous and very likeable Frances de la Tour, and especially Richard Griffiths. Built like an overripe pumpkin, Griffiths moves and speaks with joy and energy. You see exactly both why he would seem slightly ridiculous to the boys but would also have won their hearts forever.",3,The Prime of Mister Richard Griffiths,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,2328,"['group', 'exceptionally', 'bright', 'grammar', 'school', 'boys', 'Sheffield', 'are', 'torn', 'conflicting', 'approaches', 'preparatory', 'education', 'Oxbridge', 'one', 'hand', 'tell-them-what', 'they-want-to-hear', 'model', 'offered', 'relatively', 'young', 'pinched', 'repressed', 'Erwin', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'other', 'capacious', 'truly', 'engaged', 'model', 'espoused', 'wise', 'life-embracing', 'Hector', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Guess', 'who', 'Actually', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'out', 'be', 'false', 'battle', 'really', 'boys', 'learn', 'embrace', 'BOTH', 'systems', 'message', 'film', 'be', 'do', 'what', 'ask', 'do', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'such', 'admission', 'Oxford', 'college', 'remember', 'same', 'smell', 'roses', 'enjoy', 'Hardy', 'poems', 'way', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'cleanly', 'efficient', 'screenwriter', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'make', 'seem', 'too', 'easy', 'cold-blooded', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'consequences', 'ultimately', 'boys', 'choices.This', 'film', 'adapted', 'Bennett', 'own', 'much-honored', 'play', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'quickly', 'opening', 'London', 'then', 'Broadway', 'so', 'retain', 'young', 'cast', 'Even', 'so', 'seem', 'quite', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'gained', 'keeping', 'so', 'often', 'lose', 'individuality', 'become', 'instead', 'aggregate', 'consciousness', 'contend', 'Erwin', 'Hector', 'moments', 'not', 'only', 'always', 'agree', 'one', 'finish', 'other', 'setences', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'stagey', 'self-conscious', 'see', 'ideas', 'being', 'worked', 'out', 'machinery', 'well-constructed', 'play', 'clicking', 'place', 'always', 'British', 'plays', 'inspiring', 'teachers', 'evil', 'headmaster', 'figure', 'seeking', 'bring', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'figure', 'here', 'Hector', 'down', 'Clive', 'Merrison', 'unfortunately', 'part', 'here', 'too', 'much', 'cartoonish', 'relish', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'three', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'performances', 'boys', 'three', 'teachers', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'tremendous', 'very', 'likeable', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Built', 'overripe', 'pumpkin', 'Griffiths', 'joy', 'energy', 'see', 'exactly', 'why', 'would', 'seem', 'slightly', 'ridiculous', 'boys', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'won', 'hearts', 'forever']",N/A
1056965,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000NIVJFO,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 7]","I thought this movie was okay and could have been better even with its funny and touching scenes (brief encounter!). Set in Yorkshire, England in 1983, and centers around a handful of boys in their final year of high school. The boys represent a rather interesting and eclectic mix: there's one who's gay, another who loves sports more than school, and another who is the valedictorian but who acts more like the class bully. Nevertheless, they're all brilliant students who are particularly apt scholars of history and the French language. When news circulates that they have a chance at getting into Oxford and Cambridge, the headmaster (Clive Merrison) hires a young Oxford graduate (Stephen Campbell Moore) to temporarily teach the kids for the ""big test"" and make them more well rounded students and optimum choices for acceptance, all while intruding upon their favorite History teacher's (Richard Griffiths) class time.He's obese, challenging, and eccentric. He also rides a motorcycle and endlessly quotes great poetry. He firmly agrees with A.E. Houseman who wrote: ""All human knowledge is precious whether or not it serves the slightest human use."" If Hector were around today he might be on the endangered species list. But Hector also has a dark side. He seems to get a sexual charge out of taking students out for intimate rides on his motorcycle, and his inappropriate behavior eventually becomes an issue in the film. His job is to prepare some promising but uncouth students for Oxford. He uses creative teaching methods and actually encourages them to think for themselves.""The History Boys"" is also very hip to British pop culture, with numerous '80s rock songs throughout, and very intellectual, with poignant poetry found in nearly every scene. Those two points alone should give anyone a solid idea what to expect going in. There's even a metaphor about relationships and sex in relation to war in history. The focus of the film is purely on the linguists and dialogue in order to drive the story and does not call on any physical or visual imagery at all; this is great on stage, but ineffective on film. The film winds down by telling a lengthy story instead of ending when it should have. Although it gets into the lives of the students and teachers well, it is not as deeply gripping as a film like this should have been.This film does feature some incredible performances such as Rudge (Russell Tovey), who is the one with the most troubles and breaks the most bounds, also stands out the most. He's supported strongly by Posner (Samuel Barnett), an incredibly talented actor and singer who plays the homosexual boy, and Dakin (Dominic Cooper), who is the cigarette-smoking, sporty, attractive guy you don't want to mess with. The rest of the boisterous cast of students have amazing chemistry, but look like they are acting on stage and not for the camera.

A group of young guys have done well enough that now they can not only aspire to university, they are actually in the running for Oxford and Cambridge.  This is a rare event for this particular school, and extraordinary steps have to be taken.The candidates are put through an intensive extra study session with two history teachers.  One of the teachers is a veteran, the other young and newly recruited.  The training consists of debates, critical readings, and above all writing as the teachers push the candidates to new scholarship levels.  The boys themselves are determined to succeed, but they're also teenagers, with all the social, cultural, and sexual complications that involves.  And the two teachers themselves have their own issues, leading to some behavior which is morally and legally reprehensible.The Northern England accents can be a bit difficult for non-British viewers to follow, and the organization of the British educational system seems far more complex than necessary, but nevertheless I, a history teacher in an American high school, was able to recognize many common elements and traits, and to feel the same pride for these history boys that I do when my own students do well.

I think THE HISTORY BOYS will prove to be a non-starter with American audiences; it just won't resonate.Here, at an English public school in Sheffield, several boys score high enough on their finals that they qualify for application to the nation's two elite universities, Oxford and Cambridge. Now the school must prepare them for the written and oral exams administered by the two colleges. The job would otherwise belong to the boys' classics teacher, Hector (Richard Griffiths), an eccentric, rotund, elderly, jovial, scholarly man who commutes to and from the school on a motorcycle. However, the headmaster also brings in a young, glib ringer, Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore), whose mandate is to teach the students how to outfox the admissions system and give them a patina of flash with which to impress the college interviewers. The film is essentially about the competition between Hector and Irwin to get the lads' attention to their respective teaching styles and educational philosophies.THE HISTORY BOYS is a vastly intelligent film - a strike against it when considering the average, gum-chewing, American movie goer - filled with fine performances by the cast of the original stage production - all names you've probably never heard of. The themes of the film focus on education's purpose and methods - esoteric subjects for any audience - with an undercurrent of pederasty and homosexuality thrown in to make it less relevant for most. Despite the general excellence of the film, my wife and I looked at each other upon exiting and said ""Nah, it won't fly with mainstream America."" Its very narrow niche will be a smattering of art theaters in such places as Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. So, five stars for artistic merit morphs to three under the influence of two-star box office appeal.Perhaps the best part of the film for me was the day trip the boys and their two instructors made to Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire, a Cistercian priory founded in 1132 and destroyed by Henry VIII in 1539 during his Dissolution of the Monasteries. Fountains is arguably the loveliest pile of ruins in Britain, and seeing them again reminded me of the several delightful visits I made there in the 1970s and 1980s.",3,A non-starter for U.S. audiences,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,2436,"['came', 'away', 'preview', 'showing', 'THE', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'thought', 'back', 'films', 'teacher/student', 'relationship', 'previously', 'seen', 'U.S.', 'Big', 'Screens', 'e.g', 'favorite', 'Mr', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'think', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'non-starter', 'American', 'audiences', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'resonate.Here', 'English', 'public', 'school', 'Sheffield', 'several', 'boys', 'score', 'high', 'enough', 'finals', 'qualify', 'application', 'nation', 'two', 'elite', 'universities', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Now', 'school', 'must', 'prepare', 'written', 'oral', 'exams', 'administered', 'two', 'colleges', 'job', 'would', 'otherwise', 'belong', 'boys', 'classics', 'teacher', 'Hector', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'eccentric', 'rotund', 'elderly', 'jovial', 'scholarly', 'man', 'who', 'school', 'motorcycle', 'However', 'headmaster', 'also', 'young', 'glib', 'ringer', 'Irwin', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'mandate', 'teach', 'students', 'how', 'outfox', 'admissions', 'system', 'give', 'patina', 'flash', 'impress', 'college', 'interviewers', 'film', 'essentially', 'competition', 'Hector', 'Irwin', 'get', 'lads', 'attention', 'respective', 'teaching', 'styles', 'educational', 'philosophies.THE', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'vastly', 'intelligent', 'film', 'strike', 'when', 'considering', 'average', 'gum-chewing', 'American', 'movie', 'goer', 'filled', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'names', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'themes', 'film', 'focus', 'education', 'purpose', 'methods', 'esoteric', 'subjects', 'audience', 'undercurrent', 'pederasty', 'homosexuality', 'thrown', 'make', 'less', 'relevant', 'most', 'general', 'excellence', 'film', 'wife', 'looked', 'other', 'exiting', 'said', 'Nah', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fly', 'mainstream', 'America', 'very', 'narrow', 'niche', 'will', 'be', 'smattering', 'art', 'theaters', 'such', 'places', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'New', 'York', 'San', 'Francisco', 'So', 'five', 'stars', 'artistic', 'merit', 'morphs', 'three', 'influence', 'two-star', 'box', 'office', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'day', 'trip', 'boys', 'two', 'instructors', 'made', 'Fountains', 'Abbey', 'Yorkshire', 'Cistercian', 'priory', 'founded', '1132', 'destroyed', 'Henry', 'VIII', '1539', 'Dissolution', 'Monasteries', 'Fountains', 'arguably', 'loveliest', 'pile', 'ruins', 'Britain', 'seeing', 'again', 'reminded', 'several', 'delightful', 'visits', 'made', '1970s', '1980s']",N/A

It focuses on a class of young men who are trying to get into some of the finest British schools. I note this only because there are key differences between British and American schools as well as teaching methods and this may be confusing to some viewers.I would suggest focusing on the themes of this movie as you watch it, particularly various teaching styles, the role of history in education and, specifically, what a ""good education"" is. Among other things, the film grapples with issues ofwhat the students produce, both in their written work and in their classroom discussions. Should an original paper, which is full of cleverness but not much depth, be rewarded more than a solid paper which rehashes conventional wisdom? Those are the types of dilemnas that come up, among others.If this review hasn't led you to the conclusion that this movie is thought -provoking and geared to making one think about the role of education and styles of learning and teaching, I apologize - because that is what this film does.Having said that, I think this film suffers from not being presented live, on stage.Often film enhances a Broadway play but I didn't find that the case here. Some of the ""students"" seemed to be too old and a certain intensity and spontaneity was lost. I would strongly suggest getting a copy of the play in book form and doing a comparison. Better yet, see a live performance.Still, I think this is worth seeing on DVD, especially since it has extra commentary by Nicholas Hytner and Alan Bennett. There are a couple of featurettes about making the movie and the History Boys around the World.I can't give a top flight rating to this because it fell short of what I'd experienced of this play before....but it shows effort, is far above the typical fluff shown in theatres and is certainly timely, focusing on education and its role in one's entire life.

Talk about unrealistic.To wit:The dialogue between the students has no spontaneity, no natural flow; instead, it sounds like a bunch of snappy, overly witty, and obviously memorized lines from actors who've played these roles and acted these scenarios repetitiously to the point where the banter is now mechanically reflexive to them.It is totally unrealistic that only one teenage boy in the whole school shows an interest in females.It is totally unrealistic that the only teenage boy in the whole school who shows any interest in females also turns out to be homosexual.It is totally unrealistic that none of the teenage boys has any problem at all with their obese male teacher groping them.It is totally unrealistic that the teenage boys would get undressed in class and massage each other's legs and recite poetry to one another in lilting, stentorian voices.It is totally unrealistic that the only person in the entire movie who has a problem with teachers making sexual advances on their students is the Babbitt-like heterosexual principal.It is totally unrealistic (not to mention heterophobic!) that the only heterosexual man in the movie is a stereotypical Babbitt (albeit a British Babbitt).I could go on. You get the picture.Suffice to say that this entire movie is a male homosexual's fantasy--to wake up in class and find out that every other male around him is also homosexual and thus, sexually available to him. Wishfully hallucinatory this movie is; realistic it is not.Too bad. It does have an excellent music soundtrack of early 80s British classics, though (and of course they had to include the homosexually innuendoed ""This Charming Man"" by The Smiths from 1983--ah, yes, how fitting).",1,Bait and Switch,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2420,"['What', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'inspirational', 'education-related', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'billed', 'as', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'agenda-laden', 'film', 'preaching', 'ubiquitous', 'homosexuality', 'tolerance', 'towards', 'pederasty', 'misandric', 'feminism', 'wundtian', 'situational-ethics', 'factless', 'values-based', 'teaching', 'only', 'fitting', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'teachers', 'students', 'lie', 'exam', 'entire', 'movie', 'bait-and-switch', 'lie', 'movie', 'not', 'education', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'academic', 'setting', 'just', 'exiguous', 'vehicle', 'driving', 'homosexual', 'pederastic', 'message', 'here', 'Totally', 'other', 'unrealisms', 'Sheez', 'Talk', 'unrealistic.To', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'students', 'spontaneity', 'natural', 'flow', 'instead', 'bunch', 'snappy', 'overly', 'witty', 'obviously', 'memorized', 'lines', 'actors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'played', 'roles', 'acted', 'scenarios', 'repetitiously', 'point', 'where', 'banter', 'now', 'mechanically', 'reflexive', 'them.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'one', 'teenage', 'boy', 'whole', 'school', 'interest', 'females.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'teenage', 'boy', 'whole', 'school', 'who', 'interest', 'females', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'homosexual.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'none', 'teenage', 'problem', 'obese', 'male', 'teacher', 'groping', 'them.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'teenage', 'boys', 'would', 'get', 'undressed', 'class', 'massage', 'other', 'legs', 'recite', 'poetry', 'one', 'lilting', 'stentorian', 'voices.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'person', 'entire', 'movie', 'who', 'problem', 'teachers', 'making', 'sexual', 'advances', 'students', 'Babbitt-like', 'heterosexual', 'principal.It', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'mention', 'heterophobic', 'only', 'heterosexual', 'man', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'Babbitt', 'British', 'Babbitt', '.I', 'could', 'go', 'get', 'picture.Suffice', 'say', 'entire', 'movie', 'male', 'homosexual', 'fantasy', 'wake', 'up', 'class', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'male', 'also', 'homosexual', 'thus', 'sexually', 'available', 'Wishfully', 'hallucinatory', 'movie', 'realistic', 'not.Too', 'bad', 'have', 'excellent', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'early', '80s', 'British', 'classics', 'course', 'had', 'include', 'homosexually', 'innuendoed', 'Charming', 'Man', 'Smiths', '1983', 'ah', 'yes', 'how', 'fitting']",N/A

To be blunt, you don't seem to grasp the reality of that milieu any more than the Americans who don't ""get"" History Boys.  DPS presents a very accurate depiction of the claustrophobic environment at an all-boys boarding prep school in the East in that period of American history.  The film accurately depicts the obsession with control and tradition at snobby, East-Coast prep schools and the teenagers' rebellious, atavistic response.  It is NOT a Hollywood fabrication.  We have a suicide at the end and the loss of the boys' only inspiring teacher--made a scapegoat by the administration and parents: if you think that only happens in Hollywood, you're sadly mistaken.  Also, while I like History Boys a great deal, Weir has crafted a much more artistic work in DPS; it has a beautiful, at times haunting, aesthetic.  The druidic scenes in the woods alone are worth the price of admission. And it may be a vehicle for Williams but even he is real, the inveterate performer loved by the students but resented by his colleauges.

1056981,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B000NIVJFO,Mary Whipple,"[69, 79]","(3.5 stars) Set in the 1980s in a boarding school in the north of England, this newly released film adaptation of Alan Bennett's play (which won six Tony Awards during its 2006 New York run), follows eight young ""sixth-formers"" who are preparing for the history entrance examinations for Oxford or Cambridge. To help the students prepare for the exams, the headmaster hires a young teacher, Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore), to improve the students' ""presentation"" so that they will stand out from the crowd.  Irwin's goal is to teach the students to think ""outside the box""--not to be dull--when they answer examiners' questions.His mission conflicts with the goals of the English and History teachers. Hector, the motor-cycle-riding English teacher (Richard Griffiths), has taught the students reams of poetry, along with the French subjunctive (though it is not his subject), having students practice their French by pretending to negotiate at a brothel. He takes the long view and values education for its own sake. The History teacher, Dorothy Lintott (Frances de la Tour), has taught the facts: ""Plainly stated and properly organized facts need no presentation, surely,"" she remarks to the headmaster.  The students' efforts to be accepted at Oxford drive the action.The film features many of the same actors who appeared in the stage play, notably the brilliant Griffiths as Hector, the sensitive Moore as Irwin, the tough-talking, heart-of-gold de la Tour as Dorothy Lintott, and the same eight students, joking, bantering with their teachers, and pursuing their favorite subject--sex.  The film, however, is very different in tone from the play.  In the play the conflict between the teachers and their views of education unites the action and gives depth and universality to strong themes.  In the film, this conflict is much less clear, with the themes largely subordinated to questions about sexual orientation by various students and their possible abuse by a teacher.  Some characters (especially the headmaster, Clive Merrison) are caricatures, a startling contrast to the more realistically presented students.In some ways the film is better than the play.  The film shows the students within the context of a large school, and film close-ups make their emotional conflicts an intimate experience.  Hector (Griffiths) is a far more sympathetic character in the film, due in large part to the close-ups, and Irwin has a more fully developed role.  Unfortunately (and I'm not sure how universal this problem is), the film I saw (in a major theater chain), was fuzzy, with vertical black lines showing throughout the entire film, making it appear more like an 8 mm home movie than a major studio production.  The film tries to take advantage of the broader possibilities of film vs. stage, but as the context broadens, the film becomes less unified, and the drama loses some of its punch. n  Mary Whipple",4,"""History.

The boys themselves are a bit more unsure about it, some of them really only wanting to please their parents.

Filmed between the British run of the play and its world tour, the film features the same cast and director as the stage production. The story is set among the students and teachers at a boys' grammar (state) school in Yorkshire in 1983. The school's headmaster (Clive Merrison) in intent on seeing that his eight best 6th term students (seniors) get into the prestigious Oxford or Cambridge universities. He brings in a new teacher, Mr. Irwin (Steven Campbell Moore), to coach the boys for their exams. Between Irwin's provocative approach, Mr. Hector's (Richard Griffiths) unorthodox classroom, and Miss Lintott's (Frances de la Tour) traditional instruction, the boys get a few lessons on the real world along with their history.""The History Boys"" covers the personal and academic challenges of 12 people -8 students and 4 instructors- as the young men race to prepare for tests that might determine their future. The movie contains some material that isn't in the play, but it has also removed a lot to make the film shorter and tighter. It's theatrical and talky, with characters that are more representative of types than realistic. But it's very funny at times, and that's the basis on which I recommend ""The History Boys"". The humor is balanced by a somewhat awkward drama that I expect will have no shortage of detractors. The theme of competing educational styles runs throughout: Irwin teaches to tests, Lintott teaches traditional curricula, and Hector provides an eclectic, inspirational window on life and art. This is another one of those schoolboy tales in the vein of ""Dead Poets Society"". The depth is found in the teachers more than the students, but the boys' unapologetic humor won me over.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There are 2 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""History Boys Around the World: Tour Diaries"" (14 min) follows the cast to Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, and US during the play's world tour. ""Pass It On: History Boys on Screen"" (12 min) compares the stage versus screen, the film's themes, and the actors talk about their characters and preparation for the play. The audio commentary with writer Alan Bennett and director Nicholas Hynter is informative and without lulls.

1056990,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B000NIVJFO,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[8, 16]","I was quite ambivalent about this film. On the one hand, I found it an interesting look into a British prep school where the students wear jackets and ties, the classes are small and intimate, and the students and teachers have real relationships with each other. Coming from an American background with an ordinary public school education, I found this to be somewhat exotic and appealing. Perhaps I might have enjoyed school more and actually learned something had I went to a school like this.On the other hand, there wasn't much of a plot and there was very little that I could relate to with any of the characters. I had trouble understanding the accents at times and I found the overall theme to be somewhat pretentious. There was way too much homoeroticism going on in this film for my taste. There's the main teacher who routinely fondles his male students while giving them a ride on his motorcycle, which is just casually brushed off by the students as a harmless quirk of their mentor. Then there's the gay student who has a crush on his fellow pupil, who in turn has a crush on the new teacher, Mr. Irwin, who also happens to be gay although he not so forcefully disguises it. If you don't mind this sort of thing, then well, you won't mind it, but I found myself wondering how realistic this was. Perhaps I'm just a crude American, but overall I found the film to be a bit too effeminate for my liking.This is not to say that the film didn't have it's moments. It was funny at times, and as I stated earlier, it was interesting to see what schools are like on the other side of the big pond. Obviously, from the other reviews, many did enjoy this film more than myself so perhaps it is just my perspective. I would gather that this film would appeal more to an upscale ""progressive"" crowd, and not so much to a socially conservative or blue-collar viewer.

(harsh - I know)What troubled me most about the film was figuring out whether the writer was trying to present these students as actually being really intelligent or in a subtle way mocking the entire educational system because the highest echelons of academia celebrate students such as these who have little original thought of their own, yet have mastered the science of regurgitating what has been pumped into their heads.Perhaps this is the grand point Bennett is trying to make - that the system rewards congenial but ultimately mindless sheep.  Or, like the students he created, perhaps Bennett simply found a poetically intellectual facade through which to regurgitate what has been said many times before without contributing any original or intelligent ideas of his own.Either this film is brilliant or it's creatively derivative - I'm honestly not sure which.

1056998,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000NIVJFO,Scott Schiefelbein,"[7, 8]","""The History Boys"" is often referred to as a ""British Dead Poets' Society.""  This is an unfortunate comparison that is unfair to both films.  While ""DPS"" was an uplifting fable championing non-conformity and self-reliance, ""THB"" uses the setting of a British grammar school to explore a universal theme, which is whether true knowledge must be sacrificed upon the altar of material success.Set in 1983 in Yorkshire, ""THB"" takes place during the middle of England's Thatcher period, where materialism was taking hold along the same lines of Reaganism in the United States.  The movie follows eight bright students who have graded out well enough to take their ""Oxbridge"" exams, which one must pass in order to attend either Oxford or Cambridge, the two most prestigious universities in England.While not as destitute as the inner-city school from ""Stand and Deliver,"" the Yorkshire grammar school is not upper-crust, and the headmaster has dreams of placing all eight students in either Oxford or Cambridge - not for their own good, but for his own glory.  To do so, the headmaster enlists a hot young teacher, a recent graduate of Oxford (Stephen Campbell Moore) to bring some ""polish"" to the eight young lads.American audiences might be surprised that these kids need any further grooming.  In-class debates with history teacher Mrs. Lintott (Frances de la Tour) and Hector (Richard Griffiths, most famous on this side of the pond for playing Mr. Dursley, Harry Potter's uncle) are more erudite than pretty much anything heard in an American high school.  These kids are smart, well-read, and they know it.Mrs. Lintott and Hector are understandably concerned about the new teacher, particularly when he advises the students to take a more ""journalistic"" approach when writing their critical essays.  He reminds the students that if the question is about Stalin, the reader has already read 70 essays observing that Stalin was a monster.  So to make yourself stand out, you must (a) find a novel interpretation and (b) spice up your essay with sexy little quotations, even if they really don't say anything relevant.This horrifies Hector, a fussy old man whom the students adore, even though his homosexual tendencies can be a bit intrusive.  ""THB"" operates in a world where British teenagers are much more frank about their homosexuality - while I'm not sure how accurate this is for 1983, it adds a level of maturity for these boys that is quite revealing.  Hector fights valiantly for his students' minds, exhorting them to appreciate language, words, and ideas for their own sake and rather as a tool to exploit in order to get into their dream college.  To Hector, what does it matter if you have an Oxford diploma if you don't appreciate the true meaning of words?The teachers fight a liesurly battle for the souls of their students, but the students come across as stronger than the teachers.  Ultimately, some students fall more into Hector's line, while others follow the new guy.The climax of ""THB"" may not be all that surprising, but it's an enjoyable ride.  I'm sure the play on which the film is based was a powerful one - this movie is more of an enjoyable lark, with some admittedly somber moments.",4,"""History"" clashes with ""journalism"" in British school tale",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,3213,"['History', 'Boys', 'often', 'referred', 'British', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'unfortunate', 'comparison', 'unfair', 'films', 'DPS', 'was', 'uplifting', 'fable', 'championing', 'non-conformity', 'self-reliance', 'THB', 'setting', 'British', 'grammar', 'school', 'explore', 'universal', 'theme', 'true', 'knowledge', 'must', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'altar', 'material', 'success.Set', '1983', 'Yorkshire', 'THB', 'place', 'middle', 'England', 'Thatcher', 'period', 'where', 'materialism', 'was', 'taking', 'hold', 'same', 'lines', 'Reaganism', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'eight', 'bright', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'graded', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'take', 'Oxbridge', 'exams', 'must', 'pass', 'order', 'attend', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'two', 'most', 'prestigious', 'universities', 'England.While', 'not', 'as', 'destitute', 'inner-city', 'school', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Yorkshire', 'grammar', 'school', 'not', 'upper-crust', 'headmaster', 'dreams', 'placing', 'eight', 'students', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'not', 'own', 'good', 'own', 'glory', 'do', 'so', 'headmaster', 'hot', 'young', 'teacher', 'recent', 'graduate', 'Oxford', 'Stephen', 'Campbell', 'Moore', 'bring', 'polish', 'eight', 'young', 'lads.American', 'audiences', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'kids', 'need', 'further', 'grooming', 'In-class', 'history', 'teacher', 'Mrs.', 'Lintott', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Hector', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'most', 'famous', 'side', 'pond', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Dursley', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'uncle', 'are', 'more', 'erudite', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'heard', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'are', 'smart', 'well-read', 'know', 'it.Mrs', 'Lintott', 'Hector', 'are', 'understandably', 'concerned', 'new', 'teacher', 'particularly', 'when', 'students', 'take', 'more', 'journalistic', 'approach', 'when', 'writing', 'critical', 'essays', 'students', 'question', 'Stalin', 'reader', 'already', 'read', '70', 'essays', 'observing', 'Stalin', 'was', 'monster', 'So', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'must', 'find', 'novel', 'interpretation', 'b', 'up', 'essay', 'sexy', 'little', 'quotations', 'even', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'relevant.This', 'horrifies', 'Hector', 'fussy', 'old', 'man', 'whom', 'students', 'adore', 'even', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'intrusive', 'THB', 'world', 'where', 'British', 'teenagers', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'frank', 'homosexuality', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurate', '1983', 'level', 'maturity', 'boys', 'quite', 'revealing', 'Hector', 'fights', 'valiantly', 'students', 'minds', 'exhorting', 'appreciate', 'language', 'words', 'ideas', 'own', 'sake', 'rather', 'tool', 'exploit', 'order', 'get', 'dream', 'college', 'Hector', 'what', 'matter', 'have', 'Oxford', 'diploma', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'true', 'meaning', 'words', 'teachers', 'fight', 'liesurly', 'battle', 'souls', 'students', 'students', 'come', 'stronger', 'teachers', 'Ultimately', 'students', 'fall', 'more', 'Hector', 'line', 'others', 'follow', 'new', 'guy.The', 'climax', 'THB', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'enjoyable', 'ride', ""'m"", 'sure', 'play', 'film', 'based', 'was', 'powerful', 'one', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'lark', 'admittedly', 'somber', 'moments']",N/A

1057001,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000NIVJFO,Timothy Kearney,"[6, 11]","THE HISTORY BOYS is a compelling, though imperfect film. It tells a absorbing story. A group of young men from working class England circa 1983 take exams which show they are of above average intelligence and have excellent shots at getting into either Oxford or Cambridge. We meet the young men after they have taken the exams. The headmaster (played by Clive Morrison) knows that the students have been well prepared by teacher Dorothy Linnott (Francis de la Tour) but fears what they've learned from a teacher affectionately known as Hector (Richard Griffiths). So that the young men can be ""polished"" the Headmaster hires Irwin, (Stephen Campbell Moore). Irwin obliges the headmaster but knows what it is the boys truly need, namely an edge that makes them different from the other applicants, and he does his best to try and shape his young charges in a short period of time.If the film had consistently stuck to this story line, it probably would have been more convincing, but there are a number of subplots which at times distract from the overall story. One involves Hector. Hector enjoys giving his students a lift home on his motorcycle which includes a"" friendly"" bit of groping which seems to be accepted by the students as a small, almost endearing quirk. The school discovers his actions and decides to dismiss him at the end of the semester to avoid controversy. Perhaps this could happen, but in working class England in 1983, this behavior would hardly be acceptable nor would the pining of love by Possner (Samuel Barnett) for fellow student Dakin (Dominic Cooper). American audiences and critics found this a bit less than believable, especially the nonchalant reaction to the abuse of students by Hector, and a friend from England who attended a similar school told me that his compatriots would not have accepted it either, nor would a young man like Possner be so forthcoming about his feelings in such a setting. While one person from England's ""two cents worth"" may hardly be an exhaustive survey, my feeling is that his opinion is accurate. These subplots seem to keep us from getting to know some of the other characters, namely Lockwood (Andrew Knott) and Rudge (Russell Tovey) who seem to be more interesting than either Posner or Dakin, at least in my opinion. Also, there is a scene where Linnott discusses what happens in the future to may of the characters and while it probably works well on stage, it's somewhat confusing in the film version.Still while it may be a less than perfect film, it does maintain a viewer's interest and presented a good story. The characters can be multifaceted which makes them interesting and there are a number of ironies in the film which likewise gives it strength. Perhaps on stage it would work better, as can be the case with so many stage works.

The History Boys is a very good example of a brilliant adaptation. Similar to Proof, The History Boys moved a single location play (sort of, although in the original play there are video footages projected to expand the space for imagination) to a multiple location film production but kept all the essence of the play.The story is about a group of Oxbridge (Oxford & Cambridge) hopefuls at their last and extra term at their ordinary high school / secondary school after their A Level success. The play brilliantly talks about the validity and truth of history and the comparative and relative aspect of looking at history through a bunch of students and their three very distinct and different teachers. The teachers are the eccentric, free thinking, and completely fluid teaching approach Hector, facts-facts-facts Dorothy and ""want anything but dull essays"" Irwin. These teachers represent different approaches to their students and central ideas of how we should look at things. And they naturally provide a whole wealth of stimuli to prepare the boys for their Oxbridge dreams.The teachers were played by three excellent actors - Richard Griffiths as Hector, Frances de la Tour as Dorothy (you can see them both in Harry Potter :) ) and Stephen Campell Moore as Irwin. This dynamic trio provided the much needed weight for the production as compared to the light heart side provided by the boys themselves. Richard Griffiths' performance was brilliant and so were the other two. The monologue by Dorothy about the role of women in history was brilliantly done. Also the double personality of Irwin (outward and articulate in classroom and retreating in personal life) was well portrayed by Stephen.For the boys, none of them were particularly standing out except for Dominic Cooper who played Dakin. It is not because all the others were badly played or done but because all the parts were so well and balanced that you really feel that they are one group (which is important and central to the production). Dakin as a character stands out more because his beauty was the subject of various sexual tensions weaving in and out of the whole story. The History Boys did show us that how well a production could be if you got the ensemble right. All the boys show a different facet of humanity e.g. Posner's late coming of age and sexuality issues, Scripps' unconditional devotion to this faith while itching inside for sex, Rudge's black sheep role in the group etc. were all portrayal of humanity in one big group.The dialogues in the movie were well written and there were a lot of quotations (or gobbets as Irwin put in the movie / play) of classic text but they were brilliantly mastered and articulated. Scripps and Posner got good chances of showing their performance range as they were the ""performing duo"" for the group during classes.The History Boys is a clear demonstration of a good play with a good adaptation. The thing is all the main characters in the movie were played by the same actors on the stage that made the play a phenomenal success in the theatrical circle. So they really did live the characters' lives when they were shooting it. Alan Bennett brilliant writing once again proved that good writings will win over the audience.One last thing though, if you do not like anything with same sex innuendos, this might not be your type of film as there are references to same sex issues from time to time. There are no sex scenes or such, but the references and connotations in the dialogues may put you off if you really dislike this kind of material. Otherwise, it is definitely a not to miss movie.",5,Another brilliant adaptation from a brilliant play,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,3716,"['Sometimes', 'just', 'wonder', 'why', 'adaptations', 'plays', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'not', 'History', 'Boys', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'Similar', 'Proof', 'History', 'Boys', 'moved', 'single', 'location', 'play', 'sort', 'original', 'play', 'are', 'video', 'footages', 'projected', 'expand', 'space', 'imagination', 'multiple', 'location', 'film', 'production', 'kept', 'essence', 'play.The', 'story', 'group', 'Oxbridge', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'hopefuls', 'last', 'extra', 'term', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', '/', 'secondary', 'school', 'Level', 'success', 'play', 'brilliantly', 'validity', 'truth', 'history', 'comparative', 'relative', 'aspect', 'looking', 'history', 'bunch', 'students', 'three', 'very', 'distinct', 'different', 'teachers', 'teachers', 'are', 'eccentric', 'free', 'thinking', 'completely', 'fluid', 'teaching', 'approach', 'Hector', 'facts-facts-facts', 'Dorothy', 'want', 'anything', 'dull', 'essays', 'Irwin', 'teachers', 'represent', 'different', 'approaches', 'students', 'central', 'ideas', 'how', 'should', 'look', 'things', 'naturally', 'provide', 'whole', 'wealth', 'stimuli', 'prepare', 'boys', 'Oxbridge', 'dreams.The', 'teachers', 'were', 'played', 'three', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Hector', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Dorothy', 'can', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Stephen', 'Campell', 'Moore', 'Irwin', 'dynamic', 'trio', 'provided', 'much', 'needed', 'weight', 'production', 'compared', 'light', 'heart', 'side', 'provided', 'boys', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'performance', 'was', 'brilliant', 'so', 'were', 'other', 'two', 'monologue', 'Dorothy', 'role', 'women', 'history', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'Also', 'double', 'personality', 'Irwin', 'outward', 'articulate', 'classroom', 'retreating', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Stephen.For', 'boys', 'none', 'were', 'particularly', 'standing', 'out', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'who', 'played', 'Dakin', 'not', 'others', 'were', 'badly', 'played', 'done', 'parts', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'balanced', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'one', 'group', 'important', 'central', 'production', 'Dakin', 'character', 'out', 'more', 'beauty', 'was', 'subject', 'various', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'weaving', 'whole', 'story', 'History', 'Boys', 'did', 'show', 'how', 'well', 'production', 'could', 'be', 'got', 'ensemble', 'right', 'boys', 'show', 'different', 'facet', 'humanity', 'e.g', 'Posner', 'late', 'coming', 'age', 'sexuality', 'issues', 'Scripps', 'unconditional', 'devotion', 'faith', 'itching', 'sex', 'Rudge', 'black', 'sheep', 'role', 'group', 'etc', 'were', 'portrayal', 'humanity', 'one', 'big', 'group.The', 'dialogues', 'movie', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'were', 'lot', 'quotations', 'gobbets', 'Irwin', 'put', 'movie', '/', 'play', 'classic', 'text', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'mastered', 'articulated', 'Scripps', 'Posner', 'got', 'good', 'chances', 'showing', 'performance', 'range', 'were', 'performing', 'duo', 'group', 'classes.The', 'History', 'Boys', 'clear', 'demonstration', 'good', 'play', 'good', 'adaptation', 'thing', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'played', 'same', 'actors', 'stage', 'made', 'play', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'theatrical', 'circle', 'really', 'did', 'live', 'characters', 'lives', 'when', 'were', 'shooting', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'once', 'again', 'proved', 'good', 'writings', 'will', 'win', 'audience.One', 'last', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'anything', 'same', 'sex', 'innuendos', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'type', 'film', 'are', 'references', 'same', 'sex', 'issues', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'such', 'references', 'connotations', 'dialogues', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'really', 'dislike', 'kind', 'material', 'Otherwise', 'definitely', 'not', 'miss', 'movie']",N/A

Because of their promise, the headmaster of the school decides to hire a new faculty member to prepare them for their exams and essays and everything else that goes along with the application process.Although History Boys is fun and entertaining, there's just something missing. It could just be that I didn't catch it, but I didn't really see what the underlying theme of the movie was. Overall, the whole film feels a bit surface, but it's a surface that seems to imply that there's something underneath, which makes it a little confusing. Maybe we're supposed to grasp that life is not a lesson to be understood, but something to be vaguely appreciated.The plotline involving the teacher that likes to ""touch"" the students (for some reason it's not called sexual molestation) is a bit strange because the story seems to have the students idolizing and mocking this professor at the same time. Also, he seems to be a very sympathetic character while at the same time he is viewed as a hindrance to their getting in to college. Perhaps the message is that we all have flaws and some of our flaws include molesting our students, but we should be forgiving... or something like that. I'm not really sure.The audience will definitely find themselves connecting with the students as they struggle through their studies and (ostensibly) learn what life is all about. But, in the end, you may find yourself wondering why you feel like you just learned something, but don't know what it is.The DVD includes a ""making of"" featurette which is pretty cool, because it details how the director brought the entire cast of the original stage production onto the film.
