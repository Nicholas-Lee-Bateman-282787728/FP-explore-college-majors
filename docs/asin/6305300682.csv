They decide to steal the money and don't mention it to anybody. But it turns out one of the shot people weren't dead and has heard everything and soon, they find themselves in deep trouble.The story is quite interesting. It shows how people can behave in ways they didn't know they were capable of, when they find themselves in strange situations. It's not too predictable and the movie has a nice, sometimes melancholic feeling. All the actors are good, especially Kyle MacLachlan, Wade Williams and Roma Maffia.I recommend you to see this movie, especially if you liked ""A Simple Plan"". It's a good, suspenseful thriller.",4,Suspenseful TV thriller.,999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,726,"['Two', 'cops', 'arrive', 'crime', 'scene', 'seven', 'shot', 'dead', 'bodies', 'suitcase', '1.5', 'million', 'dollars', 'decide', 'steal', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'anybody', 'out', 'one', 'shot', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'dead', 'heard', 'everything', 'soon', 'find', 'deep', 'trouble.The', 'story', 'quite', 'interesting', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'behave', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'capable', 'when', 'find', 'strange', 'situations', 'not', 'too', 'predictable', 'movie', 'nice', 'sometimes', 'melancholic', 'feeling', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'Roma', 'Maffia.I', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie', 'especially', 'liked', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'thriller']",Route 9

It was the letting of the blood that converted them into morons.  This film runs with that premise as did ""Simple Plan"" and ""Blood Simple"". Two deputy sheriffs come across a crime scene that seems too good to be true and within fifteen minutes they become thieves and murderers.  From that original activity, all hell proceeds to break loose.  This film also has a good natured sense of humor about it and you will find yourself at times laughing at the two leads and their descent into criminality.  Well done.

458865,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6305300682,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 1]","I almost gave this four stars. The only thing that kept me from doing so was the kinda formulaic plot, but in all fairness, it's done well. This is kinda like a poor man's version of ""A Simple Plan"" with some ham-fisted acting--it doesn't have the professionalism of Raimi's ""Simple Plan""--but nevertheless still effective.So the formula goes--unsuspecting guys stumble on dead bodies and lotsa cash and lotsa drugs. The guys take the money. Complications ensue (gee, really?). The only actor here with serious professional chops is, interestingly, Roma Maffia, who plays the FBI agent Ellen Marks. She's like moving through the whole film with this demeanor that's saying, ""Are you kiddin' me? THIS is what we're doing here??"" But she's pretty cool.The other actors are somewhat off kilter (in their acting) and play characters who are mostly either dumb or illogical. Or both. But you kinda identify with them cause after all, they're only human, right? Just like the rest of us. And yeah, that includes me. Sometimes I do dumb things. Sometimes I do illogical things. Am I better than everyone else? Nope. And neither are these characters. That's what makes this movie work to the extent that it does.The two guys who find the cash, drugs, and dead bodies belong to the Sheriff's Department in Grimley, Texas. One has an ongoing affair with the sheriff's wife and the other, at heart, is a vicious thug. The sheriff himself, played by Peter Coyote, is a crude guy (talk about yer stereotypes) but since he's a decent actor, he makes his character fun to watch.While the plot is formulaic, it's not stupid. The characters may do dumb things, but this is not a dumb movie. It works pretty well, in fact.

A solid, very entertaining noir B-thriller.Cop Kyle MacLachlan and his partner aim to steal a cache of loot from acrime scene ... think they'll get away with it?? Kyle Mac is sort ofbullied into the scheme by his bumbling, loudmouth, forever-in-debtpartner. And as soon as the idea is hatched, things go wrong, Murphy'sLaw-style, for the next 90 minutes. There were plenty of twists andturns in the plot: many were quite predictable, but some were realshockers, and the intrigue carried through until the final scene, withthe viewer never *really* sure who would come out on top.This is a made-for-cable movie from the '90s but does not feel lowbrowor shot on-the-cheap like many such movies do. MacLachlan is joined inthe cast by familiar faces such as Amy Locane, Peter Coyote, thestriking Roma Maffia (who is terrific as a very sharp DEA agent), andMiguel Sandoval, later to star in TV's ""Medium"". There are a few verynice stunts including a big gun battle to start the pic, a mountainsidecar chase, and numerous big explosions. Director David Mackay manages afew very clever setups and cutaways as he keeps the story moving along.The music score features a prominent bluesy slide guitar dropped in foreffect here and there, it is very nicely done.This is in the end a B-movie, but B-movies when done well can be asexciting and diverting as a pic of any stripe, thanks to simple,efficient construction and skilled execution.
