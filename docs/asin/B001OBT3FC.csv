1222357,A1O96LY5TIREBT,B001OBT3FC,"Chhan Thuan Kiat ""Pediatrician & music nut""","[53, 55]","This celebratory concert(100th anniversary of Karajan's birth)recorded at the dazzling Golden hall of Vienna's Musikverein on 28 Jan 2008, is arguably the best concert disc on Blu ray that I've seen so far. Featuring Anne Sophie Mutter in stunning form musically, playing Beethoven's violin concerto, the work with which she has performed more times with her late mentor Karajan than any other work,and supported by the Berliners in sparkling form,with immaculate conducting from Seiji Ozawa, this is a must have for music lovers. Yes one may have heard the Beethoven a hundred times but when performed with such panache and virtuosity,one hears it again afresh. The picture quality is first class and the recorded audio in PCM 5.1  is brilliant with great dynamic range and a surround ambience that almost makes one feel one were in a concert hall. In the larghetto Mutter coaxed the most amazing tones from her instrument and with lucid accompaniment from the woodwinds particularly the bassoon this was a movement to cherish. This is a lush and romantic reading , the soloist relishing in the musical nuances of this Mount Everest of violin concertos. The final movement too is played with great aplomb. The solo violin Partita( Sarabande) by JS Bach was a refreshing sorbet before the next major work, Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony, and here too one sees Ozawa urging the BPO in a dramatic account with exciting sonic dynamics very well recorded . How the audience responded. What a concert .

Mutter's poignant encore of the ""sarabande"" from Bach's Partita for solo violin No.2 in D minor (one can discern Mutter holding in the tears)which she played for Karajan in her audition for him is a fitting exclamation point to a wonderful concert.

1222361,A12XDEMP7PQPDT,B001OBT3FC,D. DEGEORGE,"[5, 5]","First, I agree with all those superlatives other reviewers have been lavishing on the performance and the wonderful sense of presence in the Musikverein. The video, all the more so in Blu-ray, adds immeasurably to the overall experience, musical and otherwise. Not only does one have a seat better than anyone in the house, even in that superb concert hall, but a student can get the benefit of a closeup view of Ms. Mutter's marvelous technique. Also, seeing the fervor with which the musicians of the Berliner Philharmoniker delved into the music sent chills up my spine--the kind of commitment on display here, by musicians who could play this stuff in their sleep but chose instead to play with the enthusiasm of people playing it for the first time in their lives, was truly exciting.I did find some unfortunate flaws in the engineering of this Blu-ray, however--at least in the copy I received; and I have carefully checked my setup, comparing with other nominally identically encoded Blu-rays; and I have discovered that there are no sub-woofer channels active. It's not PCM 2.1 or PCM 5.1, but rather PCM 2.0 and PCM 5.0. For those of us who depend upon a standard satellite-speaker/sub-woofer setup, this can be a problem, although there are various workarounds, depending upon the configuration of one's A/V system. In my case, for example, it is necessary to select the PCM Stereo track on the Blu-ray and then let my receiver simulate the surround, synthesizing a woofer track in the process. Those who use full-range stereo speakers, and not a sub-woofer, or those whose sub-woofer connects by speaker wires (rather than, or in addition to, a .1 [LFE] line-level connection) should have no problem, however.The engineering problems do not end there, though. I found that, first, there is no access to a ""Top Menu."" When using the Pop-up menu as an alternative, I discovered that once in the Audio setup portion, I could not move to another function such as ""Chapters"" or ""Subtitles,"" UNLESS I navigated back through the audio choices, thus being forced into PCM Stereo (not surround) whether I wanted it or not. Once one leaves the pop-up menu, (s)he can then push the ""audio"" button on the remote and then set the audio to surround mode.Except for the lack of bass (""other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?""), I thought the audio was quite spectacular. When playing the surround tracks, there is not much difference in the sound of the orchestra; and I don't notice a great deal of extra hall ambience; and perhaps that is as it should be. The surround mostly comes into play during the applause or during quiet passages, when one becomes aware of the ""air"" around him or herself; but that's a nice touch.The poor technical ""authoring"" of the Blu-ray is almost enough to make me suggest getting the DVD instead, assuming it does not suffer from the same problems; however, if you have a large-screen TV--one on which you can see a dramatic difference between Blu-ray and DVD--I still recommend the Blu-ray because, even though the technical glitches are inexcusable, they are also surmountable.",4,Great performance; some engineering glitches on the Blu-ray,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3125,"['First', 'agree', 'superlatives', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'lavishing', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'presence', 'Musikverein', 'video', 'more', 'so', 'Blu-ray', 'immeasurably', 'overall', 'experience', 'musical', 'otherwise', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'seat', 'better', 'anyone', 'house', 'even', 'superb', 'concert', 'hall', 'student', 'can', 'get', 'benefit', 'closeup', 'view', 'Ms', 'Mutter', 'marvelous', 'technique', 'Also', 'seeing', 'fervor', 'musicians', 'Berliner', 'Philharmoniker', 'delved', 'music', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'kind', 'commitment', 'display', 'here', 'musicians', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'stuff', 'sleep', 'chose', 'instead', 'play', 'enthusiasm', 'people', 'playing', 'first', 'time', 'lives', 'was', 'truly', 'exciting.I', 'did', 'find', 'unfortunate', 'flaws', 'engineering', 'Blu-ray', 'however', 'least', 'copy', 'received', 'have', 'carefully', 'checked', 'setup', 'comparing', 'other', 'nominally', 'identically', 'encoded', 'Blu-rays', 'have', 'discovered', 'are', 'sub-woofer', 'channels', 'active', 'not', 'PCM', '2.1', 'PCM', '5.1', 'rather', 'PCM', '2.0', 'PCM', '5.0', 'who', 'depend', 'standard', 'satellite-speaker/sub-woofer', 'setup', 'can', 'be', 'problem', 'are', 'various', 'workarounds', 'depending', 'configuration', 'one', 'A/V', 'system', 'case', 'example', 'necessary', 'select', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'track', 'Blu-ray', 'then', 'let', 'receiver', 'simulate', 'surround', 'synthesizing', 'woofer', 'track', 'process', 'who', 'use', 'full-range', 'stereo', 'speakers', 'not', 'sub-woofer', 'sub-woofer', 'connects', 'speaker', 'wires', 'rather', 'addition', '.1', '[', 'LFE', ']', 'line-level', 'connection', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'however.The', 'engineering', 'problems', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'there', 'found', 'first', 'access', 'Top', 'Menu', 'When', 'using', 'Pop-up', 'menu', 'alternative', 'discovered', 'once', 'Audio', 'setup', 'portion', 'could', 'not', 'move', 'function', 'such', 'Chapters', 'Subtitles', 'navigated', 'back', 'audio', 'choices', 'thus', 'being', 'forced', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'not', 'surround', 'wanted', 'not', 'Once', 'one', 'pop-up', 'menu', 's', 'can', 'then', 'push', 'audio', 'button', 'remote', 'then', 'set', 'audio', 'surround', 'mode.Except', 'lack', 'bass', 'other', 'Mrs.', 'Lincoln', 'how', 'did', 'play', 'thought', 'audio', 'was', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'When', 'playing', 'surround', 'tracks', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'sound', 'orchestra', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'great', 'deal', 'extra', 'hall', 'ambience', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'surround', 'mostly', 'play', 'applause', 'quiet', 'passages', 'when', 'one', 'aware', 'air', 'nice', 'touch.The', 'poor', 'technical', 'authoring', 'Blu-ray', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'suggest', 'getting', 'DVD', 'instead', 'assuming', 'not', 'suffer', 'same', 'problems', 'however', 'have', 'large-screen', 'TV', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'dramatic', 'difference', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'still', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'technical', 'glitches', 'are', 'inexcusable', 'are', 'also', 'surmountable']",N/A

After the Emperor's death, the orchestra has just gone downhill (granted, the entire classical orchestra scene worldwide is showing the same pathetic decline). The inclusion of Tchaskovsky's ""Pathetique"" symphone is quite an irony on this program. It's played with such lethargy and anti-enthusiasm that I could hardly bear to watch or hear it. Ozawa, who was good a couple of decades ago, has definitely lost whatever edge he had held before. Mutter as the soloist just trashed Beethoven's supreme concerto; the sound was harsh and stiff, and there were tons of bowing errors. Compare this performance with hers under Karajan 30 years ago, it was night and day, this one night, that one day. (She's an over-rated violinist to begin with; so many of her countrymen, and countryladies, play the Beethoven concerto so much better.)Personally, I think to hear the Pathetique symphone done right, you have to listen to Russian recordings. Karajan's classic recording is good, but still not great, and the one on this program just sucks.The Blu-ray video here is clear and crisp with good color tones, but the camerawork itself is just average for concert videos; for example, why the h*ck did the director not start the video fo the Beethoven with the timpani beating the first motif of the 5 bass-D notes (so absolutely simple yet so absolutely haunting)? Mutter's entrance is given in a wide-angle shot; maybe the director thought the audience wouldn't want to took at her! The sound is done well, with rich tonality and very good balance.

1222363,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B001OBT3FC,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This memorial concert has such close links with Karajan that it is worthwhile explaining why it meant so much to both Ozawa and Mutter. The connection between both of them and between themselves and Karajan is that they were both Karajan's prot&eacute;g&eacute;es and had been considerably supported by Karajan in establishing their respective careers. They therefore make an especially appropriate pair of artistes to fulfil their roles in this concert.The bonus feature is in the form of a post-concert interview with both Mutter and Ozawa separately in which they are asked what effect Karajan had on their lives and also why they had chosen their particular pieces to play/conduct.In the case of Anne-Sophie Mutter she made very clear her admiration for Karajan outlining his many special contributions to music and to music making. In particular she emphasised his abilities to work tirelessly with the orchestra, up to 50 hours for a single piece, to achieve such a level of understanding that the orchestral members were then free to express themselves within the concept being worked on.Ozawa stressed the contribution that Karajan had made to the advance of recording techniques which we all benefit from today. His choice of the Tchaikovsky was made because of the enormous identification he felt with Karajan's interpretation. Likewise with Mutter, who explained that she had played the Beethoven with Karajan more often than any other piece. Her encore was her audition piece with Karajan when she was only 13 years of age.The concert recorded on this disc fully fulfilled these retrospective comments. The Beethoven was given a steady but spellbinding interpretation progressing from darkness into light as Mutter explains. This, not surprisingly, was met with a prolonged ovation which was then followed by a simply sublime performance of the Bach Sarabande from the 2nd Partita. This is not a performance in the 'authentic' manner but is altogether more generous in its expression of romantic warmth. This is achieved without heaviness although it could never be accused of being speedy. In my opinion this is a performance that Karajan would have identified with and approved of.`Tonight this orchestra played amazingly' said Ozawa when concluding his interview held just after the concert. Both artists stressed Karajan's modesty and warmth - important recollections frequently unspoken of and therefore largely unknown.Ozawa was on inspirational form and his above acknowledgement of the orchestra's contribution modestly fails to fully explain why. From this viewers point of view I would suggest that they were inspired, not only by the debt that they felt towards Karajan in this series of concerts, but also by Ozawa's deeply committed, exciting and ultimately moving interpretation. Once more this is a performance that would have earned praise from Karajan himself being meticulously prepared with a strong sense of direction leading to a satisfying emotional conclusion.This is a remarkable memorial tribute to Karajan's 100th birthday and is given a superb recording to match with crisp, detailed and non-invasive camera work coupled with excellent sound in stereo and surround format presented in PCM 5.1 format.

Close-ups looked acceptable because there wasn't much fine detail.Many camera angles, and platforms on dollies that allowed horizontal and vertical movement made the viewing interesting, however.For all the expensive monitors (I know those HD monitors they use are at least $14K a piece), the camera operator behind conductor Seiji Ozawa seemed to take a long time to hunt for focus, often showing us badly out of focus images of Anne-Sophie Mutter's left hand. He also tried to go in too close and couldn't follow the movements of her violin, leaving us with an out of focus background some of the time.Now for the audio:First impression hit me when the applause was heard at the beginning: it was harsh, muddled and lacking in detail--I could not discern indivual clapping. The sound also had pitch to it, like it was going through a passband filter.When Beeth...oven's Violin Concerto began, the pianissimo parts were too loud--it was obvious that gain riding and compression were heavily in use.I found the audio lacking in real fine detail. It had medium fine detail that was overenhanced, much like the video picture, but was lacking in the real fine detail that tells me I'm really IN the concert hall. There seemed to be a lack especially of the very high end of the highs.. I could not hear the rosin on the violin strings--it was just not there.When we got to the Tchaikovsky Symphony No 6, the compression was devastating--the percussion was just cacophony--it was fatiguing to listen to this recording.The sound stage was flat, dimensionless. There was no sense of front to back depth. The sound was as flat as my screen. At times, I thought I was hearing monaural and not even the PCM stereo that the player said was the track I was hearing. Mary Ann noticed it, too.The frequency response was uneven, like a comb filter.When a wide shot came up, I could see what my ears were telling me was wrong:This recording suffers from the 'too many mics syndrome'. And the mics were in the wrong places. Overheads were directly OVER the orchestra. This isn't Mercury Living Presence and it isn't 1955, recording a mono 78 rpm record!Making matters worse, there were at least six hanging mics, plus a mic over the soloist, and.. there were a combination of ribbon mics and small Schoeps condensers throughout the orchestra in amoungst the seats! When this all mixed down, it produced comb filtering effects as the overlapping sounds from adjacent mikes mixes and interacts at wavelengths of the sound frequencies, sometimes adding, sometimes subtracting.Placing mikes in the orchestra eliminates the time arrival cues we need to sense distance of the instruments relative to us, which is why this recording sounded sterile, lifeless and flat with no depth.I'd wager the cost of making this recording ventured close to six figures, between the $2,000,000 worth of 11 Sony broadcast cameras from ten years ago, even though this was recorded Jan 2008. The lenses were $60K a piece on those cameras, and they were very good, but the imagers were not full raster and wide shots broke down, looking more like standard def or a little better, not HD.All I could think of while watching this was, ""If I could have had ten CineAlta XDCams, my mic setup and my crew there in Berlin, I could have made this a REALLY great concert video with audio to satisfy the pickiest of audiophiles, like Peter Aczel."" It's a shame I no longer fly on commercial planes, because this production crew didn't do the concert justice.",2,"Sterile, Flat-sounding Recording, But Good Performance",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,4171,"['Just', 'watched', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'Memorial', 'Concert', 'Blu-ray', 'Bill', 'post', 'least', 'dozen', 'comments', 'nice', 'when', 'have', '11', 'video', 'cameras', 'wraparound', 'platform', 'mere', 'feet', 'orchestra', 'shoot', 'good', 'thing', 'video.Now', 'technical', 'comments', 'video', 'looked', 'decent', '720P', 'upsampled', '1080P', 'Colors', 'were', 'icy', 'cold', 'skin', 'tones', 'looked', 'bit', 'lifeless', 'picture', 'looked', 'video', 'lacked', 'organicness', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'real', 'resolution', 'electro', 'nic', 'edge', 'sharpening', 'left', 'halos', 'sheet', 'music', 'really', 'showed', 'up', 'wide', 'shots', 'Close-ups', 'looked', 'acceptable', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'fine', 'detail.Many', 'camera', 'angles', 'platforms', 'dollies', 'allowed', 'horizontal', 'vertical', 'movement', 'made', 'viewing', 'interesting', 'however.For', 'expensive', 'monitors', 'know', 'HD', 'monitors', 'use', 'are', 'least', '14K', 'piece', 'camera', 'operator', 'conductor', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'seemed', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'hunt', 'focus', 'often', 'showing', 'badly', 'focus', 'images', 'Anne-Sophie', 'Mutter', 'left', 'hand', 'also', 'tried', 'go', 'too', 'close', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'movements', 'violin', 'leaving', 'out', 'focus', 'time.Now', 'audio', 'First', 'impression', 'hit', 'when', 'applause', 'was', 'heard', 'beginning', 'was', 'harsh', 'muddled', 'lacking', 'detail', 'could', 'not', 'discern', 'indivual', 'clapping', 'sound', 'also', 'had', 'pitch', 'was', 'going', 'passband', 'filter.When', 'Beeth', 'Violin', 'Concerto', 'began', 'pianissimo', 'parts', 'were', 'too', 'loud', 'was', 'obvious', 'gain', 'riding', 'compression', 'were', 'heavily', 'use.I', 'found', 'audio', 'lacking', 'real', 'fine', 'detail', 'had', 'medium', 'fine', 'detail', 'was', 'overenhanced', 'much', 'video', 'picture', 'was', 'lacking', 'real', 'fine', 'detail', ""'m"", 'really', 'IN', 'concert', 'hall', 'seemed', 'be', 'lack', 'especially', 'very', 'high', 'end', 'highs..', 'could', 'not', 'hear', 'rosin', 'violin', 'strings', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'got', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Symphony', 'No', '6', 'compression', 'was', 'devastating', 'percussion', 'was', 'just', 'cacophony', 'was', 'fatiguing', 'listen', 'recording.The', 'sound', 'stage', 'was', 'flat', 'dimensionless', 'was', 'sense', 'front', 'back', 'depth', 'sound', 'was', 'as', 'flat', 'screen', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'hearing', 'monaural', 'not', 'even', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'player', 'said', 'was', 'track', 'was', 'hearing', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'noticed', 'too.The', 'frequency', 'response', 'was', 'uneven', 'comb', 'wide', 'shot', 'came', 'up', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'ears', 'were', 'telling', 'was', 'wrong', 'recording', 'suffers', ""'too"", 'many', 'mics', 'syndrome', 'mics', 'were', 'wrong', 'places', 'Overheads', 'were', 'directly', 'orchestra', ""n't"", 'Mercury', 'Living', 'Presence', ""n't"", '1955', 'recording', 'mono', '78', 'rpm', 'record', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'were', 'least', 'six', 'hanging', 'mics', 'mic', 'soloist', 'were', 'combination', 'ribbon', 'mics', 'small', 'Schoeps', 'condensers', 'orchestra', 'amoungst', 'seats', 'When', 'mixed', 'down', 'produced', 'comb', 'filtering', 'effects', 'overlapping', 'sounds', 'adjacent', 'mikes', 'mixes', 'interacts', 'wavelengths', 'sound', 'frequencies', 'sometimes', 'adding', 'sometimes', 'subtracting.Placing', 'mikes', 'orchestra', 'time', 'arrival', 'cues', 'need', 'sense', 'distance', 'instruments', 'relative', 'why', 'recording', 'sounded', 'sterile', 'lifeless', 'flat', 'depth.I', ""'d"", 'wager', 'cost', 'making', 'recording', 'ventured', 'close', 'six', 'figures', '2,000,000', 'worth', '11', 'Sony', 'broadcast', 'cameras', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'was', 'recorded', 'Jan', '2008', 'lenses', 'were', '60K', 'piece', 'cameras', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'imagers', 'were', 'not', 'full', 'raster', 'wide', 'shots', 'broke', 'down', 'looking', 'more', 'like', 'standard', 'def', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'HD.All', 'could', 'think', 'watching', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'ten', 'CineAlta', 'XDCams', 'mic', 'setup', 'crew', 'there', 'Berlin', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'REALLY', 'great', 'concert', 'video', 'audio', 'satisfy', 'pickiest', 'audiophiles', 'Peter', 'Aczel', 'shame', 'no', 'longer', 'fly', 'commercial', 'planes', 'production', 'crew', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'concert', 'justice']",N/A

Filmed in Full HD 1080P and with a lossless 5.1 PCM or 2.0 PCM soundtrack, you may as well be a member of the audience. There is something incredibly invigorating seeing a premier orchestra in full flight, with excellent camera-work to match. The sound in the rear is more than just ambient and you truly feel surrounded.Don't get me wrong - I would have killed to be in the Musikverein that evening, but this is definitely the next best thing.This was a truly special concert, and Anne-Sophie Mutter gives a thrilling account of the Beethoven Concerto, magnificently supported by von Karajan protegee Seiji Ozawa and the Berliners. The Tchaikovsky 6th is no less transporting.It is a great pity, that at time of writing this, you can count on one hand the number of Blu-Ray releases of orchestral performances - and still have a finger or two left over.
