Young) and it's all over. Soon they're wed and off on their honeymoon at an expensive hotel. But before things can really get started, he's called away on business and Cynthia is all alone.It isn't long before she starts spending time with a decorated war hero (Van Johnson), teaching him to swim, eating meals with him, and taking long walks through the gorgeous landscape. And it isn't long before he confesses his love for her, and now Cynthia is stuck, a kiss-less bride in love with another man.The chemistry between Williams and Johnson is perfect, and his heartfelt confession to her on the balcony will send chills up anyone's spine. They make a decent script into something really special.There are several musical numbers performed by operatic star Lauritz Melchior to add a little something extra to the film.",5,Very Romantic,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,927,"['Beautiful', 'swimming', 'teacher', 'Cynthia', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'eye', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Carleton', 'G.', 'Young', 'over', 'Soon', ""'re"", 'wed', 'honeymoon', 'expensive', 'hotel', 'things', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'started', 'called', 'away', 'business', 'Cynthia', 'alone.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'spending', 'time', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'teaching', 'swim', 'eating', 'meals', 'taking', 'long', 'walks', 'gorgeous', 'landscape', ""n't"", 'long', 'love', 'now', 'Cynthia', 'stuck', 'kiss-less', 'bride', 'love', 'man.The', 'chemistry', 'Williams', 'Johnson', 'perfect', 'heartfelt', 'confession', 'balcony', 'will', 'send', 'chills', 'up', 'anyone', 'spine', 'make', 'decent', 'script', 'something', 'really', 'are', 'several', 'musical', 'numbers', 'performed', 'operatic', 'star', 'Lauritz', 'Melchior', 'add', 'little', 'something', 'extra', 'film']",Thrill of a Romance VHS
313284,A222UT38AMN0H2,630245316X,The reviewer,"[0, 0]","Wow, how do you get a flirtatious extramarital affair past the censors in 1945?  A big no-no, especially with their leading ladies and boy nextdoor leading men.  But they found a way to double-cancel the problem and love conquers all.Esther Williams winds up abandoned on her honeymoon and keeps bumping into Van Johnson, who can't swim.  She's lovely, lonesome and feeling neglected.  Van is handsome, smitten and just back from being lost in action during the war.  With nothing else to do, she winds up teaching him how to swim.The music from Tommy Dorsey's orchestra still sounds wonderful and vibrant, just what you'd want to hear in a beautiful hotel.  Opera singer Lauritz Melchior is perhaps a little off the wall in this piece, and a bit of a ham, but he has a Gerber Baby look about him as he tries to endure a strict diet.  Who goes to a first class hotel to go on a diet?  A hotel worker watches him like a hawk and even sits down and eats his food when he tries to cheat.  That part is a little silly, but you'll enjoy the stars, the swimming, the swing music and the sets.",4,Van and Esther Make it Fun,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,1086,"['Wow', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'flirtatious', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'censors', '1945', 'big', 'no-no', 'especially', 'leading', 'ladies', 'boy', 'nextdoor', 'leading', 'men', 'found', 'way', 'double-cancel', 'problem', 'love', 'conquers', 'all.Esther', 'Williams', 'up', 'abandoned', 'honeymoon', 'bumping', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', 'lovely', 'lonesome', 'feeling', 'neglected', 'Van', 'handsome', 'smitten', 'just', 'back', 'being', 'lost', 'action', 'war', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'up', 'teaching', 'how', 'swim.The', 'music', 'Tommy', 'Dorsey', 'orchestra', 'still', 'wonderful', 'vibrant', 'just', 'what', ""'d"", 'want', 'hear', 'beautiful', 'hotel', 'Opera', 'singer', 'Lauritz', 'Melchior', 'perhaps', 'little', 'off', 'wall', 'piece', 'bit', 'ham', 'Gerber', 'Baby', 'look', 'about', 'endure', 'strict', 'diet', 'Who', 'first', 'class', 'hotel', 'go', 'diet', 'hotel', 'worker', 'hawk', 'even', 'sits', 'down', 'eats', 'food', 'when', 'cheat', 'part', 'little', 'silly', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'stars', 'swimming', 'swing', 'music', 'sets']",Thrill of a Romance VHS
