This is an example of a not very good one.The only saving grace here (no pun intended) is Clark Gable.  He gives an honest, sincere performance.The problem with Crawford is that her phony diction and elocution skills for a common character mars her performance.  (Notice how she says ""Bean"" for ""been"" and A-gAin for again....as if she's some high society matron when in actuality she's playing a common tramp who gets ""saved"" by salvation army recruiter Gable.  Crawford's facial expressions...the tightening of her lips, smiling to herself, or frowning to herself are very distracting as well.  The woman simply does not carry this role of with conviction.Another of the film's liabilities is the dull and vapid screenplay.  Under director Harry Beaumont's direction, things move at a very slow pace, especially when extra, unnecessary characters take up a lot of the time with useless dialogue that adds nothing to the story.A tighter script and better direction of Crawford would have given this film some merit.  As it stands it is just merely an example of the ""MGM"" ""sausage"" Crawford turned out in the 1930s.

333916,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,630278705X,calvinnme,"[2, 2]","This film is probably the weakest of the Gable/Crawford film pairings. It's not that their performances aren't great, it's just that they're not given that much to do. The storyline is very basic - Joan is a performer in a nightspot who has had a long-distance affair going with a traveling salesman, Howard Palmer (Neil Hamilton), for the past two years. He dumps her to marry the boss' daughter so he can further his career. He doesn't even have the courage to tell this to her face - he writes it on the back of a menu at the cafe and leaves before she reads it.This action wounds Ivy (Joan) to the core, and she is about to jump off a bridge one night when she is stopped by a Salvation Army member, Carl Loomis (Clark Gable). The two become friends and pretty soon Ivy is donning a Salvation Army uniform herself. One night a year later, when Ivy and the Salvation Army are proselyting in a nearby town, she runs into her ex-lover Howard Palmer. After a year of separation Howard has decided he would like to have it both ways - he'd like to have his bang (Ivy) and his bucks (his wife of convenience). Will Ivy stand firm on her new beliefs or will she fall?This film does have a few good things going for it. In the first part of the film, when Ivy is still working in the nightclub, we get to see Joan sing and dance for an entire number. She doesn't do much of that in her long film career and it is always a treat. Then there is the somewhat ridiculous spectacle of Clark Gable as a Salvation Army worker - this is before he became known more as a charming sinner rather than a laughing one. You can chalk up that bit of casting to Louis B. Mayer. This film was originally shot with Johnny Mack Brown in the lead, but Mayer didn't like the outcome and reshot it with Gable. Finally there is Neil Hamilton as one of the most slippery characters you'll find. Hard to believe he didn't have a real career breakthrough for almost another 35 years when he was cast as Batman's Commissioner Gordon.This whole issue of the thin line between good and evil in a person and the fact that those two sides exist in everyone is much more artfully explored in 1932's Rain, again starring Joan Crawford. That's a film I highly recommend. As for this one, it is actually more of 2.5/5 stars, so I'm being kind by rounding up to three.As for video and audio quality, I was quite satisfied. The video looks quite sharp, and there is just a little bit of hiss on the audio, but it was very faint. Do remember this is a DVD-R product with no extras and no chapter stops. You can only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments. Also note that no restoration was done for this release - it is whatever happens to be the finest elements in the Warner vault at the time.",3,A subject that was better explored in 1932's Rain,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,2764,"['film', 'probably', 'weakest', 'Gable/Crawford', 'film', 'pairings', 'not', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'just', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'storyline', 'very', 'basic', 'Joan', 'performer', 'nightspot', 'who', 'had', 'long-distance', 'affair', 'going', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'Howard', 'Palmer', 'Neil', 'Hamilton', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'marry', 'boss', 'daughter', 'can', 'further', 'career', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'courage', 'tell', 'face', 'back', 'menu', 'cafe', 'it.This', 'action', 'wounds', 'Ivy', 'Joan', 'core', 'jump', 'off', 'bridge', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'stopped', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'member', 'Carl', 'Loomis', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Ivy', 'donning', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'uniform', 'One', 'night', 'year', 'later', 'when', 'Ivy', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'are', 'proselyting', 'nearby', 'town', 'ex-lover', 'Howard', 'Palmer', 'year', 'separation', 'Howard', 'decided', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'ways', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'bang', 'Ivy', 'bucks', 'wife', 'convenience', 'Will', 'Ivy', 'stand', 'firm', 'new', 'beliefs', 'will', 'fall', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Ivy', 'still', 'working', 'nightclub', 'get', 'see', 'Joan', 'sing', 'dance', 'entire', 'number', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'long', 'film', 'career', 'always', 'treat', 'Then', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'spectacle', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'worker', 'became', 'known', 'more', 'charming', 'sinner', 'rather', 'laughing', 'one', 'can', 'chalk', 'up', 'bit', 'casting', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'Johnny', 'Mack', 'Brown', 'lead', 'Mayer', 'did', ""n't"", 'outcome', 'reshot', 'Gable', 'Finally', 'Neil', 'Hamilton', 'one', 'most', 'slippery', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Hard', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'career', 'breakthrough', 'almost', '35', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'Batman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon.This', 'whole', 'issue', 'thin', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'person', 'fact', 'two', 'sides', 'exist', 'everyone', 'much', 'more', 'artfully', 'explored', '1932', 'Rain', 'again', 'starring', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'actually', 'more', '2.5/5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'being', 'kind', 'rounding', 'up', 'three.As', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'video', 'quite', 'sharp', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'hiss', 'audio', 'was', 'very', 'faint', 'Do', 'remember', 'DVD-R', 'product', 'extras', 'chapter', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'forward', 'backwards', 'ten', 'minute', 'increments', 'Also', 'note', 'restoration', 'was', 'done', 'release', 'happens', 'be', 'finest', 'elements', 'Warner', 'vault', 'time']",N/A

333921,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,630278705X,Martin Asiner,"[9, 10]","By 1931, Joan Crawford had established herself as a serious actress who could play it straight as the heroine in need of being saved or as the hard-edged bitter woman who had others needing being saved from her.  In LAUGHING SINNERS, Crawford is the former who has to hit bottom before she can pull her life together.  Director Harry Beaumont gives us Crawford as Ivy Stevens, a chorus girl who is so in love with a caddish Howard Palmer (Neil Hamilton) that she cannot see that being the mistress of a travelling salesman can promise nothing but heartbreak.  The first third of the film sets up their basic characters.  Crawford simply oozes blind emotion for a man of whom she knows surprisingly little.  She ignores the warning signs that such a transient relation keeps pointing to.  Crawford even treats Howard to an extended dance routine that looks as if it could have been choreographed today.  Here she shows the dancing talent that allowed her to win several real life contests that attracted directors like Beaumont to her in the first place.  Neil Hamilton as Howard keeps feeding her lines of dismissal that must have caused audiences of all generations to shout at the screen for her to wake up.  His oily manner steals more than a few scenes as he stands as a dramatic counterpoint to Crawford's love-struck myopia.  He dumps her using a &quot;Dear Ivy&quot; note.  She is shattered and attempts suicide but is saved by a Salvation Army officer Carl (Clark Gable).  As soon as he saves her body, he tries to save her soul.  Despite his unwillingness to take advantage of her vulnerability, the smoky chemistry between them becomes clear enough, rivalling the real life affair that they were sharing.  The most emotionally satisfying parts of the film center around his attempts to help Ivy regain her moral balance.  Audiences with a long memory will appreciate the brief appearance of the then Little Rascals star Mary Ann Jackson, who, as Betty, helps Ivy to learn that the attempt to help others often results in helping yourself.  Howard makes a predictable return, forcing Ivy to put her new-found inner strength to the test.  What Ivy learns is that initial failure is no sin, and her joining the ranks of the Salvation Army proves that the only sin is permitting yourself to be used by others.  LAUGHING SINNERS is an entertaining film that underscores this often unappreciated truism.",4,Laughing Sinners: The Only Sin is Feeling Sorry for Yourself,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,2407,"['1931', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'had', 'established', 'serious', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'straight', 'heroine', 'need', 'being', 'saved', 'hard-edged', 'bitter', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'others', 'needing', 'being', 'saved', 'LAUGHING', 'SINNERS', 'Crawford', 'former', 'who', 'hit', 'bottom', 'can', 'pull', 'life', 'together', 'Director', 'Harry', 'Beaumont', 'Crawford', 'Ivy', 'Stevens', 'chorus', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'love', 'caddish', 'Howard', 'Palmer', 'Neil', 'Hamilton', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'being', 'mistress', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'can', 'promise', 'nothing', 'heartbreak', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'up', 'basic', 'characters', 'Crawford', 'simply', 'blind', 'emotion', 'man', 'whom', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'warning', 'signs', 'transient', 'relation', 'pointing', 'Crawford', 'even', 'Howard', 'extended', 'dance', 'routine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'choreographed', 'today', 'Here', 'dancing', 'talent', 'allowed', 'win', 'several', 'real', 'life', 'contests', 'attracted', 'directors', 'Beaumont', 'first', 'place', 'Neil', 'Hamilton', 'Howard', 'feeding', 'lines', 'dismissal', 'must', 'have', 'caused', 'audiences', 'generations', 'shout', 'screen', 'wake', 'up', 'oily', 'manner', 'steals', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'counterpoint', 'Crawford', 'love-struck', 'myopia', 'using', 'quot', 'Dear', 'Ivy', 'quot', 'note', 'shattered', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'saved', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'officer', 'Carl', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'As', 'soon', 'body', 'save', 'soul', 'unwillingness', 'take', 'advantage', 'vulnerability', 'smoky', 'chemistry', 'clear', 'enough', 'rivalling', 'real', 'life', 'affair', 'were', 'sharing', 'most', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'parts', 'film', 'center', 'attempts', 'help', 'Ivy', 'regain', 'moral', 'balance', 'Audiences', 'long', 'memory', 'will', 'appreciate', 'brief', 'appearance', 'then', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'star', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Jackson', 'who', 'Betty', 'Ivy', 'learn', 'attempt', 'help', 'others', 'often', 'results', 'helping', 'Howard', 'predictable', 'return', 'forcing', 'Ivy', 'put', 'new-found', 'inner', 'strength', 'test', 'What', 'Ivy', 'initial', 'failure', 'sin', 'joining', 'ranks', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'only', 'sin', 'permitting', 'be', 'used', 'others', 'LAUGHING', 'SINNERS', 'entertaining', 'film', 'often', 'unappreciated', 'truism']",N/A

Mayer had to replace Johnny Mack Brown with Gable-Gable's chemistry with Crawford is incredible and together Gable and Crawford they sizzle even in their Salvation Army uniforms all the way through this motion picture! (Not that there was anything inherently wrong with Johnny Mack's talent as an actor but Gable was a better match for Crawford at least in this film.) At any rate, the plot moves along well and quite a bit happens in this relatively short 72 minute motion picture: the performances by all are terrific and completely convincing; the sets and outdoor filming is great; the choreography and cinematography shine and the musical score, while this is no musical, does enhance the movie. Crawford fans will also love the scenes in which Joan dances up a storm!When the movie starts, we quickly meet caf&eacute; dancer Ivy ""Bunny"" Stevens (Joan Crawford) who's madly in love with philandering traveling salesman Howard ""Howdy"" Palmer (Neil Hamilton); but Ivy doesn't know that ""Howdy"" likes to fool around quite a bit with other women while he's away from her on the road. One night ""Howdy"" decides to tell Ivy--in a ""Dear Jane"" letter--that he's dumping her for his boss's daughter and Ivy is so upset that she decides to end her life.Enter Carl Loomis (Clark Gable), a Salvation Army worker with his own troubled past; Carl stops Ivy just in time from ending her life. At first Ivy isn't grateful but it also isn't long before she and Carl begin a true friendship and we can see that slowly but surely there's more between them although being Salvation Army workers they aren't fast and loose about sleeping together. Things get unexpectedly complicated, however, when Ivy spots ""Howdy"" on the street about a year later and she must choose between going back to ""Howdy"" and her old ways and her much newer lifestyle with Carl and the Salvation Army.Look also for solid performances by the wonderful Marjorie Rambeau as Ruby; Guy Kibbee as Cass Wheeler; Cliff Edwards as Mike; Roscoe Karns as Fred; Gertrude Short as Edna; George Cooper as Joe; George F.

333924,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,630278705X,Simon Davis,"[3, 3]","MGM legends Joan Crawford and Clark Gable always created magic on screen together in their 8 teamings from 1931 to 1940, often regardless of the artistic merits of the films as a whole. 1931's ""Laughing Sinners"", which was their second time together on screen was probably one of their more unusual efforts and only came about because of their dynamic work together in Joan's previous starring effort ""Dance, Fools, Dance"". In that gangster effort the pair made a potent combination in their scenes together despite Gable appearing only in a small supporting role. Their obvious electricity together made MGM decide to scrap most of the footage from Joan's next effort titled ""Complete Surrender"", which had Johnny Mack Brown starring with Joan and largely refilm the whole effort with Clark Gable taking over the part of the saintly Salvation Army Worker who rescues Joan's character from the seamy side of life not once but twice. While it certainly lacks the punch of their sterling work together in their next effort the same year in ""Possessed"", taken on its own level ""Laughing Sinner"", is a interesting snapshot of both performers still ""creating"", themselves and the personas that movie audiences would clamour to see in the succeeding years when the Crawford/Gable combination spelt big box Office for MGM and turned both performers into Hollywood icons.Based on the stage play ""Torch Song"", by Kenyon Nicholson the story of ""Laughing Sinners"", opens with good time girl Ivy Stevens (Joan Crawford),known as ""Bunny"", to her friends working as a singer/dancer in a cafe and having an all consuming relationship; most of the time unfortunately long distance, with travelling salesman Howard Palmer (Neil Hamilton), who spends his life travelling the country , staying in flea bitten hotels and often sampling the local ladies on his stopovers. Despite the unsatisfactory nature of the relationship Ivy loves him totally and when Howard decides to settle down and marry the ""respectable"",girl back home Ivy's whole purpose for living come scrashing down. She attempts to end her life by jumping off a bridge only to be rescued by a Salvation Army Officer named Carl Loomis(Clark Gable). At first cynical of his purpose in ""rescuing"", her Ivy begins to see the good in Carl and the great purpose in his work and before too long she joins the Salvation Army. All goes well for some time until one evening while conducting one of their group meetings on a street corner Ivy happens to be spotted by Howard who is back in town on another of his trips. By this time unhappily married Howard is anxious to rekindle something with Ivy and doesn't for one minute believe her sincerity in getting involved in Carl's work. Ivy finds herself falling yet again for Howard's rather questionable charm despite herself which results in her getting drunk and spending the night with him. At this moment Carl comes to see her and an angry confrontation occurs between Howard and Carl after which Carl shows his sincere regard and indeed love for Ivy by urging her to try again despite her ""lapse"", in living a decent life that has a future.  Realising the two bit, undesirable life she has mistakenly fallen back into with Howard who will never change, Ivy returns to Carl and the work of the Salvation Army which holds the promise of the kind of inclusive and caring future that Ivy now realises she wants above all else.""Laughing Sinners"", could be viewed as preposterous hokum however it is the playing of the three leads that really holds the film together. Much discussion has been made of Clark Gable seemingly being miscast however one must remember that the ""Clark Gable Persona"", that movie goers and film buffs know so well now looking back was of course definately still on the drawing board in 1931 when Gable did many varied types of roles before he settled into the ""Rhett Butler"" image for which he is so famous. It is hard to piture him as a Salvation Army evangelist however he is sincere in his playing and teams as always very well with Joan Crawford. Joan's famous shopgirl image was also only being formed around this time and interestingly ""Laughing Sinners"", captures her during her brief ""blonde phase"", when the blonde look was hugely popular on screen in the early thirties. Joan as always gives her all in the role of Ivy and while she seems more at home in the scenes as the part time girlfriend of Neil Hamilton's character she does display a simple sincerity in those scenes when she joins the Salvation Army and shares scenes with Clark Gable. Neil Hamilton who of course much later won fame for playing Commissioner Gordon on the television classic ""Batman"" in the 1960's does very well as the no good rogue Howard who drives Ivy to attempt suicide and then expects her to come back to him when things dont work out for him on the homefront. His is really the male role with the most dramatic weight to it and he makes an interesting contrast to Gable's character which personifies the basic good that was a requirement in most pictures around this time.  The raw and often sordid life of the 1930's travelling saleman and the women who ""wait"", for them at each of their stops is perhaps the most vivid image to come out of ""Laughing Sinners"", and admittedly the story doesn't hold back from painting a rather unsavoury look at life on the road and the booze, one night stands, and seedy hotels inhabited by men who lead these rather aimless lives with no firm roots anywhere.While no great classic ""Laughing Sinners"" is also not your typical glamourous Crawford/Gable picture either. I does reveals the great combination of Crawford and Gable as a work in progress, still looking for its successful formula. These early 30's film efforts I find have a refreshing ability to show the underbelly of life at that time which often doesn't make a very pretty picture. Certainly ""Laughing Sinners"", has its share of unsavoury and unlikeable characters that while not always terribly realistic do give the film that slight hard edge typical of the early 30's. It also however paints a picture of hope in some scenes which helps make it an interesting viewing experience.
