A movie like this contains the powerful truth that the Gospels are true, despite what so many liberal Christianphobics like Brown and Pagels like to say.  The film you are reading this review is almost as important as The Passion of Christ.  The film is not perfect, no film is, but God is indeed here in this film.  I don't want to go over the acting or the scenes, instead of that, I wish to explore the worldview of the film.  The worldview is this: Through Christ, change can come.  No matter who you are, no matter what situation in life you are in, God can change your life and show the power of grace, forgiveness, and holiness.  Though the brave men were killed, the story did not end.  God does not end in death.  God is eternal and God is powerful.  The movie explores how hope can shine even in the darkest of circumstances, something we need to realize in this post-9-11 world.  I hope, truly hope, that you will give this movie a chance and when the movie is over, when you sit back and consider what you just saw, that you will bring your Bible out and read the messages of the Gospels--that there is indeed good news for all of us through Jesus Christ who is the Way, the Truth, and the Light and  the Life.  This is an encouraging film and a film that anyone who is considering going into the ministry, especially the ministry field of missionary work, needs to see.  God calls us to leave family, life, home, and take up the cross, when we say goodbye, it is not a goodbye forever, as seen in this movie.  For I know by faith and by trust that the wives will see their husbands again, the children their fathers again.

In 1956, Nate Saint and his family were there as Peace Corps workers (no church, so can't be classified as missionaries), and he piloted a bright yellow plane.  He located the indigenous people but his plane scared them so that they killed some of their own tribe in a frenzy.  All they knew was to spear someone else, and yet they were able to tame birds.  When Nate took four of his co-workers to try to talk with these people, a miscommunication led to the attack by the natives.  All five were speared.  A cloudburst accompanied the slaughter as God wept.It rained a lot in that rain forest just as it does at Cherokee, North Carolina.  A search party in canoes with a helicopted hovering overhead found the damaged plane and the bodies.  They go in jeeps to deliver the bad news to the families.  There were no survivors, they were told.  Steve was just a young fellow when this happened.  His mother stayed on and acted as nurse with others until polio took many lives and the village was quarantined,  as the spirits were angered at the violence.  It is always darkest before dawn.  It was a battle between God and their spirits.  God always wins.Two of the natives return to civilization with Steve's family and they intermarry.  He had always felt thta he was responsible for avenging his father's death.  Thus, in 1994, he located the man who had killed Nate at the end of the spear, and told him ""No one took my father's life -- he gave it.""  That was worst than being speared himself, as his deed had been all in vain.

I'll watch them if they're told well--Narnia's a recent example, too--and will give them positive reviews (as indicated here) if they don't hammer me over the head with symbolism or an overly-righteous message. I'm also not a supporter of missionaries who take it upon themselves to ""save the souls of savages"" by inflicting their values of right and wrong on a culture that's survived and thrived for longer than any of us could imagine. Even so, END OF THE SPEAR is a moral message that speaks succinctly to the viewer without going overboard (with one exception that I'll point out in a minute).The story is of Christian missionaries who try and stop the warring Waodani tribe that've been killing themselves for millennia. Family feuds and the need for well-bred women are usually the causes of these deadly incursions. The missionaries believe that the Waodani may be on the brink of extinction (something I have a bit of trouble believing but swallowed nonetheless).Nate Saint (Chad Allen) is one of these missionaries and he and three other men find a Waodani tribe and decide to make contact with them by landing a plane on a small beach outcropping. Once the meeting takes place, a fast-forward set of circumstances results in the death of all the missionary men. Left behind is young Steve Saint (Chase Ellison), Nate's preteen son, who years later finds the tribesman (Louie Leonardo as Mincayani) who killed his father. A battle of self-will, justice, and Godly wisdom soon presents itself and young Steve (now grown) has to decide what his father would've wanted.This is what appealed to me. Not the religious connotations, but the growing understanding of a young man that killing the man who killed his father would not only solve nothing, but instead would go against everything his father stood for (not necessarily what God stood for).My biggest beef with the story are the aforementioned ""saving the souls of savages"" (Did Christianity do anything for Native Americans?) and a scene involving what happened to Steve's father after he was speared. This scene was the only ""forced"" one that tried too hard to shove God down the viewer's throat. It wasn't needed. Those who believe in God would've gotten the message regardless, and those who don't still would've benefitted from the morality being focused on.The positives, though, far outweigh anything negative I could say. The cinematography of the Amazon rainforest is fairly breathtaking and a message of ""no war"" is definitely something we all need to be cognizant of, especially with what's going on in Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Palestine, Kosovo, and many other locations.This is a good film.

979997,AS56N6FYEQ12U,B000EXDS4I,coinman,"[6, 11]","I saw this movie when it first came out in theater, and it was well worth the cost of the ticket. It is a very captivating story, and the large screen filling most of your vision plus the sound coming from all around you really draws you into the story. I have heard and read much about this story from multiple viewpoints, but actually ""seeing"" it made it even more real to me.In my opinion, the movie was acted out very well. I have heard that the Waorani were actually played by Indians from Panama, so that would probably make it slightly more realistic that using Americans would have.One of my main problems with the movie is not with the movie itself, but with the choice of actors. The main character (Nate Saint) is played by an open homosexual. Couldn't they have found a man of better reputation to play the part of a godly Christian man? To me this seems like just another chance to rub homosexuality into the faces of Christians. Besides, I was told that it was actually Steve Saint who flew the airplane as Nate Saint, yet ""Nate"" was shown close up in the airplane and there was no obvious difference in looks between the two ""Nates"". Why couldn't they just have had Steve play the entire role and saved themselves some work? I guess maybe Steve didn't want to play the part, but either way, I still think that a better actor could (""should""?) have been chosen.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this movie and definitely want to watch it again. I highly recommend this video, as well as the documentary ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"", based on the book by Elisabeth Elliot, wife of Jim Elliot (another of the five martyrs). This is a documentary, so it is not quite as enjoyable, but it still contains much interesting material expressed in a factual manner, with many interview clips with the five widows as well as members of the search party.

979998,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B000EXDS4I,"Colorgirl ""Spreading color around my world""","[36, 39]","END OF THE SPEAR is about what sounds like a relatively mundane story. Five US citizens set out to Ecuador to try to befriend what at that time was considered to be the most violent tribe on the planet at the time. It appeared that the US citizen were making progress when suddenly the tribe went ballistic on them and murdered them in cold blood.It was in 1956 and the news blared across the world. Most older people will remember that story well. There was a large photo spread and coverage in LIFE MAGAZINE and it was quite the talk of the world for a while.After these men were murdered, some of the wives of the murdered men went to live (touting their young children) with the tribe as a sort of an oxymoron- to get something out of their husband's lives being given up- so that they would not have died in vain.Eventually, the tribe had a huge transformation and they are completely different people today.Sounds kind of boring - at least it did to me- why would I want to see such a story? I mean these men knew what they were getting in to (4 or 5 other men were murdered in the previous decade so they knew what they were up against), I was puzzled as to the big shock of the murders..........END OF THE SPEAR is the story told from the more compassionate and youthful perspective of Steve Saint, son of Nate Saint, one of the murdered US citizens. Instead of the dry statistical account of the situation, suddenly I found myself experiencing the entire event as if Nate Saint was my father and I was his son.This story is told from the perspective of the Waodani tribe who open themselves up with a childlikeness that's both beautiful and disarming.When asked in a filmed documentary to describe what their lives were like before the murders (I was fortunate to see some interviews on television before the movie came out- you can see them and more in the documentary BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR), they list the lifestyle of unending murders that plagued their people almost to the point of extinction. Accounts of each murder in the history of each tribe member is reenacted with animation and detail- every person in the tribe lost many family members due to the constant stream of cold blooded killing.When a man in a family died, it was customary to bury the youngest child or child of choice by the father or mother with the dead or dying man ALIVE. One could only imagine how each child would die a frightening and painfully slow death. (knowing that before you see the movie might be helpful).To break that cycle, one of the tribe's girls runs away to outsiders so that she will not have to die that way with her father who clamors for her company in his grave.This escaped girl moves in with Rachel Saint and other women there (Rachel is Nate's sister) and learns English and how to live in the new culture which was so foreign to her.It was some time later that the five men came to make friends with the tribe. They intended to teach them that there was another way to live besides constant murder and death. Several tribe members came to meet the men and wanted to see their sister Dayume (played by Christina Souza). The language barrier made the situation frustrating. When one of the natives lied out of fear when he returned to the tribe, this led to the murder of the men.Mincaya (full name Mincayani- played by Louie Leonardo) was the man who murdered Nate Saint. After befriending Mincaya, Steve (both Nate and Steve are played by Chad Allen whom you might remember from Dr. Quinn, and Our House TV series) has to deal with the fury and confusion of suddenly finding out that his friend is the one that brought him the most pain.I have written a more extensive review at Epinions(dot)com of this movie with in depth information about the movie, background and cast if you are interested in reading it.Suffice it to say that after many bad movies telling stories of similar nature, I was expecting this movie to be substandard.  I was shocked at how moving and intense it really is.The critic reviews were completely unfounded and everyone we talked to outside the theater after the viewing said the same thing- and they were from VERY diverse backgrounds.  Different religions, different perspectives, different political persuasions.....I was intrigued by the way that this movie affected everyone we talked to that went.I can not recommend this film highly enough- and the fact that this little tribe of people gave up their time and privacy because they were concerned about the US becoming what they used to be due to violence says volumes.This movie is not like any other movie I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend viewing the documentary (Beyond the Gates of Splendor) before you see the movie as it enhances the movie even more.  If you can not see it, however, the movie stands very well on its own.We were able to rent the documentary at a local Movie Gallery.",5,"I NEVER Spend Full Price On Movies, But I Did TWICE For This

980000,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B000EXDS4I,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[75, 94]","Growing up a Protestant kid in the 80's I tripped over the story of Nate Saint, Jim Elliot and the three other missionaries who were brutally murdered by the Waorani people in 1956. It is the tragic story that caused a sensation in the United States. Not because the men died in vain, but because the wives of these men reached out to these violent people and changed their lives forever. It's a story that captivated me. In fact when I was eleven I told many people that I one day wanted to make a movie about these very people. To my surprise THE END OF THE SPEAR came along and does just that.SPEAR tells the tale from the vantage point of young Steve Saint (Chase Ellison), Nate Saints (Chad Allen) pre-teen son, and Mincayani (Louie Leonardo) the Waorani leader whom killed Nate Saint with his own spear. It begins as the Waorani people are on the verge of the extinction. Their violent society has the Ecuadoran government ready to go in and kill them all, and their warlike ways have made them unable to survive very long anyway. It's only when Saint's wife (Cara Stoner) and sister Rachel (Sara Kathryn Bakker) move into the tribe and attempt to reach out to the Waorani women that redemption begin to take hold.I walked into SPEAR with very little expectation. You have to understand I have seen hundreds of horrible ""Christian"" films. Most are not worth the film they are printed on. But SPEAR works. Yes it's got some very clunky scenes, the dialogue is a tad bit simplistic, but it has a dramatic tension I wasn't quite expecting. I was actually moved by scenes. I rooted for characters and did not feel talked down to. SPEAR is not a movie about saving souls, it's a movie about characters. It is the kind of movie that if given a chance will spark debate and inspiration. It's motive seems innocent and not heavy handed.The cinematography while simple by Hollywood's standard is effective. The score doesn't get in the way, and Director Jim Hannon fills his story with just enough detail that it's believable. He gets performances out of his actors that are simple and understated. It's not Oscar caliber, but that's not to be expected. The dialogue works, even if the Subtitles seem to rob the Waorani language of any real nuance, it's simple and get us from point A to point B as well as it can. There were moments I wanted to movie to explain the motives of it characters a little better. But for what it's worth SPEAR is still effective.My qualms with the casting of Chase Ellison as Young Steve should also be noted. Some heavy scenes fall on this young boy and unfortunately he doesn't have the chops to hold it on his shoulders. A better child actor should have been sought. Casting children can be very hard. But the only scenes I didn't buy fell on this poor kid to vocalize and the poor material stuck out like a sore thumb.I also hated the ending. It hurt the picture. There must have been a more powerful way of ending it. But unfortunately it pushed the story into the melodramatic range. It also introduced a supernatural twist that needed an explanation. We saw the scene earlier and these events didn't occur, why now? Hopefully this sour ending will not hurt the rest of the picture for most audiences. I for one was a little disappointed.But all in all END OF THE SPEAR is not a bad film. It has its flaws. But at its heart it's the kind of movie that will inspire those whom let it.

980009,A3P2ROVW7YWQGJ,B000EXDS4I,Encompassed Runner,"[7, 8]","The very first line of ""End of the Spear"" reveals what apparently many are not getting: that this version of the well-known account of the missionaries to the Waodani is not primarily about the Waodani, nor the missionaries, nor a 4-point gospel message, but about both the glorious end of a journey for Steve Saint, the orphaned son of missionary pilot Nate and the equally glorious end of a journey for Mincayane the Waodani tribesman who plunged the spear into Steve's dad.  Failing to understand this could lead to viewer disappointment that there is no verbal gospel message or clear depiction of the present situation with the Waodani as a whole.  The special relationship of little Stevie and his father is palpably conveyed.  Before Nate Saint and the other 4 missionaries flew off to what would be their death, little Stevie teaches his dad a sentence in Waodani that would be his poignant last words.  And when Stevie asks his dad if they'd use their guns to defend themselves if attacked, his dad says, ""Son we can't shoot the Waodani, they're not ready for heaven, we are.""  And so it happens, after befriending the Waodani, 2 young tribal lovers go off together, and as an alibi upon their return, they blame their disappearance on an attack by the missionaries, and this misinformation leads to the missionaries' martyrdom--a depiction that is true to actuality, as from having seen the documentary ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" and its live footage, I can say that the missionaries left behind detailed notes and video of the events of that day, the camera was rolling.  And so the journeys of the orphaned son and the murderer begin.  The spectacularly poignant closure for both Steve and Mincayane is at the very end of the movie and comes after marvelous new revelations of Nate Saint's death, which bring a ceasing or end to the metaphorical spear that pierced son Steve and also a ceasing of the use of the spear by Mincayane and his tribe, which had been so violent that more than half of the Waodani tribal population died by intratribal spearing.  The Christian viewer is reminded of He who Himself was speared at Calvary and thru whom we have access to grace from the Father of the fatherless, even grace at the point of death and also grace in our grief.  For the nonChristian viewer, the movie may seem quite absurd--having a gun, yet instead laying down one's life to be killed by the very people to be helped.  But perhaps this very absurdity portrays a sacrificial love so radical that it will attract, that it will soften the heart, or to mix metaphors, prepare the soil that the seed of the gospel might later be planted.  Not everything has to be a 4-point plan of salvation.  It's about the son, yet still about the Son.",5,Missing the Point (Pun Intended):  A father/son story becomes a Father/son story....,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,2754,"['very', 'first', 'line', 'End', 'Spear', 'what', 'apparently', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'version', 'well-known', 'account', 'missionaries', 'Waodani', 'not', 'primarily', 'Waodani', 'missionaries', '4-point', 'gospel', 'message', 'glorious', 'end', 'journey', 'Steve', 'Saint', 'orphaned', 'son', 'missionary', 'pilot', 'Nate', 'equally', 'glorious', 'end', 'journey', 'Mincayane', 'Waodani', 'tribesman', 'who', 'plunged', 'spear', 'Steve', 'dad', 'Failing', 'understand', 'could', 'lead', 'viewer', 'disappointment', 'verbal', 'gospel', 'message', 'clear', 'depiction', 'present', 'situation', 'Waodani', 'whole', 'special', 'relationship', 'little', 'Stevie', 'father', 'palpably', 'conveyed', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'other', '4', 'missionaries', 'flew', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'death', 'little', 'Stevie', 'dad', 'sentence', 'Waodani', 'would', 'be', 'poignant', 'last', 'words', 'when', 'Stevie', 'dad', ""'d"", 'use', 'guns', 'defend', 'attacked', 'dad', 'Son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'Waodani', ""'re"", 'not', 'ready', 'heaven', 'are', 'befriending', 'Waodani', '2', 'young', 'tribal', 'lovers', 'go', 'together', 'alibi', 'return', 'blame', 'disappearance', 'attack', 'missionaries', 'misinformation', 'missionaries', 'martyrdom', 'depiction', 'true', 'actuality', 'having', 'seen', 'documentary', 'Gates', 'Splendor', 'live', 'footage', 'can', 'say', 'missionaries', 'left', 'behind', 'detailed', 'notes', 'video', 'events', 'day', 'camera', 'was', 'rolling', 'so', 'journeys', 'orphaned', 'son', 'murderer', 'begin', 'spectacularly', 'poignant', 'closure', 'Steve', 'Mincayane', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'marvelous', 'new', 'revelations', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'death', 'bring', 'ceasing', 'end', 'metaphorical', 'spear', 'pierced', 'son', 'Steve', 'also', 'ceasing', 'use', 'spear', 'Mincayane', 'tribe', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'violent', 'more', 'half', 'Waodani', 'tribal', 'population', 'died', 'intratribal', 'spearing', 'Christian', 'viewer', 'reminded', 'who', 'was', 'speared', 'Calvary', 'thru', 'whom', 'have', 'access', 'grace', 'Father', 'fatherless', 'even', 'grace', 'point', 'death', 'also', 'grace', 'grief', 'nonChristian', 'viewer', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'quite', 'absurd', 'having', 'gun', 'yet', 'instead', 'laying', 'down', 'one', 'life', 'be', 'killed', 'very', 'people', 'be', 'helped', 'perhaps', 'very', 'absurdity', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'so', 'radical', 'will', 'attract', 'will', 'soften', 'heart', 'mix', 'metaphors', 'prepare', 'soil', 'seed', 'gospel', 'might', 'later', 'be', 'planted', 'Not', 'everything', 'be', '4-point', 'plan', 'salvation', 'son', 'yet', 'still', 'Son']",End Of The Spear

But one such movie is ""End of the Spear,"" which tells the story of 5 missionaries who have on their hearts to visit the Waodani tribe of Ecuador to bring them Jesus Christ. However, the Waodani are known primarily for being in the process of killing themselves off because of their murderous way. Things begin well, but when some of the younger members lie about what they had seen and heard involving the strangers who have come to visit the Waodani turn on the missionaries.This would seem to be the end of the story, except that the remainder of the film demonstrates how the love of Christ, over time, can win over even a tribe such as the Waodani. In fact, it is it the love of Christ that compelled the 5 missionaries in the first place, and that then compels the surviving members of their family ultimately to live among the Waodani to show them the love of God.""End of the Spear"" is made even more compelling because it's based on the well-known true story of Nate Saint, Jim Eliot, and others who actually lived and died what this movie portrays. It's a powerful story of the love of Christ as demonstrated in His people, a love so strong that even a murderous tribe can find life at the end of the spear. The movie would have been great anyway, but knowing it's based on a real story makes even more of an impact on my life as I try to live out the love of Christ.I was afraid that ""End of the Spear"" might mar a naturally excellent story by either cheesy production values and acting or by being too obvious in its message. However, the movie is professionally done, and I never felt as if the characters were merely actors. If anything, the Christian nature of the missionary families is too understated. The movie assumes that the audience is already familiar with the Christian message and what would make someone go to a remote and violent village to bring them a message of peace and love.I plan on showing ""End of the Spear"" to the guys in the Christian high school where I teach as an inspiration for the kind of love and courage to which God is calling them.It's a violent movie, and so it's not for younger viewers.

The director Jim Hanon has mastered the elements of his film - story, character development, atmosphere of place - and the result is a visually stunning little film that is touching without being mawkish.Nate Saint (Chad Allen), his wife Elizabeth (Beth Bailey) and son Steve (Chase Ellison) are missionaries living in the  jungles of Ecuador.  A tribe of Indians, the Waodani, is self-destructing due to a long custom of 'spearing' their fellow Indians with whom they have contentions.  Fearing that the tribe will become extinct, Nate and his fellow missionary buddies fly a small craft into the area of the Amazon to befriend the Indians.  There they encounter Mincayani (Louie Leonardo), Kimo (Jack Guzman), and Dayumae (Christina Souza) among the other tribesmen.  The Waodani don't trust the foreigners and in an act of missionary aid they kill the missionary men. The family of Nate is devastated as are the wives and children of the other missionaries and they decide to move into the village to prove their husband's good intentions. The struggle and eventual coming together of these two 'tribes' of peoples forms the storyline and speaks of forgiveness, need, love and survival.The story is simple but beautiful and the acting is very good.  Some may quibble about the use of non-Indian actors (who too obviously maintain well-shaved faces and buff bodies) and the use of a language not always translated in the subtitles, but the overall effect of the movie is one of nature and the lessons to be learned in the interaction of two types of cultures.

980013,A3HYCGZ5CKCZIH,B000EXDS4I,"G. T. Howell ""neogalahad""","[17, 18]","""End of the Spear"" is the story of five American missionaries who were speared to death while trying to contact the fierce Waodani tribe (also called the Aucas) in 1956 Ecuador.  The film relates how, even after this tragic loss, their wives remained committed to reaching the Waodani people.  Years later, the son of one of the martyred men returns to the tribe and struggles to forgive the men who killed his father.For many years this event, as related in Elisabeth Elliot's book ""Through Gates of Splendor"", has inspired generations of Christians to lives of missionary zeal and selfless service.  The film beautifully captures the poignant drama of this moving story.  The cinematography and music are superb, and the performances are excellent.  The native actors do a splendid job, and the film is a fascinating study of the (then) lawless and violent Waodani culture.  The script hits the right emotional notes without being syrupy, and the story is skillfully told.What keeps this movie from being a five-star film isn't what's IN the film, but what MISSING - a clear presentation of the Gospel that the missionaries were willing to die to proclaim.  This retelling alludes to the Gospel in a murky way, but one could easily get the impression that the missionaries merely wanted to end the Waodani's murderous ways and make them ""better people"".  A few might even think that they were interfering, Western do-gooders who got what they deserved when they tried to interfere with Waodani culture.  In reality, they had come to tell the Waodani people that they needed God to forgive them and give them new hearts -- that God loved them, and that by sending His Son Jesus to die as a sacrifice He provided the way of salvation for all who will repent of their sins and put their faith and trust in Christ's atoning blood and triumphant resurrection.The viewer never learns about the true passion that compelled these five families to leave the comfort of America and risk their lives.  In fact, other than the Saints, too little screen time is spent on getting to know the missionary families.  Having read ""Shadow of the Almighty"", the biography of Jim Elliot, I was looking forward to seeing him portrayed on film.  I actually had a hard time figuring out which one he was!  The scene where the missionaries are killed is powerful and shocking, but we feel for them only because they seem like nice guys.  The scene would have carried more impact if the script had helped us get to know them as individuals.The film has also been plagued by the controversy surrounding the producers' unfortunate (and in my view unwise) decision to fill a key role with an actor whose advocacy of an immoral lifestyle has been very public.  For the record, I thought his performance was very believable, and his voiceover narration seemed heart-felt.  I think I would probably have enjoyed the movie more had I not known of his background, though.  It's sad that the movie-makers undermined their own film (and probably their box office) by not exercising more discernment.Controversy aside, Christians who already know the ""back story"" will appreciate this film, but will probably feel frustrated by the missed opportunity to tell the story in all its fullness.",4,Moving film that could have been more - 3+1/2 stars.,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,3254,"['End', 'Spear', 'story', 'five', 'American', 'missionaries', 'who', 'were', 'speared', 'death', 'trying', 'contact', 'fierce', 'Waodani', 'tribe', 'also', 'called', 'Aucas', '1956', 'Ecuador', 'film', 'how', 'even', 'tragic', 'loss', 'wives', 'remained', 'committed', 'reaching', 'Waodani', 'people', 'Years', 'later', 'son', 'one', 'martyred', 'men', 'returns', 'tribe', 'struggles', 'forgive', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'father.For', 'many', 'years', 'event', 'related', 'Elisabeth', 'Elliot', 'book', 'Gates', 'Splendor', 'inspired', 'generations', 'Christians', 'lives', 'missionary', 'zeal', 'selfless', 'service', 'film', 'beautifully', 'poignant', 'drama', 'moving', 'story', 'cinematography', 'music', 'are', 'superb', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'native', 'actors', 'do', 'splendid', 'job', 'film', 'fascinating', 'study', 'then', 'lawless', 'violent', 'Waodani', 'culture', 'script', 'right', 'emotional', 'notes', 'being', 'syrupy', 'story', 'skillfully', 'told.What', 'movie', 'being', 'five-star', 'film', ""n't"", 'what', 'IN', 'film', 'what', 'MISSING', 'clear', 'presentation', 'Gospel', 'missionaries', 'were', 'willing', 'die', 'proclaim', 'retelling', 'alludes', 'Gospel', 'murky', 'way', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'impression', 'missionaries', 'merely', 'wanted', 'end', 'Waodani', 'murderous', 'ways', 'make', 'better', 'people', 'few', 'might', 'even', 'think', 'were', 'interfering', 'Western', 'do-gooders', 'who', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'when', 'tried', 'interfere', 'Waodani', 'culture', 'reality', 'had', 'come', 'tell', 'Waodani', 'people', 'needed', 'God', 'forgive', 'give', 'new', 'hearts', 'God', 'loved', 'sending', 'Son', 'Jesus', 'die', 'sacrifice', 'provided', 'way', 'salvation', 'who', 'will', 'repent', 'sins', 'put', 'faith', 'trust', 'Christ', 'atoning', 'blood', 'triumphant', 'resurrection.The', 'viewer', 'never', 'true', 'passion', 'compelled', 'five', 'families', 'leave', 'comfort', 'America', 'risk', 'lives', 'fact', 'other', 'Saints', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'getting', 'know', 'missionary', 'families', 'Having', 'read', 'Shadow', 'Almighty', 'biography', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'portrayed', 'film', 'actually', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'one', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'missionaries', 'are', 'killed', 'powerful', 'shocking', 'feel', 'only', 'seem', 'nice', 'guys', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'more', 'impact', 'script', 'had', 'helped', 'get', 'know', 'individuals.The', 'film', 'also', 'been', 'plagued', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'producers', 'unfortunate', 'view', 'unwise', 'decision', 'fill', 'key', 'role', 'actor', 'advocacy', 'immoral', 'lifestyle', 'been', 'very', 'public', 'record', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'seemed', 'heart-felt', 'think', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'background', 'though', 'sad', 'movie-makers', 'undermined', 'own', 'film', 'probably', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'exercising', 'more', 'discernment.Controversy', 'aside', 'Christians', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'story', 'fullness']",End Of The Spear

Perhaps my expectations were a little high, but I was disappointed in this movie.  The picture is shot beautifully and the acting is adequate, but the heart of the story of those young, idealistic, earnest missionaries is lost.  Other than Nate Saint, the missionaries are portrayed, if you could call it that, as bumbling, silly guys.  They really take a back seat to the members of the Waodani tribe.  This is the focus of the film--how dangerous and murderous these people were--and this is where the film is the strongest.  I wanted to know more about the five missionaries, though--what motivated them to reach out to the tribe, what were their beliefs, what were their fears?  These characters aren't developed at all, so when they are killed, it didn't hit me like it would have had I felt like I ""knew"" these men. The film also doesn't do a very good job of portraying Rachel Saint and Elisabeth Elliot living among the people and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with them.  That is what led to the change of heart for the tribe, according to the true story.  I would recommend the DVD ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" to those who want to know more of the story.

980016,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B000EXDS4I,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[1, 1]","This movie had some problems, but provided some excellent insights about missionary work. The movie is based on the real story about Jim Elliot and four other missionaries' deaths. The movie is based on the book of event written by the pilot of the group, Nate Saint. The story is told from the viewpoint of two families: the first an amazon warrior and Steve Saint, who was the son of Nate Saint. One of the insights was how the amazon tribe was in a downward spiral of violence that would have ended in extinction for the tribe. Christianity provided the tribe an escape from that spiral of violence.  The second point is how the death of these missionaries brought benefits to both families and to the tribe as a whole. The warrior who killed Saint's father, ended up being the adopted grandfather of the Saint's children. This warrior, due to his conversion to Christianity, had his own grandchildren. This would have been impossible without something changing in the life of the tribe. In sum, the story is about bravery and forgiveness.There are some inconsistencies and the plot was hard to follow at times. The conversations were hard to hear as well sometimes.

980018,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B000EXDS4I,J. Michael,"[2, 6]","In 1956, 5 naive American missionaries (of unnamed sect) dragged their young families to the back of beyond in order to make contact with and proselytize the Huaorani, a minuscule tribe of incredibly violent jungle savages. Upon finally discovering the whereabouts of this elusive tribe, the 5 missionaries land their plane in the middle of Huaorani territory and, because they were unarmed and did not speak a word of the Indians' language, promptly get themselves speared to death. I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but I would have been embarrassed to dramatize this story if one of these men were my father. All their foolish deaths accomplished was to be a lesson as to how_not_to run a mission or make contact with primitive peoples. Their subsequent actions of the widow and sister of two of the men were considerably more prudent, as they at least had a translator and some language skills when they went to make contact with the Huaorani. I know I should have been judging the movie on its own merits, but I just couldn't get past my problems with the central purpose and methods of our protagonists.In the first place, I just can't understand why- in a time when a rapidly de-Christianizing Western world and an atheistic Soviet Bloc were on the verge of obliterating the planet in a nuclear cataclysm, these people felt the need to drag drag their wives and children to the middle of the Ecuadorian jungle and spend so much time and energy trying to convert such an insignificant portion of humanity. Surely there were more desperate fields for evangelism back in North America, a place where these hapless missionaries at least spoke the language and could have made a bigger difference. I'm not saying the Huaorani didn't deserve to hear the Gospel, but these folks should have gone where they could have had the most impact; St. Paul went to Athens and Rome, not the North Pole. More locally attuned missionaries would have reached the Huaorani eventually; were our protagonists afraid the Catholics would get there first? Secondly, I just can't get over the pathetic manner in which these men threw their lives away, or at least how it was depicted in the movie. They brought a gun but didn't use it, even to scare the Huaorani warriors. They didn't speak the Huaorani language but somehow expected to convert them with funny faces, hand gestures and airplane rides. Whoever let these men conduct such an immature and ill-prepared venture should have been put in jail.It's also unfortunate that we couldn't see the disastrous aftermath of Rachel Saint and Elisabeth Eliot's admittedly brave missionary efforts. With the support of the Ecuadorian government and US oil companies, these women helped herd the Huaorani onto a reservation where they were remade into good little American evangelicals. (I wonder how they've taken to blue blazers and khakis). Western disease has reduced the Huaorani population to around 2,000 today (from 25,000 after WWII), their cultural identity has been obliterated and their former lands have been exploited by the government and the oil companies. An interesting back story would have been the reason why Rachel Saint was ordered to retire by the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics, the evangelical group which sponsored the mission) and why the SIL itself was subsequently expelled from the country. The American evangelical movement however, with its ever-increasing transformation into a Republican PAC, is so desperate to hang on to its eroding spiritual identity that it latched unto this story as its own, edited and mythologized it into the whitewashed version portrayed in this movie.As for the film itself, it was a beautiful thing to watch, with the native people and their lush natural environment being captured quite exquisitely, if at a slow pace.

Corn ""reviewer""","[5, 7]","This film has some uneven moments and flaws but it is so superior, especially when it comes to thoughtful exploration of ethics, values and how one approachs people of a different culture and background, that it is worth seeing. However, there is definitely some violence, even though nothing graphic is shown on screen. I can't say too much for fear of giving away the plot but I think younger children could be scared by some of what is implied, if not actually shown.The basic storyline is based on an actual incident involving missionaries who are trying to make contact with an isolated tribe. I found it intriguing that NOT ONCE was the word ""Jesus"" used in this movie (or, if it was, it must have been only once, because I missed it). Instead, the plot revolves around themes of how one lives in the world and where and when violence is justified.THe movie could have been preachy, simplistic and patronizing. Because it was made so that families could see it, it WAS probably ""cleaned up"" a bit and some of the more graphic violence was left out.But there is still plenty of heft to this film. It doesn't veer away from tackling difficult issues, including questions about how ethical it was to interfere with a tribe that was not used to Americans. There is tragedy and heartbreak.Several points of view are expressed here and there is far more balance than in a typical Christian film...there is NO overt message being driven home or stated. Everything is implied. This makes for a powerful and moving film and one which may be found more accessable by all viewers, not just Christians. Christians, however, may take issue with the fact that Jesus is not overtly discussed, although it doesn't take much to understand that the film is focusing on Christian missionaries and their interaction with a tribe who doesn't have any idea of Jesus- they have their own religious beliefs.At the end of the DVD, there is some footage with the son of the man who first ministered to the Indian tribe, footage which reflects on our own culture (and not so positively). There are shots of grocery stores and talk about how little people in America have to do to get food, unlike the Indians who have to hunt their food, prepare it and who also have no access to such conveniences as grocery stores, cars, escalators and elevators.Watch this one with older children and you may well end up talking about how different cultures view the world, how they live- and why.",4,Not for young children but definitely a family film,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2462,"['film', 'uneven', 'moments', 'flaws', 'so', 'superior', 'especially', 'when', 'thoughtful', 'exploration', 'ethics', 'values', 'how', 'one', 'approachs', 'people', 'different', 'culture', 'background', 'worth', 'seeing', 'However', 'definitely', 'violence', 'even', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'shown', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'think', 'younger', 'children', 'could', 'be', 'scared', 'what', 'implied', 'not', 'actually', 'shown.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'based', 'actual', 'incident', 'involving', 'missionaries', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'contact', 'isolated', 'tribe', 'found', 'intriguing', 'NOT', 'ONCE', 'was', 'word', 'Jesus', 'used', 'movie', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'once', 'missed', 'Instead', 'plot', 'themes', 'how', 'one', 'world', 'where', 'when', 'violence', 'justified.THe', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'preachy', 'simplistic', 'patronizing', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'families', 'could', 'see', 'WAS', 'probably', 'cleaned', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'graphic', 'violence', 'was', 'left', 'out.But', 'still', 'plenty', 'heft', 'film', ""n't"", 'veer', 'away', 'tackling', 'difficult', 'issues', 'including', 'questions', 'how', 'ethical', 'was', 'interfere', 'tribe', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'Americans', 'tragedy', 'heartbreak.Several', 'points', 'view', 'are', 'expressed', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'balance', 'typical', 'Christian', 'film', 'NO', 'overt', 'message', 'being', 'driven', 'home', 'stated', 'Everything', 'implied', 'powerful', 'moving', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'more', 'accessable', 'viewers', 'not', 'just', 'Christians', 'Christians', 'however', 'may', 'take', 'issue', 'fact', 'Jesus', 'not', 'overtly', 'discussed', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'understand', 'film', 'focusing', 'Christian', 'missionaries', 'interaction', 'tribe', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'Jesus-', 'have', 'own', 'religious', 'end', 'DVD', 'footage', 'son', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'ministered', 'Indian', 'tribe', 'footage', 'own', 'culture', 'not', 'so', 'positively', 'are', 'shots', 'grocery', 'stores', 'talk', 'how', 'little', 'people', 'America', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'food', 'Indians', 'who', 'have', 'hunt', 'food', 'prepare', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'access', 'such', 'conveniences', 'grocery', 'stores', 'cars', 'escalators', 'elevators.Watch', 'one', 'older', 'children', 'may', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'talking', 'how', 'different', 'cultures', 'view', 'world', 'how', 'live-', 'why']",End Of The Spear

980026,A329ALHKYK62O7,B000EXDS4I,Ky. Col.,"[0, 0]","""End of the Spear"" is based on the true story of the murder of five missionaries by natives in Equador in 1956.  Rather then hate those who killed their relatives, some of the missionaries' family members went on not only to forgive them but to continue mission work amongst them. The story is told from the perspective of Steve Saint who's dad was one of the missionaries speared on that fateful day as well as from the perspective of the native who later befriended the son of the man he killed.  I should note that the climax--although powerful--was partly fictional in the sense that Steve already knew who speared his father while living amongst the Auca (Wawoni [spelling?]) as a child.  In the film, Steve only learns the identity when he returns to Equador in 1994.Apart from the remarkable story of Christian love and forgiveness, the film is well made.  The acting is quite good and the cinematography is excellent with impressive aerial scenes.  The jungle seems alive with both danger and sometimes breathtaking beauty.  The use of language seems very authentically done with the missionaries speaking English while other characters speak either native language or Spanish with English subtitles.  Overall ""End of the Spear"" is an excellent if very sad film.

The Waodani are a very violent primitive people whose response to things that threaten them (and there are many), is to be suspicious and to kill their enemies with the spear. ""Spear them! Spear them!"" The missionaries make contact, actually hoping to prevent the slaughter of these indigenous peoples by the Ecuadorian government for killing oil prospectors who wander into their territory. (The anti-oil people will love them briefly for this reason alone.) The missionaries are speared, but the response from the families of the missionaries is to go, live among and help them. In the end, the Waodani give up the spear as they learn a new way of living by forgiving. Thus it is the end of the ""spear"" way of life, no more ""spear them! spear them!""; but rather ""Love them!

Still a tribe untouched by the modern world, they lived deep in the jungle. Unfortunately, they were constantly fighting other tribes and even each other. All the violence meant that life expectancy was very short for the males.While they knew little of the outside world, the Waodani Tribe was known in the surrounding areas. They had a reputation for being extremely violent and treating all those outside their tribe with hatred on sight.Despite this reputation, five American missionaries feel called to share the Gospel with them. Lead by Jim Elliot (Sean McGowan) and pilot Nate Saint (Chad Allen), they begin to make plans to win the tribe over as friends. Nate and Jim spend weeks flying overhead and lowering things down in a bucket. Once they feel they have won them over, the five plan to land on a nearby sandbar and try to make contact face to face. But can these natives be trusted?This movie is based on a true story made famous in Christian circles by Elisabeth Elliot in her book Through Gates of Splendor. In recent years, Christian recording artist Steven Curtis Chapman has written a song inspired by the story and Nate's son Steve has been touring the country with one of the men from the tribe. So those within the Christian community are quite familiar with the story.I went into the movie with high hopes, but left feeling unsatisfied. This is not the fault of the actors. I had never heard of any of them before, but they all do an excellent job bringing the story to life. The movie was shot in South America, and the scenery is beautiful.The problem comes with the story. While I haven't read the book, I have heard the story multiple times. I knew what was coming and dreaded it the entire time. At the same time, the story felt slow. It spends equal time with the tribe and with the missionaries. Ironically, I felt we got to know the tribe better and understood them more then the Americans. Too many of the actors, both the natives and the Americans, looked alike, so it was hard to tell them apart. In fact, I would have had a very hard time following the story if I had not known it before hand. This made it hard to get emotionally involved in the story.Then comes the final act. In real life, this is a powerful story of God's love and forgiveness shining through some very tough circumstances. However, that ending is watered down in an attempt to not offend non-Christians. The entire reason for making this movie is negated by the decision to sell out the ending.Ultimately, this movie fails on every level. It doesn't truly show the difference God can make in a life, so it won't appeal to Christians. At the same time, the subject matter will turn off non-Christians.

980036,A207IYGZTAF0DS,B000EXDS4I,NoWireHangers,"[4, 8]","""End of the Spear"", based on true events, tells the story of a group of missionaries who get killed by a savage native tribe in South America. It's an independent film with pretty good production values and is for the most part well made, and it has a strong performance by Louie Leonardo. But it suffers from some very big flaws: The missionaries, who seem to be meant as heroes of the film (and remember, this film was made and financed by Christians), are portrayed as anything but heroic: They come off as reckless, ignorant and stupid (and I'm not saying the real-life missionaries this film is based on were, but they are in this film). They want to ""make contact"" with the natives. Their motivation is never made clear; it seems they want to impress the natives with their airplane. They fly over their village and shout and throw things down from their plane. Even though they behave like ignorant bullies toward the natives, the film wants us to sympathise with the missionaries. Later, they land and meet with the natives, but they haven't even bothered to learn their language, so I don't know how they planned to do any preaching or other missionary work. The result is a big misunderstanding where the natives - understandably - feel threatened, killing the missionaries. The film (i.e. the filmmakers) seems completely unaware that the natives may have killed the missionaries because they were scared; instead it is implied they did it because they were culturally and morally inferior to our good, Christian, American heroes. Their widows then go off into the jungle to live with the natives to help them change their ways. It's strange to imagine how nobody involved in the making of ""End of the Spear"" realized how ethnocentric and culturally imperialistic the film really is. Another problem is the narrative. The plotting is weak and the pace slow, especially in the last half of the film. And the climax of the film goes so over the top it almost becomes a parody of itself.Despite a potentially fascinating story and competent (up to a point) filmmaking, its huge flaws make ""End of the Spear"" difficult to enjoy and appreciate. It's a disappointment; I'm sure this story could have been made into a much better, less one-sided, film. Weak 2 star rating. For a better version of the story, see the documentaryBeyond the Gates of Splendor, which lets the real people tell the story, and shed some light on the motivations instead of portraying them as cartoon characters.",2,Wasted potential.,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,2492,"['End', 'Spear', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'story', 'group', 'missionaries', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'savage', 'native', 'tribe', 'South', 'America', 'independent', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'made', 'strong', 'performance', 'Louie', 'Leonardo', 'very', 'big', 'flaws', 'missionaries', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'meant', 'heroes', 'film', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'financed', 'Christians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'anything', 'heroic', 'come', 'off', 'reckless', 'ignorant', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'real-life', 'missionaries', 'film', 'based', 'were', 'are', 'film', 'want', 'make', 'contact', 'natives', 'motivation', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'want', 'impress', 'natives', 'airplane', 'fly', 'village', 'shout', 'throw', 'things', 'down', 'plane', 'Even', 'behave', 'ignorant', 'bullies', 'natives', 'film', 'sympathise', 'missionaries', 'Later', 'land', 'meet', 'natives', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'bothered', 'learn', 'language', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'planned', 'do', 'preaching', 'other', 'missionary', 'work', 'result', 'big', 'misunderstanding', 'where', 'natives', 'understandably', 'feel', 'threatened', 'killing', 'missionaries', 'film', 'i.e', 'filmmakers', 'completely', 'unaware', 'natives', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'missionaries', 'were', 'scared', 'instead', 'implied', 'did', 'were', 'culturally', 'morally', 'inferior', 'good', 'Christian', 'American', 'heroes', 'widows', 'then', 'go', 'off', 'jungle', 'live', 'natives', 'help', 'change', 'ways', 'strange', 'imagine', 'how', 'nobody', 'involved', 'making', 'End', 'Spear', 'realized', 'how', 'ethnocentric', 'culturally', 'imperialistic', 'film', 'really', 'problem', 'narrative', 'plotting', 'weak', 'pace', 'slow', 'especially', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'climax', 'film', 'so', 'top', 'almost', 'parody', 'itself.Despite', 'potentially', 'fascinating', 'story', 'competent', 'point', 'filmmaking', 'huge', 'flaws', 'make', 'End', 'Spear', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'sure', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'less', 'one-sided', 'film', 'Weak', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'better', 'version', 'story', 'see', 'documentaryBeyond', 'Gates', 'Splendor', 'real', 'people', 'tell', 'story', 'shed', 'light', 'motivations', 'instead', 'portraying', 'cartoon', 'characters']",End Of The Spear
980037,ABC8FXLD7W528,B000EXDS4I,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[0, 1]","Before I launch into my review of this wonderful movie, please be aware that this movie is not for children. Rather, this movie is for teenagers and older due to violence and some frightening themes.That said, ""End of the Spear"" is, in my opinion, one of the best movies. A group of missionaries embark on a missions trip to a remote part of Ecuador to teach the Waodini tribe that there is more to life than the constant killing amongst tribes, which has taken place for generations. Their tribe is nearly becoming extinct and they think nothing of brutally killing each other.The missionaries risk their lives to share the profound truth of the sacrifice one Father made so all of His children could have eternal life. Among the missionary group are members Nate Saint and Jim Elliot.One of the most touching lines in the movie is when Steve Saint, the son of one of the missionaries, Nate Saint, asks his dad if they will use their guns if the Waodani attack them. Nate gently tells his son that they won't be using their guns because the Waodani aren't ready for heaven yet.Nate Saint and the rest of the group were brutally killed by the Waodani tribe. Later, Steve, his mother, and several other missionaries live with the Waodani and it is then that God begins to soften the hearts of those in the tribe, one person at a time. Later, we see the Gospel written in the Waodani language.As I watched this movie, I was reminded of all of our missionaries all over the world who risk their lives to share the Gospel. Theirs is a sacrifice that we oftentimes forget, but must make an effort to remember. Through their sacrifice, they teach others of the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for us.Breathtaking scenery, vivid Gospel parallels, and a strong theme of forgiveness make ""End of the Spear"" a movie I won't soon forget.  Highly recommended for those ages 13 and older.

But instead of being about doctrinal discussions, it a true story about the unseen power that would drive people back, in a loving way, to the those who killed their spouses; it is belief acted out.The movie did not take the easy way out on difficult circumstances, but looked reality right in the eye. The lush soundtrack served to underscore and connect the dangerous jungle environment with its violent, primitive tribes, together with the hope that is the Gospel.

980039,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B000EXDS4I,Robert Blake,"[20, 28]","""End Of The Spear"" is based on one of the most famous stories within Christian missionary circles, the story of a group of missionary families who ventured into the most remote areas of Ecuador's jungles in the 1950s to Christianize local indigenous tribes, tragically five men were killed when they attempted to make contact. This makes for interesting material, unfortunately, director Jim Hanon reduces his story to a muddled series of segments, an unclear narrative and a ""Christian film"" that never gets any sort of clear philosophy or message across.The film kicks off with some gorgeous cinematography, fully capturing the beauty of South American landscapes, we also meet some fascinating Indian characters and the members of their tribes and families. All this feels very authentic and well-researched. The movie immediately goes downhill however, when the whole missionary storyline comes into play. The screenplay by Bart Gavigan, Jim Hanon and Bill Ewing introduces us to the missionaries, their wives and one son, and they comes across as nice, pleasant folks, but we never learn exactly what it is they are here for. They have set up a very Americanized camp where they live suburban 1950s American lifestyles in the middle of the jungle, but the film never explains what their specific ideas, plans or goals are as missionaries. They could be United Fruit workers for all we know. We hear a lot about ""making contact,"" but what for? Is it to convert the natives to Jesus? Why do these people feel compelled to convert the Indians? This is never explored or ever explained. In a film about religious personalities, it is interesting and disappointing to see how the film simply ignores or evades the details of the spiritual drive behind these characters. Maybe Hanson believed this would make the film more commercially attractive. Consider that the term ""Bible"" or the name ""Jesus"" are never once uttered in a film which is about people supposedly destined to introduce these elements to the Indians, and you'll only know that if you research the story after watching the movie.After the tragic, main event of the film takes place, the dead missionaries' widows go live among the Indians. This could have turned into a fascinating story of cultures meeting or a serious look at one foreign group trying to introduce an indigenous culture to their religion, like Salvador Carrasco's much deeper, realistic ""The Other Conquest,"" serious philosophical, spiritual topics would have made for a riveting story. Instead the missionary widows become invisible, almost background characters while Hanson throws a bunch of ""action scenes"" at us including a river battle with an anaconda. There is quite a lot of carnage in ""End Of The Spear,"" including battles with jaguars, women being hauled away to cook for conquerors and people being impaled, but it has no payoff. The ending gives the assumption that ""forgiveness"" is the main theme of the movie, but again, it is never explored with the kind of depth and attention it demands.Christian films have lately become a hot commodity, especially in the Bush era, post-""Passion Of The Christ"" America, but even the worst of the lot (""One Night With The King,"" ""Left Behind"") have clear, understandable messages. You don't have to agree with them, but you understand the theology or philosophy behind the story. ""End Of The Spear"" only offers bloody battles, even a surge of polio in the jungle, but we never get why characters are where they are, why they do what they do, or what they even think or feel inside. Indian characters change their views, one even converts to whatever the missionary women are offering, but we never learn why or how. There is never a single shot of a Bible being handed out or any of the missionary women actually teaching or saying anything to the Indians that would make them convert. ""End Of The Spear"" is a stale film with no story. It is a film that feels as if it knows what it's about, but never lets us in on the secret.",1,"A Muddled, Stale Movie.",1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,4013,"['End', 'Spear', 'based', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'stories', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'circles', 'story', 'group', 'missionary', 'families', 'who', 'ventured', 'most', 'remote', 'areas', 'Ecuador', 'jungles', '1950s', 'Christianize', 'local', 'indigenous', 'tribes', 'tragically', 'five', 'men', 'were', 'killed', 'when', 'attempted', 'make', 'contact', 'interesting', 'material', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'Jim', 'Hanon', 'story', 'muddled', 'series', 'segments', 'unclear', 'narrative', 'Christian', 'film', 'never', 'sort', 'clear', 'philosophy', 'message', 'across.The', 'film', 'kicks', 'off', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'fully', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'South', 'American', 'landscapes', 'also', 'meet', 'fascinating', 'Indian', 'characters', 'members', 'tribes', 'families', 'feels', 'very', 'authentic', 'well-researched', 'movie', 'immediately', 'downhill', 'however', 'when', 'whole', 'missionary', 'storyline', 'play', 'screenplay', 'Bart', 'Gavigan', 'Jim', 'Hanon', 'Bill', 'Ewing', 'missionaries', 'wives', 'one', 'son', 'nice', 'pleasant', 'folks', 'never', 'learn', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'here', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'Americanized', 'camp', 'where', 'live', 'suburban', '1950s', 'American', 'lifestyles', 'middle', 'jungle', 'film', 'never', 'what', 'specific', 'ideas', 'goals', 'are', 'missionaries', 'could', 'be', 'United', 'Fruit', 'workers', 'know', 'hear', 'lot', 'making', 'contact', 'what', 'convert', 'natives', 'Jesus', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'feel', 'compelled', 'convert', 'Indians', 'never', 'explored', 'ever', 'explained', 'film', 'religious', 'personalities', 'interesting', 'disappointing', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'simply', 'details', 'spiritual', 'drive', 'characters', 'Maybe', 'Hanson', 'believed', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'commercially', 'attractive', 'Consider', 'term', 'Bible', 'name', 'Jesus', 'are', 'never', 'once', 'uttered', 'film', 'people', 'supposedly', 'destined', 'introduce', 'elements', 'Indians', ""'ll"", 'only', 'know', 'research', 'story', 'watching', 'movie.After', 'tragic', 'main', 'event', 'film', 'place', 'dead', 'missionaries', 'widows', 'go', 'live', 'Indians', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'fascinating', 'story', 'cultures', 'meeting', 'serious', 'look', 'one', 'foreign', 'group', 'trying', 'introduce', 'indigenous', 'culture', 'religion', 'Salvador', 'Carrasco', 'much', 'deeper', 'realistic', 'Other', 'Conquest', 'serious', 'philosophical', 'spiritual', 'topics', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'riveting', 'story', 'Instead', 'missionary', 'become', 'invisible', 'almost', 'characters', 'Hanson', 'bunch', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'river', 'battle', 'anaconda', 'quite', 'lot', 'carnage', 'End', 'Spear', 'including', 'battles', 'jaguars', 'women', 'being', 'hauled', 'away', 'cook', 'conquerors', 'people', 'being', 'impaled', 'payoff', 'ending', 'assumption', 'forgiveness', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'again', 'never', 'explored', 'kind', 'depth', 'attention', 'demands.Christian', 'films', 'have', 'lately', 'become', 'hot', 'commodity', 'especially', 'Bush', 'era', 'post-', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'America', 'even', 'worst', 'lot', 'One', 'Night', 'King', 'Left', 'Behind', 'have', 'clear', 'understandable', 'messages', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'agree', 'understand', 'theology', 'philosophy', 'story', 'End', 'Spear', 'only', 'bloody', 'battles', 'even', 'surge', 'polio', 'jungle', 'never', 'get', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'why', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'even', 'think', 'feel', 'inside', 'Indian', 'characters', 'change', 'views', 'one', 'even', 'whatever', 'missionary', 'women', 'are', 'offering', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'how', 'never', 'single', 'shot', 'Bible', 'being', 'handed', 'out', 'missionary', 'women', 'actually', 'teaching', 'saying', 'anything', 'Indians', 'would', 'make', 'convert', 'End', 'Spear', 'stale', 'film', 'story', 'film', 'what', 'never', 'secret']",End Of The Spear

However, these movies rarely illustrate any positive consequences that result after the murders, let alone any spiritual sentiments or moral understanding that occur within the murders themselves.  END OF THE SPEAR is a film that not only does both these things, but also tells how the deaths of those killed helped bring about the salvation of an entire race of people from the verge of a self-inflected extinction.END OF THE SPEAR is largely a movie about the Waodani people.  The Waodani are a people that live in the jungles of Ecuador.  Despite the pressures of the outside world that continued to squeeze the environment and resources of the Waodani, they continued to live a self-sufficient and self-contained life in the jungle.  That is, except for one crucial element:  the Waodani were killing themselves to death.  For whatever reasons, the Waodani had split into different tribes.  The lack of resources and women caused the tribes to perform raids upon each other.  If a child lived after one of these raids, he would grow up to seek revenge upon those who had killed his family.  Thus, back and forth the violence continued for several generations until only a handful of Waodani were left and they were on the verge of a self-inflicted genocide.They were saved by a group of missionaries.  Five young men slowly made contact with the tribe.  Eventually, they attempted to have a face-to-face interaction with members from the tribe.  The attempt ended in the murder of the five men (Jim Elliot and Nate Saint included).  Undeterred the wives and families of the murdered men contacted the tribe and came to live with them.  This act of compassion, grace, and mercy proved to save the Waodani from both disease and themselves.In Christian circles, the lives of Nate Saint and Jim Elliot have taken on almost mythic proportions.  Inspiring as their lives were, the movie END OF THE SPEAR helps to ground the story in truth and reality by telling the story from the perspective of Mincayani, a Waodani leader and the man who killed Nathan Saint.END OF THE SPEAR was made on a shoestring budget with limited promotion.  Yet, except for the sometimes cheesy voice-overs, the picture appears to have the budget of a normal motion picture.  The cinematography is vivid, the acting is good, and the editing concise.  There is a spiritual slant to the movie, but unlike many Christian films the Gospel message and story of conversion isn't contrived.  Instead, it occurs naturally and fits with the pace and story of the rest of the film.Granted, END OF THE SPEAR isn't for everyone.  It begins rather slowly and there are a few awkward moments.  Nevertheless, the filmmaking in END OF THE SPEAR is on par with the average Hollywood flick and its storytelling is on a level above much of the garbage that Tinsletown vomits out every year.  The movie is not only based upon a true story, but stays true that story and has a great message about compassion, grace, and reconciliation.  Hollywood could learn a thing or two from a film like this.",3,Effective.,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,3127,"['Hollywood', 'movies', 'time', 'involve', 'murdering', 'innocents', 'However', 'movies', 'rarely', 'illustrate', 'positive', 'consequences', 'result', 'murders', 'let', 'alone', 'spiritual', 'sentiments', 'moral', 'understanding', 'occur', 'murders', 'END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'also', 'how', 'deaths', 'killed', 'helped', 'bring', 'salvation', 'entire', 'race', 'people', 'verge', 'self-inflected', 'extinction.END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', 'largely', 'movie', 'Waodani', 'people', 'Waodani', 'are', 'people', 'live', 'jungles', 'Ecuador', 'pressures', 'outside', 'world', 'continued', 'squeeze', 'environment', 'resources', 'Waodani', 'continued', 'live', 'self-sufficient', 'self-contained', 'life', 'jungle', 'one', 'crucial', 'element', 'Waodani', 'were', 'killing', 'death', 'reasons', 'Waodani', 'had', 'split', 'different', 'tribes', 'lack', 'resources', 'women', 'caused', 'tribes', 'perform', 'raids', 'other', 'child', 'lived', 'one', 'raids', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'seek', 'revenge', 'who', 'had', 'killed', 'family', 'Thus', 'back', 'violence', 'continued', 'several', 'generations', 'only', 'handful', 'Waodani', 'were', 'left', 'were', 'verge', 'self-inflicted', 'genocide.They', 'were', 'saved', 'group', 'missionaries', 'Five', 'young', 'men', 'slowly', 'made', 'contact', 'tribe', 'Eventually', 'attempted', 'have', 'face-to-face', 'interaction', 'members', 'tribe', 'attempt', 'ended', 'murder', 'five', 'men', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'included', 'Undeterred', 'wives', 'families', 'murdered', 'men', 'contacted', 'tribe', 'came', 'live', 'act', 'compassion', 'grace', 'mercy', 'proved', 'save', 'Waodani', 'disease', 'themselves.In', 'Christian', 'circles', 'lives', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'have', 'taken', 'almost', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'Inspiring', 'lives', 'were', 'movie', 'END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', 'ground', 'story', 'truth', 'reality', 'telling', 'story', 'perspective', 'Mincayani', 'Waodani', 'leader', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Nathan', 'Saint.END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'limited', 'promotion', 'sometimes', 'cheesy', 'voice-overs', 'picture', 'have', 'budget', 'normal', 'motion', 'picture', 'cinematography', 'vivid', 'acting', 'good', 'editing', 'concise', 'spiritual', 'slant', 'movie', 'many', 'Christian', 'films', 'Gospel', 'message', 'story', 'conversion', ""n't"", 'contrived', 'Instead', 'naturally', 'pace', 'story', 'rest', 'film.Granted', 'END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'rather', 'slowly', 'are', 'few', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Nevertheless', 'filmmaking', 'END', 'THE', 'SPEAR', 'par', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'storytelling', 'level', 'much', 'garbage', 'Tinsletown', 'out', 'year', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'great', 'message', 'compassion', 'grace', 'reconciliation', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'film']",End Of The Spear
