Lawson ""A Legend in his own mind""","[2, 14]",In the United States there is not much information for the general public about the History of the Orthodox Church. I was hoping for something on the mode of of say John Romers Byzantium. But I was diasappointed by this DVD. Now I am sure that the folks who put forth this effort tried to do their best. But I just hope that some one else comes forth and does a better job.

995918,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000FTJ5SO,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[28, 30]","_The History of Orthodox Christianity_ (2006) is a fascinating documentary that reveals the history of the Orthodox Church from the time of Christ to the modern day.  As a Roman Catholic, I can truthfully say that this documentary helped me immensely to understand and appreciate the traditions of my Orthodox brothers and sisters.  The documentary includes many beautiful images of the church in its development throughout the ages.  Further, the documentary features commentary from learned scholars, patriarchs, and priests demonstrating their knowledge of the traditions of Christian Orthodoxy.  Much of this material will certainly aid one's historical understanding to put the church into its proper historical context.  The documentary makes a strong case for Christian Orthodoxy (and Christianity in general) showing the rise and development of the Orthodox churches.  Further, the documentary discusses issues in more recent times, including the ecumenical movement among certain of the Orthodox and some of the difficulties it has encountered.  I believe this movement offers great hope for Christianity in general.The film includes the following three parts:Part 1:  The Beginnings  -  including discussion of Church and State, the Ecumenical Councils, the Nicene Creed, Icons and Iconoclasm, the Fathers of the Church, Monasticism (seen as an alternative to martyrdom in an era with less persecution), the splendor of Hagia Sophia, the mission to the Slavs, the Great Schism, the Crusades, and the Fall of Byzantium.  This first part makes a good case for Orthodoxy as an unbroken tradition dating back to the time of Christ and St. Paul.  It also shows the political development of the church as it became a potent force in the Roman empire at the time of Constantine the Great (regarded as a saint in the Orthodox churches) who after encountering a sign in the sky became a convert to Christ.Part 2:  Byzantium  - including discussion of the Early Church, from Jerusalem to the Nations, Christianity and Hellenism (mentioning the vast resources of the ancient Greek culture and their contributions to the rise and development of Christianity), the Catacombs and the persecution, the early martyrs, the administrative structure of the church, and the birth of Byzantium and the legalization of the church.  This part of the film makes a profound case for Constantine the Great who moved the capital of his empire to Byzantium where he resided in Constantinople (which is often referred to as ""The Second Rome"").Part 3:  Hidden Treasure  -  including discussion of the Church in Captivity, Moscow as the ""Third Rome"", the Greek revolution, the ancient Patriarchates today, the New World, Russia after Communism (and the damage done by Communism including persecution of the churches), challenges for the future (noting the ecumenical movement, the conflicts with Roman Catholicism, and the Uniate churches), and the essence of the Church (explaining how the church has developed following the Industrial Revolution and remains a ""hidden treasure"").  This part makes a profound case for the Orthodox Church as a hidden treasure and for each human being as made in the divine image and thus a treasure unto themselves.  Further, this part discusses some of the ecumenical movements which offer much hope for the future, including relations between the various churches and with Roman Catholicism as well as with the Islamic world.This film offers an excellent introduction and history of Orthodox Christianity.  It is certain to be appreciated by those who admire the Orthodox churches and their great and noble traditions and contributions.  Further, it makes a profound case for Orthodoxy and offers hope for the future for all mankind.

995921,A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,B000FTJ5SO,S. Smith-Peter,"[1, 1]","This historical documentary has two main points: that Orthodoxy is the true successor of the apostolic church and that the Greeks are the most important group within the Orthodox world.  These points are not pursued to the exclusion of all others, and the documentary is an interesting and useful one, but I felt I should point this out.  The Russian Orthodox Church is mentioned, although it is not the focus.  The first episode, on the origins of the church, includes a lot of great visuals of Orthodox shines and holy sites in the Holy Land, while the second episode focuses on Byzantium.  The third, A Hidden Treasure, deals with Orthodoxy since the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  I found the interviews with various bishops to be the most interesting part of this section, and what they said about coexistence with Islam was more flexible than how the narrative presents the history of the church.I'm not sure I would want to show this in a class, but it is a useful introduction to the history of the Orthodox Church and the issues surrounding it today.",4,Somewhat biased but still useful overview of Orthodox Christianity,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,1061,"['historical', 'documentary', 'two', 'main', 'points', 'Orthodoxy', 'true', 'successor', 'apostolic', 'church', 'Greeks', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'group', 'Orthodox', 'world', 'points', 'are', 'not', 'pursued', 'exclusion', 'others', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'useful', 'one', 'felt', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'mentioned', 'not', 'focus', 'first', 'episode', 'origins', 'church', 'lot', 'great', 'visuals', 'Orthodox', 'shines', 'holy', 'sites', 'Holy', 'Land', 'second', 'episode', 'Byzantium', 'third', 'A', 'Hidden', 'Treasure', 'deals', 'Orthodoxy', 'fall', 'Constantinople', '1453', 'found', 'interviews', 'various', 'bishops', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'section', 'what', 'said', 'coexistence', 'Islam', 'was', 'more', 'flexible', 'how', 'narrative', 'presents', 'history', 'church.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'want', 'show', 'class', 'useful', 'introduction', 'history', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'today']",N/A
