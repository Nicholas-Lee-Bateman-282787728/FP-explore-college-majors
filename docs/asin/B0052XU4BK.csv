Billy Drago is creepy enough in his own right as Preacher, but he can never take the place of the murderous Gatlin children that are only alluded to in the plot.

It doesn't have never ending fields of corn, it doesn't have hordes of pagan cult children that yield arsenals of sharp farming tools stained with blood, it doesn't have death after death that splatters blood on the camera. What it does have is a very refreshing, well made, unique entry into the children of the corn series.First off you have your typical traveling couple that thinks they know everything stranded somewhere in California and the closest house is the home of &#34;Preacher&#34; (manson probably took some pointers from this guy.) He is reluctant to help them until he learns the girl is pregnant, guess what hes interested in.Second off, with the exception of the prequel scene in the beginning, there are no children throughout the majority of the movie save the chosen one who leaves bloody footprints and handprints wherever he goes and is locked up in the shed outback. Its a creepy scene and the kid who played the chosen one never spoke but could send shivers down anyone's spine. You don't even get a good look at his face until the last scene, which is also the only time any other children show up. (and the most disappointing part of the whole movie.)It doesn't delivers scares and a gore as much as it delivers creepy atmosphere and a whats going to happen next feeling.

Here's the ninth(if you count the remake of the first film) installment of a film series none of us wanted or asked for-The Children of the Corn series!!But don't get me wrong, I love the first movie, though it's never been looked upon as being a great horror film.  The first film really expanded upon a very short story by Stephen King(who never considered it one of his better stories anyway), and the sequels still milk that whole ""Based on a story by Stephen King"" thing even though there is doodleysquat left of King's idea.Genesis separates itself even further from pack, angering fans of the series, some of which dub the movie the ""Halloween 3"" of the series.  Well, I happen to like Halloween 3, even more so that any Halloween sequel after it, so I figured I'd give this a fair shake.  Plus, Billy Drago stars in this film, and I love the guy.  I was lucky enough to spend some time and smoke a few cigs with Drago, and found him to be extremely friendly.  So I guess I felt a bit honor bound as well.Genesis follows Tim and Allie, a married(and pregnant) couple stranded in the California desert.  They seek refuge at a small farm with a preacher(Drago) and his wife.  Tim and Allie find they are an odd couple, with Drago being his creepy self, and his wife pulling a Sharon Stone spread for Tim on the kitchen table.  Still, Tim and Allie must stay the night, and get a ride into town in the morning.  Soon they find out that the odd couple are keeping an evil, telekinetic boy out in a shack.  The boy doesn't want the new guests to leave and terrorizes everybody Poltergeist-style.Good God, will anyone survive this night of terror???I agree, this film didn't need to be a Children of the Corn sequel necessarily.  Take away the prologue and a few references, it could have been it's own thing.  Now, on it's own I think it wasn't all that bad.  A bit cliched perhaps, but it was a nice slow burn of a suspense story, and was a helluva lot better than the pitiful last couple of sequels.  Plus, it's probably the most atmospheric of all the films, minus the first one of course.  The movie more than likely angered people because it didn't follow the structure of the previous films which consisted of strangers trotting into Gatlin, Nebraska and having to deal with a murderous child cult that worships ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"".No, this film doesn't take place in the cornfields of Nebraska, but in the cornfieldless deserts of California.  ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" is referred to, but absent from all the action-probably because there are no rows to walk behind.  No child cult either, just the creepy, evil child in the shack.So, how does it tie in?Well, Drago came back from Vietnam either hours or days after the initial Gatlin massacre(in this movie that's 1973, but in the first film that was 1980 or 81.  Oh, well!), and barely escapes with his life.  That's probably the biggest relationship to the series right there.  Why his wife's child is evil and supernatural is either a bad coincidence or the evil of Gatlin kinda followed him to California.  Plus, Drago seems to be trying to start a whole new Children of the Corn cult in the desert.  Hence the title ""Genesis"" perhaps?I do like that this film was kinda vague, and didn't explain too much.  People might think this makes the movie confusing or seem sloppy, but to me it makes it a bit more mysterious and even creepy at times.  The previous sequels suffered from explaining too much and adding too many ridiculous plot points.  Examples?  Sure!  How about the stunt of bringing back a much older Issac to lead the children in Part 6?  Or blaming rotten corn to explain the murderous behavior of the children in Part 2?  And who can forget the bad decision of actually showing ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" as a silly looking, cartoonish monster in Part 3?  Or just trying to rewrite history in Part 4(it was a remake more or less I guess)?What I'm trying to say is that regardless of what some reviewers complain about, this series has definitely been sillier and more uninspired at times.So, while Genesis doesn't have all the hallmarks of the previous films, and may not be terribly original on it's own, I do like the effort.......and it wasn't really all that bad.",3,"Less ""Corny"" Than Previous Sequels!",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,4294,"['Oh', 'Lord', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'Here', 'ninth', 'count', 'remake', 'first', 'film', 'installment', 'film', 'series', 'none', 'wanted', 'asked', 'for-The', 'Children', 'Corn', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'first', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'looked', 'being', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'expanded', 'very', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'who', 'never', 'considered', 'one', 'better', 'stories', 'anyway', 'sequels', 'still', 'milk', 'whole', 'Based', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'thing', 'even', 'doodleysquat', 'left', 'King', 'idea.Genesis', 'even', 'further', 'pack', 'angering', 'fans', 'series', 'dub', 'movie', 'Halloween', '3', 'series', 'Well', 'happen', 'like', 'Halloween', '3', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Halloween', 'sequel', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'fair', 'shake', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'film', 'love', 'guy', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'spend', 'time', 'smoke', 'few', 'cigs', 'Drago', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'So', 'guess', 'felt', 'bit', 'honor', 'bound', 'well.Genesis', 'Tim', 'Allie', 'married', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'stranded', 'California', 'desert', 'seek', 'refuge', 'small', 'farm', 'preacher', 'Drago', 'wife', 'Tim', 'Allie', 'find', 'are', 'odd', 'couple', 'Drago', 'being', 'creepy', 'self', 'wife', 'pulling', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'spread', 'Tim', 'kitchen', 'table', 'Still', 'Tim', 'Allie', 'must', 'stay', 'night', 'get', 'ride', 'town', 'morning', 'Soon', 'find', 'out', 'odd', 'couple', 'are', 'keeping', 'evil', 'telekinetic', 'boy', 'out', 'shack', 'boy', ""n't"", 'want', 'new', 'guests', 'leave', 'terrorizes', 'everybody', 'Poltergeist-style.Good', 'God', 'will', 'anyone', 'survive', 'night', 'terror', 'agree', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Children', 'Corn', 'sequel', 'necessarily', 'Take', 'away', 'prologue', 'few', 'references', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'thing', 'Now', 'own', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'bit', 'cliched', 'perhaps', 'was', 'nice', 'slow', 'burn', 'suspense', 'story', 'was', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'pitiful', 'last', 'couple', 'sequels', 'probably', 'most', 'atmospheric', 'films', 'first', 'one', 'course', 'movie', 'more', 'likely', 'angered', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'structure', 'previous', 'films', 'consisted', 'strangers', 'trotting', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'having', 'deal', 'murderous', 'child', 'cult', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', '.No', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'cornfields', 'Nebraska', 'cornfieldless', 'deserts', 'California', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'referred', 'absent', 'action-probably', 'are', 'rows', 'walk', 'child', 'cult', 'just', 'creepy', 'evil', 'child', 'shack.So', 'how', 'tie', 'Well', 'Drago', 'came', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'hours', 'days', 'initial', 'Gatlin', 'massacre', 'movie', '1973', 'first', 'film', 'was', '1980', '81', 'Oh', 'well', 'barely', 'escapes', 'life', 'probably', 'biggest', 'relationship', 'series', 'right', 'there', 'Why', 'wife', 'child', 'evil', 'supernatural', 'bad', 'coincidence', 'evil', 'Gatlin', 'kinda', 'followed', 'California', 'Drago', 'be', 'trying', 'start', 'whole', 'new', 'Children', 'Corn', 'cult', 'desert', 'Hence', 'title', 'Genesis', 'perhaps', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'kinda', 'vague', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'too', 'much', 'People', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'confusing', 'seem', 'sloppy', 'bit', 'more', 'mysterious', 'even', 'creepy', 'times', 'previous', 'sequels', 'suffered', 'explaining', 'too', 'much', 'adding', 'too', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'points', 'Examples', 'Sure', 'How', 'stunt', 'bringing', 'back', 'much', 'older', 'Issac', 'lead', 'children', 'Part', '6', 'blaming', 'rotten', 'corn', 'explain', 'murderous', 'behavior', 'children', 'Part', '2', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'bad', 'decision', 'actually', 'showing', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'silly', 'looking', 'cartoonish', 'monster', 'Part', '3', 'just', 'trying', 'rewrite', 'history', 'Part', '4', 'was', 'remake', 'more', 'less', 'guess', 'What', ""'m"", 'trying', 'say', 'regardless', 'what', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'series', 'definitely', 'been', 'sillier', 'more', 'uninspired', 'times.So', 'Genesis', ""n't"", 'have', 'hallmarks', 'previous', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'terribly', 'original', 'own', 'do', 'effort', '.and', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'bad']",Children Of The Corn: Genesis

The movie opens in 1973 with a returning soldier from Vietnam. He comes home to an eerie setting, one we would expect from the series.The movie then jumps to present day as a couple (she is pregnant) are stranded in the desert far from civilization. They seek shelter at a farm run by a strange overly religious man (Billy Drago) and his mail order bride (Barbara Nedeljakova) who seems to want out. They spend the night with it being Sunday and options are few. They are warned NOT to go snooping around. Soon aforesaid pregnant wife (Kelen Coleman) is out at night looking around in the barn which looks like a ""Children of the Corn"" barn. She also discovers a child whimpering behind a locked door...hubby (Tim Rock) must do something, but the corn has other ideas.I didn't think the ending was as good as the rest of the film. The movie doesn't have a whole bunch of kids running a community and killing adults as we have become used to.

The eighth film, like several of the other sequels, doesn't take place in Gatlin, and is very loosely tied to the original story. I give this movie credit for possibly being the creepiest children of the corn, and for doing it without much of the gore the other films featured. A lot of the credit goes to veteran movie actor, Billy Drago, who is just creepy by nature. There is no denying the film is creepy, but is it good? No, not really! The story is very slow at times, inconsistent, and some what predictable. Genesis had a bit more potential than some of its predecessors, but in the end, despite the creepy vibe it gives off, it's just another really bad sequel that we didn't need.",1,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,818,"['How', 'short', 'story', 'spawn', 'eight', 'feature', 'films', 'simple', 'nothing', 'scarier', 'more', 'creepy', 'children', 'who', 'kill', 'people', 'eighth', 'film', 'several', 'other', 'sequels', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'Gatlin', 'very', 'loosely', 'tied', 'original', 'story', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'possibly', 'being', 'creepiest', 'children', 'corn', 'doing', 'much', 'gore', 'other', 'films', 'featured', 'lot', 'credit', 'veteran', 'movie', 'actor', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'who', 'just', 'creepy', 'nature', 'denying', 'film', 'creepy', 'good', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'story', 'very', 'slow', 'times', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'predictable', 'Genesis', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'potential', 'predecessors', 'end', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'sequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'need']",Children Of The Corn: Genesis

It is, in short, that no one who is involved in making the film seems to really care.Except the brief opening chapter, in which Billy Drago's character, a young solider returning from Vietnam, witnesses something horrible, the film's disjointed story has little to no relation to what happened in Gatlin, Nebraska.
