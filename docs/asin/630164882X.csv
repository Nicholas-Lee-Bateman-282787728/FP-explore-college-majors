I bought this because I wanted to see if it held up and it is out of print on VHS and never released on DVD, so renting was out of the question.  It does NOT hold up.

I don't do magic or attract an audience or fans like Penn and Teller. I'm glad this is on DVD, but I have not decided to buy it yet. I don't even have a camcorder to make my own movie yet. Going about things step by step is a far out trip if this is the best model I can come up with. I'm sure I saw this movie. Life has been downhill since then. I want to go back. I did a few crazy things in 1989. This movie was right for me in those times.",4,psychotropic,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,559,"['have', 'been', 'thinking', 'movie', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'something', 'gripping', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'magic', 'attract', 'audience', 'fans', 'Penn', 'Teller', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'decided', 'buy', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'camcorder', 'make', 'own', 'movie', 'yet', 'Going', 'things', 'step', 'step', 'far', 'out', 'trip', 'best', 'model', 'can', 'come', 'up', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saw', 'movie', 'Life', 'been', 'downhill', 'then', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'did', 'few', 'crazy', 'things', '1989', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'times']",N/A
