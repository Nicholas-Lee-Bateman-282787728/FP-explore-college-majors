1099973,A1IK23RDL4DOZS,B000VAHQYC,70's Kid,"[4, 4]","First off, this is a great collection of NFL games from maybe the best team ever. I think only the best Steelers teams of the 1970's could have had a shot against this incredible DEFENSE. I've never seen anything like this team and I never will. I'm 41 and remember this special 85 Bears team well as a teenager. This brings back awesome memories of watching the NFL with my brothers then. And this was a time when you had actual, true men playing football. Not what you have today. A bunch of men-children whos antics make me sick. These guys just played football. Remember those days when guys didn't jump up after being tackled on a first down play to signal his arm forward like a immature jackass? I do!Where's Wilber Running In The Snow To The SuperBowl?? That famous scene at mid-field at the end of the game as the snow is falling putting a final cap on this dominant performance. What you get is some guy holding up a Super Bowl XX pennant who looks like a SNL character during a DA BEARS spoof with the audio of Madden and Summeral. BTW, they had some hysterical comments about the Fridge in this game. Summeral says ""it would taken a stout wind to move the Fridge"". Great stuff. I just wish they would have used NFL FILMS footage at the end or track down some other footage elsewhere good or bad; just to see that great scene of Wilber in the snow on his way to the endzone.A classic set of NFL games for anyone to enjoy. I'm a die-hard Broncos fan and more importantly a die-hard football fan. Get this set if you love football or buy it for someone who does!!",4,Where's Wilber Running In The Snow To The SuperBowl??,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1572,"['First', 'off', 'great', 'collection', 'NFL', 'games', 'maybe', 'best', 'team', 'ever', 'think', 'only', 'best', 'Steelers', 'teams', '1970', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'shot', 'incredible', 'DEFENSE', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'team', 'never', 'will', ""'m"", '41', 'remember', 'special', '85', 'Bears', 'team', 'well', 'teenager', 'back', 'awesome', 'memories', 'watching', 'NFL', 'brothers', 'then', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'actual', 'true', 'men', 'playing', 'football', 'Not', 'what', 'have', 'today', 'bunch', 'men-children', 'whos', 'antics', 'make', 'sick', 'guys', 'just', 'played', 'football', 'Remember', 'days', 'when', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'up', 'being', 'tackled', 'first', 'down', 'play', 'signal', 'arm', 'forward', 'immature', 'jackass', 'do', 'Where', 'Wilber', 'Running', 'Snow', 'SuperBowl', 'famous', 'scene', 'mid-field', 'end', 'game', 'snow', 'falling', 'putting', 'final', 'cap', 'dominant', 'performance', 'What', 'get', 'guy', 'holding', 'up', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XX', 'pennant', 'who', 'SNL', 'character', 'DA', 'BEARS', 'spoof', 'audio', 'Madden', 'Summeral', 'BTW', 'had', 'hysterical', 'comments', 'Fridge', 'game', 'Summeral', 'would', 'taken', 'stout', 'wind', 'move', 'Fridge', 'Great', 'stuff', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'NFL', 'FILMS', 'footage', 'end', 'track', 'down', 'other', 'footage', 'elsewhere', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'see', 'great', 'scene', 'Wilber', 'snow', 'way', 'endzone.A', 'classic', 'set', 'NFL', 'games', 'anyone', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'die-hard', 'Broncos', 'fan', 'more', 'importantly', 'die-hard', 'football', 'fan', 'Get', 'set', 'love', 'football', 'buy', 'someone', 'who']",N/A

Heck no.I've recorded games since 1985 (my first VCR) in SLP, later in LP speed, and recently remastered them to SP DVD, and this set looks better than what I could get from a VHS tape - but not too much better.They even have a ripple or two here and there on the DVD mastering, but for the true Bears lover (or collector of the Packer/Bear games such as myself), all I can say is 'da Bears' rock (and those memories of the worst Packer Bear game I've ever seen) are re-lived.Yes I'm a cheesehead stuck in Hell...umm, California, hoping to get the H### out of this state and back to where the real happy cows live!  (grin)PS: Don't lose sleep waiting for the other games of the season.Those would be (regional) games and not (network) games, which means the stations of that region would have to sign away their share in the profits of any kind of reissue.Forget it, it's not going to happen.",5,FACTS about this release,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1855,"['recording', 'method', '1985', 'came', '1', 'inch', '3/4', 'inch', 'video', 'tape', 'source', 'truck', 'stadium', 'network', 'mastering', 'usually', 'used', 'highlights', 'sports', 'reports', 'newscasts.This', 'not', 'usual', 'NFL', 'Films', 'camera', 'sidelines', 'recording', 'way', 'game', 'was', 'viewed', 'over-the-air.One', 'game', 'even', 'local', 'station', 'super', 'ID', 'believe', 'West', 'Virginia.In', 'days', 'FOX', 'came', 'along', 'broadcast', 'rights', 'NFC', 'games', 'decent', 'music', 'games', 'were', 'loose', 'meaning', 'took', 'forever', 'audio', 'person', 'add', 'music', 'bumpers', 'commercial', 'breaks.This', 'why', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'majority', 'cues', 'announcers', 'quick', 'fade', 'black', '/', 'fade', 'back', 'picture.Think', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'bought', 'first', '500', 'VCR', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'when', 'breaks', 'came', 'unpaused', 'when', 'breaks', 'what', 'games', 'look', 'most', 'part.Would', 'complain', 'Heck', 'no.I', ""'ve"", 'recorded', 'games', '1985', 'first', 'VCR', 'SLP', 'later', 'LP', 'speed', 'recently', 'remastered', 'SP', 'DVD', 'set', 'better', 'what', 'could', 'get', 'VHS', 'tape', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'better.They', 'even', 'have', 'ripple', 'two', 'here', 'there', 'DVD', 'mastering', 'true', 'Bears', 'lover', 'collector', 'Packer/Bear', 'games', 'such', 'can', 'say', ""'da"", 'Bears', 'rock', 'memories', 'worst', 'Packer', 'Bear', 'game', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 're-lived.Yes', ""'m"", 'cheesehead', 'stuck', 'Hell', 'umm', 'California', 'hoping', 'get', 'H', 'state', 'back', 'where', 'real', 'happy', 'cows', 'live', 'grin', 'PS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'sleep', 'waiting', 'other', 'games', 'season.Those', 'would', 'be', 'regional', 'games', 'not', 'network', 'games', 'stations', 'region', 'would', 'have', 'sign', 'away', 'share', 'profits', 'kind', 'reissue.Forget', 'not', 'going', 'happen']",N/A
1099975,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B000VAHQYC,Ben Masters,"[2, 2]","This is a very good collection of Chicago Bears games from 1985, and I'm glad that the NFL put it out. As for those games where people have complained about poor video quality (the season-ender at Detroit being one of them; another is SBXX, with the postgame interviews), I really don't mind the poor quality, and in fact, I'm giving Warner Bros./NFL Films the benefit of the doubt, as I believe that they did what they could, and I also believe that such poor quality actually adds to the dated look of those games. Another thing: while most of these games are from CBS (with SBXX being from NBC 1/26/86), the game at Miami is not the only ABC game presented here; the second game (at Minnesota) was what was known as a special Thursday night edition of Monday Night Football, and the game vs. Green Bay is another MNF game. The ABC games and the lone NBC game (SBXX) last somewhat longer due to the fact that they were national games, and as such, no other games were being aired at the same time. What would have really added value is if the NFL left the gamebreaks in on the CBS games (""gamebreaks"" meaning those short segments where Brent Musburger highlights other games).

1099978,A29UPQ6DZ4FQJK,B000VAHQYC,Cim,"[1, 1]","Probably the greatest defense to ever play and quite possibly the greatest team ever assembled....the only other team I can think of that can top this are the 70's Steelers with the Steel curtain. On top of that these Bears also had one of the best football players to ever play the game. Walter Payton. Run, pass, catch, block, pass and even kick and play defense. No other player can ever claim such status.The 80's Bears were a dominant bunch starting with a big draft in 83', a superbowl run in 84' and a championship in 85'. The Bears dominated in 86' with a 14-2 record and a better defense statistically...but an injured QB and a rookie Doug Flutie were not enough to help them repeat. Even though the Bears were consistently racking up wins they were always just short in advancing to another superbowl whether it was from losing players and GM's or heads locking and in-fighting between coaches and players.Nonetheless the 85' season is historically captured here.

Their defense was as good a defense as you'll ever see.  They also had a very capable offense, led by the eccentric Jim McMahon.Almost all of these games are excellent quality in both video and audio.  There are some exceptions.  One of them being the Dallas game which appears to have been someone's VHS recording of the game.  It was taken from a feed in Wheeling, WV as the pop-up screen graphic during the game will tell you.  Also, the regular season finale against Detroit starts off with an awful picture, but it does improve from the second quarter on.  Finally, towards the end of the Super Bowl the color gets darker and the post-game interviews are mostly terrible video.Something I noticed watching these games was the amount of late hits, a lot of which weren't called.  That would never happen today.One more unrelated thing, before one of the games which was a Monday Night game Frank Gifford congratulates O.J.
