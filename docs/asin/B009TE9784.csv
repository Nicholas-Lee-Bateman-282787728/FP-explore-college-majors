Anger Management is a lollipop to fans of Men. The problem with Anger Management is Sheen is sorta muted in this new role, I miss good ole Charlie Harper. This character of Charlie Goodson seems dull and boring.As a retired Baseball player turned shrink, Sheen does shine through. The world does revolve around his character. He needs more development to grow in this series. there are times Sheen seems like he is phoning his performance in rather than allowing himself to be a full comedic speed. Charlie does grow on you, I want to see what he will do in season two with the addition of  Martin Sheen playing his dad as a regular.  The elder Sheen is in the highlight of the season this season with then episode ""Charlie's Dad Visits"" (episode nine)The supporting cast is hit and miss performance-wise. Selma Blair as his Girlfriend/his therapist Kate needs to be fleshed out more because she is given almost nothing to do. Charlie's ex wife is played by Shawnee Smith. Her role is  a more fuller and well rounded character, better than she was inBecker: The Second Season. Barry Corbin as Ed steals every scene he is in as one of Charlie's therapy patients. Micheal Boatman, a  leftover from Sheen'sSpin City: The Complete Fifth Seasondays, plays Charlie's best friend is given so little to do that I feel he is wasted in this thrown away role.As dull as the show first season was, it does have a little promise, plus the show has 90 more episodes to go on FX. Lets hope creator  Bruce Helford (who also created shows for Drew Carey and  George Lopez)can breath life into the second season of this series and Charlie gets his comedy mojo backMaybe after they cancel two and a half men this season, actor Jon Cryer can join the cast as Charlie's long lost brother?

1602120,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009TE9784,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Everyone is well aware of the ups and downs of actor Charlie Sheen's life over the past few years. Some love him, some hate him, but for the most part I think the majority of American's have the same opinion about these well publicized turmoil's: who cares?Celebrities seem to garner attention for the worst behavior possible and people these days seem to think that's cool. It doesn't say much for us does it?But Sheen has come back from the wild ways he displayed and attempted to not only create a new series that he can star in but that can poke fun at his past behavior at the same time. ANGER MANAGEMENT stars Sheen as Charlie Goodson, an ex-major league baseball player who in a fit of rage tried to break a bat over his leg...only to injure himself instead and thus ending his career. Seeing the light so to speak he in turn became an anger management therapist with a successful private practice. He still occasionally finds himself on the verge of anger but seems to catch it most times.Charlie's main focus is on a group he offers therapy to in his home. They run the stereotypical range from grumpy old guy to total whack job girlfriend. While some of these characters have moments that might make you laugh on the whole they become more cardboard cutouts than actual people you get to know.Charlie's character has situations he's chosen to be involved in here that become focal points of various episodes. For one he's divorced but still of fairly good grounds with his ex. Well good in the sense of average sit-com good. Shawnee Smith stars in this role and she's had better parts but holds up well here. The two share a daughter in her early teens which makes for some storylines as well. Of course the things Charlie wants for his daughter and how he wants her to behave are far different from the young girls he hits on throughout the series.When he's not attempting to bed a young girl he meets randomly he's involved with another therapist played by Selma Blair. While the two are involved in a friends with benefits relationship they agree that for this to take place they can't become a therapist for each other...which of course Charlie ends up trying to weasel around when he can.The series is a hit and miss mixture of old stories we've seen before with new attempts to push the envelope as far as it can with sexual taboos. Some episodes are actually hilarious while others just sit there. Never having thought TWO AND A HALF MEN was the funniest thing ever made I thought this series was perhaps even a tad below that level of humor. Watching stars on the tail end of their age bracket and careers involved in sex comedy isn't my cup of tea.Actually that part is rather sad when you think about it. Sheen has acting ability as seen in so many projects he's done in the past. When he took on the role in his previous series he became a caricature of the aging lothario whose life was nothing more than a series of women he attempted to or succeeded in bedding each week. Unfortunately his real life began to mimic this character rather than be an escape from it and that began to inflict itself into that show, enough so that he left. In this show he plays almost the same character with minor differences. It would be nice to see Sheen go back to fulfill the potential he displayed in films like PLATOON rather than this sort of knock off series.On its own perhaps this series can be recommended for a few episodes and some of the jokes can be funny. The problem is you have to sit through the rest of it to get to these gems which are few and far between. Sheen fans who love his off screen antics will fall in love with this character. Those wanting to see a more mature actor will have to wait.",2,WINNING...SORT OF,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,3723,"['Everyone', 'well', 'aware', 'ups', 'downs', 'actor', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'life', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'love', 'hate', 'most', 'part', 'think', 'majority', 'American', 'have', 'same', 'opinion', 'well', 'publicized', 'turmoil', 'who', 'Celebrities', 'seem', 'garner', 'attention', 'worst', 'behavior', 'possible', 'people', 'days', 'seem', 'think', 'cool', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'Sheen', 'come', 'back', 'wild', 'ways', 'displayed', 'attempted', 'not', 'only', 'create', 'new', 'series', 'can', 'star', 'can', 'poke', 'fun', 'past', 'behavior', 'same', 'time', 'ANGER', 'MANAGEMENT', 'Sheen', 'Charlie', 'Goodson', 'ex-major', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'fit', 'rage', 'tried', 'break', 'bat', 'leg', 'only', 'injure', 'instead', 'thus', 'ending', 'career', 'Seeing', 'light', 'so', 'speak', 'turn', 'became', 'anger', 'management', 'therapist', 'successful', 'private', 'practice', 'still', 'occasionally', 'verge', 'anger', 'catch', 'most', 'main', 'focus', 'group', 'therapy', 'home', 'run', 'stereotypical', 'range', 'grumpy', 'old', 'guy', 'total', 'whack', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'might', 'make', 'laugh', 'whole', 'become', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'actual', 'people', 'get', 'know.Charlie', 'character', 'situations', 'chosen', 'be', 'involved', 'here', 'become', 'focal', 'points', 'various', 'episodes', 'one', 'divorced', 'still', 'fairly', 'good', 'grounds', 'ex', 'Well', 'good', 'sense', 'average', 'sit-com', 'good', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'stars', 'role', 'had', 'better', 'parts', 'up', 'well', 'here', 'two', 'share', 'daughter', 'early', 'teens', 'storylines', 'well', 'course', 'things', 'Charlie', 'daughter', 'how', 'behave', 'are', 'far', 'different', 'young', 'girls', 'series.When', 'not', 'attempting', 'bed', 'young', 'girl', 'randomly', 'involved', 'therapist', 'played', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'two', 'are', 'involved', 'friends', 'benefits', 'relationship', 'agree', 'take', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'become', 'therapist', 'other', 'course', 'Charlie', 'up', 'trying', 'weasel', 'around', 'when', 'can.The', 'series', 'hit', 'miss', 'mixture', 'old', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'new', 'attempts', 'push', 'envelope', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'sexual', 'taboos', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'others', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'Never', 'having', 'thought', 'TWO', 'A', 'HALF', 'MEN', 'was', 'funniest', 'thing', 'ever', 'made', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'perhaps', 'even', 'tad', 'level', 'humor', 'Watching', 'stars', 'tail', 'end', 'age', 'bracket', 'careers', 'involved', 'sex', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea.Actually', 'part', 'rather', 'sad', 'when', 'think', 'Sheen', 'acting', 'ability', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'projects', 'done', 'past', 'When', 'took', 'role', 'previous', 'series', 'became', 'caricature', 'aging', 'lothario', 'life', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'series', 'women', 'attempted', 'succeeded', 'bedding', 'week', 'Unfortunately', 'real', 'life', 'began', 'mimic', 'character', 'rather', 'be', 'escape', 'began', 'inflict', 'show', 'enough', 'so', 'left', 'show', 'almost', 'same', 'character', 'minor', 'differences', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'Sheen', 'go', 'back', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'displayed', 'films', 'PLATOON', 'rather', 'sort', 'knock', 'series.On', 'own', 'perhaps', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'recommended', 'few', 'episodes', 'jokes', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'problem', 'have', 'sit', 'rest', 'get', 'gems', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Sheen', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'off', 'screen', 'antics', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'character', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'mature', 'actor', 'will', 'have', 'wait']",N/A
