It has become, literally a classic, aside from the Classic Sesame Street. Memorial performances by Rita Moreno,  Judy Graubar, Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman and many others helped capture the humor, the fun and the joys of learning. Many children will be entertained, even if there are some materials that are not age appropriate. I have missed the Electric Company as it was cancelled due to the lack of viewing and due to the combined  popularity of Sesame Street.

I really never thought I would see any of this stuff ever again and would like to thank Shout! for making this dvd set possible.This set contains several episodes from each season. Thinking back to the early 70's while growing up I would have to say the definitive seasons were two, three, and four. The changes that were made starting with season five, as I remember, annoyed me for a few reasons. The music behind the newer opening ""moving up in a new way"" sounded like NFL films music and towards the end of the opening instead of repeating ""the electric company"" three times, it was sung only once. For some reason this turned me off; however, the drum roll with ""the electric company"" being spelled out was new and really cool. Also, the show started to lose it's ""groovyness"". I conclude that by that time I had learned much and was getting bored anyway - time to move on.I must say watching these episodes again brings back a time of happiness and thoughts of being young. We sure didn't realize we had it so good - growing up and learning with The Electric Company! Maybe I should get my three year old nephew to watch some of these episodes and see what happens!As an adult now and looking back I can say the casting of The Electric Company was nothing short of brilliant.

Its educational emphasis was on basic word recognition, spelling and pronunciation.  The fact that so many adults recall specific scenes from the show (as evidenced on numerous message forums) attests to the show's potenecy.What really set ""The Electric Company"" apart was its high standards.  The cast included many acclaimed actors (including oscar-winner Rita Moreno and Bill Cosby) and actors who earn their star status later (such as Morgan Freeman and June Angela).  As for the music and dialogue, it was nothng short of brilliant.  The show made frequent use of humor that could be appreciated by all age groups.  Contrast that to most children's fare today, which talks down to children and seems designed to alienate adults.One aspect that stood out for me was the frequency of inter-racial couples in the show's skits.  Not only did such couples appear (which you rarely see today) but the characters did not make a big deal about it, unlike say, Sesame Street, where they seem to insist on applauding themselves every time two people of different ethnicities interact.My one concern is the comment that they are targetting the adult nostalgia market.  It makes the show seem dated.  I used to watch the show on Noggin with my daughter, and I can truthfully say that the show is every but as effective, and as enjoyable, as it was back in the day.",5,Hey You Guys!

924616,A31A9GENAJYD64,B000AA4F2O,David M. Rossi,"[76, 84]","The Electric Company was just what it's name implies: a company of players, presenting an energetic show of fun sketches and animation with word sounds and letters on an almost electric level. I used to love to tune in to this show, even at the age of 4 which was earlier than the show's target audience of 6- 7. So many reviewers here have commented on the show's obvious appeal to even adults, but it's so much more than that. The fast paced show is obviously tuned to the merits of Sesame Street's 1970's approach to smart children's programming but unlike Street which is so heavily geared towards very young kids, Company pays off huge dividends in entertainment for anyone who is a fan of sketch comedy.As for the reviewer discussing hidden agendas or messages in the show, come on, lets get real here. The Electric Company was designed to be a phonics teaching medium that is STILL light years ahead of any of the many boring, pedantic excuses for learning systems or shows of today. The message is fun, and as a professional in the field of alternative modes of education for developmentally or crisis challenged kids, I can tell you that if you make learning fun and the child doesn't know he or she is learning, that's the most winning formula there is. Bottom line: if you are a fan of the show, buy the ""best of"" dvd's so that they get the message that we want ALL of the episodes of the show, not just what they consider the best ones. If you never have seen the show but are curious about it or love sketch comedy, check the show out. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. For the rest who want so much to find something wrong with ANYTHING positive, please go elsewhere to find your negative dosage. If you want to tear down children's shows, I assure you, there are many more worthy candidates that really WILL have you actually reaching for alcohol to numb your brain of the stupidity elsewhere that passes for children's programming.

The Electric Company is one of the most revered and loved children's educational series' of all time. The shows use of music and engaging adult actors was integral in teaching kids about phonics and skills they would need to become better readers. The show also introduced punctuation, grammar and sentence structure.The four disc DVD set is a welcome blast to the past. The set begins with the show's first episode which aired nearly 35 years on October 25th, 1971. Rita Moreno, who starred in the series and appeared in the first episode and many others episodes on the set provides an introduction to the first few episodes on this first disc. From the first episode you can tell that The Electric Company is a show that is a lot of fun for kids-and adults. It's fun learning with words and letters. Bill Cosby and a young Morgan Freeman also appear in the shows first episode. Watching Morgan Freeman as ""Easy Reader"" and Rita Moreno dancing is priceless. This show is such a wonderful trip down memory lane. Another actor who was an important part of the series is character actress Lee Chamberlin. Irene Cara also appears in episodes from the shows first season as a member of The Short Circus. What else is remarkable about this series is just how much the educational tactics used in the show held up over time. The show teaches as good then as it does now. My kids instantly fell in love with this series and I plan to use it as a learning tool in our home learning environment. As an educator (M.S. Curriculum and Instruction) I am so impressed with The Electric Company and wonder why it didn't last. Current shows like Beyond The Lions try to fill that gap but no show since The Electric Company has proven to be as educational and engaging as The Electric Company.The 4 DVD box set is as impressive as the show.

We all know how ground-breaking and eclectic (the show's original title, by the way) the show was. I have reduced my rating by one star because of a major gripe I have with distributor Shout Factory. I have noticed that much of the ""incidental music"" which was contained in the original series has been abbreviated or just cut out entirely from episodes. Apparently, someone at Shout Factory thinks this music is either too dated or inconsequential, so it has been diminished considerably on this DVD package. Well, I remember the incidental music fondly: sometimes it was used with graphics to illustrate words, sometimes it appeared as transitional music for a change in theme or subject matter. But the styles ranged from blues to funk to breezy pop, and many of the pieces could even be referred to as ""ambient"" long before the term ever entered the cultural lexicon. I remember reading the credits during the season's original run, and noted that many of these musicians were respected session men who went on to work with many established artists. For example, keyboard player Bayete can be heard on Peter Gabriel's second solo album. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that these musicians wrote the pieces as well, which is why I think giving them short-shrift like this is just plain wrong. As far as I'm concerned, the marketing department at Shout has some explaining to do.",4,Why Has 'Shout Factory' clipped the incidental music?,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1520,"['Yes', 'am', 'thrilled', 'other', 'Amazon', 'customers', 'finally', 'have', 'Electric', 'Company', 'seven-season', 'run', 'DVD', 'compendium', 'know', 'how', 'ground-breaking', 'eclectic', 'show', 'original', 'title', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'have', 'reduced', 'rating', 'one', 'star', 'major', 'gripe', 'have', 'distributor', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'have', 'noticed', 'much', 'incidental', 'music', 'was', 'contained', 'original', 'series', 'been', 'abbreviated', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'entirely', 'episodes', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'music', 'either', 'too', 'dated', 'inconsequential', 'been', 'diminished', 'considerably', 'DVD', 'package', 'Well', 'remember', 'incidental', 'music', 'fondly', 'sometimes', 'was', 'used', 'graphics', 'illustrate', 'words', 'appeared', 'transitional', 'music', 'change', 'theme', 'subject', 'matter', 'styles', 'ranged', 'blues', 'funk', 'breezy', 'pop', 'many', 'pieces', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'referred', 'ambient', 'long', 'term', 'ever', 'entered', 'cultural', 'lexicon', 'remember', 'reading', 'credits', 'season', 'original', 'run', 'noted', 'many', 'musicians', 'were', 'respected', 'session', 'men', 'who', 'went', 'work', 'many', 'established', 'artists', 'example', 'keyboard', 'player', 'Bayete', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'second', 'solo', 'album', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'musicians', 'wrote', 'pieces', 'as', 'well', 'why', 'think', 'giving', 'short-shrift', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'marketing', 'department', 'Shout', 'explaining', 'do']",N/A

In fact, both the Electric Company and vintage Sesame Street episodes (Sesame Streed Unpaved) used to air on Noggin after midnight. As a new Mom, I was THRILLED...especially since my son and I are both late-nighters. Sadly, Noggin took off both programs and only pre-teen angsty stuff is on late-night Noggin.My son is now learning to read so I bought this DVD series to help him. Oh...who am I fooling?! I also bought it because I couldn't wait to reminisce with all the cool skits on the Electric Company! Some of the hilarious and memorable things you'll find on this 4-Disc CD set include:*Greedy Greg Grabbed the Green Grapes*""I was walkin' down the street when...BOOM!""*Spidey versus the Spoiler*Several episodes of Letterman and The Spellcaster*The Silent E Song (""Who can turn a can...into a cane?"")*Several Easy Reader Episodes (""Easy Reader, that's my name..."" Go Morgan!)*The silhouettes (ch...ip....chip!)*Fargo North, Decoder*J. Arthur Crank*Love of Chair*Short Circus musical numbers*Guest stars like Oscar the Grouch and Big BirdWhat I had forgotten was just how incredibly educational the Electric Company is. Every single skit teaches reading...EVERY ONE! No skits are wasted by trying to be politically correct, teaching kids how to be nice and share, or demonstrating simplistic rote information over and over and over. No, the Electric Company never insulted our intelligence.Unlike what's on today.I can't believe what a wasteland children's TV is. PBS Kids was bad enough with it's drivel (Boohbah, George Shrinks, Teletubbies and other lame shows), and now that it's turned into PBS Kids Sprout as of 9/05, it's even worse! Kipper, Thomas the Tank Engine, James the Cat, Noddy...most of these have NO educational value and teach rudeness to boot! Noggin is a bit better, as is Discovery Kids, Nick Jr., and Playhouse Disney. But even THOSE networks pander to the lowest common denominator of mediocrity (which is a reflection of the adult society we live in). I've never come across a children's show that taught kids how to read just about every moment--let alone just throwing in a few truly educational skits!Why the Electric Company--all glorious 7 seasons--remains unreleased and unaired is beyond me. No wonder the brains of most children are rotting! They're fed a steady diet of violence, idiocy, and PC BS.I highly recommed this 4 disc set for both kids and Generation Xers. My 7 year old LOVES this set, and plays it quite often. It's already reinforced what I'm teaching him (blends, vowel teams, silent 'e', etc.). The skits are hilarious, even for adults (the ""in"" jokes are priceless), and it's great to see Bill Cosby, Rita Moreno, Morgan Freeman, Luis Alvalos and the others entertain and educate with flair and enthusiasm.They just don't make 'em like they used to...",5,Incredibly Educational...and a Hoot to Boot!,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2918,"['grew', 'up', 'Electric', 'Company', 'KNOW', 'vintage', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'helped', 'read', 'age', '4', 'fact', 'Electric', 'Company', 'vintage', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'episodes', 'Sesame', 'Streed', 'Unpaved', 'used', 'air', 'Noggin', 'midnight', 'new', 'Mom', 'was', 'THRILLED', 'especially', 'son', 'are', 'late-nighters', 'Sadly', 'Noggin', 'took', 'off', 'programs', 'only', 'pre-teen', 'angsty', 'stuff', 'late-night', 'Noggin.My', 'son', 'now', 'learning', 'read', 'so', 'bought', 'DVD', 'series', 'help', 'Oh', 'who', 'am', 'fooling', 'also', 'bought', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'reminisce', 'cool', 'skits', 'Electric', 'Company', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'things', ""'ll"", 'find', '4-Disc', 'CD', 'set', 'include', '*Greedy', 'Greg', 'Grabbed', 'Green', 'Grapes*', 'was', 'walkin', 'street', 'when', 'BOOM', '*Spidey', 'versus', 'Spoiler*Several', 'episodes', 'Letterman', 'Spellcaster*The', 'Silent', 'E', 'Song', 'Who', 'can', 'turn', 'can', 'cane', '*Several', 'Easy', 'Reader', 'Episodes', 'Easy', 'Reader', 'name', 'Go', 'Morgan', '*The', 'silhouettes', 'ch', 'ip', '.chip', '*Fargo', 'North', 'Decoder*J.', 'Arthur', 'Crank*Love', 'Chair*Short', 'Circus', 'musical', 'numbers*Guest', 'stars', 'Oscar', 'Grouch', 'Big', 'BirdWhat', 'had', 'forgotten', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'incredibly', 'Electric', 'Company', 'Every', 'single', 'skit', 'teaches', 'reading', 'EVERY', 'ONE', 'skits', 'are', 'wasted', 'trying', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'teaching', 'kids', 'how', 'be', 'nice', 'share', 'demonstrating', 'simplistic', 'rote', 'information', 'No', 'Electric', 'Company', 'never', 'insulted', 'intelligence.Unlike', 'what', 'today.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'wasteland', 'children', 'TV', 'PBS', 'Kids', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'drivel', 'Boohbah', 'George', 'Shrinks', 'Teletubbies', 'other', 'lame', 'shows', 'now', 'turned', 'PBS', 'Kids', 'Sprout', '9/05', 'even', 'worse', 'Kipper', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'James', 'Cat', 'Noddy', 'most', 'have', 'NO', 'educational', 'value', 'teach', 'rudeness', 'boot', 'Noggin', 'bit', 'better', 'Discovery', 'Kids', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'even', 'THOSE', 'networks', 'pander', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'mediocrity', 'reflection', 'adult', 'society', 'live', ""'ve"", 'never', 'come', 'children', 'show', 'taught', 'kids', 'how', 'read', 'just', 'moment', 'let', 'alone', 'just', 'throwing', 'few', 'truly', 'educational', 'skits', 'Why', 'Electric', 'Company', 'glorious', '7', 'seasons', 'unreleased', 'unaired', 'wonder', 'brains', 'most', 'children', 'are', 'rotting', ""'re"", 'fed', 'steady', 'diet', 'violence', 'idiocy', 'PC', 'BS.I', 'highly', 'recommed', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'kids', 'Generation', 'Xers', '7', 'year', 'old', 'LOVES', 'set', 'quite', 'often', 'already', 'reinforced', 'what', ""'m"", 'teaching', 'blends', 'vowel', 'teams', 'silent', 'e', 'etc.', 'skits', 'are', 'hilarious', 'even', 'adults', 'jokes', 'are', 'priceless', 'great', 'see', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Luis', 'Alvalos', 'others', 'entertain', 'educate', 'flair', 'enthusiasm.They', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'used']",N/A

924628,A1KXIC2B4ZZY7O,B000AA4F2O,John Palmer,"[1, 1]","About a month ago I broke down and ordered this first vol 4 disc set to have when my new LCD HDTV arrived and both arrived within a week of each other. To be honest, I was buying this for ME as I have no children.First of all, I was in the 1rst grade when this ground breaking show first hit the airwaves in 1971 and if I recall, it ran on my local PBS station in the late afternoons during the week, often followed by Sesame Street right before the evening programming began.I have to say that I think part of why I read so well and have such a command of the English language may well be because of this ground breaking show and as the years wore on - especially after it went off the air in 1985, I found myself at times recalling various segments, the sillhuette heads sounding out words, the music anyway was what I would recall, then I recall the Adventures of Letterman and other segments of the show. Well, fast forward to the DVD I now own and I have to say, I'm not dissapointed at all. In fact, I'm giddy that they chose to represent the shows, as they aired on PBS, including the original PBS logo at the end.Let me just say this, while geared to the 7-9 YO child learning to read, or read better, it also appeals to adults like me who recall viewing this as a child of a similar age. First off, this is as much a trip down memory lane as anything else and I'm almost through with viewing all of the DVD's in this first set (the last disc remains) and I've enjoyed viewing what they have included and have also enjoyed how the show has evolved over time. I'd forgotten the variations of the theme used in this show and seeing Rita Morano, Morgan Freeman, Bill Cosby and others go about helping the child learning to read in a hip fashion is such a refreshing thing to see in this day and age, let alone back then.It was, coincidentally here on the Electric company that I first heard of Rita Morano and then later realized she'd done much more than this later on. The graphics used, while simple and crude by today's standards, were way ahead of it's time due to what technology was available at the time.The DVD quality is supurb, given that this show was largely recorded to 2"" video tape. Some of the animated segments were indeed done to film and then transfered to tape during production. Given all of that and given that the 2"" Quad format was at best capable of 400 lines of video resolution - and given the age of the material, some of it over 35 YO now and given that what we are seeing on this DVD may not be the first gen 2"" masters, but a subsequent dub before the digital transfer, they all look quite good and render themselves very well on today's higher rez TV's despite the occasional drop out. That is in large part due to the quality of the digital transfer from older analoge video tape and the audio is supurb for it's time as well. I'm pleasantly surprised by that, given that older TV programming is often not known for being of high audio quality.A nit pick and that is, to my ears anyway, all newer voice overs are hard to understand, unlike the program itself, that is the bumps highlighting a fact between episodes and the intro's at the beginning of each episode amongst them and I listen through my stereo system, which is known for being quite clear sounding overall.Whether an actual kid, or a kid at heart in an adult body, this series will not dissapoint you as it's found to be just as entertaining for adults as for children. True, not all of the material will be understood by kids, but the adults will get the subtle subtext of some of the skits and that's a testament to how the show was thought out and produced - again, way ahead for it's time, and still is fresh and relavent today.",4,This show was/is still way ahead of it's time,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,3735,"['month', 'broke', 'down', 'ordered', 'first', 'vol', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'have', 'when', 'new', 'LCD', 'HDTV', 'arrived', 'arrived', 'week', 'other', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'buying', 'ME', 'have', 'children.First', 'was', '1rst', 'grade', 'when', 'ground', 'breaking', 'show', 'first', 'hit', 'airwaves', '1971', 'recall', 'ran', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'late', 'afternoons', 'week', 'often', 'followed', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'right', 'evening', 'programming', 'began.I', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'part', 'why', 'read', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'command', 'English', 'language', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'ground', 'breaking', 'show', 'years', 'wore', 'especially', 'went', 'air', '1985', 'found', 'times', 'recalling', 'various', 'segments', 'sillhuette', 'heads', 'sounding', 'out', 'words', 'music', 'anyway', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'recall', 'then', 'recall', 'Adventures', 'Letterman', 'other', 'segments', 'show', 'Well', 'fast', 'forward', 'DVD', 'now', 'own', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'dissapointed', 'fact', ""'m"", 'giddy', 'chose', 'represent', 'shows', 'aired', 'PBS', 'including', 'original', 'PBS', 'logo', 'end.Let', 'just', 'say', 'geared', '7-9', 'YO', 'child', 'learning', 'read', 'read', 'better', 'also', 'appeals', 'adults', 'who', 'recall', 'viewing', 'child', 'similar', 'age', 'First', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'almost', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'first', 'set', 'last', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'viewing', 'what', 'have', 'included', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'show', 'evolved', 'time', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'variations', 'theme', 'used', 'show', 'seeing', 'Rita', 'Morano', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'others', 'go', 'helping', 'child', 'learning', 'read', 'hip', 'fashion', 'such', 'refreshing', 'thing', 'see', 'day', 'age', 'let', 'alone', 'back', 'then.It', 'was', 'coincidentally', 'here', 'Electric', 'company', 'first', 'heard', 'Rita', 'Morano', 'then', 'later', 'realized', ""'d"", 'done', 'much', 'more', 'later', 'graphics', 'used', 'simple', 'crude', 'today', 'standards', 'were', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'due', 'what', 'technology', 'was', 'available', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'supurb', 'given', 'show', 'was', 'largely', 'recorded', '2', 'video', 'tape', 'animated', 'segments', 'were', 'indeed', 'done', 'film', 'then', 'transfered', 'tape', 'production', 'Given', 'given', '2', 'Quad', 'format', 'was', 'best', 'capable', '400', 'lines', 'video', 'resolution', 'given', 'age', 'material', '35', 'YO', 'now', 'given', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'gen', '2', 'masters', 'subsequent', 'dub', 'digital', 'transfer', 'look', 'quite', 'good', 'render', 'very', 'well', 'today', 'higher', 'rez', 'TV', 'occasional', 'drop', 'out', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'quality', 'digital', 'transfer', 'older', 'analoge', 'video', 'tape', 'audio', 'supurb', 'time', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'given', 'older', 'TV', 'programming', 'often', 'not', 'known', 'being', 'high', 'audio', 'quality.A', 'nit', 'pick', 'ears', 'anyway', 'newer', 'voice', 'overs', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'program', 'bumps', 'highlighting', 'fact', 'episodes', 'intro', 'beginning', 'episode', 'listen', 'stereo', 'system', 'known', 'being', 'quite', 'clear', 'sounding', 'overall.Whether', 'actual', 'kid', 'kid', 'heart', 'adult', 'body', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'dissapoint', 'found', 'be', 'just', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'children', 'True', 'not', 'material', 'will', 'be', 'understood', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'skits', 'testament', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'produced', 'again', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'still', 'fresh', 'relavent', 'today']",N/A
