1514985,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B006GH6IS4,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[0, 0]","Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of ""stadium"" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991 and Queen - Under Review 1973-1980 but these are mostly the ramblings of other people. This BD has probably the most real input from the band, mostly Roger and Brian as already mentioned, but for any fan, or anyone who simply wants to know more about the band, it's certainly worth the money.",4,"Insightful, somewhat condensed, ultimately bittersweet.",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,2580,"['Queen', '40', 'years', 'was', '2011', 'reissues', 'box', 'sets', 'books', 'documentaries', 'flooding', 'market.Among', 'little', 'documentary', 'gem', 'released', 'UK', 'mid', 'January', '2012', 'release', 'date', 'set', 'here', 'US', 'region', 'free', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc.There', 'been', 'consternation', 'fact', 'BD', 'longer', 'trimmed', 'DVD', 'release', 'can', 'offer', 'insight', 'BD', 'nice', 'picture', 'sound', 'means', 'stunning', 'most', 'footage', 'shown', 'documentary', 'old', 'not', 'restored', 'upgraded', 'HD', 'good', 'picture', 'not', 'stunning', 'one.The', 'main', 'feature', 'two', 'part', 'documentary', 'charting', 'beginnings', 'band', 'last', 'live', 'performance', '1986', 'then', 'what', 'came', 'next.Most', 'footage', 'narrated', 'interview', 'style', 'Brian', 'May', 'Roger', 'Taylor', 'mostly', 'John', 'Deacon', 'bass', 'player', 'seeming', 'have', 'disappeared', 'intentionally', 'public', 'eye', 'not', 'seen', 'much', 'footage', 'Freddie', 'obviously', 'old.There', 'quite', 'bit', 'new', 'footage', 'unseen', 'screen', 'tests', 'videos', 'unseen', 'live', 'aid', 'practice', 'padded', 'out', 'chronology', 'hits', 'shows', 'ups', 'downs.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'quiet', 'solo', 'attempts', 'not', 'only', 'Freddie', 'Brian', 'Roger', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'likes', 'Paul', 'Gambucinni', 'long', 'time', 'roadie', 'Peter', 'Hince', 'former', 'manager', 'as', 'well', 'news', 'reports', 'clips', 'covering', 'highs', 'lows.The', 'immense', 'crowds', 'South', 'America', 'mistake', 'Sun', 'City', 'long', 'time', 'break', 'USA', 'so', 'on.The', 'second', 'part', 'documentary', 'deals', 'high', 'points', 'virtual', 'split', 'then', 'masterful', 'reunion', 'Live', 'Aid', 'massive', ""'86"", 'tour.It', 'also', 'Freddie', 'health', 'decline', 'ultimate', 'end', 'delicately', 'handled', 'sad', 'very', 'bittersweet.So', '40', 'years', 'Well', 'yes', '25', 'years', 'last', 'live', 'concert', 'complete', 'band', '20', 'years', 'death', 'Freddie', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'absorbed', 'still', 'watching.Arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'rock', 'bands', '20th', 'century', 'certainly', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'founders', 'stadium', 'rock', 'who', 'left', 'endearing', 'legacy', 'great', 'music.Much', 'footage', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'other', 'documentaries', 'Queen', 'Review', '1980-1991', 'Queen', 'Review', '1973-1980', 'are', 'mostly', 'ramblings', 'other', 'people', 'BD', 'probably', 'most', 'real', 'input', 'band', 'mostly', 'Roger', 'Brian', 'already', 'mentioned', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'simply', 'know', 'more', 'band', 'certainly', 'worth', 'money']",N/A
1514986,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B006GH6IS4,"bass boy ""music fan""","[24, 24]","A very good documentary - told in two chapters (you can watch them individually or consecutively) on the standard DVD. It's interesting to hear Brian May and Roger Taylor talk about Freddie's illness, and although they don't specifically say how early Mercury knew he had HIV/AIDS, they hint that he may have known as early as during the pre-concert rehearsals for LIVE AID in 1985. And Queen did rehearse - a lot - for LIVE AID, which I hadn't heard before. Some of that rehearsal footage is seen here.Highlights include music-video ""rushes"" that feature alternate angles, takes and behind-the-scenes shots of Queen making their videos. The most shocking is a frail Mercury, in pain, standing up, for the ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" video. The on-the-set color footage, showing Mercury waiting for the camera to start, is haunting. His sharp jawline (from AIDS) looks like it could cut through steel. Mercury's left eye is noticeably blood shot, and he looks plain ill, yet he pulled off one of his greatest on-screen performances for the music video.It's nice to see the black-and-white film footage of Queen actually recording part of their ""News of the World"" album in 1977, and the 1976 live Hyde Park footage, although shown only in a couple too-brief segments, is magnificent. Footage of Queen's 1977 tour also is examined, through footage that wonderfully blends old videotape footage with film footage of the same gig.I also learned of Roger Taylor's hatred for the ""Hot Space"" songs that sported dance-like beats, and how Queen almost broke up in 1982/83.One of rock's greatest mysteries, though, has to be a now-missing-in-action John Deacon, Queen's bassist, who, for some reason, refused to take part in this documentary, as he has in all things Queen-related over the last several years. Is Deacon still alive? Anyone seen or heard from him? Supposedly Deacon gave May and Taylor his blessing to carry on with the Queen legacy, yet there's no word at all from Deacon. Was there any bad blood? Taylor was quoted a few years ago saying something like ""You'll have to ask John about that, and I don't think he's in the right place to talk about that now."" Maybe a bit of bad blood exists on John's part?",5,"4.5 stars for Queen - ""Days of Our Lives"" DVD",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,2220,"['very', 'good', 'documentary', 'told', 'two', 'chapters', 'can', 'watch', 'individually', 'consecutively', 'standard', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Brian', 'May', 'Roger', 'Taylor', 'talk', 'Freddie', 'illness', 'do', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'say', 'how', 'early', 'Mercury', 'knew', 'had', 'HIV/AIDS', 'hint', 'may', 'have', 'known', 'as', 'early', 'pre-concert', 'rehearsals', 'LIVE', 'AID', '1985', 'Queen', 'did', 'rehearse', 'lot', 'LIVE', 'AID', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'seen', 'here.Highlights', 'include', 'music-video', 'rushes', 'feature', 'alternate', 'angles', 'behind-the-scenes', 'shots', 'Queen', 'making', 'videos', 'most', 'shocking', 'frail', 'Mercury', 'pain', 'standing', 'up', 'Are', 'Days', 'Lives', 'video', 'on-the-set', 'color', 'footage', 'showing', 'Mercury', 'waiting', 'camera', 'start', 'haunting', 'sharp', 'jawline', 'AIDS', 'could', 'cut', 'through', 'steel', 'Mercury', 'left', 'eye', 'noticeably', 'blood', 'shot', 'plain', 'ill', 'yet', 'pulled', 'off', 'one', 'greatest', 'on-screen', 'performances', 'music', 'video.It', 'nice', 'see', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'footage', 'Queen', 'actually', 'recording', 'part', 'News', 'World', 'album', '1977', '1976', 'live', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'footage', 'shown', 'only', 'couple', 'too-brief', 'segments', 'magnificent', 'Footage', 'Queen', '1977', 'tour', 'also', 'examined', 'footage', 'wonderfully', 'old', 'videotape', 'footage', 'film', 'footage', 'same', 'gig.I', 'also', 'learned', 'Roger', 'Taylor', 'hatred', 'Hot', 'Space', 'songs', 'sported', 'dance-like', 'beats', 'how', 'Queen', 'almost', 'broke', 'up', '1982/83.One', 'rock', 'greatest', 'mysteries', 'though', 'be', 'now-missing-in-action', 'John', 'Deacon', 'Queen', 'bassist', 'who', 'reason', 'refused', 'take', 'part', 'documentary', 'things', 'Queen-related', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'Deacon', 'still', 'alive', 'Anyone', 'seen', 'heard', 'Supposedly', 'Deacon', 'gave', 'May', 'Taylor', 'blessing', 'carry', 'Queen', 'legacy', 'word', 'Deacon', 'Was', 'bad', 'blood', 'Taylor', 'was', 'quoted', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'saying', 'something', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ask', 'John', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'place', 'talk', 'now', 'Maybe', 'bit', 'bad', 'blood', 'exists', 'John', 'part']",N/A

It tells the story of four college students met up in 1971and started one of the world's greatest rock and roll bands. Since their forming, the band recorded an astonishing 26 albums with estimates of sales of between 150 and 300 million units.  With numbers like that, it's no mystery how and why the band's music is embedded both in the soundtrack of our youth and in our musical and societal DNA.Directed by Matt Casey and produced by long-time Queen collaborators Simon Lupton and Rhys Thomas, it is in this DVD that, for the first time, the band shares their incredible story. The two-disc set is a treasure trove of interviews - including new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor - as well as recently discovered video of the band's first ever television performance and other never-before-seen archival footage.In telling what drove this must-have documentary, Rhys Thomas said, ""We set out to make the definitive Queen documentary. It's a funny, honest, inspiring and ultimately tragic account of `a certain band called Queen, as told by the band themselves.  We tell the story of four students who met in West London, slogged hard and conquered the world, ultimately changing the world forever.""In the UK in May, 2011, BBC broadcast Queen: Days of Our Lives over two nights to a reported 3 million viewers, resulting in it being the highest rated TV show in its time slot.I enjoyed watching every second of each disc.  It's that good.  There are two segments that are particular Boomerocity favorites:* Guitarist Brian May tells of bringing his parents over from the UK to see Queen perform at New York's Madison Square Garden.

Is really an exclusive experience to really get to know more about the Queen band; because, if you remember, there were always an incredible silence and hermetism with a lot of things and circumstances concerning within the band. Not only about Freddie Mercury!!!... My experience with this video buster (for real Queen fans) was the experimentation of very intense feelings, it's really and emotive film that shows the human side of four big musicians; from the situation of Brian with his father about being a musician (""Thank you Madison Square Garden...""), to the Freddie's goodbye with the video filmation of the track ""These Are The Days Of Our Lives"" and his final passing away (I was really crying with all that situations, like if all the situations just had happened!)... Since my very young years I have been a real Queen Fan that love almost all the Queen Music... It's a very introspective video with a lot of friends and media broadcast people that coments about the band's career, songs, and every aspect of the fab four monarchy. Plus several amazing new footage clips of classic songs like ""Somebody to Love"" or ""We Are The Champions"" just to name two videos that I really enjoy again like it was yesterday... Very recomended!And there is another part of the band's story, a thing that was not revealed before, and it's about the unrespectfull relatioship between the English press and Queen... As I can tell, through my real experience with the media: the truth is that behind all that image of fashion in some of the mediums (in this case the english Press), there are a lot of selfish interests of the editors, writers, managers, etc. prove to all of this, is the Brian May's video comment: "" Maybe if you got too succesful too quick, as they thought, there was a resentment there that they hadn't made you, therefore they wanted to break you""... Nowadays the thing is that there is no more good Rock music, no more good Rock bands at all in this planet. because all that have airplay by radio or T.V. are created by people that really don't mind the Rock music but just the plastic and their money interests. and It's really a shame!.

Queen also toured for four years with Bad Company's Paul Rodgers to sold out stadiums around the globe.In terms of significance however, nothing trumps Queen's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. While this might not have silenced all the critics who claimed Queen was an overly theatrical version of Muzak - it certainly justifies a long form documentary.This BBC produced 2 hour documentary will delight fans. It also makes a case for reconsidering this band of college chums who sold over 100 million records. Taking a chronological approach it visits the early days of at Cambridge and how they really took off when they added lead singer/pianist Farrokh Bulsara (aka Freddie Mercury). Freddie was lightning in a bottle and arguably one of the greatest front men in the history of rock and roll. His Live Aid performance was a master class in what it means to be a rock star.But the story goes deeper than Mercury. Each of the four band members wrote hit songs. This is unusual. So too is guitarist Brian May's PhD in Astrophysics. Loaded with interviews old and new, this is a well paced and never boring production. Of particular interest to fans will be the interviews with reclusive bassist John Deacon. While they are old - he no longer participates in the band - they are illuminating. So too are all the interviews which are articulate and heart felt.Make no mistake though, it is a sad story that revolves around Mercury. He was the real deal. He could write hit songs, produce, sing, and play a very accomplished piano. He was also a front man whose gayness somehow didn't diminish his power or appeal. Sadly, his death will always define the band.So check it out - 4 stars for must see music documentary!",4,Queen - Time has been kind to their music,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,2405,"['Eagle', 'Vision', 'string', 'great', 'music-lovers', 'DVDs', 'release', 'Queen', 'Days', 'Lives', 'Blu-ray.Since', 'death', 'flamboyant', 'front', 'man', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'AIDS', '1991', 'Queen', 'popularity', 'remarkably', 'persisted', 'Fox', 'Glee', 'featured', 'show', 'songs', 'Queen', 'big', 'hit', 'Bohemian', 'Rhapsody', 'had', 'bit', 'renaissance', 'thanks', 'prominent', 'hilarious', 'use', '1992', 'movie', 'Wayne', 'World', 'was', 'also', 'George', 'Michael', 'top-of-the-charts', 'cover', 'Somebody', 'Love', '1992', 'American', 'Idol', 'reunited', 'band', 'back', 'up', 'two', 'finalists', 'rendition', 'are', 'Champions', 'capping', 'off', 'highly', 'rated', 'Adam', 'Lambert', 'season', 'Queen', 'also', 'toured', 'four', 'years', 'Bad', 'Company', 'Paul', 'Rodgers', 'sold', 'out', 'stadiums', 'globe.In', 'terms', 'significance', 'however', 'nothing', 'trumps', 'Queen', 'induction', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', '2001', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'silenced', 'critics', 'who', 'claimed', 'Queen', 'was', 'overly', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Muzak', 'certainly', 'long', 'form', 'documentary.This', 'BBC', 'produced', '2', 'hour', 'documentary', 'will', 'delight', 'fans', 'also', 'case', 'reconsidering', 'band', 'college', 'chums', 'who', 'sold', 'over', '100', 'million', 'records', 'Taking', 'chronological', 'approach', 'early', 'days', 'Cambridge', 'how', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'when', 'added', 'lead', 'singer/pianist', 'Farrokh', 'Bulsara', 'aka', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'Freddie', 'was', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'front', 'men', 'history', 'rock', 'roll', 'Live', 'Aid', 'performance', 'was', 'master', 'class', 'what', 'be', 'rock', 'star.But', 'story', 'deeper', 'Mercury', 'four', 'band', 'members', 'wrote', 'hit', 'songs', 'unusual', 'So', 'too', 'guitarist', 'Brian', 'May', 'PhD', 'Astrophysics', 'Loaded', 'interviews', 'old', 'new', 'well', 'paced', 'never', 'boring', 'production', 'particular', 'interest', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'interviews', 'reclusive', 'bassist', 'John', 'Deacon', 'are', 'old', 'no', 'longer', 'band', 'are', 'illuminating', 'So', 'too', 'are', 'interviews', 'are', 'articulate', 'heart', 'felt.Make', 'mistake', 'sad', 'story', 'Mercury', 'was', 'real', 'deal', 'could', 'write', 'hit', 'songs', 'produce', 'sing', 'play', 'very', 'accomplished', 'piano', 'was', 'also', 'front', 'man', 'gayness', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'power', 'appeal', 'Sadly', 'death', 'will', 'always', 'define', 'band.So', 'check', 'out', '4', 'stars', 'must', 'see', 'music', 'documentary']",N/A

How much we need the ""Queen"" of this documentary...If you see NOTHING else, watch Brian talk about his dad, and playing MSG for the very first time, and ""Love of My Life"". That is as poignant, and spiritual, and lovely and wonderful piece of video as I've ever seen. And you watch Freddie's decline throughout the entire second part, and see how HARD he fought just to present a ""whole person"", where you could tell he was dying. Watching him perform the video for ""These are the Days of Our Lives"" is almost impossible to do, as poor Freddie just looks skeletal. And you hear Bri tell of a story where Freddie shows his leg to Bri while their are out on a break from a session (I'm guessing maybe it was some Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions on  the leg  or something), and Bri recoils---and yet Bri tells of Freddie actually apologizing for putting his friend and bandmate into such a position. Once again, just moving, and riveting. I'd also  never seen Roger cry---but  when he finally gets to the ""end"", he simply cannot go on. You won't be able to either. There are happy and victorious moments all throughout, but the second half is very difficult.I really hate that Deacon John decided to skip out on the whole music Kingdom, but I respect that; however, it'd have been nice to really have his current thinking in this wonderful and sensitive documentary.Queen is/was the smart man's Rock band.

Part One covered their most powerful and popular era of their career.  The seventies.  From Queen's debut album up to ""The Game"", which is my main concerned era of the band.  But, to talk about 8 great albums in only one hour, caused them to only discuss the hit songs from these eight albums, and they didn't even mention all the many hits of that era.  If you had this documentary, and only their ""greatest hits"" CD, and if you knew nothing else of Queen, you would really only get into the first hour of this documentary.I wanted to hear more about the fabulous songs on ""Sheer Heart Attack"", ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""Day at the Races"" and a discussion and perhaps some session performances of these tracks in the raw. The bonus extras talk a little bit more about the separate albums, but very little.  I really wanted to have more.Now, on the Part Two of the main documentary, they started strong with ""Under Pressure"" with David Bowie, but then quickly revolved in the band losing their familiar style and appeal to the rock world, and then also, the quick decline or Freddie Mercury's health.  They spent a long portion of an hour on that subject alone.  It dragged, and it even bored me, but most of all, it depressed me.  I wanted to hear a celebration of the works of ""Queen"", not go deeply into Freddie Mercury's declining health, and to see his sickly final moments. I found part two of this documentary extremely ""unentertaining"". They had a few successful concerts, but their albums through the eighties weren't selling their sound like they had in the seventies.There is an excellent DVD on ""Queen: the making of ""A Night at the Opera"".  Now, I would love to have a separate DVD of all eight of their first albums, individually. But, that's not gonna happen.I have Queen's CD box set ""The Crown Jewels"" (the first eight albums), and I have their Blu-Ray release of their 1982 concert in Montreal, Canada.  I guess that's all the Queen that I need.  I probably won't play this Queen documentary again, unless I were to have a friend over who'd like to watch it.  I would certainly give a verbal fore-warning because this documentary can leave you feeling depressed about the legacy of Queen.  I've seen things now, that I wish I hadn't.So, be prepared for some emotional disappointment with this documentary.  You certainly won't stand up and cheer.
