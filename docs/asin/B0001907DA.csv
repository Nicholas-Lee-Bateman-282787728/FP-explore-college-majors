This series is perhaps the worst in the world if you want to get police references.However, I really don't think that the true daily police life was the point to the film. If you listen to the commentary for the first movie, the director, and cast members admit that really was not the point of the movies.The point was to make people laugh and try something different during the time. It's great because no one dies and it really is just for laughs.So if you don't think you'll be offended by the most insane police deceptive work and wacky one liners.

796653,A2ZQD77EEXEPM6,B0001907DA,dylan,"[54, 61]","This is a great box set.  The Police Academy series is my favorote comedy series along with the Naked Gun series, National Lampoons Vacation series, Austin Powers series and the Scary Movie series.  I'm so glad that the sereis is finally on dvd.  The first two may be to bad for kids under 9 but the rest of them are for the family to enjoy.  Of coarse, the first one is in a 20th Anniversary Special Edition.  Police Academy 1,2,3,6 and 7 will be in widescreen and Police Academy 4 and 5 will be in a fullscreen which I think is stupid.  If most of them are in widescreen, why not make them all widescreen.  But what can you do about it.  The first film will have a great commentary to go with it.  The other films will just have a trailer and documentary.Police Academy- This is the best of the series and had me laughing all the way through.  Tackleberry made me laugh like crazy.  ""DROP THE STERIO, OR I'LL BLOW YOUR DAMN NUTS OFF.""  This is a good deal in this box set, and is still a believable movie.  10/10  Rated R for language, adult humor, and nudity.Police Academy 2: Their First Assinment- This is almost as funny as the first and had most of the characters from the first one.  I wonder why George Martini wasn't in anymore of the Police Academy films.  ""You have the right to sing the blues"".  9/10  Rated PG-13 for language, adult humor, mild violence and brief nudity.Police Academy 3: Back In Training- This is a great, funny and strong entry in the series.  Zed and Sweetchuck are a team in this (but Sweetchuck hates Zed.)  The only part I didn't like was the boring boat chase at the end.  ""People used to say I was a real jerk, but now I'm a people guy.""  This was a funny movie.  9/10  Rated PG for mild language, violence, and some crude humor.Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol- This is a funny movie.  In this one, Harris returns and Proctor is his partner.  Althou this filmisn't the best in the series, it is still funny.  Why wasn't Fackler in this one. ""Gene, Gene made a machine, Joe Joe made it go, Art Art blew a fart and blew the damn thing apart"". Get ready to laugh.  8/10Rated PG for language, crude humor, and some mild violence.Police Academy 5: Assinment Miami Beach- This is another strong entry in the series and is a bit better than number 4.  Harris and Procter steal the show in this one big time.  Too bad Steve Guttenberg didn't make any more. ""Now I have to kill you, nothing personal"".  8/10Rated PG for mild language, humor, and some violence.Police Academy 6: City Under Seige- This is the second best in the series.  Fackler returns, but House is gone.  This has a cool car chase at the end of the film.  It's cool when Jones does Terminator.  ""Target, HUMAN"".  So get ready to laugh in this slapstick.  10/10Rated PG for crude humor, language, and violence.Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow- This is an ok movie but is a bit too slow and not funny.  I guess it's not a terrible movie and is good for a chuckle on a boring Sunday afternoon.  ""We're in deep borse.""  4/10Rated PG for mild sensuality.So, this is a great box set and most of the movies are hilarious.

796664,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B0001907DA,Marty Gillis,"[5, 5]","All SEVEN 'Police Academy' films in one box! WOW! And all of them presented in glorious 1080p with uncompressed Mono (original) soundtracks. Before I even start, this set represents true value for money.  If you are even close to being on the fence about this purchase, JUST DO IT! Just click the ""Place my Order"" link and you'll be glad you did!If you're here,and reading this, then you already know what these films are. Installments 1 thru 4 are the best, with #5 not so good but #6 being better than #5 at least. #7 probably shouldn't have been made period... but still has a few good laughs in it. Regardless, I find the Police Academy films to be very entertaining and a good way to cheer myself up and have some lighthearted laughs. It's a great dose of nostalgia to see the cast do their stuff again. Just the thing to watch while you clean your goldfish bowl.These are classic (so to speak) 80's comedies. Low budget? You bet. Do they still hold up? YEP!  Just seeing the sign for ""The Blue Oyster"" and I was laughing out loud and suppressing the urge to Tango. LOL  ALL your favorite 'Police Academy' films are here so there is really something for every fan of the series. My personal overall favorite has to be #4, ""Citizens on Patrol""....... (Bobcat rocks in that one!)BUT ENOUGH ALREADY!  How does it look and how does it sound and do ya get any Special Features?  All your questions will be answered so read on McDuff !Housed in a semi sturdy and colorful cardboard sleeve, you get 3 inner hard plastic cases. Three discs in one, and two each for the others. All the discs have matching graphics (plain looking) and all the menus look alike. The disc media is robust and my overall impression when opening this set was ""WOW, This is really nice!""  Each film has their own disc obviously...... A nice touch.  The bit rates are on the high side and the average picture quality is a solid 3 and  stars out of 5 with it straying into 4 and 4  occasionally, depending on the film. The discs are Region Free and playable on any Blu ray player.Considering how low the budgets were on these (at least at first) the picture quality of these transfers are really much better than I had hoped for. Colors are GOOD. They are frequently GREAT.  The original color timing seems to have been preserved for each title. Nothing is too ""off""..  A few encoding problems here and there were spotted, mostly having to do with motion handling. Either that, or there were actual missing frames from time to time. It doesn't happen often and unless you are looking for it you probably won't even notice......The image is reasonably sharp with minimal noise.  Lots of natural film grain but not overly so. Basically, these were done right. No over-usage of sharpening tools or DNR can be seen. Occasionally you can spot DNR at work but only on problematic scenes that most likely needed it anyway to be presentable.  I found myself saying over and over ""If Only my Blu Ray of '48 Hours' looked this good, I would be so happy"" .......  (with '48 Hours' being my most disappointing Blu Ray hands down)So picture quality wise, these films really look GOOD on Blu Ray. It is NOT demo material for your system, but it is way more than just barely watchable.  Two thumbs WAY UP to the team that cleaned up and scanned these in..... All of em look better than you might expect and nothing in the video presentation took away from my enjoyment of the series.SO OK, the picture is really good, how about the sound?Again, these were low budget features so the sound never WAS all that good to begin with. However, the overall sound, including dialogue, effects and music is pleasing to the ear. Problems with production sound can't be eliminated but I never found myself having to strain to hear anything. Music was fine, full range and not distorted. These are the original mono mixes (the last film is presented in stereo) and presented in uncompressed DTS HD format. Very nice and a real kick to both SEE and HEAR them at this level after so many years of sub standard cable and pay TV broadcasts.OK then, both PICTURE and SOUND are really good ... They couldn't possibly kick in with some decent special features? Well,COULD they?The answer is YES, YES and another YES!!!  'Police Academy 1-7: The Complete Collection' has a great variety of special features including commentaries on all the films and special featurettes. Some are in HD and were made especially for this release, while others are ported over from the original DVD releases. Bottom line is, you are getting a TON of great stuff here! Almost everyone participated in the special features as well. From Steve Guttenberg to G.W Bailey and the great George Gaines...... Bubba Smith is there along with Marion Ramsey and so many more....... I found myself watching each set of special features after viewing each film. None of them bored me and I was very glad they were included. Hearing the stars doing their commentaries was a real treat as well......Really, after already having the 7 films in such great shape, it is just really cool to have all these special features thrown in on top of it.Bottom Line:  'Police Academy 1-7: The Complete Collection' is a no lose proposition. You get all 7 films in good shape with good picture and sound, plus a TON of bonus features and all put together in a  nice looking case.  If you enjoyed these years ago or just discovered them recently, the 'Police Academy' series will entertain you for a good long while. They have GREAT rewatchability built in and are sure to bring you lots of pure movie enjoyment, time after time.An excellent value and guaranteed to make you laugh!

796665,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0001907DA,Micheal Hunt,"[17, 20]","What a terrific low price for 6 great films! Plus one thrown in for free.The Police Academy box set contains all 7 movies on 7 discs. But I don't like the packaging they come in. They are 7 individual CARDBOARD case's. I hate those cardboard ones with plastic glued to them, they are too easy to damage, look bad next the regular cases on your shelf, but at least they all come in one box. The cheapo's making these thing's should be shot, but least you get a box to hide them all in I suppose. For me personally, I think the box set should have came with, maybe just 3 discs? All the bonus material of the commentary and stuff on one disc with the original and best Police Academy 1. Put all the featurettes and making of's and deleted scenes on that first disc. Parts 2 + 3 + 4 on disc 2, and parts 5 + 6 + 7 on the 3rd disc! They would all fit. We do have the technology to build this.. but no, they are separated. Oh well. Making it look bigger I guess is more important than quality and convenience.POLICE ACADEMY - The original and the best. The movie you either love or hate, the movie that started it all off. Introducing us to beloved characters such as the smart @, mischief making degenerate Mahoney , Motor Mouth Jones, Fun Bags Callihan, Captain Harris, Moses Hightower, the bumbling accident prone Spakler, the nutcase and a half Takleberry, Commandant Eric Lassard and many, many more. the plot is about the new recruits of an Academy. They are brought in this time when the police academy is taking any old bum this year, which sets audiences up to go into one comedic ride of fun. If you don't laugh at the movie's jokes, then you just cannot have a sense of humor then?! And to those of you who said that the movie is so far fetched ,and isn't realistic enough like real life cops? Ummmm... its a comedy... thats like saying the Wizard of Oz was a bad movie because there is no such place over the rainbow and it dosent really exist... real trees and scarecrow's and tin men and lions don't talk, let alone can function without parts of the human anatomy! It's a comedy...and its probably based more on reality then you'd think!PART 2 - Their first Assignment kicks of when Lassard's brother who is a chief of a prescient that's going down the drain and the streets are being run wild with crime and gangs. So when his brother asks Lassard for assistance, he sends just the right men for the job! Also introducing the funny and hilarious animal of a man Mr Zed (Bob Cat Goldwaith) who is just over the top crazy and funny. Also Lassards brother is... eh, that guy from ""Head of the class"" before Billy Connely took over. Also introduces the man to hate, Captain Mauser and his more popular side-kick, the goofy guy Proctor. A man who isn't playing with a full deck!Part 3 - Back In training: It's time for one of the states 2 academy's to be shut down. It's a decision for a comity to be made which is the better academy which will be the one that remains open. But with [now] Cmndt Mauser up to his unfair play, he's sabotaging Lassards academy to help his chances of winning.Part 4 - Citizens on Patrol: this is my favorite of them all, Lassard has put a community based program together to help get the community involved in helping stop crime. But as he vacations, the return of Captain Harris is a little jealous and against the program, and attempts to make it fail. But with new recruits and the old ones, the underdogs are to the rescue. Also it introduces David Spade and Sharon Stone. They only appeared in this film. But I beleive it was Spades first film?Part 5: Miami Beach: A favorite of mine, but not to others for some reason? I guess they just don't like the fact Steve Guttenberg didn't return to play Mahoney. Lassard has been honored as the police chief officer of the decade. And his award will be presented in Miami Beach Florida. And of coarse, he brings his friends and finest officers to join him. But soon trouble lurks as a gang of thieves get mixed up with a diamond problem, and Lassard gets kidnapped, so the boys n girls in blue are out to the rescue!Part 6: Also one that got put down, and you can see why. A crime syndicate has erupted in the area by a master mind. And it's up to the Police Academy to join Captin Harris's precinct to figure out, and stop the crime wave. Also shows the return of monster truck Big Foot, who was also in part 2, for some useless information for you. Not the best of the PA series, not the worst, but did start to venture into that over the top goofy style of events.Part 7: Mission to Moscow - Minimal laughs to me. Even with a bit more of a budget and filming one of the first American comedy's in Russia, I didn't feel like the movie had the same spirit as the other 6. The new lead guy, whatever his name is? (in 18 again/Diagnoses murder) didn't really seem like the type of new leader role. Also missing from the group is High Tower (Bubba Smith) and Proctor. A few laughs here and there, and even tho P.A movies have always been kind of goofy, I felt the 7th one was just too cartoon wacky to be liked. If I was buying the Movies individually, I would have skipped buying 7. But seeing as how its such a great price for all 7, I'll consider the 7th to be a thrown in for free movie with the other 6 as a coffee coaster. Even Ron Pearlman as the bad dude could not save this giant flop.The bonus features are decent. on the first disc you get commentary by a few of the characters and producer etc... and around about a 30 minute interview with cast and crew in a kind of re-union. And its sad to find out that Tackleberry has passed away in recent years. It would be nice to know what he thought about playing his manically ,gun crazy and loony role?All discs come with a short interview, and some with a little bit of on location, or on location interview footage. Not much to please tho. The only one that was really nice to see was part 4 Citizens on Patrol has ""Deleted Scenes""!!!! It was great to see some unseen footage from the movies! In the cometary they talk about cut scenes, and it would have been great to see them on the first one; but I guess the footage doesn't exist anymore? too bad.Overall: Excellent price for all 6 movies, plus you get part 7 thrown in for free (probably the only way to get any one to buy it?) Even tho 4 and 5 arnt in widescreen. It doesn't bother me, There great movies. And definitely without a doubt, one of the very few movies that has had successful sequels!",5,Great Price for all 6,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,6494,"['What', 'terrific', 'low', 'price', '6',

796667,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B0001907DA,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[2, 10]","The Police Academy movies are, sometimes, the greatest films to put in your DVD player on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a ""guilty pleasure-eighties flashback"", escape from our millenium age high pressure current lifestyle.  The films from the eighties are fun, non-sensical, and simply comforting compared to today's highly tense, bad taste comedies.The first Police Academy was the only one of the 7 which was rated R.  The rest were PG-13.  The first one was great because it was fresh and new.  I agree with many of the positive reviews Amazon's readers and reviewers said about it.  Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment, was improved and remained fresh because it added Tim Kazurinsky and Bobcat Goldthwait as new comic relief characters.  Police Academy 3: Back in Training, made these two new characters into police cadets.  Absolutely farcical, but yet, all the more reason that Police Acedemy maintained it's charm.However, it was at Police Academy 4: Citizen's on Patrol, that it seemed that they were starting to ""clutch at straws"" to get a laugh. I'll admit, I enjoyed these ""Police Academy"" movies back in the eighties. Honestly, I really only have seen the first two in the theatre. The third one I saw on cable TV. Now that I've bought the box set on DVD, I can honestly say that it is at this 4th sequel of the ""Police Academy"" films, that they really should have stopped right here. A lot of the humor is predictable and (most annoyingly) often repeated. For example, Winslow (Larvell Jones), was doing his silly ""karate man"" humor excessively through many of the ""Police Academy"" films. If he only did this in one film, the humorous impact would have been cherished more. The first three ""Police Academy"" films are the best. Taking this predictable slapstick into four more follow-up films (with totally forgettable stories) was just a bit too much. On a positive note, ""Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol"" starred Corinne Bohrer* as Laura. What a gorgeous blonde babe she is! And also, I'll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the ""Police Academy"" films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman. Marian Ramsey still looks good, too.  But, Bubba Smith?  Man, he's got a stupid looking haircut these days.  How embarrassing!As a whole, the price for this complete 7 DVD box set is a bargain, even if you do have to end up with the last three excruciatingly dull films.  It's cheaper to buy this box set than it is to just buy the first 4 seperately.  I suspect that the last 3 Police Academy DVD's will be filling the shelves of used DVD outlets very quickly.  I'm glad I got rid of mine.",3,"The first three are the best, PA 4 was saved by the girl*",1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2651,"['Police', 'Academy', 'movies', 'are', 'sometimes', 'greatest', 'films', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'guilty', 'pleasure-eighties', 'flashback', 'escape', 'millenium', 'age', 'high', 'pressure', 'current', 'lifestyle', 'films', 'eighties', 'are', 'fun', 'non-sensical', 'simply', 'comforting', 'compared', 'today', 'highly', 'tense', 'bad', 'taste', 'comedies.The', 'first', 'Police', 'Academy', 'was', 'only', 'one', '7', 'was', 'rated', 'R.', 'rest', 'were', 'PG-13', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'agree', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'readers', 'reviewers', 'said', 'Police', 'Academy', '2', 'First', 'Assignment', 'was', 'improved', 'remained', 'fresh', 'added', 'Tim', 'Kazurinsky', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'new', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'Police', 'Academy', '3', 'Back', 'Training', 'made', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'police', 'cadets', 'Absolutely', 'farcical', 'yet', 'more', 'reason', 'Police', 'Acedemy', 'maintained', 'charm.However', 'was', 'Police', 'Academy', '4', 'Citizen', 'Patrol', 'seemed', 'were', 'starting', 'clutch', 'straws', 'get', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'Police', 'Academy', 'movies', 'back', 'eighties', 'Honestly', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'theatre', 'third', 'one', 'saw', 'cable', 'TV', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'box', 'set', 'DVD', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', '4th', 'sequel', 'Police', 'Academy', 'films', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'right', 'here', 'lot', 'humor', 'predictable', 'most', 'annoyingly', 'often', 'repeated', 'example', 'Winslow', 'Larvell', 'Jones', 'was', 'doing', 'silly', 'karate', 'man', 'humor', 'excessively', 'many', 'Police', 'Academy', 'films', 'only', 'did', 'one', 'film', 'humorous', 'impact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cherished', 'more', 'first', 'three', 'Police', 'Academy', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'Taking', 'predictable', 'slapstick', 'four', 'more', 'follow-up', 'films', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'stories', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'positive', 'note', 'Police', 'Academy', '4', 'Citizens', 'Patrol', 'starred', 'Corinne', 'Bohrer*', 'Laura', 'What', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'babe', 'also', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'documentaries', 'making', 'Police', 'Academy', 'films', 'Leslie', 'Easterbrook', 'still', 'quite', 'attractive', 'looking', 'woman', 'Marian', 'Ramsey', 'still', 'good', 'too', 'Bubba', 'Smith', 'Man', 'got', 'stupid', 'looking', 'haircut', 'days', 'How', 'embarrassing', 'whole', 'price', 'complete', '7', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'bargain', 'even', 'do', 'have', 'end', 'up', 'last', 'three', 'excruciatingly', 'dull', 'films', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'just', 'buy', 'first', '4', 'seperately', 'suspect', 'last', '3', 'Police', 'Academy', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'filling', 'shelves', 'used', 'DVD', 'outlets', 'very', 'quickly', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'rid', 'mine']",N/A
