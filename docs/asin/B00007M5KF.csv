The story revolves around a somewhat spoiled gay young man just breaking away from his all-too-accepting family and trying stick his toe just a little further in the pool of gay life, and maybe scratch some itches along the way. His oh-so-worldy best friend thinks he should jump headlong into the fray, but the protagonist holds back, shielded by his poetry and his bourgeois values. The waves of neighborhood gay life pull him in, well over his head, into the larger chosen family, and it's quite a ride.Black and white works for this. The casting is spot on. There are echoes of John Waters all over the place, but that's not a bad thing.

732183,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B00007M5KF,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[1, 1]","Leather Jacket Love Story (originally filmed in 1996) is a delightful story of Kyle, a hot blonde 18 year old twink who has moved to West Hollywood to begin college. An education and pursuit of his poetry is not all Kyle is looking for, and certainly isn't all he is about to experience. Kyle has been out since puberty but other than a close relationship with his hot best friend Ian (kyle's ""first"") he is a bit inexperienced in the field of love. Unlike Ian and about everyone else in the gay scene, Kyle is searching for something deeper. Everyone wants a piece of this chicken, but he wants the real thing! A chance meeting with Mike, a 29 year old construction worker/biker hunk, just might have the makings of fulfilling Kyle's dream. Mike however is not the type to settle down with someone in a relationship and his feeling aren't quite the same as Kyle's. The two find themselves at odds on several issues including drugs, monogomy, love, poetry and basically life in general.Because of his infatuation with Mike, Kyle decides to get his own Leather jacket to identify more with Mike. He also gets his nipple pierced and starts smoking. Mike's influence might not be quite the best thing for Kyle, but in the end just whom will have the deepest influence on the other? A tender, romantic story with quite a mixture on campy, corny characters, some provocative sex scenes, a little comedy, a full mixture of character personalities and an essence of film noir. The entire film is shot in black and white which gives it a certain nuance, a nostalgic touch in addition to bringing out a little more innocense in the lead character. The film also contains a lot of hot nude guys that are quite appealing.The acting is superb by almost everyone appearing in the film, especially Sean Tataryn (Kyle) and Christopher Bradley who plays the part of Mike. The script, acting, casting and so on deserve a five star rating, however the production is rather low budget, the sound quality isn't the best, in fact there are parts of the film that the background noise is so loud that the dialogue between the actors can't be clearly understood. The DVD contains some extra features including outtakes and extra footage, but with video only, and is a bit redundant. Overall I give the entire project a strong 4 1/2 star rating and highly recommend it for your enjoyment.

732185,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B00007M5KF,Edward Aycock,"[16, 22]","I had a bizarre movie-viewing experience lately and rented this DVD on the day after I rented ""Jackass""; I greatly preferred ""Jackass."" ""Leather Jacket Love Story"" is yet another tiresome entry in a long line of recent gay-themed films (within the past 13 years or so) that do not show any promise in the world of what one charmingly calls ""Queer Cinema.""As somebody else has noted in a previous review, I think that one of the film's main problems is that the lead actor, Sean Tataryn, with his ""Herbie the elf dentist"" hair, is really not a very attractive kid and in reality, certainly would not command the attention he gets in the film; he is what I'd call ""charisma free."" This central casting mistake really weighs the film down. It's hard to see that so many men would grab Tataryn when he would walk into a room and try to engage his attention. This is most notable and flawed in the bath house scene. Tataryn's acting isn't much to go on either.Christopher Bradley as the older more worldly (and truly handsome) man tries to rise above the material, but with such bad dialogue, cliched situations and the use of full frontal nudity to mask the films flaws, it all just goes over like a lead balloon. I think a very interesting and touching film could have been made out of the relationship between Mike (Bradley) and Sam (the too good for this film Hector Mercado). The chemistry between the 2 of them seems very genuine and generates the only real warmth in the film.  Instead, we are treated the beginnings of a co-dependent relationship.Some of the more noticeable problems in the film: the grainy black-and-white photography, the use of silly 50's sitcom type music during a pivotal love scene (I have never witnessed a love scene so trite before), the overused drag queens who, in the end, really don't seem to serve any point, and any number of the bland, smiling extras who walk around with vacuous looks on their faces. Special mention goes to the ridiculous exchange between Tataryn and the sleazebag stripper who discusses his love for painting a certain type of his anatomy. This is one of the silliest, forced conversations in a film full of them.Rent this if you must, but this is not a film to waste your money on. The extras on this DVD are just prolonged scenes of male nudity and sex, with no real deleted scenes that would shed any more light on the film.",1,Lord spare us another film like this one,1049760000,"04 8, 2003",2003,2383,"['had', 'bizarre', 'movie-viewing', 'experience', 'lately', 'rented', 'DVD', 'day', 'rented', 'Jackass', 'greatly', 'preferred', 'Jackass', 'Leather', 'Jacket', 'Love', 'Story', 'yet', 'tiresome', 'entry', 'long', 'line', 'recent', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'past', '13', 'years', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'promise', 'world', 'what', 'one', 'charmingly', 'Queer', 'Cinema', 'somebody', 'else', 'noted', 'previous', 'review', 'think', 'one', 'film', 'main', 'problems', 'lead', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Tataryn', 'Herbie', 'elf', 'dentist', 'hair', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'kid', 'reality', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'command', 'attention', 'film', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'charisma', 'free', 'central', 'casting', 'mistake', 'really', 'film', 'down', 'hard', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'would', 'grab', 'Tataryn', 'when', 'would', 'walk', 'room', 'try', 'engage', 'attention', 'most', 'notable', 'flawed', 'bath', 'house', 'scene', 'Tataryn', 'acting', ""n't"", 'much', 'go', 'either.Christopher', 'Bradley', 'older', 'more', 'worldly', 'truly', 'handsome', 'man', 'rise', 'material', 'such', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'cliched', 'situations', 'use', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'mask', 'films', 'flaws', 'just', 'over', 'lead', 'balloon', 'think', 'very', 'interesting', 'touching', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Bradley', 'Sam', 'too', 'good', 'film', 'Hector', 'Mercado', 'chemistry', '2', 'very', 'genuine', 'only', 'real', 'warmth', 'film', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'beginnings', 'co-dependent', 'relationship.Some', 'more', 'noticeable', 'problems', 'film', 'grainy', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'use', 'silly', '50', 'sitcom', 'type', 'music', 'pivotal', 'love', 'scene', 'have', 'never', 'witnessed', 'love', 'scene', 'so', 'trite', 'overused', 'drag', 'queens', 'who', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'serve', 'point', 'number', 'bland', 'smiling', 'extras', 'who', 'walk', 'vacuous', 'looks', 'Special', 'mention', 'ridiculous', 'exchange', 'Tataryn', 'sleazebag', 'stripper', 'who', 'love', 'painting', 'certain', 'type', 'anatomy', 'one', 'silliest', 'forced', 'conversations', 'film', 'full', 'them.Rent', 'must', 'not', 'film', 'waste', 'money', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'prolonged', 'scenes', 'male', 'nudity', 'sex', 'real', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'film']",Leather Jacket Love Story

The DVD transfer looks very good considering it came from 16mm.  The black and white photography of Howard Wexler is quite beautiful.  The DVD includes one of David DeCoteaus less informative audio commentaries. While he is often quite the chatterbox on his audio tracks, David gets so caught up in watching this film that he often seems to forget he is recording a commentary track.  There are still some great insights from him however.  There are over a half hour of deleted scenes that also include audio commentary.

Cute as button, blonde and blue eyed Sean Tataryn plays a overly romantic, somewhat nave ""Kyle"" who falls for the dark and brooding ""Mike"" played by Christopher Bradley. The movie delivers a lot of laughs and positive, touching conclusion.I strongly disagree with all the other reviewers who dismiss Sean Tataryn in his role of the central character, ""Kyle"".  On the contrary, casting Tataryn as ""Kyle"", as the teenager from the suburbs who writes romantic poetry was inspired! Tataryn plays the role of ""Kyle"" with the perfect amount of innocence and naivet&eacute; that one would expect from a suburban kid exploring his options in the gay scene.Christopher Bradley is believable as ""Mike"", the blue collar, leather jacket wearing, motorcycle riding object of  Kyle's lust and affection. Mike is sort of ""Peter Pan"" character, cynical about love, hardened by life, and emotionally unavailable.Kyle turns out to be the perfect yin to Mike's yang, so the sexual tension between them is interesting to watch as their affair unfoldsAt first, Kyle's angelic looks and vulnerability stirs Mike's lust. But Kyle challenges Mike about his promiscuity, and stirs in him repressed feelings for emotional intimacy that Mike finds uncomfortable. The ending scene where ""Mike"" is so moved by Kyle's reading of a poem he wrote about their affair that he tears up the phone number of the ""trick"" he was seeing was as powerful and touching moment as I've ever seen in any romantic drama. .The movie has it's flaws, not the least was it`s $60,000 budget. The movie was shot 10 days with a circa 1969 camera in B&W; and combined with the generic 1950's soundtrack, which you may find out of context with the plot and the characters. But the worst flaw in my opinion, is that the movie couldn't seem to decide if it as a serious romantic drama or romp through gay camp. It's not surprising to learn that director was responsible for forgettable flicks with titles like Voodoo Academy and Creepozoids. I found the flood of drag queens and gratuitous sex scenes overwhelmed the dramatic potential of the plot.Leather Jacket Love Story DOES delivers a positive feel-good experience that is often hard to find in gay fiction and movies. It may even become a gay classic. Sadly this plot, the script and these actors could have delivered a much more complicated and moving picture then this feather duster. On the other hand, it's simple laughs and romantic plot make it the perfect ""fluff"" movie to curl up with on a friday night when you are too tired to go out, and too lonely to just stay home.

DeCoteau had toiled in the lower echelons of the exploitation movie business for many years (BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND, TEST TUBE TEENS FROM THE YEAR 3000, you get the picture) before commissioning screenwriter/poet Rondo Mieczkowski to write the gay drama DeCoteau had always dreamed of directing, and it took a year for the project to finally come together. But all good intentions are scuppered by a combination of threadbare production values and a reckless shooting schedule, both of which are characteristic of DeCoteau's directorial 'style'. Furthermore, the central romance isn't remotely believable, because - at the risk of sounding crude and disrespectful - Tataryn isn't attractive enough to warrant all the attention (he was chosen for no other reason than his willingness to perform the nudity and sex scenes!), and he plays the character as little more than a socially awkward debutante, completely at odds with Bradley's exerienced older guy, with whom he appears to have little in common.Howard Wexler's low-tech cinematography struggles to maintain the fairy tale ambience suggested by Mieczowski's ambitious script, and as usual, DeCoteau allows too many dialogue scenes to continue well beyond the limits of endurance. In a commentary recorded for this DVD, DeCoteau chides those critics who trashed his 'feel-good' approach in favor of the 'heavy dramas' which he himself seems to dislike, refusing to countenance the idea that some viewers simply weren't taken by his amateurish scribble of a movie!But there's still much to admire in this flawed venture. Mieczkowski's script may be dramatically uninspired, but his dialogue is smart and colorful, and he manages to prick the bubble of pomposity which informs his company of eccentric Silver Lake characters. Similarly, the cast is a mixed bag of newcomers and cult favorites: Bradley is an experienced actor (URBANIA, BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS, etc.) and director of animated shorts (""Backstage With Little Lorenzo""), and he has the kind of dazzling good looks which can stop any movie dead in its tracks. His full frontal nude scenes here are genuinely impressive! Exploitation fans will be surprised to see Nicholas Worth (THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) playing an ultra-theatrical gay poet, given his reputation as a fearsome screen villain, and he steals every scene in which he appears - his poem-readings are a hoot! Fashion model Geoffrey Moody makes his only screen appearance to date as Tataryn's best friend, a sluttish pretty boy with a penchant for rough sex, and it would have been interesting to see him cast in Tataryn's role (DeCoteau mentions that Moody was OK with the sex scenes but wasn't prepared to do full frontal nudity, which could have been accommodated without threatening the film's erotic potency).Also included in cameo roles are Andy Warhol/John Waters favorite Mink Stole (PINK FLAMINGOS, DESPERATE LIVING) and veteran gay activist Morris Kight, and DeCoteau's commentary reveals that Joe Dallesandro was considered for a major cameo in the movie, but he couldn't be found in time! Watch out for a truly memorable stripper (Dennis Larkin), and a hilarious cameo from Bob Prest as an irreverent doctor who pierces nipples and other body parts for a living!",2,Much to admire in deeply flawed comedy-drama,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,3779,"['LEATHER', 'JACKET', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'USA', '1997', 'black', 'white', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.37:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'MonoAn', 'aspiring', 'young', 'poet', 'Sean', 'Tataryn', 'Valley', 'LA', 'Silver', 'Lake', 'district', 'where', 'distracted', 'drag', 'queens', 'sex', 'clubs', 'gay', 'bashers', 'hunky', 'older', 'stud', 'Christopher', 'Bradley', 'whom', 'love.Shot', 'ten', 'days', '60,000', '16mm', 'black', 'white', 'inspired', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'MASCULIN-FEMININ', '1966', 'David', 'DeCoteau', 'LEATHER', 'JACKET', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'something', 'acquired', 'taste', 'DeCoteau', 'had', 'toiled', 'lower', 'echelons', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'business', 'many', 'years', 'BEACH', 'BABES', 'FROM', 'BEYOND', 'TEST', 'TUBE', 'TEENS', 'THE', 'YEAR', '3000', 'get', 'picture', 'commissioning', 'screenwriter/poet', 'Rondo', 'Mieczkowski', 'write', 'gay', 'drama', 'DeCoteau', 'had', 'always', 'dreamed', 'directing', 'took', 'year', 'project', 'finally', 'come', 'together', 'good', 'intentions', 'are', 'scuppered', 'combination', 'threadbare', 'production', 'values', 'reckless', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'are', 'characteristic', 'DeCoteau', 'directorial', ""'style"", 'Furthermore', 'central', 'romance', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'believable', 'risk', 'sounding', 'crude', 'disrespectful', 'Tataryn', ""n't"", 'attractive', 'enough', 'warrant', 'attention', 'was', 'chosen', 'other', 'reason', 'willingness', 'perform', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'socially', 'awkward', 'debutante', 'completely', 'odds', 'Bradley', 'exerienced', 'older', 'guy', 'whom', 'have', 'little', 'common.Howard', 'Wexler', 'low-tech', 'cinematography', 'maintain', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ambience', 'suggested', 'Mieczowski', 'ambitious', 'script', 'usual', 'DeCoteau', 'too', 'many', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'continue', 'well', 'limits', 'endurance', 'commentary', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'DeCoteau', 'critics', 'who', 'trashed', ""'feel-good"", 'approach', 'favor', ""'heavy"", 'dramas', 'dislike', 'refusing', 'countenance', 'idea', 'viewers', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'taken', 'amateurish', 'scribble', 'movie', 'still', 'much', 'admire', 'flawed', 'venture', 'Mieczkowski', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'dramatically', 'uninspired', 'dialogue', 'smart', 'colorful', 'prick', 'bubble', 'pomposity', 'company', 'eccentric', 'Silver', 'Lake', 'characters', 'Similarly', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'newcomers', 'cult', 'favorites', 'Bradley', 'experienced', 'actor', 'URBANIA', 'BILLY', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'SCREEN', 'KISS', 'etc', 'director', 'animated', 'shorts', 'Backstage', 'Little', 'Lorenzo', 'kind', 'dazzling', 'good', 'looks', 'can', 'stop', 'movie', 'dead', 'tracks', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'genuinely', 'impressive', 'Exploitation', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'Nicholas', 'Worth', 'LAST', 'HOUSE', 'ON', 'THE', 'LEFT', 'playing', 'ultra-theatrical', 'gay', 'poet', 'given', 'reputation', 'fearsome', 'screen', 'villain', 'scene', 'poem-readings', 'are', 'hoot', 'Fashion', 'model', 'Geoffrey', 'Moody', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'Tataryn', 'best', 'friend', 'sluttish', 'pretty', 'boy', 'penchant', 'rough', 'sex', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'cast', 'Tataryn', 'role', 'DeCoteau', 'mentions', 'Moody', 'was', 'OK', 'sex', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'do', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accommodated', 'threatening', 'film', 'erotic', 'potency', '.Also', 'included', 'cameo', 'roles', 'are', 'Andy', 'Warhol/John', 'Waters', 'favorite', 'Mink', 'Stole', 'PINK', 'FLAMINGOS', 'DESPERATE', 'LIVING', 'veteran', 'gay', 'activist', 'Morris', 'Kight', 'DeCoteau', 'commentary', 'reveals', 'Joe', 'Dallesandro', 'was', 'considered', 'major', 'cameo', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'time', 'Watch', 'out', 'truly', 'memorable', 'stripper', 'Dennis', 'Larkin', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Bob', 'Prest', 'irreverent', 'doctor', 'who', 'nipples', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'living']",Leather Jacket Love Story

I was completely taken with the indi feel of the film and especially of it's 2 stars - Chris Bradley and Sean Tataryn.  There was a great chemistry between the 2 and the story was well done through them.I have to disagree with some of the comments that Sean was in over his head as an actor and not someone you would notice on the street.  I NOTICED!  I thought his portrayal of Kyle was dead on as a young gay man finding his way and coming out and into his own.  And what a teacher to have in Chris Bradley!  Chris' Mike was the polar opposite of Kyle.  Comfortable in his skin yet knowing as an aging gay man that he had a short shelf life within the youth obsessed gay community.  The growing pains felt by both actors was incredibly honest and added depth to the movie that went beyond what the script was written as!I recently watched the film 3 Day Weekend which featured a pair of actors within the same situation.  An older guy falling in love with a younger guy and their working everything out.  I think even Queer As Folk did the same with Brian and Justin - so LJLS was ahead of the curve!Also a chance to shoot down an urban myth that Sean was only hired after ""dozens of other actors turned down the role because of its nudity and frank sexual content"" - as the director states on the commentary track! As in any movie several actors were brought in to read but no one seemed to be right for the role and no one was offered it. It wasn't the nudity or theme of the film - it was finding the right person to play Kyle. Then the director saw Sean in an acting class, invited him to audition and offered him the role.  That was it!  The nudity was discussed and Sean saw it as an important part of the movie and he had no reservations.  The package was complete.In full disclosure, since the film I have had the opportunity to talk with both actors and to tell them how wonderful I thought the film was.  I also heard the stories about Sean and found out 1st hand that the directors memory seems to be a bit cloudy!This is a great little indi film that deserves a viewing.  I'm not sure if it has been given to a new distributor or not, but I just saw that Here TV will be airing it in the next couple of months.  It would great to see a new group of people be exposed to this film.The extras are a lot of B roll from the sex club and the sex scene and the commentary track doesn't add a lot to the film.",4,Like a Leather Jacket - Gets More comfortable the more you wear it,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2483,"['first', 'saw', 'bunch', 'friends', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'indi', 'feel', 'film', 'especially', '2', 'stars', 'Chris', 'Bradley', 'Sean', 'Tataryn', 'was', 'great', 'chemistry', '2', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'them.I', 'have', 'disagree', 'comments', 'Sean', 'was', 'head', 'actor', 'not', 'someone', 'would', 'notice', 'street', 'NOTICED', 'thought', 'portrayal', 'Kyle', 'was', 'dead', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'finding', 'way', 'coming', 'out', 'own', 'what', 'teacher', 'have', 'Chris', 'Bradley', 'Chris', 'Mike', 'was', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Kyle', 'Comfortable', 'skin', 'yet', 'knowing', 'aging', 'gay', 'man', 'had', 'short', 'shelf', 'life', 'youth', 'obsessed', 'gay', 'community', 'growing', 'pains', 'felt', 'actors', 'was', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'added', 'depth', 'movie', 'went', 'what', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'recently', 'watched', 'film', '3', 'Day', 'Weekend', 'featured', 'pair', 'actors', 'same', 'situation', 'older', 'guy', 'falling', 'love', 'younger', 'guy', 'working', 'everything', 'think', 'even', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'did', 'same', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'so', 'LJLS', 'was', 'ahead', 'curve', 'Also', 'chance', 'shoot', 'down', 'urban', 'myth', 'Sean', 'was', 'only', 'hired', 'dozens', 'other', 'actors', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'nudity', 'frank', 'sexual', 'content', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'movie', 'several', 'actors', 'were', 'brought', 'read', 'one', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'role', 'one', 'was', 'offered', 'was', ""n't"", 'nudity', 'theme', 'film', 'was', 'finding', 'right', 'person', 'play', 'Kyle', 'Then', 'director', 'saw', 'Sean', 'acting', 'class', 'invited', 'audition', 'offered', 'role', 'was', 'nudity', 'was', 'discussed', 'Sean', 'saw', 'important', 'part', 'movie', 'had', 'reservations', 'package', 'was', 'complete.In', 'full', 'disclosure', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'talk', 'actors', 'tell', 'how', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'heard', 'stories', 'Sean', 'found', '1st', 'hand', 'directors', 'memory', 'be', 'bit', 'cloudy', 'great', 'little', 'indi', 'film', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'been', 'given', 'new', 'distributor', 'not', 'just', 'saw', 'Here', 'TV', 'will', 'be', 'airing', 'next', 'couple', 'months', 'would', 'great', 'see', 'new', 'group', 'people', 'be', 'exposed', 'film.The', 'extras', 'are', 'lot', 'B', 'roll', 'sex', 'club', 'sex', 'scene', 'commentary', 'track', ""n't"", 'add', 'lot', 'film']",Leather Jacket Love Story

""Leather Jacket Love Story"" was shot in 10 days in and around the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, as wanna-be poet Kyle tries to escape the pretensions of West Hollywood, and falls for dark and sexy construction worker Mike. Kyle is a awkward twink, Mike is a weathered older 30 something with the experience Kyle lacks.The opposites attract almost immediately, and the sparks do fly. In particular, Christopher Bradley (as Mike) is charismatic and lights up everything he does. There are several nude love scenes, for those who buy ""Gay Movies"" based solely on body-part count, but Mike and Kyle give convincing fling. But can love bind two men so many worlds apart from each other? Hey, this is a gay fairy tale, complete with drag queens, sunny skies, packed leather bars (Los Angeles' notorious Faultline) and little capital D Drama. When the gay bashers inevitably show up, they get whupped in more a funny manner than anything else. The low budget soundtrack even tips its hat to the tacky sounds of 50's sitcoms.""Leather Jacket Love Story"" is a feel good movie and will give you plenty of smiles. I found it surprising that, in a very tiny way, I had a small part in the film. When Mike and Kyle head into a store to buy Kyle's first leather jacket, there are magazines on the background wall.
