The reason the DVD is not is because of the length.  Several clips of interviews shown which have clearly been editted.  It would have been so much better if the whole interview had been covered.  I also agree with the other reviewers who stated the concert sequence was great, but a tease for more.  It would have been five plus stars if it had included the Wilburys.",4,I wish I could give it five stars,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,483,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'George', 'Harrison', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'learned', 'DVD', 'content', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'reason', 'DVD', 'not', 'length', 'Several', 'clips', 'interviews', 'shown', 'have', 'clearly', 'been', 'editted', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'whole', 'interview', 'had', 'been', 'covered', 'also', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'stated', 'concert', 'sequence', 'was', 'great', 'tease', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'stars', 'had', 'included', 'Wilburys']",N/A

First off, this DVD was basically a bonus disc to the "" Dark Horse"" boxed cd set.  That is exactly what it is...bonus material.  Perfect for a bonus sampler when it is part of an expensive boxed cd set.  Now we have an actual solo release of this DVD with a $24.95 list price which is a lot of money for a disc with little content.  Sure, Harrison fans will love the Video's from the Dark Horse Years and the 4 song live set with the Eric Clapton band recorded during their Japan Tour.  Those 4 live concert performances are the meat and potatoes of this disc, leaving the viewer wanting more.  I ask this question, Do they actually have the entire concert from Japan, which would be the ultimate Harrison DVD, if those 4 live cuts are any indicator of what the rest of the show was like.  I feel those live sequences are a teaser, and wouldn't be shocked if down the road we get an entire concert DVD ""George Harrison Live In Japan""?  I would say, if you are a big George Harrison Fan, you are going to enjoy this sampler DVD, but do not expect too much, because it lacks content, which could have made this a much more worthwhile DVD.  I still often wonder why his classic ""Concert For Bangladesh"", has not been released on DVD as of yet?",3,Could have been much better.,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,1304,"['release', 'DVD', 'wondering', 'lot', 'things', 'First', 'off', 'DVD', 'was', 'basically', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'boxed', 'cd', 'set', 'exactly', 'what', 'bonus', 'material', 'Perfect', 'bonus', 'sampler', 'when', 'part', 'expensive', 'boxed', 'cd', 'set', 'Now', 'have', 'actual', 'solo', 'release', 'DVD', '24.95', 'list', 'price', 'lot', 'money', 'disc', 'little', 'content', 'Sure', 'Harrison', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'Video', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'Years', '4', 'song', 'live', 'set', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'band', 'recorded', 'Japan', 'Tour', '4', 'live', 'concert', 'performances', 'are', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'disc', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'ask', 'question', 'Do', 'actually', 'have', 'entire', 'concert', 'Japan', 'would', 'be', 'ultimate', 'Harrison', 'DVD', '4', 'live', 'cuts', 'are', 'indicator', 'what', 'rest', 'show', 'was', 'feel', 'live', 'sequences', 'are', 'teaser', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'road', 'get', 'entire', 'concert', 'DVD', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Live', 'Japan', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'big', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Fan', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'sampler', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', 'still', 'often', 'wonder', 'why', 'classic', 'Concert', 'Bangladesh', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'yet']",N/A
