275585,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6301964063,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[17, 17]","Life Begins For Andy Hardy (1941) is a rather dark film in an otherwise happy, idyllic series of pre-World War II Americana.  Judy Garland makes her third and final appearance in this eleventh installment in the Hardy family saga, but her role is much less significant here than it was in her two previous appearances.  Young Andy (Mickey Rooney) has just graduated from high school, but he has little time to celebrate his new freedom.  His father, Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) compels him to think about his future, holding out the promise of a scholarship should he follow in his father's footsteps and study to become a lawyer.  At the same time, Andy parts ways with his long-time girl Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) as she heads off to college.  The prospect of seven years of schooling is not something Andy can get excited about, and his father agrees to let Andy go to New York, find a job, and then decide after a month whether he wants to continue working or go to college.  A visiting Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) accompanies Andy back to the Big Apple but soon finds herself somewhat isolated from the boy she continues to pine after.Andy's experiences in New York change him forever and do much to transform him into a man.  He struggles to find work, makes many mistakes, and finds himself virtually penniless at one point.  The young man whose room he takes at a boarding house tips him off on the job he just quit, but Andy's application for employment gains him nothing but the interest of a potentially dangerous young lady with a penchant for getting what she wants from men.  Jennitt Hicks (Patricia Dane) is a somewhat incomprehensible character to me; she is, in Betsy Booth's terminology, a ""wolfess,"" and she does subtly sucker this new kid in the big city for a gift or two early on, yet she also helps him get a job and seems to at least care for the boy in a nurturing sense at one point later on.  Betsy recognizes her for what she is early on, as does Judge Hardy when he first meets her.  This gives rise to a father-son speech which may sound like the essence of old-fashioned silliness to modern-day viewers but strikes me as a truly insightful, important defense of morality and the vows of marriage.  He speaks to his son about fidelity, advising him of the importance of being faithful to his future wife well before marriage.  It's a moral lesson few would subscribe to today, but I found great words of wisdom in this heartfelt father-son exchange.Andy Hardy hits a very low point during his time in New York, finding himself virtually penniless, but this pales in comparison to the feelings that grip him when a very real tragedy of the worst sort invades his little world.  Betsy is there for Andy when and if he needs her, yet he still thinks of her as something of a child and is too proud to accept her help in most things.  In the end, Andy's life-changing experience in the real world exerts a profound change upon him; he still retains some of that classic Andy Hardy spunk and free spirited nature, but he has in some very real ways become a man by the time this movie ends.  There is a lesson for the youth of today in this movie, as its theme and message are universal in nature.While Judy Garland sang several memorable songs in her first two Andy Hardy films, you will find no Garland musical numbers in Life Begins For Andy Hardy.  She actually did record four numbers for this film, including a wonderful version of Easy to Love, but none of these songs made it into the final cut.  Perhaps that was for the best, though, because her beautiful singing might well have taken something away from the overall darkness of a very serious film.  Growing up is not an easy thing to do, as Andy Hardy finds out for himself.  Thus, while this is among the less enjoyable of the Andy Hardy movies, it easily stands as one of the most important and valuable of them all.",5,Andy Hardy's difficult transition from boyhood to manhood,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,3908,"['Life', 'Andy', 'Hardy', '1941', 'rather', 'dark', 'film', 'otherwise', 'happy', 'idyllic', 'series', 'pre-World', 'War', 'II', 'Americana', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'third', 'final', 'appearance', 'eleventh', 'installment', 'Hardy', 'family', 'saga', 'role', 'much', 'less', 'significant', 'here', 'was', 'two', 'previous', 'appearances', 'Young', 'Andy', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'little', 'time', 'celebrate', 'new', 'freedom', 'father', 'Judge', 'Hardy', 'Lewis', 'Stone', 'think', 'future', 'holding', 'out', 'promise', 'scholarship', 'should', 'follow', 'father', 'footsteps', 'study', 'become', 'lawyer', 'same', 'time', 'Andy', 'parts', 'ways', 'long-time', 'girl', 'Polly', 'Benedict', 'Ann', 'Rutherford', 'college', 'prospect', 'seven', 'years', 'schooling', 'not', 'something', 'Andy', 'can', 'get', 'excited', 'father', 'let', 'Andy', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'find', 'job', 'then', 'decide', 'month', 'continue', 'working', 'go', 'college', 'visiting', 'Betsy', 'Booth', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Andy', 'back', 'Big', 'Apple', 'soon', 'somewhat', 'isolated', 'boy', 'pine', 'after.Andy', 'experiences', 'New', 'York', 'change', 'forever', 'do', 'much', 'transform', 'man', 'find', 'work', 'many', 'mistakes', 'virtually', 'penniless', 'one', 'point', 'young', 'man', 'room', 'boarding', 'house', 'off', 'job', 'just', 'quit', 'Andy', 'application', 'employment', 'gains', 'nothing', 'interest', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'young', 'lady', 'penchant', 'getting', 'what', 'men', 'Jennitt', 'Hicks', 'Patricia', 'Dane', 'somewhat', 'incomprehensible', 'character', 'Betsy', 'Booth', 'terminology', 'wolfess', 'subtly', 'sucker', 'new', 'kid', 'big', 'city', 'gift', 'two', 'early', 'also', 'get', 'job', 'least', 'care', 'boy', 'nurturing', 'sense', 'one', 'point', 'later', 'Betsy', 'what', 'early', 'Judge', 'Hardy', 'when', 'first', 'rise', 'father-son', 'speech', 'may', 'sound', 'essence', 'old-fashioned', 'silliness', 'modern-day', 'viewers', 'strikes', 'truly', 'insightful', 'important', 'defense', 'morality', 'vows', 'marriage', 'son', 'fidelity', 'advising', 'importance', 'being', 'faithful', 'future', 'wife', 'well', 'before', 'marriage', 'moral', 'lesson', 'few', 'would', 'subscribe', 'today', 'found', 'great', 'words', 'wisdom', 'heartfelt', 'father-son', 'exchange.Andy', 'Hardy', 'very', 'low', 'point', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'finding', 'virtually', 'penniless', 'comparison', 'feelings', 'grip', 'when', 'very', 'real', 'tragedy', 'worst', 'sort', 'little', 'world', 'Betsy', 'there', 'Andy', 'when', 'yet', 'still', 'something', 'child', 'too', 'proud', 'accept', 'help', 'most', 'things', 'end', 'Andy', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'real', 'world', 'profound', 'change', 'still', 'classic', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'spunk', 'free', 'spirited', 'nature', 'very', 'real', 'ways', 'become', 'man', 'time', 'movie', 'lesson', 'youth', 'today', 'movie', 'theme', 'message', 'are', 'universal', 'nature.While', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'sang', 'several', 'memorable', 'songs', 'first', 'two', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'Garland', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Life', 'Begins', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'actually', 'did', 'record', 'four', 'numbers', 'film', 'including', 'wonderful', 'version', 'Easy', 'Love', 'none', 'songs', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'best', 'though', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'taken', 'something', 'away', 'overall', 'darkness', 'very', 'serious', 'film', 'Growing', 'up', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'out', 'Thus', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'movies', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'valuable']",The Andy Hardy Collection - Life Begins for Andy Hardy VHS
275586,A11FSATHLT6E8P,6301964063,"""ehsmith4""","[11, 11]","Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) has just graduated from Carvel High School and begins to ponder his future after his sweetheart Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) leaves for the summer.  His father, Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone), would like to see Andy follow in his footsteps by attending Wainwright College &amp; law school, but Andy himself isn't so sure.Meanwhile, Andy's friend &amp; not-so-secret admirer Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) comes from New York City to pay a visit.  Andy decides to return with Betsy to her hometown &amp; spend a month away from his family to see if he can succeed in the Big Apple.Andy has visions of living the high life, but a strong, sharp dose of reality awaits him.  Andy eventually finds himself down to his last quarter, too proud even to accept Betsy Booth's help, and becomes the target of Jennitt Hicks (Patricia Dane), an &quot;older woman&quot; switchboard operator with a rather odious track record re relationships with men.This eleventh Hardy series entry, as judged by my previous description, is so very different from the other films in the series as it takes on a darker, downbeat, and sometimes cynical air more in line with serious drama than sentimental comedy.  Judy Garland made her third &amp; final series appearance in this film, and Betsy Booth's maturity, sophistication &amp; worldly-wise qualities contrast sharply with Judy's first appearance in &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot;.  Patricia Dane is also superb as the icy, calculating &quot;wolfess&quot; who tries to make Andy another of her conquests.The very adult subject matter, quite straightforward for its time, earned &quot;Life Begins for Andy Hardy&quot; an &quot;unobjectionble for adults&quot; rating from the Legion for Decency of the Catholic Church, meaning that the film was unsuitable for children.  Such a rating would be laughable by today's standards as the issues raised still ring true in many respects over 60 years later.Yes, Andy Hardy definitely becomes a man after his time in New York City in more ways than one.",4,&quot;Today I am a man.&quot;,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,2043,"['Andy', 'Hardy', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'just', 'graduated', 'Carvel', 'High', 'School', 'ponder', 'future', 'sweetheart', 'Polly', 'Benedict', 'Ann', 'Rutherford', 'summer', 'father', 'Judge', 'Hardy', 'Lewis', 'Stone', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Andy', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'attending', 'Wainwright', 'College', 'amp', 'law', 'school', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure.Meanwhile', 'Andy', 'friend', 'amp', 'not-so-secret', 'admirer', 'Betsy', 'Booth', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'pay', 'visit', 'Andy', 'return', 'Betsy', 'hometown', 'amp', 'spend', 'month', 'away', 'family', 'see', 'can', 'succeed', 'Big', 'Apple.Andy', 'visions', 'living', 'high', 'life', 'strong', 'sharp', 'dose', 'reality', 'Andy', 'eventually', 'down', 'last', 'quarter', 'too', 'proud', 'even', 'accept', 'Betsy', 'Booth', 'help', 'target', 'Jennitt', 'Hicks', 'Patricia', 'Dane', 'quot', 'older', 'woman', 'quot', 'operator', 'rather', 'odious', 'track', 'record', 'relationships', 'men.This', 'eleventh', 'Hardy', 'series', 'entry', 'judged', 'previous', 'description', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'darker', 'downbeat', 'sometimes', 'cynical', 'air', 'more', 'line', 'serious', 'drama', 'sentimental', 'comedy', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'made', 'third', 'amp', 'final', 'series', 'appearance', 'film', 'Betsy', 'Booth', 'maturity', 'sophistication', 'amp', 'worldly-wise', 'qualities', 'contrast', 'sharply', 'Judy', 'first', 'appearance', 'quot', 'Love', 'Finds', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'quot', 'Patricia', 'Dane', 'also', 'superb', 'icy', 'calculating', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'make', 'Andy', 'conquests.The', 'very', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'straightforward', 'time', 'earned', 'quot', 'Life', 'Begins', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'quot', 'quot', 'unobjectionble', 'adults', 'quot', 'rating', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'meaning', 'film', 'was', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'laughable', 'today', 'standards', 'issues', 'raised', 'still', 'ring', 'true', 'many', 'respects', '60', 'years', 'later.Yes', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'definitely', 'man', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'more', 'ways', 'one']",The Andy Hardy Collection - Life Begins for Andy Hardy VHS

275588,A1TNWBQVG7SINE,6301964063,James J. Varela,"[5, 5]","This installment of the Andy Hardy series proves yet again the utter genius of Louis B. Mayer. He said the Andy Hardy Series were the best films MGM made and he was right. This is my second favorite Andy Hardy film. Band leader Tommy Dorsey's wife Patricia Dane is the beautiful dame who Andy gets mixed up with. The best scene in the movie was her and Mickey Rooney dancing the CONGA. This movie was years ahead of it's time as a coming of age movie for young people in 1941. The scene where Andy Hardy's friend suddenly dies and Andy finds the body was  a shocking piece of melodrama for the Andy Hardy Series which tended to be light hearted stories that idealized American middle class values and life. Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy was one of the greatest actors of his generation and he is around the try give fatherly advice. It has been said the Andy Hardy series was the childhood L.B. Mayer always wanted, which is why he took such a personal interest in the development of the series.  This was the last Andy Hardy film for Judy Garland & Ann Rutherford and Judy is utterly lovely in it. Sad when watching this film to realize all the trouble that lay ahead for her. This film like all the Andy Hardy movies is seething with New Deal era political correctness.  The Andy Hardy movies were huge money makers for MGM in their day making Mickey Rooney the hottest young actor in Hollywood from 1937-1946. The Andy Hardy series give us all a rare look at what the teenage years of the WWII generation were like. The Andy Hardy movies were made over 60 + years ago but are still entertaining to watch.

Once there, he meets devious dames (Patricia Dane), hunger, and struggle face to face and learns that living alone isn't as fun as it seems.Another great addition to the Andy Hardy series, this film is a breeze to watch. Not only does it show that most of the series has been slightly unrealistic due to its small town setting, it enforces those family values that are a staple of the series.Rooney and Garland are wonderful here in their last Andy Hardy teaming. Rooney overtly emphasizes his brilliant personality, his true asset. Garland feeds off of his energy and re-creates a character so perfect and sweet and yet not good enough for the star.

275590,A1TB1WN8PUWWE3,6301964063,"Sara Brideson ""A Melancholy Idealist""","[1, 1]","This is one of the first Andy Hardy films I saw as a child, mainly because I knew Judy Garland co-starred in it. However, this film is of interest to everyone, even if they are not Judy fans. This installment in the series is much more grounded in reality than the other films. It is very aptly titled, as it does indeed show real life beginning for Andy. The film does not so much concern his boyish mishaps in love, but rather, focuses on his struggle for survival as he lives in NYC for one month to prove he is a man capable of supporting himself. He ends up hungry and broke until he lands a job as an office boy. There, he falls for a woman who tricks him into spending money on her. Another storyline, which is really the most unusual for an Andy Hardy film, is about a young man Andy sneaks into his room when he discovers the young man is homeless. The boy, played by tap dancer Ray McDonald, dies in Andy's apartment. Andy thinks it is suicide, but it is actually heart failure. This bleak subject was handled with empathy and care in the film, devoid of any moralistic preaching. I found the film relatable today, especially as it is more and more difficult for young people to get a start in the modern world. However, the difference between today and the time of Andy Hardy is that, today, not as many young people have families to fall back on or a moral conscience to guide them away from a seedy lifestyle. It is refreshing to watch a film that shows a world where human connections are the difference between falling into hopelessness and rising above a slump in one's life. I'd highly recommend this film, especially with the stellar performances by Judy Garland and Ray McDonald.
