Always amazed at the array of outstanding &#34;unknown&#34; character actors this series used.  You would see an actor and think what a terrific performer and read the credits and the name was no one you could remember.  Perhaps the secret behind the success.  Instead of being bogged down with big-name guest stars, the producers showed wisdom in choosing the perfect actors for the roles, however small.

1545597,APNFSO2RCZ2KD,B0083TUEDS,"Bloodrider ""Lover of epics""","[11, 12]","Of all the releases of old shows the consistency of quality prints remain with Gunsmoke.The only problem is the expensiveness of the dvd.Should be priced in mid thirties for a full season is a feeling most of us fans agree is fair since the show ran for twenty years. As a matter of further agreement the releases should be excelerated since most of us baby boomers who watched the show back then won't be around for the availabilty of the last season.If memory serves this is the last season of the concise story telling represented by the 30 minute episodes. The show went to an hour in length in the 1962 season and Big Jim was rewarded with his own production company to partner with the CBS network as a means of greater financial incentive to do an hour. People in their reviews have remarked about the great character development of the stars, which began in season one and made the show the success it became instantly. When the show became an hour the beer timeouts in the Long Branch, a source of great comic relief with Doc and Chester, and later outright hilarity with Doc and Festus, became more numerous and longer duration.Guest stars got more air time, extra secondary characters were introduced..and grabbed more air time...and besides slowing the pace of the show with outright filler, the ultimate consequence was less of MATT DILLON!What the Duke was to movie westerns was what Jim Arness was to television westerns....yet the show lasted another 13 seasons until 1975. The last six or seven thanks to Mrs. Paley who loved the show and was the wife of the chairman of CBS network. They moved it to Monday nights and it rose again phoenix-like to the top 20 list....the rest is tv legend and "" get out of Dodge "" became part of the English language and lore.Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series",5,consistently great,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,1827,"['releases', 'old', 'consistency', 'quality', 'prints', 'remain', 'Gunsmoke.The', 'only', 'problem', 'expensiveness', 'dvd.Should', 'be', 'priced', 'mid', 'thirties', 'full', 'season', 'feeling', 'most', 'fans', 'agree', 'fair', 'show', 'ran', 'twenty', 'years', 'matter', 'further', 'agreement', 'releases', 'should', 'be', 'excelerated', 'most', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'watched', 'show', 'back', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'around', 'availabilty', 'last', 'season.If', 'memory', 'serves', 'last', 'season', 'concise', 'story', 'telling', 'represented', '30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'show', 'went', 'hour', 'length', '1962', 'season', 'Big', 'Jim', 'was', 'rewarded', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'partner', 'CBS', 'network', 'means', 'greater', 'financial', 'incentive', 'do', 'hour', 'People', 'reviews', 'have', 'remarked', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'stars', 'began', 'season', 'one', 'made', 'show', 'success', 'became', 'instantly', 'When', 'show', 'became', 'hour', 'beer', 'timeouts', 'Long', 'Branch', 'source', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'Doc', 'Chester', 'later', 'outright', 'hilarity', 'Doc', 'Festus', 'became', 'more', 'numerous', 'longer', 'duration.Guest', 'stars', 'got', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'extra', 'secondary', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced..and', 'grabbed', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'slowing', 'pace', 'show', 'outright', 'filler', 'ultimate', 'consequence', 'was', 'less', 'MATT', 'DILLON', 'What', 'Duke', 'was', 'movie', 'westerns', 'was', 'what', 'Jim', 'Arness', 'was', 'television', 'westerns', 'show', 'lasted', '13', 'seasons', '1975', 'last', 'six', 'seven', 'thanks', 'Mrs.', 'Paley', 'who', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'wife', 'chairman', 'CBS', 'network', 'moved', 'Monday', 'nights', 'rose', 'again', 'phoenix-like', 'top', '20', 'list', '.the', 'rest', 'tv', 'legend', 'get', 'Dodge', 'became', 'part', 'English', 'language', 'lore.Bloodspiller', 'Book', 'One', 'Warriors', 'Palahia', 'Series']",Gunsmoke: Season 6 Vol. 1
