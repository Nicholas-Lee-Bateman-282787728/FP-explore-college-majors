Coogan's got Partridge's class position down pitch-perfect: Norwich wine bars, childhood vacations in Spain, two A-levels, a disdain for Oxbridge liberals, and an instinctive ""little Britain"" conservatism that's quite happy to grab all the goodies a burgeoning Europe offers. The show's funny, but I found myself less interested in the laughs than in the world Coogan builds around his character, so that you feel you know him much better than you should after six short shows. The skits are also clever in a low-key offbeat way, like the recurring segment where Alan Partridge interviews other people with the name of Alan Partridge. ""Knowing me Alan Partridge knowing you another Alan Partridge, A-ha!""The thing about Partridge, like Brent, is that as loathsome as you're supposed to find him, you end up kind of pulling for him. They're basically overgrown boys, not vicious so much as clueless, British lads baffled by a PC world. The historians of the future will have a field day working out why post-Thatcher Britain turned to characters like these, and why they play so funny over here.",5,"""Knowing Me Alan Partridge Knowing You Another Alan Partridge""",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,1272,"['Steve', 'Coogan', 'toothy', 'self-satisfied', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'David', 'Brent', 'serious', 'run', 'money', 'one', 'New', 'Britain', 'most', 'smarmy', 'upwardly-mobile', 'creations', 'Coogan', 'got', 'Partridge', 'class', 'position', 'pitch-perfect', 'Norwich', 'wine', 'bars', 'childhood', 'vacations', 'Spain', 'two', 'A-levels', 'disdain', 'Oxbridge', 'liberals', 'instinctive', 'little', 'Britain', 'conservatism', 'quite', 'happy', 'grab', 'goodies', 'burgeoning', 'Europe', 'offers', 'show', 'funny', 'found', 'less', 'interested', 'laughs', 'world', 'Coogan', 'character', 'feel', 'know', 'much', 'better', 'should', 'six', 'short', 'shows', 'skits', 'are', 'also', 'clever', 'low-key', 'offbeat', 'way', 'recurring', 'segment', 'where', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'other', 'people', 'name', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'Knowing', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'knowing', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'A-ha', 'thing', 'Partridge', 'Brent', 'as', 'loathsome', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'end', 'up', 'kind', 'pulling', ""'re"", 'basically', 'overgrown', 'boys', 'not', 'vicious', 'so', 'much', 'clueless', 'British', 'lads', 'baffled', 'PC', 'world', 'historians', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'working', 'out', 'why', 'post-Thatcher', 'Britain', 'turned', 'characters', 'why', 'play', 'so', 'funny', 'here']",N/A

911129,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0009RQRF6,Cubist,"[29, 30]","Before The Office made uncomfortable humour hip again, Knowing Me Knowing You was on British TV and quickly developed a cult following-enough to spawn several additional series and a one-off special. The show was created by talented comedian Steve Coogan for a BBC Radio 4 comedy show called On the Hour in 1993. This was successful enough to spawn Knowing Me in 1994 as Coogan and co-writer Armando Iannucci skewer British talk shows with its hopelessly inept host, Alan Partridge (Coogan). Like The Office's David Brent, Alan is a legend in his own mind. He's also an arrogant git who is useless at hosting a chat show.Most people know Steve Coogan from either 24 Hour Party People or Coffee and Cigarettes-or, heaven forbid, Around the World in 80 Days-but his claim to fame in England came from Knowing Me. He is perfect as the selfish, self-absorbed Alan. Unlike David Brent, there is little redeemable about Alan but Coogan does give him a shred of sympathy and maybe even pathos. Coogan looks the part with his shellacked helmet of hair and has all of the chat show host mannerisms down cold. Alan wants desperately to be a big time talk show host but is unable to get any celebrities to come on and is therefore doomed to the margins. He is hopelessly and terminally unhip but doesn't seem to ever realize this fact. In some respects Alan is Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy if Scorsese had decided to make a TV show spin-off.Some of the best moments of Knowing Me come when Alan loses his cool, like when Roger Moore fails to show up and the talk show host unleashes all of his frustrations on his guests after they complain and criticize him. Knowing Me is the kind of talk show we'd all like to see. In this day and age when talk shows are carefully scripted and staged, there is virtually no spontaneity anymore. And so, to see Alan insult and often lose control of his guests and, in the process, his show, is akin to driving by an accident: it is painful to watch but you can't look away.The first disc features audio commentaries for all six episodes with writer/producer Armando Iannucci, actress Rebecca Front, writer Patrick Marber, actor Steven Brown and a couple of the ""guests"" from that particular episode. These are fairly amusing tracks that spend a lot of time slamming Alan (and rightly so). In fact, every commentary begins with Alan not being able to join the other participants because of some embarrassing ailment.The second disc begins with ""Festivalan"" a.k.a. Know Me Knowing Yule made two years after the first season. Alan somehow survived the devastating last show of his first season for a Christmas special complete with ski lodge d&eacute;cor perfect for that faux-intimate feel that eventually degrades into a naked appeal on his part for a second season. Also included is an optional commentary by Iannucci, Marber, Front, Doon MacKichan, David Schneider and Steve Brown. There is lots of dry humour as they make fun of Alan once again.""Originalan"" features test footage shot for the pilot episode that was never aired and done for little money in order to see if the concept worked. This is the show in its infancy. Alan's hair looks even more artificial (if that's possible) with a glistening plastic sheen.""Ruralan"" features Alan rambling through the northern English countryside. He skips stones across a pond (and promptly loses his watch) while pontificating endlessly via voiceover.""Alan Aid"" sees Coogan reprise his character for three segments for the U.K. version of Comic Relief in 1995. As usual, Alan makes a mess of things and is even humiliated in one segment by some locals.Finally, there is ""Additionalan"" that includes nine promos for the show, a stills gallery and biographical sketches for the cast and crew with one for Alan that is quite funny.",5,King of Comedy: the TV series?,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,3811,"['Office', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'humour', 'hip', 'again', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'Knowing', 'was', 'British', 'TV', 'quickly', 'developed', 'cult', 'following-enough', 'spawn', 'several', 'additional', 'series', 'one-off', 'special', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'talented', 'comedian', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'BBC', 'Radio', '4', 'comedy', 'show', 'called', 'Hour', '1993', 'was', 'successful', 'enough', 'spawn', 'Knowing', 'Me', '1994', 'Coogan', 'co-writer', 'Armando', 'Iannucci', 'skewer', 'British', 'talk', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'host', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'Coogan', 'Office', 'David', 'Brent', 'Alan', 'legend', 'own', 'mind', 'also', 'arrogant', 'git', 'who', 'useless', 'hosting', 'chat', 'show.Most', 'people', 'know', 'Steve', 'Coogan', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'Coffee', 'Cigarettes-or', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'World', '80', 'Days-but', 'claim', 'fame', 'England', 'came', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'perfect', 'selfish', 'self-absorbed', 'Alan', 'David', 'Brent', 'little', 'redeemable', 'Alan', 'Coogan', 'give', 'shred', 'sympathy', 'maybe', 'even', 'pathos', 'Coogan', 'part', 'shellacked', 'helmet', 'hair', 'chat', 'show', 'host', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'cold', 'Alan', 'desperately', 'be', 'big', 'time', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'unable', 'get', 'celebrities', 'come', 'therefore', 'doomed', 'margins', 'hopelessly', 'terminally', 'unhip', ""n't"", 'seem', 'ever', 'realize', 'fact', 'respects', 'Alan', 'Rupert', 'Pupkin', 'King', 'Comedy', 'Scorsese', 'had', 'decided', 'make', 'TV', 'show', 'spin-off.Some', 'best', 'moments', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'come', 'when', 'Alan', 'cool', 'when', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'show', 'up', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'frustrations', 'guests', 'complain', 'criticize', 'Knowing', 'Me', 'kind', 'talk', 'show', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'talk', 'shows', 'are', 'carefully', 'scripted', 'staged', 'virtually', 'spontaneity', 'anymore', 'so', 'see', 'Alan', 'insult', 'often', 'lose', 'control', 'guests', 'process', 'show', 'akin', 'driving', 'accident', 'painful', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away.The', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'six', 'episodes', 'writer/producer', 'Armando', 'Iannucci', 'actress', 'Rebecca', 'Front', 'writer', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Brown', 'couple', 'guests', 'particular', 'episode', 'are', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'tracks', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'slamming', 'Alan', 'rightly', 'so', 'fact', 'commentary', 'Alan', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'join', 'other', 'participants', 'embarrassing', 'ailment.The', 'second', 'disc', 'Festivalan', 'a.k.a', 'Know', 'Me', 'Knowing', 'Yule', 'made', 'two', 'years', 'first', 'season', 'Alan', 'somehow', 'survived', 'devastating', 'last', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'Christmas', 'special', 'complete', 'ski', 'lodge', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'perfect', 'faux-intimate', 'feel', 'eventually', 'naked', 'appeal', 'part', 'second', 'season', 'Also', 'included', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Iannucci', 'Marber', 'Front', 'Doon', 'MacKichan', 'David', 'Schneider', 'Steve', 'Brown', 'lots', 'dry', 'humour', 'make', 'fun', 'Alan', 'once', 'again', 'Originalan', 'test', 'footage', 'shot', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'never', 'aired', 'done', 'little', 'money', 'order', 'see', 'concept', 'worked', 'show', 'infancy', 'Alan', 'hair', 'even', 'more', 'artificial', 'possible', 'glistening', 'plastic', 'sheen', 'Ruralan', 'Alan', 'rambling', 'northern', 'English', 'countryside', 'stones', 'pond', 'promptly', 'watch', 'pontificating', 'endlessly', 'voiceover', 'Alan', 'Aid', 'Coogan', 'reprise', 'character', 'three', 'segments', 'U.K.', 'version', 'Comic', 'Relief', '1995', 'usual', 'Alan', 'mess', 'things', 'even', 'humiliated', 'one', 'segment', 'locals.Finally', 'Additionalan', 'nine', 'promos', 'show', 'stills', 'gallery', 'biographical', 'sketches', 'cast', 'crew', 'one', 'Alan', 'quite', 'funny']",N/A

KMKY combines a wickedly hilarious script, superb comical acting and a knack for making the viewer feel silly, uncomfortable and ready to burst with spontaneous fits of laughter all at once.I watched one episode of this series on BBC America and instantly became hooked. Having watched several cheesy talk shows in my time it was refreshing to watch a character like Partridge successfully spoof the genre as a whole. Steve Coogan's portrayal of Partridge is performed with a whole-hearted dose of comical cheese, ignorance, stubborness and cluelessness. From his silly grin and 70's sportscaster wardrobe to his plastic like hairdo, Partridge epitomizes, again, the schmaltzy ""I think I'm larger than life"" attitude of all the Regis Philbins, Geraldo Riveras and Jerry Springers put together.Lots of great extras are included on this 2 DVD set, including a test pilot which is every bit as funny as the series itself and the KMKY Christmas Special.After KMKY ended the Alan Partridge character continued in a series of his own (which also airs on BBC America) called ""I'm Alan Partridge."" Hopefully the BBC will give that series a proper DVD release in North America as well so those of us across the pond can fully enjoy the genius of Coogan's comical mind.And on that bombshell......",5,"Little Scary Monster -- ""Grrrrrr""",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1511,"['Whenever', 'hear', 'word', 'A-HA', 'will', 'become', 'little', 'scary', 'monster', 'one', 'countless', 'classic', 'moments', 'hilarious', 'series', 'further', 'broadcasting', 'adventures', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'character', 'KMKY', 'wickedly', 'hilarious', 'script', 'superb', 'comical', 'acting', 'knack', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'silly', 'uncomfortable', 'ready', 'burst', 'spontaneous', 'fits', 'laughter', 'once.I', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'BBC', 'America', 'instantly', 'became', 'hooked', 'Having', 'watched', 'several', 'cheesy', 'talk', 'time', 'was', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'character', 'Partridge', 'successfully', 'spoof', 'genre', 'whole', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'portrayal', 'Partridge', 'performed', 'whole-hearted', 'dose', 'comical', 'cheese', 'ignorance', 'stubborness', 'cluelessness', 'silly', 'grin', '70', 'sportscaster', 'wardrobe', 'plastic', 'hairdo', 'Partridge', 'again', 'schmaltzy', 'think', ""'m"", 'larger', 'life', 'attitude', 'Regis', 'Philbins', 'Geraldo', 'Riveras', 'Jerry', 'Springers', 'put', 'together.Lots', 'great', 'extras', 'are', 'included', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'including', 'test', 'pilot', 'bit', 'as', 'funny', 'series', 'KMKY', 'Christmas', 'Special.After', 'KMKY', 'ended', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'character', 'continued', 'series', 'own', 'also', 'airs', 'BBC', 'America', 'called', ""'m"", 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'Hopefully', 'BBC', 'will', 'give', 'series', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'North', 'America', 'as', 'well', 'pond', 'can', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'genius', 'Coogan', 'comical', 'mind.And', 'bombshell']",N/A

Imagine combining the the characters of David Brent and Gareth together (from the original British version) and it'll give you some idea just how dreadful Alan Partridge is. Dreadful he may be but its very very funny. Partridge is mainly self-obsessed and hates being upstaged by his guests, even though in some cases he worships them (Roger Moore for example). Roger Moore of course never appears on the show.A particular favourite moment of mine is when Alan gives his three guests a chance to complain about the show, which inevitably has been a complete disaster.Alan: ""If you've got any criticisms I can deal with them""All three guests then complain vehmently for a minute or so.Alan: ""UP YOURS"" (sticking a single finger up at his guests)Subtlety is not Alan's strong point.This is endlessly watchable, with some very funny extras, which makes the DVD a great purchase.",5,Brilliant Comedy,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1390,"['original', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'show', 'as', 'good', 'Travel', 'Tavern', 'series', '13', 'years', 'later', 'as', 'funny', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'Never', 'chat', 'show', 'host', 'been', 'so', 'rude', 'humiliated', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'been', 'humiliated', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'history', 'television.If', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'later', 'series', 'managed', 'miss', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'completely', 'really', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'elements', 'make', 'Office', 'so', 'brilliant', 'Imagine', 'combining', 'characters', 'David', 'Brent', 'Gareth', 'together', 'original', 'British', 'version', ""'ll"", 'give', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'dreadful', 'Alan', 'Partridge', 'Dreadful', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'Partridge', 'mainly', 'self-obsessed', 'being', 'upstaged', 'guests', 'even', 'cases', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'example', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'course', 'never', 'show.A', 'particular', 'favourite', 'moment', 'mine', 'when', 'Alan', 'three', 'chance', 'complain', 'show', 'inevitably', 'been', 'complete', 'disaster.Alan', ""'ve"", 'got', 'criticisms', 'can', 'deal', 'three', 'guests', 'then', 'complain', 'vehmently', 'minute', 'so.Alan', 'YOURS', 'sticking', 'single', 'finger', 'up', 'guests', 'Subtlety', 'not', 'Alan', 'strong', 'point.This', 'endlessly', 'watchable', 'very', 'funny', 'extras', 'DVD', 'great', 'purchase']",N/A
