Otherwise, The Tree of Life is a pretentious and extremely feeble attempt to philosophize about everything from the creation of the universe to the interrelations in dysfunctional families, particularly the questionable and for the most part reprehensible treatment of children (even the ""radiant"" mother being a pathetic model).  One could learn more about these things by simply listening to the Mahler and Brahms works (and others)  offered as a sound palette to accompany the visual wonders.The film leaves more questions about its creator and the actors who lent themselves to the project than it does to real feeling and intellectual or emotional depth.  What was Malick looking for?  Why did he choose the particular storyline he did and how does it illustrate universal concerns?  Why are there benevolent dinosaurs? Are nature and grace really so easily explained as we are told? Are we to think that all families experience these same alienations?Where in the movie is there any real acting?  Who now are Pitt and Penn?

A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact.""But he's exactly wrong. There is no such thing as an epic, moving, or meaningful film that you would call ""clear"" or ""conventional."" They must rely on images that are intuitive and metaphoric and inexplicable.

Nonetheless, for those who thought the film is worth owning like me, I thought I would put some up to date information about its release on here.

1392835,AW85VDASDM8VU,B004A8ZX32,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","Life goes on.  People pass along.  Nothin' stays the same.Terrence Malick, at his best, is bewitching.  He casts a spell of deep calm.  This is true despite the opening suggestion for The Tree of Life (2011):  ""For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend that you play it loud.""  Loud I did play it and they were quite in the right.  It is a terrific accomplishment of sight and sound.  It ought to have come with another warning:  ""For optimal viewing, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend you see it big."" I have now seen all of Terrence Malick's movies and this is easily the most ambitious.  It's about life and death, the universe and our place in it, God and deep human emotion.  What else is there?  When you leave this movie, and this is mostly true of the other Malick movies, you walk out to the edge of a sharp cliff and you can see down, far below you lie all other movies.  They simply do not compete for ambition, maturity, thoughtfulness, and beauty.  It just feels like something completely different.This is the story of a family.  In what looks to be the late 60's, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) receives a telegram and finds out that one of her sons has been killed.  She and Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) are hit hard by the loss.  In the present day, Jack (Sean Penn) is working as an architect in Dallas.  He is preoccupied with his past and contemplates life.  The universe is born, galaxies formed, planets emerge, and on Earth life is created.  Jack is born, brief moments of his early life go by, then his brothers are born and, in their young teenage years, the bulk of the story is told.  Mr. O'Brien is tough on his sons R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan), but on the eldest son, Jack (Hunter McCracken), he is too tough.  All of his own failings and troubles he takes out on Jack in the thought that he's getting him ready for life as he knows it to be.  As Jack grows older, he has difficulty dealing with his thoughts and emotions about his father, his mother, pain, God, loss, plus all the ordinary things a young boy has to deal with.I think that the reason I never--but maybe once--thought about this movie being pretentious is that I basically ignore the voice overs.  They feel to me to be optional.  You can take a dip, listen in, but if you focus too hard, something else will pass you by.  That's what makes The Tree of Life such a great movie.  It's a beautiful film to watch (cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki) as it is to listen to its score (Alexandre Desplat) or soundtrack.  Let me underline that, the score and soundtrack is perfect.  The story is told as impressionistic.  You only get an impression from one shot, whether it's a tear on Jack's face or a piece of dialogue, which will only last a moment before it cuts to another shot that might be Jack coming home and Mrs. O'Brien responding to Jack's hugging or avoiding her.Cut cut cut cut cut which keeps the energy of the film driving forward, developing your sense of the story and character.  A movie is a rapid substitution of one picture for another, slightly different picture that gives the illusion of motion.  That's how The Tree of Life operates.  It's a delightful thing if you can watch it without conscious thought.  I understand there are many of you out there--the sort that likes to guess the outcomes of mysteries, for example--that just can't find the dimmer on their brain to passively enjoy a movie.  This is how I watch most movies.  I turn down the lights and let the movie impress upon me.  I suspect that this is why I enjoy The Tree of Life and To the Wonder (2013) (review) so much.  When I can't turn it off or a movie isn't immersive enough to force it off, then it's going to be tough for me to enjoy.The cosmic interlude, if you haven't seen the movie, may strike the cynical viewer--and I certainly sympathize--as pretention writ large.  Believe me when I tell you, it is astounding.  Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is supposed to have one redeeming quality in the beauty of his planetary waltz.  I'm having trouble finding words to describe how far it is surpassed by The Tree of Life.  Obviously, that movie is a technical marvel for the time--with roughly twice the budget of The Tree of Life when adjusted for inflation--but the imagination on display during Malick's sequence is unparalleled.  What makes it so great, and I think aloud here, is that it is still imbued with Malick's maturity and his eye, like he's capturing the moment without having planned it.  Just ""here it is.""I was all set to say ""Take that Stanley Kubrick!  And that Steven Spielberg!""  But what begins as a major ass kicking of Jurassic Park (1993) by Malick's dinosaurs captured in the wild droops just enough for a moment to give Spielberg the win.  The movement was too smooth, the steps weirdly on the wrong vertical plane.  It is the first of two errors.  The second comes at the end of the film with Chastain cupping and uncapping of her hands against the sun.  Both moments broke the spell.  Up until then, Malick was nowhere to be seen or felt other than in my super-conscience, to give credit to when I felt something awesome.  Then, comes a repetition of movement in such quick succession that looked so much like a ""cool thing to do"" that I was a bit annoyed.Otherwise the performances were very good.  Those boys were astoundingly good.  Tye Sheridan, you may not be aware, is the lead in Mud (2013) (review) where he was very good as well--obviously, he had a lot more dialogue in Mud.  Hunter McCracken is arguably the lead in this movie and he carries many scenes on his young shoulders.  The Tree of Life is something like a mid-point, dialogue-wise, between To the Wonder and a normal movie.  There are some scenes in The Tree of Life where you can hear full exchanges, but mostly it is impressionistic, non-explanatory voice-overs and never a full, conventionally constructed scene.  That makes it relatively difficult to judge performance levels.  Really, Sean Penn just lets his wrinkly face do his acting for him.  If, however, we accept the view that evoking a feeling is a sign of a good performance, then everyone did the best work of their lives.  Brad Pitt should possibly be given special special mention for, legitimately, giving the best performance of his career as a hard, frustrated, mostly unlikeable man.  I haven't seen Moneyball (2011) yet, but I find it hard to imagine that it was anything with as much depth or range as in this movie.The Tree of Life was up for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards in 2012.  For Best Picture I can imagine that The Artist (2011) hit more heartstrings and faux-nostalgia to make it voter friendly, but Best Director (Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist) and Best Cinematography ( Robert Richardson for Hugo (2011)) are comically wrong.  I would have liked to have seen Jessica Chastain rewarded somewhere, but I suppose a nomination for The Help (2011) is something--something like a backhanded compliment, possibly.  Perhaps it's hypocrisy to complain that voters didn't watch one of the top three movies of the year when I hadn't seen it until just now, but I imagine that The Tree of Life didn't receive more accolades than it did because people couldn't be bothered to watch a movie they thought would be too artsy.  It isn't hard, it too artsy, it's just good, accessible modern art.Read more at ProfRatigan.Wordpress.com",5,Malick's Most Ambitious Film - Prof. Ratigan,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,7505,"['Life',

This is unlike any big budget film I have seen in the past from the characters and how the story line progresses. The whole of the movie is very deep but slow and could easily frustrate one that isn't into movies that are very slow. As I have watched movies before that have a slower passed feel to it and more serious, for me this is fine. Sometimes, I just want a movie where I am slowly drawn in.The storyline to me is like a book you read it moves slowly, but as you get future into the story you find yourself really enjoying what you are reading.

1392839,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004A8ZX32,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","Terrence Malick is one of those directors who divides audiences.  His films are so entrenched in who he is as a visionary that one cannot separate art from artist and thus his works all seem to carry a common bond that either draws us to them or repels us.  I have a typically fond relationship with Malick.  I find him fascinating, even when I find his film's bordering on self-indulgent.  He knows what he wants to say and he will stop at nothing to convey his message.  While I cannot say that I thoroughly enjoy all of his features, I can say that he is a director I respect immensely.For me, `The Tree of Life' is one of those instances where Malick's own vision got in the way of his storytelling.  He has such an important point to make regarding life affirmations, spirituality and the languishing effects of loss, but elements of this film take us out of that vision and strip away some of the effect.This is probably the most complex and captivating film of 2011, but its flaws (for me) pull it back from being one of the best.In broken fragments, Malick tells us the story of the O'Brien family.  It also tells the story of the birth of life here on earth.  In effect, it is telling the same story yet in alternating realities.  In the 50's, the O'Brien household is fractured by conflicting parental approaches.  Mrs. O'Brien is a loving and nurturing caretaker, while Mr. O'Brien is harsh, rigid and unapproachable.  As their three sons grow up, they are molded by the relationships formed with their parents.  In adulthood, it is obvious that their eldest son Jack is still haunted by his unhealthy relationship with his father.  Death weighs down on the family at one point, which is addressed on the film's outset and yet not wholly developed until later.The problem I have with `The Tree of Life' is the way in which the film is constructed.  You have three alternating storylines (the O'Brien family, the birth of life and Jack's adulthood) and they don't ever seem to mesh in a way that completes this story.  They feel too solitary, causing riffs in the way in which the film impacts the audience.  When sewn together or reflected on as a whole they can serve as powerful companion pieces, but in viewing they never truly feel connected or cohesive.  The way they weave in and out of one another feels almost lazy and reckless.  The segments regarding adult Jack serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever because they are so skeletal in development that they completely unearth the film and divert it.  Sure, they are beautifully shot and add some texture to the film's already stunning cinematography, but emotionally they add nothing.  The story of the birth of life is stunning to witness.  It is some of the most beautifully imagery and emotional clarity put to celluloid in recent memory, and yet their abrupt arrival feels a tad forced.  I wanted an organic segue and yet I was left wondering why Malick chose that particular spot for this spiritual departure.Pitt, Chastain and McCracken are all outstanding here.  Their performances should have all been up for Oscars, they are that organic and beautifully composed.As a whole, I really liked this film and I have a feeling that time could be kind to this and cause me to love it.  It is a film that certainly says more the more you debate it, but it doesn't necessarily say all that much while you watch it.  Like I said, Malick is a masterful filmmaker.  He has etched out some serious masterpieces in his time.  At times though, he can let his imaginations get the better of him and his vision becomes cloudy in his own hands.  `The Tree of Life' feels a tad cloudy, despite having a very rich story to tell.",4,`Life' is a big undertaking...,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,3686,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'divides', 'audiences', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'entrenched', 'who', 'visionary', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'separate', 'art', 'artist', 'thus', 'works', 'seem', 'carry', 'common', 'bond', 'repels', 'have', 'typically', 'fond', 'relationship', 'Malick', 'find', 'fascinating', 'even', 'when', 'find', 'film', 'bordering', 'self-indulgent', 'what', 'say', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'convey', 'message', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'features', 'can', 'say', 'director', 'respect', 'Tree', 'Life', 'one', 'instances', 'where', 'Malick', 'own', 'vision', 'got', 'way', 'storytelling', 'important', 'point', 'make', 'regarding', 'life', 'affirmations', 'spirituality', 'languishing', 'effects', 'loss', 'elements', 'film', 'take', 'vision', 'strip', 'away', 'effect.This', 'probably', 'most', 'complex', 'captivating', 'film', '2011', 'flaws', 'back', 'being', 'one', 'best.In', 'broken', 'fragments', 'Malick', 'story', ""O'Brien"", 'family', 'also', 'story', 'birth', 'life', 'here', 'earth', 'effect', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'yet', 'alternating', 'realities', '50', ""O'Brien"", 'household', 'fractured', 'conflicting', 'parental', 'approaches', 'Mrs.', ""O'Brien"", 'loving', 'nurturing', 'caretaker', 'Mr.', ""O'Brien"", 'harsh', 'rigid', 'unapproachable', 'three', 'sons', 'grow', 'up', 'are', 'molded', 'relationships', 'formed', 'parents', 'adulthood', 'obvious', 'eldest', 'son', 'Jack', 'still', 'haunted', 'unhealthy', 'relationship', 'father', 'Death', 'down', 'family', 'one', 'point', 'addressed', 'film', 'outset', 'yet', 'not', 'wholly', 'developed', 'later.The', 'problem', 'have', 'Tree', 'Life', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'have', 'three', 'alternating', 'storylines', ""O'Brien"", 'family', 'birth', 'life', 'Jack', 'adulthood', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seem', 'mesh', 'way', 'story', 'feel', 'too', 'solitary', 'causing', 'riffs', 'way', 'film', 'audience', 'When', 'sewn', 'together', 'reflected', 'whole', 'can', 'serve', 'powerful', 'companion', 'pieces', 'viewing', 'never', 'truly', 'feel', 'connected', 'cohesive', 'way', 'weave', 'one', 'almost', 'lazy', 'reckless', 'segments', 'regarding', 'adult', 'Jack', 'serve', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'are', 'so', 'skeletal', 'development', 'completely', 'unearth', 'film', 'divert', 'Sure', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'add', 'texture', 'film', 'already', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'emotionally', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'birth', 'life', 'stunning', 'witness', 'most', 'beautifully', 'imagery', 'emotional', 'clarity', 'put', 'celluloid', 'recent', 'memory', 'yet', 'abrupt', 'arrival', 'tad', 'forced', 'wanted', 'organic', 'segue', 'yet', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'Malick', 'chose', 'particular', 'spot', 'spiritual', 'departure.Pitt', 'Chastain', 'McCracken', 'are', 'outstanding', 'here', 'performances', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscars', 'are', 'organic', 'beautifully', 'composed.As', 'whole', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'have', 'feeling', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'kind', 'cause', 'love', 'film', 'certainly', 'more', 'more', 'debate', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'say', 'that', 'much', 'watch', 'said', 'Malick', 'masterful', 'filmmaker', 'etched', 'out', 'serious', 'masterpieces', 'time', 'times', 'though', 'can', 'let', 'imaginations', 'get', 'better', 'vision', 'cloudy', 'own', 'hands', 'Tree', 'Life', 'feels', 'tad', 'cloudy', 'having', 'very', 'rich', 'story', 'tell']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

1392841,A1WIZDOPCT0CX9,B004A8ZX32,Austin,"[42, 51]","Excerpt from my review/blog located over  at ART OF THE STORY .COMI was expecting to love Melancholia and hate Tree of Life.Hate? Isn't that harsh?I've only seen one other Mallick film, and that was The New World. I have a policy of watching every film that has positive reviews to the end no matter what... After enduring through The New World I started to rethink my policy.The whole film is one long montage. I felt detached and indifferent to all the characters. Looking at the IMBD forums, I found that it's actually the style of Mallick. So I decided not to give his other films a chance but Tree of Life won the Palme d'Or so I was screwed. I was going to have to watch this film one way or another.Is it like Mallick's other films? With non-linear stories and montage after montage?It is exactly that.When Tree of Life was in wide release, several theaters put up warnings about the film's uncanny structure... Encouraging anyone to have an open mind going into the film and that refunds will not be given after 20 minutes.I hated The New World, but I was absolutely blown away by Tree of Life.... 6 years is a long time to produce a film and Mallick clearly didn't waste a second. Word on the street is that there's a new director's cut coming out that is 8 hours long.What's the story of Tree of Life?Not much of a story here.... the power of the film is how nostalgic it makes you. I have nothing in common with a childhood in Texas 1950 but Mallick managed to paint a beautiful portrait of all the dumb stuff we did as children but not just stuff but our limited view on the world and the process of losing innocence.Will I like this film?Depends.It's been a long time since I've seen such polarizing responses to a film. People either HATE it or LOVE it... That's what happens when you try to rewrite the cinematic language.Normal films have scenes leading into scenes but Mallick chooses to show us a mosaic of beauty. Stuff just happens. There's a extended sequence in the middle of the film that has nothing to do with the story but does parallel the themes in several ways. It can be really jarring, just let go and relax. Make your judgement at the end of the film because you won't get anything like Tree of Life for a long time.Like poetry, it doesn't limit itself to the constrains of heavy exposition like novels. Poetry doesn't always make sense and it depends heavily on the individual experiences of the reader. It's the same case here, the film seems like a jumbled mess of scenes from his childhood and even the creation of the cosmos but the fact remains: there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.Not just gorgeous in the shallow sense of external beauty but beautiful in the living miracle of life... Seeing the childhood of our shy protagonist through Mallick's lens felt magical because this is a man who's constantly fascinated by the smallest nuances of life. The mammoth film tries to cover the entire scope of the human experience and it does a damn good job of it too.I think that any serious cinephile should experience this film, even if just for the originally of its cinematic language.Tree of Life is poetry.

1392842,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B004A8ZX32,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[8, 13]","The Tree of Life is a film that can only be enjoyed by those who are in tune with their spiritual side and may not be appreciated by many people. This is the type of film that carries a different meaning for each individual and it has an emotional focus. The story begins with a typical American family in the 1950's living in Waco, Texas. A stay at home mother (Jessica Chastain), a hard working father and their three sons. A family who seems to have it all, until the death of their oldest son changes everything. But not completely for the worst, as it is only after his sons death that his father truly appreciates his son for who he is, as if his awareness has awakened and he now sees the unique and beautiful soul his son possesses. The father (Brad Pitt) is a tough dad who doesn't show much affection to his sons and seems disconnected, except when he is giving them orders.. He seems to have a preference for his second born who resembles him in mannerisms and looks. While his oldest son struggles to relate to his father but just cannot break through, which causes him many feelings of emptiness. The film breaks away from the plot and shows a fascinating look at life through unique cinematography that begins with the formation of the planets and the universe then takes you through the beauty of the ocean, the fury of mother earth through the eruption of a volcano and then ending with the birth of the oldest son who died at the start of the film. The movie then picks up again with the family and continues from there. I understood the movie completely and knew exactly what was going on throughout the whole film. My husband who is not a very spiritually connected person was very disappointed and lost interest quickly. He could not connect the spiritual aspects of this film with what was happening with the family. I feel due to his disinterest I missed a lot of what happened in the film and would like to watch it again alone. Just like the work of an artist, which I find Terrence Malick to be, I believe not everyone that may view a work of art can truly see the beauty or grasp the meaning of what the artist is conveying with each piece which speaks specifically to each individual, as does The Tree of Life.",5,A unique film which shifts all barriers and borders and transcends into a spiritual connection,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,2237,"['Tree', 'Life', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'are', 'tune', 'spiritual', 'side', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'many', 'people', 'type', 'film', 'different', 'meaning', 'individual', 'emotional', 'focus', 'story', 'typical', 'American', 'family', '1950', 'living', 'Waco', 'Texas', 'stay', 'home', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'hard', 'working', 'father', 'three', 'sons', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'death', 'oldest', 'son', 'changes', 'everything', 'not', 'completely', 'worst', 'only', 'sons', 'death', 'father', 'truly', 'son', 'who', 'awareness', 'awakened', 'now', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'soul', 'son', 'possesses', 'father', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'tough', 'dad', 'who', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'affection', 'sons', 'disconnected', 'when', 'giving', 'have', 'preference', 'second', 'born', 'who', 'mannerisms', 'oldest', 'son', 'relate', 'father', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'many', 'feelings', 'emptiness', 'film', 'away', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'look', 'life', 'unique', 'cinematography', 'formation', 'planets', 'universe', 'then', 'beauty', 'ocean', 'fury', 'mother', 'earth', 'eruption', 'volcano', 'then', 'ending', 'birth', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'start', 'film', 'movie', 'then', 'up', 'again', 'family', 'there', 'understood', 'movie', 'completely', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'whole', 'film', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'very', 'spiritually', 'connected', 'person', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'lost', 'interest', 'quickly', 'could', 'not', 'connect', 'spiritual', 'aspects', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'family', 'feel', 'due', 'disinterest', 'missed', 'lot', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'watch', 'again', 'alone', 'Just', 'work', 'artist', 'find', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'be', 'believe', 'not', 'everyone', 'may', 'view', 'work', 'art', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'beauty', 'grasp', 'meaning', 'what', 'artist', 'conveying', 'piece', 'specifically', 'individual', 'Tree', 'Life']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

That's fine with me, I don't mind if you hit that this review isn't helpful, because I strongly believe this is a masterpiece of American cinema. ""The Tree of Life"" is a story about how one family survives through grief and setbacks, told from the perspective of the eldest son. The film's cinematography is its greatest asset, the shots are like moving paintings and it's hard to turn away from the screen for fear you would miss one frame of this beautiful work. I recommend the film to people who want to see movies that are more artistic, and have a theme and message, rather than manufactured Hollywood formula. Nothing about this movie is formula. It's got a deep, resonating message that's worth the time and investment.Another great thing about this movie are the performances by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. Both of them give convincing portrayals of the parents in the family.

1392845,A1Z98R6UK5T00L,B004A8ZX32,Ben.W,"[7, 9]","Terrence Malick crafts another stunning masterpiece in `The Tree of Life', a film that follows the journey of a boy growing up with a strict father and loving mother and finds himself conflicted between the two.If you've seen `The Thin Red Line', then you'll probably be familiar with Malick's shooting style. It's a very artsy movie, with lots of lingering shots of people staring into nowhere, hand-held abstract close-ups, voice-overs asking philosophical questions over shots of space and opera scores, it's beautifully filmed and very close and intimate with the actors and the way everything relates back to the conflict of nature and grace, the sort of overall theme in this movie, makes it a really powerful movie to sit through.Acting is tops, but with this cast, how can you expect anything less? Brad Pitt was brilliant as the authoritarian father and a contrast to Jessica Chastain's affectionate mother, who absolutely shines in the role. Hunter McCracken almost steals the movie as the emotionally conflicted Jack O'Brien.With it's slower pace and contemplative tone, this is a movie that needs a chance to grow on you. It's really not the type of movie where you go in and expect the usual structure of a movie. You have to keep an open-mind and let it take you on its' ride and it becomes an engaging and thought-provoking experience, especially after the credits roll and you begin to mull things over.The disc includes `Exploring The Tree of Life', a quite interesting thirty minute documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, sans Terrence Malick of course, about the making of the film and a lot about working with Malick's open shooting style, Christopher Nolan and David Fincher are in it expressing their admiration for Malick's work.",5,"A surreal experience, beautiful and thought provoking....",1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1765,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'stunning', 'masterpiece', 'Tree', 'Life', 'film', 'journey', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'strict', 'father', 'loving', 'mother', 'conflicted', 'two.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'familiar', 'Malick', 'shooting', 'style', 'very', 'artsy', 'movie', 'lots', 'lingering', 'shots', 'people', 'staring', 'nowhere', 'hand-held', 'abstract', 'close-ups', 'voice-overs', 'asking', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'shots', 'space', 'opera', 'scores', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'very', 'close', 'intimate', 'actors', 'way', 'everything', 'back', 'conflict', 'nature', 'grace', 'sort', 'overall', 'theme', 'movie', 'really', 'powerful', 'movie', 'sit', 'through.Acting', 'tops', 'cast', 'how', 'can', 'expect', 'anything', 'less', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'brilliant', 'authoritarian', 'father', 'contrast', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'affectionate', 'mother', 'who', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Hunter', 'McCracken', 'almost', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'Jack', ""O'Brien.With"", 'slower', 'pace', 'contemplative', 'tone', 'movie', 'chance', 'grow', 'really', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'where', 'go', 'expect', 'usual', 'structure', 'movie', 'have', 'keep', 'open-mind', 'let', 'take', 'ride', 'engaging', 'thought-provoking', 'experience', 'especially', 'credits', 'roll', 'begin', 'mull', 'things', 'over.The', 'disc', 'Exploring', 'Tree', 'Life', 'quite', 'interesting', 'thirty', 'minute', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'course', 'making', 'film', 'lot', 'working', 'Malick', 'open', 'shooting', 'style', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'David', 'Fincher', 'are', 'expressing', 'admiration', 'Malick', 'work']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

1392848,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004A8ZX32,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[3, 7]","MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)One of the most mysterious and interesting auteur filmmakers out there right now is director Terrence Malick. No one else seems to inspire as many rumors, stories and myths about what they are up to as Malick. When will we see a new film from him? What will the film be about? What's the title of the film? Malick's movies tend to languish in the news for years simply titled as ""Untitled Terrence Malick Film"". But 2011 saw the birth, both literally and figuratively, of a brand new Malick movie: The Tree Of Life (2011). This is only Malick's fifth film in a career spanning over 40 years. But his five films are iconic pieces of filmmaking art. I've seen them all and I highly recommend you see each and every one to really understand any one of them. They cling together with a web of subliminal meaning that has taken me years to contemplate. My favorite, hands down, is The Thin Red Line (1998), the most masterful look at war, and man for that matter, ever made. It's one of my Top 10 movies of all time. It took me years and repeated viewings to fully appreciate it.Like all of Malick's films, upon first viewing The Tree Of Life (in the theater a year ago), I was confronted with reconciling my very high expectations for the film with the actual film that Malick delivered. It's taken a year of simmering inside me to really figure out how I feel about it. And after viewing it in its entirety for a 2nd time on blu-ray recently, I feel ready to discuss the film and my thoughts and feelings about it. While The Tree Of Life still makes me question its meaning and intentions, I appreciate it a little more than during my first time. It's a movie that makes it hard for me to love because it goes way outside the box of normal narrative storytelling. I love strong dialogue driven movies. And The Tree Of Life is not that kind of movie. In fact, this movie probably has less dialogue than any other feature length movie I love. But the subtext in the visuals, music, and feel of the film really got into me during this second viewing because my expectations of wanting dialogue and narrative were gone. Instead of constantly waiting for the movie to give me what I want, like I did the first time, I accepted it for what it is and got something else. Looking back on all 5 of Malick's movies now, I can see that they all do the same thing. None of them delivered what I wanted or expected from them the first time I saw them. But after letting that go, I was able to appreciate them on subsequent viewings. My initial rating for The Tree Of Life was 3.5 stars but I've since updated it to 4 stars.I'm not going to try to provide a narrative summary or character descriptions for this film since it really means nothing to understanding this film. Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn and the three young boys (Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, and Tye Sheridan) who play Pitt and Chastain's sons are all fantastic in their performances. They are not showy performances with scene-chewing speeches, but they are powerfully quiet and subtle performances rooted in deep character development. It's so clear that they all lived in the shoes of their characters during production on this movie. Malick's style of shooting demands that anyways from what I understand. I think Malick really nailed the casting on this film. Pitt and Chastain couldn't be more different yet complimentary in their roles as universal representations of ""nature"" and ""grace"". They just work together in this story. I actually think the 3 boys did the most with their roles. Their very naturalistic performances really brought my own childhood memories and feelings to life through their eyes.As with every Malick film, the production design, cinematography, sound, music, and editing are simply the best. I don't know what else to say. There's no room for improvement in any of those areas and the craftsmanship on this movie is really beyond perfection, even though I know that's not possible. But that's the experience I get. It really is astounding to see Malick and his incredible team provide such a meticulous and beautiful film. It has a natural and organic feel to it, yet I know that every single frame of the film and second of sound has been masterfully thought about by someone. Somehow Malick's style of filmmaking follows all the rules and breaks all the rules at the same time. When it comes to pure technical filmmaking craft, I give The Tree Of Life 5 stars out of 5. It's only the story and the writing (assuming there was much), that knocks this film down a start for me. But it wouldn't surprise me that if the ""secrets"" of this movie are revealed to me down the road, that I upgrade my score.While I could go on and on talking about the details of this movie, I think it's best to let it speak for itself beyond what I've had to say so far. The ideas, lessons, questions, and queries that I think it poses can't really be talked about. I believe one has to internalize them like all philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. They're are no real answers in my mind from The Tree Of Life to the questions it asks. It's the questions that are the meat of it's meal.",4,Malick's Masterpiece on Life,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,5195,"['MOVIE', 'RATING', '4', 'stars', 'B+', 'One', 'most', 'mysterious',

1392849,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B004A8ZX32,Blago Jones,"[2, 3]","Pros: Okay, I'm about to pitch the perfect movie to you. Seriously, there's no way you can screw up this pitch. Are you ready? Here it is: Brad Pitt and Dinosaurs. But not in the same scene. That would be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. No, Mr. Pitt and these dinosaurs exist millions of years apart from each other, but they're still in the same movie. The cohesiveness of the plot thread that binds them is up to you. No matter what you come up with, I'm quite confident that you will make a winner for me.The marketing for this film was spot on. A potential viewer could watch the trailer 100 times on loop and have the same knowledge of what happened as someone who actually saw the movie. Another potential viewer could just stare at the movie poster for two and a half hours and understand as much of the plot as I do. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. But I stress the word slight. Like, to the extreme. There's really very little embellishment there. I could talk about this movie, at length, around someone who's never seen it, and I wouldn't have to worry about ruining it for them.Accordingly, it really is satisfying to be able to say that I've seen it, and then talk about it in pretty much any manner I feel like. It's like I now share a special connection with the two people I watched it with, because we've all experienced something that makes very little sense. In the future, I'm confident I'll be able to make a reference to one of them that won't make any more sense to any of us than it does to anyone else, but it'll still get that knowing look in return. Maybe a smile, but more likely a scowl. Either way, it'll be special. And confusing.Did I mention there are dinosaurs?In all seriousness, Brad Pitt really must have eaten his Wheaties this year, because he does another very good job here. Portraying the great American patriarch, he sheds his generally off-color personality and goes the straight and narrow as a complex character torn between his dreams and his responsibilities. He simultaneously gives us a father figure with whom we can identify and struggle. While he's nominated for his work in Moneyball, this performance is probably more deserving of recognition, so I will gladly give that recognition here. (You're welcome, Mr. Pitt.)Cons: Is it possible for a movie to have so many non sequiturs that the plot itself becomes a non sequitur? Because I think that's what happened here. The thematic elements of the movie are constant, but the plot almost seems like an afterthought. What I said above about the trailer and poster giving as much clarity of vision as the movie itself was said with a completely straight face. The style of the movie is just one of images and impressions. Many of the images are actually quite evocative... In moderation. When they make up the bulk of the film, it becomes a bit much.I was tempted here to just start listing off some of the (many) random images shown throughout the movie (really, they're ubiquitous), but then I decided that I didn't want you to hate my blog as much as a lot of people hate this movie.I've mentioned previously how I feel about movies that lack dialog. The thing is, while it makes sense in a silent film, it makes very little sense in a movie that has dialog. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, that didn't make any sense what you said just now."" Welcome to The Tree of Life. Catching a theme? The point is that, yes, there is talking, which is an excellent device for advancing any plot. The problem is that the dialog in this particular movie tends to take what plot was there and tear it up and put a match to it. Most lines evoke a thought from the viewer like, ""Wait, why the hell did he say that?"" and, ""... What does that even mean?"" and, even less eloquent, ""Huh?"" And then most lines in the movie are, well, absent. I think there's a stretch of a solid half hour (although it feels like it's closer to an hour) at one point where no one says anything (because, as we all know, dinosaurs can't talk).Overall: While I was watching the movie, if there wasn't either Brad Pitt or a dinosaur on the screen (which was about eighty percent of the movie), I was doing some combination of furrowing my brow, scratching my head, looking at the clock, and wondering when my roommate Jeff was going to say something really angry and biting. It was definitely a restless movie watching experience. Constant mental fidgeting, trying to figure out which way was up. The funny thing is that, in hindsight, I kind of appreciate it for what it was, which is a fairly spot on impressionist representation of growing up (with daddy issues), all the while questioning existence. It is a thoroughly introspective work that (either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective) doesn't really offer any answers. Just questions. I can dig it. But then I remember the extremely painful experience of actually watching the movie, and I give it a 5 out of 10 while I hope that I never have to sit through it again.",3,More Fun To Think/Talk About

1392850,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B004A8ZX32,B. Martin,"[0, 2]","What exactly is one to make of Terrence Malick's wildly creative, deeply personal and ultimately perplexing latest film?  Different reviews of the film have likened it to everything from a poem to a symphony to a prayer.  Each description is fitting, but what is most remarkable about The Tree of Life is that it is at once all of these things and none of them at the same time.  Malick's first film since ""The New World"" is truly an enigma that is not for everyone.  Some will find it deep and philisophical while others will find it unfocused and pretentious.  Yet others will find and immense sense of peace and beauty.  In a way, the film is ultimately a metaphor for life as it will be interpreted and experienced differently by each perso who views it.  That may be its greatest asset.The majority of the film focuses on Jack, a young boy growing up in the midwest in the mid 50's.  The film follows him and studies his relationships with his brothers and his mother and father (Brad Pitt), who both love him but have different parenting approaches.  His mother instills the virtues of love in him while his father raises him to watch out for his own interests and not trust anyone but himself.  Malick directs theses scenes with little dialouge or exposition, but he manages to suck you in to the story anyway thanks to his masterful command of tone and pacing.  During these lyrical passages of the film, Malick ponders themes as diverse as family, life, death, love, God and the very creation of the universe.It can all be pretentious and the nonlinear structure of the film will be quite frustrating to those who are accustomed to more conventional storytelling, but there is no denying the majestic beauty of a film that tangles with big ideas in an uncompromising manner.",4,The Meaning of Life?,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1783,"['What', 'exactly', 'one', 'make', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'wildly', 'creative', 'deeply', 'personal', 'ultimately', 'perplexing', 'latest', 'film', 'Different', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'likened', 'everything', 'poem', 'symphony', 'prayer', 'description', 'fitting', 'what', 'most', 'remarkable', 'Tree', 'Life', 'once', 'things', 'none', 'same', 'time', 'Malick', 'first', 'film', 'New', 'World', 'truly', 'enigma', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'deep', 'philisophical', 'while', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'unfocused', 'pretentious', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'immense', 'sense', 'peace', 'beauty', 'way', 'film', 'ultimately', 'metaphor', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'interpreted', 'experienced', 'differently', 'perso', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'asset.The', 'majority', 'film', 'Jack', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'midwest', 'mid', '50', 'film', 'studies', 'relationships', 'brothers', 'mother', 'father', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'love', 'have', 'different', 'parenting', 'approaches', 'mother', 'virtues', 'love', 'father', 'watch', 'out', 'own', 'interests', 'not', 'trust', 'anyone', 'Malick', 'theses', 'scenes', 'little', 'dialouge', 'exposition', 'suck', 'story', 'anyway', 'thanks', 'masterful', 'command', 'tone', 'pacing', 'lyrical', 'passages', 'film', 'Malick', 'themes', 'as', 'diverse', 'family', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'God', 'very', 'creation', 'universe.It', 'can', 'be', 'pretentious', 'nonlinear', 'structure', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'frustrating', 'who', 'are', 'accustomed', 'more', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'denying', 'majestic', 'beauty', 'film', 'big', 'ideas', 'uncompromising', 'manner']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]
1392851,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B004A8ZX32,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[6, 11]","I stand confidently in the ""I loved it"" side of the room on ""The Tree of Life.""The cinematography by Emmanual Lubezski is spectacular.  I'll agree with someone else who commented that you could hit pause at any moment in ""The Tree of Life"" and you'd have an image worthy of framing.  But I loved the movement of the camera which seemed to go from one extraordinary angle to another throughout nearly every scene.  There was more than one love affair going on in this film.  Perhaps the cinematographers love of morning light was one of the most powerful.Jessica Chastain was magnificent.  This film gives the viewer every opportunity to relate to one or more of the characters for whatever reasons appeal to them an a personal, emotional basis.  I related to the young man and his struggles with identity.  But if I shed a tear at the end, it was because of how badly I miss my own mother, who for me, was so gracefully portrayed by Ms. Chastain.  Chastain's performance is the reason this movie reached my heart, and why I was so willing to embrace all its fundamental ambiguity with curiosity and enthusiasm.In the movie, Jessica Chastain's performance was challenged by the relative lack of audio recording. So many of the scenes were filmed in a way where the ephemeral methods employed by the director and cinematographer meant that there would be no dialogue.  It seemed to me in these scenes Ms. Chastain was the most brilliant.I might have changed the balance a little bit - less dinosaur, astrophysics and young male acting out, with a little bit more development of the other two brothers, of Mom's reality, and of the older brother (Penn) later in his life.  However, given that the story has its roots in the biblical story of Job, I thought it was somewhat clever (smile) that the screenplay has so much ""pre-"" historic scenes that were decidedly un-creationist!  Perhaps in exchange for some dinosaur action, in keeping with the grace of this film, more footage of ancient rainforest (rain), savannah (wind), or desert (heat) would have been nice to reinforce the ""grace"" of ""nature."" Anyway, I wonder if the evolutionary implications of some of the prehistoric scenes is why so many people, many who have never written reviews before, have logged into Amazon to write as many one or two sentence one star reviews as possible, and/or do as much damage as possible to the positive reviews for ""The Tree of Life.""  Were they offended on a religious level?  Was the mysterious crystalline light in the background of some of the dark screens not enough divine symbolism?We are our memories.  My perfect genetic clone is not me because he has none of my memories.  I completely enjoyed the way Malick portrayal memory in ""The Tree of Life.""  Short clips.  Varying amounts of sound.  Unconventional perspectives.  Varying speed.  All kinds of light - in this movie light is used like an artists tool, whether it is brilliant morning light, fire, candles, interior filtered light, etc. Many of the scenes have no sound.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the preparations for shooting for the all the individual scenes.Right now I am thinking about Mrs. O'Brien with her son at a river.  They have their backs to us and there is a light evening breeze.  They are sheltering something with a bright fire light in their hands.  There are extraordinary moments in my life that I recall like this.  Others have criticized Malick's art.  I totally embrace it and look forward to tracking down more of it.I have one question I would ask Mr Malick if I could: it seems so many of the artists who contributed to this film (actors, camera, scenery, animation and special effects included) contributed their art in a way that was entirely consistent with the overall theme and character of the movie.  I wonder how much of this is Malick's heavy directing hand, and how much of this was the artists who embraced the theme free to explore their art under the general light touch of Malick.  In any event, the collection of artists added so much to the overall richness of the end product.  A wonderful example of this is the music by Alexandre Desplat. I am a great fan of rich, emotional and melancholy music that is powerful yet does not force the listener toward a specific conclusion because of its modest ambiguity.Taken as a whole, ""The Tree of Life"" stands out for me as a very important and worthy film because of its entirely unconventional and effective approach to the visual art of story telling.",5,Best Cinematography I've Seen - Deserving of this Oscar,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,4523,"['stand', 'confidently', 'loved', 'side', 'room', 'Tree', 'Life', 'cinematography', 'Emmanual', 'Lubezski', 'spectacular', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'commented', 'could', 'hit', 'pause', 'moment', 'Tree', 'Life', ""'d"", 'have', 'image', 'worthy', 'framing', 'loved', 'movement', 'camera', 'seemed', 'go', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'angle', 'nearly', 'scene', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'love', 'affair', 'going', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'cinematographers', 'love', 'morning', 'light', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'powerful.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'was', 'magnificent', 'film', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'relate', 'one', 'more', 'characters', 'reasons', 'appeal', 'personal', 'emotional', 'basis', 'related', 'young', 'man', 'struggles', 'identity', 'shed', 'tear', 'end', 'was', 'how', 'badly', 'miss', 'own', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'gracefully', 'portrayed', 'Ms.', 'Chastain', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'reason', 'movie', 'reached', 'heart', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'willing', 'embrace', 'fundamental', 'ambiguity', 'curiosity', 'enthusiasm.In', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'was', 'challenged', 'relative', 'lack', 'audio', 'recording', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'way', 'where', 'ephemeral', 'methods', 'employed', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'meant', 'would', 'be', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'scenes', 'Ms.', 'Chastain', 'was', 'most', 'brilliant.I', 'might', 'have', 'changed', 'balance', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'dinosaur', 'astrophysics', 'young', 'male', 'acting', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'development', 'other', 'two', 'brothers', 'Mom', 'reality', 'older', 'brother', 'Penn', 'later', 'life', 'However', 'given', 'story', 'roots', 'biblical', 'story', 'Job', 'thought', 'was', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'smile', 'screenplay', 'so', 'much', 'pre-', 'historic', 'scenes', 'were', 'decidedly', 'un-creationist', 'Perhaps', 'exchange', 'dinosaur', 'action', 'keeping', 'grace', 'film', 'more', 'footage', 'ancient', 'rainforest', 'rain', 'savannah', 'wind', 'desert', 'heat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'reinforce', 'grace', 'nature', 'Anyway', 'wonder', 'evolutionary', 'implications', 'prehistoric', 'scenes', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'written', 'have', 'logged', 'Amazon', 'write', 'many', 'one', 'two', 'sentence', 'one', 'star', 'possible', 'and/or', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'damage', 'possible', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Were', 'offended', 'religious', 'level', 'Was', 'mysterious', 'crystalline', 'light', 'background', 'dark', 'not', 'enough', 'divine', 'symbolism', 'are', 'memories', 'perfect', 'genetic', 'clone', 'not', 'none', 'memories', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'Malick', 'portrayal', 'memory', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Short', 'clips', 'Varying', 'amounts', 'sound', 'Unconventional', 'perspectives', 'Varying', 'speed', 'kinds', 'light', 'movie', 'light', 'used', 'artists', 'tool', 'brilliant', 'morning', 'light', 'fire', 'candles', 'interior', 'filtered', 'light', 'etc', 'Many', 'scenes', 'have', 'sound', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'amount', 'work', 'went', 'preparations', 'shooting', 'individual', 'scenes.Right', 'now', 'am', 'thinking', 'Mrs.', ""O'Brien"", 'son', 'river', 'have', 'backs', 'light', 'evening', 'breeze', 'are', 'sheltering', 'something', 'bright', 'fire', 'light', 'hands', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'moments', 'life', 'recall', 'Others', 'have', 'criticized', 'Malick', 'art', 'totally', 'embrace', 'look', 'forward', 'tracking', 'down', 'more', 'it.I', 'have', 'one', 'question', 'would', 'ask', 'Mr', 'Malick', 'could', 'so', 'many', 'artists', 'who', 'contributed', 'film', 'actors', 'camera', 'scenery', 'animation', 'special', 'effects', 'included', 'contributed', 'art', 'way', 'was', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'overall', 'theme', 'character', 'movie', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'Malick', 'heavy', 'directing', 'hand', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'artists', 'who', 'embraced', 'theme', 'free', 'explore', 'art', 'general', 'light', 'touch', 'Malick', 'event', 'collection', 'artists', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'overall', 'richness', 'end', 'product', 'wonderful', 'example', 'music', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'rich', 'emotional', 'melancholy', 'music', 'powerful', 'yet', 'not', 'force', 'listener', 'specific', 'conclusion', 'modest', 'ambiguity.Taken', 'whole', 'Tree', 'Life', 'out', 'very', 'important', 'worthy', 'film', 'entirely', 'unconventional', 'effective', 'approach', 'visual', 'art', 'story', 'telling']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

1392854,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B004A8ZX32,Brian Driver,"[4, 18]","[NOTE: I am NOT concerned with revealing any spoilers here in this review, as they would only serve to help you to know what it is you missed by the time this movie is over.  Believe me, you won't figure it out when you see this movie.]Years ago I acted in a school play and became friends with one of the leads as we practiced.  The good news: the play got rave reviews, and his role was particularly well received.  The bad news: overnight, he became an artiste, and his Army/Navy duds were quickly replaced by beret and ascot, and from then on he was too cool to be friends with the likes of me.I think Terrence Malick might be along these lines: the darling of the elite, he frequently is awarded epithets like ""auteur,"" ""cineaste,"" ""master,"" ""genius,"" etc....  He is famously reclusive, has put out a miniscule amount of work (this is his sixth film in a little over 40 years--to which I say thank God) yet each release is cause for a film community that could not be more tickled if you stood beside them with a feather and a rubber glove.I also assume that working for him must also be ""de rigueur"" for anyone who wishes to consider him or herself truly to have reached the pinnacle of the art.  I think it must be just as important to be able to drop the word bombs so loved by those elites who are, in fact, much like my old acting buddy: ""I was talking to Terry yesterday..."" or ""It's just like Terry said the other day...""  I cite as my evidence the ridiculous thatch of pubic hair Brad Pitt has been sporting on his chin in public over the last year or so--one can only wear such a ridiculous doo when he's been up on the mountain, man, and ""seen things...""I don't know why I keep coming back.  While I liked the outlaw movie ""Badlands,"" in 1973, I truly believed I was DONE with him after watching several hours of windy grass in 1978's ""Days of Heaven.""  Unfortunately, I found myself too ready to forgive him twenty years later when I went to see ""The Thin Red Line,"" having read and really loved the book.  I have never wanted to switch places with a WWII soldier in the Pacific islands before, but I sincerely thought they got the better end of the deal a few hours later.Still, I went to this one. ..what the hell was I thinking?  Sure, sure, I have no one to blame but myself.  I feel like a smoker who attempts to protest the eventual tube in my esophagus -all the while holding the cigarette to my throat and STILL puffing...Oh--in case you're wondering--if you've read this far you MIGHT  just like this film.  We're up to the seventh paragraph and I haven't told you A THING about the plot.  You'll be waiting a lot longer to get one in this movie, and if you want to get to the meaning of this film you'll probably have to wait almost as long as the time span it covers.Which brings to mind this fact: did I mention that it has some scenes from the DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE in this film, and they don't even occur at the START of the film?  No, they only occur after the film has shown many fuzzy, blurry shots simultaneous with inaudible whispers wherein characters without names are shown reacting to bad news we can't hear over the phone.  I for the life of me don't have any idea why Sean Penn is looking sad, as he has the second easiest pay day in recorded cinematic history:  he only has to look morose whenever the camera is on him, which is not often.(In case you're wondering, the EASIEST payday in recorded cinematic history goes to the famous mime Marcel Marceau in Mel Brook's ""Silent Movie,"" who only had to say ""No,"" which I wish I had had the sense to say myself.)OK, so after establishing so much so well in the early part of this film, Malick then makes the aforementioned cut to the Dawn of Time, and then of course back again (by a doorway in the sea--don't ask) to the heart of the movie.Incidentally, this is my eleventh paragraph, and unless you've been reading them at, say, ten minutes per, I am still beating Malick's screenplay.  HERE, for about 45 minutes, the story begins to make sense, though this fact evidently must have gotten back to the director, who quickly ended the movie.  So that you will be able to tell WHEN this occurs, because nothing in the storyline will, just look to your left and right.

1392855,A8NMHEHDYJ5OU,B004A8ZX32,Brian McInnis,"[16, 30]","So rarely is film let out of its cage. So scarcely is the language of movies used as though it's never been spoken before.Terrence Malick's fifth film is a grand victory of human awareness and stands among the greatest, most fearlessly original and most universal of all films. It explores human experience from the inside, from within its characters' thoughts and sensations. Malick identifies its protagonist as its viewer and assembles a multitude of brief impressions of astounding vividness to act as an analogue of our own collection of memories. Roger Ebert wrote of Charlie Kaufman's great 'Synecdoche New York','For thousands of years, fiction made no room for characters who changed. Men felt the need for an explanation of their baffling existence, created gods, and projected onto them the solutions for their enigmas. These gods of course had to be immutable, for they stood above the foibles of men. Zeus was Zeus and Apollo was Apollo and that was that. We envisioned them on mountaintops, where they were little given to introspection. We took the situation as given, did our best, created arts that were always abstractions in the sense that they existed outside ourselves. Harold Bloom believes Shakespeare introduced the human personality into fiction. When Richard III looked in the mirror and asked himself what role he should play, and Hamlet asked the fundamental question To be, or not to be, the first shoe was dropped, and ""Synecdoche"" and many other works have dropped the second shoe.''The Tree of Life' is an other of the greatest of these works. As the years pass, our films seem to be moving deeper and deeper inward. This film attempts to be a mirror. It shows us a life such as our own and asks us to discern what is important in a life, what is good, what is lasting; and what is meaningless noise, what does not last. Kaufman's film also explored the human experience in an unconventional way, but while it had very little compassion and was devoid of wonder, Malick's film possesses those qualities and others in rich abundance.One the main objects of this film is to evoke the early experiences and impressions of a human life, spanning about a decade. And one of its most masterful sections is the one dealing with the first three years or so. The many brief images and events we see delineate a landscape of early memories; we're delighted by the colorful bubbles we blow. A child with a grotesque Halloween mask. Our mother dances with us and we love her. That chair just moved by itself, didn't it? A scary dog barks at us and we stay behind our mother. A new baby, what does it do? We dream of the strange triangular room in the attic we went up in once or twice. Night after night our mother kisses us and turns out the lamp and this is the way our life passes. A glow seems to surround all things. I don't doubt nearly all of us could construct a similar sequence from our own memories (Dressing me in the morning, my father says, 'Up-a-sky!', throwing his arms upward. I raise mine in response, beaming back at him with delight - his and mine - as my night-shirt is swished off me).As we grow older and more aware, as the script says, 'Gradually, the subtle radiance passes from things, as though a layer of cloud had come up over the sun. Slowly as the dawn, the boy is growing up.' We begin to see bad things, sad things. Why does that man walk funny? Will our mother have to look as old as grandma does some day? Later, these things seem to be present in many places, or most. What did that man do to go to jail? Could it happen to us? Then we even find it in ourselves; we disobey our mother even though we love her, and we don't know why! We can't resist playing mean tricks on our little brother, dangerous dares. What did we do? Why aren't things the way they used to be? 'How do I get back?'Malick had his current style of film-making basically set since his third film, 'The Thin Red Line', but there its greatness was constrained by particularities of the project: its protagonist's wonderings did not feel genuine, its original score was unsatisfactory (my advice to film-makers: Most, to nearly all of the time, use preexisting music, or don't use any), multiple tiny roles filled by distractingly famous actors, and other problems. In his next film, the excellent 'The New World', most of those problems were absent, although, like 'Thin Red Line', it still took place within a historical event it was constrained to tell and to serve. But here Malick has broken free of all that, has no one's story to tell but his own, and applies his poetic technique with complete freedom to the life of this common suburban family (and many other things). One of the most important parts of making books or movies is knowing your subject and its details cold. Setting 'Tree of Life' in the same environment and time Malick himself grew up in, he holds all the cards here too for the first time. He soars where before he could only leap.I love, love, love the way Malick makes movies. He spurns artificial light, films his actors constantly (even when they don't know it), foreswears story-boards, always seeks to captivate fleeting, chance moments; a butterfly alighting on Mrs. O'Brien's hand, thunder flashing in the skies before Pocahontas, an inquisitive baby giving John Smith a kiss. He films and edits what ever and how ever he wants; what ever feels right, what ever is beautiful. He loves open fields, tall grass. He loves twilight and dusk. He loves water. He loves Sol, loves its light shining among plants, among people. He loves flocks of birds, hands holding hands, heads turned upward. He loves things that glow. He nearly always shoots manually; his camera is free. It swings and flutters about Smith and Pocahontas as they embrace. It runs joyously through a forest, peering upward and making Sol beam and dance among the branches and leaves. I am so very grateful there exists such a film-maker as him.Now, the degree to which there are 'good' actors and 'bad' actors is much exaggerated; actors are basically as good as the script is and the director allows or coaxes them to be. But there are actors who simply ARE the characters they play; who fit them like a glove. Brad Pitt has worked perfectly well in many roles; I should note he does not fit the over-bearing, mood-shifting Mr. O'Brien seamlessly. We're aware every moment that we're watching Brad Pitt playing this character. In a way, the softness his acting produces between himself and his often harsh character may be in keeping with the film's gentle feel. I don't know. I learn that Heath Ledger was originally intended to play the part. I think he would have been just about the perfect fit; not as bright-eyed a man as Pitt, excellent at conveying a certain muddle-mindedness. Look at his character in 'Brokeback Mountain', in which he had children too. Think of how he might have raised sons if he had been more of a family man and you pretty much have the character right there, accent and insufficient love for his wife and all. But so it goes.Mr. O'Brien is a remnant of a past age in which men lived by their toughness, by their ability to control, to discipline, to command. He raises his sons the way his instincts dictate him to, the way his line has succeeded. But our genes can linger far longer than the conditions which bred them, and a boy need no longer be taught in such detail how best to fight back if he is hit. 'If he blinks, crack 'im!' This generates hype and a sense of moral importance on an event which will not likely ever come (and certainly their father's attempted training sessions only disturbs the boys). In the script, driving by a team of disheveled men digging a ditch in a poor part of the town, their father advises them: 'See those people. Somebody got the upper hand with them. Don't let it happen to you. You've got to get ahead of the other guy. He'll be doing all he can to do the same to you.' And later, 'If you're good, people take advantage of you. Think of yourself as someone caught behind enemy lines. Work! Fight! I see you wasting your time -- staring out the window -- playing! I make sacrifices for you. You honor those sacrifices by what you do. That's how a family works.' His mind is every where at once, among other, worse problems. Malick describes him early in the script: 'His boys regard him warily. His sharp, sarcastic words, and orders so irrational he hardly expects that they will be obeyed. He never asks what they did at school. He does not know the names of their friends. Were he to inquire, they would suspect it was a trap.' 'He has the unshakable belief that he must approve or modify everything the children do. He is full of petty and exasperating cautions.'Oh dear. Sean Penn. Poor Sean Penn. He costarred in an other of the greatest films I've seen, Tim Robbins' 'Dead Man Walking', and was so perfect as Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's 'Milk', that I have, at times, passed pictures of the real Harvey and temporarily failed to mentally differentiate between the two men. Penn called Malick's script the most magnificent one he'd ever read (he can say that again), but was disappointed and a bit confused by the filmed result, and that his own small role ended up being essentially one of a figure rather than a character (and alas for Penn, since his first film, 'Badlands', of nearly four decades before, Malick has not made actor's films). It's true that the script was clearer about several things, especially Penn's character's existence in the city: 'The others do not meet his eyes. Each makes his way alone, shut up within himself. None can be sure of the other. No tie is fixed or lasting.' 'The supreme misery:... to find oneself abandoned to the busy dance of things which pass away.' My guess is it's one of the best things ever written, and much less a movie script than a poetic story, stunningly beautiful, unbelievably vivid in its descriptions of places and experiences. But many of its ideas would be impossible to communicate in film, and ultimately the best medium for the script, as it was in that form, was the written word. I would console him by saying the film has a power very few have ever achieved, and an effect no other has.The stellar accretion sequence is simply the most powerful and awesome passage of film ever made. There doesn't seem to be any beginning or end of existence, nor a smallest scale of matter, or largest. Multitudes live among the immensity of a single leg of a mite, the keys I type these words on are uneven plateaus gigamiles across. A galaxy is a twisting amoebic mote, stars are searing subatomic particles and my neighbor's welcome mat is more vast than all the wastes of Mars. I set a glass of milk on a table, and there it will stay with all the worlds it contains for a million aeons before I pick it up again, and an ocean wave is no more or less a passing shape than the Eagle Nebula. In our search through the inward planes, we now find within the realm of orbiting spheres to exist a landscape of webbed and dancing strings. This will never end. And all the matter we have perceived is a little explosion whose trifling cause we can not see, whose flying sparks will in an instant fade and turn to lifeless smoke, perhaps to be dispersed by a wind or to sink into an earth, forgotten or unseen. It does not end, it only continues. We live in infinity and eternity. But the film shows us with humbling beauty what little we know of outward realms, and of the history of the continual rearrangement of matter, and gives context of the O'Brien family's existence; the cauldron that will become their world, the microbes they will descend from.Some silly people inform us that Malick's acceptance of current models of the formation of the galactic realm, of Earth and its biology, conflicts with his at least semibiblical spirituality (he opens the film with scripture and refers to it a number of times, among other examples, and he is as interested in the birth of a soul as of a world), because it contradicts all that the creationists say. Malick, I'm sure, could scarcely care less about the current fancies of that endless debate. He knows that scientists do not spend their years making up malicious lies, and he also obviously feels a silent goodness in the universe. Says Jack the script: 'You whom we met in the woods and on the hills, whom first in her eyes we knew -- how shall I name you?' In 'The New World', Pocahontas speaks to it in the same fashion: 'Dear Mother, you fill the land with your beauty. You reach to the end of the world. How shall I seek you?' Around me I hear religious people confiding to each other that their god feels more present to them when they walk through woods, when they see and do beautiful things, than when reading their holy book. My mother tells me she felt this goodness touch her one night as she sat quietly holding one of her newly born children.Those who search eventually find the word 'god' to be an ancient verb meaning 'to call out to'. This is exactly what Malick's characters do, although they never once use the word in direct address of the presence they speak to. Kneeling at the foot of his bed, young Jack goes through his prayers as he's been taught to, but we hear his true thoughts running underneath. 'I wanna see what you see.' Malick's main characters tend to have, deep down, the advantage of a rare freedom from established theology; a freedom to directly question their gods, not only request of or thank them (I must confess I lacked this freedom at his age and didn't look beyond my considered prayers). 'You let a boy die. You let any thing happen. Why should I be good if you're not?'I suppose any established theistic religion tends to forget the idea of such questions, as they seem to go for ever unanswered, and focus on established assumptions. Malick, though, does a thing that few people have had the courage to do in perhaps a very, very long time by renewing those questions, insisting on them; by once more crying out to the powers that may or may not be. 'What are we to you? Answer me.' And perhaps, at times, answers are not wholely absent. Near the end of 'The New World', chasing her little son through a garden in England, feeling peace at last, Pocahontas seems to find one. 'Mother. Now I know where you live.'Terrence Malick is the great poet of the cinema, and 'The Tree of Life' may remain his greatest poem. It is, among so many other things, the ultimate family movie. It radiates a holiness of family, draws us closer to those we love most. The over-arching tale of 'The Tree of Life' is simple: A man is lost amid a perplexing life lacking purpose and joy. The tale opens in brokenness as he and his mother and father mourn the loss of his younger brother, the kindest and gentlest of the three sons. Seeking a way from his meaningless toil, a way back to the Eden he once knew, he lays his hand on a tree and witnesses the past and future of himself and of all existence pass before him. Jack - and we, the viewers - begin a search for meaning, for that which is lasting, holy.I am stunned to learn that Malick himself lost his own younger brother as a young man, for which he largely blames himself, and has borne that guilt and grief for the rest of his life. This explains so much about his films - this one above all - and the depth, meaning and power of it are made so much more profound by this knowledge. 'The Tree of Life' is the product of a tortured man, and what we see in it is not only his philosophical message, but is from his own wounded heart. His own pain is present. We are told artists must suffer for their art, and here Terrence Malick, in his anguish for his little brother he's carried since the late sixties, has made a film which stands among the greatest and most essential of all human art. Jack's vision of the after-life is also more clear in this light; what Malick shows us is not only his belief, but is deeply personally important to him. It is his consolation, his hope.Above all, the film is wondrous. It instills us with its wonder, its awe of all things, and helps us to better appreciate beauty and goodness when it passes before us; to hold on to it, how ever small or brief. There's a moment in the film that moves me more than film has ever before moved me. One morning, when the boys wake to find their father has gone on a trip, and they're free to romp in the house and tease their mother with a lizard and for once life is as it ought be with them, they run outside laughing with her as 'Les Baricades Misterieuses' plays, and we hear the mother's prayer for her children - for all that live. 'Help each other. Love every one. Every leaf. Every ray of light. Forgive.'",5,"If You See Only One Film in Your Life, See This One",1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,16786,"['So', 'rarely', 'film', 'let', 'cage', 'So', 'scarcely', 'language', 'movies', 'used', 'never',

1392857,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004A8ZX32,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","It only feels like an eon while watching this film.Believe it or not, it took me over a year to get through this movie.  I am completely serious.  I recorded it on &#34;free&#34; TV, and I've watched bits and pieces where I've been able.  One year later, I finally watched the credits role.  And while I give this film a 4, those credits were as welcome as a cooked turkey on Thanksgiving.This film shows the danger of making a film while smoking too much dope.  Naturally, I'm teasing a bit.  But holy cow; if you're going to make a film, is it really a smart idea to nearly require your audience to have a degree in psychology to just get through it?I loved the way this film started, and I loved the cinematography.  The film seems to start out with the basic theme:  &#34;You cannot control your destiny.&#34;  And that would be naturally a tautology, as &#34;destiny&#34; will be the things that will happen to you out of your control.  But then the film took an odd darker turn.I've read quite a bit from Freud, and I've read quite a bit about true-crime as well, particularly serial killers and their motivations.  And from what I remember -- do not shoot the messenger, as I do not necessarily hold these same opinions myself -- Freud believed that young boys became homosexuals when they became too attached to their mothers.  That perspective became quite politically incorrect, and the perspective has changed over the years.Supposedly now, it is believed that boys who don't spend enough time with their fathers -- and then become attached to their mothers -- later on learn to dislike their mothers as a nasty side effect.  Because of this, those boys become misogynistic, and take out their frustrations on other females later in life.  These types of males tend to become serial killers.  Once again, do not shoot the messenger.Why is this important to the film?  Well, there is a sequence that obviously borrows from these ideas here.  One of the sons grows dark half way through, and he starts to commit some petty crimes and become &#34;mean&#34; at least.  And I thought that he might go darker than that.  While watching, I actually thought that the movie maybe should have been entitled, &#34;How Serial Killers are Born&#34; perhaps.This film felt like three films to me; I liked the beginning, the middle went dark, and then the ending seemed to go completely off the rails.  But did I like it?It depends upon what &#34;like&#34; means.  I think that, if you have an eon or so, this is worth a peek.  But you might just be scratching your head, just as I did while watching.",4,It Only Felt Like an Eon,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2597,"['only', 'eon', 'watching', 'film.Believe', 'not', 'took', 'over', 'year', 'get', 'movie', 'am', 'completely', 'serious', 'recorded', '34', 'free', '34', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'bits', 'pieces', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'finally', 'watched', 'credits', 'role', 'give', 'film', '4', 'credits', 'were', 'as', 'welcome', 'cooked', 'turkey', 'Thanksgiving.This', 'film', 'danger', 'making', 'film', 'smoking', 'too', 'much', 'dope', 'Naturally', ""'m"", 'teasing', 'bit', 'holy', 'cow', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'film', 'really', 'smart', 'idea', 'nearly', 'require', 'audience', 'have', 'degree', 'psychology', 'just', 'get', 'loved', 'way', 'film', 'started', 'loved', 'cinematography', 'film', 'start', 'out', 'basic', 'theme', '34', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'destiny.', '34', 'would', 'be', 'naturally', 'tautology', '34', 'destiny', '34', 'will', 'be', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'control', 'then', 'film', 'took', 'odd', 'darker', 'turn.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'quite', 'bit', 'Freud', ""'ve"", 'read', 'quite', 'bit', 'about', 'true-crime', 'well', 'particularly', 'serial', 'killers', 'motivations', 'what', 'remember', 'do', 'not', 'shoot', 'messenger', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'hold', 'same', 'opinions', 'Freud', 'believed', 'young', 'boys', 'became', 'homosexuals', 'when', 'became', 'too', 'attached', 'mothers', 'perspective', 'became', 'quite', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'perspective', 'changed', 'years.Supposedly', 'now', 'believed', 'boys', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'fathers', 'then', 'become', 'attached', 'mothers', 'later', 'learn', 'dislike', 'mothers', 'nasty', 'side', 'effect', 'boys', 'become', 'misogynistic', 'take', 'out', 'frustrations', 'other', 'females', 'later', 'life', 'types', 'males', 'tend', 'become', 'serial', 'killers', 'Once', 'again', 'do', 'not', 'shoot', 'messenger.Why', 'important', 'film', 'Well', 'sequence', 'obviously', 'ideas', 'here', 'One', 'sons', 'dark', 'half', 'way', 'commit', 'petty', 'crimes', 'become', '34', 'mean', '34', 'least', 'thought', 'might', 'go', 'darker', 'watching', 'actually', 'thought', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'entitled', '34', 'How', 'Serial', 'Killers', 'are', 'Born', '34', 'perhaps.This', 'film', 'felt', 'three', 'films', 'liked', 'beginning', 'middle', 'went', 'dark', 'then', 'ending', 'seemed', 'go', 'completely', 'rails', 'did', 'what', '34', '34', 'means', 'think', 'have', 'eon', 'so', 'peek', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'just', 'did', 'watching']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I think if saw this film 20 years ago, I probably would have hated it.  Now, I'm faced with big decisions - whether to start a family, and all the concerns that come with it.  This movie raises issues I'd rather not think about.  I almost wish I hadn't seen it.  If you're looking for escapist Hollywood fare, the film might seem boring.  It plays like a movie where nothing happens.  The first third of the film, the director puts you into the head of a mother who has lost a child.  Yeah, it's pretty heavy.  And most of the rest of the film is of the kids growing up.  The film is a meditation, more heavy on emotion than story.  And it's more of a spiritual/religious film than a traditional drama.  There is little dialogue in the movie.  The imagery is compelling, though.  Some of the imagery is surreal and dreamlike - and yeah, dinosaurs make an appearance in the film.  But it's not Jurassic Park.  I wrote down a quote from the film:  ""The only way to be happy is to love.  Unless you love, your life will flash by.""  I wouldn't have given a second thought to that if I were a 20-year-old.  But I'm older now, and this suddenly means something to me.  It's definitely not an upbeat feel-good movie.

1392860,AKUIYX3PU2PJL,B004A8ZX32,Carmen Ferreiro-Esteban,"[170, 176]","The Tree of Life is not only a movie, but an experience. It's a visually stunning, deeply moving and perfectly acted film. And if you know what to expect, you may enjoy it as much as I did.But be warned. The Tree of Life does not have a linear narrative, and doesn't tell a story as much as it shows it. And the regular viewer--that is, most of us--, used to be told in images and words what we are supposed to see and feel, may find this story hard to follow.The movie starts with a flaming light and a quotation from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation...while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""Then we are shown a woman (Jessica Chastain) as she learns in a letter the death of her son, age 19. In her grief and despair, enhanced by the absence of sound in the subsequent images, the mother questions God's design in such a seemingly cruel act.From here, the movie proceeds in two alternating levels. One shows the creation of the universe, the gathering of dust that made the planets, the apparition of microscopic life, scenes from the time of the dinosaurs and the destruction of most life on Earth as a consequence of a meteor hitting our planet.In another level we are shown images from the life of a contemporary middle aged man (Sean Penn): his birth in the 1950s to a loving mother (Jessica Chastain), his growing up in Texas under a strict father (Brad Pitt), his rebellion as an adolescent and his relationship with his two younger brothers. The second, the one he is closer to, will die later at 19 as we learned at the beginning of the movie.The story unfolds in pieces and bits, the way our memory works: some scenes from our past are vividly clear while others are lost. The overall picture that unfolds is both that of a unique human being and an universal story.If the movie sounds dreadfully boring, it's my fault. The Tree of Life maybe slow but it's never boring.So, in conclusion, if you want an adrenaline rush, a fast moving thriller or a light comedy, don't watch The Tree of Life. But if you want to take a break from a too stressful life and step in a world made out of memories and dreams.

But don't buy or rent it if you're looking for a traditional story with a firm linear plot, a logical sequence and easy-to-understand concepts.  It's more like undergoing an artistic/philospohical experience as opposed to watching and absorbing a storyline.

Everyone naturally focuses on the nonlinear plot.I've seen the movie twice.  First time blind, and was sitting there during the creation/formation scene wondering what in the world was going on.  Once I got past that, the film focuses on the family in the 50's, and it was mesmerizing.  After seeing it, I thought about it for days.  I still think about it (obviously).I'm sure Brad Pitt considers it his best performance.  I have to laugh at Sean Penn's reaction - I'm not at all surprised to read that he doesn't understand his role.I think the director approaches film in a much different way than most - that is the film isn't a linear story told straight as if from a book.  Instead, images are snapshots taken sort of at random, much like the mind works, especially when at rest.So many vignettes are excellently portrayed here -- RL's impromptu duet with his father, the horrific BB rifle scene (and redemption), the playful scene when the father is gone, the awful scene where he steals, the garden scene with the father, the parallels of the waitress scene & the school girl scene, the window-tapping as they measure each other scene.The music is so important to this movie.This is probably the most religious movie I've seen, and I suspect a lot of people find that threatening.  For those of a religious bent, the ending should be plausible.  (I'm trying to avoid spoilers in this review)The one question I'd love to ask the director is why the need for the youngest brother, who is almost never in the movie.  I've read that the director's brother, overwhelmed by guitar studies,  mutilated his hand before killing himself.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

1392866,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B004A8ZX32,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","I would go out on a limb and say that there are probably not many other directors who divide the viewing public more than Terrance Malick. His films are an art form, but often they are so immersed in the art form that the viewers may lose the film before it's done. Which is a disservice. Especially since the best way to appreciate this film is by taking a step back and looking at the whole picture.First I must comment on the blu-ray visuals. Fantastic. This is one of those films that shines. There is even a series of scenes starting with the big bang and progressing through evolution and into the 'present'. The scene could have been very disastrous. But somehow Malick makes this work.Music is of utmost importance. There are many great tracks, but of note is the use of Smetana's Moldau. It fits the film perfectly. But the classical score is so well matched to each scene that I can't imagine watching this film without the score.If you view the events of this film as an abstract of eastern philosophy, then it makes much more sense. Malick is putting forward the belief that all life is interconnected (hence Tree of Life). The other influence is more along the Biblical sense (kind of countering the Eastern philosophy). The premise is ""Why do we suffer?"" and in fact this is spoken aloud in the film.The only two points that warrant me giving this a 98 out of 100: There is a scene where Chastain is floating around as if in a vortex - it was jarring and I felt the scene could have been better if she was skipping around in the forest maybe lighter than air? The other point was in the latter 3/4 part of the film. I think Malick drew out the scenes with the boys a little too much - I mentioned it to my partner (hey, I'm kind of wanting to move on past the boys' scenes) and then it changed right after that.Sean Penn isn't in the film very much, so it's a little odd to see him get second top billing along with Pitt, but I guess his name carries weight. Brad Pitt though is phenomenal and deserves much credit for his role. Even the kids are pretty fantastic. The acting is mostly subtle and there isn't a ton of dialogue, much to the style of Malick.I loved the film and count it among the best films in recent years. It is as close to perfection as I have seen lately. It does require one to suspend many preconceptions about film in general, but if one is able to set aside these notions and enjoy the film as a work of art as a whole, then the viewer will be rewarded.And I highly recommend the Blu-Ray, it looks great! (And take note of the digital copy, as with most, it has an expiration date).",5,"Transcendent, epic, powerful.

1392867,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B004A8ZX32,Christopher Culver,"[1, 2]","Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story.In the 1950s, two parents bring up three boys in an American white middle-class, small-town existence. The mother (Jessica Chastain) radiates love and warmth, while the father (Brad Pitt) feels the obligation to be cold and distant in order to prepare his sons for the cruel world that awaits them. As we are informed at the beginning of the film, sometime during this mid-century upbringing, one of the boys would eventually die. We are also shown flashfowards to the present day, when the eldest son Jack, now a successful architect working in New York City, reflects on the death of his brother decades ago. There is very little conventional spoken dialogue in this family drama. The story is told through voiceovers on top of a rich series of images, these monologues representing the inner thoughts, doubts and fears of the characters.But Malick adds something on top of this, one of the most controversial turns in Hollywood filmmaking in recent years. Early on we are treated to a depiction of the creation of the universe and of life on Earth, from the initial clouds of gas right after the Big Bang to small nebulae, then big galaxies like our own Milky Way, the Earth as an inchoate ball of lava, life arising in tidepools, and then into the era of the dinosaurs. These special effects were created by Douglas Trumbull, best known for the cosmic visuals of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The titles of the film quote from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth, when the morning stars sang together?""I get what Malick is trying to do here, that is, to show that the trials and tribulations of an individual human life are part of some vast unknown plan. Nonetheless, while I can understand this on an intellectual level, the film does not seem to reconcile the two layers into a single coherent plot. The film is indeed a visual feast on a first viewing (the Bluray release watched on a project is nearly as stunning as 2001), but the TREE OF LIFE is much harder to sit through on a repeat viewing when one knows that it doesn't quite hang together. Furthermore, as thought-provoking as the story of the boys' 1950s upbringing is, the last part with its scenes of petty delinquency goes on forever and should have been cut. Finally, the ending which I won't spoil here is a total trope, not at all a fresh take on the meaning of life.At a time when Hollywood is widely regarded as stagnant, I can appreciate a director like Malick who seeks to do something unexpected, but I find THE TREE OF LIFE to be rather a noble failure.",3,"Incredible visuals, but greatly unsatisfying on repeat viewings when one knows the film's two layers won't jibe",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2677,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'attempt', 'inject', 'cosmic', 'wonder', 'most', 'mundane', 'American', 'story.In', '1950s', 'two', 'parents', 'bring', 'up', 'three', 'boys', 'American', 'white', 'middle-class', 'small-town', 'existence', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'love', 'warmth', 'father', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'obligation', 'be', 'cold', 'distant', 'order', 'prepare', 'sons', 'cruel', 'world', 'are', 'informed', 'beginning', 'film', 'sometime', 'mid-century', 'upbringing', 'one', 'boys', 'would', 'eventually', 'die', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'flashfowards', 'present', 'day', 'when', 'eldest', 'son', 'Jack', 'now', 'successful', 'architect', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'death', 'brother', 'decades', 'ago', 'very', 'little', 'conventional', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'family', 'drama', 'story', 'told', 'voiceovers', 'top', 'rich', 'series', 'images', 'monologues', 'representing', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'doubts', 'fears', 'characters.But', 'Malick', 'something', 'top', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'turns', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'recent', 'years', 'Early', 'are', 'treated', 'depiction', 'creation', 'universe', 'life', 'Earth', 'initial', 'clouds', 'gas', 'right', 'Big', 'Bang', 'small', 'nebulae', 'then', 'big', 'galaxies', 'own', 'Milky', 'Way', 'Earth', 'inchoate', 'ball', 'lava', 'life', 'arising', 'tidepools', 'then', 'era', 'dinosaurs', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'created', 'Douglas', 'Trumbull', 'best', 'known', 'cosmic', 'visuals', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'titles', 'film', 'quote', 'Book', 'Job', 'Where', 'were', 'when', 'laid', 'foundation', 'earth', 'when', 'morning', 'stars', 'sang', 'together', 'get', 'what', 'Malick', 'trying', 'do', 'here', 'show', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'individual', 'human', 'life', 'are', 'part', 'vast', 'unknown', 'plan', 'Nonetheless', 'can', 'understand', 'intellectual', 'level', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'reconcile', 'two', 'layers', 'single', 'coherent', 'plot', 'film', 'indeed', 'visual', 'feast', 'first', 'viewing', 'Bluray', 'release', 'watched', 'project', 'nearly', 'as', 'stunning', '2001', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'much', 'harder', 'sit', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'when', 'one', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hang', 'together', 'Furthermore', 'as', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'boys', '1950s', 'upbringing', 'last', 'part', 'scenes', 'petty', 'delinquency', 'forever', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Finally', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'total', 'trope', 'not', 'fresh', 'take', 'meaning', 'life.At', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'widely', 'regarded', 'stagnant', 'can', 'appreciate', 'director', 'Malick', 'who', 'do', 'something', 'unexpected', 'find', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'be', 'rather', 'noble', 'failure']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

More reprehensible than anything the film does, positively or negatively, is how utterly over the top some praise of the film has been, and how utterly ridiculous some of the criticism of the film has been. Granted, some of this has been generated by Malick, and the promotional efforts for the film, but, frankly, many big name, and lesser name critics, have simply imbued and misconstrued their own critical lack and imaginative dead rot into their reviews, and missed the boat on this film, from some of its most basic elements through its more nuanced themes and evocations.",4,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1132,"['American', 'film', 'director', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'fifth', 'feature', 'film', 'release', 'four', 'decades', 'business', 'Tree', 'Life', 'film', 'parts', 'greatest', 'techniques', 'moments', 'ever', 'recorded', 'film', 'history', 'also', 'fatal', 'narrative', 'flaws', 'prevent', 'outright', 'greatness', 'overall', 'work', 'art', 'possibly', 'worst', 'ending', 'near-great', 'film', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', '1950', 'classic', 'Rashomon', 'same', 'time', 'having', 'one', 'most', 'self-indulgent', 'showoffy', 'endings', 'film', 'Federico', 'Fellini', '8', 'More', 'reprehensible', 'anything', 'film', 'positively', 'negatively', 'how', 'utterly', 'top', 'praise', 'film', 'been', 'how', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'criticism', 'film', 'been', 'Granted', 'been', 'generated', 'Malick', 'promotional', 'efforts', 'film', 'frankly', 'many', 'big', 'name', 'lesser', 'name', 'critics', 'have', 'simply', 'imbued', 'misconstrued', 'own', 'critical', 'lack', 'imaginative', 'dead', 'rot', 'reviews', 'missed', 'boat', 'film', 'most', 'basic', 'elements', 'more', 'nuanced', 'themes', 'evocations']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

It's difficult to spoil a film like this*I had never seen a Terrence Malick film before The Tree of Life. Despite not having any sort of expectations, the final product still wasn't what I imagined it would be. The trailer didn't really reveal much of anything either, at least as far as the story is concerned. Brad Pitt plays the father of a boy who eventually grows up to be Sean Penn. That's about it. While The Tree of Life may come off as slightly pretentious and more than a little overbearing, it's difficult to argue that it isn't exactly that. But at least it offers an incredible cinematic vision in the meantime.The cinematography in The Tree of Life is truly mesmerizing. Every frame seems to tell its own unique story thanks to the way it was shot and the vibrant colors that are used throughout the film. Malick has a way of making things like trees, waterfalls, and shadows seem way more spectacular than they really are. There's a fascination with the third person perspective as we're constantly staring at the back of the actors as they react to the extraordinary world around them. Everything in the film just seems to be so full of life.Less delightful things in life are shown in a fantastic light, as well. Devastation and how it's portrayed is one of them. Jessica Chastain's emotionally powerful reaction to the letter she receives in addition to Brad Pitt's face slowly melting into a look of both recognition and sorrow as the sun bathes his look of despair as he receives this news over the phone illustrates this point to perfection. Dying trees and the way their branches plague the sky leave a fairly large impact, as well. Then there's the use of colors in the film. There's a heavy use of green for scenes that take place in the past while shades of gray are littered throughout the present. White is also used to symbolize innocence. Clouds and the sky in general are utilized throughout the film while skyscrapers seem to replace trees in present day. Perhaps the most enthralling visuals are the scenes in space. The magnitude and vast infatuation of watching nebulae, planets, stars, and life from space as the film offers is something marvelous in itself.The story is where the film stumbles. We're shown various different circles of life, so to speak, but the O'Brien family fits in there somewhere amongst outer space and dinosaurs and their story comes off a little forced rather than natural. Jack's childhood takes a front seat as we see him get into mischief with his friends and brothers and we eventually watch him develop issues towards his father, but it doesn't really go much deeper than that. A tragic event seems to bring the family together just as much as it pushes them apart. We're shown some of the trials and tribulations of life, but the story doesn't feel like it goes nearly as deep as the visuals do. The ending doesn't provide much closure either. Is Jack in heaven? Is this just his way of letting go of the past? Maybe it's just a way to symbolize his thoughts and emotional process? Is it acceptance? All of the above? The Tree of Life just left something to be desired when it came to its story.The Tree of Life is beautifully shot and eloquently acted, but is a lot to take in and feels twice as long as its 138-minute duration. The film's score is breathtaking. In addition to its use of Brahms and original pieces, simple sounds like birds and wind chimes and nothing more during certain scenes made the film sound and feel like an expression of life itself rather than just appear to look like it. The Tree of Life is incredibly abstract yet gorgeous and engrossing. It just has trouble finding its footing when it comes to storytelling.",4,"Visually stunning, but the story doesn't quite match its visual strengths",1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,3748,"['*This', 'spoilers', 'kind', 'difficult', 'spoil', 'film', 'this*I', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'film', 'Tree', 'Life', 'not', 'having', 'sort', 'expectations', 'final', 'product', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'reveal', 'much', 'anything', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'father', 'boy', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'be', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Tree', 'Life', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'slightly', 'pretentious', 'more', 'little', 'overbearing', 'difficult', 'argue', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'least', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'meantime.The', 'cinematography', 'Tree', 'Life', 'truly', 'mesmerizing', 'Every', 'frame', 'tell', 'own', 'unique', 'story', 'thanks', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'Malick', 'way', 'making', 'things', 'trees', 'waterfalls', 'shadows', 'seem', 'way', 'more', 'spectacular', 'really', 'are', 'fascination', 'third', 'person', 'perspective', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'staring', 'back', 'actors', 'react', 'extraordinary', 'world', 'Everything', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'so', 'full', 'life.Less', 'delightful', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'shown', 'fantastic', 'light', 'well', 'Devastation', 'how', 'portrayed', 'one', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'reaction', 'letter', 'addition', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'face', 'slowly', 'melting', 'look', 'recognition', 'sorrow', 'sun', 'look', 'despair', 'news', 'phone', 'point', 'perfection', 'Dying', 'trees', 'way', 'branches', 'plague', 'sky', 'leave', 'fairly', 'large', 'impact', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'use', 'colors', 'film', 'heavy', 'use', 'green', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'past', 'shades', 'gray', 'are', 'littered', 'present', 'White', 'also', 'used', 'symbolize', 'innocence', 'Clouds', 'sky', 'general', 'are', 'utilized', 'film', 'skyscrapers', 'seem', 'replace', 'trees', 'present', 'day', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'enthralling', 'visuals', 'are', 'scenes', 'space', 'magnitude', 'vast', 'infatuation', 'watching', 'nebulae', 'planets', 'stars', 'life', 'space', 'film', 'offers', 'something', 'marvelous', 'itself.The', 'story', 'where', 'film', 'stumbles', ""'re"", 'shown', 'various', 'different', 'circles', 'life', 'so', 'speak', ""O'Brien"", 'family', 'fits', 'somewhere', 'amongst', 'outer', 'space', 'dinosaurs', 'story', 'off', 'little', 'forced', 'rather', 'natural', 'Jack', 'childhood', 'front', 'seat', 'see', 'get', 'mischief', 'friends', 'brothers', 'eventually', 'watch', 'develop', 'issues', 'towards', 'father', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'much', 'deeper', 'tragic', 'event', 'bring', 'family', 'together', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'apart', ""'re"", 'shown', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'life', 'story', ""n't"", 'feel', 'nearly', 'as', 'deep', 'visuals', 'do', 'ending', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'closure', 'Jack', 'heaven', 'just', 'way', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'Maybe', 'just', 'way', 'symbolize', 'thoughts', 'emotional', 'process', 'acceptance', 'above', 'Tree', 'Life', 'just', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'when', 'came', 'story.The', 'Tree', 'Life', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'eloquently', 'acted', 'lot', 'take', 'feels', 'twice', 'as', 'long', '138-minute', 'duration', 'film', 'score', 'breathtaking', 'addition', 'use', 'Brahms', 'original', 'pieces', 'simple', 'sounds', 'birds', 'wind', 'chimes', 'nothing', 'more', 'certain', 'scenes', 'made', 'film', 'sound', 'feel', 'expression', 'life', 'rather', 'just', 'appear', 'look', 'Tree', 'Life', 'incredibly', 'abstract', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'engrossing', 'just', 'trouble', 'finding', 'footing', 'when', 'storytelling']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]
1392880,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B004A8ZX32,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[5, 8]","The Tree of Life is the latest film by reclusive director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) whose previous films displayed a simple narrative abetted by haunting imagery.  This film takes a step further by telling its story in grand strokes of imagery.  Though its technique may lead some to wonder the point of this exercise and dismiss it as confusing, others will hail it an ambitious masterwork.  Let the viewer beware.One family deals with a personal loss as it ponders the meaning of life through the point of view of its oldest son (Sean Penn), now an adult in the business world.  Celestial forces of nature signal the very creation and existence of the universe and provide a majestic background to the birth and evolution of life on earth.  We witness the beginnings of an American family from the Midwest in mid-twentieth century.  Led by a stern, proud father (Brad Pitt), and a doting mother (Jessica Chastain), three sons experience the joys and pains of growing up.  Through a rapid series of short scenes, this tapestry of sounds and images forms a mosaic of life's precious moments.  All the while a voice asks the great questions of life and God.Certainly the most ambitious film in the enigmatic director's career, it is also the most challenging.  This is pure cinema, and it is remarkable how the film is able to communicate visually albeit without much in the way of lengthy dialogue.  These fragments of life almost seem surreal as if from a Fellini film.  In a way it is kind of an experimental film on a grand scale.  It seems to ask, `what is the purpose of existence amid great loss'?  (Despite being a very spiritual film, creationists might not like the premise of some of the scenes that strongly suggest an evolutionary development of life on earth.)Those who are able to decipher the abstract nature of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey will likely have a clue on how to access the style and meaning of this film.  Indeed, some of the impressive visuals were created by Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner) who did the 2001 special visual effects and helped to realize Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has captured some stunning visuals of landscapes and life that are at times overwhelming in their beauty.  The musical score alternates between classical and operatic pieces although one almost expects a minimalist, Philip Glass-type score to pop up.There are many unanswered questions. Which brother died and how? And what is the background of the oldest brother as adult?  How has the father changed since the loss of his son and how does this affect the family?  As much as the oldest son asks for answers, we want more information and must settle for pieces from a larger puzzle.The film serves as a search for meaning and hope amid the vastness of existence.  As we see the father teach his sons about manners, chores, music, fighting, and death, we may see something in our own common, shared experiences. Life is portrayed as a series of events that sometimes blur over time.This exploration of the meaning of life may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, but to those who are open to a visual experience unlike any other, it may prove to be a fascinating exercise in pure cinema.

And while I can see why some critics love it, personally I disliked the movie as a whole. There are parts of ""Tree of Life"" which make sense and would make for an average movie by itself. The bulk of the movie centered around a couple raising 3 sons in a rural town in the 1950s. Due to the editing and sparse dialog, even this portion is a bit unconventional but at least it is cohesive and interesting at times. Brad Pitt is a great actor and does okay in his role. Sean Penn's role is so limited it feels like he was barely in the movie. Overall, the portion showing the family is a nice little ""slice of life"" feature; however, this is just a part of the whole.My main problem with the movie arises from Malick's attempt to include all of existence in its scope. The portions dealing with the beginning and end of the universe feel like a completely different movie. The idea of trying to handle all of existence is too ambitious and the movie fails because of it. Scenes composed of swirling light in the middle with whispered phrases (yes, he really does this several times) come across as pretentious. I laughed when I saw the dinosaurs because I wondered just how much of earth's history he was going to try to cover.

1392884,A3S6YZMZLUSLM0,B004A8ZX32,Dean A. Anderson,"[6, 9]","Sometimes expectations make all the difference. If you go to a museum with the expectation of seeing representational art, pretty pictures of landscapes and beautiful people, and instead find abstract combinations of colors and shapes, disappointment ensues. If you hadn't gone in expecting a Rubens, you might have really liked that Jackson Pollack.All this is to say, do not watch Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"" with an expectation of a summer blockbuster. Or even a straightforward narrative. The film is an impressionistic work that doesn't just move in and out of the character of Jack O'Brien from the present to his birth and his childhood in the early `60's in Waco, Texas; we also see the creation of the universe and quite possibly the characters in the afterlife.The film jumps from domestic scenes of family tension to static shots of great natural beauty to flights of fantasy. So if you just go into a film wanting to see ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl"" or ""man robs bank, cop chases robber, big shoot out""... Disappointment ensues. In fact, some theaters screening this film in some parts of the country have posted a sign saying, ""This film does not follow a conventional narrative structure"" to cut down on demands for refunds.These tendencies are not new to Malick. His first films, ""Badlands"" (1973) about a less glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde and ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) about farmers at the beginning of the 20th Century, featured leisurely meditations on natural beauty -- but within a traditional narrative structure.Writer/director Malick took a couple decades off before returning with ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) about the Pacific during the Second World War, a film that began Malick's downplaying of narrative. ""A New World"" (2005) about Pocahontas and John Smith had even less narrative drive, and with ""The Tree of Life"", Malick seems to work without traditional cinematic storytelling altogether.But if one goes in without expectations of a traditional narrative, there are treasures in this film. It beautifully captures what it was like growing up in a certain time and place. Even more, it captures remembering growing up. There are wonderful, natural performances by the children, especially by Hunter McCracken as young Jack. Jessica Chastain is luminous as Jack's mother and Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as a father giving his all but perhaps not giving where he should.What I appreciated most about the film was the consideration of Biblical and theological issues. The film opens with verses from the book of Job, ""Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? ...while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?"" (Chapter 38, verses 4 & 7.) We then see the characters dealing with loss as Job did, but we are given the context of the Big Bang through the dinosaurs. It is important to remember that God knows our grief, but He views it in a much larger context.We also see Jack choosing between the path of Nature (what Paul refers to as the Natural Man) as represented by his father and Grace as represented through his mother and brother. Jack even paraphrased the Apostle Paul from Romans 7:15 that he does what he does not want to do. We do see Jack's progress to finding salvation through grace.If you are open to a different movie experience, you may want to see the impressionistic work of Terrence Malick.

1392885,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004A8ZX32,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 9]","The Tree of Life"" for me was more than just a film, it was an experience.  I shed a tear and I appreciated the film because it was visually beautiful and cinematically deep and resonated strongly within me. What a wonderful, profound and beautiful film! Thank you Terrence Malick!From creating wonderful films such as ""Badlands"", ""Days of Heaven"", ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""The New World"", Terrence took on experimental elements in his 2011 drama, ""The Tree of Life"".Loved by film critics and hardcore cineaste and shunned by the average movie-goer, ""The Tree of Life"" is one of those films that you are either going to love or you are going to hate as indicated by many reviews and opinions on the Internet.VIDEO:""The Tree of Life"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  The film is absolutely gorgeous!The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Children of Men"", ""Burn After Reading"") is magnificent.  The various cuts of family, city, architecture, past, present, the afterlife,  life in balance with the CG elements of the film, there are so many cuts of this film and Lubezki and the many editors who took part in this film should be applauded.I know that this is the biggest contention that many viewers had, to be taken out of the story and having to watch the beginning of life in the universe, our galaxy and of course the comparisons to a film such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  But I do want to emphasize that ""2001' and ""Tree of Life"" are nothing similar.There is a message within the film, but its subjective of how one identifies with the film and how they interpret those scenes.  Because the CG elements may take people out of the film and lose them, I'm sure those viewers will be disappointed but for those who are able to enjoy those elements, will find how the inclusion of Malick's experimenting makes this film quite profound, visually and emotionally.Look at the cinematography and these elements of the film as a form of art, a painting or poetry, existential thoughts, nothing more, nothing less.As for the picture quality, I was amazed by how vibrant this film looks on Blu-ray and in HD.  There are so many shots utilized for this film, many colors. Even during scenes with a lot of reds where you think there is a chance of banding, none whatsoever.  No artifacts, no sign of DNR, black levels were nice and deep, detail incredibly high and everything was crisp.  Videophiles will be pleased with how breathtaking this film looks on Blu!But for the most part, ""The Tree of Life"" is a visual masterpiece!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Tree of Life"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English 2.0 Dolby Digital.When you see right at the beginning of the film that the creators of this film want you to watch this loud, you know you are in for a treat!  The lossless soundtrack for ""The Tree of Life"" is immersive!From the earlier scenes when Mrs. O'Brien opens the door to receive the telegram and then Mr. O'Brien receiving the phone call of his son's death and hearing that jet's engine and propellers envelop the soundscape, I knew that I was in for a treat.During the musical moments featuring Alexandre Desplat's music, may it be operatic or orchestral, music envelops the soundspace as all channels are being utilized.  During the narration moments, the dialogue is crisp and clear as audio is carefully selected and dialogue is heard clearly through the center channels.But once you start watching the birth of life, the creation of the universe and planet, this is where the film shines as you can hear the lava crashing into each other, during the scenes of water and hearing splashes all around you.  When the planet Earth is created, you can hear the wind and the rustling of the tree leaves, when the dinosaurs are shown, you can hear the booms and the ambiance crisp and clear.And even during the scenes with Jack playing with his brothers and friends and hearing the ambiance of sound all around you was magnificent and if I haven't mentioned it, Alexandre Desplat's music is phenomenal.Audiophiles, ""The Tree of Life"" utilizes the 7.1 soundtrack magnificently!  This is one heck of an immersive soundtrack that is magnificent!Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Tree of Life"" comes with the following special features:Exploring the Tree of Life - (29:56) Producers, cast and filmmakers talk about Terrence Malick's work but also creating something new and different in American cinema.  The making of the film, from casting, production,  set design and more.Theatrical Trailer - The original theatrical trailer for ""The Tree of Life"".EXTRAS:""The Tree of Life"" comes with a slip cover case.  The Blu-ray release comes with the DVD featuring a standard definition version of the film as well as a Digital Copy version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:""Tree of Life"" is a profound film in which is possibly the first film I would call a masterpiece knowing that so many people either loved or hated it.Filmmaker Terrence Malick has always known how to reach out and touch people through his films and those viewers also having multiple opinions.  But with the ""Tree of Life"", it's one of those films where film critics loved it, and when the masses went to watch it, immediately sites such as imDB and other blogs were filled with ""I don't get it"", ""a dull rehash of '2001'"" and of course alluding to the rave reviews at festivals to the boos at film festivals.Even actor Sean Penn wasn't sure what to make of the film as he told the French publication""Le Figaro"", ""I didn't at all find on the screen the emotion of the script, which is the most magnificent one that I've ever read. A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact. Frankly, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing there and what I was supposed to add in that context! What's more, Terry himself never managed to explain it to me clearly."" (note: translated in English courtesy of the New York Times)But I wonder if the busy Sean Penn is commenting about his actual role on set vs. his role in the film because for me,  it was quite easy to see where his role comes into the film.In fact, I'm quite intrigued to read the various comments from viewers because I often wonder, ""are we all watching the same film"" because each comment is so different.  Needless to say, it was a film that led to subjective comments and I'm sure Terence Malick is probably having his own laugh of how people are reacting to the film or possibly doesn't care.He's not the only filmmaker who has created films that went over people's heads.  Fritz Lang's 1927 film ""Metropolis"" didn't receive much fanfare, nor did F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" and the list goes on of films considered as a masterpiece today but was not appreciated during its time.But everyone has their own opinion of this film and for me, I absolutely loved ""Tree of Life"" and I have to say it was a film that resonated strongly within me.  It's story, its visual elements and even the voiceovers, the words spoken, I was truly touched by them.I was born and raised Catholic, similar to the character of Jack, I was raised with a nurturing mother, while my father was in the military and each time he was home, I grew up thinking it was one of the worst times of my life.  As he grew up from a strict upbringing, at the time, I couldn't understand how life was so miserable at times whenever he returned back home.Miserable in the fact that my mother allowed me to have fun with friends, my father did not.  My mother allowed us to have fun, my father did not.  He was an authoritarian and when we did wrong, we were punished, spanked and I could not understand why my life was like it was when he was around.  Interesting juxtaposition today, where I now have a closer relationship with my father as an adult.But as a child, burning inside me was these conflicted emotions to stand up to my father and his strict rules and those very emotions that we see with young Jack, I was very like him.  And with Mr. O'Brien, I find a lot of myself in him today, wondering about today's world, raising a children in this world and wanting my child to be prepared for this world.  I inherited my father's strictness, his hot temper but also having a nurturing side as my mother as well.  But I often worry that my son will have those feelings that I did as a child towards me. But I know that in life, parenting and the emotions that a child has eventually changes in time.  It's an evolving cycle of life in which people choose their own path, make their own right and wrong decisions.  It's life!And as for Mr. O'Brien and Mrs. O'Brien, I often see the parallels of my own family life and growing older, having seen loved ones, friends who have lost their own children.  Even with me and my wife, also having that dark moment of our lives of something that was not meant to be.This film is about life.  The pain of losing a loved one but knowing life goes on.  It's a long human life of love, pain, suffering...but we move on.  And for the CG elements incorporated into the film which many complained about, my feeling about the experimental use of the CG to show the creation of the world, the planet, the dinosaurs, the asteroid hitting the planet...this planet has seen its fair share of the death of life but also its fair share of the birth of life.Within our own family, we see life and death happen.  For our own demise or someone else's demise, we know it's coming... may it be natural causes or one's decision to live life recklessly, we know death is always around the corner.  We don't dwell on it but we try to make the best out of our lives, especially for our children.But sometimes, while life is good, we are thrown a curve ball.  We live, we move on...and for some, they forget.  But we hope as parents, our children learn from life's lessons, our lessons and hope they are prepared to move on, after our own demise.The conflicts of love, family and life is what embodies this film.  We feel it because we lived it.  Terrence Malick is able to capture it on film but not by traditional means.  Yes, it's a complex film but its a film that asks the question of which path do you take, of grace or nature.  Money or love?  God in your life, or no God in your life?And as for human life, in the context of this world alone...we know we had Dinosaurs before us, were obliterated during a catastrophic event on Earth but yet, life continued.  New life began, humans lived and possibly, we are causing our own catastrophe on our own planet or something else is bound to happen but still, life continues.  Whatever that life may be.I have to say that the casting on Terrence Malick films are typically spot-on and ""The Tree of Life"" is no different.  Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are absolutely wonderful in their role but the children selected for the film was perfect.  And to find out that it took two years to find the children for the film using 15 casting directors and searching all over Texas to get the right children, it goes to show how meticulous Malick is when it comes to the characters.  In fact, even Jessica Chastain had to undergo many auditions and interactions with Malick before she was hired as the mother.And of course, visually the film is a masterpiece.  There are so many shots that were planned and also unplanned (Malick would shoot the boys playing around at times they were not shooting to capture that natural element).  There is just so many wonderful things that lend to the film's efficacy.  Wonderful acting, its script but it's visual storytelling and its wonderful music is fantastic.As of this latest review, I have watched this film now five times, because I love it so much!  And while this film has garnered split reviews of those who loved it and disliked it, those who are able to appreciate it for its story, its beauty and its overall message can understand how Malick was once again able to create a masterpiece.  It's a fantastic film!While ""The Tree of Life"" may not come with a lot of special features, the Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic and you also get the DVD and Digital Copy version of the film.  I just feel it's one of those must-buy Blu-ray releases, especially for cineaste who are Malick fans!  This is a fantastic film!From the many shots and how vibrant this film looks via HD to the wonderful lossless and immersive 7.1 lossless soundtrack, especially the awesome music of Alexandre Desplat, just on its picture and audio quality, this film achieves 5-stars.  This is a wonderful Blu-ray release that Malick fans, cineaste especially videophiles and audiophiles can really appreciate!Overall, ""The Tree of Life"" is as a straightforward or as complex as one wants it to be.  In fact, I'm confident enough to say that ""The Tree of Life"" for me was more than just a film, it was an experience.And if one is able to accomplish that within a film, I know it's a masterpiece.  Thank you Terrence Malick!""The Tree of Life"" is highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: It may not be for everyone...but I found this film to be visually beautiful and cinematically deep!,1323993600,"12 16,

1392889,A3TKLTWVLB43XQ,B004A8ZX32,"DukeD1989 ""Film Buff""","[12, 17]","Terrence Malick's fifth feature is a mystifying and contemplative cinematic experience with a focus on the nature of good and evil, grace versus nature, god and his absence, love, grief, innocence, reconciliation and human existence all observed at times at a cosmic scale but mostly with intimate detail. Though far from containing a conventional narrative, the story within the enigmatic pondering of ""The Tree of Life"" revolves around Jack O'Brien, first seen as a wary middle aged man in modern times. He awakes one morning after he apparently dreams of his parents on the anniversary of the death of his brother who he loved deeply; a death that still troubles him. As he goes about his day working his corporate job the death of his sibling weighs heavily on him. Jack then begins, as he has probably done countless times before, to search for answers to that overburdening question `Why? Why do we die and what is the purpose of life'. Questions asked in hopes to better understand his loss and reconcile his grief.The search for the answer, which inevitably questions god's existence, starts where one tends to look for something, the beginning. We are quickly transported to the very first moments of the creation of the universe and travel forward through time to the formation of earth, the dawn of living organisms at a microscopic level and eventually complex life forms. Next we get to the real center of the story as we witness the birth and childhood of Jack. This entire story is observed through Jacks memories of living in a small town in Texas during the 50's. I believe it is very important to consider that these scenes are told through his memory and so contain a dreamlike and visceral atmosphere. We are not watching it play out as a narrative would in any other film; instead we get fragments of his childhood, each an individual memory strung together as they flow through Jack's mind. The fact that these are memories also helps in understanding the view of his parents and the way in which they represent the sides of grace and nature to such extremes; as in Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" one questions whether they are a true representation of the characters or just how Jack remembers them so many years later.Jessica Chastain plays `Mother', the way of grace, as a free spirited, caring and nurturing guide who teaches love, forgiveness and the enjoyment of life. The dueling force is nature, played incredibly well by Brad Pitt, as the disciplinarian father figure who runs his family with an iron fist in an attempt to instill toughness and a yearning for achieving greatness through any means. Together they reflect the inner workings of the cosmos and have a profound influence on Jack and at times he struggles to find a balance. As he grows he witnesses the harshness of the world around him, experiencing jealousy, lust, death and is often tempted by evil and sinful thoughts. At the same time however these struggles help him to grow and understand life and he comes to express a deep love and fondness for his family, especially his brother, though his mind still questions many things as it does for us all.As expected with any Malick film the events in Jack's life are not a direct depiction of reality, and Malick really doesn't care much about their outcomes or how the story unfolds in a literal sense; instead what matters is making the audience experience these events through the inner mind and consciousness of the characters. As with his other work he relies heavily on voice over narration to convey the intimate thoughts of these characters, but this time they seem to be speaking for us and not just for themselves. All of this is constructed within a very visual backdrop with breathtakingly beautiful imagery utilizing lights, shadows, sounds, CGI, nature and settings with such perfection only a true artist like Malick could achieve giving even the most simple images complex meaning.Together it is all truly poetry in motion and though it is a term I have used many times before it has never been more fitting. The entire film is unlike any other I have seen, one that will rattle your perspective on the world. Personally, the entire experience challenged me emotionally, mentally and spirituality; I'm not a religious man and I understand the examination of Christian values and Gods part in the story but the spiritualism at play I believe transcended religion or faith and although it looks to god for answers and at times tries to explain his actions, the thematic outcomes are open to so much interpretation that to claim you know the answer would undermine the films intentions. In the end there are no definitive answers; in the bigger picture of things we live but a small moment in time. One of the final scenes depicts what is seen to be `heaven' but not in a literal sense. God does not show his presence, and it isn't located among the clouds. One does not encounter angels and no answers are given to such complex questions like `Why are we here?"", instead there are only the ones we love as we remember them. Heaven is merely the place within our hearts where we cherish the memories of the past and it is in those memories and through those people we lived them with that we find a meaning and a reason to love and live. It is there where one finds true reconciliation, understanding and peace and by films end that is what Jack and the audience get. It is such a powerful and poignant culmination of everything that comes before it and one cannot help but be moved by it all.I should mention that Pitt's character genuinely believes that the world is a `survival of the fittest' sort of place, which plays a big part in his personality and how he treats his children. But at the same time he does want love and there is evidence of a level of grace within him, maybe because his father and mother represented the same sort of divide between grace and nature, instilling these sorts of things on him and though he tried to rejected certain aspects and struggled to find a balance like Jack his father's views were too strong and had the big impact on him. Now he is doing the same to his children whom I think at times he understands and possibly regrets but honestly thinks it is for the best. I think it does sort of show just how Pitt's character's parents had a similar effect on him (this struggle between toughness/love; mother vs./ father) which gets passed down throughout the generations, especially at that time in history when we tend to viewed father figures as disconnected and tough workers and mothers as simply caring nurturers.I do think it is his best performance. There is so much complexity; he isn't just this authoritarian father figure, though on the surface that is what we see. He strongly has a desire to make it in the world and do the best for his family, but the only way he knows how is to be aggressive and when that creates a divide or he doesn't succeed you can see the disappoint and you understand the pain it must bring to him so he becomes a very sympathetic character and Pitt plays him all too well, expressing so much pain and anger in his face and movements. I would love to see him nominated for this role.Jessica Chastain puts on just as wonderful of a performance playing the mother. This has a lot to be with her just being such a beautiful and elegant individual in real life and so was easily able to embody the character of `grace'. I must also mention Hunter McCracken who is just fantastic as Jack's childhood image. A young actor whose eyes seemed to express years of pain and deep thought, a rare thing.Overall ""The Tree of Life"" will undoubtedly divide the general film going audience. In the showing I attended I saw one couple walk out while at the same time as the final scenes began to play a woman in front of me was in tears. No one will be affected in the same way as others; those with no previous experience with Malick's work might find the whole thing pretentious, difficult to understand and hard to sit through which is very understandable. Those with a bit of patience and an open mind will bear witness to what might possibly be one of the most ambitious, beautiful and best films ever that will stick with you long after you leave the theater and will be discussed and analyzed for years to come.",5,True Cinematic Experience,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",2011,8336,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'fifth', 'feature', 'mystifying', 'contemplative',

1392890,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B004A8ZX32,dv_forever,"[15, 21]","It's not often one gets to encounter a well funded, high production film starring big name actors that is completely at odds with the normal expectations of mainstream filmmaking. That's because we're dealing with an artist here. I have seen all of Terence Malick's work over the years and in my opinion, ""Tree of Life"" is his best film since the magnificent ""Days of Heaven"". The latter film has had a permanent place in my own Top 10 for many years.""The Tree of Life"" is an altogether different experience but with all the stylistic hallmarks of this visionary director. Many moviegoers are disappointed by this film and that's mostly because of their pre-programmed Hollywood type expectations of what a movie should be like. A film requires a linear plot, a story that goes somewhere. A story with protagonists and antagonists all steadily building towards a resolution at the end. ""Tree of Life"" doesn't have any of this and the audience member who is unfamiliar with this director will be squirming in their seat and asking, ""When will something happen already?""The fact is that a lot happens in this film. A lot more than in most films that you'll see. The history of the universe, galaxies, clusters, exploding stars... the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth... all of this is juxtaposed with a peak into the life of a suburban family in Middle America circa the 1950s and the adult son of that family in our present day. As usual Malick picked some big movie stars to work with and although I am not much of a fan of Brad Pitt, let alone Sean Pean ( with all his annoying politics ), both actors are completely subsumed into the rhythm of the film and their personas fade away. Pitt really does seem like a 50s era American patriarch, ruling the house and raising up his three boys to be men. Sean Penn, who plays one of Pitt's sons as an adult, wanders through the film like a ghost amidst the glass and steel structures of a modern metropolis.There are many awe-inspiring sequences in the film. Some of my favorites are the creation-evolution sequence that goes on for like 15 minutes with the total absence of humanity. We even see dinosaurs and the C.G.I. work is pretty good, not Jurassic Park, but still effective. The shot of the dying sea creature on the beach is stunning. The use of classical composers by Malick is just as daring as in his last picture ""The New World"". In that movie, there was the sublime use of Wagner and Mozart that stood out. In ""Tree of Life"", we get a whole roll call of composers ranging from Bach, Brahms, Couperin, Mahler, Gorecki, Tavener, Berlioz, Smetana and many more. The Couperin piece was one of the most effective as the young children run around in the field and play. The emotions of childhood innocence and deep nostalgia are invoked. I was very moved throughout the film and the conclusion on the beach was quite extraordinary.There is the use of narration in the film as well, just like in all of Malick's work. This time our narrators ask questions about life, long for God, contemplate existence. Basically the kinds of things mainstream movies brush off as unexciting fluff and just focus on the next car chase, shoot out or explosion. If you have any appreciation of serious artistic work in the field of the movies, make sure not to miss this beautiful film. There aren't that many comparisons out there. Beyond Malick's own films, there is probably ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as a close relative but even that would be a faulty comparison because Malick's film is so humanistic and loving while ""2001"" is much colder and abstract.A week after seeing ""Tree of Life"", I went 180 degrees the other way and saw ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" in IMAX 3D. ( Hey, give me a break... I had a free pass. ) Transformers 3 is a fun, dumb summer spectacle full of razzle and dazzle. What a contrast to a spiritual, profound work like The Tree of Life.

1392891,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004A8ZX32,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","The intense craftsmanship of Terrence Malick's beatific 2011 film is what stays in the memory far more than his storytelling skills. It's the unique product of a reclusive filmmaker (Days of Heaven,The New World) who does not feel bound by traditional narrative structure or any proven Hollywood conventions beyond casting star actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in pivotal roles. Malick has clearly invested thought and care into every image of this film, but achieving a tangible level of clarity around characters and plot is not nearly as big a priority to him. If viewers are willing to overcome this hurdle - and this is quite a hurdle for many viewers including myself - then one can appreciate how his meticulous approach can seize upon the deeper emotions he is trying to convey in his time-traveling tale of spiritual replenishment. Malick presents two intertwining plot threads - one revolves around Jack O'Brien, a bereft middle-aged architect who appears to be searching for a deeper meaning to his younger brother's years-ago death, the other is a mid-century flashback to his childhood in Waco, Texas, where he is raised by a nurturing mother and a taskmaster father. The parents represent two seemingly irreconcilable ends of a philosophical spectrum with the mother following the path of grace and the father the way of nature. The tragedy of their son's death deepens the chasm that the grown Jack is still trying to rectify in his life.Once Malick presents the situation, this is where he stops to contemplate the origin of life and evolution. This extraordinary sequence begins with a pinkish-blue glow floating in space, which transitions into bubbles of primordial ooze, life-forming amoeba, and then jellyfish. This gives way to dinosaurs (with one contemplating the fate of another on a riverbank) and a school of circling hammerhead sharks, all ending with an asteroid impacting the earth. Somehow, Malick gets away with this piece of filmmaking brio and comes back to the more immediate family story because he can bring a level of universality to the emotional turmoil brought forth by the personal tragedy. However, his grand intentions also run roughshod over the characters whose motivations remain elliptical in the scheme of his story. Toward that end, the filmmaker makes liberal use of diminutive jump cuts, three-quarter profile shots of the characters, and fantasy images to carry his story along to the strains of majestic orchestral music (courtesy of Alexandre Desplat) to evoke the presence of a higher being in their lives. He comes back to the greater existence by showing the future of the planet five billion years in the future where the earth becomes a lifeless shell orbiting around a sun that has aged into a feeble white dwarf.When the story itself returns to the present day, Jack appears to be traversing the Southwest canyon country and magically ends up on a beach where he finds emotional closure. The cross-pollination of reality and fantasy into a cathartic state is something Malick does with greater aplomb than most filmmakers, and it helps that he gets a solid performance from Pitt who accurately captures the prideful sensibilities of a father from that period of history down to his frustrated dreams and his buzzcut. Jessica Chastain (The Help), 2011's ""It"" girl among critically lauded actresses, has less to do as the mother since she is given barely a word of dialogue, but she provides a memorably lingering impression of repressed feelings and maternal instincts. Penn is not given that much to do either except look pained during his journey of self-discovery. Special kudos need to be given to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men), who provides a vivid grandeur to all the startling visual elements no matter what eon needs to be captured by the idiosyncratic Malick. The filmmaker's hyper-sensitive attention to cinematic detail will definitely impress cineastes, but it will confound and try the patience of the more undemanding viewer. Granted there is a fair amount of pretension and self-absorption here, but one can't help but be awestruck by the end result.",4,Malick's Metier Is Life As We Don't Know It,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,4150,"['intense', 'craftsmanship', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'beatific', '2011', 'film', 'what', 'memory', 'far', 'more', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'unique', 'product', 'reclusive', 'filmmaker', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'New', 'World', 'who', 'not', 'feel', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'structure', 'proven', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'casting', 'star', 'actors', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'Malick', 'clearly', 'invested', 'thought', 'care', 'image', 'film', 'achieving', 'tangible', 'level', 'clarity', 'characters', 'plot', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'big', 'priority', 'viewers', 'are', 'willing', 'overcome', 'hurdle', 'quite', 'hurdle', 'many', 'viewers', 'including', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'meticulous', 'approach', 'can', 'seize', 'deeper', 'emotions', 'trying', 'convey', 'time-traveling', 'tale', 'spiritual', 'replenishment', 'Malick', 'presents', 'two', 'intertwining', 'plot', 'threads', 'one', 'Jack', ""O'Brien"", 'bereft', 'middle-aged', 'architect', 'who', 'be', 'searching', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'younger', 'brother', 'years-ago', 'death', 'other', 'mid-century', 'flashback', 'childhood', 'Waco', 'Texas', 'where', 'raised', 'nurturing', 'mother', 'taskmaster', 'father', 'parents', 'represent', 'two', 'seemingly', 'irreconcilable', 'ends', 'philosophical', 'spectrum', 'mother', 'following', 'path', 'grace', 'father', 'way', 'nature', 'tragedy', 'son', 'death', 'chasm', 'grown', 'Jack', 'still', 'trying', 'rectify', 'life.Once', 'Malick', 'situation', 'where', 'contemplate', 'origin', 'life', 'evolution', 'extraordinary', 'sequence', 'pinkish-blue', 'glow', 'floating', 'space', 'bubbles', 'primordial', 'ooze', 'life-forming', 'amoeba', 'then', 'jellyfish', 'way', 'dinosaurs', 'one', 'contemplating', 'fate', 'riverbank', 'school', 'circling', 'hammerhead', 'sharks', 'ending', 'asteroid', 'impacting', 'earth', 'Somehow', 'Malick', 'away', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'brio', 'back', 'more', 'immediate', 'family', 'story', 'can', 'bring', 'level', 'universality', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'brought', 'forth', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'However', 'grand', 'intentions', 'also', 'run', 'roughshod', 'characters', 'motivations', 'remain', 'elliptical', 'scheme', 'story', 'Toward', 'end', 'filmmaker', 'liberal', 'use', 'diminutive', 'jump', 'cuts', 'three-quarter', 'profile', 'shots', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'images', 'carry', 'story', 'strains', 'majestic', 'orchestral', 'music', 'courtesy', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'evoke', 'presence', 'higher', 'being', 'lives', 'back', 'greater', 'existence', 'showing', 'future', 'planet', 'five', 'billion', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'earth', 'lifeless', 'shell', 'orbiting', 'sun', 'aged', 'feeble', 'white', 'dwarf.When', 'story', 'present', 'day', 'Jack', 'be', 'traversing', 'Southwest', 'canyon', 'country', 'magically', 'up', 'beach', 'where', 'emotional', 'closure', 'cross-pollination', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'cathartic', 'state', 'something', 'Malick', 'greater', 'aplomb', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'solid', 'performance', 'Pitt', 'who', 'accurately', 'prideful', 'sensibilities', 'father', 'period', 'history', 'frustrated', 'dreams', 'buzzcut', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Help', '2011', 'girl', 'critically', 'lauded', 'actresses', 'less', 'do', 'mother', 'given', 'barely', 'word', 'dialogue', 'memorably', 'lingering', 'impression', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'Penn', 'not', 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'look', 'pained', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Special', 'kudos', 'need', 'be', 'given', 'cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', 'Children', 'Men', 'who', 'vivid', 'grandeur', 'startling', 'visual', 'elements', 'matter', 'what', 'needs', 'be', 'captured', 'idiosyncratic', 'Malick', 'filmmaker', 'hyper-sensitive', 'attention', 'cinematic', 'detail', 'will', 'definitely', 'impress', 'cineastes', 'will', 'confound', 'try', 'patience', 'more', 'undemanding', 'viewer', 'Granted', 'fair', 'amount', 'pretension', 'self-absorption', 'here', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'awestruck', 'end', 'result']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

1392893,A1MR4HA8LUGCQS,B004A8ZX32,Elizabeth Richards,"[2, 2]","This is much more than a &#34;movie&#34;, it is truly a work of art - Terence Malik is just amazing; his vision is expansive and out of the box.  Many people don't like this film and some, like my husband, did not like it the first time because he hadn't understood it.  I took him home, read him the reviews, took him back a second time the same day, and he loved it.  We saw it numerous times after that before now buying it.Many think it's about religion - it touches on religion and the connection between religion and god, but it is not, in my opinion, a religious movie.  Myself, I am very connected to things spiritual but do not go in for organized religion.  This movie actually made me feel some understanding of the Catholic religion, as the film begins with a simple theme that a woman learned as a little girl - there is nature and there is grace.  I believe this movie begins investigating how these two things fight each other, but winds up bringing them together.  After all, everything is one - this is physics as we now understand it.  Science can help you reach oneness easier than anything these days, and I feel that with the amazing Hubble shots of the universe Malik uses in this film help us &#34;feel&#34; the creation, the infinite, in a way beyond words.  I feel he accomplished that in this film!! That's how much I love it.Yes, there is little dialogue, but I'll tell you that Brad Pitt has never, ever been better while saying less.  He really embodies this man - he looks like Brad Pitt, but he walks like his character, sets his jaw like him, and emanates from his very being a man who loves his family but feels frustrated in his career.  You can feel this split in Pitt's acting - his character is abusive at times, but clearly loves them all.  That's good acting!  Jessica Chastain is gorgeously ethereal - her wife/mother is also struggling at times, wanting to understand god and her husband.  And when her character whispers &#34;forgive&#34; at one point, I cried with recognition.  We do not have to be doormats, but where there is love, it is worth fighting for.The long sequence of watching their three sons play is amazing in a very subtle way - I watched it with wonder and again, recognition.  I used to play like that.  I am from a time when we were let out early in the day and did not come home till dinner.  To watch this on a big screen is magical - just eavesdropping on these kids' play time!I recommend reading the actual reviews of the movie so you get a good idea of the basic premise of the film.  That won't be enough, because there are surprises and layers of the movie that are too much to go into.  But it will help.  Don't talk while watching it or you will miss a LOT.  Much of what is said is inner dialogue in the characters' own heads.  But it's intense!  Very soul searching - these people are trying to understand the meaning of life, god, why things happen.  That part of it is so human.  But Malik allows us to go beyond this to a place where we don't need to know &#34;why&#34;, we just kind of get it; to touch that part of us that is more than human, it is divine.",5,GREAT Work of Art,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,3136,"['much', 'more', '34', 'movie', '34', 'truly', 'work', 'art', 'Terence', 'Malik', 'just', 'amazing', 'vision', 'expansive', 'box', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'husband', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'understood', 'took', 'home', 'read', 'reviews', 'took', 'back', 'second', 'time', 'same', 'day', 'loved', 'saw', 'numerous', 'times', 'before', 'now', 'buying', 'it.Many', 'think', 'religion', 'religion', 'connection', 'religion', 'god', 'not', 'opinion', 'religious', 'movie', 'am', 'very', 'connected', 'things', 'spiritual', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'organized', 'religion', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'feel', 'understanding', 'Catholic', 'religion', 'film', 'simple', 'theme', 'woman', 'learned', 'little', 'girl', 'nature', 'grace', 'believe', 'movie', 'investigating', 'how', 'two', 'things', 'fight', 'other', 'up', 'bringing', 'together', 'everything', 'one', 'physics', 'now', 'understand', 'Science', 'can', 'help', 'reach', 'oneness', 'easier', 'anything', 'days', 'feel', 'amazing', 'Hubble', 'shots', 'universe', 'Malik', 'film', 'help', '34', 'feel', '34', 'creation', 'infinite', 'way', 'words', 'feel', 'accomplished', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'it.Yes', 'little', 'dialogue', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'never', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'saying', 'less', 'really', 'man', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'jaw', 'very', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'family', 'feels', 'frustrated', 'career', 'can', 'feel', 'split', 'Pitt', 'acting', 'character', 'abusive', 'times', 'clearly', 'good', 'acting', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'gorgeously', 'ethereal', 'wife/mother', 'also', 'struggling', 'times', 'wanting', 'understand', 'god', 'husband', 'when', 'character', 'whispers', '34', 'forgive', '34', 'one', 'point', 'cried', 'recognition', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'doormats', 'where', 'love', 'worth', 'fighting', 'for.The', 'long', 'sequence', 'watching', 'three', 'sons', 'play', 'amazing', 'very', 'subtle', 'way', 'watched', 'wonder', 'again', 'recognition', 'used', 'play', 'am', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'let', 'out', 'early', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'home', 'till', 'dinner', 'watch', 'big', 'screen', 'magical', 'just', 'eavesdropping', 'kids', 'play', 'time', 'recommend', 'reading', 'actual', 'reviews', 'movie', 'so', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'are', 'surprises', 'layers', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'will', 'help', 'Do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'watching', 'will', 'miss', 'LOT', 'Much', 'what', 'said', 'inner', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'own', 'heads', 'intense', 'Very', 'soul', 'searching', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'understand', 'meaning', 'life', 'god', 'why', 'things', 'happen', 'part', 'so', 'human', 'Malik', 'go', 'place', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', '34', 'why', '34', 'just', 'kind', 'get', 'touch', 'part', 'more', 'human', 'divine']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I was ready to give it a chance because it's gotten nominations for awards like the Golden Globes.This is what happened.Lots of shots of trees.  Yes, the trees are symbolic.  I learned this in junior high English.  And they're very majestic.  But I'd rather focus on the human characters and their problems.  Yes, I know the trees represent the characters, or cycle of life, but I'd still rather the people got more screen time.There is almost no dialogue.  Unfortunately, I'm the type of moviegoer who needs at least some dialogue between characters in order to figure out what's going on, what the characters' motivations are, etc.  There's lots of whispering voice-over, but that's not quite the same thing. At the beginning, it's clear that a family member has died, and the parents are grieving.  This is sad.  I felt bad for the parents.  Then the film suddenly turns into one of those films you'd see when you visit a nature museum.  (Perhaps it would have been better in 3D.) It's beautiful, but it just went on too long.Brad Pitt is a decent actor, who's gotten nominated for this movie, but the truth is that he doesn't do more than a) look incredibly sad, and b) whisper all his lines.

Or, as Malick puts it, time of nature and time of grace, with love as the equalizer.If we are to take apart Malick's film, there is a 3-part structure to it:  The 1st, which lasts until the mother receives the tragic news by mail, is that of the innocent period; The 2nd, until Jack's father admits being overwhelmed if not mistaken, and Jack the adult enters a door-frame into the desert, is a period of growing doubt and tension; The 3rd and final is the resolution.The viewer gets exposed to a long series of beautiful and almost always meaningful shots, while being prompted to an acute awareness to the intensity of the moment.  In addition, Malick's fan club is taken to a new level as expressed by the musical form of this work.  Music becomes another character, this film is music.  Take your time and understand that Malick offers nothing less than a wise perspective on becoming and being, tune yourself to the harmony of life.",5,"...this film is music, tune yourself to the harmony of life",1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1876,"['problematic', 'film', 'uncommitted', 'viewer', 'away', 'most', 'narrative-structure', 'known', 'big', 'film', 'one', 'perceptions', 'relationships', 'TIME', 'not', 'time', 'duration', 'hands', 'watch', 'move', 'round', 'So', 'way', 'most', 'subjective', 'enterprise', 'whereby', 'TIME', 'being', 'observed', 'times', 'are', 'recalled', 'being', 'lived', 'through.The', 'said', 'relationships', 'are', 'Jack', 'eldest', 'son', 'typical', 'post-WWII', 'American', 'family', 'parents', 'brothers', 'front', 'relation', 'be', 'one', 'Jack', 'father', 'attendant', 'relation', 'Jack', 'disappeared', 'younger', 'brother', 'Throughout', 'Jacks', 'discovers', 'builds', 'relation', 'big', 'OUTSIDE', 'one', 'senses', 'TIME', 'remembered', 'times', 'when', 'Jack', 'grew', 'up', 'father', 'authority', 'brothers', 'running', 'time', 'Jack', 'becoming', 'Malick', 'time', 'nature', 'time', 'grace', 'love', 'equalizer.If', 'are', 'take', 'apart', 'Malick', 'film', '3-part', 'structure', '1st', 'mother', 'tragic', 'news', 'mail', 'innocent', 'period', '2nd', 'Jack', 'father', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'not', 'mistaken', 'Jack', 'adult', 'door-frame', 'desert', 'period', 'growing', 'doubt', 'tension', '3rd', 'final', 'resolution.The', 'viewer', 'exposed', 'long', 'series', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'always', 'meaningful', 'shots', 'being', 'prompted', 'acute', 'awareness', 'intensity', 'moment', 'addition', 'Malick', 'fan', 'club', 'taken', 'new', 'level', 'expressed', 'musical', 'form', 'work', 'Music', 'character', 'film', 'music', 'Take', 'time', 'understand', 'Malick', 'nothing', 'less', 'wise', 'perspective', 'becoming', 'being', 'tune', 'harmony', 'life']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

What I'm going to attempt here is to explain my perception of what its underlying themes are.  It might mean something different to another person than it did to me, so if you're the sort of individual who cannot tolerate ambiguity, then I suggest you pass it and this review up.Having said that...Sometimes the best way to understand something is to contemplate its exact opposite, which is the meaning behind this review's title.  Fans of the 90s show ""Seinfeld"" probably remember that it has been summed up as as a show about nothing.  And that's a perfect summation of it.  There was no character development, no exploration of great themes, no overarching story.  It obeyed a rule set down by its creators, that it would have ""no huggin', no learnin'.""  It really was about nothing.This film, on the other hand, is about everything.  By that I mean that it touches on the dreams, hopes, fears, passions, emotions and thoughts that underlie everything we do and say.Why do we cheer a football team?  Because we want them to achieve greatness.  Why do we want them to achieve greatness?  So we can feel pride and exhilaration.  Why will their victory make us feel proud and exhilarated? Because by encouraging and supporting them we share a tiny piece of that victory.  Why do we want to share in their victory?  Because such an achievement is a validation of our worth.  Why do we want to have worth?  Because we want to want to be loved, respected, and cherished, and only things of worth are loved, respected and cherished.Why do we want to be loved, respected and cherished?  Because those things make us feel like part of a greater whole.  Why do we want to feel like we are part of a greater whole?Because at some deep, fundamental level we ARE part of something greater than our selves, but our individual journeys through life cloud this truth from our minds.  Thus we spend our lives trying to realize this union that we are all a part of but cannot see.Trace your own actions, desires, thoughts and goals, both good and bad, back to their roots, and you will find that they all end up at this same point. For example, why do criminals rob banks?  Because they want money.  Why do they want money?  So they can buy nice cars, jewelry and the company of beautiful women.  Why do they want nice cars, jewelry and the company of beautiful women?  So they can feel like they have worth...and we're back to where we were earlier: the desire to be part of a greater whole.We all want to get to that place.  The question is what path we will take to reach our goal: the way of nature or the way of grace.That is the choice presented to the characters in this film: which path to take.  In the end they find their ways to the thing they seek above all, union with everything.  This film chronicles that journey, and expands outward to show that their story is also the story of the entire universe.  Old souls pass through death and merge into everything.  New souls are born and begin the same journey.  The process goes on and on, forever.And, in my opinion, that is what this wonderful film is about.",5,It's not Seinfeld,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,3209,"['Disclaimer', 'let', 'tell', 'outset', 'film', 'impossible', 'fully', 'describe', 'words', 'What', ""'m"", 'going', 'attempt', 'here', 'explain', 'perception', 'what', 'underlying', 'themes', 'are', 'might', 'mean', 'something', 'different', 'person', 'did', 'so', ""'re"", 'sort', 'individual', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'ambiguity', 'then', 'suggest', 'pass', 'review', 'up.Having', 'said', 'Sometimes', 'best', 'way', 'understand', 'something', 'contemplate', 'exact', 'opposite', 'meaning', 'review', 'title', 'Fans', '90s', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'probably', 'remember', 'been', 'summed', 'up', 'show', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'summation', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'exploration', 'great', 'themes', 'overarching', 'story', 'obeyed', 'rule', 'set', 'down', 'creators', 'would', 'have', 'huggin', 'learnin', 'really', 'was', 'nothing.This', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'everything', 'mean', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'fears', 'passions', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'underlie', 'everything', 'do', 'say.Why', 'do', 'cheer', 'football', 'team', 'want', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'can', 'feel', 'pride', 'exhilaration', 'Why', 'will', 'victory', 'make', 'feel', 'proud', 'exhilarated', 'encouraging', 'supporting', 'share', 'tiny', 'piece', 'victory', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'share', 'victory', 'achievement', 'validation', 'worth', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'have', 'worth', 'want', 'want', 'be', 'loved', 'respected', 'cherished', 'only', 'things', 'worth', 'are', 'loved', 'respected', 'cherished.Why', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'loved', 'respected', 'cherished', 'things', 'make', 'feel', 'part', 'greater', 'whole', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'greater', 'whole', 'deep', 'fundamental', 'level', 'ARE', 'part', 'something', 'greater', 'selves', 'individual', 'journeys', 'life', 'cloud', 'truth', 'minds', 'Thus', 'spend', 'lives', 'trying', 'realize', 'union', 'are', 'part', 'can', 'not', 'see.Trace', 'own', 'actions', 'desires', 'thoughts', 'goals', 'good', 'bad', 'back', 'roots', 'will', 'find', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'point', 'example', 'why', 'do', 'criminals', 'rob', 'banks', 'want', 'money', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'nice', 'cars', 'jewelry', 'company', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'nice', 'cars', 'jewelry', 'company', 'beautiful', 'women', 'can', 'feel', 'have', 'worth', ""'re"", 'back', 'where', 'were', 'earlier', 'desire', 'be', 'part', 'greater', 'whole.We', 'want', 'get', 'place', 'question', 'what', 'path', 'will', 'take', 'reach', 'goal', 'way', 'nature', 'way', 'grace.That', 'choice', 'presented', 'characters', 'film', 'take', 'end', 'find', 'ways', 'thing', 'seek', 'union', 'everything', 'film', 'journey', 'outward', 'show', 'story', 'also', 'story', 'entire', 'universe', 'Old', 'souls', 'pass', 'death', 'merge', 'everything', 'New', 'souls', 'are', 'born', 'begin', 'same', 'journey', 'process', 'forever.And', 'opinion', 'what', 'wonderful', 'film', 'about']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

""~ Immanuel KantAnything which comes from Terence Malick is beautiful, sublime and profound. If any modern director's name can be mentioned in the same line as Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, and Stanley Kubrick - it has to be Malick. I've always admired and deeply respected him and made sure to see all his films which is not that difficult given that he has made only five having appeared to the movie lovers  once in five, ten,  or even in 20 years to present us with yet another masterpiece. Yes, that's true. Terrence Malick has only made five movies since 1973, the year of his stunning debut Badlands but his every film is a treasure. His last film The Tree of Life is his claim to cinematographic immortality. Has he succeeded? The opinions split completely starting with the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival (2011). The film was met with both boos and applauds. Then, it received the major Cannes award - the coveted Golden Palm - and once again it was booed and greeted at the time of announcement. These who love the film are struck with its scope, boldness and beauty but these who don't, scornfully dismiss it as the example of self-indulgent ponderous pseudo-art film. Looks like We all watch a different movie even if we sit at the same theater in front of the same screen where the great artist bares his soul and takes us to the incredible journey of self-discovery, finding the place for humanity, universe, and the Supreme Being on the map of existence. There are very few movies ever made that could compare with the latest creation by Terrence Malick, philosopher, humanist, visionary. What I saw was a masterpiece, equal in scope of its vision to (an inevitable comparison, I know, but appropriate) Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001. But while Odyssey stays always remote and cosmically dark and indifferent, Malick's film is filled with humanity and is as interested in the Universe evolution as it is in the short on the global scale and ordinary lives of one ordinary family in Waco, Texas, in the 1950-60s. That makes Tree of Live reminiscent of the other great film of past, Zerkalo (The Mirror)  by  Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky.The road to Tree of Life took over 30 years.  While working on Days of Heaven, Malick conceived the idea of the film that would explore the origins of life, and wrote the screenplay, Q (Quisida) but the attempt failed, and it was one of the reasons why Malik left the cinema for 20 years. Finally, the time has come for a long-awaited and very personal writer/director's creation. There are not many filmmakers who create the movies searching for answers to the eternal questions, ""Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?""There are perhaps just a handful of masters, who like Malik, are capable of capturing their thoughts in truly unforgettable meaningful images.  At the beginning of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" there is a wonderful phrase that seems perfectly relate to Malick's films:  "" The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.."" Such is the world in Malick's Tree of Life - many things there simply do not have the names yet.Malick's Vision is deep and poetic. It is compared with Tarkovsky's and Kubrick's; comparison which is more than deserved. The first two films coming to memory while watching Tree of Life, are Space Odyssey: 2001 and The Mirror. I found Tree of Life even more effective  than the Kubrick's film of because, being on the same monumental scale of the themes covered and of the same highest artistic merits, the  Malick's film is  endlessly and painfully human, which makes it much closer to me than eternal indifferent dark silence of the magnificent cosmological epic of Kubrick's cinema space.I've rarely been touched so profoundly with what was happening on the screen when I not just saw but, rather, lived through  new,  much more ambitious and grandiose (in all senses of the word) than anything he ever attempted and achieved, Malick's creation. I fully understand that this film may and will leave many viewers perplexed, frustrated, and cause a desire dismiss it or to mock it.  These voices addressing  God, and God answered Job,  the seemingly absent plot, action, and dialogue  - all of these  may cause a negative perception  as well as  film's constant moving to and from  different times and  dimensions. And yes, there is  a scene with the dinosaurs, whose appearance caused some shock on the part of viewers. I think that in the scheme of the universe, created by Malik, dinosaurs are just as important as all the other components, including us,  the living.Malick, known introvert and recluse,  is remarkably candid and open in the Tree of Life,  his most personal film. He reflects on the eternal and ancient as the universe itself matters and does not know the answers to them,  but he has the talent to embody the thoughts and reflections in the visions of superhuman beauty and deep love. He peers into the life of just one family whom he settled in the provincial town of his own childhood in Texas circa 1950s. But the story of this family in which the joy of innocence and discovery of the world,  dark whirlpools of growing up,  never-ending  struggle of  maternal and paternal origin in a child's soul,  conflicts, losses, regrets, finding  one's  way and awareness of the  place in the world, and, finally, an understanding f and forgiveness,  repeat closely  the stories  of millions  families at any place on earth. Maybe that's why  the story in the film became so  personal  to me.The beauty of the film is pure and sad. I think the viewers should immerse themselves in it, as in ocean water and allow it to wash over  them. Do not think, do not analyze, do not look for meaning in striking scenes of Cosmogony, but let them go through your soul.  I had to stop the movie several times, because watching  The Tree of Life is an overwhelming breathtaking sensual experience . It is filled with light, air, and open to all winds (notice the white light rippling curtain on the window in the  O'Brien house,  to which again and again returns  Emanuel  Lubezki `s camera). It is washed by with water - the source of life, a symbol of purification and dangerous, deceptive element . This film, like the titular tree, is firmly rooted in  Earth,  but directs  the branches and foliage to the sky, as if floating in the air. Maybe that's why the  levitation of redheaded Botticelli's Grace, re- incarnated in the beautiful Jessica Chastain feels so natural.Why did Lachrymose by Zbigniew Preisner accompany the birth of universe scenes? Why mourn, not Ode to Joy?  Does this mean that the death is already included in birth, and everything will come to an inevitable end - all living things and Time and Space?  Creating by the power of his talent, strikingly beautiful birth of the World scenes, finding for them the shades and nuances of colors that I have met only in one place on Earth - in Death Valley, Malick sees them as scenes of grief but expresses sorrow and wisdom in such perfect confluence of cinematic images and sounds that once entered into your soul, they will remain forever.I am sure that The Tree of Life is a film for multiple re-watches.  At different stages of a viewer's life, it might reveal parts of its mystery  but never to l the end. It is hard to recommend, but not to recommend it - simply impossible.  Is it perfect? I do not know. But it takes my breath away.",5,Where Do We Come From? What Are We?

Manino,"[5, 5]","[*One big spoiler*] Malick muses on the music of the spheres, the interplay of forces that created and sustain the universe, and on our place within it.  We see stunning visuals of the universe exploding into existence, of stars and galaxies forming, and of the earth accreting.  Life begins, dinosaurs roam, rule, and are summarily wiped out by a random asteroid.  Quotes from the Book of Job, echoed in a church service, refer to the mystery of why bad things happen while God does nothing to prevent them.  Although there are many theological references and a definite spiritual tone to the film, it could be that the natural forces of the universe are so vast, so unpredictable and so beyond our ability to control that a capricious God the Father is as good a way to conceptualize it as any other.  The dinosaurs didn't philosophize about the random asteroid that caused their destruction, and perhaps neither should we.Now we see the universe represented in microcosm by a family, ruled not by a god, but by a stern and sometimes capricious disciplinarian of a father.  (He demands the title, ""father,"" never ""dad."")  The eldest son can't seem to please him.  The father is emotionally distant.  Rules are set that are hard to follow, and harsh punishments are handed out for minor infractions.  The boy acts out, and is headed for delinquency, or worse.  He's jealous of his younger brother, whose musical bent and less rebellious nature attracts less unpleasant attention from the father.  But he loves and feels protective toward his younger sibling, and we get the sense that this relationship manages to get him through the trial of his upbringing, and helps him become a successful adult.We find out at the very start of the film that the younger brother has died, with the story above unfolding in a non-sequential flashback.  At the end, we see a metaphorical reunion of the living and the spirits of the dead on what is perhaps a literal view of the plutonian shore.  With the older brother and other family members (living? dead?) in attendance, the younger brother is consigned back to the universe.Disney called this sort of thing the Circle of Life.  But with Malick, it's more the Trajectory of Life.  Individually, we're born, we live, we mingle with and affect all the others around us, and then we die, returning to where we were before we were born.  There is a kind of consolation in the chaos, and in its relentless inevitability.  How on earth could someone turn metaphysics into a movie?  That's the reason you should see the Tree of Life.",5,Malick's Metaphysical Multiverse,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2567,"['[', '*One', 'big', 'spoiler*', ']', 'Malick', 'music', 'spheres', 'interplay', 'forces', 'created', 'sustain', 'universe', 'place', 'see', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'universe', 'exploding', 'existence', 'stars', 'galaxies', 'forming', 'earth', 'accreting', 'Life', 'roam', 'rule', 'are', 'summarily', 'wiped', 'out', 'random', 'asteroid', 'Book', 'Job', 'echoed', 'church', 'service', 'refer', 'mystery', 'why', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'God', 'nothing', 'prevent', 'are', 'many', 'theological', 'references', 'definite', 'spiritual', 'tone', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'natural', 'forces', 'universe', 'are', 'so', 'vast', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'so', 'ability', 'control', 'capricious', 'God', 'Father', 'as', 'good', 'way', 'conceptualize', 'other', 'dinosaurs', 'did', ""n't"", 'philosophize', 'random', 'asteroid', 'caused', 'destruction', 'perhaps', 'should', 'we.Now', 'see', 'universe', 'represented', 'microcosm', 'family', 'ruled', 'not', 'god', 'stern', 'sometimes', 'capricious', 'disciplinarian', 'father', 'title', 'father', 'never', 'dad', 'eldest', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'please', 'father', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'Rules', 'are', 'set', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'harsh', 'punishments', 'are', 'handed', 'out', 'minor', 'infractions', 'boy', 'out', 'headed', 'delinquency', 'worse', 'jealous', 'younger', 'brother', 'musical', 'bent', 'less', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'less', 'unpleasant', 'attention', 'father', 'feels', 'protective', 'younger', 'sibling', 'get', 'sense', 'relationship', 'get', 'trial', 'upbringing', 'become', 'successful', 'adult.We', 'find', 'out', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'younger', 'brother', 'died', 'story', 'unfolding', 'non-sequential', 'flashback', 'end', 'see', 'metaphorical', 'reunion', 'living', 'spirits', 'dead', 'what', 'perhaps', 'literal', 'view', 'plutonian', 'shore', 'older', 'brother', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'living', 'dead', 'attendance', 'younger', 'brother', 'consigned', 'back', 'universe.Disney', 'called', 'sort', 'thing', 'Circle', 'Life', 'Malick', 'more', 'Trajectory', 'Life', 'Individually', ""'re"", 'born', 'live', 'mingle', 'affect', 'others', 'then', 'die', 'returning', 'where', 'were', 'were', 'born', 'kind', 'consolation', 'chaos', 'relentless', 'inevitability', 'How', 'earth', 'could', 'someone', 'turn', 'metaphysics', 'movie', 'reason', 'should', 'see', 'Tree', 'Life']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

When I saw that film I simply fell into it, fell into the experience as I watched it and loved it and often return to it. There was no narrative flow to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I hate to even call that film an experience. It was set some time in the future in space and there were simply images, sights and sounds. I never forgot those. THE TREE OF LIFE seems very similar in some respects. It seems to attract one on different levels of consciousness, existence or remembrance.

1392905,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004A8ZX32,Grady Harp,"[180, 202]","THE TREE OF LIFE is not the usual film - a story that begins, develops, and ends. Yes there is a story here: in a small town (Smithville, Texas) lives a family - a stern, painfully frustrated artist/man who can't seem to succeed in anything for long except raising three boys with his rather quiet passive wife.  One of the boys dies and the remaining family enters into a realm of questioning life, both at the time of the death of the child and years later through the experiences of the oldest boy reflecting on the meaning of life, his response to his father, his sense of continuing loss.  The setting is in the 1950s - that structureless decade following the horrors of WW II, the unleashing of the atomic bomb, the difficulties of making a living and sacrificing dreams for a reality in a way that changes the way individuals interact not only with outsiders but also with the family unit whose only seeming hope of meaning is relying on religious protocol. Yet even religion seems to fail when the inexplicable tragedy of an innocent child's death changes everything. The journey of the film is the maturing of the eldest son as he grows into a man forever challenged by the meaningless of the loss of his brother and the effect that has on his own maturation.The power of the film is in the visual and auditory miracles that unfold on the screen.  Writer/director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line, etc) has gathered images from nature  - incredible rock formations, waterfalls, volcanic eruptions, floating jellyfish, night skies, and light in all its forms, among many others - and allows these images to seep into our minds accompanied by the music of John Tavener, Gustav Mahler, Aresnije Jovanovic, Zbigniew Preiser, Hector Berlioz, Gustav Holst, Bedrich Smetana, Ottorino Respighi, Johannes Brahms, Francois Couperin, Johan Sebastian Bach, Henryk G&oacute;recki, Robert Schumann, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - each work so carefully chosen that the visuals are liberated from the screen to enter our minds.  It is that rare opportunity to watch creation, death, life, and the majesty of nature - none of which is understandable - and that is where the comfort source of this film touches us.The cast is committed and allows the story to enter our heads untainted; Brad Pitt is the father, Jessica Chastain is the mother, young Jack is Hunter McCracken who ages into Sean Penn, Fiona Shaw is the grandmother, and the other boys are played by Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan.  But the real star of this glowing work of art is Terrence Malick.  This film is a masterpiece of cinematic art.  It needs to be seen and experienced.

1392906,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B004A8ZX32,"Greg ""Saganite""","[16, 22]","I'm no stranger to hating something that everyone, especially critics, informs me that I should love.  Take, for example, my review ofGran Torino.  I thought it was just awful, but I recently saw it appear on a critic's list of ""best movies ever made.""  So I am sympathetic--to some small degree--with the people who gave ""Tree of Life"" one star and then panned the hell out of it.You do have to go in knowing what to expect.  This is not traditional story-telling.  Not by a long shot.  It is dream-like, impressionistic, metaphorical, non-linear.  In less skilled hands it would be nothing short of a mess.But as it stands, this is the most astonishing piece of filmmaking I've ever encountered.  From the performances of the young actors to one-of-a-kind visuals and soundscapes, this is art that can only be film.  The story in ""Drive,"" another great movie, or ""Moneyball,"" ANOTHER great movie--can and were communicated in books.  They could have been done on the radio.  ""Tree of Life"" can only be film.  What it conveys depends on well-chosen images, sounds, performances, and juxtapositions.  It is a masterclass in using the specific virtues of film to convey feelings and provoke thoughts.That is not to say that I didn't grow impatient with ""Tree"" sometimes, or that I don't think I might have been a little happier understanding more of what the intent of certain things was.  And as a person with no supernatural beliefs, I was annoyed by some of the vague, New Age ""spirituality"" toward the ending (though I appreciated the boldness represented by some of the questions asked of God).But do I think it was pretentious or self-indulgent?  Not really.  It was a particular vision that touched on big issues using unique methods from a singular perspective.  To a large degree, that describes all great art.  If something like ""Tree"" is criticized, as it is by many of the one-star-givers for being too artsy and dull, the suggestion would seem to be that we give up on art altogether and focus exclusively on entertainment.  I love entertainment.  But I don't think a couple of hours of mild confusion and the need for rapt concentration is too much to give for a rich and provocative experience.I confess that when I first started reading the one-star reviews, I wanted to dismiss all of them as having been written by Philistines and low-brow dimwits.  That's not fair.  Even among those who fancy themselves artsy, intellectual elites, ""Tree"" might land with a thud.  It's not for everyone.  But if you love cinema--not just a good story told on film, but the medium itself--and you love wrestling with existential and metaphysical questions, and you can appreciate great performances that don't necessarily add up to a traditional, linear narrative...don't be frightened off.It's fine if you do end up hating it.  I promise I've gotten over myself and won't judge you.  I just think that a lot of the people who might turn away because of the almost even number of glowing and glowering reviews might be missing out on something that might have amazed and enriched them.",5,"Yes, you have to be patient and open.

I watched the trailer for this film, thinking that it would be a good character study movie.  WRONG!  It was some abstract, modern art, poetry mumble jumble that was absolutely boring and disjointed at best.  I want my money back!  I love movies and I enjoy a really well written story.  There was no story, no plot, or anything.  It was like following someone's thoughts with landscapes and music.  I even hated the way it was filmed.

Because of that, it is quite emotionally fraught and tension filled where the film technique exaggerates and distorts in ways familiar to the descendants of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, so that an attic room is a very narrow, forty foot high dark brown chamber with a small window at one end; the mother is filmed as an ethereal angel like figure, the father, a stiff, thick-lipped jaw-jutting fascist - a point of view familiar to almost all boys, and to Greek dramatists, Freudians etc. It reminds me that the great Huckleberry Finn is also a point of view work, where great truths are revealed through the eyes of a young boy.  The film is bookmarked by images of the natural world and highlights a reminder of our insignificant part in it. If it is the case that the world through the eyes of a boy, and his memory of it, are distorted by powerful feelings of love, shame, wonder, jealousy, guilt, fear, then Mr Mallick has managed to make a remarkable and powerful portrait of the world of post WW2 suburban America as one (universal) boy experienced it and a sobering reminder that our worlds are much more defined by our feelings than by any objective evidence. It is also a reminder of how close our dreams are to film. Brad Pitt plays the father and was one of the producers. Interesting to observe this actor grow and evolve.

1392917,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B004A8ZX32,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[7, 12]","It's a film about love and nothing else except its succeeding and failing through and beyond death. The eighteen year old eldest son of this family dies and the film is the full description of the process of mourning for the father and the mother of that child who had two other brothers and these son's mourning is intertwined into that of their parents. That explains the practically uncontrollable expression of pain and suffering of the beginning and the rather tamed final scene of that mourning after or around the burial of the son or brother.The mourning process is psychologically traumatic to the two parents and sends them back into the past. Since the son died then this death's concatenation with what we know of how he lived explains, justifies or caused this death. They start from the beginning, from their own encounter, and then all the important events in the family, for the parents and for the children will punctuate what happens on the screen. The point is that the whole film is a collage and that makes it difficult to follow but fascinating to the eyes.Difficult to follow because actually fully acted scenes with a fully developed dialogue are rare and short. Most of the film is the evocation of events in purely visual scenes and special effects. Passion, birth, that enormous trauma for the parents and the child is systematically evoked by volcano eruptions, lava flowing, incandescent pictures over-invading the screen.Those scenes are meaningful because of the linear and transitive line of the visual show. It would be a mistake to identify one of these visual effects as having a clear meaning. It is never the case and the volcanic eruption comes several times, each time carrying the memory of the previous time and enriching the new instance with its clustered circumstantial new meaning.Three sons in one family make the Oedipian complex of one of them, in that case the one who will die at eighteen, the eldest son, difficult to assume and negotiate. The father wants to literally possess his eldest son and he wants his wife to reject this son, in order to reinforce the father's takeover. It does not work because the father does not understand the attachment to the mother is natural and the inspiration from the father has to be based not on the rejection of the mother but on the project the son may have for himself.A severe economic crisis in the family will naturally build tremendous frustrations and thus will support a never clearly said vision that the death of the eldest son was the result of his suicide death instinct rooted in the deep resentment of the extreme and even excessive authority of the castrating father.But the film is a great film because the plot could be made explicit and detailed in one page, whereas in this film most of it is the expression if not telling of that plot along two visual lines. On one hand the parallel between the visual effects on the screen and the story of the film. On the other side the architecture of the visual medium, effects, scenes. Then it becomes the plot of the visual effects, how they progress and build a beginning, a middle and an end.We have to feel that plot, that depth, that drama in the mourning with our eyes and ears but not with our brain or linguistic capability. This film is thus the acme of cinematographic art since it mainly speaks to us through its visual and auditory , if not only sonorous, mediatic dimensions.That cinema is a universal language and the words, the few words, are no longer important, except in their tones, in their musical dimension.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,A miracle of mourning beauty,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3601,"['film', 'love', 'nothing', 'else', 'succeeding', 'failing', 'death', 'eighteen', 'year', 'old', 'eldest', 'son', 'family', 'film', 'full', 'description', 'process', 'mourning', 'father', 'mother', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'two', 'other', 'brothers', 'son', 'mourning', 'intertwined', 'parents', 'practically', 'uncontrollable', 'expression', 'pain', 'suffering', 'beginning', 'rather', 'tamed', 'final', 'scene', 'mourning', 'burial', 'son', 'brother.The', 'mourning', 'process', 'psychologically', 'traumatic', 'two', 'parents', 'back', 'past', 'son', 'died', 'then', 'death', 'concatenation', 'what', 'know', 'how', 'lived', 'explains', 'justifies', 'caused', 'death', 'start', 'beginning', 'own', 'encounter', 'then', 'important', 'events', 'family', 'parents', 'children', 'will', 'punctuate', 'what', 'screen', 'point', 'whole', 'film', 'collage', 'difficult', 'follow', 'fascinating', 'eyes.Difficult', 'follow', 'actually', 'fully', 'acted', 'scenes', 'fully', 'developed', 'dialogue', 'are', 'rare', 'short', 'Most', 'film', 'evocation', 'events', 'purely', 'visual', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'Passion', 'birth', 'enormous', 'trauma', 'parents', 'child', 'systematically', 'evoked', 'volcano', 'eruptions', 'lava', 'flowing', 'incandescent', 'pictures', 'over-invading', 'screen.Those', 'scenes', 'are', 'meaningful', 'linear', 'transitive', 'line', 'visual', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'identify', 'one', 'visual', 'effects', 'having', 'clear', 'meaning', 'never', 'case', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'carrying', 'memory', 'previous', 'time', 'enriching', 'new', 'instance', 'clustered', 'circumstantial', 'new', 'meaning.Three', 'sons', 'one', 'family', 'make', 'Oedipian', 'complex', 'one', 'case', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'eighteen', 'eldest', 'son', 'difficult', 'assume', 'negotiate', 'father', 'literally', 'possess', 'eldest', 'son', 'wife', 'reject', 'son', 'order', 'reinforce', 'father', 'takeover', 'not', 'work', 'father', 'not', 'understand', 'attachment', 'mother', 'natural', 'inspiration', 'father', 'be', 'based', 'not', 'rejection', 'mother', 'project', 'son', 'may', 'have', 'himself.A', 'severe', 'economic', 'crisis', 'family', 'will', 'naturally', 'build', 'tremendous', 'frustrations', 'thus', 'will', 'support', 'never', 'clearly', 'said', 'vision', 'death', 'eldest', 'son', 'was', 'result', 'suicide', 'death', 'instinct', 'rooted', 'deep', 'resentment', 'extreme', 'even', 'excessive', 'authority', 'castrating', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'plot', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'explicit', 'detailed', 'one', 'page', 'whereas', 'film', 'most', 'expression', 'not', 'telling', 'plot', 'two', 'visual', 'lines', 'one', 'hand', 'parallel', 'visual', 'effects', 'screen', 'story', 'film', 'other', 'side', 'architecture', 'visual', 'medium', 'effects', 'scenes', 'Then', 'plot', 'visual', 'effects', 'how', 'progress', 'build', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end.We', 'have', 'feel', 'plot', 'drama', 'mourning', 'eyes', 'ears', 'not', 'brain', 'linguistic', 'capability', 'film', 'thus', 'acme', 'cinematographic', 'art', 'mainly', 'visual', 'auditory', 'not', 'only', 'sonorous', 'mediatic', 'dimensions.That', 'cinema', 'universal', 'language', 'words', 'few', 'words', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'important', 'tones', 'musical', 'dimension.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I think he takes the artform to another plane; they are not just movies, they are visual, epic poems. There is absolutely no question when you are watching ""Tree of Life"" you are watching a Malick film.But I must also confess that his films are demanding. They're like reading Melville or Joyce. Or listening to Mahler. You have to experience them more than once to appreciate all the subtlety and apparent meaning. And you have to be paying attention. ""Tree of Life"" is no exception. For instance, it is not clear, until the end, which son is the narrator, making the movie a mystery in the tradition ofCitizen Kane (70th Anniversary)orFight Club. The narrative is non-linear, and the editing feels, at first, random and jarring, until you get into the unique time-space that marks a Malick universe. And the relationship of Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, as husband and wife, is also ambiguous and at times frighteningly tense, as a child's perception of his own parents' marriage often is. All of this requires getting used to. And more than one viewing.For any man with a father, ""Tree of Life"" is a strongly affecting movie. I found it hard to watch without choking up.

Oh yeah. Did I mention that there are dinosaurs here too? After about 15 or 20 minutes of floating plotlessly through space or time or the freakin' cosmos or whatever the heck it was, I turned it off.

1392929,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004A8ZX32,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 6]","With Mixed Results.***This review may contain spoilers**Finally finding the leisure time and inclination, I watched ""The Tree of Life"" (hereafter ToL) on HBO on Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 9:40 a.m.  At the end, I concluded that if you 1) like going to church, 2) like thinking about the movies you watch and/or 3) don't mind following a convoluted non-linear plot, then ""Tol"" should satisfy you.  If you don't like doing any of the aforementioned things, then ""ToL"" will probably be a boring slog.I agree with the posters who advise viewers to watch ""ToL"" with a calm, contemplative attitude, because ""Tol"" indeed is not your conventional fun time at the movies.  The director Terrence Malick recklessly and audaciously is swinging for the spiritual fences and is daring to ask the Big Questions about morality, God's justice (or lack thereof), man's relationship to God, why even good people suffer, all that deep stuff.  However, Malick collides with the inherent, unavoidable problem any director challenging the infinite has: his literal, visual interpretation of God's mind is necessarily, pretentiously inadequate.  I am referring to the admittedly spectacular biological, psychological, paleontological, and cosmic images wafting through ""ToL"".  The quiet images, by themselves, announce to those who are receptive that, yeah, God is great and majestic.  No real problem there, even if time-worn, if Malick had left it at that and created a balanced version of ""Koyaanisqatsi"", the 80's film that used human images to illustrate life's chaos.However, Malick artificially grafts this ""divine imagery"" to an earthy, earthly tale of the chronological history of a `50s Texas family headed by a somewhat disciplinarian, occupationally frustrated father (Brad Pitt) and gentle, compassionate mother (Jessica Chastain).  Respectively, they personify the perennial nature vs. nurture conflict (I prefer the word ""nurture"" to the vague term ""grace"").  Knowing them only by their last names Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien solidifies their symbolic status.  The true conflict revolves around the festering rivalry between the father and his oldest son Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as an adult).  The languid, usually silent, and twisty progression of the family's life, beginning toward the end when it receives a telegram informing them of the death of, I assume, the second oldest brother as a (I think) Vietnam soldier, and the events that test their mettle and their faith, is also compelling, again by itself.But when ""ToL"" attempts to meld these two tropes, the mundane and the ethereal, I'm afraid it dilutes the power of both tropes.  I think I see the movie's purpose here; to show that God transcends mere earthly affairs and that the power of caring, of love, of nurture will quash the woes and cares of brute animal nature and will bring us peace, at least in the afterworld.  Again, it's a noble purpose that few movies dare touch.  But, you know, the result comes across as preachy and simplistic and as platitudinous as the well-meaning but hackneyed words of comfort the Grandmother (Fiona Shaw) gives Mrs. O'Brien after she gets that telegram.If Malick had exclusively taken the ""2001/Koyaanisqatsi"" route or ""Great Santini"" route, personally I would have more impressed.  By combining them in ""ToL"" it makes the effort seem a little self-conscious and forced.  Lovely and stunning as the ""cosmic"" images were, I would have excised them and kept the remaining family structure, even the dreamy, stream-of-consciousness elements intact.  That way, we could see the O'Brien family legitimately wrestle with their psychosocial and spiritual dilemmas (especially Jack's concern that he is emulating the less admirable aspects of his father's character) and arrive (or not arrive) at a resolution.  Frankly, the cosmic images are, I think, a tad artistically dishonest, because we the audience can witness them and perhaps take solace from them, while the mundane O'Briens cannot.  Too dues ex machina for my taste.Therefore, my verdict on ""ToL"" is ambiguous.  I aesthetically appreciated Malick's attempt at apotheosis, to remind us that love is the path to God.  But my intellect recoiled at the clich&eacute;d imagery ""ToL"" resorted to in order to demonstrate this, even if the movie had to.  But I can just envision posters telling me, ""Don't think about the movie too much, just feel it.""  I suppose.  If you just let ""ToL""s flow bear you along, it may make you feel better.  Very well - 3.5 stars out of 5.P.S.: Two trivial points - first, the plesiosaur depicted in the movie could never had curled its neck backwards the way it did.  Fossil studies show it lacked that flexibility.  Second, the raptor shown later in the movie probably spared the prostrate hadrosaur not because it was merciful, but because it was not hungry.",3,"Spiritually Ambitious ""Tree of Life"" Attempts to

It appears to me from seeing many reviews that people are VERY divided on whether they love or hate it, and I think perhaps it has to do with relevance to many people and their experiences in life.  In my interpretation of it, it was not so much just an existential question surrounded by moments of artistic visual and audio trances as much as: 1.  Here is the universe and here is earth; 2. Here is one family on earth; 3. Here is their story, dysfunctional with bouts of love and pain; intertwined with nature; 4. Here is their peace through forgiveness, perhaps in some sort of heaven.  The movie seems as though it is one part nature and history documentary, one part sociology study, one part psychology study, and one part musical (without singing).  It's like ""The Squid & The Whale"" meets the documentary ""Life"" and then takes components from ""Baraka"" and blends together.  Ultimately though as they say in the bonus feature, it's very difficult to pinpoint describe the movie.I originally impulse-bought The Tree of Life, watched it, was frankly so troubled by where it brought me back to emotionally that I gave it away, and have since bought it again to experience it again.  Having come from a strict childhood with very strict rules, it was extremely unnerving to me the first time I watched this, it felt like I was watching at times an autobiographical movie on my family.  Director Terrence Malick and particularly Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain in their roles NAIL some of the very minute nuances that families experience with a parent who is overly-strict at times, making everyone walk on eggshells.  There were times I found that to my amazement, as a guy in his 30's, there were tears coming down from my eyes.  Such moments were very difficult to watch, with the family dynamics portrayed in the movie.And ultimately the movie had an ending of forgiveness, which is what haunted me the first time watching it.  I love my parents, both in my own way, but seeing how the movie ended was confusing to me and something I have pondered a bit, just because of my own past experiences.The movie seems like a very personal one to Malick.  It is not a traditional movie and it is a very unusual cinematic journey, but I feel like the bad reaction to this movie is overblown, with people who don't like it assuming it is a BAD movie because they don't like it.  Perhaps it is more that The Tree of Life does not appeal to such people because they did not have experiences in their life in which they could relate to it, which doesn't mean I think they are not entitled to their opinions if that is the case.With the movie ""trance""-type scenes, it blows you away with the operatic music and visuals.  Malick does seem like a poet, someone who fuses different senses with a cinematic experience.  You are transported to the world he is showing, into the tale he is telling, and however it affects you, if you just `be,' if you just `are' with it, it is quite an intense experience.You get the strong snapshots of memories and then present day.  Of happy children playing during the summer and then a man trapped in his job, imprisoned by walls he bumps into as he says, where he has lost his connection to nature by being so trapped.  The movie includes such portions that do make you question your job if you may have one where you yearn for the ocean or trees but feel stuck in an 8-to-5er.  The movie fuses emotions with nature often and well.You do get the voice overs and then music with vast 'universescapes,' where questions of faith are presented, with perhaps the universe as the backdrop showing our world and life's place amongst an eternity.  A cosmic explosion occurs, then a ""mere"" volcano on earth erupts with a vast landscape.  Scenes, visions of earth, caves, waterfalls, streams, cells, jellyfish, life growing, from green plants to dinosaurs proceed to transfix your mind and imagination.  Perhaps this is intended to show perspective, maybe connectivity, maybe both.  I don't know, but it works is what I do know.  An amazing flow of life.You get the feeling there is not a single sound or visual that isn't entirely meant to be there, from the footsteps on a floor to the birds outside.  From a quiet backdrop of music to the pounding voices of singing that sound almost as if from angels.  From the sun through the trees to a massive flow of a waterfall.  With the definite fusion of faith and nature, you get the sense if Malick could he would encourage you to be outside when watching this to also be able to smell the natural air, to touch and feel blades of grass or bark of a tree, to even taste something from the settings he creates, all so you can be fully encompassed, fully present into the experience.  Not too many movies have I seen where I felt that.Bottom-line: I thought it was a very poetic, beautiful, sad, and ultimately hopeful journey of a movie, and well-worth watching at least once to make sure you like it before buying.",5,"Very Poetic, Beautiful, Sad, and Ultimately Hopeful Movie With Amazing Portrayal of Family Dynamics",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,5059,"['Tree', 'Life', 'amazing',

I just wanted to warn you: yes, you're getting an Art film here, with a capital A.Many of the individual sequences of the film are involving, well acted, and- in the case of the ""creation of the universe and all life on earth"" sequence- quite spectacular. But some may find the lack of a traditional story, and the way the disparate parts of the movie don't demonstrate obvious connections with one another, a little frustrating.Myself, I admired more than enjoyed ""The Tree of Life"", and have no real desire to watch it again anytime soon. But I'm glad that movies like this can still get made, even if I found this particular movie to be a little dull at times. Anyway, maybe next year I'll check out the film again, after its images and juxtapositions have been percolating in my brain for a while, and see if I have any new impressions.And, yeah, I already have some ideas about how the creation of the universe stuff ties into the scenes of Brad Pitt yelling at his kids in his backyard, but in the end they're just my ideas.

1392935,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004A8ZX32,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 8]","The Tree of Life, the latest film by Terrence Malick, won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like that film, it has received polarized reviews from critics and like Malick's previous work it pushes the boundaries of cinema and is not immediately accessible. It's a film that requires you to think, to analyze, and to discuss; it's not a film that you can sit back and watch at any time. In telling the story of one family, Malick takes his film all the way back to the creation of the universe with the Big Bang. This is not a film without ideas and ambition. The Tree of Life does not intend to entertain, but rather to evoke. It's an existential work that's pacing and scope resembles 2001 to such an extent Malick could have titled it ""2011: An Earth Odyssey.""Lacking a linear plot, there is no description of the plot that I can provide without giving you a false idea of what the film is about. What little I can say is that the film illustrates the childhood memories of Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn), including his memories of his strict father (Brad Pitt) and his passive mother (Jessica Chastain, whom I find bears a striking resemblance to the Swedish actress Liv Ullman). Throughout the film, as you'd expect if you've seen any of Malick's previous work, several characters deliver whispered voice-overs that ask questions about God, faith, life, death, loss and time.While the dialogue poses some important questions about the themes explored, it's probably the most irrelevant part of the film as Malick and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski emphasize images over words. Malick is one of the great visual filmmakers and he uses images so beautifully that this film is almost entertaining based on the beauty of the images alone. Whether you love or hate this film you can't deny the beauty of it. Malick's eye, the cinematography, and Jack Fisk's production design make this film a wonder to behold. There are some incredible shots of nature throughout and even shots that simply feature Penn wandering through a vast wasteland are haunting and startling in their impact.There are many special effects (yes, including dinosaurs) and even these are fascinating and beautiful, which can also be attributed to Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, operatic score. As many of them have stayed with me long after the credits rolled, I can't rave enough about the images that drive this movie. As a dream-life evocation of childhood, this film succeeds on a remarkably existential, and perhaps even esoteric, level. The final thirty minutes are some of the most beautiful and moving images I've seen on film, but I can't say that I think The Tree of Life is a perfect film nor can I ignore how indulgent much of it is.It's a film built on images and it's been written that Malick will reject shots without an artistic aesthetic, but these shots do grow repetitious at times. The pacing will trouble many and I admit that the film felt much longer than it was, but that's not to say I was bored by it. While some will be drawn in by the beauty of it, others will be alienated by the slow pacing and the overindulgence. Know this; The Tree of Life is less of a film than an experience and it is best seen on the big screen.While imperfect, The Tree of Life is a rather profound cinematic tapestry that doesn't spoon-feed its themes to you and instead allows you to interpret them how you wish and come to your own conclusions. It does evoke emotion in such a way that I've already found it growing in stature in my mind and wish to see it again as soon as possible. It begs to be seen more than once as it gives you so much to take in and to consider that a single viewing can't possibly do it justice. It's a pretentious film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and I highly recommend it for the curious viewer.GRADE: A-",5,"A Beautiful, Indulgent Experience",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,3971,"['Tree', 'Life', 'latest', 'film', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'won', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", '2011', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'been', 'compared', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'film', 'received', 'polarized', 'reviews', 'critics', 'Malick', 'previous', 'work', 'boundaries', 'cinema', 'not', 'immediately', 'accessible', 'film', 'think', 'analyze', 'discuss', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'Malick', 'film', 'way', 'back', 'creation', 'universe', 'Big', 'Bang', 'not', 'film', 'ideas', 'ambition', 'Tree', 'Life', 'not', 'intend', 'entertain', 'rather', 'evoke', 'existential', 'work', 'pacing', 'scope', 'resembles', '2001', 'extent', 'Malick', 'could', 'have', 'titled', '2011', 'Earth', 'Odyssey', 'Lacking', 'linear', 'plot', 'description', 'plot', 'can', 'provide', 'giving', 'false', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'What', 'little', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Jack', 'played', 'adult', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'including', 'memories', 'strict', 'father', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'passive', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'whom', 'find', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Swedish', 'actress', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'film', ""'d"", 'expect', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Malick', 'previous', 'work', 'several', 'characters', 'deliver', 'whispered', 'voice-overs', 'ask', 'questions', 'God', 'faith', 'life', 'death', 'loss', 'dialogue', 'important', 'questions', 'themes', 'explored', 'probably', 'most', 'irrelevant', 'part', 'film', 'Malick', 'cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezski', 'emphasize', 'images', 'words', 'Malick', 'one', 'great', 'visual', 'filmmakers', 'images', 'so', 'beautifully', 'film', 'almost', 'entertaining', 'based', 'beauty', 'images', 'alone', 'Whether', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'beauty', 'Malick', 'eye', 'cinematography', 'Jack', 'Fisk', 'production', 'design', 'make', 'film', 'wonder', 'behold', 'are', 'incredible', 'shots', 'nature', 'even', 'shots', 'simply', 'feature', 'Penn', 'wandering', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'are', 'haunting', 'startling', 'are', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'yes', 'including', 'dinosaurs', 'even', 'are', 'fascinating', 'beautiful', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'attributed', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'beautiful', 'operatic', 'score', 'many', 'have', 'stayed', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rave', 'enough', 'images', 'drive', 'movie', 'dream-life', 'evocation', 'childhood', 'film', 'remarkably', 'existential', 'perhaps', 'even', 'esoteric', 'level', 'final', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'are', 'most', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'images', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'think', 'Tree', 'Life', 'perfect', 'film', 'can', 'ignore', 'how', 'indulgent', 'much', 'is.It', 'film', 'built', 'images', 'been', 'written', 'Malick', 'will', 'reject', 'shots', 'artistic', 'aesthetic', 'shots', 'do', 'grow', 'repetitious', 'times', 'pacing', 'will', 'trouble', 'many', 'admit', 'film', 'felt', 'much', 'longer', 'was', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'bored', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'beauty', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'alienated', 'slow', 'pacing', 'overindulgence', 'Know', 'Tree', 'Life', 'less', 'film', 'experience', 'best', 'seen', 'big', 'screen.While', 'imperfect', 'Tree', 'Life', 'rather', 'profound', 'cinematic', 'tapestry', ""n't"", 'spoon-feed', 'themes', 'instead', 'interpret', 'how', 'wish', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'such', 'way', ""'ve"", 'already', 'found', 'growing', 'stature', 'mind', 'wish', 'see', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'consider', 'single', 'viewing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'do', 'justice', 'pretentious', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'fact', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'highly', 'recommend', 'curious', 'viewer.GRADE', 'A-']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Being a great fan of this composer I got the soundtrack before seeing the movie; however, there's little or nothing of that music in the movie!).TTOL has no solid plot, no conflict, no big drama. Descriptive more than dramatic, it might seem to you that nothing has happened in the 2 hours and 18 minutes you've wasted. It ends with the most archeotipical and cheap of all the morals: to live without love is poinless; a pedestrian conclusion that seems to have been taken from a Barbara Cartland novel. Besides, the movie becomes really affected by being so solemn, so ""elevated"" in ideas, so ""intelectual"" that becomes pretentious and sometimes incomprehensible. We might refer to the interpetations but there's little or nothing to say because character construction does not offer much to shine in the interpretative field (What is Sean Penn doing in such a role?)I would suggest to be alert with the next Cannes Film Festival Awards: the last two Palmes D'or have gone to tedious and heady movies: the deadpan UNCLE BOONMEE WHO CAN RECALL HIS PAST LIVES (APICHATPONG WEERASETHAKUL)and this one.In a nutshell: Beautiful, very beautiful, yet affected, overlong and BORING to death.

1392940,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B004A8ZX32,kacunnin,"[8, 13]","Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE is a spectacularly beautiful artistic creation that is, at the same time, frustratingly fragmented and difficult to categorize.  While it attempts to explore the origins of the universe and the meaning of life - huge and often incomprehensible subjects - the story it tells is quite simple.  Jack O'Brien (played by Hunter McCracken as a boy, and Sean Penn as a middle-aged adult) grew up in Waco, Texas during the 1950's.  He remembers his mother (Jessica Chastain) as a deeply caring but passive person who was unable to stand up to his strict and domineering father (Brad Pitt).  When Jack's younger brother dies, the incomprehensible grief of it tears the family apart and leaves Jack feeling lost and frustrated.  The film is really Jack's remembrances of the life he led and his search for meaning in the cold and sterile world he lives in as an adult.But the film really isn't about this admittedly thin story.  Told in a series of expressionist images and brief vignettes, with whispered narration the viewer will strain to make sense of, TREE OF LIFE is more pure art than any film I have ever seen.  This makes it breathtakingly beautiful, surprisingly powerful, and ultimately a pretentious piece that is polarizing to its audience.  Film is a visual medium, and Malick takes full advantage of that to spin his grand tale of the ultimate meaning of life.  The choice, he says, is between grace (a vague spiritualism represented by Jack's warm and loving mother) and nature (the blind forces of a cold and uncaring world, represented by Jack's emotionally stunted father).  As a child, Jack was tormented by his father's cruel detachment - he admits in one scene that he is just like his father (""I am more like you than I am like her"").  This, Malick postures, is his undoing.  Like his father (whose life has not turned out as he had hoped), anger and disappointment separate Jack from the loving world made possible through grace.  Jack's epiphany at the end of the film brings him full circle, and helps us see that true grace is always there, always calling to us, even if we don't know its name.I call this film pretentious because it is willing to be pure art.  It's willing to throw itself out there without regard to how it will be received.  This isn't a film that is aimed at a particular audience - it's Malick's film, his visual expression of deep faith.  Some have called the film Christian, and there are certainly references to God and church.  But the spiritualism is really far broader than that.  It's the spiritualism of the universe, and Malick at once acknowledges how small and powerless we humans are and how interconnected we are with things far grander and less comprehensible than our tiny selves.  It's pretentious because Malick pretends to know more than we do.  He dares to suggest that the images he splashes across the screen are sacred and perfect in ways we may not understand.  I don't mean this in a critical way - pure expressions of self can't escape pretension.Did I like TREE OF LIFE?  I'm not sure.  I certainly responded to it.  It reminded me (as it did many others) of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially in its use of color and music to make a grand statement.  I was also distanced from TREE OF LIFE, in the same way I was from 2001 - both films are so vast in their imagery that the viewer can feel lost, especially without the comfort of a linear story to hold onto.  I never felt particularly connected to Sean Penn's adult Jack, which makes it more difficult to truly relate to his epiphany in the film's final act.  But I did feel very moved by young Jack's frustrating relationship with his father, and several scenes between Jack and his younger brother are poignant and powerful (one especially, where Jack and his brother stand on opposite sides of a window, pressing their fingers and hands together against the glass, is beautifully done).Overall, I do recommend this film to anyone who truly appreciates ""art for art's sake.""  Don't expect a traditional story, and don't expect your questions to be answered.  But if you enjoy the idea of questions, and if you're willing to let the answers evolve over time, as you think about the film, wonder about it, and re-imagine it, then give it a chance.  Ultimately, what this film will be for you depends on what you bring to it.  This is true for all great art.  It's not easy, but it can be worth it.",4,"Beautiful, powerful, frustrating, and pretentious -- not easy, but ultimately worth your time",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,4454,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'artistic', 'creation', 'same', 'time', 'frustratingly', 'fragmented', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'explore', 'origins', 'universe', 'meaning', 'life', 'huge', 'often', 'incomprehensible', 'subjects', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Jack', ""O'Brien"", 'played', 'Hunter', 'McCracken', 'boy', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'middle-aged', 'adult', 'grew', 'up', 'Waco', 'Texas', '1950', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'deeply', 'caring', 'passive', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'stand', 'up', 'strict', 'domineering', 'father', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'When', 'Jack', 'younger', 'brother', 'dies', 'incomprehensible', 'grief', 'family', 'apart', 'Jack', 'feeling', 'lost', 'frustrated', 'film', 'really', 'Jack', 'remembrances', 'life', 'led', 'search', 'meaning', 'cold', 'sterile', 'world', 'adult.But', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'admittedly', 'thin', 'story', 'Told', 'series', 'expressionist', 'images', 'brief', 'vignettes', 'whispered', 'narration', 'viewer', 'will', 'strain', 'make', 'sense', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'more', 'pure', 'art', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'polarizing', 'audience', 'Film', 'visual', 'medium', 'Malick', 'full', 'advantage', 'spin', 'grand', 'tale', 'ultimate', 'meaning', 'life', 'choice', 'grace', 'vague', 'spiritualism', 'represented', 'Jack', 'warm', 'loving', 'mother', 'nature', 'blind', 'forces', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'world', 'represented', 'Jack', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'father', 'child', 'Jack', 'was', 'tormented', 'father', 'cruel', 'detachment', 'one', 'scene', 'just', 'father', 'am', 'more', 'am', 'Malick', 'postures', 'undoing', 'father', 'life', 'not', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'hoped', 'anger', 'disappointment', 'separate', 'Jack', 'loving', 'world', 'made', 'possible', 'grace', 'Jack', 'epiphany', 'end', 'film', 'full', 'circle', 'see', 'true', 'grace', 'always', 'there', 'always', 'calling', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name.I', 'call', 'film', 'pretentious', 'willing', 'be', 'pure', 'art', 'willing', 'throw', 'out', 'there', 'regard', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'received', ""n't"", 'film', 'aimed', 'particular', 'audience', 'Malick', 'film', 'visual', 'expression', 'deep', 'faith', 'have', 'called', 'film', 'Christian', 'are', 'certainly', 'references', 'God', 'church', 'spiritualism', 'really', 'far', 'broader', 'spiritualism', 'universe', 'Malick', 'once', 'how', 'small', 'powerless', 'humans', 'are', 'how', 'interconnected', 'are', 'things', 'far', 'grander', 'less', 'comprehensible', 'tiny', 'selves', 'pretentious', 'Malick', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'suggest', 'images', 'screen', 'are', 'sacred', 'perfect', 'ways', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'critical', 'way', 'pure', 'expressions', 'self', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'pretension.Did', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'certainly', 'responded', 'reminded', 'did', 'many', 'others', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'especially', 'use', 'color', 'music', 'make', 'grand', 'statement', 'was', 'also', 'distanced', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'same', 'way', 'was', '2001', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'vast', 'imagery', 'viewer', 'can', 'feel', 'lost', 'especially', 'comfort', 'linear', 'story', 'hold', 'never', 'felt', 'particularly', 'connected', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'adult', 'Jack', 'more', 'difficult', 'truly', 'relate', 'epiphany', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'did', 'feel', 'very', 'moved', 'young', 'Jack', 'frustrating', 'relationship', 'father', 'several', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'younger', 'brother', 'are', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'one', 'especially', 'where', 'Jack', 'brother', 'stand', 'opposite', 'sides', 'window', 'pressing', 'fingers', 'together', 'glass', 'beautifully', 'done', '.Overall', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'truly', 'art', 'art', 'sake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'traditional', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'enjoy', 'idea', 'questions', ""'re"", 'willing', 'let', 'answers', 'evolve', 'time', 'think', 'film', 'wonder', 're-imagine', 'then', 'give', 'chance', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'bring', 'true', 'great', 'art', 'not', 'easy', 'can', 'be', 'worth']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Penn has an even smaller part with roughly five minutes total and one or two sentences.This movie was filmed in such a way that it appears as a home video- filmed by a child, at a child's height and extremely close up.  The father is routinely depicted as an abusive, hard-nosed man who places odd demands upon his young children.  Pulling perfectly good green grass out of the yard....By hand....By his child. It appears he has a mental illness of some sort, OCD or maybe just a control freak?  He oddly obsesses over music and freely hands out tidbits of useless information to his kids throughout the movie.  He puts down his children constantly, and the children clearly cannot stand their father.  He is physically abusive to his wife and children.  A child dies.  A woman kisses a child wrapped in a tight white sheet. The whole body from head to toe is wrapped in this white sheet.  The same woman is shown floating around above the grass.  Its eerie.  A second child dies. A child grows up cruel, abusive and acting strangely just like his father. A child tells his father that his father would probably like to kill him when, the reality is, the child would actually like to kill his father. He prays that God will take his father away.  The movie continues as we follow two brothers living life with their family.  The older brother tormenting the younger brother in various different and demented ways.This is just a really odd movie that only a certain group will like.  This is going to be one of those movies that you either love or hate. I don't see how it could be middle of the road at all. And while ""Dove"" has given it the green light and approved it appropriate for kids 12+, they would be extremely bored and confused.  At over two hours its a bit much.  I am amazed by the people who can see/read deeper into the meaning of these two movies. Or maybe they are just seeing what they want to see?  I kept watching and waiting and waiting for a really awesome ending, and it just never came.

You cannot expect traditional story telling forms, sex, romance, action or any of the other elements that guarantee a blockbuster.  Malick wants more from his audience, and he demands with The Tree of Life.  After watching it quietly I was amazed by the beauty of the film and the performances of the actors.  Penn's part in the film was rather small, and often turned from the camera, so the high praise for his standard wrinkle browed performance puzzles me, but everyone else was brilliant.  Pitt,  Chastain, and especially the children were wonderful.  More specifically young 'Jack' as portrayed by Hunter McCraken.  This young man carries a large portion of the film, beautifully and movingly.After finishing the film I sat for long time thinking about the juxtaposition of the beginnings of life and the resulting intimacy of life for a human.  I wondered if I had understood Mr. Malick's message, and it's a question that I still ponder.  After all, a director is giving us his own world view.  But one thing I can be sure of; I don't think the viewer was given quite enough information about this family in a small Texas town.  We begin with the knowledge that a son has died.  But we never know how, along with other many small details.  Given the era portrayed, perhaps it was Viet Nam, with the emphasis on his age of nineteen.  If it was, then Mr. Malick overlooked the fact that military officials always come in person with the news, not a hand delivered letter or telegram.  Strangely, I came away more moved by the images of nature's amazing biological forms and a moment of mercy between two prehistoric lives, a precursor to our own.Watch it for its beauty, and because it's unforgettable.",4,Mysterious and beautiful,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1755,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'traditional', 'story', 'telling', 'forms', 'sex', 'romance', 'action', 'other', 'elements', 'guarantee', 'blockbuster', 'Malick', 'more', 'audience', 'Tree', 'Life', 'watching', 'quietly', 'was', 'amazed', 'beauty', 'film', 'performances', 'actors', 'Penn', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'small', 'often', 'turned', 'camera', 'high', 'praise', 'standard', 'wrinkle', 'browed', 'performance', 'puzzles', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Pitt', 'Chastain', 'especially', 'children', 'were', 'wonderful', 'More', 'specifically', 'young', ""'Jack"", 'portrayed', 'Hunter', 'McCraken', 'young', 'man', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'beautifully', 'movingly.After', 'finishing', 'film', 'sat', 'long', 'time', 'thinking', 'juxtaposition', 'beginnings', 'life', 'resulting', 'intimacy', 'life', 'human', 'wondered', 'had', 'understood', 'Mr.', 'Malick', 'message', 'question', 'still', 'ponder', 'director', 'giving', 'own', 'world', 'view', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewer', 'was', 'given', 'quite', 'enough', 'information', 'family', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'begin', 'knowledge', 'son', 'died', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'other', 'many', 'small', 'details', 'Given', 'era', 'portrayed', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'emphasis', 'age', 'nineteen', 'was', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Malick', 'overlooked', 'fact', 'military', 'officials', 'always', 'come', 'person', 'news', 'not', 'hand', 'delivered', 'letter', 'telegram', 'Strangely', 'came', 'away', 'more', 'moved', 'images', 'nature', 'amazing', 'biological', 'forms', 'moment', 'mercy', 'two', 'prehistoric', 'lives', 'precursor', 'own.Watch', 'beauty', 'unforgettable']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Clearly these words are the words of prayer, but they sound not like the prayer of petitioning but rather more meditative, as if the speaker already believes in everything sacred, as if the spirit voicing these thoughts already knows that guidance is given, eternally.For those without the imagination or faith to embrace such a moment, Malick's film will be tedious, meaningless, perhaps even infuriating. For anyone, though, with even a shred of religious feeling, ""The Tree of Life"" could stand as one of the greatest films ever made. Yet it requires no dogma, no denomination; if you haven't set foot in church in twenty years, still it will move you if you allow it.Malick has done many fine things with this movie, which is so unlike any sort of traditional Hollywood film that it's hard to believe it got made. It's almost impossible to find a comparison, though one does come to mind: Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" For ""Tree,"" Malick coaxed ""2001"" special effects genius Douglas Trumbull out of retirement. The scenes of the universe, and of life developing on Earth, are so stunning and beautiful they will bring tears ... and will remind the careful viewer of the visuals Trumbull helped create for Kubrick.Yet while Kubrick's prime concern in ""2001"" was the human intellect, Malick's is the human soul. I am not one of the people who find Kubrick cold; I think his films inspire awe, but I have to agree that Malick has a different tilt.Put simply, the plot description seems so mundane: A boy remembers growing up in the 1950s as his father struggled to make a mark for himself and his mother struggled to emphasize to her sons that ""making a living"" isn't nearly as important as ... LIVING. Yet Malick has placed this simple story in such a grand frame that it becomes much more than just the story of a few individuals. The conflict between cruel nature and the state of grace ends up applying to everything in creation. Water and rock, earth and sky, creatures ranging from dinosaur to human ... All is in motion, and nature and grace are at work constantly.This is a superb, searching film that dares delve into the very bedrock of existence.

Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things,"" writer/director Terrence Malick.The choice between nature and grace is a hard one for most people, but it's actually a struggle for the main character of ""The Tree of Life,"" Jack, who was raised by polar-opposite parents: a compassionate, free-spirited mother (the lovely Jessica Chastain), and a stern, disciplinarian father (played by Brad Pitt. Side note: the late Heath Ledger was originally casted for this role).The adult Jack is an architect and seems trapped and suffocated (the perfect role for Sean Penn), not only by his current environment in a modern city of glass and metal, but by the unresolved issues with his brother's death as a teen and a complicated relationship with his father. And I'll even venture to say that he's also questioning his place in the universe, the meaning of it all.Through Jack's fragmented memory we travel back in time (way back...like billions of years) to witness--with visual splendor--the birth of the cosmos and earth's formation (dinosaurs and all), before making a stop in the 1950's during his childhood in a small town in Texas.  The cinematography during this part of the film is much more subtle but equally splendid, with curtains swaying in the breeze, a shot of Jack during a lazy summer afternoon laying on a picnic blanket next to his mother, cheerful kids chasing after clouds of DDT smoke coming from a passing truck, the pleats of his mother's dress, the swing on the green front yard, the warmth of the light in their house...You'll have to watch the film to continue that journey through time. But please understand that it's a different type of movie, which has won the praise of critics as well as the confusion of many viewers.

1392957,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004A8ZX32,Mark Turner,"[6, 8]","Last year at the film festival in Cannes, all the talk seemed to be about Terrence Malick's new film THE TREE OF LIFE. In part this was due to the critics taking note of the movie and reviews ranged from one end of the scale to the other. But no one wanted to miss it. Perhaps that's because Malick is something different in Hollywood.Since 1973 Malick has only released 5 films as a director and almost all of them have been critically acclaimed if not a huge financial success. And yet he continues to direct films and find studios to back him. Where some films that claim to be ""art films"" never deserve the attention they receive, Malick's films are more often than not something to witness. They are a visual and storytelling treat. Those films have included BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE, THE NEW WORLD and now THE TREE OF LIFE. I usually find myself appreciating films like these but rarely enjoy them enough to watch again. This film changes that.The story begins with the death of a brother to Jack (Sean Penn). Its effect on him isn't quite visible. Surely he is shaken but it makes him think back to other things, other days and growing up in the 1950s.Brad Pitt plays Mr. O'Brien, Jack's father. Pitt's character is a strict disciplinarian but not without reason. He wants his children to grow up and be successful. This becomes even more important later in the film when he is forced to take on a different job. He feels its better to be your own boss than to work at the whim of someone else. His battles with life, his struggles, are imposed upon his three sons, especially Jack.Jack's mother is the opposite of his father, a free spirit who sees joy in the world around her, who offers her children a sense of freedom in simply playing. Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is a tender woman who loves her husband and her children with equal measure, but who wants her boys to experience life as opposed to just making a living and not experiencing things as simple as sunsets.One would think that these two differing people would be hard pressed to find common ground. But the fact is that they are the yin and yang of these boys lives, the balance between reality and fantasy that should exist to make a person complete, to make them whole. And as the life Jack remembers fills the screen we see the three brothers in various forms through his eyes; his love of his brothers and at times his jealousy of them. We witness his admiration for his father but his fear of him as well. And we see his love for his mother that comes through at all times.This is a coming of age story that shows a young boy grow up to be a man but without a major plot issue that makes it happen. It's not like someone dies or does drugs but a simple story of a boy. You recognize so much of what Jack goes through and experiences if you grew up during this time period or even the one after. Fireflies, bb guns and tying frogs to model rockets are just some of the crazy things kids do or did. And Jack and his brothers do it all.But Malick wasn't content to leave it at that. We also have the story of Pitt's character, a man who struggles to do his best and yet considers himself a failure. In reality he hasn't failed he's just placed in a position where he can't achieve the goals he's set for himself. That day might come, but not as this story takes place. He is a man with wealth in the love of his wife and children who feels he is poor. And it is through his disappointment in himself that we see the bad side of family.Malick is amazing in the images he turns up on film. What for most would be a humdrum neighborhood with little to see, Malick turns it into a feast for the eyes. You can almost feel the warm summer days when kids would play or do yard work here. And a sunset is rarely captured so brilliantly on film.Added to this is a sequence that involves the creation of the world. It's an amazing thing to watch that would fit home in Epcot let alone in any film concerning the beginnings of life. The effects used and the footage that comes out is breathtakingly beautiful.At just over 2 hours the movie may seem a tad long for some. While I watched though it passed the personal test I have for all movies: when it's really bad and if it moves to slow I just hang tight to the remote and move past the slow parts. Sorry but that's the truth. I never once felt the need to do so here.THE TREE OF LIFE is a fantastic movie. It's one that I will keep on hand because I know I'll want to experience it again, finding new things to witness with each viewing. It's a movie that I think anyone with children will enjoy. And it's a treat for the eyes, the ears and the mind. In short, this is a great movie and deserving of all the credit and hype that surrounded its initial release. It deserves better than the short time it was on screens and needs to be discovered. With its release on DVD, now is the chance.",5,A LOOK AT LIFE,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4929,"['Last', 'year', 'film', 'festival', 'Cannes', 'talk', 'seemed', 'be', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'new', 'film', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'part', 'was', 'due', 'critics', 'taking', 'note', 'movie', 'reviews', 'ranged', 'one', 'end', 'scale', 'other', 'one', 'wanted', 'miss', 'Perhaps', 'Malick', 'something', 'different', 'Hollywood.Since', '1973', 'Malick', 'only', 'released', '5', 'films', 'director', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'not', 'huge', 'financial', 'success', 'yet', 'direct', 'films', 'find', 'studios', 'back', 'Where', 'films', 'claim', 'be', 'art', 'films', 'never', 'deserve', 'attention', 'receive', 'Malick', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'something', 'witness', 'are', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'treat', 'films', 'have', 'included', 'BADLANDS', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'THE', 'THIN', 'RED', 'LINE', 'THE', 'NEW', 'WORLD', 'now', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'usually', 'find', 'appreciating', 'films', 'rarely', 'enjoy', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'film', 'that.The', 'story', 'death', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'effect', ""n't"", 'quite', 'visible', 'Surely', 'shaken', 'think', 'back', 'other', 'things', 'other', 'days', 'growing', 'up', '1950s.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Mr.', ""O'Brien"", 'Jack', 'father', 'Pitt', 'character', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'not', 'reason', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'successful', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'forced', 'take', 'different', 'job', 'better', 'be', 'own', 'boss', 'work', 'whim', 'someone', 'else', 'battles', 'life', 'struggles', 'are', 'imposed', 'three', 'sons', 'especially', 'Jack.Jack', 'mother', 'opposite', 'father', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'joy', 'world', 'who', 'children', 'sense', 'freedom', 'simply', 'playing', 'Mrs.', ""O'Brien"", 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'tender', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'children', 'equal', 'measure', 'who', 'boys', 'experience', 'life', 'opposed', 'just', 'making', 'living', 'not', 'experiencing', 'things', 'as', 'simple', 'sunsets.One', 'would', 'think', 'two', 'differing', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'fact', 'are', 'yin', 'yang', 'boys', 'lives', 'balance', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'should', 'exist', 'make', 'person', 'complete', 'make', 'whole', 'life', 'Jack', 'screen', 'see', 'three', 'brothers', 'various', 'forms', 'eyes', 'love', 'brothers', 'times', 'jealousy', 'witness', 'admiration', 'father', 'fear', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'love', 'mother', 'times.This', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'man', 'major', 'plot', 'issue', 'happen', 'not', 'someone', 'dies', 'drugs', 'simple', 'story', 'boy', 'recognize', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Jack', 'experiences', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'period', 'even', 'one', 'Fireflies', 'bb', 'guns', 'tying', 'frogs', 'model', 'rockets', 'are', 'just', 'crazy', 'things', 'kids', 'do', 'did', 'Jack', 'brothers', 'do', 'all.But', 'Malick', 'was', ""n't"", 'content', 'leave', 'also', 'have', 'story', 'Pitt', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'best', 'yet', 'considers', 'failure', 'reality', ""n't"", 'failed', 'just', 'placed', 'position', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'goals', 'set', 'day', 'might', 'come', 'not', 'story', 'place', 'man', 'wealth', 'love', 'wife', 'children', 'who', 'feels', 'poor', 'disappointment', 'see', 'bad', 'side', 'family.Malick', 'amazing', 'images', 'up', 'film', 'What', 'most', 'would', 'be', 'humdrum', 'neighborhood', 'little', 'see', 'Malick', 'feast', 'eyes', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'warm', 'summer', 'days', 'when', 'kids', 'would', 'play', 'do', 'yard', 'work', 'here', 'sunset', 'rarely', 'captured', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'film.Added', 'sequence', 'creation', 'world', 'amazing', 'thing', 'watch', 'would', 'fit', 'home', 'Epcot', 'let', 'alone', 'film', 'concerning', 'beginnings', 'life', 'effects', 'used', 'footage', 'out', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful.At', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'tad', 'long', 'watched', 'passed', 'personal', 'test', 'have', 'movies', 'when', 'really', 'bad', 'slow', 'just', 'hang', 'tight', 'remote', 'move', 'slow', 'parts', 'Sorry', 'truth', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'need', 'do', 'so', 'here.THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'hand', 'know', ""'ll"", 'want', 'experience', 'again', 'finding', 'new', 'things', 'witness', 'viewing', 'movie', 'think', 'anyone', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'treat', 'eyes', 'ears', 'mind', 'short', 'great', 'movie', 'deserving', 'credit', 'hype', 'surrounded', 'initial', 'release', 'better', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'screens', 'needs', 'be', 'discovered', 'release', 'DVD', 'now', 'chance']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

It is dense and strange and long and lacks what most people would recognize as plot, dialogue, story, and so on. So don't go and rent or buy this because of what I'm about to say or because I enjoyed it (at least I think I did...). The most apt comparison is perhaps Kubrick's 2001 - and this is less plot-driven and stranger. Looking at reviews here, it is obviously polarizing. Some will think it is unspeakably profound, others will think it is unbearably obtuse and pretentious. Both are valid opinions, in my view.But as a Blu-Ray? Holy Toledo. Easily, easily, EASILY the finest Blu-ray I've ever seen. This transfer trumps the superb BD's available for The Thin Red Line, Baraka, Sin City, Hot Fuzz, Pirates of the Caribbean, and any other live-action BD I've seen (I won't evaluate it against animated movies except to say that I'd rather watch this than any of those, because reality trumps animation in terms of visual interest, IMHO).In terms of detail, every single frame of the film displays absolutely pristine detail. Every blade of grass, pore of skin, stray hair, texture of fabric, pebble on the ground, ripple of paint on a wall - is visible with absolute crystal clarity. The detail on faces is unreal (and believe me, I was transfixed by Jessica Chastain's face whenever it was on screen - she may be the most radiant vision of feminine beauty ever committed to celluloid). Peach fuzz on a baby's face in a mid-focus shot was easily evident.Color is superbly realistic, black levels are deep and inky but not crushed, and there is absolutely no posterization or banding on a set of very challenging scenes depicting skies, spacescapes, starfields, and so on.Film grain is visible from up close, but I am assuming the film stock used was a relatively low-grain one (similar to ""The Reader""). There is absolutely no evidence of any undue digital manipulation. It is as if there is a piece of film being projected by a perfect machine, onto a perfect screen surface, with perfect focus on your HD television screen.Stunning, stunning, stunning. Even if you don't end up liking the movie, it's worth a rental just to witness the Blu-Ray format in its full flower.

1392965,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004A8ZX32,mirasreviews,"[5, 7]","""The Tree of Life"" is Terrence Malick's comment on two different approaches to living and understanding life, that of natural determinism versus that of acceptance or grace, not just in human life but on a universal scale. It's no wonder the film's reach exceeds its grasp. Jack (Sean Penn) is a successful architect who is reminded of his childhood and the death of his younger brother when he sees a tree being planted near his office. He thinks back to his childhood in post-War Waco, Texas, with his two brothers, his stern, overcritical father (Brad Pitt), and empathetic mother (Jessica Chastain). When Jack reached puberty, he often clashed with his father, who seemed to take out his dissatisfaction with his own life on his boys.We don't only see Jack's memories, but also what came before him -his parents' relationship, prehistoric earth, where we observe some interesting dinosaur interactions, and the creation of the universe. These seem to include Jack's mother's rumination on the meaning of life after she loses her son, as well. The ideas presented are, in a sense, an omnipresent perspective, channeled through these people. Many images are of water, fire, landscapes, and stellar phenomena. I lost patience with one extended abstract sequence that I felt was not connected to the human story effectively. But the film eventually returns to a loose narrative of Jack's childhood.""The Tree of Life"" is highly cinematic, which I appreciated. Dialogue is spare. The story is told through shots, not scenes. Images are beautiful and strong. And Brad Pitt gives a wonderful performance. I'm a huge fan of the cinematic, of films that are films, not theatrical productions, of images rather than dialogue, reminiscent of the silent era. So I found a lot to like. On the other hand, the film is unnecessarily long. In some instances, Malick simply overdoes the imagery. His thematic reach exceeds its grasp, sometimes conspicuously so. I would cut a half-hour off of it, but Terrence Malick was never in a hurry to get through a film. It's flawed. If you like Terrence Malick's work, I recommend it.

One has a BB gun.  They take turns shooting into the water or at trees.  Finally the older boy dares the other to put his finger in front of the barrel.  This was me many years ago.  There were several scenes in this film that will likely bring back memories, especially for those who remember small towns, unlocked houses and inventing things to do when there was no electronic stimulation.  The film opens when Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) gets a telegram.  As was usually the case in decades past, telegrams often carried bad news.  This is no exception.  She learns that one of her sons has died.  He was 19.  We don't know how or why.  She calls her husband (Brad Pitt) at work to give him the news.  For anyone with children, this hit to the gut is devastating to both the family and the audience and brings us quickly into the film.  The grief of the O'Brien's transcends into memories of a better time.  A time of birth of their three boys.Malick then tosses in a 16 minute foray into his ideas of the creation of the Universe and evolution.  With the help of legendary filmmaker and photography pioneer Douglas Trumbull and numerous others, Malick creates his own visual extravaganza including early life on planet Earth.  Yes, there are a couple dinosaurs.  But not a T-Rex or some other well known species.  We see one on a beach, just arrived from the sea.  We see one, similar to an ostrich but with teeth, pin down another unfortunate enough to have short legs.  He then just walks away.  Just another day on earth 80 million years ago.  This trip will challenge your Blu ray display and your surround system.  In fact an opening line before the movie begins suggests that you play the film loud and I agree.  Not only for the great sounds and beautiful soundtrack but because, the actors will speak over a scene in a reverent whisper.  The O'Brien's are a God fearing family and do their best to honor Him.The film set mostly in the 1950's around Waco, Texas but the town isn't clearly identified.  I suspect this was done on purpose.  It could have been a small town in Indiana, California or New York.  A time of large yards, clean water and open spaces.  A time when most of the crime was vandalism at the hand of kids overcoming boredom.  While we are never sure of the circumstances or identity of the son who has died, we know it isn't Jack the oldest.  He is now a successful architect in a big city.  As an adult he is played by Sean Penn.  When he enters the movie he is speaking with his father by phone.  Something is wrong.  Again, Malick keeps us in the dark but we suspect another family member has died.  The film closes the circle of life on a beach.  Perhaps a metaphor for entering Heaven.  Throughout the film Malick focuses on the balance between ""grace"" represented by Mrs. O'Brien and ""nature"" represented by Mr. O'Brien.  Keeping this in mind may be helpful understanding this potentially divisive movie.  ""The Tree of Life"" is like no other film and certainly one of the best of the year.

Attempting to microscope two overlapping paths in life, the way of nature and the way of grace, we're introduced to the father, whose relationship with his three boys alternates between affection and bullying, and their loving mother, seemingly detached from nature.Terrence defiantly refuses anything resembling a conventional plot line, showering us instead with photographic exposures and voice narratives brimming with transcendental beauty, utilizing the book of Job as a blueprint to undress birth, life, death, meaninglessness, and the mysterious shroud of God's measure from humanity, even taking us on an exploration of big bang origins.Unfortunately, Tree is misunderstood and under-appreciated. There's people out there telling you not to waste your time on this film, and they're wrong. Look, it's simple, if you think Pirates, Potter, or Transformers IS the cinematic experience, then you'll gag your way through Life. It's like nothing you've ever seen before.

Malick is known for visually beautiful but incomprehensible filmmaking and he does not surprise anyone here in 'Tree of Life'. If anything, 'Tree of Life' is his most incomprehensible film to date and a second viewing (almost a requirement for any Malik film) does not do much good. It also does not help that, as usual, Malik offers little explanation. Like all of Malik's other films, the DVD set offers little extras to give the viewers cluesabout the intent of the film.Segments of a life told in disjointed scenes that bounce through time with mumbled dialogue and an overlaid voiceover tell the story (sort of) of a failed father, a solid but suffering mother, and 3 boys. Sean Penn plays the reflective older son remembering the past; Brad Pitt plays the loving but frustrated father. All of this is wrapped up in a prologue that represents the beginning of the universe and an epilogue that represents heaven.This is the most emotional film that Malik has ever made yet still the viewer is kept at a emotional distance from the characters  Perhaps this is why the film has been compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'; that and the long forming of the universe sequence early in the film.

It is very emotional and powerful without using a lot of dialogue or elaborate dramatic sequences. I sort of knew what to expect from previous Terrence Malick films, however I was left speechless and emotional after watching this film. I think people who have children may look at it differently than those who do not. It is about life, however it is also about father (Brad Pitt) and son (Sean Penn) and their relationship and how the son's growth and outcome in life relates to his upbringing.The film is comprised of beautifully breathtaking shots of nature and life and events. It truly is a documentary of life and even the cinematography and camera angles remind me of a nature documentary. The camera floats around the objects and actors as we view them relating to situations and simply living. There are some dramatic conversations and emotional scenes, however I believe I could type up the script for the entire film on one page, double-spaced. The movie somehow captures all the emotion and feelings in the characters simply by their strong emotions. Brad Pitts wife in the film, Jessica Chastain, perfectly captures the emotional power of the situations her and the family are put into.The entire film is accompanied by beautiful music, which perfectly blends the visual and audio aspect of the film. This film is beautifully directed and one which I am proud to own. It will have a different affect of each viewer, however The Tree of Life left me speechless and in tears of beauty and remembrance of youth and growing up.The Tree of Life is by far the clearest most accurate Blu-ray I have ever viewed, and I own over 800 Blu-rays and view all of them on a Sony 55"" 240hz HDTV. Having a strong audio system is also important. I cranked this film up as instructed when I inserted the disc. The speech is low and the music is high and crisp.

Although the film's overall rating is 3 stars as of this writing (January 2012), the 3-star rating itself has the smallest number of reviews, with the 5-star and 1-star reviews about equally divided, as are the 4-star and 2-star reviews.  It's not that most people found the film to be average, when in fact very few people did.  They either loved it or hated it.It's unusual for a film to elicit such a polarized response, but it's not surprising that this film would.  Most people seem to agree that the film is filled with beautiful images (and they are stunning), but many people understandably expect more from a movie than gorgeous cinematography.  It appears to me that there are three main sections to the film:  a fairly long introduction, very visual and with only short sequences involving the characters, minimal dialogue and some brief and somewhat enigmatic voice-overs;  a longer middle section, in which the actors are seen in a series of separate but related episodes arranged in more or less chronological order;  and a conclusion, which returns to the highly visual style of the introduction, with the addition of more scenes including the characters, but again, very little dialogue, just voice-overs.There is a story, but it's not shown in a tightly connected, linear manner.  The director assumes that viewers will fill in the blanks between the scenes, and he provides enough of a structure that this is not something that requires a great deal of speculation by the viewer.  Still, I think this section is the one that viewers may find most challenging (or annoying, depending on one's frame of mind), and I can see that it's not something that would appeal to everyone.  The first time I watched the film, I stopped after about 15 minutes, because I was tired, I had trouble paying attention, and I really wasn't sure it was going to be worth my time or my effort.  I'm very glad that I didn't give up on it, because the second time I watched it, I couldn't stop watching.The acting is consistently excellent, and I found myself forgetting that it was Brad Pitt, because his portrayal of a 1950's father was so convincing.  The same was true of the mother and the actors who played the children.  It felt at times as if I were viewing a very beautifully presented documentary with high production values.The soundtrack is a major part of the film, with passages from Mahler, Brahms, and others, and with such a soundtrack, and so many beautiful visual sequences, it's easy to see why this film had been compared to ""2001.""  This is not a science fiction film, and it does not deal with space travel, but both films share a similar style.The director took on a major project here, he did not flinch from challenging viewers, and ultimately, I believe that he was successful. It's a film I will definitely watch more than one time.The Blu-Ray disc is outstanding, with excellent image quality and audio.  My only complaint is that there is only one 30-minute feature, and I think that a film like this would have an ideal candidate for a more comprehensive set of extra features.",5,"Ambitious, challenging, and successful",1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,3247,"['can', 'see', 'bar', 'graph', 'showing', 'star', 'ratings', 'reviews', 'here', 'film', 'strong', 'feelings', 'positive', 'negative', 'film', 'overall', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'writing', 'January', '2012', '3-star', 'rating', 'smallest', 'number', 'reviews', '5-star', '1-star', 'reviews', 'equally', 'divided', 'are', '4-star', '2-star', 'reviews', 'not', 'most', 'people', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'average', 'when', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'did', 'loved', 'hated', 'it.It', 'unusual', 'film', 'elicit', 'polarized', 'response', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'would', 'Most', 'people', 'seem', 'agree', 'film', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'images', 'are', 'stunning', 'many', 'people', 'understandably', 'expect', 'more', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'sections', 'film', 'fairly', 'long', 'introduction', 'very', 'visual', 'only', 'short', 'sequences', 'involving', 'characters', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'brief', 'somewhat', 'enigmatic', 'voice-overs', 'longer', 'middle', 'section', 'actors', 'are', 'seen', 'series', 'separate', 'related', 'episodes', 'arranged', 'more', 'less', 'chronological', 'order', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'visual', 'style', 'introduction', 'addition', 'more', 'scenes', 'including', 'characters', 'again', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'just', 'story', 'not', 'shown', 'tightly', 'connected', 'linear', 'manner', 'director', 'viewers', 'will', 'fill', 'blanks', 'scenes', 'enough', 'structure', 'not', 'something', 'great', 'deal', 'speculation', 'viewer', 'Still', 'think', 'section', 'one', 'may', 'find', 'most', 'challenging', 'annoying', 'depending', 'one', 'frame', 'mind', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'stopped', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'tired', 'had', 'trouble', 'paying', 'attention', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'worth', 'time', 'effort', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching.The', 'acting', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'found', 'forgetting', 'was', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'portrayal', '1950', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'same', 'was', 'true', 'mother', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'children', 'felt', 'times', 'were', 'viewing', 'very', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'documentary', 'high', 'production', 'values.The', 'soundtrack', 'major', 'part', 'film', 'passages', 'Mahler', 'Brahms', 'others', 'such', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'many', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'sequences', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'compared', '2001', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'not', 'deal', 'space', 'travel', 'films', 'share', 'similar', 'style.The', 'director', 'took', 'major', 'project', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'flinch', 'challenging', 'viewers', 'ultimately', 'believe', 'was', 'successful', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'time.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'image', 'quality', 'audio', 'only', 'complaint', 'only', 'one', '30-minute', 'feature', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'ideal', 'candidate', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'set', 'extra', 'features']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Through flashbacks we see Jack from infancy until early teens (Hunter McCracken) and his relationship with his stern father (Brad Pitt) and his gentle, nurturing mother (Jessica Chastain).

Indeed I do have reservations. Two long sequences contrasting and supplementing the main story feel poorly proportioned: too long, and too obvious.It was quite a contrast to me:On one side there is the main story taking place in the fifties, seen from the current-day perspective of the Sean Penn-character; a poetic stream of impressions, well edited (fast, suggestive), with good acting (quite natural), and supposedly superb directing.This surely justifies seeing the whole movie! I think the main story (18 + 80 minutes) is unparallelled.On the other side there is this long evolution-sequence (in the first third of the movie) and the final sequence (the resolution): here the feeling surfaces that scenes are (not off the mark in themselves but) too long, and the suggested happenings/messages are too obvious.Maybe it is because Malick wanted `to make a point' (with the evolution-sequence) and because the final sequences supposedly were very personal and emotional/therapeutic for him, that he lost his otherwise good sense of proportion.The whispered voice-overs did not disturb me; I found it interesting and mostly well-done.Unfortanetely, the music was sometimes really over the top.Themes:mourning, wavering faith, and existential ambivalence about two basic attitudes in life:an attitude of control and self-determination, and an attitude of acceptance and (self)sacrifice.(bringing along with it the subthemes of alienation and love/redemption.)The good and beautiful things in this movie certainly are stronger, to me, than the weaker things are weak.One poster on the internet described it very aptly:This is ""an interesting film with significant strengths alongside some fairly significant weaknesses.""Enjoy!",4,unparalleled main story - but as a whole it has some significant flaws,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1851,"['movie', 'notoriously', 'movie-lovers', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'first', 'Malick-movie', 'saw', 'Indeed', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', 'Two', 'long', 'sequences', 'contrasting', 'supplementing', 'main', 'story', 'feel', 'poorly', 'proportioned', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'obvious.It', 'was', 'quite', 'contrast', 'one', 'side', 'main', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'fifties', 'seen', 'current-day', 'perspective', 'Sean', 'Penn-character', 'poetic', 'stream', 'impressions', 'well', 'edited', 'fast', 'suggestive', 'good', 'acting', 'quite', 'natural', 'supposedly', 'superb', 'directing.This', 'surely', 'justifies', 'seeing', 'whole', 'movie', 'think', 'main', 'story', '18', '+', '80', 'minutes', 'unparallelled.On', 'other', 'side', 'long', 'evolution-sequence', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'final', 'sequence', 'resolution', 'here', 'feeling', 'surfaces', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'mark', 'too', 'long', 'suggested', 'happenings/messages', 'are', 'too', 'obvious.Maybe', 'Malick', 'wanted', 'make', 'point', 'evolution-sequence', 'final', 'sequences', 'supposedly', 'were', 'very', 'personal', 'emotional/therapeutic', 'lost', 'otherwise', 'good', 'sense', 'proportion.The', 'whispered', 'voice-overs', 'did', 'not', 'disturb', 'found', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'well-done.Unfortanetely', 'music', 'was', 'sometimes', 'really', 'top.Themes', 'mourning', 'wavering', 'faith', 'existential', 'ambivalence', 'two', 'basic', 'attitudes', 'life', 'attitude', 'control', 'self-determination', 'attitude', 'acceptance', 'sacrifice', 'bringing', 'along', 'subthemes', 'alienation', 'love/redemption', 'good', 'beautiful', 'things', 'movie', 'certainly', 'are', 'stronger', 'weaker', 'things', 'are', 'weak.One', 'poster', 'internet', 'described', 'very', 'aptly', 'interesting', 'film', 'significant', 'strengths', 'fairly', 'significant', 'weaknesses', 'Enjoy']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Tree of Life is some two and a half hour of majestic, sumptuous pictures and images with a minimalist plot that can only be inferred. A movie almost entirely told through pictures. This is my take:One of if not the most difficult experiences for a parent to endure is when ones child dies before they do.  The death is off-screen and never explained. Why Why Why? If there is a God, why did this happen? If there is divine purpose directing our lives, what can be the purpose to violating the natural order and the child dying first. If God can create and order this vast universe and nature throughout history, why would he take my child, the fifties mother (Jessica Chastain) contemplates these questions. What is the plot here?We see beautiful glimpses of a very fifties family in Waco Texas. Father, stern, strict but ultimately loving, stay-at-home, dreamy mother plays with her three boys, makes meals and quietly supports the decisions of her husband, played by Brad Pitt.  Brad works in the factory but would have preferred a job playing organ or piano, his talent and interest. Life is tough and you have to be tough to survive, he tried to teach his sons.  Kids experience a world without media, cell phones, x-boxes, TV's (!) where they use their imaginations in play. The experiences of Waco effect the child Jack O'Brien who becomes the adult played by Sean Penn. What is the purpose of life? Why did his younger brother die and him live? Fights with his father, rebellion. From this idyllic fifties setting, Jack O'Brien grows to be an architect designing huge soulless glass and steel monstrosities. Fights with his father go on in his head. This movie offers a lot of questions and no answers.Much of this is seems autobiographical of director Terrence Malick.We see stunningly beautiful pictures of life, underwater, of earth from space, Pictures not seen since in movies ""2001, a Space Odyssey"". Pictures from the Hubble telescope. Perhaps heaven. A extremely visual movie. A movie of pictures from the perspective of God. The end of days when ""the sea shall give up it's dead"".Director Malick throws in a soundtrack with a lot of classical music, Bach etc. But repeatedly plays Francois Couperin's ""Les Baricades Misterieuses"" -the mysterious barricades - to underline his point...I think people with children and people who who have religion in their lives (or think about ideas of religion) will marvel at this movie.

I grew up as a fraternal twin with eight other children who couldn't wait to leave an abusive and weekend drunk of a father who gave our mother nothing but a lifetime of pain.  Enduring Brad Pitt's bullying was more than I could tolerate.  And trying to make him sympathetic as a church organist was unrealistic and contrary to his John Wayne posturing.  His rule with a firm hand relationship concerning his three sons was repetitive and monotonous.  And his wife was reduced to a doormat.  One son was emotionally disturbed by his father's behavior and we saw this son giving us endless and endless sullen looks that said ""Isn't he cruel""?  That is when the repetitive scenes became laughable.  Sean Penn shows up as this grown-up child and wanders in slick contemporay buildings of glass and chrome  ....  we also see Sean looking LOST walking over a very rocky terrain and later, a sandy landscape with a (get this!)door frame that he walks through.  Mr. Pitt loses his job and the family packs up to move on.

As one of the protagonists in a movie says ""Nature just is, grace we accept.""  It is a film about a family in which three young boys grow up.  Their father is domineering and harsh in attempt to prepare them to the life of adulthood which is full of disappointments and failed hope.  As a head of the family, this father carries the responsibility of providing for his family the best he can.  He has pushed aside his true passion for music in order to devote his life to engineering that is supposed to bring financial stability to the family.  In spite of having 26 patents and never missing a day of work, after 14 years of working for the same company he finds himself forced to accept a job no one else wants in order to preserve his career and his job.  But these realities put pressure on this man who takes it out on his family - his wife and his three sons.This movie is part fantasy, part meditation, part visual feast.  It is definitely not meant to please mass audiences.  It is digging deep into human psyche and it explores how we, as human beings, turn out to be the way we are.  What part of us in innate, what part of ourselves we inherit from our parents and our surroundings, what part of our life experiences molds us into who we are?  There are moments when this film turns into visual masterpiece.  However, the narrative side of it diminishes great potential this film could have had.

1392996,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B004A8ZX32,Richard Masloski,"[17, 40]","I love art films...but not when I am aware of the  ""art"" in each and every frame of the film.  THE TREE OF LIFE is one of the most self-conscious movies I have ever watched.  Terrence Malick's ponderous, pretentious, painful mode of movie-making as evidenced in this puerile effort is intensely irritating, emotionally deadening and boring beyond belief.  CITIZEN KANE is an arty film with immense stylistic, bravura flourishes - and even when one is aware of its own artistic awareness, the movie still captivates and enthralls and enriches the viewer.  But with this attempted tone poem of a picture, the artifice reigns supreme and therefore the story and its many messages fall fatally flat. Kubrick's masterpiece 2001 - which this film in reminiscent of in many instances - is also a stylistically self-conscious work.  Yet, as with KANE, the artfulness of the film serves the narrative.  With THE TREE OF LIFE the story - what there is of it - is subservient to the style, the art of it all.  Terrence Malick would do well to adhere to a very great dictum for art of all kinds - and that is that art...should conceal art.  In other words, when I see a movie I don't want to see a movie.  Watching THE TREE OF LIFE I was always aware of the director over my shoulder and behind each and every frame of HIS film. And being cognizant of the artifice, the hoped for experience of the movie became instead an insult to the intelligence.This movie is annoying in so very many ways. How many barely audible whispered voice-overs can one bear?  Apart from their often annoying inaudibility, many times it isn't even clear which character is doing the talking.  How many shots of touching hands against the blue sky underscored by hopefully heavenly music does one have to see to get the point?  How many shots do we need to see of Sean Penn walking around looking as if he is wondering how he even wandered into this movie which makes absolutely no use of his considerable acting talents?  How much of Brad Pitt's self-conscious curl of the lower lip - as if that curled lip is enough to create a credible character - must one withstand?  How many times do we have to see the young Jack look like he is about to discover some great secret to the accompaniment of the movie's also self-conscious score?  And what of laughter?  Levity?  Romance? Sexuality? The sheer Joy of Life?  Life has all of these riches - yet this funereal film, THE TREE OF LIFE, has very little of those elements.  It is dull and lugubrious and in its attempt to grapple with the largest issues of Life, it neglects or forgets or self-consciously deletes so many of the elements that truly make Life analogous to a Tree.Think of a beautiful woman entering a room. She is undoubtedly beautiful - but she knows it and is also obsessively self-conscious with that knowledge.  She is overly perfumed and made-up, jewels everywhere, extravagantly dressed and looking for the nearest mirror so that she might bask in the glory of her own self-love. She goes far in destroying her own beauty with her self-conscious display of it. Now picture another beautiful woman coming into the room. This woman is not overly adorned or perfumed or made-up. Her eyes are the jewels she wears. The difference between the two women is that this one is not so certain of her charms so downplays the outward so as not to feel uncomfortable or seem ridiculous should those unnecessary embellishments diminish what she intrinsically possesses. This woman captivates and ultimately can obsess others because she, herself, is not unduly obsessed by that which she possesses by nature. Well, this movie is akin to the first women in this analogy.  The excessive surface of its outward look hides whatever inner, deeper values might be found therein.This movie's basic premise and design - in the hands of a more all-embracing and much more nuanced and subtle director - may have actually been a great movie.  For example, I had no problem with the storyline's non-linear structure or with bringing dinosaurs into the mix.  As a matter-of-fact, first hearing that this movie made such quantum leaps in its storyline made me want to really see it.  But though the intentions of the movie may have been sublime whilst still a thought, the execution sadly killed any power the finished product may have had.  Thus, to me, THE TREE OF LIFE seems more of a big-budgeted, big-starred student-film inter-cut with home movies and lost footage from 2001 than it does the work of matured and visionary film maker.  All in all, I would rather watch paint peel than have to watch this movie ever again. Better still, I think I'll watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for the umpteenth time!",1,THE TREE OF LIFE...is barren!!!!!!!,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,4711,"['love', 'art', 'films', 'not', 'when', 'am', 'aware', 'art', 'frame', 'film', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'one', 'most', 'self-conscious', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'ponderous', 'pretentious', 'painful', 'mode', 'movie-making', 'evidenced', 'puerile', 'effort', 'intensely', 'irritating', 'emotionally', 'deadening', 'boring', 'belief', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'arty', 'film', 'immense', 'stylistic', 'bravura', 'flourishes', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'aware', 'own', 'artistic', 'awareness', 'movie', 'still', 'enthralls', 'viewer', 'attempted', 'tone', 'poem', 'picture', 'artifice', 'supreme', 'therefore', 'story', 'many', 'messages', 'fall', 'fatally', 'flat', 'Kubrick', 'masterpiece', '2001', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'instances', 'also', 'stylistically', 'self-conscious', 'work', 'Yet', 'KANE', 'artfulness', 'film', 'narrative', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'story', 'what', 'subservient', 'style', 'art', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'adhere', 'very', 'great', 'dictum', 'art', 'kinds', 'art', 'should', 'conceal', 'art', 'other', 'words', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Watching', 'TREE', 'LIFE', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'director', 'shoulder', 'frame', 'HIS', 'film', 'being', 'cognizant', 'artifice', 'hoped', 'experience', 'movie', 'became', 'instead', 'insult', 'intelligence.This', 'movie', 'annoying', 'so', 'very', 'many', 'ways', 'How', 'many', 'barely', 'audible', 'whispered', 'voice-overs', 'can', 'one', 'bear', 'Apart', 'often', 'annoying', 'inaudibility', 'many', 'times', ""n't"", 'even', 'clear', 'character', 'doing', 'talking', 'How', 'many', 'shots', 'touching', 'hands', 'blue', 'sky', 'underscored', 'hopefully', 'heavenly', 'music', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'get', 'point', 'How', 'many', 'shots', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'walking', 'around', 'looking', 'wondering', 'how', 'even', 'wandered', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'use', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'How', 'much', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'self-conscious', 'curl', 'lower', 'lip', 'curled', 'lip', 'enough', 'create', 'credible', 'character', 'must', 'one', 'withstand', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'young', 'Jack', 'look', 'discover', 'great', 'secret', 'accompaniment', 'movie', 'also', 'self-conscious', 'score', 'what', 'laughter', 'Levity', 'Romance', 'Sexuality', 'sheer', 'Joy', 'Life', 'Life', 'riches', 'yet', 'funereal', 'film', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'very', 'little', 'elements', 'dull', 'lugubrious', 'attempt', 'grapple', 'largest', 'issues', 'Life', 'forgets', 'self-consciously', 'deletes', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'truly', 'make', 'Life', 'analogous', 'Tree.Think', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'entering', 'room', 'undoubtedly', 'beautiful', 'also', 'obsessively', 'self-conscious', 'knowledge', 'overly', 'perfumed', 'made-up', 'jewels', 'everywhere', 'extravagantly', 'dressed', 'looking', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'might', 'bask', 'glory', 'own', 'self-love', 'far', 'destroying', 'own', 'beauty', 'self-conscious', 'display', 'Now', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'coming', 'room', 'woman', 'not', 'overly', 'adorned', 'perfumed', 'made-up', 'eyes', 'are', 'jewels', 'difference', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'charms', 'so', 'outward', 'so', 'not', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'should', 'unnecessary', 'embellishments', 'diminish', 'what', 'intrinsically', 'woman', 'ultimately', 'can', 'obsess', 'others', 'not', 'unduly', 'obsessed', 'nature', 'Well', 'movie', 'akin', 'first', 'women', 'analogy', 'excessive', 'surface', 'outward', 'look', 'hides', 'inner', 'deeper', 'values', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'therein.This', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'design', 'hands', 'more', 'all-embracing', 'much', 'more', 'nuanced', 'subtle', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'example', 'had', 'problem', 'storyline', 'non-linear', 'structure', 'bringing', 'dinosaurs', 'mix', 'matter-of-fact', 'first', 'hearing', 'movie', 'made', 'such', 'quantum', 'leaps', 'storyline', 'made', 'want', 'really', 'see', 'intentions', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sublime', 'whilst', 'still', 'thought', 'execution', 'sadly', 'killed', 'power', 'finished', 'product', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'Thus', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'more', 'big-budgeted', 'big-starred', 'student-film', 'inter-cut', 'home', 'movies', 'lost', 'footage', '2001', 'work', 'matured', 'visionary', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'paint', 'peel', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'ever', 'again', 'Better', 'still', 'think', ""'ll"", 'watch', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'umpteenth', 'time']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I saw this movie at a local art house, and I recognized the polarizing effect it has on audiences as soon as I heard someone proclaim ""One and a half stars"" during the credits.  They clearly didn't get it...but neither did I, entirely, although I was mesmerized by the incredible images and, as a child born in the '50s, felt a kinship with its characters.  I'm a big fan of Terrence Malick's other films, particularly ""The New World"" and ""Days of Heaven"", so I knew there would be similar elements in this film, such as the quiet voice-overs expressing the inner monologues of the characters and the gorgeous cinematography.  I was completely unprepared to see DINOSAURS in a Terrence Malick film...and I was admittedly delighted!  This film is more concept than story, although there is a plot; but it unfolds like ""Howard's End"", slowly and without telegraphing its next moves.  When the ending arrives, one is left wondering what just happened. For me, it had a profound impact.  I applaud anyone who thinks they understand this film after the first viewing, because I knew it would require repeated viewings for me to glean its full meaning.  This film is not pretentious in the sense of trying to be something it's not, but it is pretentious in the sense that it demands more than some viewers are prepared to pay. It is enormously enigmatic, and that's what sets it apart from formulaic films that don't require much intellectual thought (mindless entertainment, in other words).

It dares to use life itself as a ""plot"" and connect the dots between the evolution of the cosmos and the evolution of ourselves as people. In our postmodern times of timid filmmaking or mass production of consumerist escapism, Malick's film asks big questions, takes risks with narrative and really challenges the viewer. It is a tapestry of powerful images and memorable performances.The film takes us back to 1950s America, focusing on a family being raised by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. We see them go through the cycles of birth, growth, pain, conflict and the joy and anguish of growing up and feeling the world knock louder and louder at the door. Malick uses a tragic event to provoke one of eternal questions: Why? In a brilliant move the narrative cuts to an epic montage of the creation of the cosmos, showing the apocalyptic birth pangs of the Earth and the Solar System, nature flourishes and creatures appear in sea and then land. This remarkable section, in its mixture of images, science and music deserves comparison with Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" In one memorable scene Dinosaurs are used to express ideas about compassion that make you wonder if Malick has been reading Peter Kropotkin's ""Mutual Aid"" for inspiration. With unique focus Malick makes the connection between the vast landscape of creation with the smaller yet equally big and menacing landscape of a Texas family experiencing the cycles of life.The scenes involving the family in Texas are written and filmed with a unique sense of evoking moods, experiences and people. Here the smallest details are polished to a gloss, there is no traditional movie ""plot"" because life itself is not a scripted affair, possibly only the broadstrokes of being born and learning to walk, and even then. With little dialogue Malick goes back to the roots of ourselves, the experience of being a baby, learning from our parents and their dialectics, feeling innocence being pushed away by the darker realities of the world. Brad Pitt and Chastain give excellent performances. Pitt fully creates a stern man who may seem brutal, but you realize this is the kind of iron discipline mixed with fatherly affection that creates someone like Malick himself (the film is party autobiographical), it is impressive to see how Pitt evokes the inner mechanisms of his character through facial expressions and physical mannerisms. Jessica Chastain here is revealed as an actress of unique grace, evoking a love tempered by life's hurtles. Some complain about the spiritual aspects of the film, but in a film exploring life, why can't it feature one of the eternal topics which mankind has embedded into the deepest core of its societies and cultures: God? And in a film that takes place in the 1950s, it is not out of step to show a family with deep religious roots, it is a basic part of the historic American experience.Malick and his cinematographer, the Mexican maestro Emmanuel Lubezki (Children Of Men, The New World), produce images of wonderous poetry and hypnotic intensity, using natural light like a paint brush. The use of classical music gives the film a grand tone and a special rhythm. Film students in years to come might look at this film in wonder to study its editing technique, the way it is narrative without traditional narrative tricks.""The Tree Of Life"" shames many of today's films simply by doing something truly different. It might even throw off balance those who've admired Malick's earlier work such as ""Days Of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" which featured his unique, poetic style but never pushed the envelope as far as this movie does. In a time when ""daring"" means ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button,"" Malick shows us that the cinema is full of endless possibilities where a director can try to achieve something special, something more profound.

Terrence Malick's films have all dealt in some way with the mystery of existence, the wonder, beauty and awe of nature and the cosmos against the pain of our mortality so rife with suffering, doubt and disappointment.  Malick's long-gestating mystical, maddening, obtuse, brilliant and inspired masterpiece offers no easy answers but is a living tapestry that provides a head-space for a challenging meditation that taps into the big questions of grace, God, evolution and death.On first viewing, I was enthralled and since then have had intense discussions with movie buffs and theologians who loved, hated or were puzzled by this movie that transcends description and definition yet for me remains an emotional and spiritual experience.  The story is simple: A 1950's rural Texas family comes to terms with itself against the ferocious mystery of Creation itself.  Note: The enigmatic writer-director Malick grew up in rural Texas in the same time period as his film.  He studied philosophy at Harvard and was awarded a PhD from Oxford.Perhaps the true meaning of life is in embracing -- and loving -- the mystery?",4,IS THE MEANING OF LIFE FOUND IN EMBRACING THE MYSTERY?,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,1196,"['Discovering', 'meaning', 'life', 'not', 'task', 'faint', 'heart', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'films', 'have', 'dealt', 'way', 'mystery', 'existence', 'wonder', 'beauty', 'awe', 'nature', 'cosmos', 'pain', 'mortality', 'so', 'rife', 'suffering', 'doubt', 'disappointment', 'Malick', 'long-gestating', 'mystical', 'maddening', 'obtuse', 'brilliant', 'inspired', 'masterpiece', 'easy', 'answers', 'living', 'tapestry', 'head-space', 'challenging', 'meditation', 'big', 'questions', 'grace', 'God', 'evolution', 'death.On', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'enthralled', 'then', 'have', 'had', 'intense', 'discussions', 'movie', 'buffs', 'theologians', 'who', 'loved', 'hated', 'were', 'puzzled', 'movie', 'description', 'definition', 'yet', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'story', 'simple', '1950', 'rural', 'Texas', 'family', 'terms', 'ferocious', 'mystery', 'Creation', 'Note', 'enigmatic', 'writer-director', 'Malick', 'grew', 'up', 'rural', 'Texas', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'studied', 'philosophy', 'Harvard', 'was', 'awarded', 'PhD', 'Oxford.Perhaps', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', 'embracing', 'loving', 'mystery']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]
1393005,A3LY692S9YFLUH,B004A8ZX32,Rodney J. Moss,"[12, 23]","That's probably it for Malick and me. 'New World'  already had me sliding in my seat a third of the way in. 'The Tree of Life' had me squirming within forty minutes. I've stuck with him over the journey and regarded his first feature and 'Thin Red Line' with admiration. It seems that his obeisance to Tarkovsky has so overtaken him that he has little to say (though what his cinematic eye expresses in inarguably in the realm of the Sublime). The script aimed at the family drama and subsequent loss of the middle of three sons, is lame to say the least. It gives little room for the actors to move, though the elder pre-teenboy  exerts some screen presence. Little use was made of Sean Penn, as the architect this lad matures into. This brings into question why screen idols were even cast on the project as the leading males never break from their idol status. There's no maturation occuring from the glimpsed family dynamics. Especially absent is the void between the news of the death at the outset and its subsequent effect on the rest of the family.There's half an hour, it seems, of tedious national geographics and a ridiculous spurt of romping dinosaur graphics to evoke Malick's take on creation. Groan. Groan. There's such a disconnect between the sketchy 50s family stuff and the rhapsodic cinema the director gives us in his expression of Evolution which detracts from its lofty ambitions. The pretentious, whispered Big Question voice-overs were simplistic and sentimental. The unashamed Tarkovskian style and direct quoting got up my nose, particularly as they were left as undeveloped effects; the floating mum, her red-headedness, the Job quotation given at the beginning of the film(which smacked of the Russian's well-known fascination with Job); kids looking through rustling, lacey curtains, the over-long study up tree trunks, the dwelling on candles; the list goes on. Really. Michael Haneke has spoken of his own films being a riposte to cinema of this kind.'They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of blase answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and concensus.' Malick, in all likelihood, would consider his work to fill his European counterpart's ambition. 'The Tree of Life' attests otherwise.

1393006,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004A8ZX32,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 8]","Few directors have as instinctive a flair for the art of cinema as Terrance Malick, who is such a perfectionist about his work that he's managed to crank out a mere five feature films in his four decades as a filmmaker.  His films are like glorious odes to nature, much in the tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge - only, in this age of modern technology, he uses images rather than words.  He makes us see the world from a whole new perspective, employing cinematography and music in much the same way as an impressionist uses paint on a canvas.Watching a Malick film - to mix up our metaphors a bit - is a bit like sitting at the edge of the ocean, as wave after wave of indescribably beautiful images washes over you and eventually carries you out to sea.  It really is an experience unlike any other that one can get at the movies.His latest work ""The Tree of Life"" is clearly his magnum opus, the culmination of his career-long obsession with the beauty of nature and mankind's relation to it.  It is also his most overt dissertation to date on the random nature of the universe, as it chronicles a family's struggle to come to grips with the sudden death of their 19-year-old son and brother, R.L.The majority of the film takes place in Waco, Texas in the 1950s, where the oldest son Jack and his two younger brothers, R.L. and Steve, are experiencing a childhood very similar to that of many middle-class Americans of the time.  In fact, when it isn't busy being metaphysical and exploring the mysteries of the universe, ""The Tree of Life"" provides a searing look into suburban family life during that time period.  Indeed, even though the characters don't say much to one another throughout the course of the movie - most of the words come in the form of voiceover narration - each still manages to become a fully realized individual in his or her own right, a character very much of that time but also universal in scope.Mr. O`Brien (Brad Pitt), for instance, is a rather archetypal father figure of the 1950s - an emotionally aloof disciplinarian who finds it so hard to express his feelings for his boys that at one point Jack finds himself wishing for his own father's death.  Yet, O'Brien still displays those rare moments of tenderness that reveal the caring and loving individual that resides at his core.  O'Brien is also struggling with the fact that he has never achieved his dreams either as a musician or as a successful inventor.  This leads to a sense of bitterness and a kill-or-be-killed ethos that not only defines his own life but is the major value he wants to instill in his boys.Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is also a fairly typical 1950s housewife - a generally passive woman utterly consumed with raising her family and defending her boys against the frequent outbursts her husband throws at them.  In a way, she is the yin to Mr. O'Brien's yang, a woman filled with the virtues of understanding and nurturing, who balances out the unyielding rigidness of her husband and gives her sons an alternative path to follow in life.Jack is also a highly complex character, a naturally curious, strong-willed and contemplative young boy who wants desperately to do the right thing but often feels unable to do it.  His strong moral code is frequently at odds with his penchant for mischief and, like all children who are just finding their way, he often chooses the wrong path to go down.  Indeed, the film provides one of the most realistic depictions of childhood I have seen in a long while, capturing the wonderment, fear and sense of exploration that defines that period in life.Sean Penn, in a much smaller role, plays the adult version of Jack, who, even in the present day, is trying to come to grips with his little brother's untimely death.  But it is Hunter McCracken as the young Jack who brings the film to life and makes us care about the character.As with any Malick film, ""The Tree of Life"" derives a tremendous amount of its greatness from its camerawork and sound and, true to form, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and composer Alexandre Desplat provide their customary miracles here.  No other movie quite looks like a Malick film, with its smooth-flowing tracking shots - many following a character from behind - its intimate close-up shots of nature, and its haunting, painterly landscapes.  For this film, Malick has added several scenes depicting the formation of the earth, the evolution of life and the destruction of the planet - all to illustrate the we're-all-interconnected, circle-of-life theme that resides at the movie's core.Yet while ""The Tree of Life"" is certainly Malick's most ambitious work to date, is it also his finest?  I really don't think so.  Even though it is completely mesmerizing as a work of pure cinema - few other directors could even touch it - it exudes a certain self-congratulatory pretentiousness that is missing from what I think are his best films, ""Badlands"" and ""The New World,"" which, on the whole, feel somehow more organic and natural.  In a sense, it's trying so hard to be great - hardly a commonplace sin in American moviemaking - that it actually feels a little off-putting and desperate at times.  Genuine masterpieces - which I believe ""Badlands"" and ""The New World"" to be - don't generally have to work so hard at it.But then again, in this day and of formulaic and soulless commercial moviemaking, we'll take a near-masterpiece any time we can get one.",5,Another (near) masterpiece from Malick,1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,5452,"['Few', 'directors', 'have', 'instinctive', 'flair',

1393009,A2MQOHS98BLAUV,B004A8ZX32,R. P. Jones,"[5, 9]","As many reviewers have pointed out, much of Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" plays out as an apparent homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  It uses similar sweeping visuals of the cosmos and the earthen landscape, a similar narrative structure, similar use of classical music.  Kubrick's opening showed us the dawn of man; Malick's opening shows us the evolution of life, leading us to the central story about a young family in the 1950's.  It is here that Malick's attempt to replicate Kubrick's masterpiece quickly begins to fall apart.When Bowman, Poole, and the HAL 9000 set off aboard the Discovery One in Kubrick's film, they were going - to borrow from ""Star Trek"" - where no man had gone before.  When ""Tree of Life"" takes us inside the lives of a borderline dysfunctional family, we are traveling over very familiar territory.  Consequently, Malick's attempt to tell his story on such a grand scale seems awkward and forced.  His canvas here is simply too big.And there are other problems.  The jumpy hand-held cinematography, fine for music videos or other short subjects, is - over a running time of well over two hours - exhausting to the viewer.  The sparse dialogue and hushed monotones, used in ""2001"" to convey the fear and loneliness of traveling in space, seem to have no real purpose in Malick's film other than to perhaps suggest the disconnection that these family members have to each other.In the end, what ""The Tree of Life"" does is attempt to show us the human family - all of its joys, struggles, loves, losses and regrets - through the widest possible lens and as an answer, I suppose, for the meaning of life.  It is a film that ultimately fails by trying to model itself after a science fiction masterpiece rather than choosing a simpler and more user-friendly approach.",2,Abstract to a Fault,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1819,"['many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'much', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Tree', 'Life', 'out', 'apparent', 'homage', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'similar', 'sweeping', 'visuals', 'cosmos', 'earthen', 'landscape', 'similar', 'narrative', 'structure', 'similar', 'use', 'classical', 'music', 'Kubrick', 'opening', 'showed', 'dawn', 'man', 'Malick', 'opening', 'evolution', 'life', 'leading', 'central', 'story', 'young', 'family', '1950', 'here', 'Malick', 'attempt', 'replicate', 'Kubrick', 'masterpiece', 'quickly', 'fall', 'apart.When', 'Bowman', 'Poole', 'HAL', '9000', 'set', 'off', 'Discovery', 'One', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'were', 'going', 'borrow', 'Star', 'Trek', 'where', 'man', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'When', 'Tree', 'Life', 'lives', 'borderline', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'are', 'traveling', 'over', 'very', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Consequently', 'Malick', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'grand', 'scale', 'awkward', 'forced', 'canvas', 'here', 'simply', 'too', 'big.And', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'jumpy', 'hand-held', 'cinematography', 'fine', 'music', 'videos', 'other', 'short', 'subjects', 'running', 'time', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'exhausting', 'viewer', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'hushed', 'monotones', 'used', '2001', 'convey', 'fear', 'loneliness', 'traveling', 'space', 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'purpose', 'Malick', 'film', 'other', 'perhaps', 'suggest', 'disconnection', 'family', 'members', 'have', 'end', 'what', 'Tree', 'Life', 'attempt', 'show', 'human', 'family', 'joys', 'struggles', 'loves', 'losses', 'regrets', 'widest', 'possible', 'lens', 'answer', 'suppose', 'meaning', 'life', 'film', 'ultimately', 'trying', 'model', 'science', 'fiction', 'masterpiece', 'rather', 'choosing', 'simpler', 'more', 'user-friendly', 'approach']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

It is not really a movie in the traditional sense, or a pretentious attempt at trying to infuse big name actors with an art-house drama, it's something new, something different. I can't explain this movie in words because a simplistic description would not do it justice. This isn't a film for the monkey brain, it's a film for the soul. I was emotionally stirred by this movie because it is a visualization of what I have only known as thoughts and contemplation.This movie came to me at a time in my life when I have begun a phase of embracing close personal introspection and I really want to get beyond the materialism that I've been enculturated to believe is so important. I want simplicity and happiness, I don't want the big house and the credit cards, I want a simple life in a simple place where I can focus on living my life. This movie is a statement that even though we as individuals feel so important in our self-centered lives and feel worthy of the attention of the universe, there are processes that are far greater than us in the expanse of the universe. The film doesn't superimpose any kind of belief about religion unto the viewer, it remains respectful and open for individual interpretation. This movie doesn't hijack your thoughts and tell you what the story is, in fact, this movie is more synchronous with imagination than any other I have seen. The crescendo of this movie is the God/universe scene which is one of the most spectacular cinematic sequences I have ever witnessed, I wept while watching it.I don't recommend this movie as a casual rental or something the family will enjoy. It's one of those movies that requires attention and a time when your mind and your life can be quiet for a couple of hours and you want to have an emotional experience rather than be superficially entertained.My favorite line from the film that resonated the most and seems to underscore the intention of the film was ""there are two ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace.

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[3, 6]","As I sat through this film, I felt that there were moments of unparalleled, shimmering beauty surrounded by a film that was way too pretentious.There's hardly any dialogue,no sense of narraration or story,the Sean Penn chacter is baffling and useless,the ending really had no climax,the relationship between Brad Pitt (father) and Jessica Chastain (mother) is minimized,The creation of the universe/dinosaur montage made no sense andthere were too many Discovery Channel/nature montages.Walking out of the theater, I had negative feelings about the film.However, I thought about this film that evening and the next day. It made me reminisce about my childhood and upbringing. Although the film takes place in Waco, Texas, it could have been anytown America, circa 1955-1975...my era. I grew up in the 60's and 70's and this film did strike a very emotional chord with me. It reminded me of my childhood, in a manner, that no other film has come close to. It captured moments of;The elation and jealousy of getting a baby sibling;The mischievous playing with matches and the adventure of first encountering firecrackers;The excitement of going into a downtown area/business district (before the era of strip shopping malls and convenience stores);The innocent strange and creepy sensation of first encountering a handicap person;The excitement of playing in a suburban neighborhood and running through the yards;The sheer joy of swimming or running through sprinklers on a hot day;The special bond formed between brothers of a close age;This film brilliantly made cinematic ""rites of passage"" that are a common denominator among us baby boomers (It would be hard for a person that grew up in an urban environment or generation X and Y to empathize with this).I honestly do not know, exactly, what this film was about. Brad Pitt was excellent as an Eisenhower-era suburban Dad. In today's eyes, he would be viewed as too stern and abusive however, he was dead on accurate as to how a man thought he was supposed to act during that era. As realistic as Pitt's character was, Jessica Chastain was the opposite since her character was played as a mythical beauty, a representative of pure grace. In the beginning of the movie, they learn that their 19 year old was killed (presumably ...in Vietnam?) and the rest of the movie goes back to when everybody was young and the movie simply ponders ...LIFE.This is not an easy movie to absorb. While many parts were brutally ponderous (the creation of the universe sequence lasts... like... 20 minutes, creating a very unneccessary break in the drama) most of the scenes, even if they did not work, were nontheless captivating.In hindsight, this movie is very daring because it has sequences of absolute, unequaled beauty and tenderness yet the film never feels that it has to explain itself or any aspect of what is going on. This is an unapologetic ""take it or leave it"" piece of art that is simply on celluloid.I changed my feeling about this movie because it stuck with me in a manner that no other film has done...and therefore, it achieved it's job. This is flawed yet director Terrance Malick's flaws are incompareable to the play it safe films that make the rounds. This film can only be appreciated by a parton that views movies as an ""art form"".NOTE, this film is compared to ""2001, a Space Odyssey"" but this is nothing like that, Kubrick's movie is much more cohesive with the ""Star Child"" ending being very pragmatic compared to lack of struture in this film.

1393017,A2VM2PGEJQ7FSW,B004A8ZX32,Scott W. Bryant,"[8, 8]","How to explain a Terence Malick film to someone who has never seen one?  All at once, they are poetic, rapturous, maddening, illuminating, and even, perhaps, in a few choice moments, a bit pretentious. But one thing is for sure.  No matter what else you one might be tempted to say about a film by this man, you can never say that it is ... expected. Enter Malick's latest offering: The Tree of Life.  Lacking anything that could be conventionally described as a clear or linear storyline, the director, instead, seems utterly content to film a visual meditation on the themes of creation and evolution, fathers and sons, faith and doubt.  It is a story about a particular family rooted in a particular culture, but it's larger than that, more ambitious in its reach.  Perhaps the best way to say it is to say that while this is the story of a family set in the 1950s, it is also the timeless story of humanity and its' God.In his book entitled Faith of the Fatherless: The Psychology of Atheism, psychologist Paul Vitz puts forth an argument in which he suggests that severe disappointment with one's biological father often leads to an individual rejecting the concept of a heavenly Father.  Tracing both the histories of prominent atheists as well as prominent theists, Vitz turns Freud's projection theory of religion on its head, as he makes a compelling case for a correlation between our willingness to conceive of a God that cares and our experiences with fathers that may or may not.In many ways, The Tree of Life is an almost prayerful examination of Vitz's central thesis, filled with wondrous moments of staggering beauty and wrenching snapshots of belittling pain.  And in the end, you can almost hear the words of the Apostle Paul echoing through the narrated voiceover:  ""There are two ways in life: the way of nature and the way of grace.  You have to choose which one you'll follow.""I highly recommend The Tree of Life as one of the most audacious and profound films released in this new millennium.Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.",5,The Tree of Life: A One-Minute Film Review,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2078,"['How', 'explain', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'once', 'are', 'poetic', 'rapturous', 'maddening', 'illuminating', 'even', 'perhaps', 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'matter', 'what', 'else', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'say', 'film', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'say', 'expected', 'Enter', 'Malick', 'latest', 'offering', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Lacking', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'conventionally', 'described', 'clear', 'linear', 'storyline', 'director', 'instead', 'utterly', 'content', 'film', 'visual', 'meditation', 'themes', 'creation', 'evolution', 'fathers', 'sons', 'faith', 'doubt', 'story', 'particular', 'family', 'rooted', 'particular', 'culture', 'larger', 'more', 'ambitious', 'reach', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'way', 'say', 'say', 'story', 'family', 'set', '1950s', 'also', 'timeless', 'story', 'humanity', 'God.In', 'book', 'entitled', 'Faith', 'Fatherless', 'Psychology', 'Atheism', 'psychologist', 'Paul', 'Vitz', 'forth', 'argument', 'severe', 'disappointment', 'one', 'biological', 'father', 'often', 'individual', 'rejecting', 'concept', 'heavenly', 'Father', 'Tracing', 'histories', 'prominent', 'atheists', 'as', 'well', 'prominent', 'theists', 'Vitz', 'Freud', 'projection', 'theory', 'religion', 'head', 'compelling', 'case', 'correlation', 'willingness', 'conceive', 'God', 'experiences', 'fathers', 'may', 'may', 'not.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Tree', 'Life', 'almost', 'prayerful', 'examination', 'Vitz', 'central', 'thesis', 'filled', 'wondrous', 'moments', 'staggering', 'beauty', 'wrenching', 'snapshots', 'belittling', 'pain', 'end', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'words', 'Apostle', 'Paul', 'echoing', 'narrated', 'voiceover', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'life', 'way', 'nature', 'way', 'grace', 'have', 'choose', 'one', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Tree', 'Life', 'one', 'most', 'audacious', 'profound', 'films', 'released', 'new', 'millennium.Further', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bloodstainedink.wordpress.com']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I'm not looking to be distracted from life, I am looking to feel it more fully.  I like films and books that stretch me.  Five or ten minutes into this movie, I thought I was going to be one of those who got so bored they couldn't watch it.  I loved the images, but it hadn't penetrated inside me enough to hold me.  Later on I was thinking I could take my attention away to do something else, but in fact I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  The unfolding story had gotten into me, taken hold of me, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of what I was seeing and feeling.  I did pause it finally, but only because the intensity was too much for me--I needed to take a break and absorb it before going back.  After an hour or so I came back and finished it.I didn't get that this was a story about a dysfunctional family.  What I saw was a man who loved his family--it came through in everything he did--but also had a lot of pressure to take care of them, which conflicted with his own dreams.  As he said, he never missed a day of work, he tithed every week.  Yet, things went awry.  His beliefs collided with reality.  I saw a woman, who exemplified the female philosophy, at a time--in the '50s--when women didn't carry the pressure of providing financially for a family.  Their job was to nurture the family, and she did a good job of it.  To me, this movie was about a functional family, one that loved through the dreams and the sorrows, and that was the triumph of life in the end.  Many have said: to know that love is all there is, is all there is to know.  I didn't mind the ""disjointed"" stuff, because that's the way thoughts are--that's the only story in this moment, there is no past or future--the past is gone and the future never comes. Just thoughts about it.  Thoughts can be changed, and thus everything can be healed in the present moment.Brave.  Excellent job.

1393026,A1DHFQP9G5F7LY,B004A8ZX32,Stephen C. Bird,"[3, 6]","Terence Malick's ""The Tree of Life""  is about as good as it gets in terms of an American film with avant-garde qualities destined for wide distribution.  And so I can understand why it won the Palme D'Or because it was a wholly American picture that simultaneously transcends that very category by way of its universal appeal.  Generally the cinematography is stunning--This is a great film to look at--Whatever one ends up thinking about the content.  A number of themes are juxtaposed resulting in a picture that wants to have it both ways--IE ""Life is beautiful and mysterious and we're all connected""--Yet concurrently--""You'd better be tough, strong and Machiavellian or you're not going to make it in this world--Nice guys finish last"".  Or: ""There is so much beauty in this world.  Therefore one has no excuse not to make something of themselves.""  In the process the film goes back in time in its exploration of Darwinian themes--IE a scene featuring a wounded, bleeding dinosaur at the edge of the beach while hammerhead sharks hover nearby; elucidating the fact that in nature the weaker creatures are left behind to die; the more fragile among us are more likely not to survive.  Secondly--God is a legitimate force in the lives of this 1950s Texan family that is the focus of this picture.  In one scene--Mrs. O'Brien points to the sky and tells her son ""That's where God lives"".  The world of the dinosaurs is destroyed by a comet--God decides to take back what he has created.  Just as God decides to take back Mrs. O'Brien's son.  By having faith one can justify the irrationality of Nature.  Similarly, Mr. O'Brien's tough-love / borderline abuse of his son Jack is also justified by this film.  Which works in the end because although tormented, the older Jack (Sean Penn) ends up being what appears to be a very successful architect with all the accoutrements of success--Jack is truly his father's son.Highlights of ""The Tree of Life"" include the state-of-the-art / influenced by ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" visuals--They do lend credence to the way this film explores age-old philosophical and spiritual questions.  Whereas ""2001"" is cold, bleak and sinister--""Tree of Life"" tells the viewer that we're all in this together.  For almost all of the picture I was drawn in by Malick's vision--The coming of age story; the superbly created cosmic visuals accentuating the process of mourning and the resulting contemplation of the universe and the meaning of it all.  But then near the end of the film comes a sequence featuring many people wandering around on the beach.  While I found some of it to be moving--It was also the weakest section of the picture.  Here I could see influences from Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and ""La Dolce Vita""--Groups of people near the ocean in awe of the mystery of life.  But in the end, this sequence made me recall the ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"" Coca Cola commercials from circa 40 years ago.  In this ""Magical Mystery Beach Scene""--Even the boy with the burned scalp (representing the Misfit / Outcast) who is viewed with suspicion by the neighborhood boys for his ""difference""--Will be loved--If only by his mother.  Because again--""We're all in this together""--And so compassion is possible.  Regardless of its ever-changing hues--This film is ultimately hopeful.  Near the end of the picture there is a shot of a field of sunflowers; all of those flowers are beautiful.  By means of this image Malick is telling us by this--That we humans are all beautiful too.Stephen C.

1393027,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B004A8ZX32,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[9, 12]","As you can see by the ratings here, this is a very divisive film, with very few opinions falling ""in the middle."" I can fully understand and appreciate why so many found it difficult to sit through. On the one hand, it is a frustrating film in that there is no real narrative to cling to - and nothing resembling a traditional scene until nearly 50 minutes in!On the other hand, it is... beautiful... that word, beautiful, just seems inadequate.. but I really can't think of a more fitting word. If you are unable to view this in HD, you really might do better to put it off until you can.The narrative, sparse as it is, opens with news that the middle child of a family has died. After several scenes of grief, we get a nearly 20 minute rendering of the creation of the cosmose, set to a gorgeous choral piece. Following the cosmic creation, we next see the individual creation of a boy, and will follow him from birth through to his mid-teens. It is at this age that the movie settles into a narrative flow as we see this eldest son, Jack, and his growing resentment toward his father and his uneven parenting. We are basically hovering like an observing angel as we watch Jack's first steps into adulthood... his loss of innocence, his sexual awakening, and his first mature realization of who his dad really is... in a manner that fuses both disillusionment and atonement...The photography, natural lighting, location, everything coalesces into a seamless portrait of a decade gone by. Nothing about this movie feels like a modern day crew shooting a period piece ... every shot, every scene from the 50s feels absolutely authentic.The themes of grace and nature and how they converge in a child coming of age are expertly expressed through the imagery, the jarring edit, and the exquisite preamble sequence of the creation of the universe.The way imagery tells the story, rather than verbose writing, sets this apart from almost any other movie I've ever seen. You don't have to listen to the father explain that he's losing connection with his family, you SEE it happen. You don't have to hear the children explain that one-by-one they have distanced themselves from their father, you SEE it happen!The way the edit jumps from moment to moment ... unconnected in sequence, yet we can still make the coherent connections ourselves... makes this the SINGLE BEST PORTRAYAL OF MEMORY I've seen in film! This movie absolutely plays like your own memory of childhood does, and not a ""here's what happened, then this happened, then that happened, and now you know the story of my youth.""Pitt and Chastain play their respective parts with perfect subtlty - a credit to the actors, but also to Malick, the writer and director. It would have been easy to create an image of an overly abusive father, but Pitt's character is much more complex. He's not a bad man by any stretch, but he is flawed. He tries his best to love his children and raise them properly - but he also takes out his own feelings of inadequacy on them - not physically, but emotionally. It's a role that would be easy to overdo by any other actor, but Pitt manages expertly.Chastain, meanwhile, represents the presence of grace - a safe haven for the children - and a better piece of casting I cannot imagine - her face is the face of MOTHER. Loving, accepting, unjudging, even in anger...If the film has a flaw, it is in its inability to postively connect the events of the 50s to those of the 70s and the present day - and maybe this would be rectified in a second viewing - but after I finished the film, I felt that there were two narratives here, with the sequence of the 50s being the chief story. The secondary one is the ""frame"" story, if you will, of R.L.'s death, which opens the film. As I watched the movie unfold, I figured we were going to see the moments leading up to his death. But it is later revealed he died as a 19 year old, an age which we never see him. This event, though it powers the first 30 minutes of the movie, ultimately has no bearing on anything that you see. It felt like a last minute inclusion - a way to open on an emotional note. But, the movie is really about Jack and his memory of his parents, and NOT about R.L.Now, as a Christian, I can see how the death in the beginning and the repeated refrain of ""where were you"" asked toward God leads seamlessly into the story of creation, as it does in the biblical book of Job, a quote of which we see in the opening of the film. But, the average viewer is not going to get this connection - and I felt the movie could have skipped the death/grief sequence and not been any the weaker. I think that time could have been better focused on creating a more coherent storyline for Sean Penn's portrayal of the adult Jack.But, as I said, perhaps a second viewing will change my mind. In any event, it isn't a big enough weakness to detract from what is otherwise a VERY powerful experience!Know going in that this is NOT a movie about narrative - there is no beginning, middle, end... no protagonist/antagonist... this is about feeling an emotion, experiencing a memory, and connecting to the larger force that is God and Creation. If that isn't something you are ready for, then do not bother watching this movie - you'll simply walk away thinking it the most pretentious piece of indie art-house indulgence.Also know going in that this is NOT a movie that can be watched if you are distracted by anything - this is a movie that you need to clear about 2 and a half hours and watch uninterrupted. Probably best to watch it alone, so there is no risk of your fellow viewers talking during the experience. And as I said, watch it on Blu-Ray... THIS IS A MUST!It's a shame Malick produces movies at such a slow rate, but if that's what it takes to work at this level, then so be it. This is the first of his I've seen, and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing his other works, few as they are.",5,"An exquisitely beautiful film that must be viewed, not as a narrative, but as a

When the credits rolled though, I had my expectations of sound and picture exceeded in ways I had not even thought to foresee.Skipping the analogies and descriptions of those much wiser than me that analyze the depths of comprehension they all try to obtain in what he made here, I will stick with a product description. The picture clarity is without hesitation one of the best overall preservation pieces I have seen along any spectrum of what this film records: facial close-ups, skylines, spacial explorations, nature, urbanscapes, tears, moving water, dinosaurs, etc. I pause checked each variety of representations and could not find any faults - point being that he obviously had the budget when making this film, so this BD can prove the worth of your home theater whether testing lights, darks, movement or line clarity.The 7.1 sound immerses even more than Thin Red Line, to such a point that I wish I could include a picture I took of the opening frame that stated (for the first time that I know of in film): ""For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu Ray recommend you play it loud"". I played it extremely loud and have never been so pleased in how every single channel was used perfectly.The supplements are scant, but the main inclusion should almost be watched first to help one with understanding what is being presented here. I showed this 29-minute piece to several viewers first and I actually found that there was a better comprehension and appreciation for what he was doing here than watching it without any foreknowledge. The 2nd disc is a bare bones DVD converted down to 5.1 Dolby. Disc 3 is a standard Dig Copy.

1393029,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B004A8ZX32,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[18, 23]","""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""This verse of Scripture from the book of Job opens Terrence Malick's latest masterpiece, entitled The Tree of Life. After these words appear over a black screen and fade out into the darkness, a mysterious flame illuminates the center of the screen, followed by a distant voice which breaks the silence - ""Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to Your door.""Thus begins the most beautiful and complex film that you are likely to see this decade. It is not a film in the traditional sense of the word. This is not a plot-driven film. What we have here is the journey of life in words and images - a prayer to God which questions His motives, which longs to understand Him, which calls upon Him, and yearns to be near Him at all times.The film follows Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) on the anniversary of his younger brother's death. Jack, a skilled architect, is disillusioned with the world around him. ""The world has gone to the dogs"", Jack ponders, as he stares blankly out of the window of a high-rise building. Jack leaves his office and prays to God - ""When did you first touch my heart?"" Almost immediately, we are whisked back and forth, through past, present, and beyond, to the creation of the galaxies and the Earth, to the brief reign of the dinosaurs and the beginning of human existence, until, finally, we reach ""the end of time"".Throughout the film, we revisit Jack's tormented childhood in rural Texas in the 1950s. We are introduced to his family, led by his parents (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain). His angelic mother teaches Jack and his two brothers the ways of grace (love, forgiveness), while his father represents the way of nature (selfishness, greed). These conflicting worldviews serve as a catalyst for Jack's spiritual and existential struggle, which drives the second act of the film.Mind you, this synopsis does the film no justice. This film cannot be defined in simplistic terms, nor can it be categorized into any specific genre. This is a film that defies convention. It redefines the way that we experience cinema. It is alive, full of wonder and awe. It is poetry. As a friend of mine said after the first screening, this film is a force. It will be a different experience for each individual. You will get out of this film exactly what you bring to it. For me, it is quite possibly the most spiritually significant experience that I have ever had in a theatre. It allowed me to see God portrayed in a way that is respectful, unique and all-encompassing. The grace and mercy of God saturates every frame of this film. Every element - from the beautiful and haunting imagery, to the ethereal soundtrack, to the understated performances, to the philosophical musings on faith and existence - comes together in perfect harmony to create an unforgettable work of art. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the direction from Terrence Malick is as perfect as ever.

Chastain and Pitt are brilliant,the boys acting is superb.Malik's filming is like a chant of Homer's bard.This enhanced tone and elevation of subject-matter has a kind of unity and heroism.",4,"Look backward,Angel.",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2830,"['Tree', 'Life', 'tells', 'title', 'what', 'expect.It', 'calls', 'mind', 'one', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'Attenborough', '20', 'minutes', 'go', 'back', 'formation', 'Earth', 'fires', 'sun,1st', 'stirrings', 'life', 'cells', 'sea', 'roaring', 'waters', 'jelly', 'are', 'images', 'spate', 'whole', 'Niagaras', 'them.In', 'rest', 'film', 'are', 'moments', 'captured', '1st', 'time', 'butterfly', 'alighting', 'Mrs', 'O', 'Brien', 'hand', 'glint', 'sunlight', 'river', 'trees', 'touch', 'exultant', 'running', 'satin', 'chemise.This', 'memoir', 'own', 'childhood', 'child', 'eye-view.Malik', 'mythology', 'Paradise', 'Fall', 'Man', 'Book', 'Job.Its', 'main', 'subject', 'family', 'mother', 'father', '3', 'sons', 'life', 'suburban', 'Waco', 'Texas.He', 'archetypal', 'roles', 'mother', 'grace', 'selfish', 'striving', 'Nature', 'children', 'worship', 'peacful', 'nurturing', 'pre-Raphaelite-like', 'mother', 'form', 'image', 'floating', 'magical', 'realism', 'light', 'dress', 'hair', 'balletic', 'movement.We', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'plot-line', 'hang', 'images', 'what', 'receive', 'great', 'film-maker', 'search', 'material', 'capturing', 'certain', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'America', 'peak', 'power', 'tracking', 'shots', 'wind-waving', 'grass', 'Vermeerish', 'light', 'windows', 'whispered', 'quasi-poetic', 'narration', 'tree-canopies', 'splintering', 'sun', 'magic', 'hour', 'duskiness', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Lubezki.Malik', 'stays', 'close', 'boys', 'particular', 'Hunter', 'McCracken', 'discontented', 'Jack', 'Laramie', 'Eppler', 'doomed', 'favourite', 'middle', 'son', 'R.L', '.Jack', 'rebellion', 'embittered', 'Pitt', 'dad', 'disappointed', 'musician', 'working', 'oil', 'company', 'severe', 'strictness', 'everybody', 'hot', 'temper', 'wedge', 'household.We', 'are', 'drawn', 'vortex', 'half-whispered', 'prayer-like', 'questioning', 'coming', 'adult', 'Jack', 'Penn', 'present', 'mother', 'father', 'past.What', 'avoidance', 'drama', 'cf', 'Bergman', 'Allen', 'versions', 'due', 'evident', 'talent', 'Malik', 'celebrating', 'what', 'precious', 'life', 'place', 'father', 'modern', 'American', 'film', 're-enacting', 'fall', 'mankind', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'situated', '50s', 'suburban', 'America.He', 'gracious', 'cinema', 'longing', 'regret.The', 'end', 'grandiose', 'uniting', 'present', 'past', 'selves', 'dead', 'living', 'loved', 'ones', 'vast', 'beach', 'liturgical', 'chorus', 'considering', 'mystery', 'own', 'birth', 'returning', 'primordial', 'ooze.This', 'feels', 'clunkily', 'over-symbolic.What', 'remains', 'implanted', 'memory', '1950s', 'material', 'making', 'up', 'bulk', 'running', 'time', 'staged', 'enthralling', 'tactile', 'atmospheric', 'detail', 'Chastain', 'Pitt', 'are', 'brilliant', 'boys', 'acting', 'superb.Malik', 'filming', 'chant', 'Homer', 'bard.This', 'enhanced', 'tone', 'elevation', 'subject-matter', 'kind', 'unity', 'heroism']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

Excuse me? This director is such a control freak that he wants to manipulate my home video experience with sensitivity for neither the nearness of the neighbors nor my audio system's potential to inflict physical pain?Get real, you barmy old dude. It is out of your hands now.A more sympathetic observer ventured that Malick worries about us missing a single syllable of the airy voice over. In that case, he needed to speak with his sound editor much earlier, not me, and especially needed to rattle the cages of the studio apes who routinely ignore all meter level readings during the transfer to digital video. [Incidentally, the transfer techs' negligence is even more appalling when they mix down a streaming version.]This inability to let go reveals a justifiable insecurity that his audience might just as soon give the excess grandiosity of rumbling molten lava and similar auditory bombast a miss. That ill-advised level-setting directive tipped me resolutely away from being agnostic about Malick's genius (one gets why some admire him so intensely) into derision for his megalomania. Raging against God is not proof of a profound spirituality, but rather of a narcissistic religiosity, its paradoxical opposite.Yes, everyone agrees the cinematography is lovely, but that audio control trip tainted even my inclination to indulge the DP when he drifts into fey or overly contrived imagery a tad too often, overreaching the picture's distinct visual tone with notes ringing false and/or falling flat. One loathes such maladroit attempts to manipulate the emotions. In good movies, it's a seamless pleasure to surrender to the flow. When that becomes forced & overwrought, I resist & resent.A last note: People talk about Malick as a uniquely American giant of the cinema. Clearly these folks have never been exposed to the metaphysical meditations of Andrei Tarkovsky, easily the greatest Russian filmmaker since Eisenstein (or ever), and from whom the entire last sequence of Tree of Life is lifted virtually intact.

I agree wholeheartedly that the film is too long and the editors could have easily sliced out a good thirty minutes and not damaged the movie at all. It DOES drag on in places, and some of it is just too obscure and metaphorical.  In fact, I totally expected to hate this film after reading some of the reviews in advance.  Then someone, somewhere reviewed The Tree of Life and wrote that Brad Pitt's character and Jessica Chastain's character (mom and dad in the movie) represent the two equal natures (perceptions?) of God:  the strong disciplinarian and the loving, forgiving, nurturing Giver of grace.  If viewed from that perspective from the get-go, the movie tends to make a lot more sense, especially in light of the mother's opening monologue in which she talks about each person's choice between nature and grace.  In fact, I was shocked to see how many Scriptural references there actually are in this movie, especially since Brad Pitt and Sean Penn have always presented themselves as stridently anti-Christian and anti-religion.  Obviously the very first shot of the quote from the Book of Job is a reference to the Bible; however, there are others. **SPOILER ALERT***  For example, at one point, young Jack is reflecting on his own bad behavior and says, ""The things I want to do I can't do, and what I don't want to do, I keep on doing,"" or words to that effect.  This is reminiscent of Paul's remarks in Romans 7 in the New Testament.  Young Jack is confused and frustrated by his own sinfulness (bullying, animal cruelty, vandalism, breaking and entering, stealing, etc.) and says, ""I want to be back where they are,"" meaning his younger brothers and their friends, who are still fairly innocent and naive.  I also respect how the film deals with the faith-shattering disillusionment that often comes as a result of terrible tragedy.  The characters ask God, ""Where are you?  Are you even here?""  Jack remarks that, ""You call to me; I've always known it was you, but I have turned away from you.""  These are all very valid responses, and very realistic.  Before everyone gets all bent out of shape, I am NOT saying the movie is a Christian allegory or that it is proselytizing in any way.  However, there is a definite spiritual element to the film, and it actually fits very well with the absolutely stunning visual imagery (creation, random destruction, etc.).  Does Sean Penn's character die at the end, or is he only dreaming?  That's not entirely clear, but we do hear a steady beeping (heart monitor?) in the background which eventually fades out as he crosses through a portal and then ""reunites"" with members of his family from long ago. A reference to the afterlife?  Maybe. It's not a bad film, just poorly edited, in my very humble opinion.  The dinosaurs kind of trivialized it, and I know Mom floating under the tree (her ethereal, lighthearted forgiving essence?) made people cringe.  All in all, I may have to check out Terence Malick's other movies.  This one was very intriguing.",4,Even I'm surprised I liked it.

I am a big fan of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, both are excellent actors and in particular, Brad Pitt's abilities are on display in this film.The cinematography is excellent and ethereal at times, real craftsmanship here.I like that the film has a post-Christian slant to it, that it displays a sense that much of what life is about, and what makes life possible is outside of the realm of Religion. But the film really dances around the subject. Its a tease that won't offend.Now, for the problems, I was really disappointed. The film is too long and too slow moving. Also, I have a problem with films that try to ""say something"" like this movie does. Life isn't fair, Life isn't a Disneyland visit, so what? Things could be worse. The film centers around the experiences of a young Boy, the eldest of 4 boys. So he's spoiled as the only child at first, then by about 3 years of age another brother arrives. This ""loss"" seems to cause him grief and ends up being an excuse for all sorts of weird thoughts and actions.

The film tells you to turn up the sound so you can hear all the first person narration. When their son dies at the age of 19 parents cope with the loss and question their faith, but not severely question their faith that would alter their life style. After the characters are introduced, we still see Sean Penn doesn't own a comb. The film digresses into a Discovery Channel special which condenses the modern version of creation of 14.7 billion years into about 12 minutes. I felt like we had passed into the monolith.We now start all over with the birth of the children. Hey, we already know one dies. There are things that are whispered. These are meant to be ideas or questions for God. Brad Pitt metaphorically represents the ""tough love"" God who prepares us for life's journey without us realizing it. Hence we have the macrocosm and microcosm in our tale. One could assume that the microcosm of our life is reflective of our theological views, we carve out a tough love God based upon our tough love ""Father"". At one point in the movie Brad Pitt insists his son call him ""Father"" and never ""Dad."" Having lived in the south, that is a no-no. ""Father"" is reserved for the heavenly Father. That is a hint of the symbolism. A sermon stresses the book of Job and asks, ""Is the scheme of life a fraud?""Not for everyone. I was very bored until I figured out what they were attempting to do.

Innocents die, Pitt's character sucks, how does G-d allow this? Primary source of annoyance with the movie is a growing sense of ""self importance."" It starts off visually cool enough (and continues with many good shots cinematic-wise). Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are cast as Pitt the father and Sean the fast-forward to grownup older son who takes the brunt of Brad Pitt's poor fathering as a child, amidst a CGI / Hubel telescoping the idea of creation and ""G-d."" The questions it lays out are deep, existential, universal and monumental, but its idea of itself as a vehicle to comprehend, handle and execute answers to these serious, everlasting questions about G-d and fate and death-to-innocents is what makes the movie weak. The boy's pubescent obsession with lingerie and his admission that he is now cut off from G-d (cause he masturbated on his neighbor's lingerie(?)) would have been places a deep thinker might stop and explore, not touch on and run from. The last 5 minutes were particularly brutal in their demand we stay around for this - as the writers and producers took that last big dose of amphetamine-like pretension - and added a combo of every silly Hollywood notion of how ""we all meet in the afterlife to walk into the ocean together now that we see how silly we've all been"" ending, and for the last ten minutes of the film, as the music swelled with each long fade, I found myself whimpering aloud, ""please be over, please...""It's worth seeing to understand where the bar is within Hollywood's understanding of the deeper things in life. It did make great use of cinematic technique, so from a technical point of view it was edgy and creative. To have Sean Penn wandering around at the beginning, with just a hint of what his own loss was... you just know it's bad.... But ultimately it's not sustainable, and I dont think you can blame the audience for not appreciating it.

1393040,A3RJU10Z0LMIV,B004A8ZX32,Thinker3,"[4, 8]","There's a good description of the film in the trailer, and the movie as whole does not contain much more dialogue.  The theme of the film is the struggle between nature and grace/love and the ultimate triumph of the latter.  Love triumphs because it links together all things, overcoming spatial and temporal connections and, ultimately, death.  The mother, who looks like she was modeled on a character in a Botticelli painting, represents love, the father nature.  The central event of the film, the death of a son at age 19, is never portrayed or explained. It cannot be explained, of course; yet, it belongs to nature, apparently, the realm of the rational. This is one of several failures of nature, failures that are shown here without explanations.  The father is a success engineer (yet he considers himself a failure); his son an architect.  The static straight lines of the products of their professions are juxtaposed with the flowing curves of sand and sea.  Ultimately, there is a kind of synthesis, a doorway separate from all else on a beach.  Here, the architect belongs to nature, but I think the point is that even his work, taken in the proper way, can be a doorway to eternity.  Though each stage of nature is transient, the whole is eternal and, thereby, pervaded with grace (love)--if we can but see it.  The film ends with a scene that again imitates a renaissance painting--the cast in positions on a beach--all together, all apart--in an eternal love.

The movie starts out very mysteriously with an out of focus shot that almost looks like a child's fort under a bed sheet with a mumbled whispering going on all around us. At this point the movie just lost me. The film is not linear so what appears to be a storyline just becomes random shots of this family on any given day. At one point the mother in the film gets a telegram telling her one of her sons in dead ... I don't know which one nor at this point do I care. Sean Penn comes on screen as one of the brothers grown up and he mumbles something about his brother being dead (which had to have happen 30 years prior) and then he does a lot of aimless staring. All of a sudden he's on a beach ... there is a door. He walks through it and at that point we see what had to have been at least 30 minutes of the creation. Planets and suns being born in a cosmic opera ... at this point I'm really fighting sleep. The music and the darkness in the theatre mixed with my complete confusion made shut down. If it weren't for me thinking about getting lunch I probably would have had about a two hour nap.When we came back from the Hubble telescope free for all we got more boring moments in this families life for what felt like hours. I'm not really sure what this thing was about and i don't care. I've read other critics thoughts on this and many are glowing on what a master filmmaker Terrence Malik is but I don't see it. I'm not a fan of any of his previous work and after my torturous afternoon, I never will be. I can't come up with any BS about how he toys with our imagination and that's why he's a genesis ... I have to go the way of the Emperor's New Clothes. I can't fake praise for this film. I can't pull some clever comments out of my ass to make it sound like I felt his art. I have to call it for what it is ... a turd.

It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things."" An art-house movie that has some very religious undertones. When news of his son's death reaches him, Mr O'Brian (Pitt) begins to reflect over his life and how he treated his family. Jack (Penn) does the same and does what he can to attempt to restore his relationship with his father. This is not a movie for everybody. This movie is filled with symbolism and I am not smart enough to understand all of it. The first half is basically just showing life in various stages (you will see what I mean when you watch it). When it gets to the scenes with Brad Pitt it begins to pick up, but still is slow. I'd compare it to the ""Fountain"" in the fact that the movie seemed to be artsy & overly intelligent for the sake of being artsy & overly intelligent. When a movie tries to hard like this one seemed to do it ends up seeming pretentious. Overall, very deliberate moving and full of symbolism that was hard to grasp all of it.

1393048,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B004A8ZX32,Tristan,"[14, 20]","The last day in July is probably significant to many because it happens to be Harry Potter's birthday. To allow you all to completely ignore our collective nerdiness, we'll mention that this was also the day we saw The Tree of Life. Every now and then, there comes a film that completely knocks your socks off--The Tree of Life was that film for us. You could say that we expected to like it (or even felt that we had better  like it after having to deal with the excessive hype for so long. Luckily, we were not disappointed. Suffice it to say that we had what major cinephiles and those who happen to cheat death call an experience. The audience we sat with at our tiny little cinema was just as in awe of it as we were. We sat there silently, our eyes glued to the screen. By film's end, some were crying--yes, us included. Some walked out without saying anything at all, the dazed expression in their eyes communicating all they needed. Others nodded their heads gleefully. We were pumping our fists in the air in excitement. We ended up sitting on a bench outside, taking in the cool night air of the midnight hour and talking on and on about our experience before heading to a late dinner to talk about it some more. Sure, you can call us nerdy if you want. But The Tree of Life  was that beautiful, that profound, that effective. We had both just seen what is possibly the most life affirming film either of us had seen in our entire lives.Sometimes life can be overbearingly hurtful and completely unfair in too many unforgivable ways. Many people try and find their own ways to remedy the pain and the sadness, whether it be from community contribution, art, work, religion, or simple birdhouse building. Sadly, it is not always this easy for some people to overcome their pain and their troubles. For many people, it is simply too overwhelming to comprehend the various harsh aspects of everyday life, and therefore the mere act of living begins to feel completely unsatisfactory. Finding the joy and the tranquility of being alive just doesn't seem to quite justify the troubles in the world. This is very obviously what Jack (Sean Penn) feels every single say when he wakes up and goes to his job as an architect. His brother died at the age of nineteen and he tells his father over the phone that he thinks about him everyday, a sign that this event caused him deep personal turmoil. It isn't until Jack sees a tree being planted that he begins to retreat back into his memories and then challenges himself. His memories are what take up the bulk of the picture as he goes back in time to the building blocks of his existence and the existence of the rest of the universe before reminiscing on his childhood, growing up with his two little brothers and his very affectionate and angelic mother and his strict and frustrating father in 1950s Texas. It is through this that he must discover the complexities of life's emotions and what they mean to him as a human being. What we see in his flashback is his personal attempt to try and make a rediscovery and reevaluation on his existence.Before getting into this film, it'd be best to warn people that this is a very unorthodox picture, even by Terrence Malick standards. I'd say approximately half of the people who see it will dislike it, and many of the people who will like it will mostly still be somewhat puzzled. The reason for this is due to the editing. This film doesn't unfold in the same way that most films do. It is disjointed, nonsensical, ludicrous, and very fragmented. In other words, this is the kind of film all casual filmgoers, and most movie buffs even, should avoid unless they are will to watch the film with an open mind for theme. Many will say that films should not require audience preparation or learned experiences of any kind in order to be good. The thing is, many of those people who say that are right. For example, with a documentary like the Errol Morris picture The Fog of War, it is necessary to have knowledge and understanding of what happened during the Vietnam war, and therefore it will only be good for those people who do. The Tree of Life, however, doesn't really require any sort of knowledge to be viewed properly. You don't need to have read the bible or studied any type of scientific theory. It fact, the younger you are the better the film experience may be for you. This is because it's images and ideas will still seem very new and real. Since a lot of this film depicts childhood, I think children are going to be the audience the film will most resonate film.Throughout the film, you'll see the entire universe get created, you'll see people reacting to death and to birth. You'll see people walking, running, smiling, crying, getting angry and abusive, and getting emotional and weakening in their stature. You'll see a set of parents marvel at the beauty that is their children and you'll see children marvel at the beauty of the world around them. You'll see the mother come up with creative and hilarious ideas to wake up her children, hug them, kiss them, run around playing with them, and even appearing in their dreams. You'll see the father hug them and kiss them as well, but not until he berates and hits them, scolds them, and lose his temper in his attempts to get them used to an often unforgiving and punishing world. This is a film that shows human existence at it's most natural. The world around these people is as much a character and the actual breathing characters. The animals, flowers, bugs, and nature are all flowing, fighting, and breathing just like these three boys and these two parents. This is all in accordance with the film's evident feelings toward Sean Penn's character and his difficulties with his existence. The film is trying to say that the world will not stop moving just for you to get over your miseries. Life keeps moving, and Jack has forgotten this. He has let himself drift into an otherworldly thought process in which nothing is good and that progress is simply digression disguised as something bigger and more important. You can see it in his cold eyes as he wanders around the modern world as casually and as carelessly as a dust cloud. In his scenes, when the camera follows him it is almost as if he is on a conveyor belt. This effect gives these scenes a real eerie sense of dread and distance that almost become overbearing.Before going on, special mention must be made to the fact that this marks the first film in which Terrence Malick depicts the modern world. All of his films take place at different times in history, which indicates that Malick is a huge fan of history and period dramas. Mention of this is important because Malick's view of the modern world is very interesting. It's all so industrial and mechanical, but it's not entirely a negative view. In fact, I think it's a very positive one. The environment look and seem bigger and more important than life and the people within it, and yet there is a strange kind of nature to it as well that makes it seem more like a post-modern view. I get the impression that this depiction of the world of today is primarily intended to be less an omen and more a recording of what people remember about modern civilization in the early 21st Century. Because of this, the rest of the film feels even more hopeful as a result. Terrence Malick comes across as a man with a wide range of interests, much like Werner Herzog, and prefers to tell stories that contain more information, detail, style, and importance than what most people experience in their life. His films feel less like they're scripted and more like they're constructed from every thought and theme that comes to mind and seems relevant to the central tone and idea. It is with this that Malick then chooses to explore and outline what everything means before allowing these ideas to grow and develop within the storyline. It's a very odd technique and to be honest few can say that it is without problems. All of Terrence Malick's other films are challenging in their own little ways, with Badlands being the most simple and The New World being the most obtuse other than The Tree of Life. The fact that this film takes place in the modern world, however, makes it a landmark in Malick's ever growing body of work.So then Sean Penn gets to see the tree being planted, and from there onward the film becomes a collection of whispered questions about the universe and about the creation of the universe and the creation of creation, which then dissolves into what is the most controversial, most complicated, most off-putting, and most challenging part of the entire work. The creation of everything. This is the part that will ultimately make or break the film for you. The creation of the universe is one of the weirdest, most terrifying, more bizarre, and most abstract sequences we have ever seen in a motion picture, and to call it beautiful would be an understatement. It's such a ridiculously overblown yet magically creative scene, that one cannot help but appreciate it simply because someone had the guts to go all the way with it. It features state of the art photographic effects work from Douglas Trumbull, the same man who did the abstract work for 2001. The sequence is completely bizarre, almost Kenneth Anger-esque, in it's loud, bright, violent, and endless way. Everything just explodes and builds an rebuilds. Bugs crawl out of bubbles, bubbles crawl out of stones, stones crawl out of fire, fire crawls out of the air, and all the while set to the most intense opera music you can imagine. The effect is roller coaster-like in it's horror. Yes, eventually you also see dinosaurs. Without talking too much about the dinosaurs (since everybody else seems to go bonkers over the fact that they are in this film), the intended effect and idea was solid enough for it to work. Who cares if something is CGI or not, as long as the idea works well enough to support the effect. Most people who have seen this film don't feel it does, but we do. Lets move on.So then we enter the best part of the film, as well as the longest. We finally see Jack's childhood, and boy is it incredible to watch. As troublesome and as confusing as it is, it is in many ways the ideal childhood. Two very strong, very human, parental figures in a beautifully average neighborhood with wide roads and limitless adventure. The backyards stretch infinitely and nature seems to exist everywhere. The three young brothers, all very excellently cast (the three look very similarly alike), all seem perfectly healthy, loud, frantic, rambunctious, and sun burnt in addition to being overly violent to one another and unable to handle death very well. Jack, in particular ends up growing very confused by his developing feelings and emotions and ends up killing animals and vandalizing things. In other words, they are normal kids in a world where normality doesn't exist. Their father, Mr. O'Brien (played by Brad Pitt, in his best performance), is a loving man who is always showing affectionate and warm love to his children, but remains constantly strict and tough to them in order to prepare them for a harsh existence. He wants them to remain children and wants them to stay innocent without taking away their freedom, but he obviously feels that he would be doing them an even bigger service by allowing conflict, violence, and anger into their lives in order for the good things to be so much better. Since the film is from the child's point of view, much of the father behavior may come across as cruel and too strict and harsh. To be fair, however, most fathers do occasionally tend to go a little bit too far with their children. Terrence Malick, at times, seems afraid to explore relationships with the father and their children, but here he does it fearlessly without any hesitations or cliches. It's an honest and truthful exploration of the relationship between a father and his boys. Occasionally he fears he is being too overbearing, and even apologizes to Jack for it, to which Jack responds by defending his father's actions against him. In order to really understand the power of that scene, you simply have to see it.Their mother, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is the perfect opposite to the rough and tough father. She is so beautiful, so childlike, and so full of energy, imagination, and fun that she almost comes across like one of their own kids. The scenes involving her are the best scenes in the film, and what a breath of fresh air it is to see such a wonderful, uncomplicated, and joyful character in modern art. Often times, characters are either sharply one way or sharply the other. Her character is simple and beautiful without coming across as false or characterized. She has very abundant and strong emotional reactions to the world around her, which leads us to believe that in the past she has had it intensely rough throughout the course of the film she is re-experiencing a childhood that she never had through her own children. This makes her a somewhat flawed character in concept, but in execution she is perhaps the greatest woman you could ever meet in your life. Besides, perfection is overrated. That Chastain could communicate all of this is absolutely astounding. Her performance is stellar, gorgeous. Her beauty is exquisite. These two things combine to create the best performance by an actress we have seen in quite some time. Chastain is powerful, moving, utterly earth shattering. She is the emotional core of The Tree of Life and the one aspect that continues to stick in our minds above all the others. Thank you Miss Chastain for moving us to tears. Thank you Miss Chastain for allowing us to fall so utterly in love with you as the film's very own guardian angel. And thank you Miss Chastain, for gracing us with your presence. Watching you work was so raw, so personal that it felt like we were right there in the room with you, watching relate a story to good friends. That you can transport us as well as embrace us makes you dynamite in our book.As the film nears it's end, the structure of the film becomes less disjointed and more elegant in it's approach to life and humanity. The twenty minute finale is something that we will not spoil except that it is one of the best finales to any film made in the last sixty years and it truly drives home what the film is about. Life cannot progress without weaknesses, desires, fears, mistakes, and most importantly, death. All of these things are good things in many ways because they strengthen what people triumph and feel proud about in life. The discovery of a lost pet. The new found respect shown by someone who you didn't think noticed your integrity (to do the right thing, not caring if people know). The resurgence of a new idea after a large scale plan falls through. The mistakes that allow you to meet new people and grow new friendships and relationships. The loss of a good friend who you realize causes you more pain than you realized. The arrival at a new place that gives you the chance to start all over with no mistakes. The accidental pregnancy that leads you to give birth to the new love of your life. In the end, there are no such things as primarily good or primarily bad things. Good and bad things come and grow out of everything, and it is up to you to take the bad with the good. The violent death of a sibling that you love and care deeply about is a painful thing to deal with, but it will also give you the chance to start your life again with the memories of people who you've been with as far back as you can remember. Death is not defeat, and just because a person dies does not mean that they don't exist. They exist in memories, in thoughts, and in who you and who the people around you are. You can see it as spiritual or as ethical, but until you learn to except death, life will pass by without you. This is what the ending of the picture meant to us.No film is perfect, and so while we can say that we love every aspect of the film in all of it's ridiculously overblown, ambitious, and bizarre glory, we cannot or stress how unorthodox the picture is. There will be at least one aspect of the film people don't like. There are those who may not like the Sean Penn sequences, but they'll like the creation sequences. There are those who may love the childhood scenes but may strongly dislike the ending. Then there are those who may end up loving the ending, but won't get to it because they'll walk out during the creation scenes. Or someone may love the Sean Penn material and the creation scenes, but then the second half of the film comes up with the childhood and the existential ending and they'll totally tune out. Then there are those who will love the whole film, but will get annoyed by the flame of light that keep coming up and appearing throughout the film. There are Atheists who will hate the film for it's religious overtones and vise-versa. There are those who will love all the material but will be completely uninterested in the Sean Penn scenes. It will be very hard for most people to love every aspect of the film, and it'll be an even bigger challenge for many of those people to even begin to at the very least appreciate the material they hate. However, that is what good art does. It challenges, it provokes argument, thoughts, and feelings, and above all it entertains.Of all the ambitious motion pictures made since the creation of the movie camera, this is one of the most ambitious of them all. In the past three decades, there have been countless films made by big time directors whose goal is to make a large scale motion picture based on something either highly personal, highly ambitious, or highly experimental that is said to be inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some examples include John Boorman's Zardoz, Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, Nicholas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, Christopher Nolan's Inception, Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void, and most particularly Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Most of these pictures are either flawed or failed experiments that show plenty of potential, originality, and brilliance. Only one of them came extremely close to achieving what 2001 achieves (the Nicholas Roeg picture). Now we have this film, The Tree of Life, which manages to equal 2001 in it's power, it's emotion, it's ideas, it's intensity, and it's beauty. Terrence Malick's masterpiece is one of the greatest accomplishments in filmmaking history, progressing the storytelling movement to a whole new level that few films have come close to quite topping. The performances are shattering and revolutionary, the photography is already legendary, and the musical score in particular is just as perfect as the film itself. This will be a film that will be remembered for a long time afterward, and we can truly hope that more filmmakers can make films like this, because filmmaking is still in it's infancy and it can change the world as long as it continues to grow and develop. This is easily the best picture of the decade. This is as good as films get.",5,Best film of the decade thus far,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,19177,"['last', 'day', 'July', 'probably', 'significant', 'many', 'be', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'birthday',

I know this because I was an extra in a car commercial at the time and several of the female extras on the set were talking about which movie they were going to see that weekend and I heard many comments like, ""Yeah, I've heard good things about BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, so I don't know which one to see."" I didn't say so aloud, but when I heard these comments, I wanted to tell these women, ""If you're debating between watching BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, then you need to go see BRIDESMAIDS because THE TREE OF LIFE is not a movie you will enjoy."" I'm pretty sure that most of the women went to see BRIDESMAIDS and that the only reason they were mentioning THE TREE OF LIFE is because they wanted to seem like they knew something more about film than they really did because THE TREE OF LIFE had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's directed by Terrence Malick.THE TREE OF LIFE is a Terrence Malick film. That's something you need to know because Terrence Malick films aren't like other movies. Terrence Malick films are stunning works of cinematography and visual art. In that regard, they are incomparable and people who are serious about film often like them solely for that aspect. Terrence Malick films also usually have beautiful musical scores and if you were able to turn the dialog off and just listen to the film's music with the film's visuals, you'd have an amazing visual musical combination. It is largely because of these two things that Malick is considered a genius.However, Terrence Malick films aren't like other films, so in addition to gorgeous cinematography and moving musical scores they also really don't have much of a plot. For instance, THE THIN RED LINE is about WWII, but it's unlike any war movie you'll ever watch again. THE NEW WORLD is supposed to be a love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, but if you watch it for romance or action, you'll be bored out of your mind.If you know all of this ahead of time and you still haven't been turned off by it, you might enjoy THE TREE OF LIFE.The film revolves around Jack O'Brien, portrayed as an adult by Sean Penn and as a child by Hunter McCracken. Flashing back and forth between the present and the past (and possibly the future), Jack wrestles with an internal struggle as illustrated by a line from Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Castain), ""The nuns taught us there were two ways through life - the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow."" Jack had to decide as a boy becoming a man which path he would follow and as an adult it is a choice he has to make everyday.In addition to those already mentioned, THE TREE OF LIFE features Brad Pitt in the role of Mr. O'Brien. Pitt makes a great 1950s father. He's got the look and moves down perfect and reminded me of old 8mm films of my own grandfather.The movie has some dinosaurs which is pretty cool, though they don't seem to add anything to the plot.I can't say I enjoyed THE TREE OF LIFE, but I did appreciate it. I did really like the concept of nature versus grace and felt the film did a decent job of getting across the power of grace over nature (aka sin).Overall, if you like Terrence Malick movies or if you like art films, you will probably like THE TREE OF LIFE. However, if you've never seen a Terrence Malick movie or if you don't like non-linear movies with very little structure, you're probably best skipping THE TREE OF LIFE. It's pretty much for film aficionados only (and many of them don't like THE TREE OF LIFE).",3,"Nature Vs.

1393051,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B004A8ZX32,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[2, 8]","While the artistic merits of this film can't be ignored or denied, the rest of it is truly a waste. I wanted to shut it off after about 20 minutes, and I have a very high annoyance tolerance for films. Visually, it is stunning but combined with a non-linear story-line, an odd plot and wasted acting, The Tree of Life is simply a bore. You can't even really summarize this film properly. During the 50's three sons are seen growing up in a typical home with a somewhat strict (but not bad) father and now, in present day, the eldest reflects on his sad past. Why is he so angry and resentful? Who knows, because the mere glimpses we get are not nearly enough to establish anything. Sean Penn plays the modern day son and I'm pretty sure he doesn't utter a single word in the entire movie except a random whisper to the viewers. In fact, I read recently that while he was on set, he had no idea what he was even doing there because he apparently didn't know what the point of his role was... Brad Pitt plays the 'stern' father back in the past (and does a marvelous job actually) but again, his character is never fully fleshed out so we only get a surface picture of him. Jessica Chastain is the mother, who wanders the film aimlessly, loving her boys and husband, but never speaking a word of importance. She does love washing her feet alot though...... There's also alot of whispering in the movie.The one redeaming factor is the beautifully haunting score. I didn't realize until the credits that Alexandre Desplat conducted this. He is my new favorite composer after hearing his work in other recent films. It really is a glorious and noticable score and I only wish the actual film could keep up with it. At well over 2 hours, it was hard not to fidget and constantly check the time. The ending was just....odd. But by that point I was so past caring I didn't even try to break it apart frame by frame like I usually like to do. This is not a fantasy(or is it??) but it does contain dinosaurs. Like I said; odd. I was told beforehand you will either love it or hate it and I think I know which end I am leaning on.",2,"4 stars for the musical score, 2 for the film",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,2119,"['artistic', 'merits', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'denied', 'rest', 'truly', 'waste', 'wanted', 'shut', 'off', '20', 'minutes', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'annoyance', 'tolerance', 'films', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'combined', 'non-linear', 'story-line', 'odd', 'plot', 'wasted', 'acting', 'Tree', 'Life', 'simply', 'bore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'summarize', 'film', 'properly', '50', 'three', 'sons', 'are', 'seen', 'growing', 'up', 'typical', 'home', 'somewhat', 'strict', 'not', 'bad', 'father', 'now', 'present', 'day', 'eldest', 'sad', 'past', 'Why', 'so', 'angry', 'resentful', 'Who', 'mere', 'get', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'establish', 'anything', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'modern', 'day', 'son', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""n't"", 'utter', 'single', 'word', 'entire', 'movie', 'random', 'whisper', 'viewers', 'fact', 'read', 'recently', 'was', 'set', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'doing', 'there', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'point', 'role', 'was', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ""'stern"", 'father', 'back', 'past', 'marvelous', 'job', 'actually', 'again', 'character', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'only', 'get', 'surface', 'picture', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'mother', 'who', 'film', 'aimlessly', 'loving', 'boys', 'husband', 'never', 'speaking', 'word', 'importance', 'love', 'washing', 'feet', 'alot', 'also', 'alot', 'whispering', 'movie.The', 'one', 'redeaming', 'factor', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'score', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'credits', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'conducted', 'new', 'favorite', 'composer', 'hearing', 'work', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'really', 'glorious', 'noticable', 'score', 'only', 'wish', 'actual', 'film', 'could', 'keep', 'up', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'fidget', 'constantly', 'check', 'time', 'ending', 'was', 'just', '.odd', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'past', 'caring', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'break', 'apart', 'frame', 'frame', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'fantasy', 'contain', 'dinosaurs', 'said', 'odd', 'was', 'told', 'beforehand', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'think', 'know', 'end', 'am', 'leaning']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]
1393052,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B004A8ZX32,V. Berk,"[3, 4]","Terrence Malick has filled his career with films that are simply gorgeous to look at but have been fairly light on actual plot.  Films like The Thin Red Line were great, but they were not everyone's cup of tea.  With 2011's The Tree of Life will not win over any mainstream praise, but it is however without a doubt the best film of Malick's entire career, and will easily come to be regarded as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema!Perhaps Malick's most well-known work prior The Tree of Life for younger viewers is the masterfully well-executed WWII drama The Thin Red Line (1998).  For those who've seen The Thin Red Line you may have a general idea of how Malick likes to structure things.  That is, plenty of monologues delivered by his characters intercut with symbolic imagery of nature, and human interactions.  The big difference between The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life however is the one most likely to frighten off the casual filmgoer: The Tree of Life doesn't in any way have what could be considered in any meaning of the term ""traditional narrative.""  In fact, the film has such little narrative its hard even applying the word to it.  Don't believe me?  Do dinosaurs appear in what you consider a ""traditional narrative""?  (Oh yeah: there's dinosaurs that pop up in this film and it is glorious).What one must know going into The Tree of Life is that it is not a traditional drama starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn.  The acting is good (especially Pitt) but the actors have little to nothing to do with the overall quality, or appeal of the film.  This is writer/director Terrence Malick's show.  This is a film of beauty and art.  One cannot view this film as a story, but as a work of art that one would find in a museum.This film is not everyone's cup of tea, as I've tried to make abundantly clear in my review.  If you're someone who couldn't stand Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey you will most certainly not enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.  Yes, there is a loose plot, just like2001: A Space Odyssey, but the plot is not the primary purpose of the film, which is to dig into the mysteries of life, and existence through the use of surrealist imagery and situations.  2001: A Space Odyssey had the side plot of HAL9000 and the crew of the Discovery.  The Tree of Life's plot within its imagery primarily focuses on the life of a 1950s family living in Waco, Texas (naturally reflecting Malick's actual childhood no doubt).  The acting in the 1950s portion is superb, and Brad Pitt gives a pitch perfect performance as the father.I would like to tell you more about the plot, but there really isn't much to tell.  If you're honestly expecting to go and see a movie primarily focusing on the life of a Texas family during the 1950s all I can say is: you'll be confused, and sorely disappointed (just like those who honestly thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was just about a computer that goes rogue and starts killing the crew of a spaceship).  The only way to enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is if you go in with an open mind, and have the understanding that you're not going to be watching a traditional drama- in fact, don't even go in thinking of this film as a drama.  You must look at this film as a piece of art, which it is.  I attended the film with a group of ten acquaintances who represented several age groups and ethnicities and we all loved this film.The imagery is beautiful and if cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki doesn't see an Oscar nomination next year I'll consider it a crime against the industry!  I would like to see The Tree of Life be nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards (especially with the category being expanded to ten nominees) but I doubt it would have any chance of actually winning because it goes so far against mainstream cinema.  It is a film for enthusiasts of cinema and for those who want the medium to transcend traditional narrative and become an art form all its own.  If you're part of the crowd that enjoys those kinds of movies you should not miss The Tree of Life if it comes through your town.As a piece of art I feel Malick has created a film that will be remembered and studied by film critics and students for decades to come.",5,"Life is beautiful, as is this film",1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,4270,"['Terrence', 'Malick', 'filled', 'career', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'light', 'actual', 'plot', 'Films', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'were', 'great', 'were', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', '2011', 'Tree', 'Life', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'mainstream', 'praise', 'however', 'doubt', 'best', 'film', 'Malick', 'entire', 'career', 'will', 'easily', 'come', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'cinema', 'Perhaps', 'Malick', 'most', 'well-known', 'work', 'prior', 'Tree', 'Life', 'younger', 'viewers', 'masterfully', 'well-executed', 'WWII', 'drama', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', '1998', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'may', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'how', 'Malick', 'structure', 'things', 'plenty', 'monologues', 'delivered', 'characters', 'intercut', 'symbolic', 'imagery', 'nature', 'human', 'interactions', 'big', 'difference', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'Tree', 'Life', 'however', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'frighten', 'off', 'casual', 'filmgoer', 'Tree', 'Life', ""n't"", 'way', 'have', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'meaning', 'term', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'fact', 'film', 'such', 'little', 'narrative', 'hard', 'even', 'applying', 'word', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Do', 'dinosaurs', 'appear', 'what', 'consider', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'dinosaurs', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'glorious', 'one', 'must', 'know', 'going', 'Tree', 'Life', 'not', 'traditional', 'drama', 'starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'Pitt', 'actors', 'have', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'overall', 'quality', 'appeal', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'show', 'film', 'beauty', 'art', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'view', 'film', 'story', 'work', 'art', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'museum.This', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'make', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'review', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Yes', 'loose', 'plot', 'just', 'like2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'plot', 'not', 'primary', 'purpose', 'film', 'dig', 'mysteries', 'life', 'existence', 'use', 'surrealist', 'imagery', 'situations', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'had', 'side', 'plot', 'HAL9000', 'crew', 'Discovery', 'Tree', 'Life', 'plot', 'imagery', 'primarily', 'life', '1950s', 'family', 'living', 'Waco', 'Texas', 'naturally', 'reflecting', 'Malick', 'actual', 'childhood', 'doubt', 'acting', '1950s', 'portion', 'superb', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performance', 'father.I', 'would', 'like', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'tell', ""'re"", 'honestly', 'expecting', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'primarily', 'focusing', 'life', 'Texas', 'family', '1950s', 'can', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'confused', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'just', 'who', 'honestly', 'thought', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'was', 'just', 'computer', 'rogue', 'killing', 'crew', 'spaceship', 'only', 'way', 'enjoy', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Tree', 'Life', 'go', 'open', 'mind', 'have', 'understanding', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'traditional', 'drama-', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'thinking', 'film', 'drama', 'must', 'look', 'film', 'piece', 'art', 'attended', 'film', 'group', 'ten', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'represented', 'several', 'age', 'groups', 'ethnicities', 'loved', 'film.The', 'imagery', 'beautiful', 'cinematographer', 'Emmanuel', 'Lubezki', ""n't"", 'see', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'year', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'crime', 'industry', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Tree', 'Life', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'especially', 'category', 'being', 'expanded', 'ten', 'nominees', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'actually', 'winning', 'so', 'far', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'film', 'enthusiasts', 'cinema', 'who', 'want', 'medium', 'transcend', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'become', 'art', 'form', 'own', ""'re"", 'part', 'crowd', 'kinds', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'Tree', 'Life', 'town.As', 'piece', 'art', 'feel', 'Malick', 'created', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'studied', 'film', 'critics', 'students', 'decades', 'come']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

I tried to see what others have said negatively about this work (i.e., the lack of plot, storyline, self-absorbtion etc.)...just couldn't find anything remotely similar to those comments. I did find an incredibly beautiful and powerfully moving experience in a very unsentimental, unambiguous way.

Oh, and what if Kubrick focused on human emotions, our sense of loss and the ambivalent relationship that some of us have with God?You'd have ""The Tree of Life"".Terence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" will polarize viewers much like most of his other films; this long medatative film focuses on fate,faith, our place in the Universe and the struggle to the seemingly random nature of the universe. Malick is the Stanley Kubrick of his generation but focuses on human emotion rather than the detached style of Kubrick. His films compromise often stunning visuals with a narrative told primarily through those visuals and brief dramatic (and fragmented here) vingettes.Aside from Kubrick's film the one closest to this in terms of tone and structure is ""The Fountain"" directed by Darren Aronofsky. If you enjoyed ""The Fountain"" you might enjoy this film although this is even more fragmented.If you're looking for a film like, say, ""October Sky"", which tackles some of the same themes in a more conventional narrative, you won't find it here. The often fragmentary structure of the film may make this a challenge for some viewers.Told in a sometimes sprawling fashion covering from the creation and then jumping billions of years later to 1950's America in the midwest, the film follows O'Brien family (Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, Tye Sheridan)as they struggle with a later tragedy) and, then follows the grown up Jack as he struggles with the events of the past. It's a fascinating window into the past and the loss of innocence of these three boys.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning for the film and the photography of Jack Fisk is brilliant realized in the high def domain. Having said that, if you watch the DVD, it looks quite nice as well.Audio sounds brilliant with a great lossless 5.1 mix.Special features are a bit on the thin side with a short ""making of"" documentary that doesn't go very deep into Malick's intentions in making the film from its cosmic beginnings to it's 50's melodrama. We also get a theatrical trailer but that's it.I'd suggest renting this to see if it's your sort of movie.

1393063,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,B004A8ZX32,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[1, 3]","An impressive effort in non-rational filmmaking, ""Tree of Life"" will hit you sideways in the theater but grow on you over time.Wanting to see a movie before the start of Judaism's Three Weeks of Affliction, I was drawn to the title - the Holy Torah (Jewish Bible) is called Etz Chaim (Tree of Life). Writer Terrence Malick hits a number of impressive Jewish notes including an opening quote from the Book of Job (38:4) and use of the song ""Ha Tikva."" If his purpose is to induce humility of soul through use of Job then Malick succeeded brilliantly with me. In 38:4, G-d speaks directly to Job for the first time out of the whirlwind with one of His penetrating questions. Remember that any time G-d asks a question it's not because He lacks knowledge (The Blessed One's rhetoric is eternally rhetorical).Malick's story then circles around this truth. He holds up the grandeur of G-d alongside the pettiness of human beings. Human shortcomings are best demonstrated by Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) in his jealousy of others' material possessions and his compartmentalized religion including his inability to stay in the exaltedness of the classical music he enjoys and plays. O'Brien's militarist mindset is a pathetic attempt to get control of his surroundings and strike at what haunts him.Mrs. O'Brien outlines the spiritual tug of war in explaining the ways of grace and of nature. She probably elaborated on this in her prayers sprinkled through the film but they were whispered and my less-than-perfect hearing couldn't pick them up (my only complaint with the movie).The O'Brien household takes on an ""East of Eden"" feel although when we encounter Sean Penn's urban-locked character it's really the West (USA etc.) and its contrast to Eden that's being drawn for us. Like Adam and Eve, the O'Briens have three sons although ""Tree of Life"" eschews the brother-killing-brother theme. Penn's character ends up a city dweller/builder like Cain of the Book of Genesis. The O'Briens lose their home. The drive away from the family homestead conjures Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden. Recall that the Tree of Life was what became dangerous after Adam and Eve's sin with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. A snake does not try to tempt Mrs. O'Brien (surely an oversight on Malick's part - joking).By covertly grasping for such grand themes, Malick likely sent some rationalists rushing to the box office to demand their money back. Instead, the rationalists should let their minds wander through Malick's gorgeous film and G-d's glorious garden tasting fruits that expand the senses of wonder and thankfulness.",4,West of Eden,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2611,"['impressive', 'effort', 'non-rational', 'filmmaking', 'Tree', 'Life', 'will', 'hit', 'sideways', 'theater', 'grow', 'time.Wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'start', 'Judaism', 'Three', 'Weeks', 'Affliction', 'was', 'drawn', 'title', 'Holy', 'Torah', 'Jewish', 'Bible', 'called', 'Etz', 'Chaim', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Writer', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'number', 'impressive', 'Jewish', 'notes', 'including', 'opening', 'quote', 'Book', 'Job', '38:4', 'use', 'song', 'Ha', 'Tikva', 'purpose', 'induce', 'humility', 'soul', 'use', 'Job', 'then', 'Malick', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', '38:4', 'G-d', 'directly', 'Job', 'first', 'time', 'whirlwind', 'one', 'penetrating', 'questions', 'Remember', 'time', 'G-d', 'question', 'not', 'knowledge', 'Blessed', 'One', 'rhetoric', 'eternally', 'rhetorical', '.Malick', 'story', 'then', 'truth', 'up', 'grandeur', 'G-d', 'pettiness', 'human', 'beings', 'Human', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'best', 'demonstrated', 'Mr.', ""O'Brien"", 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'jealousy', 'others', 'material', 'possessions', 'compartmentalized', 'religion', 'including', 'inability', 'stay', 'exaltedness', 'classical', 'music', 'plays', ""O'Brien"", 'militarist', 'mindset', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'get', 'control', 'surroundings', 'strike', 'what', 'him.Mrs', ""O'Brien"", 'spiritual', 'tug', 'war', 'explaining', 'ways', 'grace', 'nature', 'probably', 'elaborated', 'prayers', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'were', 'whispered', 'less-than-perfect', 'hearing', 'could', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', ""O'Brien"", 'household', 'East', 'Eden', 'feel', 'when', 'encounter', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'urban-locked', 'character', 'really', 'West', 'USA', 'etc', 'contrast', 'Eden', 'being', 'drawn', 'Adam', 'Eve', ""O'Briens"", 'have', 'three', 'sons', 'Tree', 'Life', 'brother-killing-brother', 'theme', 'Penn', 'character', 'up', 'city', 'dweller/builder', 'Cain', 'Book', 'Genesis', ""O'Briens"", 'lose', 'home', 'drive', 'away', 'family', 'homestead', 'conjures', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'expulsion', 'Eden', 'Recall', 'Tree', 'Life', 'was', 'what', 'became', 'dangerous', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'sin', 'Tree', 'Knowledge', 'Good', 'Evil', 'snake', 'not', 'try', 'tempt', 'Mrs.', ""O'Brien"", 'surely', 'oversight', 'Malick', 'part', 'joking', 'covertly', 'grasping', 'such', 'grand', 'themes', 'Malick', 'likely', 'sent', 'rationalists', 'rushing', 'box', 'office', 'demand', 'money', 'back', 'Instead', 'rationalists', 'should', 'let', 'minds', 'wander', 'Malick', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'G-d', 'glorious', 'garden', 'tasting', 'fruits', 'expand', 'senses', 'wonder', 'thankfulness']",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]
