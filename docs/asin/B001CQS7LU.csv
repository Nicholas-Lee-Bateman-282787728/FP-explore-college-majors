He managed to move in and became inspired to start gardening with no formal training in art or horticulture.  He began to be noticed when he won Bishopville's ""Yard Of The Month"" award.  He also discovered that he was more than a highly motivated black person.  He had extremely high levels of artistic talent which began to be noticed at higher and higher levels. Eventually, his gorgeous topiary displays triggered topiary efforts by his neighbors, gave Bishopville a major tourist attraction and allowed Fryar to become recognized worldwide as a great plant-sculpting artist.  This high level of recognition also allowed Fryar to become a listened-to philosopher and role model.  The inspiration gained by those who view this documentary would apply to those with interests far afield from topiary art.",5,"The True Story of Pearl Fryar, The Tree Sculpting Artist Who Rivals Marconi For Global Impact Without Formal Training",1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,1171,"['documentary', 'film', 'Pearl', 'Fryar', 'very', 'tall', 'well-muscled', 'plant-sculpturing', 'topiary', 'artist', 'ladder', 'athlete', 'who', 'started', 'life', 'abject', 'poverty', 'later', 'found', 'wanting', 'move', 'Bishopville', 'South', 'Carolina', 'neighborhood', 'dominated', 'whites', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'beliefs', 'blacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'yards', 'managed', 'move', 'became', 'inspired', 'start', 'gardening', 'formal', 'training', 'art', 'horticulture', 'began', 'be', 'noticed', 'when', 'won', 'Bishopville', 'Yard', 'Month', 'award', 'also', 'discovered', 'was', 'more', 'highly', 'motivated', 'black', 'person', 'had', 'extremely', 'high', 'levels', 'artistic', 'talent', 'began', 'be', 'noticed', 'higher', 'higher', 'levels', 'Eventually', 'gorgeous', 'topiary', 'displays', 'triggered', 'topiary', 'efforts', 'neighbors', 'gave', 'Bishopville', 'major', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'allowed', 'Fryar', 'become', 'recognized', 'worldwide', 'great', 'plant-sculpting', 'artist', 'high', 'level', 'recognition', 'also', 'allowed', 'Fryar', 'become', 'listened-to', 'philosopher', 'role', 'model', 'inspiration', 'gained', 'who', 'view', 'documentary', 'would', 'apply', 'interests', 'far', 'afield', 'topiary', 'art']",A Man Named Pearl  SET

We also plan to share this with family and friends. This is great for church groups,schools to watch, and communities, etc to gather and watch how a person who is allowed space and time think can transform and transform others. This will also show how one over comes rejection and trials.We love the fact that Mr. Pearl saw a need and is meeting the need. We wish more schools would focus on the underdogs, ""c"" students and not always the gifted... It reminds me of a book I read that stated the same thing,(the book is by Thomas Stanley The Millionaire Mind and The Millionaire Next Door) how here in America we focus on the gifted and talented.. and never allow individuals to be creative and innovative.We want to test and test and only take the cream of the top and give them a chance. Well many other countries don't operate in that manner and it is great that someone in American finally is doing something about the way the C students are perceived. Wow being a C student and being looked down on, all the time and told what you can not do, and then turning around running fortune 500 companies shows what and individual can do if given the chance. This DVD will show you what is being done in one town to help individuals that no one else may see as capable of much, but when given the chance rise to the unexpected..If you love gardening, inspiration, truth, hard work, patience, persistence, faith, dedication, etc this DVD is for you.. And even if you don't you still will walk away touched and transformed...We are so glad that this DVD was made and hope that more stories of this subject matter will be made..

1177389,A140XH16IKR4B0,B001CQS7LU,Jean E. Pouliot,"[32, 32]","Pearl Fryar is an extraordinary man, self-made to be sure. The son of a sharecropper, he seemingly has an innate sense about the way plants grow, blessed with a keen, artistic mind. Combined, these talents have made him almost obsessed about turning his modest, 3-acre property in tiny Bishopville, South Carolina into a work of topiary art. Using cast-off plants from a local greenhouse, he creates and beautiful Eden in his backyard. The film is a paean to his efforts, his vision and his effect on his community.There's a tendency to see Pearl as a sort of backwoods topiary savant. But listen to him speak to college art classes, and you will hear a articulate man who embodies the artistic impulse and inspires students to leave their sketchbooks behind and reach into their hearts. He may not have gained his knowledge from textbooks, but from Nature itself, the source of the textbooks. The film interviews Pearl, his wife and son, neighbors, his pastor and his many friends. The ""best supporting actor"" has to go to the head of the local Chamber of Commerce. Though his feet-on-the-desk, salesy manner might remind some of Uncle Kip in ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" he sems truly appreciative of Pearl and his potential to bring a few more touirists into town.Played as a fiction, ""A Man Named Pearl"" would have been set as a standard against-all-obstacles story. This film is not so craven as to invent huge villains for Pearl to overcome. The standard demons of lingering racial stratification, self-esteem, community doubt and the clock will have to do. A fine film that shows what human bengs are capable of when given the light, air and space to grow.

1177391,A356RFKNIG043B,B001CQS7LU,K. Swanson,"[9, 9]","A wonderful movie about a wonderful man.Pearl Fryar (and his lovely wife Metra) are two of the sweetest and most truly humble people you'll ever find. As much as I loved Pearl's topiary creations, what really touched me here is the truly unconditional love these two share. You can't fake this kind of connection; look at her eyes when she talks about him, and look at the gentleman he becomes in her presence. The entire world should have someone they love who loves them as much as the Fryars do each other. It's just heartwarming to be in their presence, even via film.And it's a real treat to watch Pearl's love of nature and gardening transform those who come to view his three-acre slice of heaven, sliced by Pearl himself and certainly watched over by many green angels. The busloads of old ladies and young schoolkids and everyone in between are visibly moved because they can see and feel the love of the man in the plants, and his very individual vision. As some of the gardening experts say at the beginning, he shouldn't be able to do all this...this and that tree don't grow well here...yet there it is, a garden as perfect as Versailles in its own small, quiet way.I think it works and grows and moves people because of the love so clearly on display. Trees and plants feel that love just as people do, and Pearl's love extends from his family (it's tough to separate his home, wife, and plants, they all seem of an exquisitely peaceful piece) to the people and his community, his church and his God. Yet few churches have the vibrant life and joy that emanates from Pearl's yard, and his very strong intention that it move and soothe others has clearly borne fruit on a level hard to imagine yet easy to fathom. How many small towns can you name that are famous for someone's yard? I can think of only one, and the unforced, sincere love and respect the people of Bishopville show for Pearl make questions of race fade away, and truths about love and determination move happily to the fore.Pearl is clearly a very wise human being, a wisdom with a special flavor imparted by decades of caring for both trees and people. He says many simple, startlingly accurate things that resonate long after the film is over, and by the end it's hard not to see him as rather more enlightened than most of us. When he casually mentions that he'd never use chemicals in his garden, it makes sense in a way that a long treatise on organics might not. The endless singing of birds suggests that somewhere, St. Francis of Assisi is smiling.I watch movies not so much to be entertained, but to be moved, informed, and above all transported in some heartfelt way. A Man Named Pearl did all of those almost effortlessly. The gentle jazz score couldn't be more apt (nice job by composer Fred Story, and kudos to Phil Thompson for some lovely tenor sax moments), the film moves with the assurance and ease of a bird flying from tree to tree, the directors remain invisible and keep our hero squarely in the spotlight, the film moves with the assurance and ease of a bird flying from tree to tree, and the whole thing just feels right: unassuming, intelligent and authentic.I've seen a lot of documentaries about a lot of subjects, and when it comes to movies on great Americans, I'd have to say my three favorites are now Ken Burns' Mark Twain, Ric Burns' Ansel Adams, and Galloway/Pearson's A Man Named Pearl.Watch this movie.

Pearl shapes trees and hedges with no formal training, but he works with great devotion and determination towards this very spiritual activity.  It's not for his own vanity; it's for others to enjoy, and it may inspire them to do similar things in their own lives, even if that does not include gardening.This is an excellent documentary that seemed to come out of nowhere and grab my attention at the video store.  Do yourself a favor and rent it.  Anyone can enjoy this pleasant and uplifting, but never smarmy, story of one man and his passion.",5,A labor of love and determination,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,764,"['Pearl', 'Fryar', 'one', 'kind', 'modern-day', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'who', 'much', 'admired', 'extensive', 'topiary', 'garden', 'open', 'visitors', 'globe', 'charge', 'other', 'voluntary', 'donations', 'Pearl', 'trees', 'hedges', 'formal', 'training', 'great', 'devotion', 'determination', 'towards', 'very', 'spiritual', 'activity', 'not', 'own', 'vanity', 'others', 'enjoy', 'may', 'inspire', 'do', 'similar', 'things', 'own', 'lives', 'even', 'not', 'include', 'gardening.This', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'grab', 'attention', 'video', 'store', 'Do', 'favor', 'rent', 'Anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'pleasant', 'uplifting', 'never', 'smarmy', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'passion']",A Man Named Pearl  SET

Anytime you meet a person who puts their whole being into creating something beautiful, so much so that others can see and feel close to the supernatural force behind his intent, its refreshing. This man not only has created something special, but unselfishly shares it with others as if its a God-given duty laid upon him to do so.I hope someday to walk in the garden of Pearl; to meet the man and experience the glory of peace and harmony he's cropped here on earth.  If we could bottle the grace that Pearl must feel while tending to his garden, we'd have a cure for prejudice and hatred that could revolutionize cultural, social and maybe economic differences that keep people separated on this planet.In gardening as in life, its the pauses and spaces in between the leaves that tell the real story.  Pearl has created space in a place for us to pause and feel the oneness of life.",5,Everyone Should Meet A Pearl,1291766400,"12 8, 2010",2010,959,"['watched', 'show', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'meet', 'man', 'named', 'Pearl', 'Anytime', 'meet', 'person', 'who', 'whole', 'being', 'creating', 'something', 'beautiful', 'so', 'much', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'close', 'supernatural', 'force', 'intent', 'refreshing', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'created', 'something', 'special', 'unselfishly', 'shares', 'others', 'God-given', 'duty', 'laid', 'do', 'so.I', 'hope', 'someday', 'walk', 'garden', 'Pearl', 'meet', 'man', 'experience', 'glory', 'peace', 'harmony', 'cropped', 'here', 'earth', 'could', 'bottle', 'grace', 'Pearl', 'must', 'feel', 'tending', 'garden', ""'d"", 'have', 'cure', 'prejudice', 'hatred', 'could', 'revolutionize', 'cultural', 'social', 'maybe', 'economic', 'differences', 'keep', 'people', 'separated', 'planet.In', 'gardening', 'life', 'pauses', 'spaces', 'leaves', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'Pearl', 'created', 'space', 'place', 'pause', 'feel', 'oneness', 'life']",A Man Named Pearl  SET
