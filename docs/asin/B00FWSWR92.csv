1673573,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00FWSWR92,Ranny Levy,"[0, 1]","This is a good suspenseful adventure that I really like and enjoy.Paxton Flynn (Robbie Amell) and his brother, Tripp Flynn (Keenan Tracey), are unaware of their parent&#8217;s true line of work but they soon find out. When their parents go missing, the brothers and a friend decide to go hunting for 3 shards and an enchanted mirror. This beautiful enchanted mirror can grant you any wish. This hunt takes them all over the world to some great countries such as, Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada. Do they make the right choice in looking for the ancient artifacts?When you think of hunting you think of hunting animals or maybe even people, but in this film they hunt for ancient artifacts. This is very interesting and I like that the plot is somewhat unique and original with reminders of some well known childhood fairytales like, Snow White, Cinderella, and Red Riding Hood. It is very entertaining to see these little bits included in the film. These fairytales actually come to life which I like too. The cinematography of the scenery is breathtaking with gorgeous views of the mountainside and landscape. My favorite character is Dylan Savini (Alexa Vega), because she is very smart and knows exactly what to do in hard situations. Victor Garber (Mason Fuller) plays a great villain and makes you not like him because he is so believable and real at what he does. He is totally against the Hunter&#8217;s motto to find, protect and never use for evil. This film has great action with some awesome fighting scenes that are choreograph very well.A great message is that sometimes the harder choices are the right choices and everyone is not who or what they seem to be.I recommend &#8220;The Hunters&#8221; for ages 7 to 15; however it is great for the whole family to see and enjoy. There is really nothing to watch out for it you are under 7, except for the fighting scenes.I give this film 4 out of 5 stars as it keeps my interest, is enjoyable and is very easy to understand.",4,Good message: Sometimes the harder choices are the right choices and everyone is not who or what they appear to be.,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1990,"['good', 'suspenseful', 'adventure', 'really', 'enjoy.Paxton', 'Flynn', 'Robbie', 'Amell', 'brother', 'Tripp', 'Flynn', 'Keenan', 'Tracey', 'are', 'unaware', 'parent', '8217', 'true', 'line', 'work', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'When', 'parents', 'go', 'missing', 'brothers', 'friend', 'decide', 'go', 'hunting', '3', 'shards', 'enchanted', 'mirror', 'beautiful', 'enchanted', 'mirror', 'can', 'grant', 'wish', 'hunt', 'world', 'great', 'countries', 'such', 'Vancouver', 'British', 'Columbia', 'Canada', 'Do', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'looking', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'When', 'think', 'hunting', 'think', 'hunting', 'animals', 'maybe', 'even', 'people', 'film', 'hunt', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'very', 'interesting', 'like', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'original', 'reminders', 'well', 'known', 'childhood', 'fairytales', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'very', 'entertaining', 'see', 'little', 'bits', 'included', 'film', 'fairytales', 'actually', 'come', 'life', 'like', 'too', 'cinematography', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'gorgeous', 'views', 'mountainside', 'landscape', 'favorite', 'character', 'Dylan', 'Savini', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'very', 'smart', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'hard', 'situations', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Mason', 'Fuller', 'great', 'villain', 'not', 'so', 'believable', 'real', 'what', 'totally', 'Hunter', '8217', 'motto', 'find', 'protect', 'never', 'use', 'evil', 'film', 'great', 'action', 'awesome', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'choreograph', 'very', 'well.A', 'great', 'message', 'sometimes', 'harder', 'choices', 'are', 'right', 'choices', 'everyone', 'not', 'who', 'what', 'seem', 'be.I', 'recommend', '8220', 'Hunters', '8221', 'ages', '7', '15', 'however', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'see', 'enjoy', 'really', 'nothing', 'watch', 'out', 'are', '7', 'fighting', 'scenes.I', 'give', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars', 'interest', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'easy', 'understand']",N/A

We were pleasently surprised.  The acting was pretty good.  No one tried to do to much and over act they just seemed to be themselves which we thought worked.  If your looking for lots of action your going to be disapointed there isn't a ton.  The action is built to help build the suspense not bring it up.

In this story they introduce the characters as they search for the shards to the broken mirror from &#34;Snow White.&#34; The film had promise in the beginning with exotic scenery, but then quickly switches to exotic places like Boston. The plot was a bit confusing as the shards were hidden so they couldn't be found, so they go find them before the bad guys can find them...making it easier for the &#34;Krugen.&#34;There is one scene where we see a bathtub Porsche filled with blue Walmart reusable bags which had me shaking my head. Does Walmart really need the product placement? The film was an &#34;Eh-Okay&#34; production, most likely a company composed of Amazon reviewers. Who gives themselves a title of mediocrity? Oh, they're Canadians. My bad.I haven't figured out why no one used a real gun. They used single shot arrow-guns instead, which are bulkier. The acting was so-so.

Filming and audio are excellent.Premise: Two teenage boys, sons of famous treasure hunters, plus cute girl, are off to find Mom and Dad and the missing pieces of Snow White's mirror.Action is good. Well choreographed fight scenes, nothing harsh. Again, very G rated.Acting: If there is any part where the movie lags, it is in the acting. It is not bad acting, but a movie geared toward younger audiences. The way the mother acts/talks came across as a bit ""different"" to me.Family friendly: Yep, very family friendly. Just a few fight scenes. No bad words. No nekkid people. One cute kiss.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun. It kept my attention the entire time.
