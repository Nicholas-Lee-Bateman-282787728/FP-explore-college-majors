916475,A3ONCOK36KPOV8,B0009XT8UQ,A Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Slow paced, dull, and unimaginative. This film features terrible acting, laughable special effects, and an absolutely dreadful script. It spends more time on the uninteresting marital problems of the two leads than on the story, and is filled with every imaginable horror-sci fi cliche, including:1)an evil general, played in an embarassing performance by Jeff Fahey (Is work hard to find these days, Jeff?). We know he's evil because he describes himself as ""a patriot."" 2)a ""brilliant and beautiful scientist"", played by a Cameron Diaz wannabe with even more modest acting skills than Cameron, and 3)dialog we have heard in a million other dreadful films, such as, after the sharks attack two maintenance workers: Scientist #1: ""It's over"" Scientist #2 : ""No, it's just begun."" There is little action and surprisingly little gore. The real question is: How do wholly derivative and excrementally bad films like this get made? The answer is: Chumps like us rent them.

Blue Demon has that noticeable and irritating made-for-TV feeling about it, and the quality of the storytelling certainly does nothing to change the viewers mind.What had the potential to be a frightening movie involving deadly monster sharks attacking people was actually so bad it hurt.ALL the characters acting skills were horrible, music would constantly appear at all the inappropriate moments giving off the feeling I was watching a comedy film at times, the storytelling had completely missed the mark, the sharks didn't pose as much of a threat as they should have, and did I mention the characters were horrible?  Every time they introduced someone, there was no telling if they would stick around or not.The only part of the movie I liked was when the young daughter was going fishing with her father.  Everything else -including the terrible relationship between the two people working together that involved the woman taking the ring off her hand at one point early on- was terrible.A very bad attempt at a shark movie.",1,absolutely bad,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1060,"['Wow', 'movie', 'terrible', 'Blue', 'Demon', 'noticeable', 'irritating', 'made-for-TV', 'feeling', 'quality', 'storytelling', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'change', 'viewers', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'frightening', 'movie', 'involving', 'deadly', 'monster', 'sharks', 'attacking', 'people', 'was', 'actually', 'so', 'bad', 'characters', 'acting', 'skills', 'were', 'horrible', 'music', 'would', 'constantly', 'appear', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'giving', 'off', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'comedy', 'film', 'times', 'storytelling', 'had', 'completely', 'missed', 'mark', 'sharks', 'did', ""n't"", 'pose', 'much', 'threat', 'should', 'have', 'did', 'mention', 'characters', 'were', 'horrible', 'time', 'introduced', 'someone', 'was', 'telling', 'would', 'stick', 'around', 'not.The', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'going', 'fishing', 'father', 'Everything', 'else', '-including', 'terrible', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'working', 'together', 'involved', 'woman', 'taking', 'ring', 'off', 'hand', 'one', 'point', 'early', 'on-', 'was', 'terrible.A', 'very', 'bad', 'attempt', 'shark', 'movie']",Blue Demon

916478,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B0009XT8UQ,Ghoulie Guru,"[6, 9]","I'm a sucker for a good shark movie. Heck, I'm a sucker for a semi-decent shark movie. JAWS obviously set the bar pretty high, but there have been some close runners up in OPEN WATER and even DEEP BLUE SEA. So, having said that, I hope that you can understand how much it pains me to say that I couldn't find a single redeeming thing about BLUE DEMON. What's so bad about it? Well, despite the fact that the shark fins are all clearly tied on to a scuba diver's head, the main problem is that BLUE DEMON flounders around in a shallow pond known as: The un-scary, un-funny PG-13 Sci-Fi Channel horror-comedy.I wish someone would explain the recent trend behind PG-13 horror movies that are intentionally goofy to me. Like Carmen Electra's MONSTER ISLAND or even BOA VS. PYTHON. It's as if there's a whole generation of people that were brought up on Sci-Fi Original movies and R.L. Stine books. Who is the intended audience for these things? No one over the age of ten would find these movies remotely scary, and it seems like the filmmakers know that, so they make the movies intentionally quirky and self-effacing for the thirty-somethings. But the inside jokes and the sarcasm would go right over the head of the few ten year olds that were actually watching the movie to get scared. And then, just to confuse the audience even more, they have these semi-dramatic scenes where people are crying over lost friends or trying to mend their shattered marriage. The end result is a movie that's not scary, not funny and not dramatic. It's like a stew where none of the flavors work well together.It's impossible to critique anything individually in this latest addition to the intentionally goofy wanna-be scary movie genre - the whole thing stinks. The CG sharks, the acting, the dialog... especially the music, which sounds like it came directly from Ron Jeremy's personal collection of porn scores. In defense of the actors, they all seem to know that they're in DEEP BLUE SEA LITE, and they act appropriately. In other words, they mug for the camera, they make ridiculous faces and stomp around. The only thing missing is a few fart noises.

It was a long, long list.One of my favorites was right in the beginning of the film. The two doctors in charge of a rather ridiculous and, at this stage of our scientific development, quite impossible, repeatedly refer to each other as ""ex"". Truth is, they're still married, and the still wear their rings.Some drama is made about the wife's ring, and she runs out of the rather large science facility to a remote dock where the sharks swim to get soap so that she can get the ring off.Now come on. In this entire science building, there isn't a single bar of soap anywhere? And it's safer for to leave said building and venture into the shark's den (even if they are, supposedly, well controlled)?Nah.And we know what happens. The ring falls off. She bends to pick up the ring and falls face first into the water. By some strange fortune, she finds herself floating on her back (a neat trick, considering that she was unconscious), and she's rescued by her husband - er, ex-husband, I think - and their assistant.This example fairly well sets the tone of illogic that follows the film from beginning to end.I only watched this because it was on cable (OnDemand), and free. And I thought it would be funny to see how absolutely horrid it was.And I wasn't disappointed. It was horrid.Unless you enjoy laughing at stupid movies because they're so ridiculously stupid (although I have to say that the only way you could really be laughing is if you were doing what I was doing - compiling notes to write a review), this might be for you.

""Blue Demon"" is a tongue in cheek film about a military research program that genetically alters sharks so they fight and defeat terrorists. If you can't see the humor in that premise, something's wrong.As you can imagine -- and, if you've been reading along, you see -- that things vary quite a bit from this premise right away. Something goes badly wrong with the sharks' computer program, they break out of their containment hatch, swim around in California waterways, eat some people, and more.The film has no real stars; DeDee Pfeiffer, a ringer for Cameron Diaz that has appeared in ""CSI New York"", is the main charcater with Randall Batinkoff, who plays her husband and fellow researcher; ""Seinfeld"" short person star Danny Woodburn, who plays their boss; and veteran character actor Jeff Fahey, who plays the military general behind the doublecross. None of these actors enhanced their careers with this movie but I'm sure they'd all agree it was fun to make.That's becuase it's fun to watch. I agree with the other critics that say it's inane; that's what makes it fun. And while the computer-generated sharks would never be confused with real animals...well, this is a movie, right? Did someone out there confuse this for a documentary? The sharks aren't any worse than other computer-generated fish I've seen in other recent films.My capsule summary is this: don't go into this thinking you're going to see one of the great action-horror films of recent years.

I was not surprised ro see another film is made about sharks attacking humans -- and I was fairly entertained seeing 'Deep Blue Sea' -- but I never expected that this film could be so awful.First, you cannot call 'Blue Demon' a thriller.  The fact is, it tries to be many things at the same time.  Though it certainly is about the deadly sharks (6 of them) that attack the hapless people in the sea, there are 'comic' elements that are not particularly funny.  Look at the 'names' of the sharks (yes, they have names), which are Grucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, and Gummo.  Whoever thought of the idea calling killer sharks with the names of the Marx Brothers, must know that he is not making a thriller.  It's like calling a deadly shark Pee-wee or something.  And the sixth shark?  Sorry I forgot its name, being shocked to hear my favorite comedians' names.Oh, and the story.  Some institute is doing a government-finaced research about the possibility of training sharks to be the official guards protecting the coasts of USA from the invasion of terrorists.  I'm serious.  Moreover, for the reasons you don't care, the six sharks run away from the cage, and the scientists try to stop the inevitable consequences.  Now, you know what you see in this film by producer-turned- director Daniel Grodnik.  It's not 'Jaws'; it's not even 'Deep Blue Sea.'  It's more like a clone of 'Lake Placid' with less violence and actions.But the film's real problem is not its silly story.  It is the feeble direction that knows nothing about making thrilling scenes, doing funny spoofs, or giving us witty or at least decent dialogues.  When you see the heroine (and one of the researchers who should be very intelligent) just slips (like on banana peels) and tumbles into the sea, and the sharks swarm around her, you don't know how to react to this incredible stupidity.  You will be wondering 'Is this serious, or some joke?'To be fair, most of the actors are not bad (and most probably they are not taking the film seriously).  The researcher team comprise Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle's sister), Randall Batinkoff, Danny Woodburn, and Josh Hammond.  Jeff Fahey appears as pompous General holding a big cigar.There are not enough actions either, and if there are, they are not done well, mostly thrill-less and humor-less, and have no originality.  I like watching so-called B-actions, and always try to find good things about them, but here it was very hard for me to do that.",1,"Just a Warning -- This Is NOT 'Jaws,' Not Even 'Deep Blue Sea' -- Simply Awful",1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,2558,"['happen', 'have', 'chance', 'see', ""'Blue"", 'Demon', 'been', 'already', 'released', 'Japan', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'ro', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'sharks', 'attacking', 'humans', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertained', 'seeing', ""'Deep"", 'Blue', 'Sea', 'never', 'expected', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'awful.First', 'can', 'not', 'call', ""'Blue"", 'Demon', 'thriller', 'fact', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'certainly', 'deadly', 'sharks', '6', 'attack', 'hapless', 'people', 'sea', 'are', ""'comic"", 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Look', ""'names"", 'sharks', 'yes', 'have', 'names', 'are', 'Grucho', 'Harpo', 'Chico', 'Zeppo', 'Gummo', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'idea', 'calling', 'killer', 'sharks', 'names', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'must', 'know', 'not', 'making', 'thriller', 'calling', 'deadly', 'shark', 'Pee-wee', 'something', 'sixth', 'shark', 'Sorry', 'forgot', 'name', 'being', 'shocked', 'hear', 'favorite', 'comedians', 'names.Oh', 'story', 'institute', 'doing', 'government-finaced', 'research', 'possibility', 'training', 'sharks', 'be', 'official', 'guards', 'protecting', 'coasts', 'USA', 'invasion', 'terrorists', ""'m"", 'serious', 'Moreover', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'six', 'sharks', 'run', 'away', 'cage', 'scientists', 'try', 'stop', 'inevitable', 'consequences', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'producer-turned-', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Grodnik', 'not', ""'Jaws"", 'not', 'even', ""'Deep"", 'Blue', 'Sea', 'more', 'clone', ""'Lake"", 'Placid', 'less', 'violence', 'actions.But', 'film', 'real', 'problem', 'not', 'silly', 'story', 'feeble', 'direction', 'nothing', 'making', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'doing', 'funny', 'spoofs', 'giving', 'witty', 'least', 'decent', 'dialogues', 'When', 'see', 'heroine', 'one', 'researchers', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'intelligent', 'just', 'slips', 'banana', 'peels', 'sea', 'sharks', 'swarm', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'react', 'incredible', 'stupidity', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'serious', 'joke', 'be', 'fair', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'most', 'probably', 'are', 'not', 'taking', 'film', 'seriously', 'researcher', 'team', 'comprise', 'Dedee', 'Pfeiffer', 'Michelle', 'sister', 'Randall', 'Batinkoff', 'Danny', 'Woodburn', 'Josh', 'Hammond', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'as', 'pompous', 'General', 'holding', 'big', 'cigar.There', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'actions', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'mostly', 'thrill-less', 'humor-less', 'have', 'originality', 'watching', 'so-called', 'B-actions', 'always', 'try', 'find', 'good', 'things', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'do']",Blue Demon
