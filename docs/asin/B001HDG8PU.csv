It is suggested this is one of the last movies that Walter Pidgeon appeared in.  Disney found well-known actors to appear in his family movies.  In addition Walt Disney had the genius to found foreign actors.  The young actor, Gilles Bayant, was a 13-year old boy left on his own by a deceased Unclewho educated and raised him in the outback country of Canada.  The he goes to the estate of a Canine Breeder, finds employment,and center of Blue Ribbon Breed Red Dog.  This is an excellent family movie or for anyone regardless of age to gain an appreciation for the culture and ways of life in Canada.  Walt Disney had the talent to give the viewer an appreciation for civility among people in many ways of living.  The scenes and landscape of Canada, are an added benefit for this movie.  It is a plus to have such classicWalt Disney movies available.",5,"Walt Disney's Exclusive ""Big Red"" DVD",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,943,"['Disney', 'Big', 'Red', 'DVD', 'outstanding', 'classic', 'superb', 'actors', 'suggested', 'one', 'last', 'movies', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'appeared', 'Disney', 'found', 'well-known', 'actors', 'appear', 'family', 'movies', 'addition', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'genius', 'found', 'foreign', 'actors', 'young', 'actor', 'Gilles', 'Bayant', 'was', '13-year', 'old', 'boy', 'left', 'own', 'deceased', 'Unclewho', 'educated', 'raised', 'outback', 'country', 'Canada', 'estate', 'Canine', 'Breeder', 'employment', 'center', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'Breed', 'Red', 'Dog', 'excellent', 'family', 'movie', 'anyone', 'regardless', 'age', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'culture', 'ways', 'life', 'Canada', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'talent', 'give', 'viewer', 'appreciation', 'civility', 'people', 'many', 'ways', 'living', 'scenes', 'landscape', 'Canada', 'are', 'added', 'benefit', 'movie', 'plus', 'have', 'such', 'classicWalt', 'Disney', 'movies', 'available']",N/A
