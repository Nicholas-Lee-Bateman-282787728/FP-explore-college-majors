118101,A2582KMXLK2P06,0790747693,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Stephen King's Cat's Eye is entertaining... until the final 20 minutes.  Stephen King tries to combine two (or three I suppose) stories together and make an interesting concept but ultimately misses the mark and becomes really confusing.It begins with a family man with a horrible smoking addiction so he seeks help and finds out the most effective way to give up the horrible habit is by being threatened to do so by a mafia man.  How is this man threatened you're probably wondering?  If he were to sneak a cigarette, the people watching over this smoker (and following every step he takes!) would have to drag the man back to an office room where a torture chamber is hidden behind a wall.  In this torture room is where the man's wife will be forced to jump around like crazy because the floor can produce electrocution-like effects.  Only Stephen King could come up with something so amazingly disturbing!That's not even the worst part- if the man sneaks a second cigarette, now his wife and kids will be tortured by being raped and have other horrible things done to them.  Wow, I think with these potential situations it'd probably be totally wise to just persevere all the shaking and uncomfortable vibes associated with the addiction of nicotine, haha.For a while we see the man going about his day the usual day but with the side effects occasionally kicking in concerning what one feels whey they haven't had a cigarette in a while.  Eventually however, the story switches into the man being forced to hang outside a building and walk across a tiny ledge without falling.  This segment is about 15 minutes and pretty good.  Not as good as the cigarette cravings earlier, however.By the way, while all this is going on (with both mini stories) there's a mysterious cat roaming around wherever the threatened man is going.  This cat is basically serving as the main character though it's not obvious until the end.After this action-packed segment however, suddenly we experience a BIG change- the final 25 minutes of storytelling involving Drew Barrymore's child character having to deal with a miniature monster coming out of her bedroom wall with a knife and tormenting her while she sleeps.  Strange, huh?  Yes, very strange!  It's a big ""WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?!?!?"" moment for sure.  I believe saving this particular story for the conclusion was a big mistake because it felt too heroic in a childish kind of way.  This story change is especially unappealing for those that enjoyed the first half and wanted to see a conclusion to the man with the smoking habit.  I sure did, at least.The biggest problem attempting to combine several of these stories together is that the smoking storyline never reached its full potential.  There was clearly more story to tell involving the possible torturing of the man's wife/children but... it never occurs thanks to the next story coming into the picture.  Pretty disappointing in my opinion.  Perhaps keeping these three tales completely separate would have been a better option.Still, the concept is original and kept me curious what was going to happen next, so Cat's Eyes is most certainly a movie I recommend watching.  I like how the Police song ""Every Breath You Take"" (MEGA popular song in the mid 80's for those of you who weren't born yet) was a theme throughout the movie thanks to the lyrics relating perfectly to the storyline taking place.  I actually didn't realize how well the lyrics match the story until the film was over!",4,the ultimate anti-smoking message,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,3500,"['Stephen', 'King', 'Cat', 'Eye', 'entertaining', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'tries', 'combine', 'two', 'three', 'suppose', 'together', 'make', 'interesting', 'concept', 'ultimately', 'mark', 'really', 'confusing.It', 'begins', 'family', 'man', 'horrible', 'smoking', 'addiction', 'help', 'out', 'most', 'effective', 'way', 'give', 'up', 'horrible', 'habit', 'being', 'threatened', 'do', 'so', 'mafia', 'man', 'How', 'man', 'threatened', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'were', 'sneak', 'cigarette', 'people', 'watching', 'smoker', 'following', 'step', 'would', 'have', 'drag', 'man', 'back', 'office', 'room', 'where', 'torture', 'chamber', 'hidden', 'wall', 'torture', 'room', 'where', 'man', 'wife', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'jump', 'crazy', 'floor', 'can', 'produce', 'electrocution-like', 'effects', 'Only', 'Stephen', 'King', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'so', 'amazingly', 'disturbing', 'not', 'even', 'worst', 'part-', 'man', 'second', 'cigarette', 'now', 'wife', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'tortured', 'being', 'raped', 'have', 'other', 'horrible', 'things', 'done', 'Wow', 'think', 'potential', 'situations', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'totally', 'wise', 'just', 'persevere', 'shaking', 'uncomfortable', 'vibes', 'associated', 'addiction', 'nicotine', 'haha.For', 'while', 'see', 'man', 'going', 'day', 'usual', 'day', 'side', 'effects', 'occasionally', 'kicking', 'concerning', 'what', 'one', 'whey', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'cigarette', 'while', 'Eventually', 'however', 'story', 'man', 'being', 'forced', 'hang', 'building', 'walk', 'tiny', 'ledge', 'falling', 'segment', '15', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'good', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'cigarette', 'cravings', 'earlier', 'however.By', 'way', 'going', 'mini', 'stories', 'mysterious', 'cat', 'roaming', 'around', 'threatened', 'man', 'going', 'cat', 'basically', 'serving', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'obvious', 'end.After', 'action-packed', 'segment', 'however', 'suddenly', 'experience', 'BIG', 'change-', 'final', '25', 'minutes', 'storytelling', 'involving', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'child', 'character', 'having', 'deal', 'miniature', 'monster', 'coming', 'bedroom', 'wall', 'knife', 'tormenting', 'Strange', 'huh', 'Yes', 'very', 'strange', 'big', 'WHAT', 'HECK', 'JUST', 'HAPPENED', 'moment', 'sure', 'believe', 'saving', 'particular', 'story', 'conclusion', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'felt', 'too', 'heroic', 'childish', 'kind', 'way', 'story', 'change', 'especially', 'unappealing', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'wanted', 'see', 'conclusion', 'man', 'smoking', 'habit', 'sure', 'did', 'least.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'attempting', 'combine', 'several', 'stories', 'together', 'smoking', 'storyline', 'never', 'reached', 'full', 'potential', 'was', 'clearly', 'more', 'story', 'tell', 'involving', 'possible', 'torturing', 'man', 'wife/children', 'never', 'thanks', 'next', 'story', 'coming', 'picture', 'Pretty', 'disappointing', 'opinion', 'Perhaps', 'keeping', 'three', 'tales', 'completely', 'separate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'option.Still', 'concept', 'original', 'kept', 'curious', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Cat', 'Eyes', 'most', 'certainly', 'movie', 'recommend', 'watching', 'how', 'Police', 'song', 'Breath', 'Take', 'MEGA', 'popular', 'song', 'mid', '80', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'born', 'yet', 'was', 'theme', 'movie', 'thanks', 'lyrics', 'relating', 'perfectly', 'storyline', 'taking', 'place', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'well', 'lyrics', 'match', 'story', 'film', 'was']",Cat's Eye VHS

This time out we get 3 dark stories of the bizarre, all tied together by a cat that's trying to get from NYC to North Carolina to save a girl in distress. QUITTERS INC. is about a poor schmuck (James Woods) who is convinced by a friend to try a new cigarette smoking termination program. What he doesn't know is that the founder was a mafia-type, and that mob tactics are used in order to make people quit their nasty habit! Alan King is perfect as the guy who will utilize any / all methods of persuasion at his disposal to keep his clients honest; including abduction, torture, and bodily mutilation! Next is THE LEDGE, about a washed up tennis pro (Robert Hays) who is given a deadly ultimatum by the mob boss who's tired of him sleeping with his wife. He can either get busted for the heroin that's been planted in the trunk of his car, or walk all the way around the outside of the building on the five inch ledge that's about a hundred feet above the ground! This is an excellent story of twisty revenge. Finally, we have the third segment with a young Drew Barrymore (E.T., Firestarter) as a little girl who has an evil troll living in her bedroom wall. In this one the cat emerges as the hero. Candy Clark (American Graffiti) is exasperating as the mom who thinks the kitty is up to no good and almost keeps it from saving her daughter's life!

First, a life-long smoker gets more than he bargained for when he joins Quitters, a company that uses rather persuasive methods of torture to help their victi-- ""customers"" stop smoking. Next, the frisky feline is taken home by a jealous crime boss, who will only spare the life of his wife's lover if he can successfully navigate himself around the ledge of their rooftop penthouse. Finally, the cat runs off to find a new home with a loving little girl. Her mother makes her keep the cat outside, not knowing that an evil little troll is attempting to steal her daughter's soul.

This is probably my favorite story found in this collection. James Woods wants to quit smoking, turning to Quitters Inc. to help. Unfortunately Quitters Inc. uses some pretty extreme methods to help folks kick the habit. With a large dose of dark humor, and Alan King as the nefarious head of Quitters Inc. you can't help but chuckle through this first entry.2. - The Ledge. This is another solid entry as Robert Hays is coerced by his lover's husband to walk around the outside of a casino building when caught trying to run away with the man's wife. There are a few tense moments here or there and it's another fun entry.3. - The General. This is where the film kind of falls apart for me.

In each city, he comes across 3 different horror scenarios.In the first story, he's captured by a clinic called ""Quitter's Inc"" that helps people quit smoking.  Their methods, however, are similar to something the Godfather would dream up.  You'll quit smoking because you'll be given an offer you can't refuse.In the second story, he temporarily lives with a madman who makes a bet with his wife's lover that involves the lover having to walk along a ledge around a casino building.And in the final third story, he lives with a young girl who's slowly having her  life  drained away by a troll living in her wall.All 3 stories are entertaining, but the special effects are fake looking.  The acting was just mediocre with the lover on the ledge and Drew Barrymore being the worst of the bunch.Speaking of Drew, in each story, there's an apparition of her telling the cat to come find her which is, besides being corny, confusing, too.  Drew appears in all 3 stories as a different character and it's only the last story that is really about her.  So I didn't get what that was all about.The movie's ending can be interpreted two ways, either a happy or sinister ending.  I interpreted it as happy, kind of like a psyche on the viewer.I'm a cat lover so it bothered me to see this cat being put through hell in this movie.  I didn't want to know what the director did to make this cat jump around in the electric shock room or hiss.  Cat's don't hiss unless they're really scared.I did, however, like all the Stephen King trivia.  Throughout this movie, there's a Can-you-spot-the-Stephen-King movie?  For instance, the movie starts with the cat running from a rabid dog like ""Cujo""...he runs past a red car with a bumper sticker that says, ""I am evil.  I am Christine""....a man is watching the movie ""The Dead Zone"" on tv....and a woman is reading the book ""Pet Semetary"" in bed.  Maybe there's more references, but those are the ones I noticed.Also, I thought it was interesting that the girl's doll is named Norma Jean.  Maybe it doesn't mean anything or maybe it means that King is a big time Marilyn Monroe fan.Overall, these stories were entertaining to watch, but not terribly scary.",3,3 mildly entertaining stories,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,2243,"['movie', 'cat', '3', 'different', 'cities', 'city', '3', 'different', 'horror', 'scenarios.In', 'first', 'story', 'captured', 'clinic', 'called', 'Quitter', 'Inc', 'people', 'quit', 'smoking', 'methods', 'however', 'are', 'similar', 'something', 'Godfather', 'would', 'dream', 'up', ""'ll"", 'quit', 'smoking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'given', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse.In', 'second', 'story', 'temporarily', 'madman', 'who', 'bet', 'wife', 'lover', 'lover', 'having', 'walk', 'ledge', 'casino', 'building.And', 'final', 'third', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'slowly', 'having', 'life', 'drained', 'away', 'troll', 'living', 'wall.All', '3', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fake', 'looking', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'mediocre', 'lover', 'ledge', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'being', 'worst', 'bunch.Speaking', 'Drew', 'story', 'apparition', 'telling', 'cat', 'come', 'being', 'corny', 'confusing', 'too', 'Drew', '3', 'stories', 'different', 'character', 'only', 'last', 'story', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'was', 'about.The', 'movie', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'two', 'ways', 'happy', 'sinister', 'ending', 'interpreted', 'happy', 'kind', 'psyche', 'viewer.I', ""'m"", 'cat', 'bothered', 'see', 'cat', 'being', 'put', 'hell', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'did', 'make', 'cat', 'jump', 'around', 'electric', 'shock', 'room', 'hiss', 'Cat', 'do', ""n't"", 'hiss', ""'re"", 'really', 'scared.I', 'did', 'however', 'Stephen', 'King', 'trivia', 'movie', 'Can-you-spot-the-Stephen-King', 'movie', 'instance', 'movie', 'cat', 'running', 'rabid', 'dog', 'Cujo', 'red', 'car', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'am', 'evil', 'am', 'Christine', '.a', 'man', 'watching', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'tv', '.and', 'woman', 'reading', 'book', 'Pet', 'Semetary', 'bed', 'Maybe', 'more', 'references', 'are', 'ones', 'noticed.Also', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'girl', 'doll', 'named', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'maybe', 'King', 'big', 'time', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'fan.Overall', 'stories', 'were', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'not', 'terribly', 'scary']",Cat's Eye VHS

118117,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,0790747693,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","CAT'S EYEI am and have always been a big fan of Stephen King, from the books to the screen and everything in between. So it is no secret that I am a fan of this film. In fact I believe it is one of the most underrated of all the King related films that have been made. This movie featured three different tales all interlocking through a cat, two of which were based on King's short stories from the book ""Night Shift"" while the final was made for the film. The script was written by King himself and directed by Lewis Teague who also helmed the King film ""Cujo"".Three different stories are connected by a cat that is getting visions of a little girl who needs help. On his way to finding this girl in the final story he comes across two different situations that put him in danger. The first story involves a man who really wants to quit smoking and will go to any length to stop, or is that forced? Then he moves on to meet a few people stuck in a love triangle and the situation they end up in. Finally the cat arrives at his final destination looking for the little girl that has somehow been calling out to him. What he finds may be his biggest test yet.I have always been a fan of the anthology films and this is one of my favorites. How could it not be with King penning it with two based on short stories that I already loved. The first story ""Quitters Inc."" stars James Woods and is an excellent start to the film. In this story he is trying to quit smoking and goes to a business that specializes in helping with those kinda problems. The thing is if he is caught smoking his wife and daughter will be tormented and punished for it. The punishments would continue to get worse like being put in a shock cage or being raped. He is told that if he continues even after all that then he will be killed. I will not say if he smokes or not but I will mention that I loved the ""Watching You"" scene with the song from The Police.The second story is just as good with a man wanting to run off with another man's wife and the consequences of that. This story is called ""The ledge"" and I am sure you can guess why, the title refers to the punishment the man must go through. The catch is that if he completes it then he will be forgiven and aloud to live and get the girl. What happens is fun to watch and is a great addition to the film. This brings us to the final story, ""General"". It is called that because that is what the little girl [Drew Barrymore] names the cat when he finally arrives at her home.Now I am sure most people remember this segment the most since it was the poster and such. This one involves a troll that is after the little girl at night. The problem is that her mother does not want the cat in the house at night. This of course means he cannot protect her. This is probably my favorite of the stories because the cat is the star here.Also I should point out that since the director did ""Cujo"" it is Cujo that is chasing our feline hero at the beginning of the film. You should also watch for a certain car named Christine to appear in the film as well as other nods to other King works. Also the setting of the final story is the same town that ""Maximum Overdrive"" took place in. those are a little of the things you might notice or hear about on the commentary track that the director does. This is a fun flick that I do recommend to any King or horror fans out there. Every time I watch this it takes me back, I love it.",5,CAT'S EYE,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3449,"['CAT', 'EYEI', 'am', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'screen', 'everything', 'secret', 'am', 'fan', 'film', 'fact', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'King', 'related', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'featured', 'three', 'different', 'tales', 'interlocking', 'cat', 'two', 'were', 'based', 'King', 'short', 'stories', 'book', 'Night', 'Shift', 'final', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'King', 'directed', 'Lewis', 'Teague', 'who', 'also', 'helmed', 'King', 'film', 'Cujo', '.Three', 'different', 'stories', 'are', 'connected', 'cat', 'getting', 'visions', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'help', 'way', 'finding', 'girl', 'final', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'situations', 'put', 'danger', 'first', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'quit', 'smoking', 'will', 'go', 'length', 'stop', 'forced', 'Then', 'meet', 'few', 'people', 'stuck', 'love', 'triangle', 'situation', 'end', 'up', 'Finally', 'cat', 'final', 'destination', 'looking', 'little', 'girl', 'somehow', 'been', 'calling', 'What', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'test', 'yet.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'anthology', 'films', 'one', 'favorites', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'King', 'penning', 'two', 'based', 'short', 'stories', 'already', 'loved', 'first', 'story', 'Quitters', 'Inc.', 'James', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'start', 'film', 'story', 'trying', 'quit', 'smoking', 'business', 'helping', 'kinda', 'problems', 'thing', 'caught', 'smoking', 'wife', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'tormented', 'punished', 'punishments', 'would', 'continue', 'get', 'worse', 'being', 'put', 'shock', 'cage', 'being', 'raped', 'told', 'even', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'will', 'mention', 'loved', 'Watching', 'scene', 'song', 'Police.The', 'second', 'story', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'man', 'wanting', 'run', 'off', 'man', 'wife', 'consequences', 'story', 'called', 'ledge', 'am', 'sure', 'can', 'guess', 'why', 'title', 'refers', 'punishment', 'man', 'must', 'go', 'catch', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'forgiven', 'aloud', 'live', 'get', 'girl', 'What', 'fun', 'watch', 'great', 'addition', 'film', 'final', 'story', 'General', 'called', 'what', 'little', 'girl', '[', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', ']', 'cat', 'when', 'finally', 'home.Now', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'segment', 'most', 'was', 'poster', 'such', 'one', 'troll', 'little', 'girl', 'night', 'problem', 'mother', 'not', 'want', 'cat', 'house', 'night', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'protect', 'probably', 'favorite', 'stories', 'cat', 'star', 'here.Also', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'director', 'did', 'Cujo', 'Cujo', 'chasing', 'feline', 'hero', 'beginning', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'watch', 'certain', 'car', 'named', 'Christine', 'appear', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'nods', 'other', 'King', 'works', 'Also', 'setting', 'final', 'story', 'same', 'town', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'took', 'place', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'might', 'notice', 'hear', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'fun', 'flick', 'do', 'recommend', 'King', 'horror', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'Every', 'time', 'watch', 'back', 'love']",Cat's Eye VHS

118120,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790747693,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[7, 8]","Three short films in one long film tied up by the perigrination of a cat looking for the girl who is going to adopt it as a pet. The cat will find the girl. The first adventure reveals the obsession of smoking in a society that considers that activity as a quasi-crime. Some people are ready to do anything to quit and the society is also ready to do anything to force the reluctant candidates to quitting to quit. The procedure is to punish the people the smoker loves to make him - in this film it is only men that are concerned, and we do have to question why - quit and stick to his decision. This reveals a society that has privatized such a mission and this mission becomes criminal in its own way, even if the ethical aim is to be considered. To torture innocent people may be effective but it is unethical in all possible ways. The second adventure has to do with betting among high life criminals : the rich who make their dough from all kinds of illegal activities, such as drugs. And what happens when the stake of the bet is the wife of one crook ? Criminal challenges, murder and vengeance. Breath taking and unbearable for people who suffer of vertigo. Funny too in the reversal of the situation from one vengeance to the next. The third story is more humane and dark at the same time. Cats are nice pets but here a mother has a fixation against such an animal and is ready to do anything to get rid of it. But cats are obstinate and children, here a girl, are also very powerfully determined to get their ways. The  Kobold  is absolutely charming in its evilness though I prefer the good  Kobolds  I have met so often in germanic traditions. But its end is definitely Dante-like. There must be a special hell for these vicious and obnoxious beings that only want to hurt and wound if not even kill poor little defenseless children. But cats are definitely not defenseless, far from it. Careful with children : to watch such a film might give them nightmares with many boogeymen in them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,A cat is a God in the wings of life,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,2022,"['Three', 'short', 'films', 'one', 'long', 'film', 'tied', 'up', 'perigrination', 'cat', 'looking', 'girl', 'who', 'going', 'adopt', 'pet', 'cat', 'will', 'find', 'girl', 'first', 'adventure', 'obsession', 'smoking', 'society', 'activity', 'quasi-crime', 'people', 'are', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'quit', 'society', 'also', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'force', 'reluctant', 'candidates', 'quitting', 'quit', 'procedure', 'punish', 'people', 'smoker', 'make', 'film', 'only', 'men', 'are', 'concerned', 'do', 'have', 'question', 'why', 'quit', 'stick', 'decision', 'society', 'privatized', 'mission', 'mission', 'criminal', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'ethical', 'aim', 'be', 'considered', 'torture', 'innocent', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'effective', 'unethical', 'possible', 'ways', 'second', 'adventure', 'do', 'betting', 'high', 'life', 'criminals', 'rich', 'who', 'make', 'dough', 'kinds', 'illegal', 'activities', 'such', 'drugs', 'what', 'when', 'stake', 'bet', 'wife', 'one', 'crook', 'Criminal', 'challenges', 'murder', 'vengeance', 'Breath', 'taking', 'unbearable', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'vertigo', 'Funny', 'too', 'reversal', 'situation', 'one', 'vengeance', 'next', 'third', 'story', 'more', 'humane', 'dark', 'same', 'time', 'Cats', 'are', 'nice', 'pets', 'here', 'mother', 'fixation', 'animal', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'rid', 'cats', 'are', 'obstinate', 'children', 'here', 'girl', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'powerfully', 'determined', 'get', 'ways', 'Kobold', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'evilness', 'prefer', 'good', 'Kobolds', 'have', 'met', 'so', 'often', 'germanic', 'traditions', 'end', 'definitely', 'Dante-like', 'must', 'be', 'special', 'hell', 'vicious', 'obnoxious', 'beings', 'only', 'want', 'hurt', 'wound', 'not', 'even', 'kill', 'poor', 'little', 'defenseless', 'children', 'cats', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'defenseless', 'far', 'Careful', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'might', 'give', 'nightmares', 'many', 'boogeymen', 'them.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Cat's Eye VHS

The stories are titled Quitters Inc., The Ledge and General.Quitters IncThis tale is about a man who wants to quit smoking and he goes to a company named Quitters Inc.  They are a coaching company to motivate people and the motivation is very strongly applied.  As he fills out the forms another man has his wife come out in tears and with her shoes off.  The wife starts beating her husband with her shoes.  The manager shows Mr. Morrison (James Woods) a cat in a room being shocked on a metal grid floor and the penalties get worse from there....The LedgeThe cat gets free and he moves onto a boat to get into New Jersey.  The cat is the basis of a wager where a casino owner, Mr. Cressner (Kenneth McMillian) bets the cat will make it across a busy street in front of the casino.  He wins as the cat makes it and causes a major wreck in the street he just crossed. Cressner takes the cat home as he just made $2,000 on the bet.  The cat at least deservers some milk.Cressner's wife is having an affair and he has the man kidnapped and tells him that if he can walk around the ledge of his penthouse apartment then he will divorce his wife.  The trial leads to problems and turnabout is fair play.....The GeneralThe cat gets away again and he rides a train all the way to Wilmington, North Carolina.  There the cat meets a girl, Amanda (Drew Barrymore) who likes him and names him General.  There are other new guests in the home.  The two legged kind about 8 to 12 inches tall with sharp teeth.  The Troll likes the little girl and wants to do her harm and the only thing that can save her is a cat that the mother hates and wants to take to the animal shelter....This is a good DVD if you like Stephen King's stories.  It is always entertaining to see his imagination come to life on the screen.  I enjoyed the stories but I am a Stephen King freak.

The movie cannot be completely categorized in any one genre since each story attempts to create a different mood. The only pervasive style, however, is dark comedy.The first segment is nothing but humor, with a slight touch of morbid moments. A good example of the type of humor that's in this story is when James Woods' character has tried to quit smoking and he goes to a party. The room is completely smoke-filled and everybody offers him a cigarette every three seconds. Soon, he starts to hallucinate--and sees a giant pack of cigarettes walking around and taunting him. Obviously, this isn't horror.The second segment is the most serious of all three. It is supposed to be a suspense story, and it is mostly successful. I've always enjoyed it, but given that it is surrounded by much campier material, it seems out of place here.The third segment is an adventure story. It could, because of the presence of the troll, be considered a horror by some viewers, but it is incredibly silly. It's the story of a cat fighting out a duel with a little monster, replete with Howie-Mandel-esque voice-overs. It alternates quickly between humor and adventure, but it is not scary unless you are a small child.The movie suffers only for two reasons: one is that some special effects shots have suffered greatly (although quite a few are still amazing). The other is that whenever the movie does try to be serious, it never works as well as it should. It's like watching a clown do a routine with seltzer water, and then trying to recite a soliloquy from &quot;Hamlet&quot; without changing his make-up. By the time the movie does reach its more serious moments, you'll already be in a laughing mood.",4,"Mostly a comedy, but definitely not a horror.",1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,1777,"['think', 'odd', 'people', 'view', 'movie', 'horror', 'then', 'get', 'upset', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'categorized', 'one', 'genre', 'story', 'attempts', 'create', 'different', 'mood', 'only', 'pervasive', 'style', 'however', 'dark', 'comedy.The', 'first', 'segment', 'nothing', 'humor', 'slight', 'touch', 'morbid', 'moments', 'good', 'example', 'type', 'humor', 'story', 'when', 'James', 'Woods', 'character', 'tried', 'quit', 'smoking', 'party', 'room', 'completely', 'smoke-filled', 'everybody', 'cigarette', 'three', 'seconds', 'Soon', 'hallucinate', 'giant', 'pack', 'cigarettes', 'walking', 'around', 'taunting', 'Obviously', ""n't"", 'horror.The', 'second', 'segment', 'most', 'serious', 'three', 'supposed', 'be', 'suspense', 'story', 'mostly', 'successful', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'given', 'surrounded', 'much', 'campier', 'material', 'place', 'here.The', 'third', 'segment', 'adventure', 'story', 'could', 'presence', 'troll', 'be', 'considered', 'horror', 'viewers', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'story', 'cat', 'fighting', 'out', 'duel', 'little', 'monster', 'replete', 'Howie-Mandel-esque', 'voice-overs', 'quickly', 'humor', 'adventure', 'not', 'scary', 'are', 'small', 'child.The', 'movie', 'suffers', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'shots', 'have', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'quite', 'few', 'are', 'still', 'amazing', 'other', 'whenever', 'movie', 'try', 'be', 'serious', 'never', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'watching', 'clown', 'do', 'routine', 'seltzer', 'water', 'then', 'trying', 'recite', 'soliloquy', 'quot', 'Hamlet', 'quot', 'changing', 'make-up', 'time', 'movie', 'reach', 'more', 'serious', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'already', 'be', 'laughing', 'mood']",Cat's Eye VHS

The cat finds itself in the city where it sees a vision of a girl asking it for help.  Shortly after the cat is grabbed and put in the first story.The cat finds itself as a test animal at a stop-smoking clinic run by Alan King.  The success of the clinic is not based on psychology or diet, but on extortion and torture.  The cat manages to get away.As the cat tries to cross a busy Vegas street, he becomes the subject of a bet and winds up in a penthouse suite were a deadly game is to be played out.  James Woods has been having an affair with the penthouse owner's wife.  To protect his life he must follow a ledge all the way around the building.Finally, the cat manages to reach the home of a young Drew Barrymore where he becomes a pet.  No sooner does he arrive than we find out the girl is being menaced by a creature that lives in her bedroom wall.  Only the cat can save her from the diminutive menace.While technically an anthology movie, this one works a little better than most.  Following the cat through the stories really is an effective way of tying the separate tales together.

Is it any good? Yes and No. All the best parts have nothing to do with Drew, and quite honestly, she didn't even have much to do in the movie.To call this a `movie' would be incorrect. Its more of a `collection of vignettes'. The film is divided into three broad sections, and each has nothing to do with the other, except for the fact that one single cat plays the observer in all the segments. The cat `sees' Drew ask him for help in the first scene, and he goes through various situations all trying to find her. The final piece of the movie is when the cat finds Drew and is adopted by her. But not so quick! His destiny is finally revealed. Turns out there is an evil goblin that comes out at night in Drews' room to `take away her soul', and the climax is a hilarious fight between the cat and the goblin. No prizes for guessing who wins.This is by no stretch of the imagination a `horror' film. With all its' early 1980's `special effects', it borders on camp, and really, its quite watchable. The middle of the film sags (it has nothing to do with the cat, instead its all about one man being tortured by another, by making him hang off the edge of a high-rise building) but I really can't hold it against the makers if this was all in the book that Stephen King wrote. Remind me never to read that book though! Ah yes, the first part of the movie has an inane segment where a mans' wife is forcibly tortured unless he quits smoking (??). This sort of bizarre theme might work if handled differently, but here it becomes satire.And yes, Drew Barrymore acts terribly and is in the film for maybe ten minutes.Three Stars. Despite being thoroughly idiotic and dated, this is one of those perfect drunk-night movies where you can point to the screen and laugh out loud with all your friends.

King's dark humor pervades throughout.  In the opening sequence, the cat is chased by a crazed dog (Cujo) and almost run over by a car (Christine).  The cat's misadventures frame the three stories involved.  In the first, ""Quitters Inc."" the cat finds himself a guinea pig at a weird smoke cessation outfit, run by a sinister Alan King.  James Wood stars as the man who finds out that kicking the habit isn't quite so easy and the repercussions for failure painfully wrought.  The cat escapes from here and ends up the new companion for a weasly gambler who is about to extinguish his wife's tennisboy lover in a most unique fashion.  He makes him walk the five inch ledge of a high rise and offers him everything if he can make it.  Kenneth McMillan is the gleeful gambler and Robert Hays (Airplane) the unfortunate lover.  Tabby once again escapes, however, and ends up with Drew Barrymore and her parents (Candy Clark, James Naughton).

Scripted by THE modern horror-meister himself, CAT'S EYE (a.k.a. STEPHEN KING'S CAT'S EYE) features adaptations of two of King's previously published short stories and one original tale, all tied together with a feline-centric wraparound.The first segment, ""Quitter's Inc.,"" is a dark comedy in which a chronic smoker (James Woods) engages the services of an professional firm to help him break his nasty habit, but he doubts his decision when he learns that the organization's CEO (Alan King) is a former Mob boss who utilizes the ""techniques"" of his previous profession to ""help"" current clients.  This is definitely the strongest of the three tales.Segment two, ""The Ledge,"" again involves an underworld kingpin (Kenneth McMillan), this time one who forces his wife's lover (Robert Hays) to engage in a questionable bet.  Not as clever nor as interesting as the first story, but not too bad either.""The General,"" the final segment of the trio, is about an abnormally intelligent cat who, despite protests from the mother (Candy Clark), ""adopts"" a family and moves into their rural home.  Unbenknownst to the humans, the feline's raison d'etre is to defend the daughter (Drew Barrymore) from the attacks of a wicked woodland troll who has also claimed squatting rights in the home.  Definitely the weakest of the three stories--and thematically out of step with the other two--though the animatronics FX for the wee creature are kinda cool.The final segment is also meant to be the climax of the wraparound, but that might be rather unclear to some viewers.  Director Lewis Teague has claimed that the wraparound's prologue was originally longer and made its connection to ""The General"" much more obvious, but the resulting ambiguity was created by studio-enforced cuts beyond Lewis' control.  Pity.  The overall movie might have been more cohesive if studio suits had kept their scissors away from the director's and screenwriter's joint vision.CAT'S EYE is not the best film based on the works of Stephen King, to be sure, but it is still a well-made and entertaining diversion.  Jack Cardiff's cinematography is excellent, the editing is top-notch, and the pacing of the stories is good.  And director Teague--who earlier directed CUJO (1983), another King adaptation--elicits great performances from most of the cast.  Genre buffs, especially fans of writer King, will enjoy spotting all of the self-referential--and often humorously self-deprecating--in-jokes (which include the killer car Christine and a clip from 1983's THE DEAD ZONE, among others).  Also watch for the very brief appearance of actor Charles S. Dutton in one of his first screen appearances.The DVD from Warner seems about as low-budget as the film itself, but it still offers a nice digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen.  And unlike a lot of Warner cheapies, there is also an informative feature commentary with director Teague.  Well worth amazon.com's VERY reasonable price of admission.",3,Wee Three King's,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,3102,"['most', 'anthology', 'movies', '1985', 'flick', 'rather', 'uneven', 'regarding', 'quality', 'various', 'stories', 'Scripted', 'modern', 'horror-meister', 'CAT', 'EYE', 'a.k.a', 'STEPHEN', 'KING', 'CAT', 'EYE', 'adaptations', 'two', 'King', 'previously', 'published', 'short', 'stories', 'one', 'original', 'tale', 'tied', 'together', 'feline-centric', 'wraparound.The', 'first', 'segment', 'Quitter', 'Inc.', 'dark', 'comedy', 'chronic', 'smoker', 'James', 'Woods', 'services', 'professional', 'firm', 'help', 'break', 'nasty', 'habit', 'decision', 'when', 'organization', 'CEO', 'Alan', 'King', 'former', 'Mob', 'boss', 'who', 'techniques', 'previous', 'profession', 'help', 'current', 'clients', 'definitely', 'strongest', 'three', 'tales.Segment', 'two', 'Ledge', 'again', 'underworld', 'kingpin', 'Kenneth', 'McMillan', 'time', 'one', 'who', 'wife', 'lover', 'Robert', 'Hays', 'engage', 'questionable', 'bet', 'Not', 'clever', 'as', 'interesting', 'first', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'General', 'final', 'segment', 'trio', 'abnormally', 'intelligent', 'cat', 'who', 'protests', 'mother', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'adopts', 'family', 'moves', 'rural', 'home', 'Unbenknownst', 'humans', 'feline', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'defend', 'daughter', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'attacks', 'wicked', 'woodland', 'troll', 'who', 'also', 'claimed', 'squatting', 'rights', 'home', 'Definitely', 'weakest', 'three', 'stories', 'thematically', 'step', 'other', 'two', 'animatronics', 'FX', 'wee', 'creature', 'are', 'kinda', 'cool.The', 'final', 'segment', 'also', 'meant', 'be', 'climax', 'wraparound', 'might', 'be', 'rather', 'unclear', 'viewers', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Teague', 'claimed', 'wraparound', 'prologue', 'was', 'originally', 'longer', 'made', 'connection', 'General', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'resulting', 'ambiguity', 'was', 'created', 'studio-enforced', 'cuts', 'Lewis', 'control', 'Pity', 'overall', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'cohesive', 'studio', 'suits', 'had', 'kept', 'scissors', 'away', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'joint', 'vision.CAT', 'EYE', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'based', 'works', 'Stephen', 'King', 'be', 'sure', 'still', 'well-made', 'entertaining', 'diversion', 'Jack', 'Cardiff', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'editing', 'top-notch', 'pacing', 'stories', 'good', 'director', 'Teague', 'who', 'earlier', 'directed', 'CUJO', '1983', 'King', 'adaptation', 'great', 'performances', 'most', 'cast', 'Genre', 'buffs', 'especially', 'fans', 'writer', 'King', 'will', 'enjoy', 'spotting', 'self-referential', 'often', 'humorously', 'self-deprecating', 'in-jokes', 'include', 'killer', 'car', 'Christine', 'clip', '1983', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'others', 'Also', 'watch', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'actor', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'one', 'first', 'screen', 'appearances.The', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'as', 'low-budget', 'film', 'still', 'nice', 'digital', 'transfer', 'film', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'lot', 'Warner', 'cheapies', 'also', 'informative', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Teague', 'Well', 'amazon.com', 'VERY', 'reasonable', 'price', 'admission']",Cat's Eye VHS

118137,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0790747693,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","I like to think of anthologies as short tales similar to those told around a campfire late at night. Out in the woods, darkness everywhere, with the trees swaying, and people huddled close around a bright and sparking fire. One person will begin telling a tale, something of an urban legend, perhaps a made up story, to frighten the other listeners into scooting that much closer to each other. Some may try to laugh off the willies, yet it is these same people who are also the ones to jump at the abrupt sound of an owl hooting, or a twig snapping, or a frog croaking. Here we have a collection of short stories, one that's older but better than most, penned by King himself when he was still great and grand.The central theme is that of a cat trying to get to a little girl to rescue her from some strange troll beast thingie. Why? Well..it's never said. How does the cat know to save the kid, or how does the kid know the cat is there to save her, or...? Well, I'm getting ahead of myself in a major way, so I'll just stop here for the time being.The first tale is called Quitters, Inc., and is about a smoker about to go through sheer hell. Stopping nicotine addiction is hard enough, but Richard Morris seeks help through an organization called,  yep, Quitters Inc. Unfortunately the man who runs the organization is a bit too serious, using torturous tactics to ensure the smoker stays a quitter. After Richard has enrolled in the program, he is told of the 'rules.' The head of the company is affiliated with the mafia and goes completely wacko on a pack of cigarettes. It's apparent this guy needs more than nicotine in his veins to get his head set straight. He informs Mr. Morris that he will be followed every way possible, and that if he sneaks a smoke, they'll know. The consequences for lighting up are dire - wives sent to the 'electric shock room', wives getting a finger cut off, and ultimately death. James Woods stand out as the best here, he's an amazing actor and his character fits this oh so well. This short story is bar none the best of the lot. Music such as ""Every breath you take"" kicks up the deal, it's all very laughable yet incredibly dark and twisted - perfect! The cat is used as an example of something horrid to happen if the smoker starts smoking again, but escapes at the last minute to confront the next situation.The second story, The Ledge, is about an aging tennis player who has made the mistake of having an affair with a powerful gambling addict. Knowing about the affair, the gambler gives Johnny an ultimatum. If he doesn't follow through with the 'test', he'll be sent to prison for planted drugs in his car, or else killed.  He has to walk around the outside ledge of a 30th floor apartment building. If he doesn't fall to his death, he walks away with the wife and a substantial amount of cash. Of course the sadistic gambler has no intention of letting Johnny win, as he sets up as many obstacles as possible for the poor soul. Let's just say you'll never see pigeons as friendly birds again. The acting is only subpar, and that hurts it slightly. The ending is great, wrapping up yet another entertaining installment. Here the cat has been brought home by the gambler and given the night to stay there. (Of course, prior to this he bets 2000 the cat will be hit when crossing the road)The last story, The General, is about the cat, who has somehow witnessed all these bizarre instances on his way to save the girl. He is adopted by the small child, Amanda, and attempts to save her from the evil troll monster that comes out of her wall to eat her. The effects of the troll itself were dismal and cheap, further showing the date of the film, but that doesn't matter as it's still fun. This short story made the least sense, and it had less going for it. For one thing, the mother of Amanda, played by Candy Clark, is a complete bitch and got on my nerves. This tale was also the least interesting. Still, it's not bad and has a cute Drew Barrymore when her acting skills were at their best.The cat deal is never fully explained in the anthology, which is a shame. Apparently a prologue was filmed to explain the reasoning to the audience, but studios deemed it too over the top so it was cut. One of the main problems I've seen expressed about the film is how ludicrous the cat is connected to all, but....well, who the hell cares??King of course put some nods to his own work in here. The cat runs into a St. Bernard that is the spitting image of Cujo. Actually, it is the same dog that plays the rabid mutt. He also runs into a car, 'Christine'. During Quitters, Inc, the Dead Zone is on TV. In The General, the PMSing mother is reading Pet Cemetery in bed.Overall this is an amazingly fun, cheesy, dark anthology that fits King's stories. Each one of them induces laughter and chuckles, but also are foreshadowed with a truly slick evil overtone. One of the best anthologies around, if not THE best, this is one that can't be missed.",4,Fun!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4989,"['like', 'think', 'anthologies', 'short', 'tales', 'similar', 'told', 'campfire', 'late', 'night', 'woods', 'darkness', 'everywhere', 'trees', 'swaying', 'people', 'huddled', 'close', 'bright', 'sparking', 'fire', 'One', 'person', 'will', 'begin', 'telling', 'tale', 'something', 'urban', 'legend', 'perhaps', 'made', 'up', 'story', 'frighten', 'other', 'listeners', 'scooting', 'much', 'closer', 'other', 'may', 'try', 'laugh', 'off', 'willies', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'ones', 'jump', 'abrupt', 'sound', 'owl', 'hooting', 'twig', 'snapping', 'frog', 'croaking', 'Here', 'have', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'one', 'older', 'better', 'most', 'penned', 'King', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'grand.The', 'central', 'theme', 'cat', 'trying', 'get', 'little', 'girl', 'rescue', 'strange', 'troll', 'beast', 'thingie', 'Why', 'Well..it', 'never', 'said', 'How', 'cat', 'know', 'save', 'kid', 'how', 'kid', 'know', 'cat', 'there', 'save', 'Well', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'major', 'way', ""'ll"", 'just', 'stop', 'here', 'time', 'being.The', 'first', 'tale', 'called', 'Quitters', 'Inc.', 'smoker', 'go', 'sheer', 'hell', 'Stopping', 'nicotine', 'addiction', 'hard', 'enough', 'Richard', 'Morris', 'help', 'organization', 'called', 'yep', 'Quitters', 'Inc', 'Unfortunately', 'man', 'who', 'organization', 'bit', 'too', 'serious', 'using', 'torturous', 'tactics', 'ensure', 'smoker', 'quitter', 'Richard', 'enrolled', 'program', 'told', ""'rules"", 'head', 'company', 'affiliated', 'mafia', 'completely', 'wacko', 'pack', 'cigarettes', 'apparent', 'guy', 'more', 'nicotine', 'veins', 'get', 'head', 'set', 'straight', 'Mr.', 'Morris', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'way', 'possible', 'smoke', ""'ll"", 'know', 'consequences', 'lighting', 'up', 'are', 'dire', 'wives', 'sent', ""'electric"", 'shock', 'room', 'getting', 'finger', 'cut', 'ultimately', 'death', 'James', 'Woods', 'stand', 'out', 'best', 'here', 'amazing', 'actor', 'character', 'oh', 'so', 'well', 'short', 'story', 'bar', 'none', 'best', 'lot', 'Music', 'such', 'Every', 'breath', 'take', 'up', 'deal', 'very', 'laughable', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'dark', 'twisted', 'perfect', 'cat', 'used', 'example', 'something', 'horrid', 'happen', 'smoker', 'smoking', 'again', 'last', 'minute', 'confront', 'next', 'situation.The', 'second', 'story', 'Ledge', 'aging', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'having', 'affair', 'powerful', 'gambling', 'addict', 'Knowing', 'affair', 'gambler', 'Johnny', 'ultimatum', ""n't"", 'follow', ""'test"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'planted', 'drugs', 'car', 'else', 'killed', 'walk', 'outside', 'ledge', '30th', 'floor', 'apartment', 'building', ""n't"", 'fall', 'death', 'away', 'wife', 'substantial', 'amount', 'cash', 'course', 'sadistic', 'gambler', 'intention', 'letting', 'Johnny', 'win', 'up', 'as', 'many', 'obstacles', 'possible', 'poor', 'soul', 'Let', 'just', 'say', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'pigeons', 'friendly', 'birds', 'again', 'acting', 'only', 'subpar', 'slightly', 'ending', 'great', 'wrapping', 'up', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'installment', 'Here', 'cat', 'been', 'brought', 'home', 'gambler', 'given', 'night', 'stay', 'there', 'course', 'prior', '2000', 'cat', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'when', 'crossing', 'road', 'last', 'story', 'General', 'cat', 'who', 'somehow', 'witnessed', 'bizarre', 'instances', 'way', 'save', 'girl', 'adopted', 'small', 'child', 'Amanda', 'attempts', 'save', 'evil', 'troll', 'monster', 'wall', 'eat', 'effects', 'troll', 'were', 'dismal', 'cheap', 'further', 'showing', 'date', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'still', 'fun', 'short', 'story', 'made', 'least', 'sense', 'had', 'less', 'going', 'one', 'thing', 'mother', 'Amanda', 'played', 'Candy', 'Clark', 'complete', 'bitch', 'got', 'nerves', 'tale', 'was', 'also', 'least', 'interesting', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'cute', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'when', 'acting', 'skills', 'were', 'best.The', 'cat', 'deal', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'anthology', 'shame', 'Apparently', 'prologue', 'was', 'filmed', 'explain', 'reasoning', 'audience', 'studios', 'deemed', 'too', 'top', 'was', 'cut', 'One', 'main', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'expressed', 'film', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'cat', 'connected', '.well', 'who', 'hell', 'cares', 'King', 'course', 'put', 'nods', 'own', 'work', 'here', 'cat', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'spitting', 'image', 'Cujo', 'Actually', 'same', 'dog', 'rabid', 'mutt', 'also', 'car', 'Quitters', 'Inc', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'TV', 'General', 'PMSing', 'mother', 'reading', 'Pet', 'Cemetery', 'bed.Overall', 'amazingly', 'fun', 'cheesy', 'dark', 'anthology', 'King', 'stories', 'one', 'induces', 'laughter', 'chuckles', 'also', 'are', 'foreshadowed', 'truly', 'slick', 'evil', 'overtone', 'One', 'best', 'anthologies', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",Cat's Eye VHS
