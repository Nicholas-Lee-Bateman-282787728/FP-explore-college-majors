1251367,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B0026A311M,albarino,"[2, 2]","I saw this documentary on my PBS station in Sept, 2013.As the film unfolded, I dropped everything I was doing and was horrified by the momentum that was built against the multiple - and innocent - defendants based first upon hearsay and then the manipulation of young children by the Kern County (CA) DA's office in the 1980s.As they say, context is everything. Kern County, at the bottom of the Central Valley, is a very conservative region with a white populace that feels ""under siege"" by a growing Latino population. It predictably votes for right wing Republicans. It is an area where the power base is relatively under educated, prone to authoritarianism and fearful. This was the backdrop for the wrongful, ultimately baseless prosecution of numerous individuals based upon coaxed and manipulated accounts from young children - ""victims"" - of wildly imagined sexual orgies, supposed sexual exploitation and abuses involving these young children. The societal premise was the assumption that ""children don't lie."" So children are immune from the human condition??  In ""Witch Hunt,"" however, we learn that children, when pressured by adults in authority, can be urged to tell these adults what they want to hear.One of the most disgraceful characters in ""Witch Hunt"" is Ed Jagels, an uber law-und-ordnung right wing prosecutor who, upon his election as Kern Co. DA in the 1980s,  wreaked havoc in California's criminal justice system in the age of Reagan. Relying on suggestive and unreliable police and social worker interrogations of children, Jagels' office put 26 people behind bars on felony child sex abuse charges in the 1980s and `90s. Of those 26 convictions, 25 have since been overturned. Further, California had to pay more than $10 million dollars in damages for Jagels' judicial fanaticism. He left office in 2010 - disgraced.""Witch Hunt""  is one of the most powerful documentaries about the miscarriage of justice, both in California and the US. Most outrageous of all, the Kern Co. DA, Jagels, was still in office at the time this film was made - re-elected 7 times. He denied co-operation in this film and decided not to stand for election after its release.",5,when hysteria overrules the truth,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2180,"['saw', 'documentary', 'PBS', 'station', 'Sept', '2013.As', 'film', 'unfolded', 'dropped', 'everything', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'horrified', 'momentum', 'was', 'built', 'multiple', 'innocent', 'defendants', 'based', 'first', 'hearsay', 'then', 'manipulation', 'young', 'children', 'Kern', 'County', 'CA', 'DA', 'office', '1980s.As', 'say', 'context', 'everything', 'Kern', 'County', 'bottom', 'Central', 'Valley', 'very', 'conservative', 'region', 'white', 'populace', 'siege', 'growing', 'Latino', 'population', 'predictably', 'right', 'wing', 'Republicans', 'area', 'where', 'power', 'base', 'relatively', 'educated', 'prone', 'authoritarianism', 'fearful', 'was', 'backdrop', 'wrongful', 'ultimately', 'baseless', 'prosecution', 'numerous', 'individuals', 'based', 'coaxed', 'manipulated', 'accounts', 'young', 'children', 'victims', 'wildly', 'imagined', 'sexual', 'orgies', 'supposed', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'involving', 'young', 'children', 'societal', 'premise', 'was', 'assumption', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'children', 'are', 'immune', 'human', 'condition', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'however', 'learn', 'children', 'when', 'pressured', 'adults', 'authority', 'can', 'be', 'urged', 'tell', 'adults', 'what', 'want', 'hear.One', 'most', 'disgraceful', 'characters', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'Ed', 'Jagels', 'uber', 'law-und-ordnung', 'right', 'wing', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'election', 'Kern', 'Co.', 'DA', '1980s', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'California', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'age', 'Reagan', 'Relying', 'suggestive', 'unreliable', 'police', 'social', 'worker', 'interrogations', 'children', 'Jagels', 'office', 'put', '26', 'people', 'bars', 'felony', 'child', 'sex', 'abuse', 'charges', '1980s', '90s', '26', 'convictions', '25', 'have', 'been', 'overturned', 'Further', 'California', 'had', 'pay', 'more', '10', 'million', 'dollars', 'damages', 'Jagels', 'judicial', 'fanaticism', 'left', 'office', '2010', 'disgraced', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'documentaries', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'California', 'US', 'Most', 'outrageous', 'Kern', 'Co.', 'DA', 'Jagels', 'was', 'still', 'office', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 're-elected', '7', 'times', 'denied', 'co-operation', 'film', 'decided', 'not', 'stand', 'election', 'release']",Witch Hunt DVD

Sean Penn narrates the story of a group of people who were accused of molesting their own children through the overzealous efforts of the local authorities, a judge who had made up his mind before the trial ever began, and children who were bullied into lying. The heroes of the story are the people of the Northern California Innocence Project. The victims were the parents who spent from 6 to 20 years in prison and their children, suffering from guilt feelings for having told the lies the social workers told them to say, from having to live without their parents in a variety of foster care situations because they went along with the bullies.The basic technique was to ask the kid a question, and just keep at them until you got the answer you wanted. As the kids grew up, they were horrified to realize the consequences of their having gone along with it.The final irony is that the officials responsible for this miscarriage of justice have gone along in their political careers and have never been charged with anything.",4,The Legal System Runs Amok,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1133,"['Kern', 'County', 'California', 'Bakersfield', 'be', 'exact', 'town', 'middle', 'factory', 'farms', 'oil', 'wells', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'accused', 'molesting', 'own', 'children', 'overzealous', 'efforts', 'local', 'authorities', 'judge', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'trial', 'ever', 'began', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'bullied', 'lying', 'heroes', 'story', 'are', 'people', 'Northern', 'California', 'Innocence', 'Project', 'victims', 'were', 'parents', 'who', 'spent', '6', '20', 'years', 'prison', 'children', 'suffering', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'having', 'told', 'lies', 'social', 'workers', 'told', 'say', 'having', 'live', 'parents', 'variety', 'foster', 'care', 'situations', 'went', 'bullies.The', 'basic', 'technique', 'was', 'ask', 'kid', 'question', 'just', 'keep', 'got', 'answer', 'wanted', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'were', 'horrified', 'realize', 'consequences', 'having', 'gone', 'it.The', 'final', 'irony', 'officials', 'responsible', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'have', 'gone', 'along', 'political', 'careers', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'charged', 'anything']",Witch Hunt DVD

1251370,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B0026A311M,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[5, 7]",The title WITCH HUNT is somewhat misleading for this documentary since it conjures up images of the infamous McMartin case involving a Day Care center where the owners and workers were accused not only of molestation but also of satanic rituals and human and animal sacrfices. Although such things are mentioned in passing in this film they have no relevance to any of the cases represented and if you're looking for coverage of that you'd best look elsewhere. The film does offer up a truly terrifying example of what can happen when the public panics and allows the police and the judical system to run roughshod over the individuals rights to a fair trial in the name of protecting innocent children.,4,A Cautionary Tale,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,703,"['title', 'WITCH', 'HUNT', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'documentary', 'up', 'images', 'infamous', 'McMartin', 'case', 'involving', 'Day', 'Care', 'center', 'where', 'owners', 'workers', 'were', 'accused', 'not', 'only', 'molestation', 'also', 'satanic', 'rituals', 'human', 'animal', 'sacrfices', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'film', 'have', 'relevance', 'cases', 'represented', ""'re"", 'looking', 'coverage', ""'d"", 'best', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'offer', 'up', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'public', 'panics', 'police', 'judical', 'system', 'run', 'roughshod', 'individuals', 'rights', 'fair', 'trial', 'name', 'protecting', 'innocent', 'children']",Witch Hunt DVD
1251371,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0026A311M,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","Witch Hunt is a disturbing yet well done documentary about a dramatic surge in child molestation cases in Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The accusations and court hearings began in the early 1980s after Ed Jagels, a new tough on crime DA was elected. It's amazing; the story is just so stunning because it was so obvious that there couldn't have suddenly been huge numbers of people all abusing their own children and their neighbors' children. The film moves along at a very good pace, telling the story with compelling interviews with the children, now adults, who testified against their own parents and neighbors as well as interviews with some of the men and women falsely accused of child molestation. The cinematography works well; and the narration by Sean Penn is terrific.Because of inept, poorly trained social workers and law enforcement, children were harassed, coerced and downright bullied into changing honest stories that nothing happened to fabricated tales the officials and counselors wanted them to say--that they were molested and even routinely molested! Fine upstanding citizens who had never had any trouble with the law were arrested, thrown into jail and had to await what became sometimes seemingly endless court hearings and trials until, of course, they were found guilty and usually sentenced to literally hundreds of years behind bars. Children of these good people were put into foster homes and paid a huge price in that they rarely if ever saw their parents. As you can imagine, practically all of the children have guilt issues to this day.There is more to the story that just this; and I'm not going to write much more to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say that we see how quite a few of these tragic stories played out and that is essentially the focus of the remainder of the film.Look for insightful though painful interviews with a few of the adults unfairly imprisoned; just four of them are Jeffrey Modahl, John Stoll, Brenda Kniffen and Scott Kniffen. John Van de Kamp, a former California Attorney General, weighs in with his thoughts on the matter and legal issues involved; and Kathleen Ridolfi of The Northern California Innocence Project is very well spoken indeed. There is even more fascinating interview time with Carla Modahl, now a young adult, who was essentially forced to testify against her own father Jeffrey all those years ago.The DVD comes with a few extras and they're all quite good. I particularly liked the extra interview with John Stoll; the ""Q & A"" session from The Toronto Film Festival and the update from The Northern California Innocence Project.Witch Hunt is a must for anyone even remotely involved with law enforcement so that unjust convictions can stop; people who like crime documentaries with social and cultural themes will not be disappointed.",5,"""SOME CONVICTIONS ARE CRIMINAL""",1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2831,"['Witch', 'Hunt', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'dramatic', 'surge', 'child', 'molestation', 'cases', 'Bakersfield', 'Kern', 'County', 'California', 'accusations', 'court', 'hearings', 'began', 'early', '1980s', 'Ed', 'Jagels', 'new', 'tough', 'crime', 'DA', 'was', 'elected', 'amazing', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'stunning', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'suddenly', 'been', 'huge', 'numbers', 'people', 'abusing', 'own', 'children', 'neighbors', 'children', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'telling', 'story', 'compelling', 'interviews', 'children', 'now', 'adults', 'who', 'testified', 'own', 'parents', 'neighbors', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'men', 'women', 'falsely', 'accused', 'child', 'molestation', 'cinematography', 'well', 'narration', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'terrific.Because', 'inept', 'poorly', 'trained', 'social', 'workers', 'law', 'enforcement', 'children', 'were', 'harassed', 'coerced', 'downright', 'bullied', 'changing', 'honest', 'stories', 'nothing', 'happened', 'fabricated', 'tales', 'officials', 'counselors', 'wanted', 'say', 'were', 'molested', 'even', 'routinely', 'molested', 'Fine', 'upstanding', 'citizens', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'trouble', 'law', 'were', 'arrested', 'thrown', 'jail', 'had', 'await', 'what', 'became', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'court', 'hearings', 'trials', 'course', 'were', 'found', 'guilty', 'usually', 'sentenced', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'years', 'bars', 'Children', 'good', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'foster', 'homes', 'paid', 'huge', 'price', 'rarely', 'ever', 'saw', 'parents', 'can', 'imagine', 'practically', 'children', 'have', 'guilt', 'issues', 'day.There', 'more', 'story', 'just', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'write', 'much', 'more', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'Suffice', 'say', 'see', 'how', 'quite', 'few', 'tragic', 'stories', 'played', 'out', 'essentially', 'focus', 'remainder', 'film.Look', 'insightful', 'painful', 'interviews', 'few', 'adults', 'unfairly', 'imprisoned', 'just', 'four', 'are', 'Jeffrey', 'Modahl', 'John', 'Stoll', 'Brenda', 'Kniffen', 'Scott', 'Kniffen', 'John', 'Van', 'de', 'Kamp', 'former', 'California', 'Attorney', 'General', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'legal', 'issues', 'involved', 'Kathleen', 'Ridolfi', 'Northern', 'California', 'Innocence', 'Project', 'very', 'well', 'spoken', 'indeed', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'interview', 'time', 'Carla', 'Modahl', 'now', 'young', 'adult', 'who', 'was', 'essentially', 'forced', 'testify', 'own', 'father', 'Jeffrey', 'years', 'ago.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', ""'re"", 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'liked', 'extra', 'interview', 'John', 'Stoll', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', 'update', 'Northern', 'California', 'Innocence', 'Project.Witch', 'Hunt', 'must', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'involved', 'law', 'enforcement', 'unjust', 'convictions', 'can', 'stop', 'people', 'who', 'crime', 'documentaries', 'social', 'cultural', 'themes', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Witch Hunt DVD
