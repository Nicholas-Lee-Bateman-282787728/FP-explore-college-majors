Being a good auntie ordered them for my niece - sat down the other night and watched them with her. All four movies come stacked on top of each other - no scratches and they were all in good shape.

The disappointment is with the way they are packaged. Every DVD is stacked one on top of the other. We provided a case for each at home, but the damage was already done.
