Now a man in his twenties he has just completed an arduous three year meditation in total isolation, thus winning for himself the admiration of the Tibetan community. However something has changed within the young monk since his return from his solitary retreat. He now finds himself filled with the desires of the flesh, repeatedly awakening in the morning with soiled robes, a sure sign of the sensual nature of his dreams during the night.Lashi realizes that he cannot renounce those pleasures in life that he has never had the chance to experience. He leaves the monastery and travels to a nearby village, the home of Pema (Christy Chung) a young woman with whom he had a recent and brief encounter. He falls in love, marries and their union is blessed with a son they name Karma. Unfortunately, with the passing years Lashi still finds himself unfulfilled and further from enlightenment than ever.What is the truest path? To seek earthly fulfillment or to renounce the world and look within? The unanswerable question comes to a most unexpected conclusion.I love this movie! Filmed in the Himalayas, the cinematography alone makes the movie worth watching. The production values are extaordinary and the cast is superb. Shawn Ku is amazing as the monk who can't make up his mind and Christy Chung may even be better as the wife and mother who tries to hold it all together.",5,"""Satisfying One Thousand Desires""",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1482,"['Note', 'Tibetan', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Lashi', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'lived', 'monastery', 'age', 'five', 'Now', 'man', 'twenties', 'just', 'completed', 'arduous', 'three', 'year', 'meditation', 'total', 'isolation', 'thus', 'winning', 'admiration', 'Tibetan', 'community', 'However', 'something', 'changed', 'young', 'monk', 'return', 'solitary', 'retreat', 'now', 'filled', 'desires', 'flesh', 'repeatedly', 'awakening', 'morning', 'soiled', 'robes', 'sure', 'sign', 'sensual', 'nature', 'dreams', 'night.Lashi', 'can', 'not', 'renounce', 'pleasures', 'life', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'experience', 'monastery', 'travels', 'nearby', 'village', 'home', 'Pema', 'Christy', 'Chung', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'had', 'recent', 'brief', 'encounter', 'love', 'marries', 'union', 'blessed', 'son', 'name', 'Karma', 'Unfortunately', 'passing', 'years', 'Lashi', 'still', 'unfulfilled', 'further', 'enlightenment', 'ever.What', 'truest', 'path', 'seek', 'earthly', 'fulfillment', 'renounce', 'world', 'look', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'most', 'unexpected', 'conclusion.I', 'love', 'movie', 'Filmed', 'Himalayas', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'movie', 'watching', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'extaordinary', 'cast', 'superb', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'amazing', 'monk', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Christy', 'Chung', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'better', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'hold', 'together']",Samsara
898057,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B00081IM2Y,Daiho,"[25, 27]","The debut feature from Indian director Pan Nalin, Samsara is a lovely, understated meditation on desire as seen through the life of Tashi, a Buddhist monk who leaves his order to explore the world outside the monastery.The story opens with a dirt-smeared, matted-haired monk being carried out of a cave at the end of a three-year mediation retreat and afterwards being rewarded the rank of kenpo. Despite his elevation of the rank of teacher, Tashi remains afflicted by dreams of the erotic, dreams that cause him to question his vows, vows that he has kept since entering the monastery as a child of five. He wonders how the rest of the world lives, how the Buddha himself once lived before giving up his princely life to search for enlightenment. Sometimes, Tashi reasons, we must own something in order to renounce it.Driven by an encounter with a beautiful village girl, he leaves the monastery to find her, figuratively and literally crossing a river, leaving his monk's robes on the bank and entering completely and wholly the world of samsara, our ordinary, work-a-day world known to the Buddhists as the realm of illusion, desire, hatred, and suffering.There Tashi finds Pema, the village girl of his dreams, and a life of happiness and fulfillment as a husband, father, and farmer. In this life he encounters also much suffering in jealousy, deceit, anger, rage, physical violence, and most deeply in his own sexual desire, which leads to betrayal, infidelity and loss of self-esteem.Unlike in many films in which these subjects would be weighted down with cloying dialog, director Nalin Pan cuts talk to a minimum, communicating with the viewer through the actors' expressions, the movement of camera, and through Cyril Mornin's music (as performed by Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra). With a handsome cast and the stunning vistas of the Himalayan foothills of Ladakh, India to fill out the camera, Samsara is a beautiful film for the eye and ear.It also offers something for the mind, including an ambiguous ending that will leave you wondering which road Tashi chooses. Just as he is to head over the bridge leading to his monastery, where he has decided to return after his infidelity, he comes across his wife Pema, who ends the film with a series of penetrating questions on the relationship between the sexes and the role of women in Buddhism.The question of Tashi's final direction is in the end put to the viewer - what are your desires? Where do they lead you? How can you make a meaningful life?#",5,"Delicate, evocative exploration of desire",1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,2513,"['debut', 'feature', 'Indian', 'director', 'Pan', 'Nalin', 'Samsara', 'lovely', 'understated', 'meditation', 'desire', 'seen', 'life', 'Tashi', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'who', 'order', 'explore', 'world', 'monastery.The', 'story', 'dirt-smeared', 'matted-haired', 'monk', 'being', 'carried', 'cave', 'end', 'three-year', 'mediation', 'retreat', 'afterwards', 'being', 'rewarded', 'rank', 'kenpo', 'elevation', 'rank', 'teacher', 'Tashi', 'afflicted', 'dreams', 'erotic', 'cause', 'question', 'vows', 'vows', 'kept', 'entering', 'monastery', 'child', 'five', 'how', 'rest', 'world', 'how', 'Buddha', 'once', 'lived', 'giving', 'up', 'princely', 'life', 'search', 'enlightenment', 'Sometimes', 'Tashi', 'reasons', 'must', 'own', 'something', 'order', 'renounce', 'it.Driven', 'encounter', 'beautiful', 'village', 'girl', 'monastery', 'find', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'crossing', 'river', 'leaving', 'monk', 'robes', 'bank', 'entering', 'completely', 'wholly', 'world', 'samsara', 'ordinary', 'work-a-day', 'world', 'known', 'Buddhists', 'realm', 'illusion', 'desire', 'hatred', 'suffering.There', 'Tashi', 'Pema', 'village', 'girl', 'dreams', 'life', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'husband', 'father', 'farmer', 'life', 'also', 'much', 'suffering', 'jealousy', 'deceit', 'anger', 'rage', 'physical', 'violence', 'most', 'deeply', 'own', 'sexual', 'desire', 'betrayal', 'infidelity', 'loss', 'self-esteem.Unlike', 'many', 'films', 'subjects', 'would', 'be', 'weighted', 'down', 'cloying', 'dialog', 'director', 'Nalin', 'Pan', 'talk', 'minimum', 'communicating', 'viewer', 'actors', 'expressions', 'movement', 'camera', 'Cyril', 'Mornin', 'music', 'performed', 'Bulgarian', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'handsome', 'cast', 'stunning', 'vistas', 'Himalayan', 'foothills', 'Ladakh', 'India', 'fill', 'out', 'camera', 'Samsara', 'beautiful', 'film', 'eye', 'ear.It', 'also', 'something', 'mind', 'including', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'road', 'Tashi', 'Just', 'head', 'bridge', 'leading', 'monastery', 'where', 'decided', 'return', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'Pema', 'who', 'film', 'series', 'penetrating', 'questions', 'relationship', 'sexes', 'role', 'women', 'Buddhism.The', 'question', 'Tashi', 'final', 'direction', 'end', 'put', 'viewer', 'what', 'are', 'desires', 'Where', 'do', 'lead', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'meaningful', 'life']",Samsara

898059,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00081IM2Y,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[0, 0]","The main strength of this film is its setting, the spectacular landscape of northern India, and the beauty of its main cast---especially the female lead, played by Christie Chung.  The soundtrack is also beautiful, a perfect accompaniment and worth purchasing separately.However, I would hesitate to call this a &#34;masterpiece&#34; of any kind...more like, a stately but very enjoyable movie.It tries to explore the usual body vs mind, earthly vs spiritual, sensual vs aesthetic conflict through the main character of Tashi, a Tibetan Buddhist monk who's just emerged from 3 years of solitary meditation in a cave, is plagued by recurring wet dreams, then encounters a beautiful farmer's daughter he promptly falls for and decides to leave his monastery to pursue.  THEN his troubles truly begin, as he quickly accumulates what Kazantzakis famously called &#34;the full catastrophe&#34; of life: wife, offspring, job, property, etc.So this film is by turns predictable and, thank the gods, unpredictable...there were several plot points where I was sure I knew what was going to happen next, but actually did not...since the film was not made in Hollywood guided by focus groups and audience-pandering formulas.The unexpected plot turns are not wholly satisfying or all that credible, but do prevent this film from degenerating into true melodrama.  There are three sex scenes which are certainly pleasant but sort of clunky and clumsy, in addition to being culturally anachronistic (ahem! protracted, French-like tongue-kissing is very rare in Asia especially in the kind of geographically isolated location in which this story takes place).There are two somewhat interesting modern moments as well: a subtle &#34;vegan moment&#34; when a little boy challenges his parents' moral hypocrisy regarding killing whilst being meat eaters, and a feminist criticism of the traditional folklore-narrative around the Buddha's decision to leave his wife and child to go seek enlightenment.I was also relieved that this film had a nicely open-ended conclusion, which is in perfect keeping with the flavor and content of Buddhist philosophy, rather than trying to tie it up into a neat little feel-good ribbon-and-bow-and-uplifting-moral-message as Hollywood usually beats us over the head with.",4,"Visually stunning, but...",1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2286,"['main', 'strength', 'film', 'setting', 'spectacular', 'landscape', 'northern', 'India', 'beauty', 'main', 'cast', '-especially', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'Christie', 'Chung', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'separately.However', 'would', 'hesitate', 'call', '34', 'masterpiece', '34', 'kind', 'more', 'stately', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie.It', 'tries', 'explore', 'usual', 'body', 'vs', 'mind', 'earthly', 'vs', 'spiritual', 'sensual', 'vs', 'aesthetic', 'conflict', 'main', 'character', 'Tashi', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'who', 'just', 'emerged', '3', 'years', 'solitary', 'meditation', 'cave', 'plagued', 'recurring', 'wet', 'dreams', 'then', 'beautiful', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'promptly', 'decides', 'leave', 'monastery', 'pursue', 'THEN', 'troubles', 'truly', 'begin', 'quickly', 'what', 'Kazantzakis', 'famously', 'called', '34', 'full', 'catastrophe', '34', 'life', 'wife', 'offspring', 'job', 'property', 'etc.So', 'film', 'turns', 'predictable', 'thank', 'gods', 'unpredictable', 'were', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'where', 'was', 'sure', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'actually', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'guided', 'focus', 'groups', 'audience-pandering', 'formulas.The', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'turns', 'are', 'not', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'credible', 'do', 'prevent', 'film', 'degenerating', 'true', 'melodrama', 'are', 'three', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'certainly', 'pleasant', 'sort', 'clunky', 'clumsy', 'addition', 'being', 'culturally', 'anachronistic', 'ahem', 'protracted', 'French-like', 'tongue-kissing', 'very', 'rare', 'Asia', 'especially', 'kind', 'geographically', 'isolated', 'location', 'story', 'place', 'are', 'two', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'modern', 'moments', 'well', 'subtle', '34', 'vegan', 'moment', '34', 'when', 'little', 'boy', 'parents', 'moral', 'hypocrisy', 'regarding', 'killing', 'whilst', 'being', 'meat', 'eaters', 'feminist', 'criticism', 'traditional', 'folklore-narrative', 'Buddha', 'decision', 'leave', 'wife', 'child', 'go', 'seek', 'enlightenment.I', 'was', 'also', 'relieved', 'film', 'had', 'nicely', 'open-ended', 'conclusion', 'perfect', 'keeping', 'flavor', 'content', 'Buddhist', 'philosophy', 'rather', 'trying', 'tie', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'feel-good', 'ribbon-and-bow-and-uplifting-moral-message', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'head']",Samsara

His story begins with his return to the monastic life after three years in solitary meditation. Having won the admiration of his Buddhist community, he is faced with a new challenge: his sexual desires. But how can he renounce that which he has never had the chance to experience? Even Buddha, he implores his mentor, lived a full life before his enlightenment.But, despite marriage to the beautiful and strong Pema, superbly acted by the beautiful Christy Chung, Tashi remains unable to master his desires and, despite his successes in the material world, remains unfulfilled and victim to his sexuality.An elegant portrayal of one man's search for fulfilment, Samsara grips one with a subtle fist. Dialogue is sparse. Stillness pervades this movie; it flows with a gentle inevitability that reflects the ever-turning wheel of life itself, and yet the superb acting skills effectively communicate the depth of passions and the range of emotions that constantly drive humanity. There are some exquisite(and fairly explicit)love scenes, enhanced by a magical score. With the original Tibetan soundtrack and excellent English sub-titles, this colourful movie is a feast for the senses, and for the soul.Remove the towering backdrop of the magnificent Himalayas and exchange the coarsely woven clothes with jeans and sweatshirts, and Samsara would still tell a universal story of love and desire, and how they affect us all for good or ill.Ultimately, Tashi has to decide which is better: to satisfy one thousand desires, or conquer just one.

898061,A2A9BGJ6FFBBDT,B00081IM2Y,"Magalini Sabina ""sabina""","[10, 10]","Himalaya is a perfect set for every movie. The landscapes, the colours, probably due to the rarefied atmosphere, the costumes and the intriguing faces of these people are worth alone a whole film. Samsara is a European-Asian co-production that has come out in 2005, with a good success especially in Europe. It is the story of a monk, Lashi, that after recovering from a state of meditation that lasted three years, three months and three days, finds himself attracted/distracted by human (sexual) stimuli. He first attempts to put his instincts in a religious perspective, meditating on the similarity between sex and death, but then gives up and goes back or better goes into the world, since he had entered the monastery at five years of age. In the village closest to his monastery he is attracted to a beautiful young girl, Pema, that reciprocates his passion. Pema and Lashi get married and have a child and Lashi works with his father in law and fights against a tyrannical and dishonest grain intermediary, contesting long lasting traditions and habits of the village. He shows his bravery by going to town to sell on his own the wheat, defends his land from a fire, and also gets beaten up by the intermediaries guards. Life goes on and Lashi finds himself attracted by a beutiful and saucy Indian girl and has an intercourse with her. This experience deeply disturbs him and makes him reflect on the sense of desire. He is again attracted by monastic life and prepares himself to give up his family life. He identifies himself with Siddharta and finds no guilt in leaving his wife and son. But at this point the story comes to its climax, because the gentle, patient, witty, intelligent Pema rebels and shows all her rage at being abandoned.The films message is in its way revolutionary, the traditional buddhist way of life is questioned and contested. A woman discusses the belief that personal salvation and personal well being are the ultimate goal of the existence. Pema doesn't say it the way an occidental woman would but she clearly states that a family is a responsibility and there is a price to pay for sexual satisfaction, a family life and children.I found this movie very interesting because in a rural society, with ancient ways and in the complete respect of tradition a woman makes herself heard. This is not a feminist work, far from it, but it is modern and true and very up to date because in many circumstances it is evident that personal satisfaction seems to be the only driving force in many kinds of society. Also the return towards religiosity that we are assisting to must not be at the price of family and child neglect.The contrast between the ways of life and the moral of the story is striking and genial.The picture is a little slow going in the first part, but the simple observation of the the costumes and colors is of the greatest satisfaction. The story differently from ""Himalaya"" is not out of time, because we see the town, the cars, the multiethnic society (the Indian girl, the Chinese intermediary)and this helps to contextualize. The country we see is Laddak which is probably the closest remaining to a pre-Chinese Himalayan society.Backround music, especially the woman chants, are fantastic and give an added value to the picture.The actors are perfect and the inexpressive face of Lashi really explains us his character. Pema is beautiful and very convincing from her first moments of passion to the battling conclusion.I highly recommend this movie to all ""himalayanophilies"" like me but also to anyone interested in a beautiful and deep reflection on ""self"" and family.",5,Modern problems in an ancient country,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,3629,"['Himalaya', 'perfect', 'set', 'movie', 'landscapes', 'colours', 'probably', 'due', 'rarefied', 'atmosphere', 'costumes', 'intriguing', 'people', 'are', 'worth', 'alone', 'whole', 'film', 'Samsara', 'European-Asian', 'co-production', 'come', 'out', '2005', 'good', 'success', 'especially', 'Europe', 'story', 'monk', 'Lashi', 'recovering', 'state', 'meditation', 'lasted', 'three', 'years', 'three', 'months', 'three', 'days', 'attracted/distracted', 'human', 'sexual', 'stimuli', 'first', 'put', 'instincts', 'religious', 'perspective', 'meditating', 'similarity', 'sex', 'death', 'then', 'up', 'back', 'better', 'world', 'had', 'entered', 'monastery', 'five', 'years', 'age', 'village', 'closest', 'monastery', 'attracted', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'Pema', 'passion', 'Pema', 'Lashi', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'child', 'Lashi', 'father', 'law', 'fights', 'tyrannical', 'dishonest', 'grain', 'intermediary', 'contesting', 'long', 'lasting', 'traditions', 'habits', 'village', 'bravery', 'going', 'town', 'sell', 'own', 'wheat', 'land', 'fire', 'also', 'beaten', 'up', 'intermediaries', 'guards', 'Life', 'Lashi', 'attracted', 'beutiful', 'saucy', 'Indian', 'girl', 'intercourse', 'experience', 'deeply', 'reflect', 'sense', 'desire', 'again', 'attracted', 'monastic', 'life', 'give', 'up', 'family', 'life', 'Siddharta', 'guilt', 'leaving', 'wife', 'son', 'point', 'story', 'climax', 'gentle', 'patient', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'Pema', 'rebels', 'rage', 'being', 'abandoned.The', 'films', 'message', 'way', 'revolutionary', 'traditional', 'buddhist', 'way', 'life', 'questioned', 'contested', 'woman', 'belief', 'personal', 'salvation', 'personal', 'well', 'being', 'are', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'existence', 'Pema', ""n't"", 'say', 'way', 'occidental', 'woman', 'would', 'clearly', 'family', 'responsibility', 'price', 'pay', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'family', 'life', 'children.I', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'rural', 'society', 'ancient', 'ways', 'complete', 'respect', 'tradition', 'woman', 'heard', 'not', 'feminist', 'work', 'far', 'modern', 'true', 'very', 'up', 'date', 'many', 'circumstances', 'evident', 'personal', 'satisfaction', 'be', 'only', 'driving', 'force', 'many', 'kinds', 'society', 'Also', 'return', 'towards', 'religiosity', 'are', 'assisting', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'price', 'family', 'child', 'neglect.The', 'contrast', 'ways', 'life', 'moral', 'story', 'striking', 'genial.The', 'picture', 'little', 'slow', 'going', 'first', 'part', 'simple', 'observation', 'costumes', 'colors', 'greatest', 'satisfaction', 'story', 'differently', 'Himalaya', 'not', 'time', 'see', 'town', 'cars', 'multiethnic', 'society', 'Indian', 'girl', 'Chinese', 'intermediary', 'contextualize', 'country', 'see', 'Laddak', 'probably', 'closest', 'remaining', 'pre-Chinese', 'Himalayan', 'society.Backround', 'music', 'especially', 'woman', 'chants', 'are', 'fantastic', 'give', 'added', 'value', 'picture.The', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'inexpressive', 'face', 'Lashi', 'really', 'character', 'Pema', 'beautiful', 'very', 'convincing', 'first', 'moments', 'passion', 'battling', 'conclusion.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'himalayanophilies', 'also', 'anyone', 'interested', 'beautiful', 'deep', 'reflection', 'self', 'family']",Samsara

It is a dilemma that knows no obvious or final solution.I admit I was also struck by the intense eroticism of several scenes, which in my view is entirely appropriate for a movie about Buddhism, a philosophy that does not condemn the pleasures of sex. It is also particularly appropriate for a movie shot in India, where Buddhism and Hinduism (the religion that produced Kama Sutra) have interacted for centuries.The final part of the movie is also telling: the protagonist's wife, Pema, invokes Yashodhara, Buddha's wife. While the world has identified with Buddha's plight and dilemma for millennia, no one ever seems to care about her, who in the end pays the heaviest price for the choices of her husband.Acting is good, and Christy Chung lives up to expectations.

To see her go from mediocre Cantonese years ago to delivering all her lines in Thai in Jan Dara, and now learning Tibetan for the lead role in Samsara, she deserved the applause! Although her filmography includes mostly plain ornamental girlfriend or bombshell roles, until she surprised audiences worldwide with a refreshing and sexually daring role in Jan Dara a few years ago, and now playing an unconditionally loving wife of an ex-monk in this religious and spiritual film ultimately allowed her to prove that she's no longer just a beauty queen.Christy Chung is actually makeup free in this movie, and she's reminecent of some of the images portrayed by Gong Li in some of Zhang Yimou's movies. She's a village woman in Tibet, and everything is extremely different from big city lifestyle. The mood of this film is rather similar to The Fast Runner. Shawn Ku played a monk who had accomplished a great deal of wisedom as a Buddist. One day his sexual temptation took over his serenity and decided to leave the temple to become a normal person and experience life's happiness and fullfill his desires since he had been  a monk as a child. He met Christy and they got married eventually, and raised a family together. Just when he thought having a lovely wife and kids would be all he ever wanted, along came a beautiful and seductive Indian girl whom he couldn't resist to have an affair with. By now he realized that his true passion is not the life he was living, and he has to face the decision of a lifetime.....Christy and Shawn Ku had some sexy scenes together, and I thought their final confrontation was a test of their acting ability, and it was very impressive to see Christy delivering long lines in tears. I think it's so great that she was willing to abandon those big budget movies for a small film like this that has good meaning and challenges her range.",4,Perhaps Christy Chung's most challenging work!,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2337,"['Christy', 'Chung', 'probably', 'most', 'multlingual', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'working', 'Asia', 'mostly', 'Hong', 'Kong', ""'90s"", 'very', 'impressive', 'Canadian', 'Vietnamese', 'started', 'possibly', 'fluent', 'English', 'French', 'Vietnamese', 'winning', 'Miss', 'Chinatown', 'Montreal', 'decade', 'ago', 'managed', 'become', 'Chinese', 'actress', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'now', 'more', 'languages', 'other', 'multicultual', 'actresses', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'see', 'go', 'mediocre', 'Cantonese', 'years', 'ago', 'delivering', 'lines', 'Thai', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'now', 'learning', 'Tibetan', 'lead', 'role', 'Samsara', 'deserved', 'applause', 'filmography', 'mostly', 'plain', 'ornamental', 'girlfriend', 'bombshell', 'roles', 'surprised', 'audiences', 'worldwide', 'refreshing', 'sexually', 'daring', 'role', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'playing', 'unconditionally', 'loving', 'wife', 'ex-monk', 'religious', 'spiritual', 'film', 'ultimately', 'allowed', 'prove', 'longer', 'just', 'beauty', 'queen.Christy', 'Chung', 'actually', 'makeup', 'free', 'movie', 'reminecent', 'images', 'portrayed', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'movies', 'village', 'woman', 'Tibet', 'everything', 'extremely', 'different', 'big', 'city', 'lifestyle', 'mood', 'film', 'rather', 'similar', 'Fast', 'Runner', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'played', 'monk', 'who', 'had', 'accomplished', 'great', 'deal', 'wisedom', 'Buddist', 'One', 'day', 'sexual', 'temptation', 'took', 'over', 'serenity', 'decided', 'leave', 'temple', 'become', 'normal', 'person', 'experience', 'life', 'happiness', 'fullfill', 'desires', 'had', 'been', 'monk', 'child', 'met', 'Christy', 'got', 'married', 'eventually', 'raised', 'family', 'together', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'having', 'lovely', 'wife', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'ever', 'wanted', 'came', 'beautiful', 'seductive', 'Indian', 'girl', 'whom', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'have', 'affair', 'now', 'realized', 'true', 'passion', 'not', 'life', 'was', 'living', 'face', 'decision', 'lifetime', '..Christy', 'Shawn', 'Ku', 'had', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'together', 'thought', 'final', 'confrontation', 'was', 'test', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'see', 'Christy', 'delivering', 'long', 'lines', 'tears', 'think', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'willing', 'abandon', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'small', 'film', 'good', 'meaning', 'range']",Samsara
