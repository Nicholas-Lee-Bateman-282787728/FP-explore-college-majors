It's an hour-long stand-up show in a New York theater, and the bonus materials include another 20 minutes or so of him fielding questions from the audience, mostly with a serious bent. As most of you know, much of Bill's humor is political, and so in 2003 it was about Iraq, George Bush, and related overtly political issues. There are also discussions of feminism, relations between men and women (""Explore our mutual fantasies? Folks, there's no such thing."") He's one of the few Americans who gets away with pointing out that men and women really are different, and it's no good pretending this is not so. But he does it with what I consider to be real respect for women, although during the Q&A; session, one woman called him out on it, and he managed to confuse her sufficiently to have her retire laughing.He also pokes fun at religion, as you all know from having heard about Religulous, a movie he has done more recently. Further, he makes the very valid point that we cannot win the war on terror while still fighting the war on drugs. He downplays the extent to which the terrorists finance their operations with drugs, possibly because the extent of the connection was not known at that time. His big target for financing is oil, and I'm sure he's right, but there are indeed huge opium poppy fields in Afghanistan at least.If I enjoyed it so, why did I give it only four stars instead of five? Because it has been 6 years and some of the material is pretty dated. And some of it, sadly, is a little tasteless. Not bad, but not as good as to merit five stars. Don't worry, Bill, I still love you, and I know that like fine wine and Sean Connery, you have improved with age.",4,Maher is a Very Funny Fellow,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1761,"['Bill', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', 'love', 'So', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'enormously', 'hour-long', 'stand-up', 'show', 'New', 'York', 'theater', 'bonus', 'materials', 'include', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'fielding', 'questions', 'audience', 'mostly', 'serious', 'bent', 'most', 'know', 'much', 'Bill', 'humor', 'political', 'so', '2003', 'was', 'Iraq', 'George', 'Bush', 'related', 'overtly', 'political', 'issues', 'are', 'also', 'discussions', 'feminism', 'relations', 'men', 'women', 'Explore', 'mutual', 'fantasies', 'Folks', 'such', 'thing', 'one', 'few', 'Americans', 'who', 'away', 'pointing', 'out', 'men', 'women', 'really', 'are', 'different', 'good', 'pretending', 'not', 'so', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'real', 'respect', 'women', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'one', 'woman', 'called', 'out', 'managed', 'confuse', 'sufficiently', 'have', 'retire', 'laughing.He', 'also', 'fun', 'religion', 'know', 'having', 'heard', 'Religulous', 'movie', 'done', 'more', 'recently', 'Further', 'very', 'valid', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'win', 'war', 'terror', 'still', 'fighting', 'war', 'drugs', 'extent', 'terrorists', 'finance', 'operations', 'drugs', 'possibly', 'extent', 'connection', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'time', 'big', 'target', 'financing', 'oil', ""'m"", 'sure', 'right', 'are', 'indeed', 'huge', 'opium', 'poppy', 'fields', 'Afghanistan', 'least.If', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'been', '6', 'years', 'material', 'pretty', 'dated', 'sadly', 'little', 'tasteless', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'merit', 'five', 'stars', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Bill', 'still', 'love', 'know', 'fine', 'wine', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'have', 'improved', 'age']",Bill Maher - Victory Begins at Home

His most recent HBO stand up special is scaldingly funny, riffing on the failures of Bush Administration in Iraq in particular.  Maher is a Libertarian, not a Liberal (yes, there is a HUGE difference), but his disgust at the course American has taken the last three years is obvious.  Particularly poigniant is Maher's overall theme, that during the war in Iraq, the government has made no effort to get civilians on the home front to sacrifice in any meaningful way.The only knock on the CD is that the show is only an hour, and there are no extras included on the disc.",4,"Great Stuff, but No Extras",1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,682,"['Now', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'been', 'booted', 'off', 'network', 'TV', 'HBO', 'finally', 'free', 'really', 'speak', 'mind', 'most', 'recent', 'HBO', 'stand', 'up', 'special', 'scaldingly', 'funny', 'riffing', 'failures', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'Iraq', 'particular', 'Maher', 'Libertarian', 'not', 'Liberal', 'yes', 'HUGE', 'difference', 'disgust', 'course', 'American', 'taken', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'obvious', 'Particularly', 'poigniant', 'Maher', 'overall', 'theme', 'war', 'Iraq', 'government', 'made', 'effort', 'get', 'civilians', 'home', 'front', 'sacrifice', 'meaningful', 'way.The', 'only', 'knock', 'CD', 'show', 'only', 'hour', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'disc']",Bill Maher - Victory Begins at Home

784004,A3N2TUIWQ9RK03,B0000U0X2K,Gen Res,"[13, 20]","This DVD was on one of my recommendations so I rented it. This was the first time I heard of Bill Maher. First the good stuff:- Talks about Bush and about Democrats- The way words are used in debate and Americans with their short attention span decide like a hamster- Right on about the drug war. He makes great points about how we are ruining the farm land in Columbia. And how those drugs aren't as bad as some stuff we see on TV.- Makes good points about the absurd tax cuts for the rich- I liked the question and answer session which is part of the extras- There were some funny partsI read that Bill Maher was on a show called Politically Incorrect. Basically, if you are a Catholic, Muslim, female, and other things, you may be offended. Some of the stuff he said about females offended me. But plenty of women in the audience were cheering... which made me sad.... Anyway, even if I disagree with some of what he says, I would always fight for his right to say it.  Freedom of speech is one of the things that makes this country great.The audience was crazy about Bill Maher. That's why I wish he had used the opportunity to tell these people really important stuff.Maher comes to the conclusion that we can end terrorism in the following ways:1. Stop the drug war2. Eat less (be less gluttonous)3. Do racial profiling at airportsWhile the first two suggestions are very good, none of the above three things will end terrorism. Only a massive overhaul of our foreign policy will do that. (since the 1950s, we've been pursuing imperialistic interests in the Middle East to control their oil, and we've overthrown their democratically elected leaders many times)Then Maher states the following:- Muslims hate us for our freedoms- We are better than them- America foreign policy has nothing wrong with it- He states Muslims stay quiet when someone tries to make the country democratic (gives Salman Rushdie example)- All Muslim countries are the same (he gives some accurate lifestyle stories of Saudi Arabia - but countries which have Muslims in them like Morocco, India, Syria, etc. are vastly different than Saudi Arabia - but someone would walk away from Maher's speech thinking they are all like Saudi Arabia)All of the above are things that Republicans have stated. Our government and our corporate owned media state the above things all the time. Aren't liberals suppose to tell us the story that Republicans don't mention?  Maher says that Muslim people don't stand up when injustice is done. But when 1.5 million Iraqis - 500,000 of them were children, died from 1991 - 2003 because of U.S. imposed sanctions, why didn't most Americans do anything? Maher doesn't mention that. (Madeline Albright, Secretary of State under Clinton, said the deaths from the sanctions were worth it)I think Maher is right on for some things, but he totally misses the mark for others. If you want to know the real reason we invaded Iraq, you only have to read: Confessions of an Economic Hitman By John Perkins. Everything will make sense to you if you read it.  Also if you want intelligent progressivism, I would recommend renting ""The Awful Truth"" series by Michael Moore.Or for well thought out, intelligent, and rational arguments which make me proud to be a liberal, any books by Noam Chomsky, Molly Ivins, Howard Zinn or Jim Wallis are good.",3,Depends on what you like...,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,3342,"['DVD', 'was', 'one', 'recommendations', 'so', 'rented', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'First', 'good', 'stuff', 'Talks', 'Bush', 'Democrats-', 'way', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'debate', 'Americans', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'decide', 'hamster-', 'Right', 'drug', 'war', 'great', 'points', 'how', 'are', 'ruining', 'farm', 'land', 'Columbia', 'how', 'drugs', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'stuff', 'see', 'TV.-', 'Makes', 'good', 'points', 'absurd', 'tax', 'cuts', 'rich-', 'liked', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'part', 'extras-', 'were', 'funny', 'partsI', 'read', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'was', 'show', 'called', 'Politically', 'Incorrect', 'Basically', 'are', 'Catholic', 'Muslim', 'female', 'other', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'stuff', 'said', 'females', 'offended', 'plenty', 'women', 'audience', 'were', 'cheering', 'made', 'sad', 'Anyway', 'even', 'disagree', 'what', 'would', 'always', 'fight', 'right', 'say', 'Freedom', 'speech', 'one', 'things', 'country', 'great.The', 'audience', 'was', 'crazy', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'why', 'wish', 'had', 'used', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'people', 'really', 'important', 'stuff.Maher', 'conclusion', 'can', 'end', 'terrorism', 'following', 'ways:1', 'Stop', 'drug', 'war2', 'Eat', 'be', 'less', 'gluttonous', '3', 'Do', 'racial', 'profiling', 'first', 'two', 'suggestions', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'none', 'above', 'three', 'things', 'will', 'end', 'terrorism', 'Only', 'massive', 'overhaul', 'foreign', 'policy', 'will', 'do', '1950s', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pursuing', 'imperialistic', 'interests', 'Middle', 'East', 'control', 'oil', ""'ve"", 'overthrown', 'democratically', 'elected', 'leaders', 'many', 'times', 'Then', 'Maher', 'following', 'Muslims', 'hate', 'freedoms-', 'are', 'better', 'them-', 'America', 'foreign', 'policy', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'it-', 'Muslims', 'stay', 'quiet', 'when', 'someone', 'make', 'country', 'democratic', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'example', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'are', 'same', 'accurate', 'lifestyle', 'stories', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'countries', 'have', 'Muslims', 'Morocco', 'India', 'Syria', 'etc', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'someone', 'would', 'walk', 'away', 'Maher', 'speech', 'thinking', 'are', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'above', 'are', 'things', 'Republicans', 'have', 'stated', 'government', 'corporate', 'owned', 'media', 'state', 'above', 'things', 'time', 'Are', ""n't"", 'liberals', 'suppose', 'tell', 'story', 'Republicans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Maher', 'Muslim', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'when', 'injustice', 'done', 'when', '1.5', 'million', 'Iraqis', '500,000', 'were', 'children', 'died', '1991', '2003', 'U.S.', 'imposed', 'sanctions', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'most', 'Americans', 'do', 'anything', 'Maher', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Madeline', 'Albright', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Clinton', 'said', 'deaths', 'sanctions', 'were', 'worth', 'think', 'Maher', 'right', 'things', 'totally', 'mark', 'others', 'want', 'know', 'real', 'reason', 'invaded', 'Iraq', 'only', 'have', 'read', 'Confessions', 'Economic', 'Hitman', 'John', 'Perkins', 'Everything', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'read', 'Also', 'want', 'intelligent', 'progressivism', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'series', 'Michael', 'Moore.Or', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'intelligent', 'rational', 'arguments', 'make', 'proud', 'be', 'liberal', 'books', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'Molly', 'Ivins', 'Howard', 'Zinn', 'Jim', 'Wallis', 'are', 'good']",Bill Maher - Victory Begins at Home

784008,A3JYW6GWR9CS5P,B0000U0X2K,"purerockfury ""Gorillas""","[10, 11]","OK, the title is a little suck-up sounding and was more or less meant as a play on words but in some ways not. As far as political commentators/entertainers go, most just don't get it. The majority of celebrity ilk who think that they have some politcal axe to grind fail miserably at everything except constant sloganeering. It's almost as if they see it in a magazine or on a sign at a protest and they simply repeat it everywhere that they go. Then, there are a small group that pay attention to what is going on, ask questions, demand answers and make suggestions. This is what sets Bill Maher apart from the armchair activists in the entertainment business. While you have Michael Moore on one side and Rush Limbaugh on the other screaming at each other that they are always right, Bill Maher steps far away from the namecalling and posturing and more or less strives to engage in a discussion on not who's necessarily right but how do we fix what has been broken.Through humor and keen insight, Bill Maher breaks down his views on the day's most pressing issues and offers up ideas on how to really fight terrorism through everything from separating religion from state to boycotting diamond purchases. Initially; and especially if you take the conservative word for it, one might gather that Bill Maher is a &quot;liberal&quot;. In truth, he is a liberal but not even close to the way that most of Holloywood leans. Bill Maher cuts through the fat and gets to the heart of the matter and in the end, his opinions really lean neither right or left but Bill Maher has more or less created a niche all his own which seemingly leaves him open to a barrage of criticism but as one quickly discovers, he's all too ready to defend himself with a large success rate.My favorite part of the DVD is the Q &amp; A Session where he takes a series of questions from his audience. It is so very rare when someone with a certain modicum of fame gives his fans the floor to voice their opinions and concerns and Bill Maher approaches this segment in a very even-handed and rationale manner and for that, I tip my hat to him. He proves himself gracious and humble and that earns a monster amount of respect.Despite what trappings conservatives have set for him, Bill Maher does a splendid job of dodging them all and proving that liberal doesn't have to equal the steroetypes that; unfortunately, many famous liberals espouse in droves.

I was more than satisfied.The topics he discusses are varied, and he dissects them with a common-sense style that is hard to argue against it.  Better yet, he does in a way that has you laughing all the way.  Definitely one of the best comedic social criticism I own, alongside other greats like George Carlin.  Buy this.  No matter what your political persuasion, you won't be disappointed.Bill, just want you to know that, I was with you when they took your show unfairly for saying the truth about the terrorists' &quot;cowardice&quot;.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 6]","I'm always tuned in to ""Real Time With Bill Maher,"" and I agree with a lot of his views on religion (I'm agnostic), affirmative action, (most of the time) on politics and he's usually informative. But then there are times when Maher and I are just not on the same page, and a couple of those times are when he generalizes an entire group of people and believes they must all be that way. In the Q&A; part of the DVD, he stated that he thinks cigarette companies are okay and stereotypes are true. He is his own contradiction. For someone to be so pro-green and want the environment to be saved to then constantly promote weed smoking and defend cigarette companies is beyond me. He's for affirmative action, but the only name he could come up with for a black woman at the airport was ""Shaniqua"" with eight-inch fingernails. For someone who has dated so many black women--although not exactly bright ones (ex. Superhead)--you would think he would be a little more well-rounded.During the Q&A;, a Muslim guy stood up to defend Islam, but Maher's rationale is that they don't fight against extremists enough. News flash: There are Americans who don't fight against extremists here enough, but I don't see him lumping ALL Americans in one category. He'll separate the mainstream from his own group, etc., and the same should be done for Muslims. Again, I'm agnostic, but I always think he's entirely too hard on Muslims as a whole instead of a select few who are extremists. (I agree with him about the beekeeper suit though. That'll always be illogical to me.) Same goes for women. His ""jokes"" about men becoming submissive and not really believing women are smarter made me shake my head. Yes, there are women who aren't smarter than men and vice versa, but his views on women as a whole seem to be as extreme as some of the people he criticizes. He says he wants to meet in the middle, but so many of his comments are so incredibly sexist. He has so many bright women on his show, and he still doesn't seem to have a clue about women's intelligence about anything outside of shoe shopping.I fell asleep three times trying to watch this hour special, and initially I blamed it on just being tired but then I realized I was just bored out of my mind. He's had some great comedy DVDs, but this isn't one of them. It's one long complaint session, no good jokes and a lot of inaccuracies (including the one about Republicans and slavery, which he shrugged off during the Q&A;, but I'm glad a WOMAN brought that to his attention).",1,He is his own contradiction,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2524,"[""'m"", 'always', 'tuned', 'Real', 'Time', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'agree', 'lot', 'views', 'religion', ""'m"", 'agnostic', 'affirmative', 'action', 'most', 'time', 'politics', 'usually', 'informative', 'then', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Maher', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'page', 'couple', 'times', 'are', 'when', 'entire', 'group', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'Q', 'A', 'part', 'DVD', 'stated', 'cigarette', 'companies', 'are', 'okay', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'true', 'own', 'contradiction', 'someone', 'be', 'so', 'pro-green', 'want', 'environment', 'be', 'saved', 'then', 'constantly', 'promote', 'weed', 'smoking', 'defend', 'cigarette', 'companies', 'affirmative', 'action', 'only', 'name', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'black', 'woman', 'airport', 'was', 'Shaniqua', 'eight-inch', 'fingernails', 'someone', 'who', 'dated', 'so', 'many', 'black', 'women', 'not', 'exactly', 'bright', 'ones', 'ex', 'Superhead', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'well-rounded.During', 'Q', 'A', 'Muslim', 'guy', 'stood', 'up', 'defend', 'Islam', 'Maher', 'rationale', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'extremists', 'enough', 'News', 'flash', 'are', 'Americans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'extremists', 'here', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lumping', 'Americans', 'one', 'category', ""'ll"", 'separate', 'mainstream', 'own', 'group', 'etc.', 'same', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'Muslims', 'Again', ""'m"", 'agnostic', 'always', 'think', 'entirely', 'too', 'hard', 'Muslims', 'whole', 'instead', 'select', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'extremists', 'agree', 'beekeeper', 'suit', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'illogical', 'Same', 'women', 'jokes', 'men', 'becoming', 'submissive', 'not', 'really', 'believing', 'women', 'are', 'smarter', 'made', 'shake', 'head', 'Yes', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'smarter', 'men', 'vice', 'versa', 'views', 'women', 'whole', 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'extreme', 'people', 'meet', 'middle', 'so', 'many', 'comments', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'sexist', 'so', 'many', 'bright', 'women', 'show', 'still', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'women', 'intelligence', 'anything', 'shoe', 'shopping.I', 'fell', 'asleep', 'three', 'times', 'trying', 'watch', 'hour', 'special', 'initially', 'blamed', 'just', 'being', 'tired', 'then', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'bored', 'mind', 'had', 'great', 'comedy', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'one', 'one', 'long', 'complaint', 'session', 'good', 'jokes', 'lot', 'inaccuracies', 'including', 'one', 'Republicans', 'slavery', 'shrugged', 'off', 'Q', 'A', ""'m"", 'glad', 'WOMAN', 'brought', 'attention']",Bill Maher - Victory Begins at Home
