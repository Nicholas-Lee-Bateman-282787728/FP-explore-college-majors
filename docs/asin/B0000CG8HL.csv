However, if you're buying this because you want to see an excellent concert with outstanding performances, then you are in the right place!  My personal favorites were Leslie Garrett singing ""If I Loved You"", and Judi Dench's hilarious performance in ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"".  Both performances are priceless.  Each and every performance was outstanding, and I think you will enjoy this DVD very much.",5,Superb concert!,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,566,"[""'re"", 'buying', 'DVD', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'should', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'screen', '60', 'seconds', 'However', ""'re"", 'buying', 'want', 'see', 'excellent', 'concert', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'then', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'personal', 'favorites', 'were', 'Leslie', 'Garrett', 'singing', 'Loved', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'Sixteen', 'Going', 'Seventeen', 'performances', 'are', 'priceless', 'performance', 'was', 'outstanding', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'very', 'much']",Richard Rodgers - Some Enchanted Evening

776340,AMCKEVM2BJC2W,B0000CG8HL,"Mark Town ""realoldmusicman""","[0, 0]","I love these songs, or at least most of them. But somehow they do not have their emotional and musical pull in this format. I am not quite sure why. Whether it is the modest production values or some of the less-than-powerful or song-appropriate voices, the emotional power just does not come across. Note the versions of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""If I loved You."" Still, as other reviewers have noted, there are some good moments. Namely the version of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" with Judi Dench. Melodious and funny.",2,Inadequte translation not of accent but medium,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,524,"['love', 'songs', 'least', 'most', 'somehow', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'emotional', 'musical', 'pull', 'format', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'modest', 'production', 'values', 'less-than-powerful', 'song-appropriate', 'voices', 'emotional', 'power', 'just', 'not', 'come', 'Note', 'versions', 'Enchanted', 'Evening', 'loved', 'Still', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'Namely', 'version', 'Sixteen', 'Going', 'Seventeen', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Melodious', 'funny']",Richard Rodgers - Some Enchanted Evening
776341,A2JHY0CHZUM99M,B0000CG8HL,William Jurgens,"[4, 22]","What a terrible way to treat the music of a genius such as Richard Rogers.  I'm sure this ensemble didn't set out to destroy the beautiful music created by this genius, but unfortunately that is exactly what they did.First of all, the production was technically miserable.  The sound engineering was absolutely awful.  The orchestra was so powerful that the vocalists could hardly be heard.  Also, this evidently was recorded at a live event for PBS broadcast, and the auditorium had some terrible acoustics.  Anyone speaking or singing from the stage area caused terrible echos which made it all the harder to hear the vocals.  I'm sorry to be so critical, but this goes back to the failure of the sound engineering, there evidently was nothing done to correct this problem for the broadcast recording.Secondly, the selections of talent to perform the songs left a few things to be desired.  While some may get a laugh out of Judi Densch singing ""I am sixteen going on seventeen,""`I found it disgusting.  This song told a wonderful part of the story in the ""Sound of Music"" and this presentation lowered it to slapstick.There are two bright points in this dismal production, the performances of ""No Other Love"" ffom ""Me and Juliet"" and ""Johnny One Note""  from ""Babes in Arms.""  At least the perfomers had some talent and also stage presence.Finally, I'm sorry, but the Brits just don't cut it in performing selections from ""Oklahoma.""  Seeing a Brit twirl a rope is just about the worst thing you want to see.  So, if the idea of this production was to introduce a new generation to the wonder of Richard Rogers compositions, it fails miserably, in fact, it may go as far as to turn people off to the genius of this great composer.",1,"If you like Richard Rogers music, Pass this one by",1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,1732,"['What', 'terrible', 'way', 'treat', 'music', 'genius', 'such', 'Richard', 'Rogers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'ensemble', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'beautiful', 'music', 'created', 'genius', 'unfortunately', 'exactly', 'what', 'did.First', 'production', 'was', 'technically', 'miserable', 'sound', 'engineering', 'was', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'orchestra', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'vocalists', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'heard', 'Also', 'evidently', 'was', 'recorded', 'live', 'event', 'PBS', 'broadcast', 'auditorium', 'had', 'terrible', 'acoustics', 'Anyone', 'speaking', 'singing', 'stage', 'area', 'caused', 'terrible', 'echos', 'made', 'harder', 'hear', 'vocals', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'be', 'so', 'critical', 'back', 'failure', 'sound', 'engineering', 'evidently', 'was', 'nothing', 'done', 'correct', 'problem', 'broadcast', 'recording.Secondly', 'selections', 'talent', 'perform', 'songs', 'left', 'few', 'things', 'be', 'desired', 'may', 'get', 'laugh', 'Judi', 'Densch', 'singing', 'am', 'sixteen', 'going', 'seventeen', 'found', 'disgusting', 'song', 'told', 'wonderful', 'part', 'story', 'Sound', 'Music', 'presentation', 'lowered', 'slapstick.There', 'are', 'two', 'bright', 'points', 'dismal', 'production', 'performances', 'No', 'Other', 'Love', 'ffom', 'Me', 'Juliet', 'Johnny', 'One', 'Note', 'Babes', 'Arms', 'least', 'perfomers', 'had', 'talent', 'also', 'stage', 'presence.Finally', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Brits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'performing', 'selections', 'Oklahoma', 'Seeing', 'Brit', 'twirl', 'rope', 'just', 'worst', 'thing', 'want', 'see', 'So', 'idea', 'production', 'was', 'introduce', 'new', 'generation', 'wonder', 'Richard', 'Rogers', 'compositions', 'miserably', 'fact', 'may', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'turn', 'people', 'genius', 'great', 'composer']",Richard Rodgers - Some Enchanted Evening
