I received this order quickly, the casing in great shape.  I opened it up & noted what I thought was a scratch. Used DVD and scratches not so unusual.  I had to leave the next day for work and was gone for over a month, leaving this DVD unplayed.  When I got home & tried using it, discovered that the 'scratch' was instead a deep groove which caused the dvd to play approx. 10 minutes befored freezing.When I contacted Amazon about this was informed it was past the return time in their guarantee, Amazon did give my request to  Goodwill of Silicon Valley which had sold to me. They too refused to let me return this. I have done a lot of business with Amazon & this is 1st time they haven't come through. Yes it's my fault for not actually viewing the DVD upon receipt. As all the others I have purchased have been good, I didn't feel the necessity to do so.  It's not Amazon I blame but Goodwill of Silicon Valley. They are the ones that sold it. I will never buy any item from Goodwill of Silicon Valley ever again! They lied about the condition of this DVD and when confronted about it wouldn't allow me to return this. Do not trust this Good will of Silicon Valley. Bad business with them.",2,"Amazon is great but,Goodwill of Silicon Valley not trustworthy.",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,1336,"['DVD', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'purchased', 'lot', 'used', 'DVDs', 'first', 'time', 'be', 'so', 'unhappy', 'received', 'order', 'quickly', 'casing', 'great', 'shape', 'opened', 'up', 'noted', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'scratch', 'Used', 'DVD', 'scratches', 'not', 'so', 'unusual', 'had', 'leave', 'next', 'day', 'work', 'was', 'gone', 'month', 'leaving', 'DVD', 'unplayed', 'When', 'got', 'home', 'tried', 'using', 'discovered', ""'scratch"", 'was', 'instead', 'deep', 'groove', 'caused', 'dvd', 'play', 'approx', '10', 'minutes', 'befored', 'freezing.When', 'contacted', 'Amazon', 'was', 'informed', 'was', 'return', 'time', 'guarantee', 'Amazon', 'did', 'give', 'request', 'Goodwill', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'had', 'sold', 'too', 'refused', 'let', 'return', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'business', 'Amazon', '1st', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'Yes', 'fault', 'not', 'actually', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'receipt', 'others', 'have', 'purchased', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'necessity', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'Amazon', 'blame', 'Goodwill', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'are', 'ones', 'sold', 'will', 'never', 'buy', 'item', 'Goodwill', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'ever', 'again', 'lied', 'condition', 'DVD', 'when', 'confronted', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'return', 'Do', 'not', 'trust', 'Good', 'will', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'Bad', 'business']",N/A

This was one of the first Simmons aerobic routines I'd done, so it took a few tries for me to get the routine down - but don't give up because you WILL get it.As with most of Richard Simmon's workouts, you start out with a warm up and each song is progressively a little more energetic until the cool-down - this one is 30 minutes in total length.  Also featured in every Simmons routine I've done so far, and this is no exception, are his motivational and encouraging comments.If you doubt you're really getting a workout, take a look at some of the other (less fun) tapes and you'll see many of the same motions, exercises and stretches.  The difference is the fun and pure joy Richard Simmons brings to his videos.  Why do plain old exercises when you can dance and have fun with Richard?  I've never hurt myself with any of his routines, as I have with others (particularly my knees).
