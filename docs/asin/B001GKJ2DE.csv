1196907,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,B001GKJ2DE,Aaron Von Raschke,"[5, 15]","WANTED stars James McAvoy (I guess Shia Lebouf wasn't available?) as Wesley, a down on his luck guy who works at a dead end job, has a girlfriend that cheats on him, and has no money to his name. Just when he's reached the end of his rope, he's recruited by a mysterious woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) to join an elite group of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". It's revealed that Wesley's estranged father was a member of The Fraternity and one of the top assassins who, ironically, was killed by a rogue Fraternity member who left the group. Under the guidance of Fox, Fraternity leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and a few other characters, Wesley undergoes intense and brutal training in order to harness the inherited assassin-like characteristics that were genetically passed on to him by his father. The ultimate goal: to find the man who killed his father and avenge his death.The premise sounds really cool, but when I first saw the trailer for this movie it automatically had two BIG strikes against it. One being Angelina Jolie who I absolutely can't stand and the other being the shots of bullets moving in slow motion and apparently curving around objects to hit a target that's hidden in the background. Personally, slow motion bullets annoy the hell out of me. I know, it's weird and I really can't explain it. Maybe because of the fact of how RIDICULOUS it looks! How about slow motion brains coming out of someone's skull AFTER the bullet hits it? Now that would be cool. So anyway, with the two strikes against it back when it was in theaters, that meant only one thing... wait 'til the DVD comes out. Which I did. And after finally watching it, hoping to be proved wrong about my assumptions about how bad the movies is, I can say that it is as bad, if not WORSE than I thought.Basically WANTED is a one and a half star movie (MAYBE even two) that's saved by two things: Morgan Freeman and great special effects. Other than that, the film is poorly written and it's amazing how a screenplay like this can even be considered by a major studio and given the budget that this film has. The action scenes and shootouts are ridiculous and seem like they were dreamed up by someone with the mentality (or imagination) of a five year old boy (for example, a shootout in which both of the gunmen are such expert shots that every time they open fire at each other, their respective bullets crash into one another). And trust me... I love dumb Action movies with over the top violence... but this one was just horrible. It seems like half the movie is in slow motion for absolutely no reason other than to look cool or something. The best way that I can explain it is by asking a question. Have you ever watched a movie that's so dumb, that you actually felt insulted or even offended by even watching it because of the level of stupidity? Well, WANTED is that movie for me.As far as good things, the special effects were great. The effects showcased a lot of unbelievably stupid scenes but the actual effects were executed very well. Even amidst the stupidity, I actually did find a couple of moments that I liked in the film. My favorite scene is where Wesley shoots a guy in the head, sticks his gun through the hole in the guy's head and runs around with his corpse as a shield and basically shooting his firearm while it's shoved completely through the guys skull. Also the climax of the film is almost like a video game where Wesley appears to be going through different levels and taking on a miniboss of sorts until finally reaching the person (or people) that he REALLY wants to kill. There's also a twist toward the end that I didn't see coming. I won't say what it is, but let's just say that its a total ripoff of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. And the fact that Morgan Freeman was in the movie made it a tad bit more watchable. Granted, he plays just about the same guy in almost every movie nowadays but his mere presence among the group of morons they decided to cast in this movie is what kept me from stopping the movie halfway through and just giving up altogether.Overall, I wouldn't recommend WANTED unless you like Angelina Jolie (you do after all get to see her naked wet buttocks along with her terrible acting) or unless you like really stupid Action films with an emphasis on the Action and no brains to the story whatsoever. Also the one disc version of the DVD has absolutely no Extra Features. But with my personal feelings on the movie aside, WANTED has moments of fun in it, great effects and visuals, and an interesting twist in the plot. However, if you're anything like me and can't stand watching films with weak scripts, then you should avoid this movie like the plague because it's about as weak as it gets.2 stars",2,Did a five year old write this movie?,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,4749,"['WANTED', 'stars', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'guess', 'Shia', 'Lebouf', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'Wesley', 'down', 'luck', 'guy', 'who', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'money', 'name', 'Just', 'when', 'reached', 'end', 'rope', 'recruited', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'named', 'Fox', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'join', 'elite', 'group', 'assassins', 'called', 'Fraternity', 'revealed', 'Wesley', 'estranged', 'father', 'was', 'member', 'Fraternity', 'one', 'top', 'assassins', 'who', 'ironically', 'was', 'killed', 'rogue', 'Fraternity', 'member', 'who', 'left', 'group', 'guidance', 'Fox', 'Fraternity', 'leader', 'Sloan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'Wesley', 'intense', 'brutal', 'training', 'order', 'harness', 'inherited', 'assassin-like', 'characteristics', 'were', 'genetically', 'passed', 'father', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'avenge', 'death.The', 'premise', 'really', 'cool', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'automatically', 'had', 'two', 'BIG', 'strikes', 'One', 'being', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'absolutely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'being', 'shots', 'bullets', 'moving', 'slow', 'motion', 'apparently', 'curving', 'around', 'hit', 'target', 'hidden', 'background', 'Personally', 'slow', 'motion', 'bullets', 'annoy', 'hell', 'know', 'weird', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'how', 'RIDICULOUS', 'How', 'about', 'slow', 'motion', 'brains', 'coming', 'someone', 'skull', 'AFTER', 'bullet', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'So', 'anyway', 'two', 'strikes', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'meant', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'wait', 'DVD', 'out', 'Which', 'did', 'finally', 'watching', 'hoping', 'be', 'proved', 'wrong', 'assumptions', 'how', 'bad', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'bad', 'not', 'WORSE', 'thought.Basically', 'WANTED', 'one', 'half', 'star', 'movie', 'MAYBE', 'even', 'two', 'saved', 'two', 'things', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'Other', 'film', 'poorly', 'written', 'amazing', 'how', 'screenplay', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'considered', 'major', 'studio', 'given', 'budget', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'shootouts', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'seem', 'were', 'dreamed', 'up', 'someone', 'mentality', 'imagination', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'example', 'shootout', 'gunmen', 'are', 'such', 'expert', 'shots', 'time', 'open', 'fire', 'other', 'respective', 'bullets', 'crash', 'one', 'trust', 'love', 'dumb', 'Action', 'movies', 'top', 'violence', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'movie', 'slow', 'motion', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'other', 'look', 'cool', 'something', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'explain', 'asking', 'question', 'Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'so', 'dumb', 'actually', 'felt', 'insulted', 'even', 'offended', 'even', 'watching', 'level', 'stupidity', 'Well', 'WANTED', 'movie', 'me.As', 'far', 'as', 'good', 'things', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'effects', 'showcased', 'lot', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'actual', 'effects', 'were', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'Even', 'stupidity', 'actually', 'did', 'find', 'couple', 'moments', 'liked', 'film', 'favorite', 'scene', 'where', 'Wesley', 'guy', 'head', 'gun', 'hole', 'guy', 'head', 'around', 'corpse', 'shield', 'basically', 'shooting', 'firearm', 'shoved', 'completely', 'guys', 'skull', 'Also', 'climax', 'film', 'almost', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'Wesley', 'be', 'going', 'different', 'levels', 'taking', 'miniboss', 'sorts', 'finally', 'reaching', 'person', 'people', 'REALLY', 'kill', 'also', 'twist', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'total', 'ripoff', 'EMPIRE', 'STRIKES', 'BACK', 'fact', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'tad', 'bit', 'more', 'watchable', 'Granted', 'just', 'same', 'guy', 'almost', 'movie', 'nowadays', 'mere', 'presence', 'group', 'morons', 'decided', 'cast', 'movie', 'what', 'kept', 'stopping', 'movie', 'halfway', 'just', 'giving', 'up', 'altogether.Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'WANTED', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'naked', 'wet', 'buttocks', 'terrible', 'acting', 'like', 'really', 'stupid', 'Action', 'films', 'emphasis', 'Action', 'brains', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'Also', 'one', 'disc', 'version', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'Extra', 'Features', 'personal', 'feelings', 'movie', 'aside', 'WANTED', 'moments', 'fun', 'great', 'effects', 'visuals', 'interesting', 'twist', 'plot', 'However', ""'re"", 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'films', 'weak', 'scripts', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'plague', 'as', 'weak', 'stars']",N/A

They may be outlandish, but they're interwoven effectively into the story (and are not as hyper as the ""Nightwatch/Daywatch"" saga).*Loads of really cool guns, cars, bullets, costumes, and settings.  Production design is awesome.*Filming style is great.  It gets a little hyper and shaky, but not overwhelmingly so.  Lots of slow-motion and solid camera work makes it very fluid.*There is some graphic blood and some brutal violence, but it hardly detracts from the story.  It accentuates the action very well.*The story is great and easy to comprehend.  Was worried that they would leave it wide open, but they actually had a good, complete ending.*It's not all serious action.  There are also some good comic moments.*I don't know about anybody else, but didn't expect any of the plot twists towards the end.  They were very effective, believable, and brought the story together very well.  It even made some earlier scenes clearer.*The main character is phenomenal.  He shows a fantastic evolution from a lowlife twerp into an awe-inspiring killing machine.  The narrative really adds to the character as well, and makes us feel for him.* The other characters are allright.  Fox (Angelina Jolie) is fairly well-developed, and has a heck of a mean streak (and she looks awesome!).  Sloan (Morgan Freeman) is...well...Morgan Freeman.*Very strong themes about self-control and standing up for oneself.*Also brought up one or two good moral questions concerning the assasination business.  The story also delves into some emotionally deep stuff (like a father trying to protect his son).*A few interesting visual motifs (loved seeing the guy moving through the broken loom, as if he was caught in a web of fate).*The overall attitude of the film, through the characters, action, and dialogue, is very mean (in a good way).  A few parts even made me want to applaud the main character, for proving that he wasn't going to take any crud from anybody.*Excellent music (loved hearing NIN's ""Everyday is Exactly the Same""; Danny Elfman's score and his song ""The Little Things"" are great too).The Bad Things*A couple of the action/chase sequences had some shaky camera movements that made it hard to see the action (but it was still mostly comprehensible).The Questionable Things*The film's attitude has a few moments where it seems to insult the audience (I believe the main character called us pathetic lowlives or something...).  I found it hilarious, but some of you may find it distasteful.*Some parts really are over-the-top or ridiculous (like the idea that targets are selected by the randomly misthreaded threads on a loom...not to mention the idea of curving a bullet's path or flipping cars onto busses...).  Such absurdity can be seen either as stylish and fantastic, or as weird and silly.Take the character, narrative, and attitude of ""Fight Club,"" and mix it with the plot structure, themes, and action of the first ""Matrix,"" and you would have something like ""Wanted."" It has a good amount of crazy action, but above all, it has a real bad attitude.  This turned out to be a good thing; not only did it make the action seem more intense, but it also made the character stand out more, and introduced some fascinating themes.  It is way deeper and more distinct than I thought it would be.  The final message (""This is me taking control of my life...what the F are you doing?"") made me feel powerful after leaving the theater.

I like action movies-I think they've gotten a lot more interesting and attractive since the '90s. I don't necessarily have a problem with violence, and the film's premise interested me.  The movie however is insufferable and abrasive from the start. The violence is pointless, hateful, and needlessly self-righteous.  In the last frames, I actually found myself loathing James Macavoy himself as I left the theatre, esp. after he insults the audience, who's forcibly indulged his teenage BS for over 90 minutes at that point.  I cared absolutely nothing about what happened to any of these characters, especially the protagonist, and found myself cheering for their violent demises within the first fifteen minutes of the film.  I hate PETA and I hate rodents, but when the movie has tiny bombs strapped to the backs of rats and blowing them up, I desperately wanted to see buckets of fake blood poured over everyone involved in this smug production.  (Wow this movie actually made me hate Morgan Freeman, who would've thought anyone could dislike Morgan Freeman!)Wait there is one sympathetic character in all this:  The ""hero's"" boss who of all thing's actually wants the narcissistic self-pitying ingrate and whiner James Macavoy character to turn in his work on time, stop falling asleep at his desk and surfing the internet on her time.  The nerve.  For all of this said boss is publicly and personally (and I mean personally) humiliated.  The product of a neurotic with a persecution complex and possible brain damage, this film seems to see nothing in between being pathetic and passive and a murdering tyranic @$$hole.  Keep in mind that after the movie's ""twist"" the film actually asks us to care about these characters.

As an exciting piece of filmmaking, `Wanted' raises a certain bar.  It relishes in its abundance of bloody violence, using CGI embellishments and sharply executed editing to keep the audience drawn in from frame to frame.  Story-wise, the film is a tad underwhelmed considering that its own plot holes derail some of the satisfaction one could have here.  The acting is actually very well across the board.  James McAvoy dons a perfect American accent and Angelina is well within her element as a serious `bad girl'.  She knocks another action persona out of the park with effortless sensuality and devilish aggression.Sadly, the film is snagged by horribly used narration (it just isn't handled well here at all) and the plot developments are weighed down by some regurgitated sequences.  Still, the action is top notch and exhilarating and the special effects are mind blowing in parts (that train sequence in particular is stellar).  McAvoy's office `switch' is the best scene in the film (I totally want to hit someone in the face with my keyboard) and the car chase in the red corvette really sets a bar VERY high for film's to follow.If you want a mindless action flick that will keep you tuned in, this is for you.  I was hoping for something a tad smarter (even Jolie's `Salt' has more common sense at use here) but then again, when you have a film circling the actions of a thousand year old cult of assassins who get their targets names from the looms in a textile mill, well...I guess you can't expect a really `smart' film.",3,Depends on what you wanted...,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1624,"['most', 'films', 'genre', 'Wanted', 'steady', 'list', 'pros', 'cons', 'exciting', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Wanted', 'certain', 'bar', 'abundance', 'bloody', 'violence', 'using', 'CGI', 'embellishments', 'sharply', 'executed', 'editing', 'keep', 'audience', 'drawn', 'frame', 'frame', 'Story-wise', 'film', 'tad', 'underwhelmed', 'considering', 'own', 'plot', 'holes', 'derail', 'satisfaction', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'here', 'acting', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'board', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'perfect', 'American', 'accent', 'Angelina', 'well', 'element', 'serious', 'bad', 'girl', 'action', 'park', 'effortless', 'sensuality', 'devilish', 'aggression.Sadly', 'film', 'snagged', 'horribly', 'used', 'narration', 'just', ""n't"", 'handled', 'well', 'here', 'plot', 'developments', 'are', 'weighed', 'down', 'regurgitated', 'sequences', 'Still', 'action', 'top', 'notch', 'exhilarating', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mind', 'blowing', 'parts', 'train', 'sequence', 'particular', 'stellar', 'McAvoy', 'office', 'switch', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'totally', 'want', 'hit', 'someone', 'face', 'keyboard', 'car', 'chase', 'red', 'corvette', 'really', 'bar', 'VERY', 'high', 'film', 'follow.If', 'want', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'will', 'keep', 'tuned', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'tad', 'smarter', 'even', 'Jolie', 'Salt', 'more', 'common', 'sense', 'use', 'here', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'have', 'film', 'circling', 'actions', 'thousand', 'year', 'old', 'cult', 'assassins', 'who', 'get', 'targets', 'names', 'looms', 'textile', 'mill', 'well', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'really', 'smart', 'film']",N/A

The story, that of a clueless office drone being recruited to a group of master assassins, is very interesting. The execution, not so much.A gigantic loom, the Loom of Fate, spins threads and true to the mythology of Fate, a binary code-like interpretation of kinks in the fabric woven by the loom determines who must be assassinated in order to promote the greater good.Gibson, McAvoy's character, is a pawn being used by the group to eliminate a rogue assassin.There are twists and turns to this tale, but they're achingly predicatable which totally detracts from the enjoyment of the film. There are too many elements strain one's ability to believe in the film, such as curving a bullet, a wax that can instantly heal people, and almost superhuman powers derived from the ability to control one's autonomic responses.Jolie is sexy and scary as always, and McAvoy ably portrays the nerd turned expert killer.

But regular action movies don't feature assassins using centrifical force to make bullets curve out of guns, or make the bullets turn corners and go around things like a miniature guided missle. Not to mention being able to aim exactly where to land their cars after flipping them through the air. And what kind of assassin training prepares them to survive inside a high-speed train car that plummets thousands of feet down a canyon? Just a little overkill on the incredible here. If this were a movie version of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, then it would be OK! Oh yeah, you get shot? No problem, just submerge yourself into some high-tech mix of water and concrete, and presto! You're healed within minutes!This just didn't feel like a real sci-fi type movie, so to me it's just a highly unrealistic action movie.And were the screenwriters trying to set some kind of record as to how many times they could squeeze the f-word into their script? Even the nerdy fat-lady boss spews the f-word seemingly more times per minute than Eddie Murphy in Raw! A lame, cop-out attempt to spice up the script that just doesn't work. A real turn-off...I don't mind much hearing it if it's just here and there, but regular, dignified-looking people in an office setting rattling it off every three seconds is a bit overkill.I guess this is based on some comic series, but the characters in this movie just don't have much pizzaz or personality--they're just regular hoods, and McAvoy's character is just some geek who turns into some Rambo type within six weeks. The plainness of these characters don't lend themselves to a story with such crazily unrealistic action.

1196934,AI46E73DWKD2B,B001GKJ2DE,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","WANTED (2008) is a film without pretense and KNOWS exactly what it is. Apparently based off of a comic book, I find this adaptation one of the best of the 00s, because the only other one in that decade I even like is ""Batman Begins"". ""Wanted"" has a confidence and flair that permeates throughout it's running time. It starts off with a literal bang as a mysterious assassin (played by David O'Hara) is targeted in a skyscraper office building by a group of rival assassins. This pulse-pounding scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie, letting the viewer know that it will be populated with mind-blowing action sequences. The next scene introduces us to the movie's hero, Wesley (excellently played by James McAvoy), a nerdy, under-confident, anxiety-ridden office worker on anti-depressant meds. Not your typical movie hero!Soon into the movie, Wesley finds out that the killed assassin in the film's opening sequence was his father, who abandoned him as a baby. He finds this out from another assassin named Fox (Angelina Jolie in a sublime, refreshing, and of course, sexy role!), who rescues him from his father's killer in a pharmacy in yet another action-packed scene. Wesley is eventually introduced to Fox's boss Sloan (superbly played by screen legend Morgan Freeman). Sloan tells Wesley that his anxiety is not an illness, but a gift that gives him special skills, including being able to curve bullets! At first unconvinced and reluctant to join ""The Fraternity"" of assassins, Wesley gets fed up with his terrible life, which includes a backstabbing best ""friend"" (hilarious work by comic actor Chris Pratt), who is cheating with Wesley's girlfriend (played by Kristen Hager, essaying the vain, vapid, ""dumb"" blonde stereotype to perfection), and Wesley's martinet boss (terrifically played by Lorna Scott). These ""side"" characters make the movie work as much as the superstar main cast.Although the core of Wesley's training sequences are of the standard, been-there-done-that, but the film is so stylish, directed with such flair, and actors really drawing you into the story, that one becomes invested in Wesley's progress and eventual success. McAvoy is incredibly persuasive in a career-changing role for him. He doesn't look like an action hero, but that's kind of the point. A movie like this makes one believe that ANYONE can do what Wesley does with proper motivation and training. It may border on the absurd, but the confidence of this movie is heady to say the least. The action scenes leap off the screen. Most current action movies are repetitive, but the scenes in this movie make me want to pop it in my dvd ever so often. But the action isn't the only pull as there is a lot of humor, too. But I think the main draw of the film is in it's underdog style of storytelling, with Wesley being a character that we can all root for. Even as outrageous as the premise, this movie does a fantastic job of involving you in the story with interesting, well-performed characters, unwavering action scenes, and a real sense of itself.",5,Unapologetically entertaining!,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,3055,"['WANTED', '2008', 'film', 'pretense', 'KNOWS', 'exactly', 'what', 'Apparently', 'based', 'off', 'comic', 'book', 'find', 'adaptation', 'one', 'best', '00s', 'only', 'other', 'one', 'decade', 'even', 'like', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Wanted', 'confidence', 'flair', 'running', 'time', 'literal', 'bang', 'mysterious', 'assassin', 'played', 'David', ""O'Hara"", 'targeted', 'skyscraper', 'office', 'building', 'group', 'rival', 'assassins', 'pulse-pounding', 'scene', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'letting', 'viewer', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'populated', 'mind-blowing', 'action', 'sequences', 'next', 'scene', 'introduces', 'movie', 'hero', 'Wesley', 'excellently', 'played', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'nerdy', 'under-confident', 'anxiety-ridden', 'office', 'worker', 'anti-depressant', 'meds', 'Not', 'typical', 'movie', 'hero', 'Soon', 'movie', 'Wesley', 'out', 'killed', 'assassin', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'was', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'out', 'assassin', 'named', 'Fox', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'sublime', 'refreshing', 'course', 'sexy', 'role', 'who', 'father', 'killer', 'pharmacy', 'yet', 'action-packed', 'scene', 'Wesley', 'eventually', 'introduced', 'Fox', 'boss', 'Sloan', 'superbly', 'played', 'screen', 'legend', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sloan', 'Wesley', 'anxiety', 'not', 'illness', 'gift', 'special', 'skills', 'including', 'being', 'able', 'curve', 'bullets', 'first', 'unconvinced', 'reluctant', 'join', 'Fraternity', 'assassins', 'Wesley', 'fed', 'up', 'terrible', 'life', 'backstabbing', 'best', 'friend', 'hilarious', 'work', 'comic', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'who', 'cheating', 'Wesley', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Hager', 'essaying', 'vain', 'vapid', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'stereotype', 'perfection', 'Wesley', 'martinet', 'boss', 'terrifically', 'played', 'Lorna', 'Scott', 'side', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'superstar', 'main', 'core', 'Wesley', 'training', 'sequences', 'are', 'standard', 'been-there-done-that', 'film', 'so', 'stylish', 'directed', 'such', 'flair', 'actors', 'really', 'drawing', 'story', 'one', 'invested', 'Wesley', 'progress', 'eventual', 'success', 'McAvoy', 'incredibly', 'persuasive', 'career-changing', 'role', ""n't"", 'look', 'action', 'hero', 'kind', 'point', 'movie', 'one', 'believe', 'ANYONE', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'Wesley', 'proper', 'motivation', 'training', 'may', 'border', 'absurd', 'confidence', 'movie', 'heady', 'say', 'least', 'action', 'scenes', 'leap', 'off', 'screen', 'Most', 'current', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'repetitive', 'scenes', 'movie', 'make', 'want', 'pop', 'dvd', 'ever', 'so', 'often', 'action', ""n't"", 'only', 'pull', 'lot', 'humor', 'too', 'think', 'main', 'draw', 'film', 'underdog', 'style', 'storytelling', 'Wesley', 'being', 'character', 'can', 'root', 'Even', 'as', 'outrageous', 'premise', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'job', 'involving', 'story', 'interesting', 'well-performed', 'characters', 'unwavering', 'action', 'scenes', 'real', 'sense']",N/A

What really made this film for me was the cleverly constructed ongoing inner dialogue within the mind of former passive account manager now would-be-assassin Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) who finds himself in an underground world of trained killers known as ""the Fraternity"" who have been orchestrating the balance of power in the world for a thousand years. This interior conversation and analysis of life as Wesley perceives it is dark comedy at its best and adds a dimension to the story line that sets `Wanted' apart from most other films that fall within this genre.Another fascinating aspect of this film is the manner in which it subtly develops a more personal, intimate story within the context of the greater adventure drama exploding before the viewer. In an unexpected way Wesley Gibson's life story becomes a reflection of everyone's daily struggles, doubts and dreams. The financial hardships, the dead-end job, the harassing supervisor, the disloyal best friend and the dysfunctional romantic relationship all play their part in the unfolding drama and are important components in the evolution and maturation of the main character.`Wanted' succeeds in keeping the viewing audience entertained and focused despite the absurdity of many of the on-screen antics and will leave a smile on your face and maybe even elicit a chuckle or two at the very end.

1196944,A3F0OFSE2M25U2,B001GKJ2DE,bronx book nerd,"[0, 0]","An action-packed movie that keeps the adrenaline flowing through-out.  The car chases, fights and shootouts are clever and captivating, although to be honest they are somewhat just variations of what we've seen before, with literally some new twists as trained assasins shoot bullets that travel around obstacles to reach their targets. The final plot twist is fascinating but I don't think the movie takes sufficient advantage of its tragic aspect.  The final message - ""what have you done to take control of your life"" - has punch, and you want to get up from your couch and take control but then the garbage has to be taken out, and the kids need help with homework, etc, etc. and we all can't become assasins, at least not full time.McCavoy is convincing as the abused office worker turned trained assasin, who overcomes his fears and discovers ""who he is"".  Jolie is credible as McCavoy's recruiting officer into the assasin fraternity, though I will forever be unconvinced that her skinny arms and equally thin frame are capable of wreaking all that havoc on other humans. Morgan Freeman I suspect has played this role as head honcho repeatedly enough in various guises to do it flawlessly.There are scenes where McCavoy's office supervisor spews foul language at a rate approximating the speed of light.  The mute button is there for a reason.  The cursing for some reason was written to target Christian themes, and there is a scene where an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is pierced with a sword.  I don't think the producers were trying to impart theological messages. I'm sure devout Christians would appreciate a littel more consideration.All in all, however, the movie is captivating in its non-stop action, plot twist and in its portrayal of the evolution of Mccavoy's character.",4,"Action Packed, Great Plot Twists, but Keep Finger on Mute Button",1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1793,"['action-packed', 'movie', 'adrenaline', 'flowing', 'through-out', 'car', 'chases', 'fights', 'shootouts', 'are', 'clever', 'captivating', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'somewhat', 'just', 'variations', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'literally', 'new', 'twists', 'trained', 'assasins', 'shoot', 'bullets', 'travel', 'obstacles', 'reach', 'targets', 'final', 'plot', 'twist', 'fascinating', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'sufficient', 'advantage', 'tragic', 'aspect', 'final', 'message', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'take', 'control', 'life', 'punch', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'couch', 'take', 'control', 'then', 'garbage', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'kids', 'need', 'help', 'homework', 'etc', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'become', 'assasins', 'least', 'not', 'full', 'time.McCavoy', 'convincing', 'abused', 'office', 'worker', 'turned', 'trained', 'assasin', 'who', 'fears', 'discovers', 'who', 'Jolie', 'credible', 'McCavoy', 'recruiting', 'officer', 'assasin', 'fraternity', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'unconvinced', 'skinny', 'arms', 'equally', 'thin', 'frame', 'are', 'capable', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'other', 'humans', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'suspect', 'played', 'role', 'head', 'honcho', 'repeatedly', 'enough', 'various', 'guises', 'do', 'flawlessly.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'McCavoy', 'office', 'supervisor', 'spews', 'foul', 'language', 'rate', 'approximating', 'speed', 'light', 'mute', 'button', 'there', 'reason', 'cursing', 'reason', 'was', 'written', 'target', 'Christian', 'themes', 'scene', 'where', 'image', 'Lady', 'Guadalupe', 'pierced', 'sword', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'impart', 'theological', 'messages', ""'m"", 'sure', 'devout', 'Christians', 'would', 'appreciate', 'littel', 'more', 'consideration.All', 'however', 'movie', 'captivating', 'non-stop', 'action', 'plot', 'twist', 'portrayal', 'evolution', 'Mccavoy', 'character']",N/A

1196948,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001GKJ2DE,Caleb Williams,"[1, 3]","Come on now really? Don't get me wrong, this film was very good for what it was but a lot of it served absolutely no purpose than to give the action junkie in all of us a quick thrill. Given the cast at the helm, you would be forgiven for believing that this film could be a bit more than a shallow attempt at a dramatic but action packed film. Seriously, the fact that Morgan Freeman was involved should have given this film a 5 star rating from the get-go but even he couldn't save this shallow travesty. I found myself being both annoyed and confused by this film and hopefully, I'll be able to share in my annoyance and confusion towards this film with readers of my review.Wanted is a story about the definitive nobody named Wesley Gibson (Macavoy). His life is repetitive, tedious, monotonous and every other word in the English dictionary that describes it as a bit dull and uneventful. He works in a job he hates for a boss who's the most annoying person in the world, did I mention she's fat? Well that's apparently pretty important for this bitch of a boss stereotype. He has a girlfriend who's cheating on him with his apparent best friend (brief sex scene with this, woo hoo) and his life just seems to be going nowhere. One day while picking up his prescription of anxiety pills, Gibson is confronted by a sexy vixen (a bit too tough for my liking but there you go) we come to know as Fox (Jolie). She tells him that he's the son of one of the greatest assassins that ever lived and the man that killed him is now trying to kill Wesley. Wesley learns that his Father belonged to a fraternity of expert assassins lead by Sloan (Freeman, I know awesome right? Wrong) and it's now Wesley's fate to join and kill the man who killed his father. He is then trained by the fraternity to make him good enough to take the man down.The whole plot in itself is generally that straight forward; it creates an excuse to have a whole lot of blood and bullets, while struggling to instil a sense of depth in our characters. It is straight forward but as is with most films these days, there has to be a ""clever"" twist at the end to make you think like enduring the whole painful movie was worth it. The big name actors were cool. Morgan Freeman presented his usual casual authoritative character who will take guff from nobody. Angelina Jolie, although I hate to say it as I do think she's a really good actress. Her only obvious purpose in this movie was to look a bit pretty and arouse the horny teenagers watching this. James Macavoy annoyed the hell out of me, for the first part of the film as he just came across as depressing and his annoying screaming did nothing to quash my hatred.The only genuinely redeeming part of this film tends to be the action and the special effects which are involved in such action sequences as are featured within the film. However, even the action gets to a point at times where I just find it a bit exhausting as a lot of it doesn't make sense. A few examples of it not making sense are in the car chase scene in which a Dodge Viper is trying desperately to escape what I remember to be a Dog Food delivery truck. Now at this point Wesley has become pretty freaked out by all the shooting so makes a run for it. Fox, all angered and sexy jumps in her equally sexy and mechanical Dodge Viper and gets Wesley in the car without stopping and travelling over more than 60 MPH without breaking his legs or some part of his spine. The other part is simply how the Dodge struggles to get away from the truck. I guess this can be explained away by just saying it's a movie, but surely the makers could have done a terminator type chase. They could have had the enemy in a big bad and destructive truck and the victims in a sexy, but not too powerful vehicle.Personally, if you're looking for a movie that isn't a waste of real acting talent, then you should seriously look elsewhere. If you're a pre-pubescent child who doesn't like to think too much and likes to look at pretty women who don't think whilst acting, then this is genuinely the movie for you. It's violent, it's a bit sexy and it's slightly cool in some parts, but for the film fan that likes to think and enjoys a bit of depth to their movie, then this is sincerely something you should stay away from.",2,Just Awful,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,4298,"['Come', 'now', 'really', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'was', 'lot', 'served', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'give', 'action', 'junkie', 'quick', 'thrill', 'Given', 'cast', 'helm', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'believing', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'shallow', 'attempt', 'dramatic', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'Seriously', 'fact', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'involved', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'film', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'get-go', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'shallow', 'travesty', 'found', 'being', 'annoyed', 'confused', 'film', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'share', 'annoyance', 'confusion', 'towards', 'film', 'readers', 'review.Wanted', 'story', 'definitive', 'nobody', 'named', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'Macavoy', 'life', 'repetitive', 'tedious', 'monotonous', 'other', 'word', 'English', 'dictionary', 'bit', 'dull', 'uneventful', 'job', 'boss', 'who', 'most', 'annoying', 'person', 'world', 'did', 'mention', 'fat', 'Well', 'apparently', 'pretty', 'important', 'bitch', 'boss', 'stereotype', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'cheating', 'apparent', 'best', 'friend', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'woo', 'hoo', 'life', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'nowhere', 'One', 'day', 'picking', 'up', 'prescription', 'anxiety', 'pills', 'Gibson', 'confronted', 'sexy', 'vixen', 'bit', 'too', 'tough', 'liking', 'go', 'come', 'know', 'Fox', 'Jolie', 'son', 'one', 'greatest', 'assassins', 'ever', 'lived', 'man', 'killed', 'now', 'trying', 'kill', 'Wesley', 'Wesley', 'Father', 'belonged', 'fraternity', 'expert', 'assassins', 'lead', 'Sloan', 'Freeman', 'know', 'awesome', 'right', 'Wrong', 'now', 'Wesley', 'fate', 'join', 'kill', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'then', 'trained', 'fraternity', 'make', 'good', 'enough', 'take', 'man', 'whole', 'plot', 'generally', 'straight', 'forward', 'excuse', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'blood', 'bullets', 'struggling', 'instil', 'sense', 'depth', 'characters', 'straight', 'forward', 'most', 'films', 'days', 'be', 'clever', 'twist', 'end', 'make', 'think', 'enduring', 'whole', 'painful', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'were', 'cool', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'presented', 'usual', 'casual', 'authoritative', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'guff', 'nobody', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'hate', 'say', 'do', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'actress', 'only', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'look', 'bit', 'pretty', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'watching', 'James', 'Macavoy', 'annoyed', 'hell', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'just', 'came', 'depressing', 'annoying', 'screaming', 'did', 'nothing', 'quash', 'hatred.The', 'only', 'genuinely', 'redeeming', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'involved', 'such', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'featured', 'film', 'However', 'even', 'action', 'point', 'times', 'where', 'just', 'find', 'bit', 'exhausting', 'lot', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'few', 'examples', 'not', 'making', 'sense', 'are', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'Dodge', 'Viper', 'trying', 'desperately', 'escape', 'what', 'remember', 'be', 'Dog', 'Food', 'delivery', 'truck', 'Now', 'point', 'Wesley', 'become', 'pretty', 'freaked', 'out', 'shooting', 'so', 'run', 'Fox', 'angered', 'sexy', 'jumps', 'equally', 'sexy', 'mechanical', 'Dodge', 'Viper', 'Wesley', 'car', 'stopping', 'travelling', 'more', '60', 'MPH', 'breaking', 'legs', 'part', 'spine', 'other', 'part', 'simply', 'how', 'Dodge', 'get', 'away', 'truck', 'guess', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'away', 'just', 'saying', 'movie', 'surely', 'makers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'terminator', 'type', 'chase', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'enemy', 'big', 'bad', 'destructive', 'truck', 'victims', 'sexy', 'not', 'too', 'powerful', 'vehicle.Personally', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', ""n't"", 'waste', 'real', 'acting', 'talent', 'then', 'should', 'seriously', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'re"", 'pre-pubescent', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'look', 'pretty', 'women', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'whilst', 'acting', 'then', 'genuinely', 'movie', 'violent', 'bit', 'sexy', 'slightly', 'cool', 'parts', 'film', 'fan', 'think', 'bit', 'depth', 'movie', 'then', 'sincerely', 'something', 'should', 'stay', 'away']",N/A

I came to this conclusion less than ten minutes into the film; it was a scene in which actor David O'Hara jumps through an office-building window and flies 500 feet, crashing through the window of a neighboring building completely unharmed. He then stands on the roof and gets his brains blown out from a bullet fired miles away from him. I knew right then and there that I was allowed to put my brain on autopilot, that I should just sit back, shut up, and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is. Based on the comic book series created by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, ""Wanted"" is so pumped with adrenaline that it races at 200 miles an hour. You can try to make sense of the preposterous story, but why bother? Just watch the movie and don't ask any questions.""Wanted"" tells the story of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), an apathetic accountant manager who hates his job, his boss, his coworkers, his girlfriend, and his life in general. As his voiceover narration tells us, the only thing he cares about is the fact that he doesn't care about anything. He suffers debilitating panic attacks, the kind that slow time to a crawl and magnify images and reduce noises. All he can really do is apologize for everything. But things take an unexpected turn at the pharmacy of a local supermarket: Wesley meets a woman known only as Fox (Angelina Jolie), and she tells him that she knew his father. He tells her that his father abandoned him the week he was born. She claims that his father was one of the world's best assassins, and that the man who killed him is there in the store with them. That marks the beginning of an elaborate shootout scene, one that progresses to a high-octane car chase sequence.Fox takes Wesley to a textile mill that doubles as headquarters for The Fraternity, a centuries-old group of assassins dedicated to stopping the world's most heinous criminals. This is never adequately explained, but never mind. The leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), orders Wesley to shoot the wings off a couple of flies, and to Wesley's astonishment, he's able to do it. How? According to Sloan, Wesley's ""panic attacks"" are actually surges of adrenaline that force him to rely purely on instinct, much like an assassin; with a little training, he can control his mind and become a top notch killer. Once Wesley realizes that everything happening to him is real, he quits his job, but not before cussing out his fat boss and clocking his good-for-nothing best friend across the face with a keyboard. For the first time, he feels alive.But before he can officially join The Fraternity, he must undergo a series of tests ... and by ""tests,"" I mean he must constantly be beaten within an inch of his life and be revived in baths of hard wax. He must also learn how to ""curve"" a bullet, a fancy term for shooting around an obstacle in order for the bullet to hit its target. It's through these scenes that we meet such colorful characters as: The Repairman (Marc Warren), who's guaranteed to ""repair"" you of your bad habits; The Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze), who wields knives as freely as one wields their arms; and The Exterminator (Konstantin Khabensky), who has one of the strangest fascinations with rats a character has ever had (save, maybe, for Willard).Sloan eventually shows Wesley a special loom that somehow or another weaves secret codes into the fabric. How it gets this information and where it comes from and who sends it, I don't presume to ask--all I do know is that Sloan finds the names of The Fraternity's next targets hidden within the fabric. After a few test assassinations, Wesley is finally told to hunt down and kill Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who killed Wesley's father. But in order to find him, Wesley must first find an elusive figure known only as Pekwarsky (Terrence Stamp).I didn't know whether or not I'd get anything out of ""Wanted,"" especially since I haven't read a single issue of the comic series. I didn't even know the series existed until I read the film's end credits. Luckily, the filmmakers sought to entertain a wide audience, not just fans of the comic book; I watched the implausible scenes pass one by one, and yes, I was satisfied with the whole experience. I will not, however, go so far as to say that ""Wanted"" is a masterpiece of stylized action cinema. It's generally fun, but it's also aggressive, silly, and about as mindless as a montage of car explosions. But make no mistake--it's a great visual spectacle, and it moves so quickly through its hour and fifty minutes that the ending comes as somewhat of a shock. That's when the message about living your life to the fullest is made perfectly clear, and why in God's name would I even consider using the word ""message"" within the context of this film?While it's best to not question anything about this movie, I have to admit that Angelina Jolie was a bit of a mystery all throughout. Her character is always cool and collected, and she insists on keeping to The Fraternity's code, although it's not entirely clear why. Even when she reveals her painful past to Wesley, she seems aloof, out of touch, unsympathetic. Analyzing her dialogue won't help much, seeing as she was given no more than twenty lines for the entire film. Be that as it may, I'll recommend ""Wanted"" for all the serious action buffs in need of some great thrills. It delivers exactly what it promises, and no more. Now enough talk.

1196963,A18D0R137EYS6C,B001GKJ2DE,Clinton Enlow,"[2, 2]","Over the summer I saw a lot of movies at the local multiplex. Some I liked some I hated. Then there was something like Wanted which came out to suprise Me with how much I liked. I'm not the biggest fans of the actors, have never read the comic book and only wanted to see the movie after I learned it was the American debut of Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian director of Night Watch and Day Watch. Those films were heavily criticized for being all visual flash and nothing more and I'll admit that for those films and this one Bekmambetov could wind up being a one trick pony who doesn't last long as a filmmaker. But to me his over caffinated visuals are one fo the reasons to see the movie.Like I said I've never read the graphic novel which has its lovers and haters. The movie itself starts off bradly like something akin Fight Club with Wesley Gibson being a nobody with a girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend, an overweight boss who enjoys lording control over him. All of this changes when he meets Fox played by Angelina Jolie who saves him from Cross, the man who killed the father Wesley knew. She takes him to Sloan where He's given an oppurtunity to train to become a super assassin in order to avenge his fathers murder. Along the way He grows a back bone while gaining the super power of being able to ignore the laws of reality.Truthfully I wonder how the film would have turned out if it weren't for Bekmambetov (I'm probably mispelling that but Morgan Freeman admits that it took him three weeks to learn how to pronounce wherein He started refering to him as Beky). I guess it could have been something more standard Bekmambetov throws his all in with all the CGI tricks He can wring from his producers. We have slow motion shots of flies having their wings shot off, people flip cars to assasinate targets while classical music plays in the background and images just warp out into some kind of visual freak show. I can't really describe Bekmambetov's film style without making it sound generic to other Hollywood productions. I mean We've seen lots of slow motion bullet shot but something about Bekmambetov's just looks strangely better than other films.I'm talking about Bekmambetov totally ignoring the actors and the writers. I've never been a diehard James Mcavoy fan but He goes from a goofy guy on autopilot to a pretty good action hero towards the end. And Morgan Freeman is clearly having a fun time as Sloan. I've never really seen him as the evil, amoral type of character however much He tries to play them but here He doesn't over do the acting but does come across as being menacing. For all Her promotion of the film though Angelina Jolie isn't that much of a character in the film never really establishing anything good in her role. Rounding out the cast is Thomas Krestchman as Cross the mostly mute villain, Terence Stamp in a small role as a bulletmaker, and from Night Watch Konstantin Khabensky in one of the better parts as a man raising rats to be bombs.Theres my view on the movie, one I'd definitely call a sleeper hit for me. Months later how is the DVD. I'll say this for Universal in that thankfully their special editions are realtively cheaper than those films like Wall-e or Street Kings which come out costing more than their Blu-Ray counterpart. They put forth good Discs but I'll say Wanted is a bit thin as a Special Edition. Theres no commentary which was bit disappointing or a hour long documentary feature. But the featurettes themselves do come in handy sometimes. Theres an extended scene, the making of the Train action scene, one of those featurettes where everyone says how cool the director is. Rounding things out are featurette on the making of the videogame, a music video of sorts and one of the better features comparing the graphic novel to the film. Really not that much here that was interesting content wise so I'll say for fans of the film it could be a purchase those going for the blind buy should stick with the one disc copy.",4,Wanted,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,4015,"['summer', 'saw', 'lot', 'movies', 'local', 'multiplex', 'liked', 'hated', 'Then', 'was', 'something', 'Wanted', 'came', 'out', 'suprise', 'Me', 'how', 'much', 'liked', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fans', 'actors', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'only', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'learned', 'was', 'American', 'debut', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'Russian', 'director', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Day', 'Watch', 'films', 'were', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'being', 'visual', 'flash', 'nothing', 'more', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'films', 'one', 'Bekmambetov', 'could', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'who', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'filmmaker', 'caffinated', 'visuals', 'are', 'one', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie.Like', 'said', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'lovers', 'haters', 'movie', 'off', 'bradly', 'something', 'akin', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'being', 'nobody', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'best', 'friend', 'overweight', 'boss', 'who', 'lording', 'control', 'changes', 'when', 'Fox', 'played', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'Cross', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'Wesley', 'knew', 'Sloan', 'where', 'given', 'oppurtunity', 'train', 'become', 'super', 'assassin', 'order', 'avenge', 'fathers', 'murder', 'way', 'back', 'bone', 'gaining', 'super', 'power', 'being', 'able', 'ignore', 'laws', 'reality.Truthfully', 'wonder', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'were', ""n't"", 'Bekmambetov', ""'m"", 'probably', 'mispelling', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'took', 'three', 'weeks', 'learn', 'how', 'pronounce', 'wherein', 'started', 'refering', 'Beky', 'guess', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'more', 'standard', 'Bekmambetov', 'CGI', 'tricks', 'can', 'wring', 'producers', 'have', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'flies', 'having', 'wings', 'shot', 'off', 'people', 'flip', 'cars', 'assasinate', 'targets', 'classical', 'music', 'plays', 'background', 'images', 'just', 'warp', 'out', 'kind', 'visual', 'freak', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'describe', 'Bekmambetov', 'film', 'style', 'making', 'sound', 'generic', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'slow', 'motion', 'bullet', 'shot', 'something', 'Bekmambetov', 'just', 'strangely', 'better', 'other', 'films.I', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Bekmambetov', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'actors', 'writers', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'diehard', 'James', 'Mcavoy', 'fan', 'goofy', 'guy', 'autopilot', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'hero', 'end', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'time', 'Sloan', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'evil', 'amoral', 'type', 'character', 'however', 'much', 'play', 'here', ""n't"", 'over', 'do', 'acting', 'come', 'being', 'menacing', 'Her', 'promotion', 'film', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'character', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'establishing', 'anything', 'good', 'role', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Thomas', 'Krestchman', 'Cross', 'mostly', 'mute', 'villain', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'small', 'role', 'bulletmaker', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Konstantin', 'Khabensky', 'one', 'better', 'parts', 'man', 'raising', 'rats', 'be', 'bombs.Theres', 'view', 'movie', 'one', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'call', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Months', 'later', 'how', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Universal', 'thankfully', 'special', 'editions', 'are', 'realtively', 'cheaper', 'films', 'Wall-e', 'Street', 'Kings', 'come', 'out', 'costing', 'more', 'Blu-Ray', 'counterpart', 'put', 'forth', 'good', 'Discs', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Wanted', 'bit', 'thin', 'Special', 'Edition', 'commentary', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'feature', 'featurettes', 'do', 'come', 'handy', 'sometimes', 'extended', 'scene', 'making', 'Train', 'action', 'scene', 'one', 'featurettes', 'where', 'everyone', 'how', 'cool', 'director', 'Rounding', 'things', 'out', 'are', 'featurette', 'making', 'videogame', 'music', 'video', 'sorts', 'one', 'better', 'features', 'comparing', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'Really', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'was', 'interesting', 'content', 'wise', 'so', ""'ll"", 'say', 'fans', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'purchase', 'going', 'blind', 'buy', 'should', 'stick', 'one', 'disc', 'copy']",N/A

The negative reviews of this film are just jealous they did not write, produce, and direct such a cinematic wonder!People want to be more than the sum of their life as a whole, but how many of us step up to become the impossible hero or the unbelievable villain.  This is a fantasy movie that combines all the possibilities of becoming something impossible and then throws that out of the screen and into your lap.  This is not a film to be judged as compared to other films.  It is a film that stands on its own merits - it creates a whole new genre.This is one of Angelina Jolie's best performances to date, because she had to be both superhero and vulnerable woman at the same time.  She (Fox) manages to feign apathy while convincing the audience that she is truly concerned with teaching McAvoy (Wesley) how to be an able-bodied assassin.I've seen some bad reviews of this film, so I went back and watched it again. I don't see anything lacking in the movie after a second viewing.  Morgan Freeman doesn't involve himself with bad scripts...and he certainly did not start with this one!Do yourself a favor, if you don't own Wanted, buy it here and now.

1196970,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001GKJ2DE,DanD,"[3, 4]","There's been this wonderful trend in Hollywood lately: action movies that don't take themselves seriously.  ""Shoot 'em Up"" has been the best so far: a ""ballet of bullets"" (I believe I'm borrowing that from the ""making of"" featurette) that contained quite a few one-liners, and a whole lot of blood and cheesy effects.  ""Wanted"" ups the ante: it's a pure, straight shot of adrenaline right into your heart--a rush of action and effects that is at once horrifyingly cliched and beautifully original.Here's the plot (for those of you paying attention): a mild-mannered accountant finds out he's the son of the world's greatest assassin...and it's up to an unbelievably attractive woman to teach him the ropes, so he can go out in the world and seek his revenge, at the same time saving a fraternity (God I wish they'd used that word a little less!) of professional killers working on the whims of fate.Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, and especially James McAvoy hold the film together; they bring a certain style and charisma to the movie that the film couldn't really do without.  The action is quick and fierce--a bullet here, a bullet there, before you even hear the rapport of gunfire.  There is an iota of depth here (a sort of ""who watches the watchmen"" kinda thing), but it's meant to be an after thought, a bit of background for the action to take place against.

""Wanted"" is that type of film.Wesley Gibson, our protagonist, is an accountant with an anxiety disorder tormented by an overbearing boss, a nagging and unfaithful girlfriend and a buddy who spends more 'recreational' time with his girlfriend that Wesley does.  Entering suddenly into his unbearable life is the mysterious and appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie), a woman who saves Gibson's life from a killer and explains to him that she knew his father, who is now dead.  She takes the bewildered young man to Sloan (Morgan Freeman), her superior, and her cohorts, a group of elite killers called 'the fraternity' of which Gibson's father belonged to.  With Fox as his mentor, Wesley is trained to become his father's predecessor and take out the man who murdered him.Russian director, Timur Bekmambetov, revs up the intensity from the beginning of the movie and never lets up.  He has an amazing eye for action sequences and truly takes the viewers for a fun-filled rollercoaster ride.  McAvoy does a good job as the accountant-turned-killer trying to deal with the abrupt change in his life and the new role that destiny offers him.  Jolie, as usual, captivates the screen, vamping it up in the kind of role she is well suited for.  Morgan Freeman, too, delivers the goods as the mastermind behind the fraternity.  While the movie is not perfect, this kind of film really isn't meant to be.  I will say, however, that one sequence (which I won't give away) is bound to infuriate animal activists---when Wesley uses a trojan horse type of secret weapon to surprise the bad buys.  It wouldn't surprise me to hear some protests of the film because of this scene and I will admit that is one aspect of the story I could have done without.""Wanted"" is a summer popcorn movie, intended to entertain instead of provoke thought.  So, take some friends, kick back and enjoy the sheer velocity of the film.  Recommend for those who enjoy high speed action...however, there is a good deal of blood and violence.

You need to do a bit more than the usual ""suspension of disbelief"" here. If you can accept this movie's ideas such as bullets that can curve around objects (there's more than 1 ""magic bullet"" here...) then you'll enjoy it. I don't know how they did the effects and stunts, but they are some of the most entertaining action scenes I've seen. Sequences such as one where a car jumps off another car to spin over a third car are enough to make you go ""wow"".There's more to the movie than just action. The story is fairly interesting, centering around a secret society of assassins who are supposedly working to maintain order in the world. James McAvoy's character Wesley is one whom many people will be able to identify with - stuck in a boring cubicle job with a boss he hates, a girlfriend who holds him in contempt, and a ""best friend"" with whom the girlfriend is cheating. Clearly, he's more than a little unsatisfied with his life so he soon jumps at the chance of a completely different life when the assassin Fox (Angelina Jolie) springs into his life. He soon meets the head of the assassins, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who tells him all about his father, an assassin who was recently killed by a rogue member. Wesley then trains to become an assassin to go after his father's killer. The movie also has the prerequisite plot twist in addition to the many car chase and fight scenes and explosive final confrontation.The acting by McAvoy, Jolie, and Freeman is very good, as you would expect from those of their caliber; however, the best part about the movie is the action sequences. With special effects reminiscent of ""The Matrix"", the action can be unrealistic at times but never disappoints. There's never a dull moment.

Just enjoy the action packed ride of stunts and special effects! The action is way over the top, but is very stylishly done. There are a lot of slow motion effects (and speeded up effects too!), scenes that go in reverse, bullet skin-piercing close-ups and car stunts that clearly look impossible, but are nevertheless still fun to watch! Great DVD to own and I think it could be enjoyed with repeated viewings!Rather than go over the plot and film details as many other reviewers have, I just ""wanted"" point out the features for the two-disc DVD set. If you live near Target their two-disc DVD set or Blue-Ray set contains a Target exclusive 22-page booklet with production notes and photos. Very nice to have!The bonus disc of ""Wanted"" has nearly 90 minutes of special features. A digital copy of the movie is included that you can download to your PC, I-pod or other video player. There is one extended scene (not deleted) when Wesley Gibson is shooting at the three dead corpses that is actually kind of humorous to watch, but only adds about two minutes to the film. The other featurettes are called; ""Cast & Characters"", ""Stunts on the L Train"", ""Special Effects: The Art of the Impossible"", ""Groundbreaking Visual Effects: From Imagination to Execution"", ""Origins of Wanted: Bringing the Graphic Novel to Life"", ""Through the Eyes of Director Timur Bekmamvetov"", ""Making of Wanted the Video Game"", eight scenes from the comic book with narration (very interesting!) and a music video for the Danny Elfman song ""The Little Things"".Unfortunately there is no commentary for the feature film, but the numerous featurettes range from approximately 2 minutes (L Train Stunts) to 10 or 20 minutes for the remaining featurettes, so there is a lot of extra content to see. Most of the featurettes are your standard cast, crew interviews with your standard behind the scenes footage and film footage. Most of the stunts are done with the actual actors/actresses fitted with harnesses and green-screen backgrounds.  Very interesting to see the car flipping and the train under the bridge stunts!I found the comic book narration very interesting to watch and to see how different or similar the movie compared to the comic book adaptation. For example, the female assassin ""Fox"" (played by Angelina Jolie) was originally conceived as an African-American female. If you are into the video game of ""Wanted"", some special codes pop up on the screen after you watch two of the featurettes on the bonus disc. I think the codes give your video game character better life or killing modes, but I'm not exactly sure since I don't have a copy of the game myself. Overall, this is a good two-disc set to have. I still wish there could have been a commentary track, but the numerous special features on the second disc kind of make up for it.

Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond extreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination.

So that explains all the utter gravity-defying nonsense and stupidity.  Thing is, this film really had me hooked as James McAvoy narrates over images of his ho-hum life as a Chicago accountant with a surly girlfriend, a backstabbing best bud, and a size XXXXXL boss who likes to snap a stapler in people's faces.  Yeah, perfectly dreadful, and McAvoy delivers with a tongue-in-cheek ""whoa is me"" style that had me craving to know more. . .until Angelina Jolie swoops in like a cartoon character and this flick loses rational control faster than flatulence at a bean diner.Turns out McAvoy's character is the son of the Ultimate Assassin, member of a proud ""fraternity"" of assassins presided over by a smug Morgan Freeman--the same Freeman who doubles during the day as an executive for a textile factory (in a castle, of course) sporting a meat locker (no, I'm not making any of this up, trust me).  McAvoy's father has just been killed--and his killer is now tracking McAvoy (egads!).  Or is he?  Or do we care?  So McAvoy decides he's had enough living as a doormat and will fulfill his destiny by following in his father's footsteps.  His training is laughable, but is supervised by a dour Jolie who every once in awhile at least gives us the courtesy of taking off her clothes.  Then out into the world McAvoy's character goes, bending bullets with his mind and leaping trains and ledges and whatnot like you and I stepping onto a curb.  There's a circle-of-death kill scene as climax that had me laughing uncontrollably, but in truth, the special effects are fun to watch, the gore is really gory, and Angelina would look good wearing army boots reading a phone book, so WANTED is worth a look-see.

""Wanted"" is fun. First of all, it employs a serious arsenal of mega-watt talent: Charming and adorable James McAvoy, the always-seductive Angelina Jolie back in sexy bad-ass mode, and the reassuring and paternal Morgan Freeman. Second, it's full of state-of-the-art action and special affects, which has caused the (unwarranted, sadly) comparisons to the original ""Matrix"" film. And third, there is an entertaining (but forgettable) storyline involving assassins and a secret society.Once you get past all the sexy fun, the film is, sadly, hollow. The central premise of the film seems to be that working in an office makes you a sad loser. When we're living in a time when unemployment is in the double digits and people with college degrees are flipping burgers to make ends meet, this is an insulting thesis. The film also proposes that violence = empowerment. The central character, after being trained to be an assassin, becomes self-assured and sexy.

It borrows heavily from the stylish violence of ""The Matrix"" and the mysticism of, say, ""The Order,"" and keeps you guessing right down to the last scene.As the movie opens, a loser Chicago accountant named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy in a stunning change of pace from ""Atonement"" and ""Becoming Jane"") gets stepped on by everyone in his life, from his nasty boss to his cheating girlfriend and exploitative best buddy.  In a drug store to buy his anxiety medicine, Wesley is saved from a mysterious assassin by a woman of unusual talents named Fox (Angela Jolie in steely-eyed mode).  The ensuing chase sequence will leave the viewer breathless and introduce Wesley to The Fraternity, whose members kill that others may live.  The Fraternity is directed by the elderly Sloane (Morgan Freeman in wiseman mode) whose privilege it is to read the names of targets out of flaws in woven cloth (just go with it). Wesley is invited to join The Fraternity.  After a joyous day burning personal bridges, Wesley takes Sloane up on his offer.Initiation into The Fraternity involves some incredibly vicious and seemingly impossible training, much of it designed to make Wesley realize his identity and understand his motivation.  Wesley discovers he can manipulate his own andrenaline levels, allowing him to do things in ways unknown to ordinary mortals.  He learns that The Fraternity is under siege from a rogue assassin named Cross.  Finally, he is told that Cross is the killer of his own long-missing father.Wesley progresses rapidly from training to his first missions to the big job, going after Cross in a monastery in Eastern Europe.  The job doesn't turn out quite the way Wesley expects, setting the scene for a series of unsettling betrayals and thrilling confrontations right down to a conclusion back in Wesley's old office.""Wanted"" is pure escapism; viewers are advised to sit back and enjoy the ride.

He suffers from what he thinks are panic, headache-like attacks whenever he's provoked. Then one day he finds out through a mysterious woman (Angelina Jolie, who seems a little too old to play this Lara Croft look-a-like at this point) that he's the son of a former gone-rogue member of an elite group of assassins called Fraternity, who have special abilities of quick reflexes and healing powers. Brought in by the groups leader (Morgan Freeman collecting one Hell of a paycheck here), he's told of his past, very quickly trained in a variety of wild and unbelievable murderous ways, and is sent on a mission to use his new sharpshooter skills to kill the man that murdered his father. But is the team he's on the good guys or not?Good question. Wanted is a fun but highly unbelievable story featuring some crazy CGI-filled stunts that base the movie in the fact that you can shoot a bullet like a MLB curve-ball. Cars are flying all over the place, trains are derailing with good guys barely getting a scratch, and heroes getting stabbed in the hand and sharp-shooting perfectly the next. In fact, if this movie reminded me of anything, take all of the Sci-Fi aspects of the first Matrix film, smarten-up Keanu a bit, and you have the first hour of Wanted to a tee. This definitely is one of those ""leave your logic at the door"" type of over-the-top films. But unlike the previous years ""Shoot 'Em Up"", this one will have you groan the phrase ""Oh, c'mon on"", than say it with glee. At times it's well-placed humor is put interestingly, but overall it's hard to believe plot and impossible in the real world stunts might be too much to fully keep you in the movie.Concerning the single-disc edition, I can barely suggest it as an informative rental, much less a purchase. The SD picture and audio do live up to those standards, but outside of 6 minutes of start-up trailers (which can't be chosen afterwards), this disc has nothing but movie. But the movie does have alot of eye-candy in it, and will keep you entertained, but you gotta wonder, if your shirt had a few misstitching in it, is it trying to tell you a code to kill a certain person? No I didn't think so.Pros:*Alot of wacky, cool car chases and bullet travels in this movie,but really it's a bit too much to be believed.*James McAvoy proves you don't have to be Shia LaBeouf to play a 20-something in the wrong place at the wrong time in 00's movies.*If you're a fan of Freeman and Jolie, well.....they're in this movie. Just think how they laughed all the way to the bank on this one.Cons:*The ""Oh, C'mon!"" factor is very high here.*The ending, though at times clever, makes you think these guys take their job way too seriously.*Though she's only five years older than McAvoy in real life, seeing these two kiss makes you hum the rock classic ""Hot For Teacher"".

1197005,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B001GKJ2DE,Eric L. Willard,"[0, 1]","I had seen reviews and trailers for this for so long but just didn't feel like seeing it. I then was in the local PC store and saw a $9 copy of it. I thought, ""I guess I can spare the $$ for it."". This is the feeling I had about the film before watching it, while watching it and after watching it. Just..sort of, mediocre.While watching this, you have to keep in mind, it is all over-the-top or exagerated.Acting:The characters are original, and it seemed the actors really put some effort into making it worth the $$. Have you ever seen a movie where you thought, ""These actors just don't care.""? (Aragon) This was not the case here.Story:Small spoiler: The basic story is that the main character's father was killed and they hint that he may have been a traitor (or the traitor killed him) and the son is brought into the assassin guild to get revenge. As the son is learning to be the assassin his father was (WOW in a short 6 weeks?), he is given all the tools and chances to find the evidence he needs. The father deserted the family when the son was only 1 week old. When he finds the traitor, the reasons for his actions just seemed like a ""we've seen this all before"" feeling.Not the most original story plot but you get the point.Effects:This is where I just felt that we are spit in the face and then the makers said, ""Thanks for your $$"". Many of the driving scenes and especially the train scene were so exagerated and unrealistic that I felt insulted. Everyone knows the smallest accident can make a car undrivable. These cars are shot up, flipped and wrecked and the people still drive them away like nothing happened. Where were the cops in all these chases and shootouts? There was only one scene were cops were involved and they just stood around while a car flipped over their blockade and then drove away??!!Spoiler: The main character says in the movie how he is against just killing someone because he is told to (it's fate) and he has a respect for human life but..The train scene showed us the main character had no care for all the innocent people killed in the train crash due to his actions. Also, if an assassin is right next to you and has the chance to kill you, they would NOT shoot the glass out around you. They would just shoot you dead right there.The bullet bending: Although this is possible to do, and was a cool effect, it is done to the extreme so far that it is just impossible and unbelievable.

Yes, it sounds far-fetched, but the action and the plot are simply best-in-class.Cross, a sharp-shooter is after Wesley Gibson and Angelina Jolie saves him, preventing his death.

There is great damage done to his body as he trains, but they are submerged into a substance that repairs wounds and bruises at the speed of light. Through this daily routine, Wesley Gibson transforms into a mean... lean... killing machine!The leader of the fraternity is Sloan, played with the superb style of Morgan Freeman and as the plot develops we learn the danger of great power and how it can corrupt those who possess absolute power.The climax is unforgettable, we were not expecting it, and the action is so amazing that rarely were we able to stop the excitement experienced while watching this amazing film.

Villasor ""tedi31""","[1, 1]","""You're just a thug that can bend bullets."" - Wesley Allan GibsonTwenty-four year old overly apologetic Wesley Allan Gibson (James McAvoy) lives an insignificant life. One filled with a pompous best friend (Barry; Chris Pratt), a conniving girlfriend (Cathy, Kristen Hager), an egotistical boss (Janice, Lorna Scott), anti-anxiety medication to last Gibson till the 22nd century, and zero hits on Goggle search strings with his name on it.But that all changed when he met a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) as well as her associates aptly named The Repairman (Marc Warren), The Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze), The Gunsmith (Common), The Russian Exterminator, and Sloan (Morgan Freeman). Gibson is fed the story that he is the offspring of Mr. X, an eminent assassin who works for a 1000 year-old collective known as The Fraternity. Sloan adds that Mr. X was shot down in cold blood by a rouge Fraternity agent called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann).Gibson is aggressively trained by Fox (and at times senselessly) in order to build his pain tolerance, proficiency in both close quarter combat situations as well as range weapons, and his genetic gift--the ability to rapidly increase his heart rat ""at an excess of 400 beats per minute thus sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into his bloodstream""--thereby giving him the ability to see and do things that ordinary people could only attempt to comprehend.At the completion of his six-week training, Gibson is accepted into The Fraternity and sent out on several assassination missions before being given the blessing by Sloan to pursue Cross.Gibson journeys to Europe--the birthplace of The Fraternity--and interrogates Pekwarsky (Terence Stamp who's past iconic roles included: General Zod (Superman I & II), Sir Larry Wildman (Wall Street) and Supreme Chancellor Valorum (Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace)) who manufactured the ammunition of Cross. Pekwarsky is coerced to set up a ""meeting"" with Cross which leads to Gibson and Cross locking horns aboard a bullet train.Fox intervenes by boarding the aforementioned train with an automobile that eventual contributes to the derailing of the locomotive. In the process, Gibson is able to avenge his father's death by killing Cross--but not before he is able to disclose that he in fact is Gibson's true father. Fox confirms Cross' admission and proceeds to execute Gibson--who manages to escape by shattering the tempered glass window where he and Cross were situated.Pekwarsky rescues Gibson and nurses him back to health with the help of a ""miracle wax"" that stimulates the body's white blood cells, which accelerates the healing process to a matter of days for injuries that would normally take months to heal. Pekwarsky then shows Gibson proof of his father's love for him and his wish that his son live a normal life away from The Fraternity.Pekwarsky also passes on information (via a loom weaving, that when decoded contains the name of an assassins target) that Sloan has been earmarked for termination for quite some time. But instead to fulfilling the code of The Fraternity, Sloan had taken it upon himself to fabricate other targets for his own personal gain. It was also established that this was primarily the reason why Cross went rouge.The climactic ending takes a page out of Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium, (a 2002 futuristic science fiction film starring Christian Bale (Batman Begins; The Dark Knight)) wherein Gibson infiltrates The Fraternity's base of operations--an unassuming Textile Factory--and begins to detonate as well as shoot anything and everyone from every conceivable angle.In the end, Gibson is able to expose Sloan to Fox, The Gunsmith, and several other Fraternity members. But Sloan counters by revealing that ""everyone in this room"" has been earmarked for termination and that if they were going to stand by Gibson's accusations--they should first turn their own weapons on themselves.As Sloan escapes, Fox complies with her mandate and fires a miracle bullet (this really reminded me of The Warren Commission's theory of a single ""magic bullet"" in the John F. Kennedy assassination), which effectively kills everyone in the room except Gibson.Bruised, battered, penniless, and bloodied; Gibson realizes that he has to start out fresh in another accounting job. It is here where Sloan hopes to seek retribution--but not before being set up by Gibson.Wanted, which was loosely based on work of creators (and executive producers) Mark Millar (The Ultimates, The Ultimates 2, and Wanted) J. G. Jones (Art on Brian K. Vaughan's Y: The Last Man, 52, and Wanted) also provided cinemagoers with a several thought provoking questions: Have you ever wanted to be just ordinary? And my personal favorite in regards to one taking control of their life--what have you done lately?With that said, it then brings a whole new meaning to: ""So, can YOU curve the bullet?""",4,So can

It's bloody, it's profane, and it could be the best man's movie since the Die Hard series. Wesley Gibson starts out as a wimp with a pathetic life only to be swept in a strange fraternity of assassins, in which the training is incredibly brutal and painful. The reasons as to why, and what follows bring a couple of out-of-nowhere plot twists that wrap together a simple but surprising story. And unlike the Matrix, there isn't any grim future, and it's not as weird.But the main draw is the action, which is intense as it is brutal, and at times it's stunning, if not jaw-dropping. The cast also does a great job as relative newcomer James McAvoy makes a good action star, Angelina Jolie returns to the action genre, providing several curves for the movie's delight, and Morgan Freeman also pops up in another surprisingly good role for the legend.

Very strange! It was kinda billed as an action movie, but after watching for a while, I considered it to be an action comedy, and it was funny in a strange and twisted way.The movie was centered about ""The Fraternity,"" a thousand-year-old secret organization that was oriented toward righting wrong-doings by killing the perpetrators, or keeping the gene-pool clean so to speak. A modern wimp (James McAvoy) was added to the force, which his father had been in, and was given extensive training to complete his assigned tasks. It was brutal, but it was also funny. If you're the kind of viewer that likes to laugh at blood and gore, then you'll probably like this movie as it is very violent. If you don't care for this type of thing, then it would be best to stay away. It's rated ""R"" and it earned the rating.The acting was quite good and I especially liked Angelina Jolie. Not only was she good looking but she could really kick kiester. Gracious! The story was completely frivolous, but it held my attention because it was so unrealistic and funny. The movie is action, action, action with no dull breaks or no time to stop and think about the absurdity you were watching.Do you like special effects? Well, this movie is just overloaded with them. Do you like bullets that go around corners to strike their targets? Enjoy! You're going to be wondering how they ever did these things, but you don't have time to figure it out. Do you like really spectacular train wrecks? Well, there's one in here that's the most spectacular that i've ever seen. Trust me. I just have no idea how they'd ever do it.

One of the supervillians wanted to come out of hidding instead of ruling behind the scenes because the portion of the world he received wasnt that profitable.

1197033,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001GKJ2DE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 5]","Very loosely based on Mark Millar and JG Jones' gritty comic book mini-series, WANTED tells of Wesley Gibson's transformation from pathetic cubicle rat to astounding super-assassin. Angelina Jolie (looking predictably sexylicious) plays the mysterious Fox, who helps recruit Wesley into the Fraternity, a one-thousand-year-old, very select brotherhood of assassins.It seems that Wesley, prone to crippling anxiety attacks, is the son of a master assassin and that he has inherited his father's supernormal aptitude for killing. Wesley's attacks aren't really caused by anxiety. Rather, those are the moments when his senses go into overdrive, when his heart pulsates to an excess of four hundred beats per minute and his perception and reflexes are boosted to extraordinary levels. In such a state, Wesley can accomplish wondrous things, not the least of which is shooting the wings off a fly. This, he demonstrates (very much to his surprise) at the behest of Sloan, the Fraternity leader.Gone over to the dark side (but he prefers to think of it as freeing himself from the shackles of mediocrity), Wesley quickly enough signs on with the Fraternity (where each member shares his talents). A key incentive is that the secretive group numbered his father as a member. And learning that his father was murdered by a rogue Fraternity agent, Wesley is determined to avenge him. But, first things first. Wesley is subjected to a brutal training regimen; then he has to prove himself. So he's assigned a target. And then another...WANTED may have ended up veering off the original source by a ways, but it does stay true in one sense: this film is just about the opposite of a superhero flick. Going against the superhero grain was a goal which Mark Millar and JG Jones successfully pulled off in their comic book series. This movie is nasty and pessimistic and dark, and plenty of things are unbelievable about it. But so what? It's also damn entertaining, right from the adrenalin-pumping opening sequence. The protagonists (Wesley and Fox) aren't really ""good guys."" The Fraternity to which they belong does come up with a reason-to-be for its existence (some mumbo-jumbo about these folks being ""necessity's assassins,"" eliminating targets presented by Fate to balance the world). It's a fairly nebulous reason, and the Loom of Fate does come off as a silly contrivance (""Do you make sweaters or do you kill people?"").I wouldn't go so far as to call the violence visceral, but there are some pretty brutal scenes here, as when Wesley is being ""instructed"" by the Butcher and the Repairman. I would call the action sequences breathtaking and spectacular and stylized. And is there anything cooler than a curving bullet?The cast is top-notch. Angelina Jolie is an actress who can really act, but who truly shines in these action roles. She just brings that attitude and charisma. As Fox, Jolie is mean and vicious and glorious. The girl simply does her thing with style. And, oh, that wicked smile. James McAvoy displays a flawless American accent and is pretty good. I've always thought there's a realness to this guy, from the moment I saw him in a supporting role in WIMBLEDON, and this grounding quality of his comes in handy when portraying Wesley's remarkable transformation. Then there's Morgan Freeman, lending calm gravitas to the screen even as he embarks into a more sinister realm with his character Sloan. I don't think I've ever heard Morgan Freeman cussing before.I did like the first half slightly better than the second. It fascinated me, watching Wesley develop from a bullied weakling to a confident smiter of dudes. I guess I got off on the little revenge moments, as when he gets his back from his cheating girlfriend and his erstwhile best friend. Wesley's rant against his fat supervisor, though, may have been too mean.So the cool premise gets to you. The very implausible story draws you in. But WANTED, above all else, is a wicked visual treat, an ideal, over-the-top summer flick. Me, I soaked in the attitude, marveled at the sheer audacity of it all. And, damn, if I'm not in love with Angelina Jolie, all over again. I wouldn't say no to a sequel.",4,"""Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing when you have the blood of a killer.""",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,4175,"['Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'JG', 'Jones', 'gritty', 'comic', 'book', 'mini-series', 'WANTED', 'tells', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'transformation', 'pathetic', 'cubicle', 'rat', 'astounding', 'super-assassin', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'looking', 'predictably', 'sexylicious', 'mysterious', 'Fox', 'who', 'recruit', 'Wesley', 'Fraternity', 'one-thousand-year-old', 'very', 'select', 'brotherhood', 'assassins.It', 'Wesley', 'prone', 'crippling', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'son', 'master', 'assassin', 'inherited', 'father', 'supernormal', 'aptitude', 'killing', 'Wesley', 'attacks', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'caused', 'anxiety', 'Rather', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'senses', 'go', 'overdrive', 'when', 'heart', 'excess', 'four', 'hundred', 'beats', 'minute', 'perception', 'reflexes', 'are', 'boosted', 'extraordinary', 'levels', 'such', 'state', 'Wesley', 'can', 'accomplish', 'wondrous', 'things', 'not', 'least', 'shooting', 'wings', 'off', 'fly', 'very', 'much', 'surprise', 'behest', 'Sloan', 'Fraternity', 'leader.Gone', 'dark', 'side', 'think', 'freeing', 'shackles', 'mediocrity', 'Wesley', 'quickly', 'enough', 'signs', 'Fraternity', 'where', 'member', 'shares', 'talents', 'key', 'incentive', 'secretive', 'group', 'numbered', 'father', 'member', 'learning', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'rogue', 'Fraternity', 'agent', 'Wesley', 'determined', 'avenge', 'first', 'things', 'first', 'Wesley', 'subjected', 'brutal', 'training', 'regimen', 'then', 'prove', 'assigned', 'target', 'then', 'WANTED', 'may', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'veering', 'off', 'original', 'source', 'ways', 'stay', 'true', 'one', 'sense', 'film', 'just', 'opposite', 'superhero', 'flick', 'Going', 'superhero', 'grain', 'was', 'goal', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'JG', 'Jones', 'successfully', 'pulled', 'off', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'nasty', 'pessimistic', 'dark', 'plenty', 'things', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'so', 'what', 'also', 'damn', 'entertaining', 'right', 'adrenalin-pumping', 'opening', 'sequence', 'protagonists', 'Wesley', 'Fox', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'guys', 'Fraternity', 'belong', 'come', 'up', 'reason-to-be', 'existence', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'folks', 'being', 'necessity', 'assassins', 'eliminating', 'targets', 'presented', 'Fate', 'balance', 'world', 'fairly', 'nebulous', 'reason', 'Loom', 'Fate', 'come', 'off', 'silly', 'contrivance', 'Do', 'make', 'sweaters', 'do', 'kill', 'people', '.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'violence', 'visceral', 'are', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'here', 'when', 'Wesley', 'being', 'instructed', 'Butcher', 'Repairman', 'would', 'call', 'action', 'breathtaking', 'spectacular', 'stylized', 'there', 'anything', 'cooler', 'curving', 'bullet', 'cast', 'top-notch', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'who', 'truly', 'shines', 'action', 'roles', 'just', 'attitude', 'charisma', 'Fox', 'Jolie', 'mean', 'vicious', 'glorious', 'girl', 'simply', 'thing', 'style', 'oh', 'wicked', 'smile', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'flawless', 'American', 'accent', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'realness', 'guy', 'moment', 'saw', 'supporting', 'role', 'WIMBLEDON', 'grounding', 'quality', 'handy', 'when', 'portraying', 'Wesley', 'remarkable', 'transformation', 'Then', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'lending', 'calm', 'gravitas', 'screen', 'even', 'more', 'sinister', 'realm', 'character', 'Sloan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'cussing', 'before.I', 'did', 'first', 'half', 'slightly', 'better', 'second', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'Wesley', 'develop', 'bullied', 'weakling', 'confident', 'smiter', 'dudes', 'guess', 'got', 'off', 'little', 'revenge', 'moments', 'when', 'back', 'cheating', 'girlfriend', 'erstwhile', 'best', 'friend', 'Wesley', 'rant', 'fat', 'supervisor', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'mean.So', 'cool', 'premise', 'very', 'implausible', 'story', 'draws', 'WANTED', 'else', 'wicked', 'visual', 'treat', 'ideal', 'over-the-top', 'summer', 'flick', 'Me', 'soaked', 'attitude', 'marveled', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'damn', ""'m"", 'not', 'love', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'all', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'sequel']",N/A

'Wanted' is (loosely) based on a series of comic books, so if you're complaining that bullets going around corners and heroes surviving hundred metre falls is not ""realistic""....you're kind of missing the point. This is pure, brainless escapism. Turn off your brain for two hours, sit back, and enjoy the eye candy. It's that kind of movie.'Wanted' shamelessly pinches ideas from a variety of other movies. The first act is very reminiscent of 'Fight Club' (worthless corporate drone seeing no meaning to his life), and the CGI obviously owes a huge debt to 'The Matrix' and its clones. The physics-defying stunts and special effects ape everything from 'Transporter' to 'Gone In 60 Seconds'. Although I must admit that making the Fraternity descendents of weavers, who get their orders from codes embedded in a textile loom, is..um...different.The cast is a mixed bag; James McAvoy really nails it as the depressed office worker, but as a ruthless assassin he's a bit underwhelming. Angelina Jolie does a good job in a role that doesn't take her out of second gear, and Morgan Freeman does the father-figure thing just like Morgan always does. Everyone else is simply a cannon-fodder or gun-for-hire stock character, although Thomas Kretschmann as Cross could have been interesting had he been given more screen time. Don't worry too much about the plot; it's predictable, with several ""twists"" and character revelations that are easily anticipated. This is the sort of movie where every line of dialogue is a distraction from the flashy eye-candy.The eye-candy itself is good, though. Extensive use of slo-mo and bullet-cam effects, cars doing triple flips and driving on as if nothing happened, trains falling off bridges, assassins shooting through ten people at once...it's all here. And it all works. If you're in the right mood.It's not really a movie I'd recommend as such, and it's certainly not an artistic masterpiece.

1197047,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001GKJ2DE,Jason,"[0, 0]","The widely seen preview of this movie has people flicking their arms and wrists around while firing a pistol, and causing a bullet to curve.  Many will question the physics of this, but somehow fail to mention the fact that a curve ball DOES curve (The Physics of Baseball (3rd Edition)).  With that in mind, just suspend disbelief a little and enjoy the ride.Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a mild-mannered accountant who has the propensity for panic attacks.  When his hideous boss - think Lucille Ball mating with a sperm whale and ending up with Gilbert Gottfried's voice - gets on his case, he can hardly breathe.  His heart is in his throat, his pulse pounds, and he is the definition of a nervous wreck.  In a monotonous monologue, he makes it painfully clear that he despises his life.  While picking up his pills at the pharmacy, probably Zoloft, he meets the person who will twist his mind, body, and bullets: an assassin named Fox (Angelina Jolie - who did the same thing to Brad Pitt).  But first Fox has to get Gibson out of the pharmacy, which happens to be the same place another assassin, Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), is picking up some groceries.In a matter of no time he meets Sloan (Morgan Freeman), the head of ""The Fraternity"", an assassin association.  Soon he's training Neo-style, learning how to do other-wordly things like shooting wings off flies, and of course, the perpetual bullet curving.  McAvoy nails the character from beginning to end, almost opposite of Shia Lebouf's failure inTransformers.  Every single actor turns in a great performance, but the action and special effects outshine them all.From beginning to end there is nearly unparalleled, surreal action - it rivals that of the Matrix series.  It's not really as deep as is supposed to be; it's basically adults with super powers.  Mixed in with some awesome gun play, great car scenes, and a fat Hispanic guy who handles knives better than Steven Seagal.  I didn't really like the ""surprise"" ending, but that's the only major downfall and drops it down a star.

""Wanted"" maybe filled with plot holes as big as Jupiter but at least they made it up in the area of visual style served with a side action. You've probably met a person like Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) who is a nobody trapped in a boring world. Whose girlfriend cheats on him, his best friend is a backstabber, and he has a boss that won't get off his back. No...maybe...Well later in the film an assassin named Fox (Jolie) tries to initiate him into the Fraternity, his life is changed forever. He learns that his father was one of the best assassins in the world, and he must no walk in his footsteps. He leaves his nothing life and joins the Fraternity. He must undergo a grueling initiation, and then hunt down the man that killed his father.`Wanted' has decent character development along with a good plot. It is structured well, with Wesley not being able to turn back after Act 1, and a great setup for the climax after Act 2. There is even symbolism in the movie with a draw bridge coming apart. It symbolized the end of Wesley's old life. There are many obstacles put in Wesley's path of killing Cross. The screenwriter made sure that becoming a Fraternity member wasn't an easy challenge. There is a great twist in the middle of the movie, which made the movie way better. The ending is very entertaining. It starts off with a big bang that was planted since the beginning of Wesley's life with the Fraternity. One problem was that the action was either overdone or illogical in parts. In one scene, Wesley hits a man with a keyboard, and letters fly off spelling a phrase I'm not aloud to repeat.`Wanted' has a very good director and I had seen his previous films but a mild fan of them. It was a smart choice to pick a foreign director to get a new perspective on things in regards to the lighting and the settings. For example, Wesley's apartment being next to a train is a good setting because it bleak and it shows how sad his life is and foreshadows later events. The office is a good place to show how average his life is and the textile mill seems true to what the Fraternity is about. The acting is good and expected by others such as Morgan Freeman who is always a good actor, although I would like to see him in a different role time to time. James McAvoy played a great lead, reminiscent Edward Norton in Fight Club. We have Angelina, who has less line than the boss, so that makes me consider she was placed there for her fame and beauty. Even though she was the weakest of the group she was still believable and had worse material to work with. The minor actors, like Wesley's best friend did a good job as well.Aside from that it instantly forgettable stuff but if you're looking for something noisy and totally undemanding then this would fit that bill.",4,3.5--This movie is far fetched & little bizarre but that's the beauty of it!,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,2833,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'mindless', 'campy', 'reeks', 'fun', 'Wanted', 'maybe', 'filled', 'plot', 'holes', 'as', 'big', 'Jupiter', 'least', 'made', 'up', 'area', 'visual', 'style', 'served', 'side', 'action', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'met', 'person', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'nobody', 'trapped', 'boring', 'world', 'Whose', 'girlfriend', 'cheats', 'best', 'friend', 'backstabber', 'boss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'back', 'maybe', 'Well', 'later', 'film', 'assassin', 'named', 'Fox', 'Jolie', 'initiate', 'Fraternity', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'assassins', 'world', 'must', 'walk', 'footsteps', 'nothing', 'life', 'Fraternity', 'must', 'undergo', 'grueling', 'initiation', 'then', 'hunt', 'down', 'man', 'killed', 'father.', 'Wanted', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'plot', 'structured', 'well', 'Wesley', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'turn', 'back', 'Act', '1', 'great', 'setup', 'climax', 'Act', '2', 'even', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'draw', 'bridge', 'coming', 'apart', 'symbolized', 'end', 'Wesley', 'old', 'life', 'are', 'many', 'obstacles', 'put', 'Wesley', 'path', 'killing', 'Cross', 'screenwriter', 'made', 'sure', 'becoming', 'Fraternity', 'member', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'challenge', 'great', 'twist', 'middle', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'way', 'better', 'ending', 'very', 'entertaining', 'big', 'bang', 'was', 'planted', 'beginning', 'Wesley', 'life', 'Fraternity', 'One', 'problem', 'was', 'action', 'was', 'overdone', 'illogical', 'parts', 'one', 'scene', 'Wesley', 'man', 'keyboard', 'letters', 'fly', 'spelling', 'phrase', ""'m"", 'not', 'aloud', 'repeat.', 'Wanted', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'mild', 'fan', 'was', 'smart', 'choice', 'pick', 'foreign', 'director', 'get', 'new', 'perspective', 'things', 'regards', 'lighting', 'settings', 'example', 'Wesley', 'apartment', 'being', 'next', 'train', 'good', 'setting', 'how', 'sad', 'life', 'later', 'events', 'office', 'good', 'place', 'show', 'how', 'average', 'life', 'textile', 'mill', 'true', 'what', 'Fraternity', 'about', 'acting', 'good', 'expected', 'others', 'such', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'actor', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'different', 'role', 'time', 'time', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'played', 'great', 'lead', 'reminiscent', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Fight', 'Club', 'have', 'Angelina', 'who', 'less', 'line', 'boss', 'consider', 'was', 'placed', 'there', 'fame', 'beauty', 'Even', 'was', 'weakest', 'group', 'was', 'still', 'believable', 'had', 'worse', 'material', 'work', 'minor', 'actors', 'Wesley', 'best', 'friend', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'well.Aside', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'noisy', 'totally', 'undemanding', 'then', 'would', 'fit', 'bill']",N/A

He's got a crappy job, a fat evil beeyotch of a boss, a cheating girlfriend and a two-timing best friend.  In fact, change a vowel and this guy's name would be Wussley.  It totally fits  him.  Poor Wesley is so at a loss to find an identity that he googles his own name and almost falls apart when nothing turns up.So one dark dreary night, Wesley ambles into a convenience store.  Typical of Wesley to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Fate or coincidence?  Next thing Wesley knows, he's being shot at by a robot-like assassin named Cross and rescued by a drop-dead-gorgeous woman named Fox.  The resulting car chase is a doozy.  Fox takes Wesley to a decripit old factory on the edge of town which turns out to be the headquarters of the Fraternity, a thousand-year-old society of weavers who have gone down the centuries taking out bad guys and making the world a better place.  Fox introduces Wesley to Sloan, the head of the Fraternity, who tells Wesley that Cross is a renegade member of the group who murdered Wesley's father.  If Wesley passes the initiation test and makes it into the Fraternity, he'll have an opportunity to revenge his father's death by taking out Cross.  The initiation is a no-holds-barred beat-down that would turn Hulk Hogan into a quivering wreck, but Wesley toughs it out and becomes a Fraternity member.  All is well...... or is it?  Something in this Fraternity doesn't smell right, and it doesn't take Wesley long to find out what.  The resulting denouement includes train wrecks, bombs blowing up, bullets shooting around in circles (did I mention this is an action movie?), exploding heads; Timur Bekmambetov didn't miss a trick in this film.  He piles special effect on special effect until we think our heads are going to explode as well, but somehow it all works.  Don't try to deconstruct this film to find out how it works, because that won't work.  In fact, it's best enjoyed by just putting your brains on hold and watching the fun.A few words on the acting.  Although James McAvoy is endearingly wimpy as Wimpy-Wesley, he doesn't quite make the total transition to Wonder-Wesley.  Morgan Freeman is chillingly effective as Sloan, the head of the Fraternity, and the supporting actors all give competent performances.  But the one who dominates the screen in every scene she's in is, of course, Angelina Jolie.  We've heard so much over the past few years about Angelina-the-humanitarian, Angelina-the-supermom, Angelina-the-other-half-of-Brangelina, etc., that it almost brings you up short when you watch her act and remember that Jolie is an actress, and a damn good one.  She totally throws herself into this movie.  A magazine feature on the film said that it was Jolie's idea to keep her lines to a minimum to make her character more scary and menacing, but Jolie doesn't need a lot of dialogue in this movie; she conveys more with her eyes than most actors could express in ten lines of script.

He holds a corporate dead-end job with a boss who does not respect him and has a girlfriend who has been cheating with, of all people, his very best friend. Adding to his troubles are what he perceives to be a continual series of anxiety attacks that he tries to treat with prescribed medications; little does he know that these physical states that he has been trying to treat are actually rare, genetic gifts passed down from his father who abandoned him when he was an infant. What were thought to be handicaps that would induce psychotic states that might affect his performance on the job and in life are to be discovered as superhuman, albeit mutant, characteristics once Wesley encounters the lovely Fox, an assassin who holds the secret to the fate of Wesley's father as well as that of Wesley himself.Upon meeting Fox, Wesley is taken to a textile factory, which is a front for an underground, vigilante network known as The Fraternity. Leading this secret society is an elder named Sloan, who tells Wesley that his destiny is with The Fraternity and that his soon-to-be cohorts, including Fox, all share the aforementioned physiological traits compatible for the perfect assassin.Who is to be assassinated? Only the stitching in the woven cloth holds the key, and Sloan is the one who translates and interprets what is to be revealed and carried out. Supposedly, Sloan is the intellectual heir, a Grand Pooh Bah if you will, of the wisdom of the prophetic practices of The Fraternity that have been handed down for over a millennium.Wesley, through this group, learns more about the purpose of his existence and why his father left him. Or does he? Surprising twists and turns await Wesley, whose identity, upon a sudden moment's notice, has essentially undergone a metamorphosis from George Costanza to Jason Bourne, the latter of which has been searching for his true identity.In all, a great movie played out by the star-studded cast, including the superb James McAvoy, the alluring Angelina Jolie, and the indomitable Morgan Freeman.",5,"YOU'VE GOT TO BE ALL MINE, ALL MINE",1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,2220,"['Wanted', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'action-packed', 'thriller', 'centers', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'course', 'parallel', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'storyline', 'corporate', 'dead-end', 'job', 'boss', 'who', 'not', 'respect', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'been', 'cheating', 'people', 'very', 'best', 'friend', 'Adding', 'troubles', 'are', 'what', 'be', 'continual', 'series', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'treat', 'prescribed', 'medications', 'little', 'know', 'physical', 'states', 'been', 'trying', 'treat', 'are', 'actually', 'rare', 'genetic', 'gifts', 'passed', 'down', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'infant', 'What', 'were', 'thought', 'be', 'handicaps', 'would', 'induce', 'psychotic', 'states', 'might', 'affect', 'performance', 'job', 'life', 'are', 'be', 'discovered', 'superhuman', 'albeit', 'mutant', 'characteristics', 'once', 'Wesley', 'lovely', 'Fox', 'assassin', 'who', 'secret', 'fate', 'Wesley', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'Wesley', 'himself.Upon', 'meeting', 'Fox', 'Wesley', 'taken', 'textile', 'factory', 'front', 'underground', 'vigilante', 'network', 'known', 'Fraternity', 'Leading', 'secret', 'society', 'elder', 'named', 'Sloan', 'who', 'Wesley', 'destiny', 'Fraternity', 'soon-to-be', 'cohorts', 'including', 'Fox', 'share', 'aforementioned', 'physiological', 'traits', 'compatible', 'perfect', 'assassin.Who', 'be', 'assassinated', 'Only', 'stitching', 'woven', 'cloth', 'key', 'Sloan', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'revealed', 'carried', 'out', 'Supposedly', 'Sloan', 'intellectual', 'heir', 'Grand', 'Pooh', 'Bah', 'will', 'wisdom', 'prophetic', 'practices', 'Fraternity', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'down', 'millennium.Wesley', 'group', 'more', 'purpose', 'existence', 'why', 'father', 'left', 'Surprising', 'twists', 'await', 'Wesley', 'identity', 'sudden', 'moment', 'notice', 'essentially', 'undergone', 'metamorphosis', 'George', 'Costanza', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'latter', 'been', 'searching', 'true', 'identity.In', 'great', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'including', 'superb', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'alluring', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'indomitable', 'Morgan', 'Freeman']",N/A

McDaniel,"[2, 3]","5.0 out of 5 stars Great Little Thrill Ride!, December 17, 2008If you want a simple, straightforward action adventure movie, look no further.Great production values, good acting, lots of shooting and explosions, and a car chase to rival anything done before (no kidding!).Understand, this is a sort of a comic book on steroids, so you'll only get a little character development. You won't get any deep or complex thoughts, or any difficult to understand plots (while there's one plot twist, it's pretty easy to see coming, and it's an homage to a plot twist in Star Wars, so it'll be familiar when it shows up).Overall, this is slick, fast, and brilliantly executed. The lead character did a nice job of moving from nerdy and repressed to the king of killers, but that's the only character development in the entire movie, and it's the core of the movie.A quick summary: the band of super assassins must train a wet behind the ears kid to be the perfect killer. He has the personality of Caspar Milquetoast, and is afraid of his own shadow, so their work is cut out for them. They use a sort of Zen training coupled with beating the living heck out of him, which is a very effective training technique in comic books and action movies (hey, they almost had enough training scenes for a good montage!).Ultimately the kid comes into his own (kinda like Luke Skywalker) and justice or something like it triumphs. With lots of gunshots, explosions, and time-bombed rats with wristwatches tied on them like fashion belts (I'm not making this up!).Angelina Jolie is perfect as the action heroine with a deeply hidden heart of gold, and James McAvoy who plays the lead was magnificent as nerd/sortofsuperhero.If you like action movies, this is your cup of tea, and you'll love it.If you like psychological drama, or escapist fantasy with philosophical overtones, or romantic comedy, you really want to go elsewhere.",5,great little thrill ride!,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,1908,"['5.0', '5', 'stars', 'Great', 'Little', 'Thrill', 'Ride', 'December', '17', '2008If', 'want', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'action', 'adventure', 'movie', 'look', 'further.Great', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'acting', 'lots', 'shooting', 'explosions', 'car', 'chase', 'rival', 'anything', 'done', 'kidding', '.Understand', 'sort', 'comic', 'book', 'steroids', ""'ll"", 'only', 'get', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'deep', 'complex', 'thoughts', 'difficult', 'understand', 'plots', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'coming', 'homage', 'plot', 'twist', 'Star', 'Wars', ""'ll"", 'be', 'familiar', 'when', 'up', '.Overall', 'slick', 'fast', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'lead', 'character', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'moving', 'nerdy', 'repressed', 'king', 'killers', 'only', 'character', 'development', 'entire', 'movie', 'core', 'movie.A', 'quick', 'summary', 'band', 'super', 'assassins', 'must', 'train', 'wet', 'ears', 'kid', 'be', 'perfect', 'killer', 'personality', 'Caspar', 'Milquetoast', 'afraid', 'own', 'shadow', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'use', 'sort', 'Zen', 'training', 'coupled', 'beating', 'living', 'heck', 'very', 'effective', 'training', 'technique', 'comic', 'books', 'action', 'movies', 'hey', 'almost', 'had', 'enough', 'training', 'scenes', 'good', 'montage', '.Ultimately', 'kid', 'own', 'kinda', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'justice', 'something', 'lots', 'gunshots', 'explosions', 'time-bombed', 'rats', 'wristwatches', 'tied', 'fashion', 'belts', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up', '.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'perfect', 'action', 'heroine', 'deeply', 'hidden', 'heart', 'gold', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'lead', 'was', 'magnificent', 'nerd/sortofsuperhero.If', 'action', 'movies', 'cup', 'tea', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.If', 'psychological', 'drama', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'philosophical', 'overtones', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'elsewhere']",N/A

From the trailers you might think the red Viper is the automotive star of the film... and you'd be wrong.After an impossibly silly stunt early in the film the Viper isn't seen again. Indeed - and very oddly - in the very next scene an old C4 Corvette is substituted - totally out of style with the Jolie character. Perhaps the budget ran out and only allowed for one Viper stunt car - and indeed some people believe that the C4 was digitally inserted over the Viper. Worse, when the Jolie character is shown shifting gears, it's a clearly a Viper shifter being moved. And that's the end of even the slightest interest for car enthusiasts.And speaking of being moved, several Viper Club members had reserved seating in the theater. There they were, all but one with t-shirts featuring the big grinning worm, and the other with a shirt featuring racetracks the wearer had clearly never seen.  After some glee from the appearance of the Viper very early on, they sat in glum silence for the rest of the overly-long nearly 2-hour movie.A bizarrely thin Angelina Jolie gives an oddly wooden characterization, and even tosses in one naked butt shot. Does the UN Goodwill Ambassador really need to do that?James McAvoy as the reluctant hero does better, but his writers spend a huge chunk of the film explaining what a sad loser his character is: his best friend is bonking his live-in girlfriend and his boss looks like a refugee from the movie Hairspray (could that be an uncredited John Travolta underneath?). And then there is Morgan Freeman, for some reason given an acting credit when he can't act at all. He delivers his lines with the same lack of enthusiasm as he has done since before the gadawful Million Dollar Baby. I'm sure he could have tried a bit harder for his multi-million dollar fee. Freeman can do better than this... although he hasn't for a very long time.If there was a saving grace for this film, it was the theater we choose to see it at.

Wanted takes everything you know about the laws of psychics and throws them out the window and gives you high octane CGI slo-mo action instead. There is a great ensemble cast in this roller-coaster ride (Jolie, Freeman, McAvoy). However, ""curving bullets"" was just ludicrous, and there was no supernatural or fictional backing to explain how they did this, but they just ""gangster drew"" their gun at an angle to curve the bullet-- absolute hog-wash.The script is poorly written and hopes that you aren't taking any kind of mental notes on character backgrounds or making logical sense of the overall story. Looms are used to predict deaths of people with a binary code. Hmm I'm pretty sure binary was created with advent of computers not with ancient monks 1000 years ago. There is little if no background on the ""Fraternity"" except a short ill-lived montage.There are some good laughs and ""owning"" scenes (when McAvoy kicks down the door to his ex-gf's and storms into the bathroom, then kisses Jolie in front of his ex). Also when Morgan Freeman says ""Oh f**"" and gets sniped from miles away-- I believe this is the first film where Freeman drops the ""f-bomb."" Additionally the action scenes are worth viewing.All in all, rent this to say you've seen it then make fun of its ridiculous plot devices. I do believe Morgan Freeman was saying ""Oh f***"" when he say the box office results of this failed action flick. Freeman and Jolie are so tenured into the industry that they can pay to do failed b-movies once in awhile...

The car chase in the beginning was wild. The story line begins with a simple guy (Wesley) working in a cubicle-job he hates with an annoying, obnoxious, donut-eating, weight-challenged boss, who talks to him like he is gutter trash.  Even his anxiety meds don't seem to help him deal with her not-so-pleasant attitude.  Even his girlfriend is boinking his so-called best friend.  Wesley is just one of those quiet guys that some people take advantage of. Anyway, he soon is invited to join an elite team of assains, called The Fraternity,"" and they are unlike most assains.  They are smoother than the hairs on a frog's back.  The Fraternity perform executions, based on a pre-selection process of people determined to be not in everyone's best interests to live. The motto is ""kill one, save a thousand."" Angelina Jolie (aka Fox) is a member of The Fraternity, as is Morgan Freeman (aka Sloan).  They are excellent in their roles, as always. (Guys, you can get a naked-back shot of Angelina.)Wesley just happens to be the son of one of The Fraternity and possesses talents he is unaware of.  These guys and gals can speed their heart rate up to 400 beats per minute (so everybody else is moving in slow motion) and can shoot the wings off of a fly. (Don't tell Green Peace.)  They can even cause bullets to bend around an object or person to hit a target.  Lots of computer work and lots of action. Other than all the blood and head shots, I thought it was pretty good, but that's just me with the blood thing. By the way, Wesley's initiation into The Fraternity and training is pure HELL! Wesley also gets daddy's possessions (arsenal) and money (3.5 mil). Of course, we get to see Wesley tell his boss to go frig herself.Not for the young and impressionable children.  There was a lot of blood and a lot of people being shot in the head and beat up and some energetic sex between Wesley's best friend (?) and Wesley's girlfriend. I felt like I needed to detox after watching this one, but that's just me.Angelina Jolie does a great job in this movie, as do the others.",4,Action Flick,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,2212,"['Saw', 'one', 'theater', 'Not', 'normally', 'type', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', '2', 'hours', 'Wall.e', 'Wanted', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'car', 'chase', 'beginning', 'was', 'wild', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'guy', 'Wesley', 'working', 'cubicle-job', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'donut-eating', 'weight-challenged', 'boss', 'who', 'gutter', 'trash', 'Even', 'anxiety', 'meds', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help', 'deal', 'not-so-pleasant', 'attitude', 'Even', 'girlfriend', 'boinking', 'so-called', 'best', 'friend', 'Wesley', 'just', 'one', 'quiet', 'guys', 'people', 'take', 'advantage', 'Anyway', 'soon', 'invited', 'join', 'elite', 'team', 'assains', 'called', 'Fraternity', 'are', 'most', 'assains', 'are', 'smoother', 'hairs', 'frog', 'back', 'Fraternity', 'perform', 'executions', 'based', 'pre-selection', 'process', 'people', 'determined', 'be', 'not', 'everyone', 'best', 'interests', 'live', 'motto', 'kill', 'one', 'save', 'thousand', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Fox', 'member', 'Fraternity', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'aka', 'Sloan', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'always', 'Guys', 'can', 'get', 'naked-back', 'shot', 'Angelina', 'Wesley', 'just', 'be', 'son', 'one', 'Fraternity', 'talents', 'unaware', 'guys', 'gals', 'can', 'speed', 'heart', 'rate', '400', 'beats', 'minute', 'everybody', 'else', 'moving', 'slow', 'motion', 'can', 'shoot', 'wings', 'fly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Green', 'Peace', 'can', 'even', 'cause', 'bullets', 'bend', 'around', 'object', 'person', 'hit', 'target', 'Lots', 'computer', 'work', 'lots', 'action', 'Other', 'blood', 'head', 'shots', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'blood', 'thing', 'way', 'Wesley', 'initiation', 'Fraternity', 'training', 'pure', 'HELL', 'Wesley', 'also', 'daddy', 'possessions', 'arsenal', 'money', '3.5', 'mil', 'course', 'get', 'see', 'Wesley', 'tell', 'boss', 'go', 'frig', 'herself.Not', 'young', 'impressionable', 'children', 'was', 'lot', 'blood', 'lot', 'people', 'being', 'shot', 'head', 'beat', 'up', 'energetic', 'sex', 'Wesley', 'best', 'friend', 'Wesley', 'girlfriend', 'felt', 'needed', 'detox', 'watching', 'one', 'just', 'me.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'do', 'others']",N/A

The ones that followed an office worker around while playing ELO music? In the commercials, it was clear that the poor guy's only hope of breaking out of the hum-drum work-a-day world was ... to buy a Beetle. For the first 20 minutes of Wanted, I kid you not, you get, almost the same commercial, but our hero's only way to break out is to follow Angelina Jolie into a life of assassinations and brutality, the latter inflicted on himself. From that point until almost the very end, the movie plays just like Star Wars Episode IV (that's the first one, right?) The ending is interesting and unexpected. Which is to say the first ending. The second ending seems to have been added for ""closure"" but I would have been fine leaving the first ending as-is.All the performances were solid. Angelina Jolie had about 5 lines. Morgan Freeman could add gravitas to a Lucky Charms commerical, and James McAvoy is fine (not inspired or memorable, but suitable in the role.) The effects are comic-book (which makes sense considering the origin of the material) and they sometimes make you go, ""Wow!"" This includes car chases, roof top action, and the ability to ""bend"" bullets like David Beckham bends soccer balls.There is one critical plot point that seems to have been lost in the rewrites concerning the guy in the first scene.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[5, 6]","This isn't a movie, it's a buffet; it goes through the list of big Hollywood blockbusters and picks bits off a few of its favorites.  And that's not always bad, but it depends on what movies are being picked.  I was actually okay with it when it was cherry-picking the best ofMr. & Mrs. Smith, andThe Matrix, andThe Empire Strikes Back, andBatman Begins, and I was even okay when it was harvesting bits fromOffice SpaceandThe Drew Carey Show.  I think when it was approaching the climax and it started picking up bits fromWillardthat it crossed the line for me.James McAvoy does a remarkable job making the transition from schlub to superhero, possibly the best transformation we've seen since Christopher Reeve first took off those glasses and became Superman.  And while Anjelina Jolie is basically playing the same character she played in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Tomb Raider, it's an engaging character that makes good use of her hot figure and inherent athleticism.  Of the other cast members, Morgan Freeman is the only one who demonstrates more than one character trait, but come on, in an action flick like this, how diverse of a character do you really need?The basic problem is that it can't decide what kind of movie it's trying to be.  Is it an action film?  A character conflict?  A Hong Kong chop suey dust-up?  It starts out like a broad comedy, but it loses sight of its sense of humor at the end of Act One and becomes aggressively maudlin (what a paradox).  At the finale it even tries to tack on a remarkably unearned moral, like we're supposed to learn something profound from a kid who would destroy an entire passenger train full of people just to get one guy.Moreover, much of the narrative rests on surprise revelations that are neither surprising nor revelatory, and on twists so well-worn that regular filmgoers could practically write the script based on me telling you the three major points the filmmakers try to conceal.  This picture uses slick visuals and stylish fight scenes to make up for the fact that there is not one original or novel idea to be had from beginning to end.  By combining a paint-by-numbers script with vacuous characters and stilted dialog, this film gives us the very epitome of why film buffs are so weary of Hollywood in the Twenty-First Century.I previously praised the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith because it knew exactly how dumb a film it was, and was willing to just have fun with that fact.

He works at a job that he hates and that's so repetitive that he's developed a stress injury from doing a mind-numbing amount of nothing. His girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend, and both of them think he's too stupid to notice. And he has to take pills every day for anxiety attacks that make him feel as though he'll lose control. Basically, he's going nowhere fast.Until one night he's standing in line to fill his prescription and the most beautiful woman he's ever seen (Angelina Jolie, who is truly stunning in this role) comes up beside him. She tells him that his father--who left when Wesley was only a week old--died the day before, and that the man who killed him is right around the corner. And then we have an amazing fight scene. Basically Wes learns from Fox (Jolie) that his father was an assassin, one of the best, and that he was killed by a rogue agent. The only person capable of killing this rogue is Wesley himself, and she and her friends will train him to do it. Wesley jumps at the opportunity to end the drudgery of his life, and begins training to become a member of the Fraternity, an elite group of assassins.That's it in a nutshell, but this movie was so much more than a story about assassins. It was visually stunning, action packed, and didn't take itself too seriously. Wesley gets the crap kicked out of him while he's in training, but like a Timex, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking. These assassins are dangerous, versatile, and creative. They can bend bullets, make shots from impossible angles, and kill based on fate--not any sort of personal vendetta or hatred. But of course things aren't as they seem, and Wesley has to learn that power comes with a price. Wanted is entertaining from start to finish, and I'm generally not one for action films. It's the perfect date movie because while guys can stare at Jolie and enjoy the action, ladies can laugh at the jokes and enjoy the man candy. Everyone wins! If you're in the mood to be entertained with creative fight scenes and witty dialogue, you'll definitely enjoy this film. In fact, I think I'll see it again next week.

1197092,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B001GKJ2DE,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[2, 2]","Just as the stunts in this movie defy logic, so do the plot and the characters motivations. Based off of the comic Mark Millar and J.G. Jones the movie makes little sense in and of itself (which is probably due to the fact it doesn't follow the comic much at all, it takes ""artistic liberties"" to new heights!), but none-the-less is enjoyable.The movie starts off briefly explaining the fraternity, and shows the death of one of its members and then quickly shows us the lead character Wesley (played by James Macavoy) explaining to us why his life sucks.  His girlfriend is a b****, his best friend is a jerk, and his boss Janice constantly induces his anxiety attacks.  While purchasing his anxiety medication he is confronted by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who claims that someone is trying to kill him, and then in the middle of the store engages in a gun fight, and takes Wesley on an insane car chase.  He is brought to the fraternity head quarters and told that his father was a member and that Wesley's destiny is also to be in the fraternity as well.This movie has excessive amounts of profanity, and although it does not cite this in the most reviews I saw, some nudity (You see a dudes butt in the beginning part of the film, I love how male nudity is rarely considered nudity unless it is frontal).  The violence is also excessive, but it is not on caliber with a horror film in that it does not show explicit details.  It primarily has a lot of blood splatter shots, and no real detail like brains or disembowelments.The acting is as good as you can expect it to be in this type of movie since the twists the plot takes make no sense, nor do the choices of the characters make any sense.

Check.  Over-use of cgi?  Check.  Ridiculous lapses of logic or sense?  Check.  Shaky-camera close-ups(a personal annoyance)?  Check.But wait...what's this?  Did i care for the lead character and root for him?  Check.  Was i kept entertained throughout most of the film?  Check.  Was Angelina Jolie's character kept in line to allow the movie to focus on our protaganist?  Check.Honestly, i didn't know much about this film(or its origins) except for its generic trailer that featured that idiotic scene where A.J. 'picks up' McAvoy's character in that car.  I thought that headache-inducing scene in the actual movie was terrible too(see my complaint about shaky-camera close-ups).  But here's the thing, i was eventually won over by James Mcavoy and his performance and once i put my ""that can't possibly happen"" mentality behind, i thouroughly enjoyed the film believe it or not.  (and it's not that easy for me, as on a related note, i tried to put that mentality behind for Indiana Jones 4 and still couldn't enjoy it that much.)Here's the test for WANTED though.  Early in the film, if you can't accept the scene where an assassin jumps from one building to another building and think to yourself ""ok, so this isn't a standard assassins movie"" then you might as well ask for a refund or stop the dvd right then and there.  But if you can accept the premise of these superhero-esque assassins with special powers and allow yourself to go along with the main character, then you might actually enjoy the film.  I know i'm surprised i did.  And if the dvd has tons of extras, i might be convinced to buy it.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars(rounded up to 4 on amazon) because the lead actor(not the action scenes, cgi, or camera-work) propels this film to rise above average mediocrity.

1197107,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B001GKJ2DE,magellan,"[2, 2]","By the end of the movie I was wondering if this was based on one of Mark Millar's graphic novel ideas, and sure enough, it was in the credits. The movie has garnered a fair number of negative reviews, but this film about an ancient guild of super assassins does have its moments, although for its material it basically rips off just about every recent action thriller you can think of, from The Matrix to Star Wars. Still, how many truly original movies are there? A movie's success basically depends on how well it does with its already usually shopworn themes and ideas, anyway. But I digress; more specifically, the action sequences here reminded me of the spectacular gun-play in the movie, Desperado, starring Antonio Banderas and Joachim Almeida from the early 90s, if I remember right. The idea of a guild of ancient weaver-assassin's is also cool. The interior scenes of the mill with its great looms were also well done.There's certainly a lot of action, and the train wreck scene on the bridge is one of the best action sequences I think I've ever seen in a movie. The cast is excellent between Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, although I was less familiar with the male lead, which is why I don't recall his name here, but anyway, he did a good job too.Some of the ideas are wildly fantastic, but fun anyway, such as the special loom and the finely woven cloth with its knots that can be deciphered to name their next victim like a binary code. There's a diverse cast of characters, and the training scenes where they convert the protagonist from a meek accountant to a trained killer are entertaining, although again, pretty fanciful stuff, the most incredible thing being the idea that these super assassins have some psychokinetic powers that allow them to bend bullet trajectories around obstacles and corners. He gets trained in both gun and knife tactics. The knife fighting scenes reminded me of the scenes in the movie Dune between Gurney Halleck and Paul Atreides.Anyway, not a great flick but not as bad as the negative reviews here say; maybe those are from the fans of the graphic novel who didn't like how it turned out, but I haven't read them yet to find out, but I will.",3,Mindless fun,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2199,"['end', 'movie', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'based', 'one', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'graphic', 'novel', 'ideas', 'sure', 'enough', 'was', 'credits', 'movie', 'garnered', 'fair', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'ancient', 'guild', 'super', 'assassins', 'have', 'moments', 'material', 'basically', 'off', 'just', 'recent', 'action', 'can', 'think', 'Matrix', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Still', 'how', 'many', 'truly', 'original', 'movies', 'are', 'there', 'movie', 'success', 'basically', 'how', 'well', 'already', 'usually', 'shopworn', 'themes', 'ideas', 'anyway', 'digress', 'more', 'specifically', 'action', 'sequences', 'here', 'reminded', 'spectacular', 'gun-play', 'movie', 'Desperado', 'starring', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Joachim', 'Almeida', 'early', '90s', 'remember', 'right', 'idea', 'guild', 'ancient', 'weaver-assassin', 'also', 'cool', 'interior', 'scenes', 'mill', 'great', 'looms', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'certainly', 'lot', 'action', 'train', 'wreck', 'scene', 'bridge', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'less', 'familiar', 'male', 'lead', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'here', 'anyway', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'too.Some', 'ideas', 'are', 'wildly', 'fantastic', 'anyway', 'such', 'special', 'loom', 'finely', 'woven', 'cloth', 'knots', 'can', 'be', 'deciphered', 'name', 'next', 'victim', 'binary', 'code', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'training', 'scenes', 'where', 'convert', 'protagonist', 'meek', 'accountant', 'trained', 'killer', 'are', 'entertaining', 'again', 'pretty', 'fanciful', 'stuff', 'most', 'incredible', 'thing', 'being', 'idea', 'super', 'assassins', 'have', 'psychokinetic', 'powers', 'allow', 'bend', 'bullet', 'trajectories', 'obstacles', 'corners', 'trained', 'gun', 'knife', 'tactics', 'knife', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Dune', 'Gurney', 'Halleck', 'Paul', 'Atreides.Anyway', 'not', 'great', 'flick', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'say', 'maybe', 'are', 'fans', 'graphic', 'novel', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'yet', 'find', 'out', 'will']",N/A

He hates his life, but is resigned to it and just deals with it all until a opportunity comes up. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman play their roles well as McAvoy is trained to be an assassin, I was really, really enjoying this film, however, it unravels into something ludicrous.The plot twist is different, but at the same time feels completely cliche.

I wanted to see more of James McAvoy. I wanted to have a good time. I wanted to enjoy an evening at the movies. I got what I wanted, all of the above, but at the same time I suppose I also wanted the movie to be perfect: perfect script, perfect story, perfect plausibility, perfect character development. That's a lot to ask of any movie. But there it was, sitting next to me in the empty seat, snuck in with me and didn't even have to pay to see the show. On any other day it would have been the death of the movie for me.This has happened repeatedly for movies and me. If we don't see eye-to-eye on that first date, there's hardly a chance that I'll ever look at the dating possibilities again. The Princess Bride has suffered this irrevocable fate from an unfortunate head-on collision with an idealized, college-aged version of me. The movie never took itself seriously enough. Or maybe I'd just always taken myself too seriously. Whichever, the experience is a lost one, one that cannot be altered. The Princess Bride will never get a fair chance to just be itself with me. I'm to invested in wanting it to be something else, wanting it to be more perfect in ways in maybe didn't much care about.I did the same thing several years earlier with David Lynch's Dune. Somehow with Dune, though, 20 years later I found a way to re-encounter the film on its own merits. I found a way to drop the baggage I had taken with me the first time and look at the movie from a different perspective. I saw not what I had wanted to see as a teenager, but I saw what the creative artists were presenting. If you miss what is on the screen, what the artists have put there, then you aren't really talking about the movie. You're talking about you. I guess I let go of making this one film about me. But that sort of thing is a rarity for me.Some other unfortunate victims of my desire for several kinds of perfection over the years: Forrest Gump, The Fifth Element, the entire canon of Classic Disney films, Spaceballs and every Mel Brooks film that followed, Waiting for Guffman, and the musical as a genre. Even the Beatles were relegated for a decade or more to the shelves of ""less than important moments that could easily be forgotten, or erased from history altogether without loss."" As a teenager I could watch Caveman with Ringo Starr and Shelley Long, over and over as it played and replayed on HBO, but just a few years later I was turning up my nose to The Princess Bride. What changed that long time ago, and what has now changed back again, today? (Wednesday night actually.) The acceptance finally that perfection is truly unattainable? No, that would be too obvious. Too easy.I've been struggling in a very broken environment for far too long. I've tried fixing it. I've tried introducing concepts of perfection to it. I've tried to allow time to do its magic and ""heal all wounds"". But it's like trying to re-weld a pot metal belt buckle. It's like trying to re-connect two broken pieces of polystyrene, and all you do with chemicals or heat or adhesives is melting the joints, further destroying the very materials themselves, or making a really ugly patch job. The thing just becomes another lifeless pile of goo. You can't keep re-shaping it into the thing it once was.  So it's time to throw away that which is broke and go somewhere else. But if I go there looking for perfection, I'm going to be recycling the last twenty years of my life all over again. I need to look at each new situation as an imperfect one, not a potentially perfect one. (And people too.) These imperfections are what makes these things real. The are part of our collective humanity. And I need to accept that. No, I need to embrace imperfection. Broken, worn-out, neglected, mistreated, self-destructive, these things I can do without. But the ordinary, garden variety of imperfection, hell, even a healthy dose of it, that is everywhere, and it is essential to what it means to be human. That I can accept.As for McAvoy, Jolie, the script, and the movie, I can accept that in you too. Because there is genuine strength along side the moments of imperfection.

To make the last statement even more ludicrous is that this fraternity started in the middle ages as a group of loomers who received messages, via the cloth they loom, to assassinate.Though this all sounds like too much for any one film to bare, ""Wanted"" is so full of life and yes artful C.I.G. effects that we soon dismiss any reservations and get down to the core of the film: a story about a Son (McAvoy) who goes on a journey, both physical and cosmic, to find his father. On the down side, Bekmambetov muddles and stains the mise en scene with so much ""stuff"" that we really have to dig very deep emotionally in order to see this film for what it really is below the razzle-dazzle.With all that being said, Bekmambetov doesn't give any of us time to think much about the ludicrousness of the story as he directs in a style that moves the action along in breakneck pace: sort of like a cross between a ""Bourne"" movie and a 3 Stooges film. And believe it or not, that is a compliment. It's at this point that you either buy into ""Wanted"" and sit back and let it flow over and into you or you go out and refill your popcorn and soft drink containers and think about what you need to do to complete your honey-do list.Angelina Jolie, in her best sultry murderess style manages to make a big impact here: her Fox is beautiful, ironic and played with her tongue firmly planted in her cheek. Jolie is just this side of being a movie icon. Her mere presence gives this film weight and substance.""Wanted"" is certainly not a great film but it is definitely a wild ride and it is fun to see James McAvoy continuing his recent string of first rate performances.

Wesly Gibson, is a nerdy accountant who loves Googling his name to see if there are any hits and who is harrassed at work by an abusive woman who love to snap a stapler at work  He is drawn into a plan to kill a world class assassin.At the beginning we see a top assassin being set on by a bunch of would be assassins.  He takes them all out but seemingly super powers only to taken out by a long range bullet fired by Cross, the most deadly assassin of all.Fox (Angelina Jolie) approaches Gibson in a drugstore just as Cross attacks.  Fox fends him off and takes Gibson with her in a desperate escape via a wild car chase.  She eventually tries to recruit him to a secret society of assassins.  Gibson learns that he has some innate abilities that only one other person had (his father) that allow him to raise his adreline level to the point where he has superhuman abilities.Gibson wants no part of this but is forced to join when he learns that Cross was the one to kill his father.  So begins the training more rigorous than any Kung Fu movie where Cross is beaten, attacked with knives and forced to put his hand in an active loom to extract a moving object.The movie is action packed throughout in mostly a cartoonish way where falls from great heights, impossible stunts and the ability to bend a bullet's arc to one's will are the norm.  You realize that this is almost a live action video game where the characters take all kinds of punishment but are fine the next time.I generally enjoyed the film because I treated more as a farce than a real-life action thriller.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 1]","I have love-hate feelings about cgi.I love the fact that this fantastic computer process allows filmmakers to create new worlds and tell epic stories that were previously difficult, if not impossible, to present on motion picture and television screens.On the other hand, I hate the fact that directors and cgi artists tend to overdo these effects in their movies, often to the detriment of good storytelling.This recent release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  The movie is enhanced with a good basic story, likable performances and many sensational scenes that make for an overall enjoyable viewing experience.  Yet, this film could have been much more than it is had the filmmakers restrained themselves by not throwing everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into their action sequences.For example, the picture contains a car chase through densely populated city streets.  The sequence is well-staged and quite exciting, except that it seems to go on forever with one cgi generated stunt after another.Memo to Filmmakers: Enough already!  Less is More.WANTED is adapted from a series of comic books and tells of a shy junior accountant (James McAvoy), recruited into the Fraternity, an ancient secret society of assassins dedicated to killing people who will put the world into chaos.  McAvoy's long lost father was killed while working for the group, and now James has been selected to destroy the rogue member of the Fraternity who murdered him.Morgan Freeman plays the mysterious leader of the Fraternity, who has his own secrets, and Angelina Jolie is McAvoy's trainer and partner.Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, WANTED is filled with sensational cgi stunts, many of which strain believability.

1197121,A16XRPF40679KG,B001GKJ2DE,Michael Dobey,"[2, 3]","This movie is aimed at action fans who don't really care about any realism. Those who want lots of computer animated effects,  Other movies escape from reality and have flying gunmen , cars that leap over cars , impossible acts that defy physics and a little character development as well so we are by now used to them.  The best of these are tongue in cheek movies like the transporter series and films like ""shoot em up"".  As a high budget A list movie this is shallow little action flick and that's ok.  But it is stuck in the hollywood rut that destroyed the premise of MANY hollywood movies:  The organization is evil and they are the bad guys.  In other words traitors or crooked leaders are the real monsters.  I can't remember the last movie I saw in which a team went after the bad guys and that was it.This is along that bad organization vein, only it's over the top. And it's really aimed at that traditional young man fantasy in which a powerless young guy becomes a weapon of force.  You have to applaud the filmmakers though because in this movie they did NOT have (the always excellent) Angelina Jolie's character fall into bed with the now powerful main character. Which is a wise move and the ending is better than one would expect.  This is pure action on a video game level , it's good enough for having  two fun action filled  hours in spite of the usual hollywood twist: the real enemy is the organization that trains you.  The movies print of blu ray is great and it won't dissapoint blu ray fans in the that regard either.

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","The beginning of Wanted plays out a lot like a scene fromThe Matrix, with a dangerous-looking man in a suit tracking down the source of a special bullet. What ensues is an over-the-top special-effects laden battle in which said man launches himself out of a skyscraper to engage snipers on an adjacent building and manages to kill them all, only to himself be taken out by a sniper's bullet in glorious and disgusting 3-D. Then we're back to a narrative by office drone Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy), prone to panic attacks and harangued by his overweight boss. Warning: this review contains mild spoilers.It's easy to make the parallels between The Matrix and Wanted, given the opening scene, but it's the second scene in the office that really gives the film its heart. This isFight Clubby way ofEquilibrium, amping up the fisticuffs in the former with the gunplay of the latter.Gibson suffers frequent panic attacks and medicates himself heavily in an effort to cope with the insults of everyday life: the stupid job, the unfaithful girlfriend, the backstabbing coworker. He is destined for something better, something that involves the sexiest mentor a man could ask for: a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie). Jolie looks a little too gaunt here, but she hasn't lost her aura of dangerous cool and she uses it in spades to bring poor Gibson into his own as an assassin.Gibson is, in fact, a member of a secret society known as The Fraternity, who in turn are descended from a medieval order dedicated to interpreting God's will via a loom - that's right, a loom. After translating the threads into binary coded orders, The Fraternity kills people who might alter the world's destiny for the worse.Once Gibson transitions from office worker to gun-fu martial artist, complete with curving bullets and hyper-time senses, the movie really takes off: Gibson is out to kill Cross, the man who, Sloan (Morgan Freeman) tells him, killed his father.Unlike say,The Transporterseries, which started out semi-realistic and slowly devolved into action parody, Wanted grounds us in a completely altered reality from the start.  It makes some of the gun-ballet and insane acrobatics performed by the characters easier to swallow, in the same way we accepted Neo's superheroic feats in the Matrix.What's surprising is that Wanted is committed to its tale of revenge and betrayal, willing to sacrifice a potential franchise to tell a good story. It asks the question asked of all religions: how long before the speakers of God's will begin twisting it to their own ends? And what is God's will anyway? Heavy stuff, considering the premise involves shooting lots and lots of people.Wanted is a surprisingly good action movie that transcends the bullet-time genre without seeming too derivative. Along the way, it tells a tight little story that leaves just about everyone dead.

Wesley learns his lessons the hard, bloody way, eventually reaching nearly unstoppable status, before being assigned to take out Cross, who has betrayed the Fraternity. But (naturally) all is not what it seems, the Good Guys are really the Bad Guys, and Wesley is suddenly on his own. And he wants vengeance.

1197125,AOLHE547CHOTX,B001GKJ2DE,Michael Profit,"[1, 3]","""Wanted"" neatly fits into the high octane, shoot `em up action subcategory that movies like ""The Transporter"" have filled over the years. Movies like these are certainly enjoyable for those who love fast cars and dangerous stunts, but in most cases someone who is looking for an action movie with more substance (like ""The Dark Knight"") should probably look elsewhere.Google ""Wesley Gibson"" and no search results will appear. Or at least that's what the main character by the same name would have you believe. Wesley lives a rather mundane life working as an account service representative (or ""account manager"" as he often corrects himself) for an abrasive boss who causes him to have panic attacks. Every day is exactly the same for Wesley, as he skates through life feeling too apathetic to confront his cheating girlfriend or to stand up for himself at work.Meanwhile, in one of the cooler action sequences of the movie, we witness a man literally leap across a city block, from inside one building to the rooftop of another, to fight off would-be assassins. Special effects are in full force in this scene: slow motion cameras capture him running full-speed down a hallway at an impossible speed, causing paper and office supplies to scatter in the process; small shards of glass break away as he bursts through a window shortly after; bullets fired mid-air literally curve around the columns of a building to hit a target.Wesley is later approached by a woman named Fox who unconvincingly tells him that his estranged father, a member of an elite group of assassins called ""The Fraternity,"" was this man, who was later killed by a rogue agent. Following a fantastically choreographed shootout staged in a grocery store and a thrilling car chase, Wesley is introduced to Sloan, head of The Fraternity, and many of its members. After being provoked at gunpoint into performing the impossible task of shooting the wings off of several flies, Wesley is asked to join. While at first resistant, Wesley eventually relents and joins with the promise that he will have the opportunity to avenge his father's death.James McAvoy, who stars as Wesley, gives a solid performance to a character that is meant to be quiet and unassuming, qualities that are certainly not consistent with your average highly trained agent. McAvoy gives an honest credibility to Wesley that other actors may not have been able to provide.Acting aside, the movie looks great and is filled with plenty of subtle humor not normally contained in an action movie like this. While most of the action scenes are admittedly farfetched, as is the concept of a band of assassins that follows orders based on fate, the movie is still highly entertaining.Filled with great action sequences and humor, and supplemented with a fresh take on an otherwise typical revenge story, ""Wanted"" is a unique and memorable movie. Going into the movie expecting to see an intelligent and realistic thriller will likely lead to disappointment; rather, by allowing yourself two hours of fun to absorb a reality where bullets can curve, ""Wanted"" then becomes a really cool movie.",4,Wanted: Suspend Your Disbelief and Enjoy the Ride,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,3123,"['Wanted', 'neatly', 'high', 'octane', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'action', 'subcategory', 'movies', 'Transporter', 'have', 'filled', 'years', 'Movies', 'are', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'who', 'love', 'fast', 'cars', 'dangerous', 'stunts', 'most', 'cases', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'substance', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'should', 'probably', 'look', 'elsewhere.Google', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'search', 'results', 'will', 'appear', 'least', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'same', 'name', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Wesley', 'rather', 'mundane', 'life', 'working', 'account', 'service', 'representative', 'account', 'manager', 'often', 'abrasive', 'boss', 'who', 'have', 'panic', 'attacks', 'day', 'exactly', 'same', 'Wesley', 'life', 'feeling', 'too', 'apathetic', 'confront', 'cheating', 'girlfriend', 'stand', 'up', 'work.Meanwhile', 'one', 'cooler', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'witness', 'man', 'literally', 'leap', 'city', 'block', 'one', 'building', 'rooftop', 'fight', 'off', 'would-be', 'assassins', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'full', 'force', 'scene', 'slow', 'motion', 'cameras', 'capture', 'running', 'full-speed', 'hallway', 'impossible', 'speed', 'causing', 'paper', 'office', 'supplies', 'scatter', 'process', 'small', 'shards', 'glass', 'break', 'away', 'window', 'shortly', 'bullets', 'fired', 'mid-air', 'literally', 'curve', 'columns', 'building', 'hit', 'target.Wesley', 'later', 'approached', 'woman', 'named', 'Fox', 'who', 'unconvincingly', 'estranged', 'father', 'member', 'elite', 'group', 'assassins', 'called', 'Fraternity', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'killed', 'rogue', 'agent', 'Following', 'fantastically', 'choreographed', 'shootout', 'staged', 'grocery', 'store', 'thrilling', 'car', 'chase', 'Wesley', 'introduced', 'Sloan', 'head', 'Fraternity', 'many', 'members', 'being', 'provoked', 'gunpoint', 'performing', 'impossible', 'task', 'shooting', 'wings', 'several', 'flies', 'Wesley', 'asked', 'join', 'first', 'resistant', 'Wesley', 'eventually', 'relents', 'promise', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'avenge', 'father', 'death.James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'Wesley', 'solid', 'performance', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'qualities', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'consistent', 'average', 'highly', 'trained', 'agent', 'McAvoy', 'honest', 'credibility', 'Wesley', 'other', 'actors', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'provide.Acting', 'aside', 'movie', 'great', 'filled', 'plenty', 'subtle', 'humor', 'not', 'normally', 'contained', 'action', 'movie', 'most', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'admittedly', 'farfetched', 'concept', 'band', 'assassins', 'orders', 'based', 'fate', 'movie', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining.Filled', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'humor', 'supplemented', 'fresh', 'take', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'revenge', 'story', 'Wanted', 'unique', 'memorable', 'movie', 'Going', 'movie', 'expecting', 'see', 'intelligent', 'realistic', 'thriller', 'will', 'likely', 'lead', 'disappointment', 'rather', 'allowing', 'two', 'hours', 'fun', 'absorb', 'reality', 'where', 'bullets', 'can', 'curve', 'Wanted', 'then', 'really', 'cool', 'movie']",N/A

It is my opinion that Wesley was an extremely sympathetic character who was able to escape his mundane and boring life (as well as his stress induced episodes) to bring revenge upon the man he believes killed his father.  There were great fight and car chasing scenes that made the movie extremely entertaining, although Matrix-like.Wesley, who is plagued with a cheating girlfriend, a nagging boss and a trifling bestfriend (who even gets him to buy condoms that he will later use on Wesley's girlfriend) has been recruited to kill the man (Cross) who the Fraternity believes killed his father (their top assassin). Recruited by Fox (played by Angelina Jolie), Wesley sets out to enhance his seemingly natural instincts and abilities (by taking various lessons) and learn all that he can from his fellow assassins (fighting, cutting and maiming), who all take their orders from information ""woven"" into fabric and deciphered by Morgan Freeman's character. Although the plot wasn't terribly original, I didn't leave feeling that I had wasted my money or that the movie was the worse that I had ever seen.

This movie is so much of a copy of the matrix it's not even funny, but I'll get to that later.  There is nothing to make you care about the characters. No development at all.  All the action is so, so childish it's not even funny.  The only way it would work is if they took a more care-free approach to the movie, then it would be palpable.  Unfortunately in trying to be cool, they take the whole movie so seriously, which makes it's flaws more memorable that they have to be.  I'm not a snob about action movies, and I really appreciate it when film makers really work outside of the box, but this had no vehicle from which we enter that world.  I liked the first ""Matrix"" and I liked ""Shoot 'em Up.""  There was complete suspension of disbelief in both of those examples.  In the matrix, obviously then explain how characters can basically act as God.  In ""Shoot 'em up"" they took a slightly silly approach and it really allowed the even the overly critical viewers to just take it easy and enjoy the movie.Okay, enough with the serious crap.  Assassins that don't work for $$ and kill based on the thread readings of a LOOM!!  Why did anyone allow this in the script?  I can think of a thousand better random ways to instruct assassins...in a movie, of course.  Even worse, somehow it's also based on binary code of the threads.  Edmund Cartwright you murderous A-hole!  Just because you are dead doesn't absolve you of your role in this horrible movie.  He invented the.....never mind.  If some Maytag repairman would just fix the loom, then no one would ever get killed in a completely unrealistic manner.  The shame of it all.  This is the kind of idiot writing that kills a whole movie.  It's kind of like when you meet a person for the first time and they tell you that they used to drink gravy or used an extension cord as toilet paper in a ""pinch"".  Everything from that point on has the stench of the short bus.Again, they don't get $ for this, yet they go through 100K+ sports and luxury cars like they are candy bars at a fat camp. How do they afford this?...Exactly.The action is supposed to be really slick, cool and innovative.  It's just cheesy though.  This is close to being a spoiler, but I don't consider it one.  There a scene where someone gets shot from an extreme distance.  For some bizarre reason, that shooter marked the spot that the victim will stand in advance.  My best guess is that it's supposed to show how premeditated/methodical the shooter was, but it's just childish and just plain dumb.  ""X marks the spot""?  Film makers are you out of your damn, pirate-obsessed minds?  That sounds really cool if.... you're an idiot.  By the way, when someone gets shot in a movie show the damn spatter.  Don't hold out on us.  If you are going to watch the movie purely for the action/violence, the movie is exactly as effective as a clothed porno.  It's just weak.To sum it up, this movie is created for people with bad taste in movies.  It probably has happened to everyone, when they really remember liking a movie or show when you were 13, then you watch it as an adult and you are truly ashamed.

The movie is campy, crazy, silly, a blood bath, gripping, funny, and always entertaining. Incomprehensible plot aside (a loom that is controlled by fate and spits out binary code?) the movie is darn fun to watch. It's a guilty pleasure for sure, but it's more full of pleasure than guilt if you know what I mean. James McAvoy who plays the protagonist Wesley is likable in that Michael J. Fox sort of way from the Back to the Future films. Angelina Jolie turns in strained performance (she's becoming a bit of a method actor these days), but is fun to watch none-the-less.The action sequences are all extremely well done. Riding atop moving trains, carefully choreographed car chases (with the initial Dodge Viper vs. delivery truck very reminiscent of the car chase in TERMINATOR II), intense shoot outs, curving bullets, and mass mayhem make the movie a carnal, visual feast. Shot almost entirely in Chicago, Lower Whacker, the Green Line El, Lake Street, and the southeast side all play prominent roles throughout the movie. For a Chicagoan like myself, this made the movie even more fun to watch!The nice thing about this movie is that it knows what kind of movie it is. While the plot may not make much sense, there is a sense of fun about the way it is put together, a sort of postmodern humor that makes even the far-fetched nature of some of the scenes palatable.3/5 stars.

Those that are seeking an ultra-slick looking action flick in the vein of The Matrix, and those that are fans of Mark Millar's ultra-violent comic book mini-series.  Needless to say, Wanted delivers as an action flick on its own merits, but sadly doesn't give its source material the justice it deserves, and while there are some dynamite action scenes to be found here, it lacks what made the comic so good in the first place.  James McAvoy stars as Wesley Gibson; an office drone stuck in a dead end everyday life until he runs into the seductive Fox (Angelina Jolie), and thus learns that he is the son of the world's greatest assassin.  Soon enough, Wesley learns of his place in the secret Fraternity, run by the enigmatic Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and begins to receive training to follow in his father's footsteps and take vengeance on his killer Cross (Thomas Kretschmann).  Things aren't what they seem however, as Wesley soon learns.  Directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch), Wanted is loaded with slick and bloody action sequences, and is frequently compelling as well.  The cast isn't bad either, even if McAvoy comes off as a bit whiny in the role.  Still, as a film, Wanted is so different from Mark Millar's comic that it misses the mark in terms of attitude and pitch black comedic moments.  It isn't any secret that Wanted in its purest comic form would be unfilmmable, given the ultra-nihilistic nature, but the film's story is such a departure from the source material that it hardly bears any resemblance except for the character names of Wesley and Fox.  Still, Wanted delivers in terms of big-budget action flicks, and is still worth seeing regardless of its flaws.",3,"A decent, entertaining action flick that doesn't give its source material enough justice",1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1781,"['are', 'two', 'distinct', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'Wanted', 'are', 'seeking', 'ultra-slick', 'looking', 'action', 'flick', 'vein', 'Matrix', 'are', 'fans', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'ultra-violent', 'comic', 'book', 'mini-series', 'Needless', 'say', 'Wanted', 'delivers', 'action', 'flick', 'own', 'merits', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'give', 'source', 'material', 'justice', 'are', 'dynamite', 'action', 'scenes', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'what', 'made', 'comic', 'so', 'good', 'first', 'place', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'office', 'drone', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'everyday', 'life', 'seductive', 'Fox', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'thus', 'son', 'world', 'greatest', 'assassin', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Wesley', 'place', 'secret', 'Fraternity', 'run', 'enigmatic', 'Sloan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'receive', 'training', 'follow', 'father', 'footsteps', 'take', 'vengeance', 'killer', 'Cross', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'however', 'Wesley', 'soon', 'Directed', 'Russian', 'director', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Day', 'Watch', 'Wanted', 'loaded', 'slick', 'bloody', 'action', 'sequences', 'frequently', 'compelling', 'as', 'well', 'cast', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'McAvoy', 'off', 'bit', 'whiny', 'role', 'Still', 'film', 'Wanted', 'so', 'different', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'comic', 'mark', 'terms', 'attitude', 'pitch', 'black', 'comedic', 'moments', ""n't"", 'secret', 'Wanted', 'purest', 'comic', 'form', 'would', 'be', 'unfilmmable', 'given', 'ultra-nihilistic', 'nature', 'film', 'story', 'such', 'departure', 'source', 'material', 'hardly', 'resemblance', 'character', 'names', 'Wesley', 'Fox', 'Still', 'Wanted', 'delivers', 'terms', 'big-budget', 'action', 'flicks', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'regardless', 'flaws']",N/A

Somewhere along the way, the leader of this Fraternity, played by Morgan Freeman, gives into greed and uses the talents of his organization to kill for hire.  One of his subordinates, named Cross, leaves the group and begins fighting back.  The Fraternity in turn finds Cross's son, tells him that Cross actually killed his father, and trains him to kill Cross.The movie is pure action, with lots of shooting, running, car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of other objects as weapons.

1197149,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B001GKJ2DE,Nick Schwartz,"[5, 6]","""Wanted,"" director Timur Bekmambetov's (""Night Watch,"" ""Day Watch"") comic book adaptation, is a solid summer action flick.  Over-the-top and deliberately cartoon-ish, the creative action sequences and general visual flair help the film distinguish itself from other CGI-filled action extravaganzas, as does the generous helping of graphic violence and profanity, which many other summer blockbusters tend to shy away from.  Add to that generally good performances (in not so serious roles) from James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman, and you get what pretty much amounts to an awesome video game in movie form...  Somewhat forgettable, far from life-changing, but an absolute blast from start to finish.Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is a boring, unnoticed cubicle worker with a stress disorder, who discovers that his father (who left when Wesley was a mere seven days old) was an assassin for a secretive group known as 'The Fraternity,' and was recently murdered.  The Fraternity, working under the front of a textile mill, is a group of assassins - among them Fox (Jolie) and the head of the group, Sloan (Freeman) - that has existed for thousands of years and who dispatch people that 'fate' has instructed them to kill.  When Wesley discovers the truth about his father, Sloan and Fox take him under their wing, and train him to avenge his father's death, by assassinating Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who murdered him.My problem with Bekmambetov's earlier film, ""Night Watch"" was that it felt so over-stylized that it wound up lacking a distinct style of its own.  The first act of ""Wanted"" suffers this same problem: too much emphasis on flashy editing, bizarre camera angles and sound distortion.  But once Wesley decides to join ""The Fraternity"" the film seems to settle into a style all its own, and becomes, actually, a treat to watch  for the most part.  The cinematography on the whole is really spectacular; there are a few really clever uses of shallow focus, and the camera is always moving.  While I am getting increasingly tired with the over-use of CGI in action films, the effects in this film are generally really strong, and the film is clearly very aware of itself (it ends with a character blatantly breaking the fourth wall), so the effects often feel very tongue-in-cheek, which usually works in the film's favor.The action sequences are also generally really good, and very creative. Watching one particular scene towards the end really reminded me of the way I felt viewing similar scenes from ""The Matrix"" and ""Equilibrium"" for the first time.Overall, a really solid, but very over-the-top action film.

This film has some of the most ridiculous action scenes and far-fetched gunfights I've seen since The Matrix in 1999. You've got two amazing and original car chases, lots of intense and downright awesome shootouts, an engagingly deep story, and quite a few interesting characters. The actors all do a great job, especially James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman. Angelina Jolie was just there to look good and didn't do much. I highly recommend seeing this film, even if it's just for the action scenes. And if you like the film, also check out the video game:Wanted: Weapons of Fate. It captures the feel of the film perfectly and is really fun to play.From a collector's edition standpoint, this set is very well done. It comes with some really great special features and collector's items, such as the acrylic film cell and the lobby cards. Everything comes packaged in a solid case lined with some fancy fabric, which is house by a thick plastic sleeve with a bullet lodged in it. My only complaint is the storage of the discs. They attach to a cardboard shooting range target and just sit in the case. The discs will not get damaged or anything, it just feels awkward when removing it from the case.

Dead end job with a boss he hates, his girlfriend is cheating on him with his best friend, and he feels cowardly from the anxiety attacks he suffers. That is all about to change though because like his father Wesley is special.

Wesley's father has been killed and his position needs to be filled so it may as well be filled by Wesley...The movie ends and I look at the floor and shake my head ever so slowly. This has got to be one of the dumbest movies ever committed to DVD. To be honest I knew what I was in for but decided to take the ride anyways and I wasn't disappointed, it was dumb.The Good: I can't fault the people who worked on look and sound of this movie. It was a great looking movie and had great visual effects and sound effects. I am very sorry that these people's talents went to waste on this lame duck of a film though.The Bad: Ok, let's forget about the fact that the main character is able to obtain professional level skills at all aspects of fighting and weapons in 6 weeks. Lets forget about the fact that Angelina Jolie's character is able to take a Viper at high speed kick the door open, do a 360 all while scooping up James McAvoy's character unharmed. Let's also forget that said Viper for some reason cant easily out run a work truck. Let's also forget that somehow the characters in this movie can hit targets by curving bullets but somehow can't hit a guy that is just running away from them. Forget about all of that.

The selling point for me in this movie was Morgan Freeman. He's been excellent in pretty much every film he's done so I had no doubt he would shine here. While I won't say it's his worst performance, he has had far better roles in the Batman films and in Driving Ms Daisy, Glory, and Million Dollar Baby. It felt like this role was sort of a throwaway for him. Perhaps he read the script and thought ""Why not just do a fun one.""James McAvoy was alright, but as with Morgan this was not his best. Some of the action he was in was pretty out there so if anything, most of his role got lost in it. Angelina Jolie was alright, playing a role we've seen her play before as a tough girl with a heart. Her character development flopped to me, again feeling as if it took a backseat to the action.*****Possible Spoiler******Still, she has one very funny scene where she rolls up to another car as her corvette is falling to pieces. She offers a smile and drives on, flat tires and all.The supporting characters all have interesting nicknames which kind of get explained, but not really. The core of this movie is in its action sequences. As I stated in the title, if you come into this without suspending disbelief, you may not enjoy it. There are car flips, Angelina shows us an interesting way to pick someone up in her car, there are curving bullets, bullets that crash into each other, and trains that plummets from what looks like at least 200 feet. The action keeps you interested as you start trying to figure out what other interesting, oddball methods they may use to try and knock someone off.An interesting action ride with a sort of interesting plot.

1197178,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001GKJ2DE,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","I'm not a big Angelina Jolie fan.  She's given some fine performances in the past, true (GIRL, INTERRUPTED)...but mostly she has become a persona and not a real person.  But I have to admit, her persona is perfectly suited to play a highly-skilled assassin who really enjoys her work.  Jolie holds a gun quite convincingly.  She kills with great conviction.  And of course, she wears all the clothes of her trade with great panache.  She's come a long way since taking on Laura Kroft in TOMB RAIDER (and coming across as a bit silly).  MR. AND MRS. SMITH helped to cement her style, and in WANTED, she's perfected it.  It's not a demonstration of great acting talent...but she DOES give a performance.WANTED tells the ridiculous story of a millennium -old ""Fraternity of Assassins,"" who are the most remarkably skilled killers in the world.  Apparently, a small portion of the population has an innate ability to do physics-defying things like curve the trajectory of bullets so they can fire around obstacles.  (This is the coolest thing to happen to bullets since ""Bullet Time"" in THE MATRIX.)  But this Fraternity, headed by Morgan Freeman, is under attack from a ""rogue"" assassin...one of their own.James McAvoy is a cubicle-dwelling loser who is recruited into this group...and it is through his eyes that we see this film.  At first, we get to meet him taking grief from his boss and reluctantly accepting the fact that  his personal life is a joke as well.  He's a nerd full of pent-up rage.  But one night, Jolie whisks him away from a threat to his life in a chase scene that truly gets the blood pumping.  When she shoots out her own windshield and then climbs through the opening to fire at her pursuer over the roof of her car, and still managing to steer with her legs...the movie instantly is transported into a realm of marvelous silliness.  It's a totally cool moment that leaves you almost giddy because it dares you to say ""no, that can't happen.""  If you DO say that, you'll be depriving yourself of a good time.WANTED is a movie with a few stellar action sequences, punctuated with montages of McAvoy training and a few brief glimpses into the ways of The Fraternity.  Frankly, the story is hardly the point...it's the action.  And WANTED delivers on this score.  So let's be perfectly clear here...if you want to see a film that stimulates the mind or the heart..stay away from WANTED.  If you want the heart to get pumping and the adrenalin to flow...this film will fit the bill.This is not to say that the film is perfect, even on this modest level.  I've now officially decided that I have very little use for James McAvoy.  I hated him in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE and barely tolerated him in ATONEMENT (a movie I barely tolerated).  In WANTED, he plays the goofy loser convincingly, but when he's transformed into the skilled murderer...it's almost laughable how unbelievable he is.  The forward momentum of the movie, and Jolie's steely presence deflect us away from McAvoy's shortcomings...but I frequently found myself wondering what he was doing in this film.  Morgan Freeman is completely coasting in the film.  There's no doubt he has one of the silkiest voices in history, and I can always listen to him...but I can also tell he wasn't terribly engaged in all this.  A paycheck role.Yet, I still recommend it...as long as you understand what you're getting into.  If you do accept it, then this movie might be some of the best fun you've had at the movies this summer.",4,"Set your expectations properly, and you'll have a GREAT time!",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,3512,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'fan', 'given', 'fine', 'performances', 'past', 'true', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', 'mostly', 'become', 'persona', 'not', 'real', 'person', 'have', 'admit', 'persona', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'play', 'highly-skilled', 'assassin', 'who', 'really', 'work', 'Jolie', 'gun', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'great', 'conviction', 'course', 'clothes', 'trade', 'great', 'panache', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'taking', 'Laura', 'Kroft', 'TOMB', 'RAIDER', 'coming', 'bit', 'silly', 'MR.', 'AND', 'MRS.', 'SMITH', 'helped', 'cement', 'style', 'WANTED', 'perfected', 'not', 'demonstration', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'DOES', 'give', 'performance.WANTED', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'millennium', '-old', 'Fraternity', 'Assassins', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'remarkably', 'skilled', 'killers', 'world', 'Apparently', 'small', 'portion', 'population', 'innate', 'ability', 'do', 'physics-defying', 'things', 'curve', 'trajectory', 'bullets', 'can', 'fire', 'obstacles', 'coolest', 'thing', 'happen', 'bullets', 'Bullet', 'Time', 'MATRIX', 'Fraternity', 'headed', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'attack', 'rogue', 'assassin', 'one', 'own.James', 'McAvoy', 'cubicle-dwelling', 'loser', 'who', 'recruited', 'group', 'eyes', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'get', 'meet', 'taking', 'grief', 'boss', 'reluctantly', 'accepting', 'fact', 'personal', 'life', 'joke', 'as', 'well', 'nerd', 'full', 'pent-up', 'rage', 'one', 'night', 'Jolie', 'away', 'threat', 'life', 'chase', 'scene', 'truly', 'blood', 'pumping', 'When', 'shoots', 'out', 'own', 'windshield', 'then', 'climbs', 'opening', 'fire', 'pursuer', 'roof', 'car', 'still', 'managing', 'steer', 'legs', 'movie', 'instantly', 'transported', 'realm', 'marvelous', 'silliness', 'totally', 'cool', 'moment', 'almost', 'giddy', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'DO', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'depriving', 'good', 'time.WANTED', 'movie', 'few', 'stellar', 'action', 'sequences', 'punctuated', 'montages', 'McAvoy', 'training', 'few', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'ways', 'Fraternity', 'Frankly', 'story', 'hardly', 'point', 'action', 'WANTED', 'delivers', 'score', 'So', 'let', 'be', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'here', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'mind', 'heart..stay', 'away', 'WANTED', 'want', 'heart', 'get', 'pumping', 'adrenalin', 'flow', 'film', 'will', 'fit', 'bill.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', 'even', 'modest', 'level', ""'ve"", 'now', 'officially', 'decided', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'use', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'hated', 'THE', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'ATONEMENT', 'movie', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'WANTED', 'goofy', 'loser', 'convincingly', 'when', 'transformed', 'skilled', 'murderer', 'almost', 'laughable', 'how', 'unbelievable', 'forward', 'momentum', 'movie', 'Jolie', 'steely', 'presence', 'deflect', 'away', 'McAvoy', 'shortcomings', 'frequently', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'completely', 'coasting', 'film', 'doubt', 'one', 'silkiest', 'voices', 'history', 'can', 'always', 'listen', 'can', 'also', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'engaged', 'paycheck', 'role.Yet', 'still', 'recommend', 'as', 'long', 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'do', 'accept', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movies', 'summer']",N/A

If you go in as a fan of the comic expecting a perfect translation, then you will be disappointed.The movie was heavily modified from its comic book roots to be tailored for the mainstream audience. Some of the characters, such as Wesley & Fox, were created with Eminem and Halle Berry in mind and their personalities reflect this while other characters either switched places or were molded together. Some of the changes are significant such as leaving out a more detailed explanation of the fraternity, the super-villian angel, etc.The movie does stand proudly on its own merits. It is filled with many action scenes and tense interactions between the characters.++ ACTING ++The acting is what you expect in a film. They play up Angelia Jolie's sex appeal including advertising a scene where you briefly see the naked backside of her character for a split moment who, turns out, was a butt stunt double.++ QUALITY ++The quality of the film is an excellent transfer let it be on DVD or Blu-Ray.

I'd forgotten all about it till it popped up on Netflix. I have to admit that Angelina and Morgan sold me on the movie from the start. Nice decision from the director to cast them.  However, James Mcavoy was a fresh surprise and his metamorphosis from lowly accountant to deadly assassin was played well and not too over the top.  It's nice to see an action thriller with some good humor tossed in...such as his domineering fat boss, his goofy coworker (the keyboard scene is a riot) or the ATM that tells him how much of a loser he is.Angelina doesn't steal the screen here either.  She actually doesn't even talk that much playing Fox, the assassin who is supposed to train Wesley Gibson (Mcavoy) to kill the assassin who just recently killed his father.  Freeman is head of The Fraternity, the group of assassins who kill people based on a fabric loom who gives them messages of fate, and they are able to bend space and time to always get their kill.  So, there's even a touch of supernatural here; I didn't even know this movie was based on a comic.The special effects are nice, nothing too extreme, mainly car chasing, fighting, and gun action..slow mo of bullets flying around people which is cool. There is a lot of blood though if you don't like that sort of thing.  Morgan practically turns into Samuel L. Jackson in the end with a nice ""MF"" quote which I didn't expect.  Kudos again to Mcavoy though for being able to run with the big dogs.

I have to admit that I picked it up with limited expectations, but once into it, I found it to be a bloody, irresistible ride---for what it is, that is.This film was spectacular in Blu-ray, appearing almost 3-D, at times. The CGI and audio were equally adrenaline pumping and, although I'm not usually into blood-fest, action films, this one became addictive.Yeah, the plot was limited, but I found a great deal of enjoyment watching James McAvoy morph from a passive, introverted, office cube-jockey, into a man. One who learned to stop saying, 'I'm sorry,' for just about everything. I did find myself mentally repeating, 'wax on, wax off,' during some of his lethality training, with difficulty taking his transformation seriously :-).Morgan Freeman has been a great addition to so many films, but he often tends to come across with the same acting formula. His abilities were stretched, with this atypical character.  Amazingly, he can actually be a convincing 'bad guy.' Who knew!Angelina Jolie's role was a piece-of-cake for her.  She rarely had any dialogue.  She was basically eye-candy, for the guys.  But, her sultry, sexy, witchy-eyed attributes were perfect for this killing-machine, character. Hmm, I'm scared of her!  And, she does angst SO well with those pouty lips, doesn't she.So, if you view this movie with casual expectations and are willing to allow yourself the enjoyment of pure escapism and bloody mayhem, I think you will enjoy this movie.  Just don't have too many espressos before watching.

The movie made good company while I wrapped Christmas presents just before the 2008 Holiday.Some guy named James McAvoy acts and looks just like Shia LaBeouf. He hooks up with a cult of assassins with super-human powers (including Jolie), and he starts slow by dealing a little payback on some work acquaintances, and then enters the assassination major leagues with Jolie as his mentor.The whole thing is pretty predictable, with the same hokey humor that was abundant inTransformers.

1197196,A2OCCLHLLWTPLI,B001GKJ2DE,spacefan,"[2, 2]","Having become a tad disillusioned with the endless stream of mind-numbing action fare churned out by the Hollywood film industry, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which boasts a terrific cast, is helmed by an accomplished non-American director, and though very loosely based on the Mark Millar / JG Jones comic series, still comes through with a coherent and compelling plotline, thanks to a team of great scriptwriters.Special mention goes to Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, who handle their roles wonderfully. I've always been a fan of both actors, but having them in the same film in close proximity is a huge bonus.Director Timur Bekmambetov demonstrates artistic flair in staging complex, violent action sequences. He's quite the expert at hurling moving objects of various sizes in all directions ( already evident from his Night Watch days ), be it a locomotive, a sports car, or a shiny bullet engraved with the word ""GOODBYE"". It's still too early to know whether his creativity will stand the test of time, but for now, he's giving the Americans a run for their money.Danny Elfman's soundtrack for this film is vastly different from his previous work ( e.g. Batman, The Simpsons, Desperate Housewives, just to name a few ). He has composed an outstanding score for Wanted, giving the movie that extra oomph with its hard-rock riffs and the occasionally playful guitar theme ( which you hear often in the trailers ). I don't know if many people even pay attention to the soundtrack when there's so much else going on, but I really loved it.Of course, my final kudos go to none other than James McAvoy, who's always dependable as a dedicated character actor, and portrays Wesley Gibson perfectly. He has the right look ( a bit geeky, but boyishly handsome ), the right physique ( he's 5 ft 7 in ), the right voice, and those eyes - they beat Tobey Maguire's hands down.Credit goes to those who were brave - and intuitive - enough to cast him in spite of his Scottish accent and previously unproven box-office power. McAvoy is clearly able to handle any role with ease, and he is a potent mixture of lovable, funny and sexy qualities here.I'm going to pre-order the DVD the minute it's available.",5,Quite A Masterpiece!,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,2220,"['Having', 'become', 'tad', 'disillusioned', 'endless', 'stream', 'mind-numbing', 'action', 'fare', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'terrific', 'cast', 'helmed', 'accomplished', 'non-American', 'director', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Mark', 'Millar', '/', 'JG', 'Jones', 'comic', 'series', 'still', 'coherent', 'compelling', 'plotline', 'thanks', 'team', 'great', 'scriptwriters.Special', 'mention', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'handle', 'roles', 'wonderfully', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'actors', 'having', 'same', 'film', 'close', 'proximity', 'huge', 'bonus.Director', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'artistic', 'flair', 'staging', 'complex', 'violent', 'action', 'sequences', 'quite', 'expert', 'hurling', 'moving', 'objects', 'various', 'sizes', 'directions', 'already', 'evident', 'Night', 'Watch', 'days', 'be', 'locomotive', 'sports', 'car', 'shiny', 'bullet', 'engraved', 'word', 'GOODBYE', 'still', 'too', 'early', 'know', 'creativity', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'now', 'giving', 'Americans', 'run', 'money.Danny', 'Elfman', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'vastly', 'different', 'previous', 'work', 'e.g', 'Batman', 'Simpsons', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'composed', 'outstanding', 'score', 'Wanted', 'giving', 'movie', 'extra', 'oomph', 'hard-rock', 'riffs', 'occasionally', 'playful', 'guitar', 'theme', 'hear', 'often', 'trailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'pay', 'attention', 'soundtrack', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'really', 'loved', 'it.Of', 'course', 'final', 'kudos', 'go', 'none', 'other', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'always', 'dependable', 'dedicated', 'character', 'actor', 'portrays', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'perfectly', 'right', 'look', 'bit', 'geeky', 'boyishly', 'handsome', 'right', 'physique', '5', 'ft', '7', 'right', 'voice', 'eyes', 'beat', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'hands', 'down.Credit', 'who', 'were', 'brave', 'intuitive', 'enough', 'cast', 'spite', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'previously', 'unproven', 'box-office', 'power', 'McAvoy', 'clearly', 'able', 'handle', 'role', 'ease', 'potent', 'mixture', 'lovable', 'funny', 'sexy', 'qualities', 'here.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'pre-order', 'DVD', 'minute', 'available']",N/A

His boss makes his life a misery and his best friends is having an affair with his girlfriend, his life is directionless and he's not sure what his life's purpose is.  Then Vox (Jolie) comes along, rescues him from an assassin and introduces him into the world of the fraternity.The fraternity are a group of highly skilled assassins, lead by Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who can bend bullets, see in slow motion and who rid the world of unsavoury characters who cause more harm than good.  That is until some darker secrets start to come to light......This is one of those action films that runs at a frenetic pace and as long as you don't over-analyse it you will be in for a rip-roaring ride.  There are fights galore, high speed car chases and enough explosions to keep the most ardent action fan pleased.  The stunts and special effects are pretty impressive and whilst they are reminiscent of The Matrix at times, they are still great fun to watch.McAvoy doesn't seem gritty enough to be an action hero, but he suit's the role well as the everyman who gets dragged into a world he doesn't fully understand.  Jolie is a little wooden, but to be honest she takes a back seat in this film and you don't really notice her one way or the other.  Freeman adds a certain gravitas as he always seems to do in the roles he plays.The direction was pretty good too, with slowed down time and bullets and the action scenes are handled very well.  The soundtrack is great as well and the use of Nine Inch Nails' `Every Day is Exactly the Same' when McAvoy is an office worker was inspired.Overall this was a very good film, with enough thrills and spills to keep you entertained and a plot that keeps you interested throughout.

I enjoyed the film tho it doesn't rank up there anywhere near close to my favorites.The video transfer is excellent, great resolution and clarity with no aliasing and deep shadow details.  The DTSHD audio doesn't make the best use of the surrounds in so far as discreet audio coming from any of the surrounds.  The soundtrack clearly overpowers any foley sounds that may have come from them.  There is some side to side audio transitioning as well as front to back but, like ""Saving Private Ryan', the bullets should be falling left and right all over the discreet channels.  Of course, with such a movie the sub woofer does get a great workout.The extras include an alternate opening scene, which after seeing, I agree that it should not  have been used.  The making of special effects shorts are all well documented and interesting as well.I would have probably been just as happy to have this film in the standard def format but have not had an opportunity to compare.

1197205,AL277B4AQCWBG,B001GKJ2DE,Steven Reynolds,"[3, 5]","Apologetic loser, Wesley Gibson - a knowing cuckold and paralyzed victim of workplace bullying - discovers his true destiny is not actually preparing billing reports for a nasty boss. When he's apparently almost killed waiting in line at the drugstore, only to be saved by a gun-slinging-Dodge-driving Angelina Jolie, he's given some interesting news: his estranged father has just died and his own drug-controlled panic attacks are actually evidence of a rare inherited disorder that predisposes him to be the perfect assassin. He's promptly freed from white-collar servitude and bundled off to a Chicago textile mill where he spends weeks learning the ways of The Force ... wait, no, that's not quite right. It's the Fraternity. But it might as well be the Jedi Order given the number of lines lifted almost verbatim from the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and a character arc that's suspiciously Skywalkerish. Wesley's mission? Kill the assassin who turned to the dark side and betrayed and murdered his father... ""Wanted"" is utterly ludicrous, but thankfully knows it. Its winking self-awareness carries you through the bracing opening and a genuinely engaging setup, but it can only take you so far. Wesley's training is absurd, and when Fraternity supremo Morgan Freeman reveals they take their coded kill-orders from a 1000-year-old feral 'spinning jenny' out back of the textile mill, you realize the wheels really did fall off back when Angelina flipped the Dodge. The beefed-up James McAvoy looks like giving Shia LaBeouf some competition for the everyman action hero roles - you never lose the sense that Wesley is someone like you - and Angelina Jolie is, as always, just ludicrously, impossibly hot. But this movie isn't about performances. It's about the kinetics and spectacle of seeing people shot and things blown up - graphically, repeatedly, and from as many angles as possible. On that score it delivers - the car chase and train sequence were particularly impressive. But sadly - and quite surprisingly for a film adapted from the world of the graphic novel, and created by this crew - ""Wanted"" doesn't quite have the visual style to catapult it from ludicrous to cool, nor the bedrock of interesting ideas or big themes to make it meaningful. It's less Wachowski brothers and more Jan De Bont. You'll smile, you'll wince, you'll shake your head in disbelief.

1197213,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001GKJ2DE,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[5, 6]","Stylistic, violent, innovative, startling, unexpected and outrageous, Timur Bekmambetov's Wanted has his name written all over it. From its recognizable editing flair to its over-the-top, farfetched action sequences, his film is designed to show audiences exactly what they want to see. And whether or not they anticipate these crowd-pleasing moments, they most certainly don't disappoint. Some may call it nonsense, but Wanted demonstrates just about every awe-inspiring technique that can be utilized to satiate the ever-hungry action-adventure fan.1000 years ago, a secret organization of elite warriors banded together, after recognizing an unparalleled skill. Being able to control abnormally high amounts of adrenaline, these gifted humans can move faster, think quicker, and bend the limitations of physics - and so they became assassins. Dubbing themselves The Fraternity, the small organization let fate decide who their targets shall be, and set out to rid the world of the worst it has to offer.It is the present, and Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is an apathetic jellyfish - a wimp who uncaringly allows others to trample on his life; his boss obnoxiously reprimands him; his best friend is cheating with his girlfriend. Analyzing his pointless existence, he sinks deeper into depression and prescription drugs, simply hoping to drudge through each day as an extant human being. During a routine trip to the pharmacy, Wesley suddenly finds himself the target of a covert assassin, and in the protection of a mysterious tattooed woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie).Wesley discovers that his father was one of the most powerful members of The Fraternity, and that he possesses the same skills as the other superior assassins. Finally realizing his purpose in life, Wesley trains with Fox, Gunsmith, Butcher, Repairman, and the leader of The Fraternity, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), in order to fulfill his destiny by killing Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who murdered his father.Wanted brilliantly weaves its story with highly stylized editing (a trademark of revolutionary director Timur Bekmambetov) that involves gratuitous amounts of slow-motion, sped-up shots, scenes in reverse, bullet-cams, and plenty of CG angles, as the camera zips around the unfriendly locales. The visual effects are all spectacular, featuring impressive stunts, car chases, leaping from rooftops, train wrecks and futuristic weaponry. The action sequences are often undeniably extravagant, but Timur is careful to make each one as thrilling and unpredictable as possible. From flipping cars over one another on a highway, or arcing the path of bullets, there is a certain believability, or at least acceptance, of impossible actions within the superhuman world crafted from the graphic novel source material.Jolie takes on a similar role to Schwarzenegger's protective T-800 from Terminator 2, and incites mass destruction with casual ease. Gunsmith (Common) teaches Wesley about anything that fires bullets, The Butcher shows him how to wield a knife, and The Repairman beats him to a bloody pulp. The training sequences yield an impressive sorting of memorable specialists which makes for stunning battle sequences and sanguinary spectacles. It is the violence that really stands out in Wanted, and the fevered visionary tactics by Bekmambetov showcase the most hilariously egregious moments of bloodshed. Portions of the film are incredibly bizarre, and others are white-knuckle thrilling.

1197214,AYNFIXRY0KR22,B001GKJ2DE,The Judge,"[10, 19]","I've tried twice and still haven't been able to finish this movie...  it's that bad.Each time I've tried I've turned it off and spent my time with much more constructive and entertaining activities, like paying my friend to stomp on my nuts until I forget the portion of the movie I endured.Let me bring method to the madness with respect to the cast/charecters (please forgive me if I spell names incorrectly):Angolina Jolie - By putting her in this movie the teenage males hoping to see a decent looking naked girl buy tickets.  I'll admit, I was hoping a charecter similar to Mr and Mrs Smith (a movie I thoroughly enjoyed).Morgan Freeman - This dude hasn't made to0 many bad movies.  I can't think of one, until now.James Mcevoy (the hero) - Any adolecent minded male with daddy/anger/control issues will like this guy's charecter.  The actor seems OK, but his charecter sucks.All of the above were assembled to sell tickets/rentals to a movie that is TERRIBLE.  The script/plot is terrible, so bring in some decent actors and you'll lure some people into watching the movie.I'm a guy that LOVES action movies.  Realistic, roger, not always the case.  I enjoyed the crap out of movies like: Sin City, The Punisher: War Zone, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, etc.  Realistic - not always, but entertaining and well done IMHO.So I tried to watch Wanted as though it were and adaptation of a comic book (like Sin City, but less artsy).  If you do that... you MIGHT be able to endure the whole movie.  Problem is, it's a LAME comic book.An example - The hero's dad is a super assassin capable of ""spiking his adrenaline"" allowing him to move with incredible speed.  Cool idea.  Not realistic, but I can deal as long as it's entertaining, you know?  Then he jumps through a plate glass window at the speed of a race car without so much as a scratch.  Ummmmmmmm...  OK, maybe, stretching it, we're talking hollywood and this mistake is common...  Then - while in flight - the shooting starts.  The super assassin is capable of ""curving bullets.""  He proceeds to dispatch several opposing assassins with a compensated Beretta pistol and an OLD SCHOOL BLACK POWDER PISTOL.  Why, in the name of god, would a dude that can jump through a plate glass window at MACH 2 without physical damage and curve 9mm bullets around 90 degree corners need a FLINT LOCK?  Lame.  Then, all of the sudden, gravity kicks in and the super assassins trajectory takes him into yet another plate glass window just below the roof where his would-be killers are now bleeding.  Naturally our super assassin appears on the roof top to polish of the last bad guy.  Then he gets shot in the head from what appears to be many miles away after a conversation with an enemy super assassin on a cell phone.  He must have been crashing from his adrenaline High, because it didn't occur to him to seek cover DURING the conversation.  See this scene in the movie an you'll know what I'm talking about.  We've now achieved MEGA Lame.  I'm not going to get into the timing of the conversation, the shot itself, and the bullet which would need to be traveling at the speed of light to ACTUALLY do what it did... Ok, I will because it further illustrates how lame the movie is: dude gets killed after last word in phone conversation - elaborate ""rewind"" scene back to the shooter - who pulls the trigger after the last word of the conversation -> guy killed at same time as trigger pull = speed of lightFrom here it get's lamer and lamer, until I had to stop and have my reproductive organs smashed until I came back to my senses.You'll see a car chase where the super assassins, who are SO talented they can curve bullets, expend more ordnance than a Marine Platoon in Fallujah - and don't hit a damn thing.  Infact, they seem to hit everything but what they're aiming at.The hero of the movie (the previously mentioned adrenaline spiking super assassin's son) goes from the mental/emotional equivilant of a female reproductive organ to the hollywood version of a Delta Force commando (who can eventually curve bullets as well) in less than a day...Excessive violence, excessive profanity (look I'm a military man, I have no problem with profanity - but this wasn't clever, it was SAD), rediculous action scenes where physical laws apply at the will of the writer, gun play that is inconsistent (especially when it comes to marksmanship), aaaaannnnnnddddd...  the curving bullets thing...  LAME.Do yourself a favour.  You'll loose just as many brain cells and be more entertained by drinking a bottle of whiskey, going to a bating cage, and letting speed balls hit you in the head until you pass out.",1,"Really,

1197215,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001GKJ2DE,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[81, 95]","""Wanted"" is a mile-a-second action picture that never lets up.  Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) suddenly finds that his life as an ordinary office worker is over.  A beautiful woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), crashes into his life and introduces him to the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins led by the mysterious Sloan (Morgan Freeman).  Wesley is informed that his long-lost father was murdered while working for the Fraternity and Wes has been chosen to target the rogue member who did it.  Before he can complete his assignment, he must first uncover the dark secrets behind the Fraternity to understand why he was selected and how he figures in its plans.The main attraction of ""Wanted"" is the amazing use of CGI special effects, from glass panes shattering as bodies fly through them to bullets redirecting their trajectory in mid-propulsion.  Jolie manages to look as comfortable in action flicks as in serious dramas like the recent ""Changeling.""  She is quite the action babe and easy on the eye.  McAvoy, who showed his acting chops in ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""Atonement"" seems an odd fit for ""Wanted.""  He looks as if he's doing this one to pay for the new swimming pool.  He's fine in the early scenes as a drone-like worker lost in a huge company, but his transformation into this almost-indestructible super assassin is harder to accept.Bonus extras on this two-disc DVD include an extended scene; behind-the-scenes featurettes on the film's stunts, visual effects, and origins in the graphic novel; and a making-of documentary.",3,"Action, Action, and More Action",1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,1550,"['Wanted', 'mile-a-second', 'action', 'picture', 'never', 'up', 'Wesley', 'Gibson', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'suddenly', 'life', 'ordinary', 'office', 'worker', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Fox', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'life', 'Fraternity', 'secret', 'society', 'assassins', 'led', 'mysterious', 'Sloan', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Wesley', 'informed', 'long-lost', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'working', 'Fraternity', 'Wes', 'been', 'chosen', 'target', 'rogue', 'member', 'who', 'did', 'can', 'complete', 'assignment', 'must', 'first', 'uncover', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Fraternity', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'selected', 'how', 'plans.The', 'main', 'attraction', 'Wanted', 'amazing', 'use', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'glass', 'panes', 'shattering', 'bodies', 'fly', 'bullets', 'redirecting', 'trajectory', 'mid-propulsion', 'Jolie', 'look', 'comfortable', 'action', 'flicks', 'serious', 'dramas', 'recent', 'Changeling', 'quite', 'action', 'babe', 'easy', 'eye', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'showed', 'acting', 'chops', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Atonement', 'odd', 'fit', 'Wanted', 'doing', 'one', 'pay', 'new', 'swimming', 'pool', 'fine', 'early', 'scenes', 'drone-like', 'worker', 'lost', 'huge', 'company', 'transformation', 'almost-indestructible', 'super', 'assassin', 'harder', 'accept.Bonus', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'include', 'extended', 'scene', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'film', 'stunts', 'visual', 'effects', 'origins', 'graphic', 'novel', 'making-of', 'documentary']",N/A

If you're a fan of bullet time then you'll like this movies use of it.  It doesnt feel like a Matrix clone or a cheap parody.  It's used as part of the plot itself, so it becomes more relevant than just a special effect. Nonstop action scenes start after a very short character delvelopment period, and I do mean nonstop. The action is fast and furious throughout every scene.  The budget on this film must have been phenomenal, or else they found some cheap CGI labor.  That's what I liked about it, what I didn't like about it is that it was poorly written.  By the time the twist in the movie is revealed, it will be obvious to the viewer what it is.  They used too much forshadowing. One event that happened was forshadowed three times, and blatantly at that.  I'd rather be kept guessing until a twist occurs, to me that's not even a twist.  The dialog was mediocre at best.  Even the stellar cast couldn't save that. All in all I liked it.  I'd recommend it as a rental for sure.  As a purchase I believe it'd be one you'd watch once and then put away in your collection.  Of course, if you are an uber fan of Jolie or Freeman, it's a must own.",3,Take the good with the bad.

1197225,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001GKJ2DE,Turfseer,"[3, 8]","'Wanted' begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a high-rise office building. One off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him. However, when he jumps, he's able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground. He's also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks. All this comic book nonsense wouldn't be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film. Bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place.Brian McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office worker hooked on anti-anxiety medication. He's a wuss surrounded by his unlikeable boss, an obese woman who berates him all the time. His best friend humiliates him by having sex with his girlfriend in front of him on multiple occasions. Gibson is recruited by a 1000-year old secret society of assassins called ""The Fraternity"" led by Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman) who informs him that one of their renegade members, Cross, has murdered one of their best members, who just happens to be Gibson's father who he never knew. Apparently The Fraternity wants to train the hopeless Gibson because they feel being an assassin is in his blood. He goes through a very long-winded training period where various members of the group (including ""Fox"" played by Angelina Jolie) toughen him up by punching, stabbing and shooting him all over his body. Gibson must be subjected to numerous rounds of torture until he becomes 'egoless' and finally adopts the steel-like mindset of the professional assassin.The Fraternity is not without its new age pretensions for every time they beat Gibson to a pulp during their training session, they then put him in a bath, place some kind of clay all over his body (including his face) and fill him with vodka. Miraculously the bath and the vodka do the trick and he's up and about to face another round of beatings until he's ready to go forth and battle Cross. Meanwhile, Sloan reveals to Gibson how members are given their assignments. They work in some sort of textile factory where a loom weaves a tapestry which produces messages with some kind of secret code discernible within the fabric. Sloan seems to be the only one who knows how to decipher the messages and hence doles out the assignments. Gibson along with Fox end up shooting some guy in an office building while they're running from one subway train to another on an elevated track.Things get worse when Gibson finally is able to track down Cross and kills him but not before finding out that Cross was actually his Dad and the Fraternity had double-crossed him. In the laughable finale, Gibson drives a garbage truck full of rats armed with miniature time bombs and dumps them inside some European castle where the Fraternity are all ensconced. The rats explode and most of the assassins are killed. Sloan somehow escapes but Gibson dupes him (we never find out how) by planting a double in his old office cubicle.Just about like every other death in this film, Sloan takes a bullet in the forehead. The last shot in the film is Gibson holding his machine gun, cursing all his opponents and basically bragging what a macho guy he is.'Wanted' is basically trash for mindless 14-year-old's. The director is from Russia and famous for Vampire films. This would have been a much better film if he threw a few vampires into the mix. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie merely show up to cash their paychecks. Not only does 'Wanted' promote violence, it revels in it. In the perverted moral universe of 'Wanted', a winner is defined as the last thug left standing. Hopefully you won't pay $12 to see this trash.

1197236,A3OVGORKGD7BQ6,B001GKJ2DE,"WolfMama ""Liz""","[1, 1]","I watched this film over the past weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm an action flick aficionado anyway, and I've seen every kind of action film you can name. But this one breaks the mold a bit.There seems to be a tried and true action film recipe for action films, with slight variations in the plot. But Wanted takes the recipe and turns it 360 degrees and shakes it. I'm not going to go through the whole movie blow by blow, others have done that already.Usually with action flicks you know what's going to happen after the first fifteen minutes of the movie. This flick kept surprising me after the first fifteen minutes. Things I kept expecting to happen didn't, and the things that did happen were given an interesting twist.And about the 'looms of fate' people have commented on in prior reviews, perhaps the screenplay writer loosely based that idea on the Moirae, or maybe Arachne with her web of fate, found in Greek mythology, even though there was no explanation given in the film.The special effects were very good. But the things that saved it from being just another action film were the acting, and the twists and turns in the plot. And there wasn't one sex scene in the whole movie involving the hero and the leading actress. That just goes to show you that the obligatory sex is NOT necessary to a good film.I think they picked just the right actor James McAvoy to play Gibson. The ordinary everyday man who emerges victorious when extraordinary unbelievable things happen to him, and turn his life upside down. It shows us that true strength is not from size and muscle, it flows from the character of the individual.I guess you can tell I enjoyed this film immensely. It'll keep you guessing until the very last scene.But just like everything else, everyone likes different movies, so rent it before you buy and make up your own mind.",5,Not a cookie cutter action flick,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,1863,"['watched', 'film', 'past', 'weekend', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', ""'m"", 'action', 'flick', 'aficionado', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'action', 'film', 'can', 'name', 'one', 'mold', 'bit.There', 'be', 'tried', 'true', 'action', 'film', 'recipe', 'action', 'films', 'slight', 'variations', 'plot', 'Wanted', 'recipe', '360', 'degrees', 'shakes', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'whole', 'movie', 'blow', 'blow', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'already.Usually', 'action', 'flicks', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'flick', 'kept', 'surprising', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Things', 'kept', 'expecting', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'things', 'did', 'happen', 'were', 'given', 'interesting', 'twist.And', ""'looms"", 'fate', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'prior', 'reviews', 'perhaps', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'loosely', 'based', 'idea', 'Moirae', 'maybe', 'Arachne', 'web', 'fate', 'found', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'even', 'was', 'explanation', 'given', 'film.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'saved', 'being', 'just', 'action', 'film', 'were', 'acting', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'involving', 'hero', 'leading', 'actress', 'just', 'show', 'obligatory', 'sex', 'NOT', 'necessary', 'good', 'film.I', 'think', 'picked', 'just', 'right', 'actor', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'play', 'Gibson', 'ordinary', 'everyday', 'man', 'who', 'victorious', 'when', 'extraordinary', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'happen', 'turn', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'true', 'strength', 'not', 'size', 'muscle', 'character', 'individual.I', 'guess', 'can', 'tell', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'guessing', 'very', 'last', 'scene.But', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'everyone', 'likes', 'different', 'movies', 'so', 'rent', 'buy', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind']",N/A

1197238,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001GKJ2DE,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[21, 27]","WANTED is loosely based on the comic mini-series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones which has been published by Top Cow productions. The movie is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, the filmmaker who gave us the 2 part Russian mystical action series: ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"". I wasn't a fan of those two films so I went in without any expectations. Surprise! This director seemed to have honed his directorial skills; armed with a larger budget, a great cast and a comic series that has a cult following, ""Wanted"" is a visually stunning action movie that redefines the term ""Popcorn Entertainment"".Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is an accountant in a dead end job, with a cheating girlfriend and who is flat broke. One day, he encounters a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who after an encounter with a man named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) takes him to see the head of a secret organization of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". Sloan (Morgan Freeman) has revealed that Gibson's father was a member and that they want him to follow his father's footsteps. Being his father's son, Wesley has a unique ability to pump more adrenaline into his body than a normal person can. Wesley undergoes extensive training both mental and physical to go face to face with the man who supposedly killed his father; Cross. Little does he know that there is more to everything than meets the eye and truths may lead him to question everything he has come to believe.""WANTED"" is an adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced, soda-slurping, hyper-kinetic solid action film that relies on its visual execution. The way it is shot is directed at our visual senses with outlandish action sequences that is both sexy, dynamic and nearly as groundbreaking as the original ""Matrix"". This is definitely the film's main draw as the director immerses you into the sequences that looks enchanting, sexy and downright COOL. Once Bekmambetov sets things up, the audience will be treated to one of the most impressive action sequences I've been privy to less than 5 minutes into the film. It was a great move in part of the director, to wake the viewer up and make sure he has your attention for its entirety with a large exclamation point. The film is not pretentious--it knows exactly what it's aiming for.Now, there is also more to the film that first meets the eye. The film has an effective plotline. These highly trained assassins whose skills borders on being superhuman are not simple killers who get paid to do a job. They depend on mysticism in order to decide who lives and who dies. The tapestry has a close relationship to Norse Mythology's ""Weave of FATE"" According to which, the three Norns were responsible for weaving the future of man and Gods alike. Well, according to Norse Mythology anyway. Some viewers may argue that this may be a little far-fetched that there should always be someone to pull the strings; well, that's where the film also becomes a morality play. The film has bits of the ""revenge"" formula but it doesn't really hurt its proceedings.Wesley Gibson is a simple guy with no ambitions so how does one train him to awaken his hidden capabilities? Simple, first beat the tar out of him. I mean beating him ala-""Fight Club"". This may be a step backward to some, but for me I thought it made sense. Some Zen techniques have proven that pain can be used as a tool to chip away the useless things. Adrenaline can be a magical thing, believe it or not. The filmmakers need to be complemented that they picked an actor like McAvoy instead of an ultra-cool personality like Jason Statham. McAvoy maintained that everyday guy image and I appreciated the fact that the screenwriter took the time to develop his character. Gibson is a pitiable character and I saw how he was molded into a highly skilled assassin which was very admirable. Gibson became a different person and he doesn't look like someone intimidating that would allow him to blend in.It is always good to have Morgan Freeman and having Angelina Jolie around doesn't hurt either. Freeman is his usual sympathetic self and Jolie is her usual mysteriously sexy self. Jolie's character ""Fox"" is a woman driven into the Fraternity for her own reasons. We saw glimpses of her past but it doesn't really explain much about her which maintains her aura of mystery.The film does have its faults and some viewers may say that it follows some ""already"" established formulas; while this may be true, the film does work. Hey, it sure helps when you add an army of lethal rats stoked on peanut butter and explosives. The ""curving"" of bullets theory may seem a bit over the top but hey snipers have been curving a bullet's trajectory when a target is hundreds of yards away. There are also some great bits that comes out of the comic book. The shooting the wings off the fly would satisfy comic book fans. There are nice bits of humor dispersed throughout the film but it abandons it soon enough when the proceedings become all business.""WANTED"" is full of familial vengeance, epiphanies, explosions and rock-solid shoot-outs that borders on insanely cool but also utterly insane. There is an overload of nasty violence and mild gore that would be cause for praise. Shooting through a blown away jugular? Cool. Amid all the violence and comic book mayhem the film finds a soul and the effective twists makes ""Wanted"" a very rewarding experience.Just what happens when you become the one thing you fight against?Highly Recommended!
