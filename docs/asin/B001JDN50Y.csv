I'm not sure I'll remember it forever, but I think this story will stay in my memory banks for a long time. It's a love story so that angle is nothing new. The plot was unique, though, and the two love interests were two very attractive and very likeable people whom I had no trouble cheering for as they walked the circuitous route to discovering that they were in love. This story was a bit contrived, in my opinion, causing me to only rate it four stars. Things like booking an expensive airline ticket to see someone, without calling to ensure they are available bug me. Perhaps I'm too pragmatic to be incurably romantic. The message of the movie involved divorce recovery, a topic for which too many people have first hand experience and a need. This movie can help.",4,It's a keeper.,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,844,"['title', 'flick', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fall', 'trippingly', 'tongue', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'forever', 'think', 'story', 'will', 'stay', 'memory', 'banks', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'nothing', 'new', 'plot', 'was', 'unique', 'though', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'were', 'two', 'very', 'attractive', 'very', 'likeable', 'people', 'whom', 'had', 'trouble', 'cheering', 'walked', 'circuitous', 'route', 'discovering', 'were', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'contrived', 'opinion', 'causing', 'only', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'Things', 'booking', 'expensive', 'airline', 'ticket', 'see', 'someone', 'calling', 'ensure', 'are', 'available', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'too', 'pragmatic', 'be', 'incurably', 'romantic', 'message', 'movie', 'involved', 'divorce', 'recovery', 'topic', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'need', 'movie', 'can', 'help']",N/A

Then about 30-45 minutes in, it slows to a trot and you could take 40 winks and wake up to find you haven't missed a thing. It just creeps along in some places.The guy, Brian (?), is thinking, staring off into space, remembering his 30 year ago ""1st love"" and how much he wishes he had given that relationship a better chance. He's lonely after his divorce. But how many times do we have to go through this dialog?  Me, thinks it is way too many after twice or trice times already. Really slows the whole film down.The new relationship between the girl and boy in recovery could have been played up more.  There is almost a chemistry between them but he drifts back into memory zone much too often, and, it kills the development of their new relationship.I think they could have done a dual walk from both past lovers lives and brought the ""1st Loves"" together as it happened.  You miss some things that may be on the cutting floor but the film is from a true story so maybe it is only told from one side.  I think they could have shortened it about 15 minutes by cutting the day-dreaming and past life reviews after the second run through.The story is interesting but needs lots of help to make it into a better movie.",3,"DVD : Me & You, Us, Forever",1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,1300,"['Well', 'out', 'galloping', 'along', 'drags', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'Then', '30-45', 'minutes', 'trot', 'could', 'take', '40', 'winks', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'have', ""n't"", 'missed', 'thing', 'just', 'along', 'places.The', 'guy', 'Brian', 'thinking', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'remembering', '30', 'year', '1st', 'love', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'given', 'relationship', 'better', 'chance', 'lonely', 'divorce', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'go', 'dialog', 'Me', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'twice', 'trice', 'times', 'already', 'Really', 'whole', 'film', 'down.The', 'new', 'relationship', 'girl', 'boy', 'recovery', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'up', 'more', 'almost', 'chemistry', 'back', 'memory', 'zone', 'much', 'too', 'often', 'development', 'new', 'relationship.I', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'dual', 'walk', 'past', 'lovers', 'lives', 'brought', '1st', 'Loves', 'together', 'happened', 'miss', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'cutting', 'floor', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'so', 'maybe', 'only', 'told', 'one', 'side', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'shortened', '15', 'minutes', 'cutting', 'day-dreaming', 'past', 'life', 'reviews', 'second', 'run', 'through.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'lots', 'help', 'make', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

That's all the story there is in Dave Christiano's feature film debut. The film ignores the ""show, don't tell"" guideline. There's much talk but very little actually happens. We never get to see Dave's divorce; we're only told about it. We get to glimpse Dave and Mary in the 1970s in montage sequences (With no dialogue) but we get to see very little of their relationship; we're mainly told about it. The film mainly consists of five types of scenes: (1) Dave talking to his coworker Paul, (2) Dave talking to his coworker Sue, (3) Dave talking to Carla,  (4) Carla talking to Nikki and (5) Dave visits the support group. And, considering there's barely enough plot here for a short film, the result is dull and repetitive. There's only one scene that manages to engage any emotion and the story may have worked as a short film but as a 101 minute feature film it really doesn't work.",1,Much talk and little plot.
