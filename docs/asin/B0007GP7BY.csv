I actually went out and bought a book about nursery rhymes but neither of my sons seemed interested in hearing them, so I was skeptical about this DVD.  Wow, was I wrong, they love it!  I have heard about the Three Little Kittens so many times that it is permanently stuck in my head!  I cannot believe how many nursery rhymes this DVD offers and it is adorable the little animations they do with each of them.  My sons love to put this on and if they are not mesmerized by it, then they are playing with their toys but have to have this playing in the background.  There is a total of 43 nursery rhymes and most are popular ones that kids love!  This DVD is perfect for kids under 5, and I could even see infants liking the music in the background.  I think nursery rhymes are important for kids because the usually have a good lesson in them and they are just a part of a childhood kids shouldn't miss.  Now with this DVD I am slowly re-learning all the nursery rhymes and singing them to my boys, soon I hope they start singing along with me!",5,Love the music!,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1159,"['Okay', 'so', 'admit', 'am', 'terrible', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'kids', 'was', 'probably', 'little', 'when', 'heard', 'most', 'actually', 'went', 'bought', 'book', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'sons', 'seemed', 'interested', 'hearing', 'so', 'was', 'skeptical', 'DVD', 'Wow', 'was', 'wrong', 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'Three', 'Little', 'Kittens', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'permanently', 'stuck', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'nursery', 'DVD', 'offers', 'adorable', 'little', 'animations', 'do', 'sons', 'love', 'put', 'are', 'not', 'mesmerized', 'then', 'are', 'playing', 'toys', 'have', 'have', 'playing', 'background', 'total', '43', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'most', 'are', 'popular', 'ones', 'kids', 'love', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'kids', '5', 'could', 'even', 'see', 'infants', 'liking', 'music', 'background', 'think', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'are', 'important', 'kids', 'usually', 'have', 'good', 'lesson', 'are', 'just', 'part', 'childhood', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Now', 'DVD', 'am', 'slowly', 're-learning', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'singing', 'boys', 'soon', 'hope', 'start', 'singing', 'along']",N/A

But this one was a bust--- annoying characters, annoying songs, too much stimulation and overall just AWFUL. I thought the rock n roll style would be a nice switch from everything else we had, but I was wrong.  Even my son looked up at us---like, why did you think I would like this?We tried it a couple different times to give it more chances. Each time, disappointed. We won't be playing it again.

This DVD works very well for our 20 month-old son and it is his second-favorite DVD of all time (next to Happy Feet!)An unexpected surprise is that we like it too!  It has all your favorite nursery rhymes with a pop/rock edge to them that makes them just a little more listenable for the adults in the house/car while it is playing.It also has a good message about 911 and how to get help if a child has a serious accident.Overall a solid 5 star purchase for any parent looking for a good children's DVD.,5,My son goes nuts for this DVD!,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,595,"['real', 'world', 'test', 'DVD', 'can', 'capture', 'child', 'attention', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', '20', 'month-old', 'son', 'second-favorite', 'DVD', 'time', 'next', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'like', 'too', 'favorite', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'pop/rock', 'edge', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'listenable', 'adults', 'house/car', 'playing.It', 'also', 'good', 'message', '911', 'how', 'get', 'help', 'child', 'serious', 'accident.Overall', 'solid', '5', 'star', 'purchase', 'parent', 'looking', 'good', 'children', 'DVD']",N/A
