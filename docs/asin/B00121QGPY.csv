Thankfully, George Clooney and Steven Soderberg have teamed up again to co-produce a ""green"" movie with a solid theme. But this time, as I was writing notes for this movie, I noticed that while several characters were being introduced--enough to make my head spin--all my labor was for naught.  For the exposition, although ample, enriched the movie.  The story settles in quickly, and the plot isn't hard to follow.We begin with the titled protagonist (Clooney), known as ""The Janitor,"" a founding member of the law firm Nenner, Bach, and Ledeer.  Despite his prowess, he is the fix-it guy, the one who fixes messes with a cool hand where it's needed most.  It's a thankless job, but he's most suited to do it.  His supervisor, Marty Boch (Sydney Pollack), heaps him with accolades, but not enough cash to keep Michael afloat.  Partly implied are Michael's debts, including from gambling and from a restaurant venture that has folded and is up for auction.Getting a handle on things, Michael is up late at night briefing an important client who had a hit-and-run car accident.  In the midst of this, his late night is protracted by some late night gambling that shows he has the upper hand on his unprofitable addiction.  As he leaves we get the impression someone is following him.  Stopping by the side of a rural road, he comes up to calm some horses until startlingly his parked car explodes.Sporting a thoughtful time frame, the movie backs up four days and shows us some significant developments.  Instead of just being a clever time device, it adds to the suspense of the movie.  It reminded me of a laudable update of something Hitchcock would do.  Backing up we come upon the predictament of Arthur (Tom Wilkinson), a savvy, but unstable lawyer, who is unraveling and leaving Michael almost impotent to remedy his plight.  Off of medication, Arthur is leaving paranoid phone messages and stripping himself naked in public places.  He believes he's had a revelation.  (The contacts he makes with a plaintiff in Wisconsin anchor the movie's plot and poignancy.)  Spending nearly all of his waking hours, he is defending U-North, an agricultural company accused of spreading carcinogenic pesticides by ill plaintiffs.  Tracked by a tough representative, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) is not impressed by ""The Janitor's"" alleged mopping skills, and, indeed, there's plenty of evidence in her favor, noting Arthur's AWOL tactics that come back to hit the firm in the face.`Michael Clayton' contains few flaws.  It has perhaps Clooney's best performance since `Syriana' and  Swinton's marvelous rendition of a cool and calculated villain, reminded me of how skillful an actress she truly is.  (Remembering her wonderful, less subtle role as ""The White Witch"" in `The Chronicles of Narnia,' and having enjoyed her nuanced performance in `Stephanie Daley,' this was another plum performance for her.)  And Wilkinson is thoroughly believable as Arthur.  Without getting too complicated, the details just add more depth to a movie that is captivating and suspenseful from beginning to end.  `Michael Clayton' truly has to be one of the finest films so far this year.",5,Silencing Another 'Silent Spring',1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,3354,"['Going', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'had', 'distinct', 'impression', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'scope', 'Syriana', 'fine', 'movie', 'would', 'leave', 'mentally', 'exhausted', 'once', 'again', 'Thankfully', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'have', 'teamed', 'up', 'again', 'co-produce', 'green', 'movie', 'solid', 'theme', 'time', 'was', 'writing', 'notes', 'movie', 'noticed', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'being', 'introduced', 'enough', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'labor', 'was', 'naught', 'exposition', 'ample', 'enriched', 'movie', 'story', 'settles', 'quickly', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hard', 'follow.We', 'begin', 'titled', 'protagonist', 'Clooney', 'known', 'Janitor', 'founding', 'member', 'law', 'firm', 'Nenner', 'Bach', 'Ledeer', 'prowess', 'fix-it', 'guy', 'one', 'who', 'messes', 'cool', 'hand', 'where', 'needed', 'most', 'thankless', 'job', 'most', 'suited', 'do', 'supervisor', 'Marty', 'Boch', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'accolades', 'not', 'enough', 'cash', 'keep', 'Michael', 'afloat', 'Partly', 'implied', 'are', 'Michael', 'debts', 'including', 'gambling', 'restaurant', 'venture', 'folded', 'up', 'auction.Getting', 'handle', 'things', 'Michael', 'up', 'late', 'night', 'briefing', 'important', 'client', 'who', 'had', 'hit-and-run', 'car', 'accident', 'midst', 'late', 'night', 'protracted', 'late', 'night', 'gambling', 'upper', 'hand', 'unprofitable', 'addiction', 'get', 'impression', 'someone', 'following', 'Stopping', 'side', 'rural', 'road', 'up', 'calm', 'horses', 'startlingly', 'parked', 'car', 'explodes.Sporting', 'thoughtful', 'time', 'frame', 'movie', 'up', 'four', 'days', 'significant', 'developments', 'Instead', 'just', 'being', 'clever', 'time', 'device', 'suspense', 'movie', 'reminded', 'laudable', 'update', 'something', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'do', 'Backing', 'up', 'come', 'predictament', 'Arthur', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'savvy', 'unstable', 'lawyer', 'who', 'unraveling', 'leaving', 'Michael', 'almost', 'impotent', 'remedy', 'plight', 'medication', 'Arthur', 'leaving', 'paranoid', 'phone', 'messages', 'stripping', 'naked', 'public', 'places', 'had', 'revelation', 'contacts', 'plaintiff', 'Wisconsin', 'anchor', 'movie', 'plot', 'poignancy', 'Spending', 'nearly', 'waking', 'hours', 'defending', 'U-North', 'agricultural', 'company', 'accused', 'spreading', 'carcinogenic', 'pesticides', 'ill', 'plaintiffs', 'Tracked', 'tough', 'representative', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'not', 'impressed', 'Janitor', 'alleged', 'mopping', 'skills', 'indeed', 'plenty', 'evidence', 'favor', 'noting', 'Arthur', 'AWOL', 'tactics', 'come', 'back', 'hit', 'firm', 'face.', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'contains', 'few', 'flaws', 'perhaps', 'Clooney', 'best', 'performance', 'Syriana', 'Swinton', 'marvelous', 'rendition', 'cool', 'calculated', 'villain', 'reminded', 'how', 'skillful', 'actress', 'truly', 'Remembering', 'wonderful', 'less', 'subtle', 'role', 'White', 'Witch', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Stephanie', 'Daley', 'was', 'plum', 'performance', 'Wilkinson', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'Arthur', 'getting', 'too', 'complicated', 'details', 'just', 'add', 'more', 'depth', 'movie', 'captivating', 'suspenseful', 'beginning', 'end', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'truly', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'year']",N/A

A reporter calls for information but gets nothing. Men are playing poker, one gets a phone call. Michael Clayton will handle this problem, and drove to Westchester to see a man who is a difficult client. [Some lawyers make house calls to rich clients.] Clayton stops to view some horses; then his car blows up! The story shifts to four days earlier. Michael sells things to raise money, he is in deep debt. He knows people and can arrange things, a ""fixer"". Will this big law firm be bought up by another law firm? [The sequence of scenes is a little confusing.]One lawyer has a problem. Arthur is in jail after he went off his medication. [Is this another industrial disease?] ""I guess that's it."" We learn more about Michael Clayton. The background facts slowly seep out. [The story drags here.] Michael is told to pay up what he owes in one week. Do law firms hire private detectives to check on their employees? ""Then who are you?"" Arthur found out that a farm product can cause cancer in northern climates! ""There's the other way."" They make it look like a suicide. Why was there no note? Michael calls Anna and gets a surprise. Will he investigate on his own? Will somebody call 9-11? There are complications.""We have a situation."" Michael should know how his law firm pays the rent. The story continues, and we see what was done. The story repeats from the beginning [as if to pad out the film]. The suspense picks up. [Is there symbolism in the car brands?] We see what happens next. One lawyer explains the reasons for a settlement this year. Michael talks to Karen and makes a deal. Will there be a surprise and a happy ending?This would be a better film without the confusing sequence of events. Some scenes go nowhere. Overall it's a good story in spite of the many scenes that serve as distractions, or aren't believable. Unneeded scenes drive up costs. One problem is the `suicide' of Arthur. He seemed to die from an overdose of his medication but there would be no pills in his stomach when they did the required autopsy for a violent death. Using Karen as the villain suggests an unusual point of view, or an agenda.

Well every lawyer except your own lawyer, of course. Not the one who got you out of that DUI jam that time you had a little too much, or out from under that drug bust where you were just sitting in that living room, nothing more. Maybe, moving up the chain, when that nasty accident happened and you bailed out with some friendly legal help. And even further up the chain when you, big-time impersonal corporation you, got out from under that very nasty and costly class-action suit stemming from the very real hazardous (cancerous chemical) to somebody, many somebodys, health that you injured, grievously.

Michael Clayton, brought in for just such ""fixing,"" got his hind legs up in the air when his services were not appreciated (and said ace litigator got killed). But here is where it all breaks down.

1134071,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00121QGPY,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Tony Gilroy deserves major props for Michael Clayton - not just because it's his directorial debut, but also for writing the razor sharp screenplay.  (With the Bourne pictures to his credit, he has certainly established his status as an excellent screenwriter, but this is even better and the characters have more nuance and complexity.)  As a thriller, Michael Clayton never drags, and as a complex character study of high-powered people disintegrating it is compelling and credible.Being Bipolar myself, (and having written a book about it), I can assure you that Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of Arthur Edens is dead on and not gratuitous in any way - a refreshing change of pace.  While his dramatic meltdown triggers all subsequent events, he is not alone in having trouble with the mirror.  The film takes us through a spectrum of despicability.  On one end we have the two hit men, coolly dispassionate sharks.  (Actually more ruthless than lawyers!)  Slightly to the right of them is Karen Crowder, (Tilda Swinton).  Her performance deserved the Oscar it received, (although Ms. Crowder is so contemptible as Chief Counsel she may set feminism back a decade or two, confirming men's darkest fears about what happens when women begin to think and act like them).  A wee bit to the right of her is Marty Bach, (Sydney Pollack), who brilliantly embodies the amoral swagger of brutes dedicated to winning at all cost.  Then there is Michael Clayton; the battle for his soul is the film's center.Clooney has been involved in some preachy movies, (Syriana - Good Night, and Good Luck), but this picture avoids that trap.  The chemical company, the law firm's client, is guilty of unspeakable crimes - everyone knows it.  In our legal system, highly paid, smart, resourceful people try their best to help monsters avoid prosecution.  This is not the point of Michael Clayton, simply its atmosphere.  As the film develops we see Clayton coming to terms with what he is.  He is a janitor, a bagman; he has a special gift for cleaning up dirty little messes.  The scene at the film's start, where he's been sent to rescue an obnoxious star client who may have recklessly killed a jogger with his car is one of those ""aha"" moments.  Not pretty.  In the film's riveting climatic scene - the showdown between him and Crowder, Clayton commits at last, he decides what he wants to be.  There is an intensity and magic in that scene rarely encountered in film.Michael Clayton has everything going for it, production value, cinematography, and secondary players.  The cast is thick with talent.  I was surprised by how many faces were familiar to me from watching Law & Order - maybe that's a talent pool that big guys like to fish.

Because so much is revealed in the opening scenes up to the car bombing,and then the four day flashback merely plays out what has already been shown us.I had figured all of it out and was a little bored.The acting,though,is a different story.With all of the focus on George Clooney and Tom Wilkinson,I was frankly more amazed at the adept and frenetic performance of Tilda Swinton.She was the character that really sweated and was nervous.She was the one character that was in conflict the entire time.Clooney's character,especially the gambling backstory, has all been done before and I found the ""loser"" aspect to the story really not necessary to what, for me, could have been a lot more fulfilling.Because I edit for a living,I particularly found the editing of John Gilroy lacking.There were several continuity errors that I noticed that should have been corrected:1. The time frame for the film is 2007.This is established when Tilda Swinton gives us Michael Clayton's resume timeline.""Enetred the law firm in 1990 and has been there for seventeen years, and has yet to made partner?""But,early she says that Clayton was born in 1959.In a later scene Clayton says he is 45 years old.He should have been 48.2. In one of the opening scenes, Clooney is in a discussion with actor Denis O'Hare (so glad to see this Tony Award winning actor getting better film roles these days) who has just been involved in a hit and run.O'Hare is sweating profusely under his armpits and his shirt is quite stained.When this scene is reintroduced at the conclusion of the film, O'Hare is as dry as a bone.These are always fun things to spot, but on a film of this quality, I am surprised they a were overlooked.In conclusion,""Michael Clayton"" was alright,but really offers nothing more than one look.3 +1/2 to 4 stars.",4,"I was surprisingly disappointed in ""Michael Clayton""",1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2091,"['opening', 'such', 'well', 'received', 'reviews', 'recommendations', 'friends', 'have', 'say', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'offered', 'few', 'surprises', 'made', 'made', 'feel', 'much', 'created', 'tension.I', 'found', 'film', 'slowly', 'rose', 'action', 'never', 'kind', 'fevered', 'pitch.Why', 'so', 'much', 'revealed', 'opening', 'car', 'bombing', 'then', 'four', 'day', 'flashback', 'merely', 'out', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'us.I', 'had', 'figured', 'was', 'little', 'bored.The', 'acting', 'different', 'story.With', 'focus', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'was', 'frankly', 'more', 'amazed', 'adept', 'frenetic', 'performance', 'Tilda', 'Swinton.She', 'was', 'character', 'really', 'sweated', 'was', 'nervous.She', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'conflict', 'entire', 'time.Clooney', 'character', 'especially', 'gambling', 'backstory', 'all', 'been', 'done', 'found', 'loser', 'aspect', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'necessary', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'fulfilling.Because', 'edit', 'living', 'particularly', 'found', 'editing', 'John', 'Gilroy', 'were', 'several', 'continuity', 'errors', 'noticed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'corrected:1', 'time', 'frame', 'film', '2007.This', 'established', 'when', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'resume', 'timeline', 'Enetred', 'law', 'firm', '1990', 'been', 'there', 'seventeen', 'years', 'yet', 'made', 'partner', 'early', 'Clayton', 'was', 'born', '1959.In', 'later', 'scene', 'Clayton', '45', 'years', 'old.He', 'should', 'have', 'been', '48.2', 'one', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Clooney', 'discussion', 'actor', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'Tony', 'Award', 'winning', 'actor', 'getting', 'better', 'film', 'roles', 'days', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'involved', 'hit', ""run.O'Hare"", 'sweating', 'profusely', 'armpits', 'shirt', 'quite', 'stained.When', 'scene', 'reintroduced', 'conclusion', 'film', ""O'Hare"", 'as', 'dry', 'bone.These', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'things', 'spot', 'film', 'quality', 'am', 'surprised', 'were', 'overlooked.In', 'conclusion', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'was', 'alright', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'look.3', '+1/2', '4', 'stars']",N/A

It is a tense drama based around corporate intrigue and the use of extra-legal means to achieve a corporate end.  It is a tight, complex but ultimately rewarding film.The role of Michael Clayton is played by George Clooney who is employed by a large New York legal firm as a ""fixer"".  He deals with unusual problems as and when they arise.  In particular, he deals with the case of one of the firm's leading attorneys who seems to undergo some form of mental breakdown.  The attorney disrobes in front of the firm's best corporate client whilst depositions are being taken.  Clayton is brought in to find him and understand what on earth has happened.  In this regard, it is simply a case of a failure to take medication coinciding with a realisation that the client is demonstrably corrupted.As Clayton becomes more involved, his own life is placed in peril.  In fact, an attempt on his life is made at the opening of the film.  The film then goes back four days to bring us to this point.  The film requires some close attention at times but, in the end, a clear outcome is provided.  Corporate corruption gets its comeuppance.""Michael Clayton"" is a very good film.

1134076,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00121QGPY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I can honestly say that I didn't expect to like this movie, not in the least.  The only drawing factor for me was Tom Wilkinson, an actor I adore (his performance in `In the Bedroom' alone is iconic to say the least) but I had heard early word that his performance here was too loud and abrasive and screamed ""give me an Oscar"" and so I shrugged it off as unworthy.  I've never really jumped on the Tilda Swinton bandwagon.  Sure, she has some good performances under her belt but the cult status she has received is beyond me.  Clooney; well all I can really say about Clooney is that a long time ago I loved him so much he could do no wrong, and then the rest of the world fell in love with him and suddenly he lost my interest.  That said, the points for `Michael Clayton' weren't nearly as strong as the points against it and so I passed it over.Then Oscar nominated it for like everything and I thought; ""maybe I need to give this a try.""So give it a try I did and I can now honestly say that it was well worth the time.  `Michael Clayton' is one very well constructed legal thriller that nails the intensity and the chaos that circles events like these.  It reminds me of `A Civil Action' to a degree, yet `Michael Clayton' actually works.  I felt like `A Civil Action' was trying to accomplish something that was out of its league.  `Michael Clayton' does exactly what it sets out to do.Tony Gilroy makes his directorial debut here, working with his own original screenplay.  He's already proven himself a great writer (thanks to the impeccable `Bourne' series) and with `Michael Clayton' he proves he's soon to be a very accomplished director.  He portrays a sense of vulnerability here that suits the film very well, almost contrasting beautifully the states of the main characters.  There are single sequences so startling here you can't help but be drawn deeper and deeper into these people.  Shots of Swinton wrestling her emotions in a bathroom stall or Clooney staring mystified at a group of horses or Wilkinson lying in the fetal position chatting up a little boy; they all add layers of emotional depth to these complex and commanding characters.The film revolves around a `fixer' by the name of Michael Clayton.  Michael is the go-to-guy for messes his law firm wants cleaned up quickly and efficiently.  Michael ends up biting off more than he can chew when he is sent to clean up a certain mess left by his colleague and friend Arthur Edens.  Arthur has recently suffered from a mental breakdown and embarrassed the company by stripping nude during a legal proceeding.  Turns out that Edens has been reviewing a certain case in his head for some time and has come to the realization that his company has single handedly murdered many innocent people.  He just couldn't play party to the crimes anymore and is now determined to set things right.  The problem is though that there are many who want to keep him quiet.`Michael Clayton' manages to keep the viewer glued to the edge of their seats in anticipation for the next scene.  This has a lot to do with the amazing performances given by the cast.  We'll start with Clooney; an actor who I feel is a little over praised as of late.  His performance here is his finest performance since his turn in the Coen's `O Brother Where Art Thou?'.  He shows strength masked over by his vulnerability.  We can see all of Michael's personal demons yet we see his courage and determination that make him the man he is.  Swinton, or should I say `Oscar Winner' Tilda Swinton, is a force here.  She has limited screen time but she manages to work beautiful wonders with the character of Karen Crowder.  I was astounded by her range here, her ability to completely control a scene, and her final breakdown is pure magic; watching her character crumble under the knowledge of her inevitable exposure is so natural, so strong.  When she hits her knees, while only a background and blurred image, she is the only thing you can focus on.Tom Wilkinson doesn't show up for nearly thirty minutes yet his presence haunts the screen long before his figure does.  His voice over work which permeates the first twenty or so minutes of the film is pure brilliance.  I have heard his performance noted as hammed up or eccentric but I for I feel that he gave this film exactly what it needed.  He was convincing and mesmerizing to watch.  Watching his character explode with over confidence and determination and then shrink back in depressive fear and self pity was an astonishing feat.In the end `Michael Clayton' is one of the best films of the year.  I'm astounded at the impeccable lineup presented by the Academy this year; it's a rare treat when they actually nominate worthy films.  If you have been wary about watching this film, fearing that it'll wind up being `Law & Order' light and thus be unsatisfactory, please wipe those fears away and dive in, for `Michael Clayton' is one of those rare treats that delivers on just about every level.",5,Needs no fixing;

1134077,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00121QGPY,Andy Orrock,"[2, 4]","This is a brilliant movie, by far the best thing I saw in 2007.  I had read that Tony Gilroy sold this movie with an entire pitch consisting of something along the lines of ""It's a movie about lawyers, but it never goes near a courtroom.""  What he ended up with - from that sparse beginning - is fantastic.  George Clooney defines what being a movie star is all about.  He's incredible here.  The overwork and self-loathing on his un-Clooney-like face is palpable, never more so than in the opening scenes.  Giroy's sequencing of that intro - fronting the car bombing, then circling back to it by re-capping the previous four days - was a pitch-perfect editing decision.  The movie graps you by the lapels at that point and literally never lets go.  And, as another recent reviewer points out, this is a movie that doesn't feel the need to spell everything out for you.  It respects your intelligence.Other than Clooney, the other standout here is Tom Wilkinson as Arthur Edens, a bipolar lawyer off his meds.  Just when you think he's completely gone, he slips in slivers of extreme focus and clarity.  In particular, there's the alleyway scene in which Wilkinson tells Clooney that the only chance he had to commit him was in Wisconsin (where his character flips out in the middle of a deposition) and not in New York.  Wilkinson is masterful here - in a very subtle way, he reveals himself as as the legendary lawyer the others speak about with reverence.Another reason why I like this movie so much: in places like Slate and elsewhere online, I've read how this film resonated with many, many lawyers, who found its depiction of the large firm at the center of the case very reflective of their lives.

Is this movie worth the hype. I love George Clooney, in spite of the fact that I disagree with about everything he says politically. He's a great actor. He's great again as the star in Michael Clayton. Michael Clayton is a lawyer for a big firm whose biggest client happens to be U-North. U-North has been involved in a class action suit for six long years. Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, U-North's in-house cousel. Authur Edens (played incredibly well by Tom Wilkinon) is the conflicted leat attorney in U-North's fight agaist the class action suit.When you get right down to it, this movie is a legal thriller. The plot gets thrown to you in pieces. The movie opens with a few scenes then backtracks to four days earlier. As a viewer, I wondered a lot what was going on. The movie got the suspese right, but unfortunately treated every scene like a supsense scene. I spent a lot of time wondering what was going on. Michael Clayton is a fixer that handles the firm's biggest problems. He has gambling problems, a kid that he sees occasionally, and a brother who has lost a lot of money to some thugs that Clayton is trying to repay. Arthur is having doubts about the case he is trying to win and has gone off his medication. Is he going crazy, or does he know what he's doing. Oscar winner Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder, as U-North's counsel, will do anything to win.I had a lot of problems with this movie. It was incredibly slow, and the entire movie seemed evasive. It couldn't just come out and tell the story. The acting was top notch, except for Tilda Swinton. She seemed to play a one note character as a woman constantly in physical pain about the decisions she had to make.I was glad to see a ""traditional"" movie like Michael Clayton nominated for an Oscar instead of the usual foreign or left-wing politcal drivel that the general public never sees. However, Michael Clayton just doesn't seem like that good of a movie.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","If there was ever any doubt that George Clooney (Good Night and Good Luck) is more than just a pretty face, MICHAEL CLAYTON should put them to rest. Although women across the world will probably still drool at his magnetism here in this film, he pulls this engrossing movie along and carries most -- if not all -- of its weight.The story surrounds a pair of attorneys, Michael Clayton (Clooney) and Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson,The Exorcism of Emily Rose) who are employed as ""janitors"" at a powerhouse law firm. The ""janitor lawyers"" clean up messes left by their clients. But when Arthur (Wilkinson) appears to have a mental break during a multimillion dollar negotiations with a pesticide company (shades ofThe Future of Fooddocumentary and the Monsanto Corporation are easily seen), Michael is sent in to try and clean up the debacle. But big business, along with Arthur and Michael's firm, are concerned and have clean-up ideas of their own. Hit men, the burning of document warehouses, and even exploding cars are not beyond the realm of dangers facing Mr. Clayton.Definitely in the vein ofErin Brockovich, but this film's focus is not on the ones represented by the attorney's firm and, instead, on the attorneys themselves. Morality and money are the two at-odds items, which is also nothing new to film. But what holds Michael Clayton together is the powerful performances by Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton (The Chronicles of Narnia), and, of course, Mr. Clooney. Wilkinson's disastrous decent into seeming madness holds a kernel of sympathy and understanding for the viewer. His life, decade upon decade, has been devoted to making and saving money for his firm, but at what moral cost? Coming to the end of his career, the weight of his decisions are heavy upon him and we can feel his dire wish to find a smidgin of good in his final days (""I am Shiva, the god of death."")Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, the firm's new lead attorney for the case abandoned by Arthur (Wilkinson). Her need to win the case overpowers commonsense and even legalities and, in the end, gets the better of her.And then there's Michael Clayton (Clooney) who sees much of himself in Arthur, wondering if this is what awaits him at the end of his career. But there's also Michael's personal life that infringes upon the entire story loop. His son Henry (Austin Williams,The Good Shepherd) wants desperately to connect with his father but both have trouble finding common ground; Michael because of his forced amount of time on the job, and Henry because of a fantasy life (see role playing game) that he wants to include his father in. Michael's old gambling habit has also reemerged causing him many a financial woe and forcing another morality play that bites him in the bum when asking for an advance from his boss.The downsides to the film are that it's pretty standard Hollywood fodder as far as movies go, and the ending was a bit too tidy and convenient. I never understood how Michael knew where to find Karen Crowder and when she'd be having a meeting with ""the big client"".Even so, this is a good character story with enough good dialogue and great acting to keep most watchers entertained.

This is a character driven film, something our tiny attention span society seems unable to cope with. OK, the premise was not original, but the treatment of it was brilliant. Every character here was being crushed by the weight of a society requiring that they behave against their natural human instincts. The script, the acting, the music and direction all combined to create a crushing, yet entertaining, indictment of what society demands from us if we are to retain its `respect' as dutiful, acquisitive, non-questioning consumers.It was not perfect by any means and the ending was a little neat, but this is Hollywood.

1134095,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00121QGPY,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 14]","""Michael Clayton"" is a magnetic, engaging film, with a plot so intriguing that you find yourself absorbed within the first five minutes. Here's a story that can't be defined by a single genre; while it is above all a drama, so much more is being presented. Parts of it work like a thriller while other parts work like a social commentary, and these in turn make for a pseudo-morality play that requires a little extra observance on the audience's part. And that's a good thing, simply because not all stories should make everything clear. This film is intelligent, not only because the plot relies on strategic obscurity, but also because logical thinking is needed in order to understand it. This is not an escapist film--absolutely nothing will be hand delivered to us.George Clooney plays the title character, and he gives Clayton a restrained yet powerful presence that was truly fascinating. This is no small task, considering the direction his life is going in: Clayton was once a highly respected trail lawyer, but his talent for negotiating has reduced him to take an unrecognized, poorly paid position. He basically does the dirty work for one of New York's most prestigious law firms, co-owned by Marty Bach (Sidney Pollack). Clayton cleans up legal messes by talking directly to plaintiffs and defendants and striking up deals. Clayton considers himself a janitor, a Mr. Fix-It, a miracle worker; he bends the rules in exactly the right ways to avoid exactly the right people. When it comes to other people's problems, he's the one everyone turns to.But when it comes to his own problems, he needs a lot of help. A gambling addiction is established, as are financial problems--he owes quite a bit of money on a failing bar, which is co-owned by his drug-addicted brother, Timmy (David Lansbury). For obvious reasons, Clayton was forced to finance the business by himself, which required him to hock virtually every item he owned. On the bright side, he has a fairly good relationship with his son, Henry (Austin Williams), who greatly enjoys reading fantasy novels. Clayton drives Henry to school one morning, and on the way, Henry raves about the book he's reading, explaining each character's significance with childish zeal; Clayton listens, realizing that his son is actually giving an insightful description of life in general. It was a brief but wonderful scene proving how casual profound statements can seem.The film's main focus is a legal dispute between Clayton's law firm and a chemical company (which happens to be Bach's most important client). Coming to its defense is Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), a litigator whose career depends on negotiating a multimillion-dollar settlement. But this will not be so easy to accomplish; attorney Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) complicates matters by interfering with the case. He believes that the chemical company is responsible for poisoning the population, and he claims to have the evidence to prove it. Because his conscience is guilt-ridden over keeping his mouth shut, he loses his rational state of mind, becoming a manic, paranoid, and seemingly incomprehensible wreck. A severe emotional spasm was caught on tape--while at work in Milwaukee, he stripped completely naked, after which he ran through the parking lot.Thus begins a taut, suspenseful, and compelling quest for the truth. Part of the quest leads to the discovery of Anna (Merritt Wever), a young woman who lost some of her family to the chemical poisoning. For some bizarre reason, Edens feels responsible for her, and he shows this through incessant phone calls and cryptic messages. Clayton is initially unwilling to believe anything Edens has to say, simply because he's acting erratically. But as the film progresses, he begins to question himself. Could Edens have been on to something? Is it possible that his odd conversations were more than mere ramblings? Was he sane, after all? Unbeknownst to Clayton, getting the answers to these questions will mean endangering Edens' life.Crowder, meanwhile, is busy on her own quest, which turns out to be more stressful than she anticipated. There are key shots in this film showing her in panic mode: she hyperventilates in a hotel bathroom, her hands shaking, her armpits soaked with sweat. There are also moments of her standing in front of a mirror, practicing her speeches; most of these shots are inter-cut with actual meetings, in which a subtle yet significant lack of confidence undermines her delivery. Swinton made this character her own, turning Crowder into one of the film's most fascinating characters. A quiet desperation is visible on her face, and it's obvious that she's trying to hide it. She wants to be a professional: shrewd, capable, and strong-willed, unwilling to back down from a challenge.The fact that I can gather this much from so few characters is a good sign. A clear, specific level of character development is vital for a film like ""Michael Clayton,"" especially since the genre spectrum is broad. Well-defined characters make for a much more engrossing story; thank goodness this film includes a number of them. And despite what some people say, a complicated plot is not necessarily a deterrent. This film proves that some stories need to be richly detailed, if not for clarity, then for establishing the climactic finish. The ending of ""Michael Clayton"" is one of the year's most satisfying, a perfect blend of deception and emotional resolution. That alone makes the film worth recommending.",5,The Miracle Worker,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,5513,"['Michael', 'Clayton', 'magnetic', 'engaging', 'film', 'plot', 'so', 'intriguing', 'find',

1134099,A1N4CJO76GFKVG,B00121QGPY,"Clayton Self ""Clayton S""","[0, 1]","After a second viewing of Tony Gilroy's ""Michael Clayton,"" I realize that the key to understanding the entire film is in Tom Wilkinson's opening monologue.  His character, Arthur Edens, speaks over shots of city scapes and empty lobbys about....well about what?  We're not yet sure.  What he seems to be sure of, however, is that he is covered in a metaphorical ""goo"" that he describes as afterbirth and through the seemingly paranoid rambling, we realize he is referring to shady dealings of a law firm; the law firm where he is employed.Indeed, the entire movie seems to be covered in this ""goo.""  This is a dark, murky, paranoid thriller that starts out paranoid, and stays that way to the closing credits.  Tony Gilroy, writer and co-writer of the ""Bourne"" films, crafts a screenplay here where the driving force of the plot is buried just beneathe the surface.  Michael Clayton's job as the firm's ""janitor"" is to keep secrets and messes from getting out, and so the screenplay serves well at keeping this same information from the audience, yet Michael isn't sure he knows what the information is, nor does he want to know.  Clooney plays Michael Clayton as a man who has seen the peak of his career and is now in a position the firm essentially forced him into.  He doesn't ask alot of questions about what the firm asks him to clean up; he just evaluates the level of the mess and acts with promptness and a thinking man's logic.Curious are his conversations with Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), the head of the law firm.  Pay attention to what is said and what is not said whenever Michael approaches him with information he thinks is news to the firm; let's just say that Bach almost always already knows, and this makes Michael begin to think that perhaps Arthur wasn't crazy after all.To give away what Arthur knows, and what Michael slowly uncovers would diminish the joy of seeing th film for the first time.  This is a clever script that does a great job of allowing the audience to uncover the information as Michael does.  The plot provides a literally explosive introduction to Michael's world and then jumps to 4 days prior to set up the moments we've already witnessed.  We see what he sees and hear what he hears at first, until the plot catches up with itself and we see the opening moments from another point of view.This films hits DVD just in time for people to make an informed decision on the three oscar contenders it has provided; George Clooney for Best Actor, Tom Wilkinson for Best Supporting actor and Tilda Swinton for Best Supporting Actress.  George Clooney has been doing great work lately, proving himself as a master of all trades, be it producer, director or actor.  See also his activism in the powerful documentary ""Darfur Now.""  Swinton, we already know can play a great antagonist, and she provides good work here as Karen Crowder, a woman who values corporate secrets over human life.This film is a splenid directorial debut for Tony Gilroy, who structures the film in a slick, paranoid and murky way.  The script is as good as any this year for the Best Original screenplay oscar, but perhaps hasn't generated the buzz that ""Juno"" has.  Too bad, because this is an intense, smart thriller and is one of the year's best films.",5,This film does not look like it's negotiating...,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,3268,"['second', 'viewing', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'realize', 'key', 'understanding', 'entire', 'film', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'opening', 'monologue', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'shots', 'city', 'scapes', 'empty', 'lobbys', '.well', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', 'sure', 'What', 'be', 'sure', 'however', 'covered', 'metaphorical', 'goo', 'afterbirth', 'seemingly', 'paranoid', 'rambling', 'realize', 'referring', 'shady', 'dealings', 'law', 'firm', 'law', 'firm', 'where', 'employed.Indeed', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'covered', 'goo', 'dark', 'murky', 'paranoid', 'thriller', 'out', 'paranoid', 'stays', 'way', 'closing', 'credits', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'writer', 'co-writer', 'Bourne', 'films', 'crafts', 'screenplay', 'here', 'where', 'driving', 'force', 'plot', 'buried', 'just', 'beneathe', 'surface', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'job', 'firm', 'janitor', 'keep', 'secrets', 'messes', 'getting', 'out', 'so', 'screenplay', 'well', 'keeping', 'same', 'information', 'audience', 'yet', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'information', 'want', 'know', 'Clooney', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'peak', 'career', 'now', 'position', 'firm', 'essentially', 'forced', ""n't"", 'ask', 'alot', 'questions', 'what', 'firm', 'clean', 'up', 'just', 'level', 'mess', 'acts', 'promptness', 'thinking', 'man', 'logic.Curious', 'are', 'conversations', 'Marty', 'Bach', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'head', 'law', 'firm', 'Pay', 'attention', 'what', 'said', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'whenever', 'Michael', 'information', 'news', 'firm', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Bach', 'almost', 'always', 'already', 'Michael', 'begin', 'think', 'perhaps', 'Arthur', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'all.To', 'give', 'away', 'what', 'Arthur', 'what', 'Michael', 'slowly', 'uncovers', 'would', 'diminish', 'joy', 'seeing', 'th', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'clever', 'script', 'great', 'job', 'allowing', 'audience', 'uncover', 'information', 'Michael', 'plot', 'literally', 'explosive', 'introduction', 'Michael', 'world', 'then', 'jumps', '4', 'days', 'prior', 'set', 'up', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'already', 'witnessed', 'see', 'what', 'hear', 'what', 'first', 'plot', 'up', 'see', 'opening', 'moments', 'point', 'view.This', 'films', 'DVD', 'just', 'time', 'people', 'make', 'informed', 'decision', 'three', 'oscar', 'contenders', 'provided', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'actor', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'George', 'Clooney', 'been', 'doing', 'great', 'work', 'lately', 'proving', 'master', 'trades', 'be', 'producer', 'director', 'actor', 'See', 'also', 'activism', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'Darfur', 'Now', 'Swinton', 'already', 'know', 'can', 'play', 'great', 'antagonist', 'good', 'work', 'here', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'woman', 'who', 'corporate', 'secrets', 'human', 'life.This', 'film', 'splenid', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'who', 'film', 'slick', 'paranoid', 'murky', 'way', 'script', 'as', 'good', 'year', 'Best', 'Original', 'screenplay', 'oscar', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'generated', 'buzz', 'Juno', 'Too', 'bad', 'intense', 'smart', 'thriller', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films']",N/A

1134101,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00121QGPY,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","It's unlikely that Michael Clayton will ever be shown in one of Harvard Law School's required ethics-for-lawyers classes (if it has any). We learn far more about the ethical practices of high-priced Wall Street law firms and the corporate lawyers who hire them than the whole well-dressed, well-manicured and well-housed gang would want us to know. And despite the McGuffin being an obvious bit of Hollywood political correctness, and despite being too long with too many extraneous acting bits thrown in for George Clooney, the movie's star, Michael Clayton still delivers the goods as a solid legal conspiracy thriller. Except for all those bits -- Michael's relationship with his angelic son, Michael's relationship with his druggie brother, Michael's relationship with a nice gang messenger, Michael's relationship with poker and Michael's angst over not being made a partner -- the mechanics of the conspiracy and the quality of the acting carries us along. I just wish the movie had been tighter and shorter.George Clooney as Clayton does a superior job that keeps us involved with the story. His job at his law firm has been to clean up messes. He's no miracle worker, he says, he's a janitor. Equally fine performances come from Tom Wilkinson as an attack lawyer, a partner in the law firm where Clayton works, who goes off the rails (when he goes off his meds) and, of all things, starts to help the good guys; Tilda Swinton as the murderous chief counsel for a huge chemical firm which produces an insecticide with an unfortunate side effect, cancer; and Sidney Pollack as the law firm's head, a man who knows what it takes to insure the bills are paid and that he and his lawyers get their bonuses. It's not long before Clayton finds himself up to his torts in hardball lawyering as he tries to deal with a friend who seems to be in the middle of a mental collapse. All the while he's pressured by the needs of a multi-million dollar criminal suit against that chemical company, which his firm is defending. It doesn't help when a couple of blonde assassins enter the scene.The PC nature of the McGuffin -- killer chemicals sold by a huge industrial company -- reeks of Hollywood righteousness. For me, it was irritating. I certainly don't recommend trusting big companies any more than I'd recommend trusting high priced lawyers, but I wanted a thriller, not a lecture by rich Hollywood writers and stars. Besides, Erin Brockovich had already mined that chemical load earlier. To the movie's credit, not much time is spent with the McGuffin itself. It provides the cause of the plot, but it could have been just about anything. What helps us forget the PC nature of the McGuffin is the quality acting by Clooney, Wilkinson, Swinton and Pollack.

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 2]","Tony Gilroy, who has scripted all three Jason Bourne adaptations recently and helped revive the spy genre, has his directorial debut of his script in Michael Clayton, and the results are nothing short of spectacular with a story that harkens back to the conspiracy laden, morality plays of the 1970's and passionate acting to boot by a strong cast.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a fixer of problems for a leading law firm which experiences a crisis as its leading legal mind, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has a breakdown as he defends an industrial giant, U-North, from a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.  U-North's corporate counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) grows worried and later realizes that Edens may have some other agenda in mind, a trump card of sorts, that may threaten U-North, and she orders a couple of men to eliminate the problem.  Add to this Clayton's own woes as he owes loan sharks big money.  As Clayton attempts to help Edens, a tragedy occurs which reverberates with Clayton's own values and tests his resolve to delve deeper into an insidious world of corporate greed and murder.  How far he is willing to go to save his own skin or find justice even if it risks his well being brings him to a defining point in his life.You know this movie has a high minded agenda and stamp of quality when some of the producers include Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich), Sydney Pollack (Absence of Malice), Anthony Minghella (The English Patient), and Clooney (Syriana) himself.  Production values from camerawork to music are all topflight.  Gilroy proves a sure-handed director and the film feels like the work of a veteran director of thrillers in the mode of The Insider or any John Grisham adaptation. like The Firm.Clooney does a very good job as Clayton, a man who solves problems for a law firm.  A smart, talented man who knows the legal business, he also is human with a mysterious past.  He is far from perfect with shortcomings including a gambling problem and debt, which makes him more identifiable to the audience.  Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom) is quite convincing with his American accent as the legal giant who has apparently lost his mind (like Bulworth or Network's Howard Beale), and Tilda Swinton's company woman, is so good, you wish there were more of her.  Swinton's talent is on the rise after such films as The Deep End.  Sydney Pollack has been displaying his acting chops lately and proves to be equally adept at character roles (Tootsie, Eyes Wide Shut) as he is at directing.The film is quite strong and when it reaches its bravura, concluding scene, it rises to the occasion and elevates the plot to lofty heights and rarefied air.  It is a supremely crowd pleasing moment and cinches Michael Clayton as not only an interesting thriller and mystery, but an intelligent, literate morality play highlighting a talented writer now director and its ever shining star.",4,MICHAEL CLAYTON and His Conscience,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,2914,"['Tony', 'Gilroy', 'who', 'scripted', 'three', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'adaptations', 'recently', 'helped', 'revive', 'spy', 'genre', 'directorial', 'debut', 'script', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'results', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'story', 'back', 'conspiracy', 'laden', 'morality', 'plays', '1970', 'passionate', 'acting', 'boot', 'strong', 'cast.Michael', 'Clayton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'fixer', 'problems', 'leading', 'law', 'firm', 'crisis', 'leading', 'legal', 'mind', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'breakdown', 'industrial', 'giant', 'U-North', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'lawsuit', 'U-North', 'corporate', 'counsel', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'worried', 'later', 'Edens', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'agenda', 'mind', 'trump', 'card', 'sorts', 'may', 'threaten', 'U-North', 'orders', 'couple', 'men', 'eliminate', 'problem', 'Add', 'Clayton', 'own', 'woes', 'loan', 'sharks', 'big', 'money', 'Clayton', 'help', 'Edens', 'tragedy', 'Clayton', 'own', 'values', 'resolve', 'delve', 'deeper', 'insidious', 'world', 'corporate', 'greed', 'murder', 'How', 'far', 'willing', 'go', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'find', 'justice', 'even', 'well', 'being', 'brings', 'defining', 'point', 'life.You', 'know', 'movie', 'high', 'minded', 'agenda', 'stamp', 'quality', 'when', 'producers', 'include', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Absence', 'Malice', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'English', 'Patient', 'Clooney', 'Syriana', 'Production', 'values', 'camerawork', 'music', 'are', 'topflight', 'Gilroy', 'sure-handed', 'director', 'film', 'feels', 'work', 'veteran', 'director', 'thrillers', 'mode', 'Insider', 'John', 'Grisham', 'adaptation', 'Firm.Clooney', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Clayton', 'man', 'who', 'problems', 'law', 'firm', 'smart', 'talented', 'man', 'who', 'legal', 'business', 'also', 'human', 'mysterious', 'past', 'far', 'perfect', 'shortcomings', 'including', 'gambling', 'problem', 'debt', 'more', 'identifiable', 'audience', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bedroom', 'quite', 'convincing', 'American', 'accent', 'legal', 'giant', 'who', 'apparently', 'lost', 'mind', 'Bulworth', 'Network', 'Howard', 'Beale', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'company', 'woman', 'so', 'good', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'Swinton', 'talent', 'rise', 'such', 'films', 'Deep', 'End', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'been', 'displaying', 'acting', 'chops', 'lately', 'be', 'equally', 'adept', 'character', 'roles', 'Tootsie', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'directing.The', 'film', 'quite', 'strong', 'when', 'bravura', 'concluding', 'scene', 'occasion', 'plot', 'lofty', 'heights', 'rarefied', 'air', 'supremely', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'moment', 'cinches', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'not', 'only', 'interesting', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'intelligent', 'literate', 'morality', 'play', 'highlighting', 'talented', 'writer', 'now', 'director', 'ever', 'shining', 'star']",N/A

Well, something has just come up that's completely out of his league: A senior partner, one of the firm's most respected members, has gone crazy, in the midst of a devastating lawsuit.  But is he really crazy?  Or could he be onto the truth...I really give this movie 4 1/2 stars.  I don't know why I'm not giving it five; maybe I should.  I'll leave that up to you--four or five stars, right now it doesn't make much difference.  I loved this movie, and I'm pretty sure you will to, if this is your bag.

In fact, you can make an argument that this isn't even a legal thriller.What drives this movie is one thing: acting.  Let's start with Tom Wilkinson, who delivers a knockout performance.  Tilda Swinton is also amazing; she's not too sympathetic (would've liked to have seen a bit more character depth) but she makes the absolute best of what she's been given.  The real star of course is George Clooney (when isn't he?).  His performance as the title character is probably one of his best yet.  It's a hard role to play--he isn't exactly a ""good"" guy, yet has to be sympathetic to the audience--but he nails it perfectly.  And when Swinton and Clooney go head-to-head in the climactic scene...wow.  That's a doozy of a climax; I'd love to see an action movie, with all their bullets and explosions, top the fire in Clooney's eyes.

1134104,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B00121QGPY,Danielle Turchiano,"[2, 2]","In Hollywood, a ""fixer"" is someone who is brought in to clean up another filmmaker's mess, referring more often than not, to Script Doctoring to create snappier, more succinct dialogue.  Screenwriter Tony Gilroy's quietly observant style would lend itself well to such a task, molding a mature subject matter in such a way that he exposes the grit beneath a situation unnervingly but always allows his audience to draw their own conclusions. Not to imply Gilroy based ""Michael Clayton"" off his own experiences within the entertainment industry, it still comes as no surprise that his directorial debut would feature a title character who is somewhat of a fixer himself.As a man with dollar signs in his eyes, George Clooney's Clayton is the guy his powerful corporate New York law firm goes to when they need a problem to go away.  ""Michael Clayton"" centers on a three-billion-dollar class-action lawsuit that goes wrong when the firm's best litigator (Tom Wilkinson), himself, unravels.  The firm doesn't want to win the case, but it is instead obsessed with generating as many billable hours as they can by leaving it hanging like a 2004 Chad.  Enter Clayton.Clooney plays the sure-of-himself power player with his usual crooked smile and cockeyed charm but also increasing awareness that he is selling his soul to a company that has no qualms about eliminating him with as much ease as he eliminates their problems.  What is unique about ""Michael Clayton"" is that Gilroy allows his audience an inside look at Michael Clayton, the man, and Clooney is allowed to explore the conflicting sides to his character.  When he is with his brothers (Sean Cullen and David Lansbury), both who are just working guys, he comes across as extremely down-to-Earth-- a regular guy who has his troubles just like anyone.  However, scenes which have him face off against the head of the firm (Sydney Pollack) illustrate an almost cartoonish legend of a man--- someone who has been immersed in such extreme circumstances for so long they begin to believe some of the hype.  Gilroy makes the very bold, very apparent political statement that we are all capable of corruption and greed with a certain amount of power.""Michael Clayton"" was produced by Clooney's own Section 8, a production company also partially owned by Steven Soderbergh and both men seemed to have greatly influenced Gilroy's directing style here as the film's timeline is fragmented, creating a much more intensely suspenseful thriller.",4,A Piece Of Art Emerges From A Corporate-Driven Industry,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2487,"['Hollywood', 'fixer', 'someone', 'who', 'brought', 'clean', 'up', 'filmmaker', 'mess', 'referring', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Script', 'Doctoring', 'create', 'snappier', 'more', 'succinct', 'dialogue', 'Screenwriter', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'quietly', 'observant', 'style', 'would', 'lend', 'well', 'task', 'molding', 'mature', 'subject', 'matter', 'such', 'way', 'grit', 'situation', 'unnervingly', 'always', 'audience', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Not', 'imply', 'Gilroy', 'based', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'own', 'experiences', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'still', 'surprise', 'directorial', 'debut', 'would', 'feature', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'somewhat', 'fixer', 'himself.As', 'man', 'dollar', 'signs', 'eyes', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Clayton', 'guy', 'powerful', 'corporate', 'New', 'York', 'law', 'firm', 'when', 'need', 'problem', 'go', 'away', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'centers', 'three-billion-dollar', 'class-action', 'lawsuit', 'wrong', 'when', 'firm', 'best', 'litigator', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'unravels', 'firm', ""n't"", 'want', 'win', 'case', 'instead', 'obsessed', 'generating', 'many', 'billable', 'hours', 'can', 'leaving', 'hanging', '2004', 'Chad', 'Enter', 'Clayton.Clooney', 'sure-of-himself', 'power', 'player', 'usual', 'crooked', 'smile', 'cockeyed', 'charm', 'also', 'increasing', 'awareness', 'selling', 'soul', 'company', 'qualms', 'eliminating', 'as', 'much', 'ease', 'problems', 'What', 'unique', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Gilroy', 'audience', 'inside', 'look', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'man', 'Clooney', 'allowed', 'explore', 'conflicting', 'sides', 'character', 'When', 'brothers', 'Sean', 'Cullen', 'David', 'Lansbury', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'working', 'guys', 'extremely', 'down-to-Earth', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'troubles', 'just', 'anyone', 'However', 'scenes', 'have', 'face', 'off', 'head', 'firm', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'illustrate', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'legend', 'man', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'immersed', 'such', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'so', 'long', 'begin', 'believe', 'hype', 'Gilroy', 'very', 'bold', 'very', 'apparent', 'political', 'statement', 'are', 'capable', 'corruption', 'greed', 'certain', 'amount', 'power', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'was', 'produced', 'Clooney', 'own', 'Section', '8', 'production', 'company', 'also', 'partially', 'owned', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'men', 'seemed', 'have', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'Gilroy', 'directing', 'style', 'here', 'film', 'timeline', 'fragmented', 'creating', 'much', 'more', 'intensely', 'suspenseful', 'thriller']",N/A

The writing and acting were great, making the movie well worth watching. Wilkinson made you feel for his character, a lawyer defending a dirty corporation whose work - both the long, difficult hours and the very nature of it - and family troubles had taken their toll. Naturally, you root for Clooney's character, a flawed lawyer who isn't properly recognized for his work because of the type of work he does, cleaning up other people's messes. The movie demonstrates extremes of how evil a corporation can be, without beating you over the head with the message that corporations are bad. My problem with the movie is that while it is very well done and isn't your typical lawyer movie, it is still predictable.

I thought the legal arena on film had been definitely tackled by Sidney Lumet's ""The Verdict"" some 25 years ago.  Boy, was I wrong!  Without entering a courtroom except for a filmed deposition this film casts a jaundiced eye on the legal profession that knocks you for a loop.  The film centers on a prestigious law firm as it prepares the defense of a multi-national in a class action lawsuit.  Michael Clayton(George Clooney) is the firms fixer, a lawyer who handles the more unsavory aspects of a case without sullying the firm's reputation.  Though Clayton is a flawed individual he starts to have doubts about his activities.  This is heightened when a manic-depressive colleague(Tom Wilkinson) who is the chief defender in the lawsuit begins to display erratic behavior.  Clayton is not so much redeemed in this film but he wants to erradicate some of the muck that he wallows in.  This is bar none Clooney's best performance.  He's called on here to play a seriously flawed person and yet engender sympathy from the audience.  It's not a mannered work but a carefully modulated one.  The real revelation here is Wilkinson, though.  Many actors have chewed the scenery playing characters with mental problems but Wilkinson plumbs the depth of Arthur to deliver a highly sympathetic and humane performance.  Judging Wilkinson's work here I would have given him the Oscar over Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"".  By an eyelash.

I guess I thought he was some real guy, like McCarthy or Charlie Wilson, but I didn't expect it to be a pseudo-legal thriller. Maybe I thought it was a historical biopic. Anyway, I watched it over a few evenings this week, and I actually did enjoy it. A friend really didn't enjoy it and couldn't stay awake, but I found the triumvirate of Swinton, Clooney, and Wilkinson well performed. To begin, I am still trying to wrap my mind around the frame of Clayton (Clooney) standing on the hillside with the three horses as if he's the fourth horseman of the Apocalypse (the dark one even), and I enjoyed that he was this ""ghost"" that no one really knew. Albeit I found the narrative characters of his brother and sister's husband as almost banal, needed plot carriers (the cop who helps him and the drunkard who saves him). Clooney was fine in the film, but I found his substory of owning the restaurant and owing the money almost detracting from the main story, and I wish I understood more about his son's book in terms of Wilkinson's character of Arthur. Moreover, the relationship Clooney had with his soon wasn't fleshed out whatsoever, although I think I still liked the film.SPOILER Coming..... Perhaps the two shining stars in an otherwise average film were Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton. Swinton's lawyer begins the narrative obviously distraught about some thing (which it seems turns out to be ordering Wilkinson's death), and concludes the narrative in a fetal ball of failure and despair, while Wilkinson's overly neurotic, off medicated maniac was played well. These two characters kept Clooney's Clayton in check, a Clooney whose pretty boy visage has begun to droop around the jowls. Over all, it was an amusing ride that I enjoyed a little less and less as I write this review. And what was with the guy upstate who'd hit someone with his car?

1134116,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00121QGPY,D. Hartley,"[4, 5]","The late great Paddy Chayefsky would surely be pleased by the opening salvo of searing verbiage that launches writer-director Tony Gilroy's superb new legal thriller, ""Michael Clayton"". The fine British actor Tom Wilkinson nearly walks off with the movie before the opening credits are even finished rolling with a magnificently performed voiceover rant that recalls Howard Beale's ""cleansing moment of clarity"" in ""Network"".Wilkinson portrays Arthur Edens, a crack lawyer and senior partner for a prestigious New York corporate law firm who is, well, cracking up. On the eve of closing a case he has been working on for several years on behalf of U-North, an agrichemical company faced with a class-action lawsuit, Edens suffers a Dostoevkskian meltdown and suddenly decides to side with the plaintiffs and publicly expose his client's turpitude in the matter.As you can probably imagine, with many millions of dollars at stake and the reputations of both the corporation and law firm on the line, there are some very powerful, p****d off people sitting in dark boardrooms, scrambling for a quick and decisive solution to their ""problem"". Enter the film's title character, Michael Clayton (George Clooney, in a first-rate performance). Clayton, who is on the payroll as an attorney, is in actuality the firm's ""fixer"", who cynically refers to himself as a ""janitor"" (he's not a ""cleaner"", like Jean Reno in ""La Femme Nikita"", but akin to Harvey Keitel's ""Mr. Wolfe""  in ""Pulp Fiction"").Clayton cleans up other people's messes, but cannot get his own life in order; he's divorced and up to his eyes in gambling debts and bad investments. And, like his friend Arthur, he's having some primal doubts about the moral and ethical ambiguities involved with what he does for a living. His immediate concern, however, is to salvage this potential disaster for the firm by coaxing Arthur back to reality. Arthur may have a screw loose, but he hasn't lost any of his shrewd lawyer chops, so he won't be swayed easily. Still, Clayton is sure that if he can just get him back on his meds, he'll come around.In the meantime, unbeknownst to Clayton, the head of U-North's legal department (Tilda Swinton) has already lost patience with the situation at hand and enlisted a pair of much more sinister ""fixers"" to zero in and eliminate the problem (with extreme prejudice). As the situation becomes more insidiously deadly and the stakes become extremely high, Clayton, ever the compulsive gambler, faces the ultimate moral choice: he could risk his life and ""do the right thing"", or he could ""play it safe""- at the risk of losing his soul.Gilroy extrapolated on this moral dilemma previously in his screenplay for the 1997 Taylor Hackford film, ""The Devil's Advocate"", in which he pitted fledgling lawyer Keanu Reeves' nave idealism against senior partner Al Pacino's devilishly Faustian temptations. In ""Michael Clayton"", the situation isn't so black and white; ethics and principals cast minimal light in this shadowy noir world of boardroom conspiracies.This film marks Gilroy's debut as a director. His intelligently constructed screenplays for the Jason Bourne trilogy have all featured refreshingly adult dialog and subtle character nuance that has played no small part in setting those three films apart from the majority of mindless Hollywood action thrillers. That being said, ""Michael Clayton"" is not as fast-paced as the Bourne films, but it is no less gripping (and there's only one explosion!).In fact, ""Michael Clayton"" harkens back to the kind of films that Sidney Lumet used to make, like the aforementioned ""Network"", and more specifically, ""The Verdict"". I see  some parallels between Paul Newman's brilliantly nuanced turn as the burned out ambulance chaser who gets a chance at redemption in the latter film and Clooney's equally accomplished performance as the disillusioned Clayton. I also thought Tom Wilkinson's character would have felt right at home in the underrated 1979 satire ""And Justice For All"" which features Al Pacino's classic courtroom meltdown (""YOU'RE out of order! HE'S out of order! ""We're ALL out of order..."")Clooney and Wilkinson both deliver Oscar-caliber performances, and are well-supported by Swinton, who gives depth to a dragon-lady character who would likely have been more cartoonish and one-dimensional in the hands of a less-accomplished actress. I also got a kick out of Sydney Pollack, who gets some choice lines (Pollack co-produced, along with Steven Soderbergh, Anthony Minghella and Clooney).

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","2007's ""Michael Clayton"" is a tense and fascinating, if slowrolling, legal drama featuring George Clooney as the resident ""fixer"" at a high-speed legal firm, whose job it is to clean up the messes of the firm's clients.As the movie opens, we meet Michael Clayton, a burnt-out New York attorney with a gambling problem, divorced, and in financial straits over a failed restaurant.  Clayton is summoned by phone to fix yet another client's legal mess.  In a tense confrontation with a client fresh from a hit-and-run accident, we get a feel for Clayton. He is cynical, practical, and good at ""fixing"" problems, but ground-down by the sordid nature of the work. On his way back to the city, he happens to leave his car just before it is destroyed by an explosion.The movie now steps back four days in time. Clayton's best friend Arthur, a senior litigator in the law firm and defending pesticide giant U/NORTHERN against a three billion dollar class-action suit, suffers a psycological melt-down during a deposition.  Clayton is dispatched by the law firm's senior partner (played with weary cynicism by Sydney Pollack) to ""contain"" the damage. Arthur (played with wonderfully manic energy by Tom Wilkinson) has had both a breakdown and an epiphany about the nature of the class action law suit.  Clayton tries unsuccessfully to get Arthur safely back on his depression medication and back on the rails with their law firm.U/NORTHERN's general counsel (a roller-coaster emotional performance by Tilda Swinton) is also playing damage control.  With her position with U/NORTHERN hanging on the successful resolution of the lawsuit, she is driven to desperate measures.  She engages a shadowy pair of operators who tail and wiretap Arthur, now back in New York and preparing to change sides in the class action suit.  Aware that Arthur has evidence of a U/NORTHERN cover-up, she authorizes the operatives to take ""the other option.""Michael Clayton is stunned to learn of Arthur's apparent suicide.  U/NORTHERN's legal problems seem resolved by Arthur's rather timely death, and the law firm loans Clayton the money to buy his way out of his financial difficulties.  However, a chance encounter with one of the plaintiffs in the law suit causes Clayton to question Arthur's death and the resoluion of the law suit.  His investigation draws the lethal attention of the operatives working for U/NORTHERN.As the movie circles back to the beginning sequence, Clayton flees the scene of his destroyed car, ultimately to a confrontation with the U/NORTHERN general counsel that is the pay-off scene of the movie.  The ending of the movie should be emotionally satisfying for the viewer, if a little simplistic for the multi-layered drama that preceded it.""Michael Clayton"" features atmospheric shooting in the city streets, law offices, bars, and suburbs of New York City.

No. And its been done very well before, most notably in ""The Verdict"".But it's been a while since ""The Verdict"" and ""Michael Clayton"" is a lot better than similar movies in this genre. That's because, like ""The Verdict"" it's the acting and the writing and directing that combine to make the movie so good. It's not the plot. It's not the action (there isn't really very much) or even the sense of menace that you expect from this.Clooney's character is similar to Paul Newman's in ""The Verdict"". He's backed into a corner professionally and financially, his personal life seems rather glum, but he hasn't yet hit rock-bottom like Newman's had. And Clooney does a solid job of showing the increasingly desperate and burned out guy who's still got a heart, still got his honesty, still basically always doing the right thing. He's morally and spiritually still quite a few steps above Newman's character. He hasn't quite hit rock-bottom...yet. Clooney is very good with these guys--very good at showing the inner beat-down soul of someone who's still trying to sell himself to the world (much like he does in the also very good, ""Up in the Air"").And I disagree completely with some who said Wilkinson overacts. I thought the dialogue and performance were absolutely perfect (more like schizophrenia than manic depression but still, pitch perfect).The plot is predictable, but the writing and performances are a cut above.

The dialogue seemed to fly by, I kept missing tidbits of information that turned out to be crucial, and for the first ten minutes I absolutely could not figure out what was going on. Who were all these people? Why did Michael stop his car? How did he figure out whodunnit? The plot holes seemed enormous.There was nothing for it but to watch the movie again. And, I have to say that after watching it twice, Michael Clayton was an impressive piece of filming. Every spoken line, every gesture, every bit of visual information was intricately structured. The acting was wonderful, with George Clooney at his best as a man at the end of his rope. Tom Wilkinson delivered a memorable performance as a manic-depressive lawyer who has ""seen the light."" (Do lawyers really switch sides in real life?) And Sydney Pollack was superb, as always, in a small but significant role. The filming was moody, tense, edgy. And every detail fit together tight as a drum. There weren't any plot holes. There weren't even plot pinpricks, which was both the strength and the ultimate weakness of this film.With the exception of Memento, which was designed for several viewings, you shouldn't have to watch a movie twice to understand it--especially if the film is a thriller.

First time director is highly regarded writer Tony Gilroy (The Bourne Ultimatum, The Cutting Edge, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Identity, The Devil's Advocate, Proof of Life, Dolores Claiborne, etc) who understands the tension of suspense films and here adds to that entertainment element the key ingredients of social and philosophical statements.  It is a film that works on many levels.Michael Clayton (George Clooney, in one of his finest moments) is a lawyer with a major firm headed by tough yet compassionate CEO Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack, finally in top form as an actor), but Michael's position in the firm has been reduced to a 'fixer/janitor', a man who cleans up messes that are always part of legal cases.  Michael is cool, brilliant, but is struggling with his own demons of gambling addiction, inherited debt from covering for his wasted alcoholic/druggie brother's failure as a restaurateur, and a divorced man trying to relate to his son.  When a long term law suit against a major chemical corporation comes to a head, the chief lawyer for the case Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) falls victim to the pressure of the case, and while he holds the key to the truths involved, he disintegrates into a manic depressive state.  The chemical company's lawyer Karen Crowder (a brilliant Tilda Swinton) struggles to please her Board of Directors in a plea bargain that is backed by all manner of lies and crimes.  It is Michael Clayton that persists in 'fixing' and cleaning up the case, uncovering a massive tragedy the company has been shielding. To say more (and there is SO much more to tell!) would spoil the development of this nail-biting plot.Every actor involved in this film is superb, thanks in large part to the sensitive direction of Tony Gilroy.  Clooney proves he is one of our more well rounded actors on the screen today, Wilkinson continues to prove his mettle as a character actor par excellence, and Swinton is so fine in this tough role that she leaves the audience staggering. Watching MICHAEL CLAYTON  restores faith in just how fine Hollywood movies can be.  It is sure to be on the list in many categories come Awards time.

Its plot is rather predictable (especially the ending), the dialogue is OK, and the supporting characters (especially Tilda's Swinton character) are terribly under written.  But, on the good side, the film is worth seeing for George Clooney.  He gives a wonderful performance here.  He's good in everything he's done (even in the awful Batman and Robin).  Clooney, I think, is very underrated as an artist/actor.  I think he's the best, or at least one of the best, actors working in Hollywood today.  He's got the ""movie star"" down pat, but he's actually a great actor.  He wouldn't have been out of place in old Hollywood, he's that good.As for the film, the central idea of a ""cleaner"" like Michael Clayton is fascinating.  It's a shame that the film really doesn't jump into more ambiguous territory.  The movies goes the usual evil corporation route vs. a corporate guy who doesn't want to take it anymore.  It's an entertaining film, never boring, but it just skims the surface in a rather predictable fashion.  Sydney Pollack gives another good performance, but I was really disappointed in Tilda Swinton's performance.  She simply wasn't given anything to do.  She's a great actress, but her role is so simplistically written that even she can't bring anything to it.  I was very surprised when she won Best Supporting Actress.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 7]","George Clooney leads an outstanding cast-- Tom Wilkinson, Sydney Pollack, Tilda Swinton who won an Oscar for her performance, Michael O'Keefe et al.-- in Director Tony Gilroy's first movie ""Michael Clayton."" Clooney is an attorney in a huge law firm who never goes to court. His job is as a janitor who cleans up everybody else's messes. And the mess in this movie-- at least one of them-- is that the lead attorney Arthur (Wilkinson), who is defending a three billion class action lawsuit, appears to have gone bananas in a deposition and removed all his clothes except his shoes and socks.The plot is complex and not for the lazy so it is probably better appreciated in the luxury of your own home away from  a theatre overrun with talkers and cell phones. There are several threads woven into the plot. Clayton (Clooney) has both family problems and money problems of his own that he has to ""clean up,"" along with his janitorial duties at work. (The kid who plays Clayton's son, by the way, almost steals the movie away from Clooney.)The DVD version permits the viewer to watch this film in its entirety with the director's comments in a voice-over. After listening to about ten minutes or so of Gilroy's remarks and he was still informing us of how he came to make this film, blah, blah, blah, I decided I had heard enough. Listening to directors expound on their films is 99 times out of 100 a waste of one's precious life.As I watched this fine performance by Mr. Clooney, I remembered an article I read a couple of years or so ago when Bill O'Reilly opined that Clooney's left-leaning political views would sound the death knell of his acting career.

Supported by a zealous and well made script, the film by itself is quite ambitious in its proposal, but still it gets to engage the most exigent viewer. Supported by a very delicate issue that deals with the destructive and irreversible consequences of a herbicide that generates collateral damages in the human body, all a series of cautious chess movements in order to avoid a major scandal far beyond we know as ""fidelity of mark"" that eventually led not only to a financial disaster, but besides an irreversible loss of market placement.Of course the movie offers us other several secondary lines. Clayton is our legal antihero, a consummated gambler who belongs to the lawyer's office of this questioned company.So as more we realize what 's bellow all this complex drama, we will witness one of the most memorable performances in years, an absolute tour de force acting by Tom Wilkinson. He literally steles the show although his character is secondary, but transcendentally decisive in the plot .George Clooney gives us the finest role of his career, as this attorney who precisely doesn't represent the impolite side of the law. The rest of the cast is formidable too, with special kudos to Sidney Pollack and the ruthless female legal advisor (Tilda Swinton) .Tom Gilroy emerges as one of the most promising talents of this demanding activity, and although it's too risky to make long term forecasts, I guess this must be the Best Movie the next year (Golden Globe and Academy award), Wilkinson must win as Best supporting Actor in both prizes, and George Clooney should be embracing the golden little statue.Totally recommended, even for those people who use to go to the movie a half dozen times by year.

To sum all that up, although the idea of using myth and religous themes is about the number one issue in screenwriting these days, this film has both, but renders them successful by deepening what is on the surface, a movie about bad guys and girls and figuring out along with Michael Clayton, who they are, and what, if anything, should be done about it.  It's all set up in the first seven minutes of the film, so it wouldn't be giving too much away to briefly summarize that we hear a frantic voice-over monologue spouting a weird revelation about placentas, afterbirth, organs, etc: literally visceral imagery.  Simultaneously, we see a series of shots of the corporate corridors at night: geometric, barren, sterile, inanimate, external. The 'external' of the imagery  and the 'inside' of the monologue (btw, the screenwriter/director was originally a playwright), bring to mind a famous tale of the Bible, and the voyage the protagonist goes through. If you went to Sunday school, you probably know the story. And if you watch and listen, you'll see and hear references to that same story.  So what's the story?  Yea, it's that one.

Michael Clayton is a complicated drama of a man caught in the throes of a personal struggle he cannot escape; but one he must learn to accept. It's a tough lesson in life, but as the film illustrates, acceptance of one's own limitations can have its own unique rewards. The problem is that its plot and cast of characters make it difficult to follow without a pen and paper. Is THAT his brother? What does SHE have to do with the main character? Who are all of THOSE people? Expect to ask yourself such questions as you work your way through the plot's many twists and turns; including the element of time-shifts, which I don't particularly like. The film opens with a lengthy philosophical diatribe, which is performed as a voice-over, as the camera follows a messenger through the labyrinthian hallways of a massive law firm. That alone forces you to stop chewing your popcorn and pay attention. George Clooney does a convincing job as Michael Clayton, but Tilda Swinton steals the show.

Superficially, it is a legal suspense film centered around a class action lawsuit.  On a deeper level, it is an engrossing character study about a jaded lawyer whose career has beome little more than a soul-sucking chore.  But on the deepest level, the film was, for me, primarily a story about damnation and redemption.  One of the characters sells his or her soul, while another is saved both literally and spiritually by a sudden recognition of what really matters in life.  George Clooney is particularly brilliant as the title character but even so, in my opinion, he comes close to being out-performed by the supporting cast of Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. Tom Wilkinson is excellent as a lawyer in the midst of manic depressive crisis; Tilda Swinton is so chilling as the banally evil corporate attorney that she seems to create a whole new class of villainy. This film is not for the casual viewer.  The story took me at least a couple of viewings to fully grasp what was going on.  But it is very worth the effort.

But his own life is full of complications, both personal and professional. He works for a large law firm that is defending U/North, a chemical conglomerate, against a class-action suit with several hundred farmers whose health has been damaged by one of its products. Clayton's friend, the firm's top legal mind, is behaving erratically. To the dismay of the chemical giant, he is inexplicably in contact with the injured plaintiffs. Meanwhile, the restaurant Clayton owns has gone out of business, leaving him with a huge debt. His family has fallen apart and he is struggling to be a good brother to his working class family and a decent Dad to his precocious son. The pressures on the man are nearly unbearable, yet he soldiers on.The film's writing, acting and directing are top notch. The film is told as an intersecting jigsaw of actions and scenes, starting near the end of the narrative then circling back four days to give context to the action. Though it deals with the law, this is not a legal drama in the usual sense, but a personal drama dealing with people in the legal business. George Clooney is solid as the sympathetic title character. He is perpetually exhausted, unshaven and on guard.  Tilda Swinton is magnificent as U/North's driven legal counsel, Karen Crowder, leavening her nastiness with the just the right touch of vulnerability and desperation. Tom Wilkinson hands in another fine performance as the off-his-meds lawyer, Arthur Edens, and Sydney Pollack is completely believable as the beleaguered firm's chief, Marty Bach.Michael Clayton was not a movie I would have chosen for myself (the wife and kids were interested) but I found myself absorbed in its gritty realism, plausible characters and surprises.

Clayton is not a hero. He is called to take care of a trial lawyer who stripped naked during a taped disposition and started chasing one of the defendants. He ranted about his love for the client. She was an angel I guess. Clayton has some experience in dealing with his bipolar co-worker. Clayton job is to get his co-worker back on his meds. However, the co-worker has other plans and is pretty much smarter than his bosses and Clayton. The primary counsel for the firm's client orders the co-worker killed because the co-worker is going to spill the beans about a class-action law suit that will cost her company billions of dollars. The coworker is killed. Clayton figures out what happens and confronts the primary counsel and gets her on tape. This pretty much the plot. Clayton investigates his friend's death for pretty much righteous reasons, but gives up because he gets $80K, which will pay his debt to some loan sharks. He only confronts the counsel because she tries to have him killed and the hired killers miss. There is no one to root for in the movie, except for the plaintiff. Clayton does nothing really noble in all this. He even breaks the law and puts his brother's career in danger to gather the evidence.The plot was ok, but I thought the car bomb idea was ludricous. How could the police not miss the connection with the other death, especially since Clayton's brother is with the police. The hired killers were not so smart.  Clooney was excellent as Clayton. Swinton did not have much of a role for her vast talent. All the actors were very good. The direction was crisp and purposeful. It was an enjoyable experience.

Unbeknownst to the viewer at this time, Arthur has experienced a horrific mental break down. During his frantic monologue he describes an incredibly frightening epiphany or in this particular moment, a rebirth that could lead to his subsequent redemption.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) who is the firms special council is also known as the firms ""Fixer"", or in a less respected title, a ""Janitor"".  Michael is introduced into the film during an underground poker game in Chinatown.  Later on, we find out that Michael is a degenerate gambler who has made mistakes and poor investments, more notably, a restaurant business that failed miserably. Michael is divorced and also owes a loan shark a substantial amount of money in order to cover his gambling debts.The notorious Manhattan based law firm, Kenner, Bach & Ledeen could potentially go through an important transition; a high-stakes merger with a London based firm is being negotiated and a six year defense of a large client (U-North) is being put at risk due to Arthur's recent mental break down. Arthur's mental break down occurs while taking a deposition in a lawsuit against U-North. He strips down naked and delves into an intense emotional tirade exposing his guilt and disgust in defending this client. He is arrested in a Milwaukee parking lot after following one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. (A Mortifying Scene) The class action lawsuit comes from a handful of mid-western farmers who are suing the corporation for 4 billion dollars. It is revealed that U-North, a global agricultural conglomerate, has knowingly been manufacturing carcinogenic producing products.Karen Crowder, (Tilda Swinton) U-North's general council, is concerned with their leading defense after Arthur's break down. She becomes suspicious and baffled that the firm is sending Michael Clayton to clean up the mess. After all, Michael Clayton has been with the firm for 20 years and has not been made a partner yet. Furthermore, Michael Clayton who was once a promising and fierce criminal prosecutor for the Queens DA has been relegated to the menial task of Wills & Trusts. Regardless, Michael is sent to reassure her that everything is going to be alright and that Arthur's condition is stabilized. Karen is not entirely convinced of Michael's reassurance. Her concern is further amplified after viewing the tape of Arthur's breakdown. During the taped deposition, Arthur admits to U-North's guilt in this case. It is also revealed that Arthur had access to a scientific research document detailing U-North's questionably ethical practices, more specifically, their cancer causing weed killer. When Karen discovers this alarming fact, she immediately contacts the CEO. An underground and private cabal is summoned to handle U-North's problematic and highly delicate situation.After leaving the underground poker game, Michael Clayton is called by a legal friend to drive upstate to Westchester county in order to legally advice a client of his who was involved in a Hit & Run incident. When Michael informs the client of his fragile situation as well as his limited options, the client explodes with rage and questions Michael's usefulness. Michael explains his role at his firm and advises him to find a good trial lawyer because he is not. Michael Clayton drives off into the back roads of Westchester county. He abruptly stops his car and proceeds to get out to admire a beautiful hill with a few horses stationed peacefully at the peak. He slowly gazes at the horses and the surrounding serene environment only to be interrupted by the violent explosion of his Mercedes S500. He freezes in sudden awe, fear, and astonishment.The majority of the film begins four days prior to this scene.",5,"Never Let a Scientist Use the Words, ""Unanticipated"" and ""Immediate"" In the Same Sentence",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,4181,"['young', 'adult', 'aspirations', 'dreams', 'become', 'high-powered', 'corporate', 'attorney', 'even', 'Janitor', 'matter', 'might', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'viewing', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'intense', 'legal', 'drama', 'titled', 'Michael', 'Clayton.From', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'immediately', 'eerie', 'frightening', 'tone', 'intense', 'voice-over', 'monologue', 'one', 'leading', 'partners', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'prestigious', 'Manhattan', 'law', 'firm', 'Unbeknownst', 'viewer', 'time', 'Arthur', 'experienced', 'horrific', 'mental', 'break', 'down', 'frantic', 'monologue', 'incredibly', 'frightening', 'epiphany', 'particular', 'moment', 'rebirth', 'could', 'lead', 'subsequent', 'redemption.Michael', 'Clayton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'firms', 'special', 'council', 'also', 'known', 'firms', 'Fixer', 'less', 'respected', 'title', 'Janitor', 'Michael', 'introduced', 'film', 'underground', 'poker', 'game', 'Chinatown', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'Michael', 'degenerate', 'gambler', 'who', 'made', 'mistakes', 'poor', 'investments', 'more', 'notably', 'restaurant', 'business', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Michael', 'divorced', 'also', 'loan', 'shark', 'substantial', 'amount', 'money', 'order', 'cover', 'gambling', 'debts.The', 'notorious', 'Manhattan', 'based', 'law', 'firm', 'Kenner', 'Bach', 'Ledeen', 'could', 'potentially', 'go', 'important', 'transition', 'high-stakes', 'merger', 'London', 'based', 'firm', 'being', 'negotiated', 'six', 'year', 'defense', 'large', 'client', 'U-North', 'being', 'put', 'risk', 'due', 'Arthur', 'recent', 'mental', 'break', 'down', 'Arthur', 'mental', 'break', 'down', 'occurs', 'taking', 'deposition', 'lawsuit', 'U-North', 'down', 'naked', 'intense', 'emotional', 'tirade', 'exposing', 'guilt', 'disgust', 'defending', 'client', 'arrested', 'Milwaukee', 'parking', 'lot', 'following', 'one', 'plaintiffs', 'lawsuit', 'Mortifying', 'Scene', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'handful', 'mid-western', 'farmers', 'who', 'are', 'suing', 'corporation', '4', 'billion', 'dollars', 'revealed', 'U-North', 'global', 'agricultural', 'conglomerate', 'knowingly', 'been', 'manufacturing', 'carcinogenic', 'producing', 'products.Karen', 'Crowder', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'U-North', 'general', 'council', 'concerned', 'leading', 'defense', 'Arthur', 'break', 'down', 'suspicious', 'baffled', 'firm', 'sending', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'been', 'firm', '20', 'years', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'partner', 'yet', 'Furthermore', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'promising', 'fierce', 'criminal', 'prosecutor', 'Queens', 'DA', 'been', 'relegated', 'menial', 'task', 'Wills', 'Trusts', 'Regardless', 'Michael', 'sent', 'reassure', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'alright', 'Arthur', 'condition', 'stabilized', 'Karen', 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'Michael', 'reassurance', 'concern', 'further', 'amplified', 'viewing', 'tape', 'Arthur', 'breakdown', 'taped', 'deposition', 'Arthur', 'U-North', 'guilt', 'case', 'also', 'revealed', 'Arthur', 'had', 'access', 'scientific', 'research', 'document', 'detailing', 'U-North', 'questionably', 'ethical', 'practices', 'more', 'specifically', 'cancer', 'causing', 'weed', 'killer', 'When', 'Karen', 'alarming', 'fact', 'immediately', 'CEO', 'underground', 'private', 'cabal', 'summoned', 'handle', 'U-North', 'problematic', 'highly', 'delicate', 'situation.After', 'leaving', 'underground', 'poker', 'game', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'called', 'legal', 'friend', 'drive', 'upstate', 'Westchester', 'county', 'order', 'legally', 'advice', 'client', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'Hit', 'Run', 'incident', 'When', 'Michael', 'client', 'fragile', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'limited', 'options', 'client', 'rage', 'questions', 'Michael', 'usefulness', 'Michael', 'role', 'firm', 'find', 'good', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'not', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'off', 'back', 'roads', 'Westchester', 'county', 'abruptly', 'car', 'proceeds', 'get', 'out', 'admire', 'beautiful', 'hill', 'few', 'horses', 'stationed', 'peacefully', 'peak', 'slowly', 'horses', 'surrounding', 'serene', 'environment', 'only', 'be', 'interrupted', 'violent', 'explosion', 'Mercedes', 'S500', 'sudden', 'awe', 'fear', 'astonishment.The', 'majority', 'film', 'four', 'days', 'prior', 'scene']",N/A

It's hard not to like George Clooney, but he does a great job making Clayton unsympathetic--he's a distant, divorced father, a mostly absent son, an unsympathetic brother, a failed bar owner and an unsuccessful high-stakes card player. He's a worn-out 45 who isn't going anywhere and doesn't know why. When one of the firm's high profile litigation partners goes into melt down, Clayton of course is called in to clean up the train wreck. Clooney is so good that we don't know even at the very end what he'll do with what he finds.

Fitzpatrick ""John Fitzpatrick""","[0, 0]","This is an excellent movie.I suspect it is not for everyone: essentially, it's the tale of a morally bankrupt corporation which will stop at nothing to cover up its misdeeds. There's a battle between good and evil, and a full spectrum of characters: including decent people who are innocent victims, an anti-hero good guy, and people whose humanity has seemingly disappeared. The interplay of these characters, and the layering of story lines and subplots is handled masterfully.What makes it a good movie?First, the excellent performances from the cast. George Clooney is entirely believable as an attorney who is his firm's ""fixer"". Tilda Swinton delivers a superb performance as a corporate executive who will do anything- legal or not- to protect her employer. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.Then, there's the screenplay and direction by Tony (Bourne Legacy) Gilroy. He sweeps you up into the story, and the devious twists and turns of the plot, as well as taking you into the lives of the characters.While this is a fictional story, there is an aura of authenticity which creates the impression the events depicted could happen in reality.

1134163,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,B00121QGPY,JoeyD,"[4, 4]","I haven't seen too many American films in the past 20 years that I have actually really enjoyed.  What most people view as future classics (i.e. ""Titanic"", ""American Beauty"", ""Little Children"", etc...) just didn't do it for me personally.  So when my wife rented this one the other night, I again had my doubts after being let down so many times as of late.  To my pleasant surprise, ""Michael Clayton"" was a fabolous flick!George Clooney is Michael Clayton, a high-end New York attorney whose main job in the firm is to clean-up or fix messy situations.  While he's been very successful in his career as the firm's ""janitor"", his personal life is in complete disarray (yes, the irony is a bit too overt, but this is Hollywood after all).  When one of the firm's senior partners, Arthur Edens (played to the hilt by Tom Wilkinson) suffers a nervous breakdown after six years defending a corrupt billion-dollar agrochemical company (U-North) therefore threatening to compromise the case, Michael is called upon to clean up the mess and help his old friend and colleague.  However, Clayton soon discovers that his crazy comrade Arthur may actually have a valid reason for going off the deep end, when he begins to unearth the corrupt cabal spearheaded by the villainous Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the lead counsel for U-North.Clooney once again proved to me why he is the closest thing to the second-coming of Cary Grant or Clark Gable, with a magnificent performance as the morally conflicted attorney trying to keep both his personal and professional life from falling apart.  He is sans his usually swagger in this understated performance, as Clayton is a man of few words, silently suffering from a myriad of problems while doing his very best to keep his life from collapsing completely.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, especially Swinton, Wilkinson, and a surprisingly excellent Sydney Pollack (Marty Bach, the firm's senior partner and Michael's boss).While the film never strays from being very suspenseful, those of you who are action addicts may be a bit disappointed and consider this a `slow' film.  It's a somber, realistic and intelligent movie that is brimming with symbolism.  A film you need to pay close attention to from beginning to end in order to understand the intricate plot, so make sure you watch it without any distractions.  You may even get lost in the middle of it, but no need to fret, for everything comes together nicely in the end (some people may argue too nicely, but for me personally, it works).I enjoyed everything about this one.  Writer and first time director Tim Gilroy (past screenplays include ""The Bourne Identity"" and its sequels,  ""Proof of Life"", ""The Devil's Advocate"" etc...) paints a much more realistic and intelligent story than his past efforts.  Also, the film's hauntingly beautiful score was outstanding, kudos to James Newton Howard (""The Fugitive"", ""The Prince of Tides"", ""Blood Diamond"", etc... etc...) as he successfully added so much to the film's never-ending suspense and drama.This is definitely my favorite film of 2007.

1134171,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00121QGPY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","For whatever reason legal themed movies always seem to get my attention, I can't explain it, there's just something about these types of films that speaks to me. I don't know any lawyers to speak of, I'm not well-versed in the law, but I enjoy watching movies that are based in or around the legal system. From the various John Grisham adaptations (who also happens to be one of my favorite authors) consisting of ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Client"", and ""The Pelican Brief"" (which was his worst effort on film and on paper) to Aaron Sorkin's ""A Few Good Men"" to ""Primal Fear"", I love almost every single one of these types of films to one extent or another. When I noticed that another legal movie, ""Michael Clayton"", was coming to the big screen, I of course became interested, and when I heard that it was not only being written by acclaimed writer Tony Gilroy (the `Bourne' series of films), but he would also be sitting in the director's chair for the first time, my interest was piqued even further. Now, having Tony direct the film did worry me a little bit that maybe the film wouldn't be up to snuff, but when George Clooney (`Ocean's' trilogy), Tom Wilkinson (""Batman Begins""), and Sydney Pollack (""Changing Lanes"") were set to star in the film I figured that he must be doing something right, otherwise I doubt he'd get such an incredible cast of actors assembled for his movie. So, needless to say, when ""Michael Clayton"" arrived on DVD I was looking forward to my chance to sit down and watch it, and I couldn't have been happier with the results.""Michael Clayton"" is an attorney who is known as a fixer; essentially he's the go-to-guy when the firm he works for needs a mess to be cleaned up. Michael (George Clooney) is the best there is at what he does, but when one of his firm's top litigators (Tom Wilkinson) seems to suffer a mental break and rashly decides to switch sides in a $3 billion dollar case after coming across some rather eye-opening evidence, Michael is brought in to try to rectify the situation. However, this may be one mess that his vast skills my not be enough to handle. The harder Michael works to cover up the damage being done to his firm, the closer he comes to discovering the evidence that caused the situation in the first place, evidence that will put his life into jeopardy as some of the people involved in the case would like to keep their secrets buried, and are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure they stay that way.This was one well-written, skillfully directed, and perfectly acted movie that was definitely worth the Academy Award nominations it received, and should have won more than it did. For a first time director this is one excellent way to kick off a career in filmmaking, and being able to direct something he'd written must have made the experience all the better for long-time writer Tony Gilroy. The story was very well-paced, with fast, sharp, legal-filled dialogue, and some decent twists in the story to keep the audience on their toes. It's surprising that for a legal themed movie not one scene, that I can recall, actually took place inside a courtroom, yet the film never lacks excitement or gripping drama, and easily ranks up there as one of my favorite lawyer movies of all time.The cast of actors and actresses assembled in this film were some of the best talents that Hollywood has to offer, and each member brought their A-game to the screen. George Clooney gives one of his best performances as a flawed protagonist who becomes torn between doing what's right for his firm and what's right for his friend played by Tom Wilkinson. Wilkinson who is an excellent actor in his own right, and is generally at home playing villains makes for a very sympathetic victim of sorts, who desperately wants to be on the right side of a case for a change, and his choice may just be more costly than he can bear. The supporting cast led by Tilda Swinton (""Constantine"") and critically acclaimed actor/director Sydney Pollack was excellent, though their time spent on the screen was brief, and it would have been nice had they been given more scenes, these two talents made the most of their time and gave very solid performances and created two very engaging characters for the audience to invest in.""Michael Clayton"" is a top-notch legal thriller that contains plenty of legal jargon for those movie fans thirsty for that sort of thing, but without ever setting foot inside a courtroom allowing it to stand apart from other legal dramas. Powerful performances, a brilliantly written script, and a sure-handed first time director makes this a must see movie for fans of legal dramas or just a good dramatic movie in general.""Michael

His role is that of a janitor, to clean up the messes made by other lawyers and clients at a corporate firm where there is no shortage of serious problems. To start with, the lead attorney in a case that is more than six years in the works has gone off his meds, literally. In the middle of a deposition the lead counsel for a case that is appraching $10 million in billable hours takes off his clothes, unconcerned about the room full of people in suits and ties. He may be leaking documents to the opposing counsel and harboring a dangerous crush toward one of the plaintiffs, an underage girl.Michael Clayton has to fix all this before the case goes to trial, or risk the firm's bankruptcy. Through it all he has a crushing $80,000 debt from a failed restaurant he purchased with his brother, who does not mind leaving the lawyer-brother with the bulk of responsibility. He does not have time to converse with his young son or have a personal life of any sort.The heart and soul ofMichael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)is George Clooney, who delivers the finest performance in an impressive career. It is understated, somber and everything a John Grisham-based legal thriller is not. There are a few short action sequences, but no guns and only one explosion. The dialogue is smart, fast-paced and often memorable.

He's got a gambling problem.But he has another problem as well, which is the focus of this film. A chemical company has manufactured an insecticide with deadly consequences to human life. Now it's true that a number of films have aimed at corporate corruption, going all the way back to the 70s (""Chinatown"", for example) and even before. But in ""Michael Clayton"" we see something more extreme, more radical. Without giving away the shocking central event of this film, let's just say that there's very little a corporation won't do to stop severely damaging information about one of its products from making its way to the public.The shocking central event in this film definitely posits the corporation as a psychopath--the central premise of the documentary film ""The Corporation"". If you have not yet seen that documentary, I urge you to do so.Clooney is excellent, as is Sydney Pollack as his boss, one of the senior partners of the law firm. Also good are Tilda Swinton as the corporation's chief counsel--a high strung, nervous type whose interest is in doing what has to be done--and Tom Wilkinson, one of the corporation's top executives who is threatening to expose the real nature of this insecticide and who unfortunately loses his sanity in the process.The film is structured in a post-modern style, with temporal jump cuts, and while at first glance this may come off as somewhat gimmicky and confusing, eventually the pieces do fall into place and it becomes a highly entertaining and thought-provoking puzzle whose solution is, admittedly, a bit neat at the end, but nevertheless, I think, very satisfying.One of the highlights so far of the 2007 film year--at least for commercially released American films, ""Michael Clayton"" is a real tour-de-force and should be seen by those who love a good thriller and by those who have a strong sense of social justice.Very highly recommended.",5,"Brilliant fictional adjunct to the documentary ""The Corporation""",1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,2308,"['perfect', 'adjunct', 'documentary', 'film', 'Corporation', '2004', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'writer-director', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'saw', 'documentary.George', 'Clooney', 'title', 'character', 'lawyer', 'prestigious', 'firm', 'role', 'fixer', 'way', 'law', 'firm', 'own', 'way', 'saying', 'like', ""'ll"", 'very', 'likely', 'never', 'get', 'promoted', 'partner', 'got', 'gambling', 'problem.But', 'problem', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'film', 'chemical', 'company', 'manufactured', 'insecticide', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'human', 'life', 'Now', 'true', 'number', 'films', 'have', 'aimed', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'going', 'way', 'back', '70s', 'Chinatown', 'example', 'even', 'before', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'see', 'something', 'more', 'extreme', 'more', 'radical', 'giving', 'away', 'shocking', 'central', 'event', 'film', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'corporation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'stop', 'severely', 'damaging', 'information', 'one', 'products', 'making', 'way', 'public.The', 'shocking', 'central', 'event', 'film', 'definitely', 'corporation', 'psychopath', 'central', 'premise', 'documentary', 'film', 'Corporation', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'documentary', 'urge', 'do', 'so.Clooney', 'excellent', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'boss', 'one', 'senior', 'partners', 'law', 'firm', 'Also', 'good', 'are', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'corporation', 'chief', 'counsel', 'high', 'strung', 'nervous', 'type', 'interest', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'one', 'corporation', 'top', 'executives', 'who', 'threatening', 'expose', 'real', 'nature', 'insecticide', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'sanity', 'process.The', 'film', 'structured', 'post-modern', 'style', 'temporal', 'jump', 'cuts', 'first', 'glance', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'somewhat', 'gimmicky', 'confusing', 'eventually', 'pieces', 'do', 'fall', 'place', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'puzzle', 'solution', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'neat', 'end', 'nevertheless', 'think', 'very', 'satisfying.One', 'highlights', 'so', 'far', '2007', 'film', 'year', 'least', 'commercially', 'released', 'American', 'films', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'real', 'tour-de-force', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'thriller', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'social', 'justice.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

When it was over, I wanted to see it again (always a good sign) and look more closely at certain scenes. There is such a pervasive gray backdrop to the movie that you might think you're watching something from Ridley Scott and it works nicely here. We're talking about dark nights of the soul, so I don't think it's an accident that many scenes take place at night, and if it's daytime it's gray. There's little in the way of cheery sunshine to comfort us.George Clooney is Michael Clayton, a lawyer for whose specialty is janitorial work-- he cleans up nasty situations that often require calling in favors from the right people to make things disappear. With corporate accountability at an all-time low in the real world, everything that U/North (his firm's big chemical company client) is trying to do is quite believable, even murder. After being called in to help clean up a potential $6 billion mess, Clayton's biggest asset (anonymity) becomes his biggest liability-- even the bad guys he's trying to help don't know who he is, which makes him a target too.The result is a very hairy four days for Clayton. Every character we bump into is sweating tension from every pore because everyone is plugged-in in some way. Everyone has something at stake, especially Clayton himself. Tom Wilkinson plays Arthur Edens, chief lawyer on the $6 billion lawsuit who's off his meds and apparently three fries short of a Happy Meal... or is he? Clayton's job is to get him back on track before all hell breaks loose, but maybe there's no way off this rollercoaster except by jumping.A great movie starts with a great script. Great scripts tend to attract great actors. The combination of the two often means great performances. Sprinkle some good direction over the concoction and you've got a winner.

1134186,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00121QGPY,Marc Cabir Davis,"[4, 9]","Its so ironic that every film that paces itself slowly and takes 'time to build' and features remotely A-list actors, is immediately hailed as a classic these days. Such is the case with ""Michael Clayton"", a decidedly B-Grade film all dressed up in A-Grade packaging. Of course, at the end of 2007, critics were notoriously tripping over themselves to call this turkey the 'best film of the year'. How such a tag can be given to such nonsense is debatable, but it also supports the theory that if you get enough people to say that something is good, the general public will soon start accepting that its good as well. In ""Michael Clayton""'s case, it is especially bizarre considering this film is so poorly made, so poorly acted, that everyone looks extremely happy at the end when the credits roll.Special mention must be made of the ten minute long scene during the end credits when the camera 'lovingly' focusses on George Clooney's face as he sits in a taxi doing NOTHING. Seriously. The normally wooden actor looks positively terrified as he struggles to come up with even one emotion, and at the end he decides not to show any emotion at all. This was by far the worst scene of the entire film as it reduced the movies' nothingness to even MORE nothingness. Literally.The movie supposedly chronicles Michael's victory over U-North, a firm that is 'evil' and 'conniving' and whose spokesperson and head is played by Tilda Swinton. The woman won an Oscar for this role. She is barely in the movie for fifteen minutes (seriously). When she does have screentime, she has only one expression - a stiff upper lip and a very corporate expression that is the easiest thing in the world to pull off. The rest of the time the camera follows her laying her clothes out on her bed and deciding what to wear. This is an Oscar-worthy performance? I simply do not understand. That was no good acting or bad acting here. There was just no acting. Period.There is a scene where George Clooney's car explodes and he realizes that he was the target of a car-bomb. Watch his expressions in this scene to rediscover just how horrible and useless an actor he is. Do this people undergo auditions to get these parts? I think not. He shows no surprise or sadness or shock, and goes through the motions until the mind-numbingly boring finale that is supposed to 'knock your socks off', but just comes and goes.This is a long film, with no story, no heart, and definitely no soul OR talent. However, scene for scene, it caters to people who like coming up with 'serious' films on their year-end lists. I like intelligent cinema and world cinema with a passion, and this really tested my patience. It didn't say anything one way or the other, and after a long time I discovered that I had seen a film that was a 'waste of space'. Here was two hours of my life I am not getting back. What a pity. The script lagged, the acting was terrible, and the direction was shoddy. I usually have at least one good thing to say about a movie, but I really can't lie and say anything nice about this one.Avoid like the plague. There are much better films to watch from last year.

The plot regarding the UNorth case is just a scene-setter and contrary to what some other reviewers have said I didn't find it unduly complicated or slow. Mr Clayton is a man who is apparently successful - defined by his corporate, private jet, world - but is hugely unfulfilled; Tom Wilkinson's character (Arthur Edens) similarly so. Each in their own way is miserable, we see much of Clayton's non-work life where even then he is required to be welded to his `phone, but not so much of Edens'. The apartment where Edens `lives' (when not at the office or on the road) is not exactly luxurious. So each of them `want out', Edens from his job and Clayton - it seems - from `everything'. Casting aside the mental health aspects, how many people, I wonder, would like to have rebelled against interminable meetings as did Edens, to go out in one grand futile gesture perhaps.The scene with Clayton and the three horses is exquisite, well acted and played with the correct level of pathos. Other early scenes build the characters on which the film depends and, yes, there are no car chases nor exploding helicopters so I can see why some of the other reviewers would find it boring.We see how Karen Crowder responds to pressure, so someone who again seems to live the corporate high life, in this case in charge of a large department and being a `key client', is reduced to being just a person on their own who makes interesting decisions from a strange set of values. Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) begins the film as powerful and in complete command of his universe but we see by the end that corporate machinations within his firm render him to be just someone else having his strings pulled so he is not the master of his own destiny, albeit well remunerated.This is a film that you have to watch rather than allow to wash over you; it has a great central performance around which all of the other characters revolve.",5,"Great performance, interesting characters.",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2032,"['saw', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'George', 'Clooney', 'main', 'obviously', 'plot', 'regarding', 'UNorth', 'case', 'just', 'scene-setter', 'contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'unduly', 'complicated', 'slow', 'Mr', 'Clayton', 'man', 'who', 'apparently', 'successful', 'defined', 'corporate', 'private', 'jet', 'world', 'hugely', 'unfulfilled', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'similarly', 'so', 'own', 'way', 'miserable', 'see', 'much', 'Clayton', 'non-work', 'life', 'where', 'even', 'then', 'required', 'be', 'welded', 'phone', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Edens', 'apartment', 'where', 'Edens', 'lives', 'when', 'not', 'office', 'road', 'not', 'exactly', 'luxurious', 'want', 'Edens', 'job', 'Clayton', 'everything', 'Casting', 'mental', 'health', 'aspects', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'wonder', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'rebelled', 'interminable', 'meetings', 'did', 'Edens', 'go', 'out', 'one', 'grand', 'futile', 'gesture', 'perhaps.The', 'scene', 'Clayton', 'three', 'horses', 'exquisite', 'well', 'acted', 'played', 'correct', 'level', 'pathos', 'Other', 'early', 'scenes', 'build', 'characters', 'film', 'yes', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'exploding', 'helicopters', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'find', 'boring.We', 'see', 'how', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'pressure', 'someone', 'who', 'again', 'live', 'corporate', 'high', 'life', 'case', 'charge', 'large', 'department', 'being', 'key', 'client', 'reduced', 'being', 'just', 'person', 'own', 'who', 'interesting', 'decisions', 'strange', 'set', 'values', 'Marty', 'Bach', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'film', 'powerful', 'complete', 'command', 'universe', 'see', 'end', 'corporate', 'machinations', 'firm', 'be', 'just', 'someone', 'else', 'having', 'strings', 'pulled', 'so', 'not', 'master', 'own', 'destiny', 'albeit', 'well', 'remunerated.This', 'film', 'have', 'watch', 'rather', 'allow', 'wash', 'great', 'central', 'performance', 'other', 'characters', 'revolve']",N/A

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","In ""Michael Clayton"" George Clooney plays the eponymous character, the lawyer at a large firm who has the job of cleaning up unsavory things that happen around the edges of the firm and its clients.Sidney Pollack gives a respectable performance as the head of the firm.  Tom Wilkinson is brilliant as one of the leading attorneys of the film who has become more than a little unhinged by the fact that his practice regularly defends corporate criminals.Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, an icy lawyer for a competing firm with the current corporation in big-stakes litigation.  Her character is climbing up the corporate legal ladder as quickly as possible, and she intuits that some of her goals may be achieved by means that are far removed from legal.  One of the greatest scenes in the film involves Karen arranging a hit - an arena she's willing to enter, but one where she lacks experience.Writer Tony Gilroy also directs, and his script is magnificent.  The opening thirty minutes are confusing as the opening scene is followed by a flashback, but by the time the narrative again reaches the opening sequence you realize that you've been in the hands of a master.Greatest praise is for George Clooney.  As good as the writing, direction and other actors are, it would simply be a lesser film without Mr. Clooney's work.  Michael Clayton is a tortured man - a lawyer at a large, successful firm, but somehow less than he imagined himself.

And, for me, this actually works, cause it not only gives us that bit of nostalgic feeling but it also has a way to make the film fresh and not dated.The film's title refers to the main character, Michael Clayton, a 'fixer' at a big time law firm. So essentially, his job is to clean up messes in trials. His next assingment finds himself investigating the seemingly mental breakdown of one of the top attorney's in his firm, Arthur Edens. But, to him, this is no big surprise since Eden's has had a history of mental illness. But ss he investiagtes his clients bizzare behavior, he uncovers something far more sinister going on that may very well affect the very company his firm is backing.What really got me was the first twentey minutes of the film. At first, you think that this is just the starting scene but then, all of a sudden, the tables are turned and you realize this takes place in the future, so essentially after that you begin to wonder 'okay, what happened then? was there some big clues given?' just really getting you to think what on earth happened over those past few days? Not only that but there are a few surprise moments in the film that completly took me by surprise, just so unexpected, and yet if you re-view the movie, you actually see that this was suppose to happen. That's the other thing about this film, the script is just so labyrinth that you really have to view it a second time to get a full grasp of the situation.Now, all the perfomers in this do supurb. George Clooney was just as great as ever, doing a very well controled performence that really detaches him from that suave and savvy George we know more of. Tom Wilkinson is great in his role as the unstable attorny, never once going overboard and Tilda Swinton pulls of the right combination of obsesive preperation and icy chill to produce a very subtle yet chlling villianess.In response to the Oscars, and this is my own opinion. As much as I love Tilda, I don't feel she should have won the Oscar (She should have been nominated for her role as the White Witch).

And the striking thing about ""Michael Clayton"" is how Gilroy has written ironic, conflicted, complicated characters that are at once ""good"" (and in the world that Gilroy has created here...this is in itself a term that is up for interpretation) yet are often bad as in unethical, mean, misanthropic. These characters can and do betray themselves and others: There's no one to truly love or hate, from Sydney Pollack's quietly devious law firm CEO, to Tom Wilkinson's holy madman of an ace courtroom defense attorney, to Tilda Swinton as a tricky senior partner in nice suits that peel off to reveal sweaty armpits and a gift for rationalization. Even our hero, Michael Clayton as portrayed by George Clooney is a loser: a 12 year veteran at his law firm who is utilized as a bag man, a fixer usually dispatched to do what amounts to private eye work.: cleaning up the firm's client messes. Clayton is a failure both professionally and personally: a failure as a father, brother, husband and Clooney strikes just the right notes here as Clayton struggles, fights to regain his dignity both as an officer of the court and more importantly as a father and a human being.The central plot revolves around a large chemical firm's responsibility for sickness and deaths in a farm community and because Gilroy weaves and bobs among the big ensemble cast and among the various plot points, I was hard pressed to figure out just exactly what was going on for the first half hour. But this is to Gilroy's credit: he refuses to foreshadow or explain thus adding texture and ambiguity to the film.Moral and social dilemmas multiply as ""Michael Clayton"" races to its exciting denouement: a denouement that satisfies both emotionally and morally.

You want a congressman bought, a hit-and-run handled, a green card obtained, you go see him. The firm has been involved for years in a class action suit in which U-North, a huge agribusiness corporation, is accused of killing off a couple of hundred small farm operators with carcinogenic chemicals, and it's all coming down to the wire when the lead attorney, a manic depressive, goes off his meds and publicly off his nut, and then begins making the case for the other side. U-North can't have that, especially since there's a highly incriminating memo floating around. Karen Crowder, the new corporate counsel, anxious for a win to kick off her career, can only think of one way to handle the situation. What's a murder or two compared to a $3 billion lawsuit, right?

During decades, directors and screenwriters have presented -some with more success than others- stories about justice ups and downs, stories about facts and circumstances that often become stiff machinations where the blind lady wins, others not so much. That's why when I went to see Michael Clayton, my hopes weren't too high, since I thought I would find the same worn out formula: two lawyers, a villain, and the classic confrontation in a courtroom with a foreseeable and boring verdict.How wrong I was.And my first mistake was to tag Michael Clayton as a legal thriller. Yes, it's about lawyers; yes, it has lots of suspense, and yes, it's a drama, but it's so much than the meaning of all these words. All thanks to his director, Tony Gilroy, who has outsmarted all those movie clich&eacute;s we've seen for 30 years. Instead of that, the director has weaved several subplots in a story that unfolds slowly but in a way that keeps us alert and interested, filling in the blanks, without losing emotion.George Clooney is Michael Clayton. A man that works in the shadows, solving other peoples problems, without much glory. Clayton is the best fixer, but behind his apparent success lays a man troubled with debt, vice, a failed marriage, family issues and above all, tired of his lifestyle and a job that doesn't bring any satisfaction.Clayton's life complicates when a colleague and friend, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), suffers a nervous breakdown that jeopardizes one of the firm's most important clients. Clayton is sent to control the situation, but he finds an Arthur decided to reveal the dirty laundry on their client.Conscience is the main theme in Michael Clayton, since the characters expose the weariness produced by selling it to the highest bidder. However, the movie doesn't try to criticize the human behavior, but shows the situations and surprises given just by taken the right choice, and to see what others are capable of doing when you stop following their game.All the actors are at the top of their game in Michael Clayton, not a single performance is wasted. Director Tony Gilroy presents his message in an no-nonsense way, and even though it appears he gives us a climatic finale of justice served, the last scene leaves us with an image of Michael Clayton that puts in our mouth a sweet and sour flavor, the very same we have when found ourselves winners in a war that's already lost.",5,Moral bankruptcy,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2479,"['Legal', 'thrillers', 'are', 'one', 'genres', 'more', 'exploded', 'cinema', 'decades', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'presented', '-some', 'more', 'success', 'others-', 'stories', 'justice', 'ups', 'downs', 'stories', 'facts', 'circumstances', 'often', 'become', 'stiff', 'machinations', 'where', 'blind', 'lady', 'wins', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'hopes', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'thought', 'would', 'find', 'same', 'worn', 'formula', 'two', 'lawyers', 'villain', 'classic', 'confrontation', 'courtroom', 'foreseeable', 'boring', 'verdict.How', 'wrong', 'was.And', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'tag', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'legal', 'thriller', 'Yes', 'lawyers', 'yes', 'lots', 'suspense', 'yes', 'drama', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', 'words', 'thanks', 'director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'who', 'outsmarted', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'ve"", 'seen', '30', 'years', 'Instead', 'director', 'weaved', 'several', 'subplots', 'story', 'slowly', 'way', 'alert', 'interested', 'filling', 'blanks', 'losing', 'emotion.George', 'Clooney', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'man', 'shadows', 'solving', 'other', 'peoples', 'problems', 'much', 'glory', 'Clayton', 'best', 'fixer', 'apparent', 'success', 'man', 'troubled', 'debt', 'vice', 'failed', 'marriage', 'family', 'issues', 'tired', 'lifestyle', 'job', ""n't"", 'bring', 'satisfaction.Clayton', 'life', 'when', 'colleague', 'friend', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'one', 'firm', 'most', 'important', 'clients', 'Clayton', 'sent', 'control', 'situation', 'Arthur', 'decided', 'reveal', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'client.Conscience', 'main', 'theme', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'characters', 'expose', 'weariness', 'produced', 'selling', 'highest', 'bidder', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'criticize', 'human', 'behavior', 'situations', 'surprises', 'given', 'just', 'taken', 'right', 'choice', 'see', 'what', 'others', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'when', 'stop', 'following', 'game.All', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'not', 'single', 'performance', 'wasted', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'message', 'no-nonsense', 'way', 'even', 'climatic', 'finale', 'justice', 'served', 'last', 'scene', 'image', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'mouth', 'sweet', 'sour', 'flavor', 'very', 'same', 'have', 'when', 'found', 'winners', 'war', 'already', 'lost']",N/A

Michael Clayton (George Clooney) has been a ""fixer"" for prestigious New York law firm for 17 years, content to stay in the shadows and do the dirty work without making partner. Senior partner Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has been working to defend UNorth, a company that manufactures agricultural chemicals, against a multi-billion dollar class action suit. When Arthur goes off of his medication for bipolar disorder and lands in jail in a guilt-ridden, manic state, Michael is sent to clean things up. Meanwhile, UNorth's senior council Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) has begun to suspect that Arthur is planning to undermine their case.Tom Wilkinson is a great character actor, and he makes Arthur the only memorable piece of this film. The story is presented in a disjointed fashion that keeps the audience wondering what's going on for an hour. There are a good half hour's worth of inconsequential scenes and lingering, moody camerawork. The film tries to imply that it is character-driven, when in fact it is plot-driven. George Clooney is charismatic, but there is little for the actor to grab hold of in his character. We know next to nothing about Michael. Subplots involving his son and brother are superfluous and superficial. If any of this made ""Michael Clayton"" a better film, I wouldn't object. But it only makes a pretentious film out of a story that is a straightforward, unabashed popcorn movie at its core.Thumbs down on Tony Gilroy's directorial debut. ""Michael Clayton"" is a garden-variety thriller with a recycled plot and a good cast. It would be fine as such. Gilroy's attempt to create an illusion of substance by making the film long and confusing is not only transparent, but it put audiences off what might otherwise have been a commercial success. 'Nothing like killing your own screenplay with empty stylistic flourishes. ""Michael Clayton"" is intermittently entertaining but not as enjoyable as it should be and not for as large an audience as it should have. I'm also a little surprised that Tony Gilroy wrote something so hackneyed, as he did a superb job writing sophisticated thrillers for the Bourne trilogy.The DVD (Warner 2008): Bonus features are 3 additional scenes with optional commentary and an feature commentary. This is a casual but constant commentary by writer/director Tony Gilroy and his brother, editor John Gilroy, who talk about the genesis of the film, getting it made and cast, and provide scene-by-scene comments on the performances, experiences while filming, setting up shots, and more.

He helps clients out of little scrapes, leverages his contacts to make the firm's problems go away, and in general operates under the radar to ensure that business continues to run smoothly.Clayton has a huge opportunity to work his magic when friend Arthur Edens (in a brilliant performance by Tom Wilkinson), one of the firm's senior partners, changes his opinion about one of the firm's major clients. Apparently, Edens becomes convinced that UNorth, a company he's been defending for 6 years in a contamination/poisoning case, was guilty all along. Edens snaps, creating a scene during a deposition and later collecting irrefutable evidence of UNorth's guilt.While Clayton scrambles to contain the situation, UNorth's new vice president, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton - amazing), devises her own way of silencing Edens. Pretty soon, bodies start turning up. And after a life of cleaning up other people's messes, Clayton has to decide what he really stands for.Performances are wonderful in this, and they are the primary reason to see this film (though it's not as much fun to watch Clooney ""think"" on screen as it is with other actors, such as Tom Hanks). The script moves along at a fairly quick clip, and I thought the majority of the action in this corporate thriller was very believable.What I liked best about this film, though, was the way it addressed the relativity of morality in today's society. For example, Clayton has spent his life kinda on the ""wrong"" side. He's been paid handsomely for it, and you don't get the feeling (at the beginning of the movie, anyway) that he's lost any sleep over it. But the film begs the question - Where does one draw the line? At what point can one no longer justify one's actions, even through today's hazy lens of right and wrong? What does a lifetime of such moral tiptoeing leave you with, what sort of legacy? These are the questions that, more and more, begin to drive Clayton towards the conclusion of the film.",4,Worth seeing for the great performances,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,2092,"['film', 'story', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'course', 'fixer', 'prestigious', 'New', 'York', 'law', 'firm', 'clients', 'little', 'scrapes', 'contacts', 'make', 'firm', 'problems', 'go', 'away', 'general', 'operates', 'radar', 'ensure', 'business', 'run', 'smoothly.Clayton', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'work', 'magic', 'when', 'friend', 'Arthur', 'Edens', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'one', 'firm', 'senior', 'partners', 'changes', 'opinion', 'one', 'firm', 'major', 'clients', 'Apparently', 'Edens', 'convinced', 'UNorth', 'company', 'been', 'defending', '6', 'years', 'contamination/poisoning', 'case', 'was', 'guilty', 'along', 'Edens', 'creating', 'scene', 'deposition', 'later', 'collecting', 'irrefutable', 'evidence', 'UNorth', 'guilt.While', 'Clayton', 'scrambles', 'contain', 'situation', 'UNorth', 'new', 'vice', 'president', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'amazing', 'own', 'way', 'silencing', 'Edens', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'bodies', 'start', 'turning', 'up', 'life', 'cleaning', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'messes', 'Clayton', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'for.Performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'primary', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Clooney', 'think', 'screen', 'other', 'actors', 'such', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'script', 'along', 'fairly', 'quick', 'clip', 'thought', 'majority', 'action', 'corporate', 'thriller', 'was', 'very', 'believable.What', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'addressed', 'relativity', 'morality', 'today', 'society', 'example', 'Clayton', 'spent', 'life', 'kinda', 'wrong', 'side', 'been', 'paid', 'handsomely', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'beginning', 'movie', 'anyway', 'lost', 'sleep', 'film', 'question', 'Where', 'one', 'draw', 'line', 'what', 'point', 'can', 'one', 'no', 'longer', 'justify', 'one', 'actions', 'even', 'today', 'hazy', 'lens', 'right', 'wrong', 'What', 'lifetime', 'such', 'moral', 'tiptoeing', 'leave', 'what', 'sort', 'legacy', 'are', 'questions', 'more', 'more', 'begin', 'drive', 'Clayton', 'conclusion', 'film']",N/A

While the plot is a typical corporate thriller which banks in occasionally on the audience's suspension of disbelief, it is far more realistic and well crafted than most films of its genre.George Clooney gives an intense performance, perhaps the best of his I've seen, as the titular Michael Clayton. His boyish, aging face conveys both competence and weariness. He is especially convincing in the miraculous, quiet moments of grace which occur both in a field and a taxi. As Arthur, Tom Wilkinson's English accent occasionally slips through. This does not prevent his portrayal as a passionate, intelligent man searching for morality, high on a chemical imbalance, from resonating. Tilda Swinton as executive Karen Crowder seems perhaps too calculated, but because Karen's intimate moments may be as fake as the calm face she presents to the world, Swinton's acting works perfectly. Acting is believable all around, including Denis O'Hare as a panicked, aggressive client and Sydney Pollack as Michael's efficient, realist boss.Robert Elswit cinematography is fantastically dark, subtle, and poetic. James Newton Howard's score is also touching, involving throbbing beats and lovely moments of clarity. Tony Gilroy's script is a little overly symbolic, but otherwise incredible. The corporate and legal worlds, Arthur's manic depression, and Michael's psychology and relation with his son are deeply authentic.This film is engrossing but not full of blockbuster trademarks. It also does not say anything original about the sins of the city, major corporations, and law firms, but what it does say it does in a novel manner.

""Michael Clayton'' isn't about a specific issue. It's not a rant against nuclear power, an attack on pharmaceutical companies, a critique of U.S. foreign policy or an appeal for consumers to stop buying conflict diamonds. But ""Michael Clayton'' does, I think, have a profound message. It asks us to reflect on what we're doing with our lives. None of the movie's villains comes off as particularly evil. They just seem to have found themselves in jobs that require them to do evil things. Two hired thugs seem like reliable handymen, unenthusiastic but willing to carry out a hit for cash. A mob enforcer comes across as a stern uncle. And Tilda Swinton - in a role that won her a well-deserved Oscar - is driven not so much by greed or lust for power as by a near-hysterical fear of career failure. As in-house council for a huge agro-chemical firm, she has neither the time nor the peace of mind to enjoy any of the money she makes. She seems uncomfortable, straining inside her own skin. And you see why she's so damaged: To climb the corporate ladder, she has had to abandon any semblance of a personal life and any sense of perspective about what is right and what is wrong.  Two other characters - hotshot lawyer Tom Wilkinson and all-purpose fixer George Clooney - have for different reasons been forced to reevaluate what they live and work for. Don't worry. ""Michael Clayton'' isn't a screed. It's a well-crafted legal thriller, driven by strong acting and Clooney's astonishing star power.

I am especially impressed with Swinton and Wilkinson who radiate in their challenging roles.  Clooney plays the main character, Michael Clayton, with panache and delivers one of the best scenes in the end.  The fight of the everday man against a large argiculture chemical company probably resonates quite closely with ""Erin Brockovich"".  However, this storyline has more action and character development of both the good and bad guys.  Overall, I would rate this film alongside with ""The Insider"".The DVD has less extras than would be expected.  The deleted scenes do not seem to add much to the film.

Ironically, I am not usually a big fan of pure dramas although this one did have a little bit of action in it. However, I'm usually more of a fan of sci fi, action and comedies but occasionally a drama will come along that really catches my attention. And for me this is the most recent one.I think this film along with ""Solaris"" is Clooney's finest work. The acting is very strong and believable. The other supporting acting is good, though not particularly brilliant in any way. There also was some good use of mood and color in this film. It looks like it was shot in winter, which would make sense given that the movie is sort of dark and gloomy. And there are scenes in New York where you see it is clearly a cold day out with a lot of gray and overcast skies. I thought that touch added nicely to the somber feel of the movie. And I liked the ending though I suppose it was a bit contrite what with good triumphing over evil and all. The film actually reminded me a bit of ""Changing Lanes"" with Ben Affleck. Not exactly the same storyline, but ""corrupt"" lawyers having a revelation that they don't want to continue living their life this way and there is a positive resolution at the film's conclusion.This is a film I can watch over and over again, and I spot something new each time.

1134225,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00121QGPY,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I liked a lot about this film.  First, the theme--others have objected that the bad-corporation-vs-the-good-little-people theme has been done already, but it's a worthy idea, one deserving of repetition.  (Does anyone complain that war films have already been done?)The story is good. I think the weakness of the film lies in where the emphasis was to be.  Is it a ""character driven"" tale of a man in crisis or is it a thriller? Since it is entitled after the main character, Michael Clayton, and since Clooney as Clayton is in almost every scene, it seems to me that this is supposed to be the tale of the journey of the hero.  Clayton is supposed to be a guy on the skids, divorced, not relating all that well to his only child, in big debt for a bad restaurant venture, battling a gambling addiction, and pushed to the lower rungs of the law firm where he's worked for years.  In a crisis involving the future of his law firm and his own career, he makes some decisions that redeem him to a state of lost innocence.It's a great idea. I just didn't see any of this in Clooney's performance.  Perhaps he's suffering from being a hot, successful movie star, but to me he looked like he just stepped off the cover of GQ--dapper, charming, classy and ever cool.  He reminds me of a latter day Cary Grant, who, it seems to me suffered from the same syndrome, although in the 50's when Grant made his best films, glamour and sophistication were more highly prized than depth of character.I loved Clooney in ""Oh Brother,"" when he played a goofy hillbilly.  I guess that was before he was moved up to the A-list of Hollywood hunks.  I'd like to see him show some vulnerability and ragged edges--it would have made this character much more believable and the story more touching.  He plays the whole film with the same expression on his face for all occasions--talking to his son, trying to get through to the manic-depressive co-worker,  begging his boss for a $70,000 loan, dealing with his drug addict brother, or having a mystic moment with three horses. He never sweats, musses his hair, or shows any of the desperation that the character is supposed to be feeling.This comes across almost as a James Bond film, with the slick, cool hero defeating the cause of evil, without breaking a sweat. (I confess I haven't seen any Bond films in a while---maybe they've been updated.)  There is plenty of sweat pouring out of Tilda Swinton as the arch enemy and plenty of crazed vulnerability from Tom Wilkinson as the mentally ill co-worker.  Some complain that both performances are a bit over-the-top and that may be so but at least they are emoting!  Likewise, the drug addicted brother who looks like he just stumbled out of a dumpster and the intense hit-and-run driver.  You really know where all of these folks are coming from.  Clooney just keeps on being gorgeous and cool.So, at the end, while we cheer his defeat of the bad guys, we don't really get it that he has changed.  We don't see it, cinematically---that's what movies are about--to show this.  Maybe the writer/director was so thrilled to get Clooney for the film that he didn't dare impose any real direction on him.My other objection to the film is that it is confusing. Lots of other reviewers here made the same complaint. It took me quite a while to figure out who all these folks were and what they had to do with each other.  That's a device that works well in some films--creating a sense of tension and curiosity.  But here it goes on too long and some people just loose interest, so that by the time we understand who they are, we don't care so much.  I know that linear time is considered pasee by some film makers but when you play with time in this way, it has to be done in a better way.Send Clooney to Actors' Studio!",4,Good story but could have been better,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,3792,"['liked', 'lot', 'film', 'First', 'theme', 'others', 'have', 'objected', 'bad-corporation-vs-the-good-little-people', 'theme', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'worthy', 'idea', 'one', 'deserving', 'repetition', 'Does', 'anyone', 'complain', 'war', 'films', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'story', 'good', 'think', 'weakness', 'film', 'where', 'emphasis', 'was', 'be', 'character', 'driven', 'tale', 'man', 'crisis', 'thriller', 'entitled', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Clooney', 'Clayton', 'almost', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'tale', 'journey', 'hero', 'Clayton', 'supposed', 'be', 'guy', 'skids', 'divorced', 'not', 'relating', 'well', 'only', 'child', 'big', 'debt', 'bad', 'restaurant', 'venture', 'battling', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'pushed', 'lower', 'rungs', 'law', 'firm', 'where', 'worked', 'years', 'crisis', 'involving', 'future', 'law', 'firm', 'own', 'career', 'decisions', 'redeem', 'state', 'lost', 'innocence.It', 'great', 'idea', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'Perhaps', 'suffering', 'being', 'hot', 'successful', 'movie', 'star', 'looked', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'cover', 'GQ', 'dapper', 'charming', 'classy', 'ever', 'cool', 'latter', 'day', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'suffered', 'same', 'syndrome', '50', 'when', 'Grant', 'made', 'best', 'films', 'glamour', 'sophistication', 'were', 'more', 'highly', 'prized', 'depth', 'character.I', 'loved', 'Clooney', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'when', 'played', 'goofy', 'hillbilly', 'guess', 'was', 'was', 'moved', 'up', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'hunks', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'show', 'vulnerability', 'ragged', 'edges', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'story', 'more', 'touching', 'whole', 'film', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'occasions', 'talking', 'son', 'trying', 'get', 'manic-depressive', 'co-worker', 'begging', 'boss', '70,000', 'loan', 'dealing', 'drug', 'addict', 'brother', 'having', 'mystic', 'moment', 'three', 'horses', 'never', 'hair', 'desperation', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling.This', 'across', 'almost', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'slick', 'cool', 'hero', 'defeating', 'cause', 'evil', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Bond', 'films', 'while', '-maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'updated', 'plenty', 'sweat', 'pouring', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'arch', 'enemy', 'plenty', 'crazed', 'vulnerability', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'mentally', 'ill', 'co-worker', 'complain', 'performances', 'are', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'least', 'are', 'emoting', 'Likewise', 'drug', 'addicted', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'stumbled', 'out', 'dumpster', 'intense', 'hit-and-run', 'driver', 'really', 'know', 'where', 'folks', 'are', 'coming', 'Clooney', 'just', 'being', 'gorgeous', 'cool.So', 'end', 'cheer', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'changed', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'cinematically', '-that', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'about', 'show', 'Maybe', 'writer/director', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'get', 'Clooney', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'impose', 'real', 'direction', 'him.My', 'other', 'objection', 'film', 'confusing', 'Lots', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'made', 'same', 'complaint', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'folks', 'were', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'other', 'device', 'well', 'films', 'creating', 'sense', 'tension', 'curiosity', 'here', 'too', 'long', 'people', 'just', 'loose', 'interest', 'time', 'understand', 'who', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'linear', 'time', 'considered', 'pasee', 'film', 'makers', 'when', 'play', 'time', 'way', 'be', 'done', 'better', 'way.Send', 'Clooney', 'Actors', 'Studio']",N/A

The tired old clich&eacute; John Grisham movies have been replaced instead by the lawyer as the `anti-hero'.  Thus the resolute and morally certain Atticus Finch is replaced by the confused and morally ambiguous Michael Clayton.  The lawyers of today's films are part of an already corrupt system who are more or less compromised from the very beginning.  Clooney's Michael Clayton knows how to do only one thing, and one thing well, and that is to be a fixer for his huge firm.  The price of being good at this, is that it has already cost Mr. Clayton his family, and the movie follows Mr. Clooney's character as he is about to lose his soul.  Clayton eventually has to make a decision as to what he has to do when he becomes enmeshed in a huge class action that threatens to bring everybody into its morally bankrupt black hole.  What Clayton does to resolve this shows not only his resourcefulness, but also may serve as sort of a re-birth that his friend Arthur (Tom Wilkinson) spoke of in the beginning of the film.

He is paid well but his gambling habit is taking the best of him.  At the age of 45 he is divorced, with no equity and no law partnership that would guarantee him steady income.  As he is working to find the way out and create a path for his ""second"" career, Michale stumbles across an old friend who in a fit of seemingly psychotic episode strips himself naked in front of the plaintiffs during the video deposition. We learn about corporate greed and corruption, separation of ethics and billable hours in law offices, personal reflection on the life we lead on both personal and professional level and choices we make along the way.  Tom Wilkinson, Sidney Pollack and George Clooney give startling performances.  Tilda Swinton who earned Oscar for her performance in this film this year for her role of a ""Lady Macbeth - like"" attorney fades by comparison.  Do not take me wrong -- I grew to be Ms. Swinton's fan since her performance in ""Orlando"", but this role seems to be waste of her talent.

1134230,A2DDDKF5NZMTFY,B00121QGPY,Regina McMenamin,"[3, 6]","Recommended to those who appreciate great dialogue and a fantastic ending, MICHAEL CLAYTON tells the story of a corporate attorney whose job it is to ""fix"" his clients' most unusual problems.  While the rest of the lawyers in his big time New York firm go to court, write briefs and advise companies about mundane legal issues, Clayton (played by George Clooney) is more like Mr. Wolfe in Pulp Fiction.Though his specialty is officially listed as Wills and Trusts, like Mr. Wolfe, Clayton actually plays clean up.  He is called in when a corporate client finds itself in tricky situations.  CEO just got caused a hit-and-run accident?  Call Clayton.  Partner just stripped himself nude in a deposition?  Call Clayton.Far from a traditional thriller, MICHAEL CLAYTON reveals the ending within the first few scenes and from there flashes back to develop the tension slowly -- without the crutch of dramatic music or special effects.Instead, writer and first time director Tony Gilroy presents the quiet struggle of a flawed 45-year old attorney who finds himself personally in debt to a Tony Soprano-like character, while professionally playing Super Nanny to a bi-polar litigator who is off his medication.Nearly inept at solving his own problems, Clayton uses all of connections and street smarts to solve his client's. That is, until the final tension-breaking scene, when Clayton confronts his troubling self-image.Steeped in tension, MICHAEL CLAYTON is a highly recommended film because it is both understated and nerve-wracking.

There are some time-shifts that are totally unexplained. Tony Gilroy's direction certainly kept the film intriguing at most levels, and Tom Wilkinson was remarkable in his supporting role. Tilda Swinton's character was not well-written, and a very complex character at that. There's no question that she's a brilliant actress, but there were some puzzle-pieces missing here. (That Oscar should've gone to Amy Ryan). So, my opinion is that ""Michael Clayton"" provides a lot of interesting tension and great acting, but the final result left me disappointed.

1134235,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B00121QGPY,R. Kyle,"[6, 7]","He just cleans up the messes other people leave behind.  That's what Michael Clayton (Clooney) tells a client of his firm who's just committed hit-and-run in the middle of the night. He finds the man a criminal attorney and drives off into the night--only to stop briefly by the side of the road to see some horses and get his car blown up.Next, we flash back to 4 days later.  Michael's called to Milwaukee where one of the best litigators in the firm Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has gone off his bipolar medication and had a meltdown during plaintiff depositions to the point of running around naked in the snow.  Edens is the lead attorney for their firm in defending UNorth, a huge chemical conglomerate that has spent 6 years and 50 million dollars in legal fees in defense of farmer's claims that their pesticide is toxic. It's up to Michael to clean up the mess--hopefully get Arthur back on his meds and functioning so the case can proceed.From there, the film takes us back forward over the next five days--to the car bombing--and beyond to the end.Time changes in any kind of media are always difficult.  For my companion and I, knowing the car bombing had taken place already and that Michael survived took a lot of suspense out of the film.  Also, Clooney and Wilkinson are who give the film momentum. The challenge Michael faces in getting help for a man who knows the New York State law about involuntary commitment is compelling--particularly when you realize that Michael really wants to help Eden.  Clooney's portrayal of Michael Clayton is very thorough and convincing--I believe both he and Tom Wilkinson have earned nominations for their roles in this film.Unfortunately, the overall film just didn't seem to merit the rave reviews that I have read.

She was so much better as the White Witch in 2005's Chronicles of Narnia, but of course received no nomination.

1134237,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00121QGPY,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","In the past, George Clooney has been, to me, more of a charming movie-star than a real ""actor.""  His best performances were when he turned on the charm and the smile, such as in OUT OF SIGHT, OCEANS 11 or O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  He excels at being a likeable cad.  In more ""serious"" roles, such as in THREE KINGS, he was helped by the sheer energy and excellence of the film itself.  To me, his Oscar win in SYRIANA was more of a nod to his political stances and to his willingness to endure weight-gain and brutal back pain.  But finally, in MICHAEL CLAYTON, he delivers a true dramatic performance, with depth of character and a willingness to put aside his natural charm WITHOUT having to gain weight or grow a beard.  He's the George Clooney we all recognize...but he's weighed down be guilt, lack of sleep and just a general sense of world-weariness.  He's feeling Weltschmertz!!  His clothes are all shades of gray, his hair and even his eyes (and the bags under them).  There is no color in this man's life.  So Clooney's costumer has designed this external look for him...but Clooney manages to internalize it as well.He plays a ""fixer"" for a HUGE law firm.  He gets clients out of legal jams, and operates on the fringes of the firm.  He's almost like their in-house private eye with a law degree.  He doesn't really get to practice law...he just has lots and lots of important contacts.  In the movie, he has been assigned to escort an attorney from the firm back to safety after said attorney (played by the always interesting and hugely underrated Tom  Wilkinson) goes a little crazy during a deposition.  Essentially, Wilkinson has succumbed to guilt over his role in a years-long defense of a chemical company that has probably poisoned hundreds of people with one of its products.  Unfortunately, his realization has also made him careless and manic (he's off his meds)...and thus he has become VERY dangerous to the case.Sydney Pollack plays a senior partner in the firm and Tilda Swinton plays the head in-house council for the big conglomerate.  Both of them maneuver and politic like old pros (none more smoothly and effectively than the perfectly cast Pollack)...and Swinton just may find she is in over her head...and may have to resort to measures that aren't exactly legal to protect her company.  Clooney is sucked in to all this mess.  At first, he doesn't care too much about the case (he's got some serious financial problems weighing him down)...but as things progress, he begins to see how he's being manipulated, and how the case itself has been manipulated.The trailers for the film don't make it look very action-packed...but all I can say is that it is LESS action-packed than that.  This is a talky film.  Lots of intense, sweaty, fraught conversations.  But it is well-written and directed by Tony Gilroy, who makes the verbal gymnastics and subtle plot turns quite riveting.  I believe that anyone aged about 21 or under would be bored silly by the film...it REQUIRES careful attention...but it also rewards that careful attention.  It is a film that deals in grays, not in black and white.  (Even though we know pretty easily who the bad guys are...that isn't the point...it's the journey of Michael Clayton that is gray.)  You dare not even take a bathroom break watching this film...each little scene advances either the plot or the characters in critical ways.I must also say that mid-way through the film, a murder is committed that is about as creepy and bluntly realistic as any murder in a thriller could be.  It is the opposite of showy...it's quick, grimy, heartless and believable.  It was a scene that sucked the breath out of the audience.On the other hand, the only serious flaw in the film was an ending that was a bit to pat and ""Hollywood-ish.""  The final few minutes are richly satisfying on a gut level...but when you step back just a bit, they really don't ring entirely true.But that is a minor flaw.  I give the film 4.5 stars, and will round up to 5.  And this is from a guy who REALLY dislikes the ""real-life"" George Clooney and his simple-minded politics.  But I've got to give him his due here...it's a very good performance.  (Stick around for the long closing credits sequence.  Clooney actually does his best work in what must have been an extremely tricky bit...and is completely silent.)",5,"Smart, intense film...and Clooney's best performance.",1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,4358,"['past', 'George', 'Clooney', 'been', 'more', 'charming', 'movie-star', 'real', 'actor', 'best', 'performances', 'were', 'when', 'turned', 'charm', 'smile', 'such', 'OUT', 'OF', 'SIGHT', 'OCEANS', '11', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'being', 'likeable', 'cad', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'such', 'THREE', 'KINGS', 'was', 'helped', 'sheer', 'energy', 'excellence', 'film', 'Oscar', 'win', 'SYRIANA', 'was', 'more', 'nod', 'political', 'stances', 'willingness', 'endure', 'weight-gain', 'brutal', 'back', 'pain', 'finally', 'MICHAEL', 'CLAYTON', 'true', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'depth', 'character', 'willingness', 'put', 'aside', 'natural', 'charm', 'WITHOUT', 'having', 'gain', 'weight', 'grow', 'beard', 'George', 'Clooney', 'recognize', 'weighed', 'down', 'be', 'guilt', 'lack', 'sleep', 'just', 'general', 'sense', 'world-weariness', 'feeling', 'Weltschmertz', 'clothes', 'are', 'shades', 'gray', 'hair', 'even', 'eyes', 'bags', 'color', 'man', 'life', 'So', 'Clooney', 'costumer', 'designed', 'external', 'look', 'Clooney', 'internalize', 'well.He', 'fixer', 'HUGE', 'law', 'firm', 'clients', 'legal', 'jams', 'fringes', 'firm', 'almost', 'in-house', 'private', 'eye', 'law', 'degree', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'practice', 'law', 'just', 'lots', 'lots', 'important', 'contacts', 'movie', 'been', 'assigned', 'escort', 'attorney', 'firm', 'back', 'safety', 'said', 'attorney', 'played', 'always', 'interesting', 'hugely', 'underrated', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'little', 'crazy', 'deposition', 'Essentially', 'Wilkinson', 'succumbed', 'guilt', 'role', 'years-long', 'defense', 'chemical', 'company', 'probably', 'poisoned', 'hundreds', 'people', 'one', 'products', 'Unfortunately', 'realization', 'also', 'made', 'careless', 'manic', 'meds', 'thus', 'become', 'VERY', 'dangerous', 'case.Sydney', 'Pollack', 'senior', 'partner', 'firm', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'head', 'in-house', 'council', 'big', 'conglomerate', 'maneuver', 'politic', 'old', 'pros', 'none', 'more', 'smoothly', 'effectively', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Pollack', 'Swinton', 'just', 'may', 'find', 'head', 'may', 'have', 'resort', 'measures', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'legal', 'protect', 'company', 'Clooney', 'sucked', 'mess', 'first', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'got', 'serious', 'financial', 'problems', 'weighing', 'down', 'things', 'progress', 'see', 'how', 'being', 'manipulated', 'how', 'case', 'been', 'manipulated.The', 'trailers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'look', 'very', 'action-packed', 'can', 'say', 'LESS', 'action-packed', 'talky', 'film', 'Lots', 'intense', 'sweaty', 'fraught', 'conversations', 'well-written', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'who', 'verbal', 'gymnastics', 'subtle', 'plot', 'quite', 'riveting', 'believe', 'anyone', 'aged', '21', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'silly', 'film', 'REQUIRES', 'careful', 'attention', 'also', 'careful', 'attention', 'film', 'grays', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'Even', 'know', 'pretty', 'easily', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'point', 'journey', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'gray', 'dare', 'not', 'even', 'take', 'bathroom', 'break', 'watching', 'film', 'little', 'scene', 'advances', 'plot', 'characters', 'critical', 'ways.I', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'mid-way', 'film', 'murder', 'committed', 'about', 'creepy', 'bluntly', 'realistic', 'murder', 'thriller', 'could', 'be', 'opposite', 'showy', 'quick', 'grimy', 'heartless', 'believable', 'was', 'scene', 'sucked', 'breath', 'audience.On', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'serious', 'flaw', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'pat', 'Hollywood-ish', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'richly', 'satisfying', 'gut', 'level', 'when', 'step', 'back', 'just', 'bit', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'entirely', 'true.But', 'minor', 'flaw', 'give', 'film', '4.5', 'stars', 'will', 'round', 'up', '5', 'guy', 'who', 'REALLY', 'real-life', 'George', 'Clooney', 'simple-minded', 'politics', ""'ve"", 'got', 'give', 'due', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Stick', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'sequence', 'Clooney', 'actually', 'best', 'work', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'tricky', 'bit', 'completely', 'silent']",N/A

1134240,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00121QGPY,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","This is a good, entertaining movie.  It was also the last movie nominated for Best Picture that I saw and I have to say, I can't understand how it got a nomination.  I don't for an instance regret having seen it, but it wouldn't make a list of the 25 best movies that I had seen released in 2007.  It is solid Hollywood filmmaking, but apart from a couple of excellent performances, it is nothing especially remarkable.  Of course, if it hadn't gotten so many Oscar nominations, we'd all be free to talk about what a fun, nice movie this is.  But with all the nominations, it is forced to pretensions of excellence that it simply does not possess.The central story is about the efforts of a agribusiness to cover up the harm it knowingly did to individuals through some of its chemicals.  One might expect this to be a heavily political film as a result.  It is not.  The agribusiness is positioned as the bad guy, but not much more.  I won't delve deeply into the plot, since pretty much all the film has to offer is its story, along with some excellent performances.  And the best performances are very, very good indeed.Tilda Swinton steals nearly ever scene she is in.  I have found her career to be fascinating.  For the longest time, it appeared that she was almost refusing to have a successful commercial career.  I knew her work in her thirties from a string of independent and foreign films, the best known of which was probably ORLANDO, in which she played the title character.  The usual wisdom is that a actress in her forties is not going to find many good roles in Hollywood.  But the previously aloof and unavailable Swinton has found a host of wonderful role in her mid-forties and beyond.  She had a bevy of new roles lined up before winning the Oscar.  I see no reason why they will decrease now.  The important thing is that her success is based entirely on her amazing talent.  Hers has not been the usual path to stardom, but more power to her.Tom Wilkinson has racked up a host of wonderful performances since achieving something like stardom in THE FULL MONTY and his Oscar nomination here is definitely deserved.  Playing an attorney driven insane by his defense of a client he realizes has knowingly poisoned the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against them, Wilkinson's role drives much of the plot of the film.George Clooney is reliably solid in the film's title role, but I suspect his nomination had more to do with his being a widely liked and admired person than in the merits of his performance.  Mind you, he was quite good in the role, but if it had been any of a number of similarly gifted actors in the same role I do not think they would have received a nomination.  Still, it is a good addition to his acting resume.My recommendation is:  see this film, but don't expect a masterpiece.  It is a good, solid, entertaining film.  For my money it was the weakest and least deserving of the films nominated for the Oscar this year.",4,"A nice, pleasant, safe, slightly bland movie",1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,2971,"['good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'movie', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'saw', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'got', 'nomination', 'do', ""n't"", 'instance', 'regret', 'having', 'seen', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'list', '25', 'best', 'movies', 'had', 'seen', 'released', '2007', 'solid', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'apart', 'couple', 'excellent', 'performances', 'nothing', 'especially', 'remarkable', 'course', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'so', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominations', ""'d"", 'be', 'free', 'talk', 'what', 'fun', 'nice', 'movie', 'nominations', 'forced', 'pretensions', 'excellence', 'simply', 'not', 'possess.The', 'central', 'story', 'efforts', 'agribusiness', 'cover', 'up', 'harm', 'knowingly', 'did', 'individuals', 'chemicals', 'One', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'heavily', 'political', 'film', 'result', 'not', 'agribusiness', 'positioned', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'deeply', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'offer', 'story', 'excellent', 'performances', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'indeed.Tilda', 'Swinton', 'steals', 'nearly', 'ever', 'scene', 'have', 'found', 'career', 'be', 'fascinating', 'longest', 'time', 'appeared', 'was', 'almost', 'refusing', 'have', 'successful', 'commercial', 'career', 'knew', 'work', 'thirties', 'string', 'independent', 'foreign', 'films', 'best', 'known', 'was', 'probably', 'ORLANDO', 'played', 'title', 'character', 'usual', 'wisdom', 'actress', 'forties', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'many', 'good', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'previously', 'aloof', 'unavailable', 'Swinton', 'found', 'host', 'wonderful', 'role', 'mid-forties', 'had', 'bevy', 'new', 'roles', 'lined', 'up', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'will', 'decrease', 'now', 'important', 'thing', 'success', 'based', 'entirely', 'amazing', 'talent', 'Hers', 'not', 'been', 'usual', 'path', 'stardom', 'more', 'power', 'her.Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'racked', 'up', 'host', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'achieving', 'something', 'stardom', 'THE', 'FULL', 'MONTY', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'here', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'Playing', 'attorney', 'driven', 'insane', 'defense', 'client', 'knowingly', 'poisoned', 'plaintiffs', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'Wilkinson', 'role', 'much', 'plot', 'film.George', 'Clooney', 'reliably', 'solid', 'film', 'title', 'role', 'suspect', 'nomination', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'being', 'widely', 'liked', 'admired', 'person', 'merits', 'performance', 'Mind', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'number', 'similarly', 'gifted', 'actors', 'same', 'role', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'nomination', 'Still', 'good', 'addition', 'acting', 'resume.My', 'recommendation', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'good', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'film', 'money', 'was', 'weakest', 'least', 'deserving', 'films', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'year']",N/A
1134241,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00121QGPY,Robert Morris,"[0, 0]","Those who wish to obtain a detailed plot summary are advised to search elsewhere. My purpose now is to explain why I enjoyed this film so much. There are several reasons. Here are three. First, There is a multi-dimensional texture of ambiguity to the plot development because, until the film's conclusion, there are so many unanswered questions about, for example, relationships between and among the major characters. That is why most of the action occurs at night. Indeed, it can be argued that, as written and then directed by Tony Gilroy, the darker components of human nature (i.e. greed, ambition, mendacity, betrayal) comprise the primary subject of the film. With the obvious exceptions of Michael Clayton (George Clooney) and Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), there is an almost total lack of nobility in the behavior of the main characters.Also, I liked the pace of the plot. Separately and together, both Clayton and Edens seem to be wandering through a minefield. They are desperate to survive what become for Edens, eventually, life-threatening perils and for Clayton, throughout the film, what continue to be serious financial problems. Gilroy does not allow the plot to drag, nor does he rush through the sequence of events. He allows the story (on several separate but connected levels) to unfold over a four-day period.Finally, I greatly admire Clooney's performance as Clayton, a ""fixer"" for a major law firm who seems unable to fix any of the broken parts in his personal life. He is still recovering emotionally from a failed marriage, has strained relations with his family (especially with two brothers), struggles with mixed results to be a good father to a son he obviously adores, and - meanwhile - is about to lose ownership of a restaurant that was to have enabled him to leave the law firm. Clooney brilliantly captures Clayton's tenderness and desperation as well as his sharply honed problem-solving skills. When we first encounter him, Clayton is what Graham Greene would characterize as a ""burnt out case."" By the end of the film, he has survived (but barely) and stares blankly at nothing, drifting somewhere between emptiness and despair.Of all the films I have seen during the past year, this one and The Departed are among the few that I continue to think about each day and that I am eager to see again.

Zwick,"[22, 27]","***1/2If ""Michael Clayton"" didn't seem like quite so obvious a rehash of Sidney Lumet`s ""The Verdict,"" I might be inclined to recommend it more highly.  The basic premise of both films revolves around a dissolute legal type who achieves personal redemption when he lands on the ""right"" side of a class action lawsuit.  Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the best thing to be said for the makers of ""Michael Clayton"" is that, if they had to find a movie to emulate, they at least chose one worth emulating.Michael Clayton is no longer a practicing attorney himself but rather a ""fixer"" or ""bagman"" for a powerful legal firm, a man whose job it is to troubleshoot or run interference for any potential problems that might arise in one of its many cases.  As with most such protagonists, Clayton spends so much time at his job that he doesn't have much of a personal life going for him:  he's a divorced father with a serious gambling problem, a drug-addicted brother, and a failed business that has him in hock to the tune of $80,000.  One of the firm's biggest clients is a chemical company whose powerful weed killing formula has allegedly resulted in serious medical conditions and even death for some of the farmers and their families who've come in contact with it.  Clayton is called into action when the lead attorney for the defense suddenly goes berserk at a taped hearing, stripping off his clothes and launching into a Howard Beale-like rant for the other side.  As he delves further into the case, Clayton undergoes a metamorphosis from cynical corporate water-carrier to enlightened populist do-gooder, finding personal redemption and fulfillment by helping the common man in his fight for justice.""Michael Clayton"" is, for the most part, a solid legal thriller, serious, intelligent and extremely well-served in the acting department.  The ""little man vs. vile corporation"" theme has been pretty much played out by this time, but there are enough twists and turns in the plot and enough decent red herrings to keep us interested at least on a superficial level.  The story goes through periods of murkiness when it isn't always clear what exactly is going on, but writer/director Tony Gilroy manages to straighten out most of the confusion in time for the finale.  The moody score, bleak winter settings and dank cinematography all contribute to the chilly atmosphere that permeates the film.In a role tailor-made for his acting style - stoic yet heartfelt, rugged yet vulnerable - George Clooney carries the weight of the film on his sturdy shoulders.  The gifted Tilda Swinton doesn't fare quite so well with her character - a ruthless, emotionally unstable career woman with no personal life and no romantic prospects, a character, quite frankly, that feels just a trifle out-of-date in the year 2007.  Tom Wilkinson, Sydney Pollack and Michael O'Keefe excel in minor roles.""Michael Clayton"" is a proficient, professional legal drama that never cuts as deeply or touches the heart as profoundly as one would like for it to do.

1134244,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B00121QGPY,Royce Callaway,"[3, 5]","I want to say that I saw this film and really enjoyed it, but I don't think it was a film worthy of the rave reviews I see here.  It is a film that moves along and keeps your attention but once you have seen it you are left with a lot of questions because the film has some substantial logic flaws.  What was the point of the horses?  Why?  Why did he go to the card game when he had already paid off the gamblers?  Why were the bad guys still watching Arthur's apartment once it was sealed?  Why?  If the litigation had dragged on 6 years why had the new CEO signed the incriminating memo?  That would have been written at the outset.  Nevertheless these flaws only become relevant on reflection and do nothing to detract from the film as you watch it.  So the script is well written but flawed.  The cinemaphotography is good although  some of the closeups were way too close and did not show Clooney at his best. The editing has some issues as it leaves you wondering about how things happen.  Of course there was only one obligatory explosion and the now de rigeur profanity.  Hollywood seems to think that everyone uses extreme profanity in ordinary conversation in lieu of punctuation.  Of course this film also incorporates the usual subtext found in most films today and that is the government, CIA. Corporations,and executives are by definition greedy, corrupt, and rape the environment in the name of profit.  However, this message is delivered with great skill by Clooney, Wilkinson, and Swinton.  The camera was not kind to Clooney but he demonstrates his substanitial skill as an actor.  Wilkinson also does a good job as Arthur although he leans toward over acting -- still a very good job.  Swinton had the most difficult role and did a very good job as a person who is clearly in over her head.  She really doesn't know how to cope and is barely able to maintain her composure as events spin out of control.  It is unlikely she will get the praise she deserves because she is overshadowed by Clooney's ability and fame.  This is a good film and I really enjoyed it but in the end it is just another movie that shows how the hero fights ""the man"".

1134246,A387BD735MI50R,B00121QGPY,R. Schultz,"[4, 4]","George Clooney plays a law firm ""fixer"" here. I early began to suspect that that post might be as much of a cinematic invention as ""The Cooler,"" a person casinos presumably hire to jinx people off winning streaks. In his DVD commentary, the Director of ""Michael Clayton"" says he asked law firms if indeed there was such a job description as ""fixer,"" someone who solves problems for them outside the confines of strict legal protocol. Most of them said there were ""fixers,"" but that they didn't have any such person currently working for them. They would steer him to some other law firm that they believed used a fixer's services. That firm would in turn relay him farther on down the street to still yet another firm. And so on, always seemingly keeping him one step away. Or else the various firms said they might have employed a fixer in the past, but didn't anymore. So this job title becomes almost urban legend - something that happened to someone else, at some other time.I would have been content to accept this fiction for the purposes of an interesting movie. What I did find disappointing though was that Clooney never actually seemed to fix anything. At least in the early montage of problems we see being presented to him to establish his role, he does nothing helpful or clever. For example, he's called to the home of one of the firm's long-time clients to help this client sidestep a possible hit-and-run charge. When Coonley arrives, all he does is tell the client he'll refer him to a criminal attorney. The client (and perhaps the movie viewer) is rightfully indignant at this lack of legerdemain. Then in the DVD bonus material, we see another scene that was cut from the final film, in which Clooney tells his former mate that he made a problem disappear. When she asks ""How?"" - all he does is wink.This is frustrating to the viewer, and seems to stem from a certain amount of lazy script-writing. In the related genre of heist films, such as Clooney's ""Ocean's 11,"" we expect to see at least one clever filching technique demonstrated along the way.In general, it was hard for me to see how this film went so far towards getting an Academy Award. Other problems with the writing include the use of coincidence, and the use of clich&eacute; (once again the Big Corporation looms as a fictional Silkwood foe, a diabolical, ubiquitous evil).However Tom Wilkinson's performance as the loony, but still brilliant lawyer - is truly memorable and rescues this whole movie from its sort of improbable, forgettable plot.",3,The Fixer Needs Some Fixing,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2533,"['George', 'Clooney', 'law', 'firm', 'fixer', 'here', 'early', 'began', 'suspect', 'post', 'might', 'be', 'much', 'cinematic', 'invention', 'Cooler', 'person', 'casinos', 'presumably', 'hire', 'jinx', 'people', 'winning', 'streaks', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'asked', 'law', 'firms', 'indeed', 'was', 'such', 'job', 'description', 'fixer', 'someone', 'who', 'problems', 'confines', 'strict', 'legal', 'protocol', 'Most', 'said', 'were', 'fixers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'person', 'currently', 'working', 'would', 'steer', 'other', 'law', 'firm', 'believed', 'used', 'fixer', 'services', 'firm', 'would', 'turn', 'relay', 'farther', 'street', 'still', 'yet', 'firm', 'so', 'always', 'seemingly', 'keeping', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'else', 'various', 'firms', 'said', 'might', 'have', 'employed', 'fixer', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'So', 'job', 'title', 'almost', 'urban', 'legend', 'something', 'happened', 'someone', 'else', 'other', 'time.I', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'accept', 'fiction', 'purposes', 'interesting', 'movie', 'What', 'did', 'find', 'disappointing', 'though', 'was', 'Clooney', 'never', 'actually', 'seemed', 'fix', 'anything', 'least', 'early', 'montage', 'problems', 'see', 'being', 'presented', 'establish', 'role', 'nothing', 'helpful', 'clever', 'example', 'called', 'home', 'one', 'firm', 'long-time', 'clients', 'help', 'client', 'possible', 'hit-and-run', 'charge', 'When', 'Coonley', 'tell', 'client', ""'ll"", 'refer', 'criminal', 'attorney', 'client', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'viewer', 'rightfully', 'indignant', 'lack', 'legerdemain', 'Then', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'material', 'see', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'final', 'film', 'Clooney', 'former', 'mate', 'made', 'problem', 'disappear', 'When', 'How', 'wink.This', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'stem', 'certain', 'amount', 'lazy', 'script-writing', 'related', 'genre', 'heist', 'films', 'such', 'Clooney', 'Ocean', '11', 'expect', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'clever', 'filching', 'technique', 'demonstrated', 'way.In', 'general', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'towards', 'getting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Other', 'problems', 'writing', 'include', 'use', 'coincidence', 'use', 'clich', 'eacute', 'once', 'again', 'Big', 'Corporation', 'fictional', 'Silkwood', 'foe', 'diabolical', 'ubiquitous', 'evil', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'performance', 'loony', 'still', 'brilliant', 'lawyer', 'truly', 'memorable', 'whole', 'movie', 'sort', 'improbable', 'forgettable', 'plot']",N/A

(Ha ha.)  He's an admittedly unusual attorney, a ""fixer"" for a top New York firm. On the firm's website, he's special counsel for trusts and estates.  In reality, he's the guy a congressman calls when his daughter gets busted with cocaine or a rich executive is guilty of a hit-and-run.Deep in debt, struggling with a broken family, Clayton gets thrown into the mix of his firm's soulless representation of a soulless megacorporation that has poisoned hundreds of innocent civilians with its chemical products.

1134259,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00121QGPY,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[102, 119]","George Clooney once again shows us the Hollywood powerhouse he is as lead actor and producer of this engaging film.While the film is essentially well-written and extremely well-acted, it offers nothing new to the corporate thriller genre and most of Amazon's comments in their review are dead on accurate.  The film is essentially a mystery that involves corporate baddies trying to screw over the little guy by covering up a danger to the public.  We've seen this plot before in film's likeErin Brockovich.  In addition, we have a conscience driven lawyer who is tired of defending criminals he knows are guilty and another lawyer who is burnt out from playing the firm's ""Janitor"" and now wants to find some moral ground to land upon.  Both lawyers are seeking some kind of redemption.  The first has a nervous breakdown finding it and the second is forced to find it as his life spirals out of control.  This is very much like Paul Newman's Oscar nominated role in the fabulous filmThe Verdict.The script is clever, but all too predictable by the final third of the film.  In fact, as generally satisfying as the finale is, it is something of a letdown too.  Things are wrapped up far too neatly for what was a complex film with deep round central characters.  Clooney's character has his nature revealed to us slowly as if peeling a rotten onion.  Each layer is ultimately unsatisfying until we get to the core which seems damaged, but salvageable.  I certainly expect another Oscar nomination for him and it's well-earned here.  Tom Wilkinson as the manic depressive attorney who has an epiphany that his corporate clients should not get away with what they are doing is a bit over-the-top and even stereotypical, but still convincing in the end.  A supporting Oscar nod is not out of the question, but I think he would be undeserving of it.  Contrary to a majority of the reviews here, even Tilda (The Chronicles of Narnia) Swinton's controlling corporate bigwig who lies to herself to justify her actions is a deeper character than most give credit for her being.  Her avoidance of actually saying, ""Kill (fill in the blank)"" coupled with her sweating fit scene clearly demonstrates a believably conflicted individual. I would not be surprised to see an Oscar nod for supporting actress come her way.  Even Sydney Pollack, sometimes director (but better actor), is very convincing here and he also serves as co-producer with Clooney.  These generally terrific performances nearly make up for a somewhat flat ending.Credit must be given to first time director James Gilroy who adapted the ""Bourne"" books to film and wrote the screenplay for this film.

Journey is more important than arrival,in a subtle screenplay littered with symbols like Henry's book,Realm and Conquest and three horses on a hill. The picture of the horse appears on a page of the book that Michael Clayton(Clooney) views in Arthur's loft,3 scenes before he stops his car and walks up to the horses with a look of recognition,when he realizes his lot belongs with Arthur not the firm.His car explodes below and an extended flashback takes us back 4 days in time.A mesmerising opening.Michael Clayton is the ""fixer""(janitor not miracle worker),the go-to guy when his powerful New York law firm wants a mess swept under the rug.He's burdened with problems of his own(broken marriage,debts from a failed restaurant incurred by his alcoholic brother,gambling) is charged with bringing the firm's top litigator,Arthur, home from Milwaukee and back on his medication,away from whistle-blowing madness.He's also got to pay off $80,000 to dubious loansharks.However there is no drug for moral imbalance,only damage limitation,when forces put corporate survival over human life.Similar in theme to A Civil Action or the films of Pollack and Lumet in the 70s.Tilda Swinton(Karen Crowder),chief counsel for agro-chemical giant,U/North is bereft of inner life or conscience.

And with as hard-hitting and satisfyingly clever an ending as the one that closes Michael Clayton, even earlier faults within the film can quickly become erased from our minds. While the climactic payoff gives the audience everything they've been waiting so patiently for, it's still a shame that the film takes its time to examine too many characters and their involvement in Clayton's seemingly undefined and shady responsibilities.Father. Brother. Gambler. Legal advisor. Law firm ""Fixer"" and ""Bagman"". Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is all of these and more. Leading a troubled and infinitely complex lifestyle of fixing problems, Clayton becomes embroiled in a multi-million dollar law suit to cover up damaging evidence against U-North, a powerful corporation. His main opponent is a man on his side, a lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) who has suddenly seen the errors of working with corruption and greed. Added to the mix is U-North litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) whose success relies on Clayton's failure. As the stakes become higher and the loose ends more dangerous, Clayton must choose a side and attempt to defy those with the power to alter the truth.Michael Clayton takes the increasingly familiar narration of starting almost at the end, backtracking to the beginning, going forward to the starting point, and then finishing from there. It may sound complex, but it's deceptively simple. The problem is that early on the audience is shown the outcome of Clayton's suspenseful car ride, which causes the nonlinear storyline to be completely unnecessary. Other films utilize this chopped up narrative by withholding dramatic truths until the end. But Michael Clayton shows the viewer every secret up front, numbing any suspense being formed from the added details as the film catches back up to itself.The structuring of the film is occasionally tiresome and many of the events are underdeveloped. Add to that the unusually high amount of characters all with several lines of dialogue and what could have been a fast-paced thriller leans more to the side of ploddingly amusing. So many characters and not enough time spent with each means that several sequences and worthlessly complex events could easily have been cut or trimmed. Fortunately Clooney's Clayton is so engrossing that the audience never tires of his formulaic pondering or his generic family life. What does work surprisingly well is the constantly intense score that permeates every minute element to increase its impact on the film, and George Clooney's flawless performance as the intriguing title character.The genre that Michael Clayton falls into is a tired one, but director Tony Gilroy manages to give us something that never gets boring - Clooney at his brooding best and a solid drama with an ending as explosive as its beginning. Though its faults may be numerous when examined closely, the entertainment value remains high with exceptionally powerful performances, sharp dialogue, and a methodic build to a sensational finish. While keeping track of all the characters involved may be rather dizzying, there's no forgetting Michael Clayton.- The Massie Twins",4,Michael Clayton Movie Review,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3241,"['world', 'big', 'money', 'big', 'businesses', 'big', 'law', 'firms', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'covered', 'up', 'hard-hitting', 'satisfyingly', 'clever', 'ending', 'one', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'even', 'earlier', 'faults', 'film', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'erased', 'minds', 'climactic', 'payoff', 'audience', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'so', 'patiently', 'still', 'shame', 'film', 'time', 'examine', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'involvement', 'Clayton', 'seemingly', 'undefined', 'shady', 'responsibilities.Father', 'Brother', 'Gambler', 'Legal', 'advisor', 'Law', 'firm', 'Fixer', 'Bagman', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'more', 'Leading', 'troubled', 'infinitely', 'complex', 'lifestyle', 'fixing', 'problems', 'Clayton', 'embroiled', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'law', 'suit', 'cover', 'up', 'damaging', 'evidence', 'U-North', 'powerful', 'corporation', 'main', 'opponent', 'man', 'side', 'lawyer', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'suddenly', 'seen', 'errors', 'working', 'corruption', 'greed', 'Added', 'mix', 'U-North', 'litigator', 'Karen', 'Crowder', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'success', 'Clayton', 'failure', 'stakes', 'become', 'higher', 'loose', 'ends', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Clayton', 'must', 'choose', 'side', 'attempt', 'defy', 'power', 'alter', 'truth.Michael', 'Clayton', 'increasingly', 'familiar', 'narration', 'starting', 'almost', 'end', 'backtracking', 'beginning', 'going', 'forward', 'starting', 'point', 'then', 'finishing', 'there', 'may', 'sound', 'complex', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'problem', 'early', 'audience', 'shown', 'outcome', 'Clayton', 'suspenseful', 'car', 'ride', 'nonlinear', 'storyline', 'be', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'Other', 'films', 'utilize', 'chopped', 'up', 'narrative', 'withholding', 'dramatic', 'truths', 'end', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'viewer', 'secret', 'up', 'front', 'numbing', 'suspense', 'being', 'formed', 'added', 'details', 'film', 'catches', 'back', 'itself.The', 'structuring', 'film', 'occasionally', 'tiresome', 'many', 'events', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'Add', 'unusually', 'high', 'amount', 'characters', 'several', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'more', 'side', 'ploddingly', 'amusing', 'So', 'many', 'characters', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'spent', 'means', 'several', 'sequences', 'worthlessly', 'complex', 'events', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'trimmed', 'Fortunately', 'Clooney', 'Clayton', 'so', 'engrossing', 'audience', 'never', 'formulaic', 'pondering', 'generic', 'family', 'life', 'What', 'work', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'constantly', 'intense', 'score', 'minute', 'element', 'increase', 'impact', 'film', 'George', 'Clooney', 'flawless', 'performance', 'intriguing', 'title', 'character.The', 'genre', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'tired', 'one', 'director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'give', 'something', 'never', 'boring', 'Clooney', 'brooding', 'best', 'solid', 'drama', 'ending', 'as', 'explosive', 'beginning', 'faults', 'may', 'be', 'numerous', 'when', 'examined', 'closely', 'entertainment', 'value', 'high', 'exceptionally', 'powerful', 'performances', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'methodic', 'build', 'sensational', 'finish', 'keeping', 'track', 'characters', 'involved', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'dizzying', 'forgetting', 'Michael', 'Clayton.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
1134266,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00121QGPY,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","George Clooney is a genuine movie star.  He commands the screen, he attracts audiences, he chooses his film projects carefully, and he is incredibly good-looking.  When you toss in the fact that he's a fine actor, the combination of talent, looks, and charisma become a powerful force.Nowhere is this more in evidence than in his new film, ""Michael Clayton,"" a movie that is so well conceived and so well acted that it practically jumps off the screen.  Few movies achieve this level of craftsmanship.  The script is truly a finished product rather than a draft that should have gone back for rewrites.Michael Clayton (Clooney) is a lawyer at Kenner-Bach, one of New York's largest and most prestigious law firms.  But he doesn't litigate or engage in other traditional lawyer activities.  He is too valuable as a ""fixer,"" a role Clayton has been assigned by the  firm's co-founder, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack).  Clayton is the go-to guy when embarrassing incidents involving staff members have to be covered up, bribes and payoffs must be made, or anything involving corporate profits pops up.  The divorced, burned-out Clayton is unhappy with his job, has a failed side business, and has built up a huge gambling debt.  Financially crippled, he can't walk away from a job he's come to hate.At the U/North corporation, the career of litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) relies on the multi-million dollar settlement of a class action suit being handled by Clayton's firm.  All appears to be moving to a successful conclusion until Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), Kenner-Bach's star attorney, sabotages the case.  Clayton is called in to bring the erratic Edens under control before the entire case is irrevocably undermined.Wilkinson has a field day as Edens.  Whether he's having a tantrum in a board room, striding down the street with a dozen loaves of Italian bread under his arm, or explaining to Clayton in legalese why it would be nearly impossible to have him committed to a mental institution, he simultaneously conveys exasperation, guilt, cunning, and authority.  Wilkinson's precisely modulated performance is one of the movie's joys.Writer/director Tony Gilroy has done a masterful job at centering Clooney in an intriguing tale of morally crippled corporate cutthroat politics while anchoring us to the personal story of Clayton as he first coolly observes the mess created by an apparent nervous breakdown of his firm's top lawyer, but ultimately sees the man's actions as entirely clearheaded and sound.  We get to see Clayton change from a disgruntled, though highly efficient, guy who does the dirty work to a man with a conscience.  Never preachy, always riveting, the script explores all facets of Clayton's life, explaining how his weakness for gambling and his desire to create financial security for himself have left him at a depressing low.  Clooney keeps us in his corner, even though his Clayton is no traditional hero.Swinton is excellent as attorney Crowder, whose future rests on her success on the case.  Director Gilroy shows us her at home, facing the mirror, rehearsing not only the precise wording of her presentations, but their cadence as well.  She won't leave any detail to chance.  Swinton, seen previously as the White Witch in ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" is letter-perfect as an icy professional who will employ all resources to win.  We never see her in private life, except for those moments in front of the mirror.  Her life is work, and excelling is her agenda.  Little else matters.Sydney Pollack is also perfect as Marty Bach.  A friend to Clayton, he also knows how to tighten the screws, and he does this not with histrionics, but with soft-spoken, carefully chosen words.  This is a man who doesn't have to shout.  He's used to wielding power, and understands people often better than they do themselves.  Marty never panics when things get sticky for the firm.  He knows how to make bad things disappear, and Michael Clayton is the means.  Pollack has a completely natural delivery, which comes with his years as feature film director working with such stars as Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Al Pacino, and Tom Cruise, among others.  He is immediately believable, particularly as a powerful man.  The role of Marty Bach fits him well.The film is a bit slow early on, where John Gilroy's editing could be tighter.  Overall, however, ""Michael Clayton"" is engaging and quite a ride.  It allows the viewer to eavesdrop on the inner workings of a big-money company, showing that a company with warts has on staff a guy who can surgically remove them before they fester.Rated R, ""Michael Clayton"" is top-form movie making.  Clooney is at his best -- perhaps his best screen work ever -- and the excellent supporting cast and clever, literate, script add up to two hours of solid entertainment.",5,Corporate Fixer Discovers

When I asked why she stated, ""Because the role is very similar to the character he played in ""Syriana"". She has a point, but my argument is that in ""Syriana"", his character was one of many. In ""Michael Clayton"", he is the center of the film and it is very much the leading performance. The role and the film have Oscar stamped all over them.Michael Clayton (Clooney) is THE troubleshooter at a large law firm in New York. He facilitates everything the firm's clients need, to make sure they remain happy customers, willing to pay huge retainers. But he doesn't practice law anymore and this is beginning to wear him down. When the bar he has invested his life savings in closes and he still owes the backers $75,000, he realizes he shouldn't have placed so much confidence in his younger brother, the manager of the establishment. As he deals with his financial problems, Arthur (Tom Wilkinson), the lead attorney on the firm's biggest case, representing a chemical company called U-North, goes a little crazy. Michael is called in to bail Arthur out and to placate the clients. But Arthur insists the case is faulty and U-North is really guilty. And he won't shut up about it. When the lead counsel for the large company, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) gets wind of this, she realizes her position and the company's impending settlement may be in jeopardy, so she decides to take action. As Michael gets more involved with Arthur's problems and the U-North case, his boss (Sydney Pollack) has to deal with a merger to a British law firm. Everything each of these people is doing or working on is part of an elaborate dominoes puzzle; if one piece falls, every other piece will follow. And everyone will do everything in their power to make sure a single piece doesn't cause a chain reaction.Tony Gilroy, the writer of the ""Bourne"" films, makes his directorial debut with ""Michael Clayton"". The film has a lot of story threads enmeshed throughout the film; it takes a while to get these going, but once Gilroy does, we realize the wait has been worth it. Because he takes such great pains to set-up each of these story threads, making each believable and interesting, when we realize they are all part of the larger story, it makes the final film very engrossing and even a little thrilling.""Clayton"" is the type of film that shows extraneous bits of each character's lives. Initially, as we watch these moments play out, they help to provide interesting details about the character's lives, but they don't really seem to have a lot of connection to the story. Then, as the story progresses, these moments become related, in a superfluous way, helping to make us more interested in the characters. For instance, we first see Michael Clayton at an auction. We quickly get the idea they are selling off the various supplies in the restaurant, trying to make money, to repay the debt for the now closed restaurant and bar. We soon learn Michael was the main backer for the restaurant and its closure has left him deeply in debt. We also learn his brother was the manager behind the failed enterprise. All of these various elements help to color every action Michael makes through the remainder of the film. I really enjoy this type of exposition, because it makes the characters seem richer and more interesting. When I see this type of thing happening, successfully, it also raises my hopes for the film in general.It is also refreshing to watch Gilroy's work as a director. Much like his writing, he is clearly going for something different. In the ""Bourne"" films, the writer gave us a lot of detail about the characters while orchestrating Bourne's fight for the truth about who he actually is. Interestingly, the films share only the most basic premise with the books. In ""Clayton', the writer and director achieves the same effect in a more subdued film. Michael is in danger throughout the film, but he isn't a spy with amnesia, he is a lawyer, living in New York, dealing with a lot of problems. They are very different characters but created in a similar fashion.As Gilroy introduces the various threads of the story, he makes us wait until he is ready to show us how they all fit together. This may be maddening for some, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Real life doesn't lay out all the details in a set fashion. Real life is messy and ""Clayton""'s story reflects this.All of the performances throughout the film are outstanding.Clooney's character is similar to the role he played in ""Syriana"" in that both men are reluctant heroes who are out to discover the truth. But in ""Syriana"", Clooney's role was one of many characters with similar goals. It is a good performance, worthy of the attention it received, but it is a Supporting Performance. Because Michael Clayton is at the center of the new film, Clooney has more screen time, allowing him to develop the character more fully.  We can see Michael's frustration with his current position in society because he has a lot to be frustrated about; broke, deceived by a family member and unhappy with his job; he is desperate to make a change. His job allows that, because he is a Fixer, someone who makes things happen. Having done this job for so long, he has contacts and his character is slightly tarnished. He isn't above doing something slightly illegal if he believes he won't be caught.So when he starts to deal with the problem named Arthur, he seems slightly surprised to find himself investigating the same leads his friend did. Why is he trying to prove U-North is guilty? They are the firm's biggest clients. If they lose money, the firm loses a big client, a client it would be difficult to replace with the history of this loss following them. He has brief moments when he realizes what he is doing and they shock him, he isn't normally this person. Where did this person come from?But he soon realizes this large company made many, many people sick and they shouldn't get away with it. That is what spurs him into action. Arthur was right.Tom Wilkinson does a great job with the role of Arthur. This is the type of role that could so easily become a hammy showcase for an actor's bravura skill, but Wilkinson makes the character believable by making him more restrained, giving him moments of clarity, allowing him to think ahead of all of the other people in the story.We first see Arthur in a Minneapolis jail. U-North is based in this city and Arthur snapped during the deposition, ripping his clothes off, while the video camera is rolling. Naturally, as lead counsel, U-North is very nervous about their case, which is why Michael is sent in, to smooth things over. Initially, Arthur just appears crazy, as though someone who has spent 10% of his or her life defending someone who is guilty, really guilty, would feel. But as Arthur talks, and he talks a lot, some of the things he says start to click in Michael's thoughts.Throughout, we see glimpses of the lawyer Arthur used to be. Arthur tells the people at U-North he has a document that will all but win the case for the plaintiffs. He goes so far as to read it on the phone, when he realizes he is being bugged. These moments, juxtaposed with the ""crazy"" moments- after being out of touch for a while, Michael spots Arthur walking back to his loft carrying a bag filled with over a dozen fresh baked baguettes, helping Wilkinson create a character who is almost mesmerizing to watch. We rarely see someone like this in a film and Wilkinson's performance makes the character all the more unusual and interesting.Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder, Chief Counsel for U-North, is the villain of the story. Even though all of the characters have definite shades of gray, she is the force behind all of the bad things happening throughout the story. Much like Wilkinson's character, she brings different layers to the role, making her more than simply a villain. If she were just the villain, she would be fun to watch, but because she has these extra elements to her character, she is even a little sympathetic.Karen is the Chief Counsel for this large company. She has nothing else, no husband, no children; every waking moment is about protecting this company that has given her the keys to the kingdom. Her boss, played by Ken Howard, has trusted her with this position, a powerful role in a large company generating billions every year, and she must do her best to reward his trust. As a woman, she feels she has to show everyone she is in contact with how powerful she is and prove it on a constant basis. The company used to be run by men, so she has to blend in. She likes the power and wants to maintain it, so she goes to great lengths to paint a portrait of power and determination.All of this is great, and helps to make Karen a forceful personality in the film. But as we get more and more glimpses of this character, we realize she is very unsure, very afraid of losing her job, her power, and her image. Early on, we see this woman, this definition of successful businessperson, in her hotel room airing out her extremely sweaty armpits, trying to dry them out before a big presentation. This woman in nervous. Why is she so nervous? Is she nervous about her abilities? There are other moments revealing the vulnerabilities of this character, showing us this woman who is so determined to appear powerful is really very scared. As we learn more about both sides of this character, we see she is at conflict with her self and she becomes even more interesting.Sydney Pollack, who also serves as one of the film's producers, plays Michael's boss. It is the least interesting of the four roles, but it serves it's purpose. His character is the head of an extremely large law firm, working a very large case, who must juggle many different responsibilities, keeping all of the balls moving.""Michael Clayton"" is part espionage thriller, part human drama, part ""Erin Brockovich"". But it works on all three counts. There is a particularly memorable scene in which one of the threats to the case is dispatched in an efficient manner unlike anything I have ever seen in a film. Each of the characters has strains on their life outside of the job, adding to their development, making them seem more human, more vulnerable. And the case at the center of the film, while fictionalized, is no doubt based on an actual incident, giving Michael Clayton many of the same aspects as Julia Robert's Oscar winning character.""Michael Clayton"" is a very good film, on all counts.",4,"Clooney's ""Michael"" is stamped with Oscar Gold",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,10627,"['exited', 'theater', 'friend', 'said',

1134268,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00121QGPY,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","Continuing to up his personal ante as a dramatic actor since winning the Oscar forSyriana, George Clooney delivers his latest excellent performance in ""Michael Clayton."" Clooney plays a bagman in a prestigious law firm, where his duty is to be 'the janitor.' His job is to head for whatever client is in the worst mess and to clean it up with the least amount of residual damage. It's sleazy and he knows it, but he knows he's good at it.But he starts to feel the tug of his moral compass when his best friend (Oscar nominated Tom Wilkinson) has a nervous breakdown while defending a chemical company. Seems he's discovered that U-North is guilty as they get and wants to save the family of the young lady he is supposed to be thwarting. The firm sends in Clayton to rescue the case from impending disaster...but soon he finds himself in the middle of more than he bargained for.

He didn't let me down.As I've been criticized for it, I don't want to give away too much. Clooney plays Clayton, an attorney who serves as a ""janitor"" for a top-dollar NY law firm. The firm has a chemical company among its clients who has been under scrutiny after some of the company's clients died; did they do it?Wilkinson--or Arthur--another of the firm's lawyers who's also, incidentally, manic depressive thinks so.Hmmm. Back to not giving away too much...The film had me on the edge of my seat. I kept wondering what would happen next. The guys who were essentially hit men for the law firm had me going: I'd have loved to see them publicly executed. That's the degree the film evoked extreme emotions.Clayton had his own weaknesses, especially gambling, while his brother was a recovering alcoholic. I mention that only because the characters were, alas, human.  But important was that the focus of the film was NOT on the corporation the firm represented but on the firm itself. Sydney Pollack played I believe the senior partner in the firm. Clayton confronted him at one point and Pollack reminded him that somebody needs to ""pay the rent"" there! So, reality or truth notwithstanding, they'll represent who they need to.An overzealous firm vice president became...overzealous and there were no holds barred. That's as much as I'll give away.Another reviewer commented that there were a number of logical fallacies in the way the story was put together. While I don't necessarily disagree with that, I'll attribute it to ""license of the medium."" Indeed, the way the time sequence of the film was set up, that's one of the things that kept me on the edge of my seat!My biggest objection is that I don't think a law firm like that would ultimately lose. They have ""over 600"" lawyers on their staff many of whom would be able to get them off the hook, perhaps passing the responsibility onto the corporation. I'm not defending the corporate lack of conscience by any stretch. But I just don't believe a big buck law firm would get caught.There was a little of ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""The Razor's Edge"" in it, in that at the end you're not sure what would happen to Clayton, except that he probably wouldn't be living as high as he was while an attorney in that firm. But the chance of catching a firm like that with its collective pants down I think is a fairy tale.If that's cynical, so be it.

Boring. Horrific Editing. Predictable. Boring. Stereotypical. Boring. One-dimensional characters.Oh, and it's boring.WARNING: SPOILERS!Horrible editing. I've seen better edited movies on Youtube.Apparently, huge chunks of the movie vital to the plot were mistakenly left on the floor of the editing room. WHY did Michael Clayton get out of his car to go look at some horses? Why?!? This pivotal point in the movie made absolutely no sense. It was certainly not in-line with his character, who should have asked, ""Horses? What horses?"" as he drove by at high speeds in his Mercedes Benz.That scene made absolutely no sense.Another annoying editing process was that people would just randomly pop up in this movie. I have some experience in forensics/legal world (I've been an expert witness on several occasions), and I was hard pressed to know either: (1) who these people in the room were; or (2) what was going on. My wife (who has no legal experience, but loves legal thrillers in both book and movie formats) was completely lost at times.And what about the subplot with Clayton's son and his fantasy book? That thread at least looked like it had some promise, but again, the editing dropped that subplot like a ton of bricks (Yeah, there was a highlighted book in Arthur's apartment, but SO much more could have been done with that book ...)As for the actors/actresses ...George Clooney continues to play George Clooney. The child actor who played his son acted circles around him. Clooney's character is a vile person who has little to no ability to relate emotionally to his son (notice he never actually touches his son except in one scene ... to basically push him out of some relatives' house). I had little sympathy for Michael Clayton by movie's end.Tom Wilkinson (who I think is a wonderful actor ... very under-rated) did the best he could with the garbage script he was given. As a mental health professional, it continues to gall me that mental illness is continued to be portrayed in such a medieval mindset.Tilda Swinton's role wasted a very good actress. Her character made no sense, unless the script-writer was trying to portray a schizophrenic barracuda with anxiety issues. She is ""hard"" enough to order two assisinations, but then falls to pieces when confronted by Michael at the end. Her character was a throwback to sexist portrayals of women from the 40's and 50's ... only done with less aestheic appeal.I could keep writing my objections, but I've wasted enough time with this junk.Do yourself a favor.

It is a true masterpiece that elevates itself from the common lawyer/thriller genre into a classic.George Clooney plays Michael Clayton, a burned out lawyer working for a respected law firm. He does not have a glamorous job. He is in his own words ""a janitor"". He cleans up messes of cases and runs around reassuring clients that their money has been spent wisely. He is also in debt, divorced, and has a gambling addiction. Michael is assigned to fix the situation of a defense lawyer, Arthur Eden (played by Tom Wilkinson), he knows, is arrested for streaking. Arthur has been working six years on a defense for a multi-billion dollar corporation, uNorth. One of Michael's duties include controlling the manic depressant Arthur as well as reassuring a uNorth corporate employee that everything is under control and that uNorth's $9 million worth of legal fees will not go to waste. Michael attempts to reason with Arthur to finish working on the defense, despite Arthur's protests regarding evidence that uNorth's products have and are killing people.One thing, among many, that make this film so good is that it does not rely on conventional thrills with car chases, shootouts, or dramatic courtroom showdowns; but has it's own unique atmospheric intensity to it that pulls you in from the opening sequence.The cast is a major driving force of the film. Every character is so well casted and acted. George Clooney delivers another powerful performance, Tom Wilkinson plays the manic depressant with a passionate vigor, and Tilda Swinton gives an astonishing performance as the corporate member dealing with insecurities but desperately trying to hide and control them.The entire production of the film is so well done.

He is facing a crisis in life, reaching 45 and heavily in debt; he doesn't like his clients, he doesn't like his jobs, and he knows he hasn't achieved anything in his life. And he must choose what he should do before the film ends, but can he really do the right thing?Directed by Tony Gilroy (his debut film) known as writer for the ""Jason Bourne"" trilogy, ""Michael Clayton"" builds up its story very slowly in the first half and you need to be patient at times as if to pick up and put together pieces of a puzzle. I said it is a thriller, but not in the way as three action-packed Bourne films. It also deals with a similar topic as ""Erin Brockovich,"" but you can see the truths from the beginning.The thrills of ""Michael Clayton"" come from the round characters and their moral conflicts - Clooney's Clayton, Tilda Swinton's chief counsel for a big company ""U/North"" and Tom Wilkinson's brilliant, but now mentally unstable lawyer whose long monologue in the opening sets the tone of the film. Their acting is all wonderful, worthy of Oscar nomination and winning.You will find ""Michael Clayton"" has several things that can be seen in other legal thrillers, but they are not used in a clich&eacute;d way. After all the film's tense atmosphere comes from the inner conflicts of the characters, both ""good"" and ""bad"" ones, who must do what they really don't want to do.

While the surround tracks are used with subtly adding ambience and an occasional kick when there is an explosion or a brief bit of action.The extras are a bit thin. Director/writer Gilroy and his brother editor John Gilroy provide an interesting commentary track covering everything from the inspiration for various characters to the choice to use deliberate pacing (reminiscent of Lumet's dramas) vs. a rapid cutting style and how the film builds tension by staying WITH the performers vs. cutting away.We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Gilroys that features an entire subplot revealing the casual relationship between Clayton and one of the firm's other lawyers.

Prior to the last 15 minutes, this movie was a thrill ride.  I won't dive into the plot, since that is probably better outlined in other reviews.George Clooney certainly does nothing to disappoint and is at the peak of his game.  He definitely looks the part of a high-priced NY lawyer, but his performance goes well beyond his appearance.  Tom Wilkinson is exceptional as the senior litigator in the firm whose discovery of key evidence implicating his client brings his mental illness to the fore.  Wilkinson comes close to being over the top portraying the mentally unstable attorney, but manages to never cross the line.  I also disagree with the negative comments about Tilda Swinton.  Her performance as the conflicted General Counsel of the chemical company, U North, is more complex than others give her credit for and she does happen to deliver a stirring performance in the movie's climactic scenes.Overall, ""Michael Clayton"" could have been a classic.

One of this messes involves getting his respected, but manic depressive colleague, Arthur Edens [a very credible Tom Wilkinson]back on track after the latter is charged for indecent exposure whilst at a deposition involving a chemical company.Arhtur's character is quite complex - he decides that his conscience will not allow him to represent the chemical company anymore, and turns out he has been working against the very people he is supposed to represent. Michael's firm is not the only one who wants Arthur under control. Tilda Swinton plays a highly ambitious Karen Crowder, lead counsel at UNorth , the chemical company being represented by Michael's law firm and is utterly ruthless when it comes to protecting her position at the comapny. Her character is played almost flawlessly by Swinton-her  nervous gestures,her obsessive compulsiveness, the conflict between doing what is ethical and what is right for her, all of these are portrayed in a very credible manner.The story really gets off the ground after a main character dies, and the action starts to pick up pace, leaving viewers wondering how everything is going to be set right, if ever.The plot is quite convoluted, but well-written so that viewers are able to follow the disjointed storyline.
