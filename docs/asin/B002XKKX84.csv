The double pack was even cheaper than the 2 parts sold separately.  I would recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Vegas.,5,Happy Vegas is back!,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,240,"['am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'box', 'set', 'Vegas', '1st', 'Season', 'arrived', 'time', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'double', 'pack', 'was', 'even', 'cheaper', '2', 'parts', 'sold', 'separately', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'Vegas']",N/A

I loved the show when it was on TV and I have waited patiently for it to come out on DVD, but this piece meal BS is just too much. Just release the whole thing at once and be done with it. It is not like you have to wait for them to complete the episodes or something. *headdesk*",3,Love the show but why not just release all of it at once,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,339,"['review', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'released', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'have', 'waited', 'patiently', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'piece', 'meal', 'BS', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Just', 'release', 'whole', 'thing', 'once', 'be', 'done', 'not', 'have', 'wait', 'complete', 'episodes', 'something', '*headdesk*']",N/A

This show not only had good writing, it also captured the flash & exitement of Las Vegas.  I also like the humorous characters who guest-starred in several episodes.  Besides....who wouldn't want to park their vintage T-Bird convertible inside their house & just hop out without opening the door?
