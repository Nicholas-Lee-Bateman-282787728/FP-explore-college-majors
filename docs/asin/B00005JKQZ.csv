590391,AVT2CST57MKDL,B00005JKQZ,Abby,"[0, 0]","Oh my goodness! A lovely movie right from the very beginning! The amazing soundtrack to the film seems to suck you straight into the plot, which begins with young Mathematician John Nash (Russel Crowe)on his first day at Princeton University. Everything starts when he meets his room mate. This is strange because Nash specifically said that he didn't want one. However, that turns out to be no matter because Nash and his roomie (Paul Bettany, who does a great job, only wish there could have been more of him) get on very well.Nash saves his spiraling Princeton career with a mathematical theory which he applies to picking up girls in the bar with his friends. As a result, he is secured a job at a government office along with two of his pals from college.While at a class that he is unwillingly teaching, Nash meets his future wife. (Jennifer Connelly, who'd only been mostly popping up in supporting roles until this film)Everything seems perfect until a zealous, and perhaps crazy, government worker gives him an undercover job breaking ""Soviet Codes"". Here you begin to wonder. Can we trust that all of this is real? It turns out that we cannot. Nash has an incident giving a lecture, and his wife commits him to a mental hospital, where he is diagnosed with schizophrenia. The rest of the film chronicles how Nash overcomes his problem and goes on to win the Nobel Prize.About the only complaint that I have about this movie is Crowe's West Virginia accent that he dons when playing Nash. There are several points during the film where the lines are garbled just a tad, and makes it hard to understand. The other thing that I have is that when the older Alicia is shown, well, she doesn't look like an older version of her character. She looks...like Jennifer Connely with Gray hair. A bit of a dissapointment, considering that the rest of the makeup in the film is wonderfully done. But, other than that, this film is great. It is beautiful, it is amazing, and, most importantly, it is interesting.

590393,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B00005JKQZ,absent_minded_prof,"[4, 5]","In this interesting, entertaining film, director Ron Howard has assembled an all star cast to tell the tragic story of Princeton mathematician John Nash.  Russell Crowe's Nash is a quirky, mathematical genius, complete with the touchy sense of forlorn pride that comes with doing only one thing extremely well.  He sees arcane patterns everwhere, all the time, like a chess grandmaster who has come to inadvertently inhabit his chessboard.  His life is an intellectually exciting one... but how much of it is actually real?  He cannot tell.  Can you?This movie really needs to be seen twice, or more.  There's no way you'll appreciate everything the first time around.  The character's &quot;journey,&quot; for which Ron Howard and Russell Crowe seem to have been shooting, is Nash's growth, both because of and despite his schizophrenia, from an arrogant, cold &quot;genius&quot; to a warmer, less standoffish human being.  It is interesting to see his receptivity to the people around him increase, even as his attention to his inner hallucinations decreases.  The inverse relationship between these qualities is somehing to behold, and to ponder.I would like to take this opportunity to call your attention to an interesting casting decision.  Did you happen to experience a mild sense of deja vu, when watching Nash's lab assistants work together at MIT's Wheeler labs?  Or when we first meet them, in the film's opening scenes?  If you happened to catch &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; back in 1993, that explains the feeling.  The characters Bender and Sol are played by Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg, who played a very similar couple of buddies in &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot;  There, they were Tony and Mike, &quot;the smart kids&quot; in their wild Texas high school.  Here again, together they portray an unusually intelligent pair, coping with varying success with the mundane world.  Just an interesting thing to note....  Other more-or-less background characters look like they had a lot of fun playing their parts, as well, especially Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.A problem I have is the way that &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; glosses quickly over some things, to make a person's life into fit material for a 90 minute film.  Think about it.  The happy times that John Nash enjoyed with his wife Alicia (fantastically played by the brilliant/babe-acious Jennifer Connelly) seem to amount to a few months, tops.  It appears that virtually their entire life together, from their early 20s to their late 60s, were almost constantly miserable.  Somehow the film makes you fel that there is a grand human triumph in here somewhere, but I'm not sure I agree.  Nash's is certainly a fascinating life story, but the film ranks a little too high on the well-known &quot;S.S.I.&quot; -- the Schmidt Schmaltz Index.I have nothing but respect for Ron Howard, who is plainly a good man, a good guy, and an EXCELLENT director.  Therefore, I imagine that he probably felt it was worth telling this story in a somewhat overly &quot;Hollywood&quot; fashion, in order to draw all the more attention to the important topics dealt with herein.  Nevertheless, I just want to note that this movie is pretty simplistic in certain ways, and achieves its emotional punch at a certain cost in terms of its faith to the real story.  If you want a more complete version of this story, try Sylvia Nasar's book version, also entitled &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  If you don't want to concern yourself too much with reality, but just love this kind of story, I'd like to recommend that you read Daniel Keyes' &quot;Flowers for Algernon.&quot;",4,"Engrossing, but.... realistic???",1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,3628,"['interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'assembled', 'star', 'cast', 'tell', 'tragic', 'story', 'Princeton', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'quirky', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'complete', 'touchy', 'sense', 'forlorn', 'pride', 'doing', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'extremely', 'well', 'arcane', 'patterns', 'everwhere', 'time', 'chess', 'grandmaster', 'who', 'come', 'inadvertently', 'inhabit', 'chessboard', 'life', 'intellectually', 'exciting', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'real', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'Can', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'seen', 'twice', 'more', 'way', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'everything', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'character', 'quot', 'journey', 'quot', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'shooting', 'Nash', 'growth', 'schizophrenia', 'arrogant', 'cold', 'quot', 'genius', 'quot', 'warmer', 'less', 'standoffish', 'human', 'being', 'interesting', 'see', 'receptivity', 'people', 'increase', 'even', 'attention', 'inner', 'hallucinations', 'decreases', 'inverse', 'relationship', 'qualities', 'somehing', 'behold', 'ponder.I', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'opportunity', 'call', 'attention', 'interesting', 'casting', 'decision', 'Did', 'happen', 'experience', 'mild', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'when', 'watching', 'Nash', 'lab', 'assistants', 'work', 'together', 'MIT', 'Wheeler', 'labs', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'happened', 'catch', 'quot', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'quot', 'back', '1993', 'feeling', 'characters', 'Bender', 'Sol', 'are', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'played', 'very', 'similar', 'couple', 'buddies', 'quot', 'Dazed', 'Confused.', 'quot', 'were', 'Tony', 'Mike', 'quot', 'smart', 'kids', 'quot', 'wild', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'Here', 'again', 'together', 'portray', 'unusually', 'intelligent', 'pair', 'coping', 'varying', 'success', 'mundane', 'world', 'Just', 'interesting', 'thing', 'note', 'Other', 'more-or-less', 'background', 'characters', 'look', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'playing', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Paul', 'Bettany.A', 'problem', 'have', 'way', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'glosses', 'quickly', 'things', 'make', 'person', 'life', 'fit', 'material', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'Think', 'happy', 'times', 'John', 'Nash', 'enjoyed', 'wife', 'Alicia', 'fantastically', 'played', 'brilliant/babe-acious', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'seem', 'amount', 'few', 'months', 'tops', 'virtually', 'entire', 'life', 'together', 'early', '20s', 'late', '60s', 'were', 'almost', 'constantly', 'miserable', 'Somehow', 'film', 'fel', 'grand', 'human', 'triumph', 'here', 'somewhere', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'Nash', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'life', 'story', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'high', 'well-known', 'quot', 'S.S.I.', 'quot', 'Schmidt', 'Schmaltz', 'Index.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'respect', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'who', 'plainly', 'good', 'man', 'good', 'guy', 'EXCELLENT', 'director', 'Therefore', 'imagine', 'probably', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'telling', 'story', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'fashion', 'order', 'draw', 'more', 'attention', 'important', 'topics', 'dealt', 'herein', 'Nevertheless', 'just', 'want', 'note', 'movie', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'certain', 'ways', 'emotional', 'punch', 'certain', 'cost', 'terms', 'faith', 'real', 'story', 'want', 'more', 'complete', 'version', 'story', 'try', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'book', 'version', 'also', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'concern', 'too', 'much', 'reality', 'just', 'love', 'kind', 'story', ""'d"", 'like', 'recommend', 'read', 'Daniel', 'Keyes', 'quot', 'Flowers', 'Algernon.', 'quot']",N/A

I also love how intelligent, handsome, and charming he is. This character suits him very well. I'm glad his wife stayed with him once she found out that he was schizophrenic. She was a great wife. The only things I don't like about this film is when he gets electrocuted by some people on a bed. I don't agree with that as a form of treatment and when the director said in the commentary that the scene where his wife saves their baby shows how ultimately violent schizophrenic people are.

Don't let anyone spoil the movie for you, or even give away a bit of the plot, especially if you don't know about John Nash.  I went into the theatre knowing only Nash's theories, and was enthralled by the plot which had so many turns I left the cinema questioning my OWN sanity.  A Beautiful Mind creates a delicate balance between biography, mathematics, sanity, insanity, comedy, drama, and a bit of love.  No element overshadows the others, and the mood can shift so swiftly from a moment of sheer hilarity to a heartstopping dramatic scene.  Don't expect a historically accurate biography, don't even expect a detailed look at Nash's life.  A number of facts in John Nash's life were intentionally altered for dramatic and commercial reasons.  However, Ron Howard's intent is to examine the triumph of man in overpowering his intense schizophrenia without the help of medications, leading to the recovery of life.Russell Crowe is a brilliant (if not at times bumbling) mathematician who can evoke tears and laughter in the same instant.  He has set a certain standard for portraying mental illnesses that I doubt any other actor in this century will live up to.  Equally as incredible is Paul Bettany (yes, last seen as a nude Geoffery Chaucer in A Knight's Tale) and his portrayal of Charles, one of the figments of Nash's schizophrenia, who reminded me of Charlie from Dead Poet's Society.

Anyone with a good taste and a brain would've known the moment they laid eyes on the movie that it was destined to end up on a pedestal.Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant real-life mathematician and Nobel Prize winner, now in his 70s, who's also a real-life schizophrenic. But when we first meet him as a Princeton graduate student, he's just another eccentric genius, a loner obsessed with finding a truly original idea. (He does; he writes a revolutionary paper on game theory.)Director Ron Howard, working from an inventive script by Akiva Goldsman that makes use in turn of Sylvia Nasar's biography, does a crucial, and crucially understated, job of establishing the physical reality of Nash's world -- the campus, his classmates, his high-spirited roommate (Paul Bettany) -- with such authority that we feel we can taste the chalk dust on the blackboard. (Cinematographer Roger Deakins' work is as integral here as it is to the telling of ''The Man Who Wasn't There.'')This tangibility is ''Beautiful Mind'''s beautiful achievement, the elegant solution to the problem of how to turn the biography of a man's head into an absorbing movie. And especially coming from Howard, a director renowned (and sometimes critically reprimanded) for pumping big gusts of inspirational wind through pictures from ''Cocoon'' to ''Apollo 13,'' this is news. Inspired, perhaps, by the existence of an actual, living Nash as well as by Crowe's superior bull-free talent, director and screenwriter have found a way to convey the sensation of schizophrenia from the inside out, not with a big raving and waving of hands but with a waiving of reality.To say more about how is unwise, but I do want to say that Crowe ages as Nash ages. The academic geek who did so poorly with girls meets the beautiful student who will become his wife (Jennifer Connelly) at about the same time he meets the compelling government agent (Ed Harris) who recruits the professor to break codes. It's only long after Nash's schizophrenic break -- after he has struggled with treatment that dulls his thoughts and deadens his marriage, and after he has struggled to live with his illness on his own terms -- that this ''Mind'' gets foggy with uplift too.Still, by then, the important movie work has been done: ''A Beautiful Mind'' has distinguished itself and enlightened its audience. No final speechifying and shots of Mrs. Nash's tear-glistened eyes can take away the remembered image of Crowe as a young Nash, solving equations on a windowpane, aflame with an inspiration very close to madness",5,Jackpot!,1029801600,"08 20, 2002",2002,2629,"['Well', 'maybe', 'oscar', 'dudes', 'have', 'SOME', 'taste', 'left', 'Anyone', 'good', 'taste', 'brain', 'would', ""'ve"", 'known', 'moment', 'laid', 'eyes', 'movie', 'was', 'destined', 'end', 'up', 'pedestal.Crowe', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'Jr.', 'brilliant', 'real-life', 'mathematician', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'now', '70s', 'who', 'also', 'real-life', 'schizophrenic', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'Princeton', 'graduate', 'student', 'just', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'loner', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'truly', 'original', 'idea', 'revolutionary', 'paper', 'game', 'theory', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'working', 'inventive', 'script', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'use', 'turn', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'biography', 'crucial', 'crucially', 'understated', 'job', 'establishing', 'physical', 'reality', 'Nash', 'world', 'campus', 'classmates', 'high-spirited', 'roommate', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'such', 'authority', 'feel', 'can', 'taste', 'chalk', 'dust', 'blackboard', 'Cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'work', 'integral', 'here', 'telling', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'tangibility', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'beautiful', 'achievement', 'elegant', 'solution', 'problem', 'how', 'turn', 'biography', 'man', 'head', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'especially', 'coming', 'Howard', 'director', 'renowned', 'sometimes', 'critically', 'reprimanded', 'pumping', 'big', 'gusts', 'inspirational', 'wind', 'pictures', 'Cocoon', 'Apollo', '13', 'news', 'Inspired', 'perhaps', 'existence', 'actual', 'living', 'Nash', 'as', 'well', 'Crowe', 'superior', 'bull-free', 'talent', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'convey', 'sensation', 'schizophrenia', 'inside', 'out', 'not', 'big', 'raving', 'waving', 'hands', 'waiving', 'reality.To', 'say', 'more', 'how', 'unwise', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'ages', 'academic', 'geek', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'girls', 'meets', 'beautiful', 'student', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'same', 'time', 'compelling', 'government', 'agent', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'professor', 'break', 'codes', 'only', 'long', 'Nash', 'schizophrenic', 'break', 'struggled', 'treatment', 'thoughts', 'marriage', 'struggled', 'live', 'illness', 'own', 'terms', 'Mind', 'foggy', 'uplift', 'too.Still', 'then', 'important', 'movie', 'work', 'been', 'done', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'distinguished', 'enlightened', 'audience', 'final', 'speechifying', 'shots', 'Mrs.', 'Nash', 'tear-glistened', 'eyes', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'remembered', 'image', 'Crowe', 'young', 'Nash', 'solving', 'equations', 'windowpane', 'aflame', 'inspiration', 'very', 'close', 'madness']",N/A

I do not know whether or not this is true, but A BEAUTIFUL MIND, helped me to see what a brilliant person goes through when they also suffer from schizophrenia and what they see and do.This performance by Russell Crowe, as Dr. John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who, although unknown to the viewer at the time, shows signs of schizophrenia upon entering Princeton University, is Oscar calibre material as far as I am concerned. This is a true story about Dr. John Nash, who develops an economic formula which earns him a coveted position at Wheeler Labs. His brilliance at solving codes causes him to be approached by the Pentagon.Not knowing that he was schizophrenic, I truly believed that he was involved in government espionage work and was becoming so frightened that he was showing signs of madness. Not knowing anything about the life of Dr. Nash, I had no idea what the theme of this movie was and found myself shocked to realize that Dr. Nash was ""seeing and hearing things"". I still do not know how much involvement was real and how much was imagined.Jennifer Connolly gave an excellent performance as the wife who stuck by him through the good times and the bad, helping him to live with his illness and filter back into a functioning life,teaching at Princeton, and eventually earning the Nobel Prize in his later life.Christopher Plummer gave an outstanding performance as the psychiatrist who tries to help him. Again, at first, there was doubt as to whether he was a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"".The movie, directed by Ron Howard was riveting. It had humor and sadness and held my interest throughout.

Without giving too much away, the film is based on the novel by Nasar and depicts the life of John Nash a 1994 Nobel Prize winner in economics for his work on game theory, a new science that developed out of the optimism of the US victory in WWII and the mathematical advancements that helped in the victory from code breaking to the development of the atomic bomb.  I would have liked, in fact, to see more about the science, but the movie is not about science.  It';s really about his struggle to cope with schizofrenia and his wife's subsequent and even more moving struggle and courage to cope with her 'disabled' genious husband's disorder.  How easy it would have been for her to marry one of the other fine and handsome graduates of Princeton.  In typical Howard fashion, the movie has a definite feel good emotional ending but it's appropriate and after all Nash is still alive and teaching. I could not avoid comparing this film with Shine, another story of a genius that has to fight an emotional disorder after initial success and finds redemption after a long struggle against himself.  The flaws are minor and do not detract from the enjoyment of the film. I was curious to find out, for instance, how Nash' own family and his wife's family reacted to the disorder and his debilitation.  It's hinted that his wife felt some pressure to leave the husband but the subject is not explored.  No matter, the movie's integrity survives nonetheless. Russell Crowe is remarkable and delivers some hilarious dry lines amidst the serousness.  Connelly is as beautiful as ever and shows a serious side I had not suspected.

Turns out I enjoyed the film more than she did.  We had no idea who John Nash was.  My sister was expecting a romance movie.  I was expecting a documentary of his life.  In some ways, it's both.  In other ways, it's neither.  There indeed is romance and love involved in this story between John and his wife Alicia.  And it also does document the earlier days of John's life spent in academia (Princeton) which led to his groundbreaking discovery of an economic theory.In my opinion, Russell Crowe does a wonderful job of portraying the often quirky, always socially inept John Nash.  When I later discover he has schizophrenia, I thought to myself ""so that's what schizophrenia looks like"".  I immediately found sympathy for him, and realized that he really doesn't mean to be a bad person.  It really is a condition that can happen to anybody.  The special and interesting thing about John Nash is that he is able to rationalize this disorder and compartmentalize it in his mind so that he can continue living his life.  What a truly beautiful mind he has!Jennifer Connelly plays Alicia in this movie.  She's introduced to us as a drop-dead gorgeous student of John that has a feisty side to her.  We get a feeling early on that she finds something unique and attractive about John, and tries to enculturate him into society.  She makes him fall in love with her.  And so they get married.  That's when John's paranoid episodes get more intense and he is institutionalized for a while.  Yet through it all, Alicia is always patient, supportive, understanding and faithful.  She knew they could overcome this.  And she was right.This film to me is inspirational on many levels.  It's about an underdog who works hard to achieve the accomplishment of a lifetime.  It's about a man's battle with paranoid schizophrenia, and his subsequent triumph over it.  It's about the love of one woman for her husband through thick or thin.You must watch this film to understand.

Living a life that in the end appears mostly a lie, Nash eventually is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  At this point in his life, married with a child and working a steady job, Nash and those around him are finding it difficult to differentiate reality from the creations of his mind.  The movie then turns its focus on Nash's recovery and the effect his sickness has on those closest to him.Crowe is truly the star here, swallowing whole this character driven study on the human spirit and determination to survive.  He engulfs the screen and makes this mans plight come alive for the audience.  What's commendable here is that Howard's directing and of course the script, adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography, allow for the viewer to really connect with the entire cast, most importantly Nash himself.  This proves effective because once Nash's life is shattered before our very eyes and he begins to crumble we are brought to a place deep within our emotions that would have been impossible to touch had we not come to know Nash before his world came tumbling down.  We fall in love with this man and so we feel his pain, his wife's pain and are emotionally distressed alongside them both.Alongside Crowe both Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany deliver astounding performances as Nash's longsuffering wife and imaginary best friend.  Jennifer's Oscar winning performance is full of so much life, so much pain and emotional attachment that we can relate to and understand her feelings every step of the way.  We watch her transform from this woman who knew how to control the things around her, including Nash, to a woman scared of what was going to happen next, a woman who felt detached from all she thought was real.  Bettany's portrayal of Nash's college roommate is high spirited and refreshing.  He serves as our brightest comic relief but also our biggest heartbreak as we watch Nash realize he never truly had his friendship at all.Crowe, one of our finest actors, is a true chameleon and he engages himself so far into this role that he becomes John Nash, and watching that transformation is utterly rewarding.  His determination and fervor are so invested in this performance from the moment he appears on screen that one is automatically drawn to him and connected to him entirely.  From start to finish `A Beautiful Mind' proves itself worthy of our attention and consideration and is sure to astonish and amaze you.  From its heartbreaking story to its brilliantly crafted direction to its powerhouse performances, `A Beautiful Mind' is a winner from the top of its head to the tip of its toes.  The well rounded supporting cast including the likes of Ed Harris and Josh Lucas continue to astonish in their respective roles and aid in delivering one of the warmest and beautifully articulated Hollywood experiences.

Regardless of the stock you put in the decisions of the Academy of Motion Pictures, this film is still quite good and affecting on numerous levels. It seems that almost any film-not just a best picture winner-can get the glossy treatment of a two disc release. I have often wondered who had the brilliant idea to do double disc releases or special editions of pictures that, in my perfect world, would never EVER have been made, much less released on DVD (""Baseketball"" anyone? The Adam Sandler catalogue-excepting ""The Wedding Singer"" of course) In this case, the discs contain a lot of info, but none of it seems terribly compelling, save for Ron Howard's home video footage of Dr. Nash explaining his equilibrium theory. The section on the music of the film for example, seems short and rather dull like so many other DVD's which feature special segments on the soundtrack. James Horner talks about how he tried to harness the moods that he experienced while watching the film. Hardly mind-blowing. I think that's what ALL composers do...There are other extras that seem fine-not bad, not great either. (The standard for DVD was clearly set by the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, a film and package that deserves the treatment it received.) The picture quality is quite good, I have not experienced any pixelation yet. I don't know that I would have picked this film for best picture, but I certainly don't hold the view of some who say it should not have even been a contender. What makes the film compelling is that it is loosely based on the life of some real people. There have been ample opportunities for people-including the real Dr. Nash-to bash the film. He and wife Alicia have not. It's hard to imagine how some of the excised portions of the book could be sucessfully worked into the film without it become completely unfocused and disjointed. Howard states as much in his [usually] interesting feature length commentary.  Almost all of the deleted scenes are great and-in my opinion-should have been left in the final cut.If his goal was to portray a man's struggle with schizophrenia and his journey through self-discovery and the discovery of love, then he suceeded. Take the film for what it is-a good drama and an inspiring story.To the reviewer who didn't appreciate Howard's treatment of the disease, go watch any number of depressing films dealing with mental illness and tell me we don't need a bit more hope in our worldview of it. Who's saying everyone with Dr. Nash's illness can be so easily 'cured'? When we see Dr. Nash with his old friend-now head of the department at Princeton-his friend asks him if 'they are still there', refering to the three characters that Nash imagines. ""Yes"" Nash replies. And when the man from the Nobel committee asks Dr. Nash about his delusions, Nash states ""I still see things that are not there. I just choose not to acknowledge them. Kind of like a diet of the mind."" So clearly, Dr. Nash himself has NOT been cured. [On his commentary, Ron Howard goes to great pains to describe the research that went into the film, the care that was used to ensure that the disease was treated in a proper manner.]  He has, however, learned how to COPE with an illness he still struggles with-Isn't this an uplifting view of mental illness?

I'm glad that I made the trip -- twice -- to see this incredibly informative, enlightening and well-documented journey of one man's trip through the world of mental illness.The thing that I believe struck me the strongest when I walked out of that theater was this: I had been inside the head of a man (John Nash) who has this illness, and didn't even know it until well into the film! The first half (or so) of this movie was shot from nearly a first person viewpoint, but was done so skillfully that the viewer isn't even aware of it. At first, I was a little annoyed to see that my first perceptions of the storyline were wrong. Then I started to see a little glimmer of understanding. Soon, that glimmer was a full-blown light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel understanding. That was the whole point. To see the world as someone with that kind of illness sees it. Not to feel sorry for that person, not to even really empathize with them, but to truly BE them.I WAS John Nash for the first portion of this film, I think I now have a clearer, more defined understanding, and for that, I'm grateful.Wonderful movie, which truly deserves the Oscars that it won.",5,Enlightening...,1017100800,"03 26, 2002",2002,1289,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'trailer', 'not', 'just', 'delightful', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'either', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'trip', 'twice', 'see', 'incredibly', 'informative', 'enlightening', 'well-documented', 'journey', 'one', 'man', 'trip', 'world', 'mental', 'illness.The', 'thing', 'believe', 'struck', 'strongest', 'when', 'walked', 'theater', 'was', 'had', 'been', 'head', 'man', 'John', 'Nash', 'who', 'illness', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'well', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'nearly', 'first', 'person', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'skillfully', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'annoyed', 'see', 'first', 'perceptions', 'storyline', 'were', 'wrong', 'Then', 'started', 'see', 'little', 'glimmer', 'understanding', 'Soon', 'glimmer', 'was', 'full-blown', 'light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel', 'understanding', 'was', 'whole', 'point', 'see', 'world', 'someone', 'kind', 'illness', 'sees', 'Not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'person', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'empathize', 'truly', 'BE', 'them.I', 'WAS', 'John', 'Nash', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'think', 'now', 'have', 'clearer', 'more', 'defined', 'understanding', ""'m"", 'grateful.Wonderful', 'movie', 'truly', 'Oscars', 'won']",N/A

I will go on the presumption that it's mostly true, however, because, like Alicia Nash so eloquently tells her husband at the near-breaking point, &quot;I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.&quot;I think, after this movie, I do.I hadn't known the story of John Nash until I saw A Beautiful Mind, and now I'd truly like to find out more about him, because he is a fascinating character. Russel Crowe plays him to perfection, once again proving that he is deserving of more than one Oscar. Whether he is talking to friends at Princeton, or relating with the imaginary people he constructed due to his schizophrenia, or goofily wooing his future wife, he is utterly John Nash. Jennifer Connelly should finally have a breakthrough in this movie - she is literally glowing. She's been fantastic in everything else I saw her in, from Dark City to Requeim for a Dream, although, until now, her full potential just hasn't been used. It's definitely utilized here! Ed Harris was perfect, as always.Because I barely knew what to expect going in, I had a great experience. There was actually a point in the movie where I didn't know what was true: Nash's delusions or the people trying to convince him he WAS delusional. Ron Howard is that good, he nearly had me duped into believing in the delusion, just like Nash had. I must say his false beliefs were, at times, more fun than the true events happening around him.But the movie proved me wrong. It is his struggle to overcome schizophrenia, or to at least learn to live with it, that is truly the heart of the matter. And it is more interesting than international espionage, more touching than a friendly roommate with a little niece.

John is a genius, in fact, egoistical genius, and he cannot lose on his passion Mathematics. In an environment of smart people around, John is finding himself difficult to identify but believe it, he is an extraordinary genius. He could decrypt complex patterns in no time. Unfortunately there are a couple of more fictitious people he has too - a good friend, who listens to him, motivates him and guides him (Charles), Charles' niece (Marcee) and a CIA Agent (William Parcher) - owing to his problem and he creates his own world for them and lives with them.The director has pointed out one thing clearly - most of the psychological problems can be cured more by the self than any medication. John realizing that Marcee is not growing with age is a wonderful scene to exemplify this. The drugs do not help him recover from his problems and the trouble John faces is portrayed very nicely. To his support is his wife Alicia. Russel Crowe has given his best performance even though he over-acted in couple of instances.Overall, a good movie worth watching.

My own diagnosis of him during the early part of the movie was Asperger's Syndrome, but eventually the diagnosis of schizophrenia is fully justified. Until we get pretty far into the story, the audience doesn't know any more than Dr. Nash does about what is real and what is hallucination. So having given that tiny clue, amuse yourself by trying to guess. Chances are you will be at least partly wrong.But as the movie also makes clear, a brilliant mind is not proof against mental illness, and indeed may be at least part of the cause. It might be interesting to look up some statistics on that, but not right now. Right now the important thing is one woman (Jennifer Connolly) loved him, and stood by him when his illness caused them both a great deal of trouble. She earned the right to be dressed to the nines and sit in an auditorium in Stockholm, applauding and glowing with pride as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics. It was for the work he had done long ago, which turned out to have practical implications beyond what even he had considered.It's a very real, very compassionate look at what can go wrong in even a beautiful mind.

590426,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKQZ,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[4, 5]","It is clear from a viewing of this very good film what Hollywood found so intriguing and so fascinating about the life of Nobel laureate John Nash. It is indeed a life that was distinguished by a raging plethora of contradictory qualities and experiences, and one in which much was suffered and yet much gained. Thus it was by virtue of the very range of these seemingly irreconcilable aspects to his complicated, convoluted, and extremely troubled existence that his story was deemed to be so irresistible that they gave it the ""whole Hollywood treatment"".  In a phrase, then, in the movie industry's judgment Doctor Nash was notably nuts, and was a distinguished Noble Prize-winning nutcase at that. And, oh, how Hollywood loves to romanticize such accomplished, misunderstood and unlikable miscreants.That much said, the acting was quite good, and the director truly was inspired, and deserved an Oscar for his work. For he does deliver an immensely entertaining and enormously interesting piece of work here, however badly it may misrepresent the true and authentic set of situations it is portending to recreate. Using a barrelful of creative license, Ron Howard deep sixes the accuracy of the events to weave a lovely period piece about love, intellect, and madness. So too, Russell Crowe's acting delivers a powerful testimony to the agony of his afflictions, yet it too is so stylized and so pushed along by special effects that somehow we wind up feeling almost envious of the protagonist's beautiful hallucinations of a world far more singularly novel, photogenic and breath-taking than the one the majority of us seem to inhabit day in and day out.Jennifer Connelly is stunning and lovely, and her victory at winning the Academy Award speaks volumes for how little is expected of actresses in some dramatic roles. So, while I liked the movie for what it was, I was disappointed to find it such a sugary and sentimental representation of the events as they actually transpired. The story was often uneven and disjointed, so while my interest was maintained, I would be less than candid if I didn't say that I thought it a bit too long and at points a bit belabored.  A good movie, but in my humble estimation  hardly a great movie. Glad to see Ron Howard win the Oscar, but did not think this was the best he has ever done.

I guess I just wasn't in the mood. But after seeing the movie, I was so glad I did!. What a movie!. What performances!. It was easily my favorite movie I had seen this past year. Okay, on with the movie. Russell Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant mathematician who first began at Princeton University, where he created an incredible economic theory. This got him a MIT professorship as well. But then came a horrible down side. Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The disease made Nash become delusional. Through all this, he did win the Nobel Prize too. The delusion part of Nash's life is what Howard really goes for here in the film. He really gives you a look at the disease and of any mental health problems that hasn't really been done before on the big screen. He did it perfectly with no flaws at all. Mr. Crowe. What can I say?. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect his work and think he is one of our greatest actors we have working today. He is tremendous. You have never really seen a performance like this before. If you say you have and that it's cliched, as I know some of you out there have, you just didn't get it. Crowe's performance is downright astonishing. Your not watching Crowe. You are watching John Nash. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this, well, then there is no need for the academy to go on. He deserves it for this. He really didn't for ""Gladiator"". And then there is the lovely and brilliant Jennifer Connelly. She holds her own up against Crowe, and that is no easy task. It only shows you how remarkable she is. I never would have suspected her to be in this kind of acclaim when I saw her in her ealier career(Labryinth, Seven Minutes In Heaven, The Rocketeer, Suspiria). She really is worthy of all the attention. The supporting actors are all great. Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, and even Judd Hirsch. The music by James Horner is perfect for this film. Many people bash it as 'sappy' and 'cliched'. Oh please. This movie is great filmmaking. The acting is the best that we could possibly hope for. Anybody who doesn't see that, or has to ridicule because it left out some elements from the book, need to relax. Get over it. What it all comes down too people, is that this is a love story. Alicia Nash stayed with John through all of the hell. Today, they are in their 70's, and they are still very much together. Nothing is more powerful than that. How wonderful. A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. It rekindles your faith in filmmaking. Come Oscar time, if there aren't any gold statues with this film's title on them, it will be a huge upset.

Ron Howard's directorial masterpiece is displayed here as he depicts the story of mathematical genius and Princeton University legend, John Nash.When John Nash arrives at Princeton in the 1940's he is granted, a little strange and eccentric and not always entirely friendly. But that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with him, does it? As he struggles to complete his rigorous courses in graduate school, he is accompanied by his loyal and literary-minded roommate, Chris Herman. When Nash manages to complete a revolutionary theory on economics, he is told that he is either extremely pretentious and supercilious or has changed the world of business transactions in an unimaginable fashion. Fortunately, for him, the latter proves to be true.Nash is given a position at the prestigious Wheeler Institute and teaching position at Princeton. It is here that he meets the beautiful, intelligent, and compassionate Alicia. As he cultivates a friendship and affinity with her, he is also astounded to be enlisted as a decoding expert for the CIA. The job is intense as John Nash realizes the consequences of what will happen if he fails (possible destruction of the US by the Russians) or gets caught. Yet his desire for love leads him to propose and marry Alicia, and for a while it seems that Nash has the life any intellectual would dream of.Yet his work becomes more and more constrictive and his mysterious boss regards his attachments and prospective family with contempt. Things close in on John Nash when he is giving a lecture at Harvard University. A psychiatrist approaches him and gives him an order to be taken to a psychiatric hospital. It is hear that his reality comes down around him with a crashing halt. As Nash gradually realizes the truth about his life and his illness (schizophrenia), he is forced to make some dramatic decisions about his life. The medication for schizophrenia at this time, had severe side-effects including drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, and withdrawal. Yet when Nash tries to dismiss his illness, his attempts prove gravely dangerous. It is only when he enlists his profound intelligence and the support of family and friends that he can learn to push aside his illness and regain his life.This was a spectacular movie! The portrayal of John Nash's delusions delude the audience as well. I had always thought of Russel Crowe as being kind of a diva, but he actually proved to do a very good job in this role. And relative-unknown Jennifer Connelly was perfect as Nash's adoring and loyal wife. The only problem with the movie is that if you dig beneath the surface, you realize that Nash was not exactly the tender, gushy-about-his-wife sweetheart that he was when he accepted the Nobel Prize. Rumors of adultery and arrogance have run rampant after this movie came out. Nevertheless, I think Ron Howard did right to leave these details out as he was trying to show the audience psychosis in a different light. Although it is long, this movie is very powerful and intensive in many of its scenes, particularly after Nash's initial hospitalization and diagnosis. I believe this is an important film that can counter-influence stereotypes brought on by the recent Andrea Yates case. I hope Hollywood decides to promote more movies of this genre.",4,A BEAUTIFUL MIND IN MADNESS,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,3423,"['who', 'remember', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'were', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Opie', 'here', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'directorial', 'masterpiece', 'displayed', 'here', 'story', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'Princeton', 'University', 'legend', 'John', 'Nash.When', 'John', 'Nash', 'Princeton', '1940', 'granted', 'little', 'strange', 'eccentric', 'not', 'always', 'entirely', 'friendly', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'wrong', 'complete', 'rigorous', 'courses', 'graduate', 'school', 'accompanied', 'loyal', 'literary-minded', 'roommate', 'Chris', 'Herman', 'When', 'Nash', 'complete', 'revolutionary', 'theory', 'economics', 'told', 'extremely', 'pretentious', 'supercilious', 'changed', 'world', 'business', 'transactions', 'unimaginable', 'fashion', 'Fortunately', 'latter', 'proves', 'be', 'true.Nash', 'given', 'position', 'prestigious', 'Wheeler', 'Institute', 'teaching', 'position', 'Princeton', 'here', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'compassionate', 'Alicia', 'friendship', 'affinity', 'also', 'astounded', 'be', 'enlisted', 'decoding', 'expert', 'CIA', 'job', 'intense', 'John', 'Nash', 'consequences', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'possible', 'destruction', 'US', 'Russians', 'caught', 'desire', 'love', 'propose', 'marry', 'Alicia', 'while', 'Nash', 'life', 'intellectual', 'would', 'dream', 'of.Yet', 'work', 'becomes', 'more', 'more', 'constrictive', 'mysterious', 'boss', 'regards', 'attachments', 'prospective', 'family', 'contempt', 'Things', 'close', 'John', 'Nash', 'when', 'giving', 'lecture', 'Harvard', 'University', 'A', 'psychiatrist', 'approaches', 'order', 'be', 'taken', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'hear', 'reality', 'down', 'crashing', 'halt', 'Nash', 'gradually', 'truth', 'life', 'illness', 'schizophrenia', 'forced', 'make', 'dramatic', 'decisions', 'life', 'medication', 'schizophrenia', 'time', 'had', 'severe', 'side-effects', 'including', 'drowsiness', 'sexual', 'dysfunction', 'withdrawal', 'when', 'Nash', 'dismiss', 'illness', 'attempts', 'prove', 'gravely', 'dangerous', 'only', 'when', 'profound', 'intelligence', 'support', 'family', 'friends', 'can', 'learn', 'push', 'aside', 'illness', 'regain', 'life.This', 'was', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Nash', 'delusions', 'delude', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'being', 'kind', 'diva', 'actually', 'proved', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'relative-unknown', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'perfect', 'Nash', 'adoring', 'loyal', 'wife', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'dig', 'surface', 'realize', 'Nash', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'tender', 'gushy-about-his-wife', 'sweetheart', 'was', 'when', 'accepted', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Rumors', 'adultery', 'arrogance', 'have', 'run', 'rampant', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'did', 'right', 'leave', 'details', 'out', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'audience', 'psychosis', 'different', 'light', 'long', 'movie', 'very', 'powerful', 'intensive', 'many', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Nash', 'initial', 'hospitalization', 'diagnosis', 'believe', 'important', 'film', 'can', 'counter-influence', 'stereotypes', 'brought', 'recent', 'Andrea', 'case', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'decides', 'promote', 'more', 'movies', 'genre']",N/A

590435,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B00005JKQZ,BigSPEEGS,"[6, 7]","On the surface, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a biopic of John Nash, one of America's great mathematicians. But that statement is misleading. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not a film that paints a big, sweeping portrayal of the events of one man' life. Instead, in the way that Ed Harris did last year with ""Pollock"", Ron Howard gives the viewer a more personal look at the subject of the film. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't take the easy route and merely dramatize everything that Nash accomplished, for that would really only be a two-hour way of saying ""Won Nobel Prize for..."" They let us get to know Nash as only those who were closest to him knew him, and most remarkably show us how his mind processed and who he was.John Nash (Russell Crowe) is a math student studying at Princeton College. His friends are studying and building on the works of what he considers to be ""lesser mortals"", while what he really wants to do is come up with a truly original idea. He spends his time alone, trying to find definitive patterns to everyday movements, games, etc. He gets encouragement from his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), but I'll jump the gun a little and tell you this is where the trouble starts. Suddenly, he does find his original idea, and it is so revolutionary that he is given a grant to study/teach at MIT. There, he meets Alicia, a student of his that he has begun to court. The two get married a while later, but during this time, Alicia doesn't see that Nash is being plagued by delusions, one a CIA operative (Parcher, played by Ed Harris) who enlists him on a ""top secret mission"" to try and discover secret encoded messages in periodicals supposedly being sent out by Russian spies. His empty quest starts to devour him, as he dreams of the Russians coming after him and other secret forces closing in. Alicia begins to notice that something is definitely wrong, and starts to help her husband try and realize what is real and what isn't.""A Beautiful Mind"" is a solid, powerful drama. I'll re-iterate that it doesn't tell us everything about John Nash, and sometimes that irked me. I admit I did not know much about John Nash's accomplishments, and going out, I wasn't in the least bit enlightened on that front. His supposedly breakthrough work on game theory goes relatively unexplained here, and that was one thing in the film that could have used a little tweaking. However, this is about the man, not the work. Many people have complained about the film's ignorance towards Nash's bisexuality, and I would have to disagree with them to an extent. There are moments in where bisexuality is most definitely hinted at. This would be more of a problem if the film was not so obviously trying to focus on Nash's paranoid schizophrenia, something that is portrayed magnificently.Akiva Goldsman has fashioned his screenplay in such a way that we are put in Nash's shoes, and then brought to see a more objective view. At first, we have little idea as to what Nash's delusions are, they all blend into reality seamlessly. Then, they start to get more outrageous, and when Nash's fears of these images start to be brought out into the public, we start to look at him from another viewpoint. However, we feel for him, because we have seen what he is going through, and we feel for those affected by him (especially Alicia) because he has become so out of touch with the world.This film is a prime example of what Russell Crowe can do when he's not out toga partying with Ridley Scott. He gives one of his best performances, portraying the schizophrenia without over-doing it or milking moments for their dramatic value. Another actor might immediately approach the subject grimly and teary-eyed, but Nash at first cannot realize what he is seeing does not exist, so why should he be afraid? Jennifer Connelly gives the other extraordinary performance in the film. Connelly has been one of the most under-appreciated and hardest working actresses in the business, and it is wonderful that she will now get the recognition she deserves for her powerful, passionate portrayal of Alicia Nash.""A Beautiful Mind"" is compelling film that never stoops to endorse melodrama or over-acting. It doesn't get all the details of John Nash's life in, that much is true, but it doesn't need to. It has a purpose, and it executes it in magnificent form. It is a fine, intricately constructed vision of paranoid schizophrenia and a man who had the will to defeat it. And although skeptics will attack it until the cows come home, the truth is that ""Mind"" is beautiful.",4,"Worthy, yet not the best film of the year",1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,4565,"['surface', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'biopic', 'John', 'Nash', 'one', 'America', 'great', 'mathematicians', 'statement', 'misleading', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'not', 'film', 'big', 'sweeping', 'portrayal', 'events', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'Instead', 'way', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'did', 'last', 'year', 'Pollock', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'viewer', 'more', 'personal', 'look', 'subject', 'film', 'Howard', 'screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'route', 'merely', 'dramatize', 'everything', 'Nash', 'accomplished', 'would', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'two-hour', 'way', 'saying', 'Won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'Nash', 'only', 'who', 'were', 'closest', 'knew', 'most', 'remarkably', 'show', 'how', 'mind', 'processed', 'who', 'Nash', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'math', 'student', 'studying', 'Princeton', 'College', 'friends', 'are', 'studying', 'building', 'works', 'what', 'be', 'lesser', 'mortals', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'truly', 'original', 'idea', 'time', 'alone', 'trying', 'find', 'definitive', 'patterns', 'everyday', 'movements', 'games', 'etc', 'encouragement', 'roommate', 'Charles', 'Paul', 'Bettany', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'gun', 'little', 'tell', 'where', 'trouble', 'Suddenly', 'find', 'original', 'idea', 'so', 'revolutionary', 'given', 'grant', 'study/teach', 'MIT', 'Alicia', 'student', 'begun', 'court', 'two', 'get', 'married', 'while', 'later', 'time', 'Alicia', ""n't"", 'see', 'Nash', 'being', 'plagued', 'delusions', 'one', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Parcher', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'top', 'secret', 'mission', 'try', 'discover', 'secret', 'encoded', 'messages', 'periodicals', 'supposedly', 'being', 'sent', 'out', 'Russian', 'spies', 'empty', 'quest', 'devour', 'Russians', 'coming', 'other', 'secret', 'forces', 'closing', 'Alicia', 'notice', 'something', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'help', 'husband', 'try', 'realize', 'what', 'real', 'what', ""n't"", 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'solid', 'powerful', 'drama', ""'ll"", 're-iterate', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everything', 'John', 'Nash', 'sometimes', 'irked', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'John', 'Nash', 'accomplishments', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'enlightened', 'front', 'supposedly', 'breakthrough', 'work', 'game', 'theory', 'relatively', 'unexplained', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'tweaking', 'However', 'man', 'not', 'work', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'ignorance', 'towards', 'Nash', 'bisexuality', 'would', 'have', 'disagree', 'extent', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'bisexuality', 'most', 'definitely', 'hinted', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'obviously', 'trying', 'focus', 'Nash', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'something', 'portrayed', 'magnificently.Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'fashioned', 'screenplay', 'such', 'way', 'are', 'put', 'Nash', 'shoes', 'then', 'brought', 'see', 'more', 'objective', 'view', 'first', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'Nash', 'delusions', 'are', 'blend', 'reality', 'seamlessly', 'Then', 'start', 'get', 'more', 'outrageous', 'when', 'Nash', 'fears', 'images', 'start', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'public', 'start', 'look', 'viewpoint', 'However', 'feel', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'going', 'feel', 'affected', 'especially', 'Alicia', 'become', 'so', 'touch', 'world.This', 'film', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'not', 'out', 'toga', 'partying', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'portraying', 'schizophrenia', 'over-doing', 'milking', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'value', 'actor', 'might', 'immediately', 'approach', 'subject', 'grimly', 'teary-eyed', 'Nash', 'first', 'can', 'not', 'realize', 'what', 'seeing', 'not', 'exist', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'afraid', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'other', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'film', 'Connelly', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'under-appreciated', 'hardest', 'working', 'actresses', 'business', 'wonderful', 'will', 'now', 'get', 'recognition', 'powerful', 'passionate', 'portrayal', 'Alicia', 'Nash', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'compelling', 'film', 'never', 'endorse', 'melodrama', 'over-acting', ""n't"", 'get', 'details', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'much', 'true', ""n't"", 'need', 'purpose', 'magnificent', 'form', 'fine', 'intricately', 'constructed', 'vision', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'will', 'defeat', 'skeptics', 'will', 'attack', 'cows', 'come', 'home', 'truth', 'Mind', 'beautiful']",N/A

It is scary, really, how a craftsman like Howard can manipulate an interesting, but in many ways unattractive story and make it seem magnificent.  The magnificence is entirely deserved, if you imagine the struggle that Nash went through, and this is the main point of the movie.  However, its entirely desceptive, when you realize that no one cares much about a story involving unattractive, boring, sick people.  So he casts visually stunning people in the leads, and voila!You can always count on a Ron Howard movie to be high quality, and ""Beautiful Mind does not disappoint.""  I attended Princeton, studied multi-variable calculus, and took a course in ""game theory.""  Many aspects of the movie were realisic, but many weren't.  Its interesting that Howard seems to anticipate and respect this, so he packed a second DVD with bonus material that includes lots of reality - from an interview with Nash, to details about how the screenplay was developed, etc.The real hero of this movie is Alicia Nash.  ""Beautiful Mind"" could have been called, ""Beautiful Wife,"" because it is the spectacular loyalty of Mrs. Nash that was truly heroic.  I can't imagine the character she must have possessed to stick by him all of those years.  {...which is yet another area where reality disappoints.  In reality, she was very loyal, but in fact, they did separate and live apart for many years....}.  Once again (this is why I like Ron Howard), this point is not overlooked due to the marvelous ending (Ron; you should have done it with the audience disappearing!).The breath-taking visual impact of Jennifer Connally, which on the surface could not have been more unrealistically cast, would appear to be entirely wrong for the part.

The brainchild of popular director Ron Howard (Opie from The Andy Griffith Show), A Beautiful Mind debuted to widespread critical acclaim due to the depth of its screenplay, the brilliant performances of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, and the in-depth portrayal of a victim of mental illness. Based on the true story of John Nash, a schizophrenic mathematical genius who overcame his illness and went on to win the prestigious Nobel Prize for his ""Game Theory,"" A Beautiful Mind is one of the best films of the decade...A young mathematical genius, John Nash (Russell Crowe) enjoys the early success of a budding career in academia. Able to complete mathematical formulas that baffle many of the greatest minds of his time, a young Nash stands on the brink of profound discovery with a limitless future and seemingly inevitable fame at his doorstep. Meeting a beautiful girl at an evening party, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) would later become Nash's wife. The two seem destined for a life of bliss. But Nash's problems were not confined to the mathematical arena...Suffering from schizophrenia, Nash develops an acute sense of paranoia, decoding encrypted non-existent Soviet spy messages from comic books and newspaper advertisements. The reality in which he lives does not exist, and it threatens to tear apart his marriage, his career, and the very life which he holds dear... Can Nash overcome his debilitating disease and pursue the course of excellence to which he once seemed destined? The cast and crew of A Beautiful Mind allow us to see a whole new world through the eyes of suffering genius...Russell Crowe's follow up performance to smash hits LA Confidential and Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind is an unbelievable journey into one man's reality. Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic Nash and Jennifer Connelly's standout performance as the woman who loved him form an onscreen synergy that continually drives the screenplay of A Beautiful Mind. Exhibiting quality direction from Ron Howard, the film stands as an eternal testament to the beauty of the human mind and the durability of the human spirit to overcome obstacles and shine at its brightest.A fascinating film which successfully blurs the lines between John Nash's imagination and the world of reality, A Beautiful Mind vividly illustrates one man's struggle against great odds. As Nash's paranoia and hallucinations collude to blot out the genius of a beautiful mind, the power of the human spirit rallies to great heights - achieving a Nobel Prize and even the immortalization of one's own life in film! Nash should be lauded for his triumph against a paralyzing disease, and Ron Howard should be praised for delivering a cinematic masterpiece that shows us the true beauty of one man's plight. For these reasons and more, A Beautiful Mind is definite must-see film - perhaps one of the fifty best films of all time...The DVD Report",5,One of the best films of the decade...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3075,"['Nominated', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'four', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'one', 'premier', 'dramas', 'decade', 'brainchild', 'popular', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Opie', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'debuted', 'widespread', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'due', 'depth', 'screenplay', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'in-depth', 'portrayal', 'victim', 'mental', 'illness', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'John', 'Nash', 'schizophrenic', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'who', 'illness', 'went', 'win', 'prestigious', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Game', 'Theory', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'decade', 'young', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'John', 'Nash', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'early', 'success', 'budding', 'career', 'academia', 'Able', 'complete', 'mathematical', 'formulas', 'baffle', 'many', 'greatest', 'minds', 'time', 'young', 'Nash', 'brink', 'profound', 'discovery', 'limitless', 'future', 'seemingly', 'inevitable', 'fame', 'doorstep', 'Meeting', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'evening', 'party', 'Alicia', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'Nash', 'wife', 'two', 'seem', 'destined', 'life', 'bliss', 'Nash', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'confined', 'mathematical', 'arena', 'Suffering', 'schizophrenia', 'Nash', 'acute', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'decoding', 'encrypted', 'non-existent', 'Soviet', 'spy', 'messages', 'comic', 'books', 'newspaper', 'advertisements', 'reality', 'not', 'exist', 'tear', 'apart', 'marriage', 'career', 'very', 'life', 'Can', 'Nash', 'overcome', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'pursue', 'course', 'excellence', 'once', 'seemed', 'destined', 'cast', 'crew', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'allow', 'see', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'eyes', 'suffering', 'genius', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'follow', 'up', 'performance', 'smash', 'hits', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'Gladiator', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'unbelievable', 'journey', 'one', 'man', 'reality', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'schizophrenic', 'Nash', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'standout', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'form', 'onscreen', 'synergy', 'continually', 'screenplay', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Exhibiting', 'quality', 'direction', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'film', 'eternal', 'testament', 'beauty', 'human', 'mind', 'durability', 'human', 'spirit', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'shine', 'brightest.A', 'fascinating', 'film', 'successfully', 'lines', 'John', 'Nash', 'imagination', 'world', 'reality', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'vividly', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'great', 'odds', 'Nash', 'paranoia', 'hallucinations', 'collude', 'blot', 'out', 'genius', 'beautiful', 'mind', 'power', 'human', 'spirit', 'great', 'heights', 'achieving', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'even', 'immortalization', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'film', 'Nash', 'should', 'be', 'lauded', 'triumph', 'paralyzing', 'disease', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'delivering', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'true', 'beauty', 'one', 'man', 'plight', 'reasons', 'more', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'perhaps', 'one', 'fifty', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I only know mathematician John Nash owing to this film and something else I have read after showing it. I think he's truly a superb scientist, supported by the incomparable opportunities the USA universities offer to these people over- dowered.But for me this movie has two central failures; these are, the hallucinations are presented in a form too solid and coarse, so, the viewer also believes the FBI agent and the student of Literature,, mate of Nash at the University are real. This trick, of course, surprises later the spectator, but I think hallucinations from schizophrenia are more subtle, untouchable things than these sturdy ghosts.In other side, it seems Nash, being aware he suffers a terrible disease, uses his powerful mind to fight against the schizophrenia, so, he orders his hallucinations to retire and vanish. I think this is also unbelievable. Such unfortunate patients simply can't do anything in that way. I at less think so: volition and will are powerful weapons, but we humans are limited and is convenient to know when an effort is reasonable although difficult, and what is simply impossible, although at last, yes, who can say until when the will and love are operative?.This is because the formidable mind of John Nash is very strong in dealing with abstract questions, surely he's one of that persons with a very high intelligence quotient, but mental illness are I think mostly a problem with deep roots in another class of intelligence not measurable with the  IQ. Unfortunately, there, Nash is weaker.  People as him have an asymmetrical mind. Today perhaps these is called today emotional intelligence, tomorrow we don't know, that doesn't matter here. Human beings have several classes of ""brains"" inside. A bad coordination of these complex mental machinery can drive to these illness.Perhaps the physical strong Russel Crowe is neither the ideal protagonist for this personage but that isn't so important.

Certain aspects were not included.  I think these people are missing the point of this film.  What this film does that is startling is that it takes you into the mind of Princeton professor John Nash so that you can experience being there.  You are able to unfold in layers what it is like being a math genius as well as someone being engulfed by schizophrenia.  In fact, you are not suprised that a person with this kind of genius can be engulfed by madness.  The two seem to flow effortlessly together.  Russell Crowe's performance is simply astonishing.  I am not a fan of ""Gladiator"" and thought his performance there undeserving of the Best Actor Oscar.  However, both his performance here and in ""Disclosure"" are about as deserving of the Oscar as is possible. The relationship I thought was the key one in this film was the one between Nash and his college roommate. That relationship is central to the entire film and ultimately tells you everything you need to know about Nash and his mind.  The marital relationship is fine as depicted. Jennifer Connelly does a good job. But this aspect tells us more about how distressing his problems were for his family, which is not new territory in the movies.

The bad news is that the major reason it was made was due to his mental illness. John Nash is a mathematician whose work in the theory of games won him a Nobel Prize in economics, and yet he suffers from mental illness that was so severe that he sometimes literally lived in another world.Mathematically speaking, the producers do as good a job as possible of explaining the significance of Nash's work. Using the model of lecherous graduate students cooperating in an attempt to woo the sexual favors of a beautiful woman made for a very funny scene. Some of the scenes are very intense, and there are times when you really do not know what is portraying accurate events and what is simply due to the actions of Nash's mind. Russell Crowe is superb as John Nash, he plays all scenes very well, especially those where he is acting out the fantasies.As is always the case, the producers use a great deal of poetic license in portraying the actual events of Nash's life. Nevertheless, there are some scenes that are very accurate and that math professors can relate to.

Granted, there are a few moments where scenes with his wife teeter on sappy, but overall I think the film depicts rather well the horror that must have been, and still is, Nash's life as a schizophrenic. The acting is uniformly excellent--Russell Crowe shows far more of his capability(and should have got the Oscar) here as an actor than in GLADIATOR The supporting cast is also first-rate--Jennifer Connelly gives a quiet, beautifully restrained performance as Alicia Nash(and I think it's safe to say the Oscar wasn't completely unjustified), and there's also equally fine work from Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, and ChristopherPlummer.

It was really a pleasure to watch her face as she watched Russell's riveting performance and then see her cry, when &quot;John Nash&quot; received his pens. She was truly moved and of course, so was I.I then came home and &quot;Gladiator&quot; was on HBO, and I sat there, nearly stunned, watching this very same man play an entirely different kind of role and realized what a true chameleon and utterly brilliant film presence Russell is. His ability to encompass a character to the point where he seems to change his skin and color, like the chameleon, is truly amazing. And I challenge anyone who sees this film to not believe they are looking at Russell at age 70. I have NEVER seen an actor age beyone his years more convincingly. (Did anyone think he looked just like another brilliant actor, the late Jason Robards?)I've read a lot of critiques on this film and some have said it oversimplifies or somehow makes light of the illness. I challenge that and say this: when a film works, it works at the level of simplicity, it works when the story is told in the simplest way to achieve the inner truth of its characters and this film does this in spades. The visual way in which Ron Howard and of course, Russell, show us Nash's delusions and paranoia is at its simplest, and therefore we connect and understand. What can be better than that? I also could see so clearly how love can keep a man alive, and Jennifer Connelly was also amazing in this movie. There are also little cinematic touches (e.g., lights) that continue to show us Nash's mind. I say, bravo, Ron Howard.See this film, then watch &quot;Gladiator&quot; and tell me you are not amazed (or, at the very least, &quot;not entertained?&quot;).

590458,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B00005JKQZ,Christopher Engel,"[2, 5]","If you're going to make a movie about a historical figure and his experiences with schizophrenia, it should at least be somewhat accurate so the people who know about at least one of those can get something out of it.Really, the primary problem is that this film is staggeringly insensitive toward everything it portrays, particularly John Nash, schizophrenia, mental illness in general (Pro tip: Love doesn't cure schizophrenia, and there is no cure for schizophrenia. Someone with severe melancholic depression might as well be told to ""get over it"" and poof, it would do *nothing* to ease it. Same with schizophrenia, or any other chronic mental illness. End of discussion.), and mental health treatment, even for its time period.You can read the top critical review on why this story is almost entirely fiction. About the only thing it gets right was that there was a mathematician named John Nash and he suffered from mild auditory hallucinations. Also, he was anti-semitic. Not a lot of good to say about him, but you know, severe schizophrenia does destroy the brain in irreversible ways. But there were no visual hallucinations of any kind.Oh, but he wasn't allowed to give any sort of speech like he did at the end, because he was spiteful, psychotic, and no one let him, for obvious reasons.But I can stand that. So the screenwriters were Oscar-fishers with this one, choosing not to portray Nash's real life in any way whatsoever. Things tend to go that way in Hollywood. That's fine.But this is what isn't fine at all: Chronic mental illness, which includes, by definition, schizophrenia, is treated like any mild depressive episode that goes away with time and support. You can't talk someone out of schizophrenia. There is no cure for schizophrenia. None whatsoever. Especially not a good relationship (which Nash never had at any point), since schizophrenia's symptoms can only be managed with medication. ECT is also sometimes used in extremely severe cases.Oh, right, ECT, or Electro-Convulsive Therapy. I'm sure this film scared everyone who could benefit from that, even save their lives, from liking that idea. If you want to know what real ECT is, imagine someone temporarily sedated with a muscle relaxant, one or two electrodes are attached to their head, and controlled bursts of electricity are administered. As this happens, typically for only about 10-15 minutes during which the person is unconscious and can't feel a thing, you know what doesn't happen? Violent spasms. They are almost completely immobile during the procedure and, at worst, have transient headaches afterward, which is, more often than not, totally offset by the fact that it has a very good success rate.ECT is basically a ""reboot the brain"" sort of thing. The electricity causes a controlled seizure (hence muscle relaxants that null anything unpleasant, or even unpleasant-looking), which then restarts the brain. It often is of great help for many people with any kind of brain abnormality, since the ""clean reinstall"" is not unlike making a PC run smoother if it's been running too long with spyware (pun unintended) and malware, and as the brain starts again, the person essentially feels new. There are other details about it, but the bottom line is that ECT does not suck and does not cause violent convulsions. Nor is the inpatient unit of any psychiatric treatment center particularly unpleasant (I've done my share of work in those units, and believe it or not, it's meant to be a beneficial and healing environment, which it often is.)So that's two counts of simply ""making stuff up"" for the sake of drama. So does this film have any saving graces? Sure, Russel Crowe is a damned good actor, and for the script he was handed, he pulled it off beautifully. He essentially only needed to act the part the screenwriters and director had almost completely fabricated, though he wasn't allowed to actually portray schizophrenia in general with virtually any accuracy. Nash alone did not have hallucinations nearly this bad, but the vast majority of people suffering with schizophrenia don't have visual hallucinations. Those that do often see ""apparitions"", if they're people, or they see and feel strange things such as their bed comforter turning into snakes, or metal, or insects, for a few examples of many. That's in the absolute worst cases of schizophrenia, which is in itself a rare condition, and an even rarer subgroup have hallucinations besides auditory.So...Where does that leave us? Well, it left me in a state of near-stupor as I watched a complete fabrication of some new John Nash who is absolutely nothing like his real self combined with a portrayal of schizophrenia that was wildly inaccurate, along with the mental health field that, as is often the case, treated like it's a medieval torture that should be avoided.Well, in that case, the story of John Nash is false, the stories of schizophrenia and mental illness in general are false, and the message the entire film gives is astronomically destructive: Schizophrenia (or any chronic mental illness) can be cured...through talking them out of it. Which has never worked in the history of time, because that's the equivalent of talking someone out of a heart attack. There is no fundamental difference in practicality there, though the former is simply destructive. But Crowe at least entertains us with his goofy shenanigans, so that's why the Academy gave him the Oscar. Good for him, but boo to the screenwriters and director who didn't have the guts to portray him accurately, which was not impossible and would have made for a more interesting film, really. There's no rule that says the main character has to be likable for the movie to be enjoyed. Then again, Crash, the most racist movie I've ever seen since about the '70s began, also won Best Picture, and that, too, was the exact opposite of reality in favor of something that, well, fished for Oscars.So, if you don't mind throwing reality, John Nash's actual life, and the nature of chronic mental illness into the trash bin and just want to watch a fantasy character make his way almost comically into a maniacally stupid forced ending, then I guess...Actually, no, don't watch it.

The impressiveness of Nash's achievement is all the more impressive by his dealing honestly with schizophrenia that is presented in this fim with a refreshing respect. The film's acting is numbing, from Russell Crowe's Oscar-nominated depiction of Nash's battles with the demonic delusions his condition creates, to Jennifer Connelly's Oscar turn as Crowe's faithful and supportive wife. Crowe, however, is astonishing, projecting a character he has seldom, if ever, portrayed before, and we develop a deep respect for the actor's versatility. As Oscar's Best Director, Howard earned the award by managing to pull off the message, through Nash's struggle, that the human spirit can deal with, if not overcome altogether, the hell that is schizophrenia without medication. It is a respectful treatment of the mental illness, and the film, propelled by Howard's sensitivity to its subject and Crowe's moving portrayal of it, is a profound experience. In the end, we cannot help but appreciate the fragility of life and be inspired by the iron will of the human spirit. It is a magnificent achievement!",4,An inspirational hope,1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,1593,"['respectful', 'disagreement', 'critics', 'who', 'panned', 'Ron', 'Howard-directed', 'biopic', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'little', 'wonder', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'collected', 'four', 'Oscars', 'one', 'Best', 'Picture', 'respectful', 'inspirational', 'message', 'recovery', 'hellish', 'demons', 'schizophrenia', 'possible', 'human', 'spirit', 'strong', 'enough', 'subject', 'here', 'Nobel', 'prize-winning', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash', 'theories', 'went', 'figure', 'dominantly', 'ecomonic', 'policy', 'development', 'impressiveness', 'Nash', 'achievement', 'more', 'impressive', 'dealing', 'honestly', 'schizophrenia', 'presented', 'fim', 'refreshing', 'respect', 'film', 'acting', 'numbing', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Oscar-nominated', 'depiction', 'Nash', 'battles', 'demonic', 'delusions', 'condition', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Oscar', 'turn', 'Crowe', 'faithful', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Crowe', 'however', 'astonishing', 'projecting', 'character', 'seldom', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'develop', 'deep', 'respect', 'actor', 'versatility', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director', 'Howard', 'earned', 'award', 'managing', 'pull', 'off', 'message', 'Nash', 'struggle', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'deal', 'not', 'overcome', 'altogether', 'hell', 'schizophrenia', 'medication', 'respectful', 'treatment', 'mental', 'illness', 'film', 'propelled', 'Howard', 'sensitivity', 'subject', 'Crowe', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'profound', 'experience', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'appreciate', 'fragility', 'life', 'be', 'inspired', 'iron', 'will', 'human', 'spirit', 'magnificent', 'achievement']",N/A

(One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)Add some classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins, and the film is even better. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye.

Jennifer Connelly well deserved her oscar.  She was stunning as usual and she was well matched with Russell since the two of them steal every scene they embody.  This is just a great film, period.

He finds it, and ends up working as a teacher/informant kinda sorta for the government, making frequent trips to the pentagon.  He meets and falls in love with a student (Connoly) and they are married and soon she is pregnant.  That's when things get hard.  Nash gets a little paranoid beliveing the Russians are trying to kill him.  Soon he is in the hospital undergoing some primative electric-type therapy to cure him of his mental state.

Crowe manages to portay it with the minimum of mannerisms.  To Crowe's credit, Nash is not an entirely sympathetic character here.  There are also clever devises employed by Howard and Goldsman to portray schizophrenia that I will not reveal here that are quite effective.

You do the math.2) The makeup in the final scenes of the film is really bad.

Ron Howard is a great director in that he knows how to manipulate his audience well. Only in the case of this film, he may have done it in such a way that some may find the end result to be insulting to their intelligence.4) The performances, while not bad, certainly aren't as spectacular as the reviews would have you believe. Jennifer Connelly is playing Jennifer Connelly - and Crowe's west virginia accent sounds like what an Australian's approximation of a West Virginia accent would sound like.5) The writing is rather bland. The film's reveal seems set up for the maximum effect, not to serve the plot.

He convincingly portrayed math genius John Nash, an oddball who sank deep into schizophrenia. His wife, well played by Jennifer Connelly helps, see him through his disease as he overcomes it, becoming a Nobel Prize winner for his &quot;game theory.&quot; Director Ron Howard gets us into Nash's mind as he is having his delusions and, therby lies one problem with this movie: you cannot get into someone's mind. The depiction of Nash's delusions, of necessity, must be somewhat fictional.There are a number of other areas where facts have been skirted. First, the movie depicts Nash getting married and becoming a father. We don't find out that Nash already had a son through an earlier affair with another woman. Secondly, Nash's wife is an extraordinary woman who exhibited great stregnth but, she got divorced from Nash (and later they remarried). Again, the movie does not depict this. Thirdly, Nash shared the Nobel Prize, i.e., he was a cowinner. From the movie you would get the impression that he was the sole winner. Fourth, the movie depicts a tradition at Princeton where estemed elders of the math department are honored in a ceremony in which their colleagues present them with pens. There is no such tradition at Princeton. Finally, Nash makes a moving speech when he receives his award. However, the Nobel Prize is not an academy award .. there is no speech given by winners.This movie is very moving and it helps us to get to know the story of John Nash. And, indeed, it is a wonderful story. However, when a movie distorts the truth, no matter how good the movie, I knock off a star in my review thus, four stars for an otherwise superb effort by director Ron Howard.",4,"Excellent, enthralling movie but plays loose with the facts",1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,1775,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'math', 'genius', 'John', 'Nash', 'oddball', 'who', 'sank', 'deep', 'schizophrenia', 'wife', 'well', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'see', 'disease', 'becoming', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'quot', 'game', 'theory.', 'quot', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Nash', 'mind', 'having', 'delusions', 'therby', 'one', 'problem', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'someone', 'mind', 'depiction', 'Nash', 'delusions', 'necessity', 'must', 'be', 'somewhat', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'areas', 'where', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'skirted', 'First', 'movie', 'Nash', 'getting', 'married', 'becoming', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'Nash', 'already', 'had', 'son', 'earlier', 'affair', 'woman', 'Secondly', 'Nash', 'wife', 'extraordinary', 'woman', 'who', 'exhibited', 'great', 'stregnth', 'got', 'divorced', 'Nash', 'later', 'remarried', 'Again', 'movie', 'not', 'depict', 'Thirdly', 'Nash', 'shared', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'i.e.', 'was', 'cowinner', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'impression', 'was', 'sole', 'winner', 'Fourth', 'movie', 'tradition', 'Princeton', 'where', 'estemed', 'elders', 'math', 'department', 'are', 'honored', 'ceremony', 'colleagues', 'present', 'pens', 'such', 'tradition', 'Princeton', 'Finally', 'Nash', 'moving', 'speech', 'when', 'award', 'However', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'not', 'academy', 'award', '..', 'speech', 'given', 'winners.This', 'movie', 'very', 'moving', 'get', 'know', 'story', 'John', 'Nash', 'indeed', 'wonderful', 'story', 'However', 'when', 'movie', 'truth', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'knock', 'off', 'star', 'review', 'thus', 'four', 'stars', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'effort', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard']",N/A
590484,ALD327BR0VOGQ,B00005JKQZ,David Gottner,"[2, 5]","This film takes up the story of Dr. John Forbes Nash Jr. from his days of graduate school at Princeton up to the year 1994 when he received the Nobel prize for economics.  I enjoyed this film immensely, despite its flaws.The first part of the film shows Nash during his graduate days, and it is the lightest part of the film.  We see Nash use mathematical talk in daily life with humorous results, such as when he tries to pick up a girl at a bar by suggesting that they ""exchange bodily fluids.""  He is so tactless that it is actually a bit funny, such as when he tells someone at a coctail party in a flat voice, ""I've read your papers, and  I'm convinced there isn't an original idea in any of them.""  This section of the movie closes with an explanation of the idea that eventually earned Nash the Nobel.The film moves on to his professorship at MIT and his courtship with one of his students (Alicia Larde) whom he later marries.  All of this is the calm before the storm.Next we see his world crumble around him as he becomes convinced that he is a secret agent working to uncover a dreadful communist plot.  He is diagnosed with paranoid schitzophrenia and committed to a mental hospital, and we follow his release and continuing struggle with the illness up to his eventual recovery.The film succeeds as a look at the life of John Nash.  John's delusions are portrayed as though they are real events which is effective because we can understand John's motivations for all of his actions.  His moody and sometimes violent behavior are perfectly rational given his understanding of the world.  If the treatment somehow glorifies schitzophrenia, that is also somehow appropriate sinse Nash stated that one of his hurtles to recovery was the relative lack of excitement in ""ordinary"" reality.On a deeper level the film works as a piece of wisdom that is more universally applicable, as a study of integrating the mind and emotions to become a more balanced human being, and on learning how to turn off that damnable inner critic that most of us possess (though not to a delusional degree for most people.)  It is for the universal nature of the film that I give it high marks.The film has flaws which prevent a 5 star review.  The biggest glaring problem is that Alicia is portrayed as the faithful wife who truly lives her vow to love her husband ""in sickness and in health.""  In reality, Alicia eventually divorced her husband when it became clear that he was not going to recover.  The couple eventually got back together several years after Nash recovered, though they never remarried.Also, Nash was a mathematical genius during his entire lifetime, and the film falsely portrays otherwise, hinting that he came up with one great result that bagged him the Nobel and then slipped into madness never to publish again.  There's a scene where he states that he ""is working on the Riemann hypothesis"" but we never see anything completed.  In reality, Nash solved a complex problem in topology which was probably his most brilliant idea, and did other work in partial differential equations.  The film could have taken some time to explore the topological result, explaining the essense in non-mathematical language, similiar to its treatment of his game theoretic result.Finally the score is rather lackluster.

Can take a great, cool story, and load it with triteness and cliche-ridden cinematics, pacing, and story.I was quite excited to see this movie when I bought it - I knew it was about a famous mathematician, that it had won awards (or been nominated, anyway), and I like movies and plays about math and science. And lest you think I didn't like this because it was ron howard, I didn't know it was Ron Howard when I watched it.  After watching this and feeling that I had been taken for a ride, with every emotional response I'm supposed to have being telecasted to me through script and music (like a Spielberg movie but without the artistry), and being taken so far from reality, I and my friend who watched it together felt abused and misled.""Who directed this thing?"" I asked. ""Ah - Ron Howard. That explains why this movie, which has a great and compelling human story underlying it and could have really been a greaet movie that people would watch over time, sucks.""Though I give it two stars, let me give 5 stars to the cast - incredible acting, especially from Russel Crowe. Ed Harris great as always. Rest of the cast, brilliant. This movie has some tremendous acting. It's just too bad that Mr. Howard felt the need to manipulate us, tell us what to feel and think, and tug at the emotional heartstrings intentionally, instead of letting the story itself do that for us.The story of a person's life, told truthfully and accurately, without manipulation, is *far* more compelling than any fictional story we could think to invent, and certainly far more interesting than taking a person's story and adding in some fictional components to make it ""sell"" to the movie public. Sorry, but the movie public just ends up feeling abused. Nash's story could be told on grainy black and white film, with the same cast, but with no special effects, and audience would be riveted, because Nash's story *itself* is riveting.Please stop adding fiction to real-life stories; please stop manipulating the viewers, Mr. Howard.On the DVD itself: 3 or 4 stars for the DVD.

And here is where this movie runs into its first real problem, one it never overcomes. If you're going to describe the life of a genius, you have to show us why he's a genius. The movie instead spends literally 30 seconds on what game theory is and then rushes back to scenes of him writing mathematical squiggles on windows and chalk boards. I'm sorry, this is not good enough. The director is so keen to show us a highly fictionalised and lurid account of Nash's descent into schizophrenia that the main reason we care about the guy (he's a mathematical genius, after all) ends up totally forgotten. I wish I'd read the book on which this is based before I saw the film, since many of the imagined scenes are quite ludicrous. Although I concede it's not easy to show what schizophrenia is like, there must have been better ways of describing it that this. We are treated to endless bizarre dreamlike scenes involving Russian nuclear bombs and Nash's imaginary mysterious spy boss who asks him to carry out ever more maniacal tasks. This all makes for very uncomfortable viewing and worse, it doesn't teach us anything. Nor do we learn why Nash suddenly returned to a state bordering on normality and how he came to be awarded the Nobel Prize. The film omits to mention he fathered a child before he met his wife and doesn't tell us she left him for several years.

The John Nash brilliantly portrayed by Russell Crowe is nowhere near as complex and interesting as the actual man.  The excuse that they must leave certain aspects out due to time limitations does not suffice.  Did the marketing executives have too power over the final cut?  If so, what were they thinking?  A film such as this one is likely to attract only those sophisticated enough to easily handle the more controversial aspects of Nash's life.Still, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is worth seeing.  Russell Crowe, as a genius suffering from the mental disease of schizophrenia, has earned another Academy Award nomination, and reminds us once again that he may be the greatest male film actor of our time.  I am simply in awe regarding his stupendous ability to truly get under the skin of his character.  Many other actors essentially play the same role over and over.  In Crowe's case, though, each movie is a special treat and a journey into the unknown.  Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife is beautiful to look, but I sense that the real Alicia Nash is quite a bit different in person.  Paul Bettany and Ed Harris are challenged to play the parts of men who are imaginary.  They succeed admirably, and provide another reason to view this film.  Congratulations are also in order for the efforts of both Judd Hirsh and Christopher Plummer.  The cast selections were near perfect, and visually &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; captures the era between the 1950s and the year when Nash won the Nobel Prize.This movie doesn't deserve five stars, but I have no hesitation in giving it four.

The bulk of this film covers the time between Nash's arrival on the Princeton campus to the discovery of his illness at M.I.T, but the power of the movie is fully realized during his struggle to overcome his illness and reclaim the greatness that once resided in his mind.I can't say enough about Russell Crowe's performance - nothing in his &quot;Gladiator&quot; performance comes close to what he achieves here.  As for Ron Howard, he deserves kudos as well for his sensitive direction - even though the audience is likely to shed tears, Howard never goes for the sentimental.  Howard expresses this story with hard, direct camera shots that never flinch from the pain of Nash's distress.  The screenplay takes huge liberties with the real story.  For example, Princeton professors do not offer their pens as homage to a colleague, nor did Nash's illness manifest itself in the way presented (he heard voices).  No matter, though.  Film making is an art form in which visual statements are made.  Without such changes, this story would not have the same visceral power.Because I live near Princeton, where this film opened in limited release, I saw A Beautiful Mind in an audience familiar with the campus, its traditions, and the story of Nash.  Despite the obvious liberties director Ron Howard took with some of the scenes, I could tell that the rest of the audience,like me, didn't care because Howard captured the spirit of the story.See this film for both the story and the acting.

590491,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JKQZ,Deborah Earle,"[10, 12]","Ron Howard's direction of ""A Beautiful Mind"" is much like that of ""The Sixth Sense"" in that it is only much later in the film that we see certain realities of the main character's world for what they are.It does lose points with me, however, for not portraying certain aspects of John Nash's life accurately. Ignored, for example, is the fact that his wife, the initially spunky and forceful, Alicia, is El Salvadorian, and while Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of her was well-done, she could have adopted a more Spanish-sounding accent for the part.While a bit beefy for the lead role, Russell Crowe submerges himself nicely into the character of the eccentric, socially inept John Nash, complete with a Southern twang. The film features the usual cornerstones of a Crowe performance: Displays of brute strength, moments of violent rage, pensive charm, subtle glances from his very expressive heavily-lashed blue-green eyes, quick and pleasant witticisms, a wry smile, and of course, his excerising his ""right to bare arms"", that last of which should keep the ladies interested.The story of course, revolves around Professor Nash's bout with schizophrenia, his major contribution to the world despite his illness, and his ultimate triumph as a Nobel Laurate.We first meet Nash as a loner at Princeton University about to work on his thesis, but not succeeding at doing so at first. There isn't too much emphasis on math itself, the least favorite subject of many of us in school, which was perhaps done to keep most of the audience interested in the film. But the palpable distance between Nash and the elderly faculty member being honored by the ceremony of the pens can be measured in light years, as Nash stands in the hallway, a lone and solitary figure once again on the outside.His life is made even more complicated by his roommate (Paul Bettany) and his roommate's adoptive niece who never ages(Vivien Cardone), as well as Government agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who never changes his clothes.Christopher Plummer's Dr. Rosen appears on the scene to treat Nash, giving a calm intellectual, but slightly smug performance as the once esteemed Professor falls from grace and into his care.The scene on Nash's recipience of shock treatment is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's undergoing the same procedure in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". But while there is debate about how meticulouslyschizophrenia and the events of Nash's life are portrayed (his otherwise unmentioned son, whom he had out of wedlock plays an orderly in the film), Crowe makes Nash a very sympathetic character, and perhaps the film has led more people to empathize with the plight of the mentally ill.We feel somehow, that Alicia was meant to be the guiding force in his life, although in reality, the couple were divorced for a time.Later in the movie, there is another pens ceremony, but happily Nash is not at a distance from it this time.The make-up job of the Nashes as an elderly couple could have been better. But Nash's address of the Nobel Academy, which in fact never happened, gives the film a final, romantic flourish.The stately and haunting anthem sung by Charlotte Church is one of vigilance on behalf of those in need of guidance.While sparing us many gritty realities of the Nashes' life together, Ron Howard's movie is one of hope and triumph, with only a muted kind of joy because despite Nash's great achievements, the battle for sanity continues.",4,"Solemn, Haunting, Well-Directed",1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,3451,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'direction', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'much', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'only', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'see', 'certain', 'realities', 'main', 'character', 'world', 'what', 'are.It', 'lose', 'points', 'however', 'not', 'portraying', 'certain', 'aspects', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'accurately', 'Ignored', 'example', 'fact', 'wife', 'initially', 'spunky', 'forceful', 'Alicia', 'El', 'Salvadorian', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'portrayal', 'was', 'well-done', 'could', 'have', 'adopted', 'more', 'Spanish-sounding', 'accent', 'part.While', 'bit', 'beefy', 'lead', 'role', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'nicely', 'character', 'eccentric', 'socially', 'inept', 'John', 'Nash', 'complete', 'Southern', 'twang', 'film', 'usual', 'cornerstones', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'Displays', 'brute', 'strength', 'moments', 'violent', 'rage', 'pensive', 'charm', 'subtle', 'glances', 'very', 'expressive', 'heavily-lashed', 'blue-green', 'eyes', 'quick', 'pleasant', 'witticisms', 'wry', 'smile', 'course', 'excerising', 'right', 'bare', 'arms', 'last', 'should', 'keep', 'ladies', 'interested.The', 'story', 'course', 'Professor', 'Nash', 'bout', 'schizophrenia', 'major', 'contribution', 'world', 'illness', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'Nobel', 'Laurate.We', 'first', 'Nash', 'loner', 'Princeton', 'University', 'work', 'thesis', 'not', 'succeeding', 'doing', 'so', 'first', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'math', 'least', 'favorite', 'subject', 'many', 'school', 'was', 'perhaps', 'done', 'keep', 'most', 'audience', 'interested', 'film', 'palpable', 'distance', 'Nash', 'elderly', 'faculty', 'member', 'being', 'honored', 'ceremony', 'pens', 'can', 'be', 'measured', 'light', 'years', 'Nash', 'hallway', 'lone', 'solitary', 'figure', 'once', 'again', 'outside.His', 'life', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'roommate', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'roommate', 'adoptive', 'niece', 'who', 'never', 'Vivien', 'Cardone', 'as', 'well', 'Government', 'agent', 'William', 'Parcher', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'never', 'clothes.Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Dr.', 'Rosen', 'scene', 'treat', 'Nash', 'giving', 'calm', 'intellectual', 'slightly', 'smug', 'performance', 'once', 'esteemed', 'Professor', 'grace', 'care.The', 'scene', 'Nash', 'recipience', 'shock', 'treatment', 'reminiscent', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'undergoing', 'same', 'procedure', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'debate', 'how', 'meticulouslyschizophrenia', 'events', 'Nash', 'life', 'are', 'portrayed', 'otherwise', 'unmentioned', 'son', 'whom', 'had', 'wedlock', 'plays', 'orderly', 'film', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'perhaps', 'film', 'led', 'more', 'people', 'empathize', 'plight', 'mentally', 'ill.We', 'feel', 'somehow', 'Alicia', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'guiding', 'force', 'life', 'reality', 'couple', 'were', 'divorced', 'time.Later', 'movie', 'pens', 'ceremony', 'happily', 'Nash', 'not', 'distance', 'time.The', 'make-up', 'job', 'Nashes', 'elderly', 'couple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Nash', 'address', 'Nobel', 'Academy', 'fact', 'never', 'happened', 'film', 'final', 'romantic', 'flourish.The', 'stately', 'haunting', 'anthem', 'sung', 'Charlotte', 'Church', 'one', 'vigilance', 'behalf', 'need', 'guidance.While', 'sparing', 'many', 'gritty', 'realities', 'Nashes', 'life', 'together', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'movie', 'one', 'hope', 'triumph', 'only', 'muted', 'kind', 'joy', 'Nash', 'great', 'achievements', 'battle', 'sanity']",N/A

It is so rich in textures, a once in a lifetime, brilliant performance from Russell Crowe, with understated, deft direction by Ron Howard, a light dance of inspiration that so rarely comes out of Hollywood. Opee you done well!The power and emotion of this film, Russell's magick, is often nearly overwhelming. Few films affect you as deeply. The tale captures your from the start, gently rapping its hand around your heart and keeping you in thrall, as you follow the spiralling brilliance of genius on the edge of madness. Howard walks the tight rope, never fully revealing the cards he hold, keeping the viewer so convinced that these things are actually happening, though the other characters are telling you it was all in Crowe's mind. It gives you an unique position of 'experiencing' Crowe's delusions, so we more fully understand that delusions can be frighteningly as real as life. Instead of telling you this man suffers from schizophrenia, Howard and Crowe make 'your walk a mile in Nash's shoes', thus making your, for the first time, really comprehend what this disease does to the mind. How despite this all, Nash went on to win a Noble prize so this is a story of personal triumph.Nash, an off the IQ chart mathematician, a socially inept Southern, is pulled into the superspy world by Ed Harris' William Parcher, who claims he is US government agent and needs Nash's unique talents. Christopher Plummer, another brilliant (but overlooked actor) actor gives to the link into reality, for both Nash and the audience, as Dr. Rosen, who treats Nash. Jennifer Connelly's performance as Nash's funny and loving wife, demonstrated a broader range of talent than we have seen from her; amazing to see the little girl who danced with Bowie all grown up and proving she is much more than a pretty face.Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and all well earned.

590494,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JKQZ,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 9]","This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography.  It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University.  A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor.  To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices.  The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience.  So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside.  The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience.  Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details.  I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach.  But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography.  I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous).  Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy.  Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally.  If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections.  Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed.  It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience.  While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances.  The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie.""  There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market.  If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another.  Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000).  Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship.  I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie.  Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.",5,Excellent

590499,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKQZ,D. Litton,"[8, 17]","&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; proves just how much effective performances can carry a movie. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are the centerpiece of this biopic of John Forbes Nash, Jr, and throughout the movie's entire, they remain as such, due to the fact that director Ron Howard doesn't seem to have a knack for giving the film a steady pace.This is a shame, given the incredible acting on the part of Crowe, who plays Nash's paranoia and delusional schizophrenia in a most moving fashion. Beginning with his years at Princeton University, we bear witness to Nash's constant roaming of his mind to try and come up with something original and important that will scribe his name in history. His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), urges him to get out more, to get to know the people he goes to school with, but Nash presses on until he comes up with the paper that gets him the credentials he needs to go anywhere in life.After attaining a professorship at MIT, things are going well for him, until he crosses paths with William Parcher (Ed Harris), a government official who warns him of a Russian conspiracy that hopes to smuggle a portable nuclear weapon into the country. As he explains it, there are spies working within the United States, and communication among their network depends on secret codes and messages embedded within the articles of newspapers and periodicals. Nash, who rises to the challenge of cracking these codes, takes on the top-secret assignment.Up to this point, Howard has done well to set up Nash's life in a manner that keeps us wanting to know more about him. His years at Princeton contain a variety of uplifting and downtrodden moments, and his government assignment carries with it a sinister, unknown element that sets up the film's second half. Nash's marriage to Alicia, while making him the happiest man on earth, throws a wrench in Parcher's plans, as Nash's married life and his forthcoming child requires more of his attention. He begins warning Nash that Russian spies are on the lookout for him; later, at a math conference at Princeton, he is taken away by strange men, all the while screaming for help in vain.At this turn of events, the film becomes a powerful one, creating a very unsettling atmosphere that brings home the reality of schizophrenic delusions with effective results. The government assignment, Parcher, Charles and his young niece... all the figments of Nash's vivid and often nightmarish imagination. The men he believes to be the Russian spies he was warned about are, in reality, psychiatrists trying to calm the storm of his mind, while Alicia remains hopeful yet suspicious of her husband's stability.Despite Ron Howard's camera trickery and treatment of Nash's delusions, Crowe's acting is the life force of his character's situation. The fact that life as he knows it has been called into question is very disturbing, and watching him hold onto these visions is even more tense. Crowe is able to portray Nash in such a way that we feel a great deal of emotion for him, and care for him enough to want to see him reach a certain sense of stability in life.Jennifer Connelly, relatively unknown to most until this film, portrays Alicia Nash with the caring and supportive nature that is needed to balance her character's feelings of devotion with the unbearable need to break free. Her acting is strong and able, and when crossed with that of her costar, the two become the life force of the film, the source of all things important to the story.All of this is put into extreme jeopardy, however, by Howard's inadequate pacing and awkward directing, keeping the film slow and melodramatic in places where it should be concise and intense. The entire movie is cast in a drab cloud of slow movement that is almost aggravating, threatening to bring down the film's many touching moments. Much of the second and final thirds is crammed with confrontations between Nash and his mind's eye, instead of developing his willpower as he struggles to recover without the help of medication. While this is a heartwarming move on the part of Nash, the film rushes it far too much, and lessens the impact in doing so.In the end, just as its main character, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; wins over its obstacles to become a better-than-average biopic with some very influential and touching moments, crowned by stunning performances from its two shimmering leads. It's a tearjerker that doesn't evoke too many sniffles, unfortunately, due to our growing sense of disinterest as a result of its deliberately slow pacing.

Second, all of the Hollywood embellishments in this film had to be dismissed as inconsequential to the overall magnitude of the story--a story about a very real man with a very real illness.And it is here--the story--that A BEAUTIFUL MIND excels.

And thus the distinction between reality and illusion becomes blurred, a disturbing development that leads to complete dysfunction.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is not true to Nash's life in every way, making him to appear a better person than he was in real life. However, as a portrayal of schizophrenia and how it affects the mind, it is most compelling. One of its most outstanding features is that it presents what is happening from the perspective of Nash himself, so that for a time we are not sure whether what we are observing (through his eyes) is fact or fiction. This is especially true of the characters in the movie who turn out to be nothing more than products of his mind. Is his grad school roommate real? How about the little girl he befriends? And then what about the conspiracy that he thinks he is tracking? At first we are even taken in by this. Seldom has schizophrenia been portrayed as realistically as it is in this film.We also see the importance of having a community of people who are willing to accept the schizophrenic person. His wife, his colleagues, and his students are all supportive and certainly instrumental in his ability to function at a high level despite his debilitating illness.Russell Crowe does an outstanding job of portraying Nash, as does Jennifer Connelly his wife.

I remember sitting in the theatre in complete confusion thru portions of the film.  The confusion, however, was finally replaced by the realization of what the makers of this movie were trying to do.The 3 imagined characters were pure fiction and much of the movie was highly fabricated.  The film also entirely omitted the object of Nash's first affair, Eleanor, as well as the son he fathered by her, John David.As all good movies do, this film had its reasons for proceeding thus.  The story is about Nash's courtship and marriage of Alicia.  It was during this period in his life that he experienced his biggest bouts with mental illness, which is also central to the theme.  To have included Eleanor and John David would have made the movie much longer and the film would have lost its focus.As for Nash's illness itself, to give an accurate account would have made the film wander about without any real direction (which is exactly what Nash himself DID do for several years).  The 3 fictional characters are installed to bring the film a cohesive plot as well as a storyline with a considerable degree of symmetry.Ron Howard does an outstanding job directing this film.  The cast, featuring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Jennifer Connoley, is magnificent.  Particularly impressive is Crowe as this role is so very different from his notable performance in GLADIATOR.This is a film that I would recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection.  Movies about the lives of atheletes are commonplace, but films that detail the stories of intellectuals are exceedingly scarce.  For that reason alone, I would admonish all persons to watch this movie.Ultimately, this movie is a REPRESENTATION of Nash's life as opposed to a glossing over of actual events.

Necessarily simplified from the biography of mathematician John Nash, this film achieves dramatic pace and structure that has no analogue in the life of even some of the most extraordinary individuals suffering from such a condition.Setting aside the fact that Ron Howard's work is not true to the nominal subject of the movie, however, this film comes laudably close to a good clinical depiction of the desperate vividness of the auditory and visual hallucinations suffered by patients with schizophrenia, including the sort of elaborate structures of delusion which the more intelligent individual has been known to develop.I would wish that Howard and his associates had managed to portray something more of the adverse effects of the drugs available to treat schizophrenia in the '50s and '60s.  Indeed, I would've liked to have seen Russell Crowe add to his superb performance some intimation of these harrowing elements so that the audience could better understand the pharmacotherapeutic factors that drove Nash to discontinue his neuroleptic medications and undertake what is essentially self-directed cognitive therapy in order to address his thought disorder.  Even the more recently-developed ""atypical"" antipsychotic medicines have pretty nasty side effects, and we are far from perfection in the medical management of schizophrenia today.This is in no way a perfect movie, certainly.  It is, however, good art, and we owe the makers of this film our thanks for helping increase the general public awareness of thought disorders.

The movie comes from the professor's perspective in the first person and you see first hand what a paranoid-schizophrenic individual experiences on a daily basis.Having spent more than a decade as a former psychologist specializing in the mental health sector, I have often imagined what it would be like to be inside the mind of one of my many clients who suffered from this horrible mental illness. ""A Beautiful Mind"" portrays what I envisioned. It's hard for most of us who have never had a psychosis to understand what is wrong with individuals like this. If you want a dose of experience, view this flick! Keep in mind that this professor (portrayed by Crowe) is considered a higher functioning paranoid-schizophrenic because his intelligence is outstanding. What many do not understand is that in most cases, it takes a very creative and intelligent mind to become schizophrenic.Now, the movie does a beautiful job of portraying the life of this professor, but from my understanding, there were various liberties taken in the film. That's too bad, but I'm not judging the movie based upon its authenticity as much as I am with the final outcome of just the movie itself. So, I'll not base my ratings on that aspect.What stops me from giving a full five stars is the acting job Crowe does. Don't get me wrong, he did most everything right that I can think of. However, he plays a southern gentleman (West Virginian if I am correct) and his accent suffers. Since he is Australian, I think he did quite an admirable job at trying to sound southern, but it detracted from the movie a bit too much as if it were forced. I might have gotten a different actor for the part to make it more authentic, but of course, Crowe is big time right now so I understand their decision.Regardless, get the DVD.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[7, 11]","John Forbes Nash was a genius who came up with an original mathematical idea (Nash's Equilibrium) that eventually won him a Nobel Prize. In this movie, loosely based on Sylvia Nasar's biography (also called ""A Beautiful Mind,"") Russell Crowe plays the troubled mathematician to perfection. Jennifer Connelly turns in a moving performance as Nash's long-suffering wife, Alicia.Nash is a shy and eccentric undergraduate at Princeton when we first meet him. He seems out of step socially, but he is always thinking about new ways to tackle mathematical problems. Although he does come up with an original idea which brings him the fame he has always wanted, he does not get to enjoy the fruits of his efforts for very long. John Forbes Nash is suffering from a severe mental illness and it eventually takes over his life.Crowe and director Ron Howard effectively demonstrate the insidious nature of Nash's illness. Connelly, as Alicia, wants to be a supportive and loving wife, but she eventually realizes that she does not have the power to heal John. However, she doesn't withdraw her love from John, and Nash relies on Alicia as he struggles to regain his sanity.Much has been made about the fact that the movie distorts Nash's life, omitting certain important facts and distorting others. This is a valid criticism, but Howard never claimed that he was making a documentary. He admits freely in a disclaimer that this movie is based on Nash's life; it is not meant to be a literal accounting of everything that Nash did. As a searing character study of a man who was both creative and unwittingly self-destructive, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is unforgettable.

But he made two gargantuan missteps in the form on EDTV and The Grinch, both of which were exceedingly mediocre.  I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of Jennifer Connolly and Russell Crowe always seems to give a magnificent performance.  And I wasn't disappointed, Russell gives another great performance as troubled genius John Nash, and Jennifer Connolly more than acts with him as his wife.  This movie is definitely Ron Howards best work.  It is very mainstream, it's view of schizophrenia is subdued, there is no visual screwing around in the form of quick cuts and insane visual tricks to involve one in Nash's world.  It wasn't what I expected and I was refreshed to see a straight-forward depiction of schizophrenia.  It also has those little scenes that stay in my memory and really struck a chord.  The scene involving the garbageman was definitely one of them.  But that said, this view of schizophrenia is probably the main problem with the film.  I doubt schizophrenia is as simple as ignoring your visions, it's a little more complicated than that I would surmise.  It bothered me, but not enough for me not to recommend the film.

You read reviews and the side articles, and an image appears in your mind as to what you are about to see even before you see it.  You read how much of the movie is fiction.  You read (and read and read) articles about how Russell Crowe is such a jerk.  And then you actually see the movie.With all the above baggage, there is added about halfway through the film a turn that throws you for a loop.  Not exactly the same way as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot;, but the same in the sense that you are jolted into rethinking what you have been shown.  Unlike those other two movies, where the shockers are at the end, and it explains everything, in this movie, it appears in the middle.  You now have the rest of the movie to decide if you've been cheated.  Without revealing anything, I'll say, like the other two movies, all the clues are there if you've paid attention.So I liked it for that, and I liked it for the performances.

When he regains his prestige, however, he descends into another kind of hell, and it's not so much the descent as the recovery that is heartwarming.  Once again, he finds he has to interact with other humans to truly find happiness.There is also a great supporting cast, especially Jennifer Connelly.  During the first part of the movie, there is nothing special there, but as Crowe's illness reaches dangerous levels, how she takes over is work that deserves the Oscar she got.

But if you want to learn about Nash the Nobel-winning mathematician, read the biography of the same title by Sylvia Nasar.I really enjoyed this movie in the theatre. Unfortunately, when I read Nash's biography, I realized just how much had been sacrificed to create this tale of one man's triumph over madness. Nash's bisexuality, his earlier relationship and illegitimate son, his years of estrangement from Alicia, the combination of paranoid and megalomaniacal delusions that characterized the full-blown stages of his illness and the solid work he accomplished during treatment... all had been swept under the rug.

Russell Crowe gives his best peformace yet for a Golden Globe winning performance as John Nash, the nobel prize-winning schizophrenic math genius.  Crowe's brutally honest performance sheds some light on the often misunderstood disease.  I walked out of the theater in shock because of Russell Crowe's performance, it was truly touching.  Nash's wife is played flawlessly by a wondrful Jennifer Connelly.  Connelly brings genuine emotion and feeling into this key character.  Connelly's performance also snagged her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.  Ed Harris is also wondeful is his role.  I won't talk too much about Harris's role for fear of giving something away!  Akiva Goldsman's brilliant Golden Globe-winning screenplay has many of these sorts of surprises, twists and turns.Critically acclaimed director Ron Howard fills 'A Beautiful Mind' with geniune emotion and heart. I found myself personally touched by this film a number of times.  It's pretty shocking how heartwrenching 'A Beautiful Mind' is at times.  I found myself enveloped in tears along with my friends a number of times while watching this film.  If a film can touch you in the way that 'A Beautiful Mind' did for me, you know that it must be a wonderful film.  Fortunately, 'A Beautiful Mind' snagged the Best Drama award at the Golden Globes the other night beating out films such as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'In The Bedroom'.

590523,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JKQZ,Eric,"[2, 2]","A Beautiful Mind is not a great movie, certainly not 2001's best film, but it's a respectable effort from director Ron Howard, and especially writer Akiva Goldsman, who was partially responsible for the travesty that was Batman and Robin. This biographical drama focuses on the life of John Nash, the genius who developed a radical concept on game theory. I'd rather not say further about the story, since there's a big plot twist halfway through that definitely puts a spin on much of the material that came before it.As most have heard, A Beautiful Mind is largely inaccurate in its depiction of John Nash's life. Did I really care? Not particularly. I'd be a fool to expect a film based on facts to adhere entirely to the truth. Rather, I'm basing my opinion on how well-crafted the movie is, and how well it succeeded on what it was trying to be, that is, a film meant to inspire with its theme of love (and besides, I seriously doubt all the indiscretions of Nash's life would mesh well with that, so I'm wondering if the film's detractors really want to see all of Nash's odd behavior portrayed or if they're just looking for something to complain about). So how does this film come across as a feel good drama? Not bad.First off, I'd like to mention that Ron Howard's direction and Goldsman's screenwriting are easily the film's weakest points, and not deserving of the Oscars they received. As has been evident in previous works, Howard is not a master of subtlety, and as best as he tries, he obviously doesn't have a firm grasp of what's genuinely good drama. A lot of the film's emotional moments are overdone and pure Hollywood; there's typical shouting, crying, and glass-breaking, nothing I haven't seen before.  While I have a lot to complain about Howard's direction, he's fine when it comes to pacing and style, and yes, the film itself does look very lovely and polished.Definitely by far the film's weakest segment is in the last ten or so minutes, when we witness Nash age and receive his nobel prize. That alone doesn't sound so awful, but unfortunately, we get a speech that lamely hammers home the movie's message, that of how we must rely on emotion and love over cold intellect to solve our problems and survive in this world. It had already seemed obvious that was what the film had been striving to say throughout its rather lengthy running time, and I sure as hell didn't need Howard to blindly forcefeed the theme in such a manner.Since I've done nothing but complain up to this point, you might wonder why it is I consider this film above average. The answer's simple. This all works thanks to Russell Crowe as John Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, particularly the latter, who delivers a magnificent performance worthy of far more screen time (it's all the more disappointing to see that we never even find out what she does for a living, considering she was the one supporting Nash in his later, troubled years). Crowe is in very fine form in the lead, both sympathetic and likeable, though some of his tics seem more like obvious attempts at acting rather than genuine eccentric behavior.Schizophrenia is a disease that's dealt with in the film. I've never studied up much on it, though on my paltry knowledge alone, I probably know far more than most Hollywood (most often, as in the case with Me, Myself, and Irene, filmmakers seem to think schizophrenia is just another term for multiple identity disorder). (moderate spoiler) I don't know how accurate A Beautiful Mind's portrayal of this mental illness is, but the Nash in the movie hardly seems like a true ""loony,"" and the film makes the disease seem a bit easier to handle than it probably is (Nash sees a few people who aren't there, and at one point, even reasons that they can't be there). Much like the rest of the film, the handling of this topic feels Hollywood, but also like the rest of the film, it's handled competently and in a fairly riveting fasion.*** 1/2 out of *****",3,Better than average Hollywood drama.,1030320000,"08 26, 2002",2002,3980,"['Beautiful', 'Mind', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', '2001', 'best', 'film', 'respectable', 'effort', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'especially', 'writer', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'who', 'was', 'partially', 'responsible', 'travesty', 'was', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'biographical', 'drama', 'life', 'John', 'Nash', 'genius', 'who', 'developed', 'radical', 'concept', 'game', 'theory', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'say', 'further', 'story', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'halfway', 'definitely', 'spin', 'much', 'material', 'came', 'it.As', 'most', 'have', 'heard', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'largely', 'inaccurate', 'depiction', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'Did', 'really', 'care', 'Not', 'particularly', ""'d"", 'be', 'fool', 'expect', 'film', 'based', 'facts', 'adhere', 'entirely', 'truth', 'Rather', ""'m"", 'basing', 'opinion', 'how', 'well-crafted', 'movie', 'how', 'well', 'succeeded', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'film', 'meant', 'inspire', 'theme', 'love', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'indiscretions', 'Nash', 'life', 'would', 'mesh', 'well', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'film', 'detractors', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Nash', 'odd', 'behavior', 'portrayed', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'complain', 'how', 'film', 'come', 'feel', 'good', 'drama', 'Not', 'bad.First', 'off', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'direction', 'Goldsman', 'screenwriting', 'are', 'easily', 'film', 'weakest', 'points', 'not', 'deserving', 'Oscars', 'received', 'been', 'evident', 'previous', 'works', 'Howard', 'not', 'master', 'subtlety', 'as', 'best', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'firm', 'grasp', 'what', 'genuinely', 'good', 'drama', 'lot', 'film', 'emotional', 'moments', 'are', 'overdone', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'typical', 'shouting', 'crying', 'glass-breaking', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'have', 'lot', 'complain', 'Howard', 'direction', 'fine', 'when', 'pacing', 'style', 'yes', 'film', 'look', 'very', 'lovely', 'polished.Definitely', 'far', 'film', 'weakest', 'segment', 'last', 'ten', 'so', 'minutes', 'when', 'witness', 'Nash', 'age', 'receive', 'nobel', 'prize', 'alone', ""n't"", 'sound', 'so', 'awful', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'speech', 'lamely', 'home', 'movie', 'message', 'how', 'must', 'rely', 'emotion', 'love', 'cold', 'intellect', 'solve', 'problems', 'survive', 'world', 'had', 'already', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'was', 'what', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'striving', 'say', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'sure', 'hell', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Howard', 'blindly', 'forcefeed', 'theme', 'such', 'manner.Since', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nothing', 'complain', 'up', 'point', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'consider', 'film', 'average', 'answer', 'simple', 'thanks', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'John', 'Nash', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'wife', 'particularly', 'latter', 'who', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'worthy', 'far', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'disappointing', 'see', 'never', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'living', 'considering', 'was', 'one', 'supporting', 'Nash', 'later', 'troubled', 'years', 'Crowe', 'very', 'fine', 'form', 'lead', 'sympathetic', 'likeable', 'tics', 'seem', 'more', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'acting', 'rather', 'genuine', 'eccentric', 'behavior.Schizophrenia', 'disease', 'dealt', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'studied', 'up', 'much', 'though', 'paltry', 'knowledge', 'alone', 'probably', 'know', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'often', 'case', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'think', 'schizophrenia', 'just', 'term', 'multiple', 'identity', 'disorder', 'moderate', 'spoiler', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'portrayal', 'mental', 'illness', 'Nash', 'movie', 'hardly', 'true', 'loony', 'film', 'disease', 'seem', 'bit', 'easier', 'handle', 'probably', 'Nash', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'Much', 'rest', 'film', 'handling', 'topic', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'rest', 'film', 'handled', 'competently', 'fairly', 'riveting', 'fasion', '***', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

After seeing such brilliant films as DONNIE DARKO, MOULIN ROUGE, VANILLA SKY, LORD...RINGS, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, etc., I fail to understand why this film was nominated for anything.After seeing this film for the first time, I thought: &quot;Well... that was okay. What's for dinner?&quot;. The next day, I had a discussion with my aunt about the real John Nash. The more I learned, the more I disliked the film.I can't believe that Academy Award winner (?!) Akiva Goldsman has the guts to take a rather intruiging life story, butcher it, and candy-coat it to make a 'nice little movie'.If only Academy Award winner (?!) Ron Howard had made this a Rated R film and included the more intimate details of Nash's life, it would have been MUCH better.Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Ed Harris do their best with 2-dimensional characters. I'm glad that Denzel won the Oscar for his flawless performance in TRAINING DAY, for Russell Crowe's performance was too lumpy and inconsistent. And although she had a smaller part, I think that Marisa Tomei should have won the Oscar for IN THE BEDROOM. Jennifer Connelly is an outstanding actress (see REQUIEM FOR A DREAM), but she is given absolutely NOTHING to do here, except forward the plot. And finally, we have Ed Harris, who is stuck in a role that amounts to nothing.The biggest problem I had was not with the film but with the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts &amp; Sciences.  In March 2002, the Academy gave Ron Howard the Best Director Oscar statuette, when he clearly did not deserve it.  Consider the competition.  With GOSFORD PARK, Robert Altman successfully juggled 23 celebrated actors and created two equally vivid worlds: the British aristocrats and their servants.  With BLACK HAWK DOWN, Ridley Scott used his inventive genius to display the raw power of war.  With MULHOLLAND DRIVE, David Lynch made the audience feel as if they were in a sustained, surreal nightmare that they could not wake up from. And with THE LORD...RINGS and MOULIN ROUGE, Peter Jackson and Baz Luhrmann (whom, shockingly, did not even score a nomination) transport the viewers into worlds they have only dreamed of.  But, quite frankly, Howard's direction is very bland.  It is good, but there is nothing very special about it.  This is not to say, however, that Howard is not a great director.

Do you remember that you have been secretly in love with Jennifer Connelly for the last 15 years ? What have Ron Howard done to them ?The life of John Forbes Nash math genius and Nobel Prize gives Ron Howard the opportunity to deal again with the American positive values all of his movies (except maybe Ransom)are swimming in. So here we go again with the usual promotion of an ""Extraordinary Destiny of A Beautiful Mind"" that is supposed to wipe out all of the American doubts (yes they exist !). The life of John Forbes Nash could have been a paranoid tale and an allegoria of the life in America during Cold War and Mac Carthy. But no!, all those spies were just an allusion and after a small brain cleaning all is back in order !! And we can witness one of the scariest dialogue of the last 20 years (""Mac Carthy is stupid but he is not always wrong !"")Russel Crowe plays Nash from 1947 to 1994, from Princeton university to the Nobel Prize in 1994. Crowe's performance is absolutely dreadful and utterly ridiculous : he overplays the genius with a catastrophic plethora of mouth twistings and eyes clinchings.

590531,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKQZ,"""flickjunkie""","[7, 8]","Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real.  In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius.  This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in ""Gladiator"", good as it was.Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in ""Pollock"" (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the ""Gladiator"" Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, ""If you can't beat him, join him"", Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10.  It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.

The video looks handsome in its scenes of Eastern academia, fall colors warm but a bit flat at times. The nightmarish cold war scenes impart a definite chill with midnight-rendezvous blacks and cobalt blues. True flesh tones help sell Greg Cannom's often terrific makeup work.James Horner's swirling, math-inspired music sinks deep subwoofer roots via the Dolby Digital. The dialogue sounds muffled at times. Star Russell Crowe, in particular, seems to swallow more than a few lines, but it sounds like a mix or production issue. The problem can be mitigated by hiking your center speaker volume -- a fix that's a [bad] throwback to the early days of the DVD format. On Howard's commentary, the review disc's center track took a sudden leap in volume (at 1:49). Surround was OK but not much of a factor.In his commentary, Howard does not address the various controversies surrounding ""A Beautiful Mind"" and its many fictions, but he shares some of the internal debates over the film's tricky ""delusional"" scenes. He points out clues planted along the way for those working on the movie's mysteries, ""wondering if we were going to get caught."" While Howard works hard at being a good host, his understated commentary does become hard to sit through as the movie passes two hours. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, whose adaptation won the Oscar, seems more at home with the commentary process. He does, however, repeat many of Howard's observations. The special features include some interesting shots of Crowe and Nash on the set, looking like bookends of a life.

Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 9]","Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and an strong supporting cast offer extraordinary performances in A BEAUTIFUL MIND--and fortunately so, for the subject of the film has undergone a Hollywood homogenization that renders the film both timid and tepid.  Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow.  Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition.  It all has a &quot;santitized for your protection&quot; feel.But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish.  I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends.  Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine.

Had a disgruntled member of staff doctored the popcorn? We had already got off to an inauspicious start on the way to the cinema when the afore-mentioned Mr Turner told me he was in therapy over a desire to travel to Australia and steal Russell Crowe's gym shorts, immediately after use. What is this, stalkers not-so-anonymous? There are things one would rather not know or speculate about, such as nicknames. Mr Crowe does have a growing fan base now, so one should not be surprised by such fevered fan obsessions. It is a comman affliction of modern industrial societies without heroic role models. Perhaps aware of this, Mr Crowe has decided to broaden his range from a dour long face to a dour long face with a medical condition. We applaud this leap across the Grand Canyon of thespianism. Paranoid schizophrenia is a sadly ignored topic on the big screen although many of us are simply paranoid. I was convinced that the usher was French. It was the onions around the shoulders and spiral moustache. After we sat down, Nigel 'spunky' Turner insisted to me that I was panicking over nothing as he had not seen anything of the sort. This is before he had touched the popcorn so I was a touch worried. Had the thought of seeing Jennifer Connelly in yet another T-shirt temporarily unhinged me? I was certainly going to complain to the managment about Mr Turner's condition although it would be hard to prove foul play due to Nigel's already well advanced pathological inability to tell truth from fiction. When we saw 'Fight Club' together the journey to the bus stop afterwards was the most frightening seven minutes of my life. Perhaps it's a blessing then that this film decided to leave out the toilet incident depicted in the book. Either way, I decided to keep shtum. The film is directed by Ron 'Happy Days' Howard.

590547,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B00005JKQZ,Godly Gadfly,"[2, 4]","Based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of the mathematical genius John Forbes Nash (born 1928), winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his revolutionary game theory, `A Beautiful Mind' recounts Nash's struggle with genius and with schizophrenia.  Frequently and incorrectly confused with multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia involves seeing delusions.  In real life the nature of Nash's delusions during his time of illness have been largely forgotten by him, and in this regard the screen-writer has taken the liberty to fictionally recreate delusions revolving around three imagined characters: a representative of the US Defence who convinces Nash to act as a code-breaker by examining popular magazines for hidden Russian codes giving clues about an imminent nuclear attack, an imagined college room mate and his young orphaned niece.But the real power of this movie is that it enables viewers to get inside the mind of a schizophreniac by making these delusions real and presenting them as an alternate reality.  Nash's inner landscapes are presented as real to the audience, just as they are real to those with schizophrenia, and we are drawn convincingly into his world.  Suddenly, the plot takes an abrupt turn as both movie viewers and Nash are robbed of these delusions by having the rug pulled from under them and confronted with reality.  For Nash the experience is even more terrifying - he ends up in a psychiatric hospital.  To say more would spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but it's enough to say that the experience of the movie is like the experience of the disease.  It's a brilliant concept that successfully enables us to empathize with Nash.  ""Imagine that you would suddenly have learned the peoples and places and moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been.""  The movie's success is enhanced by the brilliant acting of Russell Crowe as John Nash, in a performance of pathos in the same category of the memorable acting of Rainman and Forrest Gump; and a delightful soundtrack by James Horner with haunting vocals by Charlotte Church.But this movie is just as much the story of Nash's wife Alicia (in an award winning performance by Jennifer Connelly) as it is about Nash.  Despite his mental problems, she sticks by him and her love and commitment to him says a great deal about what marriage is really all about. Nash's words in the acceptance speech of his Nobel Prize point to her love as the real source of his endurance in the struggle, and it is her love that this movie is about just as much as it is about Nash's genius and illness.  This positive portrayal of marriage and of the undying love of a wife is a welcome change from the typical infidelity offered by Hollywood.  Her love is just as beautiful as Nash's mind.Parents should be aware that there are some incidents of blasphemy and sexual talk.  But the themes of this movie in dealing with the complexity of schizophrenia are clearly adult anyway.  Not only does it result in greater appreciation for John Nash, but also greater understanding and compassion for schizophrenia - even if the portrayal of Nash's life is not entirely accurate.  There are moral and historical flaws, but there's still tremendous beauty.  `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful film that was deservedly rewarded for its beauty with several Oscars (including Best Picture), and if you're a fan of serious movies your life will be enhanced by viewing it.  If only more films had this kind of beauty. -GODLY GADFLY",5,When truth is more powerful than fiction.,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,3542,"['Based', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'biography', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'born', '1928', 'winner', '1994', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'economics', 'revolutionary', 'game', 'theory', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'recounts', 'Nash', 'struggle', 'genius', 'schizophrenia', 'Frequently', 'incorrectly', 'confused', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'schizophrenia', 'seeing', 'delusions', 'real', 'life', 'nature', 'Nash', 'delusions', 'time', 'illness', 'have', 'been', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'regard', 'screen-writer', 'taken', 'liberty', 'fictionally', 'recreate', 'delusions', 'revolving', 'around', 'three', 'imagined', 'characters', 'representative', 'US', 'Defence', 'who', 'Nash', 'act', 'code-breaker', 'examining', 'popular', 'magazines', 'hidden', 'Russian', 'codes', 'giving', 'clues', 'imminent', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'imagined', 'college', 'room', 'mate', 'young', 'orphaned', 'real', 'power', 'movie', 'viewers', 'get', 'mind', 'schizophreniac', 'making', 'delusions', 'real', 'presenting', 'alternate', 'reality', 'Nash', 'inner', 'landscapes', 'are', 'presented', 'real', 'audience', 'just', 'are', 'real', 'schizophrenia', 'are', 'drawn', 'convincingly', 'world', 'Suddenly', 'plot', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'movie', 'viewers', 'Nash', 'are', 'robbed', 'delusions', 'having', 'rug', 'pulled', 'confronted', 'reality', 'Nash', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'up', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'say', 'experience', 'movie', 'experience', 'disease', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'successfully', 'empathize', 'Nash', 'Imagine', 'would', 'suddenly', 'have', 'learned', 'peoples', 'places', 'moments', 'most', 'important', 'were', 'not', 'gone', 'not', 'dead', 'worse', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'movie', 'success', 'enhanced', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'John', 'Nash', 'performance', 'pathos', 'same', 'category', 'memorable', 'acting', 'Rainman', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'delightful', 'soundtrack', 'James', 'Horner', 'haunting', 'vocals', 'Charlotte', 'Church.But', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'Nash', 'wife', 'Alicia', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Nash', 'mental', 'problems', 'sticks', 'love', 'commitment', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'marriage', 'really', 'Nash', 'words', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'point', 'love', 'real', 'source', 'endurance', 'struggle', 'love', 'movie', 'about', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Nash', 'genius', 'illness', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'marriage', 'undying', 'love', 'wife', 'welcome', 'change', 'typical', 'infidelity', 'offered', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Nash', 'mind.Parents', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'incidents', 'blasphemy', 'sexual', 'talk', 'themes', 'movie', 'dealing', 'complexity', 'schizophrenia', 'are', 'clearly', 'adult', 'anyway', 'Not', 'only', 'result', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'John', 'Nash', 'also', 'greater', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'schizophrenia', 'even', 'portrayal', 'Nash', 'life', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'are', 'moral', 'historical', 'flaws', 'still', 'tremendous', 'beauty', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'deservedly', 'rewarded', 'beauty', 'several', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', ""'re"", 'fan', 'serious', 'movies', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'only', 'more', 'films', 'had', 'kind', 'beauty', '-GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

Director Ron Howard takes the true story of Nobel laureate John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) and retells it in mawkishly sentimental and unconvincing fashion. That mathematical genius Nash overcame acute schizophrenia to win the respect of the academic world is undisputedly a story worth telling. But it is handled so clumsily, that it really does make you laugh out loud sometimes. The cinematic device Howard uses to explain how Nash `sees' numbers - they mysteriously light up and lift off the page - really could have been a little more complex and imaginative. How the awkward, anti-social, charmless Crowe manages to woo a stunner like Jennifer Connolly (I assume the real Mrs Nash was a little more ordinary looking...) - apparently because he was a numbers genius, which is clearly what all women look for in a man - is again wholly unconvincing.  And the make-up artists responsible for ageing Connolly thirty years should be fired immediately!There are some good element to the film. The scene where Nash uses a mathematical hypothesis to maximise his and his friends chances of `scoring' with some ladies, is amusing. Crowe is actually pretty good in the role, and none of the actors deliver bad performances. The responsibility for such an obvious, cliched interpretation lies squarely on Howard's shoulders, and the fact that he won the best director gong at the Academy Awards says all there is to say about the Academy. Commercialism and sentimentality win out over originality and imagination.

Add some cheesy music by James Horner for good measure, and you have a typical Ron Howard film. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it's just a simple chronicle of events rather than a character study, and we learn very little about John Forbes Nash Jr. other than the fact that he is a math genius and a schizophrenic. The movie tries to cram too much into the allotted 2 hours, and it inevitably feels rushed and choppy. All of the peripheral characters are also very poorly developed and the strong supporting cast is mostly wasted in thankless roles.Despite all these flaws, I really enjoyed this movie. The story is fascinating and moving, and The Sixth Sense-esque approach to depict Nash's schizophrenia from his point of view worked very well.

However, this is not the true-life story of THE John Nash, a Nobel Prize winning mathematician that suffers from schizophrenia.  Nor is this the screen adaptation of the book &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; by Sylvia Nasar.  The two share a title, a mental illness, and character names but little else.That said, the movie does an excellent job of portraying the life of a promenant individual who suffered from many classic symptoms of schizophrenia in the 60's &amp; 70's.  But it does not present the illness from both sides equally.  We see how the main character (not named in this section to avoid confusion) is afflicted, but we do not see enough of what those around him see.  Nor does it quite arrive at showing how glorious the &quot;light at the end of tunnel&quot; is after decades of fighting the darkness.The movie does not discuss John &amp; Alicia's real-life divorce, the repeated coast-to-coast trips, or the years John spent living in Europe.

590555,A2L5IDS334C1GL,B00005JKQZ,Hexanova,"[6, 8]","Russell Crowe puts in probably one of the best performances of his career as the genius, Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash. Based on a true story, John Nash attends Princeton and completes his Ph.D. dissertation on a revolutionary topic that eventually changes the way the financial world works. After graduation he accepts a prestigious position at the Wheeler Institute that does work for the government. Nash is at the top of his career when he gets sucked into a decoding project by William Parcher (Ed Harris). During this time he meets his future wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and starts a family. But his brushes with the life of espionage begin to take its toll and John's paranoid-schizophrenic side begins to reveal itself. John Nash was always known to be a little strange and quirky, but where did his real life begin and his imaginary one end? I'll leave that up to the viewing of the flick.As I said above, Russell Crowe really is a great actor. He gets blasted as being overrated (mainly because of Gladiator), but the guy really can act and convince us that he's someone other than Russell Crowe. Sadly, if Crowe does not win a Best Actor Oscar (which he probably won't) for this roll, that will make his award for Gladiator even that much more worthless and pointless. His performance in A Beautiful Mind is head and shoulders above what he gave us in Gladiator. Jennifer Connelly also puts in one of the best performances of her career. In fact, the entire cast doesn't have a single weak link. It's really hard to talk more to the plot without giving away some of the twists. But I can say that the ending is not one of these sappy ones (because it's true) or sad ones (where the struggling hero gets killed). The only reason I didn't bump it up into the A- territory is that it's just a teeny bit on the longish side. For a movie that is almost 100% action-free, relying on dialogue for over 2 hours is a hard thing to pull off.

Here he meets imaginary friends and allies or are they enemies(Ed Harris who plays a secret goverment agent).The pain and suffering endured by the Nash's is well played out-but it is never dealt with in sensational over dramatisation.This gives the whole film a great sense of realism and helps you to empathise even more with Nash and his wife.It's quite an emotional film with plenty of very sad moments,but there are also some really humerous moments to-not least being Dr. Nash and the way he tries to 'chat up' various women in his own unique and straight to the point style.Even though it has got some pretty sad moments there is always this sense of hope as Nash struggles to overcome adversity in his own particular way.So in the end all the characters display moments of true warmth that will leave their memory etched in the minds of the viewer for a long time.This film is a triumph for the human spirit which is acted out brilliantly-rarely have I found the subject of mathematical theories so interesting.But even rarer still is a bio-pic of such rich quality!",4,Fantastic Bio-Pic!,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,2005,"['Russell', 'Crowe', 'amazing', 'mathematician', 'called', 'Dr.', 'Nash', 'moving', 'interesting', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'years', 'World', 'War', '2', 'right', 'mid', ""90's.Dr"", 'John', 'Nash', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'own', 'particluar', 'field', 'first', 'what', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'difficulty', 'social', 'situations', 'soon', 'transforms', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'schizophrenia.I', 'have', 'say', 'Crowe', 'just', 'amazing', 'part.I', 'mean', 'even', 'better', 'oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'Gladiator-and', 'so', 'hard', 'describe', 'words', 'how', 'good', 'performance', 'ably', 'supported', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'certainly', 'oscar', 'playing', 'long', 'suffering', 'yet', 'very', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Crowe', 'condition', 'gradually', 'whole', 'thurst', 'movie', 'played', 'off', 'paranoia', 'early', 'years', 'cold', 'war', 'nice', 'contrast', 'delusions', 'Crowe', 'suffers', 'Here', 'imaginary', 'friends', 'allies', 'are', 'enemies', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'secret', 'goverment', 'agent', '.The', 'pain', 'suffering', 'endured', 'Nash', 'well', 'played', 'out-but', 'never', 'dealt', 'sensational', 'dramatisation.This', 'whole', 'film', 'great', 'sense', 'realism', 'empathise', 'even', 'more', 'Nash', 'wife.It', 'emotional', 'film', 'plenty', 'very', 'sad', 'moments', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'humerous', 'moments', 'to-not', 'least', 'being', 'Dr.', 'Nash', 'way', ""'chat"", 'up', 'various', 'women', 'own', 'unique', 'straight', 'point', 'style.Even', 'got', 'pretty', 'sad', 'moments', 'always', 'sense', 'hope', 'Nash', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'own', 'particular', 'way.So', 'end', 'characters', 'display', 'moments', 'true', 'warmth', 'will', 'leave', 'memory', 'etched', 'minds', 'viewer', 'long', 'time.This', 'film', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'acted', 'brilliantly-rarely', 'have', 'found', 'subject', 'mathematical', 'theories', 'so', 'interesting.But', 'even', 'rarer', 'still', 'bio-pic', 'such', 'rich', 'quality']",N/A

Russell Crowe is simply amazing at playing the part of John Nash. Jennifer Connelly deserved her Oscar for her part as Alicia Nash. Ed Harris did a great job as William Parcher. Christopher Plummer did a good job as Dr. Rosen who tries to help John overcome his problems. Paul Bettany also does a fine job as Charles Herman who is John's laid back roomate at Princeton. Ron Howard definetly deserved his Oscar for Best Director for this film. He's fantastic.The DVD of A Beautiful Mind is extremely well done. The picture is fantastic and well detailed. The colors are so vibrant throughout the film. The sound is perfect the entire film. There are also great special features.A Beautiful Mind tells the biography of the brilliant genius of a mathamatician, John Nash. The movie begins in a mathamatics class at Princeton where John Nash had a scholarship to becuase he is so good with math. His rival is the other winner of the scholarship who is always pressuring John. John's roommate helps John cope with thing when they get tough. John also studies people, animals, and other thing then draws there movement on window panes in his dorm room and the library of the college. Nash struggles throughout the movie with life, but his loving wife is always there to help him.This movie is overall extremely brilliant in everyway.

I was worried that it would be a sappy, self serving retelling of real historical events (lets not forget U571) But my fears were dissolved after the first ten minutes.So, is 'A Beautiful Mind' the year's best film? Perhaps not. This has been a fabulous year for films with 'Fellowship of the ring', 'In the bedroom', 'Iris', 'The man who wasn't there' and 'Training day' to name a few. However I was suprised by the fabulous performance Russell Crowe gave as the film's protagonist John Forbes Nash Jr. Last year I was a little let down by the academy awards. I felt the 'Gladiator' probably did deserve best picture, or course with 'Almost Famous' running a close second. However I did think that Crowe's best actor oscar was a little over the top.This year though I have decided to do a complete 180, I do not in fact think that 'A Beautiful Mind' deserves to be the best picture, but Russell definately deserves an Oscar for best actor (far be it from me to say Kevin Spacey is not deserving for 'The Shipping News'Crowe's performance is sintilating, and nothing the audience has ever seen before. A brash, macho figure playing a real life character with real frailties. And yes on occasion a sly laugh has to go out as to how ripped Crowe is for being a mathematician.The film is great however...a strange hodge-podge of mystery, intrigue with a well presented love story inserted. Like Crowe's success in 'Glaldiator', 'A Beautiful Mind' is indeed an epic that follows the follies of one man in his exploration of himself to absolve his dillusions.Ron Howard's directing is masterful, however I must question his choice of pacing in the film. I felt like the latter parts of Nash's life were rushed through a little too much and the setting up of his character was a little too lengthly from the outset. This gave me the feeling of two seperate films, linked only through common characters.As far as the costume and make-up go the results are flawless. The costume changes make it quite evident to the viewer the time period in which the characters are living in. And through make-up their aging process is affirmed with spectacular results.Overall 'A Beautiful Mind' in my mind (forgive the pun) is not the years best film... it is fantastic however and is well worth the money to only go and see Crowe deliver a tour-de-force performance that is rivaled by very few this season.I would give this film a solid 3 and a half stars",3,A Beautiful film.,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,2510,"['Walking', 'theatre', 'had', 'reservations', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'be', 'sappy', 'self', 'serving', 'retelling', 'real', 'historical', 'events', 'not', 'forget', 'U571', 'fears', 'were', 'dissolved', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes.So', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'year', 'best', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'been', 'fabulous', 'year', 'films', ""'Fellowship"", 'ring', 'bedroom', ""'Iris"", 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", ""'Training"", 'day', 'name', 'few', 'However', 'was', 'suprised', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'gave', 'film', 'protagonist', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'Jr.', 'Last', 'year', 'was', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'academy', 'awards', 'felt', ""'Gladiator"", 'probably', 'did', 'deserve', 'best', 'picture', 'course', ""'Almost"", 'Famous', 'running', 'close', 'second', 'However', 'did', 'think', 'Crowe', 'best', 'actor', 'oscar', 'was', 'little', 'top.This', 'year', 'have', 'decided', 'do', 'complete', '180', 'do', 'not', 'fact', 'think', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'deserves', 'be', 'best', 'picture', 'Russell', 'definately', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'far', 'be', 'say', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'not', 'deserving', ""'The"", 'Shipping', ""News'Crowe"", 'performance', 'sintilating', 'nothing', 'audience', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'brash', 'macho', 'figure', 'playing', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'real', 'frailties', 'yes', 'occasion', 'sly', 'laugh', 'go', 'out', 'as', 'how', 'ripped', 'Crowe', 'being', 'mathematician.The', 'film', 'great', 'however', 'strange', 'hodge-podge', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'well', 'presented', 'love', 'story', 'inserted', 'Crowe', 'success', ""'Glaldiator"", 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'indeed', 'epic', 'follies', 'one', 'man', 'exploration', 'absolve', 'dillusions.Ron', 'Howard', 'directing', 'masterful', 'however', 'must', 'question', 'choice', 'pacing', 'film', 'felt', 'latter', 'parts', 'Nash', 'life', 'were', 'rushed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'setting', 'up', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'lengthly', 'outset', 'gave', 'feeling', 'two', 'seperate', 'films', 'linked', 'only', 'common', 'characters.As', 'far', 'costume', 'make-up', 'go', 'results', 'are', 'flawless', 'costume', 'changes', 'make', 'quite', 'evident', 'viewer', 'time', 'period', 'characters', 'are', 'living', 'make-up', 'aging', 'process', 'affirmed', 'spectacular', 'results.Overall', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'mind', 'forgive', 'pun', 'not', 'years', 'best', 'film', 'fantastic', 'however', 'well', 'money', 'only', 'go', 'see', 'Crowe', 'deliver', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'rivaled', 'very', 'few', 'season.I', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'solid', '3', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

The movie only touches the outskirts of the pain his schizophrenia caused. The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likeable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have.The movie is a hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife.I enjoyed the movie immensely.

It really lets you get into Nash's head and see his sickness from his perspective.Other than that, Crowe does an incredible job of playing a geeky professor.  You'd never guess this was an action hero gladiator.  This movie does a good job of keeping you entertained and telling a thorough story, though it leaves a couple loose ends undone.  And how did his son turn out?  Also, though the madness was well explored, but the relationship with his wife was kind of neglected, and I didn't get a good feel for why she put up with the manic side of him, though there must have been something there.The scene where he explains the strategy of 'hooking up' with the females coming into the bar was an amazing analysis of something seemingly banal.  I wish they had gone into his other theories a little bit more, because all we could rely on was the testimony of his colleagues and peers who all said he was brilliant.  I like it better when the movie shows why he's brilliant, not tells us he's brilliant.All in all, though, it's a pretty good story.

590576,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B00005JKQZ,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[4, 5]","I was moved and fascinated by Russell Crowe's sensitive portrayal of John Nash as a brilliant mathematician plagued by the debilitating disease of schizophrenia. The story begins when Nash is at Princeton in the last 1940's pursuing his Ph.D. degree. He yearns to be important and have a breakthrough idea, but the interior world of his mind that he inhabits leaves him no time or desire for social interaction with others. He is intense, arrogant and competitive, and often not very likeable. He develops a ground-breaking equilibrium theory and receives the highest honors and an appointment to a government think-tank at MIT, where he earns a reputation as the best code breaker ever known. He is also supposed to teach a math class, which he occasionally remembers to do, and falls in love with one of his students, played by the beautiful, charismatic Jennifer Connelly.While at MIT he is approached by Parchman, a mysterious CIA operative, complete with black-hat and trench coat, played skillfully by Ed Harris. Parchman asks Nash to work with him on extracting codes imbedded in magazines and newspapers by the Russians who are hiding deadly nuclear bombs somewhere in the U.S. Nash becomes obsessed with this project to the exclusion of all his other work, and through this project his schizophrenia is finally revealed.The course of treatment for his mental disease is disturbing and tense. The audience is never certain what is in his mind and what is real. The brutal shock treatments and drug therapy leave him functioning like a zombie, and the ultimate irony of a brilliant mind flawed by mental disease is alarming. After a powerful episode where he has stopped taking his medications, and has threatened the lives of his wife and child, he finally admits his delusions and both he and his wife become committed to fighting the disease.It seems the best therapy, for Nash anyway, was to admit that some of the characters that inhabited his world were delusions, but to no longer allow them to control him. He returns to Princeton, and spends his days hanging around the library, working on his formulas and theories, and is eventually allowed to teach a class. The faculty and students accept him as an eccentric, harmless academic.Crowe displays an awesome range of acting skill in playing a brash, young student, a frenetic mad man, a humble supplicant, and eventually a doddering old oddball. The final feel-good scene where he accepts his Nobel Prize in Sweden could have felt like blatant audience manipulation, but instead felt like a well-earned tribute to Nash, the brilliant, but ultimately flawed mind and the beautiful relationship he had sustained with his loving, supportive wife.",5,A Moving Exploration of Brilliance & Schizophrenia,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,2709,"['was', 'moved', 'fascinated', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Nash', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'plagued', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'schizophrenia', 'story', 'when', 'Nash', 'Princeton', 'last', '1940', 'pursuing', 'Ph.D.', 'degree', 'be', 'important', 'have', 'breakthrough', 'idea', 'interior', 'world', 'mind', 'time', 'desire', 'social', 'interaction', 'others', 'intense', 'arrogant', 'competitive', 'often', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'ground-breaking', 'equilibrium', 'theory', 'highest', 'honors', 'appointment', 'government', 'think-tank', 'MIT', 'where', 'reputation', 'best', 'code', 'breaker', 'ever', 'known', 'also', 'supposed', 'teach', 'math', 'class', 'occasionally', 'remembers', 'do', 'love', 'one', 'students', 'played', 'beautiful', 'charismatic', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly.While', 'MIT', 'approached', 'Parchman', 'mysterious', 'CIA', 'operative', 'complete', 'black-hat', 'trench', 'coat', 'played', 'skillfully', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Parchman', 'Nash', 'work', 'extracting', 'codes', 'imbedded', 'magazines', 'newspapers', 'Russians', 'who', 'are', 'hiding', 'deadly', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'somewhere', 'U.S.', 'Nash', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'project', 'exclusion', 'other', 'work', 'project', 'schizophrenia', 'finally', 'revealed.The', 'course', 'treatment', 'mental', 'disease', 'disturbing', 'tense', 'audience', 'never', 'certain', 'what', 'mind', 'what', 'real', 'brutal', 'shock', 'treatments', 'drug', 'therapy', 'leave', 'functioning', 'zombie', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'flawed', 'mental', 'disease', 'alarming', 'powerful', 'episode', 'where', 'stopped', 'taking', 'medications', 'threatened', 'lives', 'wife', 'child', 'finally', 'delusions', 'wife', 'become', 'committed', 'fighting', 'disease.It', 'best', 'therapy', 'Nash', 'anyway', 'was', 'admit', 'characters', 'inhabited', 'world', 'were', 'delusions', 'longer', 'allow', 'control', 'Princeton', 'days', 'hanging', 'library', 'working', 'formulas', 'theories', 'eventually', 'allowed', 'teach', 'class', 'faculty', 'students', 'accept', 'eccentric', 'harmless', 'academic.Crowe', 'displays', 'awesome', 'range', 'acting', 'skill', 'playing', 'brash', 'young', 'student', 'frenetic', 'mad', 'man', 'humble', 'supplicant', 'eventually', 'doddering', 'old', 'oddball', 'final', 'feel-good', 'scene', 'where', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Sweden', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'blatant', 'audience', 'manipulation', 'instead', 'felt', 'well-earned', 'tribute', 'Nash', 'brilliant', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'had', 'sustained', 'loving', 'supportive', 'wife']",N/A

Secondly, I have had a couple of friends who were Putnam Math Prize winners who clung perilously to the edge of sanity and in both cases, slipped over the brink if not permanently, then for quite a bit of time. What is it about math and madness? John Nash, the brilliant Nobel Prize winning mathematician, the subject of this film, himself has declared that the soaring realms of thought he pursued tipped him over the edge of reality.So what about this film? Did Russell Crowe deserve all the acclaim? Yes, I think he did an admirable job moving from ultra-introverted, socially impossible genius to paranoid schizophrenic. Little clues gave hint of the break-up of Nash's fragile mind--and even the viewer can't be sure when reality breaks into a fugue of utter madness. That's what I loved about this film. I wasn't entirely fooled, but I also walked along side Nash's reality with him, in his world. That was brilliant acting from Crowe.However, the film seems to get a bit hazy, and quite a bit cliche when lithesome Jennifer Connelly is on screen. The love story is just too Hollywood for my tastes--especially the end. How Russell Crowe was snubbed for this performance, and Connelly and Howard got the nod baffles me, but that's the Academy of Motion Pictures for you. And of course, they ignored the always-reliable Ed Harris, who played the mysterious intelligence agent with just the right touch of weirdness. Christopher Plummer was another fine supporting actor here--as the psychiatrist who treats Nash. Plummer very skillfully shows how Nash views him paranoically, then realistically later on. A great job in a cameo role.Some people criticized the film because it did not portray Nash's ambivalent sexuality. And it left out his illegitimate child by another woman. Frankly, though these facts are important to Nash's biography, they would have fragmented the film even more. While I didn't admire Howard's direction nor the screenplay entirely, I will hand it to the writers and editors for choosing wisely what NOT to put in, to make the story flow.The DVD has extras, including interviews with Nash, some things about Nash's theory of equilibrium and the sound track. It is great to see the interview with Nash to compare the real man with Crowe's interpretation.

590586,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005JKQZ,Josh Hitchens,"[5, 5]","&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is one of the few films to look at mental illness in a real and positive way. It is also an amazing motion picture. Concerning the story of brilliant mathematician John Nash, played by the brilliant Russel Crowe, and his wife Alicia, played by the luminous Jennifer Connelly, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; succeeds in taking the audience on an often intense and emotional journey where you care deeply for the characters.The film follow Nash from his college days at Princeton University where he makes a groundbreaking discovery, to his winning the Nobel Prize in 1994. John Nash courts Alicia, a beautiful young woman who is his equal intellectually and emotionally. They eventually marry and have a son, and then John is diagnosed with schizophrenia. I won't disclose the film's jaw-dropping twist, as some reviewers have. Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have come under fire for &quot;cheating&quot; the audience, but this method was used to make the viewer aware of how schizophrenia works, and the huge effect that it has on people's lives.&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; would not work without the central performances of Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. Crowe makes Nash such a rich and absorbing personality that you cannot help but be riveted to him. He works with subtle gestures and eye movements to personify John Nash, changing his entire body to be that of the character. That is real acting folks. This film is one of the chief reasons why Russel Crowe is one of the best actors working now. He makes us sympathize and love Nash, but never pitying him. Jennifer Connelly follows her amazing performance in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; with this role. As the wife of the mentally tormented Nash, Connelly creates a woman of enormous strength and loyalty. She is every bit Crowe's and Nash's equal, and deservedly won an Oscar for her subtle and emotional work here. Together these two actors create two noble and real characters. Ron Howard also is excellent his his direction of the film, never letting the events become sensationalized or melodramatic. It is always real and heartbreaking.Above all, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is the uplifting story of a man who was able to conquer the demons within himself. As the elderly Nash says to Alicia in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, &quot;You are the reason I am here. You are all my reasons.&quot; It is a triumph of a beautiful mind, a beautiful man, and a triumph of unconditional devotion and love.",5,&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;,1025049600,"06 26, 2002",2002,2500,"['quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'look', 'mental', 'illness', 'real', 'positive', 'way', 'also', 'amazing', 'motion', 'picture', 'Concerning', 'story', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash', 'played', 'brilliant', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'Alicia', 'played', 'luminous', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'taking', 'audience', 'often', 'intense', 'emotional', 'journey', 'where', 'care', 'deeply', 'characters.The', 'film', 'follow', 'Nash', 'college', 'days', 'Princeton', 'University', 'where', 'groundbreaking', 'discovery', 'winning', 'Nobel', 'Prize', '1994', 'John', 'Nash', 'courts', 'Alicia', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'equal', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'eventually', 'marry', 'have', 'son', 'then', 'John', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'film', 'jaw-dropping', 'twist', 'reviewers', 'have', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'have', 'come', 'fire', 'quot', 'cheating', 'quot', 'audience', 'method', 'was', 'used', 'make', 'viewer', 'aware', 'how', 'schizophrenia', 'works', 'huge', 'effect', 'people', 'lives.', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'central', 'performances', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'rich', 'absorbing', 'personality', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'riveted', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'eye', 'movements', 'personify', 'John', 'Nash', 'changing', 'entire', 'body', 'be', 'character', 'real', 'acting', 'folks', 'film', 'one', 'chief', 'reasons', 'why', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'now', 'sympathize', 'love', 'Nash', 'never', 'pitying', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'amazing', 'performance', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'role', 'wife', 'mentally', 'tormented', 'Nash', 'Connelly', 'woman', 'enormous', 'strength', 'loyalty', 'bit', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'equal', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'work', 'here', 'Together', 'two', 'actors', 'create', 'two', 'noble', 'real', 'characters', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'also', 'excellent', 'direction', 'film', 'never', 'letting', 'events', 'become', 'sensationalized', 'melodramatic', 'always', 'real', 'heartbreaking.Above', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'uplifting', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'conquer', 'demons', 'elderly', 'Nash', 'Alicia', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'quot', 'are', 'reason', 'am', 'here', 'are', 'reasons.', 'quot', 'triumph', 'beautiful', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'man', 'triumph', 'unconditional', 'devotion', 'love']",N/A

In fact, his character is also rude, arrogant, and brilliant - but still sympathetic.Jennifer Connelly's Oscar was not an aberration. She not only holds her own with Crowe but bests him on occasion. She has come so far from her fluffy eye candy days that it's like watching a different person. Brava, Jen.The greatest achievement, however, may be Akiva Goldsman's script. It takes a revelatory turn in mid-picture and completely opens John Nash's experience to you.

He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics.The film spans several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University.  Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash.  The part required the transformation of Nash from a young and healthy man to an aging schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly. She's very convincing as an intelligent and strong woman who comes to realize that her brilliant husband is very troubled and lives in another world.One particular and lovely scene stands out in my mind where Nash and his future wife are looking at the stars. He tells her to think of different shapes or animals and he is able to look at the night sky, with its millions of stars, and link them together into whatever form she mentions. I wish there had been more scenes of that kind and maybe a little insight into Nash's family and childhood.John Nash was eventually awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for Mathematics, which is some consolation, but the tragedy of his gifted mind being assaulted by delusions was something that I won't forget.

The big shock of the film works;we find out that whole portions of John's day to day life exist only in his head and have for years. Looking at it later, you can see the very subtle hints that people and things are just fantasies. Nash's best friend only appears when he really needs him. Ed Harris appears, in highly stressful or emotional times, like his wedding day. This is a great film and only has a few tiny flaws.

I've seen a lot of reviews that call A Beautiful Mind slick & superficial but I don't agree. I found it to be a well-done overview of the life of a brilliant and troubled man. There was enough pathos to give us the feel for it without turning the movie into a dark depiction of mental illness, and enough humor to make John Nash come alive. How can you sum up a man's life in 2 hrs? The only way I know is to pick highlights out of his life and come up with a poignant overview. Ron Howard successfully (in my opinion) does this.By taking us into Nash's delusions it shows us how fine the line can be between reality and fantasy and that no one, despite obvious brilliance, is immune to problems. One of my favorite parts is when Nash is told that he seems haunted by his delusions. He replied that they are in the past and that everyone is haunted by their past. The impact of the past is controlled by how much attention (power) we turn over to them, not their existence in itself.I thought that the entire cast was great and deserving of recognition.

590606,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,B00005JKQZ,Kristoffer Infante,"[2, 3]","By the time you read this, the Oscar nominations will have been announced.Certainly I'm no fan of Russell Crowe, especially with all the hoopla that he's so handsome (I find that very debatable, in my opinion) and talented (which is more likely). Hot off of last year's win as Best Actor for GLADIATOR (he only because of the oversight from THE INSIDER), Crowe has come again for a third consecutive nomination, starting in 1999 for THE INSIDER. Honestly, this has to be Crowe's most sincere performance that I've seen from him that's even worth mention (I only saw bits of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Crowe plays real-life Princeton teacher John Forbes Nash, who is suffering from schizophrenia. Along with Crowe is Best Supporting Actress nominee Jennifer Connelly, as his faithfully devoted wife Alicia Nash; Ed Harris as FBI agent Parcher; and Christopher Plummer as John's doctor, Dr. Rosen.Based on the book by Sylvia Nasar, this film was directed by Ron Howard, who is nominated for Best Director, a correction for the snub in 1995 for APOLLO 13, and produced by his partner, Brian Grazer, from Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, their production company.I figured that A BEAUTIFUL MIND would be a pretty good film, not just from good word-of-mouth, but from the story of a man suffering from a disease and his rise and fall and rise again. It sometimes goes into RAIN MAN territory by showing that Nash is somewhat of a genius, yet flawed. We see his early years in Princeton in the 1940s to when he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994, his marriage to Alicia and the pitfalls they face during the terrible stages of his disorder. He soon suspects that Russian agents are out to get him, which is where Ed Harris comes in. Later, after he is institutionalized, we realize that Agent Parcher (Harris) and Nash's roommate Charles, played by Paul Bettany, and his niece are figments of Nash's imagination. We see that down period in his life. Then, his rise back up! He continues his life with Alicia, they have a child, and Nash returns to Princeton to continue teaching. In the end, he gets the recognition he deserves as students give him their pens as a sign of their deepest respect of him, something he wanted since his student years.The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman, has many great moments of poignancy, zing, suspense, and tenderness. While playing a game (whatever it was!) of putting white and black chips on a board, Nash is challenged by a fellow colleague. His response after being asked if he was afraid to play: ""Terrified, mortified, stupified... by you!"" It had a good comedic moment and timing there. Or when the ""Reds"" are chasing Nash and Parcher, there is some gunfire and car chases. And when Alicia begs Nash to realize what is real - that SHE is real - added dramatic punch.In the end, I left the theater very impressed by what I saw. And even though I'm not a fan of my rival Russell Crowe, he has earned my sincere respects.

He is certainly one of the finest directors around today, and this film is certainly reflective of his talent. The technique that he employs to illustrate the descent of John Nash into the world of schitzophrenia is highly effective.Loosely based upon the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, the world of schitzophrenia is brought to life in this film by a wonderful screenplay, deft direction, and superb acting. Featuring the life of Nobel Prize laureate, John Nash, this film begins to chronicle his life from 1947, when he was a young, promising, though eccentric, graduate student at Princeton University. The film delineates his lack of social skills, eccentricities, rise to prominence, marriage, and eventual descent into schitzophrenic hell. It follows his battle with madness and his own way of coping with his inner demons. It also shows how Nash's early work proved to be so influential that it netted him a Nobel Prize decades later. While a number of people have objected to the fact that this film leaves out some of the darker sides of Nash, one would do well to remember that this is not a documentary but merely a dramatization.Russell Crowe gives a memorable portrayal of the afflicted and tormented John Nash, beleagured by the devils that existed only in his mind. Ed Harris is compelling as the slightly sinister Parcher, a shadowy government operative whose existence is intertwined with that of John's. Paul Bettany, as he did in the role of Chaucer in ""A Knight's Tale"", once again almost steals the show in the role of John's alleged roommate and friend, Charles. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Dr. Rosen, the psychiatrist who appeals to the dormant rationality in Nash. While Jennifer Connelly gives a very good performance in the role of Alicia, John's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars. It is an absolutely value laden two disc DVD. The first disc offers a widescreen version of the film in addition to two commentaries. One is by the director, Ron Howard. The other is by the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman. The second disc is devoted entirely to special features. Particularly memorable is the feature with John Nash himself, explaining his theory on equilibrium. There is also a feature that shows the Nobel Prize awards of 1994 and Nash's acceptance of his in Economics.

590615,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JKQZ,Linda Linguvic,"[28, 35]","""A Beautiful Mind"" certainly is the best picture of the year.  Based on a the true story of the paranoid schizophrenic, John Nash, who went on to win a Nobel Prize, Russell Crowe took on a difficult and demanding role.  Jennifer Connelly, who plays his understanding wife, won an Oscar for supporting actress and her performance was also excellent.  The highest accolades, however, must go to Ron Howard who directed it and Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay.  They certainly deserved the awards they won and, while good actors can be found everywhere, it is that special combination of knowing just what words to say or angle to shoot a scene that made this the perfect film.It wasn't just the story, which is, in itself, awe-inspiring.  It was HOW that story was told and the message it proclaimed loud and clear that made it a winner.  The audience was pulled right into John Nash's mind.  We saw and felt his delusions.  We thought they were real.  And we were right there with him as he gradually came to realize that they were just a product of his mind.  Then, as story developed, we learned a valuable lesson, one that relates to all of us whether we admit it or not.  If it is possible for Mr. Nash to live with his demons and go on and make a valuable contribution to society, then all of us can learn to live with ours.  This theme rang true as I watched the film, and will live with me long after.  It's a beautiful concept and ""The Beautiful Mind"" is a winner on all counts.

590619,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JKQZ,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[9, 12]","It's easy to be critical of the portrayal of schizophrenia if you understand it well, or if you are schizophrenic yourself.  However, I know little about the subject.  Further, I know very little about John Nash's life.  Therefore, any criticism related to either I must ignore because of the beauty of the movie and the triumph of the character.John Nash is one of those very rare people on spaceship earth:  a true genius.  The movie does a pretty decent job at providing examples of his genius.  There's no need to dwell on the subject, because it's pretty evident from his mannerisms that this guy is in a place that you and I will never truly understand.Russell Crowe is more than good in the role of John Nash, he is truly outstanding.  As I compare his performance in &quot;Gladiator&quot; to his performance in this movie, which stretches his abilities significantly in areas that &quot;Gladiator&quot; merely explored, I have come to realize that Russell Crowe is a one of the great actors of our time.  Perhaps schizophrenia is not as seamless as portrayed in the movie, but with 120 minutes to work with, I was thoroughly convinced.I was also very absorbed by the choice that Nash made.  He could either keep taking the medication, or choose to fight his problem and regain his mathematical abilities, and some control over his life.  He chose the second.  To make such a choice reminded me of Charlie in a similarly poignant story, &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, which was the basis for the movie &quot;Charley&quot; with Cliff Robertson.  Only in that story Charlie had no choice he could make other than to fight.  In a way, Nash fought and never truly won, but was able to overcome his difficulties well enough to be functional.Jennifer Connelly, who I enjoyed in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;, among others, is all grown up and performs at the same level as Russell Crowe, well deserving of an Oscar.  Jennifer too deserves the appellation of &quot;great&quot;.  She will definitely be in high demand in the future.  By the way, she is prettier than she has ever been.This edition of the movie features 2 discs with all kinds of extras.  I don't quite understand why the full screen edition costs more than the wide screen edition (which is what I purchased), but either is worth the price.  I won't bother to give you all the extras you get, but there is a lot.I found that at the end of the movie I got a bit teary-eyed, and my wife did not.  After discussing the movie with several other people, I found that for some reason this movie tends to be more emotional for men than women.  I was unable to find a good reason for this, but I find the phenomenon interesting, since usually it is the other way around.  My point is that if you found the ending moving and left you with a really good feeling, then you probably understood the movie and this is clearly a movie you should own.  If you sat there and said to yourself, &quot;What in the heck was that all about?&quot;, then this isn't the movie for you.",5,A Beautiful Movie,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,3090,"['easy', 'be', 'critical', 'portrayal', 'schizophrenia', 'understand', 'well', 'are', 'schizophrenic', 'However', 'know', 'little', 'subject', 'Further', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'Therefore', 'criticism', 'related', 'must', 'ignore', 'beauty', 'movie', 'triumph', 'character.John', 'Nash', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'people', 'spaceship', 'earth', 'true', 'genius', 'movie', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'providing', 'examples', 'genius', 'need', 'dwell', 'subject', 'pretty', 'evident', 'mannerisms', 'guy', 'place', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'understand.Russell', 'Crowe', 'more', 'good', 'role', 'John', 'Nash', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'compare', 'performance', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'performance', 'movie', 'abilities', 'significantly', 'areas', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'merely', 'explored', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'schizophrenia', 'not', 'as', 'seamless', 'portrayed', 'movie', '120', 'minutes', 'work', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'convinced.I', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'absorbed', 'choice', 'Nash', 'made', 'could', 'either', 'keep', 'taking', 'medication', 'choose', 'fight', 'problem', 'regain', 'mathematical', 'abilities', 'control', 'life', 'chose', 'second', 'make', 'such', 'choice', 'reminded', 'Charlie', 'similarly', 'poignant', 'story', 'quot', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'quot', 'Daniel', 'Keyes', 'was', 'basis', 'movie', 'quot', 'Charley', 'quot', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Only', 'story', 'Charlie', 'had', 'choice', 'could', 'make', 'other', 'fight', 'way', 'Nash', 'fought', 'never', 'truly', 'won', 'was', 'able', 'overcome', 'difficulties', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'functional.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Labyrinth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rocketeer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dark', 'City', 'quot', 'others', 'grown', 'up', 'performs', 'same', 'level', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'well', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'Jennifer', 'too', 'appellation', 'quot', 'great', 'quot', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'high', 'demand', 'future', 'way', 'prettier', 'ever', 'been.This', 'edition', 'movie', '2', 'discs', 'kinds', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'full', 'screen', 'edition', 'more', 'wide', 'screen', 'edition', 'what', 'purchased', 'price', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'give', 'extras', 'get', 'lot.I', 'found', 'end', 'movie', 'got', 'bit', 'teary-eyed', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'discussing', 'movie', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'found', 'reason', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'emotional', 'men', 'women', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'good', 'reason', 'find', 'phenomenon', 'interesting', 'usually', 'other', 'way', 'point', 'found', 'ending', 'moving', 'left', 'really', 'good', 'feeling', 'then', 'probably', 'understood', 'movie', 'clearly', 'movie', 'should', 'own', 'sat', 'said', 'quot', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'quot', 'then', ""n't"", 'movie']",N/A

His works always makes us feel good.  ""Cocoon"", ""Backdraft"", ""Willow"" -all these films are fine examples of Howard's abilitites to manipulate our feelings.  Hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a trait which is very essential on him and his movies.When I started watching ""A Beautiful Mind"", I found myself watching what might be Ron Howard's first attempt to make something serious.  The real story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. is quite gripping.  And his fight to overcome schyzophrenia is quite attractive because he watches some sort of ghosts or imaginary people who are product of his problem.  Russell Crowe's performance is one of a kind and makes the rest of his castmates, especially Jennifer Connelly, perform in a very fantastic way.  Ed Harris seems to be the only one wasted as one of Nash's ""ghosts"".As I said before, this is Ron Howard's first attempt at serious filmmaking.  However, his formulaic pattern becomes noticeable at the final fifteen minutes when Nash's wife gives her total support in one of the most unnecessarily romantic moments of the movie.  And the Nobel Prize ceremony scene is disappointing because it shows Howard's way of finding an easy conclusion to a very tough drama by giving his audience a way to feel sorry and weep for Crowe's character.

The biggest problem with it is that it's a shoe-in for Academy Awards like &quot;Best Actor,&quot; &quot;Best Director,&quot; and &quot;Best Picture.&quot; Director Ron Howard definitely deserves the Best Director award. This may be his best directing job yet. But let's look at the others. I really think any respectable actor besides Russell Crowe could've gotten the Best Actor award. That part could've been played by anybody and the award would've been given to him. The film was also a shoe-in for Best Picture simply because it was a touching life story about a man with a mental disease. But putting all these expectations aside, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is still a very good movie, even when it's obviously trying to jerk a few tears. It tells the story of John Nash, a gifted mathematician who finds out he has schizophrennia. We meet John when he's a young hotshot in college and follow his life up until 1994 when he recieves the Nobel prize. I wouldn't take everything in this movie as law. There are many inaccuracies and omissions to Nash's life in the film. But for what it's worth it is a well-made film and will delight those who weep easily in movies.

And he's never better than in showing the difference between what's inside the mind of someone afflicted with schizophrenia, and the reality that everyone else sees.  Even I, a practicing psychiatrist, was surprised to discover that Howard/Crowe/Nash had been leading me down a primrose path to hell.  It's elegantly understated, very watchable, and completely accurate.  But it may be the only accurate thing in the film, which is completely misleading.I haven't read Ms. Nasar's biography, which I understand is considerably more honest about Mr. Nash's life, so I do not blame her for this film.  The film is completely misleading. Mental illness is not like a cold that randomly affects some of us, who then take better care of our health and it goes away. Hallucinations can not be willed away.  Mr. Nash did not earn the Nobel Prize BECAUSE of some special creativity his disease gave him.  He did not even earn it THROUGH his psychiatric symptoms;  early in his disease, during (no doubt) a remission of his symptoms, the part of his brain not ravaged by the disease manifested it's greatness before schizophrenia made a mess of his life.  That came later, and fortunately he got treatment for it. But the disease remains.I fear people will watch this film and think, ""Wow, you can have schizophrenia and still win the Nobel Prize!"" And that thought is an insult to the victims of schizophrenia.  I include in those ""victims"" their family and friends, because their lives are devastated, too.

I bought it hoping to get more out of it by multiple viewings as well as the extra material.  Boy was that a mistake.The mathematics was never really explained, just shown to us by drawings.  I finally bought a copy of a book on the Game Theory in Politics to understand his groundbreaking work.A great movie, it just does not have repeat quality like Gandhi or JFK.  Once you see it, you see it.  As a French minor, I may end up playing the French dubbed version simply to feel like I got my money's worth.  Never a good sign.The stuff on the second disk was basically a waste of time to me.  I'm not interested in how they made a heavy drama like this.

590625,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JKQZ,magellan,"[2, 3]","I'm no judge of movies as I'm easily entertained and really just go to them to veg out for a while--movies are, after all--only passive entertainments--so I always get a kick out of those who take them so seriously (along with their own opinions about them). If I want serious narrative or story art, I can always read War and Peace or Madame Bovary. (That having been said, here I am writing a serious review about a serious movie!)But getting back to the main point, I really enjoyed this movie about a brilliant mathematician's meteoric rise to worldwide fame and academic renown, and equally quick descent into madeness. You wouldn't think anybody could make a film about a mathematician so dramatic, but the life of John Nash wasn't that of your usual cloistered academic. He was certifiably bonkers, and much of the movie is devoted to this long phase of Nash's life.I have some psychological background myself, and if I have one gripe about the movie is that the portrayal of paranoid schizophrenia is a little schizophrenic itself, but I didn't mind that too much (again, it's a movie, I don't even take my own opinions that seriously). So I'll just mention a classic comment by the famous British psychologist R.D. Laing, who worked on schizophrenia much of his career: ""A schizophrenic is a person the totality of whose existence is split in two main ways: there is a rent in his relationship with his world, and there is a rent in his relationship with himself."" In that sense, the movie did a good job of portraying what schizophrenia would actually be like.The performances by Crowe and Connelly are believeable and intense, and Ed Harris in his supporting role does his usual great job as one of Nash's imaginary characters. The guy who played Nash's imaginary college friend is also good (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name).Nash's struggle with his illness and his eventual recovery and return to work at Princeton, and ultimately, his awarding of the Nobel Prize, make for an absorbing and touching story, sort of like a ""Horatio Alger,"" or perhaps, ""Rocky of the psycho wards"" story. The last time I saw this good a movie about mental illness was the Robin Williams film ""Awakenings,"" and going way back, ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.""This one might top them all, and I agree with many other people that Crowe and Connelly are probably deserving of Academy awards for their performances.All in all, a great movie and I'm glad the producer and director had the nerve to do something different from the usual Hollywood fare.",5,Outstanding,1017878400,"04 4, 2002",2002,2556,"[""'m"", 'judge', 'movies', ""'m"", 'easily', 'entertained', 'really', 'just', 'go', 'veg', 'out', 'while', 'movies', 'are', 'only', 'passive', 'entertainments', 'so', 'always', 'get', 'kick', 'who', 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'own', 'opinions', 'want', 'serious', 'narrative', 'story', 'art', 'can', 'always', 'read', 'War', 'Peace', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'am', 'writing', 'serious', 'review', 'serious', 'movie', 'getting', 'back', 'main', 'point', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'worldwide', 'fame', 'academic', 'renown', 'equally', 'quick', 'descent', 'madeness', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'mathematician', 'so', 'dramatic', 'life', 'John', 'Nash', 'was', ""n't"", 'usual', 'cloistered', 'academic', 'was', 'certifiably', 'bonkers', 'much', 'movie', 'devoted', 'long', 'phase', 'Nash', 'life.I', 'have', 'psychological', 'background', 'have', 'one', 'gripe', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'little', 'schizophrenic', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'again', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'own', 'opinions', 'seriously', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'classic', 'comment', 'famous', 'British', 'psychologist', 'R.D', 'Laing', 'who', 'worked', 'schizophrenia', 'much', 'career', 'schizophrenic', 'person', 'totality', 'existence', 'split', 'two', 'main', 'ways', 'rent', 'relationship', 'world', 'rent', 'relationship', 'sense', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'what', 'schizophrenia', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'like.The', 'performances', 'Crowe', 'Connelly', 'are', 'believeable', 'intense', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'supporting', 'role', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'Nash', 'imaginary', 'characters', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Nash', 'imaginary', 'college', 'friend', 'also', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actor', 'name', '.Nash', 'struggle', 'illness', 'eventual', 'recovery', 'return', 'work', 'Princeton', 'ultimately', 'awarding', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'make', 'absorbing', 'touching', 'story', 'sort', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'perhaps', 'Rocky', 'psycho', 'wards', 'story', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'good', 'movie', 'mental', 'illness', 'was', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'Awakenings', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'Never', 'Promised', 'Rose', 'Garden', 'one', 'might', 'top', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'Crowe', 'Connelly', 'are', 'probably', 'deserving', 'Academy', 'awards', 'performances.All', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'producer', 'director', 'had', 'nerve', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'fare']",N/A

As has become rather expected in movies by the &quot;better&quot; American directors, the ending is pure schmaltz.  I presume studio pressure had a lot to do with it--which is an excuse that is unavailable to Mr. Speilberg, who has transformed himself into the king of schmaltzy endings.  But, I digress.Part of Crowe's approach to acting is to notice and replicate certain &quot;tics&quot; that become the nucleus around which his performance can spin, react, and coalesce.  But, unlike many lesser actors, these &quot;tics&quot; do not devolve into cliches.  He uses them as windows into the character's soul.  Here, John Nash's fingers do a figure eight on his forehead when the stress around him builds.  It's as if he is both shielding himself from the world and also wishing away demons with some arcane incantation.  Crowe's portrait of a man transformed by events beyond his control should have earned him an Oscar.  This truly was the performance of the year, and not a throwaway like Crowe's performance in the mediocre Gladiator.  But, apparently, he was even too rude and boorish for Hollywood (which is saying something when major stars can still win Oscars after attacking people with golf clubs).Jennifer Connolly won an oscar for her role, but I'm not quite sure why.  Her performance is adequate, but the role is thin and her range of emotion is merely ordinary.  There is one scene where she is driven into a rage of frustration, shattering a mirror in the process, but that is the only shining moment for her.Now if we can only get Mr. Howard to get off the schmaltzy ending train ...",4,Russell Crowe may be a jackass ...,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,1732,"['performance', 'movie', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'engaging', 'film', 'Not', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'become', 'rather', 'expected', 'movies', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'American', 'directors', 'ending', 'pure', 'schmaltz', 'presume', 'studio', 'pressure', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'excuse', 'unavailable', 'Mr.', 'Speilberg', 'who', 'transformed', 'king', 'schmaltzy', 'endings', 'digress.Part', 'Crowe', 'approach', 'acting', 'notice', 'replicate', 'certain', 'quot', 'tics', 'quot', 'become', 'nucleus', 'performance', 'can', 'spin', 'react', 'coalesce', 'many', 'lesser', 'actors', 'quot', 'tics', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'devolve', 'cliches', 'windows', 'character', 'soul', 'Here', 'John', 'Nash', 'fingers', 'do', 'figure', 'eight', 'forehead', 'when', 'stress', 'shielding', 'world', 'also', 'wishing', 'away', 'demons', 'arcane', 'incantation', 'Crowe', 'portrait', 'man', 'transformed', 'events', 'control', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'truly', 'was', 'performance', 'year', 'not', 'throwaway', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'mediocre', 'Gladiator', 'apparently', 'was', 'even', 'too', 'rude', 'boorish', 'Hollywood', 'saying', 'something', 'when', 'major', 'stars', 'can', 'still', 'win', 'Oscars', 'attacking', 'people', 'golf', 'clubs', '.Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'won', 'oscar', 'role', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'performance', 'adequate', 'role', 'thin', 'range', 'emotion', 'merely', 'ordinary', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'driven', 'rage', 'frustration', 'shattering', 'mirror', 'process', 'only', 'shining', 'moment', 'her.Now', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'get', 'off', 'schmaltzy', 'ending', 'train']",N/A

590635,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKQZ,Matthew Horner,"[1, 5]","I have somewhat mixed emotions about ""A Beautiful Mind"". It certainly succeeds as entertainment. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give two of the best performances of 2001. Ron Howard proves himself more than merely a dependable, workmanlike director. This story of real life mathematician John Nash's long battle with paranoid schizophrenia became an improbable boxoffice hit as well a multi-Oscar winner. Still, I think all of its flashiness and moments of brilliance say much more about the magic of movies than they do about mental illness. Madness was never this romantic for John Nash and his wife, Alicia. I think that in changing so many elements of the real story, the movie weighs in a little more on the side of commercialism than on art. To me, this prevents it from being a classic. I'd call it a very good movie.Crowe and Connelly, about whom I can't say enough, make the problems I had with the movie's script nearly irrelevant.  Connelly has been around for a number of years, making mostly independent films. With her remarkable talent, the transition to the big time was almost inevitable. Her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress was much deserved, as was Crowe's nomination for Best Actor. He won the award last year for ""Gladiator"" and was nominated the year before for ""The Insider"". The way he transforms himself for each role is amazing.""A Beautiful Mind"" brought Ron Howard his first nomination ever for Best Director. He won.

I would have never expected Russell Crowe to give this kind of performance. I'm glad Ron Howard has finally shown his dark side. What I really noticed about this film, thinking about the effect of emotion on eye color, was that Russell's eye color changed from green to blue in some scenes.Ron Howard has shown me that his directing is comparable to Frances Ford Coppola's and Martin Scorsese's. The two roles that Russell Crowe played in The Insider and A Beautiful Mind completely top his Oscar winning role in Gladiator. I loved Jennifer Connely's acting in this movie and the chemistry between Russell and Jennifer was electrifying. People who've said Russell is a one note actor will have a different opinion after seeing this movie.I think Russell Crowe's acting in this film is comparable to my favorites, Marlon Brando and Robert Deniro. I believe there has never been a method actor who has demonstrated such gifted acting as Russell Crowe in this film ""A Beautiful Mind.""Russell Crowe reminds me of Deniro a lot because of the intensity and sensitive emotion's they both show when acting.

590641,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,B00005JKQZ,Mercy Bell,"[5, 6]","&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is a film that may take you by surprise due to the fact that it's excellence lives up to the high expectations that the hype surrounding it has created for it. I went in curious and excited, but wondering how a biopic could be that intriguing. What I found interesting about it is that I didn't know what part of the film to pay attention to: the story, the acting, the gorgeous cinematography and color scheme, or the score.  Each seems to be a creature of its own and it's almost too much to try and incorporate them into one film and accept them all at once.As a film though, this one succeeds at a new level. Howard's style is engrossing and make the subject matter -Math, John Forbes Nash, and Schizophrenia- interesting. There's a scene when Nash tells his girlfriend (to-be wife) to pick a shape, he then proceeds to find that pattern in the sky, and Howard shows us what he sees. You are instantly made part of the film. In fact, Howard continually and ceaselessly shows us what Nash sees, which brings us into a different world; and this leads to a new portion of the storyline and integration with the rest of the film, though we may not know it. Nash's genius consists of the fact that he can see patterns in almost everything, leading him to be obsessively preoccupied with everything around him, we see what he sees. This contributes to his schizophrenia when he sees hallucinations, which we as an audience believe are real until we learn what is and what isn't. When he doubts, we doubt. It's an incredible way to keep us hooked, but not the only thing.The performances in this film are singularly marvelous. Watching Russell Crowe is like watching a little child in awe. He mumbles and does little hand motions and talks to himself and slumps and frowns and grins and looks like he has three hundred things whizzing around in his mind all at once. He's mezmerizing, and his body language and complete intensity makes up for his rather annoying accent. Jennifer Connelly, I believe, is the shining star of this film due to the fact that she doesn't have such the weight of stardom on her shoulders, but her performance is completely realistic and her subtlety and strength powerfully drive the character into a realm where any bit of a lesser actress would have failed miserably.And though it may not be as important, I feel that I must comment on it. The score by James Horner is beautiful. Due to the score, the beginning of the film, as in as soon as the film starts, is excellent. You wonder where it's going and where it'll start. It keeps the intensity and it's lushness throughout the film and only heightens the experience. Along side John Williams Harry Potter score this is the best score of the year, one of the best i've ever heard. Not to mention the outstanding costumes which looked incredibly comfortable, or the world that the cinematography evoked. You could feel each breeze, the rain, and the warmth in each scene.This is a fantastic film, and I daresay it grew on me.

Hind ""daria_m""","[2, 3]","I did like the emotional qualities of ""A Beautiful Mind"": the fear involved in an invisible spy conspiracy, the frustration of having a husband consumed by a mental disorder, the heartbreaking of finding out that people you care about aren't real.  In many ways, it's an engrossing story about John Nash and his very patient but hurt wife.  In others, it's a nervous twitch.  I don't know the real John Nash nor do I know much about him.  I do know that movies tend to portray schizophrenics or other mentally disturbed people (if they even take that risk) with an essence of staring of into space, snapping at people for no reason, walking hunched over, keeping to themselves.  Perhaps this is how John Nash is, but watching Russell Crowe act out this madness kind of wears you out. It gets very heartbreaking. And dare I say, it becomes a bit annoying?I can say that the movie was not as schmaltzy as I thought and the performances were generally good.  Jennifer Connelly (as wife Alicia Nash) deserved that Academy Award.  Alicia Nash herself deserves an award for standing by her husband through his problems if she is truly the strong person that Connelly portrays.I believe Ron Howard has probably made better movies that were worthy of Oscar wins (i.e. ""Apollo 13""), and I feel like the Academy may have given him his props finally but for the wrong film.  Oscar does have a history of rewarding deserving contenders later on for previous losses.  Russell could tell you about that.  He deserved the award for ""The Insider,"" but not for ""Gladiator.""  But that is an entirely different rant altogether.I will say that I did LIKE the movie, but I didn't love it enough to want to buy it.  You may see things differently and think it's brilliant.

I have an IQ which fluctuate from idiot to genius and can solve problems no one else have been able to solve. I have an overactive imagination as well. My opinion of mathematicians is they sometimes confuse mathematics with reality. A mathematical equation is not reality like many mathematicians think it is. Its easy to get trapped into thinking it is. I am a conspiracy nut and sometimes read people wrong. It is because I really was drugged and brainwashed by the government for knowing things I was not suppose to know. My former wife accused me of being schizophrenic and wanted me to get help. I think this movie is part of a conspiracy to cover up the fact people really are drugged and experimented on by the government and the government wants the public to think these people who claimed to have been experimented on with mind control are actually suffering from various brain disorders. But when they really are out to silence you it makes you paranoid. This movie was very informative.

I've never really heard about John Nash until I saw the film, and I had never read the book.  Is this based on a true story?  Yes.  Is it accurate.  I would like to hope so, but I cannot say that it is so.  What I DO KNOW is that this film touched and entertained me on so many different levels.  &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is such a great movie.....it's hard to put in words.  But I will try.The movie is based on a true story.  (Yes, it's true.  How accurate it is, I do not know.  Nor, do I tend to find out.)  This is about a man named John Nash, a genius who suffers from an illness that causes him to be dillusional.  (I do not know how to spell the word that describes the illness, so I am not even going to try to spell it.  You know what it is.)  It gets to the point where he cannot tell reality from illusion.  This is the story of a brilliant man and his struggles with life.  And how love from one woman most likely saved his life.The acting is incredible.  Russell Crowe does in outstanding job in this movie, and really was robbed at the Oscars.  Jennifer Connelly also does a terrific job, and very much deserved her Oscar.  And who can forget about Ed Harris, huh?  What about him?  He too needs to be acknowledged for his role in this very important film.The movie was very well directed, congrats to Ron Howard.  I never seem to be let down when I watch any of his movies.  This wasn't the easiest picture to make, but Ron did an outstanding job.  And the overall product shows that.The DVD is amazing.  Picture quality; top notch.  Sound; impressive, but lacks in some scenes, though I doubt that's the DVD's fault.  Would've been nice to have it available in DTS.  Lots and LOTS of extra features.  So if you enjoy extras on DVDs, you won't be disappointed.This really is a great movie; one of the year's best.  The movie won &quot;Best Picture&quot; for a reason.  If you want to see a great, moving, and touching film, see &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  Bound to be a classic, despite all of the controvercy over it.

590656,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKQZ,Mike,"[13, 15]","""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001)It is hard to make a movie about mathematics interesting. I mean, I can barely sit through a math class without getting bored out of my skin. This movie is about mathematics and numbers, and it has a man I've never heard of in the lead character. A Beautiful Mind really had nothing going for it. But this movie surprised me a lot. I was thrilled to find out this was one brilliant film, and one that is surely going to knock the critics' socks off.I wasn't that interested in the film at the beginning. But as I discovered as the film went on, this is one of those movies where the boring start is essential so the movie makes sense at the end. When I watch it next time I'll remember to look closer in the first few scenes. I think this'll be one of those films where you notice something different each time.This is one of the few examples of performances driving an entire film. Russell Crowe is the head and shoulders of this film and his performance is indescribable. I can't exactly find the right word to pinpoint how brilliant he was in this film. All I can say is that he became John Nash, and delivered a career-best, and by far one of the best leading male performances of the last 20 years or more. Jennifer Connelly is superior to all the supporting actresses of 2001 and will get applause in bucketloads. It's about time she did too, the actress has been around for a few years and has never seemed to get that much recognition for her work. Ed Harris is also good, and his plot twists are shocking. Christopher Plummer is the wise-old-man of the movie (for a little while anyway) and provides much subtlety to the heart of the film. As do Connelly and Crowe, who have one of those rare chemistries and sparks on screen...it was wonderful to see them act together.The direction by Ron Howard was incredible. As I was saying before, it is extremely hard to make an interesting film about a boring mathematician, but under Howard's impeccable direction and outstanding effort, the movie works on many different levels. As it turned out, this movie is not just about a mathematician and his numbers, its about hallucinations, schizophrenia, friends, socialising, and love overcoming all of these obstacles.To write a screenplay that includes all of these things and does it in a beautiful way, ask no other man but Akiva Goldsman. He used to write silly drivel of films but the man is turning into a potential genius of the writing industry! He adapts this engrossing material with enthusiasm for making his characters 3-dimensional and I learnt a lot about the world in general in general from this film, its messages came across loud and clear, and with style. And all this is coming from the guy who wrote Practical Magic, Lost in Space and Batman & Robin. Whew! Really shows you how a guy can improve his writing skills, huh?The score and music for the film is deeply affecting to the film's atmosphere. The score is very reminiscent of Titanic, with the same sadness, the same great use of a choir, and the same rightly chosen instruments to display the film's messages and morals. The song ""All Love Can Be"" was very touching. James Horner is the man!This movie will hopefully be nominated, and maybe even win, a few Oscars this year. All I know is it deserves it as it by far the best overall drama I've seen in 2001. Amazing performances, incredible writing, great direction, awesome music, stunning makeup effects (wow, Russell Crowe looks 50 years older!), neat camera tricks, good sounds and moods...all of this combined make this an inspirational piece for people who like films, and more importantly, love, and life.MY GRADE: A+",5,Love is king!,1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,3678,"['Beautiful', 'Mind', '2001', 'hard', 'make', 'movie', 'mathematics', 'interesting', 'mean', 'can', 'barely', 'sit', 'math', 'class', 'getting', 'bored', 'skin', 'movie', 'mathematics', 'numbers', 'man', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'lead', 'character', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'really', 'had', 'nothing', 'going', 'movie', 'surprised', 'lot', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'brilliant', 'film', 'one', 'surely', 'going', 'knock', 'critics', 'socks', 'off.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'film', 'beginning', 'discovered', 'film', 'went', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'boring', 'start', 'essential', 'movie', 'sense', 'end', 'When', 'watch', 'next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'look', 'closer', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'notice', 'something', 'different', 'time.This', 'one', 'few', 'examples', 'performances', 'driving', 'entire', 'film', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'head', 'shoulders', 'film', 'performance', 'indescribable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'find', 'right', 'word', 'pinpoint', 'how', 'brilliant', 'was', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'became', 'John', 'Nash', 'delivered', 'career-best', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'leading', 'male', 'performances', 'last', '20', 'years', 'more', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'superior', 'supporting', 'actresses', '2001', 'will', 'get', 'applause', 'bucketloads', 'time', 'did', 'too', 'actress', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'never', 'seemed', 'get', 'much', 'recognition', 'work', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'also', 'good', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'shocking', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'wise-old-man', 'movie', 'little', 'anyway', 'much', 'subtlety', 'heart', 'film', 'do', 'Connelly', 'Crowe', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'rare', 'chemistries', 'sparks', 'screen', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'act', 'together.The', 'direction', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'incredible', 'was', 'saying', 'extremely', 'hard', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'boring', 'mathematician', 'Howard', 'impeccable', 'direction', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'turned', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'mathematician', 'numbers', 'hallucinations', 'schizophrenia', 'friends', 'socialising', 'love', 'overcoming', 'obstacles.To', 'write', 'screenplay', 'things', 'beautiful', 'way', 'ask', 'other', 'man', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'used', 'write', 'silly', 'drivel', 'films', 'man', 'turning', 'potential', 'genius', 'writing', 'industry', 'engrossing', 'material', 'enthusiasm', 'making', 'characters', '3-dimensional', 'learnt', 'lot', 'world', 'general', 'general', 'film', 'messages', 'came', 'loud', 'clear', 'style', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Whew', 'Really', 'how', 'guy', 'can', 'improve', 'writing', 'skills', 'huh', 'score', 'music', 'film', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'score', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Titanic', 'same', 'sadness', 'same', 'great', 'use', 'choir', 'same', 'rightly', 'chosen', 'instruments', 'display', 'film', 'messages', 'morals', 'song', 'Love', 'Can', 'Be', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'James', 'Horner', 'man', 'movie', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'nominated', 'maybe', 'even', 'win', 'few', 'Oscars', 'year', 'know', 'far', 'best', 'overall', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2001', 'Amazing', 'performances', 'incredible', 'writing', 'great', 'direction', 'awesome', 'music', 'stunning', 'makeup', 'effects', 'wow', 'Russell', 'Crowe', '50', 'years', 'older', 'neat', 'camera', 'tricks', 'good', 'sounds', 'moods', 'combined', 'make', 'inspirational', 'piece', 'people', 'who', 'films', 'more', 'importantly', 'love', 'life.MY', 'GRADE', 'A+']",N/A
590657,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00005JKQZ,"Mike London ""MAC""","[0, 0]","Doing a review of a film like A BEAUTIFUL MIND is taxing because much of its impact comes from plot twist that, unless you know the life of John Nash (which I did not), will radically reorient your view of Nash.I encourage you to do two things. First, see this very powerful film.Next, don't read any reviews until after you see the movie. Most have a (necessary) spoiler which drastically weakens first viewing.The film opens with John Nash just attending Princeton in the late 1940s. He is a mathematician looking for that one ""original idea,"" which will distinguish him from his fellow students. Nash finds his idea when a group of prospective dates arrive at a local pub. His thesis radically departs from one hundred years of economic theory.The film deals with this quickly and efficiently, because (and lets be honest here) we didn't come for lessons in economic theory. After he writes his thesis, his professor thinks its brilliant and then the film jumps five years into the future. John Nash has begun working at an institution, where he is contacted by the government to help them fight Communism.John Nash meets his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). There is a very poignant moment in the movie where they are outside the governor's mansion on the terrace when John and her are looking into the sky. Nash tells her to pick any shape at all in the sky and he will find it. She finds this delightfully romantic. It's not so romantic, however, when she later discovers her husband has schizophrenia his tendency of discovering patterns has led him into believing he is doing classified government work.The viewer is unsure whether Nash having schizophrenia is a conspiracy against him or the actual truth. Part of this film's brilliance is putting the audience in Nash's position. Being unsure yourself whether he is having disillusions or not makes you very sympathetic toward Nash. Living in a time of conspiracy theory and government cover-ups, I kept siding with Nash. You can feel his terror as his world comes crumbling down as he discovers whole areas of his life as not being dead or gone forever, as Nash's psychologist Dr. Rosen says, but never existing in the first place.If you are familiar with Nash's life or you have been reading reviews of the movie and know Nash is mentally ill, this very powerful part loses most of its impact. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a better film not for Nash aficionados (if there is such a thing) but for those who nothing about him.His wife helps him through this very tough time in his life. This illness produces a great amount of stress on his marriage. The love and support of his wife is what gets him through his illness, and without her Nash would have spiraled out of control. While a beautiful mind is a true blessing, Nash learns that his smarts won't solve this problem. It's the connection with his wife, the power of the human heart that will keep his life balanced and ordered.A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a testament to the support and love of two people for one another.

590659,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,B00005JKQZ,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[11, 13]","Back in February 2002, week, my wife, our son, and I made an unusual evening foray to the town nearest our home having a theater in it.  The theater is one of those multiplexes (yes, Maine does have `em!!) with 14 theaters in the same building.  After driving the 32 miles to the theater complex, we found ourselves faced with a veritable treasure trove of excellent choices... among them ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""John Q,""  ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.""  We opted for ""A Beautiful Mind,"" mainly because it looked like the movie that would be the most interesting to all three of us, and because we've always enjoyed movies directed by Ron Howard.""A Beautiful Mind,"" winner of the ""Best Picture"" Oscar at the most recent Academy Awards, is perhaps one of the finest movies we've seen in quite some time!  Starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer, this movie held all of us spellbound for its entire two-plus hour running time.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" features a superb cast, an outstanding story line (based on actual persons and events) and a wonderful script.""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the story of John Forbes Nash, a brilliant mathematician whose  pioneering work on game theory ultimately won for him the Nobel Prize in Economics, but whose ""beautiful mind..."" brilliant as it was... was tortured by the most debilitating form mental illness imaginable: paranoid schizophrenia.Everything about this movie is superb!  Russell Crowe is magnificent as the tortured genius John Nash.  From quiet, nervous, socially inept scholar, to intense code-breaker, to delusional mental patient, Crowe keeps viewers constantly on the edge of their seats with his completely believable interpretation of the mind of  a schizophrenic.  It is, in my view, Crowe's best performance ever... and there have been a lot of good ones!Jennifer Connelly is excellent as Alicia Nash.  Appearing next to Crowe must have been rather daunting for her.  She not only held her own next to the man who is rapidly becoming one of  Hollywood's truly great actors; she illuminated her scenes with her own considerable talent.  In Connelly's capable hands, her character shows tenderness, compassion, and a strength of character that must have been the hallmark of the real person she so capably portrays.Ed Harris brings his usual superlative skills as a character actor to the role of the shadowy William Parcher, the man who recruits Nash into the world of Cold War code-breaking.After the acting, the most impressive feature of ""A Beautiful Mind"" is the technique director Ron Howard uses to portray the phantasmic state of John Nash's mind.  I don't want to offer too many details here, for to do so would be to provide a major ""spoiler"" for those who haven't seen the movie yet.  Suffice it to say, the technique is surprising and very effective.  Viewers may occasionally feel themselves a bit unsure of where the story is going (as I did), but rest assured... everything is made clear by the end of the film.Before we watched ""A Beautiful Mind,"" I had seen a television interview with director Ron Howard in which he talked about the making of the film.  In this interview, Howard stated that he had decided, as much as possible, to shoot in chronological order... in other words, the earliest scenes were shot first, the latest scenes last.  According to Howard, this is a technique hardly ever used by directors; he attributes much of the movie's best qualities to shooting in sequential order.I tend to agree with Howard's assessment of his own work.  The movie has a decidedly ensemble-like feel to it despite a relatively large cast.  Everyone is so good in their part, and every scene flows so seamlessly into the one that follows that it seemed to us, throughout the film's two-plus hour running time, like we were witnesses to an actual unfolding drama.  I seriously doubt that ""A Beautiful Mind"" would have been as intensely dramatic or as effective a vehicle for such a highly complex, intelligently told story.If you haven't guessed by now, my wife, our son, and I are unanimous in our verdict on ""A Beautiful Mind:"" this film is a ""must see."".

590660,A2H2AJY184XDS3,B00005JKQZ,Mike Williams,"[0, 0]","This film is based on the life of John Nash, the brilliant, Nobel winning mathematician and his extraordinary relationship with his wife, Alicia. I use the words `based on' deliberately as the film significantly strays from actual events and brings the spirit of Nash's life to the screen rather than being a true-to-life biopic. For those who want to learn more, I suggest Sylvia Nasar's book `The Beautiful Mind', which was also the source for the film. I do not want to say too much about the plot as if you have not yet seen the film, it will spoil the effect. The film attempts to put you inside Nash's head and experience events just as he did. For me, it worked extremely well. Try not to find out too much beforehand if you want to savour the full effect. Rest assured, however, that the film is very much about the human story of Nash and his devoted wife. The math, whilst integrated into the film in a variety of innovative and entertaining ways - the explanation of game theory has never been more interesting - remains in the background. The acting is superb: Russell Crow is revelatory in the role and how he missed out on an Oscar is hard to fathom. Jennifer Connelly did win an Oscar for her performance as Nash's wife, and the film also took best picture, best screenplay, and best director awards. They were well deserved. For a thoughtful, deeply moving, and incredibly inspiring film: this is it. If you manage to watch it without knowing too much about the contents beforehand, it can also be disorientating as well - just as Nash experienced his life.",5,An absolutely stunning performance from Russell Crow,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1573,"['film', 'based', 'life', 'John', 'Nash', 'brilliant', 'Nobel', 'winning', 'mathematician', 'extraordinary', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Alicia', 'use', 'words', 'based', 'deliberately', 'film', 'significantly', 'actual', 'events', 'spirit', 'Nash', 'life', 'screen', 'rather', 'being', 'true-to-life', 'biopic', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'suggest', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'book', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'was', 'also', 'source', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'spoil', 'effect', 'film', 'attempts', 'put', 'Nash', 'head', 'experience', 'events', 'just', 'did', 'worked', 'extremely', 'well', 'Try', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'beforehand', 'want', 'savour', 'full', 'effect', 'Rest', 'assured', 'however', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'story', 'Nash', 'devoted', 'wife', 'math', 'whilst', 'integrated', 'film', 'variety', 'innovative', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'explanation', 'game', 'theory', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'background', 'acting', 'superb', 'Russell', 'Crow', 'revelatory', 'role', 'how', 'missed', 'out', 'Oscar', 'hard', 'fathom', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'did', 'win', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Nash', 'wife', 'film', 'also', 'took', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'screenplay', 'best', 'director', 'awards', 'were', 'well', 'deserved', 'thoughtful', 'deeply', 'moving', 'incredibly', 'inspiring', 'film', 'manage', 'watch', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'contents', 'beforehand', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'disorientating', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'Nash', 'experienced', 'life']",N/A
590661,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JKQZ,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[0, 1]","I always thought that mathematics could drive a person crazy.After watching A Beautiful Mind, I could verify that my theory is not absolutely preposterous.This drama based on a real life history presents Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematical genius whose mind goes through an intense trip from health to madness to health again. The complexity of the brain and its effects in human behavior are explored with a clarifying view in this film.Nash's story begins in 1947, when the ""mysterious genius of West Virginia"" arrives at Princeton to attend his studies. Obsessed with come up with a really original idea, Nash is most of the time solving complicated equations in the library, in the large windows of his room and even in the bar where he hangs out with his competitive companions.And it is on a simple day that the idea appears suddenly. His study in the theory of the game audaciously contradicts the Adam Smith's doctrine. One hundred and fifty years of accepted ideas suddenly are not fashionable anymore and Nash's life changes forever. Now working at the recognized MIT, Nash becomes involved with some Cold War investigations, while simultaneously his personal life gives a complete turn when he meets Alicia, a physics student and eventually, his future wife.But the dreamed life of Nash soon crumbles when they diagnose him paranoid schizophrenia. His genius becomes cloudy and from that moment, Nash must fight to apply the logic - the one that once served him to solve complicated theorems- to the disease that every day tries to moves him away more from reality.Narrated from Nash's point of view, the movie tries to baffle us by mixing reality with fantasy; a technique that effectively makes us understand how confused a mind can get.Russell Crowe offers a dramatic interpretation as Nash, as we see him age 40 years in screen. The actor takes a comfortable ride through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses. Desolated by the disease of her husband, Alicia fights under pressure to continue loving the upset genius and offering the emotional support that he needs so much.Although inevitably the movie falls with its sentimentality, A Beautiful Mind is a film that's worth watching. Is not about mathematics or the important merits Nash offered to the world. It's about his genius, and how he accomplished to control his delirious and how he became not only a person with a truly great mind, but also with a great heart.",4,The labyrinths of the mind,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,2621,"['always', 'thought', 'mathematics', 'could', 'drive', 'person', 'crazy.After', 'watching', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'could', 'verify', 'theory', 'not', 'absolutely', 'preposterous.This', 'drama', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'history', 'presents', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'Jr', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'mind', 'intense', 'trip', 'health', 'madness', 'health', 'again', 'complexity', 'brain', 'effects', 'human', 'behavior', 'are', 'explored', 'clarifying', 'view', 'film.Nash', 'story', '1947', 'when', 'mysterious', 'genius', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Princeton', 'attend', 'studies', 'Obsessed', 'come', 'up', 'really', 'original', 'idea', 'Nash', 'most', 'time', 'solving', 'complicated', 'equations', 'library', 'large', 'windows', 'room', 'even', 'bar', 'where', 'out', 'competitive', 'companions.And', 'simple', 'day', 'idea', 'suddenly', 'study', 'theory', 'game', 'audaciously', 'Adam', 'Smith', 'doctrine', 'One', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'years', 'accepted', 'ideas', 'suddenly', 'are', 'not', 'fashionable', 'anymore', 'Nash', 'life', 'changes', 'forever', 'Now', 'working', 'recognized', 'MIT', 'Nash', 'involved', 'Cold', 'War', 'investigations', 'simultaneously', 'personal', 'life', 'complete', 'turn', 'when', 'Alicia', 'physics', 'student', 'eventually', 'future', 'dreamed', 'life', 'Nash', 'soon', 'crumbles', 'when', 'diagnose', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'genius', 'cloudy', 'moment', 'Nash', 'must', 'fight', 'apply', 'logic', 'one', 'once', 'served', 'solve', 'complicated', 'theorems-', 'disease', 'day', 'moves', 'away', 'more', 'reality.Narrated', 'Nash', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'baffle', 'mixing', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'technique', 'effectively', 'understand', 'how', 'confused', 'mind', 'can', 'get.Russell', 'Crowe', 'dramatic', 'interpretation', 'Nash', 'see', 'age', '40', 'years', 'screen', 'actor', 'comfortable', 'ride', 'different', 'facets', 'Nash', 'safe', 'arrogant', 'genius', 'lost', 'tormented', 'man', 's', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'demons.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Alicia', 'complements', 'Crowe', 'senses', 'Desolated', 'disease', 'husband', 'Alicia', 'fights', 'pressure', 'continue', 'loving', 'upset', 'genius', 'offering', 'emotional', 'support', 'so', 'much.Although', 'inevitably', 'movie', 'sentimentality', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'mathematics', 'important', 'merits', 'Nash', 'offered', 'world', 'genius', 'how', 'accomplished', 'control', 'delirious', 'how', 'became', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'truly', 'great', 'mind', 'also', 'great', 'heart']",N/A

The supporting cast are just as good with Ed Harris and jennifer Connely turning in the best performances though the other cast are no slouches by any means.This is a movie to be respected and taken on its merits of mature moviemaking. It may not be as flashy as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; or as mind-bending as &quot;Memento,&quot; but it is a movie not to miss.

590668,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JKQZ,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 1]","Howard's latest movie, and winner of several awards, concerns the genius, home life and mental illness of John Nash (Crowe).  Taking us through his college years up to when he won the Nobel Prize, 'A Beautiful Mind' is an assured, open and often very moving film.  Crowe proves that his performances in 'Gladiator' and 'The Insider' weren't flukes, with a showy but bravely unsympathetic role.  Many decried that playing the madman was an easy option, which maybe would have been the case with any lesser actor, but anyone who watches Crowe in the early scenes, a bumbling, nervous, self-righteous college graduate can testify that this was certainly no easy option.  Indeed, shrugging off the action stereotype that might have come with his last role was surely no easy feat but Crowe makes you forget Maximus of Spain completely here.Of course, that isn't wishing to forget the dazzling tour de force that is Jennifer Connelly.  Watching her act, the word 'actress of a generation' often springs to mind, and like Crowe she has proven her determination not to be typecast.  Her role here is as far removed from her performance as drug-addled Marion Crane in 'Requiem For A Dream' as it could possibly be.  A lesser performer may have been tempted to simply allow the script do the work (after all, she could basically have been a mere housewife) but it is in the reflection of Nash's madness in his wife's eyes that makes it so horrific.  You get the feeling that the occasionally unrealistic portrayal of schizofrenia have been made more romantic (there is only about one hospital scene) so as to ensure that the movie's rating was kept down.  However, through two magnificent performances the audience is allowed a real insight into not just how madness affects one person but the people around him.Whilst Howard's earlier movies such as 'Apollo 13' were assured but ultimately formulaic, he really shows himself to be a very talented director indeed on this which is probably his best film to date.  Thankfully rather than wallowing in period detail he wisely chooses to take it slow, injecting a good deal of characterisation and a very honest and therefore moving portrayal of a relationship on the edge.  Even if this doesn't quite rank up there with 'Hilary And Jackie', it is still one of the best biopics of recent years and a milestone for all concerned.",4,The best Ron Howard movie to date,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,2366,"['Howard', 'latest', 'movie', 'winner', 'several', 'awards', 'genius', 'home', 'life', 'mental', 'illness', 'John', 'Nash', 'Crowe', 'Taking', 'college', 'years', 'up', 'when', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'assured', 'open', 'often', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'Crowe', 'performances', ""'Gladiator"", ""'The"", 'Insider', 'were', ""n't"", 'flukes', 'showy', 'bravely', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'Many', 'decried', 'playing', 'madman', 'was', 'easy', 'option', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'lesser', 'actor', 'anyone', 'who', 'Crowe', 'early', 'scenes', 'bumbling', 'nervous', 'self-righteous', 'college', 'graduate', 'can', 'testify', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'easy', 'option', 'Indeed', 'shrugging', 'off', 'action', 'stereotype', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'last', 'role', 'was', 'surely', 'easy', 'feat', 'Crowe', 'forget', 'Maximus', 'Spain', 'completely', 'here.Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'wishing', 'forget', 'dazzling', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Watching', 'act', 'word', ""'actress"", 'generation', 'often', 'springs', 'mind', 'Crowe', 'proven', 'determination', 'not', 'be', 'typecast', 'role', 'here', 'far', 'removed', 'performance', 'drug-addled', 'Marion', 'Crane', ""'Requiem"", 'A', 'Dream', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'lesser', 'performer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'simply', 'allow', 'script', 'do', 'work', 'could', 'basically', 'have', 'been', 'mere', 'housewife', 'reflection', 'Nash', 'madness', 'wife', 'eyes', 'so', 'horrific', 'get', 'feeling', 'occasionally', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'schizofrenia', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'romantic', 'only', 'one', 'hospital', 'scene', 'so', 'ensure', 'movie', 'rating', 'was', 'kept', 'down', 'However', 'two', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'audience', 'allowed', 'real', 'insight', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'madness', 'one', 'person', 'people', 'him.Whilst', 'Howard', 'earlier', 'movies', 'such', '13', 'were', 'assured', 'ultimately', 'formulaic', 'really', 'be', 'very', 'talented', 'director', 'indeed', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'Thankfully', 'rather', 'wallowing', 'period', 'detail', 'wisely', 'take', 'slow', 'injecting', 'good', 'deal', 'characterisation', 'very', 'honest', 'therefore', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'edge', 'Even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rank', 'up', 'there', ""'Hilary"", 'Jackie', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'biopics', 'recent', 'years', 'milestone', 'concerned']",N/A
590669,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKQZ,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 2]","A Beautiful Mind is Directed by Ron Howard, and stars Russell Crowe in a critically acclaimed performance as John Nash, a mathematical genius struggling to overcome schizophrenia, in this `based on a true story', triumph over adversity tale.Playing the mentally or physically ill has always been a fast-track to critical and Oscar success. Since 1945, approximately 20 actors and actresses have received Oscars for playing people with some sort of disability including most recently; Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot), Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman), Geoffrey Rush (Shine) and Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted). However, Russell Crowe narrowly (and somewhat controversially) missed out on his second Oscar even though A Beautiful Mind still triumphed on Oscar night winning Best Picture and Best Director at the 74th Annual Academy Awards.Much debate still rumbles on as to whether or not Russell Crowe deserved to win his second Oscar and whether or not his ill-tempered display at the British Academy Awards cost him his second golden statuette. With this in mind I was intrigued to eventually dust down the DVD my wife had given me for Christmas and to cast a critical eye over this (in many ways) controversial movie.First off, let me start by saying that if you already know that John Nash is/was schizophrenic (and lets face it who doesn't?) then the surprise (and indeed) suspense element of this movie is already spoilt. For it is then easy to guess from very early on in the movie that Russell Crowe's character may be hallucinating and experiencing paranoid delusions. Having studied mental illness and worked with people suffering from schizophrenia another major problem I found with `A Beautiful Mind' is just how saccharine sweet it all is with the real difficulties of schizophrenia being somewhat diluted (if only it was that easy) in what is a very commercial film.Of course, all Hollywood biographies tend to smooth out the rough edges but it is more than a little disappointing that many of the more interesting facts about Nash's life and his relationships are overlooked. For example there is no mention of the fact that his wife divorced and later re-married him, or his illegitimate and shizophrenic son (conceived with another woman before his marriage) or his alleged homosexual/bisexual tendencies, which saw him arrested in 1954. The last omission in particular leaves me to conclude that according to Hollywood morality and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (responsible for the lamentable Batman and Robin) it is okay to be insane as long as you're not gay.That said however, there are some very good things about A Beautiful Mind and Russell Crowe is at the centre of most of them. For it is his often understated and considered performance that makes A Beautiful Mind a very watchable movie and lifts it above your average Hollywood fare. Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly in particular also offer fine support and it is always a pleasure to see Ed Harris in pretty much any movie. To be fair, Ron Howard also directs this movie skilfully if somewhat by the numbers and Akiva Goldsman's screenplay builds an interesting if somewhat commercial plot, which would be fine if it were not so sugar-coated.In summary, five stars should be awarded to Russell Crowe (and the rest of the cast) but otherwise this is a 3 star movie.

True, the movie isn't really deep and can't be considered as a documentry movie on the &quot;life and math of John Nash&quot;, yet, it is focusing on the more human part of Nash, the husband, the father, the geniuse and the &quot;carzy&quot;. After I watched this movie and got impressed from Nash's humanity, I went home and learned more about his math. The charming simplisity of the movie, in my opinion, turns on your curiosity, and after you saw the movie you go and read the book, and go and learn more about Nash's discoveries.

But, an hour in, my patience was sorely tested: a jumbled intro, some sketchy back-story exposition, and the film makes a hard left hand turn and appears to veer into low-rent Bond territory; Ed Harris appearing as a mysterious, over-hammed Chandleresque government dude, shooting up Russian infiltrates, and spouting the most hackneyed dialogue you'll find outside a Bruce Willis disaster flick. As the minutes pass the likelihood of the film pulling itself out of this spectacular swan dive appreciably diminishes, and in fact I had concluded that all hope was lost; this was just a clunker and the Oscar rout a sham, when blow me if it didn't pull out at the very last minute, like some Red Arrow pilot at an air show, with what Leonard Maltin correctly describes as &quot;a doozy&quot; of a plot twist. I won't give it away: just watch.So, having so deftly leapt out of the frying pan, imagine the disappointment when the real film, struggling to get out from the faux over-lay, turns out to be a routine Sunday Sickness matinee, spiced up at the end by a poorly worked in redemption scene. The closing, teary vibe has Ron Howard written all over it - just like Robin Williams can never escape the fact that he was Mork from Ork, Howard will for ever be Richie Cunningham, and this is every inch a film made by a mummy's boy from suburban Milwaukee. Not nearly enough Fonz in it for me.Not exactly assisting matters is Horner's music, which offers the same subtle pleasure and impish inventiveness as his score for Titanic. That's sarcasm, folks.Russell Crowe deserves a mention for portraying a dislikable geek &amp; nutcase so well, never an easy stunt for a Hollywood hunk (Ralph Fiennes made a meal of the same job in Red Dragon), and Jennifer Connelly plays the long suffering spouse nicely. The last film I saw her in was Labyrinth, so she's come on a bit.Ron Howard pulled a few pretty cool tricks, and ultimately this film is pleasant enough to watch.

This film, who's only redeeming quality is Russell Crowe's marvelous performance(Say what you want about the man's personal life, you cannot deny that he can act), is dull and lifeless. In fact, without that performance, the film is little better than a TV movie of the week.The story, following the life of Mathmatician John Nash, is plagued by the dull pacing and scant charachterization that only Akiva Goldsman, the writer of such classics as ""Lost in Space"" and ""Batman & Robin"", can provide. Only the Nash charachter is given any insight, as Jennifer Connelley's charachter, Nash's wife Alicia, is little more than a cipher, her reasons for loving Nash never explained, as Nash appears downright unlovable. I would say that her winning an Oscar for this and Crowe's being passed over is akin to Kim Basinger winning for ""LA Confidential"" and Crowe not even being nominated, except that ""Confidential"" was so much better a film, that the comparison would be insulting.The direction is standard Ron Howard, which is to say workmanlike, hetting the job done, with few stylistic flashes, and not much else. He fails to elicit much from any actor besides Crowe, and since Crowe has publicly said that Opie let him ""be himself""(read: let him do whatever he wanted), the director deserves little of teh credut he gets. Make no mistake, I like most of Ron Howards movies, but have never considered them Oscar Worthy, with the exception of Apollo 13, which was had a superior script and superior actors.The biggest problem with the story is in how Nash overcomes his mental problems. He goes, in a montage, from being a paranoid to a nobel winner without any explination for his progress besides ""love"". Cute, but it doesn't wash. There is much to Nash's battle with his demons to be praised, but the movie glosses over the ""how"" so that it can show you how great what he did was. If only they showed how he did it.In the end, Crowe was the only one worthy of an award for this film. Everything else is plain and uninvolving.

Look at the subject matter: a withdrawn, socially inept mathematical genius comes up with a ""Big Idea,"" has a nervous breakdown, wins a Nobel Prize, and lives happily ever after! (Not the usual mindless ""blockbuster"" fodder that fills the multiplexes!)Okay, so that's a rather trite summing up of the film, but the story of John Forbes Nash is an inspiration in itself, and this filmed version, as opposed to the book, which I have not as yet read, has an immediacy that grabs you and immerses you in the troubled mind of our, ultimately, likeable and sympathetic hero.Nash didn't have a nervous breakdown per-se, but suffered from schizophrenia for most of his adult life. Not wishing to spoil the film for you if you haven't seen it already, all I will say is that Nash saw and experienced people and situations that were pure figments of his imagination, driven by the secrecy and paranoia of a McCarthy era Reds-under-the-Bed state of mind, Nash became unable to distinguish fantasy from reality.Nash's moment of revelation, his epiphany, came when he almost hurt his wife and child. From that moment on he became `self-aware' in a way that few people, I suspect, are capable of, he `reasoned' that he was `mad' and simply chose ignore the product of his madness, his visions and hallucinations. They remained with him, and as far as I know still do, but through shear force of will, he controlled them and integrated them into his everyday existence. They no longer had any power over him; he was, and is, in control of his life.His Nobel Prize came about when a later generation of economists and analysts rediscovered his ""Big Idea,"" and he was finally given the recognition that was long overdue. Without us knowing it, Nash's theories and equations touch us all as we live in a free-market economy.""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautifully made film that I can't recommend highly enough. The difficult mathematical aspect of the film is handled in such a way as to make it immediately accessible to a non-Nash genius, and shouldn't put you off.

In the meantime, Nash falls in love with and marries the beautiful Alicia with whom he starts a family.  Alicia is stunned to find out about his affliction and her support and love is tested and tried throughout the film.

590696,A1VQCSMMJCAPG6,B00005JKQZ,"P. McGrath ""prmcgr""","[11, 14]","It's hard to fault &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; for the performances or, for that matter, the direction.  Crowe and Connelly are superb, and believable, as the brain-sick mathemetician and his long-suffering wife.  The film does move along with nice pacing and it's not an effort to become emotionally involved in their lives.  Frankly, where the film fails are those scenes that depart from their relationship and bring us closer to the film's namesake, the so-called &quot;Beautiful Mind&quot; of John Nash.Frankly, neither John Nash, nor his mind, are in the tiniest sense made &quot;beautiful&quot; by this film.  The man, an eccentric genius laid low by paranoid schizophrenia, is sympathetic only in the sense that one might feel sympathy for anyone who is mentally ill.  Sure, it's sort of interesting that he eventually won the Nobel Prize Winner for his mathematic theories but when the film tries to explain those theories, the viewer gets only the most rudimentary insight into what must really be a fascinating, somehow mathematically based, theory of economics and human nature.  Naturally, the script writers assumed that most viewers wouldn't be interested in anything more than third grade arithmetic, and leave it to Nash to scribble heiroglyphic equations on windows, blackboards, and anything else he gets his hands on to show how &quot;complex&quot; his theories must be without really attempting to explain how they work.The same holds true for his mental disease.  Most psychiatrists attribute the development of severe mental illness, such as paranoid schizophrenia, to a combination of genetic (family history) and environmental (infant/childhood trauma) factors.  This film discloses nothing about this man's life prior to graduate school.  He simply acquires his mental illness without any explanation, whatsoever.  The audience is supposed to swoon with sympathy for his plight and, in fact, based on the film's box office (and the Academy), apparently, a lot of folks apparently found Crowe's performance affecting.  Indeed, it is to Crowe's everlasting credit that he made the character he played into someone to whom audiences could relate.Once again, though, one is left wanting to know more.  Why did Nash create the imaginary characters that populate his diseased mind?  One can, given the times (mid 1950's) imagine why an anti-communist operative (played wonderfully by Ed Harris) is one of his spectres, but why the gregarious room-mate, and (especially) why the room-mate's young adoptive daughter?  What in Nash's past, if anything, prompt these denizens to constantly plague his life?  No clue is given.I suppose the real goals of this film were: (i) show what it really &quot;must be like&quot; to be trapped in a paranoid delusion, and (ii) avoid being to be too much like a documentary on Nash's life.  In other words, &quot;entertainment&quot; - not insight - was the operative goal.  But haven't we all been down this road at least two dozen times?  From the manipulative recent (and decent) &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; all the way back to Boris Karloff, we've all been duped by Hollywood trickery into believing one set of assumptions until a dopey mutt pulls the curtain and reveals the Wizard to be an old putz.  It's the same with this film: is he a schizo, or isn't he?  Of course, this film is based on a real guy so you have to assume he IS a schizo from scene one.  Still, we audiences love getting that curtain pulled.  Sad, isn't it, that the Academy, and the American public, still gape over the same recycled bilge.  Gosh, now I know what it REALLY must be like to be paranoid.  These crazy M.O.'s really BELIEVE their delusions!  For a awhile there, even I believed it!  Whoah!In other words, this movie is pure HOLLWOOD.  Take it for what it is.OK, &quot;A Beatiful Mind&quot; is a beautifully filmed and scored movie, and the performances are truly solid.  What fails is the script, which relies on the same, tired Hollywood formula and truly fails to inform us in any meaningful way about John Nash, his theories, or his demons.",3,"Good Performances, Thin Script",1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,4084,"['hard', 'fault', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'performances', 'matter', 'direction', 'Crowe', 'Connelly', 'are', 'superb', 'believable', 'brain-sick', 'mathemetician', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'film', 'move', 'nice', 'pacing', 'not', 'effort', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'lives', 'Frankly', 'where', 'film', 'fails', 'are', 'scenes', 'depart', 'relationship', 'bring', 'closer', 'film', 'namesake', 'so-called', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'John', 'Nash.Frankly', 'neither', 'John', 'Nash', 'mind', 'are', 'tiniest', 'sense', 'made', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'film', 'man', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'laid', 'low', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'sympathetic', 'only', 'sense', 'one', 'might', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'anyone', 'who', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Sure', 'sort', 'interesting', 'eventually', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'mathematic', 'theories', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'explain', 'theories', 'viewer', 'only', 'most', 'rudimentary', 'insight', 'what', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'fascinating', 'somehow', 'mathematically', 'based', 'theory', 'economics', 'human', 'nature', 'Naturally', 'script', 'writers', 'assumed', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'anything', 'more', 'third', 'grade', 'arithmetic', 'leave', 'Nash', 'scribble', 'heiroglyphic', 'equations', 'windows', 'blackboards', 'anything', 'else', 'hands', 'show', 'how', 'quot', 'complex', 'quot', 'theories', 'must', 'be', 'really', 'attempting', 'explain', 'how', 'work.The', 'same', 'true', 'mental', 'disease', 'Most', 'psychiatrists', 'attribute', 'development', 'severe', 'mental', 'illness', 'such', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'combination', 'genetic', 'family', 'history', 'environmental', 'infant/childhood', 'trauma', 'factors', 'film', 'nothing', 'man', 'life', 'prior', 'graduate', 'school', 'simply', 'mental', 'illness', 'explanation', 'whatsoever', 'audience', 'supposed', 'swoon', 'sympathy', 'plight', 'fact', 'based', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'Academy', 'apparently', 'lot', 'folks', 'apparently', 'found', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'affecting', 'Indeed', 'Crowe', 'everlasting', 'credit', 'made', 'character', 'played', 'someone', 'whom', 'audiences', 'could', 'relate.Once', 'again', 'one', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'Why', 'did', 'Nash', 'create', 'imaginary', 'characters', 'populate', 'diseased', 'mind', 'One', 'can', 'given', 'times', 'mid', '1950', 'imagine', 'why', 'anti-communist', 'operative', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'one', 'spectres', 'why', 'gregarious', 'room-mate', 'especially', 'why', 'room-mate', 'young', 'adoptive', 'daughter', 'What', 'Nash', 'past', 'anything', 'prompt', 'denizens', 'constantly', 'plague', 'life', 'clue', 'given.I', 'suppose', 'real', 'goals', 'film', 'were', 'i', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'quot', 'must', 'be', 'quot', 'be', 'trapped', 'paranoid', 'delusion', 'ii', 'avoid', 'being', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'documentary', 'Nash', 'life', 'other', 'words', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'not', 'insight', 'was', 'operative', 'goal', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'road', 'least', 'two', 'dozen', 'times', 'manipulative', 'recent', 'decent', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'way', 'back', 'Boris', 'Karloff', ""'ve"", 'been', 'duped', 'Hollywood', 'trickery', 'believing', 'one', 'set', 'assumptions', 'dopey', 'mutt', 'curtain', 'Wizard', 'be', 'old', 'putz', 'same', 'film', 'schizo', ""n't"", 'course', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'guy', 'so', 'have', 'assume', 'schizo', 'scene', 'one', 'Still', 'audiences', 'love', 'getting', 'curtain', 'pulled', 'Sad', ""n't"", 'Academy', 'American', 'public', 'still', 'gape', 'same', 'recycled', 'bilge', 'Gosh', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'REALLY', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'paranoid', 'crazy', 'M.O', 'really', 'BELIEVE', 'delusions', 'awhile', 'there', 'even', 'believed', 'Whoah', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'pure', 'HOLLWOOD', 'Take', 'what', 'quot', 'Beatiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'scored', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'truly', 'solid', 'What', 'script', 'same', 'tired', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'truly', 'fails', 'inform', 'meaningful', 'way', 'John', 'Nash', 'theories', 'demons']",N/A

Somehow he wins over all his college chums, despite treating them like stinky cheese - I'd like to know why.

Perhaps he should have repeated his straight-forward proposal of copulation which won him the lovely Jen-Con.I only wish I'd been paying attention to movies when this won the Academy Award (C) so that I could listen to the sort of pretentious jerks who ran out and learned everything they could about his Blonde-Poking economic theory and exposited on its brilliance while also jawing on about the brilliance of this film and Crowe's brilliance (did he even break a sweat?) and so on.

590702,A3D6A6TLK9S60N,B00005JKQZ,R. David Roe,"[3, 4]","In his younger days John Nash struggled to define himself from others through his mathematical brilliance. He did so often at the expense of the human relationships that grounded him to this world. As he himself has later stated, madness can be viewed as a type of conformity. John Nash's fear of conformity -- of being ordinary -- perhaps fueled the onset of schizophrenia that jeopardized his career, his relationships, and everything he held dear.I read ""A Beautiful Mind"" long before the book became a movie. While the film skews some of the facts surrounding Nash's illness, Akiva Goldman's brilliant screenplay does so only in attempt to help the moviegoer visualize the nature of one man's delusions -- his internal demons. Purists who would deny the filmmaker a certain license with facts would have to settle for a book which was in many ways, unfilmable.Thank you, Ron Howard, for taking what was (for me) the most compelling biography of the last decade and bringing it to film. Your movie never shies from the failings of its subject, nor does it allow Nash's shortcomings to obscure his intellectual and human promise. We live in a world in which we are taught to distrust what is good in others. In which a single human flaw in our public figures is somehow allowed to negate the weight of their achievements. (Their failures keep them ""like us,"" and we don't like what we have become.) This movie is not afraid to offer us a flawed hero. The film reaches for a level of pathos and empathy for Nash that surpasses even that achieved by the book and which left me in tears. Not an easy task.This is a story about the ascendance of genius, its descent into madness, and the redeeming quality of love. It is not a perfect movie. There are moments of awkwardness early in the film as it struggles to communicate the nature of Nash's genius. That's okay. Most of these scenes are well handled and some are quite amusing. Genius is not an easy thing to illustrate without leaving most of us in the dust. There are many movies I rent once and move on to the next. Others I watch over and over through the years, always finding something new or at least a reminder of something I should not forget.

I am not a Russell Crowe hater, but I feel that he is a slightly overrated actor. I don't really think he deserved last year's Oscar for best actor in GLADIATOR, especially if he is being nominated for this year's best actor, too. One Oscar at at time should be enough. I think they should give this year's best actor award to either Tom Wilkinson for IN THE BEDROOM or Sean Penn for I AM SAM. But most likely though, it'll go to Russell Crowe--again.In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Russell Crowe portrays the real life person of John Nash. Nash is a genius with a troubled past, but eventually subsides it and wins the Nobel Prize. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as Nash's wife. It reminded me of GOOD WILL HUNTING, which is a much better motion picture than A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Ron Howard does an excellent directing job, but this year's Oscar for best director should go to Peter Jackson, who directed THE LORD OF THE RINGS.It's not the best film of the year, and I do not totally agree with all the praised reviews from professional movie critics, but it is a good film.

He distances himself from the other students with his introverted and eccentric behavior and admits he doesn't really like people. He is so consumed with thought, he neglects his most basic needs and becomes so absorbed in his own serene thought processes he forgets to eat and sleep.In fact, no one can really relate to him until he meets a beautiful student who attends one of his classes. Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) seems to have the patience to work through situations in real life, that Nash doesn't have time for or is not concerned with. His mind won't let him deal with real life and he is tossed into an unrealistic fantasy by delusions that seek to destroy him. Alicia falls for his mind, they marry and her emotional IQ is so high that she truly shows her husband unconditional love.He enters an imaginary life in which he helps the government break codes in magazines. His wife becomes increasingly aware of his mental condition and tries to help him see what reality truly is. She needs to believe that something extraordinary is feasible. She believes he can conquer anything. The problem is, he is suffering from a mental illness which is seeking to destroy his world.As he descends into a world of his own making, schizophrenia takes over and he has to take medications that interfere with his ability to ""do his job."" This causes him immense grief and he lacks purpose. His job actually turns out to be completely of his own imagination. This espionage part of the story is absorbing and exciting. The emotional elements are highly rewarding and the actual love story was for me at least, overwhelmingly beautiful.Through John Nash's life he learns what is truly important and in that is the true beauty of this story. Ron Howard shows genius in his ability to so capture your heart with his directing.A Beautiful Mind will draw from you those exquisite emotions only a story of great depth and sensitivity can. The characters are genuinely persuasive and screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman crafted one of the most intelligent scripts to date. An exceptional score reflects a complex backdrop of emotions and in this mirror of music the rays of reflection will touch your soul.A Beautiful Mind is an eloquent portrayal of John Nash's life with an emphasis on the emotional torment mental illness can evoke contrast with the sheer beauty of love.Highly Recommended!~The Rebecca Review",5,Love and the Beauty of Life,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,2859,"['Only', 'who', 'know', 'supremacy', 'intellectual', 'life-the', 'life', 'seed', 'ennobling', 'thought', 'purpose', 'it-can', 'understand', 'grief', 'one', 'who', 'serene', 'activity', 'absorbing', 'soul-wasting', 'struggle', 'worldly', 'annoyances', '-George', 'EliotIn', 'September', '1947', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'John', 'Nash', 'time', 'attempting', 'distinguish', 'completely', 'original', 'idea', 'Princeton', 'University', 'lieu', 'attending', 'classes', 'other', 'students', 'introverted', 'eccentric', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'people', 'so', 'consumed', 'thought', 'most', 'basic', 'needs', 'becomes', 'so', 'absorbed', 'own', 'serene', 'thought', 'eat', 'sleep.In', 'fact', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'beautiful', 'student', 'who', 'one', 'classes', 'Alicia', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'have', 'patience', 'work', 'situations', 'real', 'life', 'Nash', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'not', 'concerned', 'mind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'deal', 'real', 'life', 'tossed', 'unrealistic', 'fantasy', 'delusions', 'seek', 'destroy', 'Alicia', 'mind', 'marry', 'emotional', 'IQ', 'so', 'high', 'truly', 'husband', 'unconditional', 'love.He', 'enters', 'imaginary', 'life', 'government', 'break', 'codes', 'magazines', 'wife', 'increasingly', 'aware', 'mental', 'condition', 'tries', 'help', 'see', 'what', 'reality', 'truly', 'believe', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'feasible', 'can', 'conquer', 'anything', 'problem', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illness', 'seeking', 'destroy', 'world.As', 'world', 'own', 'making', 'schizophrenia', 'take', 'medications', 'interfere', 'ability', 'do', 'job', 'immense', 'grief', 'purpose', 'job', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'own', 'imagination', 'espionage', 'part', 'story', 'absorbing', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'elements', 'are', 'highly', 'rewarding', 'actual', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'least', 'overwhelmingly', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'true', 'beauty', 'story', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'genius', 'ability', 'so', 'capture', 'heart', 'directing.A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'will', 'draw', 'exquisite', 'emotions', 'only', 'story', 'great', 'depth', 'sensitivity', 'can', 'characters', 'are', 'genuinely', 'persuasive', 'screenwriter', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'crafted', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'scripts', 'date', 'exceptional', 'score', 'complex', 'backdrop', 'emotions', 'mirror', 'music', 'rays', 'reflection', 'will', 'touch', 'soul.A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'eloquent', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'emphasis', 'emotional', 'torment', 'mental', 'illness', 'can', 'evoke', 'contrast', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'love.Highly', 'Recommended', '~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

590707,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKQZ,Reviewer,"[16, 20]","As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is ""real"" to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's ""reality"" exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" starring Russell Crowe.Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose ""Equilibrium n-tuple"" is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably ""different,"" not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early `50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's ""life"" we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a ""movie star,"" but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like ""Requiem For A Dream"" and ""Waking the Dead""), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia.  Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.",5,"Howard, Crowe Bring

It deserves attention... and director Ron Howard did a wonderful job of creating a masterful piece of Hollywood cinema. Based on Nash's experiences at New Jersey's most famed learning establishment, Princeton University, thru the development of his economic theory (""Nash's Equilibrium""), his marriage to Alicia, and his eventual work at MIT. Imagine if Robert Redford directed and Tom Cruise played the part of Nash as it might have been (they both considered it). I can't see this film being much better... however it would be kind of interesting to see another great director's (and the actor's) take on the same script. Russell Crowe takes the challenge of portraying the man with a chip on both soldiers (in this case schizophrenia), Mr. John Nash, right in stride with his previous preformance as Maximus in ""Gladiator"". I can't imagine anyone else playing this role of Nash as well as Crowe did. Co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch round out a wonderful supporting cast. Footnote: Alicia (Connelly) was maybe to evenly tempered in this film thru all of Nash's emotional ups & downs... almost too much so (a performance worthy of an Academy Award... I'm still sitting on the fence about it... it was good, but it wasn't brilliant). Beautifully filmed - partly on location (Princeton Univ, NJ). This is how drama should be. ""A Beautiful Mind"" will make you think - Is he imagining all this? Yes he is... no he isn't, yes, no, not sure, those people in the shed behind their house ARE real, no they aren't... yes - he is delusional.

I say this because of the mental illness and the disease they both had to and have to live with.  It's an amazing testament to them both that they survive day to day with this......and this film alone does not do justice to that, but gives us a glimpse into that world.Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's personal journey to bring this to the screen is important.

This is not an accurate portrayal of John Nash's life. That being said, let's look at the film as entertainment.The story concerns a man - a mathematician at Princeton - who lives in a world of delusions. He hallucinates and speaks to people who do not exist except to him. To him they are real and interact in his life in a positive and negative way. The scenes with Nash and the non-real characters are the most interesting part of the movie. When he is medicated to bring him back, or to keep him in our reality, he can no longer function in a world of academics and mathematics. A world he values. He makes the decision to stop the medication and live with his delusions. Most of the film takes place before he makes this decision and if there is a flaw in the film this is it. The many years that pass between stopping the medication and the Noble Prize award ceremony at the end zipped by like the roadrunner. I am certain Ron Howard meant for us viewers to wonder who was real and who was not real for as long as possible and I can't argue with that. It worked for me.The expression of love from John Nash to his wife in the audience at the award ceremony at the end of the film did not quite ring true for me as he was quite unlikable and nasty through most of the film. My wife, on the other hand, went through several tissues. Many tears were shed.The cast is first rate. Another nice Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer (soft spoken and menacing even as a good guy)performance, and if you compare Russel Crowe in Gladiator to the John Nash role in this film you will appreciate the fine job he does.

That it is based on the life of a real person, the mathematician John Nash, doesn't add much psychological credibility to the film; again and again, some director's or technician's device (e.g., Nash scrawling hieroglyphic equations on the Princeton library window or having scattered letters from a magazine take on a glowing life to show how Nash perceives them as a code) gives us the feeling that we're being taken on a Disney World ride through the mysteries of the mind.Nevertheless, the film is quite watchable for about two-thirds of its length -- after the dull exposition that sets up the central events and before the mawkish conclusion. Credit goes primarily to the stars, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connolly.Crowe, despite his status as the hunk du jour, clearly has satisfying acting technique and apparently good instincts; whatever reservations I have, it's fair to say that he brings the Nash character to compelling life. If only he didn't push the awkward-loner, vulnerable-brain-box motif so far! I suspect that Ron Howard, the director, instead of shaping the performance and asking for more subtlety at key moments, kept urging Crowe to pull out all the stops.I'm not suggesting that he indulges in scenery chewing -- mostly he keeps his technique within reasonable bounds, and some of the time it serves us well. But, in spite of his stardom, Crowe doesn't yet have the confidence to hold back where some reticence would actually strengthen the role. When (if?) he trusts himself and his audience more, he's going to be an actor to reckon with.Jennifer Connolly is luminous. I'd never seen her before, and she gives her role depths and corners where the script gives her colorless outlines. She's strikingly beautiful, but doesn't coast on her looks, and provides most of the movie's genuinely touching moments.The film's only other actor of note is the egregious Ed Harris, who gives us the umpteenth version of his snake-eyed glare and growling line readings. It's a mystery to me why so many people think he's a great actor. Screen presence, sure; range, from X to X prime, as Nash might put it.Good cinematography helps, featuring warm interiors that reveal the polished allure of the halls' old woodwork and exteriors that capture the sharp-focus chill of autumn and the sturdy solidity of venerable buildings on the campuses of Princeton and MIT. The musical score (one of the movie's few understated directorial elements) is effective, too.The widescreen DVD transfer is first-class -- something you can't count on in DVDs -- with none of the background pumping and motion jerkiness that can result when the compression necesary to fit a movie onto a small silver disc is performed poorly.A Beautiful Mind has its rewards; too bad they come only in patches.",3,This is your brain on artifice,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,2938,"['Beautiful', 'Mind', 'tries', 'do', 'self-contradictory', 'presenting', 'slick', 'Hollywoodish', 'story', 'obscure', 'diabolical', 'world', 'schizophrenia', 'based', 'life', 'real', 'person', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'psychological', 'credibility', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'director', 'technician', 'device', 'e.g.', 'Nash', 'scrawling', 'hieroglyphic', 'equations', 'Princeton', 'library', 'window', 'having', 'scattered', 'letters', 'magazine', 'take', 'glowing', 'life', 'show', 'how', 'Nash', 'code', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'being', 'taken', 'Disney', 'World', 'ride', 'mysteries', 'mind.Nevertheless', 'film', 'quite', 'watchable', 'two-thirds', 'length', 'dull', 'exposition', 'up', 'central', 'events', 'mawkish', 'conclusion', 'Credit', 'primarily', 'stars', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly.Crowe', 'status', 'hunk', 'du', 'jour', 'clearly', 'satisfying', 'acting', 'technique', 'apparently', 'good', 'instincts', 'reservations', 'have', 'fair', 'say', 'Nash', 'character', 'compelling', 'life', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'awkward-loner', 'vulnerable-brain-box', 'motif', 'so', 'far', 'suspect', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'director', 'instead', 'shaping', 'performance', 'asking', 'more', 'subtlety', 'key', 'moments', 'kept', 'urging', 'Crowe', 'pull', 'out', 'stops.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'mostly', 'technique', 'reasonable', 'bounds', 'time', 'well', 'spite', 'stardom', 'Crowe', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'confidence', 'hold', 'back', 'where', 'reticence', 'would', 'actually', 'strengthen', 'role', 'When', 'audience', 'more', 'going', 'be', 'actor', 'reckon', 'with.Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'luminous', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'role', 'depths', 'corners', 'where', 'script', 'colorless', 'outlines', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', ""n't"", 'coast', 'most', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments.The', 'film', 'only', 'other', 'actor', 'note', 'egregious', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'umpteenth', 'version', 'snake-eyed', 'glare', 'growling', 'line', 'readings', 'mystery', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'great', 'actor', 'Screen', 'presence', 'sure', 'range', 'X', 'X', 'prime', 'Nash', 'might', 'put', 'it.Good', 'cinematography', 'featuring', 'warm', 'interiors', 'reveal', 'polished', 'allure', 'halls', 'old', 'woodwork', 'exteriors', 'capture', 'sharp-focus', 'chill', 'autumn', 'sturdy', 'solidity', 'venerable', 'buildings', 'campuses', 'Princeton', 'MIT', 'musical', 'score', 'one', 'movie', 'few', 'understated', 'directorial', 'elements', 'effective', 'too.The', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'first-class', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'DVDs', 'none', 'background', 'pumping', 'motion', 'jerkiness', 'can', 'result', 'when', 'compression', 'necesary', 'fit', 'movie', 'small', 'silver', 'disc', 'performed', 'poorly.A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'rewards', 'too', 'bad', 'come', 'only', 'patches']",N/A

It certainly deserves to be rendered seriously.  Instead the tired Hollywood formulas and manipulations are wheeled out for yet another airing.  Love, a strangely homogenous and artificial emotion in Hollywood's understanding, is set to conquer all.  Psychiatric treatment, this time in the guise of insulin induced seizures rather than the more time-honoured shock therapy, is villainised.  The Ivy League universities and their associated priviledged 'feeding' schools are seen as a kind of safe haven from all the evils (i.e. realities) of American life.  Music swells appropriately.  There is even a car chase.*If you like Ron Howard's other films, and you consider 'Gladiator' great entertainment, then, yes, 'A Beautiful Mind' has the chance of satisfying.  But if 'Mulholland Drive' or 'Requieum for a Dream' is your idea of good American film, then don't bother.*In the grand tradition of Oscar winners, this film is also needlessly long, the very length apparently conveying its intended gravity.  Russell Crowe is needlessly bulked up, and Jennifer Connelly is needlessly beautiful.  Oh, if you've seen 'The League of Gentlemen' you might get a giggle from the pen ritual at Princeton (Pauline's pens...), and if you're a Freudian you might get more than a giggle;  and just imagine if they'd cast Edward and Tubbs as Nash and wife - and the Beast of Royston Vasey was let loose in New Jersey, or (better yet) Hollywood.

590721,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00005JKQZ,Robert J. Schneider,"[17, 21]","It's difficult to separate the fact from the fiction in watching this film; however, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, as directed by Ron Howard, is a compelling study of a brilliant mind gone somewhat astray. I agree that the movie is presented in a slick fashion, but I do think that it did its job in presenting us with the Cliff's Notes version of the fascinating story of John Forbes Nash, Jr.--enough to make me want to learn more about the life of this remarkable but troubled man.A BEAUTIFUL MIND opens at Princeton University in 1947, as John Nash (in a subtle and layered performance by the brilliant Australian actor Russell Crowe) and several of his contemporaries enter the doctoral program there. There is a great whiff of rivalry that permeates the air; although he is admired by his fellow students, John Nash feels threatened by them. This causes him to be quite off-putting at times. Unlike the others, he never goes to classes, which he feels are ""a great waste"" of his time. We see him writing formulas on his dormitory windows in search of a grand unified theory of...something. Even at this early stage, we can definitely see that there is something amiss about his personality. But there is more, much more, in store for this beautiful mind, as it descends slowly over the years into the realm of schizophrenia.Russell Crowe plays this role with as much love for Nash's flaws as well as his brilliance. His is the best portrayal of mental illness since that of Geoffrey Rush in SHINE (1997). Rush deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance; Crowe stands a good chance of doing the same this year. The vastly underrated Jennifer Connelly plays the role of John's paramour and wife Alicia, wo gradually uncovers John's web of delusion and decides to not be a passive bystander to it all. She is being deservedly nominated for Best Supporting Actress.All in all, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is compelling, well-written, somewhat entertaining, and extremely well-acted. However, it must be noted that this is but a surface character study of a complex and troubled individual. There is much more to learn about John Forbes Nash, Jr. Taken on its own, this is a film that is well-worth watching. I, for one, cannot wait for it to be released on DVD, where hopefully there will be a lot of extra scenes that were deleted from the initial release--this may help us grasp the character better. Then again, a trip to the local public library may be the better option.

In Gladiator, Russell Crowe falls from being ruling general of the Roman Army to being a gladiatorial slave. In a beautiful mind, he goes from being a mathematical genius to.... something far less.And then he battles back, to return to a different kind of glory.This is a wonderfully directed and told story with award winning acting from not only Crowe, but also Jennifer Connelly. She could win a supporting actress award.But probably the kudos go most to Ron Howard who takes an intellectual, interior story about a mathematician and brings it alive. That's much harder to do than with an action story.This movie has a nice surprise in it--  nice in that it sneaks up on you. Before long, this kind of a surprise, which other films  have demonstrated in the last few years, will become a genre all its own-- maybe call it the &quot;reality&quot; surprise.Well, I've tried to talk about it without ruining the story. This is a story that uses all the levels of the roller coaster. It'll take you for a nice emotional ride.It was fun, the day before seeing the movie,  to read an Op-Ed piece in the NY Times written by a former Princeton student who remembered the real professor, haunting the library. It brought an extra dose of reality to this film which is based on a real life genius who was awarded the Nobel prize. S.C. Gwynne wrote, &quot;a campus character we called Purple Sneakers, a harmless middle-aged crazy man who hung around the main undergraduate library.&quot;&quot;This hapless fellow, who was easily recognized by his mismatched plaid clothing and purple or red high-top sneakers, stalked and spied on students as they walked in and out of the library. He was too silly to be frightening: he would sneak about with exaggerated, mincing steps that reminded me of old Bugs Bunny cartoons, hiding behind trees and peeking out at students as though we could not see him.&quot;The character arc in this film is an unusual one, beautifully portrayed. There are some delicious lessons in it on humility, on what is important, on illusions, on genius.This film is about insanity. You have to wonder. If a genius can see all the possibilities, doesn't that open him to the risk of seeing edges of impossibilities? And does that put him at risk of going mad? And is it worth the risk? Ahh.

He spends his days writing perplexing formulas on his dormitory window in search of a breakthrough idea... He gets it one night, while out with his fellow scholars at a local bar where a stunning blond grabs their attention... He recreates the design of a classmate's tie reflecting light through glass... He follows the movements of pigeons as they compete for food... He stares obsessively at too many numbers, and reveals his natural ability helping the Pentagon crack the mathematical codes the Soviets are using...He becomes friend with his roommate, Charles Herman, who is everything he is not - charming and charismatic... He somewhat refines his social manners enough to win the love of a beautiful physics student who would become his wife...Then he begins to look for secret messages in newspapers and magazines, interpreting vague, undecipherable connections between letters and numbers...His mental derangement grows to uncontrolled proportions and the lines between reality and delusion begin to occur as his hallucinations take control of his life in every instant... Nash soon begins to understand the nature of his mental illness and, while he is never cured of his hallucinations behavior, eventually keeps struggling to overcome it...Crowe imparts every facet of John Nash's personality with clarity and feeling... He wins our sympathy merely by showing us a man climbing to the top, falling to the very bottom, and through love and determination fully, recapturing his potential once again...Jennifer Connelly begins to establish herself as a young actress to watch for...

She tries to do what's best for her husband, but in the face of adversity to take the decision she does, it is inspiring to think that love is the seed of all hope, and what makes the ride worthwhile...Paul Bettany gives another charming turn as Nash's only true friend...

590726,A2YGVSTELYMSS5,B00005JKQZ,Robin C. Smith,"[2, 4]","This is a very well-acted film purportedly about John Nash the brilliant, highly eccentric and mentally ill mathematician. It is all rather predictable, and disappointingly is really about schizophrenia rather than academia and mathematics. I had rather hoped this book would be more about science and mathematics - as that would be really so much more interesting and much more novel. Instead we do get a rather typical Hollywood tale of genius (why are all geniuses portrayed as &quot;weird&quot; in the movies?) and madness (see &quot;Shine&quot; for a more powerful account). Nash's schizophrenia is interestingly (and a little surprisingly) dramatized. Jennifer Connolly was endearingly supportive for reasons that are not all that clear - I guess Russell Crowe-as-Nash is just so hunky? Who knows? It is not really explored. Perhaps she, as a mathematician herself, was and is able to appreciate his genius?Anyway - pick any Hollywood movie about mental illness and you have essentially seen this film.

FOREMAN,"[0, 0]","After watching this movie last night, I am somewhere between the ""This Movie was Pile of garbage"" and the ""It Won Best Picture So It Must Be the Best Movie Ever"" crowds. . . .  I purchased the book several years ago, and it looked absolutely fascinating.  It looks even better now.  If this movie did nothing else, it inspired and motivated me to put the book by Sylvia Nasar way higher on my reading list for next summer.Nash is/was obviously a tremendously complex man, regardless of his disorder, and to convey those complications in a two-hour movie is virtually impossible.  Howard took the easier road and omitted a pile of details regarding their marriage, some of Nash's personal views, etc., probably for the better.  Real scholars will read the book and get the ""real"" story from the biography; the casual moviegoer got a fascinating glimpse into the extraordinary life of a tormented genius.What bumps my review up from three to four stars were the extras on the DVD.  Seeing the real footage of Nash accepting his Nobel Prize was a beautiful addition to the film, brief though it was.  I'd love to have seen and heard Nash's acceptance speech in that footage.  Some of Ron Howard's commentary, particularly as he described the deleted scenes and how/why they were left out, was very interesting.  They made the move of the two-disc format by piling on a bunch of extras, more of which I'll be exploring this afternoon and tonight.Did Howard and Crowe manage to portray the ""beautiful mind"" of John Nash in their limited opportunity?  I'll leave that to the more irate and gushing reviewers.  Is it a ""Pile of garbage""?  No.  Is it ""The Best Movie Ever""?  No.  It is ambiguously somewhere in between, probably on the higher end of the spectrum--I've seen movies try to achieve more with less success. . . .Bottom Line:  This movie kept me intrigued, off-base, guessing, and engaged for its entirety.  Not all movies can do that.  It also prompted and piqued my interest in the book, wherein I will obviously find a more thorough, detailed, and complete picture of John Nash's life.

You're muchbetter off processing Ron Howard's slick tearjerker in a state of unbiased ignorance --prepackaged uplift tends to work best when you're unaware of the tinkering.But in light of the hyperbolic swill that DreamWorks (fully Miramax's equal in termsof dishonest marketing) has decided to stamp on its recent print ads -- ""There Are SomeFilms In Our Lives That Change the Way We Look at the World"" -- you may leave ""ABeautiful Mind"" wondering what all the fuss is about.  The way you look at the world willlikely remain unchanged, although the level of cynicism with which you regardmainstream Hollywood most certainly will not.""A Beautiful Mind"" may or may not be the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a brilliantmathematician and game theorist who won the Nobel Prize after a long, difficult strugglewith schizophrenia.  From the beginning, the prodigious Nash is an eccentric, evenreclusive personality, and so it's appropriate that he's played by Russell Crowe, himselfno stranger to ingenuity or surliness.  But the real star here is the radiant JenniferConnelly as Nash's long-suffering wife, Alicia; she's easily the most beautiful thing in ""ABeautiful Mind,"" not to mention the only one who shows even a modicum of restraint.Much has been made of Crowe's Academy Award-nominated work, but I'm here toproclaim that that performance is, as Nash himself might have said, a grossmiscalculation.  Crowe's acting is equal parts physical and intellectual -- he nails everylimp, flinch and mannerism; he delivers every line with a stare that manages to be at oncerapt and glazed-over; he does everything, in fact, but convince you that there's an actualperson underneath all that twitching.The film's inability to make you connect with this blank cipher is certainly not fromwant of trying -- indeed, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has swept so much ugly realityunder the carpet that Nash couldn't be more likable if he walked through the entire movieholding a giant heart-shaped lollipop.  But by pre-exorcising Nash's personal demons,Howard has essentially ignored the fact that demons, not teary-eyed, pseudo-inspirationalspeeches and sappily affirmative dialogue, are what render a human life capable ofredemption to begin with.""A Beautiful Mind"" is not without its accidental virtues, but the holes in the story areapparent even with an untainted viewing.  After the midway revelation of Nash'scondition (which is handled, I'll admit, with spectacular cleverness), the film loses steamrapidly, and the third act has a languorous, irritatingly meandering rhythm -- you can justsee Howard and Goldsman scrambling to find fresh obstacles for Nash to overcome, solong as the obstacles don't include divorce, bisexuality or anti-Semitism.  By the timeCrowe is old and wizened enough to deliver a mealy-mouthed (not to mention completelyfabricated) acceptance speech about the importance of love, the film seems to behumoring rather than saluting him -- what adversity, exactly, has been overcome here?The challenge of squeezing a complicated and troubled existence into a polishedmental-illness-of-the-week melodrama?Knowing and publicizing the truth about what Howard and Goldsman haveobliterated from Nash's story doesn't stir up problems with the film; it explains them.  Itcuts straight to the center of this callous project, penetrating the shellacked-on layers ofphoniness, exposing the intentions of filmmakers who want to take one of America'smore distinctive success stories and turn it into a generic, traditional one.Certainly it is a dramatist's prerogative (and necessity) to fictionalize reality, and there'sno denying the difficulty of fashioning an entertaining two-hour biopic while retainingone's integrity, but for Pete's sake, Opie, you could have at least tried.  Goldsman'sscreenplay, after dragging us through its revisionist fantasy under the pretense of havingan enlightening destination, finally boils down to ""a beautiful mind is less important thana beautiful heart"" -- and as a message, it's as loathsome and hypocritical as it ischaracteristically dopey.

590732,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKQZ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 8]","""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the story of legendary mathematician John Nash, widely credited with inventing ""game theory"" and cursed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Arriving in Princeton university in the late 1940's (the film makes the point of that these were pivotal days for mathematics - with theoretical mathematicians taking credit for winning WWII by breaking enemy codes, cracking the secrets of nuclear fission and inventing the economic theories that put the world back together again.) Socially awkward, Nash struggles to craft an original mathematical idea - suffering a sort of mathematician's block while his peers churn out successful, if derivative work.  Nash seems consumed by the idea that a hidden mathematical order can explain seemingly random or chaotic events - the feeding patterns of pigeons, the mating habits of drunken Princeton students or how badly a person's taste in clothing is.  With the help of a free-wheeling roommate, Nash appears to overcome some inner demons and publishes a thesis which brazenly offers a statistical and theoretical model for explaining these seemingly spontaneous events.  The theory, which Nash hits on trying to explain how one of five guys will manage to get a beautiful blonde's attention in a local bar, has larger applications - everything from macroeconomics to the strategies of nuclear war - and flies in the face of traditional economics.The film cuts to Nash a few years later - now more suave and successful crunching numbers at MIT and occasionally for the Government.  The script makes the point that not all is right with Nash, but counterbalances with hints that Nash is merely a forceful personality (teaching calculus in an undershirt because it's too hot not to) with a broad imagination (picking out shapes formed by stars, or recurring patterns among large number groups in Russian transmissions).  Despite his quirks, Nash manages to maintain respect among peers who shunned him in Princeton (where he never attended class) and the love of Alicia Nassar (Jennifer Connelly), his future wife and biographer.  He also finds himself under the attentions of Parcher (Ed Harris), a shadowy cold warrior who runs a secret decryption program in an abandoned warehouse on MIT grounds - one that everybody thought empty.  Parcher chills Nash with a tale of a Nazi A-bomb stolen and smuggled somewhere into America by a soldiers of a radical faction of the Soviet Army.  Ordered to scan seemingly meaningless newspaper and magazine articles for clues (the media is apparently part of the conspiracy) Nash papers his office with hundreds of pages linked by his red pen and arcana.  In a film about schizophrenia (a decreased capacity to distinguish what is real from what is not), it's no surprise that Parcher's story (one that others would easily tout as ""frighteningly plausible"") is merely the latest and most elaborate delusion Nash suffers.  Diagnosed a schizophrenic, subjected to insulin shock-therapy and a seemingly endless stream of other drugs, Nash takes a long fall from his exalted position as master-mathematician.  Trying to avoid both drugs (because they inhibit both his intellect and his passions), Nash is tortured by his delusions which reduce him to a seeming cripple (students at Princeton lampoon his distinctive limp).This was a heartbreaking film that makes a very simple point - that love can't be theorized.  Numbers create logical but entirely delusional constructs while Nash's love for his wife offers him some link with reality.  That said, the film - brilliantly lead by Russel Crowe - makes some missteps.  (I'll let others deal with the supposed factual oversights like Nash's sexual ambiguity or his abandonment of an illegitimate child) Crowe's love keeps him from sliding deeper into madness, but it's a chance meeting with a promising student in Princeton's library that truly unlocks Nash's sanity, and reveals that teaching may set his mind free.  Also, the script glances over those most important years - those in which Nash had dealt with his problem without resprting to debilitating medication.  Was he truly able to manage?  Was he productive?  We just don't know.  The script, much like Nash himself, also has a decreased capacity to tell the true from the imagined - real characters like Nash's colleagues and his son, and the forceful Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) have little substance when compared to those the film quickly identifies as inventions of Nash's wounded psyche.  Plummer's character stays long enough to warn Nash of his problem and convince his wife that those people her husband had mentioned never existed, then he disappears like a phantom. While we may suspect Ed Harriss's character, others have more urgency and plausibility than the real characters. Nash's delusions themselves remain confined to several characters whom he understands to be delusions yet continues to be plagued by.  Also, there's little irony to those delusions - an imaginary friend, an imaginary young girl - or any inner explanation for why or how he his mind has constructed them. The film doesn't even explore the cautionary moral of the end of WWII, when outrageous advances in technology and the cold war combined to alter reality as never before and engender a sort of paranoid detachment among everybody.  Still a triumph for Russell Crowe.",4,Crowe's beautiful performance saves the movie,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,5361,"['Beautiful', 'Mind', 'story', 'legendary', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Nash',

But, I have to say, the day people start realizing that those characteristics aren't quite enough is the day I'll stop complaining. How is it that people can not see behind the ease of this movie and realize it is excrutiatingly dull and not well thought out? I'd much rather watch a documentary of the life of John Nash than sit through a movie that rushes along just to hit all the ""right"" moments. It's called editing - a concept Ron Howard missed on this one.The thing I don't like about these over-done Hollywood movies is that everything is just so in place and ""right."" In order to accurately portray a real life and get people involved in a visceral, intense way is to cut out all the sugar coating and drop huge doses of the heavy sickening reality we all live in. I'm not saying everything in film must be disturbing and cynical. What I'm saying is that film-makers should try to push the envelope and force us to see life in all its glory and all its sadness. This film pretends to be concerned with showing us a hard but glorious life, but fails because it doesn't dig deep enough-it doesn't just throw it all up. It carefully, politely sort of asks us to consider it and this is what I call a weak story and a weak film.If you want to watch movies about people struggling, go watch Happiness or Bully or American Movie. Don't listen to the hype. This movie is dull, sometimes embarrassing, unrealistic (and yes, I know that John Nash existed and approved of this film) and not an ounce of innovation was felt.

Well, Ok, I am over-analyzing. Jennifer Connelly does well to potray a doting wife, but the fact that his real-world wife had divorced Nash is totally ignored. For that matter, we're never even told that their son, also an ingenious math whiz and a schizophrenic, suffered as much at the hands of fate and society as his father.Why was a more honest, less Hollywoodized depiction of the mathematician so difficult to manage? None of such facts would have lessened Nash's accomplishment or undermined the originality of his contributions, but their omission suggests that the director was not confident in addressing the audience as grown-ups.If you know little about John Nash -- the troubled, violent, gifted mathematician --  this may come across as a very well made movie, as the numerous accolades it bagged may prove.

It will change you.This is the true story of a brilliant mathematician, Dr. John Nash, who distinguished himself before he was 30 as an incredible mathematical theorist who disproves a postulate that has been followed and taught for over 150 years when Nash comes along.Math in itself may not intrigue you, but the movie will. The story is delivered in a way that the most inept in mathematics can follow.After receiving his PhD, he becomes a professor and he works at MIT Wheeler Labs, helping the U.S. government with code problems during the Cold War.Everyone knows him to be a bit odd and eccentric and no one, not even himself, realizes he has been battling schizophrenia for years.I suspect that Paul Bettany may receive a nomination for best supporting actor as the college roommate that helps to socialize Nash (Russell Crowe) and pull him out of his reclusive shell so that he could meet the love of his life, Alicia, magnificently portrayed by Jennifer Connelley.Jennifer Connelley has proved herself over and over again in previous films... hopefully this year the Academy will remember her and give her the nomination she deserves. She is fantastic in this movie.Needless to say, Crowe's performance is definitely deserving of a Best Actor nomination.  The acting in this film is so real, you forget you're watching a movie. The movie takes the viewer on an exciting ride that will have moments of humor and heartbreak. There are many times throughout the film that you can not tell if you are seeing a hallucination or the real thing and you will be put in the shoes of John Nash for a brief time... is it real, or is it in your head?The film's score is also worthy of recognition.&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is a beautiful film. The characters are real and moving and the experience of seeing the film may change the way you perceive those with mental illness... and it will definitely stir the heart of anyone who does not have a heart made of cement.

Of course, I liked Ron Howard's past movies 'Apollo 13', 'Backdraft', 'Gung Ho', 'Cocoon', 'Splash' and 'Nightshift', so my expectations were particularly high.Russell Crowe amazed me as he delivered a very good performance as John Nash, a mentally disturbed mathematician genius at Princeton University. Jennifer Connelly reached her all time career peak as the woman Nash falls in love with and has to deal with her husbands problem. The movie is haunting, dark, funny at times, and very touching. I don't really know whether the movie dramatizes too much for movie purposes, but it sure unfolds very well. The makeup work is one of the highlights of the movie.

Bauer,"[0, 3]","Halfway through, I didn't like it, but the second half changed my mind.I couldn't understand why Russell Crowe, with his Australia accent, was cast as Nash, who was from West Virginia.  That was very distracting.  They couldn't hire an accent coach for Crowe?  His Princeton roommate had a British accent, which was equally puzzling.  Sure, a roommate from Britain is plausible, but it had nothing to do with the narrative.I didn't like the beginning of the movie because I felt it was glorifying obnoxious, anti-social behavior.  I felt the message was that it is OK to act like a jerk, as long as you are brilliant.I liked the second half better because it showed Nash as troubled and someone to be pitied.  I felt the portrayal was very compassionate and empathetic.My favorite scene in the movie occurs when Nash, his wife, and the psychiatrist are sitting together around a table.  Nash had been out of the hospital for a while.  He stopped taking his medication, and as a result had a recurrence of his delusions.  Nash explained that he stopped taking his medications because they prevented him from doing his work.  After all his troubles, confinement and medication, he still insisted that he could solve his problems with his own mind alone.  The shrink for his part explained that the problem was with his mind.  I found it interesting because it showed (much better than my description here), Nash both being conflicted as well as trying to take control of the problem.Ed Harris's film noir portrayal of a cold war secret government agent was outstanding.  I was mesmerized by the elegant beauty of the actress Jennifer Connelly, as Nash's wife, Alicia.  I wish the film had gone into what attracted her to him, just a little.  I found her to be very cool and stable minded.The bottom line of the film is that mental illness can happen to anyone, no matter how intelligent or talented.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[3, 5]","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a tragic and inspiring masterwork that showcases one of the most impressive acting performances in recent memory.  If there were still any lingering doubts as to the extent of Russell Crowe's acting prowess, this film dashed them all.John Nash (Crowe) is a brilliant mathematician who makes an amazing breakthrough in his field while a student at Princeton.  After graduating, he teaches at M.I.T. while working for the federal government as a code-breaker.  He begins a relationship with a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly) and soon they are married and settled into a quiet domestic life.  However, Nash soon starts to see patterns and associations of information everywhere and it is soon discovered that he is suffering from schizophrenia.  Serious questions as to his perceptions of the real world, both in the past and in the present, must now be confronted.Virtually all aspects of ""A Beautiful Mind"" work beautifully.  Howard's confident direction and the strong lead performances by Crowe and Connelly is the glue that holds the entire production together.  However, the important contributions made by supporting actors Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer, composer James Horner, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman should also be acknowledged.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" furthermore deserves credit for not sentimentalizing Nash's struggle against mental illness.  The darker aspects of his tortuous road to recovery are not avoided and are unflinchingly presented warts and all.

590762,A3DIGX5KC46U6K,B00005JKQZ,"Tahseen Nakavi ""juror""","[1, 1]","Haunting music by James Horner. Beautiful Themes. Ron Howard has come out with a clean winner. Good performances by Russell Crowe and the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. I had not read about the Equilibrium concept of John Nash Jr. and the personal trauma he had with schizophrenia and delusions before he got the Nobel for Economics Sciences that he shared with Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi in 1994. When I saw this film, I came to know about Nash. It was  nostalgia for me as I had studied close to Princeton University at Glassboro State College (now Rowan). I had visited Princeton and almost felt that I was there when I saw the locale scenes.I would say that Ron Howard romanticizes a bit and makes the story flashy. He could have underplayed the screenplay a bit. Yet the scenes of paranoid schizophrenia and delusions come out good with able performances by Paul Bettany as  ""the prodigal roommate"" and the maniacal defense agent Parcher played by Ed Harris. Akiva Goldsman has written a good story on how to patch figments of a cracked imagination. The best reason to stay with the movie is Alicia Nash played by Jennifer Connelly. Her suffering comes out so well in her reading of the character. The best part of the movie is John Nash Jr.'s relationship with his wife Alicia. I am touched by the way Jennifer Connelly  approaches Crowe when he is her professor and brings out her love for him. I have learnt from this film that love is patience, love is endurance, love is not just after one's own benefits and that love shines. To conclude, this film picked up the AFI best actress award for Jennifer Connelly. She also picked up the Oscar that year and the movie was the Film of the Year. James Horner has breathed life into the narrative with his compellingly mesmerising score. If not for Howard Shore's magnificent work on the Fellowship of the Ring that year, this was easily the best effort in music.

590766,A21JAP6EO4J5RW,B00005JKQZ,The END.,"[6, 7]","It's no wonder this movie has been acclaimed by critics and has received a number of academy awards including Best Picture. The story of a man's life struggling through the mental illness of schizophrenia is both heartrending and captivating. And obviously by experiencing true value of love and family, this man's instinctinve decision of healing himself is a journey all of us would be touched to witness.Russell Crowe's most promising performance of this incredible  man, John Nash, leaves me wondering exactly why he was not the one with an oscar in hand. (Although Denzel Washington also did an excellent job as a villian, though a good character is always admired.) Jennifer Connelly also did an equally excellent job, along with the ever talented Ed Harris.Many filmmakers like to create characters that are complex and unusual, sometimes to the extreme that they don't exist. And most of the time they pull it off, because as humans we honestly relate. Being that John Nash's life accomplishments were real, and his imagined characters were close to real, the humanity audiences saw were admired. And what made the film truly touching was how even though people lack a sense of balance in their minds, giving them these sorts of mental illnesses, they are given an even better gift that normal people like most of us are missing. And that's what really makes his mind beautiful.Film and psychology are things I plan on doing for the rest of my life, but I'm not sure I can do both. People like John Nash are reasons why I choose psychology, and amazing directors (who also directed this film chronologically) like the brilliant Ron Howard are reasons for my desire of filmmaking. Even though this movie was said to be inaccurate in some areas, it is definitely one of the greatest films in history. That's just Hollywood's way of getting to you.

Critics have been coming out of the woodwork and accusing director Ron Howard of dodging some throny issues in his film biography of math wizard John Nash (accusations have ranged from Nash's alleged homosexuality to even anti-semitism).  In addition, the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Nash's long suffering wife has provoked the wrath of some in the Latino community (Nash's wife is really from El Salvador).  Regardless of the above, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a good film on its own terms.  Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as the professor suffering with scizophrenia.  This must have been a tricky role to play, but Crowe pulls it off without faking a single move.  Jennifer Connelly was better in the far edgier ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but she shines in her role as the long-suffering wife.  Howard competently directs the film with feeling and at a reasonable pace, although the spotlight really belongs to Crowe.

590769,AMLV3B3JDF4HD,B00005JKQZ,The Kite,"[3, 5]","This is a film that is a Master of all it does. Every scene is so carefully calculated and so astoundingly executed. The cast is captivating! It took me some time to realize that Russell Crowe was not remotely like John Nash in real life - he completely embodies the role, convincing you with every gesture, every glance. Jennifer Connelly starts off slowly, but suddenly snaps to life as a woman that demands your attention and respect. Paul Bettany excels in his role - he is immediately likable and twists your emotions as you find him to be ""the enemy"". While all the actors are at their best, they carry the movie along subtlety, letting the enthralling story take center stage. Ron Howard's superb directing makes the first viewing an instantly powerful experience, but has many fine details than can only be picked out from numerous viewings. For instance, the subtlety of the hallucinations. When the little girl is running through the grass and around a flock of pigeons, none of the birds move or are startled by her frolicking in close proximity. Watching closely, you will find many moments such as these, which can still be quite chilling on the 3rd or 4th viewing. The character of Nash is, of course, the central point of the movie and he is a deeply pitiable and complex character. His imaginary friends fulfil what you see to be his deepest needs - Charles, the friend who always listens and cares(""somebody needed a hug"") and Parcher, the ego boosting agent who makes Nash a ""somebody""(""You are simply the best natural code breaker I've ever seen""). Even when you find out that they're merely characters in his mind, you long to believe him and slowly let the film lure you back into considering if he could possibly be right. When Alicia finds the shed and you hear the radio inside, you find yourself hoping against hope that she'll open the door to discover her husband's secret service agents working away to find the bomb. His journey from loneliness to love, from recognition to accomplishment, from brilliance to insanity and back is depicted in a powerful and memorable way.

590772,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JKQZ,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 4]","Director:  Ron HowardCast:  Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Jason Gary-Stanford, Judd Hirsch, Austin Pendelton, Tanya Clarke.Running Time:  135 minutesRated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence.Director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"", ""Ransom"") has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" is no exception. It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash (played brilliantly by Oscar-winner Russell Crowe), but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the ""triumph of the human spirit over adversity"" type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.  When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany), and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly in a fine performance). After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher (played by a creepy Ed Harris), informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using.It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen, and accepted as fact, is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head.  The rest of the film details Nash's attempts, with the aid of his doctors and the loyal Alicia, to overcome his illness and to return to productive life as a mathematician.  Like a number of Howard's films, this one has been criticized for its alleged sentimentality. This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards. There is some truth in the criticism, but at least ""A Beautiful Mind"" sins less grievously in this respect than do some other recent Best Picture winners.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" shows us once again that Crowe is not only a powerful performer, but that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles.It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. No biography; however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasize. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather than a biographical treatise this approach works well enough.  Overall, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is certainly a valid depiction of a great, yet troubled human being and Howard does a fine job painting his life picture on screen; however, it is certainly not one of the greatest films of the decade and may not have even deserved its Best Picture immortality.  A beautiful triumph of the human spirit; nonetheless, and a film to be enjoyed by psychologists and fans of Crowe alike.",4,A Beautiful Mind  (2001),1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4449,"['Director', 'Ron', 'HowardCast', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Jason', 'Gary-Stanford', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Austin', 'Pendelton', 'Tanya', 'Clarke.Running', 'Time', '135', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'intense', 'thematic', 'material', 'sexual', 'content', 'scene', 'violence.Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', '13', 'Ransom', 'reputation', 'making', 'intellectually', 'undemanding', 'films', 'often', 'sentimental', 'uplifting', 'theme', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'exception', 'biography', 'mathematician', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Oscar-winner', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'attempt', 'explain', 'Nash', 'mathematical', 'theories', 'probably', 'wisely', 'pure', 'mathematics', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'subject', 'layman', 'grasp', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'theories', 'have', 'influenced', 'number', 'fields', 'activity', 'including', 'economics', 'evolutionary', 'biology', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'nature', 'influence', 'film', 'rather', 'example', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'adversity', 'type', 'biopic', 'adversity', 'Nash', 'triumphs', 'being', 'schizophrenia', 'suffered', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Nash', 'undergraduate', 'Princeton', 'late', '1940s', 'intellectually', 'brilliant', 'awkward', 'lacking', 'social', 'skills', 'gaucheness', 'however', 'Nash', 'close', 'friend', 'more', 'self-assured', 'room-mate', 'Charles', 'Herman', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'later', 'meets', 'marries', 'beautiful', 'student', 'named', 'Alicia', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'fine', 'performance', 'graduating', 'recruited', 'American', 'intelligence', 'services', 'help', 'break', 'Soviet', 'codes', 'Cold', 'War', 'CIA', 'contact', 'Parcher', 'played', 'creepy', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Soviets', 'are', 'using', 'American', 'newspapers', 'magazines', 'convey', 'information', 'agents', 'much', 'Nash', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'attempts', 'crack', 'code', 'are', 'using.It', 'point', 'Howard', 'coup', 'cinema', 'Sudden', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'more', 'normally', 'associated', 'thriller', 'genre', 'Howard', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'effective', 'context', 'biopic', 'learn', 'Nash', 'not', 'merely', 'eccentric', 'actually', 'mentally', 'ill', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'hitherto', 'seen', 'accepted', 'fact', 'not', 'truth', 'illusion', 'existing', 'only', 'Nash', 'head', 'rest', 'film', 'details', 'Nash', 'attempts', 'aid', 'doctors', 'loyal', 'Alicia', 'overcome', 'illness', 'return', 'productive', 'life', 'mathematician', 'number', 'Howard', 'films', 'one', 'been', 'criticized', 'alleged', 'sentimentality', 'criticism', 'however', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'harm', 'eyes', 'Academy', 'indeed', 'sentimentality', 'often', 'be', 'positive', 'advantage', 'when', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'truth', 'criticism', 'least', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'sins', 'less', 'grievously', 'respect', 'do', 'other', 'recent', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winners', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'once', 'again', 'Crowe', 'not', 'only', 'powerful', 'performer', 'also', 'versatile', 'one', 'able', 'play', 'character', 'very', 'different', 'action', 'played', 'two', 'films', 'convey', 'pathos', 'Nash', 'situation', 'possessor', 'brilliant', 'flawed', 'mind', 'received', 'good', 'support', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Alicia', 'also', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Parcher', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Charles.It', 'also', 'been', 'claimed', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'when', 'facts', 'Nash', 'life', 'biography', 'however', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'tell', 'full', 'story', 'subject', 'life', 'biographers', 'always', 'have', 'choose', 'wish', 'emphasize', 'choice', 'particularly', 'acute', 'scriptwriters', 'directors', 'filmed', 'biographies', 'only', 'normal-length', 'feature', 'film', 'can', 'convey', 'far', 'less', 'information', 'book', 'Here', 'Howard', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'have', 'clearly', 'gone', 'emotional', 'rather', 'factual', 'approach', 'Nash', 'life', 'seen', 'entertainment', 'rather', 'biographical', 'treatise', 'approach', 'well', 'enough', 'Overall', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'certainly', 'valid', 'depiction', 'great', 'yet', 'troubled', 'human', 'being', 'Howard', 'fine', 'job', 'painting', 'life', 'picture', 'screen', 'however', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'decade', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'immortality', 'beautiful', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'psychologists', 'fans', 'Crowe', 'alike']",N/A
590773,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,B00005JKQZ,Thomas Keneally,"[13, 20]","Any scientific movie when it gets to Hollywood becomes terrible. ""A Beautiful Mind"" by Ron Howard is no exception. While the book by Sylvia Nassar was very good, the movie changed the story and cast the wrong people. Firstly, the story, Nash was divorced by his wife but she continued to take care of him. I do not know why they had to change the story, having the original story would not have diminished his accomplishments in any way. Though he was outstanding in his work, he was portrayed to be a gentle, bumbling person. In reality he was a pretty mean person who was incredibly jealous of his colleagues. He was also racist and used to remark about his Jewish colleagues who were brilliant. This is especially true in the area of economics as more than 45% of the Noble prize winners are Jewish. Hollywood movies are terrible at portraying how scientific ideas are arrived upon. The part where he comes up with the idea in game theory in a bar was the silliest. In reality, it was a culmination of a lot of work started by great minds such as John von Neumann. I have taken courses in this and found the whole thing ridiculous.Next the cast, I do not think that Russell Crowe to be the wrong person for the role. Firstly, he is too musculur to be an MIT professor, they did not have time then to work out in gyms for 2 hours a day. While professors come in all types and can be eccentric, they were rarely muscular. Crowe's accent does not go well with that of Nash also. He is better suited for movies like Gladiator and L.A.Confidential. He was miscast in this role. Jennifer Connelly did a terrific job as his wife. The direction was terrible though. Ron Howard is not suited for such movies and is more for run of the mill movies. In general, I do not think that this movie deserved the best picture award.

590774,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKQZ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 8]","Over the period of a week, I was able to see two very different film biographies of two very different people. However, only one of the two films actually accomplishes what it wants to; ""A Beautiful Mind"" shows us why John Nash was different from the rest of us and why we should care about him or his life.John Nash (Russell Crowe), a promising, young mathematician, enters Princeton in the late 40s, ready to come up with a brilliant, original idea. He is so focused in this quest that he forsakes all of his courses and studies, constantly working out mathematical theories and formulas. He is shocked when his advisor (Judd Hirsch), tells him that based on his current level of work, he is not suitable for placement with any firm upon graduation. This causes Nash to work overtime and he finally comes up with an idea and writes a paper about this. Presenting the paper to his advisor, he is promptly scooped up by the Wheeler Institute at MIT. The institute provides him with a place to work, a staff, and the freedom to study but it does expect him to teach a few classes. In one of these classes, a female student, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) catches his eye. They date and eventually marry. Soon, John is approached by William Parcher (Ed Harris), a member of a very secret government organization. William wants Nash to work for him and break codes. Nash begins this work with his usual zeal. Soon, Alicia realizes that John may be losing his grip on reality.""A Beautiful Mind"", directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, from the book by Sylvia Nasar, is a very good, well-done film biography. Unlike the recent ""Iris"", Howard works small miracles to paint a picture of a brilliant, but troubled man.Nash is a brilliant mathematician and a Nobel Prize winner, but there are many Nobel Prize winners. Why make a film about this man? I'll get to that in a minute, but first we should discuss the math part of his personality. I think most studios would throw any film director out on their but if they presented an idea about making a film about a mathematician, but Howard found perhaps the one man, at the right time, who would interest any studio. He cast Russell Crowe, fresh off of his success in ""Gladiator"" and his Academy Award, as Nash. Crowe is red-hot at the moment, so his presence virtually guarantees a certain amount of tickets sold. Even if the film were terrible. Thankfully, the film is very good. Both Howard and Crowe do brilliant things to paint a portrait of a mathematician. Crowe works frantically through the math problems, displaying a zest for this type of work that Nash surely has. When confronted with personal relationships, Nash has a lot of trouble communicating and this is illustrated beautifully in a couple of brief interactions with people around him. When working on math problems, Howard uses filmmaking techniques to illustrate the thought processes Nash uses. Many filmmakers would have a tendency to use tons of special effects and bring the problems out of the story, but Howard uses a very skilled approach. For instance, Nash envisions the problem that he will eventually solve using figures at a local pub. Howard barely highlights the figures and moves them around a little, presenting them as Nash must have viewed them. It really is a brilliant method and works beautifully.Watching the previews for ""Mind"", I had a lot of reservations about Crowe's accent. I couldn't place where it was from and initially had some trouble accepting it in the beginning of the film. But Crowe does such a great job of making the character his own, that I am willing to overlook the less than perfect Southern accent. Crowe moves as Nash must, a man who is unsure about his surroundings, moving in a slow amble, his arms pulled in to ward off the attackers. I really felt that Crowe, a tall, well-built Australian man was the good-looking but tentative Nash. As Nash ages throughout the film, the make-up used convinces the audience that Crowe has aged as well. It really is an interesting sight to see Crowe convincingly become a senior citizen. As often happens with the Academy Awards, actors are awarded for performances in films that are not worthy, only to have worthy performances overlooked. I think this is going to be the case with Crowe.The film is really a showcase for two people. Crowe and Howard. Howard does some of his best work in this film. As the story unfolds, things begin to happen in the film which don't seem all that remarkable, simply a piece of the fabric of Nash's life, but as the story unfolds, Howard slowly lets us in on the secret, a secret which is backed up by all of the previous information. As Nash begins working for Parcher, during the Cold War, the film takes a bit of a turn into a spy film as spies battle for the information Nash is working on. The characters and the settings become almost animated and strange. But this is a brilliant method of painting what Nash sees and feels. The film is told through Nash's viewpoint, so any variation or change in the story eventually leads back to Nash and his condition or feelings at the time.Because the film focuses so much time on Nash, other characters are not as fully developed. Alicia, Nash's wife, is well played by Jennifer Connelly. Her character gives Nash a lot of emotional support and lives through some very trying times. But other characters, such as Parcher and Nash's roommate at college are given a lot of screen time, but don't really develop. Where did Nash's roommate come from? What is his story? Why is Parcher so gung-ho about fighting the spies? I realize that the answer to my questions are tied into the subject matter of the film, but I still think a little more background on these characters would have made the film even more rich and outstanding.Small complaints aside, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of the best films I have seen this year. As I left the theater, I walked right into the neighboring Brentano's and purchased the book the film is based on. Because I wanted to know even more about this amazing person. I don't think any higher compliment can be paid to a film biography.",4,A Beautiful Film,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,6156,"['period', 'week', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'two', 'very', 'different',

590775,A79Y9MC6OD8UO,B00005JKQZ,Timothy Cade,"[0, 0]","This is positively one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Russel Crowe (The Insider, Gladiator, Proof of Life) gives one of the best perfomances of his career. This movie deserves the four awards that it won and possibly the Best Actor Award if politics had not got in the way. It is very powerful and moving.

Everyone can use a good little cry now and then, and Ron Howard has a way of delivering.There are several powerful things about this movie that make it work.The first is, of course, the fact that it's based on a true story.  There is nothing like knowing there are real human hearts behind the drama on the screen to really draw you in.The second is the stunning cast.  Russell Crowe is amazing as the menatlly tortured John Nash, the mathematical genius whose work changes the face of economic theory, yet who finds himself crippled by schizophrenia.  Russell plays the paranoid schizophrenic doctor with poignancy and an intense vulnerability.  Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as his wife, Alicia, who has to make the decision whether to stand by him and fight, or find more placid life of her own.  She plays the part with such love and openness that when she goes into the bathroom and screams in frustration, you feel it deep within your soul.  The supporting cast, including such distinguished talent as Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer, is just as brilliant, bringing the story together with skill.The third is the method in which the story is told.  Warning, if you haven't seen it, do NOT read most of the reviews below.  They will spoil one of the most important aspects of the story that is critical to identifying with John Nash's quandry.  Suffice to say that Ron Howard does the job and you will be delighted.This movie is wonderful and inspiring.

There are alot of valid negatives I have heard about this movie but I keep coming back to how I *felt* when I saw the movie and that was over-whelmingly positive.A movie is not a book and can't be and shouldn't be.  Movies too true to books are rarely good movies.  A movie also rarely is a good documentary... Or a good biography, for that matter.  A movie is a creative thing unto itself that has to have some amount of creative liscense just because of what it is.  It isn't the last word in any subject, it's not a history lesson.  I think it qualifies as entertainment.  That this had an overall extreamly positive message to me was a welcomed added bonus.I think John Nash is a remarkable man.  I have read a few short auto-biographical pieces that he has written and they have the same wonderful yet quirky feel that I saw in Russel Crow's performance.  I think perhaps the movie captured his overall gestault better than it did actual events...but than I didn't go to see a news reel.  The fact is that there are remarkable people among us.  And within these remarkable people are people afflicted with mental illness.To me this movie posed the questions:  Does the illness allow some people to escape the bounds of the rational and see solutions that others would not consider?  Does the illness itself generate the sparks of genius as well as the madness? or are they separate?  Would he have been the same without the illness?When I watch TV, and every mentally person is a homeless person or accused of a crime....or not ill but claiming to have *heard voices*...  it was, frankly, wonderful to see a portrayal  lives touched by illness with sensitivity.  To see there is actually a person beyond the illness and a family...and friends...  and success.  That the person is more than just the diagnosis.No, it wasn't a direct biography.  Yes, there are inconsistancies.  If that matters to you, than perhaps you will be let down.

Schizophrenia is such a complex mental illness that it is quite difficult even to explain and discuss with those who are uneducated about it. Symptons are varied and each person is affected differently. In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard has pulled off an Oscar-worthy job of exploring one man's struggle with the illness through the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. The film skips a great deal of Nash's life. However, in the two and a half hours that the movie runs, the audience is caught up in the life and mentality of Nash. No film can truly do justice to a person's life and achievements. However, movies can educate and inform us of greatness within our midst that would go otherwise unnoticed. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is such a film. Contrary to what some have suggested, the film deals with schizophrenia in a tasteful and thoughtful manner, illumining the audience to the false reality that schizophrenics exist within.Russell Crowe is once again superb and earned another Oscar nomination with his performance of Nash. Though he is often cast as a matinee-idol-type star, films like this illustrate his skill and display that he has become one of Hollywood's elite not solely because of his looks (aka Tom Cruise), but because of his talent.Jennifer Connelly also pulls of an Oscar-worthy performance as Nash's wife. I've been a fan of Connelly since her early days starring in LABYRINTH and it's great to finally see her beginning to receive the recognition she deserves. She more than holds her own against the strong charisma of Russell Crowe.The movie does not have a great deal of time to deal with the relationship between Nash and his wife. Nevertheless, the film briefly touches upon their relationship without becoming sappy.Overall, a wonderful movie with great acting, exploring the horror of schizophrenia and the power of love.",5,Beauty Within,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1926,"['Schizophrenia', 'mental', 'illness', 'most', 'Americans', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Schizophrenia', 'such', 'complex', 'mental', 'illness', 'quite', 'difficult', 'even', 'explain', 'discuss', 'who', 'are', 'uneducated', 'Symptons', 'are', 'varied', 'person', 'affected', 'differently', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'pulled', 'off', 'Oscar-worthy', 'job', 'exploring', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'illness', 'life', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'John', 'Nash', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'Nash', 'life', 'However', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'movie', 'audience', 'caught', 'up', 'life', 'mentality', 'Nash', 'film', 'can', 'truly', 'do', 'justice', 'person', 'life', 'achievements', 'However', 'movies', 'can', 'educate', 'inform', 'greatness', 'midst', 'would', 'go', 'otherwise', 'unnoticed', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'such', 'film', 'Contrary', 'what', 'have', 'suggested', 'film', 'deals', 'schizophrenia', 'tasteful', 'thoughtful', 'manner', 'illumining', 'audience', 'false', 'reality', 'schizophrenics', 'exist', 'within.Russell', 'Crowe', 'once', 'again', 'superb', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Nash', 'often', 'cast', 'matinee-idol-type', 'star', 'films', 'illustrate', 'skill', 'display', 'become', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'not', 'solely', 'looks', 'aka', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'talent.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'also', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Nash', 'wife', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Connelly', 'early', 'days', 'starring', 'LABYRINTH', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'beginning', 'receive', 'recognition', 'more', 'own', 'strong', 'charisma', 'Russell', 'Crowe.The', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'deal', 'relationship', 'Nash', 'wife', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'briefly', 'touches', 'relationship', 'becoming', 'sappy.Overall', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'exploring', 'horror', 'schizophrenia', 'power', 'love']",N/A

I was not expecting the ""twist"" and it threw me for a loop. It is obvious Ron Howard has grown as a director in this film. It reminds me of Tom Hanks' career. For years he was known as the king of romantic comedy and now he is considered one of our greatest actors. But back then, who knew. I hope Howard takes chances like this in the future. Great story telling with a camera.As far as the DVD goes, the shameless differentiation between the real Nash and Crowe's Nash are a bit off-putting, but are nonetheless an interesting feature. Instead of a speech given at the awards as in the movie, some old dame with a tiara puts a medal around his neck. The commentary is also good and Ron does goof on the fact that is brother Clint is only heard in a sound bite instead of seen as in most of his movies. Maybe that's why it got best picture.Speaking of which, I am one of the few that actually can see the reasoning why A Beautiful Mind picked up a few oscars. Howard wins the Julia Roberts oscar. She won because she actually acted, he won because he actually directed. This is his best film since Appolo 13, which was a neat hat trick. It is a good movie with great acting and a phenomenal story.

Sure, there are plenty of science fiction movies about somebody conceiving, designing, and building some amazing vehicle or weapon in one fell swoop, (like Cochran and warp drive in Star Trek) but these are no more than fantasies which bear no relation to actual achievements in science and engineering.  This movie about a character who we might (if we were to find ourselves in a sufficiently generous mood) be described as modeled on John Nash, comes close to bringing into view the world of applied mathematicians.  Indeed, the first half hour of the movie dealing with Nash as a graduate student, strikes a familiar chord.  Hanging out with your grad school buddies at the local pub to discuss the great issues of to day or to formulate unworkable strategies for picking up girls is wonderfully familiar.  The unification of these two activities into the epiphany needed to supercharge your Ph.D. thesis was very satisfying--even if it had nothing to do with anything John Nash had ever experienced--or had any true relation to his work.For my part, I don't care if any of this movie has anything at all to do with the real John Nash.  I just like the way this movie conveys the excitement of conceiving of and working out a brilliant new theory.  Never would I have thought that a scene consisting of someone scribbling on a few pieces of paper could seem so magical--and in a way that I can clearly identify with my own experience.  The seasons pass--but there is John Nash joyfully working with his equations and diagrams!  Also wonderful are the scenes involving Nash and his Ph.D. adviser.  From the initial point where the adviser regards Nash as a kind of goof-off grad student who neither attends classes nor publishes journal articles--to the point where Nash finally wows him with his wonderful new take on economics and game theory--it certainly rang true to me!  I also loved the Nash character's comment to a fellow student that ""Classes will dull your mind and block the way to authentic creativity.""  I hated grad school courses with a passion and could not wait to get out from under them!I was also taken with the story of Nash meeting and courting the nurturing woman who became his wife (played by the very appealing Jennifer Connelly, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role).  Her character reminded me of meeting my own wonderful wife--and of her efforts (similar to those of Nash's wife) to connect with me and bring me closer to something resembling reality.Of course most of this movie dealt with the rather extreme mental problems of the pseudo Nash title character.  These experiences are too far outside of my experience for me to identify with them in anything close to my visceral response to the film's portrait of Nash's alleged grad school days.  This mental breakdown part of the story is actually more interesting in Sylvia Nasser's book, in accord with the veracity of the old ""truth is stranger than fiction"" axiom.",5,Hardly at all like John Nash himself or anything he ever experienced--but that's okay!,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,3140,"['are', 'many', 'movies', 'sports', 'thrill', 'scoring', 'touchdown', 'home', 'run', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'address', 'passion', 'intellectual', 'achievement', 'Sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'somebody', 'conceiving', 'designing', 'building', 'amazing', 'vehicle', 'weapon', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'Cochran', 'warp', 'drive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'more', 'fantasies', 'bear', 'relation', 'actual', 'achievements', 'science', 'engineering', 'movie', 'character', 'who', 'might', 'were', 'find', 'sufficiently', 'generous', 'mood', 'be', 'described', 'modeled', 'John', 'Nash', 'close', 'bringing', 'view', 'world', 'applied', 'mathematicians', 'Indeed', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'dealing', 'Nash', 'graduate', 'student', 'familiar', 'chord', 'Hanging', 'out', 'grad', 'school', 'buddies', 'local', 'pub', 'discuss', 'great', 'issues', 'day', 'formulate', 'unworkable', 'strategies', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'wonderfully', 'familiar', 'unification', 'two', 'activities', 'epiphany', 'needed', 'supercharge', 'Ph.D.', 'thesis', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying', 'even', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'John', 'Nash', 'had', 'ever', 'experienced', 'had', 'true', 'relation', 'work.For', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'anything', 'do', 'real', 'John', 'Nash', 'just', 'way', 'movie', 'excitement', 'conceiving', 'working', 'out', 'brilliant', 'new', 'theory', 'Never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'scene', 'consisting', 'someone', 'scribbling', 'few', 'pieces', 'paper', 'could', 'seem', 'so', 'magical', 'way', 'can', 'clearly', 'identify', 'own', 'experience', 'seasons', 'pass', 'John', 'Nash', 'joyfully', 'working', 'equations', 'diagrams', 'Also', 'wonderful', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Nash', 'Ph.D.', 'adviser', 'initial', 'point', 'where', 'adviser', 'regards', 'Nash', 'kind', 'goof-off', 'grad', 'student', 'who', 'classes', 'publishes', 'journal', 'articles', 'point', 'where', 'Nash', 'finally', 'wonderful', 'new', 'take', 'economics', 'game', 'theory', 'certainly', 'true', 'also', 'loved', 'Nash', 'character', 'comment', 'fellow', 'student', 'Classes', 'will', 'dull', 'mind', 'block', 'way', 'authentic', 'creativity', 'hated', 'grad', 'school', 'courses', 'passion', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'out', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'story', 'Nash', 'meeting', 'courting', 'nurturing', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'wife', 'played', 'very', 'appealing', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role', 'character', 'reminded', 'meeting', 'own', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'efforts', 'similar', 'Nash', 'wife', 'connect', 'bring', 'closer', 'something', 'resembling', 'reality.Of', 'course', 'most', 'movie', 'dealt', 'rather', 'extreme', 'mental', 'problems', 'pseudo', 'Nash', 'title', 'character', 'experiences', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'experience', 'identify', 'anything', 'close', 'visceral', 'response', 'film', 'portrait', 'Nash', 'alleged', 'grad', 'school', 'days', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'part', 'story', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'Sylvia', 'Nasser', 'book', 'accord', 'veracity', 'old', 'truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'axiom']",N/A
590789,AL6JIT43D8D4Z,B00005JKQZ,"unraveler ""unraveler""","[3, 5]","This is a masterfully made movie. What it lacks in historical accuracy, it balances with imagination, suspense, and outstanding performance by the entire cast. Making a movie about a mathematician for the mass market is a daunting task, but Ron Howard, the cast, and the entire crew more than met the challenge. Everybody here is a potential Oscar nominee, and if the make up crew does not get one, something is rotten in Hollywood. The approach chosen in this film is to show the effect of schizophrenia from the inside, from the perspective of the genius-sufferer John Nash. The director uses this manuever to full advantage, including the use of a fatal car chase and some gore, which of course would have been impossible without Nash's paranoid delusions.Perhaps purists, who demand historical accuracy, will be less than satisfied with the film, but I do not believe that Howard could have made a more historically complete choice and still kept his audience. For one thing, Nash was neither as pathetic, nor as lovable, as he is portrayed in the film. In his younger days as a student at Princeton, his arrogance and sarcasm overshadowed his aloofness and early symptoms of incipient schizophrenia. This is not quite what the movie portrays. Second, Nash's real life story is far more complicated than a two-hour uplifting life/love story that is the movie. Many important details about him are left out for the sake of idealistic aspirations of the movie. For example, there is no mention of his early homosexual tendencies; his brief life with his mistress and the child they had together; his work for the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica (yes, Nash did have a security clearance and access to classified information, which he lost soon after he made a pass to an undercover police officer in a public bathroom--in this sense George Michael is a case of dejavu); the fact that he and Alicia got divorced after Nash fell ill, even though Alicia did take him back in 1970; the fact that his second child, which he had with Alicia, became mentally ill in his teens and remains so to this day, as far as I know; the fact that when Nash experienced spontaneous remission he again became overly critical and even sometimes cruel toward those who loved him. I think you get the picture: Nash's life story is complicated and is less idealistic and uplifting than the movie. Even his paranoid tendencies were less rational and humane than the movie shows. As far as I remember, his problem did NOT lie in seeing nonexistent people. After all, how terrible is it to have an imaginary friend, an overzealous government employer, and to fear Russian spies? In truth, Nash believed that space aliens made him the King of Antarctica, that the U.S. and NATO hated him for some reason (he traveled to Europe and tried to give up his U.S. citizenship with amazing persistence), and that it was alien messages from outer space, not Russian codes that he had to decipher. But if you want to know more, read the book by the same title. The movie stands alone as a superb work of cinematography and as an uplifting, if not entirely true story. The basic premise however is true: Nash was a mentally ill genius and Alicia was a saint.",5,Unhinged Mind in the Movies,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,3221,"['masterfully', 'made', 'movie', 'What', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'imagination', 'suspense', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'Making', 'movie', 'mathematician', 'mass', 'market', 'daunting', 'task', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'cast', 'entire', 'crew', 'more', 'met', 'challenge', 'Everybody', 'here', 'potential', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'make', 'up', 'crew', 'not', 'get', 'one', 'something', 'rotten', 'Hollywood', 'approach', 'chosen', 'film', 'show', 'effect', 'schizophrenia', 'inside', 'perspective', 'genius-sufferer', 'John', 'Nash', 'director', 'manuever', 'full', 'advantage', 'including', 'use', 'fatal', 'car', 'chase', 'gore', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'Nash', 'paranoid', 'delusions.Perhaps', 'purists', 'who', 'demand', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'satisfied', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Howard', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'historically', 'complete', 'choice', 'still', 'kept', 'audience', 'one', 'thing', 'Nash', 'was', 'pathetic', 'lovable', 'portrayed', 'film', 'younger', 'days', 'student', 'Princeton', 'arrogance', 'sarcasm', 'overshadowed', 'aloofness', 'early', 'symptoms', 'incipient', 'schizophrenia', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'movie', 'Second', 'Nash', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'complicated', 'two-hour', 'uplifting', 'life/love', 'story', 'movie', 'Many', 'important', 'details', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'sake', 'idealistic', 'aspirations', 'movie', 'example', 'mention', 'early', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'brief', 'life', 'mistress', 'child', 'had', 'together', 'work', 'RAND', 'Corporation', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'yes', 'Nash', 'did', 'have', 'security', 'clearance', 'access', 'classified', 'information', 'lost', 'soon', 'made', 'pass', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'public', 'bathroom', 'sense', 'George', 'Michael', 'case', 'dejavu', 'fact', 'Alicia', 'got', 'divorced', 'Nash', 'fell', 'ill', 'even', 'Alicia', 'did', 'take', 'back', '1970', 'fact', 'second', 'child', 'had', 'Alicia', 'became', 'mentally', 'ill', 'teens', 'so', 'day', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'fact', 'when', 'Nash', 'experienced', 'spontaneous', 'remission', 'again', 'became', 'overly', 'critical', 'even', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'who', 'loved', 'think', 'get', 'picture', 'Nash', 'life', 'story', 'complicated', 'less', 'idealistic', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'Even', 'paranoid', 'tendencies', 'were', 'less', 'rational', 'humane', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'remember', 'problem', 'did', 'NOT', 'lie', 'seeing', 'nonexistent', 'people', 'how', 'terrible', 'have', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'overzealous', 'government', 'employer', 'fear', 'Russian', 'spies', 'truth', 'Nash', 'believed', 'space', 'aliens', 'made', 'King', 'Antarctica', 'U.S.', 'NATO', 'hated', 'reason', 'traveled', 'Europe', 'tried', 'give', 'up', 'U.S.', 'citizenship', 'amazing', 'persistence', 'was', 'alien', 'messages', 'outer', 'space', 'not', 'Russian', 'codes', 'had', 'decipher', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'movie', 'alone', 'superb', 'work', 'cinematography', 'uplifting', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'however', 'true', 'Nash', 'was', 'mentally', 'ill', 'genius', 'Alicia', 'was', 'saint']",N/A

This, instead, focuses on Nash's battle with mental illness. When a director makes a film they have to choose a path to tell a story--unlike a book it's extremely difficult to take a story like Nash's and condense it into a two hour narrative. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Avika Goldsman chose the most clear pathway (and using a literary device called ""the unreliable narrator)--Nash's brilliance in mathematics AND his slide into mental illness.The Blu-ray release from Universal features an exceptional looking high def transfer. Colors are nicely captured. The Blu-ray captures Roger Deakins' photography with good detail and textures.The transfer exhibits the changing color scheme and textures as John Nash becomes increasingly paranoid. Image detail/sharpness is a tad inconsistent but I suspect that has more to do with the intent of the director and Deakins' decisions in how the scenes are photographed. Edge enhancement crops up quite a bit which is distracting but it isn't the worst I've seen in some films.There isn't anything new that I noticed in the special features but it does appear as if almost all of  the extras have been ported over from the regular DVD edition. The only thing I detected as missing were the clips from the Academy Awards. The two commentary tracks are in tact as well featuring director Ron Howard and writer Avika Goldsman. Unfortunately, all of the extras are presented in standard definition.What's clever and works really well in ""A Beautiful Mind"" is the WAY that Howard and Goldsman have decided to tell the story; they make us identify with shy, charismatic John Nash, realize how brilliant he is, see his experience at the University from HIS perspective. Howard and Goldsman then turn our expectations on its head by demonstrating that much of what WE experienced with Nash may or may not be real and that he suffers from schizophrenia. We discover that a lot of what Nash ""knows"" to be true isn't at all and that he lives in a world of shadows suggesting reality but often never touching on it.There was plenty of criticism about the fact that ""A Beautiful Mind"" wasn't faithful to the book of the same name and played down Nash's bisexuality, racism and other personal issues. As fascinating as Nash's life is, the film fictionalizes Nash's experience and focuses on his unexpected journey into madness pulling us, the audience, into the rabbit hole with Nash. It's a clever conceit and one that works well allowing us to both understand Nash, sympathize with him enough so that WE feel like we are sliding down into the same madness that has consumed him.The bottom line is that this is an extremely good upgrade picture wise for ""A Beautiful Mind"". The film doesn't have a perfect presentation and there are some flaws (such as edge enhancement)but, on the whole, it looks exceptionally good.",5,Exceptional film that focuses on John Nash's battle with mental illness from Nash's point-of-view,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,3001,"['First', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'up', 'front', 'THIS', ""n't"", 'biography', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'John', 'Nash', 'genius', 'as', 'well', 'flaws', 'instead', 'focuses', 'Nash', 'battle', 'mental', 'illness', 'When', 'director', 'film', 'have', 'choose', 'path', 'tell', 'story', 'book', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'take', 'story', 'Nash', 'condense', 'two', 'hour', 'narrative', 'Director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'screenwriter', 'Avika', 'Goldsman', 'chose', 'most', 'clear', 'pathway', 'using', 'literary', 'device', 'called', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'Nash', 'brilliance', 'mathematics', 'slide', 'mental', 'illness.The', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'Universal', 'exceptional', 'looking', 'high', 'def', 'transfer', 'Colors', 'are', 'nicely', 'captured', 'Blu-ray', 'captures', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'photography', 'good', 'detail', 'textures.The', 'transfer', 'changing', 'color', 'scheme', 'textures', 'John', 'Nash', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'Image', 'detail/sharpness', 'tad', 'inconsistent', 'suspect', 'more', 'do', 'intent', 'director', 'Deakins', 'decisions', 'how', 'scenes', 'are', 'photographed', 'Edge', 'enhancement', 'crops', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'distracting', ""n't"", 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films.There', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'noticed', 'special', 'features', 'appear', 'almost', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'ported', 'regular', 'DVD', 'edition', 'only', 'thing', 'detected', 'missing', 'were', 'clips', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'tact', 'well', 'featuring', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'writer', 'Avika', 'Goldsman', 'Unfortunately', 'extras', 'are', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition.What', 'clever', 'really', 'well', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'WAY', 'Howard', 'Goldsman', 'have', 'decided', 'tell', 'story', 'make', 'identify', 'shy', 'charismatic', 'John', 'Nash', 'realize', 'how', 'brilliant', 'see', 'experience', 'University', 'HIS', 'perspective', 'Howard', 'Goldsman', 'then', 'turn', 'expectations', 'head', 'demonstrating', 'much', 'what', 'WE', 'experienced', 'Nash', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'schizophrenia', 'discover', 'lot', 'what', 'Nash', 'knows', 'be', 'true', ""n't"", 'world', 'shadows', 'suggesting', 'reality', 'often', 'never', 'touching', 'it.There', 'was', 'plenty', 'criticism', 'fact', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'faithful', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'played', 'down', 'Nash', 'bisexuality', 'racism', 'other', 'personal', 'issues', 'As', 'fascinating', 'Nash', 'life', 'film', 'Nash', 'experience', 'focuses', 'unexpected', 'journey', 'madness', 'pulling', 'audience', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Nash', 'clever', 'conceit', 'one', 'well', 'allowing', 'understand', 'Nash', 'sympathize', 'enough', 'WE', 'feel', 'are', 'sliding', 'down', 'same', 'madness', 'consumed', 'him.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'extremely', 'good', 'upgrade', 'picture', 'wise', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'presentation', 'are', 'flaws', 'such', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'whole', 'exceptionally', 'good']",N/A

Russell Crowe is a very talented actor, he proved that to in ""Gladiator"" back in 2000; yet it's a little off course from what John Nash's real life is about.I looked into it more, and found out that John Nash was actually bi-sexual.  This is something that the movie never really hinted at all. I'm not to sure, now that I think about it, but that's pretty significant information that is being withheld.  I guess they omitted it to give us a better opinion of the character; at least that's what I came up with. Another thing that was left out was the fact that Nash eventually got divorced from his wife.  Which is no surprise, they almost made it seem in the movie as if his wife would leave him.  But it did allow the film to be more gratifying and uplifting.I did like the movie; even if some key parts were left out to better the film's stature.  I mean, they do say: ""BASED on a true story"".  And I can only assume that the main message from John Nash's life story was covered.  On a much more positive note, the direction of the movie was outstanding.  Ron Howard gave us probably his best directing performance since 1995, when he released the blockbuster hit ""Apollo 13"".

Crowe does a superb job of balancing the highs and the lows of Nobel economics laureate John Forbes Nash, whose gifts in mathematics coincide with his schizophrenia.Jennifer Connelly blends into the story mix with her highly supportive role of Crowe's wife.  When his long, hard struggle with adversity culminates in the Nobel Prize the emotional highlight of the film arises when Crowe looks into the audience and exclaims, while staring directly at Connelly, that he never could have realized his achievement without love.  He was paying his wife the highest tribute for her unflagging cooperation in the wake of adversity.In dealing with a subject such as schizophrenia, Howard was confronted with the decision of just how to approach it.  He decided on a communicative vehicle that was highly cinematic and enriching in terms of understanding the man and his difficulties.  Howard presents dramatic sequences which Crowe as Nash was convinced actually occurred, even though they were imagined and were an integral part of his schizophrenia.  Ed Harris assumes the role of a master handler leading his subject to clandestine activities, the goal preventing the Soviets from unleashing their powerful nuclear arsenal against America.  Crowe also encounters a happy go lucky roommate who ultimately teaches literature at Harvard, a boozy, &quot;let's enjoy life&quot; intellectual with a reverence for D.H. Lawrence.  His irreverence and &quot;What's the difference?&quot; insouciance is a welcome contrast for Crowe to his own often tragic formality.  Crowe then meets the former roommate's young niece, for whom he quickly develops an affinity.  We then find out from Crowe's psychiatrist, played with just the proper note of empathic sensitivity by Christopher Plummer, that Crowe had no roommate while at Princeton!Another interesting aspect of the film is the recognition by Crowe as Nash that he is truly different from other people.  &quot;We're a couple of odd ducks,&quot; he tells Connelly his student, girlfriend, and ultimately loyal wife.  We see how he copes with social awkwardness in his quest to become the best mathematician he can be.",5,A Grand Triumph,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,2559,"['grand', 'triumph', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'level', 'big', 'hit', 'eighties', 'quot', 'Cocoon', 'quot', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'dug', 'last', 'ounce', 'intensity', 'feeling', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'quot', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'man', 'who', 'exceedingly', 'gifted', 'one', 'hand', 'riddled', 'problems', 'other', 'Crowe', 'superb', 'job', 'balancing', 'highs', 'lows', 'Nobel', 'economics', 'laureate', 'John', 'Forbes', 'Nash', 'gifts', 'mathematics', 'coincide', 'schizophrenia.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'story', 'mix', 'highly', 'supportive', 'role', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'When', 'long', 'hard', 'struggle', 'adversity', 'culminates', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'emotional', 'highlight', 'film', 'when', 'Crowe', 'audience', 'exclaims', 'staring', 'directly', 'Connelly', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'realized', 'achievement', 'love', 'was', 'paying', 'wife', 'highest', 'tribute', 'unflagging', 'cooperation', 'wake', 'adversity.In', 'dealing', 'subject', 'such', 'schizophrenia', 'Howard', 'was', 'confronted', 'decision', 'just', 'how', 'approach', 'decided', 'communicative', 'vehicle', 'was', 'highly', 'cinematic', 'enriching', 'terms', 'understanding', 'man', 'difficulties', 'Howard', 'dramatic', 'sequences', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'was', 'convinced', 'actually', 'occurred', 'even', 'were', 'imagined', 'were', 'integral', 'part', 'schizophrenia', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'role', 'master', 'handler', 'leading', 'subject', 'clandestine', 'activities', 'goal', 'preventing', 'Soviets', 'unleashing', 'powerful', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'America', 'Crowe', 'also', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'roommate', 'who', 'ultimately', 'literature', 'Harvard', 'boozy', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'life', 'quot', 'intellectual', 'reverence', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'irreverence', 'quot', 'What', 'difference', 'quot', 'insouciance', 'welcome', 'contrast', 'Crowe', 'own', 'often', 'tragic', 'formality', 'Crowe', 'then', 'former', 'roommate', 'young', 'niece', 'whom', 'quickly', 'affinity', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'Crowe', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'just', 'proper', 'note', 'empathic', 'sensitivity', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Crowe', 'had', 'roommate', 'Princeton', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'recognition', 'Crowe', 'Nash', 'truly', 'different', 'other', 'people', 'quot', ""'re"", 'couple', 'odd', 'ducks', 'quot', 'Connelly', 'student', 'girlfriend', 'ultimately', 'loyal', 'wife', 'see', 'how', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'quest', 'become', 'best', 'mathematician', 'can', 'be']",N/A
590795,ACGOJPYFXEHHK,B00005JKQZ,Xavier Thelakkatt,"[5, 7]","'A Beautiful Mind' directed by Ron Howard, acted out by Russell Crowe, Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly tries to portray the incredible life story of John Nash an exceptionally gifted Mathematician haunted by schizophrenic delusions. The movie is based on the life of the Nobel Prize winner, a biography of whom was written by Sylvia Nasar, named 'Beautiful Mind'. Russell Crowe's gripping portrayal of the young socially awkward Princeton student, the husband and parent tortured by delusions and the magnanimous and mature Nobel Prize winner, is worthy of commendation. He is well supported by the loving wife (Jennifer Connelly) and the Department of Defense Agent (Ed Harris)The movie begins as Nash arrives at Princeton University where his eccentricities are revealed among the students and the staff alike. Here he develops a ground breaking economic theory, which gives him enough popularity to be on the front cover of Forbes magazine and to win an MIT professorship. But later his schizophrenic delusions would cause his dismissal. In the meantime, he meets Alicia a diligent student of his, whom he eventually marries. She proves to be a devoted and caring wife. The delusory world of Nash is populated by a 'prodigal room mate' with a fascination for D H Lawrence, an orphaned little girl and the Department of Defense Agent who is desperately after Nash in his work against the Russians. A psychiatrist enters the scene to tell the audience that these were mere creations of Nash's mind. The ordeal of psychiatric treatment and medications that follow, leaves him an emotional wreck. He now decides to recover his life without the aid of any medication. With the help of a friend he finds his way back to Princeton where he gradually wins the acclaim of the students and the esteem of the professors. Finally in 1994 he accepts in Stockholm the Nobel Prize for his economic theory, an achievement of his distant youth.Ron Howard deserves credit for the well-crafted and superbly presented story of a genius' struggles with schizophrenia. But as many critics have pointed out he risks idealizing the Nobel Prize winner by ignoring some pertinent aspects of his life, like his homosexual encounters, his illegitimate child, his arrest for indecent exposure, his divorce and remarriage, and his decision to renounce American citizenship.  The movie makes the profound statement that the nature of the mind is not fully comprehensible. It also draws attention to the plight of those who suffer from mental illness in the society and the need for greater understanding and empathy. The film has a gripping effect on the average moviegoer.",4,A Beautiful Movie on the Mystery of the Mind,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,2645,"['Beautiful', 'Mind', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'acted', 'out', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'portray', 'incredible', 'life', 'story', 'John', 'Nash', 'exceptionally', 'gifted', 'Mathematician', 'haunted', 'schizophrenic', 'delusions', 'movie', 'based', 'life', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'biography', 'whom', 'was', 'written', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'named', ""'Beautiful"", 'Mind', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'gripping', 'portrayal', 'young', 'socially', 'awkward', 'Princeton', 'student', 'husband', 'parent', 'tortured', 'delusions', 'magnanimous', 'mature', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'worthy', 'commendation', 'well', 'supported', 'loving', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Department', 'Defense', 'Agent', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'movie', 'Nash', 'Princeton', 'University', 'where', 'eccentricities', 'are', 'revealed', 'students', 'staff', 'alike', 'Here', 'ground', 'breaking', 'economic', 'theory', 'enough', 'popularity', 'be', 'front', 'cover', 'Forbes', 'magazine', 'win', 'MIT', 'professorship', 'later', 'schizophrenic', 'delusions', 'would', 'cause', 'dismissal', 'meantime', 'diligent', 'student', 'whom', 'eventually', 'be', 'devoted', 'caring', 'wife', 'delusory', 'world', 'Nash', 'populated', ""'prodigal"", 'room', 'mate', 'fascination', 'D', 'H', 'Lawrence', 'orphaned', 'little', 'girl', 'Department', 'Defense', 'Agent', 'who', 'desperately', 'Nash', 'work', 'Russians', 'psychiatrist', 'scene', 'tell', 'audience', 'were', 'mere', 'creations', 'Nash', 'mind', 'ordeal', 'psychiatric', 'treatment', 'medications', 'follow', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'now', 'recover', 'life', 'aid', 'medication', 'help', 'friend', 'way', 'back', 'Princeton', 'where', 'gradually', 'acclaim', 'students', 'esteem', 'professors', 'Finally', '1994', 'Stockholm', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'economic', 'theory', 'achievement', 'distant', 'youth.Ron', 'Howard', 'credit', 'well-crafted', 'superbly', 'presented', 'story', 'genius', 'struggles', 'schizophrenia', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'idealizing', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'ignoring', 'pertinent', 'aspects', 'life', 'homosexual', 'encounters', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'arrest', 'indecent', 'exposure', 'divorce', 'remarriage', 'decision', 'renounce', 'American', 'citizenship', 'movie', 'profound', 'statement', 'nature', 'mind', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehensible', 'also', 'attention', 'plight', 'who', 'suffer', 'mental', 'illness', 'society', 'need', 'greater', 'understanding', 'empathy', 'film', 'gripping', 'effect', 'average', 'moviegoer']",N/A

As Nash becomes obsessed with his work, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) begins to wonder whether or not John is truly &#34;working&#34; at all.  To say any more would completely ruin the plot.I could write an essay on why this movie is so great, but to do so would give away key plot details that would ruin the experience for you.  Suffice it to say, though, that there are plot twists that you won't see coming even if you know that some are coming!  Plus, thanks to the direction of Ron Howard, this is the kind of movie that really isn't even about the &#34;twist&#34;.  It is more about the extraordinary life of Mr. Nash.The acting in &#34;A Beautiful Mind&#34; is also top-notch.  As I've said in other reviews of movies starring Crowe, I cannot recall him EVER turning in a bad performance on screen.  I mean, the same guy who can play a Gladiator in one movie and and boxer in another (&#34;Cinderella Man&#34;) can almost effortlessly (although I'm sure it isn't) transform himself into a much more cerebral role here.  Co-stars Connelly and Harris play nice supporting roles as well, especially Connelly as Nash's wife who quite literally cannot believe what she is seeing from her husband on occasion.Thus, I consider &#34;A Beautiful Mind&#34; to rank among my personal favorites.  It has an intriguing plot, yet focuses heavily on the characters to make you really feel for them.

590798,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,B00005JKQZ,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[2, 4]","Many argue this is the best picture of the year, and it very well may be.  Unfortunately, it's hard for anyone but a real critic to make such a claim, since it requires the viewing of every film produced in a year.  If A Beautiful Mind is indeed the best film of the year, then I might argue that perhaps it was a bad year for films.  I say this not because I was displeased by A Beautiful Mind, but simply because it did not live up to the expectations I hold for any picture that is attributed with the title ""Best Film of the Year.""And, indeed, there is much to like about this film.  It is a sensitive subject matter, and challenges the viewer to be jealous and frightened of the vivid life portrayed by actor Russell Crowe--and portrayed superbly at that.  It certainly must have presented a far greater challenge for the screenwriter and filmmakers to humanize the disease of schizophrenia and portray it in a manner that the audience would recognize and sympathize with.  It would be easy to show a man have delusions, but subtle touches where the audience observes Nash's calculations and his visualization of certain problems helps to convey the inner gift of the disease that a lesser film would have ignored.Perhaps most admirable is the way the film manages to cover the delusions and schizophrenic episodes without ever causing the audience to chuckle or divest themselves from the character's problems and reassert them to the seemingly absurd situations on screen.  It is indeed easy to laugh when one does not experience such problems, but the filmmakers successfully erase any shred of jollity from the more somber moments.  Ron Howard's direction is apt to say the least, and truly does succeed at the moments when Nash's abstract psychology is in full swing for the viewing audience.  Prone to intense revolutions around our protagonist and appropriately showy montages of abstract thought, the direction conveys the intimacies of the mind as perhaps never illustrated before on the big screen.However, not all aspects of the film will please--or rather some aspects that are missing from the film might detract.  In my own opinion, it was easy to start the film at Nash's induction into the Princeton doctoral program, however I was curious about what events lead to his malady.  It's easy to say that he came to college as an introvert, but what events caused that?  His parents were dead, the film tells us, but what bearing did this have on his personality?  So many questions about the young Nash and his association with people come to my mind that the film actually playing seems to be the second act of a longer work.  Moreover, the pacing comes across instantly as rapid and takes some coercion to get used to.  In the first few minutes of the film, Nash has apparently gone through years of college with little to know inflected transfer of time.  Obviously, much must be covered and the search for a film of tolerable length no doubt influenced both the neglected childhood years and the fast pace, but I certainly could have sat through an extended film to assuage my desires for the greater good of the film.But, ultimately, this film is beyond well done.  Again, I cannot say that this ISN?' the best film of the year--it very well might be the best film in a bad year.  Regardless, something left me still inquisitive about Nash's malady, feeling that its depiction wasn't fully explained.  As a film that goes into the character's mind, however, perhaps nothing has ever captured and injected the audience as wholly and fluidly.  Indeed, special effects have never before seemed more apt than to represent the inherent and private visualizations of the human imagination.  And that is really what makes this film a success: the depth of character and the attention to the imagination that was never so much a factor in a film before.  This is a film about the mind, as the title appropriately decrees; see it for that and be prepared to experience another man's life in another man's mind.",4,Best Film of The Year?

The only disappointment for me was that the movie was a whitewashed type of feel good vehicle for Ron Howard to do his typical (and typically well done) ""triumph of the human spirit"" silliness.  That doesn't cut down on the enjoyment factor, but it does mislead viewers into believing that John Nash, the subject of the movie, was a more wholesome person than history tells us he was.  The movie leaves out all of the unsavory moments in Nash's life, from his alleged torturing of animals as a child to his prior marriage and adultery (and some worse).
