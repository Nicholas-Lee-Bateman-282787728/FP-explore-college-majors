I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.""Overall, I enjoyed the film. Some of those involved are clearly more comfortable being onscreen as an actor than others, but no one was just horribly bad. I also grew tired of some of the more extreme quirkiness of a couple of the characters. I realize that it is standard to have those characters populate all small towns in films, but sometimes they go a bit beyond quirky. These complaints, however, are trivial matters in my overall impression of the film.The story line was good and was presented in a way that is palatable to most. There is no blood, violence, bad language, etc. to make it unacceptable for family viewing. The gospel is presented, but I feel this is more a film that gives the viewer a look at how following Christ has made an impact on the lives of the characters who are believers. Most of the people I know live out their faith like these people, so it was all familiar to me. Would I show this film to family and friends who are not believers? Yes, especially those who love music and/or baseball. I also recommend it to people who are believers and want to watch a Christian worldview film that both entertains and demonstrates the validity of living out their faith and following God's will.Btw, I LOVED the whole concept of ""ringing the bell""!!

1622172,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B00B58FWYA,Dad of Divas,"[1, 1]","In this heartwarming Christian story , a man who is an aggressive , high power sports agent tries to convince a high school baseball star to forgo attending college and allowing the agent to take him to the major leagues. What Rob Decker does not understand is that the people of Middletown have devoted their lives to following the path that God has shown them. Rob learns that he cannot change the mind of Shawn, the young baseball player.Rob has always put his career and company ahead of God and family, and it is not until he visits Middletown and the Cook family that he understands that he is missing something very valuable in his life. His visit to Middletown is life changing as Rob finally , through prayer, accepts Jesus in to his heart and rings the bell.The importance of the bell ringing is that the person ringing the bell is showing others that he has allowed Jesus into his heart and life. As you will see in the movie there is such rejoicing with the decision by the others in the story.This movie shows the importance of priorities in one's life. Where are your priorities? Are you a workaholic? Do you constantly put work in place of going to a child's sport event or concert? Do you pray and ask God for forgiveness and then allow his grace and love to enter into your heart and life?I believe this movie will help you with thinking about all of these questions and more.

But on his latest mission to sign a high school baseball superstar, Rob becomes stranded in a small town where the simplicity of life--and the faith of the people--stand in stark contrast to his own fast-paced, win-at-all-costs mindset. Torn between these two worlds, will Rob have the courage to let faith transform his life? This heartwarming story of redemption is sure to entertain and inspire the whole family.Ring The Bell features a host of well-known Christian music artists, such as Mark Hall along with his band Casting Crowns, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Matthew West, all who play a role in this inspirational drama. Several former and current Major League Baseball all-stars are also featured in the film: ESPN analysts John Kruk and Rick Sutcliffe (a former Cy Young Award winner), along with Ben Zobrist.This family-friendly movie was produced by Mark Miller, Beach Street Records' founder and Casting Crowns' producer.

Rob Decker a sports agent on a mission seems to think he has this one in the bag. He will talk this young man into signing with him and the agency he represents and he will turn around and head back home. But this little town and the people who live here give him a look into the ""real world"".

Rob Decker is a big city sports agent who has built an empire for himself on the backs of talented sports players.  He's ruthless, slick, and pretty obnoxious.  Fortunately, he has a secretary who's not afraid to stand up to him.  In Ring the Bell, Decker finds himself stranded in a pretty little town that is Maybury perfect.The mechanic assures him that he can walk from one end of town to the other in fifteen minutes; so, having no other choice, that's exactly what he does throughout the movie.  I found it amusing to see this dressed to the nines fast paced fellow slowed down to a comparative snail's pace.  Sometimes slowing down is exactly what we need to think.The townspeople are warm, friendly, sometimes funny, encouraging and overtly Christian.  In fact, this movie has the clearest, most direct, presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ that I've ever seen in a movie.  There is no dancing around the J word.  I really liked that.So, will it be a movie to show to unsaved friends and family?  Yes, I think so, especially if they're music or baseball fans.  Casting Crowns provides terrific music.

Wilkinson,"[3, 4]","Before I say anything about this movie, I think it's important to say that people watch movies for different reasons and their reviews of these movies are impacted by their motivations for watching them.  I bought and watched this movie in the hopes of being encouraged, edified, and generally pointed to Christ in the same way that I was when I watched &#34;Fireproof,&#34; &#34;Facing the Giants,&#34; &#34;The Printing,&#34; and &#34;Sheffey.&#34;  Needless to say, that didn't happen.  Other problems for me with this film included bad acting that was a distraction in and of itself, and an unrealistic and unbelievable story line (it just didn't seem real), and immodest dress worn by the main female character. The main character didn't seem like a real person at all.  His conversion also didn't seem realistic.  This movie just missed it's mark, I think, but I appreciate the efforts of my brethren to give it a try.

Not being a sport fan I almost dismissed this multi talented movie (including Steven Curtis Chapman, Marc Hall and his Casting Crowns and a cameo appearance of Matthew West). I only noticed the baseball feature (oops, sorry, not a fan!) and I would have missed so much!An amazing family movie with a beautiful message guaranteed to inspire even the most supercilious amongst us, Ring The Bell follows the engaging plot of the successful CEO and President of a sports agency whose mission is to sign up potential sports stars and of course make more money.This time however he faces a young man who has already decided on a different path, that of becoming a doctor and wants none of the gifts and big contract Rob offers him.Stranded in town, Rob attends a baseball match and discover amongst the players a face he has not seen in many years, possibly a bigger fish for his company to lend. But God has other plans!What follows is an eye opener for Rob who can no longer deny his life could be much more rewarding if only he has the courage to accept Christ in it!Two notes of interest in this special feature movie are first of all, the small part of the local minister played by none other than Steven Curtis Chapman. Welcoming Rob to town he tells him the story behind the quote on his church's billboard:'He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose'.For those familiar with 'Beyond the Gates of Splendor, see my review (HERE), it was like a bolt of lightning as I heard Steven's reminder of this unbelievable message of love and forgiveness!'Faith...Because they believed, they gave it all...'The second part was the talented Marc Hall and his Casting Crowns featured in concert in the little town Rob finds himself stranded into.

That is just what you'll find in the latest movie, Ring The Bell available on DVD from Provident Films. Ring the Bell is a calling to those individuals who still don't know what they are looking for in this world, but know that no matter what they have tried so far, it doesn't last. This is a calling to come to know God, in your own time and in your own way.Ring the Bell is about a prideful and self confident big city sports agent Rob Decker (Ryan Schaeon), who believes there is nothing he can't do or no one he can't sign. He represents the ""best of the best, because he is the best of the best."" He believes he is truly on top of his game as the owner of Decker Sports and all those who work for him should have the same attitude and motivation. When he locates the next ""big thing"" with small town high school student Shawn Hart, he is more than confident that he can get him signed. He is challenged to get Shawn Hart signed when his associate tells him he can't leave tell because of his son's game. So he heads up to Middletown to show his company's employees that he's still at the top of his game.However God's got other plans for Rob Decker. When his car breaks down and he has to spend some time in Middletown trying to convince Sean Hart that his future awaits with a simple signed contract that will change his life. But the more time that Rob spends in Middletown, the more the town and it's residents begin to grow on him in ways he never dreamed or imagined possible, from the perky inn keeper, Maggie (LOVE her personality and quirky way of seeing positives in every little thing she does), to the loveable mechanics that will fix Rob's car once they figure out where the engine is!The best part about this movie is the powerful message of grace and what it means to make the decision to come to know God in your life. Those that do, get the chance to Ring the Bell and let everyone else know about it. With Christian artists like Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns and Matthew West adding to the cast, it really makes the movie family friendly. Even notable baseball athletes Casey Bone, Ben Zobrist, John Kruk and Rick Sutcliff are part of the action. This is HANDS DOWN one of the best movies I've had the opportunity to watch and review with my entire family and they agree, it's a family favorite in our home now!I received Ring The Bell compliments of  Provident Films and Flyby Promotions for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. This is one YOU won't want to miss out on. If you love movies like Fireproof, Courageous and Facing the Giants, pick this one up. Already people are talking about this movie and how it is changing lives forever. This movie is perfect for all ages and I would encourage everyone to check this one out. 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion and that means not only do I highly recommend it, but it's one we will undoubtedly will watch over and over again. It's the perfect movie to share with those struggling to make their own decision to accept Christ and who knows may in fact Ring The Bell in their own time.",5,A MUST SEE movie for all ages!!!,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3280,"['love', 'when', 'find', 'movie', 'really', 'heart', 'deep', 'inside', 'creates', 'such', 'lasting', 'impression', 'find', 'thinking', 'long', 'over', 'just', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'latest', 'movie', 'Ring', 'Bell', 'available', 'DVD', 'Provident', 'Films', 'Ring', 'Bell', 'calling', 'individuals', 'who', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'world', 'know', 'matter', 'what', 'have', 'tried', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'last', 'calling', 'come', 'know', 'God', 'own', 'time', 'own', 'way.Ring', 'Bell', 'prideful', 'self', 'confident', 'big', 'city', 'sports', 'agent', 'Rob', 'Decker', 'Ryan', 'Schaeon', 'who', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sign', 'best', 'best', 'best', 'best', 'truly', 'top', 'game', 'owner', 'Decker', 'Sports', 'who', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'same', 'attitude', 'motivation', 'When', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'small', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Shawn', 'Hart', 'more', 'confident', 'can', 'get', 'signed', 'challenged', 'get', 'Shawn', 'Hart', 'signed', 'when', 'associate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'tell', 'son', 'game', 'So', 'up', 'Middletown', 'show', 'company', 'employees', 'still', 'top', 'game.However', 'God', 'got', 'other', 'plans', 'Rob', 'Decker', 'When', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'spend', 'time', 'Middletown', 'trying', 'convince', 'Sean', 'Hart', 'future', 'simple', 'signed', 'contract', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'more', 'time', 'Rob', 'Middletown', 'more', 'town', 'residents', 'begin', 'grow', 'ways', 'never', 'dreamed', 'imagined', 'possible', 'perky', 'inn', 'keeper', 'Maggie', 'LOVE', 'personality', 'quirky', 'way', 'seeing', 'positives', 'little', 'thing', 'loveable', 'mechanics', 'will', 'fix', 'Rob', 'car', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'engine', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'grace', 'what', 'make', 'decision', 'come', 'know', 'God', 'life', 'do', 'get', 'chance', 'Ring', 'Bell', 'let', 'everyone', 'else', 'know', 'Christian', 'artists', 'Steven', 'Curtis', 'Chapman', 'Casting', 'Crowns', 'Matthew', 'West', 'adding', 'cast', 'really', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'Even', 'notable', 'baseball', 'athletes', 'Casey', 'Bone', 'Ben', 'Zobrist', 'John', 'Kruk', 'Rick', 'Sutcliff', 'are', 'part', 'action', 'HANDS', 'DOWN', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'review', 'entire', 'family', 'agree', 'family', 'favorite', 'home', 'now', 'received', 'Ring', 'Bell', 'compliments', 'Provident', 'Films', 'Flyby', 'Promotions', 'honest', 'review', 'received', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'favorable', 'one', 'one', 'YOU', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'out', 'love', 'movies', 'Fireproof', 'Courageous', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'Already', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'movie', 'how', 'changing', 'lives', 'forever', 'movie', 'perfect', 'ages', 'would', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'check', 'one', 'out', '5', '5', 'stars', 'opinion', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'perfect', 'movie', 'share', 'struggling', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'accept', 'Christ', 'who', 'may', 'fact', 'Ring', 'Bell', 'own', 'time']",Ring the Bell
