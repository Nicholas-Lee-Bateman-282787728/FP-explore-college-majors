I was privileged to see Anna Moffo perform live in the Chicago Opera House as Lucia in 1957.  That was immediately after her television triumph in Italy as Madama Butterfly (1956, her Fulbright Scholarship years). Immediately after her Mad Scene, there was another mad scene.  This time it was the audience who went mad - an unheard-of 10 minutes of screaming ovation. That was THE most memorable opera experience in my lifetime.  I saw the great Joan Sutherland in the same role, same year, and same opera house.  She was superb.  Stupenda or not, she was not in Moffo's league.",5,The Greatest Lucia Ever,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,702,"['Anna', 'Moffo', 'Lucia', 'comparison', 'rest', 'cast', 'stunk', 'spite', 'handicap', '5-star', 'performance', 'was', 'privileged', 'see', 'Anna', 'Moffo', 'perform', 'live', 'Chicago', 'Opera', 'House', 'Lucia', '1957', 'was', 'immediately', 'television', 'triumph', 'Italy', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', '1956', 'Fulbright', 'Scholarship', 'years', 'Immediately', 'Mad', 'Scene', 'was', 'mad', 'scene', 'time', 'was', 'audience', 'who', 'went', 'mad', 'unheard-of', '10', 'minutes', 'screaming', 'ovation', 'was', 'most', 'memorable', 'opera', 'experience', 'lifetime', 'saw', 'great', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'same', 'role', 'same', 'year', 'same', 'opera', 'house', 'was', 'superb', 'Stupenda', 'not', 'was', 'not', 'Moffo', 'league']",N/A

(And no, this is not the place for reviews of ""Anna Bolena"" with Joan Sutherland!)  The settings include a real castle and real outdoor areas, which only enhance the emotional impact this opera would normally have. There is an amazing difference between this movie and an opera house production and it works to the great advantage of this film. Add the sensitivity and sweetness, subtlety, beauty, and talent of Anna Moffo and you have an unforgettable production. No one excelled Anna Moffo for sheer captivating femininity, beauty, and exquisite singing. To see and hear her is simply to fall madly in love with her. Seeing her outdoors, in this role, with the sun shining through the leaves on her and the breeze toying with her hair, watching her act and seem a real lovestruck woman, even to sitting on the ground on her bottom in a long, full blue dress with lace trim, one cannot help but be amazed at how genuine, natural, and compelling she is.The other members of the cast are quite good, although Edgardo does tend to be a bit of a nasal tenor at first, like too many Italian tenors. He does better as the opera goes on, however, and eventually becomes a sympathetic figure, though hardly worthy of Lucia.After watching this opera, I switched to Anna Moffo's DVD of ""La Traviata"" and was even more appreciative of that performance. Verdi is less rigid and more demanding than Donizetti. Ms. Moffo had more opportunity as Violetta to display her exceptional gifts as a singer. Once more, she is truly genuine in the role, excelling in expression, acting, and voice every other woman I have seen portray Violetta. She also comes across as young and spontaneous. Something about Anna Moffo permitted her to seem utterly natural, like she was actually the woman on whom the opera was based, not a singer and actress in a part.  Ms. Moffo seems to be truly in love, truly miserable, or whatever the role calls for, and therefore, utterly captivating.While the production values of this film are not outstanding by modern standards (at first, I almost expected someone from Monty Python to show up), many movies are still being shown that are no better. The color was a joy to see, the natural settings and the castle were terrific, and the costumes convincing. Best of all, the singing was almost entirely free of distortion and very good. This is a well-done film. I heartily recommend it to anyone who is tired of claustrophobic productions of people in gray overcoats with sets that are inexplicable. Writing this, I want to go back and watch it again.",5,A delicious production of Anna Moffo,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2661,"['movie', 'version', 'Lucia', 'di', 'Lammermoor', 'what', 'videos', 'can', 'become', 'right', 'hands', 'not', 'place', 'reviews', 'Anna', 'Bolena', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'settings', 'include', 'real', 'castle', 'real', 'outdoor', 'areas', 'only', 'emotional', 'impact', 'opera', 'would', 'normally', 'have', 'amazing', 'difference', 'movie', 'opera', 'house', 'production', 'great', 'advantage', 'film', 'Add', 'sensitivity', 'sweetness', 'subtlety', 'beauty', 'talent', 'Anna', 'Moffo', 'have', 'unforgettable', 'production', 'one', 'excelled', 'Anna', 'Moffo', 'sheer', 'captivating', 'femininity', 'beauty', 'exquisite', 'singing', 'see', 'hear', 'simply', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'Seeing', 'outdoors', 'role', 'sun', 'shining', 'leaves', 'breeze', 'toying', 'hair', 'watching', 'act', 'seem', 'real', 'lovestruck', 'woman', 'even', 'sitting', 'ground', 'bottom', 'long', 'full', 'blue', 'dress', 'lace', 'trim', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'genuine', 'natural', 'compelling', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Edgardo', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'nasal', 'tenor', 'first', 'too', 'many', 'Italian', 'tenors', 'better', 'opera', 'however', 'eventually', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'though', 'hardly', 'worthy', 'Lucia.After', 'watching', 'opera', 'switched', 'Anna', 'Moffo', 'DVD', 'La', 'Traviata', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'appreciative', 'performance', 'Verdi', 'less', 'rigid', 'more', 'demanding', 'Donizetti', 'Ms.', 'Moffo', 'had', 'more', 'opportunity', 'Violetta', 'display', 'exceptional', 'gifts', 'singer', 'Once', 'more', 'truly', 'genuine', 'role', 'excelling', 'expression', 'acting', 'voice', 'other', 'woman', 'have', 'seen', 'portray', 'Violetta', 'also', 'across', 'young', 'spontaneous', 'Something', 'Anna', 'Moffo', 'permitted', 'seem', 'utterly', 'natural', 'was', 'actually', 'woman', 'whom', 'opera', 'was', 'based', 'not', 'singer', 'actress', 'part', 'Ms.', 'Moffo', 'be', 'truly', 'love', 'truly', 'miserable', 'whatever', 'role', 'therefore', 'utterly', 'captivating.While', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'outstanding', 'modern', 'standards', 'first', 'almost', 'expected', 'someone', 'Monty', 'Python', 'show', 'up', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'shown', 'are', 'better', 'color', 'was', 'joy', 'see', 'natural', 'settings', 'castle', 'were', 'terrific', 'costumes', 'convincing', 'Best', 'singing', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'free', 'distortion', 'very', 'good', 'well-done', 'film', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'tired', 'claustrophobic', 'productions', 'people', 'gray', 'overcoats', 'sets', 'are', 'inexplicable', 'Writing', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Yes, there are many fine sopranos like Sutherland, Tebaldi, etc. However, Anna was the total package and what every little girl dreams that a soprano should be. She possessed an incredibly warm and lyrically beautiful voice. And that amazing phrasing and dramatic ability! Lastly, she was blessed with great physical beauty. I absolutely adore her. Anna was the perfect Lucia. This dvd is thank goodness, a wonderful memento for those of us too young to have witnessed her live performances. I completely disagree with the previous reviewer - the cast is excellent. Maybe they did not possess ""big"" names like Corelli, Merrill, etc., but the singing is very fine here. Everyone carries their own weight. Anna is simply gorgeous with those big brown eyes and the viewer can truly feel the anguish in her character.

It's very static and stagey (even by operatic standards), it's mostly badly mimed and badly acted. Where you'd expect mood lighting, there's constant full blaze, and where you'd expect people to react to the misery of Lucy, they just either turn away or burst into poorly coreographed swordfight. The direction is very, very poor. The picture and sound quality is mediocre, mostly because I believe it to have been shot on 16mm. But there was no sound or picture distortion as one viewer was complaining. It was just what I expected. Moffo is so very beautiful, but her lips barely move as she is supposedly singing and she simply hasn't much to do even though you can see that she is a sensitive actress. I also enjoyed the rest of the cast and was wondering that the blond tenor isn't better known nowadays. Not a bad film, but so much more could have been done with this marvellous singer, great locations and gorgeous music.

699659,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B000065B0B,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[21, 25]","Anna Moffo in Lucia. You can't get any better than that !! The 60's opera sensation Anna Moffo has a great following and her voice is perfect for the tragic heroine Lucia. Donizetti's opera about thwarted love, forbidden romance, madness and murder in bleak Scotland is his best and most acclaimed. Anna Moffo's beauty and voice, neither which had faded at the time of this film, 1971, is enchanting. On film, this is as great opera to watch. Starring as her lover Edgardo is Lajos Kozma, a little known European tenor. Anna Moffo was American-bred but she has Italian background. If I'm not mistaken she could speak Italian fluently and at one time also had her own show on Italian television. Many will flock to the DVD of Joan Sutherland's Met performance as Lucia, long regarded as the best. But eventhough I'm a Moffo fan, here's why I think Moffo is better as Lucia.Anna Moffo has the right look for Lucia. Her beauty provides her with a vulnerability and naivete that is appropriate for the romantic, lovesick and naive young heroine who is driven to madness. Joan Sutherland does not have any of these qualities and insteads she looks too old. This film is also very good visually. The haunting cinematography enhances the plot of the opera. The film was shot in authentic castles and moors. The fact that the movie looks dated and runs slow is not a problem. It adds to the allure of the old opera. Everything about this film is perfect. The look, the cast of singers and the orchestration.

Ultimately my evaluation has to be based on the versions I have seen (MET version with Desay, 1967 mono version with Scotto). Of the three this one is my favorite. First this is the first version where I feel whisked back into Walter Scott's time. The on-location filming truly adds to this opera though the cinematography is somewhat amateurish and a little fuzzy and washed out. Doe-eyed Anna Moffo is breathtakingly beautiful and her singing first rate (and with only 6 days preparation I might add). The supporting cast are all fine....this Donizetti masterpiece comes to life in this version. The orchestration is not as prominent as newer versions and the sub-titles superb. I did not see a problem with the dubbing since I am always reading the sub-titles. The audio quality was acceptable given when it was shot.
