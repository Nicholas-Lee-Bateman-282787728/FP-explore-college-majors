I like nothing in this movie. Question: What to like? The way that google company or nearly everyone else treating people like garbage? Shouldn't it be a comedy? What a weak attempt to make a funny movie using Google's name. But maybe that's just the way it is, considering people that created Google act like douches in reality. I had no expectations from the movie. Good thing I didn't get disappointed.This is why I WOULD have given it 1 star, BUTafter 1 hour of the movie, things got considerably better!

And successfully jumping into various and sundry beds as a result. Oh, no that was the Wedding Crashers not the film under review, The Internship. Well, wait a minute, maybe that synopsis is not so far off as this pair, Vince Vaughn (who co-wrote this one) and Owen Wilson (the pair playing modern day Mutt and Jeff, Abbott and Costello, etc. etc.) once again team up to give a funny pair of performances which kept the thinness and commonality of the plot-line from causing us all to go into a stupor.  These guys can apparently save anything with their antic hay humor.Okay, let&#8217;s try again. See there are two guys, two guys who can sell anything while selling themselves, who become unemployed by virtue of their company going under. What to do. Well why not go from just your average low- tech middle-aged joes to try out life in the land of high- tech. And the culture of high- tech chosen (and on display) is none other than at Google out in sunny California. Except you just don&#8217;t walk in and grab some job on your resume there (at least in this film) but must run the gauntlet by serving an internship filled with all kinds of funny tasks, including team-building, for the few available jobs. Well you know our two boys are nothing but low-tech guys so they would fail themselves and their motley of teammates if it was only techie stuff but they bring their version of shoulder-to-the-wheel-think-out-of-the-box in to save the day. And mercifully save this film with their flat-out slap-stick hi-jinx that made even this low-tech guy laugh a few times.

1661505,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DV1XYTO,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 7]","I don&#8217;t think anything really made me smile quite as much as the year 2005, when Vince Vaughn realized that he was a really great comedian and that he should just steer clear of dramatics if he wanted to reignite his, at that time, pretty dead career.  His rebirth as an actor and celebrity is rare.  Usually, once you&#8217;ve passed your so-called prime, there is no turning back.  After that it&#8217;s straight to DVD releases and guest spots on television shows no one watches until you hit your 70&#8217;s and then some young director takes pity on you, remembers you from their youth when you were interesting and decides to reboot your relevance by casting you as a salty grandpa in an Oscar contender and you wind up getting your 15 minutes of fame relatively close to your last 15 minutes on earth.Not so with Vince Vaughn.Sadly, since his resurgence, he&#8217;s played it VERY safe and wound up playing very slight variations of the very same character in each and every one of his films.  Sometimes this works well, other times it makes for very uninteresting cinema.  A lot of this has to do with the script and the actors he&#8217;s working with.No matter how entertaining Vince can be, dull is dull.But &#8216;The Internship&#8217; has another very big problem.Some films annoy, not for the sake of anything other than annoyance.  That is how I felt while watching &#8216;The Internship&#8217;, as if this film had no other purpose than to be annoying from every possible angle.  The characters are ridiculous stereotypes that serve no other purpose than to spout banter that feels forced and contrived and unintelligent despite supposedly being an intelligent form of witty banter.  There are certain characters that leave such an awkward stamp on every frame they&#8217;re in (I&#8217;m looking at you Lyle) that the entire film feels like an exercise in patience.The formula here is a tried and true one, and yet it is also one that nearly everyone has tried and botched and will try and botch again.  Billy and Nick are old dogs who need to learn new tricks in a world designed to cater to the young and gifted.  When they lose their jobs, their lives take a tumble and they wind up reaching for the stars when they apply for an internship at Google.  For some strange turn of events, they actually get the internship and from then on they defy odds and use their experience to teach their team of misfits all about strippers and booze and irresponsibility and overconfidence and BSing their way to the top, and they do, obviously.Oh, and there is the overconfident British punk who berates them every step of the way.The formula just doesn&#8217;t work here.  Shawn Levy, the guy behind tighter offerings like &#8216;Date Night&#8217; and &#8216;Cheaper by the Dozen&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t know how to make this movie work.  His script is a messy collage of &#8216;Juno&#8217; inspired banter that comes off as cheap and grating, and his cast of characters feel like overblown Saturday Night Live sketches.  Owen Wilson is looking more and more like a late in life lesbian and Vince Vaughn regurgitated shtick sticks out sorely in this film (he&#8217;s also far too old to continually get cast alongside young, hot girls who would NEVER date a man like him unless he were a celebrity).  The horrible strip club scene is ten minutes too long (seriously, edit this movie) and the finale feels so contrived I wanted to throw someone at my own head for thinking that the names &#8216;Vaughn and Wilson&#8217; would guarantee a laugh or two.The only laughs this movie got were those of the uncomfortable kind.",1,What was I thinking?,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,3629,"['don', '8217', 'think', 'anything', 'really', 'made', 'smile', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'year', '2005', 'when', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'realized', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'comedian', 'should', 'just', 'steer', 'clear', 'dramatics', 'wanted', 'reignite', 'time', 'pretty', 'dead', 'career', 'rebirth', 'actor', 'celebrity', 'rare', 'Usually', 'once', '8217', 've', 'passed', 'so-called', 'prime', 'turning', 'back', '8217', 'straight', 'DVD', 'releases', 'guest', 'spots', 'television', 'one', 'hit', '70', '8217', 's', 'then', 'young', 'director', 'pity', 'remembers', 'youth', 'when', 'were', 'interesting', 'decides', 'reboot', 'relevance', 'casting', 'salty', 'grandpa', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'wind', 'up', 'getting', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'relatively', 'close', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'earth.Not', 'so', 'Vince', 'Vaughn.Sadly', 'resurgence', '8217', 'played', 'VERY', 'safe', 'wound', 'up', 'playing', 'very', 'slight', 'variations', 'very', 'same', 'character', 'one', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'well', 'other', 'times', 'very', 'uninteresting', 'cinema', 'lot', 'do', 'script', 'actors', '8217', 'working', 'with.No', 'matter', 'how', 'entertaining', 'Vince', 'can', 'be', 'dull', 'dull.But', '8216', 'Internship', '8217', 'very', 'big', 'problem.Some', 'films', 'annoy', 'not', 'sake', 'anything', 'other', 'annoyance', 'how', 'felt', 'watching', '8216', 'Internship', '8217', 'film', 'had', 'other', 'purpose', 'be', 'annoying', 'possible', 'angle', 'characters', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'stereotypes', 'serve', 'other', 'purpose', 'spout', 'banter', 'forced', 'contrived', 'unintelligent', 'supposedly', 'being', 'intelligent', 'form', 'witty', 'banter', 'are', 'certain', 'characters', 'leave', 'awkward', 'stamp', 'frame', '8217', 're', '8217', 'looking', 'Lyle', 'entire', 'film', 'feels', 'exercise', 'patience.The', 'formula', 'here', 'tried', 'true', 'one', 'yet', 'also', 'one', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'tried', 'botched', 'will', 'try', 'botch', 'again', 'Billy', 'Nick', 'are', 'old', 'dogs', 'who', 'need', 'learn', 'new', 'tricks', 'world', 'designed', 'cater', 'young', 'gifted', 'When', 'lose', 'jobs', 'lives', 'take', 'tumble', 'wind', 'up', 'reaching', 'stars', 'when', 'apply', 'internship', 'Google', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'actually', 'get', 'internship', 'then', 'defy', 'odds', 'use', 'experience', 'teach', 'team', 'misfits', 'strippers', 'booze', 'irresponsibility', 'overconfidence', 'BSing', 'way', 'top', 'do', 'obviously.Oh', 'overconfident', 'British', 'punk', 'who', 'step', 'way.The', 'formula', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'work', 'here', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'guy', 'tighter', 'offerings', '8216', 'Date', 'Night', '8217', '8216', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '8217', 'doesn', '8217', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'script', 'messy', 'collage', '8216', 'Juno', '8217', 'inspired', 'banter', 'off', 'cheap', 'grating', 'cast', 'characters', 'feel', 'overblown', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketches', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'looking', 'more', 'more', 'late', 'life', 'lesbian', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'regurgitated', 'shtick', 'sticks', 'out', 'sorely', 'film', '8217', 's', 'also', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'continually', 'get', 'cast', 'alongside', 'young', 'hot', 'girls', 'who', 'would', 'NEVER', 'date', 'man', 'were', 'celebrity', 'horrible', 'strip', 'club', 'scene', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'seriously', 'edit', 'movie', 'finale', 'feels', 'so', 'contrived', 'wanted', 'throw', 'someone', 'own', 'head', 'thinking', 'names', '8216', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', '8217', 'would', 'guarantee', 'laugh', 'two.The', 'only', 'movie', 'got', 'were', 'uncomfortable', 'kind']",The Internship

1661563,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00DV1XYTO,Darren,"[0, 0]","Okay, first thing:  I'm seeing a lot of comments about this being a 2-hour Google commercial.  This criticism might have more punch if every major studio release (and some not-so-major releases) did NOT employ almost unceasing product placement.  For at least 30 years, movies have been primarily designed to hustle product.  The actual movie, as a product itself, is merely a delivery system for advertising.  Hey, if the movie itself makes money, that's just gravy, or, rather, a nice bonus for the production head.  Let's stop kidding ourselves, now shall we?  How do you think the studios make money on a picture before home release?  It ain't through box-office receipts, babe.  Therefore, the whole ""it's a commercial"" thing is not a valid criticism -- sorry.  If it was, every major release would deserve a 1-star rating.Next:  I'm trying to find reasons why ""The Internship"" is so inferior in comparison to, say, ""Wedding Crashers"".  The only plausible reason I can find is that Vaughn and Wilson are older -- in their 40s -- and that the new generation that has come of age in the last decade just finds these two to be creepy old guys.  Being a creepy old guy myself, I think I finally find them interesting, despite the basically formulaic comedy they're in here.  They're sales partners who get the rug pulled out from under them when their company goes unexpectedly out of business.  Vaughn comes up with the idea of having both of them intern for Google.  The movie then follows the time-honored path of generation-gap conflicts, as the aging boys discover that they're literally twice the age of all the other Google interns.  Disadvantage:  being behind the times (cf. ""Flashdance"" references).  Advantage:  they're experienced enough to help a group of callow young misfits come together as a team.  Unlike in ""Wedding Crashers"", which is generally revered as a classic comedy, I find Wilson and Vaughn to be performing believable human beings in ""The Internship"".  Two guys in their 40s looking to start over? -- I can believe that.  Two guys in their 30s who crash wedding receptions?  Not so much.  The usual Wilson-Vaughn bromance exchanges are still there, but the crudity has been eschewed, and Real Stuff seems to be at stake this time:  a career and a sense of self-worth.  They're also mature enough to patiently accept their role as mentors to the kids.  ""There's a whole world right in front of your nose,"" Wilson tells one of the young geeks, who, while texting on his phone, doesn't realize that an exotic dancer is standing right in front of him.Not a masterpiece, by any stretch.  But ""The Internship"" is a solid comedy, particularly in the first hour, and it has relevance for a generation of aging Gen-Xers, some of whom lost everything in the Great Recession.  It also speaks to the problems of the Millennials who are coming into a world where the Old Guarantees, i.e., the American Dream, are not even an option to be considered unless you're exceptional or extraordinarily lucky.  The comedy ends gently, but the problems it addresses are not.  4 out of 5 stars -- give this one a chance.",4,Another tale from the Great Recession,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,3126,"['Okay', 'first', 'thing', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'lot', 'comments', 'being', '2-hour', 'Google', 'commercial', 'criticism', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'punch', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'not-so-major', 'releases', 'did', 'NOT', 'employ', 'almost', 'unceasing', 'product', 'placement', 'least', '30', 'years', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'primarily', 'designed', 'hustle', 'product', 'actual', 'movie', 'product', 'merely', 'delivery', 'system', 'advertising', 'Hey', 'movie', 'money', 'just', 'gravy', 'rather', 'nice', 'bonus', 'production', 'head', 'Let', 'stop', 'kidding', 'now', 'shall', 'How', 'do', 'think', 'studios', 'make', 'money', 'picture', 'home', 'release', 'ai', ""n't"", 'box-office', 'receipts', 'babe', 'Therefore', 'whole', 'commercial', 'thing', 'not', 'valid', 'criticism', 'sorry', 'was', 'major', 'release', 'would', 'deserve', '1-star', 'rating.Next', ""'m"", 'trying', 'find', 'reasons', 'why', 'Internship', 'so', 'inferior', 'comparison', 'say', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'only', 'plausible', 'reason', 'can', 'find', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'are', 'older', '40s', 'new', 'generation', 'come', 'age', 'last', 'decade', 'just', 'two', 'be', 'creepy', 'old', 'guys', 'Being', 'creepy', 'old', 'guy', 'think', 'finally', 'find', 'interesting', 'basically', 'formulaic', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'here', ""'re"", 'sales', 'partners', 'who', 'get', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'when', 'company', 'unexpectedly', 'business', 'Vaughn', 'up', 'idea', 'having', 'intern', 'Google', 'movie', 'then', 'time-honored', 'path', 'generation-gap', 'conflicts', 'aging', 'boys', 'discover', ""'re"", 'literally', 'twice', 'age', 'other', 'Google', 'interns', 'Disadvantage', 'being', 'times', 'cf', 'Flashdance', 'references', 'Advantage', ""'re"", 'experienced', 'enough', 'help', 'group', 'callow', 'young', 'misfits', 'come', 'together', 'team', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'generally', 'revered', 'classic', 'comedy', 'find', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'be', 'performing', 'believable', 'human', 'beings', 'Internship', 'Two', 'guys', '40s', 'looking', 'start', 'over', 'can', 'believe', 'Two', 'guys', '30s', 'who', 'crash', 'wedding', 'receptions', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'usual', 'Wilson-Vaughn', 'bromance', 'exchanges', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'crudity', 'been', 'eschewed', 'Real', 'Stuff', 'be', 'stake', 'time', 'career', 'sense', 'self-worth', ""'re"", 'also', 'mature', 'enough', 'patiently', 'accept', 'role', 'mentors', 'kids', 'whole', 'world', 'right', 'front', 'nose', 'Wilson', 'one', 'young', 'geeks', 'who', 'texting', 'phone', ""n't"", 'realize', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'standing', 'right', 'front', 'him.Not', 'masterpiece', 'stretch', 'Internship', 'solid', 'comedy', 'particularly', 'first', 'hour', 'relevance', 'generation', 'aging', 'Gen-Xers', 'whom', 'lost', 'everything', 'Great', 'Recession', 'also', 'problems', 'Millennials', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'world', 'where', 'Old', 'Guarantees', 'i.e.', 'American', 'Dream', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'option', 'be', 'considered', ""'re"", 'exceptional', 'extraordinarily', 'lucky', 'comedy', 'gently', 'problems', 'are', 'not', '4', '5', 'stars', 'give', 'one', 'chance']",The Internship

The comedy chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson made that movie, and I was not disappointed to see it still there in this movie. Oh, sure, there's not a lot of surprises here; two middle-aged, likeable, out-of-work guys desperate for jobs land internships amongst the twenty-somethings at Google and comedy is supposed to ensue, and it does, for the most part. The tech-savvy twenty-somethings look down their noses at the over-the-hill dinosaurs; those dinosaurs teach the twenty-somethings how to tear themselves away from their electronics and reconnect with life, and people. Some of the gags are a little tired, and a little trite, but the movie does a good job of avoiding becoming too corny. For me, the obligatory ""bad guy"" is fairly one-dimensional and disposable, and the ""love interest"" isn't all that well developed as a character, but overall the movie hits all the right notes for a buddy comedy in a pleasant way, and it moves along at an entertaining pace that makes its almost two hour running time seem short. Perhaps the most interesting side benefit of the movie is the peek you get at the world of Google. I'd read that Google was happy to assume the role of a character in the movie, and that much of the film was actually shot on Google's campus in California. That little side trip behind the scenes at Google was an added benefit to a movie that was entertaining, funny and enjoyable. For me, this movie was well worth the time, and the rental fee. Would I pay to own it? I'm not sure that I'd pay bust-out retail for it, but once it comes down below the $10 mark, it would be worth it to include in my movie library.",4,Vince and Owen's Pretty Good Adventure,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,1768,"['preface', 'should', 'say', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'why', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'comedy', 'chemistry', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'see', 'still', 'there', 'movie', 'Oh', 'sure', 'not', 'lot', 'surprises', 'here', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'likeable', 'out-of-work', 'guys', 'desperate', 'jobs', 'land', 'internships', 'amongst', 'twenty-somethings', 'Google', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'ensue', 'most', 'part', 'tech-savvy', 'twenty-somethings', 'look', 'down', 'noses', 'over-the-hill', 'dinosaurs', 'dinosaurs', 'teach', 'twenty-somethings', 'how', 'tear', 'away', 'electronics', 'reconnect', 'life', 'people', 'gags', 'are', 'little', 'tired', 'little', 'trite', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'avoiding', 'becoming', 'too', 'corny', 'obligatory', 'bad', 'guy', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'disposable', 'love', 'interest', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'movie', 'right', 'notes', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'pleasant', 'way', 'along', 'entertaining', 'pace', 'almost', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'seem', 'short', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'side', 'benefit', 'movie', 'peek', 'get', 'world', 'Google', ""'d"", 'read', 'Google', 'was', 'happy', 'assume', 'role', 'character', 'movie', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Google', 'campus', 'California', 'little', 'side', 'trip', 'scenes', 'Google', 'was', 'added', 'benefit', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'time', 'rental', 'fee', 'Would', 'pay', 'own', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'pay', 'bust-out', 'retail', 'down', '10', 'mark', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'include', 'movie', 'library']",The Internship

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[2, 5]","""The Internship"" opens with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who play traveling salesmen, singing along to the chorus of Alanis Morissette's ""Ironic.""  This is appropriate because they are shortly about to be informed that their company has folded and they no longer have jobs - by one of their clients, just as they are expecting to close a sale. The client further compounds the indignity by telling them that watches are obsolete - everyone just checks their smart phone nowadays.  If you can imagine.Wilson gets a job with his brother-in-law's mattress store (Will Ferrell in a deadpan cameo), but when Vaughn announces he's found them an internship with Google, he quits and they head over to the software giant, whose campus resembles a blockbuster movie set crossed with a college, that is if the college had nap pods and unlimited free refreshments.  At Google, ""twenty is the new 12,"" and the duo is surrounded by whiz kids whose tech savvy far outstrips theirs, but who are weak on such things as, you know, teamwork and optimism.  Predictably, at first things don't go well, as they learn that the correct answer to ""Is it okay to take food home from the office?"" is not ""Is it perishable - like pizza or a pudding?"" (There is a difference between thinking outside the box and just being a smart aleck.) Predictably they also make enemies, including Max Minghella as a budding yuppie-ish intern, who may or may not have a fake accent, as well as the resentment of their team, who just want to get a job after college.  Like Reese Witherspoon's character in ""Legally Blonde,"" the two eventually realize they need to buckle down and start boning up on their book knowledge to keep up with their more serious peers.  However, they also have valuable life lessons to teach the younger crew (most gleaned from ""Flashdance,"").  Can this ragtag team of misfits come together and triumph?I've read other reviews by critics who savaged this movie calling it lazy and completely unfunny.

A gang of misfits try to beat the odds in order to apprehend fortune and glory in the end. If you've seen most of Adam Sandler's movies, then you'll know what happens at the end. Basically, The Internship is an unoriginal comedy with numerous cliches that you would expect from this type of comedy. You have the annoying antagonist who does nothing but look down on the protagonists. You have the group of awkward misfits who don't even know how to socialize with a caterpillar. You have the positive message that you should never give up on your hopes and dreams (which isn't a bad thing, by the way). And then, you have the useless romantic subplot that doesn't add any real significant element in the plot.In a nutshell, The Internship is bland and predictable fare.

I wish  I could see Vince Vaughn in something other than these little run of the mill comedies, since this movie fits somewhere in the middle of Wedding Crashers and Delivery Man (which is actually really good). I guess he is still trying out roles and sticking in the safe zone. It is a good movie and I enjoyed very much.

1661592,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DV1XYTO,FNDNreview,"[3, 5]","Google is a name synonymous with the internet and global information.  Currently, Google is the world's most popular search engine, receiving more than 2 billion views per day and handling 100 billion searches per month.  Officially founded in 1998 (created in 1996), Google received a modest 10,000 searches per day - and the rest is history.  In 2005, while Google was finding its stride, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson teamed up for the modern comedy classic, Wedding Crashers.  Even today, Wedding Crashers is credited with reviving the adult comedy genre, mixing crude humor with a glorified chick flick.  Flash forward to the present day, and who would have guessed Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and Google would be on a collision course?  But, does this comedy duo have what it takes to make a successful movie that appears to be nothing more than a lengthy commercial for one of the wealthiest companies in the world?Directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Real Steel, & The Watch), The Internship stars Vince Vaughn as Billy McMahon and Owen Wilson as Nick Campbell, two salesmen that find themselves out of a job when their employer goes out of business.  Billy and Nick decide to apply for an internship at Google, the world's largest online internet search engine.  The large group of interns is divided into groups and each group must prove they are the best team, via a series of competitions - with the winning group earning full-time jobs with Google.  Rose Byrne, Max Minghella, Joanna Garcia, and John Goodman star in supporting roles.Since Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are teaming up once again, it only makes sense to compare their new film together to their highly praised comedy, Wedding Crashers.  First off, yes there is a clear similarity between the plot of Wedding Crashers and The Internship.  Both films revolve around Vaughn and Wilson's characters evolving and stepping into the world of the unknown.  Wedding Crashers focuses more on the two main characters and their relationships, while in similar fashion, The Internship mainly focuses on these two individuals and their quest to make a future for themselves, even though they lack the modern skills of technology.  Unlike Wedding Crashers, The Internship is less focused on the deceit of these characters, centering on the general themes of friendship, teamwork, and individual drive.  Comedy factors aside, there is a great deal to appreciate about this film and the story it tells.  In the beginning of the film, the job loss issues in the United States create momentary sobering issues for the characters' during their unemployment and job uncertainty period.  However, their issue is quickly remedied when they decide to apply to Google (if only the real world worked that easily).The Internship is not as funny as Wedding Crashers, but that doesn't mean The Internship doesn't have its moments of laughter.  Wedding Crashers focuses more on the sexually driven crude humor, while The Internship is much more light-hearted, often poking fun at nerd stereotypes - like their love for Star Wars, comic books, and the ability to write source code.  Currently in their 40s, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are certainly breaking the age barrier with this film, being surrounded by 18-21 year old computer techs all looking to make a name for themselves in the highly-coveted internet company, Google.  True enough, the plot is silly, filled with endless Google references (that really aren't as bothersome as one might think) - but if you take a film like this as anything other than a huge gag on the real world, you're missing the point.  That's not to say this film makes fun of Google, but it certainly makes a decent amount of humor out of the unlikelihood of acquiring a position in such a competitive environment.As a whole, The Internship is monumentally cheesy, completely unbelievable, and full of outlandish scenarios.  It is most certainly a throwback film, feeling like a trip back to the turn of the century when Alanis Morissette was still popular.  However, the film quickly takes the trip back to the present day, shooting on sight at the modernized Googleplex (Google's corporate headquarters) in Mountain View, California.  Despite its shortcomings (the occasional tedious dialogue and uninteresting romance subplot), The Internship is a heartwarming film that most will be able to embrace and enjoy.  The film shines bright with its thrifty humor and quirky, outlandish characters - including a hilarious cameo from Will Ferrell.Overall Grade:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Vaughn & Wilson model employees in 'The Internship',1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,4564,"['Google', 'name', 'synonymous', 'internet', 'global', 'information', 'Currently', 'Google', 'world', 'most', 'popular', 'search', 'engine', 'receiving', 'more', '2', 'billion', 'views', 'day', 'handling', '100', 'billion', 'searches', 'month', 'Officially', 'founded', '1998', 'created', '1996', 'Google', 'received', 'modest', '10,000', 'searches', 'day', 'rest', 'history', '2005', 'Google', 'was', 'finding', 'stride', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'teamed', 'up', 'modern', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Even', 'today', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'credited', 'reviving', 'adult', 'comedy', 'genre', 'mixing', 'crude', 'humor', 'glorified', 'chick', 'flick', 'Flash', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Google', 'would', 'be', 'collision', 'course', 'comedy', 'duo', 'have', 'what', 'make', 'successful', 'movie', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'lengthy', 'commercial', 'one', 'wealthiest', 'companies', 'world', 'Directed', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Real', 'Steel', 'Watch', 'Internship', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Billy', 'McMahon', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Nick', 'Campbell', 'two', 'salesmen', 'find', 'job', 'when', 'employer', 'business', 'Billy', 'Nick', 'decide', 'apply', 'internship', 'Google', 'world', 'largest', 'online', 'internet', 'search', 'engine', 'large', 'group', 'interns', 'divided', 'groups', 'group', 'must', 'prove', 'are', 'best', 'team', 'series', 'competitions', 'winning', 'group', 'earning', 'full-time', 'jobs', 'Google', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'John', 'Goodman', 'star', 'supporting', 'roles.Since', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'are', 'teaming', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'sense', 'compare', 'new', 'film', 'together', 'highly', 'praised', 'comedy', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'First', 'yes', 'clear', 'similarity', 'plot', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Internship', 'films', 'revolve', 'Vaughn', 'Wilson', 'characters', 'evolving', 'stepping', 'world', 'unknown', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'more', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'relationships', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Internship', 'mainly', 'two', 'individuals', 'quest', 'make', 'future', 'even', 'lack', 'modern', 'skills', 'technology', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Internship', 'less', 'focused', 'deceit', 'characters', 'centering', 'general', 'themes', 'friendship', 'teamwork', 'individual', 'drive', 'Comedy', 'factors', 'aside', 'great', 'deal', 'appreciate', 'film', 'story', 'beginning', 'film', 'job', 'loss', 'issues', 'United', 'States', 'create', 'momentary', 'sobering', 'issues', 'characters', 'unemployment', 'job', 'uncertainty', 'period', 'However', 'issue', 'quickly', 'remedied', 'when', 'decide', 'apply', 'Google', 'only', 'real', 'world', 'worked', 'easily', '.The', 'Internship', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Internship', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'laughter', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'more', 'sexually', 'driven', 'crude', 'humor', 'Internship', 'much', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'often', 'poking', 'fun', 'nerd', 'stereotypes', 'love', 'Star', 'Wars', 'comic', 'books', 'ability', 'write', 'source', 'code', 'Currently', '40s', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'are', 'certainly', 'breaking', 'age', 'barrier', 'film', 'being', 'surrounded', '18-21', 'year', 'old', 'computer', 'techs', 'looking', 'make', 'name', 'highly-coveted', 'internet', 'company', 'Google', 'True', 'enough', 'plot', 'silly', 'filled', 'endless', 'Google', 'references', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bothersome', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'take', 'film', 'anything', 'other', 'huge', 'gag', 'real', 'world', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'fun', 'Google', 'certainly', 'decent', 'amount', 'humor', 'unlikelihood', 'acquiring', 'position', 'such', 'competitive', 'environment.As', 'whole', 'Internship', 'monumentally', 'cheesy', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'full', 'outlandish', 'scenarios', 'most', 'certainly', 'throwback', 'film', 'feeling', 'trip', 'back', 'turn', 'century', 'when', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'was', 'still', 'popular', 'However', 'film', 'quickly', 'trip', 'back', 'present', 'day', 'shooting', 'sight', 'modernized', 'Googleplex', 'Google', 'corporate', 'headquarters', 'Mountain', 'View', 'California', 'shortcomings', 'occasional', 'tedious', 'dialogue', 'uninteresting', 'romance', 'subplot', 'Internship', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'embrace', 'enjoy', 'film', 'shines', 'bright', 'thrifty', 'humor', 'quirky', 'outlandish', 'characters', 'including', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Will', 'Ferrell.Overall', 'Grade', 'B-FNDNreview.com']",The Internship

1661620,AIO247KHD2O40,B00DV1XYTO,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Unfortunately you should really wait for The Internship to appear on TV rather than waste any money to see it.  I wasn't expecting it to be brilliant and since Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn always play the same characters in every single film they are in, I wasn't expecting that aspect to change.  But I did expect it to be a bit funnier, I thought there would be a bit more of the fish out water, generation conflict, technophobes vs those who grew up with a passion for it.  Alas, pretty much all the scenes which were even slightly funny were shown in this film's previews.  Why did a film where we know the guys are going to be working at Google on an Internship take just under half an hour for them to walk onto the organisation's campus?  The first half hour was pretty boring stuff and added nothing to the film and really should have been edited down to a few minutes.  The movie goes for about two hours with the slow start included.Once at Google it become a formulatic piece of younger, smarter interns seeing the two high school finished at most, and that was decades ago, interns as a joke.  Teams competing for a guaranteed job (doesn't seem the smartest way to hire people), with the left over interns overlooked by everyone else left to team up with the two &#34;old guys&#34; and of course not being thrilled with the situation.  Throw in your stereotypes of an Asian young guy with a strict upbringing and demanding mother, an Indian girl who doesn't see herself as much of a catch for the opposite sex, and the jerk who isn't afraid to point out he doesn't want them on his team.  Then you've the &#34;bad guy&#34; lead team where an up himself rich kid constantly puts down his team mates and of course the two old guys in the opposition. I never understood why his team mates joined his team in the first place, especially the girl &#34;you're in as your hot&#34;.  This movie's plot was pretty much a remake of the plot of the cartoon film, Monsters University, which itself had been done a million times before.Parts of the plot there for the gag such as the red and green paddles didn't flow into the rest of the movie as we've got Wilson's character trying to getting a date with one of the teacher type Google employees as a subplot after one of the paddle questions forbid that as part of company policy.  Yet he is never even given a warning about it, when numerous Google employees observe this.  I found the boys' supposedly being top salesmen in their former career, then when given the opportunity to shine with those skills was just a big letdown.  Can't really go into that more without giving away spoilers.  I have to say I never really at any time ever bought the plausibility of them actually getting an internship at Google, but thought if somehow this had happened for these characters, they'd bring a lot more fish out of water laughs, then they delivered.Borrow it from your library or wait for it to be on TV but I wouldn't part with any money to watch it, it's simply a watchable once, but average film.",2,"Watchable Once, But Wait for it to be on TV",1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,3048,"['Unfortunately', 'should', 'really', 'wait', 'Internship', 'appear', 'TV', 'rather', 'waste', 'money', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'brilliant', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'always', 'play', 'same', 'characters', 'single', 'film', 'are', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'aspect', 'change', 'did', 'expect', 'be', 'bit', 'funnier', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'fish', 'water', 'generation', 'conflict', 'technophobes', 'vs', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'passion', 'Alas', 'pretty', 'much', 'scenes', 'were', 'even', 'slightly', 'funny', 'were', 'shown', 'film', 'previews', 'Why', 'did', 'film', 'where', 'know', 'guys', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'working', 'Google', 'Internship', 'take', 'just', 'hour', 'walk', 'organisation', 'campus', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'pretty', 'boring', 'stuff', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'about', 'two', 'hours', 'slow', 'start', 'included.Once', 'Google', 'become', 'formulatic', 'piece', 'younger', 'smarter', 'interns', 'seeing', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'finished', 'most', 'was', 'decades', 'ago', 'interns', 'joke', 'Teams', 'competing', 'guaranteed', 'job', ""n't"", 'seem', 'smartest', 'way', 'hire', 'people', 'left', 'interns', 'overlooked', 'everyone', 'else', 'left', 'team', 'up', 'two', '34', 'old', 'guys', '34', 'course', 'not', 'being', 'thrilled', 'situation', 'Throw', 'stereotypes', 'Asian', 'young', 'guy', 'strict', 'upbringing', 'demanding', 'mother', 'Indian', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'catch', 'opposite', 'sex', 'jerk', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'point', 'out', ""n't"", 'want', 'team', 'Then', ""'ve"", '34', 'bad', 'guy', '34', 'lead', 'team', 'where', 'up', 'rich', 'kid', 'constantly', 'down', 'team', 'mates', 'course', 'two', 'old', 'guys', 'opposition', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'team', 'mates', 'joined', 'team', 'first', 'place', 'especially', 'girl', '34', ""'re"", 'hot', '34', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'remake', 'plot', 'cartoon', 'film', 'Monsters', 'University', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'before.Parts', 'plot', 'there', 'gag', 'such', 'red', 'green', 'paddles', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'rest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Wilson', 'character', 'trying', 'getting', 'date', 'one', 'teacher', 'type', 'Google', 'employees', 'subplot', 'one', 'paddle', 'questions', 'forbid', 'part', 'company', 'policy', 'never', 'even', 'given', 'warning', 'when', 'numerous', 'Google', 'employees', 'observe', 'found', 'boys', 'supposedly', 'being', 'top', 'salesmen', 'former', 'career', 'then', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'skills', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'letdown', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'have', 'say', 'never', 'really', 'time', 'ever', 'bought', 'plausibility', 'actually', 'getting', 'internship', 'Google', 'thought', 'somehow', 'had', 'happened', 'characters', ""'d"", 'bring', 'lot', 'more', 'fish', 'water', 'laughs', 'then', 'delivered.Borrow', 'library', 'wait', 'be', 'TV', 'would', ""n't"", 'part', 'money', 'watch', 'simply', 'watchable', 'once', 'average', 'film']",The Internship

1661649,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00DV1XYTO,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Back in 2005, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson starred in the summer hit, Wedding Crashers. In addition to being a commercial success, the film also received some generally positive reviews, most of which praised Vaughn and Wilson's on-screen chemistry. It's no secret that both have seen their fair share of roles since then, but I always found it strange that the industry failed to capitalize on the potential of these two men. Fast-forward eight years later and that second film finally materialized in the form of The Internship, a simple comedy that focuses on the relationship of best friends Billy McMahon (Vaughn) and Nick Campbell (Wilson). I was interested in seeing how the film would avoid feeling gimmicky, but this is perhaps the only aspect of The Internship I shouldn't have been worried about.After finding out their company has been shut down, salesmen Billy and Nick find themselves in need of employment. Both have very few skills outside of sales, and neither is a college graduate, so they wind up in a bit of a conundrum. To make matters worse, Billy's house is being foreclosed, and his girlfriend, Megan (Joanna Garc&iacute;a), just left him. Sick of living life check-to-check, and appalled by the idea of working at some random job he'll hate, Billy decides to sign the both of them up for an internship at Google. After convincing Nick to join him, the two friends take part in the internship program in Santa Clara County, California. Along the way, they make some unexpected friends, and the audience gets to see both men grow spiritually even though they're surrounded by a bunch of 20 year-olds.If there's one thing The Internship does extremely well, it would be providing consistent laughs for the entirety of its two hour running time. Vaughn and Wilson slipped into these roles as if they were an old pair of shoes, and their chemistry is once again felt throughout the entire film. In fact, it didn't take long before the first laugh escape from my mouth. As Billy and Nick come into frame for the first time, the viewer can hear ""Ironic"" by Alanis Morissette playing on the car stereo. This prompts Nick to ask, ""What the s*** is this? Why is this on the Get Psyched mix?"" A fair question, and a great opening line for a movie; however, it is the way this scene plays out that really brings in the laughter, and its execution is nothing short of hysterical.As the story progresses, and Billy and Nick begin adjusting to Google and the life of a Noogler--a term used to describe the interns--the stronger material comes into play once it starts to involve their personal team of outcasts. There's the team manager, Lyle (Josh Brenner); the edgy-kid, Stuart (Dylan O'Brien); the smart, yet insecure female, Neha (Tiya Sircar); and the odd, yet highly intelligent Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael). Six very different people who probably wouldn't be together in any other situation, but these three young interns soon learn that Billy and Nick have a lot to offer even with their obvious lack of technological experience. One of my favorite bits comes from an interaction between Billy and Lyle. As Billy continuously mispronounces it, ""On-the-line,"" Lyle irritably, and continuously, corrects him with a soft, ""Online.""However, the comedy wasn't always spot-on, and I found that the writers tried too hard to include too many different forms of comedy, even though all of them clearly didn't work together. One of the best examples would be from the first challenge of the internship. Every team was given the task of debugging a program, and the first team to find the error won the challenge. This is where Billy and Nick truly displayed their ignorance and, in my opinion, nothing about this segment was particularly funny. In fact, it kind of bordered on annoying, and I honestly wanted it to be over as soon as possible. As Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha tried their hardest to figure it out, Billy and Nick were spouting nonsense on the sidelines, and it was tough to watch. It segued into funny bit involving ""Professor Xavier,"" but the journey to get to that point was rough.Where the film really falls flat, though, is its inherent ability to display every buddy-comedy cliche in the book. There's the group of friends who have hit rock bottom with nowhere to go, there's the awkward group of people who learn to love each other, there's that one person who makes their life hell, and there's the leader who secretly believed in them the entire time. I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Cliches can be okay if they are done tastefully, and if they aren't used as a way to structure a film's plot, but neither statement is applicable to The Internship. It doesn't just include these cliches; it embraces them. It puts them on the front line and says, ""Hey! Look at this unoriginal plot progression!""Taking all of that into consideration, it's surprising just how much I found myself enjoying every bit of this movie. It has its flaws, sure, but they never became unbearable. The film seems to coast on the fact that Vaughn, Wilson, and the rest of the supporting cast have such amazing chemistry, which makes it extremely difficult not to have a good time. There are no groundbreaking performances, there are no extraordinary story elements, and a few of the recurring jokes could have been toned down a little, but the movie sets out to be fun, and it excels in this regard. Plus, the audience gets to see some very small performances from Will Ferrell, Rob Riggle, and Aasif Mandvi, and these men steal the spotlight whenever they appeared on screen.Overall Score: 7.6/10 - The Internship is far from perfect, and its story could have used a little more originality, but it's fun. At the end of the day it's an entertaining comedy that provides a lot of laughs, and its two leads are a joy to watch together. They both gave their usual performances, so neither broke any ground here, but it worked for the story being told. As a whole, it's definitely not something that's going to connect with everyone due to its cliched nature, but it's at least worth the rental if you're on the fence.",4,"7.6/10 - Funny, sweet, and

The plot is unabashedly paint-by-numbers, with not a single cliched element unaccounted for. There is a contest between a group of underdogs and a mouthy, despicable team of cocky jerks. There is a stilted love story between a job-obsessed lady and a guy who shows her how to finally let her hair down. A fighting montage where a woman's honor has been besmirched by big-shouldered jerks. A sports montage involved Quidditch for no reason at all. There is a subplot about overcoming self-doubt in the face of overwhelming odds. A twiggy, hopeless nerd gets the girl (in defiance of all logic). The smug hipster dude learns how to soften his cool exterior. Let's not forget tons of jokes about how these forty-something fellas apparently know nothing about popular culture and computers (including, but not limited to, the X-Men, the difference between the phrases ""on the line"" and ""on-line,"" and what Instagram is).The movie is tired, and a lot of the jokes are forced. It's nearly impossible to believe that our leads are as stupid as they are sometimes presented (they don't know how a webcam works? really?), but also smart enough to pick up competitive Google programming knowledge in the course of a week or two. They clash with the youngsters in their team, but serious bonding finally happens during a drunken, irresponsible night at a strip club, a scene that seemed to have been thrown together at the last minute. Rarely, if ever, does anything happen that isn't expected by any audience member who's seen this movie before, whether it was called Animal House or Old School or Heavyweights.Of course, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are incredibly charming guys, and since they're basically playing themselves, they lighten the predictability with the sole force of their personalities.

1661687,A20ULCEMNXPWLM,B00DV1XYTO,mel,"[2, 8]","I was initially excited to see this movie. The commercials implied it to be a funny movie, similar to Wedding Crashers. However, it was not. Everything that was worth seeing in the movie was shown in the commercial. Truthfully, this film was terrible. It was not funny, witty, or entertaining. Rather, it was depressing at times. The lack of respect and tolerance from nearly everyone was saddening. I'm not even old, I'm in my late 30's and I found it unappealing. Throughout the course of the entire movie, I only chuckled one time and that never happens. Frankly, I have no problem with films that contain juvenile comedy, or silly banter, but this was over the top. It was extremely juvenile at times, and quite boring. Rather than being entertained, I felt sorry for the lead characters amid their experiences. None of the supporting characters were likable. In fact, many of them were creepy, weird, or jerks. Another thing I disliked, was the fact that it was basically an advertisement or corporate promotional video for Google. EVERYTHING was about Google and it's employees. After the first 5 minutes of them arriving at Google, I found myself annoyed by the mention of the company. I was not as mesmerized of this film as all of the self proclaimed geeks and teens apparently were. The only reason I even bothered watching it was because of the quantity of the glowing reviews on Amazon and other similar websites. It's interesting to note that many of the glowing reviews I read were written by people that have never reviewed anything else. That in itself makes me think that they either work for Google, or are paid to give it such a wonderful recommendation. Thankfully, I didn't have to pay for this train wreck.

Here they play Billy (Vaughn) and Nick a couple of watch salesmen just on one side or the other of age 40.  When their boss (John Goodman) shuts down his business the boys are out of work and with no formal education or technical skills, they decide to apply for an internship at Google.Since one of the terms of acceptance is that a prospect must be enrolled in college, Billy enrolls the pair at the University of Phoenix which Billy calls, ""the Harvard of on-line colleges."" They show up on the Mountain View campus and are surrounded by 20-something geniuses.  When 5 or 6 person teams are picked, our heroes are left with a group no one wants to associate with.  I'm not sure why as no one seems to know anyone else, so how this group is shunned is beyond me.No matter, quirky they are but they are also devoid of social skills.  That of course is where salesmen Billy and Nick excel.  Will it be enough however to win the competition which means being automatically hired by Google?  The charm of the movie is the patter between Billy and Nick and Vaughn and Wilson are masters.  While I wouldn't call the movie laugh-out-loud-hilarious, I would say there are plenty funny scenes.Rose Byrne makes an appearance as a potential love interest and boss for Nick.  Aasif Mandvi is the Google man in charge of the internship program and Max Minghella is the snobby leader of a competitive team.  There is nothing new here.

All Google products are not only innovative, they are user-friendly and practical. Through the whole challenges that the team of Nick faced, they never lost a touch with reality. Let's face it, being highly technical is useless if it can't serve and improve the business.That is why Google hires people from various backgrounds and with a diversity of skills. This is the reason why teamwork in the company is so crucially important. That is why it makes a huge difference between long working hours and effective working hours. You will find all these ideas presented in the movie in a subtle, yet highly effective way. Last but not least - the team never gave up. They fought for their dream often times not because of, but despite their background, education and experience. Are you already intrigued? Well, ""The Internship"" will not only make you laugh.

If you enjoy the two main actors other work, you'll find the comedy similar to their other movies, which I don't think is a bad thing at all. One facet of the movie that I enjoyed was that it discussed something rarely talked about. As seen in the preview, the two fellows in the story lose their jobs. They were great at their jobs and great with people, but they stuck themselves into a position with no real escape. That position collapsed on them, and they lost their jobs and had no other r&eacute;sum&eacute;-worthy skills to fall back on. The idea of Google is used to represent the availability of information; it used to be in libraries and book stores (and still is, to an extent). What happens to the characters is not discussed in this great of detail (it has to be inferred), but they settle into skills they are familiar with and stop looking for self (and business) expansion. It raises some interesting and very basic questions, like ""what is work?"" The movie does a great job of presenting classically-held beliefs, such as working for rude people at a job you don't like just to get a paycheck, and it also touches on working for a poor-paying job because you're good at it and enjoy it (their first jobs in the movie). The more modern idea--presented through the movie via the Google business model--is that people don't have to do something they don't enjoy forever and they don't have to accept less because they enjoy their work. Information has always been available, and this movie is about two guys who finally decide to take advantage of that information, to so something they thought about but never put into action.

I had as much fun with this movie as with Wedding Crashers, and even though there may have been a couple of overly silly jokes here, the overall experience was more than satisfactory.In this movie we see Vaughn's and Owen's characters struggling with a changing world, which I thought was a nice parallel to what I referenced above about their careers. The two friends find themselves out of a job when their careers selling watches clearly became obsolete. When they go for a bold move and decide to apply for an internship at Google, we get to see a clash of two worlds that provides a myriad of laughs and some very interesting social commentary. Maybe these old guys have something to teach the young techno wizards after all, but also may find some useful tips in the process.This is an outstanding comedy, with a nice variety of tools used to make us laugh. The cast is pretty impressive, and all of them do a great job in their roles.

Not genocide, but a mess where something worthwhile might occasionally, accidentally come out of it.  Vaughn's speeches have become less `cute' and more clich&eacute; this time around, and so it goes with The Internship.  The film opens with the most uncomfortable scene of the year where two forty-somethings played by Vaughn and co-star Owen Wilson wildly sing Alanis Morrisette's ""Ironic,"" which is ironically un-ironic as the scene is so cringe-inducing and not funny that you can't wait for it to end.  Vaughn and Wilson play Billy and Nick, two guys who lose their sales jobs and nonsensically end up as interns at Google in a final attempt to get their hands on that ever-elusive American dream.  And just in case that wasn't clear, prepare yourself for Owen Wilson's tepid recitation of Langston Hughes's ""A Dream Deferred.""Part of The Internship's humor revolves around how old Vaughn and Wilson are compared to the young, spry geniuses typically courted by Google.  However, that humor is lost rather quickly as it becomes too apparent that Vaughn and Wilson are simply too old for this.  Wilson is especially awkward.  He showed such promise in a more mature role with Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris, but it seems his days are numbered as the immature feathered haired sidekick.  It's laughable (in a bad way) to imagine that these two supposedly excellent salesmen still have live-in girlfriends and virtually no marketable skills.  Nick's foray into selling mattresses for his brother-in-law (played by Will Ferrell in a moderately funny cameo) proves that these guys are stereotypical screen characters just waiting to prove their worth at some inevitable time when their charm can benefit some unorthodox circumstance.Simply put, the first act of this film has hardly any redeeming quality and if you walked out, I wouldn't blame you.  Nonetheless, if you suffer through the laborious opening, things do get better - not much better, but better.  Bill and Nick (a pair of more ubiquitous names would be difficult to imagine) eventually find themselves the underdogs on a team of further underdogs who must compete against other intern teams for a chance at a full-time job with the company.  The tasks are obscenely unconventional as the audience is constantly barraged by propaganda about Google's progressive nature (Do Google interns truly take part in live competitive Quidditch matches?).  Nonetheless, once the exposition is complete, the film livens up a bit with an entertaining nightclub scene and a funny take on a ""first date"" scene when Nick courts an executive named Dana (Rose Byrne) who has conveniently forgotten how to have fun and needs a man to remind her of what's important (actually, feminists may want to avoid the movie in its entirety).Vaughn and Wilson teamed up once before in the incomparably better film, Wedding Crashers.  These two do have chemistry, but only if the material holds up.  Unfortunately for The Internship, it does not and only the screenwriter is to blame, Vince Vaughn.  Vaughn's two other screenwriting credits, The Break-Up and Couples Retreat, happen to be equally vapid.  His writing relies on cheap gags, stereotypes, and in the case of The Internship, a strange motif where the bushier a character's eyebrows, the more villainous the character's intentions.

1661801,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00DV1XYTO,Visual Bureau,"[0, 3]","""If you thought Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson could not be anymore wackier, wait until you see The Internship. They play two losing-out salespersons of watches only to then fake their way to enroll as University of Phoenix students applying for an internship at Google. Their plans to find work go back-and-forth to zaniness and mania knowing that they are unsure about the modern trends in technology around them with the young other interns.If you think the plot is too outlandish and concept-oriented, think again, this film actually exists and the product placement that it so has is put into good effect without meandering to be generic and silly all the way. The film also grabs your attention by just being utterly hilarious without it meaning to be with Vaughn's witty banter and Wilson's low-key whispering sense of dry humour. The chemistry is strong and seeing them get within the Google intern framework talking to the Australian woman, questioning responses to their internship manager, drinking and getting off their head with their colleagues (which is probably the most hilarious thing I have seen in a long time along with an interview scene involving Vaughn and Wilson at a public library), Vaughn saying ""on-the-line"" all the time, and them talking game to a pizza manager, a man with a elderly woman fixation, and them eating chips with U. of Phoenix shirts on.The film was beyond what I could have imagined and it keeps strong by being relevant, witty (with the intrinisic Google tech references), and down-to-earth in a way by showcasing the problems inherent with old-school workers and the new-school, tech-oriented types, trusting and believing in yourself, and managing to keep your head up high amidst adversity and a charlatan (played by Max Minghella here). There is a lot to see, laugh, hear, and probably learn here that the marketing gimmick found here does not seem wasted like you would find in a film like Transformers.While the film might seem a bit sentimental and generic to a casual Hollywood comedy script from 2006, it does not fail at that aspect, it actually enhances its weirdness in an era full of raunchy, R-rated comedies that boil down to over inflated jokes about drugs and sex. While it won't be on everyone's radar, The Internship is definitely one to look out for especially if you also like normal or high-concept comedies like Dodgeball, Wild Hogs, Without a Paddle, Caddyshack, and Happy Gilmore.""",5,"Surprisingly hilarious and witty in every scenario it encounters.

Nothing worth paying for here.  Watch it when it hits cable.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the acting was great, the movie was not completely boring, and the idea was a great one--just wasn't executed well.",3,Mildly Funny,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,507,"['movie', 'had', 'great', 'premise', 'very', 'tame', 'laughs', 'paint-by-numbers', 'plot', 'Very', 'bland', 'very', 'tame', 'very', 'cute', 'Not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'etc', 'comedy', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'fact', 'kind', 'made', 'FOR', 'kids', 'Nothing', 'worth', 'paying', 'here', 'Watch', 'when', 'cable', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'boring', 'idea', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'executed', 'well']",The Internship

While it defiantly has some good moments here and there, this is a very predictable and forgettable comedy.As many have said, it is a bit hard to get past all of the Google product placement in the film. Vaughn and Wilson are good, but this really felt a the kind of comedy that should've been released in the 80's. The plot is predictable and cheesy. Also, there is no reason this film needed to be 2 hours. It was way too long and got boring after a while. Not really a good comedy even though it had some funny moments. The best parts were in the first 45 minutes.Not the worst.
