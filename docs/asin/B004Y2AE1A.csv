1432985,A301C4SBHWTJV5,B004Y2AE1A,Brian P. Nestor,"[3, 3]","I can only give the highest review for this documentary.  There are tons of this type of material being released right now, but this one is done right.  First, they give a very specific life story, showing how the great showman came into being.  Second, they went into all of the insane gimmicks that he used in each and every picture he released.  Third, they showed his influence, especially on a certain Mr. Alfred Hitchcock, who made 'Psycho' as a direct copy of the production technique and exploitation marketing campaign that William Castle had pioneered.the interviews are many and wonderful, with such great film makers as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante, among many others.  The special features go into much greater details in the interviews.  It is especially interesting to see how, late in life, success - in the form of 'Rosemary's Baby' - really ruined him, in a perverse way.  My only complaint is that they don't cover ""Confessions of an Opiate Eater"", an obscure 1964 Vincent Price film that comes off as a racist fever dream.Overall, if you like movies, and really like the seamy side of the street, this documentary is as good as I have seen.",5,Great Fun!,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1171,"['can', 'only', 'give', 'highest', 'review', 'documentary', 'are', 'tons', 'type', 'material', 'being', 'released', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'done', 'right', 'First', 'give', 'very', 'specific', 'life', 'story', 'showing', 'how', 'great', 'showman', 'came', 'being', 'Second', 'went', 'insane', 'gimmicks', 'used', 'picture', 'released', 'Third', 'showed', 'influence', 'especially', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'made', ""'Psycho"", 'direct', 'copy', 'production', 'technique', 'exploitation', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'William', 'Castle', 'had', 'pioneered.the', 'interviews', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'makers', 'John', 'Waters', 'John', 'Landis', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'many', 'others', 'special', 'features', 'go', 'much', 'greater', 'details', 'interviews', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'late', 'life', 'success', 'form', ""'Rosemary"", 'Baby', 'really', 'ruined', 'perverse', 'way', 'only', 'complaint', 'do', ""n't"", 'cover', 'Confessions', 'Opiate', 'Eater', 'obscure', '1964', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'film', 'off', 'racist', 'fever', 'dream.Overall', 'like', 'movies', 'really', 'seamy', 'side', 'street', 'documentary', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'seen']",Spine Tingler!

Of course we've seen a lot of this before in some form - Castle talking in his trailers and in his gimmick films, and explanations of the gimmicks, but this film seems fresh and new and will also intrigue those who know very little of this great showman as well as die-hard fans.  For the first time we are given quite a decent account of his early years, so we can see what led up to the wacky films of the late 50s and early 60s, and it goes on to cover the end of his career.  You do get a sense of what he must have been like and at times it's quite moving to hear Terry Castle talking about her fab Dad. Lots of extras too.  If I have any criticism it's that the sound on the extra interviews (obviously filmed as best could be managed at recent showings of ""The Tingler"" and ""Spine Tingler!"") is uneven, so you have to turn the volume way up sometimes to hear what's being said.  But these are extras after all so it's a minor niggle.
