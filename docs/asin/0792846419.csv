Explores the parallels and similarities between the  brothers despite their leading very different sorts of lives. Theo could  never sell a single painting of Vincent's during his lifetime, but was  convinced of his brother's genius.  Displays the working and private lives  of both men, and shows the torment of both men as well, without resorting  to cliche or going overboard (ala Lust for Life). Both men died tragically  and young....within a year of each other.  Yet, Vincent's singleminded  devotion to his art and Theo's to his brother, insured that the world would  have the treasures of his genius.  Only complaint, some of the dialogue is  muttered in undertone and is hard to catch.  But, a minor complaint to a  fine film.",4,Unvarnished Van Gough,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,904,"['unblinking', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'unique', 'relationship', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gough', 'brother', 'Theo', 'who', 'supported', 'Vincent', 'life', 'career', 'parallels', 'similarities', 'brothers', 'leading', 'very', 'different', 'sorts', 'lives', 'Theo', 'could', 'never', 'sell', 'single', 'painting', 'Vincent', 'lifetime', 'was', 'convinced', 'brother', 'genius', 'working', 'private', 'lives', 'men', 'torment', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'resorting', 'cliche', 'going', 'overboard', 'ala', 'Lust', 'Life', 'men', 'died', 'tragically', 'young', 'year', 'other', 'Vincent', 'singleminded', 'devotion', 'art', 'Theo', 'brother', 'insured', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'treasures', 'genius', 'Only', 'complaint', 'dialogue', 'muttered', 'undertone', 'hard', 'catch', 'minor', 'complaint', 'fine', 'film']",N/A
156734,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,0792846419,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[45, 46]","I am happy VINCENT AND THEO has finally been released in some form, though I wish it had been a DVD. This is--bar none--the best film ever made about the life of Vincent van Gogh.As as Van Gogh junkie, I've taken no less than three college level courses on the man and his art, read many books about him, viewed every available film made about his life, visited the sites where he painted in Europe, and viewed his paintings in museums all over the world including the fabulous collection at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam -- once in 1990 when the museum hosted a retrospective of his art on the 100 year anniversary of his death.I am more or less a Tim Roth fan and have seen most of his films. Tim Roth has captured Van Gogh, the man and the artist. Paul Rhys (Gallowglass-PBS Mystery) has captured Paul Van Gogh, and the fabulous Dutch actress Johanna Ter Stege (Frau Beethoven in Immortal Beloved) has captured Paul's faithful wife.What if Vincent had succeeded as a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church?  What if his sensitivity to the suffering around him had fed his depression until he decided to end it all before he began to paint. What if Paul had not provided financial support to his apparently failed artist brother. What if Paul Van Gogh and his wife had discarded Vincent's paintings when he died (only about 3 were sold in Vincent's life time).  What if Mrs. Paul Van Gogh had tossed out Vincnet's paintings when Paul died shortly after Vincent. What if!!  But Mrs Van Gogh saved the paintings, and Paul's family gave the paintings to the Netherlands some years later.The vast majority of Vincent's paintings, as well as the Van Gogh brothers complete collection of the Hiroshege print series depicting the pilgrim's way to the sacred city of Edo, reside in the TWO Van Gogh museums in the Netherlands. Yes, there are two museums--Vincent painted at the rate of several paintings a day in his final three years in the south of France. There are six sunflower paintings (but only one 'Roses' given to the National Gallery in Washington DC. by Mrs. Harriman).Van Gogh's art was inspired by the newly developed art of photography, as well as the West's discovery of Japanese prints in the 19th Century. The fabulous cinematography of VINCENT AND THEO reflects this &quot;print&quot; perspective--cropped action with connections outside the frame.Many of the camera shots in VINCENT AND THEO are faithful recreatations of Vincent's paintings.  First we see the &quot;natural&quot; shot.  Then we see the actual painting Vincent was insprired to create.  For example, the room at Arles is captured in all it's Yellow, Blue, and Red simplicity.  Then we see one of the painting(s) of Vincent's Room.  In other shots, plum blossoms float on the air, crows fly overhead while the reaper sows his seeds, and sunflowers rustle in the breeze--fields and fields of sunflowers.See this film.  Buy this film.

156735,A328S9RN3U5M68,0792846419,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","VINCENT AND THEO is one of the finest cinematic biographies of an artist's life, mind, idiosyncrasies, and delayed appreciation of genius to date.  The multitalented Robert Altman created this brilliant masterpiece in 1990 and though this VHS version (where oh where is the DVD?!) of the American release is slightly over two hours in length, there apparently is more of the story meandering the European theatre.  Altman has the sense and sensitivity to create a script based on the letters of Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo van Gogh, a man equally as tortured as his famous brother but in different ways: Theo dedicated his life as an art dealer in Paris in the late 19th century attempting to sell his brother's art.  But Theo was even more than a brother supporting Vincent's unappreciated genius paintings, he also cared for Vincent's livelihood, provided 'bought' companions such as Gauguin to live with him in hopes of mutual communication and creative impetus, and tended to Vincent's problematic mental eccentricities that resulted in self mutilation and 'hospitalizations' in mental institutions.  Altman has crafted this story with intensive research and there rarely is a scene for the action that does not in some way reference one of van Gogh's paintings:  the screen is alive with the sunflower fields, the wheat fields, the poplars, the billiard table, the dank quarters in Arles and the oddities of the studios in Auvers, the bars and brothels, the salons of Paris.  But all of this would be for naught if the film were not well cast.  Tim Roth is totally immersed in the role of Vincent to the point that from his red hair, rotten teeth, hunched swagger, and body language,  he IS Vincent.  Few actors can make us tolerate a man so bent on harming himself and so full of emotional pain that his physical outbursts become obnoxious in their frequency.  Roth not only shows us this side of Vincent, but he transcends the public shell with the inordinately tender aspect of Vincent's brain.  As Theo, Paul Rhys is as extraordinary in his breadth of characterization as is Roth.  The well chosen supporting cast includes Wladimir Yordanoff as Gauguin, Jean-Pierre Cassel as Dr. Gachet, and Johanna Ter Steege as the bizarre wife of Theo, to mention only a few.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the consummate musical score by Gabriel Yared captures the inner workings of van Gogh's agonizingly tangled mind while still soaring with the incarnations of the landscapes van Gogh painted.  One only hopes that the complete version of this film will be made available on DVD - for artists, for art libraries, for art lovers, and for all of us who care about the special qualities of genius that sometimes sleep until time and taste awakens them.

Amazing acting by Tim Roth and Paul Rhys, and the whole film is tremendously moving.For me, Altman achieves a sort of dream state far more interesting than in the more critically acclaimed `3 Women'. He manages to make you feel the whole story as completely real, as if you were there in history, and yet, it has a fractured, dreamlike quality, with moments left unexplained and mysterious, but always making emotional sense.I don't know any film that better captures the pain of being an artist, or the pain of being unable to save someone you love. Also, the whole film looks gloriously like a painting.There is a longer version, originally made for European TV, but I actually think the rhythms are far better in the US theatrical cut. The Euro version mostly adds tons of exposition that takes away from the mysterious, subjective tone that makes this work so well.",5,A woefully overlooked Altman masterpiece,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,940,"['woefully', 'overlooked', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Altman', 'Amazing', 'acting', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Paul', 'Rhys', 'whole', 'film', 'tremendously', 'moving.For', 'Altman', 'sort', 'dream', 'state', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'critically', 'acclaimed', '3', 'Women', 'make', 'feel', 'whole', 'story', 'completely', 'real', 'were', 'there', 'history', 'yet', 'fractured', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'moments', 'left', 'unexplained', 'mysterious', 'always', 'making', 'emotional', 'sense.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'better', 'pain', 'being', 'artist', 'pain', 'being', 'unable', 'save', 'someone', 'love', 'Also', 'whole', 'film', 'gloriously', 'painting.There', 'longer', 'version', 'originally', 'made', 'European', 'TV', 'actually', 'think', 'rhythms', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'US', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Euro', 'version', 'mostly', 'tons', 'exposition', 'away', 'mysterious', 'subjective', 'tone', 'work', 'so', 'well']",N/A
156737,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792846419,Matthew Horner,"[40, 42]","""Vincent and Theo"" is an atypical film for Robert Altman  - no repartee, no overlapping dialog, almost no humor, little overt social commentary. But who better than this fiercely independent and creative director to paint a cinematic portrait of the intense, complex relationship between the wildly creative and eccentric 19th Century artist, Vincent Van Gogh, and his brother, Theo?The movie covers only the last years of their short, extraordinary lives, but these are among the most important historically because Vincent produced so many masterpieces during them. I assume the screenplay is based on the many letters the brothers sent to each other. Considering the chaos that filled their lives, it is almost miraculous that Vincent's works survived, not to mention the letters. Vincent and Theo certainly didn't survive the chaos.Tim Roth and Paul Rhys are brilliant as, respectively, Vincent and  Theo. Ordinarily, it might be irritating to have two main characters with so many tics and odd physical mannerisms, but the idea works here because it cements the illusion that the two are brothers in every way. Vincent may have the artistic genius, but in every other way, they are cut from the same mold.The photography is stunning, especially in the sections where we see the scenery colored much the way Vincent might have seen it. The locales are well chosen, and the sets and costumes look appropriately late 19th Century European.One of the advantages of modern cinema's freedoms is that it can show historic figures with warts and all, and Altman takes full advantage of this. Vincent is scrawny and has rotten teeth, while Theo is obviously syphilitic. Not to disparage biographical movies of fifty years ago, such as the 1956 film about Van Gogh, ""Lust for Life"" with Kirk Douglas, but I find these modern visions much more truthful and accessible. Somehow, by humanizing such people, their genius seems somehow more amazing and profound.This is one of Altman's more difficult movies, but it is also one of the most rewarding. If there is a social message to it, it must be this: As a society, we have forgotten or dismissed the idea that artistic geniuses are, more often than not, not blessed with certain important social skills. This is a primary reason why they must and should be supported, just as Theo selflessly provided emotionally and financially for his tormented, graceless brother who sold just one painting in his lifetime.
