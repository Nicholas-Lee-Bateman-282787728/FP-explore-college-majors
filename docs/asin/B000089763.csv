Yes, they're working with neighbors, but the designers rarely if ever listen to what the neighbors KNOW their friends are looking for. Have you looked at the faces of people who walk into the new rooms?!?!  The vast majority are stricken, feeling ill.Where do they find these designers? They sure aren't ""Christopher Lowell"". There is a way to meld your style as a designer to the client, and if totally at odds, the client should prevail.  Boo hiss to this show.

Most of it was just show clips that actually aired, which provides the hardcore fan (to who I assume this DVD is aimed) nothing much more than what had already aired?  Where are the interviews?  Where are the actual bloopers?  where are the mishaps that had to occur over the 2 seasons?This makes a good rental disc at best.  There is little if any rewatching value here.",2,Where's the Beef?,1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,493,"['felt', 'Clara', 'Peller', 'watching', 'DVD', 'promising', 'bloopers', 'outtakes', 'such', 'very', 'little', 'Most', 'was', 'just', 'show', 'clips', 'actually', 'aired', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'who', 'assume', 'DVD', 'aimed', 'nothing', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'had', 'already', 'aired', 'Where', 'are', 'interviews', 'Where', 'are', 'actual', 'bloopers', 'where', 'are', 'mishaps', 'had', 'occur', '2', 'seasons', 'good', 'rental', 'disc', 'best', 'little', 'rewatching', 'value', 'here']",The Best of Trading Spaces
735883,ACFTPKBAVA1F8,B000089763,Peter A. Greene,"[5, 5]","This DVD plays like the &quot;special features&quot; portion of any DVD-- there just isn't any main feature to go with it. The 121 minutes playing time is the result of adding the umpteen little clip-shows together, plus, I would guess, the running time of the menu.The clip selections are not bad, but they are certainly brief. Each current cast member gets a short featurette, and those do aa good job of capturing the flavor of that individual. And even though they include a &quot;history of...&quot; feature, Alex is completely ignored (Des, too, but I can almost understand that...)So if you sit down with this, you'll work the remote a lot and be done in a couple of hours. Mixed feelings here-- if someone gave it to you as aa gift, you'd probably be delighted and enjoy it. But if you shell out your own money for it, you may end up feeling a bit cheated...",3,Extras without a main feature,1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,866,"['DVD', 'quot', 'special', 'features', 'quot', 'portion', 'DVD', 'just', ""n't"", 'main', 'feature', 'go', '121', 'minutes', 'playing', 'time', 'result', 'adding', 'umpteen', 'little', 'clip-shows', 'together', 'would', 'guess', 'running', 'time', 'menu.The', 'clip', 'selections', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'certainly', 'brief', 'current', 'cast', 'member', 'short', 'featurette', 'do', 'aa', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'flavor', 'individual', 'even', 'include', 'quot', 'history', 'quot', 'feature', 'Alex', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Des', 'too', 'can', 'almost', 'understand', 'So', 'sit', 'down', ""'ll"", 'work', 'remote', 'lot', 'be', 'done', 'couple', 'hours', 'Mixed', 'feelings', 'here', 'someone', 'gave', 'aa', 'gift', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'delighted', 'enjoy', 'shell', 'out', 'own', 'money', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'bit', 'cheated']",The Best of Trading Spaces
735884,A3CH1KT8XQE8SA,B000089763,"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[12, 16]","First of all, I have to agree with previous viewers that this DVD (in addition to the accompanying book) lacks in any effort to show the home improvement projects which their show is about! Instead, all focus is on the people involved. Personally, my main reason for watching Trading Spaces is to see the creative decorating and projects that are involved. (If you are more into the personalities involved then you may just enjoy this DVD.) My second objection to this DVD concerns the fact that there are several reveals which I felt were very worthy of being included with the worst and the best. What about the military man who insisted that they leave his carpet alone and didn't want dark colors but Hilde went ahead and took out the carpet and painted his walls black? That episode remains a classic in my eyes. Oh well.Because there wasn't any focus on the decorating and several worthy episodes were excluded, you may be asking is it worth it buying this DVD? My verdict is no; and I consider myself to be a fan of this show. Personally, I borrowed this DVD from my sister and don't have any plans to add it to my DVD collection.If you enjoy Trading Spaces be sure to catch Changing Rooms and Home Invaders both airing on BBC America. I learned much more decorating tips and don't have to deal with Paige.",2,THE BEST (OF WHAT)?,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,1313,"['First', 'have', 'agree', 'previous', 'viewers', 'DVD', 'addition', 'accompanying', 'book', 'effort', 'show', 'home', 'improvement', 'projects', 'show', 'Instead', 'focus', 'people', 'involved', 'Personally', 'main', 'reason', 'watching', 'Trading', 'Spaces', 'see', 'creative', 'decorating', 'projects', 'are', 'involved', 'are', 'more', 'personalities', 'involved', 'then', 'may', 'just', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'second', 'objection', 'DVD', 'fact', 'are', 'several', 'reveals', 'felt', 'were', 'very', 'worthy', 'being', 'included', 'worst', 'best', 'What', 'military', 'man', 'who', 'insisted', 'leave', 'carpet', 'alone', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'dark', 'colors', 'Hilde', 'went', 'ahead', 'took', 'out', 'carpet', 'painted', 'walls', 'black', 'episode', 'classic', 'eyes', 'Oh', 'was', ""n't"", 'focus', 'decorating', 'several', 'worthy', 'episodes', 'were', 'excluded', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'buying', 'DVD', 'verdict', 'consider', 'be', 'fan', 'show', 'Personally', 'borrowed', 'DVD', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection.If', 'enjoy', 'Trading', 'Spaces', 'be', 'sure', 'catch', 'Changing', 'Rooms', 'Home', 'Invaders', 'airing', 'BBC', 'America', 'learned', 'much', 'more', 'decorating', 'tips', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'Paige']",The Best of Trading Spaces

If you are obsessed with the characters on the show, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're like me and are hoping to get ideas for decorating, skip this one and wait until they release the seasons. I hope this isn't an indication of how the producers intend to trickle out bits and pieces of the show while charging fans a premium.
