385227,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,630368727X,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[10, 10]","Three things make this average made-for-TV movie watchable: A very able cast, a nice web of evil and paranoia that is spun around the central character and serves up a couple of ""plot twists"" towards the end, and for the ladies in the audience, Tom Selleck has never looked finer.With a script by Joan Didion and Gregory Dunne from William Wood's novel ""Court of Honor"", it's about a squeaky clean judge that gets snared by the Justice Department into doing a sting operation for them, to catch the others on the bench that are on the take, and finds himself knee deep in the slime of courtroom intrigue and paybacks.The plot is somewhat predictable, but it's entertaining, largely held together by the actors; Tom Selleck is excellent and has the serious demeanor and screen presence to carry off the part of Judge Nash, Elizabeth McGovern and William Atherton are the feds from hell, Marsha Mason does a good turn as a judge, and Fritz Weaver plays Selleck's father.Courtroom fans will find this enjoyable, Selleck fans will drool, and with its plot twists and turns, it certainly makes a worthwhile rental.Total running time is 97 minutes.",4,"standard fare, but well done",1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,1142,"['Three', 'things', 'make', 'average', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'watchable', 'very', 'able', 'cast', 'nice', 'web', 'evil', 'paranoia', 'spun', 'central', 'character', 'up', 'couple', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'ladies', 'audience', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'never', 'looked', 'finer.With', 'script', 'Joan', 'Didion', 'Gregory', 'Dunne', 'William', 'Wood', 'novel', 'Court', 'Honor', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'judge', 'snared', 'Justice', 'Department', 'doing', 'sting', 'operation', 'catch', 'others', 'bench', 'are', 'take', 'knee', 'deep', 'slime', 'courtroom', 'intrigue', 'paybacks.The', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'entertaining', 'largely', 'held', 'together', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'excellent', 'serious', 'demeanor', 'screen', 'presence', 'carry', 'off', 'part', 'Judge', 'Nash', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'William', 'Atherton', 'are', 'feds', 'hell', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'good', 'turn', 'judge', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Selleck', 'father.Courtroom', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'Selleck', 'fans', 'will', 'drool', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'rental.Total', 'running', 'time', '97', 'minutes']",Broken Trust VHS
