312058,A1YCV76MUFESR1,630242500X,Anne-Marie G,"[5, 6]","This is the earliest movie rendering of the Chopin/Sand affair I have seen to date. However, in this, Sand is more of an impediment to what Chopin must do--raise funds for his Polish rebel friends.  This is something that has been neglected to a degree, in the other two movies I have seen on this subject (Impromptu, Desire for Love). Both acknowledge his Polish-ness and one does even show his rushed departure from his beloved homeland.However neither really illustrate his ties with the rebels of the country in the same way this one does.  This one is based on the idea that Poland was his sole reason for playing and performing that Poland was the source of his greatest triumph (The Polianse--not sure I spelled that right).While Sand's character is clearly maligned for the sake of a more inspiring plot, she is portrayed beautifully by Merle Oberon, who looks fantastic in the very stylized outfits. (An attempt to capture Sand's cross-dressing ways) Her children, who played a huge role in the Sand/Chopin relationship have been completely eliminated. Instead she is given the odd notion of being a semi-hermit. Someone who beleives that artists should be paid tribute to and not forced to perform for the general rabble.Cornel Wilde does an amazing job, while not looking the part of the waifish Chopin (I think Hugh Grant might be my favorite, honestly), he acts it so as to really convince me. And he didn't do it with a silly accent (unlike the French accent he sports in 'The Sword of Lancelot')  He plays Chopin with a sort of sweet innocence that flames his passion for his country and allows us to forgive him for his lack of abilty to really be his own man when faced with the opposition of Sand and his Professor.The Professor character while mostly endearing was at times very over the top--played by Paul Muni, whom I don't personally recognize from anything else.  I did enjoy him as a sort of anchor for Chopin though, and he really was very endearing in the manner which he kept in contact with Chopin's family.A reallly enjoyable movie, but certainly not a real biography.  It had two scenes which I really admired, firstly the introduction of Chopin and Lizt ""If you play the harmony and I play the melody then we shall each have a free hand""  and Sand's little trick on the Parisians to gain acceptance for Chopin's music. The moment she walks in the the darkened room with her candelabra (in full women's dress, looking amazing)  It really looked great.",4,Several Moments to remember.,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2482,"['earliest', 'movie', 'rendering', 'Chopin/Sand', 'affair', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'However', 'Sand', 'more', 'impediment', 'what', 'Chopin', 'must', 'do', 'raise', 'funds', 'Polish', 'rebel', 'friends', 'something', 'been', 'neglected', 'degree', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'subject', 'Impromptu', 'Desire', 'Love', 'Polish-ness', 'one', 'even', 'show', 'rushed', 'departure', 'beloved', 'homeland.However', 'really', 'illustrate', 'ties', 'rebels', 'country', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'one', 'based', 'idea', 'Poland', 'was', 'sole', 'reason', 'playing', 'performing', 'Poland', 'was', 'source', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'Polianse', 'not', 'sure', 'spelled', 'right', 'Sand', 'character', 'clearly', 'maligned', 'sake', 'more', 'inspiring', 'plot', 'portrayed', 'beautifully', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'who', 'fantastic', 'very', 'stylized', 'outfits', 'attempt', 'capture', 'Sand', 'cross-dressing', 'ways', 'children', 'who', 'played', 'huge', 'role', 'Sand/Chopin', 'relationship', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'Instead', 'given', 'odd', 'notion', 'being', 'semi-hermit', 'Someone', 'who', 'artists', 'should', 'be', 'paid', 'tribute', 'not', 'forced', 'perform', 'general', 'rabble.Cornel', 'Wilde', 'amazing', 'job', 'not', 'looking', 'part', 'waifish', 'Chopin', 'think', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'might', 'be', 'favorite', 'honestly', 'so', 'really', 'convince', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'silly', 'accent', 'French', 'accent', 'sports', ""'The"", 'Sword', 'Lancelot', 'Chopin', 'sort', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'passion', 'country', 'forgive', 'lack', 'abilty', 'really', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'when', 'faced', 'opposition', 'Sand', 'Professor.The', 'Professor', 'character', 'mostly', 'endearing', 'was', 'times', 'very', 'top', 'played', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'recognize', 'anything', 'else', 'did', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'anchor', 'Chopin', 'really', 'was', 'very', 'endearing', 'manner', 'kept', 'contact', 'Chopin', 'family.A', 'reallly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'real', 'biography', 'had', 'two', 'scenes', 'really', 'admired', 'firstly', 'introduction', 'Chopin', 'Lizt', 'play', 'harmony', 'play', 'melody', 'then', 'shall', 'have', 'free', 'hand', 'Sand', 'little', 'trick', 'Parisians', 'gain', 'acceptance', 'Chopin', 'music', 'moment', 'darkened', 'room', 'candelabra', 'full', 'women', 'dress', 'looking', 'amazing', 'really', 'looked', 'great']",N/A

After seeing it, I enjoyed the film so much that it spurred me to seek out some biographical information on his life.  After having done so, I realized that the story in the film bore very little resemblance to the truth and I was greatly disappointed.  It was just another example of extremely entertaining Hollywood drivel.As a work of fiction, the film was nicely done.  The story was enchanting and it painted Chopin as a very noble patriot, playing himself to death in concerts to earn money to support the Polish revolution, though I found no support for that in anything I read.  Cornel Wilde was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, which was excellent indeed, but he was incongruously cast.  Wilde is handsome and athletic looking and Chopin was plain and frail.  Paul Muni, though charming in the role of Professor Elsner, was much too eccentric and ebulliently peculiar to be very believable.  The best performance by far was given by Merle Oberon as the cold and iron willed George Sand, whose love affair with Chopin turned into a tyrannical attempt to shelter him from the world.The best part of this film was the music of Chopin himself, played brilliantly by Jose Iturbi.  The music alone was worth enduring the Hollywood prevarication.  I also enjoyed the 19th Century costumes.I rated this film a 7/10.  If it were a fictional account of some person who never existed, I probably would have rated it a 9/10, because it was very enjoyable.

A brilliant prodigy and a loyal Pole, Chopin is forced to flee his country when his anti-Russian activities prove dangerous. He and his teacher go to Paris, where he gains fame as a composer but falls under the spell of a ruthless Svengali (Merle Oberon).If you are a classical music lover, this is the film for you. Chopin's works are beautifully played and his Heroic Polonaise in A-flat Major, No. 53 is given the spotlight. Wilde delivers a tender and passionate, Oscar-nominated performance (the movie received six nominations in all). He's dreamboat-handsome and this is the best role of his career. This could have been a five-star review, but I had to deduct one star for the horrible miscasting and buffoonish work of Paul Muni; his character was obviously meant to give some comic relief to a grim story, but he has more screen time than Wilde and spends it making ridiculous, annoying faces. Merle Oberon, as the writer George Sand, is a one-dimensional, cruel, witch and we are left to wonder why Chopin found her so irresistible.But the movie is all about the music and that is glorious.

312070,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,630242500X,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[8, 8]","For students of music, 'A Song to Remember' is to criticize, since it greatly romanticizes the life of Chopin and adds many fictional tissues...However, criticism on that level must be tempered with the understanding that in 1945 this film did a deal to interest a wide public in Chopin's music... With the music adapted by Miklos Rozsa and performed by Jos&eacute; Iturbi, there is much to enjoy and admire...According to Sidney Buchman's screenplay, Chopin is a political idealist who devotes much of his career to adopt the cause of his native Poland in its struggle to throw off czarist oppression... As a young man Chopin (Cornel Wilde) sides with the revolutionaries, to the concern of his sagacious teacher and mentor Joseph Elsner (Paul Muni). When Chopin goes to Paris to win fame and money to support his political friends, Elsner accompanies him, to guide and protect him...In the halls of a music publisher, Chopin makes the acquaintance of Franz Liszt (Stephen Bekassy), who is already an admirer of the young Pole's compositions... Liszt befriends him, promotes his career, and introduces him to the elegant and romantic novelist Georges Sand (Merle Oberon). The tempestuous couple fall in love and Chopin, against Elsner's advice, goes with her on a journey to Majorca, where his health is undermined...The facts are that Chopin was never an active Polish revolutionary and pursued a career without political motivation... He went to Paris alone, and his affair with Georges Sand lasted eight years, until he left her after a quarrel...Elsner did not accompany Chopin to Paris from Poland, nor did he ever engage in a duel of wits with George Sand for control of Chopin's life and aims...Constantia, the character played by Nina Foch, never went to Paris to plead with Chopin to help his fellow Poles in their struggle against Czarist rule... Elsner and Sand never reflected, nor influenced Chopin's musical style to the degree implied in the film, and it would be a mistake to accept the movie impression of Sand as a nymphomaniac who betrayed Musset, destroyed Chopin, and changed her philosophy and politics to suit the views of each successive lover... When Sand thought she had found something approaching perfection in a man, she lived with him for years... She remained impervious to Musset's skeptical views and Chopin's aristocratic prejudices...However, Charles Vidor's film is a handsome Technicolor extravaganza, directed with all the sweep and emotional vitality for which he was characterized... The film showcases a highly mannered Paul Muni; an effusive and intense Merle Oberon (a petite, exotic-looking and strikingly beautiful brunette, wearing gorgeous gowns, walking with grand &eacute;clat) and an elegantly tormented Cornel Wilde...Having taken due note of all this, it is only fair to state that if one is willing to surrender to the gorgeous romanticism of the doings, and if one approaches 'A Song to Remember' as a fictional tale about a 19th century composer who wrote exquisite concertos, penetrating solo pieces, who loved the eccentric George Sand, who wanted to help his fellow Poles in the effort, who proved ungrateful to his mentor, then one is faced with electrifying scenes, courtesy of Merle Oberon who was never more forceful in her tense confrontation scenes with Muni for Wilde's attention and acknowledgment... Paul Muni's performance exuded a poetic kind-heartedness with quiet realism...When the indifferent but determined Chopin decides to embark on the concert tour that will raise money for ""the cause,"" Oberon seems very exciting in her trenchant speech about the bitterness and sorrow of her past that had hardened her to defy the world with her individualism...Fine characterizations are contributed by Stephen Bekassy as Franz Lisz, George Coulouris as music publisher Louis Pleyel, and George Macready as Alfred De Musset, one of the more conspicuous lovers of Sand...If taken as an essentially fictional work, 'A Song to Remember' is hilarious classical musical biopic which was unexpectedly popular...",3,A handsome Technicolor extravaganza...,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,4070,"['students', 'music', 'A', 'Song', 'Remember', 'criticize', 'greatly', 'life', 'Chopin', 'many', 'fictional', 'tissues', 'However', 'criticism', 'level', 'must', 'be', 'tempered', 'understanding', '1945', 'film', 'did', 'deal', 'interest', 'wide', 'public', 'Chopin', 'music', 'music', 'adapted', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'performed', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Iturbi', 'much', 'enjoy', 'admire', 'According', 'Sidney', 'Buchman', 'screenplay', 'Chopin', 'political', 'idealist', 'who', 'much', 'career', 'adopt', 'cause', 'native', 'Poland', 'struggle', 'throw', 'off', 'czarist', 'oppression', 'young', 'man', 'Chopin', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'sides', 'revolutionaries', 'concern', 'sagacious', 'teacher', 'mentor', 'Joseph', 'Elsner', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'When', 'Chopin', 'Paris', 'win', 'fame', 'money', 'support', 'political', 'friends', 'Elsner', 'guide', 'protect', 'halls', 'music', 'publisher', 'Chopin', 'acquaintance', 'Franz', 'Liszt', 'Stephen', 'Bekassy', 'who', 'already', 'admirer', 'young', 'Pole', 'compositions', 'Liszt', 'career', 'elegant', 'romantic', 'novelist', 'Georges', 'Sand', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'tempestuous', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'Chopin', 'Elsner', 'advice', 'journey', 'Majorca', 'where', 'health', 'undermined', 'facts', 'are', 'Chopin', 'was', 'never', 'active', 'Polish', 'revolutionary', 'pursued', 'career', 'political', 'motivation', 'went', 'Paris', 'alone', 'affair', 'Georges', 'Sand', 'lasted', 'eight', 'years', 'left', 'quarrel', 'Elsner', 'did', 'not', 'accompany', 'Chopin', 'Paris', 'Poland', 'did', 'ever', 'engage', 'duel', 'wits', 'George', 'Sand', 'control', 'Chopin', 'life', 'aims', 'Constantia', 'character', 'played', 'Nina', 'Foch', 'never', 'went', 'Paris', 'plead', 'Chopin', 'help', 'fellow', 'Poles', 'struggle', 'Czarist', 'rule', 'Elsner', 'Sand', 'never', 'reflected', 'influenced', 'Chopin', 'musical', 'style', 'degree', 'implied', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'accept', 'movie', 'impression', 'Sand', 'nymphomaniac', 'who', 'betrayed', 'Musset', 'destroyed', 'Chopin', 'changed', 'philosophy', 'politics', 'suit', 'views', 'successive', 'lover', 'When', 'Sand', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'something', 'approaching', 'perfection', 'man', 'lived', 'years', 'remained', 'impervious', 'Musset', 'skeptical', 'views', 'Chopin', 'aristocratic', 'prejudices', 'However', 'Charles', 'Vidor', 'film', 'handsome', 'Technicolor', 'extravaganza', 'directed', 'sweep', 'emotional', 'vitality', 'was', 'characterized', 'film', 'highly', 'mannered', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'effusive', 'intense', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'petite', 'exotic-looking', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'brunette', 'wearing', 'gorgeous', 'gowns', 'walking', 'grand', 'eacute', 'clat', 'elegantly', 'tormented', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Having', 'taken', 'due', 'note', 'only', 'fair', 'state', 'one', 'willing', 'surrender', 'gorgeous', 'romanticism', 'doings', 'one', 'approaches', 'A', 'Song', 'Remember', 'fictional', 'tale', '19th', 'century', 'composer', 'who', 'wrote', 'exquisite', 'concertos', 'penetrating', 'solo', 'pieces', 'who', 'loved', 'eccentric', 'George', 'Sand', 'who', 'wanted', 'help', 'fellow', 'Poles', 'effort', 'who', 'proved', 'ungrateful', 'mentor', 'then', 'one', 'faced', 'electrifying', 'scenes', 'courtesy', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'forceful', 'tense', 'confrontation', 'scenes', 'Muni', 'Wilde', 'attention', 'acknowledgment', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'performance', 'exuded', 'poetic', 'kind-heartedness', 'quiet', 'realism', 'When', 'indifferent', 'determined', 'Chopin', 'decides', 'embark', 'concert', 'tour', 'will', 'raise', 'money', 'cause', 'Oberon', 'very', 'exciting', 'trenchant', 'speech', 'bitterness', 'sorrow', 'past', 'had', 'hardened', 'defy', 'world', 'individualism', 'Fine', 'characterizations', 'are', 'contributed', 'Stephen', 'Bekassy', 'Franz', 'Lisz', 'George', 'Coulouris', 'music', 'publisher', 'Louis', 'Pleyel', 'George', 'Macready', 'Alfred', 'De', 'Musset', 'one', 'more', 'conspicuous', 'lovers', 'Sand', 'taken', 'essentially', 'fictional', 'work', 'A', 'Song', 'Remember', 'hilarious', 'classical', 'musical', 'biopic', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'popular']",N/A
