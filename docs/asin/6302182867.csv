300428,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302182867,Alex Udvary,"[6, 6]","""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" was made in 1936, just two years after the original ""Thin Man"" was released. Already by 1936 several sequels in the ""Thin Man"" series had been made so it was clear the movies had a formula which worked.I tell you all this useless information because ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" follows the same formula. And many people will criticize this movie for that. I am not. I don't think of this made so much as a knock-off of the ""Thin Man"" series but instead I think of it as another part of the series minus Myrna Loy, whom I'll pretend was unavailable for shooting, so they got the next best thing, Jean Arthur, who was also a fine comedic actress.The movie is about a well-known doctor, William Powell who had gotten a divorce from Arthur who writes mystery novels. A jockey during a big race is murdered and soon the horses owner, Mike North (Frank M. Thomas) wants Dr. Lawrence Bradford (Powell) to examine the body for foul play. It seems the body, which fell off a horse, was dead before it hit the ground. But things don't work out so well for Dr. Bradford, a package it sent to his house, adressed to North, and inside the package is a large sum of money. Soon North is found dead in Bradford's house and now the police think he killed North and knows something about the jockey's death.Now since his wife Paula (Arthur) is a mystery writer she think she can help the police solve the case and decides to move back in with Powell to protect him. This of course adds a small amount of romance to the story.I guess you could say Jean Arthur is in the William Powell role of the ""Thin Man"" series. I don't think that makes Powell the ""Myrna Loy"" of this film. The only difference between the character in this film and Nick Charles is Dr. Bradford is not a drunk. If you remember the ""Thin Man"" movies always had a joke in them about his drinking. Other than that I think the characters are the same.There was a ""Thin Man"" movie called ""The Shadow of the Thin Man"" which also dealt with a race-track theme. If you like you could compare both of those movies, but I don't advise it. Even though yes it is true ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" does borrow heavily from the ""Thin Man"" movies, but as I said, merely think of this movie as another part of the series. If you do that it's not as disappointing.If you enjoyed any or all of the ""Thin Man"" movies I think you'll find this movie to be entertaining. It's not as funny as those movies, or at least I think so, but it still has some good moments and I'm a big fan of William Powell and Jean Arthur.Bottom-line: Not really a rip-off of the ""Thin Man"" movies just another part of the series. Powell and Arthur do their best to keep the movie going along and the movie works because of them.",3,A Day At The Races,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,2750,"['Ex-Mrs.', 'Bradford', 'was', 'made', '1936', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'original', 'Thin', 'Man', 'was', 'released', 'Already', '1936', 'several', 'sequels', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'clear', 'movies', 'had', 'formula', 'worked.I', 'useless', 'information', 'Ex-Mrs.', 'Bradford', 'same', 'formula', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'criticize', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'knock-off', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'instead', 'think', 'part', 'series', 'minus', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'pretend', 'was', 'unavailable', 'shooting', 'got', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'fine', 'comedic', 'actress.The', 'movie', 'well-known', 'doctor', 'William', 'Powell', 'who', 'had', 'gotten', 'divorce', 'Arthur', 'who', 'mystery', 'novels', 'jockey', 'big', 'race', 'murdered', 'soon', 'horses', 'owner', 'Mike', 'North', 'Frank', 'M.', 'Thomas', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Bradford', 'Powell', 'examine', 'body', 'foul', 'play', 'body', 'fell', 'off', 'horse', 'was', 'dead', 'hit', 'ground', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'Dr.', 'Bradford', 'package', 'sent', 'house', 'adressed', 'North', 'package', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'Soon', 'North', 'found', 'dead', 'Bradford', 'house', 'now', 'police', 'think', 'killed', 'North', 'something', 'jockey', 'death.Now', 'wife', 'Paula', 'Arthur', 'mystery', 'writer', 'think', 'can', 'help', 'police', 'solve', 'case', 'decides', 'move', 'back', 'Powell', 'protect', 'course', 'small', 'amount', 'romance', 'story.I', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'William', 'Powell', 'role', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'film', 'only', 'difference', 'character', 'film', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'Dr.', 'Bradford', 'not', 'drunk', 'remember', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'always', 'had', 'joke', 'drinking', 'Other', 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'same.There', 'was', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movie', 'called', 'Shadow', 'Thin', 'Man', 'also', 'race-track', 'theme', 'like', 'could', 'compare', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'advise', 'Even', 'yes', 'true', 'Ex-Mrs.', 'Bradford', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'said', 'merely', 'think', 'movie', 'part', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'disappointing.If', 'enjoyed', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'movies', 'least', 'think', 'so', 'still', 'good', 'moments', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'William', 'Powell', 'Jean', 'Arthur.Bottom-line', 'Not', 'really', 'rip-off', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'just', 'part', 'series', 'Powell', 'Arthur', 'do', 'best', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'along', 'movie']",N/A
300429,A62OMGKSVPZZU,6302182867,"Andrew R. Oerman ""Andy Oerman""","[5, 7]","Obviously made to capitalize on the success of the Thin Man, this film is alright in some spots, confusing in others, and dull in the rest. Powell is his usual effortlessly entertaining self, and the absolutely beautiful Jean Arthur makes up for a lot, in the role paralleling Myrna Loy's. Just not enough.The movie takes its rather uninformative name from the story point that Bradford (Powell) divorced his mystery-writing wife (Arthur) because of the murder investigations she kept dragging him into. And she is able to do it again here.So we see that the set-up is very similar to the Thin Man movies, which had Loy dragging Powell into mysteries after he had wanted to retire and be a nice, rich, idle drunk. The attitude is also very similar to the Thin Man movies; sophisticated screwball whodunits were much en vogue in Hollywood at the time this one was released, thanks to the creations of Dashiell Hammett, and I'm sure that there are dozens of others similar to this one.But this one has a plot more convoluted and bizarre than most, involving spiders, horseracing, heart failure and various pursuant hoods. That all makes it sound more interesting than it really is. It is quite static, the twists and turns are patently unbelievable, the dialogue often seems forced, and it's never as clever as it thinks it is. Plus, too much of the time is delegated to the inevitable patch-up between Bradford and the Ex-Mrs. Bradford.Maybe if the mystery would have been more simple and the love story a little less simple, the movie would have benefitted. But not a bad time-waster for genre fans. A 2-and-a-half-star effort, really.See also: All of the Thin Man films, especially The Shadow of the Thin Man.",2,Muddled Mystery of Murder and Matrimony,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,1710,"['Obviously', 'made', 'capitalize', 'success', 'Thin', 'Man', 'film', 'alright', 'spots', 'confusing', 'others', 'dull', 'rest', 'Powell', 'usual', 'effortlessly', 'entertaining', 'self', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'up', 'lot', 'role', 'paralleling', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Just', 'not', 'enough.The', 'movie', 'rather', 'uninformative', 'name', 'story', 'point', 'Bradford', 'Powell', 'divorced', 'mystery-writing', 'wife', 'Arthur', 'murder', 'investigations', 'kept', 'dragging', 'able', 'do', 'again', 'see', 'set-up', 'very', 'similar', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'had', 'Loy', 'dragging', 'Powell', 'mysteries', 'had', 'wanted', 'retire', 'be', 'nice', 'rich', 'idle', 'drunk', 'attitude', 'also', 'very', 'similar', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'sophisticated', 'screwball', 'whodunits', 'were', 'much', 'vogue', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'thanks', 'creations', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'dozens', 'others', 'similar', 'one.But', 'one', 'plot', 'more', 'convoluted', 'bizarre', 'most', 'involving', 'spiders', 'horseracing', 'heart', 'failure', 'various', 'pursuant', 'hoods', 'sound', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'quite', 'static', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'patently', 'unbelievable', 'dialogue', 'often', 'forced', 'never', 'as', 'clever', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'delegated', 'inevitable', 'patch-up', 'Bradford', 'Ex-Mrs.', 'Bradford.Maybe', 'mystery', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'little', 'less', 'simple', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'not', 'bad', 'time-waster', 'genre', 'fans', '2-and-a-half-star', 'effort', 'really.See', 'also', 'Thin', 'Man', 'films', 'especially', 'Shadow', 'Thin', 'Man']",N/A
300430,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6302182867,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","William Powell and Jean Arthur provided delightful performances as a divorced surgeon (Powell) and mystery writer (Arthur). They got along very well, but the Doctor had not been able to manage living with a woman who involved him in investigating one murder after another. The story starts as she re-enters his life simultaneously suing him for back alimony and declaring that they will re-marry.Of course they are soon in the middle of a murder mystery, and one that has no little danger for Dr. Bradford himself, as he is shot at by a burglar, implicated in a murder, and struck over the head.Murder mysteries in 30s era movies tended to be more intricate and make more sense than they do today. It seems that in the heat of trying to find new twists, current writers often lose all track of common sense when developing their stories. This is one reason I'm so fond of these early movie mysteries. On the other hand, a review of this movie may have been a bad time to make this particular point, as the favored method of murder in the film is impractical and factually flawed. LOLAnother reason to like this movie is the subtle and witty dialogue, an element present in most mystery movies of the era. William Powell in particular made a career of starring in such vehicles. ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" is no disappointment in that regard. Intelligent and surprising jokes abound. You never have to wait long for the next smile or chuckle, even as you feel growing concern over the danger posed by the murderer(s). One joke is contained entirely within a note left by Mrs. Bradford for the Doctor. The director patiently gives the text of the note full screen attention for long enough that even slow readers can read it without hurry, and the punch line on page two is worth the wait. :-)If you like good mysteries and intelligent dialogue, you owe it to yourself to give this film a try.

The stars were beautiful, the costumes more beautiful, the dialogue snappy and the art Deco. Plus, the mystery itself would be a genuine puzzle with a satisfying finish at the 90 yard line. For those of you who have watched and re-watched every Thin Man movie and are longing for more, well this is the film for you.You even get William Powell, as the genial Dr. Bradford. Jean Arthur (at the very top of her game in a perfect role for her) plays his wife, the titular Ex-Mrs. Bradford, who is determined to be just plain Mrs. Bradford again. But does Dr. Bradford want her back? On the plus side she is gorgeous, fun and sports a series of incredible outfits while repeatedly saving Powell's life. On the downside she is slightly fruit loops, constantly in trouble and has an annoying habit of clunking Powell on the noggin at inopportune times. When a race jockey is killed and it looks like the good Doctor did the deed, it's the Ex-Mrs. Bradford who determines he must solve the crime himself, with her assistance of course. The mystery ends, as they always did back in the old days, with all the suspects in one room and Powell explaining who killed who with what and why and how and look out they have a gun!It's all sublime, quite perfect, and a total delight. Most of these newly released archive films (dumped bare bones onto DVD but at least cleanly transferred) are worth seeing, and this one is worth buying. How come they don't make them like this anymore? Could it be so hard, when they made it look so easy?GRADE: A-(Best scene: Arthur's all-gelatin, all-dessert dinner.

300439,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302182867,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","In the wake of THE THIN MAN's dynamite success in 1934, all the studios scrambled like mad to produce similarly-veined pictures. In a neat bit of the serpent swallowing its own tail, William Powell himself was tapped to exploit the manna falling from THE THIN MAN and was cast in 1936's THE EX-MRS. BRADFORD, a terrific and smart screwball murder mystery in its own right. Jean Arthur, fresh off her star-making turn in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, comes on board to play Nora to his Nick Charles.""I don't want to be involved in any more of your cockeyed murder mysteries,"" Dr. Lawrence Bradford warns his ex-wife Paula who one day breezily comes calling (and we'll just ignore that gent she brings who serves Bradford a subpoena for neglecting to pay alimony). But of course that's exactly what happens when a jockey dies during a race and the ex-Mrs. Bradford - mystery writer, she - immediately suspects foul play. Never mind that, initially, no evidence points towards the shady. When he's requested to apply his medical expertise in determining how the jockey really died, Dr. Bradford should've just resigned himself to playing amateur sleuth. That, or agreed to right off take the ""ex"" off the ex-Mrs. Bradford. That's what she was angling for all along.When a corpse is planted on his doorstep and he becomes the cops' primary suspect, Powell has no recourse but to solve the case, eyeball several dodgy characters, and find out whodunit, with Arthur the entire time serving as both his staunchest ally and his most diligent hindrance. But maybe her theory of murder by gelatin isn't as lame as it sounds.In the time honored tradition, events conclude with the rounding up of suspects to a dinner party, at which point the film takes on a rather innovative twist in how it unveils the murderer. That is, unless someone somewhen, before 1936, had already fingered the murderer by way of showing a film (still, it was almost a given that Bradford's in-house film projector would play a key part).Thankfully, there are enough elements here which distinguish THE EX-MRS. BRADFORD from THE THIN MAN. Most pronouncedly, Jean Arthur is delightfully daft, channeling Carole Lombard's distracted Irene Bullock from MY MAN GODFREY more so than Myrna Loy's more reserved Nora Charles. (And, yes, THE EX-MRS. BRADFORD was released before MY MAN GODFREY, but, my God, man, I'm trying to make a point!) Don't get it twisted, though, because regarding the ex-Mrs. Bradford, there's a light on upstairs; One gets the sense that the flightiness is only on the surface. As usual, Arthur's distinctive chirrupy, husky voice lends a charm all of its own, and I could listen to her talk all day. And, as in the Thin Man series, the fun isn't in the murder detection but rather in the playful interactions of the two leads (you can even throw in Eric Blore's deadpan and terribly amusing butler into the mix). Arthur and Powell easily keep things from getting stodgy.

Pictures presents ""EX-MRS BRADFORD"" (1936) (82 min/B&W;) -- Starring: William Powell, Jean Arthur, James Gleason, Eric Blore & Robert ArmstrongDirected by Stephen RobertsRelations between Dr. 'Brad' Bradford (William Powell) and ex-wife Paula (Jean Arthur) are surprisingly romantic. They divorced because Brad hated being dragged into murder mysteries, to which mystery writer Paula is addicted. But through horse trainer Mike North, Brad is embroiled in the case of a jockey who died of ""heart failure"" during a race. As they pursue clues, Paula pursues Brad for remarriage, and assorted hoods pursue the BradfordsWilliam Powell recreates, for RKO, his Nick Charles character, now as Dr. Bradford, M.D. and Jean Arthur substitutes as Nora. How did it work? very well! This film works because Powell and Arthur have terrific chemistry, and a crackerjack good comic-mystery script. The mystery is clever, and the humor urbane and lighthearted.Both actors loved the script and working together.  They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.BIOS:1.

I am so glad I gave it a chance. Jean Arthur is perfect as his mystery writing, always suspicious ex-wife who drops in on him unexpectedly with a man to serve a subpoena because Powell (Dr. Bradford) isn't making his alimony payments. He says he isn't going to pay because she already has 2/3 of the money in California. She invites herself to dinner and during the evening decides that she is going to marry him again. But the doctor has another unexpected visitor that night--a friend, Mr. North,  who is involved in horse racing. The movie had opened with a big splash about a racing jockey who died before his horse could win a big race. Though it was said to be a heart attack, Mr North suspects foul play and asks the doctor to go to the morgue and see what he can find out, thus involving Dr. Bradford in a murder mystery he would rather not get near. His ex-wife is concerned for his safety and the next thing he knows she is moving into his guest room to keep an eye on him. She is also very inclined to get involved in the mystery herself. Though I wouldn't call this a screwball comedy in the strictest sense (whatever that is), it does have elements of that genre along with the mystery around which the story revolves.What is in the envelope Mr. North has mailed to the doctor but addressed to himself?Why does Mr. North call to say he is coming to get it and then never show?Why does the doctor's secretary suddenly leave her job, claiming illness when she obviously is not?Who took the scalpel from the doctor's office that he had used on the dead jockey's autopsy?What is so deadly about gelatin?Why does a corpse show up on the doctor's doorstep?And will the doctor remarry the Ex-Mrs. Bradford?All this and more awaits you in 81 minutes of pure black & white mystery pleasure. Presented in 1.33:1 fullscreen with absolutely NO extras (are we not used to this now with the Warner Archive Collection?), this DVD is printed on demand and is only made to play in ""player only"" models, not DVD Player/recorders. I felt like the images were very sharp, but the print had not been cleaned. There were many specks and flecks on the picture and an occasional blip. The sound was clear and I enjoyed watching it. If you are used to pristine, HD, remastered movies, this may not be quite up to your standard, but I did not feel the minor problems were a distraction to me as I watched. I only pay attention to such things in order to note it in reviews like this.The price at this writing is high and it is less at another website, however, buying from a marketplace seller here on the old Amazon with their minimal shipping was actually less expense than the other website with their inflated shipping.

Only this time, the catch is he's not actually a detective, but a surgeon recently divorced from his crime-writing-novelist wife. The same ex-wife whom the screenplay alludes to earlier ""adventures"" from which Dr. Bradford, or 'Brad' as he's loving called by said former wife, proclaims was the impetus for the divorce.Extraordinarily fun! And a fascinating peek into an actress who could've so easily been 'Mrs. Nick Charles' had history taken a slightly different turn. I'm a fairly new member to the Jean Arthur fan club, having onlyjoined in the past few years. But I'm an ardent member now more than ever. She was just so amazing. Funny, clever, beautiful and so effervescently sexy.Powell and Arthur make for an incredibly enjoyable couple, each playing to their strengths; and quite noticeably, exposing an improvement to the socialite-detective dynamic that was possible. Especially when comparing the more constrained Myrna Loy performances in The Thin Man series. It's clear Loy tempered the comedic energy that would have produced a funnier product as evidenced in this one film.Again, I like to imagine how things would've turned out had Jean been tagged as Nora Charles - it really makes for fascinating speculation. And this film gives us a small taste of what I honestly believe would've been a wondrous dish.Movie Note:- Not sure if all versions of this film have the apparent inconsistent audio issues as the Warner Archive disc I purchased.

The curious thing is this cheap production is still making someone money nearly 80 years later. I bought it for Jean Arthur, an actress of great comic talents. She is fun to watch in this and, in some ways, this film provides an insight into the enormous box-office appeal she commanded in her day. There were plenty of screwball comediennes, but there is a mix of the sympathetic, the sceptical and the odd-ball in her style that is distinctive and appealing -- she is never just one of these things at any moment, but all three are in play. Interesting here, even though the story vehicle is pretty weak. Her co-star William Powell churned out a whole series of Thin Man films of this ilk with the wonderful Myrna Loy. I wonder whether this was meant to be another, but she wasn't available. I find Powell does not travel well these days -- his sort of deadpan, urbane humour was done better by others, starting with Cary Grant. There is probably enough here for Arthur fans to justify the purchase, but the film cannot hold a candle to More The Merrier or a dozen others for which she is famous.",3,Knocked out,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1265,"['image', 'probably', 'knocked', 'out', 'film', 'fortnight', 'back', 'when', 'movie-goers', 'went', 'flicks', 'twice', 'week', 'studios', 'had', 'keep', 'product', 'pouring', 'out', 'curious', 'thing', 'cheap', 'production', 'still', 'making', 'someone', 'money', 'nearly', '80', 'years', 'later', 'bought', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'actress', 'great', 'comic', 'talents', 'fun', 'watch', 'ways', 'film', 'insight', 'enormous', 'box-office', 'appeal', 'commanded', 'day', 'were', 'plenty', 'screwball', 'comediennes', 'mix', 'sympathetic', 'sceptical', 'odd-ball', 'style', 'distinctive', 'appealing', 'never', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'moment', 'three', 'are', 'play', 'Interesting', 'here', 'even', 'story', 'vehicle', 'pretty', 'weak', 'co-star', 'William', 'Powell', 'churned', 'out', 'whole', 'series', 'Thin', 'Man', 'films', 'ilk', 'wonderful', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'wonder', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'find', 'Powell', 'not', 'travel', 'well', 'days', 'sort', 'deadpan', 'urbane', 'humour', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'others', 'starting', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'probably', 'enough', 'here', 'Arthur', 'fans', 'justify', 'purchase', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'More', 'Merrier', 'dozen', 'others', 'famous']",N/A
