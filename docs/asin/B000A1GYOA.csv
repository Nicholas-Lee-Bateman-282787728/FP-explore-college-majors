Poirot moves to solve the case in a lineal, step by step fashion. A young woman asks Poirot to find out if her mother, who was hanged for poisoning her husband, the young woman's father, did so. There are five suspects who may have committed the murder, if the husband did not commit suicide, as her mother claims. Poirot interviews each of the five people, gathers information, and deduces what actually occurred from what he hears. Viewers who pay close attention to the five versions of what occurred will see the clues.

918404,A39675KXEV8UK8,B000A1GYOA,Kyle Shultz,"[9, 10]","""Five Little Pigs"" has always been among my favorite Poirot adventures, mainly because of its excellent premise. Poirot is attempting to solve a murder which occurred fourteen years before, resulting in the execution of a young woman. There are no cigar ashes, no footprints, no concrete clues of any kind to go by. Instead, Poirot is forced to rely entirely on his methods of probing into the psychology of his suspects; always a treat for the reader/viewer. And this case certainly has plenty of psychology - all his five suspects have some secret that needs ferreting out and which may or may not have any bearing on the murder itself. All very enjoyable.That being said, I was rather disappointed in this TV adaptation in some respects. The only way in which it falls short of the standard I have come to respect from the makers of the Poirot series is in the differences between the book and the movie. I guess the producers thought there was just too much heterosexual romance going on in the original story. (We can't have that, can we?) Thus, Philip Blake is no longer the smouldering, jilted lover of Caroline Crayle - he is the smouldering, jealous lover of Amius Crayle. And Caroline Crayle, in a move which jarringly contradicts Christie's portrayal of her character, does not reject the advances of a man who tries to take advantage of her at a time when her marriage is threatened, but seeks him out in order to seduce him - in other words, committing the same act of unfaithfulness that she condemns in her husband. Plus, the flashback scenes of the ""deep friendship"" between Amius and Phillip were frankly quite distasteful. Caroline thus comes across as being far less admirable. And are we supposed to feel sorry for Phillip? No thanks.This film is still definitely worth watching, but it's not quite the best of the newer Poirot films. Fans will enjoy it, but take my advice and read the book first, if you haven't already - or listen to the audio drama with John Moffatt.",3,"Nicely done, but flawed",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1991,"['Five', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Poirot', 'adventures', 'mainly', 'excellent', 'premise', 'Poirot', 'attempting', 'solve', 'murder', 'occurred', 'fourteen', 'years', 'resulting', 'execution', 'young', 'woman', 'are', 'cigar', 'ashes', 'footprints', 'concrete', 'clues', 'kind', 'go', 'Instead', 'Poirot', 'forced', 'rely', 'entirely', 'methods', 'probing', 'psychology', 'suspects', 'always', 'treat', 'reader/viewer', 'case', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'psychology', 'five', 'suspects', 'have', 'secret', 'ferreting', 'out', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'bearing', 'murder', 'very', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'respects', 'only', 'way', 'short', 'standard', 'have', 'come', 'respect', 'makers', 'Poirot', 'series', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'guess', 'producers', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'heterosexual', 'romance', 'going', 'original', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'can', 'Thus', 'Philip', 'Blake', 'no', 'longer', 'smouldering', 'jilted', 'lover', 'Caroline', 'Crayle', 'smouldering', 'jealous', 'lover', 'Amius', 'Crayle', 'Caroline', 'Crayle', 'move', 'jarringly', 'Christie', 'portrayal', 'character', 'not', 'reject', 'advances', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'time', 'when', 'marriage', 'threatened', 'out', 'order', 'seduce', 'other', 'words', 'committing', 'same', 'act', 'unfaithfulness', 'husband', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'deep', 'friendship', 'Amius', 'Phillip', 'were', 'frankly', 'quite', 'distasteful', 'Caroline', 'thus', 'across', 'being', 'far', 'less', 'admirable', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Phillip', 'No', 'thanks.This', 'film', 'still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'quite', 'best', 'newer', 'Poirot', 'films', 'Fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'take', 'advice', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'listen', 'audio', 'drama', 'John', 'Moffatt']",Agatha Christie's Poirot: Five Little Pigs
918405,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000A1GYOA,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Five Little Pigs"", based on Agatha Christie's 1942 novel, is the first film in Series 9 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", which originally aired in 2003. It opens with the execution of Caroline Crale (Rachael Stirling) for the murder of her husband, the painter Amyas Crale (Aiden Gillen). Fourteen years later, their daughter Lucy (Aimee Mullins) asks Poirot to investigate the case. Her mother assured her that she was innocent. Lucy would like to know the truth. There were five guests at the Crale home the weekend that Amyas died, and therefore five suspects: Amyas' best friend Philip Blake (Toby Stephens), neighbor and Philip's brother Meredith (Marc Warren), Amyas' young mistress and subject of his most recent painting Elsa Greer (Julie Cox), Caroline's sister Angela (Sophie Winkleman), and Angela's tutor Miss Williams (Gemma Jones).Poirot interviews the suspects, 14 years after the fact, in order to piece together the events of that fateful day. Most of the witnesses had motive to murder Amyas Crale, but most are confident in Caroline's guilt. Poirot begins to doubt it, however. This is a good mystery with a strong cast, but the film's structure is so simple that it is flat. Poirot simply interviews each witness, so we see the same events recounted from different points of view, before gathering everyone together to announce his conclusion. Without Hastings or Miss Lemon or Inspector Japp, there is nothing to add interest while Poirot shuffles from interview to interview. Poirot's warmth and humor have little opportunity to express themselves, while his fussiness and self-righteousness remain.This was the year that the show's producers made notable changes: Poirot's mustache coiffure has changed from cute-comical to sinister-comical, and David Suchet's interpretation of his mannerism is a little different in conversation. The Deco title sequence is gone. The score is a little distracting. I favor the lighter, more amiable, modernist Poirot. But the cast and plot are good, even if Philip Jackson breaks down in a fit of grief that is not quite believable at one point, and his character has been altered in a way that does nothing to serve the story. Bonus features on the A&E; 2004 DVD are short text bios of Agatha Christie, David Suchet, and Hercule Poirot.

While part of the plot involves infidelity, Christie NEVER dwells on ""bedroom"" scenes.  These, however, continue to show up in the new adaptations, which make it uncomfortable at best to watch ourselves, let alone with our children.  Christie communicated quite clearly when infidelity and/or immorality were going on without resorting to steamy scenes--the screenwriters need to do the same.WARNING: SPOILERI could not believe it when Philip confessed to being Amyas' lover.  This seemed way out of character for Christie to have a gay relationship going on.  I ran in and pulled my book off the shelf, and--sure enough--there is no such thing.  Philip was turned down by Carolyn because she loved her husband, not Philip turning down Carolyn because HE loved her husband.  Ridiculous.

It showcases her gift for creating unlikable characters - and making you care about them! The cast of &#8220;Five Little Pigs&#8221; had great chemistry and captured this beautifully. What&#8217;s more, there were only deviations from the book that I noticed (spoiler alert!): in the book, Caroline dies in prison, but in the movie she&#8217;s hanged; instead of being in love with Caroline, as in the book, Philip Blake is in love with Amyas; finally, there was a scene added to the end of the movie where Carla points a gun at Elsa and threatens to kill her.Overall, these changes did not alter the story too much. The murderer was still the same person, and the movie had the same feeling as the book.
