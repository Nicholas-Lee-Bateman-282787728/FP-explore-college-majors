360898,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,6303155030,Brett Johnson,"[4, 18]","There certainly are flashes of brilliance in &quot;I'll Do Anything&quot;.  It conjures up some wicked satire and includes an extremely talented cast.  However, this is a film whose flaws far outweigh its high points.Nick Nolte plays Matt, a Hollywood actor who has gotten a few decent roles but whose current career is struggling.  Tracy Ullman is hilarious as his estranged wife, Beth.  Together they are the parents of a young daughter named Jeannie (Whittni Wright).  Matt has moved on with his life and, being the caring father that he is,  has little interest in ever seeing his daughter.  It's been two years since he last saw her, when he gets a call from Beth.  She needs him to come out and take Jeannie back to Hollywood for a few weeks.  Once Matt gets there, however, he finds out that Beth is actually going to prison for several years and now he is solely responsible for taking care of their daughter.So not even 30 minutes into the movie, Tracy Ullman's character is already gone.  As if that's not bad enough, look at this absolutely amazing list of actors who have about five minutes or less of screen time:  Joely Fisher, Vicki Lewis, Anne Heche, Ian McKellen, Jake Busey, Rosie O'Donnell and even Woody Harrelson.  What in the world were they thinking by showing up glimpses of all these people without fleshing out any of their characters?!!That's not the worst part though.  Both the father and daughter characters are extremely unlikable.  Extremely.  Matt Hobbs is a self-absorbed jerk throughout the entire film.  His daughter is even worse.  In fact, I have been racking my brains to come up with a child in a movie I have disliked more.  So far, I haven't been able to come up with one.  Jeannie is one of the most shrill, spoiled and obnoxious little girls ever put on film.  This all continues up until the last five minutes of the movie.  Then, completely out of the blue, both of these characters turn on a dime and become very charming and loving.  Sorry, but their transformation was too quick for me to buy.Along the way, James Brooks (writer/director) is at least able to give us some funny moments.  Once Ullman's character is gotten rid of, the humor baton is passed to Julie Kavner.  Her character, Nan, has this uncanny ability to always tell people the brutal truth.  She works for Burke (Albert Brooks), an egotistical movie producer who always seems to say and do the wrong thing.  Combine Nan's scathing honesty with Burke's chronic bad manners and you get a cute couple.With a different father and daughter, &quot;I'll Do Anything&quot; could have been a nice little sleeper.  However, it is unable to overcome the unappealing attitudes of Matt and Jeannie.",2,A good idea was in there somewhere.,1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,2702,"['certainly', 'are', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Do', 'Anything', 'quot', 'up', 'wicked', 'satire', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'However', 'film', 'flaws', 'far', 'outweigh', 'high', 'points.Nick', 'Nolte', 'Matt', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'who', 'gotten', 'few', 'decent', 'roles', 'current', 'career', 'struggling', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'hilarious', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Together', 'are', 'parents', 'young', 'daughter', 'named', 'Jeannie', 'Whittni', 'Wright', 'Matt', 'moved', 'life', 'being', 'caring', 'father', 'little', 'interest', 'ever', 'seeing', 'daughter', 'been', 'two', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'when', 'call', 'Beth', 'come', 'out', 'take', 'Jeannie', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'few', 'weeks', 'Once', 'Matt', 'there', 'however', 'out', 'Beth', 'actually', 'going', 'prison', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'solely', 'responsible', 'taking', 'care', 'daughter.So', 'not', 'even', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'character', 'already', 'gone', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'look', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'list', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'five', 'minutes', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'Joely', 'Fisher', 'Vicki', 'Lewis', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'even', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'What', 'world', 'were', 'thinking', 'showing', 'up', 'glimpses', 'people', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'not', 'worst', 'part', 'father', 'daughter', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'unlikable', 'Extremely', 'Matt', 'Hobbs', 'self-absorbed', 'jerk', 'entire', 'film', 'daughter', 'even', 'worse', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'racking', 'brains', 'come', 'up', 'child', 'movie', 'have', 'disliked', 'more', 'So', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'Jeannie', 'one', 'most', 'shrill', 'spoiled', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'girls', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'up', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Then', 'completely', 'blue', 'characters', 'turn', 'dime', 'become', 'very', 'charming', 'loving', 'Sorry', 'transformation', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'buy.Along', 'way', 'James', 'Brooks', 'writer/director', 'least', 'able', 'give', 'funny', 'moments', 'Once', 'Ullman', 'character', 'gotten', 'rid', 'humor', 'baton', 'passed', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'character', 'Nan', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'always', 'tell', 'people', 'brutal', 'truth', 'Burke', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'egotistical', 'movie', 'producer', 'who', 'always', 'say', 'do', 'wrong', 'thing', 'Combine', 'Nan', 'scathing', 'honesty', 'Burke', 'chronic', 'bad', 'manners', 'get', 'cute', 'couple.With', 'different', 'father', 'daughter', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Do', 'Anything', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'little', 'sleeper', 'However', 'unable', 'overcome', 'unappealing', 'attitudes', 'Matt', 'Jeannie']",I'll Do Anything VHS

The press said she's five, but she plays as an adult teenage type of precocious brat who really irritated.  She looked like a teenager with a small body.  The whole movie seemed slightly disconnected, as if it couldn't make up its mind where it was going.  This was supposed to have been a musical, but they cut all the songs out.  Maybe that's why it seems so choppy.  Nobody seems to know who they really are.  And Nolte looked strange.  Maybe he'd had some work done on his face.  He was somewhat too old for this part.  Albert Brooks gruffed up his voice for his role, which didn't sound right.  The two female leads were just plain quirky.  One of the worst movies that I saw from '94.

However, I have to say that this is the worst acting I have ever seen from his any other movies. Very often, it was awkard and unnatural. Another  problem is other supporting actresses and actors. They don't act like real.  They acted like they were just out  from acting school. The whole plot is  not really well coordinated (I won't say anything about it, since it is  going to be a spoiler). The movie was  boring to watch. If there is a  reason why I hung  on till the end, it was just to see how it ended (and  the thought that I paid money for this movie). As a plus, you can somehow  get  some slightest idea of what is going on behind making movies  (selection of actors/acresses/kids). There a few nice phrases which come  out of Nolte.
