It's short at 63 min. & the video quality doesn't match up to their later releases(we are going back almost 30 years here!). But if you're a Rush affectionado you're going to like the fear trilogy, the medleys, & just the fact it's an early 1980's snapshot of this great band. Geddy still has his youthful voice(I,for one, have to say I like his more mature voice as well)I just wish it was twice as long(or 3x,4x,etc longer).",4,A 1980's Treat for Rush Fans,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,506,"['were', 'only', 'going', 'buy', '1', '2', 'Rush', 'dvds', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'buy', 'short', '63', 'min', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'later', 'releases', 'are', 'going', 'back', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'here', ""'re"", 'Rush', 'affectionado', ""'re"", 'going', 'like', 'fear', 'trilogy', 'medleys', 'just', 'fact', 'early', '1980', 'snapshot', 'great', 'band', 'Geddy', 'still', 'youthful', 'voice', 'one', 'have', 'say', 'more', 'mature', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'twice', 'as', 'long', '3x,4x', 'etc', 'longer']",N/A

It could have been automatic Gold or Platinum for sure at the time and sold on tape and vinyl since compact discs were just starting. This show is perfect from start to finish. You get 3 ""Fear"" songs an incredible version of The Spirit of Radio with 3 Stooges Intro, Vital Signs, and other great classic Rush tunes with Rush playing at their peak. It would have been ideal if Mercury had added a few songs to this disc like Red Lenses/Drum solo to it so they could have attracted some different people. Also Between The Wheels and Afterimage live would have been sweet as well. All things said, this is worth the 10 bucks to get. The sound alone crushes Rio, R30, and S&A Live.",5,Honestly...Their Best Concert CD Next To Exit Stage Left...,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,795,"['What', 'mess', 'Mercury', 'Records', 'CD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'back', '1986', 'when', 'VHS', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'automatic', 'Gold', 'Platinum', 'sure', 'time', 'sold', 'tape', 'vinyl', 'compact', 'discs', 'were', 'just', 'starting', 'show', 'perfect', 'start', 'finish', 'get', '3', 'Fear', 'songs', 'incredible', 'version', 'Spirit', 'Radio', '3', 'Stooges', 'Intro', 'Vital', 'Signs', 'other', 'great', 'classic', 'Rush', 'tunes', 'Rush', 'playing', 'peak', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'Mercury', 'had', 'added', 'few', 'songs', 'disc', 'Red', 'Lenses/Drum', 'solo', 'could', 'have', 'attracted', 'different', 'people', 'Also', 'Wheels', 'Afterimage', 'live', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sweet', 'as', 'well', 'things', 'said', '10', 'bucks', 'get', 'sound', 'alone', 'Rio', 'R30', 'S', 'A', 'Live']",N/A
1049535,AVQJD41PLPOOQ,B000MR8SN2,Eric F.,"[21, 23]","When I was in college, this was the first (and favorite) concert video I owned.  Years later, I (very stupidly) sold it.  Recently, I spend nearly a year waiting for a used VHS copy to become available on [...] for a reasonable price, and finally got it.  Then, wouldn't you know it, the concert finally becomes available on DVD individually, without having to buy EXIT...STAGE LEFT and A SHOW OF HANDS with it.This is my favorite RUSH video concert for several reasons.  For one thing, I enjoy concerts that are videotaped rather than filmed.  It also captures Rush (in my opinion) at their golden moments in the 1980's, when their two previous albums, Moving Pictures and Signals had put them at the top of their fame.  From 1981 through 1986, Rush was known for always opening their shows with ""Spirit of Radio"" and this one doesn't disappoint.  It also includes the ""Fear"" trilogy of ""The Enemy Within"", ""The Weapon"" and ""Witchunt"" and the popular instrumental, ""YYZ"".I deduct one star because it's disappointing that after more than two decades, the DVD show is still only 69 minutes long, without more of the complete show offered to the fans.",4,RUSH at their 80's peak!,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1149,"['When', 'was', 'college', 'was', 'first', 'favorite', 'concert', 'video', 'owned', 'Years', 'later', 'very', 'stupidly', 'sold', 'Recently', 'spend', 'nearly', 'year', 'waiting', 'used', 'VHS', 'copy', 'become', 'available', '[', ']', 'reasonable', 'price', 'finally', 'got', 'Then', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'concert', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'individually', 'having', 'buy', 'EXIT', 'STAGE', 'LEFT', 'A', 'SHOW', 'OF', 'HANDS', 'it.This', 'favorite', 'RUSH', 'video', 'concert', 'several', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'concerts', 'are', 'rather', 'filmed', 'also', 'Rush', 'opinion', 'golden', 'moments', '1980', 'when', 'two', 'previous', 'albums', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'Signals', 'had', 'put', 'top', 'fame', '1981', '1986', 'Rush', 'was', 'known', 'always', 'opening', 'shows', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'one', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'also', 'Fear', 'trilogy', 'Enemy', 'Within', 'Weapon', 'Witchunt', 'popular', 'instrumental', 'YYZ', '.I', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'disappointing', 'more', 'two', 'decades', 'DVD', 'show', 'still', 'only', '69', 'minutes', 'long', 'more', 'complete', 'show', 'offered', 'fans']",N/A

Alvi,"[1, 1]","I've been a Rush fan for about 35 years, and because I grew up with Rush, I gravitate much more towards the older material which connects me to the many powerful memories of my youth.  From that standpoint, this 1984 concert is ideal, and Rush happened to be near their energetic and creative peak back then too.  As a result, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and would say it's a must for any old-school Rush fan.  The drawbacks, noted by other reviewers, are that this isn't a full concert so it's somewhat short, there's no drum solo, and the camera work and video quality are merely tolerable (though the sound is pretty good), so I'll deduct a star for that.",4,"Great, minus a few things",1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,660,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Rush', 'fan', '35', 'years', 'grew', 'up', 'Rush', 'gravitate', 'much', 'more', 'older', 'material', 'many', 'powerful', 'memories', 'youth', 'standpoint', '1984', 'concert', 'ideal', 'Rush', 'happened', 'be', 'energetic', 'creative', 'peak', 'back', 'then', 'too', 'result', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'must', 'old-school', 'Rush', 'fan', 'drawbacks', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'full', 'concert', 'somewhat', 'short', 'drum', 'solo', 'camera', 'work', 'video', 'quality', 'are', 'merely', 'tolerable', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', ""'ll"", 'deduct', 'star']",N/A

I could hear the guitars at all times and nothing was drowned out. The equipment they use and the clothes they are wearing are really a time capsule of 1984!

I hadn't watched the tape in many years, and when I saw it for sale on DVD, I decided to purchase it.  I certainly brings back memories of my college days, when Rush and myself were much younger.
