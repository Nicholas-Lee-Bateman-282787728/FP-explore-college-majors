1314847,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00308BAXK,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[6, 6]","Faith Based Filming has come a long way toward taking their place alongside typical Hollywood flicks. It is shown to be a lower budget production from viewing the bonus behind the scenes material, where cast double as filming assistants but the job gets done, and done well. In this case it tells a TRUE story, perhaps somewhat altered to get years down to minutes, but the drama is certainly encapsulated. It is the story of Amy Newhouse, her battle with cancer, the ups and downs, and the faith and hope that she was able to not only keep herself, but pass along to others during the ordeal.What a perfect choice it was to cast Anne Underwood as Amy. She is joy personified. Her bubbly personality is contagious right off the screen. She is only the first of truly believable characters in this film. Another that must be mentioned is Paul Willis playing a teen with punk hair. I'm a retired teacher, and believe me when I say these two were honestly teen-realistic. I've taught hundreds like them.Bradley Dorsey as Tyler is the love angle in Amy's life. He looks the part (so young) of a lovesick teen boy until you see Behind the Scenes and see him as director (also writer, producer, editor, and who knows what else. There is a wait, but in Dec 2012, his new film is to be released which he does many roles again including lead, joined by Della Reese and Michael Gross. There's a step up.While this is definitely faith based, it is not Christianity in your face, unless you take the role of Amy to heart, which you should, because she was a teenage on-fire Christian and planning for the mission field. God had a different story in mind. Watch this film and see it revealed. Well done Mr. Dorsey, cast and crew.PureFlix and Dove Approved family viewing",5,Powerful film sometimes comical sometimes heart wrenching,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1757,"['Faith', 'Based', 'Filming', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'taking', 'place', 'alongside', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'shown', 'be', 'lower', 'budget', 'production', 'viewing', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'material', 'where', 'cast', 'double', 'filming', 'assistants', 'job', 'done', 'done', 'well', 'case', 'TRUE', 'story', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'altered', 'get', 'years', 'down', 'minutes', 'drama', 'certainly', 'encapsulated', 'story', 'Amy', 'Newhouse', 'battle', 'cancer', 'ups', 'downs', 'faith', 'hope', 'was', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'herself', 'pass', 'others', 'ordeal.What', 'perfect', 'choice', 'was', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Underwood', 'Amy', 'joy', 'personified', 'bubbly', 'personality', 'contagious', 'right', 'screen', 'only', 'first', 'truly', 'believable', 'characters', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Paul', 'Willis', 'playing', 'teen', 'punk', 'hair', ""'m"", 'retired', 'teacher', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'two', 'were', 'honestly', 'teen-realistic', ""'ve"", 'taught', 'hundreds', 'them.Bradley', 'Dorsey', 'Tyler', 'love', 'angle', 'Amy', 'life', 'part', 'so', 'young', 'lovesick', 'teen', 'boy', 'see', 'Scenes', 'see', 'director', 'also', 'writer', 'producer', 'editor', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'wait', 'Dec', '2012', 'new', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'many', 'roles', 'again', 'including', 'lead', 'joined', 'Della', 'Reese', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'step', 'definitely', 'faith', 'based', 'not', 'Christianity', 'face', 'take', 'role', 'Amy', 'heart', 'should', 'was', 'teenage', 'on-fire', 'Christian', 'planning', 'mission', 'field', 'God', 'had', 'different', 'story', 'mind', 'Watch', 'film', 'see', 'revealed', 'Well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Dorsey', 'cast', 'crew.PureFlix', 'Dove', 'Approved', 'family', 'viewing']",A Greater Yes

For one thing The actors Who are WELL  KNOWN  Aren't afraid To be( BLack Listed In Hollywood)  New Comers, These People really put Their Hearts into it! I know People Especially with Families really like these  movie! It is about REAL LIFE Situations ! When You have to depend On Something (besides Yourself,  You NEED  Faith! ) I think the days when the violence & sex have been so popular ,Now You don't have to watch it on the screen when it's happening ALL Around Us (in Real Life) it is just reminding Us of Every day Life .The criminals rights are being  abused, While the victims lives & Their Families are left in Ruins ! There are some  well known actors now staring  in These Movies ! For Example ,Kevin Sorbo, John Ratzenger  , (What If)...  John Schneider ,(Octobers' Baby,WWJD  Hidden Secrets , You remember"" Dukes of Hazard "" there are others,  ""Casting Crowns""  song based entertainers are  involved in several of these movies ....There are More actors(Of Course, Kirk Cameron  (Bosom Buddies) Fire  Proof ,He has a New Movie out  Susan Howard (Star Track,Dallas) Dean Cain ,Etc.
