Shirley Booth is absolutely letter perfect in her performance....there is not a single moment of less than perfect pitch as far as where she needs to bring her character at any given moment in the film. I always found Burt Lancaster to be a very mannered actor, and, while he doesn't hurt the film by any means, he makes me wonder what the film would have been with someone like Ralph Bellamy in the role of Doc. I understand the need for box office draw and that is an unfortunate situation in film even to this day. Shirley Booth is so good that she elevates Lancaster.

291265,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6302023807,Gregor von Kallahann,"[6, 8]","The film version of William Inge's COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA was released the year of my birth (1952)--and yes, that really was another era.  The Hayes code was still in effect, and even married couples had to sleep in twin beds.  For all that, however, a certain frankness was creeping into the American cinema.  Alcoholism, as a theme, had been already addressed successfully in LOST WEEKEND some seven years prior.  And themes of pre-marital sex and illegitimacy were at least occasionally addressed (think of Greer Garson's classic 1941 film BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST) or at least hinted at.By today's standards, COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA is not especially bold.  Those familiar with the stage version might also cite it as an example of the kinds of coy compromises Hollywood had to make in order to get ""serious drama"" onto film at all.  (The comparison to the stage play serves as proof positive  that ""mature drama"" onscreen was still relatively ""immature"" in comparison to the stage or to literature.  Frumpy housewife Lola Delaney (Academy Award winner Shirley Booth) was allowed to gaze a little more longingly at muscular young men in the stage version, without it necessarily marking her as the slut her husband cruelly accuses her of being in a drunken rage.In the film version, she looks on wistfully as her young boarder Marie (Terry Moore) and her athlete boyfriend (Richard Jaeckel) flirt and kiss.  It is, at worst, a reminder of her own lost youth.  (Well, actually, Lola's reaction during the ""life drawing"" scene suggests more than a maternal interest, but the play is quite a bit more open about her flirtatious nature.)It's hard to say though if the film would have been much better if it had been more faithful to the stage play.  As others have pointed out, enough of the original dialog and storyline is included to still make quite a powerful statement. And it IS true that most changes are relatively minor. (The screenwriters in fact wisely, after including the postman interchange, dropped a similar one with the milkman).  Perhaps the only baffling alteration is the filmmakers' decision to make Marie only a very new tenent in the Delaney household.  The play has her already established as a de facto part of the family and makes Doc Delaney's obviously complex feelings toward his young boarder (paternal protectiveness compounded with a certain erotic longing) ring all the more true.In fact, when in the movie, the Delaney's receive a letter from the now-married Marie stating how she appreciated Doc's concern about the caddish young athlete who might have won her favor, one has to wonder when, exactly, did he ever have the chance to make those sentiments known.Stage plays have always been one of the most difficult source materials for filmmakers to adapt.  (How do you ""open up"" the thing and get it out of those damn four walls?).  In the 50s, the process was even more complicated due to the stringent codes on the film industry.  COME BACK LITTLE SHEBA was a remarkable achievement for 1952, both in terms of its relative candor and the fact that it doesn't seem overly ""stagey.""  Add to that Shirley Booth's performance (as well as the rest of the remarkable cast, including the often underrated performance of Burt Lancaster) and you've got a period classic.  That may not be the same as a cinematic masterpiece, but they came as close as the times would permit them.",4,A Classic Of Its Era,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,3406,"['film', 'version', 'William', 'Inge', 'COME', 'BACK', 'LITTLE', 'SHEBA', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'birth', '1952', 'yes', 'really', 'was', 'era', 'Hayes', 'code', 'was', 'still', 'effect', 'even', 'married', 'couples', 'had', 'sleep', 'twin', 'beds', 'however', 'certain', 'frankness', 'was', 'creeping', 'American', 'cinema', 'Alcoholism', 'theme', 'had', 'been', 'already', 'addressed', 'successfully', 'LOST', 'WEEKEND', 'seven', 'years', 'prior', 'themes', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'illegitimacy', 'were', 'least', 'occasionally', 'addressed', 'think', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'classic', '1941', 'film', 'BLOSSOMS', 'IN', 'THE', 'DUST', 'least', 'hinted', 'at.By', 'today', 'standards', 'COME', 'BACK', 'LITTLE', 'SHEBA', 'not', 'especially', 'bold', 'familiar', 'stage', 'version', 'might', 'also', 'cite', 'example', 'kinds', 'coy', 'compromises', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'make', 'order', 'get', 'serious', 'drama', 'film', 'comparison', 'stage', 'play', 'proof', 'positive', 'mature', 'drama', 'onscreen', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'immature', 'comparison', 'stage', 'literature', 'Frumpy', 'housewife', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'was', 'allowed', 'gaze', 'little', 'more', 'longingly', 'muscular', 'young', 'men', 'stage', 'version', 'necessarily', 'marking', 'slut', 'husband', 'cruelly', 'being', 'drunken', 'rage.In', 'film', 'version', 'wistfully', 'young', 'boarder', 'Marie', 'Terry', 'Moore', 'athlete', 'boyfriend', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'flirt', 'kiss', 'worst', 'reminder', 'own', 'lost', 'youth', 'Well', 'actually', 'Lola', 'reaction', 'life', 'drawing', 'scene', 'more', 'maternal', 'interest', 'play', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'open', 'flirtatious', 'nature', 'hard', 'say', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'faithful', 'stage', 'play', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'enough', 'original', 'dialog', 'storyline', 'included', 'still', 'make', 'quite', 'powerful', 'statement', 'true', 'most', 'changes', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'screenwriters', 'fact', 'wisely', 'including', 'postman', 'interchange', 'dropped', 'similar', 'one', 'milkman', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'baffling', 'alteration', 'filmmakers', 'decision', 'make', 'Marie', 'only', 'very', 'new', 'tenent', 'Delaney', 'household', 'play', 'already', 'established', 'de', 'facto', 'part', 'family', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'obviously', 'complex', 'feelings', 'young', 'boarder', 'paternal', 'protectiveness', 'compounded', 'certain', 'erotic', 'longing', 'ring', 'more', 'true.In', 'fact', 'when', 'movie', 'Delaney', 'receive', 'letter', 'now-married', 'Marie', 'stating', 'how', 'appreciated', 'Doc', 'concern', 'caddish', 'young', 'athlete', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'won', 'favor', 'one', 'wonder', 'when', 'exactly', 'did', 'ever', 'have', 'chance', 'make', 'sentiments', 'known.Stage', 'plays', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'source', 'materials', 'filmmakers', 'adapt', 'How', 'do', 'open', 'up', 'thing', 'get', 'damn', 'four', 'walls', '50s', 'process', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'due', 'stringent', 'codes', 'film', 'industry', 'COME', 'BACK', 'LITTLE', 'SHEBA', 'was', 'remarkable', 'achievement', '1952', 'terms', 'relative', 'candor', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'overly', 'stagey', 'Add', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'including', 'often', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', ""'ve"", 'got', 'period', 'classic', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'came', 'as', 'close', 'times', 'would', 'permit']",N/A

Unlike two other Hollywood filmings of Inge plays; ""Picnin"", and ""Bus Stop"", ""Come Back Little Sheba"", finds little reason to expand its horizons for film's sake, and sticks close to the drawing board, concentrating on the subtle, brewing drama that finally erupts in an angry alcoholic's rage. Lancaster's transition from devoted Alcoholics Anonymous member to raving lunatic is superb, and the two young supporting players, Terry Moore and Richard Jaeckel, are surprsingly deft and accomplished as teens in love, in contrast to the passive and hardened relationship of the middle-agers. Shirley Booth delivers a dazzling, emotionally engulfing portrait of a woman clutching love, her borderline manic character is genuinely empathetic. The only problem, and one that occurs to me every time I read the play, is the suggestion that a kitchen knife holds the answer to the fate of the missing dog, Sheba.

Lancaster is excellent as the husband who tries to love his unkempt wife but can't face the real issues.

291274,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302023807,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 8]","Come Back, Little Sheba stands as a fine work of art by director Daniel Mann. The story takes place in the Delaney household. The Delaneys suffer relatively silently from the deep pain and despair that they feel over Mr. Delaney, or ""Doc,"" as his wife Lola calls him, never finishing medical school and Lola Delaney not being the ""model"" housewife they both wish she were. Burt Lancaster turns in a tremendous performance as ""Doc"" Delaney, the bitter medical school dropout who blames his wife for his personal failings which include alcoholism and an extremely callous personality. Moreover, there's no secret why Shirley Booth won her Oscar for Best Actress of 1952 for her role as Lola Delaney. Her performance commands your attention as she masterfully portrays the character of Lola Delaney struggling with her own issues while trying to keep their marriage as stable as possible.Unfortunately for the Delaneys, their fragile world is turned upside down when they rent a room to young college student Marie Buckholder, who stirs feelings of true passion in Mr. Delaney and motherly feelings in Lola Delaney. Eventually the Delaneys must confront their true yet previously unacknowledged feelings not just within themselves but also to each other. They try to deal with the pain of their rather serious issues resulting in their lives not working out the way they hoped it would. Lola Delaney has the extra burden of having to accept the loss of their dog Sheba; Lola had been very attached to Sheba who represented for her the child she never had. In addition, all this takes place as Marie, the young boarder for whom ""Doc"" develops feelings, enjoys her youth as she flirts with a muscle boy and studies at a nearby university.Will Marie and ""Doc"" Delaney ever share romantic time together? Will the Delaneys deal successfully with their problems? Can ""Doc"" Delaney stay away from drink when the going gets rough as he realizes that Marie cannot really replace his dowdy and aging wife Lola? What might happen if he did revert to drinking again? Will Sheba be found and returned to Lola Delaney? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out!Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth portray Doc Delaney and Lola Delaney with a great deal of sensitivity; they throw themselves into their acting roles do deeply that you will be convinced by their acting every step of the way through the picture. Burt Lancaster's acting in particular leaves you on the edge of your seat at all the right moments during this film. Moreover, Terry Moore positively shines as the young Marie Buckholder who makes ""Doc"" Delaney (or, Mr. Delaney) experience romantic passion for the first time in many years.The choreography exceeds my expectations with many characters moving about the screen in several scenes, all of them doing what they were directed to do so well at all times. The cinematography reflects good judgment; the camera gets moved about very deftly by Daniel Mann and his crew to portray the exact image and conjure up the precise emotions they want their audience to experience at all times.Unfortunately, the DVD comes without any extras. The most you get is a scene selection feature which of course is standard on just about all commercially released DVDs of today. The movie stands so strong, however, that is disappointment is comparatively minor and I will only take off one star for this problem to make this a four star DVD review.I highly recommend this film for classic movie buffs and people who enjoy superlative dramatic performances.",4,Lost dreams and failed ambitions...,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,3563,"['Come', 'Back', 'Little', 'Sheba', 'fine', 'work', 'art', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Mann', 'story', 'place', 'Delaney', 'household', 'Delaneys', 'suffer', 'relatively', 'silently', 'deep', 'pain', 'despair', 'feel', 'Mr.', 'Delaney', 'Doc', 'wife', 'Lola', 'never', 'finishing', 'medical', 'school', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'not', 'being', 'model', 'housewife', 'wish', 'were', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'bitter', 'medical', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'wife', 'personal', 'failings', 'include', 'alcoholism', 'extremely', 'callous', 'personality', 'Moreover', 'secret', 'why', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', '1952', 'role', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'performance', 'attention', 'masterfully', 'character', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'struggling', 'own', 'issues', 'trying', 'keep', 'marriage', 'as', 'stable', 'possible.Unfortunately', 'Delaneys', 'fragile', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'rent', 'room', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'Marie', 'Buckholder', 'who', 'stirs', 'feelings', 'true', 'passion', 'Mr.', 'Delaney', 'motherly', 'feelings', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'Eventually', 'Delaneys', 'must', 'confront', 'true', 'yet', 'previously', 'unacknowledged', 'feelings', 'not', 'just', 'also', 'other', 'try', 'deal', 'pain', 'rather', 'serious', 'issues', 'resulting', 'lives', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'way', 'hoped', 'would', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'extra', 'burden', 'having', 'accept', 'loss', 'dog', 'Sheba', 'Lola', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'attached', 'Sheba', 'who', 'represented', 'child', 'never', 'had', 'addition', 'place', 'Marie', 'young', 'boarder', 'whom', 'Doc', 'feelings', 'youth', 'muscle', 'boy', 'studies', 'nearby', 'university.Will', 'Marie', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'ever', 'share', 'romantic', 'time', 'together', 'Will', 'Delaneys', 'deal', 'successfully', 'problems', 'Can', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'stay', 'away', 'drink', 'when', 'going', 'rough', 'Marie', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'replace', 'dowdy', 'aging', 'wife', 'Lola', 'What', 'might', 'happen', 'did', 'revert', 'drinking', 'again', 'Will', 'Sheba', 'be', 'found', 'returned', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Shirley', 'Booth', 'portray', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'Lola', 'Delaney', 'great', 'deal', 'sensitivity', 'throw', 'acting', 'roles', 'do', 'deeply', 'will', 'be', 'convinced', 'acting', 'step', 'way', 'picture', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'acting', 'particular', 'leaves', 'edge', 'seat', 'right', 'moments', 'film', 'Moreover', 'Terry', 'Moore', 'positively', 'young', 'Marie', 'Buckholder', 'who', 'Doc', 'Delaney', 'Mr.', 'Delaney', 'experience', 'romantic', 'passion', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years.The', 'choreography', 'exceeds', 'expectations', 'many', 'characters', 'moving', 'screen', 'several', 'scenes', 'doing', 'what', 'were', 'directed', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'times', 'cinematography', 'good', 'judgment', 'camera', 'moved', 'about', 'very', 'deftly', 'Daniel', 'Mann', 'crew', 'portray', 'exact', 'image', 'conjure', 'up', 'precise', 'emotions', 'want', 'audience', 'experience', 'times.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'extras', 'most', 'get', 'scene', 'selection', 'feature', 'course', 'standard', 'just', 'commercially', 'released', 'DVDs', 'today', 'movie', 'so', 'strong', 'however', 'disappointment', 'comparatively', 'minor', 'will', 'only', 'take', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'problem', 'make', 'four', 'star', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'classic', 'movie', 'buffs', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'superlative', 'dramatic', 'performances']",N/A

A great stage success for Shirley Booth, who won a Tony award for her efforts, this film is a rather uncinematic representation of the stage play with little opening-up or deviation from the original work.  That's okay.  William Inge's quirky characters and less-than-mainstream situations (for the time) draw and sustain interest.  Burt Lancaster's broodiness as the alcoholic husband has rarely been captured so effectively, and his gentle qualities as an actor were never more fully realized.  Terry Moore is actually quite right as the college girl and, if her acting is at times too superficial, she nevertheless presents a girlish innocence that leavens the heaviness of the film.  Richard Jaeckal is perfect as the burly athlete who scoffs at Lancaster and Booth but has other more nefarious things in mind for Moore.  This leaves Booth, who's character is unquestionably the centerpoint of the film.  She won an Oscar for this performance, but it simply doesn't hold up today.  Granted, Inge created a one-note character here and one waits for the big scene where Booth explodes with her own rage over life's trajectory, but it never comes.  Instead, she remains a simple, over-accomodating mass of neediness who desperately clings...to everyone, everywhere, at any time.  To make matters worse,  Booth's choices as an actress help make her character the most masochistic screen presence since Scarlett O'Hara, with none of the charismatic provocativity.  Booth is an annoying dolt from start to finish and her character generates no interest or empathy.That anyone dared to present such surly or lost characters at the time was hardly a commercial strategy.  It certainly would have been far off the beaten path of 1950s cinema tradition (with hindsight, it's now a quintessential tradition of that era).

291277,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,6302023807,Peter Baklava,"[1, 1]","""Come Back, Little Sheba"" received a great deal of attention at the time it was made for the performance of Shirley Booth.  But, Burt Lancaster is equally good in bringing this dark and claustrophobic William Inge play to life.If you are old enough to remember the 1950's, then you will recognize that Inge captured the moral climate exceptionally well.  ""Doc"" and Lola Delaney (Lancaster and Booth) are a middle-aged couple (in a time when 40 was considered ""over the hill"") and they are childless.  In the 1950's, childlessness was considered a curse, and easily became a companion condition to alcoholism.Doc and Lola live in a pleasant neighborhood, in a college town.  But they never get out, and they have no friends.  Lola seems to have no life at all except to wait for Doc to return from work--- listening to insipid escapism on the radio.In the very first scene of the movie, Terry Moore (Howard Hughes protege) arrives as ""Marie"", a precocious college student majoring in art, looking for a room that Lola has advertised.  In no time at all, Marie has inveigled her way into renting Lola's ""sewing room"" in the front of the house.  Marie, although engaged, is enough of a flirt to entertain a loutish athlete called ""Turk"" (Richard Jaeckel).  Marie and Turk become the stand-ins for the children Doc and Lola didn't have.  Marie and Turk play out their youthful passions in the front room, while Doc and Lola stand in the shadows in the back.  This is probably an exact adaptation of the original play's stage directions.The generational difference is very stark.  Doc and Lola both see Marie as a connection to their youthful years, but Doc harbors some hidden, dark attitudes towards women that must have been passed to him through his parents' generation.  When he succumbs to his desire to drink, finally, the full venom of his feelings emerges in the abuse he hurls at Lola.Though this isn't as pessimistic and dark as Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" or Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"", it is definitely an exploration of the underside of 1950's society.  Lola and Doc are exposed as empty and unfulfilled people, and prisoners of the manicured, well-kept 50's type neighborhood that soon became a fixture of TV sitcoms.  Despite the somewhat upbeat ending, and the hopeful theme of Alcoholics Anonymous and its twelve-step prescriptions, at the end of the movie it is hard to make believe that Doc and Lola's sufferings are over.Like many of the ""people down the street"", the childless couples of the Fifties, their fate is to fade into the woodwork.This film shows the Fifties as they were, without romanticism.

Shirley Booth got her best actress Oscar for this role and my favorite scene is when she is reclined on the sofa jiving to ""Fifteen Minutes of Taboo,"" on the radio.  Lola loves music, rhythm and dancing.  Let us not downplay Burt's acting however.  He is dead-on as the quiet, refined, gentleman that turns into a raving maniac when on a bender.  When Doc and Lola are patching up the shambles of his latest episode, there seems to be an epithany for Lola when she realizes her little dog Sheba is never coming back.  It seems that she may be able to let go of the past into which she escapes daily from her real life.  As a recovering alcoholic myself (See my review of Lost Weekend)I appreciate the parts of the movie that deal with AA and the spirit of recovery.

291279,A1VHGHK5NN7NGN,6302023807,Raymond Louis Llompart,"[1, 4]","Well, not quite-------for awhile you offer it hope and continue hoping that you will get past this EGREGIOUS mistake, but.....alas, you finally give up, and it is the greatest reason for which the movie falls apart.Burt Lancaster was a handsome, almost beautiful man at the time this CURIOUS, engaging and ultimately disappointing film was released in 1952. He was 39, and perhaps the word ""stud"" was not insulting in the least. He exudes sheer masculinity, and a body that was muscular and virile.Shirley Booth was 54 at the time, and although there was much talk about the difference in age, they still went ahead and filmed it. Indeed, she won the Oscar for her performance and perhaps, only relying on her acting here, and not her competition that year, which I am not aware of, she perhaps most certainly deserved it. Her acting is compelling.The problem of 15 years of difference in age between a romantic, or married couple is not a problem at all, if:It is known to us that it is indeed clearly stated in the story.OR, as it has happened countless times the couple are totally convincing as close enough in age, no matter the difference so that there is little to doubt or ""disbelieve"" in the unfolding of the story.The third logical excuse for it is, of course, prostitution in any of the myriad ways in which it has been presented again and again in the movies, when the difference in age is vast.And then , of course, although rarely seen in film, but leaving aside cynicism, the reality in life that indeed two people of great difference in age do find love, in whatever manifestation to carry on a beautiful relationship.But that is not the case in this film.Both characters are, we are told, a pair that eloped perhaps decades ago for which we are to believe that they were two young adults, the female indeed never forgiven by her father to the present day, when they are perhaps, arguably in their forties or early fifties.Congratulations to all those who are able to get past such a profound flaw in casting, and DO suspend disbelief and carry on.That is not possible to one who is watching, studying the scenes closely enough, and trying for awhile to BELIEVE.The reason for that hope is that both Lancaster and Booth give excellent performances that make it all the more disappointing to deal with this impasse.Other flaws permeate in this movie, engrossing during perhaps the first hour (out of 2) and complex in the characterization of an alcoholic who has been sober for a year, and who clearly no longer?----loves his wife.She herself is living in the past, as he cruelly tells her repeatedly when she remembers their early love, passion, and ultimately the reason for which Lancaster ""had"" to marry her, having made her pregnant and obliged to fulfill his ""duty"" (perhaps we should be better off a society if we go back to that?)No chance. It appears to be assumed that he has apparently never loved her, in any romantic way, and has suffered for it all these years.SHE has clearly lived in blindness when it comes to their relationship, whatever remains of it. He treats her more like a mother----and again we are even more reminded of the flaw already discussed.At one point, you STOP caring. A young, supposedly wholesome college girl in need of a room is taken by Booths' character and this is the ""excuse"" for which everything seems to unravel.She is suddenly seen to be a rather ""loose"" girl, and Lancaster's character finds himself unexpectedly confronting his LUST for her.Naturally, an alcoholic who has just celebrated his first year of sobriety at A.A. is almost certainly to be a deeply fragile human being, and fighting his emotions he reaches for ""the bottle""--------LITERALLY........We all know that the last thing you need to have at hand when you are fighting those hideous urges that paralyze you when maintaining your sobriety is, well, should we bother to mention?Yes, indeed, having your poison within reach.And then you fall into MELODRAMA, because the IDIOTIC idea of having a bottle of liquor in the cupboard a few paces away from you is not something that any serious person in recovery will do------not to mention your loving wife, who goes crazy when suddenly the bottle has disappeared and she realizes that he has broken his pathetic sobriety.REALLY???.....Well, no, we are not idiots here, and we presume that THEY, rather intelligent people, notwithstanding their terrible inner lives, would not be either.That puts an end to the respect we have for the film.The end itself is totally anti-climactic. They are both children holding onto each other, and we should assume that they will try again. These last scenes, even at the end reinforce the idea of a mother-son relationship. Again, there is nothing absurd about that, in and of itself, but to go back to the beginning of my review, what we cannot forgive is the fact that ""outside"" of the ""reality"" of the movie, we have the reality of the movie's construction, so to speak. And nobody is able to convince me that this matronly woman 15 years her husband's senior is for us to be fooled by unless indeed the story offers us the fact that there was INDEED a difference in age.Wonderful performances, mediocre plot, and DETAILS of that plot that are unimaginable to accept within the ""internal"" logic of the movie.And Little Sheba? The lady's dog who disappeared, never to be found again, and nothing more than another excuse for the character's profound melancholy.",3,Mother and Son and no way to suspend

That same year, Shirley was up against Julie Harris, who had also done ""The Member of the Wedding"" on stage and won awards. Ms. Harris has had as spotty a career on film, as did Ms. Booth.

Booth plays Lola so realisticly that one could call her performance a lesson in screen acting; she's like a subtle 50's version of Marie Dressler. In the demanding role of Doc, 39 year old Lancaster does an admirable job doing his best, but he is betrayed by his youth and it's obvious Booth is quite a bit older than he (In an interesting revelation revealed after Booth died, it was found that the actress actually took a full nine years off her true age (which was an a major feat of acting to pull off in itself!) making her about 54 when she made this movie!) Shirley usually gave 1907 as her birthyear, but it was revealed that she was indeed born in 1898.

Lancaster plays a sort of Jeckyll and Hyde character named ""Doc"":  calm and refined when sober, angry and dangerous when drunk.  The scene in which, drunk, he attacks his wife, Lola, is harrowing.  I've seen few scenes to beat it in terms of intensity and believability.  Doc buries his disappointments in drink and harbors a deep suspicion of women's sexuality.  Indeed, he is obsessed with female purity; thus the fact that Lola was pregnant before their marriage weighs heavily on him, and Doc, like Lola's father, never forgives her for this sexual ""mistake.""  Booth, as Lola, is heartbreakingly poignant.  The dominant symbol in the film, Lola's lost dog, Sheba, represents Lola's lost self:  her youth and her dreams.  Because she has no where to go when Doc becomes ""sick"" again, she is forced to resign herself to being a housewife who whitewashes her problems just like she gives her wooden ice box a fresh coat of paint.""You're all I have,"" Lola says to Doc at the end of the film.  ""You're all I ever had.""  Booth's genius in that scene is most evident.  I once read that Inge, the author of the play on which this film is based, was an alcoholic himself and believed that each woman should always stand by her man.  But one look at Booth's performance makes it clear that Booth didn't think so.  Booth's Lola is desolate at the end of this film.  Her mother and father won't take her in and her neighbor's only advice is ""keep busy.""  This, Lola will do, as she must, as she has no choice, but at a high cost.The first time I saw this film I was 12 or 13 years old.  I'm 50 now.  I just watched it again tonight.
