You have to give him credit for the work and research he did.  It will no doubt cause me to look at an African-American woman's hair different.  Chris keeps the subject alive by examining alarming truths about the issue.  I would have to agree with another review regarding content.  It didn't have as much comedy as expected.  Some may find the information demeaning, especially those who are intimate with the subject.  If you already know about weaves and relaxers please acknowledge Chris' efforts to bring awareness to some of the more painful points of the topic.UPDATE June 28 2010: it's been three months since I watched this movie and I still look at an African lady's hair differently.

1288480,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B002TOJOY8,Chris Luallen,"[53, 55]","Comedian Chris Rock takes a look at the lengths some people in the African-American community, especially women, go to for ""good hair"". Near the beginning and end of the movie Rock visits the Bronner Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia, a huge trade convention for the manufacturers of black hair products. Here he highlights four stylists competing for the title of champion platform performer, an elaborate stage show featuring music, dance, costumes and, of course, hairstyling. In between Rock discusses all the time and money spent using relaxer and getting weaves as well as the possible psychological and cultural reasons behind this obsession with hair.Rock's take on the subject seems to be that it is more important what's in your head than on your head. But it also recognizes the pressures placed on black women to fit in with society's beauty standards and understands why these women forsake their natural hair for perms and extensions. The film delves into serious subjects but maintains a funny and playful tone throughout. I certainly found myself laughing more than I did at the usual Hollywood comedy. And I even left the theater feeling a little smarter about a topic I knew almost nothing about.

1288484,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B002TOJOY8,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[0, 0]","Speaking as someone who grew up around people from many different backgrounds, and being born in the early 1980s, I saw all kinds of hairstyles and fashions come and go. I remember, distinctly, looking at some of the pretty, young girls in my classes and on the school bus, who had beaded braids, cornrows and slightly combed out afros. Since I didn't have that texture of hair, I honestly couldn't relate to stories of hair being processed, braided out or woven with tracks, extensions and wigs.Chris Rock takes a look at the industry, culture, criticism and, ultimately, the danger of processing ""good hair"" (AKA hair inspired by Asian and European hair texture). We see that the main ingredient in hair relaxers (ammonium thioglycolate) has enough concentrated poison to cause permanent lung damage and melt a soda can (first, turning it to a translucent shade, then, transparent and finally, melting it). Plus, we travel with him to hair salons and barber shops, as he speaks to hairdressers and barbers, and hop on an airplane to India, to find out the route/roots of the industry. Much of the hair we see, that is created into wigs, weaves, and track pieces comes from Asia - specifically, India. In India, young and old women, alike, have their heads ceremonially shaved, at least twice in their lifetimes, give it as a sacrifice, never seeing a penny of the proceeds that hair dealers take to collect thousands of dollars, back in the United States. Without giving away too many subplots or spoilers, we also catch a glimpse of a national hair show that takes place, annually, in Atlanta, Georgia - where hair experts come from various cities to compete against each other, like athletes, in a series of presentations of supermodel proportions - costumes, themes, etc.Chris Rock's humor comes fast and furiously, his interviews with celebrities like Ice T, Nina Long, and Sarah Jones, are engaging and insightful - as folks recount straightening stories, in their youth. We also learn the challenges of hair - especially, when it comes to social situations and dating. This is a great introduction to a culture I really didn't have much knowledge of. It gives me a better appreciation of what my best friend goes through, on a daily basis.",5,Fascinating and cautionary....,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,2247,"['Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'people', 'many', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'being', 'born', 'early', '1980s', 'saw', 'kinds', 'hairstyles', 'fashions', 'come', 'go', 'remember', 'distinctly', 'looking', 'pretty', 'young', 'girls', 'classes', 'school', 'bus', 'who', 'had', 'beaded', 'braids', 'cornrows', 'slightly', 'combed', 'out', 'afros', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'texture', 'hair', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'stories', 'hair', 'being', 'processed', 'braided', 'out', 'woven', 'tracks', 'extensions', 'wigs.Chris', 'Rock', 'look', 'industry', 'culture', 'criticism', 'ultimately', 'danger', 'processing', 'good', 'hair', 'AKA', 'hair', 'inspired', 'Asian', 'European', 'hair', 'texture', 'see', 'main', 'ingredient', 'hair', 'relaxers', 'ammonium', 'thioglycolate', 'enough', 'concentrated', 'poison', 'cause', 'permanent', 'lung', 'damage', 'melt', 'soda', 'can', 'first', 'turning', 'translucent', 'shade', 'then', 'transparent', 'finally', 'melting', 'travel', 'hair', 'salons', 'barber', 'shops', 'hairdressers', 'barbers', 'hop', 'airplane', 'India', 'find', 'out', 'route/roots', 'industry', 'Much', 'hair', 'see', 'created', 'wigs', 'weaves', 'track', 'pieces', 'Asia', 'specifically', 'India', 'India', 'young', 'old', 'women', 'alike', 'have', 'heads', 'ceremonially', 'shaved', 'least', 'twice', 'lifetimes', 'give', 'sacrifice', 'never', 'seeing', 'penny', 'proceeds', 'hair', 'dealers', 'take', 'collect', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'spoilers', 'also', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'national', 'hair', 'show', 'place', 'annually', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'where', 'hair', 'experts', 'come', 'various', 'cities', 'compete', 'other', 'athletes', 'series', 'presentations', 'supermodel', 'proportions', 'costumes', 'themes', 'etc.Chris', 'Rock', 'humor', 'fast', 'furiously', 'interviews', 'celebrities', 'Ice', 'T', 'Nina', 'Long', 'Sarah', 'Jones', 'are', 'engaging', 'insightful', 'folks', 'recount', 'straightening', 'stories', 'youth', 'also', 'learn', 'challenges', 'hair', 'especially', 'when', 'social', 'situations', 'dating', 'great', 'introduction', 'culture', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'knowledge', 'better', 'appreciation', 'what', 'best', 'friend', 'daily', 'basis']",Good Hair

1288487,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002TOJOY8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","While I struggle to watch everything I can about black culture and zeitgeist, I am often disappointed. I.e., DIARY OF A TIRED BLACK MAN was excellent, but it was frankly tiresome. My preference is for historical documentaries.Chris Rock, allegedly inspired by one of his daughters asking him about hair, takes us on a journey that seems more devoted to weaving/extensions than actual hair-as-cultural-history. I was disgusted but not surprised to hear about women paying up to $3,500 for hair extensions - then they will certainly take your life as if you were an insect if you even look like you're going to touch it!Yet as Rev. Al Sharpton points out in an interview, these same people have no food in their houses to feed the children. OOPS! - sorry, it all went on my hair extension. The good reverend, a hero of mine, joked that maybe some of the men should put their women's hair extensions as a dependent at tax time.Rock travels to India, to a temple I know very little about, where the women have their beautiful foot-long hair shaved off, in a sacrificial ritual, offering their hair to God. This of course is snatched up by temple authorities and sold - on the hair extension market.I was rolling on the floor when one interviewee described the ""tumbleweaves"", tumbleweeds of rejected or cast-away weaves blowing down the street. I used to see a lot of those in the 1980s, but others seemed to think I was seeing things - I was glad to hear someone else has seen this phenomenon!The Indian temple was fun to see, as I'm a Buddhist who had my head shaved for the first time in 1992, at my ordination - but then the hair extensions come into the picture again! So little history, and even worse, Rock uses an erroneous term (""tonsure"") for the hair offering.Rock interviewed many men to size up their thoughts about all this. Meanwhile, I was left wondering, ""What about black men?"" My father was black, and though I'm as pasty as Queen Elizabeth, I still have 'black' skin problems. My siblings have worse times than I do, since they look far more black.Not a word on that subject.I was distressed to hear about the hair-relaxation process, often called ""perm"" by the community. Because of my background I know all about my sisters' desperation to iron their hair out - lucky they could do even that - and I love the funny descriptions given to guests, such as Rev. Sharpton being called ""the Dalai Lama of Relaxer"". The chief ingredient in relaxers, sodium hydroxide (NaOH, a/k/a ""lye"") can render aluminum TRANSPARENT in 1 hour. In three hours it eats aluminum away, and women are putting that in their hair!It is plain to me: black women want the ease of straight hair and want to be rid of the ""nappy"" and the ""Afro"" problems ... hell, even men want it. Two of my brothers, like my father, spent a lifetime looking for hair relief (but they would never, ever go down Relaxer Road). Both my brothers finally had to lose their 'fros in the 1970s: they couldn't get jobs. It is true, as this film tells us, that interviewers do not like the Afro, or even like black people's hair.This seems more serious than I had ever thought. One has to admit that Chris Rock is no great charismatic personality to be doing this sort of presentation. Though he made good chemistry in general, he is just not the right host for this. The back-and-forth shots of Chris Rock sitting there like a dummy while his interview subjects are being interviewed ... too hokey for my taste. Documentaries should be fun and funny, yes. But they should also educate clearly and have a hard-line attitude about their subject.It would have been awesome if the Reverend had hosted this film!The only hard lines I saw here were hair extension-worship. I can readily forgive the relaxation process, if we find a safer method.

Chris Rock provides an in-depth view on relaxers and weaves.I'm biracial with extremely thick out-of-control curly hair. There have been times when my hair has broken combs, curling irons and hair brushes. When I was younger, I used relaxers to straighten my hair. Most of the time, they'd last for only a week or two before my hair reverted to its natural state. And there were times when my scalp was burned by the lye. So I could definitely relate to the coke can with the lye demo in the film.I wanted to give Maya Angelou kudos for not getting a relaxer until she was 70. When Chris Rock remarked that Ms. Angelou had waited her whole life for a relaxer, I loved her retort that she wasn't dead yet.I almost fell out my chair laughing when Chris Rock tried to sell African-American hair to beauty shops. At the same time, it was sad commentary. Why is African-American hair worth nothing? Why can't we embrace all types of hair?I also was saddened that African-American high school girls thought that natural African-American hair was ""unprofessional"" and ""bad.""

For that matter, I guess I never really looked at their hair in the first place until I saw this movie.  Now I'm noticing it acutely, and I feel like a veil has been lifted.  That's largely because, in this documentary expos&eacute;, Chris Rock nicely balances seriousness and humor to reveal the lengths American black women go to in order to straighten their hair with relaxers and augment it with weaves.The result is hair which emulates that of white women, and the underlying motive, whether conscious or not, may be a desire for status.  While that may sound like a stretch, it's consistent with the observation that lighter skin color currently has higher status in just about all societies around the world.  But, regardless, the bottom line is that these kinds of hair modifications are currently the norm among American black women, with ""natural"" hair thus being the exception.I understand that some black women are angry that Chris Rock made this movie, and I can appreciate that feeling.  After all, if they're trying to look good according to current fashion norms, they don't need people focusing on how they achieved that result and thus undermining the whole effect.  But on the other hand, it's also important to know that a large category of people feel pressured to alter their appearance, arguably somewhat radically, rather than being able to be comfortable with their natural appearance.  Moreover, I don't think that this movie degrades black women or diminishes their percieved beauty.  On the contrary, I'm personally finding my appreciation for the beauty of black women to be enhanced, regardless of what they do (or don't do) to their hair.  Maybe it has something to do with becoming aware of the care that black women give to their appearance, and thereby becoming appreciative of that?In any case, I found this movie to be both entertaining and very eye-opening, and I recommend it to people interested in discovering a facet of American culture which they may have previously been totally oblivious to (like me).",4,A real eye-opener,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2109,"['Wow', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'black', 'women', 'hair', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'matter', 'guess', 'never', 'really', 'looked', 'hair', 'first', 'place', 'saw', 'movie', 'Now', ""'m"", 'noticing', 'acutely', 'feel', 'veil', 'been', 'lifted', 'largely', 'documentary', 'expos', 'eacute', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'nicely', 'seriousness', 'humor', 'reveal', 'lengths', 'American', 'black', 'women', 'go', 'order', 'straighten', 'hair', 'relaxers', 'augment', 'weaves.The', 'result', 'hair', 'white', 'women', 'underlying', 'motive', 'conscious', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'desire', 'status', 'may', 'sound', 'stretch', 'consistent', 'observation', 'lighter', 'skin', 'color', 'currently', 'higher', 'status', 'just', 'societies', 'world', 'regardless', 'bottom', 'line', 'kinds', 'hair', 'modifications', 'are', 'currently', 'norm', 'American', 'black', 'women', 'natural', 'hair', 'thus', 'being', 'exception.I', 'understand', 'black', 'women', 'are', 'angry', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'made', 'movie', 'can', 'appreciate', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'trying', 'look', 'good', 'according', 'current', 'fashion', 'norms', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'people', 'focusing', 'how', 'achieved', 'result', 'thus', 'undermining', 'whole', 'effect', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'important', 'know', 'large', 'category', 'people', 'feel', 'pressured', 'alter', 'appearance', 'arguably', 'somewhat', 'radically', 'rather', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'comfortable', 'natural', 'appearance', 'Moreover', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'black', 'women', 'diminishes', 'percieved', 'beauty', 'contrary', ""'m"", 'personally', 'finding', 'appreciation', 'beauty', 'black', 'women', 'be', 'enhanced', 'regardless', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'hair', 'Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'becoming', 'aware', 'care', 'black', 'women', 'give', 'appearance', 'thereby', 'becoming', 'appreciative', 'case', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'very', 'eye-opening', 'recommend', 'people', 'interested', 'discovering', 'facet', 'American', 'culture', 'may', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'totally', 'oblivious']",Good Hair

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[10, 13]","Having no sisters and being a white guy who grew up in an all-white town, when it comes to African American women and how much their hair means to them, my experience brings up the rear.The first notion of how American black women may value appearance more than other females in the U.S.A. came to me when I saw the Spike Lee 1980s movie SCHOOL DAZE, where African American college girls with permanents belittle fellow sisters who leave their hair natural, derisively referring to the curly locks as ""nappy.""  Two decades later, actor Chris Rock's documentary GOOD HAIR straightens out the rest of it for me.His pre-school daughter's interest in what she calls ""good hair"" - as opposed to what naturally grows on her head - starts Chris Rock's journey into dangerous hair-straightening chemicals and expensive hair weaves.  GOOD HAIR features Rock's interviews with black women and men, famous and unknown, explaining their need to avoid the naturally curly look.  News to this white guy is the celebrity status of black hair designers and a hair convention where stylists compete for prizes using elaborately staged demonstrations, including choreography that matters as much as the haircut.How far do African American women go for straight hair?  To India, where Chris Rock watches as Indian people cut off their hair for religious purposes and Americans import it, because those straight locks become weaves religiously worn by black women.See GOOD HAIR.  Being African American, of course Chris Rock grew up knowing how much it means for black women to uncurl their tresses and add to it with straight hair they didn't grow themselves.

One of the weaknesses of this film - and it is a very good film - is that we are not sure for a while if we are being spoffed by Chris Rock, as he treats the subject of the film with respect and candor. Once I understood that he had an actual interest in the subject, I settled in and very much enjoyed what became an eyeopening look at the history and social implications of the hair of black women and what role it plays in their perceived social standing and the impact that this perception has upon their lives. From the hair dressers convention in Atlanta to the hair gatherings in the temples of India, we see the impact that hair plays in the psyche of black women and their men.

Rock talks to men, women, salon owners, manufacturers, and suppliers, all the way back to the women in India who sell their hair for this purpose. I was especially struck by one man who commented that he could tell when a woman was out of his financial league, just by her hair style.This is up there with the best examples of the documentarian's art. After seeing it, I now notice more of one aspect of the world around me. I certainly have a better understanding of what some of the women I work with are going through.Rock also shows himself to be an excellent documentarian, in that he integrates the different aspects of the hair industry seamlessly, and keeps the action moving.

Sherwin,"[2, 3]","Although so many people have written about this very interesting and often amusing documentary, I just had to write a review of my own to let you know my thoughts about it. First off, I am embarrassed to admit that I was unaware that black women put themselves through so much inconvenience, expense and even physical pain to have ""good hair,"" which, in essence, means losing the ""Afro"" look to have hair like a white woman's so they can get jobs and be more accepted. I was amazed to discover that in the African-American community many women and even some men pay thousands and thousands of dollars to purchase--sometimes on lay-away plans--hair extensions attached onto their shortened natural hair often using clips or get perms and other hair styles that use sodium hydroxide which can easily burn the skin on their heads and cause them great physical pain indeed. To demonstrate just how dangerous sodium hydroxide truly is, Chris Rock, the host of this documentary, examines the effects of sodium hydroxide on aluminum cans--after just a few hours of being dipped into a vial of sodium hydroxide the can is almost entirely disintegrated--and sodium hydroxide is what many black women and some black men put into their hair to make it wavy, straighter, ""whiter,"" or anything unlike the ""Afro"" look.The film begins with Chris Rock telling us how surprised he was when his very young daughter walked into their home and asked him why she didn't have ""good hair."" Although he clearly sends the right message (he narrates as well as interviews) that what's in a person's head is more important than their hair, the film examines this issue well beyond this one statement.There are two particularly interesting segments in this documentary that are well worth mentioning. Chris Rock visited the Bronner Brothers Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia to see the multi-billion dollar industry that has been created because so many African-American women want to have hair like Farah Fawcett. Many of the companies who present their hair products at the show were started by black people but have been bought up by Asians. There is also footage from a hair competition in which hairdressers have to put on an elaborate display involving creativity and originality to demonstrate that they really and truly know how to make a black woman's hair look anything but natural. There's a lot to laugh at here and indeed all through the film; but the unfortunate message that black women don't feel good about their natural appearance comes through loud and clear. There is great pressure on them to have hair that is straight or wavy--and they don't want their men touching their hair, not even during intimate moments!Chris Rock also travelled to India for another segment of this film. I learned how women in India consider hair to be ""a vanity;"" and so they have their heads shaved during a religious ritual called ""tonsure."" The hair is then processed and sent to countries like America--where it is sold at high prices to women and sometimes men in either beauty parlors or barber shops. There is good interview footage with Chris Rock interviewing an Indian man who owns a company there that processes human hair for export. Indeed, India's biggest export is human hair!Other interesting interviews Chris Rock has are with famous people including the great poet Maya Angelou; actress Kerry Washington; Reverend Al Sharpton; the rappers Salt-N-Pepa; Nia Long and more. Maya Angelou states that hair ""is a woman's glory;"" and apparently black women want the ""glory"" of the white woman's hair. Chris Rock also interviews everyday people for their thoughts on the subject; he talks with women in beauty parlors and men in barber shops and what they have to say about weaves, extensions and perms for black women or men are very interesting!Overall, this documentary takes a most serious topic and uses some humor to make it enjoyable without heavy social commentary. The relative lack of social commentary may disappoint some people, but if you really look and listen to all those interviews there's more social commentary than what initially meets the eye. I hope the day will come when black women don't feel such pressure to have hair like a white woman's hair--they should be proud of their natural beauty and heritage. I recommend this documentary for anyone interested in African-American culture; and it's a real eye-opener for white people like me who were previously unaware of the scope of this issue.",5,"""Do not touch my weave""",1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,4496,"['so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'very', 'interesting', 'often', 'amusing', 'documentary', 'just', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'own', 'let', 'know', 'thoughts', 'First', 'am', 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'was', 'unaware', 'black', 'women', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'inconvenience', 'expense', 'even', 'physical', 'pain', 'have', 'good', 'hair', 'essence', 'losing', 'Afro', 'look', 'have', 'hair', 'white', 'woman', 'can', 'get', 'jobs', 'be', 'more', 'accepted', 'was', 'amazed', 'discover', 'African-American', 'community', 'many', 'women', 'even', 'men', 'pay', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'purchase', 'sometimes', 'lay-away', 'plans', 'hair', 'extensions', 'attached', 'shortened', 'natural', 'hair', 'often', 'using', 'clips', 'get', 'perms', 'other', 'hair', 'styles', 'use', 'sodium', 'hydroxide', 'can', 'easily', 'burn', 'skin', 'heads', 'cause', 'great', 'physical', 'pain', 'indeed', 'demonstrate', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'sodium', 'hydroxide', 'truly', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'host', 'documentary', 'effects', 'sodium', 'hydroxide', 'aluminum', 'cans', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'being', 'dipped', 'vial', 'sodium', 'can', 'almost', 'entirely', 'disintegrated', 'sodium', 'hydroxide', 'what', 'many', 'black', 'women', 'black', 'men', 'put', 'hair', 'make', 'wavy', 'straighter', 'whiter', 'anything', 'Afro', 'look.The', 'film', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'telling', 'how', 'surprised', 'was', 'when', 'very', 'young', 'daughter', 'walked', 'home', 'asked', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'hair', 'clearly', 'right', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'what', 'person', 'head', 'more', 'important', 'hair', 'film', 'issue', 'well', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'segments', 'documentary', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'visited', 'Bronner', 'Brothers', 'Hair', 'Show', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'see', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'industry', 'been', 'created', 'so', 'many', 'African-American', 'women', 'want', 'have', 'hair', 'Farah', 'Fawcett', 'Many', 'companies', 'who', 'present', 'hair', 'products', 'show', 'were', 'started', 'black', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'bought', 'up', 'Asians', 'also', 'footage', 'hair', 'competition', 'hairdressers', 'have', 'put', 'elaborate', 'display', 'involving', 'creativity', 'originality', 'demonstrate', 'really', 'truly', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'black', 'woman', 'hair', 'look', 'anything', 'natural', 'lot', 'laugh', 'here', 'indeed', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'message', 'black', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'natural', 'appearance', 'loud', 'clear', 'great', 'pressure', 'have', 'hair', 'straight', 'wavy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'men', 'touching', 'hair', 'not', 'even', 'intimate', 'moments', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'also', 'travelled', 'India', 'segment', 'film', 'learned', 'how', 'women', 'India', 'consider', 'hair', 'be', 'vanity', 'so', 'have', 'heads', 'shaved', 'religious', 'ritual', 'called', 'tonsure', 'hair', 'then', 'processed', 'sent', 'countries', 'America', 'where', 'sold', 'high', 'prices', 'women', 'sometimes', 'men', 'beauty', 'parlors', 'barber', 'shops', 'good', 'interview', 'footage', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'interviewing', 'Indian', 'man', 'who', 'company', 'there', 'human', 'hair', 'export', 'Indeed', 'India', 'biggest', 'export', 'human', 'hair', 'Other', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'are', 'famous', 'people', 'including', 'great', 'poet', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'actress', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Reverend', 'Al', 'Sharpton', 'rappers', 'Salt-N-Pepa', 'Nia', 'Long', 'more', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'hair', 'woman', 'glory', 'apparently', 'black', 'women', 'want', 'glory', 'white', 'woman', 'hair', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'also', 'everyday', 'people', 'thoughts', 'subject', 'women', 'beauty', 'parlors', 'men', 'barber', 'shops', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'weaves', 'extensions', 'perms', 'black', 'women', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'documentary', 'most', 'serious', 'topic', 'humor', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'heavy', 'social', 'commentary', 'relative', 'lack', 'social', 'commentary', 'may', 'disappoint', 'people', 'really', 'look', 'listen', 'interviews', 'more', 'social', 'commentary', 'what', 'initially', 'eye', 'hope', 'day', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'black', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'such', 'pressure', 'have', 'hair', 'white', 'woman', 'hair', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'natural', 'beauty', 'heritage', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'interested', 'African-American', 'culture', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'white', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'previously', 'unaware', 'scope', 'issue']",Good Hair

I was shocked at how caustic and toxic the sodium hydroxide is that's used to relax black hair.  The experiment with the chicken breast and soda can was alarming, to say the least.  It's easy for me to say because I don't have these hair issues, but HOW could anyone expose themselves and especially their tiny children to these dangerous chemicals over and over and over again across a lifetime?  My own hairdresser told me that cosmetologists have one of the highest rates of Alzheimer's disease because they inhale these dangerous fumes year after year.  What's it doing to the customer?!  It seems like weaving is the way to go, if you prefer the straight look but good Lord; it's like taking out a small mortgage just to pay for it.I wanted to see interviews with women who had NATURAL hair.  There weren't any.  It seems strange to parade all these women with weaves and relaxed hair across the screen and not give equal time to the natural ladies.  The film showed us what's bad about relaxers and weaves but faild to show what's good about staying natural.I also felt the film was too long.  It could easily have been shortened by 1/2 hour by eliminating all the unnecessary business about the hairstyling competition at the Atlanta hair show.  Who cares about that?  This dialogue is supposed to be about relaxed vs. natural hair.  I don't care who wins a hairstyling contest.  Those bits seemed tacked on to lengthen the film when all it did was cause those parts to drag.

He mentions his two young daughters who still have natural hairstyles, but are beginning to notice that smooth straight hair is the ideal. Rock acknowledges that they will feel pressure to relax their hair and while he doesn't seem too crazy about it, he realizes it's only a matter of time.But now he's curious. Why is straight hair ""good"" hair? What's involved in straightening hair? Are there alternatives?To find out, he goes to the major black hair care product convention, which takes place twice a year in Atlanta. He finds that black hair is big business, controlled mainly by major corporations such as Revlon, but there are also some smaller companies, some black-owned, most not.The most revealing bit of information is that the vast amount of hair that is used for hair weaves, another popular method of getting straight hair, comes from India. While in India, Rock learns from one hair dealer that the hair is so valuable that Indian women are at risk of having their long hair snipped off in dark movie theaters.It would have been interesting to find out a little more of the history of black hair styles, to find out when it became practically mandatory for black women to straighten. There's a poignant interview in which a group of high school girls, all but one with straightened hair, talk about the necessity of having smooth hair for getting a job. The girls acknowledge the cuteness of the one girl's natural style, then declare that they would never hire someone who had such an unprofessional look, such a disregard for her own appearance.Too much time was devoted to the competition at the hair convention, which is a staged extravaganza with dancing and costumes and very little hair styling, oddly enough.Good Hair is a thoughtful and entertaining documentary, which is about black hair, but could easily apply to the lengths many women (and increasingly, men) of all ethnicities go to to look good. Many of us spend more time and money than we can afford on beauty regimens. We apply dangerous chemicals to our bodies in the pursuit of beauty. Tattoos and whiteners and straighteners have been around for thousands of years.
