389766,A3AZV05G93JUV4,6303929583,90s Kid,"[0, 0]","I grew up watching this film! I love Heavyweights and it is one of those films you can re-watch again and again!During the 90s, a lot of great kids films were made which means there were a lot of child actors/stars at the time. You will see several in this film. One thing I loved about the blu-ray is the current interviews. They have tracked down several of the films stars and you get to hear what it was like, during filming, from their perspective. One star even had a birthday during filming - No Spoilers here though.The film itself follows Jerry and his new friends to Camp Hope (a camp for overweight kids) which is terrorized by the new owner, an insane Tony Perkins, who is trying to get rich quick. Ben Stiller's performance is just incredible. I have never seen him in anything like this since and it remains some of his best work. His parents are also in the film, playing the original owners of Camp Hope.Heavyweights is a great addition to any blu-ray collection!

Enter their 'new owner and operator' Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller).Tony is like one of those health buffs that do weird exercises and have weird techniques and such, all of which are highly ineffective. All of this drives the kids to sneaking candy and cheating, which is what they always do at camp, but this time, they'er desperate.The co-stars in the movie are awesome, there's Lars, the strange foriegn counselor with a hilarious accent and funny sleeping problem, there's Kenny the camera-man, who may look familiar to you if you've seen plenty of Adam Sandler movies,  Roy and Josh, comedic camp legends, and of course, Gerry, the main fat kid in the movie.You'll absolutley love this movie, with all the funny quotes and jokes, but if you don't, screw you!",5,"&quot;Hey, dont pee in the wata!

I always found it relentlessly funny, good natured, and full of wonderful comic acting and timing.  Ben Stiller before he was a big star.  And, it's a Judd Apatow movie for kids.  Can't get any better to me.  The movie centers on Gerry Garner, a chubby kid from Long Island with a mean dad, who himself in retrospect can't get away from work, or his own personal stuff to spend time with his overweight son.  The other kids, namely Keenan Thompson, and Goldberg from Mighty Ducks all shine, full of one liners and great physical comedy.  There are some seriously funny can't miss sequences here, some involving a strenuous hike, a hilarious food discovery, weigh in/photo session montage, and quite a few others.  The line I can't ever forget in this movie is  ""You've Broken My Camera!"". When you see it, you'll know why I laugh.  Seriously. All things aside, I think this movie is excellent for the 8 and up crowd, and at 22, I still find myself cracking up at it.  Yes, I was and am a fat kid, but I never had a problem finding something about myself to laugh at.  This movie is excellent...and was also a sign of things to come...look at Apatow now!

And for Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""Pineapple Express""), the writer/producer started with television with TV movies for Tom Arnold and ""The Ben Stiller Show"", but for his first feature film as a writer, it was the 1995 teen comedy ""Heavyweights"".While the film didn't do well in the box office, the film received a cult following, especially since it featured the earlier work of director Steven Brill (""Little Nicky"", ""Without a Paddle"", ""Drillbit Taylor"") and actors Ben Stiller (""Tropic Thunder"", ""Zoolander"", ""Starsky & Hutch""), Kenan Thompson (""Saturday Night Live"", ""Fat Albert"", ""Kenan & Kel""), Aaron Schwartz (""Gossip Girl"", ""The Mighty Ducks"", ""Stray""), Leah Lail (""V.I.P."", ""Little Nicky"") and Shaun Weiss (""Drillbit Taylor"", ""The Mighty Ducks"" films).  The film would also star Jeffrey Tambor (""There's Something About Mary"", ""The Hangover"", ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""), Jerry Stiller (""The King of Queens"", ""Seinfeld""), Anne Meara (""Awakenings"", ""Night at the Museum"", ""Fame"") and Tom McGowan (""Ghost World"", ""Bad Santa"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"").VIDEO:""Heavyweights"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Surprisingly, I was expecting this '90s film to look a bit soft. But it actually looks quite good for its age.  Shot outdoors, the film looks bright and colorful, skin tones look natural and the film looks good overall.  Granted, the film still looks like a film from the '90s but no doubt looks amazing on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Heavyweights"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is pretty much dialogue and music-driven.  Both are crystal clear and while I personally didn't notice much surround sound use during my viewing of the film, aside from ambiance, for a film like ""Heavyweights"", the lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and SpanishSPECIAL FEATURES:""Heavyweights"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with Judd Apatow, Steven Brill, Allen Covert, Aaron Schwartz, Shaun Weiss, Tom Hodges and special guest Paul FeigDeleted and Extended Scenes - (1:34:32) Featuring 32 deleted and extended scenes.The Making of Heavyweights - (24:36) The original 1995 making of featurette for ""Heavyweights"".Super 8 - Footage Shot by the Cast and Crew - (8:59) what kind of footage did the cast and crew capture with their Super 8?Video Chat: Judd and Kenan - (8:21) Judd Apatow and Kenan Thompson reflect on working together on ""Heavyweights"".Where Are They Now?  - See the Kids All Grown Up - (14:41) Featuring several of the cast members today discuss behind-the-scenes of ""Heavyweights"".Judd's Art Project - His Bizarre Photos from the Set - (1:53) Apatow's intriguing photos taken of the cast and crew.Theatrical Trailer - (2:03) The theatrical trailer for ""Heavyweights"".JUDGMENT CALL:What a surprise?Judd Apatow and Steven Brill's ""Heavyweights"" on Blu-ray and in the words of Kenan Thompson, ""People want to see us...'Heavyweights' in HD?""As a fan of Kenan Thompson especially his earlier work, it's great to see him and some of the cast of ""The Mighty Ducks"" on ""Heavyweights"".  It's definitely not politically correct and a film about overweight kids going to a weightloss camp, yet gaining weight while in camp (and licking chocolate and sweets from each other's body) would probably make people think ""WTF!"".But this was released during the mid-90&#8242;s, a time when ""Beavis & Butthead"" were on television and sensitivity towards certain issues were not a primary focus in a family film.But as the cast will tell you on the special features, ""Heavyweights"" was funny and fascinating because the children in the film are overweight and the fact is that even when they weren't filming, they were being fed with pizza and all you can eat ribs for $5.  You probably will never see a film like this ever being made these days, so for comedy fans, ""Heavyweights"" is hilarious but also, so wrong...you feel a bit guilty for laughing.But first, for Judd Apatow film fans, ""Heavyweights"" is an interesting release because it is one film you just never pictured being released on Blu-ray.  But you get to see cast members when they were younger, overweight and sporting the poofy hair.While the film's humor is because the film exploits these overweight kids who feel nothing is wrong with them, the film does showcase them as the underdogs.  Almost in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" kind of way, these kids who are always the loser when it comes to competing with their rival camp mates, they are always made fun of because of their weight.  So, with teamwork and good thinking, these kids many not win a race or a competition of endurance but they could utilize other talents for their camp competition.What's interesting is the featurette ""Where Are They Now?"" and to see how many of these kids grew up to be thin adults.  Aaron Schwartz appeared on ""Gossip Girl"" and he is fit, Shaun Weiss is also quite thin, it was interesting to see the various talent comment about themselves in the past and just to see how different they look in 2012.But I enjoyed the film for it's humor and for a '90s film, it was a lot of fun to watch this film once again nearly 17 years later.  For those that are sensitive of overweight jokes, this film is probably not for you.  But these kids know they are overweight, they know that the public sees them as overweight but part of the concept of ""Heavyweights"" is that Camp Hope represents a place where these kids can be together and not be teased for their weight.  And take part in activities without worry if they are swimming without a t-shirt on or just being among their peers and feel respected and getting support.While this film is considered a Disney family film, it's important for parents to know that this is rated PG and there are some rude dialogue that you probably don't want your children to hear.  Even my wife was a little unnerved to hear some of the dialogue and questioned me (since I was watching with my 9-year-old) repeatedly if this film was appropriate for him to watch.As for the Blu-ray release, I was expecting this mid-90&#8242;s film to look a little soft but for the most part, colors are good.  Skin tones are natural and I didn't see any problems such as banding or artifacts, ""Heavyweights"" looks and sounds good on Blu-ray!  But the special features were really awesome and I don't think I have seen so many deleted scenes included with a film before.  So, you kind of realize that there were a lot of experimentation of scenes to see what would work and what wouldn't for the final cut of the film.For fans of Judd Apatow or Steven Brill films, it's important to remember that this is their earlier work.  As well as for a lot of these younger talent featured in the film.  But for those who grew up during this time and watched this movie in the theater or on cable, will probably enjoy the crazy humor of ""Heavyweights"".  Sure, the jokes are immature and juvenile, but it's an Apatow/Brill film.Overall, ""Heavyweights"" is a PG popcorn comedy film that will entertain families and for those who grew up with this film.  It's not for everyone and some people may find the film insulting to people who are overweight.  But if you are sensitive to jokes about those who are overweight, then this film is not for you.  But for those with an open mind to Apatow comedies, including this earlier film will find it to be entertaining and fun.  Plus, with a Blu-ray release that looks and sounds good and with so much additional content included, fans of ""Heavyweights"" will definitely want to check this Blu-ray out!",4,(3.5 stars) Fans of this Judd Apatow 1995 teen comedy will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release!,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,7764,"['few', 'filmmakers', 'achieve', 'popularity', 'have', 'start', 'somewhere', 'Judd',

Tony Perkis is a great villain trying to do the opposite. He harbors a hatred for fat people and is trying to force the kids to lose weight through humiliation and torture and only wants them to lose weight for his own personal gain.The kids then rebel and start binge eating after imprisoning Tony. However Pat, a camp counselor, then teaches the kids they need to start being responsible and not only starts making the camp fun, but makes weight loss fun for the kids.When Pat takes over after Tony is defeated, the kids are able to defeat the rival camp, Camp MVP. While MVP dominated the obstacle course, they slow down when it came to the mental challenges such as saving balloons and answering tough questions allowing Camp Hope to catch up and use their skills and intelligences to ultimately win, proving that while weight loss is important, fitness isn't everything.

Just today I viewed it again as a sophomore in college, and I've come to a strange conclusion: this movie is simultaneously a dumb kids movie and a... well, dumb, but very funny, comedy. This is largely due to Ben Stiller's over-the-top performance as Tony Perkis, aka the prequel to his White Goodman character in DODGEBALL, as well as Tom Hodges as Lars (which I'm pretty sure is the role he's known for, considering... well, who the hell is Tom Hodges? No offense, Tom), one of Tony's muscle-bound idiots who is from... far away. The kids have their funny parts, but they mostly account for the farting, eating, and farting while eating jokes.Anyway, the story concerns overweight 11-year-old Gerry Garner, whose parents send him to Camp Hope, a summer camp for overweight kids. He starts to feel comfortable there because everyone else likes to stuff their faces with sugar just as much as him. Then the sh- sorry, Disney movie- poopie hits the fan, as the sweet old couple (Stiller's parents, Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller) who own the camp are replaced by Perkis, a self-help exercise guru determined to turn these fatties into brawny Schwarzeneggers by the end of summer, all of which will be filmed for an infomercial to aid Perkis' career. The first half of the movie is the kids facing Perkis' strictness, while the second half is them rebelling. Along the way, there's a tepid romance between Pat (Tom McGowan), the former-camper-turned-sweet-counselor, and Julie (Leah Lail), the sweet camp nurse, and some added wackiness from Paul 'creator of FREAKS & GEEKS' Feig as Tim, the skinny counselor who used to be a fat camper.There is a lot of talent involved here: Stiller, Feig, and most notably Judd Apatow, who co-wrote and executive produced, and who of course would also do the same for FREAKS, thus establishing his burgeoning career as of late (and Seth Rogen and James Franco's, I'm sure). Then there's director Steven Brill, who also did THE MIGHTY DUCKS, a few Adam Sandler films (LITTLE NICKY, MR. DEEDS), and Apatow and Rogen's DRILLBIT TAYLOR. So it's obvious where the laughs came from. The rest is a typical, clich&eacute;d kids movie, but once you see Stiller walk defiantly on broken glass to prove his inner and outer strength, none of that will matter, dear campers.",4,BODY!!!,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2441,"['remember', 'enjoying', 'HEAVYWEIGHTS', 'growing', 'up', 'quoted', 'lot', 'strange', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'adolescent', 'point', 'Just', 'today', 'viewed', 'again', 'sophomore', 'college', ""'ve"", 'come', 'strange', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'dumb', 'kids', 'movie', 'well', 'dumb', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'largely', 'due', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Tony', 'Perkis', 'prequel', 'White', 'Goodman', 'character', 'DODGEBALL', 'as', 'well', 'Tom', 'Hodges', 'Lars', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'role', 'known', 'considering', 'well', 'who', 'hell', 'Tom', 'Hodges', 'No', 'offense', 'Tom', 'one', 'Tony', 'muscle-bound', 'idiots', 'who', 'far', 'away', 'kids', 'have', 'funny', 'parts', 'mostly', 'account', 'farting', 'eating', 'farting', 'eating', 'jokes.Anyway', 'story', 'concerns', 'overweight', '11-year-old', 'Gerry', 'Garner', 'parents', 'send', 'Camp', 'Hope', 'summer', 'camp', 'overweight', 'kids', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'there', 'everyone', 'else', 'stuff', 'sugar', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Then', 'sh-', 'sorry', 'Disney', 'movie-', 'poopie', 'fan', 'sweet', 'old', 'couple', 'Stiller', 'parents', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'who', 'own', 'camp', 'are', 'replaced', 'Perkis', 'self-help', 'exercise', 'guru', 'determined', 'turn', 'fatties', 'brawny', 'Schwarzeneggers', 'end', 'summer', 'will', 'be', 'filmed', 'infomercial', 'aid', 'Perkis', 'career', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'kids', 'facing', 'Perkis', 'strictness', 'second', 'half', 'rebelling', 'way', 'tepid', 'romance', 'Pat', 'Tom', 'McGowan', 'former-camper-turned-sweet-counselor', 'Julie', 'Leah', 'Lail', 'sweet', 'camp', 'nurse', 'added', 'wackiness', 'Paul', ""'creator"", 'FREAKS', 'GEEKS', 'Feig', 'Tim', 'skinny', 'counselor', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'fat', 'camper.There', 'lot', 'talent', 'involved', 'here', 'Stiller', 'Feig', 'most', 'notably', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'executive', 'produced', 'who', 'course', 'would', 'also', 'do', 'same', 'FREAKS', 'thus', 'establishing', 'burgeoning', 'career', 'late', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'James', 'Franco', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Then', 'director', 'Steven', 'Brill', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'THE', 'MIGHTY', 'DUCKS', 'few', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'LITTLE', 'NICKY', 'MR', 'DEEDS', 'Apatow', 'Rogen', 'DRILLBIT', 'TAYLOR', 'obvious', 'where', 'laughs', 'came', 'rest', 'typical', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'kids', 'movie', 'once', 'see', 'Stiller', 'walk', 'defiantly', 'broken', 'glass', 'prove', 'inner', 'outer', 'strength', 'none', 'will', 'matter', 'dear', 'campers']",Heavyweights VHS

389793,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6303929583,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[0, 0]","""Heavyweights,"" a small, low-budget adolescent comedy about ugly ducklings, may have emerged over time as a little swan. Not a classic by any stretch, but a solid, entertaining romp with little fat (sorry!)The creative team behind ""Heavyweights"" has gone from a small fraternity of struggling actors and filmmakers to some of today's movers and shakers, including Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") and Paul Feig (""Bridemaids"").Listening to the brand-new Audio Commentary is akin to visiting their school reunion, in which the once young, tireless and hungry rebels are now middle-aged, successful, but a little disillusioned. It's also interesting to hear how the pecking order of the past snaps back when they get back together, just from the way they all talk -- or don't talk as much -- on the commentary track.Like Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and Walt Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" 'Heavyweights"" was considered too dark and sardonic on its first release, but gained a loyal following over the years.This was only Ben Stiller's second feature film. At the time, he had come off ""The Ben Stiller Show"" and accepted the role of psychotic Tony Perkis (a twist on ""Perkins?""). He literally threw himself completely into the role, but according to the director, was disappointed when an audience of kids didn't find him funny, just mean. His image was not on tthe VHS or DVD release covers. Apparently he has reconciled his feeling about it -- he is prominently featured on this new Blu-ray package17 years later, with the tone of kid's cartoons like ""Spongebob"" and ""Phineas and Ferb"" presenting adversaries even nuttier than Perkis, the film seems to better fit the mood of today's times.Often teetering beyond its PG rating, ""Heavyweights"" may still strike some as very strange indeed, being sort of a comical ""Lord of the Flies"" where all the boys are like ""Piggy."" It has deliberate nods to ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" ""Platoon"" But so does ""Spongebob"" cartoons, just as Bugs Bunny classics contained references lost on kids but still funny to them. My son, who had never seen the movie before, finds it imminently quotable (""I am Lars!"" ""I come from far away!"" ""Repulse the monkey!"")Some parents may not be so enchanted, though. Foreshadowing their later, more raunchy movies, Apatow and company tread very close to the edge of bad taste and inappropriate material for young children, and Disney films in general (depending on your point of view, they fall off the edge at times, even in ""Heavyweights"" -- particularly in the alternate scenes).But the filmmakers are not historically accurate in their comments that they were bringing an ""edge"" to Disney films. Lots of Walt's films had more ""edge"" than they sometimes get credit for. And even some basic humor. Pop in a ""Fantasia"" disc and you'll even see one or two tushies.",4,Actually holds up better today than when it was first released,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,2875,"['Heavyweights', 'small', 'low-budget', 'adolescent', 'comedy', 'ugly', 'ducklings', 'may', 'have', 'emerged', 'over', 'time', 'little', 'swan', 'Not', 'classic', 'stretch', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'little', 'fat', 'sorry', 'creative', 'team', 'Heavyweights', 'gone', 'small', 'fraternity', 'struggling', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'today', 'movers', 'shakers', 'including', 'Judd', 'Apatow', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'Bridemaids', '.Listening', 'brand-new', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'akin', 'visiting', 'school', 'reunion', 'once', 'young', 'tireless', 'hungry', 'rebels', 'are', 'now', 'middle-aged', 'successful', 'little', 'disillusioned', 'also', 'interesting', 'hear', 'how', 'pecking', 'order', 'past', 'snaps', 'back', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'just', 'way', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'commentary', 'track.Like', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', ""'Heavyweights"", 'was', 'considered', 'too', 'dark', 'sardonic', 'first', 'release', 'gained', 'loyal', 'following', 'years.This', 'was', 'only', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'time', 'had', 'come', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Show', 'accepted', 'role', 'psychotic', 'Tony', 'Perkis', 'twist', 'Perkins', 'literally', 'threw', 'completely', 'role', 'according', 'director', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'audience', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'just', 'mean', 'image', 'was', 'not', 'tthe', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'release', 'Apparently', 'reconciled', 'feeling', 'prominently', 'featured', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'package17', 'years', 'later', 'tone', 'kid', 'cartoons', 'Spongebob', 'Phineas', 'Ferb', 'presenting', 'adversaries', 'even', 'nuttier', 'Perkis', 'film', 'better', 'fit', 'mood', 'today', 'times.Often', 'teetering', 'PG', 'rating', 'Heavyweights', 'may', 'still', 'strike', 'very', 'strange', 'indeed', 'being', 'sort', 'comical', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'Piggy', 'deliberate', 'nods', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'so', 'Spongebob', 'cartoons', 'just', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'classics', 'contained', 'references', 'lost', 'kids', 'still', 'funny', 'My', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'imminently', 'quotable', 'am', 'Lars', 'come', 'far', 'away', 'Repulse', 'monkey', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'enchanted', 'though', 'Foreshadowing', 'later', 'more', 'raunchy', 'movies', 'Apatow', 'company', 'tread', 'very', 'close', 'edge', 'bad', 'taste', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'young', 'children', 'Disney', 'films', 'general', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'fall', 'edge', 'times', 'even', 'Heavyweights', 'particularly', 'alternate', 'scenes', '.But', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'comments', 'were', 'bringing', 'edge', 'Disney', 'films', 'Lots', 'Walt', 'films', 'had', 'more', 'edge', 'sometimes', 'get', 'credit', 'even', 'basic', 'humor', 'Pop', 'Fantasia', 'disc', ""'ll"", 'even', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'tushies']",Heavyweights VHS

It pulls no punches, pokes fun at all the most questionable places, and avoids political correctness.Heavyweights is the story of a bunch of fat kids at a fat kid summer camp.  They all attend because their parents want them to lose weight, and on its surface, that's what the camp is about.  However, the camp owners actually have a great place, with all sorts of games, activities, and even go-karts.  Unfortunately for the piglets, the camp is under new management.The new owner Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller) has a grandiose idea to ""help"" these kids lose weight, and run a successful camp.  His ulterior motive, however, is to use film footage of his camp experience and make an infomercial from which he plans to make millions.  His methodology at the camp: exercise torture.In a matter of no time, the camp is in chaos, all the kids are terrified, and Tony Perkins has instituted policies that make camp life a living hell.  There's a ton of exercise, psychological warfare, and basic training-level discipline.  This is where the hilarity ensues.A collection of comedy follows, in what could easily be seen as the tgrue beginning to Ben Stiller's career.  Jabs at both the lazy habits and self-defeating nature of the obese, as well as those who loathe them, keep the laughs coming.  I particularly loved the scene in which the kids are all at the lake, basically tied to one another, yelling ""Buuudddyyyyy!"" to prove they were watching one another - a hilariously great idea for the lazy personnel manager.Will the kids lose weight?  Will they survive?  Will Perkins keep the camp and make huge money with his infomercial?

I worked for several days on location, and had some high hopes for the whole production, but felt that it fell short upon seeing it.Also, the experience of seeing it up close made me anti-Ben Stiller for many years to follow.  Here is why:  This film started production the week following REALITY BITES being the number one movie.  Stiller directed REALITY, which became a run away hit film for himself, Ethan Hawke and Wynona Rider.  I guess the success (his first major film success after moving from TV) went to his head quickly.  He seemed annoyed to have to fulfill a previously signed contract to do this movie and he comported himself in a very unprofessional and obnoxious manner the entire time.  In one scene we shot, in particular, he would mock and make fun of the films director in front of the cast and crew, he would refuse to take direction, and would make negative comments about the film, the script, the others involved, etc.  You could tell that he thought that he was far ""better"" than everyone there and the product itself.  Seeing this, turned me off on Stiller big time, and I boycotted his movies for years to come because of it. Rather than being happy and gracious with his newfound success, he was obnoxious and arrogant. The crew and much of the cast detested him and loathed working with him.  The director was simply stuck trying to make the best of it.  It was the most unprofessional behavior I have ever witnessed in all of the film productions I have been a part of (By contrast, I worked with James Garner, Jack Lemmon and Dan Ackroyd a year later and they were both great, gracious and professional, putting Stiller's antics in a proper perspective.)The kids and supporting cast working on the movie were all happy to be there, and very enjoyable to be around.What could have been a great experience was tainted. I tried to give the movie a fair shake upon seeing it at the premiere, but it just felt like it fell short.  It lacked something. They were clearly wanting to try and capitalize on some of the MIGHTY DUCKS success with this film, but it lacked the same substance and heart. ANd I honestly think that it was because of the on-set attitudes of the star that helped prevent this from being a better film.Just my two cents from some first hand experience.",2,secrets from the set,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2322,"['was', 'film', 'worked', 'several', 'days', 'location', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'whole', 'production', 'felt', 'fell', 'short', 'seeing', 'it.Also', 'experience', 'seeing', 'up', 'close', 'made', 'anti-Ben', 'Stiller', 'many', 'years', 'follow', 'Here', 'why', 'film', 'started', 'production', 'week', 'following', 'REALITY', 'BITES', 'being', 'number', 'one', 'movie', 'Stiller', 'directed', 'REALITY', 'became', 'run', 'away', 'hit', 'film', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Wynona', 'Rider', 'guess', 'success', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'success', 'moving', 'TV', 'went', 'head', 'quickly', 'seemed', 'annoyed', 'have', 'fulfill', 'previously', 'signed', 'contract', 'do', 'movie', 'comported', 'very', 'unprofessional', 'obnoxious', 'manner', 'entire', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'shot', 'particular', 'would', 'mock', 'make', 'fun', 'films', 'director', 'front', 'cast', 'crew', 'would', 'refuse', 'take', 'direction', 'would', 'make', 'negative', 'comments', 'film', 'script', 'others', 'involved', 'etc', 'could', 'tell', 'thought', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'everyone', 'product', 'Seeing', 'turned', 'off', 'Stiller', 'big', 'time', 'boycotted', 'movies', 'years', 'come', 'Rather', 'being', 'happy', 'gracious', 'newfound', 'success', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'arrogant', 'crew', 'much', 'cast', 'detested', 'loathed', 'working', 'director', 'was', 'simply', 'stuck', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'was', 'most', 'unprofessional', 'behavior', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'film', 'productions', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'contrast', 'worked', 'James', 'Garner', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'year', 'later', 'were', 'great', 'gracious', 'professional', 'putting', 'Stiller', 'antics', 'proper', 'perspective', 'kids', 'supporting', 'cast', 'working', 'movie', 'were', 'happy', 'be', 'there', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'be', 'around.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'experience', 'was', 'tainted', 'tried', 'give', 'movie', 'fair', 'shake', 'seeing', 'premiere', 'just', 'felt', 'fell', 'short', 'lacked', 'something', 'were', 'clearly', 'wanting', 'try', 'capitalize', 'MIGHTY', 'DUCKS', 'success', 'film', 'lacked', 'same', 'substance', 'heart', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'on-set', 'attitudes', 'star', 'helped', 'prevent', 'being', 'better', 'film.Just', 'two', 'cents', 'first', 'hand', 'experience']",Heavyweights VHS

389806,AFRZL05D54MPM,6303929583,JWolf,"[1, 1]","Released in 1995, ""Heavyweights"" is a Disney comedy about kids who have been sent to ""Camp Hope,"" AKA:  fat camp.  Many of the return campers remember their summers at ""Camp Hope"" fondly, but this year a new counselor named Tony Perkis has taken over.  Tony imposes strict fitness and diet regimens that lead to a campers' revolt.The movie, co-written by Judd Apatow and directed/co-written by Steven Brill, was poorly received by critics at the time of its release (29% on Rotten Tomatoes).  Like many comedies, the film does find a loving fan-base and is considered a comedy-cult-classic.  ""Heavyweights"" uses light-hearted humor that is especially enjoyable for young viewers; I've always found the movie to be one that's funnier when watched with friends than when watched alone.  While it was not one of my favorites growing up, I have added it to my collection for nostalgic purposes.  Cast-members include:  Ben Stiller as both Tony Perkis, Jr. and Tony Perkis, Sr., Jerry Stiller as Harvey Bushkin, Aaron Schwartz as Gerald Garner, Anne Meara as Alice Bushkin, Tom McGowan as Pat Finley, Tim Blake Nelson as Roger Johnson, Kenan Thompson as Roy, Judd Apatow as Homer, Tom Hodges as Lars, Allen Covert as Kenny, Cody Burger as Cody, Jeffrey Tambor as Maury Garner, Shaun Weiss as Josh Birnbaum, Leah Lail as Julie, Paul Feig as Tim, and Lauren Michelle Hill as ""Angelic Girl.""SUMMARY:  Gerry is initially nervous about his first summer at fat camp.  Once he settles in at Chipmunk Cabin, he makes friends among the veteran campers who lend reassurance that this will be a fun summer.  For further comfort, the returning campers reveal their treasure troves of junk food--much to Gerry's delight.The boys are devastated to learn that Camp Hope has undergone a change of ownership and will now be the `poster child' for Tony Perkis' fitness informercial.

On the way up he says, &quot;Did you ever hear the story of Icarus? He continually rolled the ball up the hill. But when he got too close, the ball melted in the heat of the sun. You're all like Icarus!&quot; Soonafter he ends up ordering the campers to do crazy zen stuff like 'feel the chi', 'Repulse the monkey', and 'part the wild horses mane'..

I love when camp MVP comes over to 'Camp Hope' to try and show off how better they are. Thats when the fun really starts...The kids make smart remarks at camp MVP, and everything they say, and do, is hilarious! One of Jerry's new friends is Josh. He is one of the jokesters that makes this movie worthwhile. Josh'll throw out a lot of jokes here and there, and right from the beginning...you automatically know that he is going to either get in trouble, or throw out a serious joke! When the new owner of 'Camp Hope' is introduced, he takes away all of the candy, sweets, anything fattening so that the kids can lose weight. Now, the kids are furious at all of their candies 'secret hiding places' are. They have nothing left to eat when they're tired of healthy food! A few of Jerry's friends, and him, go into the the new owner's house to look for any kind of sweets there. They don't find any candy, but...they find something, very disturbing. Jerry had written a letter to his grandma about everything going on. The go-karts were destroyed, the blob was punctured, the food was horrible, and his parents wouldn't listen to him. Well, the kids found a locked trunk, hoping that maybe some sweet candy would be in there. Instead, there were all the letters that the kids letters to be sent home to their loved ones! All of the kids think that he's 'sick', and Jerry finds his letter from his grandma! Now, the kids left immediately because the owner was coming! They relax at the restrooms, and Jerry hears 'food' wrapper. Philip yells to go away, and they open the door to find him eating a sandwich! The group of kids demand to know where Philip got the food at and he says 'Okay but you guys got to keep it a secret, okay.' Late at night, kids one by one, go out and grab themselves a piece of food. Even Pat decides to get in on the action along with the kids! This movies is so wonderful, every time that I re-watch it, I laugh over and over again. It makes me feel like when I was five, watching it for the first time.

Nevertheless, HEAVYWEIGHTS is one of the better movies made about summer camps.HEAVYWEIGHTS revolves around a youth named Gerry. Gerry is a bit overweight and the opening shots of the film illustrate how this causes Gerry problems. His parents decide that Gerry needs some excitement in his life and send him away to a fat camp. At first Gerry isn't too thrilled by the idea. But then he figures out that it's not bad at all because at camp, his weight isn't an issue because all the kids there are overweight like he is. The conflict in the film begins when the campers and staff learn that the elderly couple, who have been running the camp for so long, have been forced to sell the camp. The camp's new owner, Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) is a fitness guru who wants to use the camp to make a fortune filming the odyssey of this camp full of heavyweights who are turned into muscle machines by the end of summer.HEAVYWEIGHTS is really a good movie that's a lot of fun to watch. It's got a solid message about respecting yourself for who you are, yet the delivery isn't so over the top that it's smaltzy. There are a lot of wonderful one-liners throughout the movie that are great for quoting throughout life. The acting is superb, especially since most of the actors are overweight adolescents. Ben Stiller is hilarious playing Tony Perkis (he recently reincarnated his Tony Perkis character in the raunchy, adult summer garbage-fest DODGEBALL) and this was one of Stiller's earlier breaks in his career.Overall, HEAVYWEIGHTS is a great camp movie that has a little bit of something that everyone should be able to appreciate and enjoy.

The kids find out that the camp has been sold to a crazy fitness instructor named Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller), so now, the camp has turned into a living hell for the kids. No more candy, or fun things like Go Karts and ""The Blob"". Tony wants the kids to lose weight, so he'll be able to make a profit from his fitness TV commercials (he has a camera man follow him around the camp). However, the kids rebel against Tony, because they want to have fun, not exercise, therefore, Tony starts to go crazy (in a hilarious way), so he decides to counter their actions, for example: one day, he takes their lunch away, and on another day, takes them on a 20 mile hike, among other things. Gerry and his new friends, along with the original camp staff members Pat, who has visited the camp every summer for the past 18 years, and a goofy counselor named Tim who became fit before the summer, as well as a new nurse named Julie, decide to take the camp back.Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS in this movie. Seeing him as an insane health nut, patting kids down, searching for a pez dispenser or watching his character getting mad at the kids is great. While the film is not a cinema masterpiece, Stiller's performance in this film is great, and he delivers some of the funniest lines I've heard in a movie. His character in this film is like a younger version of White Goodman in ""Dodgeball"". Is this a guilty pleasure? Definitely.As for the DVD, in 2002, Disney established a new policy whereby any movies that they feel have limited adult appeal will be released on DVD in Pan & Scan only. No widescreen DVD. They've reneged a bit since then, but many titles from their live action catalogue have made their DVD debuts exclusively in reformatted fullscreen. This affects every unreleased live action Disney film, particularly those that the studio suspects have limited appeal outside of children. THEREFORE, this film, like many Disney classics, is only available on DVD in fullscreen (pan and scan).
