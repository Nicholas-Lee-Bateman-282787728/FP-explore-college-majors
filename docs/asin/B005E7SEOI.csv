1456409,ALZ0FP2BU401E,B005E7SEOI,"A. Palacio ""Save Them from The Fire""","[265, 269]","Restored?  Well, not entirely.  Nevertheless, a great effort was made to create a worthy boxed set of Honeymooners material and this deserves a top rating.  This is the most complete 'Lost Episodes' collection ever (and perhaps to ever be) offered.  Of course, the series itself is not complete without the 'Classic 39' (available separately), but for all else classic Honeymooners, this is it.Let's start from the beginning ...This set includes the first Honeymooners skit (without Audrey Meadows, but with Art Carney as a police officer) from 5 October, 1951.  As a nice added touch, the original host introduction precedes it.  From this and other early skits, we witness the initial incarnations of some of television's most famous lines of dialog.  ""Don't steam me Alice"" was there from the beginning, but ""'cause I'm already steamed"" would only be added in later routines.  ""One of these days Alice"" was also not yet accompanied by ""Pow! Right in the kisser"".  The earliest surviving Joyce Randolph appearance (as Trixie) is in The Ring Salesman from 7 December 1951.  The earliest surviving Audrey Meadows (as Alice) can be found in The New Bowling Ball from 20 September 1952.  Both are included in this impressive set.  The kiss at the end was there from the start, but the true magic between actors was yet to take shape.This collection was pieced together into an impressive 15-DVD set.  And no double-sided discs, so that's a big plus.  The booklet is nice and colorful, giving you a brief bio, basic information about the skits, and features some nice images.  In fact, all skits appear to be listed, whether or not the films still exist.  For what no longer exists (or otherwise could not be found), a chronological placement is included in the list along with the episodes found on the respective discs of this collection.The content is as good as you would hope, tracing Honeymooners back to the very beginning and garnishing it with several special features of which many had not been seen since their original airing decades ago.  Beyond the obvious, you will find 1954 radio episodes, several interviews then and now, commercials, cast appearances on other shows, additional non-Gleason skits, and even Honeymooners scripts which were never filmed.  And in the case of Stand-In for Murder, which had an aborted ending due to original TV time constraints, we see a few added seconds not seen on reruns and an explanation (of sorts) from Jackie Gleason himself about the intended ending and why it wasn't performed.The quality and restoration?  Certainly not much can be expected from these early days of television, so one must look at the previously-available material and compare.  From the previously unavailable works, some have audio anomalies such as a ringing noise and 'tin-can' sound.  In many cases, the source is likely as good as it gets.  In others, there are certainly some improvements, but they're not always welcome.  At times, audio was de-hissed to the point where select spots are nearly lost and others are too loud.  To give an example, the video on Lucky Number has been greatly improved; the image has been steadied and sharpened, the audio is louder and clearer, but for some reason it now has static.The original Lost Episode collections were cheaply put together and disc space was not well utilized.  Twenty-four (24) discs were needed to complete the original MPI Lost Episodes collection.  Not the case with this new, 60th anniversary collection.  Each disc is loaded with material.  For example, the first disc includes nine (9) surviving Cavalcade of Stars (1951-52) Honeymooners skits and the first nine (9) from The Jackie Gleason Show (1952-53).In total, there are 107 Honeymooners skits from various sources (1951-57) as well as dozens of other features both old and new.  Many are seen for the first time in over 5 decades and others are entirely new to all viewers.  As noted, everything outside of the 'Classic 39' filmed between 1951 and 1957 (which is known to exist) is included in this set.  Interestingly, several of the missing skits are available here in alternate aired versions which utilized the same script.  What you won't find is the premiere episode of Jackie Gleason: American Scene Magazine from 29 Sep, 1962 which features Gleason and Carney in an air raid shelter sketch entitled 'Two Below', a 10th anniversary Honeymooners special from another episode featuring Gleason and Carney revisiting their Dial J for Janitor sketch, and at least two others filmed in the early 1960s but believed lost forever.A nice little bonus which will likely be welcomed by all is that once you place a disc in your player, it almost immediately goes to the main menu and is ready to play.  This feature was included in all but the first disc.I used to watch Honeymooners every time I had a chance on NY's WPIX 11 back in the 1980s and 90s.  First at 11pm, then 11:30, midnight, 12:30 and so on until it nearly disappeared except for the 24-hour marathons a couple of times a year.  I copied and collected episodes from TV and enjoyed them until I was able to get the original 'Lost Episodes' on VHS, then DVD, and eventually, the 'Classic 39' on DVD as well.  I've viewed every skit from those sets many times over and memorized most of the dialog.  I was excited to hear about this 60th anniversary set but was skeptical about the level of restoration.  Though the improvements are not always obvious, the clear improvement for me is in the sheer breadth of this collection.  A welcome improvement to previous collections and so much more to enjoy and learn to love.  Perhaps there are some new favorite moments to experience.  No matter what, this is an impressive set and a worthy purchase for any and all interested in early television, Gleason, Carney, Meadows, Randolph, and of course, The Honeymooners.I realize this was a rather long review, so I thank you kindly for reading.",5,All the fixins and a couple of heels in the breadbox.,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,5942,"['Restored', 'Well', 'not', 'entirely',

This dvd set is loaded with so much material. I did not know there was so much Honeymooners material out there. As far as i can tell you get all the skits from the very beginning. I never knew there was another Alice Kramden but there was way back at the beginning. There are also musical Honeymooners episodes which i didnt even know existed. Having had the :ORIGINAL 39: EPISODES it is so nice to have this to add to them. You will see a few duplicate skits but they are always redone in a fresh and funny manner. The earlier skits run from about 5 mins to 13 mins and gradualy get longer. What i always felt made the Honeymooners so funny and so good was the excellent chemistry between Ralph,Ed,Alice and Trixie. Considering the time factor the audio and video dvd transfer is quite good. There is not one dull moment out of 15 dvds. 14 dvds of good old fashioned Honeymooners and 1 dvd of fantastic xtras. Realy,I can not praise this set enough and a tip of the hat to those who put this together. I caught this on sale on Amazon but I would have gladly paid the regular price for this.

Many of the sketches have not been seen since they were originally broadcast or at least not since their original season when they may have been shown as reruns.  The contents here are obscure and not quite up to the Classic 39's superior production values (shot on film vs. Kinescope), but true fans will enjoy watching the episodes and sketches, and owning this set in their collection.  Warning, the concept of ""complete"" refers to and assumes you already owning the Classic 39.  Those episodes are NOT included in this collection, so you do need both sets to have a full compilation of the Honeymooners.  There are apparently several pieces that are indeed lost.  The creators of this set put considerable effort into finding everything shot of Ralph, Alice and the Norton's, but there are a few pieces or segments that are simply gone.  Perhaps they will surface someday in someone's attic or private collection, but until then this closes out the genre on DVD.  I definitely recommend this set but only for true fans.  The casual fan of the Classic 39 will not appreciate this set and probably won't watch much of it.  For those fans purchase the Classic 39 which I believe remains available on Amazon.  The Honeymooners was landmark television for anyone who lived through the 50's and of course all the decades of syndicating the Classic 39 that followed.  I believe there are some places where it's still shown even today.  By the way, during syndication the Classic 39 were irreverently chopped up to create room for adding many more commercials than what was the norm when they were originally created, so when you get and watch that set it's like seeing those episodes anew with restoration of a good five minutes of long-edited out content.",5,Complete Your Honeymooners Collection,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1876,"['own', 'Classic', '39', 'was', 'released', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'Honeymooners', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'want', 'collection', 'Many', 'sketches', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'least', 'not', 'original', 'season', 'when', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'reruns', 'contents', 'here', 'are', 'obscure', 'not', 'quite', 'Classic', '39', 'superior', 'production', 'values', 'shot', 'film', 'vs.', 'Kinescope', 'true', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'sketches', 'owning', 'set', 'collection', 'Warning', 'concept', 'complete', 'refers', 'assumes', 'already', 'owning', 'Classic', '39', 'episodes', 'are', 'NOT', 'included', 'collection', 'do', 'need', 'sets', 'have', 'full', 'compilation', 'Honeymooners', 'are', 'apparently', 'several', 'pieces', 'are', 'indeed', 'lost', 'creators', 'set', 'put', 'considerable', 'effort', 'finding', 'everything', 'shot', 'Ralph', 'Alice', 'Norton', 'are', 'few', 'pieces', 'segments', 'are', 'simply', 'gone', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'surface', 'someday', 'someone', 'attic', 'private', 'collection', 'then', 'out', 'genre', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'set', 'only', 'true', 'fans', 'casual', 'fan', 'Classic', '39', 'will', 'not', 'appreciate', 'set', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'fans', 'purchase', 'Classic', '39', 'believe', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Honeymooners', 'was', 'landmark', 'television', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', '50', 'course', 'decades', 'syndicating', 'Classic', '39', 'followed', 'believe', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'still', 'shown', 'even', 'today', 'way', 'syndication', 'Classic', '39', 'were', 'irreverently', 'chopped', 'up', 'create', 'room', 'adding', 'many', 'more', 'commercials', 'what', 'was', 'norm', 'when', 'were', 'originally', 'created', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'watch', 'set', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'anew', 'restoration', 'good', 'five', 'minutes', 'long-edited', 'content']",The Honeymooners: Lost Episodes 1951-1957

1456422,A2DKP223QANS6N,B005E7SEOI,John F. Crowley,"[4, 5]","Firstly, it was about time MPI released the complete Lost Honeymooners collection, as opposed to their previous piecemeal, poorly packaged multi-volume set of the same.  The new set is smartly packaged and notated, and includes episodes not included in the previous release (one wonders whether MPI was saving them for this -- another round of marketing!).  Additionally, trailers are included promoting new MPI collections of the color Honeymooners episodes from later Gleason shows, thus insuring yet ANOTHER round of profiteering.  The MPI stockholders must be happy, but these later episodes should have been included in this ""complete"" collection, for crying out loud.OK, I'm done venting. I have little to add to the comprehensive reviews above but will contribute a few comments.  I'd looked forward eagerly to viewing the eight episodes of the Jackie Gleason Show featuring the Kramdens and Nortons traveling around the world (having won the Flakey-Wakies slogan contest), but was left with mixed feelings after seeing them.  There was a lot of singing and dancing, as musical comedies require, of course, but I found them a bit repetitive and over the top. Likewise, the cast bursting into song put me off and made the episode drag, and finally, the writing was not as crisp as one finds in the regular sketches. The worst of the lot may be the cast's trip to Africa in ""I Remember Mau Au."" (I'm surprised someone at MPI let that slip by -- the actual title of the episode was ""I Remember Mau Mau."")  Of more interest to me were the openings of the show (with ""glamorous"" ladies introducing Gleason and cast) and the final moments of the show where Gleason would come out on stage, make a comment or two, bring the cast out for a curtain call, compliment musical director Ray Bloch (""the Flower of the Musical World"") and thank the audience.One unexpected joy in this set can be found in the Bonus Features disc: a well written ""Honeymooners"" parody from the Jack Benny Show (January 1958) starring Audrey Meadows, Benny as Ralph and Dennis Day as Norton.  I don't know what Benny drank or smoked before this performance, but it is immensely entertaining, surpassed only by Day's inspired impression of Norton.Finally, it surprised me that the cast performed ""Christmas Party"" three times ('51-'53), each time with different guest performers.  MPI had previously included only the '53 episode with Frances Langford and that kid who belted out ""Walkin' My Baby Back Home,"" but the earlier parties featured different guests, such as a young Frankie Avalon playing the trumpet and tap dancing, and a juggling kid with a tremendous act.  Needless to say, I enjoyed seeing the slight comic variations of the Gleason Show regulars who filled out the ""Party"" episodes from year to year -- Fenwick Babbit, the Poor Soul, Joe the Bartender, Rudy the Repairman, and especially Reggie VanGleason, who each year brought a different band with him and outdid himself dancing with the chorus girls.In conclusion, while I have a bone to pick with MPI, I'm nonetheless grateful for this release and recommend it as essential viewing for fans of Gleason and company.",5,Almost as good as it gets,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,3157,"['Firstly', 'was', 'time', 'MPI', 'released', 'complete', 'Lost', 'Honeymooners', 'collection', 'opposed', 'previous', 'piecemeal', 'poorly', 'packaged', 'multi-volume', 'set', 'same', 'new', 'set', 'smartly', 'packaged', 'notated', 'episodes', 'not', 'included', 'previous', 'release', 'one', 'MPI', 'was', 'saving', 'round', 'marketing', 'Additionally', 'trailers', 'are', 'included', 'promoting', 'new', 'MPI', 'collections', 'color', 'Honeymooners', 'later', 'Gleason', 'shows', 'thus', 'insuring', 'yet', 'ANOTHER', 'round', 'profiteering', 'MPI', 'stockholders', 'must', 'be', 'happy', 'later', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'complete', 'collection', 'crying', 'out', 'loud.OK', ""'m"", 'done', 'venting', 'have', 'little', 'add', 'comprehensive', 'reviews', 'will', 'contribute', 'few', 'comments', ""'d"", 'looked', 'forward', 'eagerly', 'viewing', 'eight', 'episodes', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Show', 'featuring', 'Kramdens', 'Nortons', 'traveling', 'world', 'having', 'won', 'Flakey-Wakies', 'slogan', 'contest', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'seeing', 'was', 'lot', 'singing', 'dancing', 'musical', 'comedies', 'require', 'course', 'found', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'top', 'Likewise', 'cast', 'bursting', 'song', 'put', 'off', 'made', 'episode', 'drag', 'finally', 'writing', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'crisp', 'one', 'regular', 'sketches', 'worst', 'lot', 'may', 'be', 'cast', 'trip', 'Africa', 'Remember', 'Mau', 'Au', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'someone', 'MPI', 'let', 'slip', 'actual', 'title', 'episode', 'was', 'Remember', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'more', 'interest', 'were', 'openings', 'show', 'glamorous', 'ladies', 'introducing', 'Gleason', 'cast', 'final', 'moments', 'show', 'where', 'Gleason', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'stage', 'make', 'comment', 'two', 'bring', 'cast', 'out', 'curtain', 'call', 'compliment', 'musical', 'director', 'Ray', 'Bloch', 'Flower', 'Musical', 'World', 'thank', 'audience.One', 'unexpected', 'joy', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'well', 'written', 'Honeymooners', 'parody', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Show', 'January', '1958', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Meadows', 'Benny', 'Ralph', 'Dennis', 'Day', 'Norton', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Benny', 'drank', 'smoked', 'performance', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'surpassed', 'only', 'Day', 'inspired', 'impression', 'Norton.Finally', 'surprised', 'cast', 'performed', 'Christmas', 'Party', 'three', 'times', ""'51-'53"", 'time', 'different', 'guest', 'performers', 'MPI', 'had', 'previously', 'included', 'only', ""'53"", 'episode', 'Frances', 'Langford', 'kid', 'who', 'belted', 'out', 'Walkin', 'My', 'Baby', 'Back', 'Home', 'earlier', 'parties', 'featured', 'different', 'guests', 'such', 'young', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'playing', 'trumpet', 'tap', 'dancing', 'juggling', 'kid', 'tremendous', 'act', 'Needless', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'slight', 'comic', 'variations', 'Gleason', 'Show', 'who', 'filled', 'out', 'Party', 'episodes', 'year', 'year', 'Fenwick', 'Babbit', 'Poor', 'Soul', 'Joe', 'Bartender', 'Rudy', 'Repairman', 'especially', 'Reggie', 'VanGleason', 'who', 'year', 'brought', 'different', 'band', 'outdid', 'dancing', 'chorus', 'girls.In', 'conclusion', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'MPI', ""'m"", 'nonetheless', 'grateful', 'release', 'recommend', 'essential', 'viewing', 'fans', 'Gleason', 'company']",The Honeymooners: Lost Episodes 1951-1957

This was real television, when it was fun to go home and relax and just enjoy. I would not want these to be colorized, that would just ruin the feel of the show. I can't believe how some people want things colorized. There's nothing wrong seeing things in there original black and white. So let's hope for more of these great shows on DVD.Update: I've watched some episodes and they do sound And look better than the old MPI set. I've also noticed that the episode called  Alice plays Cupid  disc 2 on the 60th Anniversary collection the picture rolls 4 times and in the old MPI set that doesn't happen,so I wonder why that happened. But this is the best Honeymooners set you can buy. If your a true fan who doesn't care about colorization, this is in glorious black n White.Update: another observation on disc 1 on the 60th Ann.edition an episode called (the new television set) with Pert Kelton in the role of Alice,the episode looks really bad and has lots of jumps in the begining. There was a special called The real lost episodes on television which aired on 6/12/94 on the Disney channel, that I have on tape and this episode is there, and it has no jumps and looks so much better than the one on the new MPI set. I don't know why they couldn't get a better copy of this episode. MPI is great, but I think they could have done just a bit better. But I really love this set. I've spent practically all day watching this great collection and it's really terrific.Update: I've watched all the episodes in this collection.

All known surviving segments done live on ""The Cavalcade of Stars"" and ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" from 1951 to 1957 are presented here for Honeymooners fanatics like me. The quality of the kinescopes used on this set are pretty good. I also enjoyed  finally seeing host announcer Jack Lescoulie get some screen time on this set, but too brief in my humble opinion. I have enjoyed reading most of the positive reviews written by people on Amazon but most of them really don't talk too much about the famed original ""Trip To Europe"" musical episodes done by Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Audrey Meadows, and Joyce Randolph. Comparing the original 1957 version to the 1966 version is like comparing apples to oranges, but if forced to tell everyone which version I like I'll go with the original 1957 version. First, the 1957 version was done after the original cast have been together for nearly 5 years. All knew their characters quite well and played them to perfection. Unfortunately Shelia MacRae and Jane Kean, who played Alice and Trixie in the 1960's remakes, were forced to play their characters for the the first time with Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in the remade 1966 version. Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean would eventually make their new roles as Alice and Trixie their own, but not at this point. Art Carney was at his creative peak playing Ed Norton in 1957. He had already won the Emmy 5 times and would later prove to everybody what a great character actor he was on various television shows in the next few years. Unfortunately by the time Art Carney returned to ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" in 1966 he had put on some weight and suffered a nervous breakdown. The fat jokes aren't as funny told by a fatter Art Carney to the more relaxed Jackie Gleason who seemed to love his lifestyle down in Florida better than New York. After completing the musical episodes in 1957, the original cast would only do 2 more skits (unfortunately only 1 survives) before ending it's 1950's run. I noticed that some of the original Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler songs were dropped in ""Curse of the Kramdens"" and ""Framed In Spain"" episodes and new ones were written in their place. ""Hospitality"" and ""You Mustn't Judge A Book By It's Cover""(done in 1966) replaced ""A Kramden Through and Through"" and ""Anything That You Say Is True""(done in 1957). I thought Jackie Gleason and Audrey Meadows sang the original songs better even though the new ones are probably better written tunes. I didn't realize how good Audrey Meadows really sings until I saw these 1957 shows. She and Jackie make quite a singing duo! What I can't understand is how these original ""Trip To Europe"" episodes took so long to get released. They are magical and should of gotten more acclaim back in the 1950's but unfortunately ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" was up against ""The Perry Como Show"" who got better ratings at the time. I hope one day MPI will release the famed ""Adoption"" musical episode that reunited Jackie Gleason with Art Carney, and Audrey Meadows in January 1966. This episode prompted Jackie Gleason to bring back ""The Honeymooners"" in the 1960's.

1456431,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B005E7SEOI,Phil S.,"[77, 79]","I have watched just part of Disc 14 - enough information for this fan (who watched the Honeymooners on first telecasts in the 1950s) to give the package a *****.I find that the June 1, 1957 sketch, Manager of a Baseball Team, looks beautiful for a kinescope...but besides the surprisingly good audio-video, we finally, finally have the final sketch from the '50s! (Needless to say, this episode was listed on three earlier packages which contained a *1953* rendition!).I would have paid the full price for that historic episode on its' own, so my effusiveness can be understood!There is very little material missing here...and both listed and nonlisted items are carefully notated. Hopefully, the apparent next-to-last sketch of May 11th, 1957 will be soon issued.Another two sketches are not included: two 1962 efforts, from the American Scene Magazine, Gleason's return to weekly variety. Carney was back...but no Meadows or Randolph. This, plus the excellent 1966 remake of The Adoption, with Carney and Meadows.For relatively new fans, I'll say that, generally speaking, you will not find ""Classic 39"" quality throughout any entry here - that season was done live on film, which benefitted the actors who could err and not worry that the error will be beamed out to the cosmos; the naturally, the writing and editing was exceptional. There are, shall we say, Classic *sketches* in this collection: i.e., Stars Over Flatbush, Peacemaker, Kramden vs. Norton, One Big Happy Family, Finders Keepers, Boys And Girls Together, etc.)Also found herein is a new interview with Joyce Randolph (Trixie, 1952 to 1957); and old interviews with her TV ""husband"", Art Carney, in character, in various settings, including The Ed Sullivan Show.Another featured extra is a group of Ed Norton ""Interviews"" from that final season. Gleason interviews Norton on current events, the most interesting the announced move by the Brooklyn Dodgers that they will soon be playing three-thousand miles away! The jokes are only mildly mildly funny but the full melancholy of the sports scenario hits a little closer to home: soon the Chauncey Street quartet will be joining the Ebbets Field, ""Sym-Phony"", as depressingly conspicuous by their absence, as well - Ralph, Alice, Norton, and Trixie would not return until 1962.Ellen Burstyn fans, look out!! She's show briefly in the '57 shows as a ""Glea Girl""!All political correctness aside, or should I say generational stereotyping aside, this show offered more than just laughs. We can watch a very underappreciated actor, Jackie Gleason, emote, and make the Charlie Sheens (all due respect) drop their heads. Yes, it sounds corny, but this show had ""heart"". Alice Kramden may have beeen the first TV feminist but her exasperation was couched in true love, respect, and understanding of her blue-collar guy. No effort, as today, to turn the tables on the dude who just doesn't get it.So, take a row seat near the front, look at the drivers' rear view mirror, and let this collection, in tandem with The Classic 39 set (also on Amazon), take you right to the Moon!!!",5,"A long time coming!

1456436,AAJ9VIJDUZ35Z,B005E7SEOI,tvideo,"[5, 12]","First let me say I did not buy this because they advertised it as ""Restored"" and I wasn't expecting much in that area. I have watched most of these in TV Syndication (on WPIX in NY) re-runs that Gleason did in 85 and like most Honeymooner's fans simply wanted the ""complete"" set.As for completeness this is as good as you can get. 15 DVDs with all the Lost Episodes that were on TV as re-runs plus many that were not. So for a fan or collector this is it.Video Quality: I am not sure what they meant by ""restored"" as the source material was taken from the ""Video Tape"" copies made years ago instead of going back to the original masters and doing a new A/D transfer so some episodes due have analog artifacts from the tapes.Audio Quality: The audio NR was completely ""butchered"" by someone who doesn't know how to do proper NR. This is a common amateur job in removing too much of the noise and the actual quality is seriously degraded. As a result some of the audio has a ""ringing noise"" and more commonly a 'tin-can' sound. The proper way would have been to leave some of the ""hiss"" or ""noise"" in, but they removed 100% instead of around 40%-60% - just terrible! Obviously not done by a professional audio engineer.On an interesting note, the credits in the booklet state ""Video Restoration: UCLA Film & Television Archive"" which would presumably also include the audio, so a bunch of college kids tried to use Adobe NR? Or perhaps the professor wanted to show them that ""this"" is NOT how proper audio NR is done and mistakenly put the crap tracks on the master discs? Whatever the reason as I stated the audio NR is not properly done by a professional studio/engineer it was obviously done by someone who never did this before...shame as it really hurts the collection.Overall: If you want a complete set, plus all the extras and you can live with the poor remastering then this is a good set.Personally I don't like cheap ""remastering"" and they could have taken the time to pay a professional studio to do this properly or simply left the audio as it was, as it's better then this crap, considering this is an $80 set.

A real gentleman who treated everyone with respect.My wife's grandfather was a tailor and Jackie was a regular customer (as was Tony Randall).
