1625034,A3FCLVBY9O5DOS,B00BC5FN2C,A Customer,"[7, 15]","The early episodes of this series are entertaining, but it dissolves into slackness, irrelevance, and a repulsive mixture of sentimentality and sleaze.  And there's something scary about it.  The British House of Cards is the straightforward tale of a paleo-conservative politician who gets fed up with the treachery and hypocrisy of his post-Thatcherite, neo-conservative colleagues and goes on a well-conducted rampage that leaves him as Prime Minister-- the boss. His opponents in the labor party are somewhat peripheral to his story, but they do have a presence, and there is a sense that a democratic government is functioning, however ""dysfunctionally."" The American House of Cards is a twisted tale of a-- what?--a southern Democrat who gets fed up with-- what?-- the treachery and hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and goes on a-- what?-- a series of improbable machinations that continually blow up in his face and that leave him-- where?-- as the vice-president--the flunky.  Meanwhile, the Republican Party is virtually invisible-- there's no sense that even a two-party democracy is functioning.So what does it all mean?  The British series means that paleo-conservatism can become very dangerous as it is repressed and disguised by bland political correctness-- and that is true-- as history has shown.  Francis Urquhart, the paleo-tory, is no fool, and a lot of what he says makes sense.  An American series could have said very much the same thing, because  the same is true of American paleo-conservatism.  But the series' creators apparently are so afraid of American paleo-conservatives that they can't even bring themselves to mention them.  So they give us Francis Underwood, a greedy, mean fool who makes very little sense about anything.A footnote: one of the series' sleazier aspects is the ignorant and distorted way it tries to exploit environmentalism. Just  one minor example: A very smart nuclear power tycoon like the one in the final episode might be a birding hobbyist, but if he was he would know that sun conures don't much resemble the extinct Louisiana parakeet (except that both are medium-sized parrots) and that wood thrushes breed (and therefore sing)  in the woods around Saint Louis, Missouri, not hermit thrushes.",2,Invisible Republicans,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2255,"['early', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'entertaining', 'slackness', 'irrelevance', 'repulsive', 'mixture', 'sentimentality', 'sleaze', 'something', 'scary', 'British', 'House', 'Cards', 'straightforward', 'tale', 'paleo-conservative', 'politician', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'treachery', 'hypocrisy', 'post-Thatcherite', 'neo-conservative', 'colleagues', 'well-conducted', 'rampage', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'boss', 'opponents', 'labor', 'party', 'are', 'somewhat', 'peripheral', 'story', 'do', 'have', 'presence', 'sense', 'democratic', 'government', 'functioning', 'however', 'dysfunctionally', 'American', 'House', 'Cards', 'twisted', 'tale', 'what', 'southern', 'Democrat', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'what', 'treachery', 'hypocrisy', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'what', 'series', 'improbable', 'machinations', 'continually', 'blow', 'up', 'face', 'leave', 'where', 'vice-president', 'flunky', 'Meanwhile', 'Republican', 'Party', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'sense', 'even', 'two-party', 'democracy', 'functioning.So', 'what', 'mean', 'British', 'series', 'paleo-conservatism', 'can', 'become', 'very', 'dangerous', 'repressed', 'disguised', 'bland', 'political', 'correctness', 'true', 'history', 'shown', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'paleo-tory', 'fool', 'lot', 'what', 'sense', 'American', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'true', 'American', 'paleo-conservatism', 'series', 'creators', 'apparently', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'American', 'paleo-conservatives', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'mention', 'give', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'greedy', 'mean', 'fool', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'anything.A', 'footnote', 'one', 'series', 'sleazier', 'aspects', 'ignorant', 'distorted', 'way', 'exploit', 'environmentalism', 'Just', 'one', 'minor', 'example', 'very', 'smart', 'nuclear', 'power', 'tycoon', 'one', 'final', 'episode', 'might', 'be', 'birding', 'hobbyist', 'was', 'would', 'know', 'sun', 'conures', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'resemble', 'extinct', 'Louisiana', 'parakeet', 'are', 'medium-sized', 'parrots', 'wood', 'thrushes', 'breed', 'therefore', 'sing', 'woods', 'Saint', 'Louis', 'Missouri', 'not', 'hermit', 'thrushes']",N/A

1625036,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00BC5FN2C,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","The American version of HOUSE OF CARDS will always hold a secure niche in television trivia as the first serial drama to be released in streaming form by Netflix without having first gone through broadcast, cable, or disc.  This should not obscure the twin facts that Season One of HOC, the show's first thirteen episodes, are now available on disc at much more reasonable prices than when first released.  Second and more important, it is fine television drama that will go down as among the very best.Washington, D.C., and how it functions -- how it really functions, as opposed to the high-minded pronouncements that littered Aaron Sorkin's otherwise well-crafted THE WEST WING -- is the focus of House of Cards.  Its central character is Francis (""Frank"") Underwood, fictional House Majority Whip, a Democrat during the administration of a highly ineffectual Democratic President.  The President reneges on a promise to Frank to make him Secretary of State, and Frank engages his massive skills in double-dealing, hypocrisy, naked power plays and false allegiance to get even.  The sophisticated and well-written script  obviates the need to lecture us in Realpolitik like ""keep your friends close, but your enemies closer,"" or to make mention of Sun Tzu or Machiavelli, but in Frank we see all such principles in action.  Frank's wife and usually faithful companion is Claire (Robin Wright, a star turn in a series filled with strong performances), a svelte and well-groomed power player who heads a vacuous environmental NGO whose unstated mission is to grow in power and funding rather than to clean the water.  To this end, she fires half her staff in order to ""shift resources"" to international operations but proves ineffectual in getting water-filtration equipment past the customs of an impoverished African country.  But never mind that: as she and Frank grow in visibility as a Washington Power Couple they engage a media strategist to ""get the word out . . .  as little as possible.""This is the first modern teleplay or movie I recall that speaks as official Washington speaks, not as we think it ought to speak.  When there is something to be done by a federal agency, these players do not say ""What happens now?"" or ""What are we supposed to do?"" but ""Who do we know there?"" which in today's Dee Cee is the pragmatic response.  When an underling offers an unwelcome pair of ears at an impromptu meeting, he or she will hear not ""Will you excuse us?"" but ""Can you give us two seconds?""  This truth-telling extends to the numerous asides Frank makes to us viewers, and even though we come to dislike the man for his ultimately feral personality (""I DESPISE children""), in Kevin Spacey's assured playing we maintain a measure of identification with him even when they contradict his hypocritical actions.  (Attending, unhappily, a belabored Civil War re-enactment in Season Two, he shares ""Never raise your flag for an asinine cause like slavery,"" which is sure to ramp up our delight in his character.)Now, I don't mean to say that I approve of the way this country has been heading, but I do appreciate House of Cards' unflinching attitude in revealing the amoralism that pervades so much of post-Watergate government.  The individual citizen -- the voter -- and his concerns are almost off the map here, except as banner-waving stooges for a television photo op, or as codified through statistics (""the Electorate"").  A dose of verisimilitude comes from clips of real news figures like Donna Brazile, George Stephanopoulos and Sean Hannity taking apparent delight in the role they play in the manufacturing of opinion, the process by which a ""dark horse"" candidate for a Cabinet post is made to seem the only logical choice for the job, or a minor Congressional figure slotted into major responsibility and power. Underwood and other big shots speak openly of ""the narrative"" of ticklish situations.  Cynical, yes, but also realistic.My own gripe?  Ironically, it's one of style more than substance.  House of Cards does so well in establishing mood that it tends to go overboard with moody understatement in most of its scenes.  Jeff Beal's music, which superbly underscores the show's opening montage symbolizing a republic in decline, is overused too much in the dramatic sequences, injecting darkness even in relatively light or neutral scenes.  Similarly, the interior decor in this show too often portrays a witless austerity of neutral single-color walls and furniture that's either capuccino or dark capuccino.  (Did they have to use that same Restoration Hardware chandelier over and over?)  Add to this the fact that this is one of the most relentlessly underlit American shows ever filmed, and too often we're getting an overload of understatement that is quite unnecessary in light of the way this show so well conveys mood, character, and the major characters' frequent duplicities whether in bed or in the halls of power.After taking care of an unreliable colleague, Frank gets kicked upstairs while making it seem like anyone's doing but his own.  His story, and Claire's, continue in year two of House of Cards.  I hope that it, too, is soon put on DVD.",5,"""I swear to God I'll make it my mission not only to destroy your careers but to obliterate all [your] hope and happiness...""",1396224000,"03 31,

Once through that, the elegance of the scene settings, the seemingly authentic depiction of government bureaucracy, the minor character details all combined to create a portrait of what felt like real life characters, making real life compromises. It almost felt like i was in Washington and with Underwood's occasional asides straight to the camera, incorporating the viewer as confidant, the conceit works magnificently. The scene with Underwood preaching in a church, then stopping dead smack in the middle of the oration, with over one hundred and fifty people in the pews, to speak directly to the camera about how he needs to manipulate the social  values of the congregation he understands so well, in order to  get the deal he needs, is heartstopping both in its audacity and comprehension of small town mores.As the show progresses, Underwood, becomes more and more unlikable, because of the acts he is willing to perform in order to achieve his ultimate goal. But the methods he reveals and the zest with which he undertakes his cause created an unnatural appeal to the character for me. Life, it is said, finds a way.

1625048,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BC5FN2C,Anthony L.,"[2, 3]","House of Cards is fantastic. Why? Well, start with a talented director like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network), or Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, Phone Booth, The Client), throw in 2-time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, American Beauty), Golden Globe nominee Robin Wright (Forrest Gump, The Pledge), and a slew of other talented cast members. Add to that a razor-sharp script, nail-biting tension, wryly funny moments, realistic situations and drama, and characters that allow each actor to shine, and, well, you have something fantastic!Kevin Spacey is deliciously cunning and pure evil as Francis Underwood. He is an actor that gives consistently good performances (Like James Gandolfini or Gary Oldman), and he is positively riveting here! His habit of breaking the fourth wall brings the audience closer into his tangled web of deceit, lies, and cunning! And it is delicious to behold. Robin Wright gives perhaps her BEST role yet as Francis Underwood's kind but brilliant wife Claire! The rest of the distinguished cast is on par. No faults there!The scripts are very entertaining, and cover a wide variety of subjects. There's humour in here too. Just look at Frank's chillingly realistic onscreen meltdown (""You wanna play the vowel game? U - O - I - AN - APOLOGY""). The tit-for-tat protests between two rival groups come straight from something you'd see on the news, and make for entertaining watching!On the whole, House of Cards has a lot of strong points! It's perhaps funner than it's British predecessor, and the writing is sharp and strong, the plots realistic, the character's deliciously deceitful, the acting is superb, and the direction, cinematography, and score are all fantastic. It is an underrated show that should get more recognition.But perhaps we should not find it so entertaining; it is very relevant to modern-day American politics, and, while fictional, gives us a chilling look inside the tangled, pitch-black web of lies, deceit, and empty promises that comprise the house of cards of politics today - a scary world where no one can trust anybody else, where the public are played like pawns, and where the most ruthless, cunning, and cold triumph over the weak.P.S.

1625054,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00BC5FN2C,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Francis Underwood is an ambitious American politician. When a promised cabinet position is given to someone else, Underwoord embarks upon a Machiavellian scheme to get revenge and place himself at the centre of American political power.House of Cards started life as a trilogy of novels written by Michael Dobbs, a British politician and senior member of the Conservative Party. The books were adapted for the BBC with Ian Richardson playing the scheming Francis Urquhart, who rises from his party whip to a more senior position through a combination of political acumen, blackmail, engineering scandals and, as a matter of last resort, murder. Both the book and TV series examined politics, power, the media and corruption, with their dialogue forming catchphrases still used in modern British politics. The series is regarded as a classic, with Richardson's portrayal of the monstrous Urquhart being a masterclass in screen villainy.Two and a half decades later, we have the American remake. The action is moved to Washington, D.C. and the story is modified to take into account a much greater running time (thirteen episodes per season compared to the British four), a much larger cast and changes in technology in the intervening years. In particular, the journalist subplot is now modified to take into account the growing influence of social media on modern politics, picking up on themes previously seen in the final season of The Wire (although, like that season, House of Cards struggles to say much beyond the obvious about the decline of print journalism). Obviously the politics are tweaked to match the American political system. Despite all of that the original story shines through, enough that if you are familiar with the original than the plot risks becoming predictable.Fortunately, this problem is reduced by the sheer quality of the production. This is a glossy, expensive series with a cast of top-drawer American talent. Familiar faces Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright anchor the production through intense performances. Spacey hides steel and resolve behind a veneer of Southern courtesy and charm, an effective device which starts to wear a little thin by the end of the series. Underwood's machinations are impressive, but his utter contempt for those he considers inferior and whom he doesn't need is so obvious that it's questionable if he would have really gained the reputation he has in the series. One episode, in which Underwood is reunited with his old military college buddies, hints at a much lighter and more fun person that Underwood has had to suppress in furtherance of his career, but it's the only moment where character or emotional development takes place. The asides to camera from the original series are also retained, although they are a little bit more inexplicable in this new version: Richardson dominated the original series and was in the overwhelming majority of scenes, so it made more sense. Here the cast is more of an ensemble and just one of them breaking the fourth wall feels a little pointless . It also doesn't help that many of these asides are either random (&#34;I detest children. There, I've said it!&#34;) or tell us the obvious, but Spacey sells even the tritest lines with conviction and menace.Wright's performance as Claire is more impressive. Claire is a more complex figure, as ruthless as Underwood in some respects but also possessing (slightly) more of a conscience. She also has more regrets about how much pursuing her husband's career and developing her own (as the head of a charity) has forced her to sacrifice her personal desires. If Underwood has no real character growth in the series, Claire makes up for it, especially when their objectives clash.The rest of the cast is effective, with Corey Stoll charismatically playing congressman Peter Russo, a man of conviction and integrity whose life is undermined by substance abuse and conscience-shattering political compromises. Russo's character arc is somewhat mechanical and predictable (especially if you've seen the original series) but the actor manages to sell even the more eyebrow-raising character turns. Kata Mara is also effective in her role as journalist Zoe Barnes. Whilst Barnes's character arc is reasonably well-done (believing herself to be in a role of mutual manipulation with Underwood, which turns into a realisation she may have been cynically used to help his planned ascent to power), her choices and decisions make her a less than likable figure, which is a refreshing choice for what is presented as the leading female protagonist of the series.The show is mostly well-written, though not as well-written as it thinks it is. There is a thin line between profundity and pretension and the show makes a habit of stumbling into the latter whilst searching for the former. The writing aims to make the dialogue snappy, intelligent and witty and succeeds more than it does not, but when it fails the dialogue can become leaden, over-expositionary and redundant. Some of these issues are artifacts of the massively expanded running time: by the end of the first season of thirteen episodes, the story has not even reached the end of the first British season of just four. There's a huge amount of filler in the middle episodes, some of it well-handled but a lot of it just feels pointless (the 'Peachoid' incident most notably). It might be wished that the show had more ambitiously adapted the entire original British series (twelve episodes in total) and had left it at that. Structurally, this expansion to (at least) thirty-nine episodes feels like the show is bloating itself out too much in the name of commercial success.Still, as often as the show stumbles and as padded as it is, the first season of House of Cards (****) is still a success, driven forward by splendid performances and a coldly cynical assessment of how American politics work.",4,Well-written but a

1625055,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B00BC5FN2C,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[5, 11]","""House Of Cards: The Complete First Season""(Netflix, 2013). . .Well, consider me (and my wife) in the minority. While this series seems to have met with universal, slavering praise, we found it nearly unwatchable -- a deathly, deathly dull show that moves slowly, has few if any compelling characters and yet is defined by its own extreme, overweening sense of self-love. Kevin Spacey is frequently lauded for performance as the show's puppetmaster, Congressional whip Frank Underwood, a portrayal that, while icy and reptilian, was hardly the grand, Shakespearian tour-de-force described by the critics, no matter how many asides he makes to the camera. Indeed, Spacey's one great acting innovation seems to be the creation of a performance that is fawning of itself -- he embodies the same oozing self-satisfaction as the show itself, and while you may argue that this is just an actor showing this ""winning"" trait in the character he portrays, it would be a more effective argument if that same sense of puffery didn't suffuse every other aspect of the program.""House Of Cards,"" adapted from a similarly chilly British political thriller, is symptomatic of the current wave of anti-politicianism that has gripped America in the last couple of decades and seems to have peaked since the 2012 elections. Other, equally flawed, shows in this genre include Kelsey Grammar's ""Boss,"" and the dreadful, dreadful ""Veep,"" starring Julia Louis Dreyfus, which traffic in cheap, sneering cynicism and prepackaged disillusionment. The Netflix series is better than either of those shows, but just barely. It relies on the current zeitgeist of extreme disaffection and discontent -- a social environment that borders on national hysteria -- to draw its viewers in. But seen outside of this contemporary context, the irony-laden story arc appears flat and lazily crafted. What are intended to be great Machiavellian stratagems are laughable on the surface: would a scheming kingmaker really recruit a disgraced cokehead as his political catspaw, when there are so many other willing stooges in the world, ones who come without delerium tremens and bad press? Or that a dude as homely as Kevin Spacey would cheat on a wife as foxy as Robin Wright?""House Of Cards"" poses itself as world-wise and capable of peeling back all the lies to reveal how government ""really"" works, but most of what it presents is leaden and unconvincing. There are many shows and books that do it better, not the least of which is the late, great, infinitely more resonant ""West Wing,"" which also gave off a whiff of I'm-so-cleverness, but had more intellectual substance and dramatic heft to back it up. ""House Of Cards"" is a bleak, simplistic, mean-spirited show that accurately reflects the knee-jerk cynicism of the era -- it captures the time it was made in, but that's not saying much, and is certainly not a compelling reason to watch it, even if you're able to slog all the way through every tedious episode.

1625077,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B00BC5FN2C,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[0, 0]","Perhaps the one word to sum up what House of Cards is all about is AMBITION and INFLUENCE PEDDLING. The setting is Capitol Hill and the White House, Washington DC. The focus is House Majority Whip Frank Underwood and his wife, Claire, who heads a blandly named non-profit organization, the ""Clean Water Initiative"".This is a case study in career strategies, jealousy, and mutual back-scratching (back-stabbing?) in the heated and hedonistic atmosphere of Washington politics. The crackling tension between the hard-boiled characters, both male and female, and the chess-like interplay of the web of relationships, projects House of Cards head and shoulders above other dramas. It is a delight to see exquisite writing and acting used in a dramatic television series to depict something other than police and detective work...a worn-out genre, overplayed for decades.The acting is amazing. (A backhanded way of saying the casting is completely brilliant.) This is the best thing Kevin Spacey (as House Majority Whip Frank Underwood) has ever been in. Period. And I'm including LA Confidential and American Beauty. He is certainly in his element here, the dark anti-hero of a toxic and deadly inside world of manipulation, and I think will be remembered for ""Cards"" at least as much for anything he has ever done.Robin Wright is Underwood's wife, mixing her cunning drive behind an icily professional demeanor, always seemingly on the threshold of burnout, and incapable of genuine warmth...only a reasonable facsimile. Kate Mara is the ambitious young journalist who rides Underwood's coattails to success, but ends up getting more than she bargained for. And Corey Stoll is a young but alcoholic congressman from Pennsylvania who perches precariously on a precipice between glorious success and absolute ruin.The production budgets feel limitless. You will see a lot of money up there on the screen in extras and locations. Jeff Beal's music score work is dark, moody, and chilling -- absolutely indispensable to the ambience of the whole series, a real bullseye.And the one minute sequence at the beginning of each episode, containing stunning time lapse shots of DC landscapes, combined with Beal's music, adds up to the most evocative, ground-breaking open title since 1965's Hawaii Five-O. By shooting timelapse of DC scapes, the series expresses the idea that we will have an omniscient perspective of the goings-on in Washington, on a very personal level.David Fincher (who directed the first two episodes) was right.

Just so readers know where this reviewer is coming from, I'm more a fan of dark fantasy, science fiction and philosophical or psychological thrillers.  HANNIBAL and THE FOLLOWING both got top reviews from me, for example.So it was no surprise when I watched the first episode of HOUSE OF CARDS that I found myself feeling a bit bored and restless.  Even though I have been a fan of Kevin Spacey for years (K-PAX and 21 are among my favorites), I kept feeling like this character was just over-the-top rotten-to-the-core - quite by choice and just because he COULD be.  But... of course... I needed to shift gears from the more &#34;hopeful&#34; genres and remember that politics IS an arena of over-the-top-rotten-to-the-core &#34;human&#34;(?) beings who would just as soon put a knife in a colleague's back as not - and not always for any quantifiable gain, but often just to keep that person in line and under control.Control.  That's really the name of the game where HOUSE OF CARDS is concerned.  It's not about the soap-opera machinations of the characters as they lie and cheat their way through the nation's capitol - it's about maintaining control in an environment where every other snake on the hill is just as deadly as the one in your mirror.  And the character played by Kevin Spacey is the undisputed master of this dangerous and deadly game.  The series as a whole is a character study of the psychopaths and sociopaths who run the country - and the president is the least of them in the end, just another puppet on the strings of the power brokers running the side show from behind the scenes.I particularly enjoyed the character of Zoe Barnes (played by Kate Mara).  As ruthless and nasty as Spacey's character can be, Zoe is his female counterpart - a woman looking to get ahead in the world even if it means crawling over bleeding bodies to do it.  Refreshing to see a female character written and played with such a biting edge.Overall, season one of HOUSE OF CARDS gets better as it goes along.  There are very few extraneous characters, and those we might originally think aren't necessary almost always turn up later on to throw a monkey wrench into some well-oiled plot.

1625127,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00BC5FN2C,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","The project to remake HOUSE OF CARDS, Michael Dobbs' satire of political life, must have been a daunting one. The British miniseries not only succeeded on both sides of the Atlantic - even though focusing on Thatcherite politics and their consequences - but contained a definitive performance by Ian Richardson as the reptilian Francis Urquhart (aka FU), whose scheming could have put Machiavelli to shame. In this remake, transplanted to the White House, Kevin Spacey plays Francis Underwood, who comes across as superficially more attractive than his British counterpart. We would like to trust this man, as he seems so eminently plausible. But we should remember that Spacey has played Richard III on stage recently (2011), and should be well versed in the ways of the Machiavel. Underwood's wife Claire (Robin Wright) seems far more fearsome in the way she deals with her staff, picking them up and throwing them away once they have outlived their usefulness. To continue the Shakespearean analogy - and I believe this is conscious on the part of principal writer Beau Willimon and his team - the two of them combine the charm and the ruthlessness of the Macbeths. No one, it seems, can stand in their way. HOUSE OF CARDS is a prestige drama that has attracted considerable talent - David Fincher and Joel Schumacher each directed two episodes of Season One. In structural terms the American remake is more leisurely than its British counterpart (it has thirteen rather than four episodes), but this allows us time to get to know the characters as well as gain an insight into the corridors of power. For non-Americans HOUSE OF CARDS gives a penetrating, if somewhat jaundiced, insight into the way in which the American government works - or doesn't work, especially for those lacking the skills to manipulate their colleagues.",4,Powerful Remake of a British Classic,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1832,"['project', 'remake', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'CARDS', 'Michael', 'Dobbs', 'satire', 'political', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'daunting', 'one', 'British', 'miniseries', 'not', 'only', 'succeeded', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'even', 'focusing', 'Thatcherite', 'politics', 'consequences', 'contained', 'definitive', 'performance', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'reptilian', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'FU', 'scheming', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'Machiavelli', 'shame', 'remake', 'transplanted', 'White', 'House', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'who', 'superficially', 'more', 'attractive', 'British', 'counterpart', 'would', 'like', 'trust', 'man', 'so', 'eminently', 'plausible', 'should', 'remember', 'Spacey', 'played', 'Richard', 'III', 'stage', 'recently', '2011', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'versed', 'ways', 'Machiavel', 'Underwood', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'far', 'more', 'fearsome', 'way', 'staff', 'picking', 'up', 'throwing', 'away', 'have', 'outlived', 'usefulness', 'continue', 'Shakespearean', 'analogy', 'believe', 'conscious', 'part', 'principal', 'writer', 'Beau', 'Willimon', 'team', 'two', 'combine', 'charm', 'ruthlessness', 'Macbeths', 'one', 'can', 'stand', 'way', 'HOUSE', 'CARDS', 'prestige', 'drama', 'attracted', 'considerable', 'talent', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'directed', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'structural', 'terms', 'American', 'remake', 'more', 'leisurely', 'British', 'counterpart', 'thirteen', 'rather', 'four', 'episodes', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'gain', 'insight', 'corridors', 'power', 'non-Americans', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'CARDS', 'penetrating', 'somewhat', 'jaundiced', 'insight', 'way', 'American', 'government', ""n't"", 'work', 'especially', 'lacking', 'skills', 'manipulate', 'colleagues']",N/A

""eblunt777""","[3, 3]","Emily over at BluntReview (dot) com says: House of Cards is one of the scariest dramas this viewer has ever seen - and that includes both seasons of American Horror Story. The reason HoC's is so intense? Simple: it plays so terribly true.Politics are known to be a tad nasty. But, you aint seen nothun' yet.Story goes...Your about to get a peek behind that curtain. But know now this is an adult geared drama fine tuned into a heady work of fiction so real, you want to see the consulting credits.Through one particularly creepy Senator, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), we watch as people we voted in to office finagle Bills, puppet people like modern day Geppettos, and ambitious career climbers' find themselves sunk deeply into the left pocket of some game they're playing; for no other reason than a favor is needed by an opposing member...or for an agenda planned well down-the-road.In the role of loving wife you are served one Claire Underwood (Robin Wright). She is a smart, conniving, shapely barracuda disguised in the season's finest frocks. Slithering beside Claire, as Underwood's personal lap dog we meet Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Yeah, if that lap dog was a rabid Maltese with its eye on a prime rib...in or out of the source's anatomy.And ladies and gentlemen, may we introduce rising journalist Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara). Here's a chickbabe that doesn't mind using - and being used. Where is she getting those scoops?Finally, but certainly not to be out done in anything-for-the-career is a young go-get-'er other-side-of-the-shipyard politician in the hairs of Underwood's plans, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). This guy will make your jaw drop a few times at the shear depths he's willing to peruse in the name of personal success.Everyone in and around the plots and subplots of House of Cards is riveting. The lengths the characters go to for...well what ever it is they want - and here read WANT! - complete with a foot-stamping tantrum in mind. Each episode intertwines a personal life soap operetta with the everyday cogs-in-motion of a few people in various stages of political power. You watch in horror as ""We the People,"" vote in these masked pontificators, who with our unknowing nods of approval, cut 12000 jobs to garner a mere 3000 for no other reason than it suits their personal agendas or that of the corporation that supports their campaign.As all the remarkable drama unravels you may start to feel a bit heavy-hearted, as the realization that this ""show"" is part of what happens in our government branches happens every single day...It is politics as usual in deed.That being typed, there's nothing as usual from this cast. The acting is precise; look at the cast. Kevin Spacey as Underwood is gonna give you acid reflux. You know this person under another name, is up at ""The Hill"" weaving Bills and laws without an iota of care for where his constituents chips may fall. And Mr. Spacey does bad so good.Stoll as Russo makes your skin crawl. He's just an ass. But his pliability by those larger up on the political food chain knows at your comfort level. You may need a jar of caramel sauce handy for quick infusions of happy endorphins; the chemicals and high fructose corn-syrup subsidy in today's decadent faux creation seems entirely appropriate.But even as the men are swimming amongst the sharks, it is truly the gals that tend to steal the show. The womens' roles are smartly written and there are no wilting flowers in this bunch of grab-you-by-the-throat ladies. Zoe is chilling. Claire is a delight to watch weave her web of decided devotion vs. self-agenda.Uber-talent, Robin Wright, plays Claire on a razor's edge. Just when you think she's got a pulse, she'll go and, well, do something, momentarily reminding you just how sociopathic she has become. Ambition is the undercurrent for both she and Zoe.And Kate Mara takes her version of Zoe from a persona-to-the-world of a doe-eyed newbie, to the werewolf headline seeker she is in 0-to-80. Zoe's goal is to be someone - and to hell with anyone in her way. Brava Ms. Mara.

I don't like what the writers did but would rather not point to specifics for fear of spoiling the plot for others. by the last episode it seemed all over the place even as the characters are all patting themselves on the back for tying it all together nicely. this makes me appreciate the art and craft of a long standing series such as The Sopranos which never felt forced despite the heavy handed violence and endless assortment of pasta. indeed, Congressman Frank Underwood seems to have a Mafia complex, except that real mobsters or even made up ones don't stare into the camera smugly and talk to the viewer one on one. a clever mechanism that distinguishes the show for having its own shtick.this show has a lot of potential and I certainly believe it's a clear nod to Glenn Close's character and the show she stars in. ruthless powerful female characters are far more intriguing than male ones but the creators have gone great lengths to challenge that notion. there is so much room for Kevin Spacey's character to stretch out I just hope they pace themselves; you don't have to build an elaborate coaster to take us for a ride.",4,entertaining,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1884,"['working', 'title', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'Mixed"", 'Bag', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anything', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'productive', 'being', 'writer', 'producer', 'show', 'sitting', 'down', 'read', 'viewers', 'reviews', 'here', 'mine', 'first', 'foremost', 'entertaining', 'went', 'entire', 'season', '2', 'days', 'had', 'much', 'fun', 'did', 'Mad', 'Men', 'marathon', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'got', 'more', 'bite', 'Don', 'Draper', 'entire', 'crew', 'put', 'together', 'period', 'distract', 'story', 'story', 'what', 'heck', 'happened', 'script', 'equivalent', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'end', 'was', 'dizzy', 'establishing', 'arc', 'characters', 'building', 'up', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'sound', 'unleashing', 'everyone', 'aftermath', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'writers', 'did', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'point', 'specifics', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'others', 'last', 'episode', 'seemed', 'place', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'patting', 'back', 'tying', 'together', 'nicely', 'appreciate', 'art', 'craft', 'long', 'standing', 'series', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'never', 'felt', 'forced', 'heavy', 'handed', 'violence', 'endless', 'assortment', 'pasta', 'indeed', 'Congressman', 'Frank', 'Underwood', 'have', 'Mafia', 'complex', 'real', 'mobsters', 'even', 'made', 'up', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'stare', 'camera', 'smugly', 'talk', 'viewer', 'one', 'one', 'clever', 'mechanism', 'show', 'having', 'own', 'shtick.this', 'show', 'lot', 'potential', 'certainly', 'believe', 'clear', 'nod', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'character', 'show', 'ruthless', 'powerful', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'intriguing', 'male', 'ones', 'creators', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'challenge', 'notion', 'so', 'much', 'room', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'stretch', 'out', 'just', 'hope', 'pace', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'build', 'elaborate', 'coaster', 'take', 'ride']",N/A

No such luck here. In this outing, the people of the United States barely exist in the minds of government. They are fodder for those seeking to gain, or seeking to stay in, power.Here's the scoop. Kevin Spacey plays congressman Frank Underwood, a very bright, savvy individual who knows his way around Capitol Hill. He knows how to get things done because he knows what's in people's souls and how to play them to his advantage. His wife, Claire (Robin Wright) heads up a a more socially conscious organization in the private sector but is no less addicted to power than her husband. They have a peculiar relationship to say the least. This is almost a diary of the various 'projects' in which they are involved and how they play them, even when unforeseen things happen.This is some ugly, scary stuff. In my heart of hearts I don't want to believe this view of our government, but I fear it is probably a closer take on reality than is ""The West Wing."" The manipulation of people, the press and other politicians will make you puke in your shorts. The relationship between Frank and Claire alone can only make me wonder what world they must have lived in as children that allowed them to grow up in a way that would make them think behavior like this was Okay.David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) helmed the first 2 episodes and well establishes the color and tone for the rest of the series. There is a greenish pallor to it which gives it a sickly feel. All the acting is top shelf and a fleet of veterans are on hand to insure that. The directing is good. The writing is exceptional.

It was so good I was keeping my expectations tempered for fear of a watered down American version. But this US version is very well done. Brilliant even. Full of detail and nuance. Impeccable casting. Kevin Spacey is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood and the script is worthy of his talents. The same can be said of the entire cast. This is a very different story from its British counterpart though. Yes, it's about politics and greed and betrayal, but from a different angle juxtaposed to what the Brits did. Both series are top notch thrillers in their own unique way.House of Cards illustrates the seedy underbelly of politics. If you really want to get a sense of how politics corrupts, how people can rationalize their corrupt acts -including murder- and still sleep at night, here is a great teacher. You witness first hand the enormous pressure elected representatives face in order to go-along-to-get-along. You come to realize that reform from within is made architecturally impossible.While viewing this series I was watching Kevin Spacey's character (an influential congressman) look his friends/associates directly in the eye and tell the most sincere of lies without a blink of his own eye. All to benefit his own personal agenda. I was reminded of another series about people in positions of power that portrayed the exact same behavior... The Sopranos.

Angry and humiliated, he and his wife put into motion a Machiavellian scheme to destroy the President and launch Underwood himself to even greater power. Along the way it seems everyone in Washington is a slimeball, and those who aren't are corrupted by the Underwoods or by the kindly-seeming Warren Buffet type billionaire who is the behind the scenes puppet master. As the deceptions and plots mount, murder may also be on the menu.The cast is great. As always, Spacey is mesmerizing as the seductive, yet repellant Frank Underwood.  But it is Robin Wright who steals the show with the most rounded, three dimensional portrait of a villain you may ever see. Most villains in fiction are aware they are evil, but Claire Underwood, like a real life villain, feels justification for most of what she does and only rarely sees her actions as evil. However, Wright and the writers occasionally allow Claire to see herself for what she is, and it is these moments that Robin Wright just nails: the confusion, sadness, and self loathing that soon returns to self-justification.

Because the British original with Ian Richardson as the plausibly charming but malevolent chief whip of the Tory government in the House of Commons was so pitch perfect. Nevertheless, I decided to order it along with the BluRay of the original British series, ""House of Cards"" (which, since it has been remastered, is *splendid*).Although Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright turn in outstanding performances in their roles as the formidable Chief Whip and his even more formidable wife, who share an almost mesmeric relationship in their marriage, and the series kept me absorbed from episode to episode, I had to divorce myself from the British original and consider the series on its own terms in order to enjoy it. You will enjoy it, too, if you do not compare it to the original.That being said, the story has become transmogrified beyond recognition in its journey across the Atlantic. The pace has become far more leisurely than the original that had me glued to my seat for every episode. Unlike Francis Urquhart, whose evident charm and polished manners drew me into his spell--his initially confidential asides put me in the position of a willing co-conspirator, enjoying the intrigue, until I gradually realised that I had been trapped, unable to evade his eyes, which had taken on the aspect of a cobra's--Francis Underwood [Urquhart's American counterpart] is unmitigatedly nasty from the get-go. In fact, I found him and all of the Washington characters charmless. The series has also lost its sense of humour, and what was subtly suggested has become rather coarsely stated.I do think that the scenario works better in the Westminster parliamentary context, since the seductive dynamic of power was turned on its head in the American Production by making Francis Underwood visit his little reporter in her tacky downmarket apartment.

Take for example the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) policy of removing wild horses from our public lands.  After being rounded up by the thousands with helicopters over the last 4 years, there are 50,000 wild horses now being held in warehouses, paid for with the tax dollar, thanks to the BLM's firm cooperation with ranchers and the livestock industry who view wild horses as ""competition for cheap tax-payer subsidized livestock grazing on public lands.""  It's a costly tragedy paid for by tax-payers that has NO PUBLIC SUPPORT - -  but then, as House of Cards so amply demonstrates, it's not REALLY about what the public wants - it's about what INDUSTRY wants.  And industry finances the politicians, who make the laws -  ultimately spending our hard-earned tax dollars on programs - such as the current livestock industry/BLM war on America's wild horses.

I'm on the third episode, and honestly, it's grating to anyone with intelligence that follows the news and politics. I also have been able to decipher what's just wrong with this show. The characters are all unlikable. No one is likable. Most of the main characters are evil schemers that always outsmart their enemies, who are nothing but complete, unwitting dopes, ripe for the plucking. DC is basically some version of hell, with everyone at war with everyone else, unhappy with their place in life. The characters don't seem realistic at all, just caricatures from TV shows and movies from long ago. There is no balance in this world. It's just the very bad, and the very stupid. Having watched Fincher movies for years, it's not hard to figure out his schtick, creating pseudo-dark worlds in which everyone is bitter about everything, with no joy or chance of joy for the rest of their lives.I have to admit, while I don't live in DC and know the type of people that live there, I do know something about political platforms and beliefs that people hold. That's where this show fails miserably. Characters talk about political beliefs and platforms with ZERO conviction!!! This is something that politicians fight tooth and nail over! The education plan discussed in the show was hilarious. The characters are just reading from cue cards, which was probably copy and pasted from wikipedia or something. These people know exactly where they stand with their beliefs, and everyone else, from their allies, lobbyists to their enemies know where they stand as well. In episode 2, the secretary of state candidate withdraws because an editorial surfaces where he calls he Israeli occupation of Gaza or whatever illegal. It raises such an uproar that he eventually is booted. Come on. Assuming he's a Democrat, I'm quite certain his allies support his views and that everyone pretty much knows his views about the matter. Furthermore, it was an editorial from decades ago. Like anyone would seriously take that seriously in 2013. Very likely, his views could have changed! I fail to see how this would be held against him.The education issue offends me the most, because no effort is made to talk about how much of a failure all these reform efforts have been. Like I said, it's all an uninformed, one-dimensional depiction of politics and characters. There's nothing behind the stories. It's like this show was written to appeal to high school and college students. In one scene, Claire Underwood, to a candidate she is aggressively recruiting, tells her she values her so much because she is a ""valedictorian."" Did the writers really think a line like this would ever appeal to grown adults? Does being a valedictorian really impress anyone a few days graduated from high school? Give me a break.Everything about this show is phony, written by people that have been out of touch with reality for years. It's not even smart, because quite a lot is dumbed down and simplified, with political issues that don't even seem to be fully understood by the writers themselves. A show like this could be great if it were balanced and realistic. Unfortunately, it's not, and it will only be a matter of time before the masses wise up and realize how terrible House of Cards is, like they did with Homeland.",1,"Evil characters set in a cardboard, copy and pasted from wikipedia story",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3414,"['decided', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'seeing', 'new', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'Netflix', ""'m"", 'third', 'episode', 'honestly', 'grating', 'anyone', 'intelligence', 'news', 'politics', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'decipher', 'what', 'just', 'wrong', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikable', 'one', 'likable', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'evil', 'schemers', 'always', 'outsmart', 'enemies', 'who', 'are', 'nothing', 'complete', 'unwitting', 'dopes', 'ripe', 'plucking', 'DC', 'basically', 'version', 'hell', 'everyone', 'war', 'everyone', 'else', 'unhappy', 'place', 'life', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'just', 'caricatures', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'long', 'ago', 'balance', 'world', 'just', 'very', 'bad', 'very', 'stupid', 'Having', 'watched', 'Fincher', 'movies', 'years', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'schtick', 'creating', 'pseudo-dark', 'worlds', 'everyone', 'bitter', 'everything', 'joy', 'chance', 'joy', 'rest', 'lives.I', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'DC', 'know', 'type', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'do', 'know', 'something', 'political', 'platforms', 'beliefs', 'people', 'hold', 'where', 'show', 'miserably', 'Characters', 'talk', 'political', 'beliefs', 'platforms', 'ZERO', 'conviction', 'something', 'politicians', 'fight', 'nail', 'education', 'plan', 'discussed', 'show', 'was', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'was', 'probably', 'copy', 'pasted', 'wikipedia', 'something', 'people', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'stand', 'beliefs', 'everyone', 'else', 'allies', 'lobbyists', 'enemies', 'know', 'where', 'stand', 'as', 'well', 'episode', '2', 'secretary', 'state', 'candidate', 'withdraws', 'editorial', 'surfaces', 'where', 'Israeli', 'occupation', 'Gaza', 'illegal', 'uproar', 'eventually', 'booted', 'Come', 'Assuming', 'Democrat', ""'m"", 'quite', 'certain', 'allies', 'support', 'views', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'views', 'matter', 'Furthermore', 'was', 'editorial', 'decades', 'ago', 'anyone', 'would', 'seriously', 'take', 'seriously', '2013', 'Very', 'likely', 'views', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'fail', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'him.The', 'education', 'issue', 'most', 'effort', 'made', 'talk', 'how', 'much', 'failure', 'reform', 'efforts', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'uninformed', 'one-dimensional', 'depiction', 'politics', 'characters', 'nothing', 'stories', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'appeal', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'students', 'one', 'scene', 'Claire', 'Underwood', 'candidate', 'aggressively', 'recruiting', 'so', 'much', 'valedictorian', 'writers', 'really', 'think', 'line', 'would', 'ever', 'appeal', 'grown', 'adults', 'Does', 'being', 'valedictorian', 'really', 'impress', 'anyone', 'few', 'days', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Give', 'break.Everything', 'show', 'phony', 'written', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'touch', 'reality', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'smart', 'lot', 'dumbed', 'down', 'simplified', 'political', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'fully', 'understood', 'writers', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'were', 'balanced', 'realistic', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'matter', 'time', 'masses', 'wise', 'up', 'realize', 'how', 'terrible', 'House', 'Cards', 'did', 'Homeland']",N/A

The sleazy, literally murderous rise to power of Urquart is matched and even exceeded by the deceptions and savage ruthlessness of Frank Underwood -- Majority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Played expertly and convincingly by Kevin Spacey, Underwood schemes his way with devious cunning in this first series from the influential, but subordinate Majority Whip position to the threshhold of the Vice-Presidency.  Equally compelling is the portrayal of Underwood's brilliant, power loving wife Claire by Robin Wright.  If you enjoy fine acting and devious, twisting plots that would expand even our own jaded view of Washington polticial shenanigans, this will be outstanding entertainment.  --  Those familiar with the old BBC version will probably anticipate that the rise to power of Frank Underwood is far from over and that the frightening aspects of this weilding of power in the Oval Office by a totally unscrupulous person equipped with all of the high-tech devices of our own time are likely to eclipse anything we might have imagined from the Nixonian past.While Urquart is depicted as a Conservative (Tory) in the BBC version, Underwood is a Democrat.  In both, responsible public policy and poltitical philosopy take a back seat to raw ambition and uninhibited lust for power.",5,Utterly Ruthless and Terrifying,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1661,"['exceptional', 'version', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'BBC', 'House', 'Cards', 'series', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'crafted', 'U.S.', 'political', 'scene', '2013', 'earlier', '1990-95', 'BBC', 'series', 'depicted', 'rise', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'played', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'majority', 'whip', 'British', 'House', 'Commons', 'Number', '10', 'Downing', 'Street', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'chair', 'sleazy', 'literally', 'murderous', 'rise', 'power', 'Urquart', 'matched', 'even', 'exceeded', 'deceptions', 'savage', 'ruthlessness', 'Frank', 'Underwood', 'Majority', 'Whip', 'U.S.', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Played', 'expertly', 'convincingly', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Underwood', 'way', 'devious', 'cunning', 'first', 'series', 'influential', 'subordinate', 'Majority', 'Whip', 'position', 'threshhold', 'Vice-Presidency', 'Equally', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'Underwood', 'brilliant', 'power', 'loving', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'acting', 'devious', 'twisting', 'plots', 'would', 'expand', 'even', 'own', 'jaded', 'view', 'Washington', 'polticial', 'shenanigans', 'will', 'be', 'outstanding', 'entertainment', 'familiar', 'old', 'BBC', 'version', 'will', 'probably', 'anticipate', 'rise', 'power', 'Frank', 'Underwood', 'far', 'frightening', 'aspects', 'weilding', 'power', 'Oval', 'Office', 'totally', 'unscrupulous', 'person', 'equipped', 'high-tech', 'devices', 'own', 'time', 'are', 'likely', 'eclipse', 'anything', 'might', 'have', 'imagined', 'Nixonian', 'past.While', 'Urquart', 'depicted', 'Conservative', 'Tory', 'BBC', 'version', 'Underwood', 'Democrat', 'responsible', 'public', 'policy', 'poltitical', 'philosopy', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'raw', 'ambition', 'uninhibited', 'lust', 'power']",N/A
1625164,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B00BC5FN2C,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[9, 11]","Kevin Spacey shines as a power-hungry Congressman gaming his way through the political system to get what he wants, alternately promoting and throwing others under the bus. Cynical, raw, cold but fascinatingly gripping, House of Cards paints a picture of Washington where good men go to die and only the most ruthless can work their way up the ladder. The series also boasts an impressive cast that's about as perfect as any TV series can be. Robin Wright and Kate Mara stand out though frankly the whole cast should be considered for award time.David Fincher has put his trademark stamp on the look and feel - the sense of betrayal, loss and glossy decay permeate every scene. The plot avoids the usual trap of getting increasingly absurd (Dexter, anyone?) and instead focuses on delivering a complex, broad story that's much more akin to a great novel. This is an update of a British series by the same name that was equally excellent but there's enough new material that you wouldn't necessarily know they were connected.Fans of political drama, Kevin Spacey or just plain good entertainment are going to love this Netflix Original series. It's actually the sole reason I reactivated my Netflix account -- apparently they are about to release a new season of Arrested Development as well.

1625175,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B00BC5FN2C,Jiang Xueqin,"[20, 24]","The Netflix original series ""House of Cards"" features some extraordinary performances from well-established actors, as well as a well-written script and smooth and competent direction.  The real star of the series though is raw naked ambition, and how it infests and steers the lives and thoughts of the three main characters:  husband-and-wife and partners-for-power Congressman Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and environmental NGO head Claire (Robin Wright), and cub political reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara).  In their own pursuit of power and glory, the lives of these three individuals inevitably become entangled, snaring those who unfortunate enough to be in their way or silly enough to want to be in their way.Of all the characters, Congressman Francis Underwood has turned the pursuit of power into his own personal religion.  The series starts off with a newly elected president denying Underwood the position of Secretary of State, which motivates Underwood to dream and scheme for a higher position.  Throughout the first season's 13 episodes he relentlessly pursues his ambition.That is not true of his wife though.  Claire is supposed to be his husband's true and faithful partner, and in one revealing scene she confronts a man who has always hated Francis Underwood for corrupting her.  Claire then explains that she chose Francis because he could see her for her true nature, but the explanation is so violent that we as viewers must think she only says this to mask to herself her grave doubts about the grave she and her husband are digging for themselves.  Indeed, throughout the series, while Francis is energized (buying a rowing machine and eating salads for lunch, as a consequence) by the political intrigue that he has unleashed, Claire becomes burdened by a weary festering but ultimately fettered conscience.""House of Cards"" is a political thriller with a not particularly interesting plot.  What redeems it is its attention to detail, to nuance, and to subtlety, and the decision of the directors and producers to portray political power as honestly as mass television would permit.  It seems that everyone is tainted and corrupted by power so that redemption is never a possibility in ""House of Cards.""  The series also makes we viewers the personal confidante of Francis Underwood so that now and then he turns to us, winks at us, and tells us how the game is really played in Washington.  In this way, we're tainted and corrupted as well.""House of Cards"" is supposedly based on the British novel and the BBC mini-series, but I suspect that the series' real inspiration and source material is Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson's path to power.  Like Johnson, Underwood is a Southerner with a gift for gab, for telling stories, for understanding the minute mechanisms of Congress, for reading people, and ultimately for corrupting people.A lot of viewers will think ""House of Cards"" too cynical, but I think it's too naive.  In real world politics, every politician has the ambition and amorality of Francis Underwood, but in real world politics no politician has his cunning and strategy.  Evil may be banal, but it's also stupid, crass, and lazy.""House of Cards"" doesn't rise to the same genius as ""The Wire,"" but in many ways ""House of Cards"" is far more entertaining and relevant.",5,Raw Naked Ambition,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,3332,"['Netflix', 'original', 'series', 'House', 'Cards', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'well-established', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'well-written', 'script', 'smooth', 'competent', 'direction', 'real', 'star', 'series', 'though', 'raw', 'naked', 'ambition', 'how', 'lives', 'thoughts', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'husband-and-wife', 'partners-for-power', 'Congressman', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'environmental', 'NGO', 'head', 'Claire', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'cub', 'political', 'reporter', 'Zoe', 'Barnes', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'own', 'pursuit', 'power', 'glory', 'lives', 'three', 'individuals', 'inevitably', 'become', 'entangled', 'snaring', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'way', 'silly', 'enough', 'want', 'be', 'way.Of', 'characters', 'Congressman', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'turned', 'pursuit', 'power', 'own', 'personal', 'religion', 'series', 'newly', 'elected', 'president', 'denying', 'Underwood', 'position', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Underwood', 'dream', 'scheme', 'higher', 'position', 'first', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'relentlessly', 'ambition.That', 'not', 'true', 'wife', 'Claire', 'supposed', 'be', 'husband', 'true', 'faithful', 'partner', 'one', 'revealing', 'scene', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'hated', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'corrupting', 'Claire', 'then', 'chose', 'Francis', 'could', 'see', 'true', 'nature', 'explanation', 'so', 'violent', 'viewers', 'must', 'think', 'only', 'mask', 'herself', 'grave', 'doubts', 'grave', 'husband', 'are', 'digging', 'Indeed', 'series', 'Francis', 'energized', 'buying', 'rowing', 'machine', 'eating', 'salads', 'lunch', 'consequence', 'political', 'intrigue', 'unleashed', 'Claire', 'becomes', 'burdened', 'weary', 'festering', 'ultimately', 'fettered', 'conscience', 'House', 'Cards', 'political', 'thriller', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'plot', 'What', 'attention', 'detail', 'nuance', 'subtlety', 'decision', 'directors', 'producers', 'portray', 'political', 'power', 'as', 'honestly', 'mass', 'television', 'would', 'permit', 'everyone', 'tainted', 'corrupted', 'power', 'redemption', 'never', 'possibility', 'House', 'Cards', 'series', 'also', 'viewers', 'personal', 'confidante', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'now', 'then', 'winks', 'how', 'game', 'really', 'played', 'Washington', 'way', ""'re"", 'tainted', 'corrupted', 'as', 'well', 'House', 'Cards', 'supposedly', 'based', 'British', 'novel', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'suspect', 'series', 'real', 'inspiration', 'source', 'material', 'Robert', 'Caro', 'biography', 'Lyndon', 'Baines', 'Johnson', 'path', 'power', 'Johnson', 'Underwood', 'Southerner', 'gift', 'gab', 'telling', 'stories', 'understanding', 'minute', 'mechanisms', 'Congress', 'reading', 'people', 'ultimately', 'corrupting', 'people.A', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'think', 'House', 'Cards', 'too', 'cynical', 'think', 'too', 'naive', 'real', 'world', 'politics', 'politician', 'ambition', 'amorality', 'Francis', 'Underwood', 'real', 'world', 'politics', 'politician', 'cunning', 'strategy', 'Evil', 'may', 'be', 'banal', 'also', 'stupid', 'crass', 'lazy', 'House', 'Cards', ""n't"", 'rise', 'same', 'genius', 'Wire', 'many', 'ways', 'House', 'Cards', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'relevant']",N/A

Spacey talking to the camera--he's no Don Cheadle--is a huge mistake. It's condescending to the audience, and no good can come of it--this ain't Shakespeare. Better writing, a few well-placed captions, and the judicious use of a Fifth Business at Frank's side, would make this ""expository"" (explaining to the audience) and ""confessional"" device unnecessary. Tho they do their clever best to keep things moving when Frank is taking us into his confidance, it's merely a show-stopper, in a bad way--it breaks character.  When the icky unlikable sh muck is not doing it, you don't miss it, but then, achhh, he's at his cuteness again, and it's like the ""story"" is once again driving with the brakes on.  Another gripe I have, as with the hi-ly overrated filthy-mounted ""The Wire"", is the effusive use of the eff word, at least in the first several episodes (it seems to have petered out a bit as the season played out. I say this, by the way, not at all prudishly. Certain characters, the writer(s) feel, MUST use the eff word, not once, not twice, but over and over. I've made a game of timing when the next ""eff"" will get delivered, and I've been rarely wrong.There's some good writing too. The childfree/childless marriage of Claire and Frank, each possessing the other's somewhat enabling ""permission"" to cheat, is writ with layers, nuances, and much nascent drama--that is, it reeks of truth. Best part of this show for me is that Netflix is competing with the Hollywood studios in supplying internet-ready content, bypassing the cable TV companies (except for your having to buy internet servce from them to begin with). Hoping the writers will rid themselves of their precious ""asides"" for Frank, or anyone else, and ease of their tuckered out effs, and write the good stuff most of this show contains.

1625201,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BC5FN2C,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","One of the season's biggest and buzz-worthiest new shows came from a strange place. Netflix, in a further attempt to dominate the home entertainment market, launched ""House of Cards"" as its first scripted endeavor (many more to follow including the macabre Hemlock Grove and the reemergence of fresh Arrested Development episodes). Personally, I have never subscribed to or been interested in Netflix. But with the arrival of this original, I finally relinquished and signed up for the service. So I guess the strategy paid off for the network in many ways. ""House of Cards"" is even being bandied around for EMMY consideration! It would be quite an accomplishment if nominations were forthcoming, it is the epitome of a non-traditional network (although it's not unprecedented, Glenn Close still picked up an EMMY nod for Damages even when it was a DirectTV exclusive).Based on the brilliant British mini-series of the same name, ""House of Cards"" is a merciless depiction of political machinations and ruthless maneuverings. The show revels in a gleeful unpleasantness that sometimes smacks of satire, but often strikes close to home. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a dry examination of DC politics. It is an over-the-top adult soap opera with a wicked sense of humor and a cast of Machiavellian players. It's use or be used on this game board. You are either in control, fighting for control, or losing altogether. But the greatest strategy is to make your goals happen without even seeming to play the game. That's what Congressman Francis Underwood (an oily Kevin Spacey) is good at, manipulating others to his own end. The launching point of this saga has Spacey passed over for an expected promotion. A true power player, he does not take the snub lightly. He begins an extravagant path to revenge that leads right into the Oval Office and the President's feet. Almost no one is left unscathed. And back-stabbing and corruption has rarely been this entertaining or biting.Among the tools (I mean characters) that Underwood has at his disposal are his complicit wife (a chilly Robin Wright), a ruthless reporter (Kate Mara, never better), and a down-and-out politician (a memorable Corey Stoll) who may not have the stomach to play in the big leagues. Each of these characters (among several others) are given individual stories and side plots, but all continue to revolve around the manipulative Spacey. The cast is uniformly excellent. Spacey, with a sometimes iffy accent, breaks the forth wall and speaks directly to the audience in a way that may be off-putting to some viewers. As his observations are generally hysterical, however, I found these moments to be among my favorite. Spacey embraces his role with abandon, he is obviously relishing the opportunity to sink his teeth into something juicy and fun. Mara is a stand-out as well. She underplays every scene to perfection. And the great Stoll may be the heart and soul of the piece. A generally unsympathetic character, Stoll ends up being far too human to negotiate this world of corruption. Personally, I'd like to see Spacey, Mara and especially Stoll invited to this year's Emmy ceremony.Behind the scenes, ""House of Cards"" has a pretty impressive pedigree as well. Academy award winner David Fincher and screenwriter Beau Willimon are credited with creating the series. The season features 13 episodes (approximately an hour each) with 3 discs in the Blu-ray set and 4 discs in the DVD version. The show is literate and funny and incredibly stylish. From the sets, the editing, the staging, and the music, ""House of Cards"" is technically accomplished. But it is the whip smart writing and impeccable performances that will have you coming back for more. This is an adult soap opera in the strictest sense, with Spacey joining the ranks of TV's greatest anti-heroes. You'll love to hate him.

Simply put, its appeal derives from the successful use of power, and nothing else. That seems to be all that people want now, simple bullying, simple fights- won without serious opposition, a two second fight, a jaw shattering knockout punch. Spacey's character is simply too smart, and too charming, a truly interesting show can't be built on such a character. Only Spacey knows where the good barbecue is in Washington. This southern gent has his own little secret rib shack with his own little black barbecue master, who makes the best barbecue north of the Mason Dixon, but somehow has only been able to turn his skill into the smallest rib shack eyes have ever seen. Has frank helped his ""friend"" to expand? Of course not, the little man wouldn't know what to do with himself. Only Spacey knows where the good ribs are,and its gonna stay that way!Oh,and his wife, so noble, so blue eyed, so stoic; she tortures a dying man who confesses that he's loved her all of these years by forcing  a hand job on him(which he begs her to stop becasue he's well, dying).She does this after chastising him for not being more bold and aggressive when he was among the living and THEN a few episodes later she looks upon a black lobbyist who has owned her Congressman husband like he's a p.o.c, when he dares to invite her to his hotel room. She look at HIM with scorn? I guess he should have grabbed he by the hair and dragged her to the elevator LMAO!  So yes, we've got the humble black cook and the bold (presumptuous/uppity)nouveau rich black buck sexual predator, whats next?This is a woman who had already been compromised on more than one occasion, firing her staff and refusing to sell herself again, even if it meant being able to hire them back after ruining their lives, all for the sake of her husbands supposed future independence- thats heroism? In this universe? you betcha!This show is so absurd, its all a total crock of phony Spacey worship. Spacey and his wife against the world, only the two of them can deal with the burden of power.Only they're mature enough for an open marriage, only they are sophisticated enough to share a single cigarette while plotting the reshaping, nay, the saving of mankind. Only the two of them have the self control,the wits, and the foresight required to make the necessary decisions for the rest of us. The show pretends its about maturity and moral ambiguity -hard necessary choices, but in fact its simply a glorification of pure evil, and most people have gleefully swallowed the hook, the line, and the sinker. It used to be about the ends justifying and excusing the means, but now due to our own jealousy and sadism, theres no need to excuse the means at all, let the strong survive!

This is one of the most addictive series I have viewed.The premise is great: Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is promised the Secretary of State position in thanks for helping to get a new president elected.  Once elected, the new president conveniently changes his mind and doesn't even bother to meet with Underwood to tell him.  He lets his chief of staff notify Underwood he has been passed over, and asks for his continued support of the president in the Congress as Majority Whip.  Underwood promises his support, but lets us, the audience, know differently.Now the fun begins.  The joy of this series is seeing how Underwood continually outwits and outmaneuvers other politicians who seem just as integrity-challenged as him, but less bright.  And because Underwood has been skewered by the Prez and his team, you really don't mind when Underwood acts in a Machiavellian manner to get the better of them.Kevin Spacey is mesmeric as Frank Underwood.  The casting is superb.  The dialogue is intelligent and inspired.  You can't wait to see what schemes Underwood has concocted each episode and how they are going to play out.  If this series is fairly true to life, no wonder our government is in the mess it is in right now.Hope Netflix continues to create original, quality drama such as this show.

I very much liked the first two shows, but the picture quality just wasn't that great. Then I bought an episode on Amazon Instant View, and that wasn't noticeably better (usually Amazon streaming is the best!). Next I rented it on DVD. Not much, if any, improvement over streaming, and the English subtitles (I like to use when available) were distracting.So a sprung for the Blu-Ray set. The picture is much better, but still not as sharp as I expected--except for the title sequence, which looks like what you would expect with Blu-Ray. I finally decided that the filming was done in a way that doesn't render the usual clarity I've become used to in Blu-Rays of late. Perhaps that's by design? Oh, and the subtitles on Blu-Ray are easy-to-read and not big or distracting.Next comment is about the packaging of the Blu-Ray set. The inner box fits so tightly into the outer on that it's very hard to get out. And, what's worse, is that the individual discs are so tightly contained in their sleeves that, at a minimum, you get finger smudges on the discs (wash your hands first!) and, if you're not careful, you may break a disc on removing it.Despite the comments above, I recommend buying the Blu-Ray set of ""House of Cards."" It is so much more enjoyable to watch that by streaming or DVD. I'm rating it five stars because it is just so good that I can mostly overlook the other issues.I'm writing this review for those of you who are a little persnickety (like me) about the issues I brought up, to save you the time and money of trying out the other formats, so you can just invest in the Blu-Ray set and be done with it!PS - I grew up near Gaffney, SC, so can really appreciate this story line, especially as it relates to the main character's home district.

His wife is just as power hungry as the main character, but not as well known by the audience and therefore even more scary and suspect. Is she really just like him? Is she really a partner he can trust? I can't but help to believe that this is a fair representation of how Washington works. Disgusting in its depiction of political reality at times, yet the addiction continues. Kevin Spacey is a master actor, perfect for this role. The rest of the cast is also superb. If you have the stomach for the truth of how Washington really works, you will love this. I hesitated at first because I was sick of politics, but now I find myself fascinated and even cheering the main character on at times. Its amazing how attractive power is, both for the main character and his wife, and for me as a viewer. Somehow I feel safe, because I am in his confidence, and his motive is obvious and simple - more power. No guessing what he is up to for the audience. Brilliantly written. I also love how this series came about. Working outside of the studio system, they launched via an agreement with Netflex. So grateful to be able to view this now through Amazon. I am only through the first 7 episodes of the first season so far. But my daughter, a 20 something, has seen both seasons. She says,&#34;Mom, you are in for a treat!&#34; I can't wait!!

It's supposedly a remake of one of the same title that the Brits made in the 90's, which I have a copy of.  It's definitely not a remake despite it's pretentions otherwise.  It has the names as part of the executive producers the writer of the screenplay and the book author of the Brit series, but that's as far as it goes.The main character played by Spacey is a socio-psychopath much like many actual politicians as is his wife.  They are actually like Billary - Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are also present day manifestations of 2 Biblical characters, Ahab and Jezebel, therefore, Spacey and his wife, played by Robin Wright are likewise a present day Ahab and Jezebel.Way toooo much bed hopping explicit sex as with most American movies of the same genre, which is unnecessary.  I fast forwarded through that scum.  A lot of unnecessary scenes which don't advance the plot in any way..Spacey, as pol Francis Underwood goes back to the SC military academy he graduated from to speak at a dedication for a library founded in his name and he and several of his school mates get involved in a drunken spree in the old, now closed library building, pushing each other around on wheeled book carts, crashing into each other like go carts, throwing empty liquor bottles around, typical adult teenage activity.  Superfluous in my view.Another thing , at the end of the final episode Spacey and his wife go jogging in DC in the middle of the night....RIIIIIIGHT.  Crime ridden DC with it's ""diverse"" criminal class being very active, like most criminal classes, AFTER DARK, is just the place for a white couple to go jogging.  Horse patuey.The basic story itself, I liked.  I think the Brit version is much better.  The idea of the main character speaking to the camera as established in the Brit version and continued here, wherein he expresses his hidden thoughts to the audience, is very good.Too many F words and other profane slang sex talk which are not necessary to the plot.  I don't think Francis Urquart in the original said one F word, in this one, all sorts of profanity rolls off his tongue, in the form of threats, etc.  I'm sure the writers think it provides ""realism"" and character development; showing the evilness of his character, etc, but the original was fine without it.

And a dour one.  There is no joy here, only a hangdog workmanship, as he plots and schemes and manipulates.  It all looks like such work!There is a problem with the motivations of the lead character.  Specifically, he might have one of two motivations.  The first is revenge, for being passed over to be Secretary of State.  Revenge on the President, his Chief of Staff, the Secretary of State.  In the grip of this need for revenge, House Whip Underwood will do anything, take any risk, to get the revenge he seeks.  This explains the dangerous high wire act that is his manipulation and game playing.Or is he just seeking power?  By episode six, the viewer is confused.  Underwood's actions seem geared to make him more of a player.  In that context, some of the risks he takes seem silly.  If he was out for revenge, in an explosion of anger, OK.  But power requires more finesse.This confusion is due to poor plotting.  Here is another point:  the pay-off in episode six (which is where I believe the series went off the tracks) - this pay-off is Francis getting the union head to punch him.  An entire strategy, with multiple actions and staged set-ups, to get a union head to punch you, when it would have been far easier for the union head to just walk out.  This is sloppy writing.So, is he a master manipulator on a revenge-lust death run, or is he a master manipulator trying to build power within Washington?  And when he manipulates, does it all make sense?And his wife!  In episode six - -the last episode you should watch -- she morphs from a troubled partner in crime into a creepy psycho -- in the scene in her former bodyguard's hospital room -- for no good reason.  A flash of what?This confusion makes the series hard to abide, despite the great acting, the strong production values.

The unfolding cardboard is a little inconvenient as far as removing and replacing the disks is concerned. Hopefully Netflix will fix this set up with future DVD releases.However, the box design is actually kind of clever. The show's trademark image is an upside down and backwards american flag with no stars, and the box opens from the left instead of from the right like most dvd boxes, and the fold out cardboard comes out backwards as compared to most DVD boxes. I assume that is to represent the show's trademark image. This little detail might go unnoticed by many customers who purchase the product, but it's actually kind of a neat little Easter egg for those that do.Content Score - Five StarsDavid Fincher is a better match for television than he was for film, House of Cards is the absolute best show on the internet.

Not as rich maybe but playing for much bigger stakes.Kevin Spacey is every bit as good as Larry Hagman was in creating this indelible character.  I still don't know what it is about either J.R. or Frank Underwood that is particularly likable, but I did find myself rooting for Frank at times in spite of his very bad behavior.  Maybe it's the way he lets us, the audience. into his real thoughts by his asides into the camera, maybe it's his amazing ability to save himself in , Superman-like, in crisis after crisis.  Maybe it's his Southern accent, which reminds me of Tennessee Williams in his sad later years, although I have much more affection for TW than I ever could for Frank.  Maybe it's his sheer maliciousness, his willingness to do things that many of us would like to do but don't dare.  I loved the scene in the woods where's he's been dragged by the billionaire birding enthusiast---the looks of exasperation on his face are pricelss as the rich old guy regales him with bird lore and then recites  lines from ""When Lilacs Last at the Dooryard Bloomed"" by Walt Whitman to him and asks Frank if he knows the poem.  Frank, claims he doesn't  and then rushes to the screen and snarls at us that he knows the damned poem!  Somehow I found that very endearing.  Likewise his argument with God which ended in his blowing out all the votive candles in the church!  Very moving, very  funny.Robin Wright is lovely to look at as his wife, Claire.  I didn't find the character very credible...the contrast between her tender moments with Russo's children and her cold-heartedness, seemed like too much of a stretch.  Wright plays sweet and tender better than cold; that would have been more suited to Glen Close. But Wright is more beautiful and eye candy is one thing that this series dishes out by the handfuls.  The whole cast is pretty good. At first I didn't care for the actress who played Zoe, the reporter/girlfriend, but she grew on me.  She has a vulnerability as well as a fierce determination to succeed that makes her an interesting and somewhat likable character, not to mention her willingness to take off her clothes.  There's a lot of that and some viewers may object.  I don't think it's any worse than what goes on in most films these days but it is clearly a device to keep viewers interested. It's a way that the film makers manipulate the viewers just as the young women in the film manipulate their various contacts. There is some hypocrisy, probably intended, that the girl reporters who sleep around for their careers seem to see themselves as superior to the girls who live in trailers and do it for cash but it all amounts to the same thing.The marriage/alliance of Frank and Claire is interesting.  Another reviewer has likened it to the Clintons and this comparison is certainly apt.  Each one ""allows"" the infidelities of the other, but, Claire asks, ""What does she bring us?""

1625259,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B00BC5FN2C,"Ray ""A Reader""","[0, 0]","This review is simultaneously one of the easiest and the most difficult to complete. That's because this show, House of Cards, is indeed an excellent show in its own right, but the fact remains that it is also based on a much earlier show originally produced in the UK: because many ""derivative"" TV shows are not up to their predecessors' level, that complicates such a review. But I'm happy to say that, in this case, the derivative show is as good as the original version (although many of the specifics surrounding the story have been changed to suit the American audience). Let me talk a little bit about that and then provide some information about the current disc I'm reviewing here.House of Cards was originally created in 1990, and was focused on the UK political scene immediately after Margaret Thatcher left office. More specifically, the show centered on the political ins and outs of particular individuals in the Tory party working within the power vacuum after Thatcher's exit in the Westminster setting. The main character of the show, Francis Urquhart (played by Ian Richardson, a Scottish Shakespearean actor of great acclaim), was slighted by his party, and he embarked on an agenda to ""right matters,"" at least in his own mind, by forwarding his own personal agenda at the expense of others in the government. That's really all I'll say about it, because I don't want to give too much of the story away. Much of the enjoyment from watching the original House of Cards comes from watching Urquhart work his way through this process of self-promotion, and so giving away specifics about the story would not here serve any valuable purpose. This BBC-produced show was wildly popular in the UK, even though it consisted of only a limited number of episodes, and was revisited in two more seasons, first in 1993, and then again in 1995.In spite of the shows great popularity and success, one of the reasons that gives us pause in wondering if such a show could be successfully translated to the American context is the different manner in which the British people view government as compared to their American cousins. There is a playfulness, no, even more so a subtle mockery that borders on bemusement of politicians in the original BBC series, and this is not a trait held by the vast majority of American people, in spite of their negative view of many and political life.And it is here that we can begin discussing the American House of Cards production, which was produced by Netflix in 2012. The show has now been fully Americanized, not just in the names and places and features of the political landscape, but in the manner in which politics is carried out in the United States. This has allowed the migration of the original concept into the American setting, but with the addition of new twists and features that are not present in the UK political setting. The overall story plot is the same in that story focuses on a relatively high level politician who feels slighted by his own party and then seeks to gain an upper hand in responding to the slight. But the adaptation to the American context is exceptionally well done, and this makes the 2012 Netflix House of Cards completely worthy of consideration along with the original series. It's it's a show about power, politics, and betrayal, and if you are interested in politics and how the behind-the-scenes work is sometimes carried out, this is a show for you. It's not a show full of action, car chases, or even arguments, but that doesn't mean that it's uninspired or uninteresting. If you like to be challenged in your thinking, and enjoy plot twists, intrigue, and mystery, this is a show you'll certainly want to watch. And you can do so without ever having seen the original UK version. Having said that, if you watch House of Cards and enjoy it, and if you have any interest in UK politics at all, then I highly recommend that you go back and view the original UK version, all three seasons. (And although the original UK version is in three seasons, because there are only four episodes per season, there are only a total of 12 episodes for the entire three season run. This is the same number of episodes as in the first season of the American version of House of Cards season one.)You may have heard that House of Cards 2012 was done by Netflix and was not shown on any broadcast channel or even any cable channel. This may be a sign of a newly emerging Netflix producing shows that come can compete with some of the best of HBO and Showtime. The show is every bit the equal of some of the best of these cable offerings, has extremely strong acting, and very good production values. Kevin Spacey's acting is excellent, right on the correct note, and his was an excellent casting decision, much as he and Richardson's casting as Francis Urquhart in the original UK version was also superb. Nearly everyone who has seen House of Cards 2012 season one is anxiously awaiting season two.

It all starts when Congressman Frank Underwood gets passed over for Secretary of State, a position he was promised by the President. He continues to support the President but lets you know what his real plan is. Its all about power in politics and Frank knows just how to play the game. Watching him scheme and maneuver into getting what he wants is where the fun is. It is scary how good he is at manipulating people and bending them to his will but that is part of his ruthlessness. This part of Frank Underwood was tailor made for Spacey and he plays it to perfection. Robin Wright is also excellent as Frank's wife, Claire. The two have a unique relationship as you will see.

It all starts with Kevin Spacey, who delivers one of the best performances of his career, and after &#34;The Usual Suspects&#34;, that is saying something. Spacey plays the role of Francis Underwood, the majority whip and a man whose ambitions lead him to create the most complex and evil ploys you could imagine. Machiavelli seems an innocent kid next to this guy.The way in which the series weaves in the political aspects, with the importance of the press in the events is very interesting. We get to see not only how the press shapes what happens in DC, but also how political figures manipulate it and trade favors with them. Of course, you also have the lobbyist, another powerful breed that affects many of the outcomes.The series provides a great portrayal of ambition, lack of scruples, clever schemes and blends those well with the personal stories of the main characters. In particular, the relationship between Francis and his wife is unusual and mesmerizing, with many layers of complexity. As the series progresses this relationship becomes central to the plot and mirrors the intensity increase in the rest of the plot.I loved the way that the creators decided to gives us enough closure to the first season, while at the same time leaving unanswered questions. This gave a great balance to the overall endeavor. I hate when seasons in a series end in cliffhangers, and therefore, I have to praise those series that avoid doing this.

The character of Francis Underwood stops at nothing  to achieve his career ambitions and does not hesitate to do so at the expense of other people. The Netflix picture where his hand is covered in blood is very fitting for the series.  The character of Francis Underwood does the narration and even justifies one of his schemes by saying that all people eventually die anyhow.
