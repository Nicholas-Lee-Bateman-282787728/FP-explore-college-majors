1348363,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B003L1Z33Y,Addicted2Amazon!,"[5, 5]","Wow.  So I KNEW what I was getting into.  All the previous reviewers of this product warned that it would be hard.  I knew even as I looked at it and thought, ""That doesn't look that hard,"" that I was wrong and that it was harder than it looks.  But, oh my...I had no idea...it was not just hard, it was HARD!  Like, can't-get-through-a-single-exercise-without-resting HARD.  Like collapsing-in-a-sweaty-heap-at-the-end-of-an-exercise HARD.This is such a solid and challenging workout, I just really am in awe of it. I think that the whole thing is just over an hour, working your entire body but mainly emphasizing the lower body with some effective ab work and push-up combinations thrown in. It is done entirely on the floor and divided into three segments: legwork on your side, a bridge series on your back and leg extensions on your knees. Of course, you can be a complete sadist like me and ATTEMPT to do the entire thing (I LOVE working my lower body more than anything else), or you can, as the instructor Sylwia suggests, just do one or two sections.I have a HUGE collection of workout DVDs, but as far as difficulty and effectiveness go, this is the Queen of them all. You will do a LOT of reps of each exercise; she says 30.  However, she even admits that she often adds extras.  And nothing is more hope-shattering (but I know it's so good for me!) than hitting number 30 and she shouts out in her cute Polish accent, ""10 more! We're doing 40!"" Since with the side and knee exercises she works one side at a time, you may worry about over-working one leg or underworking another (HA! Underworking ANYTHING is a massive joke with this workout!) .  I've encounterd this before with other workouts and just get around it by switiching my starting leg.  One day I'll start all exercises with the right, the next the left, and switch.Though 90% of the exercises hit your lower-body from every angle possible on a mat, there is also some short but pretty effective ab work (I definitely felt a burn in my abs and waist) and quite a few push-ups thrown in.There is an optional warm-up/cooldown on the main menu, but as I preceed this workout with very lite cardio, I'm already warm and don't use this feature.The production quality of the DVD, though not top-notch (and I really don't like that strange, distracting blue and white background...) is ok.  People have complained about the lack-luster dance re-mix style music, but I actually really like the music, especially the last song (maybe because it's the last song and it means I'm almost through my ordeal!).  The music has a strong, happy beat and the soundtrack changes with each section.Sylwia herself is incredible.  She has an amazing little body and she can only be about 5'3"" at the most.  Watching her complete a whole set of exercises, with no edits, no camera cutaway, just makes me thing she's superhuman.  I love the passion and encouragement that she exudes, and I love her Polish accent!If you can't tell, I love this workout, and though it is GRUELING, it will slim, lift and firm your lower body in particular pretty darn quickly.  I also love the fact that this will challenge me to be able to keep up more and more with each use.Highly recommended!",5,CRAZY Hard Workout for a CRAZY Hot Body!,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,3230,"['Wow', 'So', 'KNEW', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'product', 'warned', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'knew', 'even', 'looked', 'thought', ""n't"", 'look', 'hard', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'harder', 'oh', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'hard', 'was', 'HARD', ""can't-get-through-a-single-exercise-without-resting"", 'HARD', 'collapsing-in-a-sweaty-heap-at-the-end-of-an-exercise', 'HARD.This', 'such', 'solid', 'challenging', 'workout', 'just', 'really', 'am', 'awe', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'hour', 'working', 'entire', 'body', 'mainly', 'emphasizing', 'lower', 'body', 'effective', 'ab', 'work', 'push-up', 'combinations', 'thrown', 'done', 'entirely', 'floor', 'divided', 'three', 'segments', 'legwork', 'side', 'bridge', 'series', 'back', 'leg', 'extensions', 'knees', 'course', 'can', 'be', 'complete', 'sadist', 'ATTEMPT', 'do', 'entire', 'thing', 'LOVE', 'working', 'lower', 'body', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'instructor', 'Sylwia', 'just', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'sections.I', 'have', 'HUGE', 'collection', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'as', 'far', 'difficulty', 'effectiveness', 'go', 'Queen', 'will', 'do', 'LOT', 'reps', 'exercise', '30', 'However', 'even', 'often', 'extras', 'nothing', 'more', 'hope-shattering', 'know', 'so', 'good', 'hitting', 'number', '30', 'out', 'cute', 'Polish', 'accent', '10', 'more', ""'re"", 'doing', '40', 'side', 'knee', 'exercises', 'one', 'side', 'time', 'may', 'worry', 'over-working', 'one', 'leg', 'underworking', 'HA', 'Underworking', 'ANYTHING', 'massive', 'joke', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'encounterd', 'other', 'workouts', 'just', 'get', 'switiching', 'starting', 'leg', 'One', 'day', ""'ll"", 'start', 'exercises', 'right', 'next', 'left', 'switch.Though', '90', '%', 'exercises', 'hit', 'lower-body', 'angle', 'possible', 'mat', 'also', 'short', 'pretty', 'effective', 'ab', 'work', 'definitely', 'felt', 'burn', 'abs', 'waist', 'quite', 'few', 'push-ups', 'thrown', 'optional', 'warm-up/cooldown', 'main', 'menu', 'preceed', 'workout', 'very', 'lite', 'cardio', ""'m"", 'already', 'warm', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'feature.The', 'production', 'quality', 'DVD', 'not', 'top-notch', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'strange', 'distracting', 'blue', 'white', 'background', 'ok.', 'People', 'have', 'complained', 'lack-luster', 'dance', 're-mix', 'style', 'music', 'actually', 'really', 'music', 'especially', 'last', 'song', 'maybe', 'last', 'song', ""'m"", 'almost', 'ordeal', 'music', 'strong', 'happy', 'beat', 'soundtrack', 'changes', 'section.Sylwia', 'incredible', 'amazing', 'little', 'body', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'about', '5', '3', 'most', 'Watching', 'complete', 'whole', 'set', 'exercises', 'edits', 'camera', 'cutaway', 'just', 'thing', 'superhuman', 'love', 'passion', 'encouragement', 'love', 'Polish', 'accent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'love', 'workout', 'GRUELING', 'will', 'slim', 'lift', 'firm', 'lower', 'body', 'particular', 'pretty', 'darn', 'quickly', 'also', 'love', 'fact', 'will', 'challenge', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'use.Highly', 'recommended']",Tonique Fitness: Mat Workout
1348364,AEH9HX8RKN52F,B003L1Z33Y,bella,"[44, 45]","This workout is an all floor based workout concentrating on the butt, thighs and hips with a little core work thrown in as well.  It has got to be the toughest, most difficult mat workout I have ever done and I've been working out for a long time with the firm, the bar method, pure barre, and tracy anderson dvds. If I had to compare it any other workout it would be Buns of Steel - the original with Greg Smithey - which is very dated but extremely effective.  It has similar moves to it and even reminds me alot of Tracy Anderson's first dvd, excluding the standing work. It is about an hour in length but well worth the time to finish, trust me, this is one dvd you'll keep. Two words of warning: first, the music is a little dreary so if you're looking for fun, this isn't up your alley; second: it can be hard on the wrists, especially in the second half with all of the plank work and kneeling exercises.  But keeping those things in mind, this is absolutely worth getting for your collection if you want to change your lower body without lunges or squats. You'll not regret it. :)Update - August 1, 2011 - I have continued to work out with this jewel of a video since I wrote the review above at least 3 times every week - 4 if I have the energy.  I haven't become bored from using it and my lower body is awesome looking - seriously I thought that I was getting great results from barre videos but there is nothing like this out there. I have wrist and knee issues and this has alleviated alot of those problems.  Every woman looking to have the tightest lower body possible without the bulk should buy this video and invest the time - it's MUCH better than anything out there on the market today.  I know because I've tried everything.",5,Hardest floor workout EVER!!!,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,1745,"['workout', 'floor', 'based', 'concentrating', 'butt', 'thighs', 'hips', 'little', 'core', 'work', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'got', 'be', 'toughest', 'most', 'difficult', 'mat', 'workout', 'have', 'ever', 'done', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'firm', 'bar', 'method', 'pure', 'barre', 'tracy', 'anderson', 'dvds', 'had', 'compare', 'other', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'Buns', 'Steel', 'original', 'Greg', 'Smithey', 'very', 'dated', 'extremely', 'effective', 'similar', 'moves', 'even', 'alot', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'first', 'dvd', 'excluding', 'standing', 'work', 'hour', 'length', 'well', 'time', 'finish', 'trust', 'one', 'dvd', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'Two', 'words', 'warning', 'first', 'music', 'little', 'dreary', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', ""n't"", 'up', 'alley', 'second', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'wrists', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'plank', 'work', 'kneeling', 'exercises', 'keeping', 'things', 'mind', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'getting', 'collection', 'want', 'change', 'lower', 'body', 'lunges', 'squats', ""'ll"", 'not', 'regret', 'Update', 'August', '1', '2011', 'have', 'continued', 'work', 'out', 'jewel', 'video', 'wrote', 'review', 'least', '3', 'times', 'week', '4', 'have', 'energy', 'have', ""n't"", 'become', 'bored', 'using', 'lower', 'body', 'awesome', 'looking', 'seriously', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'great', 'results', 'barre', 'videos', 'nothing', 'there', 'have', 'wrist', 'knee', 'issues', 'alleviated', 'alot', 'problems', 'woman', 'looking', 'have', 'tightest', 'lower', 'body', 'possible', 'bulk', 'should', 'buy', 'video', 'invest', 'time', 'MUCH', 'better', 'anything', 'out', 'there', 'market', 'today', 'know', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'everything']",Tonique Fitness: Mat Workout

It has become one of my most cherished fitness routines. I've been using this for several weeks now and my lower body looks amazing!!! My hips and thighs have never looked better or more slim (finally!) It is all floorwork, which has seriously gone missing from most current fitness dvds. You will work very hard but the results are worth it.Other reviewers have compared this to the Original Buns of Steel with Greg Smithey and I have to agree. It's one tough routine. I've actually been rotating both of these for several weeks and I couldn't be more pleased with my results.
