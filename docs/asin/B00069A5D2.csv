This series is no exception.This particular series used to be called the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh when I was a child.  They repackages and renamed it with the DVD releases.  In my opinion one of the best episodes of the series ""All's well that ends well"" is on this dvd.I just wish Disney would release more of the growing up with winnie the pooh episodes.

They are so well done and have such a great story and lesson in each one.  My 2 year old grandson loves them.  I can sit down and watch with him and never get tired of these movies.  I truly believe it makes kids want to get off the couch and go outside to discover the big world waiting for them and the friends of various sizes and colors waiting for them.,5,Winnie is for everyone,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,492,"['great', 'Pooh', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'books', 'older', 'children', 'when', 'were', 'small', 'now', 'movies', 'bring', 'life', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'story', 'lesson', 'one', '2', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'movies', 'truly', 'believe', 'kids', 'want', 'get', 'off', 'couch', 'go', 'outside', 'discover', 'big', 'world', 'waiting', 'friends', 'various', 'sizes', 'colors', 'waiting']",N/A
