616275,A36A9HWQ9U1IK4,B00005JMCN,"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction""","[5, 5]","Seabiscuit is one of those movies which I should have seen much earlier, but did not do so because of the generally unfavourable reviews which I received from friends. Next time, I am going to be much more probing and patient.It turned out to be one of the most incredible movies I have seen in many years. But here I must say something about movies in general. Different people have a different penchant towards movies. Most of the times, this is obviously so because of our specific interests. An ice-hockey fan is much more likely to truly appreciate the movie 'Miracle', based on the American team's victory against Russia in the 1981 olympics. And so it goes for any one of us. In my case, American History is one of my major intersts, and I so I don't find it surprising that I greatly liked 'Seabiscuit'.The movie is hardly about a horse, although the horse is the central character in the movie. The most important thing is that it's based on a true story and that changes the equations. Seabiscuit, first and last, is about a people, struggling through depression times, who come together as a nation, beginning a juggernaut towards freedom and progress that continues to this day (Unfortunately we cannot be as certain about that statement given the events and attitudes of the past decade). The common spirit which embodies the American people and their dreams clearly shines through in the movie. Representing this dream is an unlikely combination of men; an ardent businessman who is the eternal optimist, a cast away but spirited trainer who nonetheless has a remarkable way with horses, and a smart alec, ambitious and intense jockey, with all the follies and hopes of youth. All three are facing the cruel ways of the depression. The businessman has lost a child and has been through a divorce, and is struggling to achieve his pre depression eminence and status. He meets a woman, in every way his equal, who will support him through every time. Having risen from rags to riches, he is the perfect example of the American ideal, honest yet ambitious, having great strength of character, yet warm, and most importantly, blissfully optimistic about the future. And that's exactly where the finishing line is for him-at the future. An extremely talented salesman, he is looking forward to have something to live for. Opportunity comes in the form of an aged, quiet, and extremely sincere horse trainer, who has a private and warm relationship with horses. The third character in the drama is a jockey who is struggling to make ends meet. A fierce ambition and Dickens's works keep him alive and well. Together, these three 'can-do' Americans find a horse, a lazy creature who nonetheless captures the attention of all three. They train him, plod him and finally lead him to victory. But that is as far as it can be trivialised.The story of the horse is the story of the American people. This is demonstrated most convincingly in the publicity interviews which the businessman is extremely fond of giving. Slowly but surely, the horse is winning his way to success. He has to compete against the best bred animals in the country. He loses some, he wins some. In speaking to the reporters, who in those days were hungry for any heartening news to take the public's mind off the economic crisis, he constantly extols the virtues of not giving up. 'You lose some, and you win some. Sometimes, you fall down. But then you either pack up and go home, or you stay put and fight', he says. The reporters nod their head vigorously. That is what strikes a chord in the mind of every American in that time. 'Stay put!' That's exactly what Americans did in the 20s and 30s. And that is exactly what enabled that country to become the citadel of democracy during the dark ages that followed. It is all too easy for critics to attribute America's success to resources and money. But if it had not been for the unity and sense of a common way of life that millions of Americans shared, and the nitty gritty that they put into achieving it, all that would have come to naught. It is a tribute to the can-do spirit of the 'Yankees'. And Seabiscuit was one type of an epitome of that spirit. He did inspire a nation in a subtle but archetypal way, and it worked.As for the performances, I have seldom seen such fine performances in which the actors really walk around in the skin of the characters. It's hard to say who among the three was better: Jeff Bridges as the good businessman with a gleam in his eye, always looking towards the future, Chris Cooper as the laid back looking but resolute horse trainer (his bearing is amazing), or Toby Maguire as the headstrong and single minded young jockey. I would say that each one of them deserved an Oscar nomination. The recreation of the period is charming, and the musical score by Randy Newman is perfect and nostalgic.One of the allegiations I have heard about this movie is that it's predictable. But then so was the story about the prince, princess and the demon which my mother told me as a child. That fact diminished neither the virtue nor the value of the story. And in this case, the story is true. The fact that it's predictable does not mar it's inspirational character one bit. Also, it obviously looks predictable in retrospect! The three central characters hardly knew what their and their horse's fate was going to be. And a disturbed nation hardly knew what tidings the future would bring for her. But the horse and the nation, both persevered, and, at least for the most part, became a model of democracy for the rest of the world in a century that had almost brought it to an end through conflict.",5,The Story of a Nation...,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,5662,"['Seabiscuit', 'one', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'earlier', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'generally',

616279,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B00005JMCN,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","""Seabiscuit"" is a movie that could be so easy to dismiss as one of those schmaltzy weepies about triumph over adversity that ultimately operates on being both over-emotional and manipulative. Make no mistake ""Seabiscuit"" does deal with emotional events. But, as written and directed by Gary Ross, it does it with a taste and a depth that allow the film finally to reach the level of complexity we tend to expect of novels rather than movies.""Seabiscuit"" is about one underdog race-horse, three men wounded in different ways, and a nation in a period with little hope. I realise that that sentence makes it sound awful, and even sounds like an advertising blurb in itself, but trust me, it's not awful.The men are jockey Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Pollard (Tobey Maguire) given up for adoption by his parents during the Depression, working as a jockey and prize fighter to make a living and blinded in one eye; Charles Howard (played by Jeff Bridges), a millionaire car dealer who has lost his son and his wife; and Tom Smith (the usually terrific Chris Cooper), a cowboy who is trying to come to terms with the end of the freedom of the old West.Their lives are all galvanised by their relationship with Seabiscuit, a short and knock-kneed horse that had been rejected as unsuitable for racing, beaten up, and - almost - had its spirit broken.The millionaire buys ""Seabiscuit"" the ex-cowboy trains him, the ex -prize-fighter rides him.As if Red Pollard's blindness in one eye wasn't enough he even - at one point - suffers multiple breaks in one leg that may mean he can't walk again, let alone ride. Seabiscuit too suffers an injury that may mean he will never race again. And yet both do get past these obstacles. Partly because of their struggle to overcome their wounds and backgrounds - the whole team become heroes for a nation that needs to see an underdog win.It's one strength of the film that it doesn't suggest this is just an accident. Owner Charles Howard certainly seems to know the value of public relations, and does deliberately cast his horse and his team in the light that he knows the public will value.Director and writer Gary Ross formerly wrote and directed ""Pleasantville"" and also wrote ""Dave"", and ""Big"". All of those films struck me as interesting, and I'd say that most of them are complex and insightful. In ""Seabiscuit"" he manages to give considerable depth to the stories of all these men. He also intercuts them with historical documentary sequences, which emphasises the social and sociological background against which events were taking place. These people's lives are intimately connected with the historical sweep of events, and making those connections clear adds a lot of depth and resonance to the story. The script is based on Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book of the same name.Apart from the actors in the main roles, William H. Macy as radio sports commentator &quot;Tick-Tock&quot; McGlaughlin also gives a wildly funny performance, turning a minor character into a highly memorable one. John Schwartzman's cinematography is lush and romantic, well suited to the story.In case you're worried that this is basically going to be Lassie with horses, one of the most effective things about it is Gary Ross's restraint. The scenes that could have been mawkish are underplayed and handled with considerable tact. Interestingly, one of the ""rules"" most commonly explained to screenwriters is that you shouldn't write dialogue that's too ""on the nose"". The funny thing about ""Seabiscuit"" is that practically the last line of the movie is VERY on the nose, very blatant, and yet it seems to tie the whole thing together perfectly.",5,A Winner,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,3664,"['Seabiscuit', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'one', 'schmaltzy', 'weepies', 'triumph', 'adversity', 'ultimately', 'being', 'over-emotional', 'manipulative', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Seabiscuit', 'deal', 'emotional', 'events', 'written', 'directed', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'taste', 'depth', 'allow', 'film', 'finally', 'reach', 'level', 'complexity', 'tend', 'expect', 'novels', 'rather', 'movies', 'Seabiscuit', 'one', 'underdog', 'race-horse', 'three', 'men', 'wounded', 'different', 'ways', 'nation', 'period', 'little', 'hope', 'realise', 'sentence', 'sound', 'awful', 'even', 'sounds', 'advertising', 'blurb', 'not', 'awful.The', 'men', 'are', 'jockey', 'Johnny', 'quot', 'Red', 'quot', 'Pollard', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'parents', 'Depression', 'working', 'jockey', 'prize', 'fighter', 'make', 'living', 'blinded', 'one', 'eye', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'millionaire', 'car', 'dealer', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'wife', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'usually', 'terrific', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'cowboy', 'who', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'end', 'freedom', 'old', 'West.Their', 'lives', 'are', 'galvanised', 'relationship', 'Seabiscuit', 'short', 'knock-kneed', 'horse', 'had', 'been', 'rejected', 'unsuitable', 'racing', 'beaten', 'up', 'almost', 'had', 'spirit', 'broken.The', 'millionaire', 'Seabiscuit', 'ex-cowboy', 'trains', 'ex', '-prize-fighter', 'him.As', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'blindness', 'one', 'eye', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'suffers', 'multiple', 'breaks', 'one', 'leg', 'may', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'again', 'let', 'alone', 'ride', 'Seabiscuit', 'too', 'injury', 'may', 'mean', 'will', 'never', 'race', 'again', 'yet', 'do', 'get', 'obstacles', 'Partly', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'wounds', 'whole', 'team', 'become', 'heroes', 'nation', 'see', 'underdog', 'win.It', 'one', 'strength', 'film', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'just', 'accident', 'Owner', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'certainly', 'know', 'value', 'public', 'relations', 'deliberately', 'cast', 'horse', 'team', 'light', 'public', 'will', 'value.Director', 'writer', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'formerly', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Pleasantville', 'also', 'wrote', 'Dave', 'Big', 'films', 'struck', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'are', 'complex', 'insightful', 'Seabiscuit', 'give', 'considerable', 'depth', 'stories', 'men', 'also', 'historical', 'documentary', 'sequences', 'social', 'sociological', 'background', 'events', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'intimately', 'connected', 'historical', 'sweep', 'events', 'making', 'connections', 'clear', 'lot', 'depth', 'resonance', 'story', 'script', 'based', 'Laura', 'Hillenbrand', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'same', 'name.Apart', 'actors', 'main', 'roles', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'radio', 'sports', 'commentator', 'quot', 'Tick-Tock', 'quot', 'McGlaughlin', 'also', 'wildly', 'funny', 'performance', 'turning', 'minor', 'character', 'highly', 'memorable', 'one', 'John', 'Schwartzman', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'romantic', 'well', 'suited', 'story.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'worried', 'basically', 'going', 'be', 'Lassie', 'horses', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'things', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'restraint', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mawkish', 'are', 'underplayed', 'handled', 'considerable', 'tact', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'rules', 'most', 'commonly', 'explained', 'screenwriters', 'should', ""n't"", 'write', 'dialogue', 'too', 'nose', 'funny', 'thing', 'Seabiscuit', 'practically', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'VERY', 'nose', 'very', 'blatant', 'yet', 'tie', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'perfectly']",N/A

By that I mean that its production values are pretty outstanding.  It is a glossy and very pretty film that captures an authenticated `vintage' appeal thanks to the beautifully designed costumes and crisp set pieces.  That aside, the film is not anything to write home about.  It is disengaging and completely stale in taste.  The earnestness to become something superficially uplifting strips this film of any real soul.  Instead it feels tired and plagued by lack of real detail.  The narration is useless, never really providing any useful information (narration is tricky, and it can become a source of endless irritation when it continually insists of telling you what you already know) and the overall flow of the film becomes stagnant thanks to a lack of endearment or charisma.  Tobey Maguire is one of those actors who struck gold once with a role that was made for him (`Spider-Man') but his persona doesn't bode well with anything else.  He is a blank bore here.  The supporting cast works decent enough here, with Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges and William H. Macy adding some spice to the events (even if it is in clich&eacute;s) but they can't rescue this film from itself.  `Seabiscuit' had potential, but it squandered it in a sappy script that lost sight of what made the true story (and apparently the source material for this screenplay) so beloved; the horse.

It's a classic story of some underdogs whose ability and determination ultimately shine through, and the beauty of this story is that it is essentially true. I haven't read the book, nor do I know enough about Seabiscuit to know where reality ends and storytelling takes over, but the basic story can't be denied.As presented, not only is Seabiscuit an underdog (mistreated as a young horse because he didn't fit the mold of a classic racehorse), but so are the three major human characters. One professional reviewer whose comments I saw regarding this movie complained that it was more about the human characters than the horse. Duh! It would be hard to make a movie just about a horse. Horses can't handle much dialogue (Mr. Ed aside) and aren't great actors. What's nice here is that horse, jockey, trainer and owner all carry each other and achieve greatness together. None of them could have done it without the others.SEABISCUIT, playing on the fact that it is based on a true story, takes on a semi-documentary nature. Newsreel-like breaks are interspersed throughout the film. That's fine with me and it gave the film a more true-life, historical feel. The acting is fine. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire are good in their roles and William H. Macy gives a great performance in a limited role as a radio personality. Further, some of the cinimatography is excellent. Catching the interplay among jockeys in the midst of a race is impresively done. And, of course, the horses are simply gorgeous.This is a very good film. At least, I thought so. It may seem a little slow at times, but all of the personal episodes play into the nature of the characters. It's a heart-warming story made more so because it's true, and the production values are outstanding. With many movies featuring heavy doses of violence and special effects, SEABISCUIT represents a nice change of pace. Again, it's not a GREAT movie -- I'll still take THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies -- but it's good.

The movie needs a while to really get started and thus is just a little bit long, but eventually the overall craft sported by filmmakers redeems itself as truly impressive; no wonder the movie got seven Oscar nominations, although it converted none.Rock-solid male cast is of a real class -- Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire and William H. Macy shining in a minor role -- while Elizabeth Banks (as Bridges' second wife Marcela Howard) gets a sound amount of coverage in a film with few female roles. The movie wisely eschews some cliches -- for example, after the jockey Red Pollard (Maguire) is forced to say good-bye to his parents as a youth we never see the mom and dad again, although this might ensure a real tear-jerking reunion.

But what if it were a true story?  Well, then you have ""Seabiscuit"", both the book and the movie, with a thoroughly documented story that is so unlikely it is the stuff of romance and  the genesis of ""legend"".This is a wonderful film.  Taking this great story and telling it with love and care, filmaker Gary Ross & company, have created a very old-fashioned movie with state-of-the-art technique.  The riding scenes are fabulous.  The production values superb.The cast is ideal: Toby Maguire the bitter, beaten-up Red Pollard; Chris Cooper the taciturn and horsewise Tom Smith; and the always terrific Jeff Bridges as the shrewd, ever-selling, ever-promoting, but kind and decent owner, Charles Howard.I can't imagine the person that wouldn't love this story.  Full of drama and tragic set-backs coupled with stirring and inspirational personal and public triumphs, this story of the neglected, the cast-off, and the disregarded coming back to prove themselves to a world begging for heroes is heart-lifting and, in its way, joyous.  That this took place in The Great Depression, one of the worst times in American history, only adds to the drama and elation of the accomplishment.Some quibble with the use of documentary footage and stills and the authoritative documentarian voice-over by David McCullough.  It was a choice that may not have been necessary, but it does ground the story in reality.  Perhaps Ross thought modern audiences needed some factual reminders of the realities of 1930's Depression era America.  At any rate, it didn't bother me.Seabiscuit thrilled and inspired an America in the despair and hopelessness of a Depression frightening and unprecedented.  That this little, forgotten horse, trained and ridden by these forgotten men could rise to beat the best bred, finest horses in the country, was a metaphor for triumph over adversity then, and it is so now.

616292,A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,B00005JMCN,"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col...","[1, 1]","Even though the film version of Seabiscuit hardly covers 1/3 of the book, it really is a great movie.It's important to remember that the film is based on a non-fiction biography, not a novel. The film itself tries to capture this by adding in some documentary type elements. It's also important to know that even though the biography is titled ""Seabiscuit"", it's as much about the people who were a part of his life as it is the horse himself. In fact, the film pretty much ignores the biographical portions of the book about the horse himself. Most of the complaints I have heard about this film is that it's too predictable or that it's too ""feel good"". Since when was history ""too predictable?"" As for too feelgood, this was a horse who uplifted a nation during the great depression.Laura Hillenbrand's book covers so much about the life of Seabiscuit and the people around him, that it's impossible to fit it all into a movie. Instead, the filmmakers wisely decided to capture the heart of the book rather than the details, and they mostly succeed. The story of Seabiscuit is mostly about three unlikely characters who find themselves drawn together over an incompetent race-horse, and how they make him better only to have him make them all better. This theme, the film captures amazingly well.The performances by Bridges, Cooper, and Maguire could hardly be better. The acting, charisma, and chemistry are top notch, and make the film enjoyable on their own. But Gary Ross is telling the story of a horse that captivated a nation, and even if 2 1/2 hours is too short to really show you why, it's plenty of time for him to captivate you. When people say this film is ""too much of a feel good movie"" or ""it's too sappy"" that should be considered a compliment, because this is what happened in the late 1930's, and this movie captures it. Icing on the cake is the incredible cinematography that confidently states, ""no horse movie was ever shot as good as this."" All this combined with the soul-stirring score, makes me say, if this film doesn't move you, maybe you have no soul.But as good as Seabiscuit is, it's not perfect. While many people might claim the film is too long, I claim the opposite. One of the biggest complaints about the film is that the end seams anti-climactic when compared to the powerful climax of the War Admiral match-up that the movie really focuses on. The other complaint is the predicability of Seabiscuit winning all the time. In the movie, he mostly does, but in reality, he lost a lot. The biggest losses were the first two times he ran the Santa Anita Handicap (aka the Hundert Grander), the biggest race in the west, and the highest stakes race in the country. In the film, we never are treated to Seabiscuit's failures to capture Howard's dream. We only see him finally winning it in 1940, where we wonder what the big deal is.The big deal is, Seabiscuit lost this race twice. When he finally ran it a third time, it was a few years later and he was a geriatric seven years old (that's old for a race horse). On top of that, he had suffered a supposed career ending injury as well his jockey had too. To top it off, he had to carry an extremely high impost (extra weight) that was much more than any other horse competing. Then you have the bad history of this race. How many more cards could be stacked against him? In reality, this race was the highlight of Seabiscuit's and Red Pollard's careers, yet the film fails to convey this. Instead it uses the 1940 Hunderd Grander as an epilogue to the horse's acheivements and impact on the lives around him. While this is all fitting, and it works, I think an extra 20 minutes of film used to convey the story I just did, would have improved the impact of the ending of this film.But what film can't you critique?

Ridden by a half-blind jockey, trained by an eccentric horse-whisperer type and owned by a marketing tycoon still in anguish over the death of his child, Seabiscuit brought these misfits together as he won race after race and challenged the nation's top horses.  Based on Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller, the film is suitable for the whole family (though there are some fistfights and the off-screen death of a child).  This is an inspirational film by a fine writer-director, Gary Ross, who seems to come out with a terrific project every 5 years or so -- Big, Dave, Pleasantville and now Seabiscuit.  The cast is terrific -- Tobey Maguire, Chris Cooper, Jeff Bridges, William H. Macy, Elizabeth Banks and jockey Gary Steven in his film debut.DVD extras are great: a commentary track with writer-director Ross and Steven Soderbergh; a making-of featurette (15 min); on-set photos by Bridges; a featurette about the real Seabiscuit, featuring author Laura Hillenbrand (15 min); the featurette &quot;Anatomy of a Movie Moment; a Buick featurette (3 min); a soundtrack spot; bios and filmographies; very interesting production notes; dvd-rom features for Windows users; and, an unfortunate recent trend, a Mastercard spot.The film can be heard in English, and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.",5,uplifting horse film with terrific dvd features,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1384,"['film', 'true', 'story', 'little', 'horse', 'inspired', 'Depression-era', 'Americans', 'Ridden', 'half-blind', 'jockey', 'trained', 'eccentric', 'horse-whisperer', 'type', 'owned', 'marketing', 'tycoon', 'still', 'anguish', 'death', 'child', 'Seabiscuit', 'brought', 'misfits', 'together', 'won', 'race', 'race', 'challenged', 'nation', 'top', 'horses', 'Based', 'Laura', 'Hillenbrand', 'bestseller', 'film', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'are', 'fistfights', 'off-screen', 'death', 'child', 'inspirational', 'film', 'fine', 'writer-director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'terrific', 'project', '5', 'years', 'so', 'Big', 'Dave', 'Pleasantville', 'now', 'Seabiscuit', 'cast', 'terrific', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'jockey', 'Gary', 'Steven', 'film', 'debut.DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'writer-director', 'Ross', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'making-of', 'featurette', '15', 'min', 'on-set', 'photos', 'Bridges', 'featurette', 'real', 'Seabiscuit', 'featuring', 'author', 'Laura', 'Hillenbrand', '15', 'min', 'featurette', 'quot', 'Anatomy', 'Movie', 'Moment', 'Buick', 'featurette', '3', 'min', 'soundtrack', 'spot', 'bios', 'filmographies', 'very', 'interesting', 'production', 'notes', 'dvd-rom', 'features', 'Windows', 'users', 'unfortunate', 'recent', 'trend', 'Mastercard', 'spot.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'English', 'subtitled', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish']",N/A

This movie impressed me on many dimensions:TALENTChris Cooper (Tom Smith) once again morphs into an entirely new person as an out of work cowboy who becomes a horse trainer....clearly more at ease with Animals than people.Jeff Bridges (Charles Howard) largely reprises his role in ""Tucker,"" but it's a lovable role.Tobey Maguire (Red Pollard) plays a young man capable of great things if he can only control his temper and get out of his own way.Elizabeth Banks (Marcela Howard) though a relatively small role, she has quite a presence.

616298,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JMCN,Benjamin,"[3, 12]","Based upon Laura Hillenbrand's biography of Seabiscuit, the film SEABISCUIT is mixed bag.The story, of course, was good. The acting, of course, was good. At least, it was good when they let the actors actually have scenes or lines of dialogue without outrageous jump cuts to suggest the passage of time.But SEABISCUIT's direction was completely annoying. And so was Randy Newman's LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE-inspired score.It's rough to have to watch a movie and say, ""OK, I wouldn't have included that. OK, why did they cut away from that? OK, what the hell is with this narration telling us what's going on right now onscreen when we can just watch it???""Maybe it's just me, but I realized that the Depression was horrible for people before I watched SEABISCUIT. I didn't need historian David McCullough's overhead narration to tell me about it.I feel like Jeff Bridges could've gotten an Oscar nomination on the strength of his early scenes, when his character loses a son and divorces his first wife. He could've, that is, if the director had been daring enough to actually show us scenes of full emotional resonance or given Bridges dialogue that would've allowed him more of an opportunity to emote. Instead, we get Bridges sitting alone, jump to Bridges and his wife, played by the always-excellent and completely-underused Valerie Mahaffey, in a one-minute scene about a mop; jump to Mahaffey leaving Bridges and the film forever. The whole movie's like that. You feel like Ross went through with the editor and said, ""Hmm ... OK ... this scene's gone on long enough. Don't you think the audience has gotten the gist of it?"" It's like watching SEABISCUIT: THE CLIFFSNOTES VERSION.Chris Cooper, additionally, is good, playing someone far older than he actually is, but he doesn't get much to say. And, at this point, isn't the whole horse whisperer fad exhausted in pop culture? I realize his character Tom Smith was a horse whisperer, but it just feels so tired.Cooper's best scene could've been the one where he first saw Seabiscuit, if it weren't for the narration telling us that it was the first time he'd seen Seabiscuit. Since we in the audience hadn't seen the horse yet because the horse hadn't been in the movie yet, I think we could've figured it out without the narration.Tobey Maguire is decent in the film, his character being the most showy, but occasionally he's upstaged by his fake, curly and red hair, which is weird. Also, in the scenes where his character does ""bad"" things like consort with a hooker, he has to seem uninterested in her or bored because he has to be ""the hero."" And at one point, when his character gets injured, the way the scene is done is completely ridiculous. I mean, it's one of those old-style movie techniques where they pretty much show you the tractor, play the ominous music and, you're sitting there thinking, ""Why the hell is a tractor there? OH MY GOD!"" Ross may as well have had ""DANGER: TRACTOR!!!!"" painted on the side of the faulty machine.And the final line of narration (surprisingly, not delivered by McCullough ... because I guess Ross forgot that McCullough was narrating during the film's last hour) is a corny, cliched piece of hokum.

The movie opens by showing snippets of a young Tobey McGuire at home with his family and Jeff Bridges making a fortune selling cars.  It shows Chris Cooper on the farm training horses.  This movie jumps from scene to scene at an incredible pace from the beginning of the movie to the end.The editing seems choppy and the story is fragmented.  To enjoy this movie, every single scene needed to be about 10 seconds longer.  The director cut every scene short, making them just long enough to tell the viewers how they should feel.At the very beginning of the movie, Jeff Bridges sees his son reading a book.  He asks him if he wants to go outside and play.  The son says no, then the scene cuts to the dad leaving town without the son.  There is no explanation why or who is even watching the kid.  The next scene shows the kid getting in a truck to go fishing.  The next scene shows the kid dead and the dad crying.The whole movie is like this.  There is no character development because there isn't time.  If you watch this movie, check out the scene where it is revealed Toby McGuire is blind.  That could have been longer and explained more, but it is cut short and left me wondering what's going on?I guess this movie would have needed another hour to give the subject matter justice, but as it stands, the director did a horrible job of telling a great story.

Sometime's it seems as though films which are less intellectual are consigned to the scrap heap by the arts-page elite, even though these pictures tell a great story beautifully and reflect the highest elements of film art. The fact that Chris Cooper was never nominated for an Oscar for his awesome performance in this film says it all. Sure, the film does not reflect the historical record accurately, and for this reason it might have been retitled.  But there were sufficient elements gleaned from the rest of Seabiscuit's history to justify a film with his name on it.When you go to the movies or roll a DVD, don't seek absolute historical truth, and above all don't scorn honest emotion. SEABISCUIT is a beautifully produced film.Well produced, acted, edited and art-directed.  The costumes are awesome. The script is intelligent. Randy Newman's score is predictably lavish and lovely. The cinematography is to die-for. The tension and pacing are appropriate to the tale.

I went into this movie with reservations, but was absolutely blown away by the sheer power of this story.  Set in the background of the Great Depression, this story of an underdog horse, an underdog jockey, even an underdog trainer, cannot help but inspire.This remarkable tale tells the story of four individuals (one of which is a horse, of course), down on their luck and unhappy with their lives, who are brought together by fate and who, together, prove to themselves and the world that good breeding, perfect upbringing, and money are not all that build character.  In the process, all of them are changed, and Seabiscuit, the horse that&#65533;s too small, and Red, the jockey who&#65533;s too big, change each other&#65533;s lives and make each other champions.This movie flawlessly weaves four plots together into one wonderful story.  Seeing these peoples&#65533; lives come together is one of the most powerful aspects of this film.

J Robbins,"[0, 1]","Interesting characters, interesting time...Seabiscuit is considered a symbol here...a symbol of hope, in a country in which 1 of every 4 persons was out of work. A brilliant, but strange, horse-whisperer trainer; a former bicycle salesman who was smart enough to get into auto sales when the going was good; and a poor boy with red hair who likes to ride horses.  The story practically writes itself.Seabiscuit's story is interesting. He ran until he was 7 years; started 89 times, but won only 33. At two, he started 35 times, but won only five times. At 3, he started 23 times and won only 9 times. He didn't start blossoming until his 4 year old year, when he ran 15 times, won 11 and was out of the money only once.  But those first two years throw a monkey wrench in his statistics. Who knows how many races he would have won if he ran only 9 races at 2 and 3, like many horses do today, instead of 35 and 23? Makes me wonder....To spot inaccuracies...the most significant one that I could find was the large height difference that the film made between War Admiral and Seabiscuit. Seabiscuit was small, a 15.2 hands, bony, but they made War Admiral look like his Daddy, Man o War, who was a large horss. In fact, War Admiral WAS NOT the same size as his sire, but was just about the same size as Seabiscuit, 15.3 hands.

Gary Ross manages to avoid over-romanticizing, which is a considerable accomplishment, bearing in mind Hollywood's usual addendum of tear-jerking moments when it comes to adapting ""prize-winning-semi-biographical"" novels. I haven't read Laura Hillenbrand's novel, and I think it's for the better - the film was a tad too long anyways, and it would have been inconceivable for me to sit through it if I knew what was coming. It is a well-structured motion picture that won't surprise but will sustain interest. Despite the occasional slip into schmaltz (boy and horse interacting, aawww; Randy Newman`s embroidered score), under Gary Ross' practiced (`Pleasantville') guidance `Seabiscuit' is still a notch above the average Dream Factory melodrama.The film looks gorgeous. John Schwartzman's camera-work impresses, especially considering his previous efforts ('Armageddon' umm... 'Airheads'...) The mid-20th Century is well-portrayed, and the races are brilliantly photographed.The film also has heart, and most of it comes from the inspired performances, especially from its three leading stars. Jeff Bridges is one of the most underrated Hollywood actors (his Oscar-worthy performances in Peter Weir's `Fearless' and the Coen bro`s `The Big Lebowski' were ignored by the Academy), and gives a multi-layered performance as a kind but overly-motivated man, evading recollection of his son's loss by exploiting a young jockey (Maguire in his most nuanced performance since Ang Lee's `The Ice Storm') and a beat-down small horse with extraordinary abilities. Chris Cooper does `subliminal' as the horse's proprietor - he's a tranquil animal lover, who saved that horse and put his faith in it.Clearly, above all things, the film belongs to its horses - gracious, they elegantly gallop towards their fate - the viewers are treated with multiple angles of the race, as well as POV shots of the jockeys that are invigorating.  Seabiscuit, in spite of his minor bulk, is utterly believable as the champion of the stadium. It's not all triumphs for him, and the film, despite the flaws, competently guides its audience into cheering for its protagonist.Not a masterpiece by any standards, `Seabiscuit' is for horse-lovers and/or for younger kids, as a source of inspiration. The messages are pounded into the viewer's head, borderline frustrating, but Ross' assured direction will keep an average viewer mildly riveted.PS If you are not too into melodramas, horses, or Tobey Maguire boasting thinning red hair, then consider 'Seabiscuit' a 'rainy Sunday night movie'. On a Friday night, you'll think of ten thousand other things to do but be enveloped in Hollywood gloss.

Let's start (and maybe finish) with my first complaint. What's with that sappy, cigar addled Jimney Cricket-esque, nostalgia-obsessed - cliched beyond belief - narration that accompanies black and white shots from the past as boringly as any car commercial? Have we become so roboticized to actually fall for that act ad infinitum (ad nauseum)?Yes, Jeff Bridges is endearing, and Toby ain't too shabby either but the film was filled with formulaic tactics that simply take away from the beauty of the scenes and the appreciable performances.I must admit, at times I was swept up in the grandeur of the flick and who wasn't rooting for the underhorse at every gallop; however, I am sick of the formula!!! Please give us something truly unique. It doesn't matter if the film is based on a true story if the story is told like a billion others.All it would have taken, in my humble opinion, would be some sort of &quot;cliche-checker&quot; ensuring that the film be ridded of any overtly formulaic or snooze-inducing cliches (like the good ole boy American narration). Perhaps this is mean of me; but how many agree that we have seen these tactics way too much? Just because it pleases the marketing research panels and promises to pack the crowds does not translate to quality.

Arguably, this pic was about people too; however, the star of the show was a four-footer and his race---and, sadly, the production left me wanting to drown my disappointment in a feedbag of fermented oats. I had really been looking forward to this film, so it was a double-downer.  The close-ups of the horses were kind of thrilling, the stories of the people were not.  The use of bogus news reels was annoying and cheesy and, while I'm a Randy Newman fan, I found his score cloying.  The best of the three leads was Tobey McGuire; Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges both looked befuddled and misdirected.

616320,A3JOEIC2MFT1Z3,B00005JMCN,Carol Mello,"[1, 1]","This is a wonderful film. It's a story about a race horse who should not  have won, ridden by a jockey who should not have won, owned by a man who pulls himself out of grief by his devotion to the horse, the jockey, the trainer, and a second wife.The story starts with a man (Jeff Bridges) who moves to California and opens a bicycle shop. He is failing until he switches from bicycles to automobiles. He becomes a millionaire selling automobiles. He buys a ranch and uses the barn to store his car collection. After his son is killed in an auto accident, the cars are removed from the barn and taken away. His first wife never recovers from the death of their son, blames her husband, and leaves him.He meets a young beautiful woman who becomes his second wife. His wife loves horse racing. He decides to buy a horse. He searches for just the right trainer to pick out a horse for him. He finds the trainer, a taciturn man living by himself, camping in the wilderness. The trainer sees Seabiscuit on a track and tells the millionaire to buy him. He sees a certain spirit in the horse who has been mistreated all his life. There's a certain irony that a man who made his millions selling cars which replaced horses should buy and become devoted to a horse.Tobey Maguire's character was given away as a child to a horse trainer by his parents (virtually abandoned). He loves horses. For a time, he gets to race as a jockey but as he grows up he becomes too large to be a jockey and starves himself to keep his weight down. By the time he is hired by the millionaire to be the jockey for Seabiscuit, he is a broken down has-been jockey.Both the jockey and the horse have to be retrained out of the self-destuctive habits of a lifetime. Together, they become winners.All of the major characters associated with the horse Seabiscuit have suffered. They come together as a family of choice rather than one of blood and it is through their association with Seabiscuit and each other that they are each healed.Some people will not love this film for various reasons. Let me tell you about two.My parents grew up during the great depression. They have told me many stories about their life back then. For me, this movie made that period come alive, made me understand how bleak the depression was, the desperation that many people faced.It gave me a better understanding of why my parents are they way they are, how they were shaped by the times they lived through as children and teenagers. But I think that is the reason my mother had difficulty watching this film. Its depiction of the great depression was too real. It reopened the wounds that had scarred over from the suffering my mother experienced during the depression.My husband was lukewarm about this film too. Perhaps it is because his grandparents and parents were part of the middle class during the depression so there is no family narrative about suffering during the great depression. Also, my husband's attitude toward life is to pretend that nothing bad ever happens in the real world -- he would rather not face up to the less pleasant sides of reality. He does not mind watching violent movies with lots of gore and death because they are phony and not reality. I think this movie was too much unpleasant reality for him, something he'd rather pretend did not and does not exist.",5,Loved this film but know others who did not,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,3343,"['wonderful', 'film', 'story', 'race', 'horse', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'ridden', 'jockey', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'owned', 'man', 'who', 'grief', 'devotion', 'horse', 'jockey', 'trainer', 'second', 'wife.The', 'story', 'man', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'California', 'bicycle', 'shop', 'failing', 'bicycles', 'automobiles', 'millionaire', 'selling', 'automobiles', 'ranch', 'barn', 'store', 'car', 'collection', 'son', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'cars', 'are', 'removed', 'barn', 'taken', 'away', 'first', 'wife', 'never', 'recovers', 'death', 'son', 'husband', 'him.He', 'meets', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'second', 'wife', 'wife', 'horse', 'racing', 'buy', 'horse', 'just', 'right', 'trainer', 'pick', 'out', 'horse', 'trainer', 'taciturn', 'man', 'living', 'camping', 'wilderness', 'trainer', 'Seabiscuit', 'track', 'millionaire', 'buy', 'certain', 'spirit', 'horse', 'who', 'been', 'mistreated', 'life', 'certain', 'irony', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'millions', 'selling', 'cars', 'replaced', 'horses', 'should', 'buy', 'become', 'devoted', 'horse.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'child', 'horse', 'trainer', 'parents', 'virtually', 'abandoned', 'horses', 'time', 'race', 'jockey', 'up', 'too', 'large', 'be', 'jockey', 'keep', 'weight', 'down', 'time', 'hired', 'millionaire', 'be', 'jockey', 'Seabiscuit', 'broken', 'down', 'has-been', 'jockey.Both', 'jockey', 'horse', 'have', 'be', 'retrained', 'self-destuctive', 'habits', 'lifetime', 'Together', 'become', 'winners.All', 'major', 'characters', 'associated', 'horse', 'Seabiscuit', 'have', 'suffered', 'come', 'together', 'family', 'choice', 'rather', 'one', 'blood', 'association', 'Seabiscuit', 'other', 'are', 'healed.Some', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'love', 'film', 'various', 'reasons', 'Let', 'tell', 'two.My', 'parents', 'grew', 'up', 'great', 'depression', 'have', 'told', 'many', 'stories', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'made', 'period', 'come', 'alive', 'made', 'understand', 'how', 'bleak', 'depression', 'was', 'desperation', 'many', 'people', 'faced.It', 'gave', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'parents', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'how', 'were', 'shaped', 'times', 'lived', 'children', 'teenagers', 'think', 'reason', 'mother', 'had', 'difficulty', 'watching', 'film', 'depiction', 'great', 'depression', 'was', 'too', 'real', 'reopened', 'wounds', 'had', 'scarred', 'suffering', 'mother', 'experienced', 'depression.My', 'husband', 'was', 'lukewarm', 'film', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'grandparents', 'parents', 'were', 'part', 'middle', 'class', 'depression', 'family', 'narrative', 'suffering', 'great', 'depression', 'Also', 'husband', 'attitude', 'life', 'pretend', 'nothing', 'bad', 'ever', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'face', 'up', 'less', 'pleasant', 'sides', 'reality', 'not', 'mind', 'watching', 'violent', 'movies', 'lots', 'gore', 'death', 'are', 'phony', 'not', 'reality', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'unpleasant', 'reality', 'something', ""'d"", 'rather', 'pretend', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'exist']",N/A

So, it seemed to be a novel idea.On the good side, The movie has marvelous production value and is obvious the makers were attempting to achieve an oscar for their studio. But, that is the only thing I can say in its favor.The story has characters and themes that you SHOULD care about and root for. Red Pollard (played by TOBEY MAGUIRE), is a consiment underdog. An ill-tempered, former bare hand boxer who has been dismissed and forgotten his entire life. Yet, the movie never truly executes this feeling, or resolves it.Seabiscuit wins race after race, showing signs of super intelligence when it comes to racing and competing. Knowing when it's losing and not liking it, and we're supposed to feel as if it were some kind of underdog. The horse is fast, a top notch racer and it never shows any sign of anything different.What the movie needed more than anything was more moments between Pollard and Seabiscuit. Bonding. The movie needed to show them becoming one, becoming a team and more importantly, becoming inseparable friends. In this, it failed. It tried. But, it failed.The biggest dramatic moment in the entire yawner of a movie is when Red Pollard is the victim of a freak accident that you see coming a mile away, (and so should have he if he'd been around horses all his life) injuring his leg and being told he'll never be able to race again.All in all, the true problem with SEABISCUIT is the story itself or the script itself. And it's biggest failure is its attempt to make the viewers believe that horse racing is something OTHER than a game for the sole purpose of making the super rich, RICHER.",2,AN OSCAR ATTEMPT but a movie that leaves you saying...

After I was done watching the movie, I was left wondering if I had seen the same film.First, the movie is way too long.  The first half hour or so is a boring preamble about the Great Depression.  Everyone who has had high school history knows what the depression was like, so we don't need a narrator to remind us!  I remember looking at my watch several times during the movie wondering when the moviewould actually start.Second, although the actors in the movie are very good, the material that they are given are not.  We are supposed to root for Tobey Macquire and Jeff Bridge's characters, but they are both so pathetic that I couldn't make myself feel empathy for them.  The best performances in this movie were given by Gary Stevens, who is a professional jockey and not an actor and the horse who plays Seabiscuit, who is in fact a HORSE.  Perhaps it is appropriate in a movie like this that a horse upstages the lead actors, but I would have expected Jeff Bridges and Tobey Macquire to put up a little more effort.Finally, I didn't like the movie because it was framed like a history channel documentary.  The movie has a narrator and the effect of the narrator being there was that I felt that I was watching some kind of afterschool History Channel documentery rather than watching these great events unfolding.  The narration made the action so much more stale.Perhaps I am the only person in the world who didn't like this movie.  There is and was so much hype surrounding this film that people seem to have lost track of the fact that it isn't that good.

Shirley Temple may have been his only rival. According to Laura Hillenbrand, the author of the book &#34;Seabiscuit&#34; on which this film was based, the race horse Seabiscuit was the most written about individual during his era in terms of how much newspaper real estate was devoted to him. Apparently, President Roosevelt was second. The film in question is a wonderful dramatization/docudrama of possibly the greatest race horse who ever ran.The film begins unexpectedly like a Ken Burns documentary with the calming yet compelling voice of David McCullough of PBS fame, known for his narration of Burns-PBS' &#34;The Civil War&#34;. The film introduces three interesting aspects of American life at the beginning of the 20th century: the rise of the automobile, the obsession with horse racing, and finally the Great Depression. Instead of merely engaging in a chronological history of Seabiscuit and his owner Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), his trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and his jokey Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire), the film sets out to establish a context for the story. One of the recurring themes of the story of Seabiscuit is how the horse symbolized hope for a broken down nation.After the historical subtext is established, the film moves between three different stories: the eventual owner Charles Howard who became a successful automobile salesman in the 1920's, Tom Smith, a down-on-his-luck trainer who was regarded as an eccentric by others in the racing world, and Red Pollard who began life in a middle-class family in Canada. Pollard's family would eventually lose almost everything due to the Depression and were forced to part ways with their son when he is offered a job at a race track. Pollard was also a part-time boxer.The three lives eventually slide into one another, almost off-handedly, along with the devastation of the Depression. When Tom Smith first sees Seabiscuit, he notices something, a rare spirit, an undefinable &#34;attitude&#34;. Smith isn't sure what it is, but he believes deep within the horse is something untapped and unappreciated. He then informs Howard that the horse may be worth further exploration.Seabiscuit was not like his forebears Hard Tack and Man o' War. He was small for a horse, only 15 hands long. Most champion race horses were 17 hands or larger. His rival War Admiral, a second cousin, was a full 18 hands long. He was also thought to be lazy and overfed. And he was a handful for anyone trying to race him. He was thought a failure by his first owner and sold to Charles Howard for $8000. Smith finds Pollard and eventually, these four interesting and unlikely characters are brought together: Howard, Smith, Pollard and of course the star, &#34;Seabiscuit&#34;. And then something unexpected and magical begins to occur. After early success, Howard begins to make overtures toward the owner of War Admiral who at first dismisses him. But at some point, he realizes he can't dismiss him forever.One of the great inspirational movies of the early 21st century, and may have won Best Picture for 2003 if it hadn't been up against some tough competition, particularly the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King whose other two installments had been up for Best Picture in previous years. &#34;Seabiscuit&#34; the film couldn't quite beat 2003's War Admiral, the Lord of the Rings, but the fact is the film is still an absolute triumph. The acting is absolutely on the money, although none of the leading human players were nominated since there was no award for Best Performance by an Animal in a Leading Role. I have seen people who never cared much for horse racing literally stand up and yell &#34;Go Seabiscuit!&#34; when they see this film. Without question, Seabiscuit the horse is the star of the show.

Tobey Macguire, playing jockey Red Pollard, is a gifted young actor.  The immensely talented Chris Cooper's character Tom Smith did not provide an expansive enough role to unveil his ability.  Jeff Bridges was only decent as Seabiscuit's millionaire owner, Charles Howard often not selling the emotions he strove to display.  To me, William H. Macy stole the show as Tick Tock McGlaughlin, the booze swilling, handicapping, horse racing radio personality.The story itself was a perfect vehicle for the silver screen,  succeeding in promoting the ""if you don't succeed at first try, try again"" cliche.

616337,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JMCN,Craig Matteson,"[0, 0]","This telling of the Seabiscuit story captures a lot of the mythic power that made this odd little horse such a national passion during the Depression.  Some have expressed a problem with the way the story is told visually. They find it jumpy and have a hard time following some things.  But I liked it a lot.  I think the images used tell the several stories moving through this movie are selected and filmed very effectively.The movie isn't an exact or historical document.  Certain events are elided and others left out.  Betting, a very important aspect of horse racing, is hardly mentioned.  This is really a poem that captures the heart of the story trying to pull out the timeless qualities that make the story of the little horse with the big heart so compelling.The racing sequences are very effective and at times I was simply stunned at what I was seeing.  However it was done, it was supremely effective.All of the principle roles were performed wonderfully.  Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire have a very touching relationship.  Valerie Mahaffey and Elizabeth Banks are very effective as the women in Charles Howard's (Jeff Bridge's) life.  Chris Cooper is amazing as the trainer, Tom Smith.  And William H. Macy functions as a Greek chorus and comic relief in the role of the announcer.  I don't know the name of the actress who plays Macy's girlfriend, but she quietly steals a couple of scenes as well.  I think that Michael O'Neill and Annie Corley were very touching as Red Pollard's (Tobey Maguire's) parents.  I wanted to see more of them and find out how they ended up.We all need stories about overcoming obstacles and sticking with things even when they seem hopeless.  Some people find such stories saccharine.  For me, this is a very effective story that inspires without being oversweet.  I think it depends on your own sense of irony, I suppose.  But I don't see or hear this movie as a cynical telling of a sugary story to extract money from the rubes.  There does seem to be a heart in this telling of the story.Maybe that is because of my own view of the world.  I think a lot of life is aggressively persisting when circumstances are telling you to abandon the field.  There is a lot to be said for simply ignoring all the voices telling you that you can't in order to find out that you can.

I struggled through it because I was reading the book.For one thing, Hillenbrand made Seabiscuit the most compelling character in the story: funny, ferocious, lazy, nervy, sweet... the movie totally lost sight of all that. It should have started with Seabiscuit and stuck with him. It mentions his preference for lying down and sleeping and his big appetite, but only in passing, whereas Hillenbrand weaves these and other luminous details into a portrait vivid and individual enough to rival Lassie, Old Yeller, and the like.Also, the movie was entirely lacking in humor, unlike the book and the characters themselves - except for cliches like the radio announcer. The rest of the time, they seemed to want to make it into a sort of ""Ken Burns' Seabiscuit.""And then there were so many weird inconsistencies: like the black guy who's silent through the first 2/3rds of the movie and then suddenly starts talking.And the sappy, intrusive music when what you want to hear is the typical loudspeaker with the racing announcer's descriptions - at least part of the time, so you feel you're actually at a racetrack.And all that 4th grade Depression history! And the narrator carefully explaining what you know already but leaving out all the details you'd actually want a head's-up on. And the script insouciantly making dialog and events up on the fly so that you feel they had thrown the book out the window, but then inexplicably retaining details unimportant to Seabiscuit's story, like the whole history of the owner's automotive business, his divorce, and his remarriage, as well as the bordello scene (in which Toby Maguire is shown with a prostitute even though Hillenbrand said there was no evidence Red Pollard had gone to one)....Why in the world make this into a PG-13 movie in the first place? Wouldn't it have made a better family film?Clearly it was a difficult book to make into a script. And it's gotten great reviews. I just can't agree.

616344,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,B00005JMCN,David A. Baer,"[1, 2]","The matching white casts worn by spunky Seabiscuit and anger-in-motion jockey Red Pollard (Toby Maguire) near the end of this beautiful movie remind us that the story it tells is not about a horse. Nor is it, as some have alleged, just about the people with the horse standing in as equine eye candy.It's about both. Two white casts. Two stories of healing from the pits of disposability, anger, hopelessness. 'We all get a little banged around', Jeff Bridges' elegantly acted character tells us.Seabiscuit is a feast for the eyes, for the ears, and for the heart.An historian who writes like David McCullough should not be allowed to have a voice like that. It's not fair.  And it's the first human sound you hear in this superbly crafted movie. It lends a true-to-life frame to the move, one that the soundtrack leads you to intermittently, so that you don't forget: something like this really happened, and not that long ago. The Great Depression was a defining moment for this country - ignoring for just one moment the rest of this interconnected world - and it lives on as the wolf at the door for those who know those who knew what it meant in shattered lives and down-the-drain assumptions about hard work and its expected fruits.A little horse with an attitude came along just at the right moment to show people stuck in life's mosh pits that there might be more to the story. It's about the future, Jeff Bridges' 'Mr Howard' tells us, seeming quite nave at times, except for the now obvious fact that he was right.The story has its poetry and its music. Randy Newman manages a score that is at once sonorous and understated, perfectly complementing the horse and its people without once intruding on the foreground, where it does not belong.The casting is superb: Bridges' upside-down thoughtful scowl is humanized by the light in his eyes. He carries his pain around in a heart that can still respond. He also bears his privilege lightly, becoming the target of a greater number of metaphorical slaps on the butt from common people without seeming to mind, or even to notice.That's the poetry, someone says, as he watches the Biscuit run. But it's on the human side of the rail too, in this sympathetic film.Tobey Maguire as the too-tall jockey. Red Pollard distinguishes himself in a serious film, and Cooper's character is magic. When Cooper's Tom Smith talks to a horse and Newman's score gently merges sound with sight, you realize you're in the hands of craftsmen who are unlikely to disappoint. And they don't, pulling this story off in a way that justifies the accolades it received.Elizabeth Banks' Marcela.  Aah. Are there actually women this beautiful at thirty, or is that just lights and mirrors?  A check of her filmography shows that the toothy girl-next-door unselfconsciousness of her persona is real, natural, and perhaps ever so slightly lamented as a determiner of the kinds of roles that come her way. No matter, Lizzy. Just keep doing what you do.Arguably, the best wide scene in the movie occurs at Santa Anita Park, I believe, when the camera catches the infield crowd running for angle, a scene you can only truly appreciate if you've experienced public pandemonium and the momentary glimpse of chaos that it offers.What a movie.

Such added substance keeps the audience interested.  The emotional aspect of the plot is wonderfully expressed through the words and the events.  It wonderfully keeps this film unique rather than the average horse racing movie.The actors follow the emotional value brilliantly.  Whether they express pain, anger, happiness, determination, or sadness, they always perform at their finest.  Tobey McGuire and Jeff Bridges capitalize this.  McGuire takes his career to new and better levels with his demanding role as the determined horse racer.  His character's painful childhood is never held back with his reactions to everything in life.  Bridges behavior roles express his character's turbulent times perfectly.  This is his best role in years.  Chris Cooper's acting quality in this movie lives up to his Oscar winning role in &quot;Adaptation&quot;.  His character's love for animals is obvious thanks to him.The set-up construction and the costume designs are accurate to the American early 1900's style.  Obviously, the artists researched this time period thoroughly.  Even the character's make-up is flawless.  The months spent perfecting every detail paid off.&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a great movie for those looking for something great and inspiring.  This is sure to please many audiences for a long time.  Some may have to watch it more than once to fully understand all the details, but in the end, many will be glad once they did.",5,And the Winner Is.....Seabiscuit,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,1874,"['quot', 'Seabiscuit', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'releases', '2003', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'more', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'determined', 'follow', 'dream', 'being', 'horse', 'racer', 'writers', 'brilliantly', 'combine', 'two', 'other', 'stories', 'man', 'business', 'hurting', 'Great', 'Depression', 'man', 'determined', 'save', 'horses', 'slaughtering', 'Such', 'added', 'substance', 'audience', 'interested', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'plot', 'wonderfully', 'expressed', 'words', 'events', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'unique', 'rather', 'average', 'horse', 'racing', 'movie.The', 'actors', 'follow', 'emotional', 'value', 'brilliantly', 'express', 'pain', 'anger', 'happiness', 'determination', 'sadness', 'always', 'perform', 'finest', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'capitalize', 'McGuire', 'career', 'new', 'better', 'levels', 'demanding', 'role', 'determined', 'horse', 'racer', 'character', 'painful', 'childhood', 'never', 'held', 'back', 'reactions', 'everything', 'life', 'Bridges', 'behavior', 'roles', 'express', 'character', 'turbulent', 'times', 'perfectly', 'best', 'role', 'years', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'acting', 'quality', 'movie', 'up', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'quot', 'Adaptation', 'quot', 'character', 'love', 'animals', 'obvious', 'thanks', 'him.The', 'set-up', 'construction', 'costume', 'designs', 'are', 'accurate', 'American', 'early', '1900', 'style', 'Obviously', 'artists', 'researched', 'time', 'period', 'thoroughly', 'Even', 'character', 'make-up', 'flawless', 'months', 'spent', 'perfecting', 'detail', 'paid', 'off.', 'quot', 'Seabiscuit', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'looking', 'something', 'great', 'inspiring', 'sure', 'please', 'many', 'audiences', 'long', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'fully', 'understand', 'details', 'end', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'once', 'did']",N/A

I was able to read the book by Laura Hillenbrand prior to viewing the movie. The book was lengthy and very detailed, but an excellent job was done to condense it into such a great movie. There could not have been a better cast of actors to portray each character of the book, nor could there have been a better production staff for the film.  While watching this movie, it is difficult, (if not impossible), not to get enthralled in the emotion and excitement of the lives of each individual in the story.  And I must say that having a good tv sound system added another super-dimension to viewing this, as the movie's sound and sound editing were excellent.

616349,A3RQWGYU848KYV,B00005JMCN,"Debby ""Dreamy Debb""","[3, 3]","Adapted from the novel with the same title, Seabiscuit is a movie dealing with soul searching, ventures, and hopes in life. Not only is it another movie promoting courage and human tenacity, the historical setting of the Great Depression vitalizes the three male protagonists whose destinies were linked by coincidence.Charles Howard, played by Jeff Bridges, was a successful entrepreneur who hit the goldmine with the automobiles he developed by chance. However, things went upside down when the Great Depression caused the collapse of his enterprise, his only son killed by his very own automobile, and his wife's subsequent leave. On the other hand, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a veteran horse trainer who became underappreciated and isolated after the depression. Red Pollard, played by Tobey Maguire, was abandoned by his parents at young and struggled to support himself both on a horse race course and a boxing ring, ending up black and blue.The three miserable men met and stake their ambitions on horse racing. After tying the knots with his second wife, Howard returned to his aspiring self and decided to venture on horse racing. He later recruited Smith and together they found Seabiscuit, a small horse whom Smith believed to possess unlimited potential. Pollard happened to be the only person who could placate Seabiscuit's wild temper and consequently he became the jockey. Together Seabiscuit and Pollard conquered most competitors in a number of races. However, awful truths were revealed and later other accidents occurred, so they had much more to overcome...While the plot may be another clich&eacute; aimed to inspire people, the narration throughout the movie remains entertaining and the acting is superb. The little horse was expertly trained and really makes viewers believe that it has lived the story. In addition, the movie's 141-minute running time enables it to insert depth which prevents it from falling in the foul category of inane comedies.To stand up again after numerous times of stumbles is the key to American spirit, and this movie really epitomizes the refusal of conceding. Although such optimism appears unrealistic at times, it is what people like to believe. Thus, the movie is truly an excellent piece of wish fulfillment, showing that everything is possible.",4,A heartfelt approach to American dream...,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2306,"['Adapted', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Seabiscuit', 'movie', 'dealing', 'soul', 'searching', 'ventures', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'promoting', 'courage', 'human', 'tenacity', 'historical', 'setting', 'Great', 'Depression', 'three', 'male', 'protagonists', 'destinies', 'were', 'linked', 'coincidence.Charles', 'Howard', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'successful', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'hit', 'goldmine', 'automobiles', 'developed', 'chance', 'However', 'things', 'went', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Great', 'Depression', 'caused', 'collapse', 'enterprise', 'only', 'son', 'killed', 'very', 'own', 'automobile', 'wife', 'subsequent', 'leave', 'other', 'hand', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'was', 'veteran', 'horse', 'trainer', 'who', 'became', 'underappreciated', 'isolated', 'depression', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'played', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'was', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'young', 'struggled', 'support', 'horse', 'race', 'course', 'boxing', 'ring', 'ending', 'up', 'black', 'blue.The', 'three', 'miserable', 'men', 'met', 'stake', 'ambitions', 'horse', 'racing', 'tying', 'knots', 'second', 'wife', 'Howard', 'returned', 'aspiring', 'self', 'decided', 'venture', 'horse', 'racing', 'later', 'recruited', 'Smith', 'together', 'found', 'Seabiscuit', 'small', 'horse', 'whom', 'Smith', 'believed', 'possess', 'unlimited', 'potential', 'Pollard', 'happened', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'placate', 'Seabiscuit', 'wild', 'temper', 'consequently', 'became', 'jockey', 'Seabiscuit', 'Pollard', 'conquered', 'most', 'competitors', 'number', 'races', 'However', 'awful', 'truths', 'were', 'revealed', 'later', 'other', 'accidents', 'occurred', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'overcome', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'aimed', 'inspire', 'people', 'narration', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'acting', 'superb', 'little', 'horse', 'was', 'expertly', 'trained', 'really', 'viewers', 'believe', 'lived', 'story', 'addition', 'movie', '141-minute', 'running', 'time', 'insert', 'depth', 'falling', 'foul', 'category', 'inane', 'comedies.To', 'stand', 'up', 'again', 'numerous', 'times', 'stumbles', 'key', 'American', 'spirit', 'movie', 'really', 'refusal', 'conceding', 'such', 'optimism', 'unrealistic', 'times', 'what', 'people', 'believe', 'Thus', 'movie', 'truly', 'excellent', 'piece', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'showing', 'everything', 'possible']",N/A

Maybe because I read the book first, enjoying the authors obvious love of horses and extensive reasearch she and her &quot;helpers&quot; did. I don't know, I found the direction and writing filled with too many Hollywood cliches. Ross' annoying direction, moving the camera in a haphazard way, giving the impression to me that alot of the scenes seemed like practice shots, testing how the camera should move. In some ways, his direction reminds me of William Shatner's direction on Star Trek V. The camera moves with no purpose, and it should. Also, I thought the music score was all wrong for the film. A score can help a story, but Newman's music appears to show the films flaws even more. Overall, I liked the story and the cast, though I felt Ross took a lot of liberties. Which,most of the time, does not bother me. I realize compressing a book to give it a linear feel on the silver screen sometimes calls for such alterations, but I felt they hindered the film -including Macy's turn as the radio announcer, a completely made up character. I was reminded through the whole film of Bob Ueker's role in the Major League films. This was a drama, filled with many hard realities -like the weight issue which seemed to glossed over also - and adding a character that would not have been out of place in A League of Their Own was a lame attempt at adding humor.",3,"Loved the story, hated direction",1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,1449,"['First', 'was', 'disappointed', 'adaptation', 'Hillenbrand', 'well', 'written', 'bio', 'Maybe', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'enjoying', 'authors', 'obvious', 'love', 'horses', 'extensive', 'reasearch', 'quot', 'helpers', 'quot', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'found', 'direction', 'writing', 'filled', 'too', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'Ross', 'annoying', 'direction', 'moving', 'camera', 'haphazard', 'way', 'giving', 'impression', 'alot', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'practice', 'shots', 'testing', 'how', 'camera', 'should', 'move', 'ways', 'direction', 'William', 'Shatner', 'direction', 'Star', 'Trek', 'V.', 'camera', 'purpose', 'should', 'Also', 'thought', 'music', 'score', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'score', 'can', 'help', 'story', 'Newman', 'music', 'show', 'films', 'flaws', 'even', 'more', 'Overall', 'liked', 'story', 'cast', 'felt', 'Ross', 'took', 'lot', 'liberties', 'Which', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'bother', 'realize', 'compressing', 'book', 'give', 'linear', 'feel', 'silver', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'such', 'alterations', 'felt', 'hindered', 'film', '-including', 'Macy', 'turn', 'radio', 'announcer', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'character', 'was', 'reminded', 'whole', 'film', 'Bob', 'Ueker', 'role', 'Major', 'League', 'films', 'was', 'drama', 'filled', 'many', 'hard', 'realities', 'weight', 'issue', 'seemed', 'glossed', 'also', 'adding', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'place', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'was', 'lame', 'attempt', 'adding', 'humor']",N/A

Pauzer,"[4, 4]","The psychologist, Carl Jung described synchronicity as the experience of two or more events that are apparently causally unrelated occurring together in a meaningful manner. This story brings three figures together in synchronicity: Red Pollard played by Tobey McGuire, Charles Howard played by Jeff Bridges, and Thomas Smith played by Chris Cooper. A jockey that was too big (5'7""), a trainer too old, a horse that was too small, and an owner too dumb to know the difference. The horse that was too small, at 15 hands, was Seabiscuit.Charles Howard moved west with 21 cents in his pocket as a bicycle salesman who became the richest man in California once he started selling the horseless carriage. The loss of his son in a truck accident and the subsequent separation from his wife change the man's life. He meets a drifter and plainsman who loves horses and understands them. He is Thomas Smith. Together they look for horses to buy, and Smith sees something in the eye of one of them and convinces Howard to pay the $8,000 price. Smith also notices a hot-tempered jockey who was abandoned by his family at an early age. He thinks he will be the perfect match for the horse that slept and ate too much--Red Pollard. The cantankerous two take an instant like to each other.Pollard, Smith, and Seabiscuit are underdogs in the time of the Great Depression where underdogs were something to be cherished and cheered. The bowlegged, graceless horse begins to win race after race and captures the imagination of a nation. The horse that is too short starts to win with a jockey who believes in holding the horse back until it can see the eye of the horse next to it, and then lets him loose destroying the spirit of the competition. Howard decides to push for a match race between Seabcuit and the lord of the east, War Admiral, who at a sleek 18 hands, seems to be an easy winner. Radio announcer ""Tick-Tock McLaughlin"" played by William Macy plays up the match race and adds a humorous touch to the movie.This double DVD series is a great buy. The first is the movie, and the second offers: Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral, the 1938 Match Race; Winners' Circle: The Heroes Behind the Legend; HBO First Look; The True Story of Seabiscuit. The photo book contains a few pictures from the movie and should be inconsequential in your consideration. In addition to the superb acting and story line, David McCullough provides an outstanding narration much as he did for the series, ""Civil War."" This gives the film the feel of a docu-drama.This is a story about a horse and people who interacted in a way that gave purpose to each other. There's no handicap in watching this.P. S. It would be nice if all the parts of real life ended as the movie. Howard owned several horses, but none ever achieved the stature of Seabiscuit. He would die in California in 1950. Thomas Smith became the top horse trainer in the country. Red Pollard suffered numerous injuries as a jockey, but one injury led him to fall in love with the nurse attending him. He married her and had two children. He was less fortunate financially as he ended up as a valet polishing boots of other jockeys. Seabiscuit was retired at the age of seven, and sired other horses. Its heart gave way at the young age of 14 and he is buried at an unknown location on the Howard ranch.",5,The Little Horse that Could--and did,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,3331,"['psychologist', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'described', 'synchronicity', 'experience', 'two', 'more', 'events', 'are', 'apparently', 'causally', 'unrelated', 'occurring', 'together', 'meaningful', 'manner', 'story', 'three', 'figures', 'together', 'synchronicity', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'played', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Thomas', 'Smith', 'played', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'A', 'jockey', 'was', 'too', 'big', '5', '7', 'trainer', 'too', 'old', 'horse', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'owner', 'too', 'dumb', 'know', 'difference', 'horse', 'was', 'too', 'small', '15', 'hands', 'was', 'Seabiscuit.Charles', 'Howard', 'moved', 'west', '21', 'cents', 'pocket', 'bicycle', 'salesman', 'who', 'became', 'richest', 'man', 'California', 'once', 'started', 'selling', 'horseless', 'carriage', 'loss', 'son', 'truck', 'accident', 'subsequent', 'separation', 'wife', 'change', 'man', 'life', 'drifter', 'plainsman', 'who', 'horses', 'Thomas', 'Smith', 'Together', 'look', 'horses', 'buy', 'Smith', 'sees', 'something', 'eye', 'one', 'convinces', 'Howard', 'pay', '8,000', 'price', 'Smith', 'also', 'hot-tempered', 'jockey', 'who', 'was', 'abandoned', 'family', 'early', 'age', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'match', 'horse', 'slept', 'ate', 'too', 'much', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'cantankerous', 'two', 'take', 'instant', 'other.Pollard', 'Smith', 'Seabiscuit', 'are', 'underdogs', 'time', 'Great', 'Depression', 'where', 'underdogs', 'were', 'something', 'be', 'cherished', 'cheered', 'bowlegged', 'graceless', 'horse', 'win', 'race', 'race', 'imagination', 'nation', 'horse', 'too', 'short', 'starts', 'win', 'jockey', 'who', 'holding', 'horse', 'back', 'can', 'see', 'eye', 'horse', 'then', 'loose', 'destroying', 'spirit', 'competition', 'Howard', 'push', 'match', 'race', 'Seabcuit', 'lord', 'east', 'War', 'Admiral', 'who', 'sleek', '18', 'hands', 'be', 'easy', 'winner', 'Radio', 'Tick-Tock', 'McLaughlin', 'played', 'William', 'Macy', 'up', 'match', 'race', 'humorous', 'touch', 'movie.This', 'double', 'DVD', 'series', 'great', 'buy', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'offers', 'Seabiscuit', 'War', 'Admiral', '1938', 'Match', 'Race', 'Winners', 'Circle', 'Heroes', 'Legend', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'True', 'Story', 'Seabiscuit', 'photo', 'book', 'few', 'pictures', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'inconsequential', 'consideration', 'addition', 'superb', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'David', 'McCullough', 'outstanding', 'narration', 'much', 'did', 'series', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'feel', 'docu-drama.This', 'story', 'horse', 'people', 'who', 'interacted', 'way', 'gave', 'purpose', 'other', 'handicap', 'watching', 'this.P', 'S.', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'parts', 'real', 'life', 'ended', 'movie', 'Howard', 'owned', 'several', 'horses', 'none', 'ever', 'achieved', 'stature', 'Seabiscuit', 'would', 'die', 'California', '1950', 'Thomas', 'Smith', 'became', 'top', 'horse', 'trainer', 'country', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'suffered', 'numerous', 'injuries', 'jockey', 'one', 'injury', 'led', 'fall', 'love', 'nurse', 'attending', 'married', 'had', 'two', 'children', 'was', 'less', 'fortunate', 'financially', 'ended', 'up', 'valet', 'polishing', 'boots', 'other', 'jockeys', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'retired', 'age', 'seven', 'sired', 'other', 'horses', 'heart', 'gave', 'way', 'young', 'age', '14', 'buried', 'unknown', 'location', 'Howard', 'ranch']",N/A

First of all, with all the pounding hooves of the horses, their labored breathing under heavy stress, crowd noise, the wind, etc. you cannot carry on a conversation with the jockey beside you as though you were sitting side by side in armchairs in someone's living room.  Secondly, if you are actually astride a galloping horse, the riders motions would be different. It almost seemed as though they were projecting scenes flashing by behind the actor and he was pretending to be riding a horse. (Sorry but it just wasn't realistic.)

No other film this year thus far has been filled with such emotion, beauty, and heart.  ""Seabiscuit"" is a rare gem of a film.  It does not rely on special-effects, explosions, or cheap romances.  The beauty of this film is that it is simply about the pure heart of a horse and the people around him.Writer/Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Big) adapted Laura Hillenbrand's painstakingly researched bestseller into an amazing script.  The story itself is so extraordinary that, if it hadn't happened, wouldn't have been remotely plausible as a film.  If Seabiscuit wasn't a real horse, I would have taken one look at this film and said ""Ridiculous!  Like that could really happen!""  The fact that the story is true makes ""Seabiscuit"" an even more beautiful and emotional journey.Tobey Maguire plays Red Pollard, a half-blind, oversized jockey who was abandoned by his family as a child and now rides the worst horses at the worst races.  Chris Cooper plays Tom Smith, an old fashioned horse trainer who prefers the company of a horse to that of a person who one day finds a barbed wire fence and cars in the middle of his wilderness homeland.  Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, a self-invented millionaire dealing with the loss of his only son.  These three ""broken"" men and a banged up little racehorse unite together and beat incredible odds to become an inspiration to a nation that isn't in the best shape itself.Everything in this film is amazing.  From the remarkable racing scenes to Randy Newman's haunting score, ""Seabiscuit"" is one film you won't want to miss.

I have seen a lot of very well made documentaries on Seabiscuit and one in particular that I saw on PBS just before this film was released on DVD.  So, I couldn't wait to see the movie.

The documentary on PBS contained a lot of exciting horse races that Seabiscuit was in and the narration and story was very well made.  Also, I found the narration in the MOVIE to be out of place - the movie didn't need it.  It's a great story but it was a bit lackluster at times.  The acting and cinematography was very good.  I wonder if my review and rating of this movie would have been different if I had not seen all those great documentaries on Seabiscuit before I watched the DVD - I may have had a better reaction to the film.

What should have been high drama emerged in a curiously static manner.

If a movie version does crop up in the intervening year or two it may take me to get around to a former NYT Bestseller, I can judge it with fresh eyes.  Yes, I do believe that nine times out of ten, the book was better, and that perception can sometimes ruin a perfectly good-of-kind movie.As a librarian, I've been hearing the buzz on Laura Hillenbrand's book for the past year and a half now, both from reading the reviews and just from talking to patrons at my library who have read--and almost universally loved it.  I did happen to catch a recent PBS documentary on the Seabiscuit phenomenon in which Hillenbrand was interviewed extensively.  So I guess I know more about this particular books than the 3,000 others on my list of ""must-reads.""And watching the movie probably tells me even more about this book that I may or may not get around to reading one day.  It's one of those films that is clearly laboring to be faithful to the book that inspired it that it gets a little clunky.  The lengthy expositionary scenes are perhaps the best example of what I'm talking about.  It takes so long for Seabiscuit to actually arrive on the scene, you may start wondering if you're watching the wrong horse movie.There may have been a more expeditious way to show how Charles Howard made his fortune, for instance, or that his first marriage failed after the tragic death of his son.  Conversely, Red Pollard's marriage is not portrayed, even though it was touched upon considerably in the PBS documentary, with his daughter serving as one of the main voices in that film.  Some inclusion of that aspect of Pollard's personal life might have been warranted, since without any reference to adult relationships in his life, he comes across as something of a big (if proud and determined) kid.And speaking of kids, given how frequently twenty-something actors play teenagers, did it really make sense to cast another, younger actor in the role of the adolescent Red Pollard--especially one who looks absolutely nothing like Tobey Maguire?  Has it really been THAT long since THE ICE STORM?Others have already commented on the questionableness of using documentary footage and stills from the period, and David McCullough's voiceovers seem oddly out of place.  I've already seen one PBS doc on this subject, I don't need another.  This kind of movie shorthand is just too obvious.  A more creative way of establishing time and place would have been preferable.I know that fans of this movie are probably already planning to click on the ""unhelpful"" button at this point, but ironically or not, I would still recommend SEABISCUIT.  Once the film gets past all the exposition, it picks up its pace, literally and figuratively, and turns out to be compelling cinema.  The performances are all solid, the cinematography excellent.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","There's THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT and then there's SEABISCUIT, and sorry to Shirley Temple but her version turns out the lesser film. If you've read Laura Hillenbrand's best-seller book but haven't seen the movie, go see the movie - and, vice versy, if you've seen the movie but haven't read the book, read the book. Either way, the Biscuit's story is ridiculously entertaining. That it's also a true-to-life account makes it that much more compelling. Who would've thunk it that one of my favorite athletes of all time would turn out to be a horse?There was a time when Seabiscuit was America's most celebrated personality, getting even more pub than F.D.R. Seabiscuit lived and raced during the Great Depression, the course of his storied life running parallel with the ups and downs of that era. He was the son of Hard Tack, grandson of Man-O-War, and growing up he was abused and so became bitter and incorrigible.  Standing barely 15 hands, the Biscuit was certainly never tapped to be a champion racehorse. His mean upbringing is mentioned, except that the film's first 44 minutes devote themselves to a leisurely introduction of the three damaged men who would shape the Biscuit's career, shape him into a legend. One after another, we meet the visionary entrepreneur (who is a bit of a huckster), the peculiar horse whisperer quietly mourning a vanishing way of life, and the half-blind, overeducated jockey who boxed and quoted Shakespeare.The casting choices are spot-on. There's no bad egg in this bunch, from the principal actors - and how many crazy pounds did Tobey Maguire lose for the part? - down to ancillary characters like George ""the Iceman"" Woolf as played by real life jockey Gary Stevens (in his debut role) and the fun, fast-talking radio announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin, marvelously brought to life by William H. Macy.The races are rousing, pulse-pounding stuff, yeah. The story builds up to the historic match race with War Admiral and later the Santa Anita Hundred Grander, and I couldn't believe how intense my sense of anticipation was leading into these races. And when you bring up that list of best sports cinema, SEABISCUIT is up there with ROCKY and HOOSIERS, because how do you not root for this gutsy ugly little horse? Narrated with quiet assurance by David McCullough, this is something lyrical, a period film that looks authentic and packs an emotional punch. It's also a dynamite history lesson concerning a time when the country was tested severely, and phrases like ""pick themselves up by their bootstraps"" and ""never say die attitude"" circulated like a mother, became rallying cries. Beaten down but never bowed was the Biscuit, and he never quit. You can see why he became the common guy's hero. See this movie. Read the book.The DVD's special features include: audio commentary by director Gary Ross and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh (in which the two pause the movie several times to go even more in depth about certain scenes); ""Bringing the Legend to Life"": the Making of SEABISCUIT (00:15:04 minutes); ""Anatomy of a Movie Moment"" - Gary Ross shares his step-by-step filmmaking process of one sequence from script to screen; ""Seabiscuit: Racing thru History"" explores more of Seabiscuit's stunning rise to celebrity status thru historic newsreel footage of actual races (including clips of his match race with War Admiral) and numerous interviews, including interviews with Gary Ross and author Laura Hillenbrand (00:14:53); ""Photo Finish"" - Jeff Bridges' On the Set photographs; ""The Longshot"" - a special message from Buick, set in a faux newsreel format and which goes into the origins of the Buick auto and also of Charles Howard's involvement (00:03:19);

At some point before or after watching the film, read her book. It fills in the story in a way that no movie can.

The result is history as the film spells out all too well.Although today's economy is not as bad as it was during the early 1900's, it's still an interesting parallel that helps the film.  You know the pain and anguish they are going through and so start to root for them despite knowing that everything will turn out all right in end.

Tobey Maguire, my favorite, as Red Pollard (jockey), brings the perfect blend of bookish, literature-quoting, damaged vulnerability and angry street-wise smartmouth. William Macy, with that unique staccato delivery of his, cracked me up everytime he was on screen as the sound-effect happy announcer.I echo those reviewers who expressed the opinion that the movie starts out slowly and builds interest as it progresses; no matter, so did Star Wars.I enjoyed the extras of the dvd, all of which are interesting and relevant, including a bit of back history about Seabiscuit himself and another on making the film.  (Tobey Maguire as Pollard was sometimes just sitting on a stepladder rather than a real horse in more than one shot!)One thing I have to say about this film: It piqued my interest enough to do a little research as to what became of everyone, the owner, trainer and jockey as well as the horse, after winning their ultimate.  I was somewhat puzzled and disappointed as to why there was no footnote added to the film telling of their fates.  Well, now I know why.  After all that pulling together as a team, they all drifted apart.  Red Pollard slid down the sucess ladder until the point where he was actually just hotwalking racehorses; Seabiscuit himself was put out to stud, but dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 14, not even middle aged for a horse.  I'm really happy those associated with the film chose to end it on such an upbeat and hopeful and positive note, even if it didn't accurately portray their fates.

Real winners may just be losers in disguise, looking for the opportunity to overcome adversity and show their true colors.This actual story of the race horse Seabiscuit and his owner, trainer, and jockey is set against the background of the Great Depression. It is the ultimate feel-good movie. Film writer-director Gary Ross effectively portrays how the actual Seabiscuit and his saga had a galvanizing effect on America's &quot;everyman,&quot; hit hard by hard times, as the down-and-out racehorse became the hopeful parable for their lives. Many of the film's scenes are juxtaposed with black and white still shots taken during the depression era, beautifully illustrating the period, and the tone of the characters. The use of a narrator also lends an air of documentary authenticity to many of the newsreel-like sequences.The cast is excellent. Toby Maguire shines, as usual, in his role as the bruised but not beaten jockey &quot;Red&quot; Pollard. Tom Smith is wonderful as Seabiscuit's enigmatic horse trainer. Mr. Smith's lines may be few but he lends an extraordinary presence to the role and the movie. Wealthy and successful businessman Charles Howard, played by Jeff Bridges, is a man with vision who pulled himself up by his bootstraps only to be thrown by personal tragedy. He bought a loosing horse on the word of a down-and-out trainer and hired a half blind jockey to race him. These characters become inextricably bound as, together, they undergo the journey of a lifetime. William H. Macy, as the fast talkin' radio tipster, and his blonde female sidekick, are show stealers.Seabiscuit somehow manages to avoid lapses into corniness, and against all odds, an equestrian film about an undersized, bad-tempered horse goes for the money and competes successfully with some of the years best films.

Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the ""size 2 women"" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.The Chicago tribune called this film ""sleek and beautiful."" I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series.Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers ""get"" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it?There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.

At its heart, it is the story of a horse that was too small and a jockey that was too big and nobody believed that team could win anything.  Now add the facts that the trainer was nobody that anyone wanted around, the owner didn't know squat about horses, and the jockey was blind in one eye, and you have yourself an unbelievable story that is too strange not to be true.The early pacing of the movie is rather slow and Gary Ross takes the time to establish the era of the movie.  We learn what kind of families these characters came from and what helped shaped them into the men they became.  The early part of the film is narrated by David McCullough (author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book John Adams), who has the perfect narrating voice.  We are presented with the sense of time and place that becomes important throughout the film.  The film is heavy on exposition as we see Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) move out west to open a bicycle shop, but pulled himself up even higher and became incredibly rich selling cars (he makes a comment ""I wouldn't pay $5 for a horse, these automobiles are the future"").  He buys a huge ranch, but puts race cars in the horse stalls.  We see Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) riding his horse in the open range, but coming up against fencing that wasn't always there.  We see a well-off, loving family spending time together.  Then the stock market crashes and the Great Depression hits.  Smith is an outcast, the Pollard family is ripped apart as they send their son, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) to live with someone else, and the son of Charles Howard dies in an accident.  Howard's wife leaves him.  The Depression has broken these men, and it has also broken America.Flash forward six years.  After more than a little bit of exposition to give us the setting, the movie begins to move forward and gets a whole lot better.  The main characters start to come together.  Howard is down in a border town watching a bull fight when he steps outside, not liking what he was watching.  He meets Marcela (Elizabeth Banks), ends up marrying her, and buys a horse to race (she gets him back into riding and more interested in horses).  Howard needs a trainer before a horse, so as they are walking and talking Howard sees a man standing off to the side grooming a horse.  He asks who that man is and is told that he is just some kook.  Howard later approaches Smith and they start talking horses and Smith ends up working for Howard and looking for the perfect horse to buy and race.Seabiscuit, the horse, came from impeccable breeding but disappointed everyone and became a lazy an angry, lazy animal with no interest in much beyond eating.  Tom Smith saw the heart in the animal and convinced Howard to give the horse a chance.  Now all they needed was to find a rider.  Red Pollard was pretty much down and out, having not been the most successful jockey (despite being a natural at it).  He was working, yelling at a horse but treating it well.  Smith saw something in Pollard and brought him in to work with Seabiscuit.  It was a match made in heaven as the horse improved and it appeared he might even be able to race.Now all the important parts have been brought together and from the point that they began to come together the movie is an absolute gem.  We have Seabiscuit overcoming obstacles, winning races and becoming what seems like a national treasure, the little horse that could.  One of the many things this movie does right is the racing scenes.  Even expecting that Seabiscuit will win the races, Gary Ross still manages to make them look exciting and suspenseful.  There are several races and each of them have their own feel.  The most masterful piece of editing comes in the glory race against War Admiral that when the bell sounds the film shifts to documentary style photography of people listening to the radio and we hear the radio broadcast of the race.  I was so impressed with that scene that it was almost a minor disappointment when they went back into race footage (which again, was beautiful and perfectly done).The only quibble I have with the movie is that it leans rather heavily on the metaphor of the little guy being beat down but making the most of a second chance.  Everyone involved with the horse was that sort of ""rising above the circumstances"" story, but the movie pushed the metaphor even further into Seabiscuit (the horse) being the metaphor for all of the millions of Americans hurt by the depression.  It was probably necessary for the film to do this, but I felt that it was pushed at us a little bit too much.  This is only a minor quibble and the rest of the movie more than surpasses this little bit of sentiment.I know that there is half of the year left for movies, but right now Seabiscuit has to be thought of as the first real Oscar Contender.  Cooper, Bridges and Maguire are all stellar, but the real gem (in a movie filled with gems) is the supporting work of William H Macy as Tick Tock McLaughlin, a radio man who provides quite a bit of humor and spark into the film.

Rooney,"[1, 2]","The producers of ""Seabiscuit"" presented a social message in their film: in the difficult Depression years those who were optimistic and overcame adversity were exemplary and emblematic of the American spirit. People needed some underdogs to cheer for.Seabiscuit or as he was affectionately called the Biscuit captured the hearts of the American public because of his come-from behind spunk.Seabiscuit doesn't enter the movie until the movie has told of the lives of three men vital to the horse's story. The entrepreneur car dealer Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is the man who put the Seabiscuit franchise together, but owning a horse was almost an afterthought to him. The movie traces the early, hardscrabble years of horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) and the hardluck journey of a Shakespeare-quoting boxer cum jockey Red Pollard (Toby Maguire).Howard chose Smith to seek out the right horse. Once they had found Seabiscuit, Toby Maguire comes along as the down-at-the-heels jockey who energizes the horse. Both horse and a jockey had a string of bad breaks.At first the horse was cantankerous and difficult to train. Seabiscuit did not have a constant string of victories. He lost the Santa Anita Handicap twice. Howard and Smith became leery about Red when he seemed to pull the horse up in one race, but they forgave him when they learned the truth.Throughout the later stages of the picture Howard was trying to get the owner of triple-crown winner War Admiral to enter his horse in a match-race between the Biscuit and the Admiral.When the famous race is finally set, Red is unable to ride the Biscuit because his leg gets shattered. Later in another race when Seabiscuit's leg is injured, the two cripples rehabilitate each other.William H. Macy has a clownish part as a radio sportscaster who is there to chronicle various stages in the horse's career, but it's a part that isn't an asset to the story. The producers chose not to have the calling of the races by the legendary Clem McCarthy nor did they use any actual newsreel footage. Some of the racing scenes seem phony especially when one sees the jockeys in a race talking in what seems an unnatural manner.The acting is first-rate, most of the racing footage is well-done, and the story is told in the grand manner.

Intermittently, the narration of the events surrounding Seabiscuit, the horse, and the popularity of horse racing during the 1930's was eloquently delivered by David McCullough, whose voice added flair to the historical accounts in Ken Burns' higly acclaimed documentary, The Civil War.Speaking of Ken Burns, had he completed a project that focused on Americam life during The Great Depression, then Seabiscuit might have been regarded as one of the excerpted docudramas but with the added detail and close examination necessary for a great drama in its own right.Though it did not receive an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2003, which went to the immortal classic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Seabiscuit, nevertheless, could pull in the reins to hold its own and come out as a Triple Crown of a theatrical release.",5,I Dig A Pony,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,1188,"['Seabiscuit', 'excellent', 'movie', 'ages.At', 'first', 'had', 'misgivings', 'Just', 'sappy', 'shallow', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'However', 'was', 'fortunate', 'least', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'watch.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'even', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Spider-Man', 'fame', 'was', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'jockey', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'Intermittently', 'narration', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Seabiscuit', 'horse', 'popularity', 'horse', 'racing', '1930', 'was', 'eloquently', 'delivered', 'David', 'McCullough', 'voice', 'added', 'flair', 'historical', 'accounts', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'higly', 'acclaimed', 'documentary', 'Civil', 'War.Speaking', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'had', 'completed', 'project', 'focused', 'Americam', 'life', 'Great', 'Depression', 'then', 'Seabiscuit', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'regarded', 'one', 'excerpted', 'docudramas', 'added', 'detail', 'close', 'examination', 'necessary', 'great', 'drama', 'own', 'right.Though', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', '2003', 'went', 'immortal', 'classic', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Seabiscuit', 'nevertheless', 'could', 'pull', 'reins', 'hold', 'own', 'come', 'out', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A
616411,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JMCN,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 7]","I'm not a horse racing fan.  After seeing SEABISCUIT, I'm still not. But it's a darn fine picture.Seabiscuit was born in May 1934. He lost his first 17 consecutive races. Potential greatness was recognized by trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), who advised Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) and his second wife Marcela (Elizabeth Banks) to purchase the horse in August 1936. In that same month, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) signs on as Seabiscuit's jockey. The rest is history.The title player doesn't even appear for the first forty minutes. Rather we see the sad-sack states that Smith, Howard, and Pollard are in. Smith is an aging horse trainer at the end of his career. Pollard is a talented rider with a drinking problem, plus a chip on his shoulder from being abandoned by his Depression-ruined parents . Howard, though wealthy from selling Buicks, has lost his youngest son in a road accident, and his first marriage has failed. All three could use a winner, and Seabiscuit has the requisite heart.Even a cursory reading of the historical record concerning Seabiscuit reveals that this film, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand, selectively edits the facts, but without interjecting any untruths. And it retains the essence of the story. It's interesting to note, however, that the showdown between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, implied in the movie as the culmination of a rivalry of words between Howard and War Admiral's owner Sam Riddle, and as the only scheduled race including the two thoroughbreds, is misleading. In fact, their November 1, 1938 face-off at Pimlico was the fourth scheduled match-up. Howard scratched Seabiscuit from two of the previous because of muddy tracks, and Riddle scratched his horse from the third. And these weren't the only two occasions when Howard yanked Seabiscuit because of overly wet courses. Also, at the film's conclusion before the credits rolled, I was surprised to see no epilog of what happened to the main characters after Seabiscuit's last thrilling triumph in March 1940. (Seabiscuit retired in April of 1940, and died at a relatively young age in 1947. Howard died in 1950, Smith in 1957, and Pollard in 1981.)Bridges, Cooper and Maguire are all exemplary in their respective roles, although perhaps no one of them will be able to fend off challengers for an Oscar in a Best Actor category as the field gallops down to the December 31 finish. Most watchable is William H. Macy as the frenetic sports announcer, Tick Tock McGlaughlin. I left the theater wishing he'd had more screen time. Banks is pretty and adequate as Marcela Howard, but her role could have been left in the editor's digital trash bin and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference to the script. SEABISCUIT could have been titled THREE GUYS AND A HORSIE.I suspect this will be the first of the 2003 films considered for Best Picture, even if only for sentimental reasons. Americans have always loved a come-from-behind winner, and this movie has four. And the fact that one of them is that icon of the Old West, a horse, won't hurt.SEABISCUIT is a heart-warming, bigger-than-life, heroic epic.

That is the story of the movie opportunity and second chances.Seabiscuit is a wonderful movie for a message of hope. You feel like a winner. Is it too late to take a chance to do great things in life? There is a second chance.Look for the wonderful irony of the movie as well. There are so many scenes where you can see it.The movie will take you to Mexico, Santa Barbara, Saratoga Springs, NY and Santa Anita. This movie is true to life if you know anything about Santa Anita Race Track.The only thing that may challenge some is the language. Did people in those circles really talk that way then? I really wonder, this movie can be for the whole family, but too many places Maguire feels he has to use some form of profanity.

I know some say it was cliche - but the story is TRUE!

Tobey Macguire did a great job as alcholic jockey Red Pollard, and Chris Cooper was outstanding as the horse-whisperer-like trainer Tom Smith.  Jeff Bridges (who is not one of my favorite actors) did a decent job in his role as well.  One of the funniest characters was William H. Macy's announcer during the races, he cracked me up!  Another surprisingly good performance was real life pro jockey Gary Stevens playing Red Pollard's friend and rival, jockey George Woolf.The story is wonderful, taking place during the 1930's when the country is reeling from the Great Depression.  Jeff Bridges character, Charles Howard, is a business man whose wife leaves him after their child is killed.  He suffers from depression and ends up at a horse track where he meets a new girl and ends up buying the unruly Seabiscuit.  He meets up with outcast horse trainer Tom Smith and the unpredictable Red Pollard and the three of them take America by storm with the amazing Seabiscuit.The film is beautifully done.

It makes sense that they'd sense a kindred spirit in one another.2.Jeff Bridges is equally compelling as a man who has lost heart and needs to find a way to feel alive again after suffering a major tragedy. He also has the insight to recognize the potential in an eccentric trainer (played by Chris Cooper), touchy horse and a quick-tempered jockey.3.

I remember being a little girl and reading all the horse books I could get my hands on. Black Beauty and all of Walter Farley's books, and I did read a very short, illustrated one on Seabiscuit.This is a magnificent movie. Many of the panorama views that are done with no voice or talking remind me a bit of The Titanic but with a happier ending. This was truly the meeting of four very damaged beings: 3 men and a battered horse. Their coming together, and the support and care they gave each other led to a winning combination of strength and courage that could not be beat.The cinematography of the movie is absolutely stunning. Bridges is does his fine job that was seen in so many previous movies...how can the Academy and filmmakers miss giving him more outstanding material to work with I will never know. The supporting cast and a very, very thin Toby Mcguire fill out this beautiful film in their parts. I plan to watch this film many times on rainy Saturdays, partly because it is beautiful and because it was uplifting (and I don't gamble!). I can understand how so many people in the U.S. who were in the throes of the Depression found the story of Seabiscuit to be uplifting, and allow them to hope that they too could survive and could also thrive, given an opportunity to do so (which many of the social programs instigated by FDR did do and did build the national infrastructure of highways and national forestry projects/dams that we still depend on).Karen Sadler",5,An extraordinarily beautiful film...,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,1684,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'had', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Toby', 'McQuire', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'not', 'used', 'often', 'enough', 'good', 'movies', 'was', 'horse', 'story', 'remember', 'being', 'little', 'girl', 'reading', 'horse', 'books', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'books', 'did', 'read', 'very', 'short', 'illustrated', 'one', 'Seabiscuit.This', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'Many', 'panorama', 'views', 'are', 'done', 'voice', 'talking', 'bit', 'Titanic', 'happier', 'ending', 'was', 'truly', 'meeting', 'four', 'very', 'damaged', 'beings', '3', 'men', 'battered', 'horse', 'coming', 'together', 'support', 'care', 'gave', 'other', 'led', 'winning', 'combination', 'strength', 'courage', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'beat.The', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Bridges', 'fine', 'job', 'was', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'movies', 'how', 'can', 'Academy', 'filmmakers', 'miss', 'giving', 'more', 'outstanding', 'material', 'work', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'very', 'thin', 'Toby', 'Mcguire', 'out', 'beautiful', 'film', 'parts', 'plan', 'watch', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'rainy', 'Saturdays', 'partly', 'beautiful', 'was', 'uplifting', 'do', ""n't"", 'gamble', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'U.S.', 'who', 'were', 'throes', 'Depression', 'found', 'story', 'Seabiscuit', 'be', 'uplifting', 'allow', 'hope', 'too', 'could', 'survive', 'could', 'also', 'thrive', 'given', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'social', 'programs', 'instigated', 'FDR', 'did', 'do', 'did', 'build', 'national', 'infrastructure', 'highways', 'national', 'forestry', 'projects/dams', 'still', 'depend', '.Karen', 'Sadler']",N/A

At 141 minutes, I was ready for it to end long before it did. The first 30 minutes or so are all background about the people who come in contact with Seabiscuit later in life.

The film would have been more enjoyable if the emphasis was more on the horse and the races and the amazement of the accomplishments. Also, this movie is not really something a child under 13 should see (it is rated PG-13 after all) but I know a few people who took the little ones thinking &quot;oh, this is just a horse movie.&quot; This is not something they will be able to follow or enjoy.",3,"Too long, moved too slow, lacked the big emotional punch.",1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,955,"['First', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Second', 'direction', 'was', 'beautiful', 'However', ""'re"", 'Average', 'Consumer', 'who', 'not', 'looking', 'determine', 'should', 'be', 'next', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'plot', 'moved', 'too', 'slow', '141', 'minutes', 'was', 'ready', 'end', 'long', 'did', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'background', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'Seabiscuit', 'later', 'life', 'opinion', 'staging', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'just', 'focus', 'one', 'person', 'not', 'three', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'emphasis', 'was', 'more', 'horse', 'races', 'amazement', 'accomplishments', 'Also', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'child', '13', 'should', 'see', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'took', 'little', 'ones', 'thinking', 'quot', 'oh', 'just', 'horse', 'movie.', 'quot', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'enjoy']",N/A

You already know how it's going to end (the horse beats all the odds and wins the big race), and yet the journey is so touching and dramatic, you can't help yourself. It is a lovely film.Jeff Bridges has his best acting role to date, as Seabiscuit's millionaire owner who devoted his life to his horse's career. Chris Cooper is the real star of the film.  He plays Bill Smith, the out-of-work horse whisperer who discovers Seabiscuit's heart and trains him to win. Cooper says more with his eyes than most actors say with long speeches.  Tobey Maguire gives a sympathetic performance as Red, Seabiscuit's half-blind jockey.The photography is absolutely breathtaking, from lush, rolling green hills to heart-stopping horse race sequences. Randy Newman's musical score is a winner and stands on its own.  The Depression-era was faithfully reproduced in the costumes, sets, and the wonderful cars.

Based on the bestselling novel by Laura Hillenbrand, the movie stays true to the book all the way. We get details about Pollard's life and where he came to be in the movie as Seabiscuit's jockey. Jeff Bridges is Charles Howard, a man who decided to race horses after the death of his only son involved him dying in a car accident. Howard, who used to race cars before the death of his only son. Chris Cooper is Tom Smith, Seabiscuit's trainer. A old frontiersman, Smith founds his way around the track. Pollard, Howard, and Smith are bought together to help Seabiscuit become one of the best racehorses in American history. Pollard overcomes being blind in one eye, ends up having his leg broken. The movie is excellent without compromise and it is definitely this year's best movie. The production design by Jeannine Oppenwall and the costume design by Judianna Makovsky is magnificent. The casting by Debra Zane is excellent. Randy Newman's score is superb. The editing by William Goldenberg is excellent with timing. The cinematography by John Schwartzman is brilliant without compromise. The script by Gary Ross is a brilliant companion to Laura Hillenbrand's book. Gary Ross' directing is superb and brilliant without compromise. Tobey Maguire is extremely well worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. So does Jeff Bridges deserve a Golden Globe nomination.

616432,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMCN,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","I have a pet theory that says we all fall in love with one horse in our lifetimes.  Maybe it is a horse you actually own, if you are fortunate enough, or maybe you just read &quot;Black Beauty&quot; or &quot;My Friend Flicka,&quot; grew up on stories about Silver or Trigger, or maybe have seen &quot;National Velvet&quot; of &quot;The Black Stallion.&quot;  For me that one horse was Secretariat, thundering down the home stretch at the Belmont to be the first horse in decades to win the Triple Crown, the jockey looking over his shoulder to see how far behind Big Red was leaving the rest of the pack.  Not only was Secretariat the fastest racehorse of all time, still holding the track record for the Kentucky Derby, but he was also to my mind the most beautiful horse I have ever seen.  I watch the Triple Crown races each year, but no horse will capture my heart the way Secretariat did.For those too young to remember that particular horse, it is rather ironic that a whole generation might adopt Seabiscuit as the horse dearest to their heart because of this movie about the plucky little stallion who raced into the headlines during the Great Depression.  The horse surprised everyone by becoming Horse of the Year and the biggest money earner of all time and the book by Laura Hillenbrand became a best seller to the surprise of almost as many people.  Now we shall see if the movie version can pull off the trifecta this summer.&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is not just about the horse that is too small, because as everybody who has seen the trailer knows there is also Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), the jockey who is too big, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), the trainer who is too old, and Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), the owner who is too dumb to know the difference.  But Howard is smart enough to know how to market his horse, although when he spouts aphorisms like &quot;See, sometimes when the little guy doesn't know he's the little guy, he can do big things,&quot; we believe he believes what he is saying.  Even if he is a businessman he is one who believes in his product, whether we are talking bicycles or Buicks, horses or human beings.  Charles Howard proves himself when at a crucial moment in the narrative he asks Red Pollard the question that forces the young man to finally grow up.Howard, and writer-director Gary Ross, both see Seabiscuit as a metaphor for the nation during the Depression, declaring at one point &quot;Everybody loses a couple, and you either pack-up and you go home, or you keep fighting.&quot;  This is not the wisdom of &quot;Rocky,&quot; of finding victory in defeat, but something more akin to the Puritan work ethnic that is the backbone of this nation.  This is reinforced by Smith's dictum, &quot;You don't throw a whole life away just 'cause it's banged up,&quot; which underscores both the idea of finding value in the life of each individual, whether they are a person or a horse, and the importance of every single chance that comes down the road.However, despite the onslaught of platitudes, this movie is lyrical.  The best moments of this film are conveyed by a look in the eye of Seabiscuit or by how many peas Red puts on this plate.  There are lots of scenes without dialogue, or where what is being said are just sounds, akin to the pounding hooves of Seabiscuit.  This movie may remind some of &quot;The Natural,&quot; and not because Randy Newman did the score, but because it has these lyrical moments, all of which involve watching this horse run.  Surprisingly, when Seabiscuit runs, while it is his heart that matters most, it also involves the head of his jockey as well.  Even neophytes will appreciate the strategy involved in winning a horse race and if the quality that we most love about this horse is that he looks his opponents in the eye and then runs them down.The attraction here will be the horse races and while it takes about an hour to start getting around to them there are several as thrilling as anything you have ever seen in a film.  Every time Seabiscuit goes after another rival the platitudes and morals fade into the background as we enjoy a horse running as fast as it can.  I would lay odds that lots of moviegoers are going to lose their hearts to this horse this summer, which is fine, because both the horse and the film deserve that affection.",5,You don't throw a whole life away just 'cause it's banged up,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,4337,"['have', 'pet', 'theory', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'horse', 'lifetimes', 'Maybe', 'horse', 'actually', 'own', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'maybe', 'just', 'read', 'quot', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'quot', 'My', 'Friend', 'Flicka', 'quot', 'grew', 'up', 'stories', 'Silver', 'Trigger', 'maybe', 'have', 'seen', 'quot', 'National', 'Velvet', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Stallion.', 'quot', 'one', 'horse', 'was', 'Secretariat', 'thundering', 'down', 'home', 'stretch', 'Belmont', 'be', 'first', 'horse', 'decades', 'win', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'jockey', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'Big', 'Red', 'was', 'leaving', 'rest', 'pack', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Secretariat', 'fastest', 'racehorse', 'time', 'still', 'holding', 'track', 'record', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'was', 'also', 'mind', 'most', 'beautiful', 'horse', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'watch', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'races', 'year', 'horse', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'way', 'Secretariat', 'did.For', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'particular', 'horse', 'rather', 'ironic', 'whole', 'generation', 'might', 'adopt', 'Seabiscuit', 'horse', 'dearest', 'heart', 'movie', 'plucky', 'little', 'stallion', 'who', 'raced', 'headlines', 'Great', 'Depression', 'horse', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'becoming', 'Horse', 'Year', 'biggest', 'money', 'earner', 'time', 'book', 'Laura', 'Hillenbrand', 'became', 'best', 'seller', 'surprise', 'almost', 'many', 'people', 'Now', 'shall', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'trifecta', 'summer.', 'quot', 'Seabiscuit', 'quot', 'not', 'just', 'horse', 'too', 'small', 'everybody', 'who', 'seen', 'trailer', 'also', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'jockey', 'who', 'too', 'big', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'trainer', 'who', 'too', 'old', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'owner', 'who', 'too', 'dumb', 'know', 'difference', 'Howard', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'market', 'horse', 'when', 'aphorisms', 'quot', 'See', 'sometimes', 'when', 'little', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'big', 'things', 'quot', 'believe', 'what', 'saying', 'Even', 'businessman', 'one', 'who', 'product', 'are', 'talking', 'bicycles', 'Buicks', 'human', 'beings', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'when', 'crucial', 'moment', 'narrative', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'question', 'young', 'man', 'finally', 'grow', 'up.Howard', 'writer-director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'see', 'Seabiscuit', 'metaphor', 'nation', 'Depression', 'declaring', 'one', 'point', 'quot', 'Everybody', 'couple', 'pack-up', 'go', 'home', 'keep', 'fighting.', 'quot', 'not', 'wisdom', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'finding', 'victory', 'defeat', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'Puritan', 'work', 'ethnic', 'backbone', 'nation', 'reinforced', 'Smith', 'dictum', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'throw', 'whole', 'life', 'away', 'just', 'banged', 'up', 'quot', 'idea', 'finding', 'value', 'life', 'individual', 'are', 'person', 'horse', 'importance', 'single', 'chance', 'down', 'road.However', 'onslaught', 'platitudes', 'movie', 'lyrical', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'conveyed', 'look', 'eye', 'Seabiscuit', 'how', 'many', 'peas', 'Red', 'plate', 'are', 'lots', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'where', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'just', 'sounds', 'akin', 'pounding', 'hooves', 'Seabiscuit', 'movie', 'may', 'remind', 'quot', 'Natural', 'quot', 'not', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'did', 'score', 'lyrical', 'moments', 'involve', 'watching', 'horse', 'run', 'Surprisingly', 'when', 'Seabiscuit', 'heart', 'most', 'also', 'head', 'jockey', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'neophytes', 'will', 'appreciate', 'strategy', 'involved', 'winning', 'horse', 'race', 'quality', 'most', 'love', 'horse', 'opponents', 'eye', 'then', 'runs', 'down.The', 'attraction', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'horse', 'races', 'hour', 'start', 'getting', 'around', 'are', 'several', 'thrilling', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'time', 'Seabiscuit', 'rival', 'platitudes', 'morals', 'fade', 'background', 'enjoy', 'horse', 'running', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'would', 'lay', 'odds', 'lots', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'going', 'lose', 'hearts', 'horse', 'summer', 'fine', 'horse', 'film', 'deserve', 'affection']",N/A

The book was a real page-turner, inspite of the fact that most of what's in there is in the movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed both renditions of the wonderful story of Seabiscuit.  The only complaint I would make about the film is that I didn't feel Tobey Macguire was really right for the role of Red Pollard.  The real Red was more physically fragile, yet a great daredevil, with a kind heart and a mischevous nature.  Also, he was, I guess you could say, excitingly average.  He wasn't a great rider, he was a fairly bad boxer, but the sunshine in his life was Seabiscuit-- his bond with the horse is what lifted him to another plane.  Tobey Macguire captures the pain of Red's life very well, and tortured quality of his emotions, the repeated failures both public and private, but there's no way you can make Tobey Maguire a kind of average Everyman.  He's young and handsome and vigorous, and a very good actor [no bad thing] but he isn't Red Pollard.  Particular kudos for acting go to Chris Cooper, Jeff Bridges, Elizabeth Banks and William H. Macy, who are [as always] wonderful and a pleasure to watch.  Even Gary Stevens [George &quot;Iceman&quot; Woolf], who is actually a top jockey in real life, does a highly creditable job in his first trip in front of a camera.  He even had me going for a while [is he an actor or isn't he?] and I'm not easy to fool.

However, it seems in this era of special effects and superheroes that it is difficult to make a movie about characters or historical events that proves that people can be charmed by this type of movie.  ""Seabiscuit"" is one such movie that succeeds in being excellent.""Seabiscuit"" is the true story of an undersized horse with a lot of spirit who met with an oversized jockey with a lot of spirit and an owner with too little spirit and a horse trainer with a focused spirit.  A lot of spirit for one movie, but in real life and in the movie, these people needed each other to be more than they were, and more than they could be.  Indeed, the movie even states that maybe the entire country needed the story of Seabiscuit; maybe they did.The movie starts very slowly.  We quickly meet the three characters who will be instrumental in forming Seabiscuit into a champion, fast forwarding through their life in combination with the events of the ""Great Depression.""  I must admit that initially I had a hard time staying with the movie because of the semi-documentary style of the film and the pacing.  However, bear with this portion of the movie because the character development is important to the second half of the movie.Once the characters come together, we also follow Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire in one of the best acted roles in which he has appeared) as he matures as a jockey and Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) as he returns from the void into which he fell when his son died.  We also have an opportunity to appreciate the character of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), whose life is about horses.  These three remarkable people meet with an abused horse with an ability that only Tom Smith recognized.The movie follows Seabiscuit as he makes a name for himself and West Coast horse racing, eventually challenging the reigning champion of the day, War Admiral, a distant cousin.I am only able to give you the merest hint of the excellence of the cast.  The people selected for their roles performed phenomenally well, and perhaps there should have been more Academy Award nominations for the cast.  As it was, the movie had very difficult competition in the year of its release, overshadowed by ""The Return of the King.""  One character who adds some lightness to this serious movie is William H. Macy as Tick Tock McGlaughlin, a radio announcer.  Watching him create his own sound effects while keeping up a running spiel was fascinating and humorous.I tend to rate movies throughout as I watch them.  This movie started with two stars.  It slowly built to three stars.  At the three quarter point I was up to four stars, and the finish of the movie, which I thought was excellent, allowed me to rate this movie at five stars.  Therein lies my warning to the viewer; give this movie a chance.

616441,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JMCN,magellan,"[2, 2]","I just had a few brief comments on this film.I really enjoyed this film and was surprised at how good it was and how well it kept my interest, especially considering I don't know much about horse racing. I'm usually not too sentimental about films, but this one is truly a heartwarming story about a kindly, big-hearted tycoon who basically takes in three rejects and outcasts: the jockey (Toby McGuire), the old cowboy and horse-trainer (Chris Cooper), and Seabiscuit himself, and with his support and encouragement they overcome all odds to turn into a winning team and make Seabiscuit the most famous racehorse of all time. As Bridges says in one of his speeches to the press, ""Our horse is too small, our jockey is too big, our trainer is too old, and I'm too dumb to know the difference,"" (which gets a big laugh from the crowd).One of the most touching scenes in the movie is when the jockey and Seabiscuit, both recently injured and thought too seriously to ever return to racing, are both shown limping around the estate's grounds together on their long road back to recovery.Also, it's nice to see Ned Beatty is still working. He has a brief cameo as the doctor who advises Jeff Bridges that McGuire shouldn't try to ride since if his injured leg breaks again, he could be permanently crippled and never walk again.I read part of the book before seeing the movie, and there was one fascinating fact there I wanted to mention. The year Seabiscuit was winning all his races he had more mentions in the paper than the president himself--a truly amazing fact and another testamonial to how famous he became. The story of Seabiscuit captured the imagination of a depression-weary America with its tale of an unlikely underdog who eventually defeats the legendary War Admiral to become the champ.I also recall some years ago the Associated Press and ESPN did a 100 greatest athletes of the last century, and Seabiscuit was listed right along with Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Muhammed Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, and other famous names.",5,A few comments,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2043,"['just', 'had', 'few', 'brief', 'comments', 'film.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'kept', 'interest', 'especially', 'considering', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'horse', 'racing', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'too', 'sentimental', 'films', 'one', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'kindly', 'big-hearted', 'tycoon', 'who', 'basically', 'three', 'rejects', 'outcasts', 'jockey', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'old', 'cowboy', 'horse-trainer', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Seabiscuit', 'support', 'encouragement', 'overcome', 'odds', 'turn', 'winning', 'team', 'make', 'Seabiscuit', 'most', 'famous', 'racehorse', 'time', 'Bridges', 'one', 'speeches', 'press', 'horse', 'too', 'small', 'jockey', 'too', 'big', 'trainer', 'too', 'old', ""'m"", 'too', 'dumb', 'know', 'difference', 'big', 'laugh', 'crowd', '.One', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'jockey', 'Seabiscuit', 'recently', 'injured', 'thought', 'too', 'seriously', 'ever', 'return', 'racing', 'are', 'shown', 'limping', 'estate', 'grounds', 'together', 'long', 'road', 'back', 'recovery.Also', 'nice', 'see', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'still', 'working', 'brief', 'cameo', 'doctor', 'who', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'McGuire', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'ride', 'injured', 'leg', 'breaks', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'permanently', 'crippled', 'never', 'walk', 'again.I', 'read', 'part', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'fascinating', 'fact', 'there', 'wanted', 'mention', 'year', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'winning', 'races', 'had', 'more', 'mentions', 'paper', 'president', 'truly', 'amazing', 'fact', 'testamonial', 'how', 'famous', 'became', 'story', 'Seabiscuit', 'captured', 'imagination', 'depression-weary', 'America', 'tale', 'unlikely', 'underdog', 'who', 'eventually', 'legendary', 'War', 'Admiral', 'become', 'champ.I', 'also', 'recall', 'years', 'Associated', 'Press', 'ESPN', 'did', '100', 'greatest', 'athletes', 'last', 'century', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'listed', 'right', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Jesse', 'Owens', 'Carl', 'Lewis', 'Muhammed', 'Ali', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'other', 'famous', 'names']",N/A

For me there is a way to do ""animal movies"" wrong.  When animals are portrayed as almost human I think it's not only unrealistic, but it's disrespectful to both the animals and to humans.I don't doubt that the great race-horses are absolutely incredible athletes.  I don't doubt that they like to run, perhaps even love to race.  I believe that a racehorse can even be competitive and recognizes that he or she is involved in a footrace and wants to beat those horses running alongside.After that I believe they want a drink of water and a bag of oats and to have their lustrous coats rubbed down.  Seabiscuit gets it right.  The three main human characters are revealed gradually: Jeff Bridges' Charles Howard, a likable man who builds a fortune in the fledgling automotive industry and buys himself a racehorse; Chris Cooper's Tom Smith, a horse trainer who understands horses and even moreso, has faith in them; Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard, a jockey whose family has lost it all in the depression, and almost throws away all of his opportunities as well before Howard and Smith and a horse who really likes to run fast rescue him from life's scrap-heap.These stories are interwoven skillfully and you'd have to be a hard-hearted cynic to not feel the thrill in the climactic race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral.",5,A Well-Done and Enjoyable Horse Flick,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,1424,"['are', 'lots', 'movies', 'feature', 'horses', 'dogs', 'other', 'animals', 'sometimes', 'cringe', 'way', 'do', 'animal', 'movies', 'wrong', 'When', 'animals', 'are', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'human', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'unrealistic', 'disrespectful', 'animals', 'humans.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'great', 'race-horses', 'are', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'athletes', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'like', 'run', 'perhaps', 'even', 'love', 'race', 'believe', 'racehorse', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'competitive', 'involved', 'footrace', 'beat', 'horses', 'running', 'alongside.After', 'believe', 'want', 'drink', 'water', 'bag', 'oats', 'have', 'lustrous', 'coats', 'rubbed', 'down', 'Seabiscuit', 'right', 'three', 'main', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'revealed', 'gradually', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'likable', 'man', 'who', 'fortune', 'fledgling', 'automotive', 'industry', 'racehorse', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'horse', 'trainer', 'who', 'horses', 'even', 'moreso', 'faith', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'jockey', 'family', 'lost', 'depression', 'almost', 'away', 'opportunities', 'as', 'well', 'Howard', 'Smith', 'horse', 'who', 'really', 'run', 'fast', 'rescue', 'life', 'scrap-heap.These', 'stories', 'are', 'interwoven', 'skillfully', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'hard-hearted', 'cynic', 'not', 'feel', 'thrill', 'climactic', 'race', 'Seabiscuit', 'War', 'Admiral']",N/A
616445,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B00005JMCN,MarlowesMom,"[0, 0]","""Seabiscuit,"" writer-director Gary Ross's film of Laura Hillenbrand's beloved biography of the Depression-era champion racehorse and the men who owned and trained him, is far from a perfect film. Scene after scene is bathed in the golden light of early morning or late afternoon. It's got that stately pace, fanatic attention to period detail, sweeping score and overweening prettiness that beg for Oscar nominations. Because Ross is trying to reach a broad audience, his script frequently trips over itself trying to educate viewers about a part of history (the Great Depression) and a sport (horse racing) with which many of us have lost connection. I did not care for Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, which struck me as self-pitying rather than the tough, funny, desperate character of the book. In scenes where the characters are supposedly interrupting each other, the interruptions sound contrived. Fans of Hillenbrand's book will catch and perhaps call Ross out on the way he condenses and eliminates facts to serve his purposes. He clearly wants to tell the inspiring story of Seabiscuit, but he also wants to contrast the ""we're all in this together"" helping hand approach of FDR's New Deal with the ""you're on your own"" attitude and ever-widening gap between the wealthy and the rest of us during the Bush II era. I could give dozens of examples, but a particularly glaring one, cited by other reviewers, is the scene where Pollard tells Seabiscuit's owner and trainer that he is blind in one eye. Ross wants to show that his hero, Seabiscuit's owner, is not the kind of guy who would give up on someone just because he's down on is luck. Well-intentioned it may be, but as Hillenbrand's book makes clear, in real life Pollard would have been banned from racing for life had anyone known about his partial blindness. Hillenbrand's fans will also miss her breakneck pacing.Even so, I adore this movie and have watched it with my kids at least 20 times. As one review I read at the time of its release said (in effect), ""This is not that great of a movie, so how come I burst into tears every 15 minutes?"" The thing is, the story is really that moving, that often. I can't say how much I appreciate the times when Ross could have gone for the jugular of audience manipulation with close-ups of tears, emotional speeches and 1001 violins, but he doesn't. Instead he pulls the camera back, quiets the cheering crowd, turns the music down, and lets the audience find and feel for itself the grief, or the horror, or the romance, or the triumph over adversity. ""Seabiscuit"" is also blessed with a high number of genuinely funny scenes. Most ""feel-good"" movies make me feel like a victim of cheap film school trickery, but I find watching ""Seabiscuit"" to be an honestly inspiring experience.SPOILER AHEADI'm also happy to report that, unlike in the book (which of course had to go there since it was a biography of a horse foaled in 1933), in the movie, Seabiscuit does not die in the end. I read a lot of books and see a lot of movies about horses. The horse almost always dies in the end, and  I hate it when that happens. It does not matter how often I've read the same book or seen the same movie; even though I know it's coming and try to steel myself, I bawl my eyes out every time the horse dies--it's embarrassing.If you like the movie and have not read the book, read the book. Even though it will break your heart many times, the book is one of the best I've ever read.NEGATIVE COMMENT ABOUT THE RACING INDUSTRY AHEADHorse racing is a thrilling sport, as you'll learn from the book and the movie. It's also a sport with a a dark underbelly that neither the book nor the movie explores. I understand, at least at a superficial level, the difference between the humane approach and the animal rights approach. I personally fall into the former category. Without getting into that philosophical debate, the troubles with racing from the humane perspective are numerous, but the main ones are these. The thoroughbred industry breeds too many horses. A horse is not a dog or a cat: he needs a lot of space,  a lot of food, costly vet care and normally lives 25 years or more. His racing career is typically over no later than age 6. What do we do with all the racehorses who never win money for their owners or who stop winning money for their owners? Ship them out of the US to slaughter mostly, a tragic fate for an intelligent, sensitive, beautiful animal without which human civilization would not exist as we know it. Second, while some horses bred for racing can be retrained for other careers in the show ring or lesson barn, the way horses are bred, trained and raced contributes to breakdowns that frequently render them unsuitable for other careers. Only a limited number of people can afford to keep horses as pets. Most owners need their horses to generate some income  by giving riding lessons or having paying clients compete with them in the show ring. In the quest for new speed records, thoroughbreds are bred more for speed than soundness. They are broken to ride and raced under saddle too young, before their bones and muscles are fully developed, leaving them prone to unnecessary injuries. A farrier (who is no bleeding heart by the way; his truck is covered with ""Bush-Cheney"" and ""Drill Here Drill Now"" stickers) told me that he refuses to work in the racing industry because racehorses' hooves are intentionally and unnaturally trimmed with long toes and short heels. This makes them run faster but forces them to carry their weight in an imbalanced way, again leading to unnecessary injuries. Some owners are conscientious enough and well-off enough to make lifetime commitments to their racehorses, but they're still racing them too young. I believe it's possible to reform the sport and keep it exciting, but the way the racing business is currently carried out, I refuse to support it financially. Instead I support horse rescues to the extent I am able.  According to Hillenbrand, gambling is what keeps the racing industry financially healthy. If anyone reads this review I would encourage you to do your own research before you go to the track or place a bet.",4,A Film to Love In Spite of its Flaws,1305158400,"05 12,

Not enough of it causes the viewers not to relate to the characters and/or the story. Too much of it, and we feel used and abused. To me, ""Seabiscuit"" gets it about right. It's a gloriously old-fashioned movie about rooting for the underdogs. It's an ancient form of storytelling, but ""Seabiscuit"" tells its tale exceptionally well.Based on a true story, this is about three men and a horse. All of them were in need of a second chance in the midst of The Great Depression of the 1930s. The horse, Seabiscuit, was from a noble bloodline, but was small and seemingly lazy. His original owners sold him off for next to nothing. He was eventually bought by Charles Howard [Jeff Bridges], a man who made a fortune selling cars but who was devastated by the death of his son in an auto accident. Howard chose as Seabiscuit's trainer Tom Smith [Chris Cooper], a man who saw his beloved West fenced in by civilization. The jockey was Red Pollard [Tobey Macguire], who was abandoned by his parents when he was a teenager. These men and their horse went on to become folk heroes by winning race after race. Eventually, they challenged the biggest and best race horse of the day.The acting ensemble does a remarkable job despite the script's being one of the movie's weaker elements. It has too many platitudes and predictable responses. The cinematography by John Schwartman and his crew is brilliant and amazing, and since the subject is horse racing, it is appropriate that the visuals take precedent over the dialog. Also helping to make ""Seabiscuit"" a winner are the simple but moving score by Randy Newman, as well as the wonderful re-creation of the look of America in the 1930s.",4,Exceptionally well-made horse racing drama,1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,1798,"['Part', 'job', 'movie', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'emotions', 'manipulation', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'bell', 'curve', 'Not', 'enough', 'viewers', 'not', 'relate', 'characters', 'and/or', 'story', 'Too', 'much', 'feel', 'used', 'abused', 'Seabiscuit', 'right', 'gloriously', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'rooting', 'underdogs', 'ancient', 'form', 'storytelling', 'Seabiscuit', 'tale', 'exceptionally', 'well.Based', 'true', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'horse', 'were', 'need', 'second', 'chance', 'midst', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930s', 'horse', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'noble', 'bloodline', 'was', 'small', 'seemingly', 'lazy', 'original', 'owners', 'sold', 'off', 'next', 'nothing', 'was', 'eventually', 'bought', 'Charles', 'Howard', '[', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', ']', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'fortune', 'selling', 'cars', 'who', 'was', 'devastated', 'death', 'son', 'auto', 'accident', 'Howard', 'chose', 'Seabiscuit', 'trainer', 'Tom', 'Smith', '[', 'Chris', 'Cooper', ']', 'man', 'who', 'saw', 'beloved', 'West', 'fenced', 'civilization', 'jockey', 'was', 'Red', 'Pollard', '[', 'Tobey', 'Macguire', ']', 'who', 'was', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'men', 'horse', 'went', 'become', 'folk', 'heroes', 'winning', 'race', 'race', 'Eventually', 'challenged', 'biggest', 'best', 'race', 'horse', 'day.The', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'remarkable', 'job', 'script', 'being', 'one', 'movie', 'weaker', 'elements', 'too', 'many', 'platitudes', 'predictable', 'responses', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Schwartman', 'crew', 'brilliant', 'amazing', 'subject', 'horse', 'racing', 'appropriate', 'visuals', 'take', 'precedent', 'dialog', 'Also', 'helping', 'make', 'Seabiscuit', 'winner', 'are', 'simple', 'moving', 'score', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 're-creation', 'look', 'America', '1930s']",N/A

616450,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JMCN,M. Burns,"[0, 0]","Occasionally, I'll return to a movie that I used to love when I was a kid (or just a few years ago) and wonder how I ever failed to notice how damn cheesey the thing was. One of my all-time faves remains An Affair To Remember, but I still have to grit my teeth through a few scenes of prissy dialogue and schmaltzy execution. Gone With the Wind verges on camp sometimes, but I can't pull the smile that stretches from ear to ear off of my face. That's somewhat how I felt when I finally caught the much-hyped Best Picture-nominee Seabiscuit tonight, and I find myself pleasantly surprised by it all.If you've seen the trailer, you know the jist: three men with various disappointments in their lives come together and collectively make the little racehorse that could, Seabiscuit, a national treasure. Well, I guess it's not necessary to see the trailer either - it's firmly based on a true story that was immortalized in Laura Hillenbrand's runaway bestseller of the same name. Director Gary Ross deserves credit for making a movie that always remains enjoyable, occasionally becomes unbearably suspensful (those racing scenes!), but ever so often becomes a little too treacly for its own good.The movie is pretty sound except for some of Ross's awkwardly written dialogue that comes off as heavy-handed and corny. A few times, I expected Chris Cooper's character to look into the camera and say in that gentle voice, &quot;If you watch this next double-take I do, you'll see a metaphoric connection my character makes between Red Pollard and Seabiscuit. Pretty damn clever, ain't it?&quot; Jeff Bridges rich-but-haunted Howard likes to say things that sound like they came from the signature of someone's e-mail account. And then there's Tobey Maguire's Red Pollard that quotes Shakespeare and makes us all feel smart for putting two and two together. You'll roll your eyes, guaranteed, but you also won't be able to shake the warm, triumphant tone of Seabiscuit that ultimately wins out.And that's how it all levels out. Seabiscuit is, overall, a kind of movie that you think you might have seen made in 1950 - it has the charm, nostalgia, and simple progression that is never challenging but always engaging. I really liked Seabiscuit, and that sounds like a dumb, non-movie-critic-ey thing to say. But that form of affection is what the movie evokes - sweet, beautifully shot, and one that will have you up and cheering for that climactic race. You'll probably have it all predicted and maybe even say some lines before they happen, but the two hours and twenty minutes will fly and you won't even remember digging your hand into that popcorn.We critics and avid filmgoers often tout difficult, disturbing works like 21 Grams and Elephant (neither of which I truly loved) and pooh-pooh on mass-audience fare like Seabiscuit. Yeah, Seabiscuit didn't get me thinking about the nature of violence in America or the metaphysical notions of the afterlife, but it got me thinking about horses, races, and good photography.

I wonder how that will affect his racing... We see a boy driving up a hill with a car coming in the opposite direction. Could they collide? We see Seabiscuit running on a track. Ironically, two men are fixing a very large tractor or somethin directly next to the track. Perhaps something will happen! We see Jeff Bridges looking for a guy to look after sea biscuit. I wonder who that man could be? We see in the papers that there is a horse dominating the races, and Seabiscuit wants to race the horse. I wonder who will win?I just pointed out 5 or so things that are so predictable right when the movie starts. The film is so lifeless that it drags along in my opinion.

Yet the story of Seabiscuit still has resonance, meaning and pathos even for our jaded and chaotic times for it is a story of conquering insurmountable odds and taking advantage of second chances.A couple years ago with Laura Hillenbrand's novel (Seabiscuit: An American Legend), we were once again reminded of a time in the United States when soup kitchens, the WPA, the CCC, FDR, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the subsequent Depression were the unavoidable facts that affected lives and the race horse, Seabiscuit was revered as the emblem of what little was right in the world.Gary Ross's version of Hillenbrand's novel goes for the heart and the common humanity in all of us and re-tells the true story of a racehorse that became a genuine National hero: a hero in the same league as The Babe or Joe Di Maggio.Though the basic story is very strong, Ross goes for the easy, melodramatic route too many times to make this film superior. Robert Redford covered much of this material in The Horse Whisperer, and to better effect. One of the major flaws is the voice over narration, which works in the PBS documentary ""Seabiscuit""because of the limited time and resources available to the TV filmmakers. But Ross had many millions to work with and here the voice over (though, as usual beautifully intoned by David McCullough) is a cheap, pandering effect. Film is all about ""show me"" Not ""tell me."" In may cases, Ross not only uses the voice over but also the images to get his point across which translates into a hammering over the head effect that treats us, his audience like dunces. We get it Ross...enough already!Tobey Maguire's soulful performance as Red Pollard, the jockey who rides Seabiscuit to many of his wins, is all about the eyes. Because it's through Maguire's deeply troubled and horribly sad eyes that we experience a life wracked with physical and psychic injury. Maguire's Red is more sinned against than sinning and though emaciated in physique as well as spirit, he always manages to dust himself off and begin again.""Seabiscuit""could have been a great film but as it is it's merely a good one.

Apart from this minor curiosity, Cooper nails yet another role.Why did Jeff Bridges and Elizabeth Banks, Mr. and Mrs. Howard spend so much time around horses and barns, what was the fascination?

616461,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMCN,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 1]","The end of July always seems to be a bit of a drag at the box office and no more so then this year. The summer of 2003 has been a pretty disappointing season with most, if not all, sequels failing to live up to their predecessors and potential blockbusters falling hard just after barely leaving the gate. The only highlights this summer would includ Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, both of which belong to the Walt Disney Company. Disney is leading the way as they seem to be the first studio this year to reach the $1 billion mark and could potentially win the year despite competition from The Matrix Revolutions and The Return of the King. Though Universal is pretty far in the back of the pack (#4 at time of publication), they hope to make it up by grabbing some Oscar gold instead. The late July release date for the film may be weird choice if you want your film to be ?Oscar bait? but the studio is hoping that the film will generate the same amount of buzz at last summer?s Road to Perdition so when it comes to nomination time, the film will remain somewhat fresh in the mind of voters. And with the deadline for consideration pushed up this year, Seabiscuit has a lot better chance at getting a couple of nominations then 2002?s Perdition, or at least that?s what the Universal suits are hoping for.The story of Seabiscuit is based on the true story of the ?little horse that could? which was depicted in Seabiscuit: An American Legend, written by Laura Hillenbrand. The film follows the events surrounding the lives of Red Pollard, Charles Howard, and Tom Smith in the 1930?s. Around this time the country is desperately trying to pull itself together after The Great Depression of 1929 but nothing seems to going right for any of the main characters. Charles Howard, who made a fortune by introducing the Buick automobile to the American West, has lost his son in an automobile accident and, in event, loses his relationship with his wife. Tom Smith loses his purpose performing in the Wild West show thanks to the introduction of the automobile in the West and so goes into seclusion. And Red Pollard, who was given up by his parents during the Depression, stumbles from horse racing to boxing just trying to make a living. These three very different individuals come together after Howard purchases a gangly horse named Seabiscuit in 1938 and decides to race the horse despite overwhelming odds. With ?a horse that?s too small, a jockey who?s too big, and a trainer who?s too old?, Seabiscuit gathers the attention of the public and raises the hopes of a struggling nation. The story for Seabiscuit is a well-balanced blend of humor, suspense, emotions, and historical context, something that is rarely achieved altogether by most ?Oscar bait? flicks as of late. The historical background sequences are quite possibly the most important aspect of the feature as the way they are set up and delivered does not make the audience feel as though they are being dictated to and flowing through another typical history lesson.The talented group of actors and actresses that make up the respectable cast for Seabiscuit are probably the real reason why this film is, and will be in the months to follow, considered an Oscar potential. Tobey Maguire, who starred in Oscar nominated Cider House Rules, is best known on the big screen for his role as Peter Parker in the smash hit, Spider-Man, but he shows his true brilliance as an actor in the role of Red Pollard. Maguire showcases a lot more emotion in Seabiscuit then in the role that made him famous in the mainstream and shows that he can still perform at the level of Oscar potential dramas. Chris Copper, who won an Oscar for his role in Adaptation, is right on the money as Tom Smith though his character isn?t shown as much as the other three lead male roles. Elizabeth Banks, who also starred in Spider-Man with Maguire as a secretary at the Daily Bugle, receives her first lead role and does a pretty good job with it. The problem lies mostly in the fact that there is so little information given on her character, like where she came from and such, that you don?t feel as attached with her character as much as the three main leads. One of the biggest highlights of the cast is William H. Macy, who is right on target with his performance as a 1930?s radio announcer. Macy rambles on with crazy one liners while being accompanied by sound effects which makes the historical background all the more engaging.Overall, Seabiscuit, unlike past ?Oscar bait? dramas of the summer, clearly and proudly defines itself as solid sports-drama right from its direct burst out of the gate all the way to the genuine feel-good ending, despite tending to lag behind the pack near the finish line. Though that being said, there are sufficient problems in the film that, in turn, hurt it just enough to prevent a perfect rating from being scored. The time length of two hours and thirty minutes simply feels twenty minutes too long. It would have been more effective if the filmmakers had ended the film with Seabiscuit beating War Admiral as the last twenty minutes that do mark the film?s ending seemed dragged out and disrupted the overall flow that had been present. Another problem that was frequent throughout the feature was the transition sequences that showcased no dialogue or sound, just musical score with quick cut scenes that ended up confusing the audience more then moving the story along. But those gripes, Seabiscuit plays out ten times better then a sports-drama of this quality would normally play out to so wide an audience. What makes this horse picture superior above the rest is the Ken Burns/PBS Mini-series historical allusions presented between scenes that help set the audience up for what the country was like at that time without having it drag out into a boring history lesson. It may not be an instant classic but its good enough to spend a hot summer afternoon with.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Seabiscuit' is a Winner,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,5992,"['end', 'July', 'always',

Cast off as an ill-tempered loser, the great race horse not only contrived a stunning second act for himself, but also for the three men who made him a champion--owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith and jockey Red Pollard. Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book retold the story for a new generation, and Gary Ross' film adaptation of the book should now serve to etch it permanently on the American memory. Even people who are indifferent to horses will fall in love with Seabiscuit and root for his ultimate victory. Ross and cinematographer John Schwartzman create some of the most exciting racetrack scenes ever committed to film. But contributing even more to the film's overall impact are the deeply moving performances of the film's trio of stars--Jeff Bridges as Howard, Tobey Maguire as Pollard and Chris Cooper as Smith. Each is impressive individually, but each gains immeasurably from the sheer perfection of the ensemble playing. Like Tinker to Evers to Chance, they're a perfect team, acting in perfect sync with each other. (One should also put in a good word for their teammates--William H. Macy, bringing in much-needed comic relief as the racetrack broadcaster Tick-Tock McGlaughlin, and Elizabeth Banks as Howard's supportive wife Marcela.) The first 30 minutes or so of the film takes its leisurely time introducing Howard, Smith and Pollard and telling their tragic back stories; though this exposition is absolutely necessary for the film to achieve its full impact, it also may cause you to start nodding off until the moment when Smith and Howard meet. From that second, everything clicks into place, and the movie becomes a magnificent race to the finish line.

616464,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMCN,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","During the Great Depression, Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) a former bicycle repairman who made a fortune selling automobiles, acquires an under-performing thoroughbred horse named Seabiscuit. Under the tutelage of a patient trainer named Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) and ridden by a down-and-out jockey named Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), Seabiscuit thrives, winning race after race to the astonishment and delight of racing fans across America. Charles Howard, being a great salesman, shrewdly presents Seabiscuit's successes and failures as a metaphor for what Americans are experiencing in the Depression, helping the horse become the most written about and adored public figure in 1938.""Seabiscuit"" is based on the best-selling book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand, and was directed and written for the screen by Gary Ross. This is a classic feel-good story, beautifully told, about three men, Howard, Smith, and Pollard, who have experienced great loss in their lives, but who are brought together by a horse and a dream. That horse and the dream they have for it fill the voids in the lives of these men and go on to provide hope and  happiness to millions of Americans who are also suffering from great losses during the Depression. If it weren't a true story, it might be a little too sweet. But it is a true story, as can be seen in old newsreels and newspapers. Horse racing was one of the most popular sports in America at the time, and Seabiscuit inspired a nation.A book can tell more stories successfully than a movie can, and Gary Ross has done a good job of selectively adapting Hillenbrand's 416-page book into a film. Ross demonstrates especially good judgment in what not to show the audience. Several key events in the story are not revealed on screen, but instead we see reactions to them. This leaves the audience on the edge of its seat, but  sucks us in all the more. Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper are excellent in their roles, as we have come to take for granted from these great actors. Another great, William H. Macy is hilarious as the fictional race track announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin. George Woolf, the celebrated jockey who rode Seabiscuit in his famous match race against War Admiral, is played convincingly by another celebrated jockey, Gary Stevens, a Hall-of-Famer himself. ""Seabiscuit"" is a heartening slice of American history and an enjoyable story for all ages.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Gary Ross and producer Steven Soderbergh, a ""making of"" documentary, ""Anatomy of a Movie Moment"" featurette in which Gary Ross explains how he creates a scene, a documentary about horse racing in the 1930s and the real Seabiscuit, Jeff Bridges' on-set photography, bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The ""making of "" documentary features a lot of interviews but discusses nothing in enough depth to be very informative or interesting. I recommend the documentary about the history of horse-racing and the audio commentary if you have the time.

An absolutely picture-perfect recreation of a era not recently seen in modern film...the Depression.I had no idea that in the year 1938, this horse occupied more column inches in the newspapers than Roosevelt (#2) or Hitler (#3).

There are so many delightful moments...thoughtful touches that ""tell the story"" in most powerful ways. And this is a great story told VERY well.The inter-jockey interplay during actual races is terrific. A decision to NOT show a tragic event on-screen, followed by agonizingly silent segments, are far more effective than a traditional special-effect-and-sweeping-orchestral-flourish moment. Horse races are always cleanly conveyed...you know who's where, and what our jockey is thinking.""Our jockey"" being Red Pollard, sharply portrayed by Tobey Maguire. Even better is Chris Cooper. Although he finally has received recognition from the industry, I don't think the public knows how truly gifted he is. He's a joy to watch.Jeff Bridges, as usual, is solid.

Ross' screenplay is witty, poetic...it has depth and detail.As the director, Ross does the same from behind the camera. Just as poetic, with lovely images, thrilling racing sequences, some drop-dead gorgeous vistas...well done Mr. Ross!Everything from the production design, to the cinematography, to the music (can Randy Newman EVER do wrong?) is so ""right"" for this movie, that you won't notice it until after the credits roll.You're WAY too busy being caught up in the tale of this amazing horse, his owner, his trainer and his jockey.There are very few guarantees in the movie biz.

Studios simply do not cough up $80 million on a horse race movie with little or no CGI or an ensemble cast that may (operative word &quot;may&quot;) appeal to young audiences.  But kudos to Universal for taking a chance on writer/director Gary Ross' adaption of Laura Hillenbrand's novel &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; the story of a hardluck horse who found his way to greatness.  To get him there, he needed the help of three emotionally bruised or distant men.  One is C.S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) the founder of Buick, his owner, who lost his marriage and his son in a short time frame.  Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire) is his jockey.  Left by his family who wanted him to have a better life, Red is too big for a joackey and too blind to ride.  Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is the Biscuits' taciturn and eccentric trainer, but one who has an almost mystical understanding of what makes horses tick.  When these three come together, they start winning, and healing each other.Writer/Director Gary Ross avoids corniness and cliche by making these stories seem genuine instead of contrived, and he gets a lot of help from his cast, who do the story justice.  Chris Cooper is engaging as he hits all of Tom Smith's quirks and labored speech, Tobey McGuire gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance yet as the ailing jockey and Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the billionaire who found himself again after his divorce and his son's death.

616468,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005JMCN,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[6, 6]","It is rare that a horse movie is exciting, touching, AND believable. Moreover, it is rare that a movie based on a true story fully captures that story. But ""Seabiscuit"" accomplishes it all. As a horseback rider and racing fan myself, I tend to be extremely critical of horse movies, but this one takes all five stars and change. I've yet to see a better horse movie. Set in Depression-era America, ""Seabiscuit"" is the true story (adapted from the best-selling biography by Laura Hillenbrand) of an underdog racehorse by the same name. Misunderstood and mistreated as a colt, the plain, unimpressive little horse with imperfect conformation has a career that's going nowhere.Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a shattered man. His wife leaves him after their son dies in an automobile accident, and he closes down his car racing outfit and heads to the border towns of Mexico looking for escape. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a cowboy who finds the Wild West vanishing under his feet, is left as a drifter without much of a future. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) was left as a boy by his family, who hoped he might do better for himself as a racehorse jockey. He earns a little extra money as a fighter, but a severe blow to the eye leaves him half-blind. Ultimately, these three downtrodden men manage to find each other, and Seabiscuit, and embark on the journey of a lifetime.With Howard as owner, Smith as trainer, and Pollard as jockey, Seabiscuit manages to win race after race on the West coast. It seems they have it made. But then Smith points out that Seabiscuit has yet to race against War Admiral (son of the great Man O'War), the Triple Crown winner who many believe to be the greatest racehorse in America. Howard takes it upon himself to arrange a match race between the two horses, but War Admiral's owner is uncooperative, viewing Seabiscuit as an over-hyped nag that isn't worth the time. Seabiscuit's team eventually wins out and a match is arranged. Shortly before the race, however, Pollard breaks a leg in a freak accident, leaving him out of commission, perhaps permanently. Legendary jockey George Woolf (Gary Stevens) is called in to ride Seabiscuit in the match (I won't reveal the outcome, though perhaps you can guess). In a later race, Seabiscuit injures a tendon, and it looks as if he'll never race again. At this point Seabiscuit and Pollard, both battered and broken, find kinship in each other. Over time, they both begin to mend. Could the two possibly end up making the comeback of a lifetime?I'll warn those of you who have read Hillenbrand's book that the movie does not strictly adhere to it. It would be impossible to fit all of a 400+ page book into a 2-hour movie, so much is left out. But the movie is still satisfying in its own right. In fact, you might say it has a happier ending, as the movie cuts out at the height of Seabiscuit's career, whereas the book continues on to the deaths of all its main characters. But the movie still manages to capture the basic essence of the book. I loved the fact that the story is interspersed with slideshows of real photographs, where a narrator provides historical background information. It makes the movie feel slightly more like a documentary, but not overly much so. The cinematography itself it beautiful, as is every location at which parts of the movie were filmed.Every single actor turned in a superb performance. I was apprehensive about seeing ""Spider Man"" as a racehorse jockey, but Tobey Maguire quickly banished all my doubts. Not only does he come across as a convincing horseman, but he gives his character a wonderful depth of emotion and sensitivity. Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper are equally impressive in their roles. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise for me was seeing Gary Stevens, a man I've long admired as a real racehorse jockey (he rode such great horses as Thunder Gulch, Point Given, Winning Colors, Serena's Song, and Silver Charm), put out a very convincing performance as George Woolf. He was quite impressive, considering that ""Seabiscuit"" is his first and only movie. William H. Macy adds humor to the story as ""Tick-Tock"" McGlaughlin, an eccentric radio host and the only non-historical character in the film.Though I think any horse person will find ""Seabiscuit"" to be a wonderful film, I recognize the fact that it may not hold appeal for all audiences. Someone with no interest in horses may very well find the movie boring, as horses are undeniably the focal point here. But by the same token, my father isn't a horse person at all, and he loved the film. So if horses really aren't your thing, use your own best judgement in deciding whether or not to see the movie. But if you are a horse person, I would recommend this film most highly. Unlike many horse movies, it is accurate and believable (much thanks to real-life jockey Chris McCarron, who helped ensure the realism of the race scenes). It is also very touching, even tear-jerking at times, yet doesn't venture into the superfluous.The DVD has several great bonus features. ""Seabiscuit: Racing Through History"" provides additional information on Seabiscuit's career, including interviews with director Gary Ross and writer Laura Hillenbrand. ""Bringing the Legend to Life: The Making of Seabiscuit"" is a good making-of featurette, revealing much of the work that went into this production. ""Anatomy of a Movie Moment"" shares more of the film-making process. ""Photo Finish: Jeff Bridges' On the Set Photographs"" is a nice gallery of pictures taken during production. Finally, there is commentary by Gary Ross and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh. If you love horses, this DVD is more than worth the money. It will remain a cherished part of my collection for years to come.",5,THE very best in horse movies!,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,5742,"['rare', 'horse', 'movie', 'exciting', 'touching', 'AND',

616469,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B00005JMCN,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","**May contain spoilers**I'm a sucker for a movie about horses.  Doesn't matter if its a racehorse, plow-horse, whatever, I just like hearing their stories.  And lets face it, they're pretty to look at to.  And Seabiscuit, because it's true, is even better of a tale.After going to California with just a handful of change, Charles Howard makes it big due to his know-how with the automobile and their rising popularity.  He quickly becomes one of the richest men in the West but a tragic accident that kills his son leaves him lonely and divorced.  It's then that he meets Marcella and she reintroduces him to horses, making him want to have a racehorse of his own.  With the help of a drifter/quiet trainer named Smith they find Seabiscuit.  Seabiscuit has been trained to lose but there's some spirit left in him.  They just need to find a jockey that will fit his temperament.  So in comes Red Pollard, a kid abandoned during the depression who hasn't done well at the tracks but has just as much of a fiery temper as Seabiscuit does.Characters:Tobey Maguire: Red PollardJeff Bridges: Charles HowardChris Cooper:  Tom SmithElizabeth Banks: Marceela HowardGary Stevens: George WoolfWilliam H. Macy: ""Tick Tock"" McLaughlinThe cast was pretty well done in this movie.  I think Maguire did a good job as Red.  He was certainly feisty enough although he did look a little too big to be a jockey, even considering Red was on the bigger side for jockeys.  By contrast, Gary Stevens was the perfect size and exactly as you would envision a jockey.  Jeff Bridges as Charles Howard was quite wonderful.  I just wanted to give him a big hug throughout most of the movie because he was such a nice decent guy, and a character you could really connect with.  And he knew how to work a crowd.  The only character I didn't really like was Elizabeth Banks as Marcela.  I just didn't think she seemed spirited enough, and actually she seemed somewhat superficial.I can't say that the movie followed the book or even the real history exactly right.  There were a few things changed to make it more Hollywood like and I missed some of the parts that were true.  Especially in regards to Red's history, there was a lot missing there, including the real reason he was blind in one eye.  But there was a lot that was accurate, and I'm glad they tried to keep it at least a little consistent.  I thought it had a good mix of racing and character development.  At least I didn't find myself growing bored at any one part.  It is exciting to watch the horses race.  Even if you know who's going to win it still gets your heart pumping.  And nothing in this movie was too objectionable, there was a little bit of fighting and drinking, but nothing overtly risque and I don't think there would be any problem with young children watching it.The music was mostly instrumental.  I honestly didn't really pay that much attention to it as it was just background noise.  It did seem consistent with the tiems though and there was some big band in there that I enjoyed.  And the cinemotography was great.  There were a lot of good shots and the picture was very clear, even while racing.  And I did like that they incorporated some old photographs into the mix and some black and white film on the modern shots.  It just made it seem that more authentic and even a little bit of a history lesson.A nice movie.  I'm still in the process of reading the book but I did enjoy it quite a bit and don't think watching the movie will spoil the book for me.  After all, it is history.Review by M.

Although Seabiscuit did not reflect his sire's physical attributes and demeanor, Seabiscuit no doubt reflected his speed and desire to compete.  This true story is not only a wonderful account of Seabiscuit's triumphs, but incorporates the story of his owner, his trainer and his jockey all of whom needed each other in more ways than just on the track.C.S. Howard (Beau Bridges) was a self-made businessman who went from working in an automobile factory to running his own automotive franchise.  Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a horse whisperer/trainer who understood the heart and soul of a horse.  Johnny ""Red"" Pollard (Tobey McGuire) had the natural ability to ride although a head taller than the average jockey.  These three men have a destiny that will cross paths and lead them to personal as well as professional success.The story incorporates the history of the great depression era which affected Red Pollard as a mere teenager separating him from his family as well as the impact the automobile had on society which offered C.S. Howard the opportunity to gain wealth in the West.Seabiscuit was a colt that was overlooked from the very start.  Due to his smaller size (slight of 15 hands) and laid back mannerisms, Seabiscuit was used primarily as a racing companion for other horses when he is spotted by Tom Smith.  Smith convinces Howard to purchase the horse for the then low rate of $2,000.  From there Seabiscuit becomes the horse to beat.  His biggest challenges will lie with a duel with War Admiral (a Triple Crown winner) and with a comeback after a serious injury.This is one of those heart-warming the-underdog-always-triumphs stories.",4,Seabiscuit is a Winner!,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,1801,"['Seabiscuit', 'was', 'great', 'son', 'Man', 'War', 'know', 'anything', 'horse', 'racing', 'Man', 'War', 'was', 'one', 'not', 'thee', 'best', 'horse', 'ever', 'race', 'Seabiscuit', 'did', 'not', 'reflect', 'sire', 'physical', 'attributes', 'demeanor', 'Seabiscuit', 'doubt', 'reflected', 'speed', 'desire', 'compete', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'account', 'Seabiscuit', 'triumphs', 'story', 'owner', 'trainer', 'jockey', 'whom', 'needed', 'other', 'more', 'ways', 'just', 'track.C.S', 'Howard', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'was', 'self-made', 'businessman', 'who', 'went', 'working', 'automobile', 'factory', 'running', 'own', 'automotive', 'franchise', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'was', 'horse', 'whisperer/trainer', 'who', 'understood', 'heart', 'soul', 'horse', 'Johnny', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'had', 'natural', 'ability', 'ride', 'head', 'taller', 'average', 'jockey', 'three', 'men', 'have', 'destiny', 'will', 'cross', 'paths', 'lead', 'personal', 'as', 'well', 'professional', 'success.The', 'story', 'history', 'great', 'depression', 'era', 'affected', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'mere', 'teenager', 'separating', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'automobile', 'had', 'society', 'offered', 'C.S', 'Howard', 'opportunity', 'gain', 'wealth', 'West.Seabiscuit', 'was', 'colt', 'was', 'overlooked', 'very', 'start', 'Due', 'smaller', 'size', 'slight', '15', 'hands', 'laid', 'back', 'mannerisms', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'used', 'primarily', 'racing', 'companion', 'other', 'horses', 'when', 'spotted', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Smith', 'Howard', 'purchase', 'horse', 'then', 'low', 'rate', '2,000', 'Seabiscuit', 'horse', 'beat', 'biggest', 'challenges', 'will', 'lie', 'duel', 'War', 'Admiral', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'winner', 'comeback', 'serious', 'injury.This', 'one', 'heart-warming', 'the-underdog-always-triumphs', 'stories']",N/A

You can either be swept up in the lush sentimentality, or you will roll your eyes at the schmaltz-appeal.  Either way, it is an impressive adaptation of the popular bestseller and successfully recreates the look of the early 20th Century with exacting detail (The Wardrobe Designer is to be especially lauded, although whoever was in charge of hair made some curious choices with wigs and pieces).  Tobey McGuire is typically excellent (he is also an Executive Producer)as is Chris Carter.  Jeff Bridges is charming as ever, but somehow doesn't manage to convey the chemistry with his male costars that the moviemakers and press representatives relentlessly touted.  Elizabeth Banks, looking lovely, has virtually nothing to do and is relegated to a lot of &quot;Go Biscuit!&quot; cheers, but in the filmmakers' defense--there probably wasn't much else for the ladies to do.

Sure the film is sentimental, schmaltzy, syropy good-fun and intensely melodramatic. Since when did any of these qualities go out of fashion?

The DVD is solid with rich colors, natural flesh tones, deep blacks and perfectly rendered shadow and contrast levels. There's a bit of a haze in several scenes, but nothing to distract. A hint of shimmering crops up but in general, digital anomalies are absent. The audio is 5.1 and very well balanced - with a real deep bass that kicks up during the racing scenes.EXTRAS: A few.

I must tell you that although the style and cinematography (as we called it in the old days) of this film is strongly reminiscent of the assembly-line films of the 1940's-50's, that is also its great strength. It is one of the few modern movies that can literally appeal to everyone. (I generally hate to use that catchphrase,because to me it smacks of mediocrity,and this movie has its share...) but in this case I apply it because it has an enduring theme. Everyone can find something to like in the Horatio-Alger-like (or maybe, for today's younger citizens, Schwarzenegger-like...?) tale of people who wound up in the public eye because they were found by the right people, at the right time, and in the right place. In the 'Biscuit's case, he ran his tail off for some time before he was ""found"". I saw the movie first and then read Hillenbrand's really beautifully written book, and as a result, renewed my interest in horses (what little girl didn't love horses?) and our local historic track, Bay Meadows. As a result I am becoming involved in saving a track in the middle of the most computer-driven community in the country. The town council, San Mateo, seems to want to sever all ties to the very earthy world of horse-racing. Bay Meadows belongs to the WORLD. Ok, Amazon will likely delete my comments, but if they don't, PLEASE look at Bay Meadows website (a logical guess at the address) and check the history...if you love Seabiscuit, help preserve a famous track he ran on.

There are times when we watch movies that are based upon true events and yet, the context of them are warped beyond recognition.  For this instance, the Director opts to remain faithful to Hillebrand, the lady who lived &amp; breathed the subject, Seabiscuit for most of her adult life.  It's probably a David versus Goliath movie, of a talented thoroughbred that was overlooked &amp; was mistreated.  The jockey in the form of Macguire's character, Red was leading a parellel life.  Somehow or rather, their lives intertwined with Howard (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), the owner of Seabiscuit who was forever looking towards the future.  Ironically, it's the future that tragically took away his beloved son's life.  Anyhow, as Red narrated in the movie, people in the Depression believed that Seabiscuit healed them and that it drown their sorrow somehow.  However, he thought that people healed themselves when they started to believe in their own abilities.  Definitely a triumph of the human spirit movie.  A DVD to be treasured with extras such as the original racing footage versus the movie footage, the making of the movies, the commentary by the Director.

616485,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JMCN,P Magnum,"[1, 1]","Seabiscuit was one of the greatest horses in horse racing history.  His racing captivated America during the Great Depression, giving them an underdog they could identify with and root for.  Gary Ross' adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller does an excellent job of capturing the Americana set forth in the book.  The problem is that it is impossible to get into the details of Seabiscuit himself, the protagonists and the life surrounding the horse racing industry like the book in a 2 and 20-minute movie.  One is probably better off at seeing the movie first and then reading the book then the other way around, as there are big gaps between what happened in the book and what is shown on the screen.  That being said, Seabiscuit is still immensely entertaining.  The race scenes are exhilarating and they take you right on the horse's back.  The acting is also superb.  Tobey Maguire continues his rise as one the best young actors in movies.  Mr. Maguire has a strong likeability and one can't help but rooting for his character, jockey Red Pollard, to overcome his devastating injury.  Jeff Bridges is the master of the understated performance and gives yet another excellent turn as auto magnet Charles Howard.  William H. Macy is hilarious as he provides comic relief as the track reporter and announcer Tick Tock McGlaughlin.  While Chris Cooper is fine as trainer Tom Smith, but where as his character was a major player in the book, he seems regulated to a secondary role in the film.

I had been waiting for it for a while, seen several video clips and trailers, read the novel to prepare myself, and was convinced that it was going to be a fine piece of work.  And it was.  But it didn't meet my expectations.Why?, you ask.  I am sure the reason for my slight disappointment was the fact that I had read the book beforehand.  For the first half of the film, my mind told me that something was missing.  This missing link is not the result of any of the filmmakers' mistakes...it is simply difficult to capture the feel of a 339-page novel in a film that is less than 3 hours long.Despite this, the movie is completely enjoyable.  Overflowing with humor and drama, no one should leave insatiated.  Tobey Maguire is absolutely brilliant as Red Pollard!  Don't get me wrong, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper give fine performances, but Maguire is just marvelous.  This man is undeniably one of the most talented actors to ever live.  Performances like his make me wish that I was able to act.Fans of the book might be frustrated.  A lot of the novel's content is cut out, obviously due to time constraints.  However, most of what needs to be shown is shown.Despite what critics say, ""Seabiscuit"" is not a family movie.  There is a fair amount of profanity, and one scene is set in a brothel.

There was no mystery to me what needed to be cut; all the narration regarding the Great Depression.  If you know about America's Great Depression, the intersperced narration wasn't going to enlighten you.  If you didn't know anything about the Great Depression, the narration would have been too incomplete.  In addition, the efforts to cinematically bring together several persons from several different backgrounds was way too overdone.  This overdone backdrop in ""Seabiscuit"" is an example of what good film-editting is for.  Great film-editting often goes unnoticed because we are better focussed on the film.  Poor editing confuses, interupts and boors the audience.All the complaints above are what went through my mind while I was enjoying glimpses of a potentially great film.  The suspense, action, excitement and all keep getting brushed aside by psychological examinations of our two-legged actors.  The acting was a mixed bag.  Some was fairly decent and I thought Chris Cooper's generally lethargic style fit well in ""Seabiscuit"" as a trainer who seemed liked he'd been kicked in the head by a horse too often.

616497,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JMCN,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Seabiscuit (Gary Ross, 2003)Judging by the polarized reviews given to me by people I trust, people I don't trust, and friends who know far more about how horses should look than I do, I expected to either love this movie or hate it. What I didn't expect was the middle-of-the-road reaction I ended up with.I always seem to forget Jeff Bridges as an actor, despite his fabulous performances in movies as diverse as Starman, Jagged Edge, and Tucker. He can take just about anything and make himself into it. And he does this quite well with Seabiscuit owner Charles Howard, self-made millionaire and general blowhard. Chris Cooper is excellent (if a bit too loquacious) as trainer Tom Smith, and Tobey Maguire does a capable job of playing Red Pollard, finally proving he can act. And when the three of them get together with Fighting Furrari (who was the ""main"" actor among the many horses who played Seabiscuit), the movie is magic.I don't know conformation from constipation. If you put Seabiscuit (often described as short, ugly, deformed, etc.) next to Man o' War (often described as one of the perfect specimens of the breed), I'd probably not be able to tell them apart without nametags. So I can't react to many of the details I've heard are incorrect about various parts of the movie. Others have done so far more capably than I. I'm also not going to make exhaustive comparisons with the book, since I read it roughly three hundred books ago and don't remember many details, though all three of the human characters mentioned above seemed to be different than they were portrayed in the book. The one criticism I do have with the last hour and a half of the movie is that, let's face it, two jockeys traveling forty miles an hour on the backs of two racehorses are not going to be able to have long rambling conversations. Try it with a friend of yours out the windows of two cars going the same speed, and see if you can hear your pal as well as Tobey Maguire hears Gary Stevens, and vice versa. Ain't happening.So in other words, the last ninety minutes were great. Inspiring. Amazing. Beautifully shot. Everyone went above and beyond the call. (Slap a coat of paint on Fairplex and uproot some hedges and you could make it look like Pimlico, but they actually went out and shot at Pimlico.) The ending was a little over the top and emotionally manipulative, would have had the same power without the voice-over, but that's to be expected from American movies. Can't really fault the filmmakers for that.The first hour, on the other hand, would have benefited from an editor with a slightly firmer hand; say, the Torso killer. What took sixty long minutes to convey could have easily been done in twenty. And those twenty could have been a mite clearer. (I knew who Tom Smith was supposed to be, because Chris Cooper looks like a heavier Tom Smith. I've heard others say they had no idea until well into the movie.) I understand what they were trying to do, and it was something I despaired of when I first found out the movie was going to be made. The book centers on Seabiscuit, but paints the larger picture of why he so captured the national imagination. That's something that, if you're going to do it in a movie, should be integrated with the plot, in the details. Look at, for example, Bladerunner. You learn everything you need to learn about the world in which the characters live without needing an hour of setup at the beginning; it's all in the details and doesn't interfere with the plot. The same could easily have been done here, but the screenwriters took the easy way out and have us an hour of setup before we got to the action.Still, it was a good film. All the performances, especially that of Jeff Bridges, were well-done, the direction was capable, and the racing scenes were very nicely scripted given the impossibility of directing horses.

616499,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JMCN,Robert Moore,"[10, 11]","The greatest problem for the movie SEABISCUIT is the book SEABISCUIT, and given the latter's enormous success as a bestseller, I am rather surprised that they filmmakers didn't try to hew more closely to the book.  Granted, given the need to compress the much larger content of the book into the less information-friendly film, things had to be cut out and compressed.  What I found especially disturbing were a couple of major plot details that did nothing to add to the movie otherwise, but in fact were profoundly untrue.  The first of these that bothered me was Red Pollard's confessing to Smith and Howard that he was blind in his right eye, a secret he in fact kept throughout his career as a jockey.  Also, Pollard suffered twice from serious injuries, but because of runtime for a film of this sort, they had to compress the injuries into one, the second one that primarily involved his shattered leg.  Again, many liberties were taken here:  he did not shatter his leg only two weeks before the match race at Pimplico, but sometimes earlier.  And by cutting out Pollard's injury, we are left with the false impression that it was the match race where Woolf rode Seabiscuit as well.See, this is the plight of the person who reads the book shortly before seeing the movie (I read the book on Wednesday and head to the Chicago suburbs to see the movie on Friday):  you end up knowing too much.  I'm not disturbed by what they leave out, but I am bothered by what they put in and alter.  ...  The movie made some unfortunate though perhaps unavoidable changes with Seabiscuit himself.  He was much shorter than the horses he raised, though stockier and short legs.  The horses used to portray Seabiscuit weren't especially notable for their lack of size.  More importantly, none of the horses playing Seabiscuit were able to lock their legs, which Seabiscuit was famously unable to do.  This meant that Seabiscuit, unique among horses, could never sleep standing up, but only lying down.  The inability to lock his legs led to a life-long rumor that he was either crippled or lame.  But no mention to his truly awful legs was made throughout the film, I suspect because they weren't able to find a horse whose legs didn't lock.Overall, I think the film was very well cast.  Jeff Bridges, who has one of he most dramatically underappreciated careers in Hollywood, is superb as Charles S. Howard, automobile magnate turned horse entrepreneur.  Chris Cooper excels as Tom Smith, taking on an ashen and aged appearance that is perfect for the film (he looks so different from his Oscar winning role in ADAPTATION that it is hard to accept he is the same actor).  I'm not sure Toby Maguire was the right choice to play Pollard.  He wasn't the right size physically, but far more badly he is devoid of the famous demeanor of Red Pollard, who had a perpetually mournful expression on his face, causing many to compare him to Buster Keaton.All in all, the movie ends up being more than the summation of its parts.  The movie does possess a great period feel, and if an enormous amount of the detail about the setting up of the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral was left out, they do a great job of reenacting that race (which according to multiple sources I consulted after reading the book truly is regarded as the greatest horse race of all time).But any reader of the book, to be able to enjoy this movie at all, it going to have to make a pack with oneself to not get hung up on the movies errors.  I was partially able to do this, and was more or less about to enjoy the film.  I do recommend the movie, but I definitely recommend the book considerably more.  The movie is OK, but the book is great.",4,Excellent and reasonably accurate filming of a great book,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,3713,"['greatest', 'problem', 'movie', 'SEABISCUIT', 'book', 'SEABISCUIT', 'given', 'latter', 'enormous', 'success', 'bestseller', 'am', 'rather', 'surprised', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'hew', 'more', 'closely', 'book', 'Granted', 'given', 'need', 'compress', 'much', 'larger', 'content', 'book', 'less', 'information-friendly', 'film', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'compressed', 'What', 'found', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'were', 'couple', 'major', 'plot', 'details', 'did', 'nothing', 'add', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'fact', 'were', 'profoundly', 'untrue', 'first', 'bothered', 'was', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'confessing', 'Smith', 'Howard', 'was', 'blind', 'right', 'eye', 'secret', 'fact', 'kept', 'career', 'jockey', 'Also', 'Pollard', 'suffered', 'twice', 'serious', 'injuries', 'runtime', 'film', 'sort', 'had', 'compress', 'injuries', 'one', 'second', 'one', 'primarily', 'involved', 'shattered', 'leg', 'Again', 'many', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'shatter', 'leg', 'only', 'two', 'weeks', 'match', 'race', 'Pimplico', 'sometimes', 'earlier', 'cutting', 'out', 'Pollard', 'injury', 'are', 'left', 'false', 'impression', 'was', 'match', 'race', 'where', 'Woolf', 'rode', 'Seabiscuit', 'well.See', 'plight', 'person', 'who', 'book', 'shortly', 'seeing', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'Wednesday', 'head', 'Chicago', 'suburbs', 'see', 'movie', 'Friday', 'end', 'up', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'disturbed', 'what', 'leave', 'out', 'am', 'bothered', 'what', 'put', 'alter', 'movie', 'made', 'unfortunate', 'perhaps', 'unavoidable', 'changes', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'much', 'shorter', 'horses', 'raised', 'stockier', 'short', 'legs', 'horses', 'used', 'portray', 'Seabiscuit', 'were', ""n't"", 'especially', 'notable', 'lack', 'size', 'More', 'importantly', 'none', 'horses', 'playing', 'Seabiscuit', 'were', 'able', 'lock', 'legs', 'Seabiscuit', 'was', 'famously', 'unable', 'do', 'meant', 'Seabiscuit', 'unique', 'horses', 'could', 'never', 'sleep', 'standing', 'up', 'only', 'lying', 'down', 'inability', 'lock', 'legs', 'led', 'life-long', 'rumor', 'was', 'either', 'crippled', 'lame', 'mention', 'truly', 'awful', 'legs', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'suspect', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'find', 'horse', 'legs', 'did', ""n't"", 'lock.Overall', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'dramatically', 'underappreciated', 'careers', 'Hollywood', 'superb', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Howard', 'automobile', 'magnate', 'turned', 'horse', 'entrepreneur', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'taking', 'ashen', 'aged', 'appearance', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'different', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'ADAPTATION', 'hard', 'accept', 'same', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'play', 'Pollard', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'size', 'physically', 'far', 'more', 'badly', 'devoid', 'famous', 'demeanor', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'who', 'had', 'perpetually', 'mournful', 'expression', 'face', 'causing', 'many', 'compare', 'Buster', 'Keaton.All', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'summation', 'parts', 'movie', 'possess', 'great', 'period', 'feel', 'enormous', 'amount', 'detail', 'setting', 'up', 'match', 'race', 'Seabiscuit', 'War', 'Admiral', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'reenacting', 'race', 'according', 'multiple', 'sources', 'consulted', 'reading', 'book', 'truly', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'horse', 'race', 'time', 'reader', 'book', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'make', 'pack', 'not', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'movies', 'errors', 'was', 'partially', 'able', 'do', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'book', 'considerably', 'more', 'movie', 'OK', 'book', 'great']",N/A
616500,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JMCN,Robert Morris,"[4, 4]","It would be a disservice to Seabiscuit to damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is among the best of ""feel good films."" In fact, it is. After seeing it again recently, however, I thought less of it than I did when I first saw it. Why? Because (one man's opinion) it manipulates the viewer's emotions rather than allowing the compelling drama of the featured underdogs (owner, jockey, trainer, and horse) to attract, engage, and sustain interest in their collaboration. Most of those who see this film already know that, in 1938, ""the Runt"" defeated War Admiral in their long-delayed confrontation in the Pimlico Special. Therefore, authentic drama develops during the explanation of HOW that was accomplished. Director Gary Ross wrote the screenplay based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling biography. He examines preparations for that great victory (in effect a match race) with meticulous care. Credit John Schwartzman with superb cinematography. As for the acting, it is consistently outstanding, notably the performances by Cooper (Tom Smith), Macy (""Tick Tock"" McGlaughlin), and Stevens (George Woolf). Some have objected to liberties taken with certain facts concerning Seabiscuit and (especially) Red Pollard. I could not care less. This is a well-made, highly entertaining film. I just wish Ross and his associates hadn't tried so hard to conscript my emotional involvement. Given the inherent appeal of this story, I would have been an eager volunteer.The special DVD features include a commentary by Ross and Steven Soderbergh, &quot;Seabiscuit: Racing Through History,&quot; &quot;Bringing the Legend to Life: The Making of Seabiscuit, and &quot;Anatomy of a Movie Moment: From Script to Screen&quot;",4,"Actually, Four and One-Half Stars",1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,1722,"['would', 'be', 'disservice', 'Seabiscuit', 'damn', 'faint', 'praise', 'suggesting', 'best', 'feel', 'good', 'films', 'fact', 'seeing', 'again', 'recently', 'however', 'thought', 'less', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Why', 'one', 'man', 'opinion', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'rather', 'allowing', 'compelling', 'drama', 'featured', 'underdogs', 'owner', 'jockey', 'trainer', 'horse', 'attract', 'engage', 'sustain', 'interest', 'collaboration', 'Most', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'already', 'know', '1938', 'Runt', 'defeated', 'War', 'Admiral', 'long-delayed', 'confrontation', 'Pimlico', 'Special', 'Therefore', 'authentic', 'drama', 'explanation', 'HOW', 'was', 'accomplished', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Laura', 'Hillenbrand', 'best-selling', 'biography', 'preparations', 'great', 'victory', 'effect', 'match', 'race', 'meticulous', 'care', 'Credit', 'John', 'Schwartzman', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'consistently', 'outstanding', 'notably', 'performances', 'Cooper', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Macy', 'Tick', 'Tock', 'McGlaughlin', 'Stevens', 'George', 'Woolf', 'have', 'objected', 'liberties', 'taken', 'certain', 'facts', 'concerning', 'Seabiscuit', 'especially', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'could', 'not', 'care', 'less', 'well-made', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'Ross', 'associates', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'conscript', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'Given', 'inherent', 'appeal', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'eager', 'volunteer.The', 'special', 'DVD', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'Ross', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'quot', 'Seabiscuit', 'Racing', 'History', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bringing', 'Legend', 'Life', 'Making', 'Seabiscuit', 'quot', 'Anatomy', 'Movie', 'Moment', 'Script', 'Screen', 'quot']",N/A

(Billy Crystal's &quot;'61*&quot; being a perfect example, and the recent &quot;Miracle&quot; being the exception.) In fact, that's why there have been so few films that try to tackle a great sporting event. This better-than-average movie, SEABISCUIT, wisely spends sufficent time discussing the American psyche during the Great Depression (and wisely employed the sagacious historian David McCullough to narrate this exposition). Once the scene is set, once we know that the nation is desperate for a rags-to-riches hero, the action of this movie can take place appropriately.As a film, there is a good deal to recommend it. The pacing is swift and sets are very convincing. The cast is for the most part flawless. Tobey Maguire, who gets better with every performance, conveys the pathos of a young man who is forced to be separated from his parent, only to become the wildly erratic jockey and stable-boy, Red Pollard. The always underrated and understated Chris Cooper plays the near-mystical trainer, Tom Smith. Jeff Bridges turns in his standard strong performance as owner Charles Howard. William Macy as fictitious horse racing announcer Tick-Tock provides welcome comic relief. The situations and the interactions among the characters hold this movie together very well.What prevents me from giving this movie a perfect five is director/writer Gary Ross' really over-the-top moments where he couldn't resist some Hollywood stylizations. For example, when Chris Cooper stands in a particularly run-down stable, he sees (a) Seabiscuit being tortured and abused on one side of him and (b) jockey Red Pollard being picked on and harrassed on the other side of him. In case you didn't make the connection, Ross shows Cooper looking again at Seabiscuit and then at Pollard. You can almost see a cartoonish light bulb going on over his head, &quot;Say! Why doesn't this down-on-his-luck, belligerent jockey ride this down-on-his-luck belligerent horse? Duh!&quot; Later, Seabiscuit, who is being ridden by another jockey, pulls up lame during a race, and nearly breaks down. Miles away, kindred spirit Red Pollard inexplicably feels a terrible sharp pain in his shin! Is this the Corsican brothers? Or do I sense Spielberg behind the scenes going, &quot;Hey, remember how Eliot got ill when E.T. got ill? Might work here!&quot; I dunno. These moments happened a little too often.

616504,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMCN,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","Writer/director Gary Ross has made a triumphant film out of Laura Hillenbrand's beloved bestseller.  Like the original author, Ross gathers the strands of his story slowly, showing how the lives of three initially unrelated people - an owner, a trainer and a jockey - converge at a single point, the racehorse phenomenon known as Seabiscuit.Both Hillenbrand and Ross have conceived of Seabiscuit as a metaphor for his time, a beacon of hope and inspiration for a despairing, Depression-ravaged nation.  He is certainly that and more for the three troubled men whose lives he touches, providing each with the opportunity to overcome immense odds, achieve some form of redemption, and put some meaning back into his life.Given its ""inspirational"" subject matter, ""Seabiscuit"" could easily have dissolved into little more than a sappy ""feel-good"" movie.  Luckily for us, the low-keyed approach Ross has taken towards the material purges it of sentimentality.  The movie is upbeat and heartwarming, yet we rarely feel as if the film is pushing our buttons in any obviously manipulative way.

616507,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00005JMCN,Russell Fanelli,"[0, 0]","Seabiscuit surprised me! Typically, Hollywood movies are dumbed down to appeal to a mass audience; that is, too much action and not enough thought. With Seabiscuit we have plenty of action, but it is driven by the carefully thought out story line. We know Seabiscuit will most likely triumph in the end, but enough twists and turns in the plot keep us guessing about the form the final outcome will take.Here are three good reasons to see the film:1. The story: It's all about a horse, small and seemingly unfit to be more than a drudge, who is saved by a trainer who senses the great heart of a champion when he first encounters the animal. We watch the training of Seabiscuit and root for him every step of the way. Even though he upstages the three main actors in this film, they each have their own compelling story. All the plot strands come together in a satisfying conclusion which will please most viewers.2. The Cast: The horses are wonderful to watch. But then we have Seabiscuit's owner, Charles Howard, played capably by the reliable Jeff Bridges. Howard's is a rags to riches story. He is a good guy who lives the American dream and wins in the end. Howard's trainer is played by Chris Cooper, certainly one of the most underrated actors in the movies today. In Seabiscuit Cooper's skill, integrity, and confidence win over man and beast alike. Lastly, Tobey Maguire takes on the role of Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, who has been written off because he is too big to compete in a game where little men dominate the sport. Like Seabiscuit, Pollard is a champion with heart and he and his horse seem made for one another. Maguire seems perfect for his part. In a cameo role, William H. Macy is an eccentric radio announcer who steals the show whenever he is on camera. He is laugh-out-loud funny.3. The Scene: Much of the story takes place at or around the racetrack. We get an insiders view of a world off-limits to most of us. And the action sequences are truly compelling. How did director Ross take us right on to the track and on top of a horse as a race was being filmed? We feel like we are riding right next to Pollard and Seabiscuit as they race for the finish line. Great stuff!The pace of the film has been criticized by some viewers as too slow. I disagree. After all, Seabiscuit is also about the people who love the horse and believe in him and their story is an important part of the final victory against all odds. This victory of man and animal is uplifting and compelling.Seabiscuit is an affirmation of the American Dream.

616510,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JMCN,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 9]","Like ""Radio"" or some other uplifting, compassion-for-the-challenged melodrama, ""Seabiscuit"" is not so much a movie to feel good about horses as it is a movie to feel good about ourselves - the titular thoroughbred doesn't make his entrance in the first hour of Gary Ross's sun-dappled gloss and, afterward, is merely a muse for ego-inflated history lessons.  For lovers of ""Pharlap"" and ""The Black Stallion,"" - or Laura Hillenbrand's book, for that matter - it is a letdown.As in the book, ""Seabiscuit"" opens with a short history of the automobile in early 1920s (nicely narrated by historian David McCullough) that brings us to Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges, doing a hammy riff on his performance in ""Tucker"") an engine pioneer who builds a fortune off the machine -and symbolically uses his horse stable as a garage - before losing his young son (in an auto accident! and only because the six-year-old knew how to drive!) and plunging into a shadowed dispair mirroring the 1929 Wall Street collapse.Parallel stories develop the plights of horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), who stands by a newly built road in the West and knows he's lost the frontier, and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) who fights his oversized frame and rotten luck while partaking in back-barn brawls for room and board money. Howard meets Smith at a campfire. Smith meets Red at a stable.Then, out of the racetrack mist one morning, comes Seabiscuit.There wasn't much to the horse; despite his extrodinary pedigree - he was cousin to future rival War Admiral, and grandson to Man O'War - he was small and lazy, and, by 4 years old, ornery. Yet Seabiscuit had wild, unbridled strength, as if his larger ancestors had packed their spirits into his body, and he won races by stalking down speed horses, then demoraliziong the hard-chargers.Smith saw that quality, and the movie, at times, sees it too. It's just buried under director Ross's need to tell the ""larger"" story of a broken America, match it up to a broken Howard  - who applies his ""finish line is the future"" analogy so many times you yearn for the deep past - then match up Seabiscuit to Red, played unconvicingly by Maguire.Ross triples back to reinforce themes of perseverance, sacrifice and struggle, then measures each of Seabiscuit's races with the same rising orchestral score that booms and cheers at victory. There is extrordinary amount of fat begging to be trimmed. A horrible Elizabeth Banks, as Howard's wife, inhabits the little kid role - she certainly looks like one - existing solely to stand open-mouthed while hitting up Red and Smith for reactions to the horse. And William H. Macy, in a cameo as a radio announcer, takes his cues from Ross and pounds the same gimmick-laden routine into the dry earth. Only Cooper, and jockey Gary Stevens in the movie's best performance as Red's friend/rival George Wolff, seem to be in a Horse Movie; they understand that subtle awe and companionship works better than sales hamming (Bridge) and boyish yelping (Maguire).""Seabiscuit"" does manage to capture some of the excitement of the War Admiral duel, as Howard challenges the Triple Crown winner's legendary owner, Samuel Riddle (Eddie Jones, nicely taciturn), on a whistlestop tour around the country. Howard gets his race, though Red is hurt in an accident and doesn't get the ride. After Seabiscuit wins with a surge in the final turn, he's hurt in a later race, and, wouldn't you know it - horse and Red rehabilitate one another for one last hurrah in the big Handicap.These scenes, and others, would be more powerful were they not chopped into two-minute soundbites, of which the entire movie seems comprised. Ross bleeds Hillenbrand's book dry of the facts while leaving its essence on the page: Every race is more about the jockeys than the horses, every win more about its effect on ""the people"" than the glory of the beast. The War Admiral scene proves it, cutting from the very start of the duel to a still photo of folks listening to the race out of a vehicle. Yes, it's irony, but who cares?

When his son died in a freak car accident, Charles locked up all of his cars, endured a messy divorce, and headed down to Mexico, where he met a young woman who made him start living again.  She convinced him that horses were still needed and loved in society and before Charles knew it, he was in the horse racing business with a small horse that had never won a race before...Seabiscuit.Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) grew up with a natural affinity for horses and a love for the literature that his father taught.  His was a tight-knit, loving family that was torn apart during the Great Depression.  When Red's father discovered that his son could make money with horses, he gave him up to a wealthy man so that he could have a chance at a decent life.  Red never saw his family again.  As he grew older, Red struggled to keep his weight down so that he could jockey, but after a series of failures, he got involved in boxing and drinking, leaving him down on his luck and penniless in Mexico, where a friend introduced him to Charles...Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a master horseman who excelled at training any and every horse that ever crossed his path, but his ways of horse training were viewed as obsolete and too time consuming.  He was homeless, living off the land in Mexico, when someone recommended him to Charles and Charles hired him.  Now all of the major players were in place and they were trying to do the impossible - get a horse that was too small, who had been bred for defeat, who was ridden by a jockey that was too big who couldn't see to beat one of the most famous racehorses of all time...I thoroughly enjoyed this film and felt that it was very inspirational.  It is true that the director stayed a little too focused on portraying the story in the way that Hilldebrand's book told it, but it was very well done nonetheless.  The pacing is a little bit off as the director takes the time to fill in background information about the Great Depression and each of the major characters, but that also made every victory all the more poignant and meaningful (it is also a very tricky way of getting people who claim that they hate history to learn something while watching a movie!).  The cinematography was gorgeous, the score was lush and beautiful, the characters were very ably cast and the story is extremely inspiring.  If you are looking for a lovely drama that has a good moral and is well made, look no further than Seabiscuit.",4,A Wonderful 'Feel Good' Movie,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,2942,"['Charles', 'Howard', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'had', 'plan', 'success', 'open', 'bicycle', 'shop', 'nice', 'town', 'watch', 'money', 'come', 'rolling', 'Unfortunately', 'Charles', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'selling', 'bikes', 'found', 'had', 'gift', 'selling', 'new', 'automobiles', 'long', 'was', 'very', 'wealthy', 'man', 'even', 'stock', 'market', 'crashed', 'plunging', 'most', 'people', 'poverty', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Charles', 'kept', 'selling', 'cars', 'doting', 'only', 'child', 'son', 'was', 'whole', 'world', 'When', 'son', 'died', 'freak', 'car', 'accident', 'Charles', 'locked', 'up', 'cars', 'endured', 'messy', 'divorce', 'headed', 'down', 'Mexico', 'where', 'met', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'start', 'living', 'again', 'convinced', 'horses', 'were', 'still', 'needed', 'loved', 'society', 'Charles', 'knew', 'was', 'horse', 'racing', 'business', 'small', 'horse', 'had', 'never', 'won', 'race', 'Seabiscuit.Red', 'Pollard', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'grew', 'up', 'natural', 'affinity', 'horses', 'love', 'literature', 'father', 'taught', 'was', 'tight-knit', 'loving', 'family', 'was', 'torn', 'apart', 'Great', 'Depression', 'When', 'Red', 'father', 'discovered', 'son', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'horses', 'gave', 'up', 'wealthy', 'man', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'chance', 'decent', 'life', 'Red', 'never', 'saw', 'family', 'again', 'grew', 'older', 'Red', 'struggled', 'keep', 'weight', 'down', 'so', 'could', 'jockey', 'series', 'failures', 'got', 'involved', 'boxing', 'drinking', 'leaving', 'down', 'luck', 'penniless', 'Mexico', 'where', 'friend', 'introduced', 'Charles', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'was', 'master', 'horseman', 'who', 'excelled', 'training', 'horse', 'ever', 'crossed', 'path', 'ways', 'horse', 'training', 'were', 'viewed', 'obsolete', 'too', 'time', 'consuming', 'was', 'homeless', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'Mexico', 'when', 'someone', 'recommended', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'hired', 'Now', 'major', 'players', 'were', 'place', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'impossible', 'get', 'horse', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'bred', 'defeat', 'who', 'was', 'ridden', 'jockey', 'was', 'too', 'big', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'beat', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'racehorses', 'time', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'inspirational', 'true', 'director', 'stayed', 'little', 'too', 'focused', 'portraying', 'story', 'way', 'Hilldebrand', 'book', 'told', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'nonetheless', 'pacing', 'little', 'bit', 'director', 'time', 'fill', 'background', 'information', 'Great', 'Depression', 'major', 'characters', 'also', 'made', 'victory', 'more', 'poignant', 'meaningful', 'also', 'very', 'tricky', 'way', 'getting', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'hate', 'history', 'learn', 'something', 'watching', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'score', 'was', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'ably', 'cast', 'story', 'extremely', 'inspiring', 'are', 'looking', 'lovely', 'drama', 'good', 'moral', 'well', 'made', 'look', 'further', 'Seabiscuit']",N/A

616519,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005JMCN,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","The story begins by showing the American dream. Henry Ford is building cars and inventing the assembly line. It appears that prosperity is something everyone can achieve and optimism is high. Then, the depression hits. Where people once owned cars for pleasure and convenience, for some, their car may be their only remaining possession.Charles Howard (Bridges) is a man who started with 21 cents in his pocket and turned it into what most would consider a successful business. He owns a big house and his wife and son seem to be happy. That changes in an instant the day his young son decides to take the car for a spin and ends up being killed in the resulting crash. Howard's wife leaves and he's left behind to rebuild his life.This is the story of unlikely success and second chances. Howard finds new love when he encounters Marcela (Elizabeth Banks) and eventually remarries. He also decides to invest in a horse. His trainer is Tom Smith (Cooper), who has been written off as crazy by most people. His jockey is Red Pollard (Maguire), who has a temper, a history of losing, and has never been considered good at what he does. Howard spends $2,000 on Seabiscuit. The horse has good breeding, but is undersized, apparently lazy, and not likely to become a winner.Each of these damaged characters gets a second chance in life. We see Smith training Seabiscuit. The horse is unruly and will only let Pollard ride him. Howard knows nothing about racing, but he's a loyal owner and believes in his team of misfits.As you can see, there's nothing remarkable about the story so far. But something makes us root for Seabiscuit. The race sequences place the viewer right among the action. It looks and sounds so real that you'll feel as if you are riding one of the horses.The live action is broken up occasionally with black and white photographs depicting people who grew up in this era. It made me think of people no longer with us. They all had lives, hopes and dreams. You can see some of that optimism in their smiles.The film is good at a making you reflect on the past. One major story thread involves Howard's attempts to set up a match race with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. People desperately want to see the two meet, but War Admiral's owner is against the idea and doesn't consider the challenge worthy.The film leaves out a lot of historical details and focuses on a few races rather than Seabiscuit's entire career. As a result, some of the events did not occur exactly as suggested. But it doesn't ruin the story if you watch it without knowing the full history.I won't reveal any more of the plot. The acting is very good, as you would expect from actors of this quality. Bridges and Cooper are particularly effective. If you avoid films about animals because you don't like to see them get hurt, no horses die at any point. Two suffer injuries, but it's essential to the plot and ends happily.Seabiscuit captured the nation's imagination in the 1930s and represented hope when people needed it most. The story is inspirational and is one of the best sports films I've seen. Any Oscar hopes were crushed by Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but it was nominated in seven categories.",5,Great movie and an incredible Blu-ray presentation,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,3210,"['story', 'showing', 'American', 'dream', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'building', 'cars', 'inventing', 'assembly', 'line', 'prosperity', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'achieve', 'optimism', 'high', 'Then', 'depression', 'Where', 'people', 'once', 'owned', 'cars', 'pleasure', 'convenience', 'car', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'remaining', 'possession.Charles', 'Howard', 'Bridges', 'man', 'who', 'started', '21', 'cents', 'pocket', 'turned', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'successful', 'business', 'big', 'house', 'wife', 'son', 'seem', 'be', 'happy', 'instant', 'day', 'young', 'son', 'take', 'car', 'spin', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'resulting', 'crash', 'Howard', 'wife', 'leaves', 'left', 'rebuild', 'life.This', 'story', 'unlikely', 'success', 'second', 'chances', 'Howard', 'new', 'love', 'when', 'Marcela', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'eventually', 'remarries', 'also', 'invest', 'horse', 'trainer', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Cooper', 'who', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'crazy', 'most', 'people', 'jockey', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'Maguire', 'who', 'temper', 'history', 'losing', 'never', 'been', 'considered', 'good', 'what', 'Howard', '2,000', 'Seabiscuit', 'horse', 'good', 'breeding', 'undersized', 'apparently', 'lazy', 'not', 'likely', 'become', 'winner.Each', 'damaged', 'characters', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'see', 'Smith', 'training', 'Seabiscuit', 'horse', 'unruly', 'will', 'only', 'let', 'Pollard', 'ride', 'Howard', 'nothing', 'racing', 'loyal', 'owner', 'team', 'misfits.As', 'can', 'see', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'story', 'so', 'far', 'something', 'root', 'Seabiscuit', 'race', 'place', 'viewer', 'right', 'action', 'so', 'real', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'are', 'riding', 'one', 'horses.The', 'live', 'action', 'broken', 'up', 'occasionally', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'depicting', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'era', 'made', 'think', 'people', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'lives', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'can', 'see', 'optimism', 'smiles.The', 'film', 'good', 'making', 'reflect', 'past', 'One', 'major', 'story', 'thread', 'Howard', 'attempts', 'set', 'up', 'match', 'race', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'winner', 'War', 'Admiral', 'People', 'desperately', 'want', 'see', 'two', 'meet', 'War', 'Admiral', 'owner', 'idea', ""n't"", 'consider', 'challenge', 'worthy.The', 'film', 'out', 'lot', 'historical', 'details', 'focuses', 'few', 'races', 'rather', 'Seabiscuit', 'entire', 'career', 'result', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'exactly', 'suggested', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'watch', 'knowing', 'full', 'history.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'actors', 'quality', 'Bridges', 'Cooper', 'are', 'particularly', 'effective', 'avoid', 'films', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'get', 'hurt', 'horses', 'die', 'point', 'Two', 'suffer', 'injuries', 'essential', 'plot', 'happily.Seabiscuit', 'captured', 'nation', 'imagination', '1930s', 'represented', 'hope', 'when', 'people', 'needed', 'most', 'story', 'inspirational', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Oscar', 'hopes', 'were', 'crushed', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'categories']",N/A

An all-star cast, a feelgood story, and solid writing and directing make these films shoo-ins based on the hype alone, but more often than not, they fail miserably.This is where &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; differs from other Oscar vehicles like &quot;Men of Honor&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;.

But like in &quot;Rocky&quot;, this story works, and I'll be damned if I didn't end up cheering for that little horse by the end of the movie. The best parts of this film are the stock footage of the depression era woven in with the actual film, highlighting the importance of the horse in such downtrodden times. The reaction of the people to this racehorse was nothing short of amazing, and this is where the movie manages to get its true heart.The performances are solid, but unspectacular.

616534,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMCN,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","There are two things that I can recommend about &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;: superb acting from the stars including Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and William H Macy -- and the realistic horse race scenes.  The story is too long (one too many episode), the development is too conventional, but the film has managed to give us the message about life -- you have a second chance of life.  For that only, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; deserves viewing.The story is based on the book by Laura Hillenbrand, who unearthed a once forgotten horse &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; whose legend gave the hope to live in the Depression era in America.  The horse was not big; it did not belong to the prestigious family line of any famouse horses; and it won the big game against the odds.  How could people, living in the hard times, miss the heroic figure?And also enters the jokey with no name, Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Pollard (Maguire), who lost sight in one eye, and struggling in the local race where no rule is the rule (see the incredible &quot;race&quot; in which you can do anything).  But when &quot;Red&quot; was found by a kind-hearted employer Charles Howard (Bridges), and the veteran trainer Tom Smith (Cooper) joins the team, everything is in a fit place to make an American legend.  Yes, this is a story that could happen only in America, and I mean that is a great thing.The actors are, as I said, all great.  Tobey Maguire is in a fit form to play the jockey, who must have underwent a hard training.  Underrated Jeff Bridges never pushes himself forward (that's why his four-time Oscar nonimations, and no win), but in this case, appropriately so, for he plays the ever-understanding psuedo-father figure to the boy, reckless &quot;Red.&quot;  And you get Chris Cooper, cameleon actor of new generation, whose presence as the tough-and-rough veteran should be praised for giving the touch of humainity to the story.The direction by Gary Ross is far from natural. I am afraid.  The film goes more than 140 minutes (which is too long), and his way of handling of some scenes should be called 'tampering' instead of editing (I remember he was behind the camera in &quot;Pleasantville&quot; which was too artificial to me).  Still,  you will get the energy and good, old, straightforwardness when William H Macy appears as radio announcer.  His racy turn here is just a joy to see.All in all, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a successful film, especially when we know it is based on the truth -- the truth upgraded by excellent acting of the talented actors, and the great production designs re-producing America in the 1930s.  And do not miss the hair-raising horse race scenes, which enables you to share the viewpoints of the jockeys.

In a season full of big-budget duds, Seabiscuit was able to live up to its own theme and become the dark horse high-grossing film among those all-too-often dumbed down three months of cinema.I think most know the story.  But for those who don't, it is about a ""horse that's too small, a jockey that's too big and and trainer that's too old,"" as Jeff Bridges stated within the film.  It is not only about the horse himself and how it prevails, winning race after race.  It also concerns the three men (played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey McGuire) whose lives are changed by the tiny little animal that seems relentless in its victory.This story may sound very inspiring, and that it is.  But what I found depressing is that the original story of Seabiscuit contained many more hardships and tough times than Gary Ross' period piece actually portrayed.  It is as if DreamWorks was afraid that the dark subject matter would hinder sales.  I tell you one thing, when movie companies think too much about the audience (whose standards aren't that high considering most think of cinema as a means of entertainment rather than art) it angers me, because loss of artistic integrity become inevitable.Luckily, most of the film was well-performed, namely by Jeff Bridges, who remains one of our nation's best actors.  It was unfortunate that the wonderful Chris Cooper was given an interesting role without much to do or express.  I wish more depth had been written into his characacter.Although this is my second review of this particular film and I said it did improve with additional viewing (I stand by that statement), I gave it three stars rather than my previous four because there was nothing ground-breaking about Seabiscuit.  I began to realize how common it was thanks to the lack of realistic portrayals of the three men's lives, particularly Red's (Tobey McGuire).  I don't expect many to take the film as seriously as I do, so I reassure you that Seabiscuit is a film most will enjoy and be moved by to full extent.",5,This improved with an additional viewing.

616536,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JMCN,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 3]","Gary Ross' film version of Lauren Hillenbrand's marvelous book performed like Seabiscuit when it was released. The film didn't open as strongly as The Hulk or many of the other new releases, but around the second stretch it took the lead and kept performing. While Ross' film relies a bit too much on a series of short documentary-like narrative links to describe the time and circumstances of Seabiscuit's rise, the film performs strongly due to its solid, well written script and a seasoned cast. The film would have been stronger if Ross had used his characters to drive home the dire situation facing the people of the United States during the great depression. At times it felt a bit like Ross was forcefeeding the facts to the audience for those without any concept of history. This approach was a bit distracting and does have the effect of pulling viewers out of the film from time to time.Although I had seen Tobey Maguire in a number of films prior to Seabiscuit, nothing prepared me for the soul weary performance he gives as Red Pollard. He captures perfectly the feelings of abandonment and anger that drove him to succeed despite considerable odds. Likewise, Chris Cooper as Tom Smith manages to channel the very essence of this unique, talented horse whisperer who saw great potential in both Red and Seabiscuit. Jeff Bridges vividly inhabits the role of automobile mogul Charles Howard. In many respects, Bridges plays Howard as a variation on Tucker from the film of the same name. Both men seemed to see the future, embrace it with their boundless optimism  only to trip over a tragic obstacle on the path they chose. Howard lost his son and, in many respects, his sense of place in the world the way Bridges portrays him in the film. Seabiscuit really is a film about second chances and for all three men and the horse that brought them together, that second chance gave them life again.The other performances include a stand out supporting turn by William H. Macy and Elizabeth Banks. Even the minor supporting roles are well cast and played giving a authentic feel to the film.The beautiful production design and vivid photography are both well served by this immaculate DVD transfer. It's not without some minor imperfections in the transfer but, on the whole, many of the beautifully shot scenes here could be used as a comparison standard for different DVD players and televisions. THe sound is stunning. Randy Newman's rich score captures the very elements of the time and spins them into a rich, dramatic musical tapestry that perfectly compliments the film.Minor narrative flaws aside, Seabiscuit delivers proving that there are third acts to American lives in the real world. All it took was faith, belief and a unique group of individuals to see the potential in Seabiscuit.

Some of the cutscenes seem to have no relation to the movie whatsoever, though, and could distract people from the actual storyline.However, everything began to pick up when the three different characters' storylines that we follow became more and more tragic until they are united by the fourth character, Seabiscuit - the small and nearly broken down horse with a sad early life. The thing that bothered me about the sudden addition of Seabiscuit was that the movie explained his life in a few short minutes, instead of having it be a continual storyline from the beginning of the movie, like the automotive salesperson, the horse trainer, and the jockey.The storyline continues with more challenges and more tragedy for all the characters, that I was left cheering for all of them to succeed in their fight against their misfortune. This movie develops all of the main characters very well so it was easy to sympathize with them.Also, the races were more exciting than I anticipated, leaving me and my fellow viewer at the edge of our seats, cheering Seabiscuit on. This movie also left a nice message about how it's not all about the race and winning, but how the characters were all brought together and changed their life around - for the better.This movie delivers its more than two-hour performance very well and wraps up everything nicely.

616539,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JMCN,William Hare,"[4, 5]","Gary Ross has adapted, as director and screenwriter, Laura Hillenbrand's runaway best seller ""Seabiscuit"" into a film that tugs earnestly at the heart, providing inspiration and a message of trial over adversity at a time when Hollywood is doing all too few movies in this inspiring genre.  This is a film about a racehorse that the higher cognoscenti has given up on that ultimately achieves championship status in Depression America of the 1937-1940 period.Jeff Bridges stars as a man who has made a fortune as an automobile dealer.  He owns a huge ranch outside San Francisco and appears to have everything going his way until the young son he deeply loves dies in an automobile accident.  His marriage ends and he seeks to rebound amid high living in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, becoming attracted to horse racing as he attends events at Agua Caliente Racetrack.  One night he spots a man living in the brush whose only companion is his horse.  Whle others refer to the man as a ""nut,"" man of imagination Bridges becomes intrigued and gets acquainted with him.At a time when he needs inspiration, Bridges finds a wife and a new compatriot in Chris Cooper, the loner who supplies him with inspiration to get into the field of horse racing.  They acquire a thoroughbred at Saratoga Racetrack in New York, a knobby-kneed, underachieving Seabiscuit,picking him up at a bargain basement price.  The wily Cooper, who is actually crazy like a fox, is convinced by the determined look in the horse's eyes that he holds the kind of great potential originally anticipated due to his impressive lineage.When the group returns to California, locating a jockey at Saratoga who is every bit as much of a loner and offbeat personality type as Cooper, played by Tobey Maguire, the horse is slowly nursed along.  He begins making his mark at Santa Anita Racetrack in the Los Angeles suburb of Arcadia.  Whereas Cooper supplies a calming influence on the highly strung horse, which is thought to be too small to be a successful thoroughbred, red-haired Maguire, who at 5-7 is considered too tall to be a first class jockey, provides the proper balance of tender loving care and competitive fire to spur on the highly strung horse to victory.Narration by Pulitzer Prize historian David McCullough combined with black and white footage from the Depression era, including a smiling Franklin Delano Roosevelt, places viewers in the appropriate mood setting to empathize with this brilliantly crafted cinema work.  Randy Newman's excellent musical score also assists in that direction.  Depression America needs an underdog hero and this undersized and initially unappreciated horse supplies that need.  Infields of racetracks fill up with poor people rooting on Seabiscuit while the rich watch in awe from their clubhouse boxes as ""America's horse"" surges to triumph after triumph.A dramatic high point of the film is the effort on Bridges's part to obtain a match race with the theretofore highest regarded thoroughbred in the country, Eastern bred War Admiral, a triple crown winner.  The race takes on a David vs. Goliath element with triple crown winner War Admiral towering over the 2-1 underdog from California.  The long anticipated East vs. West showdown takes place at Pimlico Racetrack in Baltimore, but before Seabiscuit gets his date with immortality the race is almost called off when Maguire sustains an injury exercising another horse, after which his old rival and eventual friend extending back to his Caliente days, played by Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, fills in for the high-spirited redhead in the biggest match race in history.  Seabiscuit has not come this far and overcome this many hurdles to disappoint.William H.

616542,A2XYGJ7FAK0QR7,B00005JMCN,"Zossima ""Zossima""","[5, 7]","Thelonious Monk was a genius at what some call the &quot;implied note&quot;.  He left notes out of the music, but the listener's ears and mind filled them in.  It is part of what made him a jazz titan.  &quot;Missing notes&quot; are used brilliantly and to great effect in this movie.  We don't have to see Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) and his wife becoming distant or fighting after their son dies to know why she leaves him.  The way the director sets it all up, we know their pain without even seeing the struggle.  Similarly, we don't have to see the years go by from the time 16 year-old Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) was left by his once wealthy family to do menial labor for a horse rancher to know how that turned him into an angry man.  Just knowing it happened is enough.  This is brilliant directing, for putting those kinds of intermediary scenes in the movie would have been clich&eacute;'d.  It would have been just using valuable screen time to tell us what we already know.  Instead, the pain is implied, and we each experience it in our own way.That's just one of the brilliant aspects of this MUST-SEE FILM.THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER `ROCKY' MOVIE.  IT IS A STORY OF HOW HURTING PEOPLE (AND A HURTING HORSE) CAN HELP EACH OTHER TO OVERCOME THEIR HURTS.  Charles, Red, and the trainer, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), each help the down-and-out horse, Seabiscuit, to learn, once again, how to be a horse-to learn what was literally beat out of him by other cruel owners. Seabiscuit, as an animal, and as a failure as a race-horse, can't disappoint them the way that others in life have.  That's often the case with animals, which is why we love them so.  Seabiscuit repays the favor in spades, helping each one of them to overcome the hurts of their pasts and by helping a nation to forget the pain of the Great Depression.PROS* Narrator (David McCullough, from Ken Burns' documentaries) used effectively to provide the context for the challenging times of the Depression out of which Seabiscuit triumphed-may we never forget what a horrible time it was* Good acting all around, particularly Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper* Gorgeous scenery and cinematography: How did they get those incredible race shots?* This really happened! It is fascinating to know that the country was once riveted by the rivalry between Seabiscuit and the triple-crown winner War Admiral.  Great history!CONSHonestly, I can't think of any.  Some reviewers criticize that it takes 45 minutes before we meet Seabiscuit.  But that's crucial setup time for the characters.  That time was well-spent and certainly was used efficiently, as I noted above in my comparisons to Thelonious Monk.PURCHASING RECOMMENDATIONGet it.  You'll watch it many times.  There are some fight scenes early in the movie that may not be suitable for young children.  But other than that, this is a wonderful family film.",4,Inspiring TRUE story of horse that inspired a nation,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,2878,"['Thelonious', 'Monk', 'was', 'genius', 'what', 'call', 'quot', 'implied', 'note', 'quot', 'left', 'music', 'listener', 'ears', 'mind', 'filled', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'jazz', 'titan', 'quot', 'Missing', 'notes', 'quot', 'are', 'used', 'brilliantly', 'great', 'effect', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'Charles', 'Howard', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'wife', 'becoming', 'distant', 'fighting', 'son', 'know', 'why', 'way', 'director', 'up', 'know', 'pain', 'even', 'seeing', 'struggle', 'Similarly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'years', 'go', 'time', '16', 'year-old', 'Red', 'Pollard', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'was', 'left', 'once', 'wealthy', 'family', 'do', 'menial', 'labor', 'horse', 'rancher', 'know', 'how', 'turned', 'angry', 'man', 'Just', 'knowing', 'happened', 'enough', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'putting', 'kinds', 'intermediary', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'d"", 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'using', 'valuable', 'screen', 'time', 'tell', 'already', 'know', 'Instead', 'pain', 'implied', 'experience', 'own', 'way.That', 'just', 'one', 'brilliant', 'aspects', 'MUST-SEE', 'FILM.THIS', 'IS', 'NOT', 'JUST', 'ANOTHER', 'ROCKY', 'MOVIE', 'IT', 'A', 'STORY', 'OF', 'HOW', 'HURTING', 'PEOPLE', 'HURTING', 'HORSE', 'CAN', 'HELP', 'EACH', 'OTHER', 'TO', 'OVERCOME', 'THEIR', 'HURTS', 'Charles', 'Red', 'trainer', 'Tom', 'Smith', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'help', 'down-and-out', 'horse', 'Seabiscuit', 'learn', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'be', 'horse-to', 'learn', 'what', 'was', 'literally', 'beat', 'other', 'cruel', 'owners', 'Seabiscuit', 'animal', 'failure', 'race-horse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'way', 'others', 'life', 'have', 'often', 'case', 'animals', 'why', 'love', 'so', 'Seabiscuit', 'favor', 'spades', 'helping', 'one', 'overcome', 'hurts', 'pasts', 'helping', 'nation', 'forget', 'pain', 'Great', 'Depression.PROS*', 'Narrator', 'David', 'McCullough', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'used', 'effectively', 'provide', 'context', 'challenging', 'times', 'Depression', 'Seabiscuit', 'triumphed-may', 'never', 'forget', 'what', 'horrible', 'time', 'was*', 'Good', 'acting', 'around', 'particularly', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Chris', 'Cooper*', 'Gorgeous', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'incredible', 'race', 'shots', '*', 'really', 'happened', 'fascinating', 'know', 'country', 'was', 'once', 'riveted', 'rivalry', 'Seabiscuit', 'triple-crown', 'winner', 'War', 'Admiral', 'Great', 'history', 'CONSHonestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'reviewers', 'criticize', '45', 'minutes', 'meet', 'Seabiscuit', 'crucial', 'setup', 'time', 'characters', 'time', 'was', 'well-spent', 'certainly', 'was', 'used', 'efficiently', 'noted', 'comparisons', 'Thelonious', 'Monk.PURCHASING', 'RECOMMENDATIONGet', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'early', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'other', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film']",N/A
