She is so funny and much more dumber. This is her last main season. Larry becomes a main charterer and this season also introduces two new charterers Lana who did not stay very long and the new landlord Mr. Furley. Jack Graduates from cooking school and we see his brother Lee. Other things include Chrissy and Jack getting handcuffed together, Jack dressing up as a woman, Larry loving Janet, the gang going camping and much more. The bonus features are also good. You can 25 episodes on 4 discs and over 10 hours of laughs. I hope you enjoy it.I just want to point out that this is my 3rd year of writing reviews on Amazon.

892419,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007WFXL2,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 4]","Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977, Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Jack on the Lam"" in which the FBI, in the process of doing a background check on one of Jack's old navy buddies, interviews Jack. Jack mistakes the interview for a government conspiracy to get him. Meanwhile, Mr. Furley has yet to appear even though Don Knotts is credited in the opening scenes... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The New Landlord"" in which Larry, Jack, Janet, and Chrissy meet their new landlord, Mr. Furley, (after selling off his furniture, having believed the Ropers left it behind for the trash man), and ""A Camping We Will Go"" in which Larry tells his actress girlfriend that Jack is a famous commercial producer...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 4) DVD:Episode 54 (Jack on the Lam)Episode 55 (Love Thy Neighbor)Episode 56 (The New Landlord)Episode 57 (Snow Job)Episode 58 (Jack the Ripper)Episode 59 (The Life Saver)Episode 60 (Old Folks at Home)Episode 61 (A Camping We Will Go)Episode 62 (Chrissy's Hospitality)Episode 63 (The Loan Shark)Episode 64 (The Love Barge)Episode 65 (Ralph's Rival)Episode 66 (Black Letter Day)Episode 67 (The Reverend Steps Out)Episode 68 (Larry Loves Janet)Episode 69 (Mighty Mouth)Episode 70 (The Love Lesson)Episode 71 (Handcuffed)Episode 72 (And Baby Makes Two)Episode 73 (Jack's Bad Boy)Episode 74 (Lee Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother)Episode 75 (The Root of All Evil)Episode 76 (Secret Admirer)Episode 77 (The Goodbye Guy)Episode 78 (Jack's Graduation)The DVD Report",5,Come and knock on their door...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3310,"['Bursting', 'television', 'landscape', 'Spring', '1977', 'Three', 'Company', 'quickly', 'skyrocketed', 'ratings', 'cracking', 'top', '8', 'season', 'last', 'Sporting', 'plethora', 'quirky', 'characters', 'fresh', 'writing', 'talent', 'explored', 'modern', 'day', 'issues', 'show', 'held', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'programs', 'TV', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'Family', 'left', 'off', 'Three', 'Company', 'delved', 'social', 'taboos', 'day', 'dealing', 'subjects', 'such', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'course', 'unmarried', 'men', 'women', 'living', 'together', 'true', 'success', 'Three', 'Company', 'stemmed', 'comic', 'talents', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'who', 'became', 'instant', 'stars', 'result', 'respective', 'roles', 'show', 'Three', 'Company', 'John', 'Ritter', 'role', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'young', 'cooking', 'student', 'San', 'Diego', 'who', 'move', 'apartment', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'blonde', 'ditsy', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'three', 'friends', 'face', 'possible', 'wrath', 'landlord', 'Stanley', 'Roper', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'old-fashioned', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'arrangement', 'aid', 'Roper', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'three', 'manage', 'convince', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'gay', 'when', 'fact', 'notorious', 'ladies', 'man', 'Jack', 'friend', 'Larry', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'also', 'player', 'local', 'singles', 'scene', 'regular', 'appearances', 'show', 'Following', 'Season', '3', 'Stanley', 'Helen', 'left', 'show', 'pursuit', 'own', 'spin-off', 'titled', 'Ropers', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'fame', 'was', 'brought', 'play', 'new', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'nave', 'loud-mouthed', 'ditz', 'who', 'tripled', 'hilarity', 'scene', 'appeared', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Jack', 'Lam', 'FBI', 'process', 'doing', 'background', 'check', 'one', 'Jack', 'old', 'navy', 'buddies', 'interviews', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'interview', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'get', 'Meanwhile', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'yet', 'appear', 'even', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'credited', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'New', 'Landlord', 'Larry', 'Jack', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'meet', 'new', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'selling', 'off', 'furniture', 'having', 'believed', 'Ropers', 'left', 'trash', 'man', 'A', 'Camping', 'Will', 'Go', 'Larry', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'Jack', 'famous', 'commercial', 'producer', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '54', 'Jack', 'Lam', 'Episode', '55', 'Love', 'Thy', 'Neighbor', 'Episode', '56', 'New', 'Landlord', 'Episode', '57', 'Snow', 'Job', 'Episode', '58', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Episode', '59', 'Life', 'Saver', 'Episode', '60', 'Old', 'Folks', 'Home', 'Episode', '61', 'Camping', 'Will', 'Go', 'Episode', '62', 'Chrissy', 'Hospitality', 'Episode', '63', 'Loan', 'Shark', 'Episode', '64', 'Love', 'Barge', 'Episode', '65', 'Ralph', 'Rival', 'Episode', '66', 'Black', 'Letter', 'Day', 'Episode', '67', 'Reverend', 'Steps', 'Out', 'Episode', '68', 'Larry', 'Loves', 'Janet', 'Episode', '69', 'Mighty', 'Mouth', 'Episode', '70', 'Love', 'Lesson', 'Episode', '71', 'Handcuffed', 'Episode', '72', 'Baby', 'Makes', 'Two', 'Episode', '73', 'Jack', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Episode', '74', 'Lee', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Heavy', 'My', 'Brother', 'Episode', '75', 'Root', 'All', 'Evil', 'Episode', '76', 'Secret', 'Admirer', 'Episode', '77', 'Goodbye', 'Guy', 'Episode', '78', 'Jack', 'Graduation', 'DVD', 'Report']",Three's Company: Season 4

Introducing the desperate, but not shy, girl next door Lana; And the ""oh so desirable ladies man"" Ralph Furley are introduced in this season. We fortunately get to keep one of these great talents for the rest of Three's Company's seasons, but unfortunately the spunky Lana only is part of The Three's Company Ensemble for half a season.Mr. Furley is introduced to us in this season due to The Ropers apartment building being bought by Ralph Furley's brother, Bart. Bart hires Ralph to be as active Land Lord of the building, as for he has more things within his company to keep his undivided attention on. (In Real life The members who played the Ropers left due to their spin-off called ""The Ropers"". The Show did extremely well its first season, then when moved onto its second the time slot of the show was moved, causing ratings to drastically lower; and the show to be cancelled. If the spin-off didn't run for a full season, The Ropers would have come back to Three's Company)All I can say is that this season contains some of the greatest episodes in Three's Company physical comedy display. How can we forget the episode where the cast goes camping up in Big Bear for the weekend in Larry's boss's cabin; We get the famous scene of Jack struggling with The Tree Sack. Or we can't forget the other great episode of Chrissy's Hospitality; In this episode we have the famous scene when Jack and Chrissy are putting up a shower curtain.

This show holds a special place in my heart because it made me laugh for years. I am grateful that this classic sitcom has finally been released on DVD for us to enjoy time and time again.""Three's Company"" evolved and became funnier with each passing year and Season 4 was ""Three's Company"" at its best. After the much loved Roper's moved out in Season 3, Mr. Ralph Furley (Don Knotts) moved in. With his unconventional features, polyester suits, silk scarves and outrageous behavior, he was a comedic force to be reckoned with and coupled with the creative genius of John Ritter's Jack Tripper, they made an unbeatable duo.Another talented member of the cast who hardly ever gets the praise she deserves is Joyce Dewitt. Admittedly, the character of Janet Wood is not as colorful as the others but Dewitt, when given the opportunity, was an amusing comedienne. In Season 4, her character went through a dramatic physical transformation. In previous seasons, she was a cute brunette who always took a back seat to Suzanne Somer's glittering sexuality. Here Dewitt's raven-haired beauty is finally unmasked. Gone is the hair in layered curls and frumpy outfits. Janet Wood in Season 4 is slick and sexy in her short haircut, form-fitting jeans, high-heeled shows and ruby red lipstick. She's also given some of her best material this season.The controversial Suzanne Somers is also a feast for the eyes and the funny bone. Chrissy Snow in the first season wasn't a total airhead. She was raw, inexperienced but not really a ""ditz"". Somehow as the show progressed, the character became funnier, more likable, more brainless. I have no complaints because Chrissy Snow is hilarious and she's at her zenith in Season 4. I have seen Suzanne Somers' other shows throughout the years and she was never as comical as she was in ""Three's Company"". This was the only sitcom that was able to showcase her true comedic talents.Another standout this season is Anne Wedgeworth who plays the overtly-sexual temptress Lana Sheilds. It is a shame her character was cut before the end of the season but Ms. Wedgeworth steals every scene she's in. Her mannerisms, facial expressions and witty one-liners (""Tarzan, can I swing in your tree"") are memorable and highly amusing. John Ritter stated in an interview that the reason ""Lana"" got the axe was because the character didn't ""fit"" in the context of the show. He described Jack Tripper as a sexually charged individual. It didn't make sense that Tripper would be constantly rejecting the physical advances of this older but ""gorgeous woman"".Speaking of the late, great John Ritter, he was the glue holding all of this together. Jack Tripper remains and will remain iconic thanks to the charm and considerable talents of the man portraying him. You can tell from watching Ritter perform that he enjoyed making people laugh even if it meant hurting himself in the process and for this I thank him. The man was a genius.Some of my personal favorite episodes featured here are:""Jack On the Lam"" where Jack disguises himself as a woman to hide from the FBI.""A Camping We Will Go"" which features hilarious performances from Ritter, Wedgeworth and Somers.""Black Letter Day"" has the girls at each other's throats due to a simple misunderstanding and Jack, as usual, is the unfortunate victim.""Larry Loves Janet"" showcases Dewitts' considerable charm and comedic talents.""Mighty Mouth"" features a hilarious performance from Ritter after a hard workout at the gym.""Handcuffed"" features Jack and Chrissy at their funniest when a harmless prank goes horribly wrong. The ""cake eating"" scene is a classic.""The Root Of All Evil"" has Chrissy winning big at the race track but winning loads of money fast has it's comical consequences. At least for these 3 room-mates.These are just a few highlights. Even my least favorite episodes have more than enough laughs to keep you entertained.With the original characters now fully evolved and with the introduction of Mr. Furley and Lana, ""Three's Company- Season 4"" is a must for fans of great comedy. There's a reason this show and these characters are so beloved. This is classic TV at its absolute, stomach-hurting best.Highly Recommended.",5,Outrageously Funny.

I love this show. I noticed some differences about the new season though, in spite of the fact that the new landlord hasn't come in yet. One is Jack's attitude to Chrissy. He seems a just a tiny bit agro to her, making fun of her laugh, and seeming to be annoyed or angry with her. It doesn't put too much a dent in the fun though. I can't remember laughing so hard at a Three's Company. It's the one where he dresses up like a girl to escape the FBI. Janet is a real peace-maker, and Chrissy IS funny regardless of Jack's annoyance with her (she's so funny her ditzyness is almost genius) his annoyance doesn't quite seem reasonable. Hilarious though this episode.Yes, this season seems a notch more amped up than season 3, the writing sometimes reaching more sophisticated levels than I remember season 3.  In the second episode, we're introduced to Lana who Jack had been set up with by Larry as a paid escort date.  Lana moves in next door.  This one wasn't quite as funny as the first one, but seems to justify Jack's stress level, scenario forced as it may have been.  I miss the Ropers!  Now I notice in the opening credits sequence when Jack is riding the go-cart, he sees a girl pass him by in another go-cart and he's distracted and crashes into a go-cart and smiles - the girl he saw is Lana!  After this episode I now see this scene in a new light.  I hadn't realized that was Lana.Episode 3 and Chrissy continues to crack me up.  Janet is looking like Pat Benetar.  Furley comes in in this one and i won't give anything away, but I almost cried it was so funny.  A champagne bath?  LOVE those scarves! Oh my goodness.  This one truly had me in stitches.

In fact, after the Ropers left, it was as if the entire show had a face lift and had new blood pumped into it.Joyce DeWitt looked her best this year, trading in big hair and frumpy clothes for a short sexy spiky 'do and body hugging designer jeans. Richard Kline finally became a full-fledge regular, and last but not least was Ann Wedgeworth's Lana Shields, who practically steals every scene she was in.The antics and zaniness was turn up to the nth degree in season four, mainly due to Suzanne Somer's Chrissy, who had de-evolve from someone who was just naive to someone who was so dumb you wonder how on earth did she ever get through the day, much less hold a job. But in any case, her radical transformation of the character generated some of the biggest and most memorable laughs in the series's history.Sadly, the series' success got into Ms. Somer's head, and this year turn out to be the last full year she was with the show.

Every season has something special to comment about and to be remembered but season 4 definitely goes over the roof! The episodes here are HILLARIOUS! Each and every element for this season was magnified big time!!! And unfortunely (for many fans of this show) the Ropers had to go by season 4 due renovation of ideas because as much as I loved them too at the beginning, they started to become a drag by season 3 with the same old jokes and issues between Stanley and Helen. On the other hand, I must make a special comment and point out how GORGEOUS AND SEXY the stunning Suzanne Somers looks in this season. Man! Ever since the first episode I just can't take my eyes off of her! She looks beautiful, funny and so sexy in every episode she appears. Her character (Chrissy) definitely was developed once again after what they had lost in her in season 3. I must point out that I even mentioned in my last review for season 3 that Chrissy had become dumb and needless. But now, she's back to stay! And I must say that if I had lived back in the days when this season started I would've had a MAJOR crush on her (not that I don't have one for her now, though). It is great also that Larry became a more regular character in the episodes and the inclusions of Mr. Furley (the new landlord) and Lana (the new and sexy neighbor who's more than interested in Jack) was a thumb up... well, as far as Lana goes I believe she only stayed for this season before she was vanished by the 5th one (honestly I've had fun with her, I always thought she was a character to appear only in that episode where she meets Jack at restaurant as a favor he did for Larry). However you see it, this season goes beyond the first three in many aspects for good. Get this show wheter you like this show or not. You'll laught big time and you'll see how a vintage show like this back from the late 70's and mid-80's was so ahead of its time when it came to talk about sex jokes and references of this kind.",5,LOVED IT!!!!!!

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[7, 8]","I was really looking forward to Season Four because it's when Don Knotts joined the cast as the swingin bachelor Ralph Furley!!! Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the Ropers, but they ran their course. The storylines were also alot funnier with the inclusion of the maneating Lonna! They had the perfect love-triangle, Lonna lusting after Jack,and Mr. Furley lusting after Lonna.Although I really enjoyed this season I didn't like the way they made the character of Chrissy just too dumb. When Suzanne bleached her hair to an extreme shade of blonde and wore those childish ponytails she looked even more stupid! It was a sad downfall of her once funny character. However I thought Joyce DeWitt looked even better and was alot funnier in season four.Well, it's a little bittersweet to write this review because John Ritter was the true star of this show and was even funnier this season.

892450,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0007WFXL2,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[1, 1]","When Three's Company came back to the airways for a fourth season on September 11, 1979, many long-running viewers of the sitcom were displeased. Two breakthrough characters, Stanley and Helen Roper (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley), were written out to star in their own series, The Ropers.There are good things about this season, despite the negative backlash. John Ritter as Jack, Joyce DeWitt as Janet, and Suzanne Sommers as Chrissy seem to &#34;come to life&#34; this season. The character of Janet, particularly, was previously viewed as a poof-haired, glasses wearing nerd of sorts, who played second fiddle to the &#34;beautiful&#34; Chrissy. But this season, Janet chops off her hair and trades in her baggy clothes for form-fitting blouses and jeans. Personally, I have always favored Janet over Chrissy, both look and talent wise. Don Knotts enters as a well-received replacement for the Ropers as new landlord Ralph Furley, whose brother bought the apartment building. To add spice to the split cast, Ann Wedgeworth comes in as Lana Shields, an attractive older woman, who is pursued by Mr. Furley, but who in turn, expresses she has the &#34;hots&#34; for Jack. Richard Kline as Larry Dallas is made a series regular this year, and he too shines.Unlike the majority, I do think Three's Company went downhill after the Ropers left. If anything, it got better. I was never the Ropers' biggest fan from the beginning, anyways. I mean, I liked them, they were funny, but they seemed to be very clich&eacute;d and overrated. To simplify it: I never saw how the Ropers were so hilariously funny.In addition, I think Don Knotts and Ann Wedgeworth, and their characters, were better suited for the sitcom. They were zany, silly, and somewhat unrealistic, but it worked out for the best. Or, let's just say, it worked out for me. I think there was too much time spent trying to make Mr. Furley the new Mr. Roper and too much time spent of making Lana a sex-crazed maniac. That was just the surface for their characters, and while Mr. Furley slowly developed with some sort of a back story, all we ever learned about Lana was she had been divorced three times. Ms. Wedgeworth came in like gangbusters, but after two or three episodes, she's making smaller and smaller appearances. I didn't and don't get it. She was great! Lana was hilarious. He expressions, soft voice, and overall performance was particularly interesting, no matter how long she was on the screen. She was the precise replacement for Mrs. Roper's love-starved older woman role.MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS1) Season Four of Three's Company showed definitely be given a chance. To most, it may not be the best season, but by all means, it is far beyond the worst.2) The Ropers did not make Three's Company. This victory goes to the three initial leads: John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt, and Suzanne Sommers.3) Ann Wedgeworth was wasted. This Tony Award-winning actress had talent that would go for years, but the big-headed producers with their larger-than-average egos thought she just &#34;didn't fit in&#34;. Maybe they didn't know what they were talking about. Three's Company lost a great character, Lana, after just nine episodes. Truly a tragedy.4) Don Knotts was a perfect addition. To me, he was funnier than Mr. Roper. Yes, he was. Once you see him in two or three episodes as Mr. Furley, you will forget about him being Deputy Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show, a role he played nearly two decades earlier.5) The show was at its comedic best this season, in one's opinion. The funniest episodes, one-liners, slapstick, and other over-the-top humor is right here.MUST-SEE EPISODES1) &#34;A-Camping We Will Go&#34; (Season 4, Episode 8)2) &#34;Love Thy Neighbor&#34; (Season 4, Episode 2)3) &#34;The New Landlord&#34; (Season 4, Episode 3)4) &#34;Snow Job&#34; (Season 4, Episode 4)5) &#34;Chrissy's Hospitality&#34; (Season 4, Episode 9)6) &#34;The Love Barge&#34; (Season 4, Episode 11)7) &#34;Ralph's Rival&#34; (Season 4, Episode 12)8) &#34;A Black Letter Day&#34; (Season 4, Episode 13)9) &#34;Hancuffed&#34; (Season 4, Episode 18)10) &#34;The Love Session&#34; (Season 4, Episode 17)Particularly, the earlier episodes of Season Four are the best, especially those featuring all six leads: Jack, Janet, Chrissy, Larry, Mr. Furley, and Lana (ex. &#34;A-Camping We Will Go&#34;). Season Four shines a bit brighter than the other seven seasons of this classic series. It ranks as my favorite season of Three's Company. Its comedy and uplifted sense of direction seem to make the best of what &#34;bad&#34; situations were happening behind-the-scenes.",5,"I say: ""It's better than the other seven

Losing the Ropers for their own series was enough of a risk on its own (TV just wasn't ready for the spiritual precursor of Al and Peg Bundy, without the Children and then the lousy network execs wouldn't fulfil their PROMISE by re-incorporating them by the time season 6 came around, but that's another story), but on the plus side they seemed to have an inkling for the perfect replacement.  And in perfect casting they chose the inestimable Don Knotts (YES!).  I've always loved the goofiness of Mr. Furley and who better than Don Knotts to play him out?I am disappointed to hear that this set will be blooperless, but instead continue with more of the rather pointless ""best of"" montages, which seem to be little more than a waste of space.  The remaining extras, mostly interviews, do sound like they'll be good - as they've been good in the past.  I especially am looking forward to the bits ""Casting Suzanne Sommers"" and ""Casting Don Knotts"" (Also a pity they've ran out of pilots to lump in, but that's okay!)As usual, there's the obligatory episode that has commentary from Chris Mann.  While his book is exceptionally well done, his commentaries aren't quite as exciting and don't tell us much of anything new.  I'd much rather have an actual cast member do this, but the interviews more than make up for this.  Indeed, it's a bit of a surprise to include an interview from Ritter's first wife, Nancy.  That, I suspect, is going to be worth watching.And I feel sorry for the ill-fated Ann Wedgeworth.  Not well used and then discarded, I liked the potential she had.  Especially when fighting off Furley's advances, which was a good way to replace the sparring between Stanley and Helen Roper.Episodes to really look out for are:  ""Love the Neighbor"", ""The New Landlord"" (the first one actually filmed yet third aired), ""Snow Job"", ""Old Folks at Home"", ""A Camping We Will Go"", ""Chrissy's Hospitality"", ""The Love Barge"", ""The Reverend Steps Out"", ""The Love Lesson"", ""Handcuffed"" (this one's great), ""The Root of All Evil"", ""Secret Admirer"", ""The Goodbye Guy"", and ""Jack's Graduation"".DVD quality will likely be as good as season 3's; with the usual plusses and minuses.I'm also looking forward to season 5.
