875920,A20CSFERC3VINT,B0006ZM8M2,"80s fan ""Adam""","[0, 0]","This is one of my favorites seasons of FRIENDS. It is the only one to be over 10 hours. That's because lots of them have a lot of extra footage. This season is really funny. It has some of the best lines like when Rachel said ""Emma just said gleba."" I love the one with the lottery.I think this season has some great guest stars,even one who was on Family Guy.It also has some sad parts like when Monica and Chandler found out that they may never be able to have kids. Phoebe and Mike break up but at the end of the season they get back together. Rachel's other sister Amy appears and she is really funny. Rachel falls in in love with Joey. Rachel goes back to work and Chandler gets a new job. His boss is played by Phil Lewis. Phoebe sings some more funny songs and Charlie Wheeler first appears and a trip to Barbados. A great season that everyone will love.",5,The last full season,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,861,"['one', 'favorites', 'seasons', 'FRIENDS', 'only', 'one', 'be', '10', 'hours', 'lots', 'have', 'lot', 'extra', 'footage', 'season', 'really', 'funny', 'best', 'lines', 'when', 'Rachel', 'said', 'Emma', 'just', 'said', 'gleba', 'love', 'one', 'lottery.I', 'think', 'season', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'even', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'Family', 'Guy.It', 'also', 'sad', 'parts', 'when', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'found', 'out', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'kids', 'Phoebe', 'Mike', 'break', 'up', 'end', 'season', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Rachel', 'other', 'sister', 'Amy', 'really', 'funny', 'Rachel', 'love', 'Joey', 'Rachel', 'back', 'work', 'Chandler', 'new', 'job', 'boss', 'played', 'Phil', 'Lewis', 'Phoebe', 'more', 'funny', 'songs', 'Charlie', 'Wheeler', 'first', 'trip', 'Barbados', 'A', 'great', 'season', 'everyone', 'will', 'love']",Friends: Season 9

Rachel gives birth to Emma and Ross relunctant to propose to her. Rachel ends up having feelings for Joey towards the closing of the season, I just never believed their chemistry, seemed fake and contrived. Phoebe finally has her first long-lasting relationship with Mike played by Paul Rudd. The season finale is a bit disappointing but I am a loyal Friends fan so buying this season is a must.

In other episodes, Ross makes fun of Rachel's male nanny, Ross and Phoebe get mugged, and Chandler and Monica visit a fertility clinic... In the season finale, Joey rebuffs Rachel's advance until he finds Ross kissing the girl he just broke up with.

Hopefully, Rachel will consider getting back together with Ross, now that she is the mother of his second child.Phoebe and Joey decide to go out on a double date. Phoebe has fixed Joey up with one of her friends. She wants Joey to fix her up with one of his, but he hooks Phoebe up with a strange guy named Mike. Phoebe is pissed at Joey, but she forgives him when she and Mike become in love with each other.Rachel and Ross decide to hire a nanny. All of the women they interviewed are not even close to being qualified, until they meet Sandy, a male nanny, who is more sensitive than any woman on this planet. Rachel hires him for she loves his ways with Emma, but Ross finds it unsettling, for he fires him only after a week or two.Thanksgiving has arrived. You would think that from season six, Rachel only had one sister, which was Jill. But for this Thanksgiving, Rachel's other sister, Amy, shows up. She quarrels with Rachel about the fact that she and Ross will not be giving Emma to Amy, if *knock on wood* Ross and Rachel had died.Rachel goes back to work about three weeks early, due to the fact that she maybe replaced permanently, with a guy named Gavin. He comes off as a jerk the first time round, but when he shows up at Rachel's birthday, giving her a birthday kiss, that all changes. Ross and Rachel fight about it, where Rachel moves in with Joey temporarily. Now that Rachel is back with Joey, Rachel and Ross seem to be a lot better in getting a long.Phoebe and Mike have invited Monica to come to Mike's piano bar. Mike plays piano as the customers get up and sing popular songs from the 60s through today. Monica does not want to sing, but she reconsiders and decides to sing the Helen Reddy classic, ""Delta Dawn"". Monica gives a good performance, but the guys in the audience seem to enjoy seeing Monica where a see-through blouse more than hear her sing. While that is going on, Joey is getting his eyebrows shaped. Later, Mike and Phoebe break up because Mike's first marriage failed and he does not want to go through another marriage. After that, Phoebe runs into David, her ex-boyfriend from the first season's New Year's Eve party. They begin dating again.Later, we find that Rachel has now developed loving feelings for Joey. As she goes through that, we find out that Monica and Chandler, who have been wanting to have a child since the day they said their I Do's, cannot have children through the natural process. They have three options: Surrogacy, Insemination, Adoption. Monica does not want to do a surrogacy, since she has prepared herself to carry a child. They temporarily go for the artificial insemination, but from another donor. Chandler thinks he's found the perfect donor named Zack, who works with Chandler. But Monica decides not to go with insemination, for she wants a child that is hers and Chandler's. They decide to adopt.Ross meets Charlie, an assistant female Paleontologist, who is dropdead gorgeous. He readies himself to ask her out, but Joey took the liberty of it. Later on, Ross is scheduled to hold a Paleontology conference in Barbados, and he has invited Charlie and the gang out to Barbados. Charlie breaks up with Joey, for he has nothing in common with Charlie. Joey finds out about Rachel's feelings and begins kissing her passionately, after seeing Ross kiss Charlie. Phoebe knows that David, who has joined the gang as well, will propose to her, but Mike, after talking to Monica over the phone, shows up in Barbados and wins Phoebe back. Phoebe, although feeling sorry for David, goes back to Mike for good.More laughs fill this hilarious ninth season of Friends.

875929,A32EDSKLEUZ3Y7,B0006ZM8M2,Chris,"[5, 6]",I think I have watched Friends/Joey since the second season.At First I thought this was the worst season because of all the stupid plot twist. But the charectors were pretty good. Here are the episodes that I feel were the best on this season.196(2)-The one where Emma Cries-Chandler accidentally falls asleep and accepts a job in Tulsa.Joey is mad at Joey and takes a swing at him at central perk and breaks his finger.198(4)-The One with the Sharks. Monica sees Chandler at the hotel in Tulsa and thinks Chandler is the master of Domain at the Hotel to sharks. It is discovered it was regular porn(Why didn't he keep the door closed thats obvious)199(5)-Phoebe has her B-Day party with the other 5. She gives a lecture on them arriving late and her self leaves early. Joey sais to the waitors that he will eat 6 servings of food.200(6)-The One with the male nanny. Freddie Prinze was not good but Ross was really funny. Ross has the guy get fired.204(10)-The One with the Christmass in Tulsa-Chandler's female hits on him. He has to now quit the job because of it.208(14)-The One with the Blind Dates-Joey and Phoebe want to get Ross and Rachel back togeather they get terrible dates.Rachel goes out with Steve(Lovitz) the pot head from Episode 15(The One with the Stoned Guy) the dates go bad.209(15)-The One with the Mugging-Joey had hard time with a audition with Jeff Goldblum. Phoebe mugged Ross when he was a younger person. Chandler becomes a intern in advatising.211(17)-The One with the Memorial Service-Ross and Chandler do stupid things. Ross calls Chandler a homosexual and Chandler sais Ross is dead. Ross decides to be a perv and holds a memorial service.A Hot girl is the only one there. Ross tries to get her of course he does not as she leaves angerily.212(18)-The One with the lottery-They gets some lottery tickets.A nice little episode that is about true friendship.214(20)-The One with the soap opera party-Joey holds a secret Days of our Life Party.Chandler goes to some Crazy ladies play.Ross meets Charlie and starts to like her.217(23)-The One in Barbados Part 1 and 2.

875931,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0006ZM8M2,Craig MACKINNON,"[2, 2]","For sheer enjoyment, it's a shame to say, this is my least favourite Friends season (probably tied with Season 1).  There's nothing particularly wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing much to grab the attention.  Well, that's not exactly true - there are, of course, some very funny episodes and story arcs - but taken as a sum over the whole season, I just didn't enjoy it as much as Seasons 2-8.The ongoing plots illustrate the aging of the characters, much to the credit of the writers who made no attempt to try and keep the characters in a forever-young time warp.  For example, in my favourite arc, Ross is gaining reputation as a professor of paleontology, so much so that he's asked to give a keynote speech at a conference in the Caribbean (when Joey shows up at the conference hotel, he's shocked that Ross could be more popular than he!)  At the same time, Aisha Taylor is introduced as Ross's university colleague who immediately starts dating Joey.  Since the character is played by Aisha Taylor, it finally brings some real ethnic diversity to the program (which is never specifically emphasized, which is also to the writers' credit, given that they had received grief over the level of ""whiteness"" in the cast).In other multi-episodic plot developments, Rachel has a crush on Joey, which feels contrived, and Monica and Chandler have trouble conceiving a child, which is an unexpectedly serious subplot.  Unfortunately, I never felt particualarly invested in either subplot.  But both were probably more interesting than the Mike-Phoebe relationship, which went from such promise early in the season to being very mundane/trite by the end.  There is a little liveliness supplied by the return of Hank Azaria's David, the physicist who moved to Minsk, and who is my favourite minor character.But who are we kidding, really?  Anyone who's bought seasons 1-8 is also going to buy this, if only for completeness.  Every episode is still funny, and there are some very good episodes.  There are just none that really take off for me.  It almost seems like the pseudo-limbo the show was in (whether or not it would be the last season) was distracting.  As I recall, the 10th season, which was well-known to be the last, was tighter and had better subplots.

875938,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0006ZM8M2,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[34, 39]","Heading into the ninth season of Friends, just about everyone associated with the show figured this was going to be their last season. Even fans were expecting the show to wrap when filming on the ninth season ended.Only midway through season nine did the powers that be and the actors agree on one more season, a truncated 18 episodes for the 10th and final season.With that possible ending in mind, writers had to be careful as they opened the season, knowing that they may be pushing toward a finale when the season drew to a close.Getting caught up, season eight ended with the birth of Ross and Rachel's baby, Emma. Joey inadvertantly proposed to Rachel, and the new mother, obviously a little confused, said yes, prompting an interesting start to season nine.Joey's feelings for Rachel had come out in season eight, and he knew that his accidental proposal to Rachel would certainly cause a lot of tension with everyone, particularly Ross. The story line surrounding the three served as a good start to the ninth season.The season took a lot of moves along the way, with all the characters making some major choices in their lives. Monica and Chandler agree that they want to have a baby of their own, but continually fail to become pregnant, leading them to a fertility clinic, where they learn it may be impossible for them to have kids. While this show was known for its comedic moments, this storyline served as one of the more touching moments in the show, yet still was able to maintain the comedy aspect. Chandler and Monica are great together, as Courtney Cox Arquette and Matthew Perry have some very good chemistry. His laid-back approach and her uptightness go well together. Season nine also finds Chandler out of a job and serving as an intern with an ad company, finally moving on from statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.Of course the big life changing moment for Ross and Rachel is Emma. Rachel moves in with Ross, which provides many strange moments, as they both try to live their lives with an ex and a kid in the same apartment. One of the funniest moments in the season is an episode where Rachel is leaving Emma for the first time and her and Ross get locked out of the apartment with the baby still inside. Ross's great story about the eagle and the baby, along with his great gestures to go with it, was hilarious. Of course, Ross and Rachel have a history and eventually they decide living together wasn't the best idea and Rachel heads back to Joey's.After his proposal to Rachel, Joey finds himself in a tough situation with Ross. A viewer genuinely feels that Joey's feelings for Rachel are true, but at the same time, he knows he can't act on them. At least not at the beginning of the year. Through the season, Joey wrongly believes that Monica is cheating on Chandler while he is in Tulsa, gets Phoebe a job as an extra on Days of our Lives and misses his appearance in the big Thanksgiving Day parade. His life changing moment however, comes at the end of the season. After his breakup with paleontologist Charlie, he sees Ross kissing her and decides that is time to act on his feelings for Rachel, closing the ninth season.Phoebe got caught in a love triangle, forcing her to choose between David, her scientist boyfriend who returned from Minsk, and Mike, the piano playing former lawyer who Joey set her up with on a blind date (accidentally of course). When Phoebe finds out that Mike never wants to get married because of his failed marriage, this causes them to break up, sending her into the arms of David. However, it is Mike who swoops in at the end to take Phoebe's heart away.The season ends in Barbados, a great way to end the season, as the gang gathers for Ross's convention. Mike's proposal, Joey and Rachel's kiss and even Ross and Charlie, provide fuel for the final season.Season nine featured some great guest stars. Paul Rudd is excellent as Mike, and he fits right in with the cast. Hank Azaria is also very good as the stammering, nervous David. He hits the nail right on the head. Aisha Tyler is good as the beautiful paleontologist Charlie. However, stealing the guest star show is Christina Applegate as Rachel's sister Amy. She won an Emmy for this role and it is well deserved. She was fantastic in her role in the Thanksgiving episode.Extras include three commentaries from the executive producers, a quiz show, a look ahead to the final season, a music video and a great gag reel.This season set, like the eight before it, is very well done and will help preserve one of the best comedies of our generation for years to come.",5,"And now, the end is near",1112832000,"04 7,

Here are the episodes of the ninth season of ""Friends"":9.01 The One Where No One Proposes9.02 The One Where Emma Cries9.03 The One With the Pediatrician9.04 The One With the Sharks9.05 The One With Phoebe's Birthday Dinner9.06 The One With the Male Nanny9.07 The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song9.08 The One With Rachel's Other Sister9.09 The One With Rachel's Phone Number9.10 The One With Christmas in Tulsa9.11 The One Where Rachel Goes Back To Work9.12 The One With Phoebe's Rats9.13 The One Where Monica Sings9.14 The One With The Blind Dates9.15 The One With The Mugging9.16 The One With The Boob Job9.17 The One With The Memorial Service9.18 The One With The Lottery9.19 The One With Rachel's Dream9.20 The One With The Soap Opera Party9.21 The One With The Fertility Test9.22 The One With The Donor*9.23 The One In Barbados, part 1*9.24 The One In Barbados, part 2*(9.23 and 9.24 are combined together in one episode with a approximate 1 hour long season finale.)My favorite episode is the last one in this season which is 9.23 and 9.24 (which are combined together in one episode) because it is funny especially the scene of the sunny-rain of the speech to beach.  Also, the scene of the ping-pong game is funny.  And Finally, the final scene about the kissing is very touching.  However, other episodes are also funny.  Like 9.15, it is pretty good because Joey has an audition for a boardway play which he uses a special techinque to make those people (including the ""Lost World"" guest star) impressed.Overall, this season is one of best season so far.  All the episodes are good.  Worth to watch it and worth buying.

In FRIENDS, none (I repeat NONE) of the six main cast members gave any interviews or details specially for the DVD release. Not a single one!!

That's ALL you'll get!! What disrespect for their fans. Shame on you, Matt, Schwimmer, Aniston, Kudrow, LeBlanc and Courteney. There were already hints that they are six really greedy people, and this proves it, because they knew the DVD's would sell anyway and did not want to spend their ""precious"" time with it... Or did they ask too much money to do them...? Who knows?Look at SEINFELD's DVD's. There is a kind of ""making-off"" for almost EACH EPISODE!! There are plenty of interviews with all the ensemble cast, ALL OF THEM, including Jerry. And 90 percent of the extras were made for the DVD edition, and not simply taken from TV interviews or specials from the past! It's clear that everything was made with care and thinking about the fans. It's a lesson that, unfortunately, will make no impact in Warner BRos to modify the extras in FRIENDS, because it's already the ninth season....As for the show itself, of course FRIENDS is very good.

875954,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B0006ZM8M2,Thayer,"[5, 5]","Season 9 deals with Rachel being a mother to the newborn Emma, the introduction of Phoebe's soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd), Chandler and Monica deciding to finally have a baby, and the last minute reemergence of Ross-Rachel-Joey triangle. I believe all of them produced productive stories for the characters except the triangle. I think it was a wrong turn not only was it already done before, it produced absolutely nothing except dragged the Ross and Rachel hookup. (I mean does anybody really think Rachel and Joey will end up together?) But I can forgive that wrong turn because Season 9 is a strong season in spite of that.There are a number of standout episodes but here are my top five.1. TOW the Lottery - this is an ensemble show and the fact that I chose this as the best episode of the season just proves that the show is really at its strongest when all the cast is together. There's some great one-liners, some slapstick, and some drama. I love this episode!2. TOW Rachel's Other Sister - Another ensemble episode and another standout Thanksgiving episode. Christina Applegate gave an amusing performance. Some great one-liners from Rachel (""I went to the zoo yesterday, now I'm a koala bear"" ""Yeah Ross when I have a heart attack at a restaurant I want you there with your fossil brush"") Some classic Monica obsessing with the plates and kookiness of Phoebe (check out how she's the only one eating the food the way Monica asked them to protect the plates) and you've got a classic episode.3. TOW Emma Cries - The girls stole this episode. And it was a relief that Emma would actually be used well as a comedic material  Lisa Kudrow was just a riot here (""This just proves that no good can come from having sex with Ross"" ""Have I gone deaf"") And there's the Ross-Joey storyline which is  a good B story.4. TOW the Inappropriate Song - I like this episode largely because of Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe finally meets Mike's parents. I love how she adopts that ""upscale-Hepburnesque"" accent, how she inadvertently blurts out her not so impressive past, how she forces herself to eat meat, and how she brings Smelly cat in the conversation. I love everything about it.5. TOW the Male Nanny - The 200th episode, Freddie Prinze Jr. surprisingly gave an amusing and not to mention a non-annoying performance. It's a funny storyline with Schwimmer and Aniston having some funny scenes.

Story arcs, character development, general storylines and developments, etc. and just the overall funniess of the jokes are not as good here as previous seasons. Personally, I think the first 6 are the best, and each one since has been compartively weaker than the last. While this season has some great moments, the stories are just really lacking and show the obvious strain the writers were coming up with for compelling situations. They didn't really switch things up or try anything new or interesting here (like say Will & Grace has this past year) and so it just sort of feels dissapointing.
