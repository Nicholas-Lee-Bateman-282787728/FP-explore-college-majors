991736,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000FKO3GW,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[1, 1]","Shows such as Prison Break, Heroes, Lost, the old X-files are, to a significant degree, reflections of how many of us perceive the world around us during these uncertain and unsettled times:- larger portions of our lives are influenced or even controlled by high-level entities or organizations who now have the means to implement their agendas- things are almost never what they seem because hidden forces are at work- only very few insiders completely understand and control and set the agendas for these all-controlling entities- we should consider ourselves lucky if we can figure out the who's and the how's that change our world but we may never get to know the why's- these hidden and mysterious 'powers that be' plot, plan and act globallyOn 'Season 1' Michael Scowfield gets himself convicted so that he can be sent to prison so that he can help his brother, who is (unjustly) on death row, escape. Does it sound over-complicated? It does, because it is. While working on the escape, Michael, a control freak and a genius, interacts with a dozen inmate characters, ranging from mid-level Mafia types, to unjustly convicted, to unlucky, to mentally deranged, to truly sadistic, vicious murderers. And, there's the world outside. He has friends who help him and his brother has extremely powerful enemies - how does the President of the U.S. look like, when we think of enemies? Well... she's far from being the most powerful because there is this mysterious 'company', controlled by we don't know exactly whom attempting to implement some agenda we are not aware of (see the first paragraphs of this review for more clarifications).This is a GREAT series, in fact my overall favorite and the Blu-ray version takes advantage of the higher screen resolution. I do not believe that there are any gee-whiz, Blu-ray specific extras on this bundle but I don't care much for extra anyway.

I will say House, 24, Lost, Monk, Dead Zone, Smallville (all up coming box sets in the next few months) were all very  good this year, but Prison Break kept you interested, kept you entertained and twisted your interests weekly. And it beat all the CSIs and Law & Orders hands down!The producers say that this show (Prison Break) is a story will be told in 44 episodes  (That is two TV seasons for you and I)(TV Guide April 2006)..All I can say is I hope not.This show was just as gritty as the prison drama OZ , just as tension filled twists as this season of 24, Just as character driven as ER or Smallville and with a great adventure story to boot...It also owes a tip of the fidora to the movie the Wrong Man. So FOX, when is the fall season coming-so i can see new episodes of Break?The box set is worth it for the extras alone-action and production audio comments, promos, features,etc--This is what a GREAT box set is about!If you didnt get the 24 advance disk which came out earlier this year  with the first episode of Prison Break and a feature about the show attached ...TOO BAD-however  all those interviews are on this box setAll I can say is GO GET IT NOW!Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD",5,This Season's Best New Show,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1331,"['title', '22', 'episode', 'drama', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'FOX', 'anyone', 'else', 'Network', 'had', 'offer', 'season', 'Drama', 'will', 'say', 'House', '24', 'Lost', 'Monk', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Smallville', 'up', 'coming', 'box', 'sets', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'year', 'Prison', 'Break', 'kept', 'interested', 'kept', 'entertained', 'twisted', 'interests', 'weekly', 'beat', 'CSIs', 'Law', 'Orders', 'down', 'producers', 'say', 'show', 'Prison', 'Break', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'told', '44', 'episodes', 'two', 'TV', 'seasons', 'TV', 'Guide', 'April', '2006', 'can', 'say', 'hope', 'not.This', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'gritty', 'prison', 'drama', 'OZ', 'just', 'tension', 'filled', 'twists', 'season', '24', 'Just', 'character', 'driven', 'ER', 'Smallville', 'great', 'adventure', 'story', 'boot', 'also', 'tip', 'fidora', 'movie', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'So', 'FOX', 'when', 'fall', 'season', 'coming-so', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'new', 'episodes', 'Break', 'box', 'set', 'extras', 'alone-action', 'production', 'audio', 'comments', 'promos', 'features', 'etc', 'what', 'GREAT', 'box', 'set', 'didnt', 'get', '24', 'advance', 'disk', 'came', 'out', 'earlier', 'year', 'first', 'episode', 'Prison', 'Break', 'feature', 'show', 'attached', 'TOO', 'BAD-however', 'interviews', 'are', 'box', 'setAll', 'can', 'say', 'GO', 'GET', 'IT', 'NOW', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",N/A

Wilson ""Christmas Lover""","[1, 1]","I am a new fan of the series and admit that I never had taken the time to watch any of the episodes while they were on air but I am certainly glad I checked it out now because it is a fantastic series!  It took me just a few episodes to become hooked and the thing I love most about this show is that just when you think you have things figured out, it pulls a complete 180 on you and I love when a show can do that.  It does not happen all that often and when it does, you know you found something worth watching.  I have heard that the rest of the seasons get to be a bit much in terms of being on the outlandish and unbelievable side of things, however this first season does not feel like that to me.  I mean, come on, most shows are going to be far fetched anyway simply because of the fact that it is fiction and it is meant to entertain so I really do not think there is anything wrong with that.  I am always pumped to watch the next episode wondering how they could possibly top the one before.  I would definitely recommend this series to anyone that is ready to be on the edge of their seats for the better part of an hour.

991750,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FKO3GW,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","While I normally like these kind of shows, Prison Break was one of those kind of shows that always fits through the cracks. For every show like Lost or Heroes that manage to stay on the air, there's always those that get cancelled prematurely so I didn't bother to check it out. Not having anything to watch I thought I'd give it a shot. With season 2 nearing DVD release and season 3 on the way, it's nice to get a head start. While I wouldn't say it's one of the best shows on television right now, it's certainly one of the more entertaining and addictive ones.Most spend their life trying to stay out of prison but for Michael Scofield, he wants in. His brother Lincoln Burrows is on death row framed for the murder of the Vice President's brother and so it's Michael's plan to get into the prison as an inmate and with knowledge and a near full-torso tattoo of the prison's layout, sets in plan an elaborate escape. But that's not so easy as some inside the prison find out and want in while others outside the prison want to make sure Burrows is dead one way or the other.One of the strengths of a show like this is each episode gets you more and more excited about nearing the end as the story continues to leave you guessing. And with a show like this where every episode ends with some kind of cliffhanger, you'll find you keep putting on the next DVD to find out what happens. However that can also be the show's weakness as it's hard to re-watch the show since you know where it's going and how it'll end. It's good TV anyways although it's hard to tell if the show has lasting power if you already watch the whole season.One of the things you need to do when you watch is to turn your brain off just a tad. It's not a show where anything can and does happen but there's some many instances of coincidence or convenience that you just have to forget all of it and just go along with it. There's some trouble spots such as a big cliffhanger followed by a flashback show of all things and you start to get a little impatient at just how long it's taken to get to the breakout but then we have the last 3 episodes which are probably one of the more exciting season enders around.While Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell do admirable but not stellar jobs in their roles, the strength largely comes from its supporting cast from Robert Knepper playing the creepy pedophile ""T-Bag"" to ""C-Note"" to Scofield's cellmate, the likable Sucre who's suspicious that his girl will move on while he's in jail, it's easy to like the cast around them and root for them, particularly Knepper who somehow manages to be darkly funny yet a huge dark part you don't want to be near.It may be a bit too macho for some since not only is it predominantly male in its cast but in its tone, it's also compelling TV so why not?",5,"4.5, fun addicting TV",1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,2811,"['normally', 'kind', 'shows', 'Prison', 'Break', 'was', 'one', 'kind', 'shows', 'always', 'cracks', 'show', 'Lost', 'Heroes', 'manage', 'stay', 'air', 'always', 'get', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'check', 'out', 'Not', 'having', 'anything', 'watch', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'season', '2', 'nearing', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', '3', 'way', 'nice', 'get', 'head', 'start', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'addictive', 'ones.Most', 'spend', 'life', 'trying', 'stay', 'prison', 'Michael', 'Scofield', 'brother', 'Lincoln', 'Burrows', 'death', 'row', 'framed', 'murder', 'Vice', 'President', 'brother', 'Michael', 'plan', 'get', 'prison', 'inmate', 'knowledge', 'near', 'full-torso', 'tattoo', 'prison', 'layout', 'sets', 'plan', 'elaborate', 'escape', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'prison', 'find', 'out', 'want', 'others', 'prison', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'Burrows', 'dead', 'one', 'way', 'other.One', 'strengths', 'show', 'episode', 'more', 'more', 'excited', 'nearing', 'end', 'story', 'leave', 'guessing', 'show', 'where', 'episode', 'kind', 'cliffhanger', ""'ll"", 'find', 'keep', 'putting', 'next', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'However', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'show', 'weakness', 'hard', 're-watch', 'show', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'how', ""'ll"", 'end', 'good', 'TV', 'anyways', 'hard', 'tell', 'show', 'lasting', 'power', 'already', 'watch', 'whole', 'season.One', 'things', 'need', 'do', 'when', 'watch', 'turn', 'brain', 'off', 'just', 'tad', 'not', 'show', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'many', 'instances', 'coincidence', 'convenience', 'just', 'have', 'forget', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'trouble', 'spots', 'such', 'big', 'cliffhanger', 'followed', 'flashback', 'show', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'little', 'impatient', 'just', 'how', 'long', 'taken', 'get', 'breakout', 'then', 'have', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'exciting', 'season', 'enders', 'around.While', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'do', 'admirable', 'not', 'stellar', 'jobs', 'roles', 'strength', 'largely', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'playing', 'creepy', 'T-Bag', 'C-Note', 'Scofield', 'cellmate', 'likable', 'Sucre', 'who', 'suspicious', 'girl', 'will', 'move', 'jail', 'easy', 'like', 'cast', 'root', 'particularly', 'Knepper', 'who', 'somehow', 'manages', 'be', 'darkly', 'funny', 'yet', 'huge', 'dark', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'near.It', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'macho', 'not', 'only', 'predominantly', 'cast', 'tone', 'also', 'compelling', 'TV', 'so', 'why', 'not']",N/A

991752,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000FKO3GW,Cubist,"[9, 11]","The opening of the Prison Break television show is something right out of a Sam Fuller movie. A non-descript man gets an extensive tattoo on his body and then proceeds to rob a bank with the sole purpose of getting arrested. He pleads no contest and is sent to Fox River State Penitentiary for five years. Why? It turns out to be part of an elaborate plan devised by Michael Scofield (Miller) so that he can hook up with his brother Lincoln (Purcell) who is in the same prison, sentenced to die for a crime he did not commit: killing the Vice-President's brother.There is a lot more going on in Prison Break than just its intriguing premise. The show cuts between Michael and Lincoln's exploits in prison and the elaborate conspiracy that exists in the outside world that may have resulted in Lincoln's unjust incarceration. There is a sparseness, an economy to the prison dialogue that is refreshing and gives it a B-movie feel with its loads of tough guy speak. The series has the same kind of edgy, pulpy feel but with a polished sheen reminiscent of 24 and Lost and it should be interesting to see if it can maintain the same level of quality and tension in the second season.There are ten audio commentaries for several episodes.The first disc features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by creator Paul Scheuring and actor Dominic Purcell. . Scheuring talks about the challenge of casting the roles of Michael and Lincoln but tends to start most comments with ""This is the guy..."" or ""In this scene..."" which gets tiresome pretty fast.The second commentary for this episode is by its director Brett Ratner and editor Mark Helfrich. Ratner agreed to shoot the episode only if he could use his crew that works on his movies. The director is surprisingly engaging and informative: everything that the first one with Scheuring should have been.There is a commentary on ""Cute Poison"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell and Wade Williams. Scheuring continues his self-congratulatory comments while Purcell cracks jokes and Williams is barely there.The second commentary on this track is by its writer Matt Olmstead and actor Silas Weir Mitchell. They provide plenty of interesting and amusing anecdotes filming this episode.The second disc features a commentary on ""Riots, Drills and The Devil (Part I)"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Amaury Nolasco, Williams, Robert Knepper and Sarah Wayne Callies. Scheuring talks about some of the censorship he faced. For example, the studio made him change a tattoo of Jesus on Michael's arm to the Devil so they wouldn't offend religious folks.The second commentary for this episode is with its director Robert Mandell and writer Nick Santora who talks about the various script changes and addresses the tattoo controversy. Both are well-spoken and provide good observations on this episode.Also included is a commentary for ""Riots, Drills and The Devil (Part II)"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Nolasco, Williams and Peter Stormare who talks about growing his hair for the role and not playing his character like a traditional Italian mob boss. One wishes that he spoke up more as his comments, including a story about John Heard, are very entertaining.The third disc includes a commentary on ""Odd Man Out"" by producer Garry Brown, director Bobby Roth and writer Karyn Usher. They talk about the challenges of incorporating the tattoos into the story and using them as a device to provide clues to Michael's plan.The fourth disc has a commentary on ""Brother's Keeper"" by Scheuring and cast members Purcell, Nolasco, Williams, Knepper and Callies. This was a flashback episode to show the dramatic arc of the relationship between Michael and his brother. The actors talk about the cold weather they had to endure while shooting this episode.There is a second commentary by director Greg Yaitanes and writer Zack Estrin. This was a nice change of pace for the actors because it got them out of the prison. Estrin talks about some of the script changes and they both end up discussing character development in some detail.The sixth disc contains the rest of the extras, including ""Making of Prison Break"" with Scheuring and Ratner talking about the origins of the show. The director was impressed by how well plotted it was and with Scheuring's vision. However, a lot of their comments are repeated in the various commentary tracks while key cast members talk about the arcs of their characters in this so-so extra.""If These Walls Could Speak: Profile of the Joliet Correctional Center"" profiles the prison they shoot the show in. A lot of infamous criminals were incarcerated there - including Al Capone and John Wayne Gacy. This extra also provides a history of the place, takes a tour of key locations and examines life in prison.""Beyond the Ink"" examines Michael's elaborate tattoo and how integral it is to the show. Tattoo artist Tom Berg talks about designing the tattoos and shows off some of his preliminary sketches.""Fox Movie Channel Presents: Making a Scene - Prison Break"" takes a look at a scene between Michael and his new cellmate Haywire (Silas Weir Mitchell) in his cell and the challenge of shooting in such small, confined spaces. It goes into various aspects, including screenplay and cinematography and how these all fit together in the final product.Finally, there is a promo for season two and six T.V. spots.",5,"B-movie

991754,A3HCCW3SPK41VG,B000FKO3GW,Darius Williamson,"[1, 1]","If you have an older brother on death row that got framed for murdering the Vice President's brother, how far would you go to prevent his execution?  Unlike the rest of us, Michael Scofield decides to get his hands dirty and conjure up an escape plan that would make the `Escape from Alcatraz' inmates feel proud.  How?  Step one: be the structural engineer that previously worked on the max security penitentiary his brother, Lincoln Burrows, is imprisoned under.  Step two: tattoo the prison's blueprints onto your entire torso.  Step three: fake a bank robbery and get thrown into Fox River prison.  Step four: create a route to freedom, which may require the assistance of other belligerent convicts and prison staffers (including the kind-hearted doc and warden).  Step five: escape, and run like hell.I don't envy him, but boy is it fun to watch Scofield frantically scramble to save his flesh and blood.The same goes for Prison Break itself, which successfully combines the fragile prison hierarchy of `Oz' with the frenetic, tense action of `24', Fox's other flagship thriller. The crazy concept works partly because Scofield's a likable protagonist viewers can root for.  Actor Wentworth Miller plays the quirky genius with enough charm, but thanks to his unimposing physicality, Miller also breathes an impenetrable stoicism into him that needs to endure through treacherous, often masochistic trials to reach the end goal.  Within two episodes, it's clear that his success, and maybe his survival, depends on it.Adding to the stress is the ruthless `Company', the shadow organization behind Lincoln's fabricated murder.  They not only aim to truncate Scofield's plans on liberating Lincoln, they also want to halt the investigation that Lincoln's lawyer/ex-girlfriend Veronica initiated to unearth the cover up that framed him.  The deeper she digs to discover the ugly truth, the more she opens up a can of worms, and subsequently, the more the body count grows.PB is without doubt a fairly grim, nihilistic show, and the violent content is on par with `24's' most squeamish scenes.  However, don't think PB drowns in hopelessness.  There's plenty of humor sprinkled throughout to counterbalance the bleak tone.  Witnessing every step of Scofield's ingenious plan is also part of the addictive fun, just to see how he escapes every dangerous mess that crops up.Any potential viewer will have to make one compromise though: swallow PB's preposterousness. True, speaking on a primetime TV show's ridiculous qualities is redundant, but with PB, unless you're willing to seriously suspend disbelief, you'll catch yourself screaming ""WTF?!"" somewhere down the road and angrily shutting off the DVD player.  If that's not an issue, you'll find PB season one to be an exhilarating, tense experience.Alas, it can also be a frustrating one.  While the first thirteen episodes are tightly written and well paced, the latter nine feel uneven, rushed and deluded with quality-killing filler sideplots.  Also, at that point, Scofield's clever actions get increasingly asinine, and the plot runs around in unprogressive circles.  A `Lost'-style flashback episode, in contrast, feels hastily constructed and crudely focused. At times, it feels like the writers had to stretch the material thin enough to fit 22 episodes, instead of a more cohesive 18.Luckily, the supporting cast helped PB season one get through its rough patch.  Some of PB's central prisoners, like mob boss John Abruzzi and white supremacist/serial rapist T-Bag, seem like prison genre clich&eacute;s at first, but their respective actors flesh them out past any predictable archetype.  The same goes with security guard Brad Bellick, who's the kind of prick anyone would loathe.  The mix of personalities clashing within the prison's claustrophobic confines makes for exciting banter and interconnected conflicts.  On the `Company's' end, Agent Kellerman brings a frightening physical presence to the organization through his numerous assassinations outside the prison walls.  He's just as creepy as the `Others', back in `Lost's' own first season.After you get off the roller-coaster-ride, you'll most likely want to buy the other Prison Break DVD sets, but honestly, it's tough to recommend them beyond the second season.  While season two is decent, seasons three and four are unwatchable train wrecks (they weren't pre-planned like the first two seasons and that really shows).  However, the first year is a gem, and unlike most other primetime shows on TV.",5,"Prison Break's clever premise, tense drama and fascinating characters shoot it above most serialized dramas",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,4529,"['have', 'older', 'brother', 'death', 'row', 'got', 'framed', 'murdering', 'Vice', 'President', 'brother', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'prevent', 'execution', 'rest', 'Michael', 'Scofield', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'conjure', 'up', 'escape', 'plan', 'would', 'make', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'inmates', 'feel', 'proud', 'How', 'Step', 'one', 'be', 'structural', 'engineer', 'previously', 'worked', 'max', 'security', 'penitentiary', 'brother', 'Lincoln', 'Burrows', 'imprisoned', 'Step', 'two', 'tattoo', 'prison', 'blueprints', 'entire', 'torso', 'Step', 'three', 'fake', 'bank', 'robbery', 'get', 'thrown', 'Fox', 'River', 'prison', 'Step', 'four', 'create', 'route', 'freedom', 'may', 'require', 'assistance', 'other', 'belligerent', 'convicts', 'prison', 'staffers', 'including', 'kind-hearted', 'doc', 'warden', 'Step', 'five', 'escape', 'run', 'hell.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'envy', 'boy', 'fun', 'watch', 'Scofield', 'frantically', 'scramble', 'save', 'flesh', 'blood.The', 'same', 'Prison', 'Break', 'successfully', 'fragile', 'prison', 'hierarchy', 'Oz', 'frenetic', 'tense', 'action', '24', 'Fox', 'other', 'flagship', 'thriller', 'crazy', 'concept', 'partly', 'Scofield', 'likable', 'protagonist', 'viewers', 'can', 'root', 'Actor', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'quirky', 'genius', 'enough', 'charm', 'thanks', 'unimposing', 'physicality', 'Miller', 'also', 'impenetrable', 'stoicism', 'endure', 'treacherous', 'often', 'masochistic', 'trials', 'reach', 'end', 'goal', 'two', 'episodes', 'clear', 'success', 'maybe', 'survival', 'it.Adding', 'stress', 'ruthless', 'Company', 'shadow', 'organization', 'Lincoln', 'fabricated', 'murder', 'not', 'only', 'aim', 'truncate', 'Scofield', 'plans', 'liberating', 'Lincoln', 'also', 'want', 'halt', 'investigation', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer/ex-girlfriend', 'Veronica', 'initiated', 'unearth', 'cover', 'up', 'framed', 'deeper', 'discover', 'ugly', 'truth', 'more', 'can', 'worms', 'subsequently', 'more', 'body', 'count', 'grows.PB', 'doubt', 'fairly', 'grim', 'nihilistic', 'show', 'violent', 'content', 'par', '24', 'most', 'squeamish', 'scenes', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'PB', 'drowns', 'hopelessness', 'plenty', 'humor', 'sprinkled', 'counterbalance', 'bleak', 'tone', 'Witnessing', 'step', 'Scofield', 'ingenious', 'plan', 'also', 'part', 'addictive', 'fun', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'dangerous', 'mess', 'crops', 'up.Any', 'potential', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'one', 'compromise', 'swallow', 'PB', 'preposterousness', 'True', 'speaking', 'primetime', 'TV', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'qualities', 'redundant', 'PB', ""'re"", 'willing', 'seriously', 'suspend', 'disbelief', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'screaming', 'WTF', 'somewhere', 'road', 'angrily', 'shutting', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'not', 'issue', ""'ll"", 'find', 'PB', 'season', 'one', 'be', 'exhilarating', 'tense', 'experience.Alas', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'frustrating', 'one', 'first', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'are', 'tightly', 'written', 'well', 'paced', 'latter', 'nine', 'feel', 'uneven', 'rushed', 'deluded', 'quality-killing', 'filler', 'sideplots', 'Also', 'point', 'Scofield', 'clever', 'actions', 'get', 'increasingly', 'asinine', 'plot', 'unprogressive', 'circles', ""Lost'-style"", 'flashback', 'episode', 'contrast', 'feels', 'hastily', 'constructed', 'crudely', 'focused', 'times', 'writers', 'had', 'stretch', 'material', 'thin', 'enough', 'fit', '22', 'episodes', 'instead', 'more', 'cohesive', '18.Luckily', 'supporting', 'cast', 'helped', 'PB', 'season', 'one', 'get', 'rough', 'patch', 'PB', 'central', 'prisoners', 'mob', 'boss', 'John', 'Abruzzi', 'white', 'supremacist/serial', 'rapist', 'T-Bag', 'seem', 'prison', 'genre', 'clich', 'eacute', 'first', 'respective', 'actors', 'flesh', 'out', 'predictable', 'archetype', 'same', 'security', 'guard', 'Brad', 'Bellick', 'who', 'kind', 'prick', 'anyone', 'would', 'loathe', 'mix', 'personalities', 'clashing', 'prison', 'claustrophobic', 'confines', 'exciting', 'banter', 'interconnected', 'conflicts', 'Company', 'end', 'Agent', 'Kellerman', 'frightening', 'physical', 'presence', 'organization', 'numerous', 'assassinations', 'prison', 'walls', 'just', 'as', 'creepy', 'Others', 'back', 'Lost', 'own', 'first', 'season.After', 'get', 'roller-coaster-ride', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'want', 'buy', 'other', 'Prison', 'Break', 'DVD', 'sets', 'honestly', 'tough', 'recommend', 'second', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'decent', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'are', 'unwatchable', 'train', 'wrecks', 'were', ""n't"", 'pre-planned', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'really', 'However', 'first', 'year', 'gem', 'most', 'other', 'primetime', 'shows', 'TV']",N/A

Then the show ended after season 5, my shows went on hiatus for the summer, and I wanted a show to watch. I have to say, I'm not only glad I picked this show, I'm glad I actually waited until now. The entire season is a seat grabber, with most episodes ending in some type of cliffhanger that makes you want to stay up until 3 am if you need to in order to keep going.My favorite character is Michael Scofield, who is like a modern day MacGuyver.

What if they do escape?  Or caught?""  Wentworth Miller plays Michael Scofield to perfection in his first major role.  Also, T-Bag plays the creepiest guy on television with his snaky Southern drawl and facial expressions.  I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley!  Abruzzi is also great as a Russian mobster (he was great in Armageddon!).  The characters are all well played and there is a perfect mix of characters you love to love and characters that you love to hate.

The prisoners seem to have pretty liberal use of the payphone.  I read somewhere that telephone calls from any prison or jail have to be made collect, by the prisoners.  Can you make a collect call to a cell phone?  Also, when the prisoners escaped, I don't believe that the prison guards would have been searching for them.  Wouldn't that have been done by local law enforcement, and maybe the FBI?  I don't think prison guards have any jurisdiction outside of the prison walls.  The actors are really, really good.

I was intrigued because usually after a 1st season this good, series tend to fall off because the writers hadn't banked on a hit.The premise of the show has been detailed perfectly by other reviewers so I'll just go on and add my 2 cents regarding what kept me drawn to this show:1) Wentworth Miller in a star making turn as ""Michael Scofield"" - loved his steely glares and the little smirk he'd get when his plans went off without a hitch2) Peter Stormare - his take on the Mafia Don was original (at times menacing and other times humorous)3) Robert Knepper - ""T-Bag"", one of the creepiest characters ever! Where is his Emmy???!4) The exceptional chemistry between the entire cast (with the exception of Robin Tunney)My two favorite scenes were:1) when the brothers initially meet in the prison chapel and Michael tells Linc that he's going to get him out and2) near the end of the riot - again the two brothers meet up and just the expression on Wentworth's face actually made me cry as he realizes the horror he unleashed and then sees his big brotherReally I know that if u live on the east coast right now the last thing u want to do is sit in front of a tv, especially since the weather has gotten so perfect but honestly, if u missed the chance to get hooked on this show when it initially aired, try to either view it or buy it.

991775,A319SKSB556033,B000FKO3GW,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[1, 2]","Prison Break was first broadcast in the UK on Channel Five. I was immediatly hooked, but since Channel Five aired it with the most ludicrous, unpredictable timetable I was never able to keep up with it. I've just recently came across this box set and I've watched every single episode in only 4 days. Prison Break should come with a warning, it's more addictive than crack.Not since The A-Team has there been such a purely male-oriented show. Girls can just pack their bags and leave, there's nothing for you here. Stick to your cooking and cleaning and pots and pans and frocks and gossip. You've had your share of prime-time TV in this post-feminist world, it's time to give something back. Having said that, Prison Break is pretty much the most far-fetched show you'll ever come across and requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief. If you can manage that, you'll have a great time.I won't really go into the plot so much since everybody in the world knows it. I'll just say 'innocent man on death row, epic plan to bust him free'. But we've all seen movies like this before, so what has PB got to offer? How about the most sprawling, complex conspiracy you could possibly imagine. Yes, it's contrived and sometimes desperate, but, like a Mack-Daddy Pimp with his prozzies, it'll keep you hooked and wants to be in control of you...or at least just your viewing habits.Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell (both born in England btw) play brothers, both trapped in the same prison. Micheal Schofield (Miller) has himself deliberately locked-up to free Lincoln Burrows (Purcell), who has been framed by the CIA. But he needs the help of fellow cons if all that is to happen. Such a large cast fill out a range of colorful characters. Cutie-pie Robin Tunney is the desperate lawyer trying to crack the case on the outside, seriously cool Peter Stormare is the sleazy mob boss who helps them all make the escape possible, Stacy Keach as the nice warden, big-chinned and perpetually frowning Amaury Nolasco as the likeable Sucre, Muse Watson as DB Cooper and the unfortunate Lane Garrison (now needing to plan his own Prison Break for real given recent circumstances) as the unpopular Tweener. But it's Robert Knepper who steals the whole show and runs away with it as the inbred, white-trash, murderous pedo Theodore (T-Bag) Bagwell. I've never seen any actor make such an evil, nasty man so damn likeable. I'm with T-Bag all the way...as long as it's not to his cell with a sheet hanging by the door.What I especially like about Schofield is that, like me, he 'suffers' from a high level of Dopamine buzzing around in his brain and is clinically diagnosed with 'low latent inhibition' which causes him to process higher amounts of visual stimuli and see things differently. Short and sweet, it means that it's hard to switch your brain off. But it's all normal to me and I was thrilled to see it be part of such a popular character.With the first half of Season 2 already available in the UK, I will be going straight for it tomorrow. I need to know...I need to know. Something that YOU will be saying at the end of every damn episode.For a show released on SD-DVD Prison Break looks absolutely incredible with a stunningly bright and crisp picture. The Dolby Digital sound is also pretty good and there are some extras included.",4,"Makes the A-Team look like a documentary, but it's damn intense viewing.",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,3327,"['Prison', 'Break', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'UK', 'Channel', 'Five', 'was', 'immediatly', 'hooked', 'Channel', 'Five', 'aired', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'unpredictable', 'timetable', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'keep', 'up', ""'ve"", 'just', 'recently', 'came', 'box', 'set', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'only', '4', 'days', 'Prison', 'Break', 'should', 'come', 'warning', 'more', 'addictive', 'crack.Not', 'A-Team', 'there', 'been', 'purely', 'male-oriented', 'show', 'Girls', 'can', 'just', 'pack', 'bags', 'leave', 'nothing', 'here', 'Stick', 'cooking', 'cleaning', 'pots', 'pans', 'frocks', 'gossip', ""'ve"", 'had', 'share', 'prime-time', 'TV', 'post-feminist', 'world', 'time', 'give', 'something', 'back', 'Having', 'said', 'Prison', 'Break', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'far-fetched', 'show', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'come', 'HUGE', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'can', 'manage', ""'ll"", 'have', 'great', 'time.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'plot', 'so', 'much', 'everybody', 'world', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', ""'innocent"", 'man', 'death', 'row', 'epic', 'plan', 'bust', 'free', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'before', 'what', 'PB', 'got', 'offer', 'How', 'most', 'sprawling', 'complex', 'conspiracy', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'Yes', 'contrived', 'sometimes', 'desperate', 'Mack-Daddy', 'Pimp', 'prozzies', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'hooked', 'be', 'control', 'least', 'just', 'viewing', 'habits.Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'born', 'England', 'btw', 'play', 'brothers', 'trapped', 'same', 'prison', 'Micheal', 'Schofield', 'Miller', 'deliberately', 'locked-up', 'free', 'Lincoln', 'Burrows', 'Purcell', 'who', 'been', 'framed', 'CIA', 'help', 'fellow', 'cons', 'happen', 'large', 'cast', 'fill', 'range', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Cutie-pie', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'desperate', 'lawyer', 'trying', 'crack', 'case', 'outside', 'seriously', 'cool', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'sleazy', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'make', 'escape', 'possible', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'nice', 'warden', 'big-chinned', 'perpetually', 'frowning', 'Amaury', 'Nolasco', 'likeable', 'Sucre', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'DB', 'Cooper', 'unfortunate', 'Lane', 'Garrison', 'now', 'needing', 'plan', 'own', 'Prison', 'Break', 'real', 'given', 'recent', 'circumstances', 'unpopular', 'Tweener', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'who', 'whole', 'show', 'away', 'inbred', 'white-trash', 'murderous', 'pedo', 'Theodore', 'T-Bag', 'Bagwell', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'make', 'such', 'evil', 'nasty', 'man', 'so', 'damn', 'likeable', ""'m"", 'T-Bag', 'way', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'cell', 'sheet', 'hanging', 'door.What', 'especially', 'like', 'Schofield', 'high', 'level', 'Dopamine', 'buzzing', 'around', 'brain', 'clinically', 'diagnosed', ""'low"", 'latent', 'inhibition', 'process', 'higher', 'amounts', 'visual', 'stimuli', 'see', 'things', 'differently', 'Short', 'sweet', 'hard', 'switch', 'brain', 'normal', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'be', 'part', 'popular', 'character.With', 'first', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'already', 'available', 'UK', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'straight', 'tomorrow', 'need', 'know', 'need', 'know', 'Something', 'YOU', 'will', 'be', 'saying', 'end', 'damn', 'show', 'released', 'SD-DVD', 'Prison', 'Break', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'stunningly', 'bright', 'crisp', 'picture', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'extras', 'included']",N/A

That, however, hardly even begins to cover what 'Prison Break' is all about.At heart, this is a character-driven saga of loyalty, backstabbing, friendship, romance, purity, corruption, and the limits of human persistence, with maybe even a bit of save-the-country-from-the-evil-empire eventually thrown in for good measure.Cliched? Possibly. Done right? Definitely.Welcome to Fox River State Penitentiary, where the audience meets a wonderfully-cast and well-imagined group of stone-faced inmates, dedicated guards, and an angelic-looking prison doctor. However, like the story itself, there's more to these characters than what's on the surface, and in that regard, everything's leading up to a little destination called ""Brother's Keeper,"" the flashback-centric Episode 16, which not only reveals the history behind all the hints, but also just how well-planned-out this story really is.In the meantime, the series takes us on quite a ride as we follow characters both inside the prison and out. Of the former, we get to know the target of the conspiracy, Michael's flawed-but-noble big brother Lincoln; the equally astray but good-natured Fernando Sucre; the despicable-but-sometimes-useful Theodore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell; the fallen soldier known as ""C-Note,"" who shares his real name with someone famous; the helpful older cowboy Charles Westmoreland; and the ever-popular (in real life) and still-powerful mob boss John Abruzi. Unbeknownst to Michael going in, all of these gentlemen, and others, will factor into his escape plan, and naturally require a place in it as well. Helping out on the outside is the ever-driven Veronica Donovan, a lawyer and longtime family friend (and sometimes romantic interest of Lincoln's) who, along with a partner and Lincoln's teenage son, is determined to hunt down the truth that can prove Lincoln's innocence, all while dodging efforts by conspirators to thwart them.'Prison Break' is a story about beating the odds, perhaps a metaphor in which the titular prison only serves as the initial prop. Even if the brothers escape, they'll still be confined by the conspiracy that's following their family around, and they -- and their allies -- will eventually have to unravel and strike back at it in this moving tale of endurance and determination.As the tagline goes, Escape is Just the Beginning, and with its complex plot, great drama, and enjoyable characters, this is a beginning that's well worth seeing.",5,As Good As You've Heard,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2599,"['now', 'probably', 'know', 'deal', 'structural', 'engineer', 'named', 'Michael', 'purposely', 'locked', 'up', 'attempt', 'break', 'out', 'innocent', 'brother', 'however', 'hardly', 'even', 'cover', 'what', ""'Prison"", 'Break', 'about.At', 'heart', 'character-driven', 'saga', 'loyalty', 'backstabbing', 'friendship', 'romance', 'purity', 'corruption', 'limits', 'human', 'persistence', 'maybe', 'even', 'bit', 'save-the-country-from-the-evil-empire', 'eventually', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.Cliched', 'Possibly', 'Done', 'right', 'Definitely.Welcome', 'Fox', 'River', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'where', 'audience', 'wonderfully-cast', 'well-imagined', 'group', 'stone-faced', 'inmates', 'dedicated', 'guards', 'angelic-looking', 'prison', 'doctor', 'However', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'what', 'surface', 'regard', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'little', 'destination', 'called', 'Brother', 'Keeper', 'flashback-centric', 'Episode', '16', 'not', 'only', 'history', 'hints', 'also', 'just', 'how', 'well-planned-out', 'story', 'really', 'meantime', 'series', 'ride', 'follow', 'characters', 'prison', 'former', 'get', 'know', 'target', 'conspiracy', 'Michael', 'flawed-but-noble', 'big', 'brother', 'Lincoln', 'equally', 'astray', 'good-natured', 'Fernando', 'Sucre', 'despicable-but-sometimes-useful', 'Theodore', 'T-Bag', 'Bagwell', 'fallen', 'soldier', 'known', 'C-Note', 'who', 'shares', 'real', 'name', 'someone', 'famous', 'helpful', 'older', 'cowboy', 'Charles', 'Westmoreland', 'ever-popular', 'real', 'life', 'still-powerful', 'mob', 'boss', 'John', 'Abruzi', 'Unbeknownst', 'Michael', 'going', 'gentlemen', 'others', 'will', 'factor', 'escape', 'plan', 'naturally', 'require', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'Helping', 'out', 'outside', 'ever-driven', 'Veronica', 'Donovan', 'lawyer', 'longtime', 'family', 'friend', 'sometimes', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Lincoln', 'who', 'partner', 'Lincoln', 'teenage', 'son', 'determined', 'hunt', 'down', 'truth', 'can', 'prove', 'Lincoln', 'innocence', 'dodging', 'efforts', 'conspirators', 'thwart', 'Break', 'story', 'beating', 'odds', 'perhaps', 'metaphor', 'titular', 'prison', 'only', 'initial', 'prop', 'Even', 'brothers', 'escape', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'confined', 'conspiracy', 'following', 'family', 'allies', 'will', 'eventually', 'have', 'unravel', 'strike', 'back', 'moving', 'tale', 'endurance', 'determination.As', 'tagline', 'Escape', 'Just', 'Beginning', 'complex', 'plot', 'great', 'drama', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'beginning', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
991779,A2QNS95WGN35G9,B000FKO3GW,Jason,"[21, 22]","Prison break is one of my favorite shows on TV.  I loved the show on first viewing, it was so raw, visceral, and so entertaining.  I could not see how the show could be as good as it is for 22 episodes, or how they could go forward with multiple seasons (the characters are amazing, and while watching the show, you just want more) but luckily for me, and everyone else, the show does go on, and gets even better in the subsequent seasons.  They are even planning a spin-off called Prison Break: Cherry Hill.If you never watched this show, it is structured similarly to 24, Lost, and Heroes.  Meaning, each episode is not self contained, but rather, continues on each episode, offering multiple storylines throughout the season.  Every episode ends with a cliffhanger, making it downright impossible to wait another week.  You will tear through this series in 2-3 days.  I really hope Fox will release season 2 on blu-ray soon, and announce their plans for 24 (it was supposed to be released around the same time as season 1 of prison break).Now on to the Blu-Ray particulars.The show was shot, and aired in high def.  I managed to watch these in high def (when the show aired, cable, nor sat offered HD locals, so we had to move the antenna all over the place to pick up fox, and move the antenna back, to watch cbs or some other station!).  With that said, these blu-ray dvds, look even better than I remember (Fox airs in 720p, or did back during this season).  The show looks very good, movie quality good.  It is presented in widescreen (not full screen, as the listing states).  Each disc contains 4 episodes, the last disc has 2.  You will notice no pixelation, nor any bad spots on the release.  This is one of the best looking blu-ray discs I own.  Blacks are black, contrast is high, there are no faults to be found in this blu-ray release.The sound is presented in DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround track (48kHz/24-bit).  The soundtrack is fantastic, you can hear everything. The sound effects are fantastic, you get a nice sense of depth, and it seems as though you can hear everything that is going on inside the prison.The only negative I can think of is season 2 has yet to be announced on blu-ray.  So now I have to buy season 2 on dvd, because I must watch season 2 again.

991783,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000FKO3GW,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[24, 28]","Prison Break is guilty pleasure TV wrapped in a an intelligent and creative package. But within the first twenty minutes when we find that Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) purposely robs a bank (firing his weapon inside the building to guarantee sentencing at a State Penitentiary) and then conveniently getting incarcerated at the same prison his brother is in, we can pretty much tell this show is going to be full of improbable scenarios that will become reality.In getting sent to the prison of his choice, Michael finds out quickly where his brother is and starts laying his groundwork from day one. He makes contacts with those who can help him move once they are on the other side of the wall. Time is short and Michael's brother, Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) is on death row soon to be executed for the murder of the Vice presidents brother. Although Lincoln was a petty criminal at times, Michael doesn't believe his brother murdered anyone and has exhausted his resources and considerable intelligence to find a way out of the prison. He even goes so far as to have the plans tattooed on his body (sounds ridiculous, although once you see it, you understand that it's the schematics hidden in a complex design).Lincoln is being framed for killing the Vice President's brother.  Lucky for him there are people outside the prison trying to exonerate him, including his ex-girlfriend. People are also dying outside the prison as well.  The death of the VP's brother is attached to a conspiracy that goes very high up, so as people start looking into the details they start dropping one by one.This show if FULL and I do mean `FULL' of manufactured drama. About 12 episodes into the series you'll be throwing your popcorn at the TV and screaming, `Oh, C'mon, that's ridiculous!'  This action will be followed by putting in the next DVD to find out what happens after the last cliffhanger.  By the time you stop buying the plot as anywhere NEAR realistic or relatable, you're caught up in the digital crack-pipe of addiction that moves this series along.  One thing that seems out of place in this show though is the level of character complexity.  This cast of misfits, and I'm including the people who are supposed to be normal, are endearing and pretty three-dimensional.

Dominic Purcell plays Lincoln Burrows who was wrongfully accused of a big murder. He's sentenced to death. Wentworth Miller plays his brother Michael who gets himself put in the same prison by staging a bank robbery. There he plans on breaking him out before he can be executed. He has the whole way out planned through a tattoo of the prison that he has all over his body.While Robin Tunney plays a lawyer close to both brothers who plans on getting Lincoln out legally by proving his innocence. Peter Stormare is excellent as John Abruzzi who has power inside the prison and who Michael who will have to work with if he wants to get his brother out. He figures his strong influence in the prison will be a help. Wade Williams is also really good as the Captain of the prison guards. You can easily see why no one there would want to mess with him.While Robert Knepper as a slimy inmate nicknamed T-Bag probably deserves some sort of nomination for his work this season. He's the kind of guy you love to hate yet you're interested to see what he'll do next. Michael doesn't want to bring him with them but T-Bag always finds a way to make sure he's part of them breaking out.NBC had big plans for Surface and they canceled that and ABC canceled Invasion which was supposed to be their new big hit as well. So that shows that Prison Break is no doubt the best new show. There were too many other shows that tried to follow Lost's success and be like it and failed. Prison Break succeeds due to being it's own show with it's own clever ideas. Although there is one episode where it has Lost type flashbacks of each character I admit. That was a good episode and one of the best though since we learn things about the characters that we didn't know already.

I think a lot of the power of the show comes from the two main actors (Dominic and Wentworth) who portray brothers as well as the actress who plays the romantic lead as the doctor.It might be popular because the two main actors are easy on the eyes, but the psychological dimensions of the main character (Wentworth) keeps you interested. Schofield sacrifices his own freedom to get into the same prison as his brother who is on death row, to try to break him out before he is killed in the electric chair for a crime he was set up for.All the conspiracy story part of the show starts to fall flat toward the end, but the tension and drama within the prison walls and among the inmates keeps escalating with the prisoners playing off one another; jostling for power positions in the group while all juggling their own personal issues and lives. The friction among the core group trying to retain their right to be on the escape team also keeps you on edge. It is Schofield's knowledge, the MacGyver of the prison world, his cunning and determination that makes you want to keep watchng each episode to find out what he will do next and how he will get himself out of each obstacle and predicament that gets in his way.The only dissapointment is in the final episode which turns out to be just a preview for the next series- it would have been nice for a bit more action or progress in the story. Instead, the last episode just seems to be stalling the story and wasting time, what a shame. I think the middle of the series is the most exciting when he gets a psycho roomate and then what happens in the midst of the prison lock down.I think the next series has a lot to live up to- how can they draw out this story for a whole new series when Lincoln only has hours to go till his execution?",4,A great series until the last one,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1975,"['Prison', 'Break', 'not', 'series', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'OZ', 'most', 'other', 'prison', 'movies', 'tv', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'something', 'gripping', 'series', 'think', 'lot', 'power', 'show', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Dominic', 'Wentworth', 'who', 'portray', 'brothers', 'as', 'well', 'actress', 'who', 'romantic', 'lead', 'doctor.It', 'might', 'be', 'popular', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'easy', 'eyes', 'psychological', 'dimensions', 'main', 'character', 'Wentworth', 'interested', 'Schofield', 'own', 'freedom', 'get', 'same', 'prison', 'brother', 'who', 'death', 'row', 'try', 'break', 'out', 'killed', 'electric', 'chair', 'crime', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'part', 'show', 'fall', 'flat', 'end', 'tension', 'drama', 'prison', 'walls', 'inmates', 'escalating', 'prisoners', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'jostling', 'power', 'positions', 'group', 'juggling', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'lives', 'friction', 'core', 'group', 'trying', 'retain', 'right', 'be', 'escape', 'team', 'also', 'edge', 'Schofield', 'knowledge', 'MacGyver', 'prison', 'world', 'cunning', 'determination', 'want', 'keep', 'watchng', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'how', 'will', 'get', 'obstacle', 'predicament', 'way.The', 'only', 'dissapointment', 'final', 'episode', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'preview', 'next', 'series-', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'progress', 'story', 'Instead', 'last', 'episode', 'just', 'be', 'stalling', 'story', 'wasting', 'time', 'what', 'shame', 'think', 'middle', 'series', 'most', 'exciting', 'when', 'psycho', 'roomate', 'then', 'what', 'midst', 'prison', 'lock', 'down.I', 'think', 'next', 'series', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'to-', 'how', 'can', 'draw', 'out', 'story', 'whole', 'new', 'series', 'when', 'Lincoln', 'only', 'hours', 'go', 'till', 'execution']",N/A

991792,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000FKO3GW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","""Prison Break"" was a show that started up on the Fox network last year and started a sensation. It attracted millons of viewers, got good review from critics, and now the complete first season is available on DVD. The story line (I mean, in case you didn't know) involves Michael Scofield's (Wentworth Miller, 'The Human Stain') plan to get his brother Lincoln Burroughs (Dominic Purcell, '3-Way') out of the Fox River Penetentary. Lincoln apparently killed the Vice President's brother, all the evidence seems to say he did...But turns out there's something much bigger going on; As Lincoln'slawyer/former girlfriend Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney), with the help of Nick a dude from Project Justice, tries to figure out who framed Lincoln;Michael works hard on the inside to get his brother out. Being a structural engineer, Michael has access to the blueprints and has them tattooed on his body...But he's going to need to take some chances to get out. And he needs some people to help him to get out; The people include John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare, who's great), a mobster with access to a jet; Charles, a guy Michael thinks is D.B. Cooper; Sucre, Michael's cell-mate and kind of the comedic part of the show; T-Bag (Robert Knepper, who's incredible), a pedophile who stumbles onto Michael's plan; C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), a former Army guy, who needs to get with his family on the outside (he's got them thinking he's in Iraq); Tweener (Lane Garrison), a snitch who's hired by a suspicious prison guard named Bellick (Wade Williams) to find out what Scofield's up to. One complaint I hear the most about the show is that it's unbelievable. Prison isn't like that. And it's not just because of Michael's escape, most people complain that the lack of realism is due to T-Bag;T-Bag, as I said, is a pedophile who is one of the people that basically runs the prison; Nobody screws with T-Bag. In prison, a pedophile wouldn't be running anything. The soap cell-phone was another complaint I heard, but listen to this though. If we looked for pure realism in everything we watched, we wouldn't enjoy a lot of movies. That's like saying, I turned off ""The Lord of the Rings"" right from the beginning because there's no such thing as a hobbit. The show is exciting, entertaining, and interesting...It makes sense, most of the time (the soap cell-phone was kind of...Unbelievable). All the actors are absolutely amazing; Robert Knepper quite literally does some acting that could easily pull him an Oscar nomination, had this show been a movie or something. He's absolutely incredible. Wentworth Miller is perfect as Scofield; You can believe that he's a college graduate (in real life he is) and you can believe his plan for the most part. All the other actors I mentioned above are good, other stand outs are Stacy Keach as Warden Pope and Sarah Wayne-Callies as Sarah Tancredi, the doctor of the prison. Anyway, here's an overview of all the episodes and some opinions of mine. Bottom line is, if you like tense, exciting, well-acted, well-written, and thought-provoking shows. Check this one out:1. Pilot-This Brett Ratner directed episode is exactly what a pilot should be. It holds your attention firmly in its grasp and leaves you wanting more.2. Allen-A tense, exciting episode. Riots and toe clipping are among the things that occur in this episode.3. Cell Test-This is a show where every episode is better than the last one. This episode has some twists and progresses nicely.4. Cute Poison-I love this episode. The dialogue (especially between Sucre and his girlfriend) is great; The cliffhanger at the end of the episode is very nervewracking. The only thing this episode suffers from is a poorly edited ""Previously on Prison Break"" montage.5. English, Fitz, or Percy-Tense, sometimes funny, but with a predictable twist at the end. Ignoring the latter, a fine episode.6. Riots, Drills, and The Devil (Part 1)-I've seen all these episodes and know what happens in the end; But this episode is still extremely exciting and suspenceful. It doesn't get much better than this.7. Riots, Drills, and The Devil (Part 2)-Just as good as the previous episode. The chemistry between Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and Sarah, the doctor is absolutely perfect.8. The Old Head-The ""big twist"" is revealed in this episode. This episode isn't as good as the last two, but this one is more about setting up the next episodes then it is about actually doing anything.9. Tweener-The title refers to a new important character in the series. Frankly, I find this character annoying...But that's the point and he is a good actor. I like this episode anyway, though.10. Sleight of Hand-There's some unnessary ""decieve the audience"" moments, but it's good nonetheless.11. And Then There Were 7-An exciting episode; A lot of unreal stuff happens, but...Yeah, very cool.12. Odd Man Out-A nervewracking ending. Several twists are piled into this episode.13. End of the Tunnel-When I saw this when it first aired, this was supposed to be the ""Breakout Episode."" I knew something was up when there was only 5 minutes left and they hadn't made it. This is an awesome episode though, the 4 month wait after it for new episodes sucked though. Their is a bulls**t moment, however...The pipe is replaced way too quick.14. The Rat-The title is of course a double entendre; This episode is only meant to further the series, it's good...But it's one of those episodes when you first see it, you're disappointed.15. By the Skin and the Teeth-This episode has genuinely funny moments. Like ""The Donkey""and ""Who's Matlock?"" It also has a cool twist towards the end. A fine episode.16. Brother's Keeper-This episode is a bunch of flashbacks revealing how the future-escapees ended up in Fox River. The Sucre one is funny, the T-Bag one is realistic; This episode isn't completely necessary, but enjoyable.17. J Cat-This is an awesome episode. It's hilarious, kinda sad, and entertaining at the same time.18. Bluff-This episode has it's good moments and it's dull ones, but the good ones make up for that...The ending is very good.19. The Key-A ""key"" character returns to the show, you start to hate Tweener a little bit more, and they end the show with one of the biggest cliff-hangers yet.20. Tonight-I like this one, but it's one of those episodes that just builds and builds. But the tension is existent, so...Yeah, it's good.21. Go-This is one of the most exciting episodes I've ever seen of any TV show. Totally gets your heart racing.22. Flight-""We run."" It seems kind of unbelievable, the situation their thrown in towards the end; But, it's still good.GRADE: ANew Season Begins August 21 at 8 on Fox",5,Awesome,1156032000,"08 20,

The slick professionalism of the Brett Ratner episode hooked me in, and I backed it up to episode 2, and by three I was pretty much a prisoner myself, of my own couch.  I called out for pizza and friends from time to time, but outside of that, there I was for the whole weekend watching all 22 shows.It was the same way with 24's first season, but this was better, for you didn't notice a letdown after the first 13 like you did with 24.  Instead the show became richer and more manifold.  You know what episode convinced me that it wasn't just fun junkj?  The one I would ordinarily hate, where the script takes you back to before the opening, into a series of delicately layered flashbacks that tell us why each of the characters has been doing what he's been doing since show one--and each one revealed a knock out surprise, from Dr Sara to T-Bag.  You could hardly keep up with the wave of reveal the producers seemed to have squandered on this one episode!To tell the truth, nothing in the remainder of the season was as much of a thrill, even the big super-hyped break itself.  I can't imagine what people did who were forced to watch the show with seven days between each new fix--and I guess, the gap between shows 13 and 14 was a matter of 6 months!  I would have eaten the TV out of sheer impatience.The guys on the show are pretty great, but I should say a word for the girls, the woman who plays Sara is such a good actress, she almost makes you believe in her character's preposterous arc; Robin Tunney as a brilliant defense attorney (and Dominic Purcell's love interest)--well, I never liked her before in anything, but her scenes in death row brought tears to my eyes; and what a waste, producers, you had Holly Valance on board as Michael's green card bride and you didn't even let the fantastically talented young lady sing one song?

It isn't even a question of whether his brother is innocent--Michael knows and believes he is innocent and risks his own future to save it. Hatching an elaborate escape plan using the blueprints of his brother's prison, Michael plots their escape and is not willing to wait for justice to take its course and clear his brother's name. Along the way they meet some colorful prison characters, including a pedophile with a penchant for pretty boys, a dishonorably discharged soldier whose wife still thinks he's in Iraq, a linked-up mobster who is critical to the escape plan, and an old-timer who might have $1 million hidden on the outside.This is a show filled with conspiracy theories, and with twists and turns around every corner that keep you guessing the whole way through. I wasn't sure if this show was for me, but I heard so many great things about Prison Break, I just had to check it out for myself. And I wasn't disappointed. Prison Break is action packed and exciting the whole way through. It's definitely a show that you won't want to stop watching once you put it on, and I'd highly recommend it to the same sort of viewers who enjoy shows like Oz and Lost.

Full of thrills and twists and everything in between, Prison Break gets you in right at the start when we see Michael Scofield hold up a bank (without the intention of harming anyone).  He goes to trial and when sentenced, he chooses the prison that we later find out his brother is in.  Prior to all of this we see him getting the final tatoo on his completely tatooed body - the escape route of the prison.Each and every week, it gets more complex and you are hooked further and further into the plot to escape.  You find out that there was external forces that put Michaels brother into prison (he was set up) and you see how those people will do anything to prevent Lincoln's lawyers from saving him from his impending execution.  At the end of most episodes, you begin to think that the following week there will be no way for the inmates to get out, but you are surprised each time.  And what show would be complete without a little romance?  We see Michael falling in love with the female prison Dr who had also been slowly falling for him too.There are too many intricate storylines and twists to keep going into too much detail without giving away the final outcome, but you absolutely have to see this.

While viewers and reviewers were ranting about 24, Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives, this show slipped completely under the radar.Tragic for those who missed it, but a real find for those who caught it.  This show had me entranced and, literally, on the edge of my seat, from the very beginning and I didn't, couldn't, wouldn't let myself, miss an episode.Prison Break is a masterpiece of suspense (Yeah, I said it, a masterpiece).  Not only did every episode conclude with a cliffhanger that made you feel like you were facing the longest seven days of your life before you could find out what happens, but even the commercial breaks were torture.  Absolutely none of the cliche' and predictability of most network television (including the series mentioned above).Prison Break is so brilliantly crafted that, by the 15th or 16th episode, I actually found myself wishing for just one predictable turn, for just one thing to happen the way I guessed it might.  Fortunately, it didn't happen.  Every time I thought I knew what was coming, thought it was even obvious what would happen next, I was way off, and never so delighted to be wrong in my life.You might wonder how a prison show would play out on network television with no room for vulgarity, hard-core violence or other elements of an action series set in a maximum security prison.  But the script is well crafted enough that you truly don't notice the lack of expletives that should be commonplace in such a setting, even a fictional one.Who are these writers? Where have they been? and Why have they not been hired to write every show on television?The acting is decent but, with the exception of Wentworth Miller as Michael and Robert Knepper as T-bag, not great. It doesn't matter though, because the story and script is so good, I'd watch it if a team of farm animals were acting it out.  Maybe next season.In closing, Prison Break is the most engaging, suspenseful series on network television and one of the best shows on network or cable television.Fair warning to those who watch it on DVD for the first time - When you sit down to watch the first episode, you may want to plan for a 22 hour marathon, because once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.",5,The best network show in ages . . .,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,2342,"['mystery', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'was', 'running', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'were', 'ranting', 'about', '24', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'show', 'slipped', 'completely', 'radar.Tragic', 'who', 'missed', 'real', 'find', 'who', 'caught', 'show', 'had', 'entranced', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'miss', 'episode.Prison', 'Break', 'masterpiece', 'suspense', 'Yeah', 'said', 'masterpiece', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'episode', 'conclude', 'cliffhanger', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'facing', 'longest', 'seven', 'days', 'life', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'even', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'were', 'torture', 'Absolutely', 'none', 'cliche', 'predictability', 'most', 'network', 'television', 'including', 'series', 'mentioned', '.Prison', 'Break', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', '15th', '16th', 'episode', 'actually', 'found', 'wishing', 'just', 'one', 'predictable', 'turn', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'happen', 'way', 'guessed', 'might', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'time', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'thought', 'was', 'even', 'obvious', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'was', 'way', 'never', 'so', 'delighted', 'be', 'wrong', 'life.You', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'prison', 'show', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'network', 'television', 'room', 'vulgarity', 'hard-core', 'violence', 'other', 'elements', 'action', 'series', 'set', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'script', 'well', 'crafted', 'enough', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'lack', 'expletives', 'should', 'be', 'commonplace', 'such', 'setting', 'even', 'fictional', 'one.Who', 'are', 'writers', 'Where', 'have', 'been', 'Why', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'hired', 'write', 'show', 'television', 'acting', 'decent', 'exception', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Michael', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'T-bag', 'not', 'great', ""n't"", 'matter', 'though', 'story', 'script', 'so', 'good', ""'d"", 'watch', 'team', 'farm', 'animals', 'were', 'acting', 'out', 'Maybe', 'next', 'season.In', 'closing', 'Prison', 'Break', 'most', 'engaging', 'suspenseful', 'series', 'network', 'television', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'network', 'cable', 'television.Fair', 'warning', 'who', 'watch', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'When', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'may', 'want', 'plan', '22', 'hour', 'marathon', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stop']",N/A

The storyline is always engaging and it is hard to stop watching after an episode is over. They almost always end on a cliffhanger much like LOST.

Let's see: Point Pleasent, Firefly, Space: Above & Beyond, Harsh Realm, etc., but thankfully, Prison Break attracted a large audience, and was given the time to grow to become something really special.  The series begins with engineer Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller in a star making role) purposely getting imprisoned in a prison that he designed in an effort to break out his wrongfully convicted brother Lincoln (Blade: Trinity's Dominic Purcell) who is sitting on Death Row after being framed for murdering the Vice President's brother.  As Michael allies himself with various prisoners (including the always great Peter Storemare, whose turn as mob boss John Abruzzi is a season highlight) who have their own intentions, it becomes a race against time for Michael and Lincoln, as well as Lincoln's ex-girlfriend Veronica (Robin Tunney) who is on the verge of uncovering the stretching conspiracy that has everyone tangled in it's web.  As the season comes to an end, it's more than apparent what's going to happen, and you'll be salivating to see what happens next.

991810,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B000FKO3GW,Negative Comments,"[6, 7]","Season 1 was the single greatest thing I have seen with my eyes. I don't mean just TV or movies, I mean just anything in general with my eyes. I literally could not wait until the next nano-second of this exciting show, LET ALONE the next episode. Season 2 was almost just as good up until EXACTLY episode 19, that's where it all went down hill. Then came Season 3...Let's just say this, me, of all people, actually STOPPED WATCHING THE SHOW. I literally used to turn off my cell phone, and NOT ANSWER THE DOOR whenever Prison Break was on. I've also rewatched Season 1's DVD a double digit number of times (and also Season 2, at least until it stopped being good). That's how much of a fan I was. I bought the magazine, had the wallpaper, and even made my own custom Prison Break RINGTONE.And now I don't even watch this show...Here's how they ruined it for whatever reason: Beginning with episode 19 of Season 2, it was becoming clear that everything that had been so meticulously crafted by the writers in the previous episodes and season, was becoming completely UNDERMINED by the new direction of this show at this stage. Everything that had been built up was being carelessly written away in exchange for overextending the plot. So things that were once key (the money, the president's brother, the tape recording, the PRESIDENT) was just completely wiped out of existence, and this disenfranchised many people.We had been on this great roller coaster ride, seeing the character arcs of people coming to a climax, as well as the story, where everything that had been invested could finally have its exciting, explosive payoff. What did they do? Well, instead of writing the ENDING to the great BEGINNING and middle that they had carefully written, here's what they did, here's an analogy:Let's say there was a painter who had been working on this great painting over the course of several weeks. Each time he made progress, he invited the public to come see his latest version of his painting, and the crowd would love it and go home happy, they were also anticipating how this great painting would turn out. Then comes a day when he finally announces that he's now put the FINAL TOUCHES to his grand masterpiece of perfection, and will unveil the finished product to the public. All the adoring fans show up and can't wait to see it. He then says: ""Oh by the way, look at this great new painting I started!""Audience: ""That looks pretty good, but can we see the finished version of your other painting, you know, the one we've been coming to see for weeks now, some of us traveling distant miles?""Painter: ""Oh, about that, I actually went ahead and started my new painting on the SAME CANVAS as my old painting, so I kinda painted OVER it.""Audience: (*grabs shotgun*)That painter should've finished the painting he started, not undermine his work in exchange for the cheap ploy of beginning a new project in hopes of keeping the admirers coming back. Now you're left with nothing; the masterpiece that you once had is now covered up by this complete piece of absolute crap.Random complaining points:--Remember what they said about Season 3 before it started? Remember how they said Sona would be such a terrifyingly creepy place, a place that would resemble a pit of eternal doom? That place is a JOKE.--Remember how in the off season they were saying things like ""the show will be completely reinvented, it will take on a very very new tone and direction that we haven't seen before."" Right, that's why Scofield's back in prison and trying to break out AGAIN.--Every single character this season is PAPER THIN. Remember the once great characters of the past, who were realistic, living, breathing people with motivations (Westmoreland, Abruzzi, Tweener). Remember when people like Sucre, T-Bag, Mahone, and Bellick were actually INTERESTING? Now they're nothing more than shallow caricatures of their past, who serve absolutely NO PURPOSE.--C-Note is the only character in this show that had an extended story and still had a proper character arc and closing (so the people that died are excluded, because as much was we hated to see them go, that was in fact their closing, and it left a profound effect). With this same idea in mind, T-Bag could've gone down as an all-time favorite had he 1) got killed after his storyline with the Hollanders, 2) got arrested after his storyline with the Hollanders, or 3) had a semi-redeeming moment as a bit of a sympathetic character after his storyline with... the Hollanders. There's nothing wrong with *keeping a character in and of itself, it's when you keep a character, where the plot calls for them to have no USE, that's when you start to tarnish who they are. Now these once great characters are desaturated, diluted, hollow shadows of their former selves. It's really really sad to see.--This is the single biggest disappointing moment of 2007 for me, with Spider-Man 3 and the 2nd season Heroes being right behind.Season 1 = 10/10.

By the end of the final disc you'll ask yourself why you ever found the premise silly to begin with.I really didn't want to watch PRISON BREAK when I first heard about it.  After, the whole premise is a bit silly, and even the cast members and producers sometimes snicker about aspects of it.  A guy tattoos the blueprints of a prison onto his body in order to break his brother out after he gets himself thrown in for committing a felony?  It just seemed too farfetched and absurd.  What changed my mind?  Two things.  First, a number of fans and critics who stated that they, too, found the premise absurd.  Secondly, person after person and critic after critic stated that it was one of the most entertaining shows on TV.  Besides, my all time favorite TV show is about a sixteen year old California cheerleader who discovers that she has been called to be her generation's vampire slayer.  I figured that if a show as great as BUFFY could start off with a silly premise and end up with something that was truly great, so could PRISON BREAK.Speaking of BUFFY and PRISON BREAK, the two shows had many overlaps.  The person who green lighted PRISON BREAK was Gail Berman, the person who first had the idea of turning BUFFY into a TV series.  One of the executive producers for the new show was Marti Noxon, who wrote for BUFFY and was the show runner in its last two seasons.  The show's star, Wentworth Miller, was the main guest star in a late Season Two episode of BUFFY (albeit one of the few weak episodes in a string of episodes that are largely masterpieces) entitled ""Go Fish,"" playing the star of the swim team.  Wade Williams, who plays Bellick, had a small but memorable role as the general of a Knights Templar-like group of knights.The two immediate influences on PRISON BREAK are 24 and LOST, especially the former.  Like 24, the show strives to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat and end each episode with a cliffhanging ending.  Like 24 and LOST, the show is concerned to tell an ongoing story with no one episode especially self-contained.  Like LOST, there often turn out to be more interrelations between the characters than one might initially suppose and like LOST often tries to plumb the causes of present events by flashing back to the past.But any show could emulate 24 and LOST.  The challenge is to do it well.  The only eal negative about this show is the initial premise.  Luckily this is an extremely well written show.  The writers have a genius for creating one dilemma after another that seems to have no resolution, only to have our hero miraculously extricate himself and his plans each week.  It is a wonderful experiment in grand storytelling, with heartbreaks, surprises, and so much excitement that sometimes it gets a little too exciting.  I promise that from first to last this show will present you with a string of adrenaline rushes.Apart from the writing, the other thing that really makes this show work is the cast, which brings together as many first rate character actors as any show on TV.  Wentworth Miller is absolutely outstanding as Michael Scofield, an absolutely brilliant structural engineer who is intent on helping his brother escape from prison.  Dominic Purcell does a wonderful job in the difficult role of Michael's brother Lincoln Burrows, who is awaiting execution for the murder of the vice president's brother, but who was framed in a elaborate conspiracy.  Much of the rest of the cast is filled with scene-stealers of the first rank.  Veteran actor Peter Stomare (perhaps best known for stuffing Steve Buscemi's leg down a wood chipper in FARGO) is wonderfully threatening and insane as mobster John Abruzzi.  Even more memorable is Robert Knepper, who plays animalistic pansexual molester and murderer Theodore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell.  The aforementioned Wade Williams is marvelous as the crooked and brutal guard Bellick, while Stacy Keach is the admirable and highly principled warden Henry Pope.  The show's main romantic interest revolves around the flirtation and chemistry between Scofield and the prison doctor Sara Tancredi, played by the red-haired Sarah Wayne Callies.  There are many other marvelous performers, though in particular I would like to mention Silas Weir Mitchell, who played the utterly psychotic Haywire.  I'm not sure that any actor today plays a more convincing insane person than Mitchell.I personally believe that in the past ten years TV has become for the most part a higher form of entertainment than the movies.  Certainly there are far more hours of high quality TV produced than high quality film.  PRISON BREAK is further evidence of this.  There has been on and off debate about when the Golden Age of television was, but personally I think it started in the 1990s and continues to today, with shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE SOPRANOS, SIX FEET UNDER, FARSCAPE, THE WEST WING, THE GILMORE GIRLS, 24, ANGEL, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, SCRUBS, DEAD LIKE ME, THE SHIELD, BATTLESTAR GALATICA, LOST, and VERONICA MARS.  The only problem today is finding time to watch all of the truly worth TV series.  I certainly would encourage anyone interested in quality entertainment trying to find time for this enormously entertaining show.",5,An enormously entertaining serial drama of the first

991821,A1ZH52JAC70RIR,B000FKO3GW,Robin Benson,"[0, 0]","Having just sat through the sixteen hours of this first Break (over five days though) I'm pleased to see that the overall impression of Amazon customers is that this is a winner and rightly so.  The story is most likely known to you considering how much PR this first season generated.  I was very impressed by the way the writers consistently came up with credible twists and turns and I particularly like the secondary story of the government political intrigue which took the action outside the confines of the prison.A couple of points occurred to me while watching the episodes.  The forty minute length of each part meant that twenty-one cliffhangers had to be created to pull the viewers into next week's show.  This creates some rather artificial plotting situations which could have been avoided if the length was longer but that is one of the problems of network TV being ad supported.  The other point is more critical and goes to the authenticity of Prison Break.  Because it was a network show there is a complete absence of swearing.  Prisons by their nature are probably the most aggressive male environments around and to have bored and desperate convicts not expressing themselves in the only way they know how seems to lack credibility.  More so for poorly paid guards, who in the program, lose no opportunity to express their disdain and frustration for their charges but express this in dialog that has to be acceptable to Middle America.  Had the show been on HBO or Showtime I feel the writers would have created dialog with more strength which would have given Prison Break an extra layer of realism.The last disc has some worthwhile extras: a thirty minute Making of...feature that tends to be the usual back-slapping stuff from the principal actors and creative team but did have some interesting material about shooting scenes in Joliet.  A fascinating sixteen minute feature about creating the tattoo that covered Wentworth Miller's body: about two hundred hours of work and $15,000 to $20,000 if it was for real.  A short about the history of Joliet (closed in 2002) and now part of the Illinois Film Office property inventory.Despite the constraints of the show being on network TV this is well worth seeing and I know I'll be watching it more than once plus there is the supreme luxury of seeing it ad free!",5,"Brilliant, though with inherent limitations",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,2337,"['Having', 'just', 'sat', 'sixteen', 'hours', 'first', 'Break', 'five', 'days', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'see', 'overall', 'impression', 'Amazon', 'customers', 'winner', 'rightly', 'so', 'story', 'most', 'likely', 'known', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'PR', 'first', 'season', 'generated', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'way', 'writers', 'consistently', 'came', 'up', 'credible', 'twists', 'turns', 'particularly', 'secondary', 'story', 'government', 'political', 'intrigue', 'took', 'action', 'confines', 'prison.A', 'couple', 'points', 'occurred', 'watching', 'episodes', 'forty', 'minute', 'length', 'part', 'meant', 'twenty-one', 'cliffhangers', 'had', 'be', 'created', 'pull', 'viewers', 'next', 'week', 'show', 'rather', 'artificial', 'plotting', 'situations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'length', 'was', 'longer', 'one', 'problems', 'network', 'TV', 'being', 'ad', 'supported', 'other', 'point', 'more', 'critical', 'authenticity', 'Prison', 'Break', 'was', 'network', 'show', 'complete', 'absence', 'swearing', 'Prisons', 'nature', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'aggressive', 'male', 'environments', 'have', 'bored', 'desperate', 'convicts', 'not', 'expressing', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'lack', 'credibility', 'More', 'so', 'poorly', 'paid', 'guards', 'who', 'program', 'lose', 'opportunity', 'express', 'disdain', 'frustration', 'charges', 'express', 'dialog', 'be', 'acceptable', 'Middle', 'America', 'Had', 'show', 'been', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'feel', 'writers', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'dialog', 'more', 'strength', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Prison', 'Break', 'extra', 'layer', 'realism.The', 'last', 'disc', 'worthwhile', 'extras', 'thirty', 'minute', 'Making', 'feature', 'be', 'usual', 'back-slapping', 'stuff', 'principal', 'actors', 'creative', 'team', 'did', 'have', 'interesting', 'material', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'Joliet', 'A', 'fascinating', 'sixteen', 'minute', 'feature', 'creating', 'tattoo', 'covered', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'body', 'about', 'two', 'hundred', 'hours', 'work', '15,000', '20,000', 'was', 'real', 'short', 'history', 'Joliet', 'closed', '2002', 'now', 'part', 'Illinois', 'Film', 'Office', 'property', 'inventory.Despite', 'constraints', 'show', 'being', 'network', 'TV', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'supreme', 'luxury', 'seeing', 'ad', 'free']",N/A

The standout character is also the most despicable: Bagwell. He is so debased but it is hard to not feel sympathy for what he could have been. Robert Knepper didn't get nearly the acclaim he deserved handling such a complex and despicable character.The problem with the show is that it feels like it was written week to week without a overarching view of getting from point A to B, serious plot holes(is a spoiler notice necessary?):1. Scofield is far smarter than Veronica, but she figured out the big mystery faster than Scofield. Why didn't he ask for her help earlier?2. The conspiracy that landed Lincoln on death row is too farfetched. It destroys much of the credibility of the series. Why even frame anyone? Just fake the murder and allow it to go unsolved. That keeps the fraud a secret and gives his sister even more sympathy.3. I understand the reasoning for the elaborate tattoo, but putting down the three roads that go past the prison was stretching it. The guards took photos of them, one of them should have figured it out. Secondly, Scofield couldn't remember it?4. Pinning so much of his plan on Abuzzi's ability to get him a plane while not retaliating for the blackmail, shows little intelligence.5. The pointless almost execution and last minute reprieve was uneeded. It added nothing but prison cliche.6. There is a reason death-row inmates are kept separate. No matter how kind the warden is, he would never be allowed such a breach of security.7. On the night of the real escape, how did Scofield set off the alarm in the psych ward without entering it? That made the whole sneaking in above ground pointless.8. They could have easily tied up T-bag in the tunnels with Bellick, but of course that would have eliminated some of the best story lines of seasons 2-4.9. The tunnel between the psych ward and the infirmary was a pointless rerouting. They already had a way into the infirmary, albeit a floor below what they needed, but going through the tunnels was no better or easier. This is the plot point that just destroys the entire first season.There are a bunch of smaller bits of brain-damage but these are the major inconsistencies.Taking in the entire series, the show is really about redemption and how some earn it, some never can and some just get it despite their misdeeds.If you can overlook the massive amount of flaws that each season contains, it is an otherwise enjoyable series, due to the interaction between the characters, that is worth watching.

Turns out the man has a quirky genius for a brother, as well as an attorney ex-girlfriend who are willing to risk their lives in order to save him, because, of course, he is innocent.

Each episode has it's own specific title and sort of plays in to the puzzle that Michael Scofield tries to put together in order to bust himself and his brother out of prison.With a wide variety of characters in the 1st season, Prison Break is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish with unbelievable plot twists and endings.  The cat and mouse game never seems to let up as the cons usually end up eluding the police after every episode.  But above it all the characters are great!  From ruthless characters like John Abruzzi the mob boss, to the murderous pedophile in Thedore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell, the abusive and corrupt prison guard in Brad Belick, and of course the incredible mind of Michael Scofield and his strong-willed brother, Lincoln Burrows.  And before I forget, the loveable character of Sucre who plays Michael's cellmate.  With his memorable one-liners, Sucre wants no part of the escape plan at first.  However, no man in their right mind would want to sit in jail with a beautiful girlfriend as his just waiting for him on the outside.  You're a lucky man, Sucre.  A lucky man.Parts of the show is of course not believable and frankly impossible, but we have to remind ourselves that this is Hollywood and anything is possible and quite exciting.  After just watching season 2 end just a few months ago, it's easy to say that Season 1 has so far been the better of the 2.  Season 2 was a bit of a stretch to the imagination and the ending just leaves everyone wondering what exactly is the ""master-plan"" for Michael.  However, as many other TV dramas tend to do from season to season, none of the major characters were killed off or taken away at the end of season 2 which is great.  Fox has put out two great winners in 24 and Prison Break and it should be an interesting Fall schedule ahead to see how they come back.",5,It's all about T-Bag baby,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2151,"['READ', 'THIS', 'CAREFULLY', 'only', 'problem', 'show', 'not', 'enough', 'T-Bag', 'know', 'show', 'DVD', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'perfectly', 'excellent', 'format', 'include', 'variety', 'extras', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'are', 'sure', 'excite', 'most', 'die-hard', 'Prison', 'Break', 'fans', 'episode', 'own', 'specific', 'title', 'sort', 'plays', 'puzzle', 'Michael', 'Scofield', 'put', 'together', 'order', 'bust', 'brother', 'prison.With', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', '1st', 'season', 'Prison', 'Break', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'twists', 'endings', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'cons', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'eluding', 'police', 'episode', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'ruthless', 'characters', 'John', 'Abruzzi', 'mob', 'boss', 'murderous', 'pedophile', 'Thedore', 'T-Bag', 'Bagwell', 'abusive', 'corrupt', 'prison', 'guard', 'Brad', 'Belick', 'course', 'incredible', 'mind', 'Michael', 'Scofield', 'strong-willed', 'brother', 'Lincoln', 'Burrows', 'forget', 'loveable', 'character', 'Sucre', 'who', 'Michael', 'cellmate', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'Sucre', 'part', 'escape', 'plan', 'first', 'However', 'man', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'jail', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'waiting', 'outside', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'man', 'Sucre', 'lucky', 'man.Parts', 'show', 'course', 'not', 'believable', 'frankly', 'impossible', 'have', 'remind', 'Hollywood', 'anything', 'possible', 'quite', 'exciting', 'just', 'watching', 'season', '2', 'end', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'easy', 'say', 'Season', '1', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'better', '2', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'ending', 'just', 'everyone', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'master-plan', 'Michael', 'However', 'many', 'other', 'TV', 'dramas', 'tend', 'do', 'season', 'season', 'none', 'major', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'taken', 'away', 'end', 'season', '2', 'great', 'Fox', 'put', 'out', 'two', 'great', 'winners', '24', 'Prison', 'Break', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'Fall', 'schedule', 'ahead', 'see', 'how', 'come', 'back']",N/A

991838,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000FKO3GW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[86, 92]","With a plot that sounds like it might have come from an Alfred Hitchcock or Brian De Palma movie ""Prison Break"" seemed the least likely candidate for buzz and a large following on Fox. I expected the show despite the high quality writing, top notch pilot episode directed by theatrical director Brett Ratner (""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""Red Dragon"") to tank with audiences.Boy was I wrong and happy about it. The suspenseful series got the right promotional push from Fox and luckily audiences were ready for another ground breaking series using a season long story arc much like ""24"" and ""Lost"". I would have expected a show like ""Prison Break"" to be on HBO or Showtime (as their answer to ""OZ"" another ground breaking prison drama that focused less on the gimmicks of this show) not on Fox's network. Reportedly the producers planned a shelf life of ""Prison Break"" for two seasons recognizing the issues they had with shows such as ""The X-Files"". I suspect that if the show continues to be popular this will morph into something akin to ""The Fugitive"". The show also was clearly inspired by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the TV show ""OZ"" but has its own unique flavor making it much more than a simple copycat. Between top notch writing, directing and acting the show has become the only breakthrough hit from last season worth following.If you know what this show is about skip this paragraph and go to the extras. The story for those that haven't followed the show is quite simple; Michael Scofield's brother Lincoln has been sentenced to die in the electric chair for a crime he didn't commit. Michael will do anything to get him out of prison. As the clock is ticking and its clear that legal options are limited he obtains the prison blueprints to get his brother out. How can he get them to his brother so he can use them? Simple Michael has them tattooed on his back. He then stages a bank robbery to get himself thrown into the same prison as his brother. His plans are to break out with his brother and eventually disappear. While their lawyer tries to get Lincoln out legally Michael must move forward with his plan and also negotiate a complex peace with inmate John Abruzzi (the marvelous Peter Stormare best known for ""Fargo"" and ""Constantine"") who controls many of the inmates inside the prison to achieve his goal.""Prison Break"" is presented in its original widescreen presentation and looks quite good here. There were occasional compression artifacts and edge enhancement but nothing too distracting. Overall colors are accurate with nice clarity and definition to the images. The surround tracks are used quite effectively as well evoking the atmospheric surroundings of the prison.For those interested in the extras included with this set they are quite extensive. We get multiple commentary tracks on the pilot episode by Paul Scheuring & Dominic Purcell with a second one by director Brett Ratner & Mark Helfrich. Similarly we get multiple commentary tracks on the following episodes:Cute Poison Commentary #1 by: Paul Scheuring, Dominic Purcell & Wade WilliamsCute Poison Commentary #2 by: Matt Olmstead and Silas Weir MitchellRiots, Drills and the Devil (Part 1) Commentary #1 by: Paul Scheuring, Dominic Purcell, Robert Knepper, Sarah Wayne Callies, Amaury Nolasco & Wade WilliamsRiots, Drills and the Devil (Part 1) Commentary #2 by: Nick Santora & Bob Mandel. Part two of ""Riots, Drills and the Devil"" has a single commentary track by Paul Scheuring, Dominic Purcell,  Wade Williams, Amaury Nolasco & actor Peter StormareWe also get commentaries for Odd Man Out Commentary by: Garry Brown & Karyn Usher & Bobby Roth,  Brother's Keeper Commentary by Paul Scheuring, Robert Knepper, Sarah Wayne Callies, Amaury Nolasco & Wade Williams with an alternate commentary track by Greg Yaitenes & Zach Estrin. Extras also include 2 Alternate Scenes for Cute Poison as well as three featurettes. The first  ""If These Walls Could Speak: Profile of the Joliet Correctional Center"" takes you inside the correctional facility.  ""Beyond the Ink: Tattoo Featurette"" focuses on the extensive ""map"" that plays a key role in the series tattooed on the back of Michael Scofield and one of Fox's routine "" Inside Look"" previews. All in all an exceptional package of extras considering the price for the series that will definitely make this set worthwhile for both new fans and ones that have been following it on the Fox network since its premiere last year. This set arrives just in time for the premiere of the second season as well.A terrific, comprehensive set from fox ""Prison Break"" has been packed with commentary tracks and has three featurettes two of which vary from exceptional to very good with one so-so one recycled for this set. Overall this is a great value and is highly recommended. I suspect that the creators of the series weren't sure if the show would last more than one season and, as a result, structured the series so that it could be easily wrapped up if necessary but also allowing an out for a second story arc recognizing that fans would be frustrated if they remained within prison walls beyond the first season of the series.",5,Great first season of unusual
