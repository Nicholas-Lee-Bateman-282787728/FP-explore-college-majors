It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!""-Rocky.So this movie... is not too bad, actually. Rocky is an old dog now, still got some good mileage left, but clearly he has taken his hits, and then some. In fact he seems to be pretty much done, his glory days long since past. But of coarse we know he's got some fight left in him and watching him pull himself up by his boots straps like the all American hero is, get back into shape and get into that ring one last time(?) you may actually feel respect for this character and enjoy the film. The greatest moment comes when his son shows up and Rocky delievers a truly inspired speech that serves as the message of the film.

1052576,A2RO5BKNBR7BSR,B000N3AXQU,"A. BOSTON ""***""","[3, 7]","Stallone had to thank his lucky stars Talia Shire declined to do this movie. If Adrian was still alive what would this film be about??? Rocky Balboa centers around Adrian's death and Rocky's inability to move on with his life. And the fact that Shire opted out of Rocky 6 dictated the direction of this film.I recently watched Rocky 1-3 just so I could get back in the grove before I watched Rocky Balboa. And half way into RB I felt very let down. Why? This movie felt.... forced to me. It is no secret that Sly needed this film to work. Sylvester had not had a hit film in a long time. He financed this movie himself and had a lot riding on it. And I felt like he was trying too hard to make it perfect. The dialogue felt too neat and rehearsed. Paulie was annoying. Mason Dixson had no heat with Rocky. The feud, if you could call it that, had no edge. Now Rocky vs Clubber Lang... THAT WAS INTENSE. Balboa vs Dixson had no real intrigue to me. Dixson was not a bad guy or a mean guy. He didnt make you want to hate him. Which is important in a Rocky film.The main event looked like a REAL fight. You could tell that it was filmed with the same cameras used to shoot sporting events. It was pretty impressive. But the fight felt nothing like the fights in other Rocky series. Creed, Lang, Drago, these fights had a special feel. They had drama and passion. Hard hits. Tension. These older fights WERE Rocky. The style and presentation of these great fights is gone from Rocky Balboa. The main even in this movie feels like a TV fight. I felt a little detached. Like I wasnt in the ring. I wasnt feeling the punches or the anger. I wasnt involved in the outcome. I didnt care who won or lost.The parts of the film that did work were the flashbacks. It was cool to see shots from the other movies intertwined with this film. I would have loved to see Mr. T or Dolph Lundgren make a cameo, but that did not happen.Im glad this movie was a success for Mr. Stallone, as he is one of the greats. But he could have done better.

A new James Bond?  The greatest cinematic makeover in history.  Now, here comes the same ol' Rocky.  And for the most part, it was another welcome return.If ever a person was born to play a part, Rocky Balboa is it for Sylvester Stallone.  Say what you will about the crass commercialism of Rocky's 3, 4, and 5, Sly rarely missed a beat.  Well, OK, there wasn't much to love about Rocky 5.  But even the lesser sequels got one thing right: Stallone stayed true to the character.Wisely, he chose to write and direct this (one can only hope) final  installment, a fitting bookend to the saga.  Stallone has always been smarter than the characters he plays, and his script strikes a good balance between drama and self-deprecating humor.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] When a bunch of young punks throw a few verbal jabs at the aging ex-champ, their words ring true. . .yet you can't help but feel for the guy.  This may be a minority opinion, but I think this is easily Stallone's finest ACTING performance of the series.  That's right, I said ACTING.Sure, the film eventually lapses into the predicable training montage, and maybe one too many speeches from the Italian Stallion.  But by taking the time to make you care about the characters again--it's been 16 years, after all--you may find yourself cheering in spite of yourself.Now, on to the DVD itself.  We get a witty and insightful commentary from the Man himself.  There's also an alternate ending that shows just how much Stallone (and Rocky) has matured. . .twenty years ago, the more predictable, less-satisfying ending would probably have made the final cut.  A bunch of delted scenes are included, offering a bit more screen time for Burt Young's Paulie (who, incidentally, also gets my vote for best performance of the six ROCKY films).If you've read this far, you're probably a big enough ROCKY fan to make the purchase.  It's a fine conclusion to the series, a story with heart and humor. . .and let's face it, that's become a rare combination these days.",4,"""The last thing to age on a person is his heart.""",1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2151,"['had', 'three', 'surprises', 'theaters', '2006', 'seemed', 'have', 'odds', 'going', 'new', 'Superman', 'worked', 'just', 'fine', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'makeover', 'history', 'Now', 'here', 'same', 'ol', 'Rocky', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'welcome', 'return.If', 'ever', 'person', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'part', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'crass', 'commercialism', 'Rocky', '3', '4', '5', 'Sly', 'rarely', 'missed', 'beat', 'Well', 'OK', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'love', 'Rocky', '5', 'even', 'lesser', 'sequels', 'got', 'one', 'thing', 'right', 'Stallone', 'stayed', 'true', 'character.Wisely', 'chose', 'write', 'direct', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'final', 'installment', 'fitting', 'bookend', 'saga', 'Stallone', 'always', 'been', 'smarter', 'characters', 'script', 'good', 'balance', 'drama', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', '[', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', ']', 'When', 'bunch', 'young', 'punks', 'throw', 'few', 'verbal', 'jabs', 'aging', 'ex-champ', 'words', 'ring', 'true', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'guy', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'opinion', 'think', 'easily', 'Stallone', 'finest', 'ACTING', 'performance', 'series', 'right', 'said', 'ACTING.Sure', 'film', 'eventually', 'predicable', 'training', 'montage', 'maybe', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'speeches', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'taking', 'time', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'again', 'been', '16', 'years', 'may', 'find', 'cheering', 'spite', 'yourself.Now', 'DVD', 'get', 'witty', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'Man', 'also', 'alternate', 'ending', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'matured', '.twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'predictable', 'less-satisfying', 'ending', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'bunch', 'delted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'offering', 'bit', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Paulie', 'who', 'incidentally', 'also', 'vote', 'best', 'performance', 'six', 'ROCKY', 'films', '.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'far', ""'re"", 'probably', 'big', 'enough', 'ROCKY', 'fan', 'make', 'purchase', 'fine', 'conclusion', 'series', 'story', 'heart', 'humor', '.and', 'let', 'face', 'become', 'rare', 'combination', 'days']",N/A

A virtual dream match says that if Dixon and Balboa were to fight in their prime, Balboa would win. It gets people talking and surely enough, Rocky's ready to rumble in Las Vegas. For the first time in his professional career, he's fighting without Adrian at his side; we learn that she lost her own fight to the ""woman cancer"". Paulie, Duke, and Rocky Jr. (now renamed Robert) along with Little Marie are all back to help the Italian Stallion go the distance.I'm a huge Rocky fan; I grew up watching these movies over and over again (I saw 4 of them in theaters as they were coming out; Rocky III-IV-V and Rocky Balboa) and I couldn't wait to see this one when I first saw the trailer for it last fall. Kudos to Stallone for pulling this off and finishing the Rocky saga the way it was meant to end (Rocky V surprisingly is not as bad as we all remember it, but no less lightweight compared to the other entries in the series). The Stallion is in great shape and it shows. Stallone, who continues to write and direct the series, has injected a lot of emotion in this last ride; more so than the last two installments combined.Bringing back Little Marie from the first film was very appropriate and Geraldine Hughes did a great job portraying her. I like the way Rocky and Marie's relationship develops; she needs him to believe in herself and he needs her to help fill the void Adrian left. Milo Ventimiglia was perfectly cast as Robert (whatever happened to the name Rocky Jr.?) who's been living in the shadow of a legend. Burt Young played Paulie the same way he's always done and we love him for it. Everything that made the Rocky films what they are is here: the training montage, the run up the museum steps, the flashbacks, Bill Conti's Rocky fanfare, and that exciting final boxing match. The boxing sequences were expertly filmed and the use of black and white at times was a nice touch.Rocky Balboa is for all of us kids of the 70's and 80's who grew up watching Rocky fight Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago and kept asking for more. It bathes in nostalgia and delivers the goods on every level. Stallone should be proud to have his beloved character go out in a blaze of glory like this.

There were many events and characters that entered and exited the story pointlessly. (Paulie losing his job was a good example of a pointless scene) The villain wasn't a villain. The boxing champion that Rocky fought wasn't scary, and wasn't believable as a fighter that was hated. Mason Dixon would have been far more believable if drawn out as a gansta' rapper loving young punk. My impression was that Stallone went politcally correct and de-balled Dixon, leaving him bland and colorless.Rocky's son, and the son storyline, went nowhere. One moment Rocky's son was distant, and the next (literally the next scene) his son quit his job to be with Rocky.

Of course it's incredible, but realism was never the attraction of Rocky movies.  It's always been about the inspiration and the yearning.So if you're beyond being touched by a sentimental flick about an iconic American character, give this a pass.  Stallone was wise not to make his opponent a villainous ""bad"" guy.  And that is indicative of the movie as a whole: Stallone displays maturity in both his story, himself, and his character.

Lo and below, Rocky Balboa is back and charms his way throughout the picture. I've not had so much fun, and I love the whole package. What Sylvester Stallone brought to Rocky Balboa is the old memories and characters. At the same time, he merges his past with the present, showing no hard feelings or bitterness about how things are different and/or changed. He just has a different perspective on them, and interestingly, Rocky Balboa is old school meets new school, just a real nice fresh change for a turn. The editing work is unlike the crap I see nowadays with an interesting back-and-forth of the natural, part of the film and the fight show. I like that. Sylvester Stallone (whose best acting bit is when he gives the speech to his son before he goes back in the restaurant) is phenomenal playing Rocky again, and it's the role that he was born to play. Everybody else is great also. It's too bad not seeing Talia Shire again, but actually her death contributes a great deal to the story and makes Rocky Balboa to work. A real good asset indeed. Another thing I like about the story of Rocky Balboa is how Stallone combines the juvenile mentality of ESPN (you know, the crap about who is the best and the fictional versus thing that dominates the show instead of showing some real sports) and the need for Rocky to come back and actually fight. It makes total sense, and the fight is awesome. The best part...well, there is so many of them in the movie, but the best part is how Rocky Balboa ended. It shows how much we know that Rocky didn't care about the fight result but the actual result of winning the true fight. That display shows what is more important, and Sylvester Stallone does that admirably well. That's why I loved the movie. The feeling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time. I always think of a movie that could be made in sort of ""back to the old times again"" in a ""where are they now?"" And Sylvester Stallone does just exactly that. Mike Tyson trashing-talking with the current champion is hilarious, reminding me of the press news conference post-melee where Iron Mike yells at Lennox Lewis, ""You scared coward. You ain't a man enough to **** with me."" All in all, Rocky Balboa is a great, inspiring feel-good movie that is almost (I'm wincing over that rap song for Mason Dixon's entrance) completely free of anything that's improper and brings back the memories again to the point that I feel like I want to watch the whole series all over again and relive that ""Gonna Fly Now"" scene atop of the steps in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum (now moved back to below next to the steps). This film deserves a `10'.8/11: I am going to lower my rating of Rocky Balboa from `10' to `6'. To be honest with you, it's just not a very good film. Of course, it is filled with memories, but we can always watch first five pictures to relive them. So, what is the point? It is hard to for me to stomach Robert Balboa, a whelping that needs to be beaten up by Rocky to set his priorities straight. Also, it gets pretty tiresome to see Paulie making the same, usual complaints. If he is going to be like that, why should I bother to care?

1052597,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000N3AXQU,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[28, 29]","After 16 years, Sylvester Stallone has accomplished what many figured would never happen. He came back with a new Rocky movie, and he came back with a really GOOD Rocky movie. Not only does Rocky still have punches in him, but so does Stallone. As a fan of the series, I can safely say that this is the best entry since the original. Quickly, the plot sees Rock running his own restaraunt, Adrian's, named after his deceased wife(Talia Shire is missed, but it works, and Shire herself says she trusts and believes in Sly with this twist in the story), and he doesn't have a strong relationship with his son(Milo Ventamiglia). A virtual reality boxing match on TV pitting him against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon(Antonio Carver)has Rocky defeating him, and setting up a real life match with Rocky coming out of retirement for one last match. It's an interesting premise, really, and it works. Some may think it takes too long to get going or to get to the action, but that's why it works. It's not just about action and boxing, but about the people and the character of Rocky. That's why I like it. I am just as interested, if not more, in the non-boxing aspects of the movie. The best thing about the Rocky films is that each one finds the Italian Stallion in a new part of his life and takes it from there. He's older now, and the film doesn't overlook it just for Rocky and Sly to have another shot at glory. It's about age. It's a big part of the film. That's one of the great things about the film. They are not overlooking reality and age just to make another film. I hear the same thing is being done for Indy 4. The flashback scenes are scarce(although others say otherwise), and the ""tour"" of the old haunts is nostalgic, affective, and well placed. This film feels like a Rocky film, and has a sense of the original film. Little Marie(Geraldine Hughes) is back, as well as Spider, and this leads to the film's closer touch to the classic original. Burt Young's Paulie is still Paulie, and it would seem out of place to have a Rocky movie without him. The movie is surprisingly real, emotional, and heartfelt. You can't help but get caught up in the situation and cheer Rock on one last time. The end match is great, and feels like the real deal. It's exceptionally planned out and set up, and makes the tension feel real as you watch it. Bill Conti's theme is back, and it still raises goosebumps when it starts up. Sly isn't the greatest actor, but he is Rocky, and he knows Rocky, and he is really good in the film, as well as behind the camera as a director. Rocky V had it's moments, but it was not the film to end on. This one is. It fits wonderfully, and it wraps it up perfectly. To see the love and respect Rocky gets from people, especially in the end, is heartwarming. It doesn't fail to bring a lump to your throat. To matter how old you get, or where your life takes you, Rocky Balboa tells you to never give up. Thanks for coming back with Rocky one more time Sly.

1052604,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000N3AXQU,Bill Garrison,"[7, 8]","Rocky Balboa is the final installment in the great Rocky franchise that began thirty years ago with the original film winning the best picture Oscar. The final film goes back to the roots of the series and focuses on Rocky as a person, and as a man, and ignores the flash of Rocky IV and the silliness of Rocky V.Rocky is older now, and all he has left are memories of his boxing career and memories of Adrian, who died a few years ago. Rocky spends his nights entertaining customers at his Italian restaurant (called ""Adrian's"") with stories of his boxing glory. On the anniversary of Adrian's death, he tours the location where they first lived, their first date and then visits the grave. A reluctant Pauley goes with Rocky but his son Robert is absent.Rocky sees a computer simulated fight of himself and current champ Mason Dixon. Rocky wins the computer fight and this gives Rocky the bug to do a little fighting again, to maybe try and get in shape. Meanwhile, Mason Dixon's managers are urging him to fight an exhibition with Rocky in hopes of improving his reputation and to make tons of money.Rocky Balboa has several strengths and weaknesses. First, Sylvester Stallone is excellent in the movie. He plays Rocky as a man just trying to be good, trying to be a good father, trying to please the people in his world. Out in public, he graciously signs autographs and poses for pictures even though you can tell he's been doing it for years. Paulie is good in the movie and through flashbacks we see Creed, Adrian and Mickey. The final fight is done as an HBO broadcast and the fight is really awesome. It is much more realistic than any of the fights from the previous movies. Also, the Bill Conti score is exceptional. If you are a fan of the series, this will be a great conclusion for you.Now for the complaints. Some people can nitpick about how he deals with his son and another kid that he befriends, but those subplots didn't bother me. Rocky spends the first hour of the movie moping around his restaurant. Knowing how the movie ends, I would have liked to see a little more of him staying in shape, because he'd have to be in shape to fight they way he does at the end. That being said, the training they do show via a montage is set to ""Gonna Fly Now"" and is predicable, boring and short. The fight is realistic, but the story told via the fight is pretty bland. Again, minor complaints, but I want you to know this isn't a ""perfect"" movie.Rocky Balboa is a good movie, not great, but to a diehard Rocky fan, it could be considered great. It wipes the sour taste of Rocky V out of our mouth and will leave you presently surprised to see that Sylvester Stallone still has it. ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!",4,A great end to the series!  ROCKY!

1052607,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000N3AXQU,Boss Fan,"[1, 1]","Back in July, soon after this film was announced, I happened upon this page and found a review (yes, a review, six months prior to the release of the film and before a trailer was even officially released) trashing this film.  This is nothing new at Amazon: people bashing things they have not seen because they did not like a previous film, the actor in it, or just think the movie looks bad or is somehow a bad idea.  I wrote a response - not a review of the film, but a response to the insulting review that the writer thought was so clever (yeah, as if making fun of a ""Rocky"" sequel is both original and clever) - in which I urged people like this to wait until the film is released before they write such things.  I said the movie may or may not suck, but wait and see it first.  Maybe that day I was just fed up with seeing premature reviews that can not actually be trusted by Amazon readers popping up everywhere.  But the good news is that reviewer and all the scoffers can get ready to eat their words.  Not only was ""Rocky"" a terrific movie in my opinion, but the critics love it too.  Over at rottentomatoes.com, the movie review website that comes up with an average score for a film based on all the reviews from the nations top 200+ critic, ""Rocky Balboa"" is at 80%, meaning out of those critics' reviews, 80% have been favorable.  This may sound like no small feat, but for a movie that everyone laughed off and seemed doomed from the start - at least from a critical perspective - it is damn good.  Actually, it is damn good by any standard.  80% actually places it among the better reviewed movies of there year (critics don't like quite a few movies - 80% and above is a somewhat elite bunch).See MCW; should have waited...But forget all that.  Those stats are really just semantics.  The real question is, will fans and non fans alike be able to be swept up again by Rocky after all these years and a few rote sequels that have diminished the memory of the original, and just how great and effective a film it was?The answer is a resounding and surprised 'YES!'  And the reason why:  Sylvester Stallone.  As writer, director, and star - and the guy hanging it all on the line - mainly meaning his dignity if this thing is the flop most people are waiting to see - this movie is all his.  That this movie inspires and excites and entertains to such a large, unexpected degree, means the kudos then should be all his as well.  All of Rocky's speeches in the film about life hitting hard, having to hit back, how many hits can you take and keep comin', doing what is right for you, listening to your heart become a huge metaphor for Stallone and his reviving of this character.  I won't spoil Rocky's outcome in the film's main event, but Stallone himself wins big by following those credos.Confession time:  I am not a huge ""Rocky"" fan.  I remember loving the first one, but it has been years since I have seen it.  I hated the last two and the first two sequels were okay at the time when I was a young kid, but seem pretty much a relic of their time to me now.  Also I am a jaded-as-hell movie-goer when it comes to underdog sports movies.  They are all the same and I can not think of one, supposedly inspirational, spots flick that ever affected me. (This does not include movies like ""Million Dollar Baby"" (one of my all time favorites), and the like in which a sport in the film is secondary to the actual story being told.  I'm talking about all these interchangeable underdog flicks that we forget which one is which as soon as a new one comes out which, in the last year and a half alone includes ""Invincible,"" ""Gridiron Gang,"" ""We Are Marshall,"" ""Glory Road,"" ""Coach Carter,"" ""Miracle,"" ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""The Rookie,"" and so many more I couldn't possibly name them all.  Come on, admit it; even if you are a sucker for these kinds of films - and I'm not saying they are all bad, some are good, just that there are too many of them and they are all usually similar and uninspired - you know they all play the same card the same way.  The sad thing is we have great, old-school sport films like ""Rocky"" and ""Hoosiers"" to thank for this ungodly influx of these films.)Watching the new ""Rocky"" film, I may have figured out why these movies always leave me so cold, beyond the fact that they are all so similar.  I never felt like I knew any of the cookie-cutter characters in most of those films (I knew them as caricatures from dozens of like movies, but I never thought of them as anything resembling real people - just composites of sport-film clich&eacute;s), I never felt like I cared much what happened to them because I didn't know them, and I figured we all sort of know what the outcome will be (any number of standard variations on coming from behind to win, losing but learning the all-important life lesson so by default one wins, or tragedy strikes and tears are supposed to swell as the booming score does - very few surprises or anything original in most of these movies).  What Sylvester Stallone does with his script for this film changed all that.  It doesn't exactly avoid all the old chestnuts of sport film lore, but he turns them on their ear just enough.  Even if he didn't, that is not the films biggest feat.  No it's biggest feat is that as a viewer you feel so sucked into the film, caring so much about this character.  You can relate to him.  And even though most of our life experiences don't exactly parallel Rocky's plight, his inner struggle - which he explains in a brief but oh-so effective speech to his son - is something both inspirational and that hits so close to home, whatever your fears, regrets and proud moments may be.And don't forget, WE DO KNOW Rocky!  The world knows Rocky.  Watching the bout in this film felt like watching an actual fight you have something invested in.  You care about the outcome because you care about the fighter.  Just like a real fight.  You feel invested in it.  From the training montage on, the audience reacted verbally and with claps, and - in a few moments - tears, to everything Rocky did.  I can't begin to say how surprised I am that Stallone was able to pull this thing off.  What sounded like a joke, and any easy target for jokes, from the get-go, turns out to be one of the most exciting (save for a maybe too-long and indulgent first half an hour or so) and freshest feeling films of the year.  It's so old fashioned it almost feels new again.  It's classic.Sly has always been a better actor than he is given credit for.  It will be just as easy for his detractors to pick apart his performance here, but if you get it; what he is doing, what Rocky means to him as a metaphor and what he is trying to give the fans of the series, he is nothing short of charming - often extraordinary - in his performance.I can not tell you how surprised I am by this film.  It may not work so effectively on you if you don't see it with a theatre audience that roared as loud as the crowd in the movie itself; or if you are too cynical and just looking to find a reason to hate this film you may find them.  But I - a jaded sport-film hater - found myself choked up a few times, on the edge of my seat others, and applauding like an idiot in hopes a fictional character would just be able to stand in a ring for a few rounds.It is surprising and exciting just how pumped up this movie gets you.  Rocky is again the underdog - and so, as I said earlier, is Stallone.  You want Rocky to win just as much as you want Stallone himself to be triumphant.  Just as Rocky has been counted out in the ring, so has Stallone as a serious actor.  You begin to realize you are rooting as much for Stallone as for the character he has created.  And the excitement of seeing them both fighting their way back is at times an exhilarating - and emotional - experience.So, some scoffed at the idea of this sequel, saying things like 'let the character die with dignity.'  The true indignity would be to have allowed this franchise to go out with the tepid ""Rocky V,"" which was about as far from what made the original so great as the series ever got.  With ""Rocky Balboa,"" not only does Sly sign off with dignity, but he leaves the series - and the character - with a renewed vigor and greatness and humanity that has not been seen since the original.  And this one may be even more inspiring in its message.And Sly, oh yeah, he's still got it.  And, yes, he's in great shape for 60.  Hell, great shape for 30.Hate if you must, but you are missing out.  Hear me when I say this - from a guy who is not a fan of sports movies:  I truly believe ""Rocky Balboa"" is one of the best films of the year.  It may technically not be all that original, but it is one of the best, most exciting, entertaining, feel-good times you will have at a movie all year.  Even my girlfriend was duckin' and jabbin' in her seat and clapping and crying with the rest of the true ""Roco"" fans - and she'd never seen one ""Rocky"" film in her life.All together now:  Rocky!

The series withered and died with the fifth movie, that was anything but good. Or so I thought.Although I was sceptical, I of course had to see the movie, and I must admit it blew me away. One of my main concerns were how they would explain Rocky going back into the ring again, seeing that he's 60 years old and all, but they made quite convincingly made it plausible. The storyline is very good if a bit simple, and the acting is solid. Stallone delivers a good performance as an aging Balboa looking for meaning and purpose with his existence. You really feel for him as he goes through all the obstacles between him and the fight.Also one of the things I enjoyed very much about the movie was, that there is no animosity.

I will never again lend a second's credence to such shameless nitpicking. Sylvester Stallone may very well be a sixty year old man, but he pulled off ""Rocky Balboa"" in a profoundly moving and realistic manner and subsequently transformed this prior skeptic into a BIG-TIME believer. This, far and beyond any reasonable contention, is the true and respectful swan song the ""Rocky"" saga has long deserved.Wisely ignoring the unsightly plot points that were introduced in ""Rocky V,"" this more recent story unfolds with a highly publicized ""virtual boxing"" match that pits the long-retired Rocky against current heavyweight titleholder Mason Dixon. When Rocky scores the duke in this particular fantasy bout, Dixon retaliates by challenging Balboa to a one-on-one publicly televised 10-round exhibition. Everybody, including Rocky's own son, steadfastly dismisses the idea. But Rocky, who has always ever worked best when the odds were stacked against him, agrees to face Dixon. What ensues, amidst the rudimentary training regimen we've all seen Rocky endure throughout the five previous films, is a staggeringly heartfelt and engaging character study that very nearly rivals that which was introduced in John Avildsen's groundbreaking 1976 original.Among the most notable are some admittedly touching moments with Rocky and Paulie as they revisit the Italian Stallion's love for Adrian who, as many prior reviewers here have already noted, is no longer part of the narrative fold. These scenes, along with a certain pep-talk Rocky gives his defiantly selfish son at the film's halfway mark, really helped sell the story's realism. Stallone made me genuinely feel for these people, a feat that I and many others had previously doubted he was capable of achieving. His screenplay very literally came out of left field and opened my eyes to the plain and simple fact that he still has what it takes. There was not a single point throughout the entire film where I was deliberately thinking about his age. A person's age, as I've already alluded to, should never be a consideration. You're as young as you feel and, if you happen to be in the phenomenal shape Stallone is in for a man of his years, I say more power to ya'!There really isn't anything more to be said.

How can a movie be made about a 60 year old man wanting to box again?(excuse me, 59 year old man--a few years shaved off in the story I noticed).  I've always viewed the first 3 movies as one long movie: It went from Rocky being a nobody to the champ, to losing and back again and part 4 & 5 were some other Rocky, in another dimension.  The first 3 movies were great, the others not so much for me personally.  Truth is the new movie is a fitting end to the Rocky series.  I've always thought the last movie, made in 1990, was the worst of the entire series, a big mess, and it just seemed like an odd way to end Rocky's boxing career, with a bare fisted street fight in a rundown Philli neighborhood with a Don King-type looking on saying 'touch me and I'll sue'.  For most of Rocky Balboa the movie has a somewhat depressing tone -well not somewhat... it IS depressing- and Rocky seems to dwell on the past and his deceased wife Adrian who died of the 'woman cancer' 4 years earlier.  It almost becomes pitiful and excruciating watching Rocky's life until he decides to return to boxing.  But hence I think Stallone knew this as well when he wrote this.  The movie seems to work, at least to me.  The look Stallone gives as he is walking out of the ring after the fight at the end of the movie and waving to the crowd is very moving.  His expression is almost as if he's saying 'thank you' to the audience, both in the movie and the audience/fans watching the movie.  That little look says it all about why he made this movie and why he wanted to make the movie.  It's true the movie is pretty much nostalgia(the hat, the gloves, the old gray sweatpants, the old apt. stoop, the steps leading up to the museum, the old neighborhood haunts, the bar, Spider Ricco, the turtles, the pet shop, the ice rink, the meat factory Paulie works at, little Marie and unfortunately, the downing of raw eggs by Rocky) but it works.  It was nice to see Rocky come back although I truly hope this is the last Rocky movie.  I don't want to see Rocky entering the ring with a cane when he's 80 years old or nothing like that.  The making of on the DVD is very good too.  You get to see how wild the fans act as he's filming the movie in and around Philladelphia.  The world truly loves Rocky.  And for Rocky fans, take note: Stallone mentions on the audio commentary that there will be a diretor's cut of the movie.  Can you say double dipping? Great movie nonetheless.  At least part V won't be the last chapter to the Rocky series.  The look as he's leaving the arena(in the new movie) says it all.",4,Rocky Resurrected,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2717,"['had', 'same', 'thought', 'everyone', 'else', 'probably', 'had', 'when', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'oh', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'total', 's', 'How', 'can', 'movie', 'be', 'made', '60', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'wanting', 'box', 'again', '59', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'few', 'years', 'shaved', 'off', 'story', 'noticed', ""'ve"", 'always', 'viewed', 'first', '3', 'movies', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'went', 'Rocky', 'being', 'nobody', 'champ', 'losing', 'back', 'again', 'part', '4', '5', 'were', 'other', 'Rocky', 'dimension', 'first', '3', 'movies', 'were', 'great', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'personally', 'Truth', 'new', 'movie', 'fitting', 'end', 'Rocky', 'series', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'last', 'movie', 'made', '1990', 'was', 'worst', 'entire', 'series', 'big', 'mess', 'just', 'seemed', 'odd', 'way', 'end', 'Rocky', 'boxing', 'career', 'bare', 'fisted', 'street', 'fight', 'rundown', 'Philli', 'neighborhood', 'Don', 'King-type', 'looking', 'saying', ""'touch"", ""'ll"", 'sue', 'most', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'tone', '-well', 'not', 'somewhat', 'depressing-', 'Rocky', 'dwell', 'past', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'who', 'died', ""'woman"", 'cancer', '4', 'years', 'earlier', 'almost', 'pitiful', 'excruciating', 'watching', 'Rocky', 'life', 'return', 'boxing', 'hence', 'think', 'Stallone', 'knew', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'wrote', 'movie', 'work', 'least', 'look', 'Stallone', 'walking', 'ring', 'fight', 'end', 'movie', 'waving', 'crowd', 'very', 'moving', 'expression', 'almost', 'saying', 'audience', 'movie', 'audience/fans', 'watching', 'movie', 'little', 'look', 'why', 'made', 'movie', 'why', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'true', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'nostalgia', 'hat', 'gloves', 'old', 'gray', 'sweatpants', 'old', 'apt', 'stoop', 'steps', 'leading', 'up', 'museum', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'haunts', 'bar', 'Spider', 'Ricco', 'turtles', 'pet', 'shop', 'ice', 'rink', 'meat', 'factory', 'Paulie', 'little', 'Marie', 'unfortunately', 'downing', 'raw', 'eggs', 'Rocky', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Rocky', 'come', 'back', 'truly', 'hope', 'last', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Rocky', 'entering', 'ring', 'cane', 'when', '80', 'years', 'old', 'nothing', 'making', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'wild', 'fans', 'act', 'filming', 'movie', 'Philladelphia', 'world', 'truly', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'fans', 'take', 'note', 'Stallone', 'mentions', 'audio', 'commentary', 'will', 'be', 'diretor', 'cut', 'movie', 'Can', 'say', 'double', 'dipping', 'Great', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'least', 'part', 'V', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'chapter', 'Rocky', 'series', 'look', 'leaving', 'arena', 'new', 'movie']",N/A

Anyway, on to Rocky 6.While it's absolutely great to revisit the old character, Rocky Balboa leaves a lot to be desired. I read that originally Adrian was included in the script but in the end he wanted Rocky to lose almost everything so the character would appear as desperate and lost as possible. I really think a much better way to do that would have been to include her in the first of the movie, go through the cancer with her and then to lose her, instead of her just not being there. We never got to see Balboa's pain of losing her, and to me that is a major drawback.Mason and Steps are extremely poorly developed, and both of these ""actors"" have absolutely no acting skill whatsoever. A cardboard standup could have played either of their roles. Stallone should have developed steps a bit more, and chosen a boxer with more character to play Mason. I found these two characters extremely flawed.I also seriously questioned the ability of Rocky to run a successful business, negotiate in the marketplace and make any money. I mean, this is a guy who couldn't read ""smell manly"" in the commercials he tried to do in Rocky 2, now he's a business man? Someone would either be robbing him blind or he'd be bankrupt with his level of intelligence. So for me, to say that he was running a business was a little far fetched unless it's a boxing gym or something, which would have been a much better choice for the character.Stallone himself even seems tired in this film. He never really laughs, and even his jokes seem tired. I know he's lost everything, but who wants to see Rocky with almost no sense of humor, and never having a good time no matter what he does?Having said all that, it is simply fantastic to revisit the character. I found myself very emotional when the Rocky theme started playing. At the end, realizing that this would be the last Rocky movie ever, I just sat still for a while. Not many movies have that sort of ""punch.""It was fantastic to see him really give the character a final send off. Production was good, camera work is awesome and I enjoyed the script for the most part.After 16 years without a Rocky movie, I really feel that anything he did was bound to be a hit.

Hats off to Mr. Stallone, who reminded us about the greatness of this character, and why we loved him so when he first appeared. Once again, the character of Rocky has stirred the hearts of many in this final segment with his kindness, his endurance and his courage. I love the closing scenes when the credits are shown. As comical as it may seem to some, it captures the essence of the movie and how it has inspired many to overcome difficult obstacles.

1052619,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000N3AXQU,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]","""Rocky Balboa"" can be viewed in two distinct ways: it's either an unoriginal film that reuses all the best elements from the original ""Rocky""; or it's a well-crafted film that respectfully pays tribute to its origins while telling a new and compelling story. For whatever it's worth, I tend to favor the latter interpretation. While it isn't perfect, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. It's a heartfelt story written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, one that manages to steer clear of becoming sappy, preachy, or melodramatic. Yes, the climactic fight scene is also entertaining, but it's nowhere near as important as what takes place early on. Just like the original 1976 film, this is not a story about boxing; it's about amounting to something amidst the realities of everyday living. Stallone created an underdog character, representing the everyman who wanted a chance at greatness.In some ways, these underlying themes take on even greater significance than when they were presented thirty years ago. Still living in Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is now an aging restaurant owner. Consumed with remorse over the death of his beloved Adrian, he begins to wonder whether or not he still has what it takes to get through life. It's apparent on the anniversary of her death that he needs to go in a different direction; not only does he visit her grave, he and Paulie (Burt Young)--Adrian's brother--also visit all the spots where Adrian and Balboa were together. They stop by the pet store where she and Balboa looked at birds. They stand on the stoop of Balboa's home, where he envisions her as she once appeared. They even visit the vacant lot of the now demolished ice skating rink. When at this location, Paulie loses himself, feeling as if he has no right to remind himself of his sister (who he treated badly).His last stop is a sleazy little bar, where he meets the local bartender, Marie (Geraldine Hughes). As it turns out, she's the same Marie that Balboa walked home thirty years ago, back when she was just a young girl (""Screw you, creepo!"" were her final words to him). They immediately strike up a friendship, made stronger with the introduction of her son, nicknamed Steps (James Francis Kelly III). For whatever reason, they motivate Balboa into random acts of kindness, such as employing them both for his restaurant. While Marie is certainly grateful, she has a hard time understanding why he's being so generous. ""You don't owe us nothing,"" she says one night as Balboa replaces the bulb of her porch light. ""Why do you have to owe something to get something?"" is his simple yet significant reply. This scene worked especially well because so much was being said with so few words; a lot of this film works on that level (it made me think twice about criticizing Stallone's overly-colloquial writing style).Other relationships highlight the story, such as that between Balboa and his son, Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who has gone on to become a suit-wearing paper pusher in a wealthy Philadelphia high rise. When making a surprise visit, Balboa sees his son's boss acting belligerently, suggesting that his son is willing to let people step all over him. He clearly has some issues, always feeling as if he's lived in the shadow of his famous father. Now it seems as if Rocky, Jr. is unwilling to visit the family restaurant, opting instead to go out for drinks with his friends. During one such outing, the bar's television is tuned in to the sports channel, where a computer-simulated match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fought. Of course, the animated Balboa wins.But when the real Balboa hears of this ""victory,"" thoughts of actually entering the ring one last time begin floating through his head. Consider the fact that at his restaurant, he goes from table to table, telling his guests stories about his past fights; is this not indicative of someone who still has something to prove? His son seems to think so, and the feelings only get stronger when Balboa decides to go through with it. Rocky, Jr. is initially unwilling to support his father, who he thinks will only succeed in embarrassing them both. The sports world doesn't hold out much hope, either; Balboa will be up against Dixon, who's younger, faster, and more athletic. But Balboa is determined to do what he feels is the right thing.Thus begins the obligatory montage training sequence, set against Bill Conte's famous score. Just like in the first film, Balboa runs through the city in a gray sweat suit. He punches sides of beef in Paulie's slaughterhouse. There are even some brief shots of him chugging a glassful of raw eggs. (I can't say whether or not this scene was written to appease fans of the original film. I suppose it doesn't really matter; if a film's plot centers on an impending boxing match, training footage is a necessary component.)I won't bother describing anything about the final fight scene in Las Vegas; because the entire film builds up to it, you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that, to a degree, I questioned the plausibility of it, especially in terms of Dixon's involvement. He's an undefeated champion boxer, yet he's not respected in the sports community, labeled as someone who only picks easy opponents. I also got the impression that he genuinely respects Balboa, despite offering a way for him to be defeated without embarrassment. He comes to believe that his managers are only interested in the financial success of the fight, and that made me wonder why he would actually want to be in the ring at all; such a hollowly conceived boxing match cannot be easily dismissed.Nonetheless, the ending of ""Rocky Balboa"" is appropriate. It helps that the fight scene in and of itself does not represent the soul of the film; as I said before, this is not a story about boxing. At one point, Balboa says something to effect of, ""It's not about whether or not you get hit, but about how hard you can be hit and get back up."" It may be a cliche statement, but there's no denying that it rings true. Is this film better than the original ""Rocky""? Of course not. Nothing ever will be better than that. But is it a worthy final chapter to the film series? Absolutely.",4,And to All a Good Fight,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,6280,"['Rocky', 'Balboa', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'two', 'distinct', 'ways', 'unoriginal', 'film', 'best', 'elements', 'original',

1052622,A5LYQZ3A4ZUQX,B000N3AXQU,Clear Thinker,"[3, 3]","What do we mean by [i]transcendant [/i] art of the story-telling variety, ie books or movies? I think it is fair to say that this sort of real art moves us deeply, transcending the actual subject matter and  strongly touches us personally at a universal human level. Was  The Old Man and The Sea only about fishing? Was Moby Dick about simply whaling? Was The Magnificent Seven about 7 gunslingers on a job? Was Showgirls  only about nude dancing? Ok. Bad example. But you get the point.As a prime example of such art, I commend to you the new movie Rocky Balboa. Like everyone else, I was sort of disdainful of Stallone cranking out another Rocky movie. I was wrong. And if you don't do yourself the great favor of seeing it now on the Big Screen, you will be, too. It is more than great entertainment; it is art. Transcendant art. The best in the series. The best. And it is not really about boxing.Rocky Balboa has carved himself a nice life since his career in the ring ended. He has a nice successful restaurant. Upscale clientelle. he's an icon. People greet him on the street,wanting to have their pictures taken with him.He wears an expensive sport coat to work. He speaks well, looks good, has friends of all sorts and money in the bank. And yet..and yet..Adrienne is gone, of cancer three years ago. He goes to her grave and walks where they walked, remembering. His son is estranged from him, overshadowed by his famous father and blaming his dad for it. And Rocky tells stories to his restaurant patrons of the old days while signing autographs and posing for photos. Is this The Italian Stallion? There is still fire within. And one way to let it out. Fighters fight. He applies for a boxing license.Passes all tests with flying colors. And gets turned down. The insight that Stallone brings to this script which he wrote, his heartfelt speech to the Licensing board and later his son and"" Paulie""  are the real knockouts in the film. He gets his license, planning on some minor fights. But it isn't going to be that way.When a computer simulated fight predicts that Rocky in his 1970s prime would defeat current undefeated heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver,genune light-heavyweight champion and top pound-for-pound fighter at the time), an exhibiition fight is arranged. Dixon at first  expects to ""carry"" Rocky, much as Jumbo Collins carried Joe Frazier when Smokin' Joe came out of reitrement and had nothing left. But as boxing pundits continue to say that Dixon isn't what Rocky was, as he is dissed, as Rocky gets the pre-fight applause and press, you can see Antonio Taver getting more and more irritated. And when Balboa tells Tarver ""I didn't come here to lose"", you know it ain't gonna be no friendly exhibition.Technically, the film is amazing. The fight scenes, video and real, feel authentic. Real referee,real announcer, real commentators, Mike Tyson ringside  screaming that the champion is ducking him. The editing is great. It IS an HBO PPV fight. There are several muted almost hidden, images that will reverberate with fans of the earlier films. And Tarver at the peak of his form has that great long jab and crushing left cross (he is a southpaw) that won him the real title.This film is not about boxing. It is about getting older, about loss, about digging down, about being true to yourself, about love and kids and redemption. [...].It is more than a movie. Written, directed and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is transcendant art. And The Best Picture of the Year. Maybe any year.Don't miss it.",5,Yo!

1052623,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000N3AXQU,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 8]","When Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment in the series, was announced, there was almost a unanimous cry of ""ugh"" from people. Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement.Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a ""what if"" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it.But Rocky's old age and a ""has-been"" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible.If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser.Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that ""action hero"" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of ""Adrian Part 2"" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the ""in the ring"" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene.I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original.

This final episode is basically a sentimental recapturing of a sorts of the original Rocky film.  He's now clearly ""WAY"" past his prime and it's tough to even look at him frankly.  As another reviewer very correctly stated no boxing commission anywhere would sanction such a fight (exhibition or not).  However, in true overcome-all-odds fashion Rocky somehow makes it happen.  I won't give away the results of the match because frankly the official results are unimportant and not what he's after.  He's after validation just one more time.  Validation that he still matters . . . that the fire that still burns within him means something.  Adrian believed in him and he now needs to believe in himself just one last time.  Is it a great film?  Nope.  However, it's a warm sentimental film of remembrance not only of his journey and saga but of particular meaning to many of us baby boomer's who are aging and would like just one more moment in the sun before we head off to the rocking chair.  Rocky's ""rock"" was Adrian and he pays beautiful and appropriate tribute to her as the one person who did believe in him unconditionally.  The moral is to never give up and believe in yourself regardless of age or who says you can't do something.  Thanks Mr. Stallone for making this final film.  It was a far nicer ending to the Rocky series than Rocky V as it very warmly closed the circle of magic.

When it was all over, I thought this was probably the best-made Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as ""classy,"" but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining, as far as a lot of action goes, but it is the most classy.I say this mainly for the wonderful, sweet tone to this story: a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. (Apparently ""Adrian"" died some time after the last Rocky film.) His wife's death is haunting him, which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However, interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat, look-at-the-positive side-of-people attitude. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude, it's impossible to dislike the man.For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with over-the- top villains and way overdone ring action, rest easy: you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends, family, and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography, you'll enjoy viewing this.Sad, nostalgic, yet inspiring and optimistic, I can't recall ever being so impressed with a ""Rocky"" film.

1052626,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000N3AXQU,Craig Matteson,"[4, 4]","The first Rocky film had a heart and a soul that mattered to people a lot more than the fight.  Rocky was a kind man who wanted to get through life, was unhappy about being a collector for a local loan shark, and fell in love with Adrian.  The whole Apollo Creed thing fell into his lap and changed his life forever.The spirit that made the first film a joy faded with each new film while the fighting sequences became the point of the film.  Sort of like they way the gadgets overshadowed Bond in many of the subsequent films after ""Goldfinger"".  This film is so enjoyable because it has the heart and soul of the first film and the inevitable fight (this time ostensibly an exhibition) is the right send off for the hero.The film opens later in Rocky's life.  He has experienced the one loss he could not bear well.  Yet, he has found the grace to bear up under its tremendous weight.  Paulie is still as miserable as ever, actually even angrier and in not very healthy way.  He lives in a row house just as he did in the first film and has a small restaurant that serves decent food but whose main attraction is for folks to come by and get a picture taken with Rocky and hear the champ tell his old stories for the ten thousandth time and Stallone does just the right touch on making the stories sound that way.We also see him fill some of the emotional gaps in his life in a very touching way.  Since Adrian is ever present in his heart, it is very touching to see him develop a friendship with a woman that is really a friendship and not a prelude to something that could encroach on where Rocky really is emotionally.The most wrenching relationship in the movie is between Rocky and his son.  Yes, sons do have to become their own man and it is incredibly tough to find an independent place to stand when your father was the heavyweight champion of the world and people want to know you to meet your father.  This is a very active force in Rocky's life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.  Yes, a neat trick.  The film doesn't set him as a big villain as previous Rocky films did with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.This was a very fine way to end the series and does so on a rather moving high note.",5,A very well done and moving ending to the series - more like the first Rocky than any of the others,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2435,"['first', 'Rocky', 'film', 'had', 'heart', 'soul', 'mattered', 'people', 'lot', 'more', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'was', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'life', 'was', 'unhappy', 'being', 'collector', 'local', 'loan', 'shark', 'fell', 'love', 'Adrian', 'whole', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'thing', 'fell', 'lap', 'changed', 'life', 'forever.The', 'spirit', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'joy', 'faded', 'new', 'film', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'became', 'point', 'film', 'Sort', 'way', 'gadgets', 'overshadowed', 'Bond', 'many', 'subsequent', 'films', 'Goldfinger', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'heart', 'soul', 'first', 'film', 'inevitable', 'fight', 'time', 'ostensibly', 'exhibition', 'right', 'send', 'hero.The', 'film', 'later', 'Rocky', 'life', 'experienced', 'one', 'loss', 'could', 'not', 'bear', 'well', 'found', 'grace', 'bear', 'up', 'tremendous', 'weight', 'Paulie', 'still', 'as', 'miserable', 'ever', 'actually', 'even', 'angrier', 'not', 'very', 'healthy', 'way', 'row', 'house', 'just', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'small', 'restaurant', 'decent', 'food', 'main', 'attraction', 'folks', 'come', 'get', 'picture', 'taken', 'Rocky', 'hear', 'champ', 'tell', 'old', 'stories', 'ten', 'thousandth', 'time', 'Stallone', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'making', 'stories', 'sound', 'way.We', 'also', 'see', 'fill', 'emotional', 'gaps', 'life', 'very', 'touching', 'way', 'Adrian', 'ever', 'present', 'heart', 'very', 'touching', 'see', 'develop', 'friendship', 'woman', 'really', 'friendship', 'not', 'prelude', 'something', 'could', 'encroach', 'where', 'Rocky', 'really', 'emotionally.The', 'most', 'wrenching', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'son', 'Yes', 'sons', 'do', 'have', 'become', 'own', 'man', 'incredibly', 'tough', 'find', 'independent', 'place', 'stand', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'people', 'want', 'know', 'meet', 'father', 'very', 'active', 'force', 'Rocky', 'life', 'several', 'directions', 'make', 'real', 'sense.I', 'also', 'appreciated', 'way', 'film', 'actually', 'set', 'up', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'Mason', 'Line', 'Dixon', 'very', 'capable', 'Antonio', 'Tarver', 'actually', 'creating', 'sympathy', 'making', 'unsympathetic', 'Yes', 'neat', 'trick', 'film', ""n't"", 'set', 'big', 'villain', 'previous', 'Rocky', 'films', 'did', 'Clubber', 'Lang', 'Ivan', 'Drago.This', 'was', 'very', 'fine', 'way', 'end', 'series', 'so', 'rather', 'moving', 'high', 'note']",N/A

1052628,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000N3AXQU,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[3, 3]","The entire Rocky series has been a great ride.  All of the Rocky films have been inspirational, entertaining, and of course a little predictable.Rocky Balboa is no exception, but this film has the same ""rough"" edges that made the first Rocky such a hit.Rocky is still back in Philadelphia, but now he owns an Italian restaurant (Adrian's) with Mexican cooks preparing the food.  The restaurant kind of becomes the focal point for a lot of what goes on in the film.  Well, that and Adrian's gravesite.  The scenes at both of these locations work well, and add a lot of realism to Stallone's sixth installment of the series.Sylvester Stallone and his films have always inspired me to believe in the impossible; I'm sure many people around the globe think the same.  He has been criticized for riding the success of the Rocky films, but I think the films are great.  I also consider Stallone a man who has lived a full life, giving his all to his work, his family, and himself.  He's made mistakes, but he has always accepted responsibility for his actions and moved on.Stallone had to have doubts about making Rocky Balboa.  But I noticed the people in the theater, especially the generation who grew up watching the Rocky films, seemed to be visiting a cast of old friends as they watched the film progress.The only part of the movie I thought could have been a lot better was the fight sequences between Rocky and Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).  After all of the amazing boxing matches Rocky has been in, only a match between Rocky and Godzilla would have sufficed a true Rocky fan.The best parts of the film are every single scene with Geraldine Hughes (Marie).  She absolutely steals the show with every move she makes and every word she speaks.  Whether she is telling Rocky about her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III) or giving Rocky a speech about why he should box the current champion (a crazy idea if you ask me), she is so believable that she deserves an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!Rocky fans will also be happy with Paulie's (Burt Young) return to the big screen.  Age has not made Paulie anymore of an adult, and his dialogue throughout the film reminds us why we all first fell in love with this guy - as creepy as that sounds.Rocky Balboa is not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.  It has just enough things going on in the film to keep it interesting, just enough action scenes to get your blood pumping, and just enough romance to make you wonder if Rocky and Marie get married in the never-to-be-made Rocky 7 (Rocky and Marie Balboa).At the end of the movie, the people in the theater broke out in applause.  I think men and women appreciate the hard work Stallone has put into his Rocky films.  I think they were saying goodbye to their old friend - Rocky Balboa.And I think we are all going to miss him!Bye Rocky!  It has been a blast!See ya next review.",4,A Great Way To End The Series!

1052629,A3150EZ3XD7Q7Y,B000N3AXQU,"Dan Rh ""Sci FI Fan""","[0, 4]","This is an entertaining film that far exceeds #5 in the series but falls short of the glory days (for me particularly 2 and 3 in the series).Rocky owns a restaraunt called Adrienne's.  His wife is dead for several years now, and Rocky, while successful and doing well, relives his past by revisiting his life with Adrienne too much.  It's unclear to me what drives Rocky back in the ring.  Is it his dissatisfaction with his current life?  It didn't seem to be the computerized boxing match with current champion Mason Dixon.  Rocky hardly gave it an afterthought.Dixon's character was underdone.  It would've been better if he was equally disatisfied with his life as champion.  He returns to his old gym and trainer, but that aspect of the story was under-written.  I think Stallone was trying to compare old-time athletics to new generation.  It didn't quite work.I think there should've been more animosity between Dixon and Rocky, particularly on Dixon's side.  Too much time was spent on Little Marie and her family and not enough on Dixon/Rocky and what leads them to fight.  While Little Marie was valuable to the film, it needed a little more in the way of motivation for Rocky to fight given the layoff and health risk.Tony Duke's character was underutilized as well.  The training session was among the worst of the series.  (But at least there was one unlike Rocky 5).  The fight was very good, and saves the movie.

I've read excerpts of the plot and I just saw a brief trailer furnished by Real Player.This movie could end of being closer to the original Rocky than all the other sequels thus it has real possibilities. I for one will go see it.The premise, as I understand it, the story line has sentimental tones and of course the ususal boxing action. Rocky is now widowed from his beloved Adrian. He is down on his luck and aging. (What guy over forty doesn't know what this feels like).  Balboa just wants to, as he used to call it, ham-and-egg some fights for money and self-respect. A computer simulation is created of a match between the current champion and Rocky, the old champion. Does anyone ever remember the simulation btween Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali? Same thing. In this simulation, Rocky beats the current champ and this sets the rest of the plot in motion. The younger boxer wants to prove it wrong, the promoter wants to make a quick buck and make a circus out of it and Rocky? Well, Rocky has his doubts as well as his self-pride. Thus the fight.I do not know if he wins or loses or what but, if nothing else, it should be very entertaining. Sly at 60 looks better than most guys in their 30s and I think he knows how to reach an underdog audience.So, give the guy a break and don't bash the movie before it comes out.

Well, the early reviews came out and Sylvester Stallone did the expected promotional interviews.  What I heard wetted my appetite.  Stallone was not my favorite actor but when I saw him in a film I liked him.  After renting this film the first comment I made to my wife was, ""this is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood!""  In this, the last of the series, we see for the first time an introspective and truly pained man in conflict with his past, his present and his future.  Sylvester Stallone has crafted a real story, although stretching credibility at times, but revealing the inner thoughts and emotions of a plain average Joe.  Stallone IS Rocky Balboa!  Unlike several of the in between Rockys this one is, in my mind, the best of the series.  You needn't have seen the first five to appreciate and understand this film.  The acting throughout is first rate, the production values are great, the fighting choreography is superb and for once, he has a believable ring foe in Mason Dixon, unlike the Dolf Lundgrens and Mr. T's of the past.Critics will continue to minimize the abilities and appeal of Sylvester Stallone but I put him in the same league as John Wayne who, depite every adversity that befell him, whether in World War II combat, fighting gunslingers in the old West or courting an Irish maiden in old Erin, never lost his moral compass and ultimately prevailed.

And there is no heavyweight champ--no matter how lousy his reputation is--that would agree to get into the ring with a fighter of six decades, exhibition or no exhibition.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get past the obvious before suspending my disbelief while watching ROCKY BALBOA, the final (we think) installment of the dearly beloved Rocky franchise.(Had this fight been sanctioned in some foreign country that wouldn't object to the massive risk involved--say the Philippines, or one of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula--the plot would have been more believable, but I digress.)Sylvester Stallone returns in the role he was born to play, only now he's sixty, a lonely widower, and has a son (Milo Ventimiglia) who resents living under his father's famous shadow.  Rocky, while pining away at his wife's grave, realizes he still has a burning rage inside him that must be exorcised--and only a boxing match will do the trick.  Because the video games (or whatever they're called these days) have him actually beating the current reigning champ, Mason Dixon (great fighting name, played by a stoic Antonio Tarner), why not have life imitate. . .recreation?

Everyone thinks he's nuts, except for faithful friend Little Marie, who tells him that ""fighters fight.""An astute Amazon reviewer noted that there are a lot of shadows in this movie: Rocky is living in the shadow of his glory days, the son is living in the shadow of his father, Mason Dixon is living in Rocky's shadow, even Spider Rico is living in Rocky's shadow, and Little Marie is living in Adrian's shadow (there are also a lot of shadowy scenes in the film(alleys and streetlight scenes).In a sense, Rocky himself is living in Adrian's shadow, as he struggles to move on with his life without her.Let me also say that the fight scenes were very realistic, itdefinitely has the look and feel of an HBO PPV telecast. My favoriteline is when Lampley asks Larry Merchant why they are calling thisfight an exhibition and Merchant says ""so they won't have to call it anexecution.""Yes, the movie pulls at your tear ducts: The movie begins with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian and ends with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian.

Maybe he'll score with Marty's mom?EDIT 6/4/2007MCW aka MC White responds:Well, well, well, a'int that sweet?!  You finally see the movie that you were ""positively reviewing"" before you even seen it!  Ain't that sweet?!  Well, I'm glad!  But you forgot one thing.  To ""eat"" our words, we have to agree with your words.  And agreeable, a'int how I'm feeling just about now.And I'm a big Sports movie enthusiast...by the way!I did also see this movie, finally, on DVD.  And you know what?  I thought it was very ""clickish"" and hackneyed and stereotypical.  I really did laugh a lot,... at Rocky, throughout the entire movie.  I can't believe he's still trying to paint himself as this ""castaway"" Philadelphian.  What a joke.  He owns a restaurant, and he wears a sports coat (the same one every night?) and talks to his customers every night, about being this great fighter?If I were a regular in that fictional restaurant, I'd find myself ducking, and getting very interested in my Pasta Primavera, every time I saw that lout walking towards my table, praying that we didn't make eye contact, for fear of 45 minutes of his ""dwelling on the past.""  Hell, even his brother-in-law let him have it 25 minutes into the film.  And Rocky is probably sustaining his ""alcoholic"" lifestyle with his money.I did feel his pain, regarding his dead wife.  I can only imagine how his character must have felt.  But what the hell.  Even Basketball players have awesome `cribs' and tight rides.  Why the hell is he driving around in a beat up white van?  Where's his glass house?  Did I miss something.  Did some Nigerian Banker dupe him out of his millions?  Completely unbelievable.  Sorry.  Just stupid and ridiculous!I don't know why, but I don't find myself ""feeling"" for that type of character that is Rocky, I find myself despising that type of character in films.  And you know what. I specifically remember the reviews for this movie in the San Francisco Chronicle being very similar to what I'm saying here.  Clich&eacute;d and silly.  And stupid.  I also remember Opie and Anthony lambasting the movie, and calling it weak on the radio.  I remember very few positive reviews.  At least this part of the country.I did enjoy the black and white with red blood scenes near the end.  I thought that was pretty clever, and visually appealing.  I did enjoy the fight scenes, though I though it ridiculous to see Rocky in the ring with a young fighter.  Very silly!2 stars out of 5.

It's perfectly understandable to mourn a spouse but after three years it'd have been sweet to see him just begin move on, either with Marie (too May-December?) or another nice lady.  He could even get some ""sign"" from Adrian that it's okay to move on! But, the man has always dealt with life by stepping into the ring, so there you have it.I liked how he told his son not to let anyone treat him like crap, but notice how even after seeing Robert's boss be a jerk to him, Rocky was still polite to the boss, for Robert's sake.  He's come a long way. :) Normally he'd just pound the guy into the ground.I liked the closure of a ""draw"" that ultimately goes to the other guy (just like in the very first fight with Apollo).  Because it didn't matter.  Rocky went the distance and still felt victorious.  It was that way in 1976 and it was that way this time.I liked the nostalgia, too.  It was all so bittersweet. I loved that Duke was still with him, and that he and Paulie were still close.  They both loved Adrian so, though Paulie used to be so mean to her.In summary: It's not the Feel Good Movie of the Year, and Adrian being gone is so damn sad.  And again, it would have been really nice for Rocky to have another woman in his life, in his corner. Well who knows? Maybe he does develop something with Marie! We don't know. At least she was in Vegas, playing the role of ringside female companion, cringing at the bad blows! I was glad he had that; he always had that with Adrian.The appearance, somehow, of Drago and Clubber would have been AMAZINGLY cool but I can't fathom how that would work! Tommy Gunn, too, but with BETTER HAIR! I could never get past his hair.Having Spider Rico around was an obvious attempt to wrap things up full circle (he's in the very first seen of Rocky); sort of gratuitous.Stallone's body is pretty smoking for that age, but his awful plastic surgery (facial) is VERY distracting.  I'd give my right arm to see what he and Mickey Rourke would look like had they never carved up their faces.Bottom line: Totally watchable but rent, don't buy it.

When I first heard that Stallone intended to make it I actually laughed, and thought to myself ""he's lost his bloody mind!""  I then pictured some comical scenes of an old man pounding a younger one into the mat and regaining his belt, tearing what few strands of believability that are left in the Rocky legend to shreds.I was very, very wrong.  This movie is actually more realistic than any of the films, with the possible exception of the first.  Set in the decaying city of Philadelphia, an older, widowed Rocky runs a small restaurant called ""Adrian's.""  He is haunted by memories of his glorious past, and angry at how time and age have taken both his beloved wife and his fighting prowess.At the same time we get a good look at the gentler side of the character, as he helps a struggling single mother and her son to survive, as well as others who have fallen on hard times, including an opponent from the first film, Spider Rico.When the opportunity for the fight with the current champion comes along, there is no illusion that he will actually defeat the much younger man.  He wishes only to go the distance, and so close the circle that began when he first fought Apollo Creed 30 years previous.  Does he do it?  I won't tell.There are no villains in this film.  Even his ring opponent is a noble person, an athlete/warrior who is disgusted by the lack of mettle in the current crop of fighters.  He treats Rocky respectfully, albeit with a condescending ""I'll go easy on you, pops"" attitude.Rocky's son and Paulie are returning characters as well.  Paulie struggles with his own demons, especially his regrets over the way he once treated his sister.  Rocky, Jr. appears as a young man living in his dad's very large shadow, as he seeks to carve out a career in the business world.Most touching of all is Rocky's continuing devotion to his beloved Adrian.  He visits her burial site often, bringing flowers, talking to her, or just sitting quietly beside the stone memorial in the cold and snow.The ending is most satisfying, although I would have enjoyed more resolution regarding the struggles the characters were dealing with.  Does this leave the door open for yet another sequel?  I hope not.  The film was a magnificent way to end an often far-fetched but beautifully touching story.

1052653,A3HETHW2XD3DWH,B000N3AXQU,frisky2000,"[5, 6]","There is no such thing as a ""has been"" when it comes to Rocky.  This movie was sentimental and very sad at times, and seeing him struggle with the loss of his beloved Adriane really tugged at the heartstrings.  The dialoge was REAL, filled with emotion as he tries to toughen up his son in the hard knocks that life can throw.  Through some flashbacks, we get to see Mickey (the late Burgess Meredith) and Adriane (Talia Shire) and this brought back some wonderful memories of the original ROCKY.  Though some reviewers thought the flashbacks were annoying, I actually felt they added to the film's sense of reminiscing since Rocky spends so much of his time trying to get a grip on the past and who he has become today.  Spending much of his time with his brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young) and adopting a shelter dog named Punchie, Rocky is such a lonely soul now, and you can't help but hope that he finds love again (with Little Marie) and can somehow put closure on his boxing career with this final exhibition fight.  Though being matched with heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (real life boxer, Antonio Tarver) is a bit unbelievable, it provided for some good Underdog cheering, and the inclusion of the ringside announcers from HBO's PPV line up added to the authentic feel of the fight.  I found myself really appreciating many of the lines in this film, especially when Rocky tells his son that, ""Somewhere along the line...you let other people tell you you're no good...if you know what you're worth, then go out and GET what you're worth...be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you're not where you want to be because of ""him"" or ""her"" or anybody.""

Well, friends, the guy may have aged with the rest of us but Stallone's ability to go to the heart of the character he has made an icon still is strong. As a result ROCKY BALBOA, though overly sentimental at times (which is in keeping with the Rocky we have all grown to know) plays as a show of strength not only in the boxing ring, but also in the viability of the heart.The aged Rocky runs a restaurant named after his deceased wife Adrian (who gratefully appears in flashbacks of the original Talia Shire) where he chats with his devoted customers as the still admired boxing hero of Philadelphia. His trainer Paulie (Burt Young) has aged too, but the two remain close.  Rocky also encounters a lonely single mother Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and befriends her and her racially mixed son Steps (James Francis Kelly III). Mildly estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia) who is trying to make a life for himself in his father's shadow, Rocky happens to see a spoof on television placing Rocky as the contender against the new heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver, a boxer who was groomed as an actor for this film), a fighter who lacks soul and seems to foretell the end of passionate boxing. With such a huge support group Rocky decides to train and actually compete, fighting Dixon with multiple incentives. The ending demonstrates the power of willpower and the greater power of humanity and love because 'you gotta keep movin' forward'.ROCKY BALBOA, then, is a fine finish for a series of films that have gained a permanent place in the history of cinema.  It is a pleasure to see Sylvester Stallone act and direct a very fine cast of actors in a genuinely satisfying film.  There are many worthwhile messages with the frames of this old-fashioned movie.

1052663,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000N3AXQU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","In 1976, an unknown and struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone wrote an underdog boxing fable and somehow convinced the powers that be to allow him to be cast in the starring role. The success of the film (modest box office hit, Oscar wins for Best Movie and Directing) garnered four sequels of varying quality before the franchise was put in hiatus for 17 years. But, now, at last, the 60-year-old Stallone, feeling his oats again and desiring one last hurrah, brings to a close the Rocky Balboa saga.SPOILERS and a few boxing trivia follow here: If you're any sort of boxing fan, then you know that the heavyweight class has been in steady decline for a number of years now; it's just been fairly recently that Wladimir Klitschko has been imposing his dominance over the sundry contenders/pretenders. ROCKY BALBOA borrows from the real-life lack of an undisputed, linear heavyweight champ and transposes it somewhat onto its movie premise. In the plot, undefeated and current heavyweight champion Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (real life light heavyweight pugilist Antonio Tarver) has been knocking out his opponents for a while now but, because of the lack of depth in his weight class and the absence of a fighter who could truly test him, he's considered to be a dubious champion by fans and boxing pundits. Even an ESPN computer simulation refuses to show him respect as it pits him versus a past champion in Rocky Balboa; to add insult to injury, the computer even has Balboa knocking out Dixon. Dixon's manager, who is well aware of his client's prevailing unpopularity, hits on the idea of putting on an exhibition match between Dixon (33 wins, 0 losses, 30 knockouts) and Rocky Balboa (57 wins, 22 losses, 28 knockouts). And, speaking of Rocky...With the loss of his wife and anchor, Adrian, to cancer, ex-prizefighter Rocky Balboa, now 58 years in age, has basically been just drifting. He spends much of his time missing Adrian and, every year, on the anniversary of her passing, he frequents their old hangouts, much to the distress and disgust of his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who is as unpolitically correct and irascible as ever. Rocky owns and runs Adrian's, a nice, little Italian restaurant, and amuses the customers by regaling them with his fight experiences and accomodating them with photo ops. When Rocky catches a glimpse of the same virtual match on ESPN, his aged motor gets going; he begins to mull over the idea of re-entering the ring and fighting in small, local bouts. Somehow, against everyone's wishes (including and especially his overshadowed son, Robert), he's even granted a boxing license. Dixon's manager and promoter approach him with the offer to fight a 10-round exhibition bout (but with no protective gear) with the current champ; this  challenge proves to be too much for Rocky to resist as he still harbors a ""beast"" inside of him.The rest of the movie goes on to depict the by now expected montage of training sessions - including the traditional sprint up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and culminates in the highly anticipated match, where Rocky is considered a massive underdog. Even with the fans solidly behind him and chanting out his name, Rocky is hard pressed to beat a champion who's reigning and defending his crown in the prime of his life. In the end, as usual, it goes down to heart, as Mason Dixon finally finds the defining test he's been looking for and Rocky seeks to tame the savage beast within him one final time. I won't say who wins, but let me put it this way: Rocky exits on his own terms.Rocky Balboa is, without a doubt, the quintessential underdog, and, obviously, is one of the most universally beloved cinematic creations of our time. The city of Philadelphia has taken the Rocky character on as one of its very own citizens. Rocky, for 30 years now, has simply resonated within the souls of the populace and it's easy to see why. The man isn't too bright, though he does have a certain street savvy and has become wiser over the years. He's innately lovable - a big palooka who works hard and is intrinsically true to himself. He's very rootable. In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone returns his iconic character to his roots, the seamy neighborhoods of Philly peopled with blue-collared Joes. This film is predominantly a series of low key character-driven scenes, one after the other, punched up, every now and then, by Balboa's occasional impassioned speeches (you could see Sly straining for the Oscar), until the big, showy brawl at the end. We get to hear and ponder Rocky's gravelly, ineloquently vocalized homespun philosophies and realize that, while Rocky's no brain surgeon, he's smart enough to know what matters most in life, a nugget of wisdom he imparts to his unfulfilled and whiny son, as played annoyingly by the plastically smouldering Milo Ventimiglia (who also isn't exactly my most favorite character in HEROES), whose turnaround to his father's side happens too rapidly for my taste. Yes, the pace is deliberate and, at times, threatens to plod. A lot of the flashbacks shown in the first half hour will certainly test the patience of folks unaware of the Rocky history. I even found some of the old clips too much to take as I wanted the movie to advance already. But, in the end, Sly knew what he was doing as these quiet moments do serve to make Rocky's last time in the ring heartachingly more resonant.The other actors aren't shabby. Burt Young inhabits Paulie from such a deep, personal place that I really can't picture him in any other kind of role. Antonio Tarver (who, by the by, after this movie, went on to decisively lose his very next bout to the elderly, blown-up heavyweight Bernard Hopkins) is decent enough as Rocky's boxing foil, although the script doesn't really call for him to stretch as an actor. Geraldine Hughes takes over Jodi Letizia's role as Little Marie, who reappears after 30 years. Little Marie was the girl who told Rocky, ""Screw you, creepo!"" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play. Marie, apparently, didn't listen to Rocky's advise from way back and has become a single mom with very low self-esteem. We'll never know if a romance will develop between her and Rocky but we are assured of a blooming friendship between the two. Hughes' deft portrayal of the wounded Marie makes you wish good things to happen for her. Unfortunately, not much can be said of the actor who plays her son, Steps, as the audience never really gets a chance to know him.It was nice to see actual folks in the flick who are major players in the world of boxing. Credibility is lent with the appearances of ESPN's Brian Kenny (who's had his own verbal battles with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.), the HBO boxing commentary crew (Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Max Kellerman), announcer Michael Buffer (""Let's get ready to rumble!""), ref Joe Cortez (who really does say ""Remember, guys, I'm fair but I'm firm""), promoter Lou Dibella, and the cigar toting boxing historian Bert Sugar.Of course, this movie ain't perfect. The plot tends to drag at times, not enough time is spent working on Mason Dixon's character (although his relationship with his former trainer proves to be surprisingly touching), and I find it vexing that not one mention is made about the brain damage Rocky incurred in ROCKY V.So is ROCKY BALBOA as good as the first ROCKY? No, not by a mile. But, while it doesn't live up to my high expectations, it certainly contains enough graceful moments which affected me at a deep enough gut level that I can honestly recommend it. Needless to say, this movie is best experienced in a rambunctiously crowded theater with folks who are all in the know about the Rocky films. I guarantee you ROCKY BALBOA'll serve up a nice, warm slug of nostalgia. Like I said, the movie's pace is leisurely so take the time to savor the scenes as there won't be any more after this. ROCKY BALBOA is a fitting capper to what has been an iconic film series. By the way, in an interview on a radio sports show, Stallone made mention that he would like another crack at John Rambo with the intention of making the next movie more character driven as well, as opposed to the last two action oriented sequels.

1052665,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B000N3AXQU,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","After recently viewing ""Rocky Balboa,"" I will cut right to the chase: Sylvester Stallone impressed me with this movie.  Having seen more than a few of his truly awful, non-""Rocky"" movies over the past three decades, this is not something I will say lightly.  It's true that Mr. Stallone squeezed the life's blood out of the ""Rocky"" franchise in the five films from 1976 to 1990, as solid, melodramatic plots about how hope, hard work, and raw determination can make seemingly impossible dreams happen gave way to crowd pleasing, music video training montages preceding the victorious Rocky's climactic knockout punch of his latest gimmicky challenger.  At last, Sylvester Stallone vindicates the ""Rocky"" franchise (16 years after the disappointing ""Rocky V"") by resurrecting the Italian Stallion for a final shot at glory and to hopefully bring some closure to his broken heart.It is now a far different Philadelphia in 2006, as a widowed Rocky appears utterly lost without his beloved wife, Adrian, who died five years before of cancer.  This is by far Stallone's best and most sincere acting performance in decades portraying a now-sixtyish, mentally sluggish Rocky as a small South Philly restaurateur who welcomes old friends and foes with equal grace (i.e. ""Spider"" Rico from film I).  Enter an old acquaintance, Little Marie (also from film I), and her teenage son, Steps, who join Rocky's world as new friends and surrogate family to help fill the void while Rocky's adult son, Robert (Rocky Jr.), struggles with his dad's fame overshadowing his fragile new career in the corporate world. Then, there is his cranky brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young), who is working again at the meat packing plant and remains Rocky's kindred spirit.  Despite limited screen time, Young's performance as usual is top-notch, as Paulie's presence poignantly helps link viewers to the original film's humble origins.Meanwhile, undefeated (and un-respected) World Heavyweight Champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fuming over losing an ESPN virtual reality ""what if"" match to the ""Italian Stallion"" in his prime.  Much like Apollo Creed before him, Dixon eventually realizes that a showdown with Balboa is the likely antidote to salvage his professional image.  Conveniently enough, an increasingly restless Balboa gradually decides that he has at least one more fight left in him (essentially, sparring matches with local club fighters).  The dejected Rocky's confrontation scene with the Pennsylvania State Boxing Commission is nothing short of superb in reiterating the steep odds Rocky must now face once he accepts Dixon's challenge.The subsequent (but far too short) training build-up to the big PPV 10-round exhibition match in Las Vegas is pure ""Rocky"" formula.  In another echo to the franchise's former glory days, actor Tony Burton returns as Rocky's coach, Duke, but his presence is sadly underdeveloped.  Although only seen in a few flashbacks, Talia Shire's absence surprisingly is an asset, as Rocky's slow, heartbreaking transition of moving into old age alone is treated with respect and character-driven depth.  Stallone sincerely conveys why Adrian will always be Rocky's guiding light, even as he finally accepts that his life must still go on (as seen in the film's uplifting final frames).  As for the franchise's new characters, the acting ensemble sufficiently holds its own against the noticeable absence of Shire, Carl Weathers, and the late Burgess Meredith.Finally, for me, the best sequence comes early, as a melancholic Rocky wistfully drives an impatient Paulie on another annual tour of the South Philly locales where Rocky courted Adrian during film I.  It is a heavy dose of effective maudlin by contrasting Rocky & Adrian's touching early romance with Rocky's (and Paulie's) bleak present-day reality.  Add in Bill Conti's classic, touching score and the ghostly soft filter lense shots of a dark, rainy modern Philadelphia to this sequence, and one will honestly believe that Stallone is capable of making true movie magic once more.My Score: 8/10.  This poignant film is simply fantastic in most respects by expertly combining signature Rocky elements (the original score, the Philly locales, a sincere homage to the early films) with glossy 21st Century cinematography.  The script's eventually tiresome putdowns by multiple characters about Rocky's advancing age are perhaps the film's worst offense.P.S.  The special features include a satisfactory, alternate ending (among the available deleted scenes), which demonstrates that Stallone made the right call for the fight's plausible outcome in the theatrical release.",4,"""Rocky Balboa"" is a Nostalgic Blast to the Past",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,4660,"['recently', 'viewing', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'will', 'cut', 'right', 'chase', 'Sylvester',

1052671,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B000N3AXQU,Jason A. Miller,"[3, 3]","To put things in perspective, when the original ""Rocky"" came out, my wife was still three years away from being born.  That's 30 years Stallone has been playing this Rocky Balboa.  I grew up with the first two films on endless TV reruns and saw the later ones in the theater.  My nostalgia-fueled anticipation for tonight's premiere was akin to the thrill I felt for the final ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, or for ""Superman Returns"", or even for the misbegotten Chronicles of Narnia movie last year.  Literally I've been waiting decades to see this movie.  ""Rocky V"" bombed when I was still in high school and I was hoping Rocky would get one last chance to knock out evil boxers with ridiculous ring nicknames.My advice is that you'll need to see this movie in a packed theater, as I did.  I can't imagine it would have the same effect on the small screen when you're alone with a much smaller crowd.  In many ways, the best part of this film was the spontaneous call-and-response from the audience I was with, two storeys beneath 3rd Avenue.  People shouted famous ""Rocky"" catchphrases at the screen seconds before the famous fanfare started playing.  ""I pity the fool!"", ""I will break you!"", ""If he dies, he dies!"", and, of course, ""Mickey!!""Once all the pre-movie nostalgia was out of the way... it was time for more nostalgia.  Wisely or not, Stallone (who wrote and directed) soaked the first half of the script in nostalgia so deep for the first, small-scale ""Rocky"", that significant screen time was devoted to characters who hadn't appeared since the original's second reel.  I had to explain to my wife who Spider Rico was, and why Rocky needed him in his inner circle by the end of the movie.  Also great to see the return Duke, Apollo Creed's old trainer, although most of Tony Burton's lines appear to have been looped in post-production.The main problem with ""Rocky Balboa"" early on is Stallone's concept of dialogue.  Just about every character in this movie delivers a loud speech about motivation and glory and drive and passion.  Rocky's defense of his application for a boxing permit to the State athletic commission (after 20 years of retirement) is particularly ludicrous, although Stallone must think it's going to cap off the montage for his Lifetime Achievement Oscar.Once the nostalgia and flashbacks clears out and the plot settles in, the film picks up steam.  Antonio Tarver does a decent job as Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the brazen young champ at odds with the boxing establishment.  Dixon never really becomes a villain in this movie -- he even has a Rocky/Mickey relationship with his own trainer.Also welcome are the numerous cable TV personality cameos.  Everyone from ESPN's Brian Kenny to ESPN Classic's Bert Randolph Sugar to the entire HBO fight team (Merchant and Lampley and I, Max) chips in; too bad Jim Rome got left on the cutting room floor.  The only thing missing from the celebrity bandwagon was Randy and Jason Sklar doing ""Cheap Seats"" commentary over the Rocky vs. Thunderlips celebrity boxing/wrestling match.  Maybe in a deleted scene on DVD?In the end, ""Rocky Balboa""'s a fun nostalgia trip that echoes the original in tone and sentiment, and even has a similar bittersweet finale.  This is never going to become a TNT rerun classic like ""Rocky III"" and probably has no catchphrases of its own, but if Rocky's been one of your movie heroes since the 1970s, check him out one last time.",4,"""You're a crazy old man.""

He's living alone as a result of his wife's passing, and he uses his daily hours taking care of the needs of his restaurant, named in honor of his late wife. For Rocky, however, just getting by is not enough, just going through life is not enough. The fire still burns within.He slowly lets the news leak out to his son and Paulie that he'd like to fight again. Neither seems to receptive. Hell, even the Boxing Commission is against it. But then a computer generated fight in which Rocky KOs the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (played by real boxer Antonio Tarver), gets the wheels in motion for Rocky 5 (take two).It's a joke of a fight, nobody expects Rocky to have a chance. Everyone is counting him out, even his family. Rocky still believes, and he proves his point, and his life's motto, by telling his son that life is not about how hard one can hit; but, instead, it's about how hard one can be hit, and keep moving forward.The first half of the movie is a bit slow, building up the drama and tension.

It may be fun to see some familiar faces for awhile, but then you realize after about a half an hour that your glad you've moved on to new friends and possibilities. I absolutely loved the first four Rocky films, so don't take me for a Rocky hater, I'm far from one. But Rocky Balboa is not a good film. The pacing is slow and boring, the story is way past played out and the final fight scene contains the least amount of actual ""fighting"" that I have ever seen in a Rocky film. Antonio Tarver is the worst ""villain"" as he is basically devoid of any emotion in this film. There is no real beef between him and Rocky. On the whole the story line is utterly ridiculous and even though I tried to tell myself that this is just a movie, I still couldn't get past some of the nonsense. For instance, in this ""exhibition"" match for charity, if one of these men were knocked down twice in one round the fight would have been stopped. No exhibition fight would ever go the distance with it's participants cut and bleeding. So be prepared to suspend your belief in reality for the 1:42 minute running time of this film. It's clear that Stallone was unhappy with the way the series was ended (Rocky V was an utter train wreck), so he has basically come back to finish the series with some class and dignity. The question is...who cares? Some people will I'm sure, but I guess I'm way past the point of caring.

1052675,A2CB0DNKYCIQE8,B000N3AXQU,J. C. Amos,"[2, 3]","Thankfully, they didn't decide to name this movie Rocky VI, so we can forget that the fifth one ever happened.  This unexpectedly good followup (but hopefully finale) to the Rocky saga is a real treat.In the first two Rocky movies we had the real story.  A rags to riches fighter dealing with family and money and fame.  Sure it's simple and plays like a soap opera, but it's the simplicity of it all that's great.  The fighting was about dignity and pride.Rocky three, while perhaps the most fun of the franchise, can't be taken as seriously.  Pitting Hulk Hogan and Mr T. against Rocky was entertaining, but pretty much just fluff.  And Rocky IV was way too cheesy for me.With Rocky Balboa, you can forget all the pro wrestlers and the Russian steroid driven He-Men.  The soul is back.  Here we have Rocky dealing with his dead wife, his relationship with his son and making corny but heartful motivational speeches to his loved ones around him.  Surprisingly, it all works really well.  Even before the actual fight takes place, or is even proposed, it's hard not to be sucked up into Rocky's story of hardship in Philidelphia.The fight that takes place is between the old retired champ and a cocky young fighter, Dixon, who wants to use the match to gain popularity.  Dixon encourages Rocky to keep the fight simple so he can lose with dignity, but of course Rocky has none of it.  Here he is out to shed the demons of his past and prove to himself one last time that it was all worthwhile.Overall, this movie was really good; a great last harrah for the frachnise.  Did this movie need to be made?  Probably not, but with a bitter taste left in our mouths from V, it's good to have a real finale to this saga.  The fight itself was good, but a little by the numbers and not as gritty or edge of your seat as we've seen from previous outtings, which really is the only reason for the missing star.  But I recommend this to fans of the franchise and welcome it in my collection.",4,'Rocky Balboa' puts the soul back into the franchise,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,1981,"['Thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'name', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'VI', 'can', 'forget', 'fifth', 'one', 'ever', 'happened', 'unexpectedly', 'good', 'followup', 'hopefully', 'finale', 'Rocky', 'saga', 'real', 'treat.In', 'first', 'two', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'had', 'real', 'story', 'rags', 'riches', 'fighter', 'dealing', 'family', 'money', 'fame', 'Sure', 'simple', 'plays', 'soap', 'opera', 'simplicity', 'great', 'fighting', 'was', 'dignity', 'pride.Rocky', 'three', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fun', 'franchise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Pitting', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Mr', 'T.', 'Rocky', 'was', 'entertaining', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'fluff', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'cheesy', 'me.With', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'can', 'forget', 'pro', 'wrestlers', 'Russian', 'steroid', 'driven', 'He-Men', 'soul', 'back', 'Here', 'have', 'Rocky', 'dealing', 'dead', 'wife', 'relationship', 'son', 'making', 'corny', 'heartful', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'loved', 'ones', 'Surprisingly', 'really', 'well', 'Even', 'actual', 'fight', 'place', 'even', 'proposed', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'sucked', 'up', 'Rocky', 'story', 'hardship', 'Philidelphia.The', 'fight', 'place', 'old', 'retired', 'champ', 'cocky', 'young', 'fighter', 'Dixon', 'who', 'use', 'match', 'gain', 'popularity', 'Dixon', 'Rocky', 'keep', 'fight', 'simple', 'can', 'lose', 'dignity', 'course', 'Rocky', 'none', 'Here', 'out', 'shed', 'demons', 'past', 'prove', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'worthwhile.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'great', 'last', 'harrah', 'frachnise', 'Did', 'movie', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'Probably', 'not', 'bitter', 'taste', 'left', 'mouths', 'V', 'good', 'have', 'real', 'finale', 'saga', 'fight', 'was', 'good', 'little', 'numbers', 'not', 'gritty', 'edge', 'seat', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'outtings', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'missing', 'star', 'recommend', 'fans', 'franchise', 'welcome', 'collection']",N/A

But then a good friend of mine stated, `I think he still has something to say'.  And you know what?  He actually did.Don't get me wrong, I knew Stallone had talent.  After all, he scribed all the Rocky movies (the first won an Oscar), and directed 2, 3 and 4.  Leaving the fifth to the director of the original.  I can't blame him for wanting to make one more movie (lets hope it's only one more) after the travesty of the fifth movie.  Something was definitely lost in the translation.  This is a beloved character for him and he obviously wanted to set things right.Rocky Balboa is most certainly a return to the roots of the original movie and character.  Where a man overcomes all negative odds with heart and belief in himself.  Stallone takes the reigns and makes sure this movie came out the way it should.  An aged Rocky is now suffering the loss of  Adrian, a distant relationship with his son and just getting older.  Everything in his town is changing and even though he seems to be taking it all in stride, there are moments where he is obviously having trouble dealing with it all.When a computer generated `Fantasy Fight' is broadcast on ESPN pitting Rocky (in his prime) against the current champ Mason Dixon, the buzz turns into full blown demand for an actual fight.  The plot is pretty predictable from that point on, the inevitable is going to happen and Rocky ends up in the ring.  But you still find yourself rooting for him with everything you can, even though the guy he's fighting isn't someone you want to hate like the last three movies.After a decade of flopping mediocre movies that he got paid WAAAYYY too much money for (Assassins, The Specialist, Driven) Stallone has been humbled, and seems to be trying to get some dignity back.

1052678,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000N3AXQU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","When I first heard about a new Rocky movie, like everyone else, I thought it was a bad idea. Make that a terrible idea. Forget his age, didn't anyone remember ""Rocky V""? It wasn't popular. The ""Rocky"" franchise was dead after that film. Even though it wasn't an awful film, it wasn't good either. So, when Stallone made his big announcement of the new one, I greeted it with the same enthusiasm as any Stallone film. I just wasn't interested. After a lot of positive reviews for the new one, ""Rocky Balboa,"" I decided see it.""Rocky Balboa"" works and its a terrific film. Stallone wrote and directed it, and he does a great job. And not just with the fighting scenes. Believe it or not, the whole training and boxing scenes take up a small part of the film. The whole first half is just Rocky being Rocky. He visits Adrian's grave and the places where they used to spend time together. The film makes excellent use of the Philadelphia locations. From the little run down corner bars, the burned out houses, the city is as much a character in the film as Rocky is. There is a scene where Rocky stands on a street corner talking to someone, and the way he uses the locations is just perfect.I was kind of worried about Milo playing his son. Since he played Jess on ""Gilmore Girls,"" I was worried he would be very Jess like, whining, and all surly and angry. And while his character starts out that way, he grows quite a bit. The relationship between he and his father is handled extremely well. And I especially liked the other relationship between Rocky and little Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a bartender he meets who he had met years before when she was a kid. While not a romance from the start, since he still is not over Adrian, this is one of the strongest parts of the film. Rocky befriends her and her son. Hughes gave a really nice performance in the film. In looking over her filmography, it looks like this is the first major role she has had.But, then there is Stallone. His last few movies have gone direct to video. I hope this changes that. I never expected to think he had this film in him. At 105 minutes, this is one of the shortest films this year.

1052679,A3EAI032S3EBBK,B000N3AXQU,"Jerry Parks ""USAToday All-American Teacher; N...","[4, 7]","Before I saw this movie, I asked myself 'who will this movie appeal to?' For old folks (such as myself), this iteration of Rocky might make me realize just how old we both are  (not a pleasant thought). To the younger generation, it might make them wonder why this movie needed to be made at all. After seeing the film, there is still no answer to my question.The film is classic 'Rocky'. There are the endearing qualities of Rocky the man (such as referring to a Jamaican as  `a European') as well as the typical character witticisms we've come to love over the last thirty years. There is also Rocky's fondness for a former boxer (Spider Rico) he once fought (but not near the character development we saw with Apollo Creed).We see familiar faces and places, such as Adrian (in flashback) whom Rocky visits regularly at the cemetery, Bert Young (as Paulie), and of course, the steps of the Philadelphia Museum (the end credits were a nice touch). There's even a cameo by Mike Tyson. But for most of the film Rocky is bemoaning the departed Adrian. It is almost pathetic to watch him visit memorable sites they once shared, such as the ice rink, which is no longer there. Enough already.The movie is replete with 'shadows'. Rocky--living in the shadow of his former greatness--reduced to reliving the stories of fights long past. Rocky's son--now an inept businessman--living in the shadow of his father's legend. And Rocky's new love interest (wonderfully played by Irish actress Geraldine Hughes whose Philly brogue hides her strong accent)--living in the shadow of Adrian, with a son old enough to soon make her a grandmother. (Has it really been this long?)To summarize the plot, Rocky still has a 'something in his basement' to exorcise the beast within (presumably to fight again). Mason Dixon is an unpopular heavyweight champ who (again presumably) would benefit from a fight with Rocky, after a computer fight has the Rock knocking him out. And so, the stage is set: the 'up-and-coming' Dixon will battle 'has been', Rocky. The match is arranged as a glorified exhibition, and Rocky must prove that 'the heart is the last thing to go'.We're left to wonder, however, how this young boxer has anything to gain when he has everything to lose--a point cogently made in the film. This plot flaw--along with the absolutely 'goes nowhere' love interest--seriously cripples the movie.But what this movie really lacks is believability, and the build-up we've come to expect toward pulling for the Rock to upset an opponent we love to hate. Mason Dixon never convinces us that he truly wants to destroy Rocky, or that he is unable to do so when he finally gets the chance. (The writers obviously anticipated this credibility issue, and the fighter breaks his hand.) Also, this fighter creates nowhere near the fight anticipation Ivan Drago created in Rocky IV. There is simply no hate between the rivals, and even in the fight, we wonder who will win more than we really care.In the end, (without giving it away) let's say Rocky is mercifully retired forever. To their credit, the writers did not create an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable movie. As much as many of us loved the old films, we could not help but cringe when the Rock finally bears his chest. He is old, wrinkled, and fat. This time he cannot make us believe he should be in that ring, much less make us believe he could survive what happens in it. In previous Rocky movies, the fight piqued our suspense, and the ending made us cheer. In this one, we are left to merely endure the fight, and simply wish it over so we can see what novelty ending the writers will provide us this time.I loved the old 'Rocky's'. But like most fighters he stayed for one fight too many. This movie made me feel really old and tired. Mercifully, ran less than a couple of hours, and I will always have the old Rocky movies when I need inspiration rather than a spoon of Geritol.",3,"""Stretches believability....oh why did the Rock stay one fight too long?""",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3930,"['saw', 'movie', 'asked', ""'who"", 'will', 'movie', 'appeal', 'old', 'folks', 'such', 'iteration', 'Rocky', 'might', 'make', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'not', 'pleasant', 'thought', 'younger', 'generation', 'might', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'seeing', 'film', 'still', 'answer', 'question.The', 'film', 'classic', ""'Rocky"", 'are', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'Rocky', 'man', 'such', 'referring', 'Jamaican', 'European', 'as', 'well', 'typical', 'character', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'also', 'Rocky', 'fondness', 'former', 'boxer', 'Spider', 'Rico', 'once', 'fought', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'saw', 'Apollo', 'Creed', '.We', 'see', 'familiar', 'places', 'such', 'Adrian', 'flashback', 'whom', 'Rocky', 'regularly', 'cemetery', 'Bert', 'Young', 'Paulie', 'course', 'steps', 'Philadelphia', 'Museum', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'even', 'cameo', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'most', 'film', 'Rocky', 'bemoaning', 'departed', 'Adrian', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'watch', 'visit', 'memorable', 'sites', 'once', 'shared', 'such', 'ice', 'rink', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'Enough', 'already.The', 'movie', 'replete', ""'shadows"", 'Rocky', 'living', 'shadow', 'former', 'greatness', 'reduced', 'reliving', 'stories', 'fights', 'long', 'past', 'Rocky', 'son', 'now', 'inept', 'businessman', 'living', 'shadow', 'father', 'legend', 'Rocky', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Irish', 'actress', 'Geraldine', 'Hughes', 'Philly', 'brogue', 'strong', 'accent', 'living', 'shadow', 'Adrian', 'son', 'old', 'enough', 'soon', 'make', 'grandmother', 'really', 'been', 'long', 'summarize', 'plot', 'Rocky', 'still', ""'something"", 'basement', 'exorcise', 'beast', 'presumably', 'fight', 'again', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'unpopular', 'heavyweight', 'champ', 'who', 'again', 'presumably', 'would', 'benefit', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'computer', 'fight', 'Rock', 'knocking', 'out', 'so', 'stage', 'set', ""'up-and-coming"", 'Dixon', 'will', 'battle', ""'has"", 'been', 'Rocky', 'match', 'arranged', 'glorified', 'exhibition', 'Rocky', 'must', 'prove', ""'the"", 'heart', 'last', 'thing', ""go'.We"", ""'re"", 'left', 'wonder', 'however', 'how', 'young', 'boxer', 'anything', 'gain', 'when', 'everything', 'lose', 'point', 'cogently', 'made', 'film', 'plot', 'flaw', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'love', 'interest', 'seriously', 'movie.But', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'believability', 'build-up', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'pulling', 'Rock', 'upset', 'opponent', 'love', 'hate', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'never', 'destroy', 'Rocky', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'finally', 'chance', 'writers', 'obviously', 'anticipated', 'credibility', 'issue', 'fighter', 'hand', 'Also', 'fighter', 'nowhere', 'fight', 'anticipation', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'created', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'simply', 'hate', 'rivals', 'even', 'fight', 'wonder', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'more', 'really', 'care.In', 'end', 'giving', 'away', 'let', 'say', 'Rocky', 'mercifully', 'retired', 'forever', 'credit', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'unbelievable', 'ending', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'As', 'much', 'many', 'loved', 'old', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'cringe', 'when', 'Rock', 'finally', 'chest', 'old', 'wrinkled', 'fat', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'ring', 'much', 'less', 'make', 'believe', 'could', 'survive', 'what', 'previous', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'fight', 'piqued', 'suspense', 'ending', 'made', 'cheer', 'one', 'are', 'left', 'merely', 'endure', 'fight', 'simply', 'wish', 'over', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'novelty', 'ending', 'writers', 'will', 'provide', 'time.I', 'loved', 'old', 'most', 'fighters', 'stayed', 'one', 'fight', 'too', 'many', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'really', 'old', 'tired', 'Mercifully', 'ran', 'less', 'couple', 'hours', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'old', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'when', 'need', 'inspiration', 'rather', 'spoon', 'Geritol']",N/A
1052680,A680RUE1FDO8B,B000N3AXQU,Jerry Saperstein,"[1, 1]","Sylvester Stallone has always been underrated by many, but his characterizations of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo will outlive him and the rest of us. Sure, there were failures in the series, but the originals were classic.With ""Rocky Balboa"", Stallone acknowledges saying goodbye to the character he created thirty years earlier. And it is a fine, heart-tugging send off. I doubt, though, that it will work for anyone who hasn't seen the original ""Rocky"", because the main movie figures so prominently.Rocky is long past his prime. His beloved Adrian died of ""woman's cancer"" a few years ago and Rocky pines for her every day. Stallone's script is particularly touching in this regard as Rocky visits the cemetery where he has a folding chair stashed, so he can sit and visit graveside with Adrian. Pauly, Adrian's obnoxious brother, is still around, obnoxiously played by Burt Young who seems born to the role.Rocky's life is empty. Yes, he has what appears to be a successful restaurant, named ""Adrian's"", where like many sports celebrities before him, he regales patrons with stories of his glory days. His son, unconvincingly portrayed by someone whose name I've forgotten, is embarassed by his father's fame and is trying to just make his own way in the business world.  Rocky visits the old neighborhood and is dismayed to see that things are changing, decaying really, getting old just like the Rock.Rocky finds a shy romantic interest in the grown-up girl who sassed him in the first ""Rocky"".But the real story involves Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the reigning heavyweight champion who has an image problem: people think that he has acheived his title not because of his boxing skills, but because his slick promoters line up weak opponents. A local sports show has an ongoing debate over whether Rocky in his prime could have beaten Mason Dixon. Yes, they say and they have a computerized animation to prove it.This sparks the idea of an ""exhibition"" match between the young Dixon and the aging Rocky. The spectacle of 60 year old Rocky Balboa training to fight the youthful Dixon becomes the meat of the movie and is, frankly, moving, recalling the original ""Rocky"". (Seeing the againg Stallone's over-muscled physique, however, borders on the grotesque.)The culmination is the fight between the two - and it is beautifully choreographed.In the end, ""Rocky Balboa"" echos all the human qualities that made the original ""Rocky"" so appealing. The battle of the underdog doesn't lose its appeal, especially in Stallone's very talented hands.Jerry",5,A fitting end to one of the great movie franchises,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,2547,"['Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'always', 'been', 'underrated', 'many', 'characterizations', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'John', 'Rambo', 'will', 'outlive', 'rest', 'Sure', 'were', 'failures', 'series', 'originals', 'were', 'classic.With', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Stallone', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'character', 'created', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'fine', 'heart-tugging', 'send', 'doubt', 'though', 'will', 'work', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'Rocky', 'main', 'movie', 'figures', 'so', 'prominently.Rocky', 'long', 'prime', 'beloved', 'Adrian', 'died', 'woman', 'cancer', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Rocky', 'pines', 'day', 'Stallone', 'script', 'particularly', 'touching', 'regard', 'Rocky', 'cemetery', 'where', 'folding', 'chair', 'stashed', 'can', 'sit', 'visit', 'graveside', 'Adrian', 'Pauly', 'Adrian', 'obnoxious', 'brother', 'still', 'around', 'obnoxiously', 'played', 'Burt', 'Young', 'who', 'born', 'role.Rocky', 'life', 'empty', 'Yes', 'what', 'be', 'successful', 'restaurant', 'named', 'Adrian', 'where', 'many', 'sports', 'celebrities', 'patrons', 'stories', 'glory', 'days', 'son', 'unconvincingly', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'name', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'embarassed', 'father', 'fame', 'trying', 'just', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'business', 'world', 'Rocky', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'dismayed', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'changing', 'decaying', 'really', 'getting', 'old', 'just', 'Rock.Rocky', 'shy', 'romantic', 'interest', 'grown-up', 'girl', 'who', 'sassed', 'first', 'Rocky', 'real', 'story', 'Mason', 'Line', 'Dixon', 'reigning', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'who', 'image', 'problem', 'people', 'think', 'acheived', 'title', 'not', 'boxing', 'skills', 'slick', 'promoters', 'line', 'up', 'weak', 'opponents', 'local', 'sports', 'show', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'Rocky', 'prime', 'could', 'have', 'beaten', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'Yes', 'say', 'have', 'computerized', 'animation', 'prove', 'it.This', 'idea', 'exhibition', 'match', 'young', 'Dixon', 'aging', 'Rocky', 'spectacle', '60', 'year', 'old', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'training', 'fight', 'youthful', 'Dixon', 'meat', 'movie', 'frankly', 'moving', 'recalling', 'original', 'Rocky', 'Seeing', 'againg', 'Stallone', 'over-muscled', 'physique', 'however', 'borders', 'grotesque', 'culmination', 'fight', 'two', 'beautifully', 'choreographed.In', 'end', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'echos', 'human', 'qualities', 'made', 'original', 'Rocky', 'so', 'appealing', 'battle', 'underdog', ""n't"", 'lose', 'appeal', 'especially', 'Stallone', 'very', 'talented', 'hands.Jerry']",N/A
1052681,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000N3AXQU,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 2]","Sylvester Stallone is back for the 6th time as Rocky Balboa. Yes he's old which had many people including myself making fun of the fact that he was doing another. Yet Stallone manages to pull it off anyway. It's about him trying to prove that he's a somebody yet again. Since spectators try to say he was over-rated and that a famous boxer of today would destroy him. A computer fight shows that Rocky would win but not many people actually agree with it. The movie isn't all about the fight though. It's about Rocky trying to move on after the death of his beloved wife Adrian and trying to get back into the life of his son. It's also about as smart as the first one.I always have found myself thinking about the girl he gave advice about not smoking in part 1. She's even back in this one and Rocky is looking out for her once again. The movie could've easily have given us a romance between the two but Stallone's script is smart enough to know that Rocky could probably never get with another woman after Adrian. So they just have a little innocent flirtation thing going on.The movie is good but I don't think there's even any mention of the fact that he had a serious concussion after his fight in part 4. Which is why he was even retired in the first place since another fight would've risked brain damage. But who cares really since it's nice to see Stallone and Burt Young on screen together one last time anyway. The film wasn't needed that much but still it's a respectful reunion with Stallone giving his best performance in awhile. Rocky doesn't only make a great comeback but so does Stallone since before this he has been making made for dvd movies for a few years now. I think he's going a little too far by making a Rambo 4 though...lol.

Paulie said (and I paraphrase), ""tonight get it out of your system once and for all"". He was referring to the stuff that Rocky said was in his ""basement"", the anger that he had in his gut. As Stallone wrote the screenplay, I think he was talking to himself. I wonder what speech he'll give as John Rambo in the upcoming ""John Rambo"" movie that's filming. (I'll never know, and I won't miss it.)All art must pass the test of credibility and this failed. Rocky, a punch-drunk pugilist morphed into a dime store philosopher.

That easy dialogue was written thirty years ago, though, and this time around it didn't come easy. Stallone is a different person, and therefore a different writer. People grow; they change. Yet here he presents us with yet another Rocky film, with a main character desperate *not* to change. (We may as well be speaking of Stallone himself.) A Rocky that wants to get back into the ring, relive his glory days, get whatever he didn't get out of his gut the first time around when he lost a staggering and entirely unbelievable twenty-three fights. A Stallone desperate to...yeah, I've said that already.The vehicle Stallone chooses as Rocky's spark is absurd. ESPN does a ""cartoon"" simulation of a fight between the current heavyweight champion (Mason ""the Line"" Dixon, played by Antonion Tarver who is a former light-heavyweight champion and has a few grand delusions of his own), and the simulation predicts that Rocky would win. In the real world, this wouldn't have raised more than an eyebrow. In Stallone's world, in whatever illogical, deranged universe he has placed Rocky in, this grew to an exhibition pay-per-view fight worth millions held in Las Vegas, where nobody goes to lose.An exhibition PPV? Who are they kidding? I understand that this is fiction and that suspension of disbelief is expected, but this is absurd. I'm a boxing, er, fan, I suppose. A reluctant fan in that I don't enjoy the violence but do enjoy the competition. My point? I know the game, and I can state with absolute certainty that an exhibition PPV between a young, strong champion and an aging (50s!) fighter who has shown signs of brain damage in previous films would never be sanctioned. For that matter, no fight between said combatants would be sanctioned anywhere in the U.S.A.I will give the film this: it used a real boxing promoter (Lou diBella, and also showed the production flag for De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions), real boxing commentators (all from HBO: Max Kellerman, Larry Merchant, and Jim Lampley), a real ring announcer (Michael Buffer - ""Let's get ready to rumble!""), a real referee (Joe Cortez), and the weigh-in official was the Nevada State boxing commissioner (Marc Ratner). Mike Tyson even made a punk appearance, showing up at the fight and calling out Dixon. There were others, too, such as the commentators from ESPN (Brian Kenney).I heard that the fight choreography was going to be superb. It wasn't. The punches looked no more real than they ever have, and the beatings that each fighter took were impossibly brutal. In this film, Rocky is over fifty years old. Any referee, *especially* Joe Cortez, would have stopped the fight in the second round when the fifty-year-old contender is knocked down twice and severely wobbled several other times. Rocky still hasn't learned to keep his gloves up so he's quite literally a human punching bag. I wonder if there's a metaphor in that last sentence for Stallone.Let's hope that Stallone is finished with Rocky. I am.",2,Punch drunk film staggers across the screen,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,3916,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'adoring', 'public', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'ex-champ', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'embarrassing', 'plea', 'relevance', 'redemption', 'end', 'think', 'was', 'latter', 'telling', 'clue', 'was', 'Paulie', 'speech', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'entered', 'ring', 'Paulie', 'said', 'paraphrase', 'tonight', 'get', 'system', 'once', 'was', 'referring', 'stuff', 'Rocky', 'said', 'was', 'basement', 'anger', 'had', 'gut', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'think', 'was', 'talking', 'wonder', 'what', 'speech', ""'ll"", 'give', 'John', 'Rambo', 'upcoming', 'John', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'filming', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'art', 'must', 'pass', 'test', 'credibility', 'failed', 'Rocky', 'punch-drunk', 'pugilist', 'morphed', 'dime', 'store', 'philosopher', 'felt', 'Stallone', 'was', 'reaching', 'back', 'easy', 'dialogue', 'first', 'Rocky', 'film', 'still', 'classic', 'IMO', 'easy', 'dialogue', 'was', 'written', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'easy', 'Stallone', 'different', 'person', 'therefore', 'different', 'writer', 'People', 'grow', 'change', 'here', 'yet', 'Rocky', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'desperate', '*not*', 'change', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'speaking', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'get', 'back', 'ring', 'relive', 'glory', 'days', 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'gut', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'when', 'lost', 'staggering', 'entirely', 'unbelievable', 'twenty-three', 'fights', 'Stallone', 'desperate', 'yeah', ""'ve"", 'said', 'already.The', 'vehicle', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'spark', 'absurd', 'ESPN', 'cartoon', 'simulation', 'fight', 'current', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'Mason', 'Line', 'Dixon', 'played', 'Antonion', 'Tarver', 'who', 'former', 'light-heavyweight', 'champion', 'few', 'grand', 'delusions', 'own', 'simulation', 'Rocky', 'would', 'win', 'real', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'raised', 'more', 'eyebrow', 'Stallone', 'world', 'illogical', 'deranged', 'universe', 'placed', 'Rocky', 'grew', 'exhibition', 'pay-per-view', 'fight', 'millions', 'held', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'nobody', 'lose.An', 'exhibition', 'PPV', 'Who', 'are', 'kidding', 'understand', 'fiction', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'expected', 'absurd', ""'m"", 'boxing', 'er', 'fan', 'suppose', 'reluctant', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'violence', 'do', 'enjoy', 'competition', 'point', 'know', 'game', 'can', 'state', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'exhibition', 'PPV', 'young', 'strong', 'champion', 'aging', '50s', 'fighter', 'who', 'shown', 'signs', 'brain', 'damage', 'previous', 'films', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'sanctioned', 'matter', 'fight', 'said', 'combatants', 'would', 'be', 'sanctioned', 'anywhere', 'U.S.A.I', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'used', 'real', 'boxing', 'promoter', 'Lou', 'diBella', 'also', 'showed', 'production', 'flag', 'De', 'La', 'Hoya', 'company', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'Promotions', 'real', 'boxing', 'commentators', 'HBO', 'Max', 'Kellerman', 'Larry', 'Merchant', 'Jim', 'Lampley', 'real', 'ring', 'announcer', 'Michael', 'Buffer', 'Let', 'get', 'ready', 'rumble', 'real', 'referee', 'Joe', 'Cortez', 'weigh-in', 'official', 'was', 'Nevada', 'State', 'boxing', 'commissioner', 'Marc', 'Ratner', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'even', 'made', 'punk', 'appearance', 'showing', 'up', 'fight', 'calling', 'out', 'Dixon', 'were', 'others', 'too', 'such', 'commentators', 'ESPN', 'Brian', 'Kenney', 'heard', 'fight', 'choreography', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'superb', 'was', ""n't"", 'punches', 'looked', 'more', 'real', 'ever', 'have', 'beatings', 'fighter', 'took', 'were', 'impossibly', 'brutal', 'film', 'Rocky', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'referee', '*especially*', 'Joe', 'Cortez', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'fight', 'second', 'round', 'when', 'fifty-year-old', 'contender', 'knocked', 'twice', 'severely', 'wobbled', 'several', 'other', 'times', 'Rocky', 'still', ""n't"", 'learned', 'keep', 'gloves', 'up', 'so', 'quite', 'literally', 'human', 'punching', 'bag', 'wonder', 'metaphor', 'last', 'sentence', 'Stallone.Let', 'hope', 'Stallone', 'finished', 'Rocky', 'am']",N/A

Rocky is drawn back into the life of boxing and to come out of retirement in an exibition match between himself and the current champ Mason Dixon.Through the years Rocky has run the gammet.His hard climb from his humble beginings to get into the professional boxing world,his rise to the top and bitter falls.Rocky has always been the underdog,pitted against opponents who seem to shrink him in skill and stature,but with a steel will and drive of a champion he always emerged victorious.Current day, Rocky is back in his old neigborhood living his life.The owner of a resturaunt in tribute to his wife Adrian who died of cancer a few years before,trying to deal with his estranged relationship with his son and not to mention his rough relationship with Paulie.Needless to say,Rocky has allot of untied ends,or as he puts it,""stuff in the basement"".Due to a computer simulated match seen on ESPN,Mason Dixon is talked into proposing a match between himself and Balboa to beef up his reputation which has deminished.Rocky gets to thinking on his own he'd like to box again,and with an opportunity such as this,he can't resist.Hard training begins and as Rocky builds himself up for his triumphant return,you can't help be reminess of the good 'ol days.The fight begins and all the way to its final round(and to everyone's surprise)Rocky (who was the pun of everyones jokes) goes the distance and shows all that ""heart"" will take you all the way.I was pleasently surprised with Stallone's final film and the depicted life of Rocky Balboa.It was a very honest,genuine,down to earth portrayal of the life of a boxer dealing with his struggles.This isn't a fast paced action film,and does move a little slow and perhaps for a few instances,a bit sappy here and there.If you look beyond the obvious,Rocky Balboa delivers an honest performance of one of the greatest fictional comebacks of a professional athlete one will ever see.You have to hand it to Stallone,for a man who is 60 years of age,he was in phenominal shape for this performance.Something I expect that most everyone wishes they could be also.So,with a few friends,do a movie night with all the Rocky films and,""Get ready to rumble"" with Rocky one last time.",3,A fitting end to the life of a boxer,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2441,"['Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'star', 'direct', 'finale', 'Rocky', 'boxing', 'saga.Essentially', 'Rocky', 'films', 'summarized', 'evoloution', 'life', 'boxer', 'prime', 'ups', 'downs', 'retired', 'years', 'Rocky', 'drawn', 'back', 'life', 'boxing', 'come', 'retirement', 'exibition', 'match', 'current', 'champ', 'Mason', 'Dixon.Through', 'years', 'Rocky', 'run', 'gammet.His', 'hard', 'climb', 'humble', 'beginings', 'get', 'professional', 'boxing', 'world', 'rise', 'top', 'bitter', 'falls.Rocky', 'always', 'been', 'underdog', 'pitted', 'opponents', 'who', 'seem', 'shrink', 'skill', 'stature', 'steel', 'will', 'drive', 'champion', 'always', 'emerged', 'victorious.Current', 'day', 'Rocky', 'back', 'old', 'neigborhood', 'living', 'life.The', 'owner', 'resturaunt', 'tribute', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'who', 'died', 'cancer', 'few', 'years', 'trying', 'deal', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'son', 'not', 'mention', 'rough', 'relationship', 'Paulie.Needless', 'say', 'Rocky', 'allot', 'untied', 'ends', 'stuff', 'basement', '.Due', 'computer', 'simulated', 'match', 'seen', 'ESPN', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'talked', 'proposing', 'match', 'Balboa', 'beef', 'up', 'reputation', 'deminished.Rocky', 'thinking', 'own', ""'d"", 'like', 'box', 'again', 'opportunity', 'such', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist.Hard', 'training', 'begins', 'Rocky', 'up', 'triumphant', 'return', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminess', 'good', 'days.The', 'fight', 'begins', 'way', 'final', 'round', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Rocky', 'who', 'was', 'pun', 'everyones', 'jokes', 'distance', 'heart', 'will', 'take', 'way.I', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'Stallone', 'final', 'film', 'depicted', 'life', 'Rocky', 'Balboa.It', 'was', 'very', 'honest', 'genuine', 'down', 'earth', 'portrayal', 'life', 'boxer', 'dealing', 'struggles.This', ""n't"", 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'film', 'move', 'little', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'few', 'instances', 'bit', 'sappy', 'here', 'there.If', 'look', 'obvious', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'honest', 'performance', 'one', 'greatest', 'fictional', 'comebacks', 'professional', 'athlete', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'see.You', 'have', 'hand', 'Stallone', 'man', 'who', '60', 'years', 'age', 'was', 'phenominal', 'shape', 'performance.Something', 'expect', 'most', 'everyone', 'wishes', 'could', 'be', 'also.So', 'few', 'friends', 'do', 'movie', 'night', 'Rocky', 'films', 'Get', 'ready', 'rumble', 'Rocky', 'one', 'last', 'time']",N/A

Why is Stallone able to do anything he wants, from Demolition Man, Rambo and even Stop or My Mom Will Shoot? His success with Rocky. This last installment in the up and down Rocky series sees Stallone returning Rocky to his origins as gothic, yes, gothic and a bum.

1052690,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000N3AXQU,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[8, 10]","*No Spoilers*We were surprised--looked at each other and chuckled in disbelief--when we found out about macho superstar Sylvester Stallone making another Rocky movie. Once again, he was going to direct it and write it. Personally--as a boxing fan--I thought it would never work. The film would not be believable not only because of his age, but also because of his fading super star status. We had doubts about his new production. We thought about recent turkeys like Spy Kids 3-D, I See You and Driven--Can he comeback and bring his good old days? Sly cannot be serious, can he? We were so wrong. This is a true Hollywood comeback in every sense of the word. Rocky Balboa is an excellent and uplifting film about one of the greatest American icons of our time.Story:Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) lives a peaceful life in his home city of South Philadelphia. He has retired from boxing and now he owns a modest restaurant where he tells old boxing stories to his guests. He always remembers his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) who passed away few years back. He drives around to visit old places where they used to be together along with his companion Paulie (Burt Young) who is not too happy about Rocky living in the past. His son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia)--who lives on his own--is troubled by the way he's treated by everyone because of his ""son of the champion"" status. As Rocky wonders around his old neighborhood, he meets a bartender Marie (Geraldine Hughes) who he builds--perhaps a romantic--friendship.There is a new heavyweight champion in the world of boxing. Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Anthony Tarver) dominates his weigh class with virtually no one left to challenge him. He is proud, but very unlikable character in the world of prizefighting. Sports TV network ESPN runs a show where they use computer generated graphics to recreate dream boxing matches--from boxers of different eras. They recreate a dream fight between Rocky Balboa and Dixon, the computer says that Rocky would win. Dixon does not think too much of it, but Rocky sees an opportunity for redemption. He decides to get his boxing license back despite the opinions of his son and old Pauli--Marie is very supportive. Dixon's managers see an opportunity to make more money and convince the current champion to fight Rocky. They contact Rocky and he accepts. Now it is time for the people's champion to fight one more time. Will he even survive the first round?Review:Stallone goes back to the character that made him famous and delivers one of the best films of 2006. He is true to the character--a beloved and wiser--Rocky Balboa who still believes in his heart that it's never too late to step up in the ring. He shows the world that there are no boundaries--not even his age--when it comes to pursuit of happiness. We see him training with enthusiasm, despite the negativism around him. In other words, his performance and the story reach out the audience in a way never before. He inspires and motivates everyone to stand up for themselves. He literally makes the audience stand up and cheer.In the technical department, Rocky Balboa does marvels. The traditional shots of the city of Philadelphia are back, but look better than ever. We are surprised of how beautiful the photography is in this film, giving us the feeling of the old Rocky films. The first half of the film might be talky for some, but it's done to develop the character. The last part of the film is where the fireworks begin.Boxing fans will be pleased by the way the fight scenes are presented. The way they broadcast the main event is so realistic--even real boxing celebrities are involved--that is like watching a PPV boxing event in real time. The aerial shots of Las Vegas, the camera work, the introduction of the fighters, the tale of the tape down to the announcers and the referee gives the audience that illusion. Stallone combines some of the old school Rocky type flashbacks while fighting--the best of both worlds combined.The Verdict:We thought this would be a weak one, we take it back now. Stallone brings back the beloved character--and most of his corner--to deliver a ""feel good"" film that is not going to disappoint. Rocky Balboa has a compelling story, great acting and visuals that will keep you cheering for more.",5,One of the greatest American icons of our time,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,4292,"['*No', 'Spoilers*We', 'were', 'surprised', 'looked', 'other', 'chuckled', 'disbelief', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'macho', 'superstar', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'making', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'going', 'direct', 'write', 'Personally', 'boxing', 'fan', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'not', 'only', 'age', 'also', 'fading', 'super', 'star', 'status', 'had', 'doubts', 'new', 'production', 'thought', 'about', 'recent', 'turkeys', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3-D', 'See', 'Driven', 'Can', 'comeback', 'bring', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Sly', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'serious', 'can', 'were', 'so', 'wrong', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'comeback', 'sense', 'word', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'excellent', 'uplifting', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'icons', 'time.Story', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'peaceful', 'life', 'home', 'city', 'South', 'Philadelphia', 'retired', 'boxing', 'now', 'modest', 'restaurant', 'where', 'old', 'boxing', 'stories', 'guests', 'always', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'around', 'visit', 'old', 'places', 'where', 'used', 'be', 'together', 'companion', 'Paulie', 'Burt', 'Young', 'who', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'Rocky', 'living', 'past', 'son', 'Rocky', 'Jr.', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'who', 'own', 'troubled', 'way', 'treated', 'everyone', 'son', 'champion', 'status', 'Rocky', 'wonders', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'bartender', 'Marie', 'Geraldine', 'Hughes', 'who', 'perhaps', 'romantic', 'new', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'world', 'boxing', 'Mason', 'Line', 'Dixon', 'Anthony', 'Tarver', 'weigh', 'class', 'virtually', 'one', 'left', 'challenge', 'proud', 'very', 'unlikable', 'character', 'world', 'prizefighting', 'Sports', 'TV', 'network', 'ESPN', 'show', 'where', 'use', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'recreate', 'dream', 'boxing', 'matches', 'boxers', 'different', 'eras', 'recreate', 'dream', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Dixon', 'computer', 'Rocky', 'would', 'win', 'Dixon', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'Rocky', 'opportunity', 'redemption', 'get', 'boxing', 'license', 'back', 'opinions', 'son', 'old', 'Pauli', 'Marie', 'very', 'supportive', 'Dixon', 'managers', 'see', 'opportunity', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'convince', 'current', 'champion', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'contact', 'Rocky', 'Now', 'time', 'people', 'champion', 'fight', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Will', 'even', 'survive', 'first', 'round', 'Review', 'Stallone', 'back', 'character', 'made', 'famous', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'true', 'character', 'beloved', 'wiser', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'who', 'still', 'heart', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'step', 'up', 'ring', 'world', 'are', 'boundaries', 'not', 'even', 'age', 'when', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'see', 'training', 'enthusiasm', 'negativism', 'other', 'words', 'performance', 'story', 'reach', 'audience', 'way', 'never', 'before', 'everyone', 'stand', 'up', 'literally', 'audience', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer.In', 'technical', 'department', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'marvels', 'traditional', 'shots', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'are', 'back', 'look', 'better', 'ever', 'are', 'surprised', 'how', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'film', 'giving', 'feeling', 'old', 'Rocky', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'talky', 'done', 'develop', 'character', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'fireworks', 'begin.Boxing', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'way', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'way', 'broadcast', 'main', 'event', 'so', 'realistic', 'even', 'real', 'boxing', 'celebrities', 'are', 'involved', 'watching', 'PPV', 'boxing', 'event', 'real', 'time', 'aerial', 'shots', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'camera', 'work', 'introduction', 'fighters', 'tale', 'tape', 'announcers', 'referee', 'audience', 'illusion', 'Stallone', 'old', 'school', 'Rocky', 'type', 'flashbacks', 'fighting', 'best', 'worlds', 'combined.The', 'Verdict', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'weak', 'one', 'take', 'back', 'now', 'Stallone', 'back', 'beloved', 'character', 'most', 'corner', 'deliver', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'disappoint', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'compelling', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'visuals', 'will', 'keep', 'cheering', 'more']",N/A

Actually, I think he saw them all, and I saw the first 3.  I really didn't expect this one to be all that good and mainly got it because (1) our son and his fiance live in Philly where it's filmed and (2) for nostalgic purposes.We were pleasantly surprised!  Stallone is looking a little worse for wear, but he carries off the part of Rocky very well.  As he says, ""he still has a little junk in the basement.""  Against his son's wishes, he decides to come out of retirement and get his license to box.  His timing happens to coincide with a video match between him at his prime and a young boxer who has never really been challenged.  That young boxer's promoter asks Rocky to do an exhibition match....it's not supposed to be real.  But Rocky being Rocky, he trains for real and ends up fighting a legitimate fight against the ""young gun.""  Both walk away better off for the match.  And, of course, we get to hear the Rocky theme music!The film keeps your attention, including one part where the sort-of love interest in his life asks him why he's being so kind to her and her son (who were abandoned by the father)....she says, ""you don't owe us anything.  Why are you being so nice?"" and He responds, ""Why you got to owe somebody to get something?""  Typical Rocky.If you liked the earlier Rocky films, I think you'll like this one.

The Bill Conti score is there, the turtles Cuff and Link, Maria from the old neighborhood, Paulie and his irrascible ways. Rocky now runs a restaurant in Philly named Adrian's, whose death he is still mourning, he's lost connection with his son who is trying to escape the shadow of his famous dad. Rocky's future is stuck with his past as his life consists of regaling customers with old fight stories. When he decides that he needs to fight again because ""he still has stuff in the basement"".

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[50, 55]","Everyone's favorite underdog is back in the game, as Sylvester Stallone brings back the character that made him a household name in the first place, with the sixth entry is the popular Rocky series ""Rocky Balboa"" (apparently, Roman numerals are no long in). Going into ""Rocky Balboa"" is like walking into a bad teenage comedy, as you go in with low expectations and more then a little cynicism. Yeah, sure, the original ""Rocky"" was critically acclaimed and won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but that was in 1976. This is 2006. That's about...a thirty year gap between the original movie and the current one. And Stallone is now sixty. Can he really pull off acting young anymore? The answer is no, so Stallone doesn't even try. Instead of pretending he's still 22, Stallone has Rocky retired at the age of 62, who is running a successful restaurant but has a strained relationship with his son ever since his wife died of causes that are not revealed in the film.Then one of those computer simulators sets up a virtual fight with Rocky fighting the current heavy weight champion of the world Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The computer deems Rocky would win in a fight, which gets Rocky into wondering what it would be like to get back into fighting. Rocky doesn't consider getting back in the ring for glory or fame, but more for the fact that he's somewhat stuck in time and wants the past back. Rocky constantly visits places he and Adrian used to visit, much to his brother-in-law's frustration. ""You're problem is that you're living in the past. But I can't do that anymore,"" Pauli tells Rocky on the anniversary of Adrians death. For once, Pauli actually comes off as the wise one. Everything in Rocky's life is about the past. Rocky may own a restaurant (named Adrians appropriately enough), but Rocky doesn't actually manage the business or cook the food, he just dresses up in a nice suit and tells the costumers stories of his boxing career, taking a photo once in awhile.His son loves his dad, but is frustrated that he passes through life based on the fact that he is the son of a former heavy weight champion. Even Rocky's friend Marie, the girl he walked home near the beginning of the first movie, is helped by Rocky mainly because Rocky can see the results of something good he did in the past. When the opportunity to fight Mason comes to Rocky's table, he accepts the fight because he wants to put the past behind him. In a phrase that will most likely become one of the most popular lines of dialog in history, Rocky tells his son ""Life's not about how many punches you can throw at it, it's about how many times you can get hit and continue to punch back."" When we finally get to the big fight, Rocky is once again an underdog. No longer young, looking a little frail, but with just enough determination that you can't help but hope he wins.Yet the road will not be easy. ""Rocky Balboa"" delivers everything you expect a Rocky movie to have, from inspirational speeches, to a training montage, to spouts with minor characters. All of this we expect, yet it feels fresh and interesting. The characters have something to say to each other, and the storyline is very human and personal. I was amazed by how involved I got with these characters, considering that I haven't really spent any time with them in years, and all of them look completely different then when I last saw them. When Rocky first ran up those stairs and lifted his fists in the air, he was saying something to the world. Now he's saying something else, and it's just as inspiring as the last thing he had to say. By bringing Rocky down to our level, and dealing with the issue's we've all been joking about, Rocky becomes the underdog once again, and we're only happy to root for him some more.

1052700,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000N3AXQU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","It is easy enough to say that ""Rocky Balboa"" is a much better ending to the cinematic saga of Sylvester Stallone's most famous creation than ""Rocky V,"" because that 1990 was clearly the bottom of the barrel for the franchise.  But ""Rocky Balboa,"" the new ""last"" Rocky movie is not only a lot better than the last ""last"" Rocky movie, it does a good job of bringing things full circle and reminding us of why the original 1976 film scored a big upset by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture.Adrian has died and Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia) is tired of living in his the shadow of his famous father, who spends his days at his wife's grave and his nights at his bar.  With his old friend Paulie (Burt Young) in tow, Rocky visits all of his haunts from the old days (that is to say, from the first film), and pretty much everything is in ruins.  The exception is ""Little"" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the kids who rejected his advice in the original film with the comeback ""Screw you, creepo.""  She is grown up now and a single mom, and when she denies she ever said anything that rude he assures her that she did, adding a comment about the longevity of great insults.  Rocky takes an interest in Marie and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III), hoping to fill the voids in his life but never thinking that they are replacing his wife and son.  Then the Fates once again intervene in his life and give Rocky an unlikely match against the unpopular current heavyweight champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which means it will be time to cue Bill Conti's famous music, go through another training montage, and have Rocky climb the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum.However, all of that happens relatively late in the film.  Of course, Stallone wrote and directed the grand finale, and having thought long and hard about his character that is primarily what this film is about.  The fight is a necessary part of the Rocky formula and therefore of this story, but most of the memorable scenes and lines from this film come before Rocky ever steps into the ring.  One of the casualties of the Rocky franchise was the fantastic lesson of the original film that you can be a winner without winning.  That is the sort of thing that Yogi Berra might say (or that Joe Garagiola might say that Yogi said), which is quite apt since Berra's ""It ain't over 'till it's over"" is the film's tagline.  But such ideas are at the heart of the Rocky mythos and Stallone has not simply returned to them, but found a way to rearticulate them in terms of the life of his character at this age and at the center of his shrinking circle of family and friends.  One of his best moves is that the big fight is meaningful for his opponent as well.Stallone is not only working off of the Rocky mythos but also drawing inspiration from the real world of boxing, explicitly updating the original computer match that had Rocky Marciano beating Muhammad Ali.  There is also the idea of the ex-champ's restaurant, which harkens back at least to Jack Dempsey's place, where he tells stories and poses for photos (Ali makes people pose for shots where you put your fist against his chin like you are landing a hard one on him).  Stallone knows that even those who do not own a George Foreman grill probably know that he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight crown even if they do not remember how old (Foreman was 45 when he won the title, 20 years after losing it to Ali, and would hold it another three years).  So in Stallone's screenplay Mason ""The Line"" Dixon gets the chance to prove the computer wrong and as soon as that robe comes off in the right before the fight it is clear that even at ""50,"" Rocky is totally chiseled and in a lot better shape than Foreman.  We are also reminded that Stallone knows he is doing when he choreographs a fight.  Included in the deleted scenes is an alternative ending that only reinforces what we already knew: namely that what you see in this movie is the way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).For me things get a bit too artsy in the fight, where suddenly shots are looking like a cross between ""Raging Bull"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" and every since that slow-motion fall and rise ending to ""Rocky II"" I start to worry when Stallone starts getting too cute.  But whereas previous bouts have been about Rocky finally landing the big blow, this one is definitely all about Rocky being hit.  In case anybody does get the point, the key line in the film echoes in Rocky's mind at the pivotal moment: ""But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward.""  We have had ample reason to be cynical and Stallone and his creation for a couple of decades now, but both the creator and his creation evince a lot of the heart that made us care about them in the first place.",4,The Rocky saga ain't over until Sylvester Stallone says it is over,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,5003,"['easy', 'enough', 'say', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'much', 'better', 'ending',

1052701,A1N46G8TKM3ZQB,B000N3AXQU,L. Bravim,"[3, 3]","When I first heard Sylvester Stallone was writing a sixth Rocky movie, I cringed. There was the initial dread of seeing an old Rocky in the ring coupled with the huge disappointment that was Rocky 5. Although too embarrassed to see it in theaters, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film on DVD, surely as fitting an ending as possible to one of my favorite action series.But this film certainly doesn't fit in comfortably with the others, understandably so. This isn't the 80s. Rocky's wife is dead. He's older, slower and no longer involved with boxing except in telling old fightin' tales to customers of his modest restaurant in South Philly. Paulie is back and as annoying as usual, but this serves as a contrast to the humble, loyal Rocky we all know and love.If you've seen the previews there are no big surprises. This movie isn't about a glorified exhibition match of a 50-something ex-champ versus a 30-something Antonio Tarver in his prime. It's about growing old, doing what you love and the importance of family. Adrian's memory is alive and well (plenty of flashbacks). Rocky's son is struggling to cope with the shadow of his beloved father, which follows him even in the corporate world.At the end of the day, you're not supposed to hate ""villain"" Mason 'the line' Dixon.

Fighting Tommy Gunn in the street wasn't nearly as good as one more title shot would have been.  Well, in Rocky Balboa, a 50+ year old Balboa gets his one last shot.It was very different seeing the Rocky characters in the 21st century.  Rocky's son worked for a corporation, Rocky owned a restaurant, Paulie STILL worked at the Meat Packing plant.  Instead of having the local news carry the info on Sports like in Rocky movies of the past, ESPN carried the info, and HBO Pay Per View televised the actual fight.  I also like the fact that the championship fight was only scheduled for 10 rounds, instead of the 15 they used to fight back in the 70's and 80's.There was no mention of Rocky's actual age, just that he was ""in his 50's"", which I thought was a bit unrealistic.  If a fighter in his 50's today got into the ring, headlines would always say his actual age.I enjoyed the guy who played Rocky's son very much.  I thought he did a very good job.  Stallone and Burt Young played Rocky and Paulie just as well as ever, although Burt Young, at times, seemed a little rusty.All in all, great storyline, a few exceptional speeches by Rocky about life, and I left the theatre pumped up, with a different outlook on life.

1052712,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000N3AXQU,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","When the original ROCKY debued in 1976, audiences were entranced more by the man outside the ring than the fighter inside it. Sylvester Stallone played Rocky as a man who had frailties mixed in with his swatting power. We cared about him, perhaps even more so when he lost a close decision to Apollo Creed.  In the four sequels, Stallone gradually placed more emphasis on a storyline played by the numbers.  We still enjoyed his Rocky character, even if he slowly left his source of interest, his appealing mixture of inner fears masked by an indomitable will.In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone comes full circle.  Both are pushing sixty, far past the age of an action star.  We can see lines in Rocky's face that are probably not the result of makeup. But what we do not see is a ridiculous figure of a man who keeps coming to a dance when he no longer can move.  We see him as a man of immense dignity, content to play greeter to patrons in his restaurant, but still grieving over the loss of his wife Adrian.  We see him embroiled in a number of relating issues. He has a son who seeks to escape the long shadow of an imposing father.  He meets Marie, a now much more mature woman whom Rocky told to give up smoking in the original ROCKY.  He meets her son with whom he tries to have the sort of relation that he cannot have with his own son.  But this is after all a ROCKY movie, and these relationships have a built in limitation.  Rocky knows there can be no romance with Marie, not with the ghost of Adrian still fresh.  Her son floats ephemerally in and out of the picture.  Rocky's son is a walk-on as well.  The focus is on Rocky being yanked out of retirement to have an exhibition match against Mason Dixon, well played by real life boxer Antonio Tarver.Those who find fault with ROCKY BALBOA tend to emphasize the film's admitted faults.  In an exhibition fight, the limit would be six rounds with headgear.  Mason Dixon has been blamed for being a puerile version of Clubber Lang, from ROCKY III.  Yet, Tarver is convincing as a man who has his own demons.  It is hardly his fault that he, like an earlier Rocky, has run out of worthy contenders. Tarver plays Dixon as a fighter who seeks his own place in the boxing pantheon. And against Balboa, Dixon finds a worthy if elderly opponent against whom he may measure his own greatness.What emerges in ROCKY BALBOA is a film that combines the best of themes that look back to past glories and places them in the context of how those glories can fit in against a man whose only glory is to dance one more time against the Astaire of the ring.

We learn that Rocky has been running his late wife's restaurant in recent years and that he is actually seeking some kind of closure (personally and professionally.) As he states to Paulie, he still has ""some stuff in the basement.""His final boxing match leaves no false illusions - he is not a fast young man anymore. But Rocky still has heart, strength, and is still able to go the distance.Another interesting point: Many of the original Rocky sidekick characters are back and while that might seem contrived, Stallone actually makes it work to the story's advantage. By bringing ""Little Marie"" back as Stallone did, you get a sense that many of Rocky's cronies stayed in the hood and it was only a matter of time before they all reconnected again.I don't know if I'll say this was, by far, the best Rocky.

I know it sounds cliched, but it's true ... You'll cheer. You'll laugh. You'll cry. But more importantly, like the first Rocky, you'll be inspired. Stallone does a fantastic job bringing Rocky full circle and giving ""Rocky Balboa"" the same feel and texture as his original.  We know Stallone missed the mark with Rocky IV and, to some degree, Rocky V. Not with ""Rocky Balboa""""Rocky Balboa"" introduces us to the most human Rocky since I and II. It's also amazing to watch Burt Young work. He brings one of Hollywood's great characters back to life and does so in such a superb way. You feel for Paulie. He's so socially inept, abusive and unaware of who he is. His outward language screams ""leave me alone"", yet he needs Rocky. Without Rocky, Paulie would've died a long time ago. Watching Stallone and Young be these characters again is amazing. The chemistry between the two never changes. Thankfully. As a ""Rocky"" fan, once Burt Young says ""..Yo Rocko.."", you know you're  home again and that, in a way, you're reuniting with old friends. And that's the magic of Rocky. You know these people.

1052717,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B000N3AXQU,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[7, 9]","I haven't seen any of the previous Rocky movies, so I watched this through completely innocent eyes. I wasn't sure about it at first, what with not having seen any of the previous five, and I was wondering if it would be one of those films, where you HAVE to have seen the previous films.I was surprised when I found myself not only enjoying the film, but also getting emotionally involved. Sly did the right thing when he got this up and running by NOT making the viewers feel the need to see the previous films. There were only a couple of brief flashbacks, which were necessary, and relevant.The film begins with Rocky, now a hero in Philadelphia and running his own restaurant, letting his old sparring partners eat for free, and telling the locals his old stories. It cuts a pretty sad story, he's a washed up ex boxer, who actually looks like he's been a few too many rounds in the ring. I did get the impression; maybe it was just me, that he's desperate for company. Rocky constantly greeted people with ""Hey, how u doin'?"" Practically adopted a woman he remembered walking home as a little girl, and her son, and gave them both a job. It comes across as a bit desperate in the character of Rocky. His wife is dead, he's estranged from his only son, who seems to be embarrassed of his old pa, and it's a very lonely life. His son doesn't want anyone to meet his old boxer dad at his work, even though he only got the job because of his surname.Of course, there's a new kid on the block, and they start comparing him to the old Rocky, and who would win in a fight. A computer whiz-kid simulates the fight. Rocky sees this, thinks about it for a nano-second, and starts training again, despite protests from the licensing committee, his son, his friends, and people in the restaurant. Many think he cannot do it, many people say he can't, right to his face, but that just makes Rocky all the more defiant.The training montage is definitely one of the highlights of the movie, along with the terrific song backing it. It shows Rocky trying desperately to get back into shape (and Sly himself too, since he's admitted in interviews, that he let himself slide, and can't do as many things as he could do in the earlier films), from not being able to bench press very much, to a whole lot! Honestly it made my eyes water how much he ended up bench pressing & lifting in weights. Ouch.The final fight scene is of course, what we've all been waiting for throughout the film. It's the climax, and wow, what a climax. I wouldn't have said I would normally go to watch a boxing match - it's more an American thing really, I think? In fact, I hate boxing, but the film captures the electric atmosphere in the stadium, and I found myself getting caught up in the excitement. If there hadn't been people around me, I probably would have started jumping up and down in my seat. Of course, you're just waiting for him to get up, when he gets knocked down, urging him to get up, and obviously, will he win, or won't he? And it's also intercut with very brief flashbacks to previous Rocky matches. Flashbacks were used from every Rocky movie apart from Rocky V, which Sly admits himself is the weakest in the series.I thought it was quite good how they finished it. I was expecting the ending to be clear-cut, but it's not, and it's good that it's not.The one thing that got me watching Rocky Balboa was the fact that no matter how much plastic surgery Jackie Stallone has, Sly is basically turning into her!!! It was scary watching him on screen and seeing Jackie, which I never really noticed in Demolition Man, or his older films. He is turning into his mother.Overall I think this was a good idea (some people do disagree with me) for Sly to revisit Rocky one last time, and just wrap it all up. If I'd seen the previous movies, then it would have been a good way to end it all - if I had, I'd probably have been totally fed up with it all by now! The ending does seem very final, but then that means nothing these days. I have to applaud Sly for returning to the role after 15 years, showing he still has what it takes, showing he still has the body (his shoulders are the width of me lying down no exaggeration!), and showing he can still hack it in the ring. He is 61 this summer after all. It is a good film to go see if you have seen the previous five or even if you haven't. Excellent film.",3,Did Rocky rock me?

Surprising, too, was how similar this film was in feel and spirit to the original Rocky film.  Fascinating too is that this film, of all the Rocky films, seems to have the LEAST actual focus on boxing.  The film is all about character development, relationships, and longing for the past.  Some great material being told here.I loved seeing Rocky's continuous obsession with the past, complimented with Bill Conti's music again (the graveyard sequences were especially poignant.)Also interesting was how the ""Little Marie"" relationship was handled.  I have to admit I was squirming contemplating a love story unfolding, and thankfully, Rocky's relationship never veers beyond that of a caring father (even at the hotel, pre-fight, when Marie visits Rocky's room, and Rocky is wearing the white-undershirt, I'm thinking... oh, no... please no.  And indeed, nothing happened.  Thank you, Sylvester Stallone, for leaving romance out of this one.)The final fight unfolded convincingly, although in the back of my mind, I love the idea of Rocky dying from the fight and being reunited with Adrianne, but that might have ended the film on a note of corniness.

1052720,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000N3AXQU,Melissa Niksic,"[7, 7]","I'm a big fan of the ""Rocky"" series, and I was very excited to see ""Rocky Balboa."" I didn't enjoy the film quite as much as I thought I would, but I still recommend it.Here's the basic plot of the film: Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has been running a small Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia for about ten years. His beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire, who appears only in flashbacks of the other five ""Rocky"" movies) died of cancer three years ago. Rocky has been unable to let go of her, and the first 45 minutes of the movie basically outline the tremendous amount of grief he is feeling. In a way, Rocky is also grieving for his son (Milo Ventimiglia). Now a grown man, Rocky Jr. is unhappy with his job and has tried to distance himself from his father.Rocky ultimately decides that he wants to try his hand at boxing again. He manages to acquire a license and plans to concentrate on small local fights. However, the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), becomes rattled after a televised computer matchup between him and Rocky deems Rocky as the winner. Mason invites Rocky to participate in an exhibition match, and Rocky accepts the offer.Rocky's training doesn't go as smoothly as it did before: he's pushing 60 now and has to deal with arthritis, calcium deposits, and a variety of other ailments. As always, though, Rocky perseveres, and he gets a lot of help from his son and from good old Paulie (Burt Young). The film culminates in a Pay-Per-View matchup between Rocky and Mason in Las Vegas, which is as intense and emotional as every other fight we've seen in the series.I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but I think the result of the fight was entirely appropriate. Once again, Rocky shows us the importance of fighting hard to keep our dreams alive, despite any obstacles that come our way. The film is very reminiscent of the first ""Rocky"" movie, and I really enjoyed that. There are also many flashbacks from the previous five films, and those old clips were a lot of fun to watch.Even though I liked the movie, there were a few things I didn't care for. As I mentioned before, the first 45 minutes of the movie were incredibly depressing. Stallone obviously wanted us to focus on Rocky's character more than just the fighting itself, and I get that, but still...it was too darn depressing! Also, Rocky's friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was interesting at first because of the way she actually knows Rocky from years back, but I think the movie focused too much on their relationship. Marie did not have to be such a prominent fixture in the film. Finally, I didn't like the way most of the fight was filmed. It looked like we were watching an actual Pay-Per- View fight, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the movie's style. Stallone switched to using ""regular"" camera angles again at the very end of the fight, but I don't understand why he went with the whole HBO sports film sequence for so long.Overall, I think Rocky fans will really enjoy this movie. It's very bittersweet, but it was nice to have a solid conclusion to the series.

These are the final moments of a great character so many people have come to know and love.When I heard about the film getting green-lit with Sylvester Stallone in the starring role, I have to own up to some skepticism. I really didn't think Stallone could pull it off. I thought maybe he wouldn't have the chops physically or possibly be too emotionally close to the character and the lucrative franchise it became to take enough risks with the character.Twenty minutes into the film, though, I was convinced that I was in for a comfortable, exciting, and emotional reunion and final meeting with a hero that's been in my life for thirty years. I saw Rocky when it came out. He and Burt Reynolds were the reasons I drove Trans Ams for ten years. Burt had Sally Field back then and jeans looked great on her, so maybe Burt had a little more influence.Rocky's personal life has always been a series of tragedies. He was a bum from nowhere who got a shot in Rocky. He almost lost the woman of his dreams in Rocky II. He lost his trainer, Mickey, who was like a father to him in Rocky III. He lost one of his greatest friends, Apollo Creed, in Rocky IV. And in Rocky V, he lost everything and got kicked to the curb back in his old neighborhood while getting betrayed by a young boxer he was trying to help.And in Rocky Balboa, he's lost Adrian. Knowing the character for as long as I did, I had to wonder what was left. His life appears comfortable, but it's empty. The tour he takes us on during those opening minutes of the film bear this out. His relationship with his son has gone south. More than anything, though, Rocky just doesn't know what to do with himself. When Adrian was alive, he could give up the fighting. He had her. Now he no longer has her and all he has is that restless drive to be inside a ring matched up against an opponent.Stallone pays loving tribute to his character and graciously gives the fans a great story. It's not art. It's not always polished. What you've got here, folks, is myth, the stuff of good dreams.

I must say that I was surprised by this film which was actually quite good.  The film managed to recapture the feel of the original film with a now ""old"" Rocky, mourning his wife constantly while trying to mend fences with his son.  He is the owner of a restaurant and lets his old sparring partner Spider Rico eat there for free until Spider decides he needs to earn his keep and voluntarily begins working in the restaurant.Rocky meets up with the troubled young lady who he had walked home in the first movie.  She is now a middle-aged single mom tending bar.  Rocky takes a liking to her teenaged son right away and seems to like her too but Adrian's memories keep getting in the way.Of course what is a Rocky film without a bout?  In this one Antonio Tarver puts in an excellent performance as Mason Dixon, a champion with nobody worthy to fight.  Since there are no valid opponents for him, he cannot get a pay-per-view big money fight going.

1052724,A37Q80MN9S5AZO,B000N3AXQU,Michael Goonan,"[2, 2]","As with many, I had very low expectatioins when I heard about ""Rocky Balboa"", the 6th chapter in the classic series about the underdog boxer from Philadelphia turned heavyweight champ.  Given how awful the latest previous installment, Rocky V, was and that Sylvester Stallone is likely on medicare by now, my basic reaction to the prospect of another Rocky movie was that it sounded like a complete joke.To tell the truth, the only reason I decided to go to see Rocky Balboa was because a friend (who is a self-proclaimed ""Rocky Freak"") had insisted on taking me.  I looked at some of the critics' reviews before leaving, and I was very pleasantly suprised to see that Richard Roeper had given it a 3.5/4 rating.  This left me very optimistic walking into the movie theater, and I was not disappointed.  The film was a fitting final chapter in the legacy of an iconic American series, and certainly filled the bitter void that Rocky V left behind.  Rocky went out with pride, not embarassment.  That was supposedly Stallone's reason for making the movie.The plot centers around a long retired Rocky Balboa.  In the opening of the film, we see Rocky sitting at the grave site of his beloved wife Adrian, who had passed away in 2002.  It is rumored that the character was killed off because the actress who portrayed her, Talia Shire, refused to take part in the film because she felt it would be a major box office flop.  Whatever the reason, it is clear that Rocky misses her terribly, and we see him with his brother-in-law Paulie touring Philadelphia sites that reminded Rocky of his life with Adrian.  It is a very painful experience for Paulie, however, because he regrets that he did not treat Adrian very well.After this tour, Rocky goes to the Lucky Seven Tavern where he and his old trainer Mickey used to drink together.  There he meets a woman bartender who seems to know him.  Rocky doesn't remember, but the woman informs him that she was ""Little Marie"", a troublemaking minor character who made a cameo appearence in the original film, in which Rocky pleads that she quit smoking, only to recieve the response ""Screw you, creapo!"".  She introduces him to her child, Stephenson (aka ""Steps"") whom Rocky gives a job to at the Resuraunt he now owns in Philadelphia.Rocky clearly is feeling emptiness at this point in his life, but he would find himself in the spotlight again soon enough.  In a nationally televised episode of ESPN's SportsCenter, Rocky (in his prime) is put up against current (hated) heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (played by real-life boxer Antonio Tarver) in a computer simulated fight.  Rocky emerges victorious, though many ESPN commentators disagree with this result.This prompts Rocky to consider fighting again. When he tells his son of this, he thinks Rocky is crazy, and the Pennsylvania Athletic Commision refused him a boxing license.  However, Rocky pursuades them to change their minds after a very passionate speech about every American's ""right to pursue happiness"".Much to Rocky's suprise, Mason Dixon challenges him to an exhibition match to capitalize on the publicity of ESPN's simulated fight in an attempt to improve his image.  Rocky is reluctant to accept the offer, and explains that he was only interested in local ameture tournaments and not in ""getting mangled and embarrased"".  However, after much thought and encouragment from ""Little Marie"", Rocky decides to accept the challenge.  What followed was a classic and inspirational underdog story of hard work and dedication.  But would it pay off? Well, I won't ruin the movie for you. I'll just say that the ending is fairly realistic, but leaves everybody satisified.I think that Rocky Balboa is probably the best Rocky film since Rocky II in 1980, because it really brings back the ""pull for the underdog"" spirit of the first two films.  While Rocky III and Rocky IV were fairly enjoyable, they didn't capture the same spirit because Rocky wasn't really the underdog anymore.  In this way, I think it's good that Stallone waited so long to release Rocky Balboa.

However as fate handed it to Stallone, he was down and out for the count.As if Stallone's career has it's own Mick or Adrian at the sidelines, he is back and bigger than ever. From a fresh script and a crisp yet gritty visual style that harkens back to 1970's pioneer filmmaking, Rocky Balboa is the most exciting and accepting sequel since James Cameron's T2: Judgment Day in 1991. Everything is fresh, but none too far from the original scope of work that the boxing series entails.Rocky Balboa, long since retired, is the owner of an Italian eatery called Adrian's still in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA. Things are not the same, though. His wife Adrian passed away a few years beforehand, while his son is taking off on a career of his own. However, things are starting to shake and move when a computer simulated match names Rocky Balboa winner over the undisputed champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon.Where to start?From Bill Conti's beautiful arrangements to several landmark settings from the originals, everything about Rocky Balboa is nostalgic. However, this is not a remake in the slightest sense, and more importantly this is not a novelty act. The film may highlight on the original over some of the more successful sequels, yet this is a story of it's own.There are new faces while there are some old. It is hard to picture a Rocky film without Talia Shire, but it works so well that it would be hard to take the picture seriously with her in it. The character of Balboa has not been this moving and sentimental since the original. His age shows yet there is more youth than ever as he explores the possibilites and fate of his senior status.Nevertheless, this film seems more autobiographical than ever. Perhaps it is not Rocky being displayed on the screen, but Stallone himself reminding us that all is not vacant in that head of his. After all, this is the man who brought us some of film's most prolific characters, which is why it is so depressing to see his name tarnished in the past decade.In the long run, Rocky Balboa will still prove to be both an excellent film and one of the best footnotes for a filmatic series. Not only is this the best holiday film, it's probably the most motivating one too. When that montage hits and you're moving in your seat, it's okay, you can dance around and clap because chances are every person seated either behind or in front of you is doing the exact same thing.It ain't over til it's over, right?

1052727,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B000N3AXQU,"Mike London ""MAC""","[4, 4]","When Stallone announced he would be making the sixth installment in the ROCKY series, a lot of people shook he head.  After all, he was 60 years old at the time of filming, well past his prime.  And, given how bad ROCKY V was, a lot of people, there was a good possibility this was going to be a pretty bad movie.Well, like the new Indiana Jones film currently in production (KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, where the hell did Lucas and Speilburg get that title?), ROCKY BALBOA does not try to hide the main protagonists' age.  Balboa is old, and he knows it.Before we get into the film proper, there are several deleted scenes included on the DVD, as well as an alternate ending in which the outcome of the final fight with Mason Dixon is reversed.Stallone, Burt Young (Paulie), and the guy who plays Duke are the only actors to be in all six films.  Five different actors have portrayed Rocky's son, one for each movie except the firt.The film opens to Rocky feeding some turtles, a reference to the first film.  As the first hour or so unrolls, we find out that Adrian has died, Rocky has opened a restaurant in Philadelphia, Spider Rico from the first movie has become Christian, and Maria, also from the first movie, has struck up a friendship with Rocky.  Other than the fight, these are the main storylines that Stallone focuses on for the majority of the film.Two of the best scenes, not only in this movie but in the series in general, is when Rocky goes before the Boxing Committee to get licensed.  The state committee refuses to give Rocky a license, and Rocky launches into a speech about his freedom and the Bill of Rights and how he needs to do what he needs to do.  The other has to do with his son, as his son feels like he is living in the shadow of his father.  Rocky quickly sets his son straight.  Great monologues.  And it's great to see Maria from the first film back again.  She had a scene in ROCKY V (Rocky's warning that she'd be a whore if she kept up her lifestyle turns out to be true prophecy) but it was cut, leaving Rocky to bring her back for BALBOA.The film is openly nostalgic, with Rocky revisiting his old haunts, though the old places have changed, and a lot of times for the worst.  Unlike ROCKY V, however, this nostalgia is tempered with Rocky's heart, his optimism, and his winning attitude.  He's also having some relational issues with his son, but ultimately these are resolved by the end of the film.BALBOA references all five previous films (though appropriately enough there's only one throw away reference to ROCKY V).  There's footage of his fights, and the film heavily references the first ROCKY.  Even Burgess Merideth, who died in 1997 and played Mickey, gets a line in one of the retrospective sequences.Unfortunately, Carl Weathers does not appear in archive footage, as he wanted to be actually written into the movie (probably a dream sequence, something along those lines), and since Stallone wouldn't do that Weathers wouldn't let him use any footage with Apollo Creed, which is sad, given how important a character Apollo is to the Rocky movies.Though long retired, a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight Mason ""The Line"" Dixon sparks interested in the aging Balboa when the computer marks Balboa as the winner.  Mason Dixon's promoters is looking for some new blood, because Dixon has been fighting chumps and has lost audience favor to the point where all of his proposed pay-per-view matches are being declined.  Dixon's promoters are looking at this as a way to remake Dixon's image, and see this match as a perfect way to do so.Still, Balboa is a lot older now, so when Duke (yes, that Duke, the Duke in all five previous films) starts training him, a lot of the techniques are out do to his advanced age.  As Duke says, ""Let's build some hurtin' bombs,"" and these bombs they certainly build.  Despite the age, Balboa trains hard.  Stallone even incorporates a revision to the famous scene of him running up and down the Art Museum steps.  In the original film Rocky was to run the steps holding a dog, but this did not prove feasible as Stallone found the dog they had too hard to manage.  This time around they got the scene to work as originally envisioned.  Of course, we have the famous Rocky theme playing in the background as he trains.Then Rocky and Mason Dixon fight.  This fight without a doubt is the best choreographed and filmed of all the Rocky fights.  It's also the most realistic.  For being 60 years old, Stallone is in remarkable condition.  Guess steroids will do that too you.Mike Tyson also makes a cameo during the fight.  Strangely enough, like Reeses Pieces in ET, there's a few shots of product placement during the fight for GoldenPalace.com.SPOILTER: The fight ends just like the first ROCKY, a split decision with the win going to Mason Dixon.  Even though Rocky loses, he doesn't because he manages to go all ten rounds, and gives Dixon a run for his money.Stallone stuck with the ending in the film to pay homage to the first film, as well as making a point that Rocky still walks away victorious, even if he doesn't ""win"" parsay.  In fact, Rocky's out the door while the announcement is being announced, cause it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses, because he's already won something much bigger.Another important theme is that Mason Dixon is looking for a real fight, and Mason Dixon wants to respect himself, and so they both come out winners. END SPOLIER.ROCKY BALBOA is a great way for Stallone to end the series, and probably is the second best film in the entire franchise, behind the original.  We get to see Rocky the way we've always wanted too - a winner, a picture of the American Dream fully realised.  Sure, he's had some hard knocks, he lost Adrian, but he's still a fighter.  Still has that indomitable spirit about him.The film ends with Rocky placing a flower on Adrian's grave, and with his signature line still fresh after all these years, Stallone says ""Yo Adrian, we did it,"" and then walks away with the film going out of focus.Then the credits roll.  Even the credits give you that warm fuzzy feeling, for it has footage of different, ordinary people all running up the steps of the art museum.  Makes you just smile watching it.And all I can say to that is bravo.  Stallone, out of all odds, managed not only to write a good end to the Rocky franchise, but wrote the best film since the original.  Given how bad ROCKY V is, this fact's even more miraculous.Yeah Rocky, you really did do it.  Though we won't get to see you again, this is truly a great closure to remember you by.  You really are an American Icon.",5,"Fantastic way to end the Rocky series, it's everything ROCKY V wasn't.",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,6659,"['When', 'Stallone', 'announced', 'would', 'be',

The local radio station joked about it and my friends agreed, but I walked away compelled to write this.. so that has to mean something. Honestly, I think those who found this in poor taste probably never thought much of the first Rocky.In the end this movie had little to do with fighting and much more to do with his life outside the ring...to pursue and prove his own existence. It sounds too sentimental, but Rocky manages to strike a balance surprisingly well. Its a good take home message, specially during these volatile times, when human spirit seems to be defined by our foes and enemies, Rocky manages to convince us that it is more about the struggle within ourselves.Its a very fitting finale, and Im quite astonished, Sylvester Stallone pulled it off. Even up until the end where he walks out of the ring before the fight is even called, there is much to admire. This movie had more heart than many of the critically acclaimed boxing movies Ive seen of recent times.I only found fault in the fight itself. It ended well, but the choreography was poorly executed. In line with the credibility of the story, they should have taken out most of the 10 dozen career ending haymakers. Rocky seemed absolutely clueless to the blocking technique.This movie could have been a disaster, but instead much like the story goes, can walk away with its head up high.",4,Throws more heart than punches,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,1408,"['went', 'theatre', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'joked', 'friends', 'agreed', 'walked', 'away', 'compelled', 'write', 'this..', 'so', 'that', 'mean', 'something', 'Honestly', 'think', 'who', 'found', 'poor', 'taste', 'probably', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'first', 'Rocky.In', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'fighting', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'life', 'ring', 'pursue', 'prove', 'own', 'existence', 'too', 'sentimental', 'Rocky', 'strike', 'balance', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'good', 'take', 'home', 'message', 'specially', 'volatile', 'times', 'when', 'human', 'spirit', 'be', 'defined', 'foes', 'enemies', 'Rocky', 'convince', 'more', 'struggle', 'ourselves.Its', 'very', 'fitting', 'finale', 'Im', 'quite', 'astonished', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'pulled', 'off', 'Even', 'end', 'where', 'ring', 'fight', 'even', 'called', 'much', 'admire', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'heart', 'many', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'boxing', 'movies', 'Ive', 'seen', 'recent', 'times.I', 'only', 'found', 'fault', 'fight', 'ended', 'well', 'choreography', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'line', 'credibility', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'most', '10', 'dozen', 'career', 'ending', 'haymakers', 'Rocky', 'seemed', 'absolutely', 'clueless', 'blocking', 'technique.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'instead', 'much', 'story', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'head', 'up', 'high']",N/A

But the TRUE FANS out there knew differently.  Even the critics, who initially made skeptical/negative comments about the sixth installment, started turning their stories around after viewing the film in its entirety.  Rocky Balboa is a real winner of a movie, that fully realizes the essence of the original classic and brings the saga full circle to a thrilling, emotional, and very memorable conclusion.Many years have gone by since last we saw Rocky, who is now a widower, estranged from his son and still mourning the loss of his beloved wife, Adrian.  There are some truly touching moments of Rocky at the cemetery, sitting by her grave (when I saw the film in theaters, no one in the audience made a sound - even the rowdy ones - during these scenes, out of pure respect for the characters) as well as Rocky's journey, with Paulie, to all the places he took Adrian on their classic first date.  So touching.Now Rocky has his own restaurant, where he greets his customers and regales them with past stories of glory.  But deep inside of him is a rage that he must get out of himself and conquer in order to move on with his life.  The only way to do that is to go back in the ring.  But when a computer simulated match between Rocky and the current reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason Dixon, is shown on TV, showing Rocky as the victor, word spreads like wildfire for the real thing.No Rocky film is complete without a training montage, and this film's got it in spades.  Stallone has the character of Rocky so integrated within himself, and gives nothing short of one of his finest performances on screen.  Many memorable scenes, including Rocky's long and emotional talk with his son, as well as his new relationship with Marie (the young woman Rocky walked home back in the first installment) make for truly compelling drama.  And the climactic fight at the finale is the icing on the cake.

They went all in with IV and made a superhero film, and V was a mess - trying to put all the formula of the original film together, and it is horrible on so many levels.Then, years and years and years later out comes ""Rocky Balboa"" and it is a wonderful film, with its harshest critics being those persons who have never seen it.  This is age appropriate Rocky - old, retired, running a restaurant, still a part of his neighborhood and beloved my many, who, after a computer bout with a modern day contender is able to enter into a ""let's see what will happen"" match.The beautiful aspect of this film that it fits well both as a sixth film, but even more so as a direct sequel to the original.  It has that same quieter feel of the fighter finding his way back into the show biz spotlights.  The story is told in a believable enough way that one does not have to stretch too far to see how the old guy could fight the young one.  The character of ""Little Marie"" is back (though a woman now for sure) and becomes the love interest.If you are looking for superhero antics, this is not that kind of Rocky, but if you want a great film, with good pacing, characters, and a look at state of boxing today, I recommend ""Rocky Balboa.""

In it, he speaks of the story line, the camera work, the lighting and the thought that went into each scene.The movie shows us the 'dumb' Rocky, with slower speech and seeming inability to reason well, when, in fact, the character's 'dumb' responses are actually wisdom and patience, as the character sees, for example, an obnoxious and superficial boss at his son's job, yet does not comment on it.  When dealing with brother-in-law, Paulie, Rocky allows him to take his verbal shots, yet remains kind.  In this, the writer attempted to make a Christ-like character in which he lives to benefit others, sacrificing for others.  It's a wonderful, touching movie and restored to us the lovable character from Rocky I and Rocky II.  The additional of Geraldine Hughes (""Little Marie"") was a perfect piece of the puzzle, allowing the audience to see Rocky fall in love, as he still has a future, in spite of his age.  Critics will ridicule as they do, but audiences loved the movie, and will continue to love the DVD, especially the cut out scenes and the alternate ending.  One of my favorite movies!

As I sit here I can't remember if I ever saw the entire movie. I think I always bailed out of it before it was over. I never thought that one was worthy of being the last Rocky movie so it was nice that this one came out. Whether it's because I feel like I know the core characters from all those times seeing the movies as a kid or not, they still have a way of getting to me.I didn't read about the movie, didn't talk with anyone about it, didn't look into it at all until I first saw it on HBO or Showtime or whoever aired it a couple months ago. Since #5 was so bad I didn't rush into this one. I have been happily surprised. The first (and one of the hardest) punch of the movie is seeing the name on the headstone. I had no idea Adrian was dead in this one before that moment, and nointention of mentioning her death in my review but after 20 seconds on this page I saw it has been mentioned tons of times already so I don't think I'm letting a secret out.Adrian was always such a cutie pie sweety, and she was also sort of the Edith Bunker of the Rocky films. In many ways she was the strength and conscience. All the things that some reviewers have considered to be the slow, depressing stuff before the movie (aka the boxing) begins is the stuff I love. There's genuine feeling there. It's a drag that Talia Shire didn't get to be in this one but much of the movie is a fitting tribute to the strength of the character she brought to life. I like that.Also, this Rocky most imitates real life. There's no villain to conquer and there's no ascension to, nor fall from greatness. It's a story about the people, places and memories that make a life.My gripe about the movie is the training montage. Donning the same grey sweatshirt/sweatpants from the first movie, punching the meat, etc... was too obvious for me. I don't like things to be so blatant. Also, my favorite passage of the famous Rocky musics is only touched on for one small part as the credits are rolling. That was a bummer.Still, what really matters in this one is that Rocky has always been a good guy and he even delivers a street-corner speech that the USA could and should really take to heart. ""It's not how hard you hit."" We'd be a better nation because of it.

It began, ironically, with Rocky V, which I saw in the theaters, and worked my way back. I loved every aspect of the story: determination, courage, patriotism, and faith, rolled into an everyman, beaten, but not broken, uneducated, but wise.""Rocky Balboa"" concludes the story. Rocky's back in the old neighborhood, running a restaurant named for his late wife. Adrianne's passed from the ""woman cancer."" Rocky entertains his guests with tales of his former glory days. However his nostagia hurts his current relationships, especially with Paulie, the same as he's always been, and his son Robert. Even time itself is leaving Rocky behind, as all his former haunts are torn down. Even his statue's gone.Still, he feels a ""beast"" he can't get out, and seeks one last shot. He gets it when a computer puts him against the current champion, and has him winning. The champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, is desparate for a real challenge, and the subsequent self-respect that comes from it. So, he challenges Rocky to a special exhibition bout.And this is where the film truly shines. Rocky's tapping into his roots: running the steps, pounding the beef slabs, drinking the eggs. He's also supported by characters from earlier movies, especially Little Marie, the girl he walked home in ""Rocky,"" and Spider Rico, his opponent from the beginning.The fight rounds off the movie perfectly. Even the fight ends the way it should.The movie's even a good piece of filmmaking. One thing I noticed was the light work.

Rocky sets him straight on that in the most stern yet loving way, and father and son are reunited.At first I feared there was going to be a romance between Rocky and Little Marie, but two things happened that told me it wasn't going to happen, at least in this film: Rocky comes right out and tells Marie ""She's gone, but she's not gone, you know?"" speaking of Adrian. And when Marie comes to his hotel room before the fight, it's to give him a picture of Adrian to inspire him. She wouldn't bring a picture of the dead wife if she was hoping for anything else to happen. And I agree with a couple other reviewers: the best part was the end, when Rocky gathers his family around him before the score is read and says ""Let's go"". He doesn't care if he won or lost.

Sylvester Stallone brings back to life the heart and spirit of Rocky as no one else can do.  All the love, faith, hope, desire, and raw guts are presented in this film to stir the heart and inspire the soul for a life time.  Growing up with the Rocky films, I found this one to be particular dear to my heart and soul because, reaching middle age, this picture shakes up the indominable spirit within to remind me (us) that it ain't over till it's really over.  Sly does all his stunts and choreography in the fight scenes plus brings in some spontaneous adrenalin filled punches that has him and opponent going at it.  There is bonus features like the stuff behind the scenes including boxing sparing and Sly's weight lifting routines which would normally kill other people.  The movie makes no pretenses, and does not try to make an old guy look young like so many other movies do when they have old stars come back with their hair dyed and gut sucked in.  No, in this movie, Rocky IS Rocky, a guy in his sixties, gaunt, beat up and wracked by life's  pounding, but full of heart, courage and a rekindled fire.  This movie isn't about an old guy trying to prove himself to the world but about a fighter who rediscovers himself, revisting himself back to his roots as a fighter, and doing the only thing he knows how to do and what he was made to do- fight!  In fact, there are no villians in this movie as we see that both Rocky and his opponent, Mason Dixon (a real professional boxer by the name of Antonio Tarver) are driven and motivated for different reasons which leads them to the final battle field of the boxing ring.

There was really no point to it and it really just came off as cheesy and unbelievable.I mean Rocky is older, and although his character comes still quite strong as in any of the other films, everyone around him are just weak and lacking characters. Steps, his son, Paulie even are just standing around with frowns and a frozen stare for most of the film while Rocky still goes on and on about the world being lousy and you have to take your hits and get back up- you know all the same stuff he went on about in the other films before. And now it is just old to hear about.Along with the lack of any real characters to care about besides Rocky, the story itself is just a little too unbelievable in my opinion. He being able to last in the ring with that young and uninteresting boxer I found a little silly and it wasn't played out in any way exciting.The story is boring, the characters are worse- the only thing that helps this movie go to just 'okay' status is Rocky himself. After loving the character for so long through Rocky 1-4 (5 was pretty iffy too for me) you want to see how he turns out regardless. But besides the loveable Rocky character, nothing else is worthwhile to watch. So I say stick with Rocky 1-4, even 5 for it did have its moments, but it's not worth the time to watch this one.

The obstacles are substantial - even if you take the ""how in the world can anyone be expected to buy a man Stallone's age as able to hold his own against the heavyweight champ?"" issue out of the equation.  Does the audience even care about this guy any more?  Can Talia Shire's absence be compensated for?  Will Rocky's relationship with his son be even remotely plausible?  Can the bombast that is Bill Conti's score, not to mention the tunes penned by Sly's brother Frank Stallone, be endured for another hour and 42 minutes?  It really is amazing that, with so much seemingly working against it, this film is a pleasure to watch.  Yes, it walks the same well-worn road every other ""Rocky"" film has, both literally and figuratively.  Yes, there's no way to replace Burgess Meredith, and his absence has been felt keenly since ""Rocky III.""  But Rocky and his son seem believable, his burgeoning relationship with Little Marie feels real (and she's no young cookie, thankfully), and the climactic fight is emotionally satisfying in that ""Rocky"" way - you know, that ""man, I wish real heavyweight fights were this much fun to watch!"" way.  They throw more punches in one round than most heavyweight fights see in 15.  Yes, there are problems; the reigning heavyweight champ is very two-dimensional (and would never be as universally hated as he is portrayed, regardless of his demeanor - lots of people love to cheer for self-absorbed thugs), the commentary by Jim Lampley and others is chock full of cliches, and it's all just so predictable.  But, in spite of all that, I really enjoyed watching it - simply because Stallone has created an imminently likeable character in Rocky Balboa, one you can't help but care about and cheer for.

""Rocky Balboa"" is a simpler creation, more of a meditation on aging than a boxing flick. I liked it. It's humble and sincere; Stallone seeks to give purpose to life after 50 but has stopped trying to butter up his own image. Rocky's not ending racism or slurring for an end to the Cold War. He's just a ""yo"" with an itch to box.Because actress Talia Shire refused to return to the franchise, the storyline reveals that Rocky's wife, Adrian, has died from cancer. Rocky mourns weekly at her gravestone. And he's named a restaurant after her. It's a cozy place where Rocky can tell stories and nurse wounds. Somewhat estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia), Rocky spends hours haunting South Philadelphia with Paulie (Burt Young).His routine changes when he runs into neighborhood girl Marie (Geraldine Hughes). Marie's a bit of a love interest, but more an opportunity for Rocky to reconnect with the outer world. Once he does, he senses a ""beast"" inside. It says, ""Box.""And he'll get his shot in an exhibition against the heavyweight champion. Stallone makes this ridiculous scenario borderline plausible - just look at the state of boxing, and you have to admit it might happen - by integrating ESPN and HBO TV personalities into the screenplay.The fight itself - against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon - is a schizophrenic mix of a HBO broadcast and ""Raging Bull"" choreography.

After a very disappointing Rocky V, I decided that I was just going to watch this final film for the sake of completeness, but I expected it to be a bad, or at best a neutral, experience. To my surprise, the end of the saga is really good, with a nicely built story, and a movie which provides the whole journey with an elegant symmetry.Adrian has died, victim to cancer, and Rocky owns a restaurant that is successful only by virtue of the fame of its owner. Patrons visit the establishment looking for a first-hand story, or a picture, or an autograph. Meanwhile, Rocky's son is trying to make it in the corporate world, but is having a tough time dealing with being a celebrity's son. This in turn puts a strain in the relationship with his father that takes a big toll on Rocky. When a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight champion and the old hero takes place on Sportscenter, with a controversial result, the door opens for the return of the people's champion.I am extremely glad I was wrong about this film, since this provides a classy ending to one of the best collection of sports movies of all time. Stallone delivers a much better performance than I expected after watching him being a guest in Monday Night Football. He has some restrictions in terms of facial expressions, but this does works well with the character, and he provides the needed level of passion and energy. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Robert Jr., also adds to the quality of this movie, since he is right on target with his performance, portraying the inner conflicts of his character masterfully. The final fight might not be the best we have seen in this series of movies, but it is definitely adequate.Anyone that has been following the Rocky movies needs to watch this final installment.

I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him.As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive ""politically correct"" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky.Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa??Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?  Only a little because of the gargantuan soda I drank throughout the movie.

1052777,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000N3AXQU,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[4, 4]","When this film was announced over a year ago, the chuckles and jokes(If I had a nickel for every friggin' time someone said ""what, is he gonna fight in a wheelchair?"", I'd buy a yacht) began.  After all, the Rocky series was being poked fun at back at #4.  Stallone was obviously well aware of how people would react to the concept of another Rocky film on the surface, and wrote his script accordingly.  The people in the film feel the same way about Rocky as the folks in the real world who laughed the movie off.  It is great screenwriting on Stallone's part and made people and critics think twice about the movie.  This turned out to be a damn good movie, and most folks agree.  The movie is done as if Parts 3, 4, and 5 didn't exist.  You could almost look at it as the true Rocky 3.  There are really no references to the other films, at least none that would make a difference.  It seems as though Stallone wanted to really get back to the roots of the story and get back in touch with the character.  Over the course of the sequels(parts 3 and 4 specifically), he seemed to have lost touch with the character a bit.  As Rocky became more famous and wealthy, he also suddenly spoke more intelligently(he pretty much spoke the way Stallone did in all of his 80s action films), and became a bit more high brow.  Rocky's always been a lovable, generous guy with a big heart, but a little punchy and loopy, and in this film Rocky seems to have his personality back.  On the other hand, you can still assume the events of the sequels happened as well, coz there really is nothing to contradict that they happened.  Here we see Rocky living alone, wandering the neighborhood, wondering what happened to everything he loved.  His wife, Adrian has passed on and he simply can't get over it.  His son sees him more as a bother than anything and only seems to talk to him out of necessity.  Even the folks who all once glorified him as a hero just seem to regard him with little enthusiasm.  He's just a relic in the sports world.  It's all kinda depressing actually, especially a sequence where he drags his brother in-law, Paulie, along with him to revisit locations where he and Adrian used to frequent, while he reminisces about their times together.  He also owns a restaurant and that seems to be the only joy he has.  He does befriend a woman(the girl on the street corner he gives a pep talk to in the original Rocky film) and her son, and they become good friends.  Not romantic, but the potential is there.  When a computer generated fight putting Rocky(in the prime of his career) against the current world champion shows Rocky kicking the champ's butt, opportunity knocks.  The champ(Antonio Tarver, who had to beef up to play a heavyweight fighter) doesn't like the embarrassment.  He also has personal demons of his own.  His managers and the boxing promoters see this as a goldmine opportunity and soon they're knocking on Rocky's door.  Rocky's been bored for so long and has nothing to lose, so he decides to do it.  What the hell, right?  Plus, Rocky sees it as a way to feel like somebody again whether he wins or loses, as long as he goes the distance, does his best, and can prove to everybody that he's not some old fogey that is just gonna get knocked on his butt in the second round.  In a way, it's alot like the first film in that regard, that he really has nothing to lose and is doing it more to prove something to himself rather than everyone else.  The fight is visually probably the best and most realistic of the series with the first few minutes looking as though you're actually watching a Pay Per View bout.  Pretty cool.  How does it turn out?  Watch it!  Stallone definitely scored a knockout with this one.

1052779,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000N3AXQU,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 8]","TheRockyfranchise is a part of our American culture now.  The original Rocky film went on to win Best Picture and many believe Stallone who was nominated for Best Actor that year only lost because another great actor, Peter Finch, had died that year after filmingNetworkand the award was given to him posthumously.  Stallone over the years turned out some great performances such as inF.I.S.T.,First Blood,Cop Land, andNighthawksand we see him return to his roots of great acting in this film.  I would not have been surprised to seem him squeek out a Best Actor nod for this film, but that didn't happen and I think it should have happened.  Regardless, Stallone has proven once again that he can command the screen as actor, writer, and director like few can.  He's no Mel Gibson or Clint Eastwood, but he is, nevertheless, very competent at each task.  He managed a $24 million dollar budget (not bad for a sixth trip to the sequel well), and it earned over $100 million.This latest and perhaps last entry into the Rocky franchise is much better than expected and actually picks up the story in a very believable fashion.  Most sport has-beens typically end up opening a bar or restaurant when their careers are over and tend to tell the same stories over and over again to anyone who will listen.  Rocky is no different here, and like others before him in the boxing industry he feels he has one more good fight in him.  Thus begins a very believable story.In addition, Stallone doesn't forget that Rocky had friends and family who were affected by his boxing life.  Rocky sort of forgets that a bit when he wants Paulie to run around with him and mourn over his losses, forgetting that Paulie had lost a lot himself and he stands in stark contrast to Rocky as he always did and to Paulie's credit, he sees that.  Adding to this, Rocky's son feels he must forever walk in his father's shadow and ""you cast a big one"" he tells him, but Rocky does appropriately tell him in return,"" don't blame 'shadows' for not making your own way in the world.""This is a thoughtful Rocky that we saw coming in the last Rocky film,Rocky V, where he knew he couldn't really fight anymore, but wanted to somehow stay close to the action.  That effort failed when his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in that film abandoned him and the story ended with a street brawl, a place where Rocky has always ruled.  I personally think that that Rocky film failed as his legion of fans hated to see him grow older, but I think it was a clever new direction for Rocky and a logical one and this film follows in that sequel's footsteps; however, we are now more accepting of an aging Rocky as this film opens 30 years after the original did.  Rocky is like your family photoalbum or your old favorite sweatshirt.  He brings up a well of memories that make us feel good, but also saddens us as we realize time has marched on for all of us.  In this film we get to relive similar themes from previous Rocky films that are still important.This film covers similar ground from some previous Rocky films such as the aging fighter who believes he has one more good fight in him and goes the route of an exhibition fight to get it like Apollo Creed did inRocky IVagainst Drago from Russia.Rocky IIIdealt with having the ""Eye of the Tiger"" and overcoming one's fears, both issues the current champion tackles himself.  As already mentioned,Rocky Vdealt with what every sports person dreads, retirement.  The interesting thing in this film is how we see so much of the original Rocky film in this last one.  You know it's a swan song here and a beautiful one at that.In the very first Rocky film he isn't concerned with winning as much as still not being looked at as ""another bum from the neighborhood"" (a quote from the first film).  He doesn't even stay in the ring at the end to hear who won the exhibition fight.  It simply doesn't matter to him.  He already proved long ago that he wasn't a just another bum from the neighborhood; however, in this one he just wants to get out the rage in his heart (over losing Adrian) and that annoying feeling that there is still something left floating in his ""basement"" (soul) over a life not quite complete yet.  Paulie jokingly responds with, ""What?  You don't think you've peaked yet?""  We all laugh with him on that, but understand that even when we've peaked in life, there may still be something burning in us.  Rocky reminds us to not ignore that regardless of our age.In that vein, Stallone smartly wears little makeup to cover his age in this film, even though he still looks very good for 58.  Heck, I wish I looked that good at my current 43.  He does, however, add on some eye makeup to Rocky to clearly show the power behind the beatings he had taken in his career and he does little to shed the extra weight he's put on as we all typically do over time.  Don't get me wrong; I wouldn't want to mess with Stallone one on one no matter what the weight.  He is still in remarkably good condition, but he's obviously aged too.  Age isn't a regret in of itself, but an incomplete or unfulfilled life is.Many are not aware of this, but the original script, to which I have a copy, had Rocky not only losing the fight in the first film, like he did, but also going home with Adrian in a cab.  He rests his head on her shoulder and says ""I fought my whole life to be something more than just another bum from the neighborhood and tonight I was.  Boy, I'm tired"", and with that Rocky dies in Adrian's arms having fought his heart out, literally.  The producers convinced him that the audience wouldn't accept such a downer ending, so he rewrote it.  Ironically and without giving anything away here, this Rocky ends at a cemetery.  One can't help but feel that as much as we love Rocky and how he so often embodies the common man's struggle to overcome obstacles, we can't stop time.Rocky will live on for generations.  For us older folks, he reminds us of who we once were, wanted to be and might still be and for younger audiences he is an encourager to be all they can be while they can.  In Rocky's words in this final film of the franchise, ""Life isn't about how many times you are hit, but how many times you are hit and still keep on moving forward.""  In that, Rocky continues to encourage us all.",4,Rocky Can Still Pack a Punch!,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,6306,"['TheRockyfranchise', 'part', 'American', 'culture', 'now', 'original', 'Rocky',

1052780,A2KBF2OYR359AJ,B000N3AXQU,"Steven R. McEvoy ""MCWPP""","[24, 26]","Yes this is a review of the 6th and final installment in the Rocky saga. Rocky has been called the greatest underdog story of all time. It has been given two thumbs up by Elbert & Roeper; it has been given rave reviews and is currently 3rd in box office holiday season sales. With all of that, why would Imprint review this movie as well? The answer to that question is how the movie is relevant to students.Rocky Balboa is called a truly inspirational story. It is the story of a man who has had it all, lost most of it and rebuilt what he could. The film was written, directed and starred in by Sylvester Stallone. But this story is older than even that. For Stallone wrote the first Rocky story and held on to it for years. He would not sell it because no one would let him star in it. With his perseverance and determination, he held onto the script until he could play the role of Rocky.In this film, Rocky is again the underdog. He is 53, retired, and running a restaurant. He is also widowed, and looking for something more in life. He decides to try and fight again - he is thinking something local, for charity. And yet he is given a shot at the champ.This is a story of overcoming - the story of living your hopes and dreams. It is about believing in yourself and following those dreams. Rocky states: ""What is it you said to the kid? The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very rough, mean place... and no matter how tough you think you are, it'll always bring you to your knees and keep you there, permanently... if you let it. You or nobody ain't never gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... how much you can take, and keep moving forward. If you know what you're worth, go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit."" And he lives that in this film.Yet Rocky is not the only character to face this adversity in this film. Paulie, his brother-in-law, who only has his work and alcohol is laid off from his job. Rocky's son Robert has lost his way, and is trying to not live in his father's shadow. And each of these three men must deal with their grief at the loss of Adrian, who was wife, sister and mother to these three men.Rocky must also face his aging body. In the beginning of the training sequences he realizes that this will not be the simple battle of determination to get the body in shape. It will be in part mind over matter as he must reconquer and retrain his body to be that of a fighter.Rocky's opponent Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (played by actual former heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver) does not take the fight seriously, he has the youthful disregard and disrespect for age and experience that Rocky will bring to the ring in this battle of athletes from different eras.Rocky Balboa will motivate us to face our own challenges with perseverance and a community for support, and with hope and by prayer. The story will promote discussions about where we find our courage, what we want from life and how we can overcome loss and yet stand strong and remain faithful. It will also help us to classify what we call a victory.Rocky is not just another boxing movie, or even just a sport movie, and it is definitely not just a squeal. It is a movie that will help you find the courage to follow your dreams and encourage you to pursue hopes.So when the world knocks you down, you can either lay there or get up. That is what Rocky Balboa teaches us.(First Published in Imprint 2007-01-05 as 'Final Rocky flick hits home, the heart'.)",5,Inspiring,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,3591,"['Yes', 'review', '6th', 'final', 'installment', 'Rocky', 'saga', 'Rocky', 'been', 'called', 'greatest', 'underdog', 'story', 'time', 'been', 'given', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Elbert', 'Roeper', 'been', 'given', 'rave', 'reviews', 'currently', '3rd', 'box', 'office', 'holiday', 'season', 'sales', 'why', 'would', 'Imprint', 'review', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'answer', 'question', 'how', 'movie', 'relevant', 'students.Rocky', 'Balboa', 'called', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'story', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'all', 'lost', 'most', 'rebuilt', 'what', 'could', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'starred', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'story', 'older', 'even', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'first', 'Rocky', 'story', 'held', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'sell', 'one', 'would', 'let', 'star', 'perseverance', 'determination', 'held', 'script', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'Rocky.In', 'film', 'Rocky', 'again', 'underdog', '53', 'retired', 'running', 'restaurant', 'also', 'widowed', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'try', 'fight', 'again', 'thinking', 'something', 'local', 'charity', 'yet', 'given', 'shot', 'champ.This', 'story', 'overcoming', 'story', 'living', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'believing', 'following', 'dreams', 'Rocky', 'states', 'What', 'said', 'kid', 'world', 'ai', ""n't"", 'sunshine', 'very', 'rough', 'mean', 'place', 'matter', 'how', 'tough', 'think', 'are', ""'ll"", 'always', 'bring', 'knees', 'keep', 'there', 'permanently', 'let', 'nobody', 'ai', ""n't"", 'never', 'gon', 'hit', 'as', 'hard', 'life', 'ai', ""n't"", 'how', 'hard', 'hit', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'get', 'hit', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'worth', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'what', ""'re"", 'worth', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'willing', 'take', 'hit', 'film.Yet', 'Rocky', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'face', 'adversity', 'film', 'Paulie', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'only', 'work', 'alcohol', 'laid', 'off', 'job', 'Rocky', 'son', 'Robert', 'lost', 'way', 'trying', 'not', 'live', 'father', 'shadow', 'three', 'men', 'must', 'deal', 'grief', 'loss', 'Adrian', 'who', 'was', 'wife', 'sister', 'mother', 'three', 'men.Rocky', 'must', 'also', 'face', 'aging', 'body', 'beginning', 'training', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'simple', 'battle', 'determination', 'get', 'body', 'shape', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'mind', 'over', 'matter', 'must', 'reconquer', 'retrain', 'body', 'be', 'fighter.Rocky', 'opponent', 'Mason', 'Line', 'Dixon', 'played', 'actual', 'former', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'Antonio', 'Tarver', 'not', 'take', 'fight', 'seriously', 'youthful', 'disregard', 'disrespect', 'age', 'experience', 'Rocky', 'will', 'bring', 'ring', 'battle', 'athletes', 'different', 'eras.Rocky', 'Balboa', 'will', 'motivate', 'face', 'own', 'challenges', 'perseverance', 'community', 'support', 'hope', 'prayer', 'story', 'will', 'promote', 'discussions', 'where', 'find', 'courage', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'how', 'can', 'overcome', 'loss', 'yet', 'stand', 'strong', 'remain', 'faithful', 'will', 'also', 'help', 'classify', 'what', 'call', 'victory.Rocky', 'not', 'just', 'boxing', 'movie', 'even', 'just', 'sport', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'just', 'squeal', 'movie', 'will', 'help', 'find', 'courage', 'follow', 'dreams', 'encourage', 'pursue', 'hopes.So', 'when', 'world', 'down', 'can', 'either', 'lay', 'get', 'up', 'what', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'First', 'Published', 'Imprint', '2007-01-05', ""'Final"", 'Rocky', 'flick', 'home', 'heart']",N/A
1052781,A2BMDY4WJIDGG7,B000N3AXQU,S Tuffnell,"[0, 0]","Otherwise known as Rocky VI, this Stallone driven drama is not too bad at all. Having milked the franchise over the years Stallone is still able to pull the heartstrings. This one focuses on Rocky's comeback from retirement in an exhibition match with cocky prize fighter. You are on Rocky's side all the way as this capitalises as the battler making it good against all the odds, in other words the same formula as Rocky's I to V. Somehow it still works and this one is quite different than the others as Stallone really is getting too old so there is no denying where the agenda of the film lies.The fight sequences are suped up with music video style jump cuts, slow mo, razor sharp edits and some chilling camera work. It again works fine. Rocky is reduced to a shell of what he used to be since his fighting days but the drawcard of the film is to see how he overcomes the odds to get back in the ring and make a contest of himself. The acting is top notch, Adrian is featured in dream sequences showing how Rocky focuses on the past. It is great to see old timer coach Burt in his reprised role again. I like the scenes where Rocky is making friends with a new girl and her son, he seems genuine and is very honourable in his intentions.It is a likeable film, no swearing at all, and just a bit of blood when they get in the ring and slam each other into kingdom come. But that is expected. The final credits are fun showing many ordinary people making the famous run up the steps and, yes, Rocky music and the famous run up the steps happens from the big man himself, as well as thumping meat, downing raw eggs and running in the snow with his pet dog Punchy. It does not disappoint as a homage to the old Rocky's and Stallone in a hat looks the same as ever; the no good bum who fights for his passion, and it is not all about winning.

Unlike Rocky III and IV, which were almost cartoonish, there is real emotion and drama in R.B.  The movie is entertaining and inspiring.Some of the acting is good (Stallone, Hughes, Young) and some is lousy (Ventimiglia.)  [Note:  Why didn't Sage Stallone play Rocky's kid?]  The script is sufficient but a some of the dialog is embarrassing.  The emotional connections and Rocky's giant heart carry the film.The biggest problem with all the Rocky movies (from II forward,) is that the boxing sequences are, on some level, ridiculous.  It's nice to suspend one's belief once in awhile for the sake of entertainment, but it's almost insulting to pretend that fighters could take the types of beatings Rocky and his opponents take in these movies.  The best boxers to ever step foot in the ring couldn't wildly throw punches and take shots to the head for 10-12 rounds.  Fights just don't work that way.  Watching a 50-some year old ""retired"" fighter go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds with the heavyweight champion of the world, a fighter in is prime, is complete and utter farce.  For me, I would have been pleased to watch a match that was more paced and deliberate, in a word: realistic.Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching.

1052793,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B000N3AXQU,The Seeker,"[1, 1]","""Rocky Balboa"" is a 2006 drama starring Sylvester Stallone who also writes and directs the film. It is a sequel, but does not require first-time ""Rocky"" viewers to see the other movies to understand what's going on. It is also the sixth and final installment in the ""Rocky"" franchise.I never imagined there would be another Rocky sequel. After Rocky V, it was my dream film, and I always hoped one day there would be a Rocky VI.When Stallone announced that he was going to make a new Rocky movie, I was thrilled about getting to be able see a brand new, fresh Rocky story set in contemporary times on the big screen for the first time ever, and with an adult perspective.To this day, I have never been more excited to see a movie. When I first saw it at the theater, I had the biggest smile on my face and was so excited as I heard the famous Rocky music, and saw the words ""ROCKY BALBOA"" scrolling across the screen. I was like a little kid at a candy store.As the movie begins, we learn that Adrian has passed away, and Rocky and his son, Robert, now a grown man, and busy with his own life, seem to have grown apart.Rocky is also running his very own Italian restaurant in dedication to his late wife, and spends most of his time telling his customers old boxing stories, and spends the rest of his time walking around his old neighborhood, remembering the past.This is where the movie gets VERY bittersweet for me. I grew up on the Rocky movies, from the crib on up. I actually have baby pictures of me holding Rocky toys, and as I watched my boyhood hero in this film walk around South Philly, I felt very sentimental the same way Rocky did, and can totally understand everything he is feeling as he remembers good old times. If you have any nostalgia for the Rocky movies, I believe you'll enjoy those scenes.When a computer generated fight on ESPN is staged between Rocky and the current Heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon, Rocky decides to go back to boxing which plenty of people in the film disprove of, in the same way some people seem to disapprove of this movie all because of Rocky's/Sly's age.Many people seem to dislike this film just because Stallone was 59-years old when the movie was made. I don't think a lot of people who think Sly was too old to be doing another Rocky movie understood the big picture behind the story: Yes, Rocky is too old to be boxing...that's the plot of the movie. If you look at the trailer for this film, it shows clips of various people telling Rocky he's crazy and way too old to be boxing the heavyweight champion of the world.Sly is not pretending to be young, and the whole point of the story is that despite being much older, he still had the heart and determination to go the distance.A lot of people are also not aware that...(like the original Rocky)....""Rocky Balboa"" was inspired by a true story. In 1994, a much older and overweight George Foremen stepped into the ring with twenty-something year heavyweight champion Michael Moorer. Moorer was twenty years younger then Foremen and in much better shape, but Foremen still was able to defeat the younger champion for the title, and that was when the seed of doing another Rocky sequel was first planted in Sly's head.To me personally, Sly's age is a good thing and one of the things that appeals to me because it makes me feel young again. As I get older, I don't see movies the same way I use to because most of the actors are around my age, or younger, and I see them as equals or inferiors. I don't see them as Kings like I use to when I was a kid because back then, all the big stars were older then me, and I didn't see them as equals or inferiors. I saw them as superiors because they were older then me. With this film, I am able to revert back to my youth-like mindset.Why do sequels get made? Because the first one made a lot of money. But this is a movie that was made because Stallone really wanted to make it. In fact, he didn't have an easy time getting this movie made. The scene where Rocky argues to get his boxing license back I believe was inspired by the fact that Stallone had to fight very hard to make his vision come true.Getting back to the movie: Rocky's opponent is real life boxing champion, Antonio Tarver. I think he is one of Rocky's best opponents. I like that he acts more like a real human being, and less like a comic book villain like some of Rocky's past foes, not that there was anything wrong with that, but I liked that Sly tried something different in this movie.The fight is treated like a real life HBO pay-per-view match. It takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada, a city I've been too many times, and love, and that is another reason why I enjoy this movie. The boxing match is also shot in HD, you got all the stats on the screen, you have actual HBO commentators calling the fight, Joe Cortez is the referee, and Michael Buffer's the ring announcer. It's just like watching a real fight. I LOVE IT!Plus, all the hits you see are 100% real. I should know since I was an extra in the movie, and was there when the fight scene was being filmed. :-) Which is another reason why this film is special to me.Now out of all the Rocky fights, I think this is the best one, and the most realistic.I honestly feel ""Rocky Balboa"" is the greatest movie ever created. ""Rocky Balboa"" is a very emotional film. Just knowing it's the final time we're ever going to see that character. Out of all the Rocky films, it's the one that gives me the most goosebumps and it's not easy typing this, but there are scenes that tear me up every time, and films rarely do that. :-) The whole film is like a tribute to the whole series, mixed in with a great story.Just knowing how many people in real life were against the sixth Rocky film and mocked the idea, and just dislike or even refuse to watch it solely based on the character's age is similar to how the people in the story itself reacted to Rocky's comeback, and it was just crazy how quickly they abandoned him. One minute, they're with you, but as soon as you lose the ""normal"" tag, they dump you.Then the fight itself, the way it was filmed, the fact that it was shot in Vegas, which is my home away from home, and just knowing I was there in the crowd to be apart of it all.....It's just a very, very real film that brings out a lot of real emotions in me, and that is why it's my favorite movie. This movie is actually too good for me to watch sometimes. It's so good I find it hard to watch because it's sad knowing this is the final Rocky movie ever. This is my favorite movie of all time. I think it's the best Rocky movie, and the greatest comeback ever.",5,"""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."" - Eleanor Roosevelt",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,6642,"['Rocky',

1052794,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000N3AXQU,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Sylvester Stallone is feeling nostalgic lately. Between ""Rocky Balboa"" and the latestRamboinstallment, he's trying to resurrect past glories and reconfirm that his skills as a writer/director/actor are worth recalling as solid. ""Rocky Balboa"" goes a long way towards re-establishing Stallone's credibility for the better.""Rocky Balboa"" is a well done, feel good sixth chapter, redeeming the sometimes absurdity of the laterRockyfilms. Rocky is an older man, he's lost his Adriane but named his restaurant after her, has a son who hates living in a shadow. (Weird irony - years ago when Weird Al did a Rocky parody song toEye of The Tiger,he sang about Rocky opening a deli.) But 'Rock' wants one more chance to show what he's made of after a simulated ""Then Vs Now"" simulation shows a fight between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon.Cue Bill Conti and Stallone in sweats. Virtually a tribute to previousRocky flicks(complete with multiple flashbacks and Burt Young/Paulie), the movie offers feel-good comments and philosophical asides like a zen-boxing Master. Rocky befriends Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son as an antidote to his loneliness, but is far too honorable to move beyond just helping her out. Showing the arrogant champ that the must important muscle being a real champ has is his heart. Proving to glib cynical sportscasters that age is just a number. The movie is very predictable, refuses to play into a maudlin ending, and - most importantly - absolves Stallone from the last few years of sleepwalking through his 90's movies.Interesting note - the filming in Philadelphia had already wrapped when a snowstorm hit that day, and the opportunity for more dramatic settings had arrived. The crew quickly grabbed a camera and filmed an impromptu re-shoot of the street-running scenes, ending with Rocky charging up the steps of the Art Museum in the driven snow.",4,Saving Rocky,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1881,"['Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'lately', 'Between', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'latestRamboinstallment', 'trying', 'resurrect', 'past', 'glories', 'reconfirm', 'skills', 'writer/director/actor', 'are', 'worth', 'recalling', 'solid', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'long', 'way', 're-establishing', 'Stallone', 'credibility', 'better', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'well', 'done', 'feel', 'good', 'sixth', 'chapter', 'redeeming', 'sometimes', 'absurdity', 'laterRockyfilms', 'Rocky', 'older', 'man', 'lost', 'Adriane', 'named', 'restaurant', 'son', 'who', 'living', 'shadow', 'Weird', 'irony', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Weird', 'Al', 'did', 'Rocky', 'parody', 'song', 'toEye', 'Tiger', 'sang', 'Rocky', 'opening', 'deli', ""'Rock"", 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'simulated', 'Then', 'Vs', 'Now', 'simulation', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'current', 'champ', 'Mason', 'Dixon.Cue', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'Stallone', 'sweats', 'Virtually', 'tribute', 'previousRocky', 'flicks', 'complete', 'multiple', 'flashbacks', 'Burt', 'Young/Paulie', 'movie', 'feel-good', 'comments', 'philosophical', 'asides', 'zen-boxing', 'Master', 'Rocky', 'Marie', 'Geraldine', 'Hughes', 'son', 'antidote', 'loneliness', 'far', 'too', 'honorable', 'move', 'just', 'helping', 'out', 'Showing', 'arrogant', 'champ', 'must', 'important', 'muscle', 'being', 'real', 'champ', 'heart', 'Proving', 'glib', 'cynical', 'sportscasters', 'age', 'just', 'number', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'play', 'maudlin', 'ending', 'most', 'importantly', 'absolves', 'Stallone', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'sleepwalking', '90', 'movies.Interesting', 'note', 'filming', 'Philadelphia', 'had', 'already', 'wrapped', 'when', 'snowstorm', 'hit', 'day', 'opportunity', 'more', 'dramatic', 'settings', 'had', 'arrived', 'crew', 'quickly', 'grabbed', 'camera', 'filmed', 'impromptu', 're-shoot', 'street-running', 'scenes', 'ending', 'Rocky', 'charging', 'up', 'steps', 'Art', 'Museum', 'driven', 'snow']",N/A
1052795,A1IWVIOBEMZ5OQ,B000N3AXQU,Timothy D. Naegele,"[1, 1]","""Rocky Balboa"" is wonderful, and a ""must-see"" film for those who liked any of the earlier ""Rocky"" movies.  Sylvester Stallone has underscored once again that he is an enormous talent.Burt Young as ""Paulie"" is terrific as always; and Talia Shire as ""Adrian"" is missing, but her spirit is present throughout the movie and undergirds it.  If anyone could fill the void left by her absence, it is Geraldine Hughes as ""Marie,"" who is a lovely Irish lass, and is the perfect counterpoint to Sly.The photography is excellent; it is beautifully filmed, with wonderful flashbacks; and it is much more complicated and sophisticated than the earlier ""Rocky"" movies.  The casting is terrific, especially in the scenes set in Philadelphia.  Stallone was right to have chosen Antonio Tarver, who does a fine job as the fighter ""Mason Dixon.""  The fight scenes are very well staged--and photographed--even more so than the previous films.At one point, Paulie asks Rocky whether he's ""peaked yet?""  Perhaps the essence of the ""Rocky"" films is that none of us has peaked, ever, and that each of us marches to a different drummer.  Just when they say and believe that we can't do it, we say or believe that we can, and we attempt to do what few would conceive of doing.We challenge norms and sacred cows and status quos, and this life has meaning because we do it.  That is what ""Rocky"" has been about since the first film, and Sly Stallone has mastered the art in this one, truly mastered it.  He is great--there is no other adjective to describe him.And yes, there is a Bill of Rights and Americans do have rights--as Rocky observes--despite the fact that hack judges (who should be removed from the bench) and mean-spirited prosecutors (who should be disbarred) and politicians routinely ignore them and trample on them and spit on them daily throughout this great country.In short, ""Rocky Balboa"" has something for everyone, and it is a story that should go on forever, even though Stallone has said that this is his last ""Rocky"" film.  But Sly, we're just getting to know ""Rocky.""  And physically, all of us should look as good as Sly Stallone!Buy it or rent it when it becomes available on DVDs.

1052797,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000N3AXQU,Tom Benton,"[0, 0]","""It ain't over `til it's over,"" the tagline for ROCKY BALBOA proudly proclaims.  The truth of the matter is, as moviegoers realize and even Sylvester Stallone himself freely acknowledges, that it was over four films ago.  Why is it, then, that ROCKY BALBOA packs the most fierce and delightful punch since the original masterpiece?  Why is it that thirty years and five sequels later, we still leap up in our seats, toss our popcorn aside, and cheer for Rocky Balboa?  The answer is one word: heart.  The film has heart, and it has it because ROCKY BALBOA stays true to the heart of the original film, long before the increasingly silly sequels began flying like Balboa's much-acclaimed punches.In ROCKY BALBOA, the titular hero has given up his boxing career (which he actually did at the start of ROCKY V - remember ROCKY V?) and now runs a successful restaurant in the slums of Philadelphia.  His beloved wife Adrian has passed on, and his son has grown up to be an office worker haunted by his father's huge shadow.  His best friend Paulie (the wonderful Burt Young) continues to work in the meat shop.  Meanwhile, back in the ring, ferocious young fighter Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has taken over as the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and has absolutely no competition, having never been defeated in his career.  When a controversial ""fight simulation"" between Dixon and Rocky Balboa airs on ESPN, Dixon's publicity-starved managers attempt to set up an exhibition between the current and former Heavyweight Champions of the World.  To the dismay of most of Rocky's friends, he decides to fight Dixon, realizing that it may be the ultimate way to finally accept Adrian's passing.Although this film began building up immense hype immediately after it became known that it was being made, I was positive it would be the weakest of the series after viewing its outrageous trailer.  I don't think I was alone in that prediction, and I'm sure that there are still many people who avoided seeing this film because, well, five ROCKYs was enough.  However, I found that ROCKY BALBOA was my second cinematic surprise in a row (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  The surprise: ROCKY BALBOA is not the simply best ROCKY sequel - it's an excellent film as well.There's a number of reasons for that.  The biggest, as I said before, is heart.  The film's got heart, and the man responsible for it all is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is truly a wonder.  At sixty years old, he's in the best shape of his life (the guy is huge), he just cranked out an excellent ROCKY sequel (THE excellent ROCKY sequel), and he's about ready to begin production on the fourth RAMBO movie (a movie I'm highly anticipating).  Stallone's script for the movie is heartfelt and true to the spirit of the original film, and at times it's even quite clever; the ending is beautiful.  Stallone's directing is surprisingly classy, as is the gritty photography.  Longtime ROCKY fans may be pleased to learn that composer Bill Conti returns to the series for the first time since ROCKY III, and though most of the music is reused music from the original film, that's really all this movie needs.  One song in particular stands out.That song is, of course, ""Gonna Fly Now"", the soaring anthem that has been the ultimate workout tune for thirty years.  It's used in the inevitable ""training montage"", a sequence that the series has never had a problem with making interesting and enjoyable.  This montage is especially inspirational: we haven't seen one of cinema's most beloved heroes in sixteen years, and suddenly he bursts on to the scene and benches about three-hundred pounds more than I'll ever be able to.  I really felt like I was gonna fly now during that scene, and I know I'm not alone.Does ROCKY BALBOA have its flaws?  Sure.  It has the occasional laughable moment (particularly when Stallone mumbles something about dancing with bears), but for the most part Stallone knows when the film could wind up being hokey or silly or cliched and he avoids that.  The film is actually very funny intentionally, be it from Rocky's constant greeting of ""Yo, how you doin'?"" or a well-timed parody of the series' earlier entries.In the final round, and this is undoubtedly the final round, ROCKY BALBOA is the sweetest kind of surprise.  It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in years and seeing that he not only is still alive and kicking - or, in this case, punching - but also that he's doing better than ever.  The directing, the acting, the screenwriting, it's all top-notch, and that's all because of heart.  Heart goes a long way, and thanks to the heart of Sylvester Stallone, as well as his woefully-neglected mind, ROCKY BALBOA is a knockout.",5,The last knockout,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,4733,"['ai', ""n't"", 'til', 'over', 'tagline', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'proudly', 'truth', 'matter', 'moviegoers', 'realize', 'even', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'freely', 'was', 'four', 'films', 'ago', 'Why', 'then', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'most', 'fierce', 'delightful', 'punch', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'Why', 'years', 'five', 'sequels', 'later', 'still', 'leap', 'up', 'seats', 'popcorn', 'aside', 'cheer', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'answer', 'one', 'word', 'heart', 'film', 'heart', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'true', 'heart', 'original', 'film', 'long', 'increasingly', 'silly', 'sequels', 'began', 'flying', 'Balboa', 'much-acclaimed', 'punches.In', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'titular', 'hero', 'given', 'up', 'boxing', 'career', 'actually', 'did', 'start', 'ROCKY', 'V', 'remember', 'ROCKY', 'V', 'now', 'successful', 'restaurant', 'slums', 'Philadelphia', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'passed', 'son', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'office', 'worker', 'haunted', 'father', 'huge', 'shadow', 'best', 'friend', 'Paulie', 'wonderful', 'Burt', 'Young', 'work', 'meat', 'shop', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'ring', 'ferocious', 'young', 'fighter', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'Antonio', 'Tarver', 'taken', 'over', 'Heavyweight', 'Champion', 'World', 'absolutely', 'competition', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'defeated', 'career', 'When', 'controversial', 'fight', 'simulation', 'Dixon', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'ESPN', 'Dixon', 'publicity-starved', 'managers', 'attempt', 'set', 'up', 'exhibition', 'current', 'former', 'Heavyweight', 'Champions', 'World', 'dismay', 'most', 'Rocky', 'friends', 'fight', 'Dixon', 'realizing', 'may', 'be', 'ultimate', 'way', 'finally', 'accept', 'Adrian', 'passing.Although', 'film', 'began', 'building', 'up', 'immense', 'hype', 'immediately', 'became', 'known', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'was', 'positive', 'would', 'be', 'weakest', 'series', 'viewing', 'outrageous', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'alone', 'prediction', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'film', 'well', 'five', 'ROCKYs', 'was', 'enough', 'However', 'found', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'was', 'second', 'cinematic', 'surprise', 'row', 'first', 'being', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'surprise', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'not', 'simply', 'best', 'ROCKY', 'sequel', 'excellent', 'film', 'well.There', 'number', 'reasons', 'biggest', 'said', 'heart', 'film', 'got', 'heart', 'man', 'responsible', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Stallone', 'truly', 'wonder', 'sixty', 'years', 'old', 'best', 'shape', 'life', 'guy', 'huge', 'just', 'cranked', 'out', 'excellent', 'ROCKY', 'sequel', 'THE', 'excellent', 'ROCKY', 'sequel', 'about', 'ready', 'begin', 'production', 'fourth', 'RAMBO', 'movie', 'movie', ""'m"", 'highly', 'anticipating', 'Stallone', 'script', 'movie', 'heartfelt', 'true', 'spirit', 'original', 'film', 'times', 'even', 'quite', 'clever', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'Stallone', 'directing', 'surprisingly', 'classy', 'gritty', 'photography', 'Longtime', 'ROCKY', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'pleased', 'learn', 'composer', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'ROCKY', 'III', 'most', 'music', 'reused', 'music', 'original', 'film', 'really', 'movie', 'One', 'song', 'particular', 'stands', 'song', 'course', 'Gon', 'Fly', 'Now', 'soaring', 'anthem', 'been', 'ultimate', 'workout', 'tune', 'thirty', 'years', 'used', 'inevitable', 'training', 'montage', 'sequence', 'series', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'making', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'montage', 'especially', 'inspirational', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'cinema', 'most', 'beloved', 'heroes', 'sixteen', 'years', 'suddenly', 'scene', 'benches', 'three-hundred', 'pounds', 'more', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'gon', 'fly', 'now', 'scene', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone.Does', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'have', 'flaws', 'Sure', 'occasional', 'laughable', 'moment', 'particularly', 'when', 'Stallone', 'something', 'dancing', 'bears', 'most', 'part', 'Stallone', 'when', 'film', 'could', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'hokey', 'silly', 'cliched', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'intentionally', 'be', 'Rocky', 'constant', 'greeting', 'Yo', 'how', 'doin', 'well-timed', 'parody', 'series', 'earlier', 'final', 'round', 'undoubtedly', 'final', 'round', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'sweetest', 'kind', 'surprise', 'seeing', 'old', 'friend', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'seeing', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'alive', 'kicking', 'case', 'punching', 'also', 'doing', 'better', 'ever', 'directing', 'acting', 'screenwriting', 'top-notch', 'heart', 'Heart', 'long', 'way', 'thanks', 'heart', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'as', 'well', 'woefully-neglected', 'mind', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'knockout']",N/A

If I were to buy the series this one and V would definitely be left out.What was wrong with this movie is not the plot but the deliverance.  I felt no threat to Rocky like I did with Apollo, Mr. T, and Drago.  To me this movie was selling products; HBO, Tarver, etc.  It didn't have that same charm as the movies did.  You really couldn't root for Rocky because there was nothing for him to win or lose.  The main fight was an exhibition fight.  He didn't win any money, nor did he win a title.  Yes you could say he did it for himself, but, so what.  I was hoping he would've fought a fight that would bring him back on top, monitarily and he would be able to better his life.  I know it wasn't about the money, but the way it ended, just wasn't fulfilling.If you are a hardcore fan, you will like this movie.

1052801,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000N3AXQU,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","One of the pleasant surprises of 2006 is the ""come back"" of Sylvester Stallone, or Rocky Balboa, in his sixth and probably the final chapter that began back in 1976. The sixth ""Rocky"" film, or simply ""Rocky Balboa,"" turned out much better than people had expected, if not as great as the first Oscar-winning one which is now part of American movie history.Rocky Balboa, now retired, and running a restraint, steps into the ring for the last time. It's an exhibition match against Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), current heavy weight champion whose unpopularity is part of the reasons behind the match in Las Vegas. I am afraid the story is not as plausible as it should be, not because of the age of the star or Rocky himself, (who still looks in good shape), but because even the former champion like Rocky, I think, would have to fight his way more than the film describes, before the bout against the champion. The film's script is rushed at certain places like the relations between Rocky and his son, or the training scenes before the match.Still I liked ""Rocky Balboa"" for one reason. It is that Stallone, truly in character, delivers one of his best acting as Rocky, clearly aged, but still with dignity. The strength of the film is the character of Rocky himself, whose honesty and good-natured personality is exactly what makes this film special. There is no Adrian any more, but Stallone wisely brought back little girl Marie from the original, who is now living with her son. Geraldine Hughes is impressive as grown-up Marie, whose quiet interaction with Rocky reminds us of what he was like in the first Rocky film, where budding romance between him and Adrian played the major part of the story.The film is not flawless. The use of archive footages from the previous Rocky films is too much for me, and sometimes the film gets too sentimental.

Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 5]","Everything that made the best ""Rocky"" movies (""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"") blissfully entertaining appears conspicuously absent in Sylvester Stallone's new movie ""Rocky Balboa"" (** out of ****), reputedly the last Harri for the ""Rocky"" character. Chiefly, ""Rocky Balboa"" lacks spontaneity and surprises. Indeed, actor/athletic Sylvester Stallone looks--for a man in his sixties--like he could go the distance in the ring, but writer/director Sylvester Stallone virtually recycles the original without anything that made it Academy Awarding material. In ""Rocky,"" Stallone created a charming Brando-esquire misfit, surrounded by other larger-than-life misfits, who slugged his way to the top of the American dream. Each sequel eroded the title character's charisma, and you knew that ""Rocky"" could never go down for the count. Worse, Stallone's trademark aphoristic dialogue yields few quotable lines. Another element woefully amiss is a solid villain. A third of what made ""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"" engaging on a visceral level were the opponents. Carl Weathers established the baseline for Rocky's rivals in the first two ""Rocky"" movies, while a pugnacious Mr. T raised the bar in ""Rocky III"" and Goliath-like Dolph Lundgren took it one punch further in ""Rocky IV."" Not surprisingly, ""Rocky Balboa"" should take the bad taste of ""Rocky V"" out of the mouth of ""Rocky"" fans. ""Rocky V"" featured the least intimidating contender of the series. Unfortunately, as much as ""Rocky Balboa"" surpasses ""Rocky V,"" Rocky's latest adversary is bland to his boxers. Mason Dixon emerges as more vulnerable than vicious. You won't care if Rocky beats him to a pulp, gets beaten to a pulp himself, or they fight to a draw in ""Rocky Balboa."" This painfully predictable punching bag of clich&eacute;s never generates the blood, sweat, and cheers of the original.Anybody who remembers the forgettable ""Rocky V"" knows that the doctors warned Rocky that if he ever climbed back into the ring that he could possibly die from one blow to the brain. In ""Rocky Balboa,"" Rocky's physical ailments never impair his potential. Aside from a brief bout with the Pennsylvania boxing commission, Rocky obtains a license to box again. During the first hour of the action, our world-weary hero revisits his past on a sight-seeing trip to his old stomping grounds where he grew up and met his wife Adrian. Adrian has followed in the footsteps of more memorable ""Rocky"" characters, such as Apollo Creed and actor Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill. We learn in ""Rocky Balboa"" that Adrian died from cancer back in the 1990s, and Rocky supports himself with a Philadelphia restaurant named after her. He recounts his pugilistic exploits for the entertainment of his customers. Meanwhile, in the ring, the latest heavyweight boxing champ Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) finds himself tangled up in the ropes of his own troubles. After 30 knock-out fights, the undefeated Dixon cannot find anybody to go toe-to-toe with who can match his merciless barrage of blows. Worse, just about everybody in the fight game hates him. Sure, Dixon sounds like a terrific adversary, but Stallone gives Tarver nothing to do or say that makes his character remotely dangerous. He never attains the flamboyance of the egotistical Apollo Creed in the first three ""Rocky"" epics. He doesn't present a challenge like the sadistic Clubber Lang in ""Rocky III."" Physically, he is no match for towering Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV."" Instead, Mason Dixie emerges more as misunderstood than merciless.During his tour of his old neighborhood, Rocky runs into a local girl from his past. Marie (as played by the original ""Marie"" Geraldine Hughes) told him to bug off in the original when he offered her advice about her friends. Marie and Rocky get friendly this time around and the ex-champ shows an interest in her fatherless son. Unfortunately, the romance between Marie and Rocky ignites no sparks because the chemistry between them is wrong. At the same time, Rocky's own son Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia who plays Peter Petrelli on the NBC/SCI-FI Channel TV show ""Heroes"") has his own selfish issues. Rocky overshadows him. At one point, Rocky confides in his boorish brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young of ""The Killer Elite"") that he still has his own unresolved issues. Paulie thinks Rocky has lost his mind when he proposes to put the gloves back on for one more bout. The inevitable fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon occurs as a result of an ESPN computer generated boxing match that prompts Mason's managers to approach Rocky about a match. Mason Dixie derides it as a publicity stunt, but Rocky sees it as a place in the sun. ""Rocky Balboa"" boasts too much soul and not enough heart. Cue ""Rocky"" composer Bill Conti to bring on the music from the original as Rocky jogs around Philadelphia in his sweats training.Sylvester Stallone looks more muscle-bound than ever, but he does not have the underdog charisma of the best ""Rocky"" movies. Clearly, Stallone has gone into the ring one time too often. The Rocky character has never looked so out of place and his actions do little to endear him. Stallone's worst mistake in ""Rocky Balboa"" was sacrificing Adrian from his screenplay than his obnoxious, cigar-chomping brother-in-law Paulie. The first hour of the new ""Rocky"" drags and the last forty minutes doesn't make up for it. Stallone stages the boxing match without flair. Amazingly, the hand-held photography doesn't add energy to the fight. Despite some moments that remain too far and few between, ""Rocky Balboa"" has no clout to flout.",2,Not Rocky Enough For Me,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,5632,"['Everything', 'made', 'best', 'Rocky',

1052804,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000N3AXQU,Wayne C. Rogers,"[3, 3]","When I first moved to Las Vegas in 1986, I lucked out and got a two-week job as an extra in the Sylvester Stallone movie, Over the Top.  The filming took place at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and dealt with the arm wrestling contest that Stallone's character enters so that he can win enough money to take care of his son.  I was a member of the audience in the arena.  Before Stallone would come onto the set to film a particular scene, the Assistant Director would rev the audience up by playing the theme to Rocky, ""Gonna Fly Now.""  Of course, the audience didn't really need to be revved up for Stallone.  I, and the hundreds of other people sitting in the stands, saw Stallone as his fictional character, and we would stand up and loudly cheek out of pure admiration.  To us, Stallone was Rocky.  Things haven't really changed much since that moment in time over twenty years ago.  For me, Stallone is Rocky and will always be so.  I still get a big, goofy grin on my face whenever I hear the theme to Rocky.  So for me, Rocky Balboa was a dream come true.  It was a chance to relieve the original ""Rocky"" movie and to reach a better understanding of the last thirty years of my life.  More than that, however, it gave me hope for the future.  Rocky Balboa is a true spark of life for all of us in my age bracket who are having trouble moving ahead.  This is a movie about not giving up and being able to take the hits that come your way.  It's certainly true for the character of Rocky as well as its creator, Sylvester Stallone and what he had to go through to get Rocky Balboa made.  Let me just say this.  The budget for Rocky Balboa was around twenty-four million dollars, which is extremely low for a movie in today's time.  For a film to break even, it has to make at least three times what it cost, which also covers distribution and the percentage that the theaters get from the sell of each ticket.  To date, the worldwide gross is right at $148,000,000.00.  Stallone did what was originally thought to be impossible by many others--he gave new life to Rocky and made another hit movie!In Rocky Balboa, our lead character is now living in South Philadelphia and is struggling to recover from the lost of his wife, Adrian, who died of cancer.  His only friend appears to be Paulie (played by Burt Young), who's still working at the meatpacking plant.  Rocky and his son, Robert (played by Milo Ventimiglia), have grown apart and see very little of each other.  Though Rocky owns and operates a small Italian restaurant called Adrian's, his heart isn't into it.  He has little to look forward to and sees his life as nearly over.  The only pleasure he gets is from visiting Adrian's grave.  Everything begins to slowly change for Rocky when two important events take place.  The first is when Rocky runs into Marie (played by Geraldine Hughes), a person from his past who gives him a reason to keep going forward with his life.  The second thing that happens is when a sport's show does a virtual reality computer fight between him and the new world champion, Mason Dixon (played by Antonio Tarver), displaying that Rocky, though older, would win the bout without any problem.  This creates in Rocky the desire to want to fight again, but only on a local level.  Dixon's people view the computer fight and immediately see a way to make a great deal of money.  After Rocky renews his fighting license, he's asked to do a celebrity fight against Mason Dixon in Las Vegas with part of the proceeds going to charity.  Though hesitant at first to get back into the ring with a heavyweight champion, Rocky finally agrees to do so with Marie's encouragement.  Robert, however, is totally against his father fighting again.  He's lived in his father's shadow for years and this will only make matters worse.  Rocky explains to his son that this is something he has to do in order to feel alive again.  He also tells Robert that he has to stop blaming others for his problems and to learn to deal with life by not giving up when things gets tough.  Of course, all of this leads to the preparation for the big fight and then to the fight itself.  I still get goose bumps when Rocky runs up the steps to the Philadelphia Art Museum with ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background.What Sylvester Stallone was able to do with Rocky Balboa is to return to the roots of the original movie in the series and tap into its heart and soul.  You see it in the streets of Philadelphia, the poignant music of Bill Conti, Rocky's old home and Mickey's gym from the first movie, the shadows and dark overtones of the film, the return of Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke, and the haunting presence of Adrian (played by the lovely Talia Shire) throughout the film.  Stallone put his own heart and soul into the making of this movie, fighting an up-hill battle against the studios who thought his career was over and never giving up, knowing that this film was a reflection of his own life and struggles.  Rocky Balboa is definitely the way the series needs to be ended.  It's a direct mirror of what can be good in a person's life if he's willing to put forth the effort.  I don't know about other people, but when I saw this movie in the theater last December and then again of DVD last night, it brought tears to my eyes, but in a good way.  This is the last Rocky movie.  Stallone knew that he was finally saying goodbye to his most famous character and to an intricate part of his own life.  As the final credits roll in the movie, dozens of everyday people are shown running up the famous steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum.  Each year thousands of people run up these steps and throw their arms victoriously up into the air just like Rocky.  That's how powerful the impact of this series has been on the mass public.  I used to live outside of Philadelphia during my early teens.  If I still lived there, you'd see me running up the steps, too.  Well, maybe halfway up the steps.  I'm not in as good of shape as I used to be.  But, all is not lost for us ""Rocky"" fans.  There will be a Director's Cut coming out before the end of the year.  My guess is that it will be a Two Disc Special Director's Cut Edition, which will include the twenty minutes of deleted scenes that were originally cut from the film.  That's something to look forward to.  With regards to the DVD extras on Rocky Balboa, there's a fifteen-minute featurette on the making of the movie, another fifteen-minute featurette on doing the big fight scene at the finale, twenty minutes of deleted scenes with an alternate ending, bloopers, and a great film commentary by Stallone.  This is definitely a movie that the fans of the ""Rocky"" series will love, and as the last words in the film say, ""Yo, Adrian, we did it!""",5,It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward!,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,6789,"['When', 'first', 'moved', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1986', 'lucked', 'out', 'got', 'two-week', 'job', 'extra', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'Top', 'filming',

Rocky seems to have taken a liking to the son but yet the relationship was not explored.  The fight scenes were great the dialouge was lacking.

But Stallone put together a decent movie here. I admit, it moved slowly at first, and I did get kinda sick of all the reminicing and wanted more boxing, but hey, it did deliver in the end, and it true rocky style.  Talia Shire, Adrian, was not in this movie, but much of the movie revolved around her spirit.  I wonder if after rocky V she said she'd rather be dead than be in another rocky movie.  Well, now she probably wants her publisist dead for not getting her into it.  Oh well, the movie is decent, good action, and good message.

1052808,A1DOEL69Z9KQTV,B000N3AXQU,"Wynand Meyering ""reader""","[3, 6]","Stallone is in great shape! He looks awesome for his age. He surely had one last Rocky Balboa fight in him. But I feel certain elements that made the Rocky series great are missing. Firstly Mickey, the legendary motivational trainer. Perhaps Stallone is afraid of Mickey's shadow, who knows... but I missed flashback clips of Mickey ( and saw too much of Rocky's wife ). Secondly, the legendary training sequences. Stallone owns a restaurant, and after retirement, it seems he remains in heavy weight champion shape! I loved the parts in the other Rocky movies, where you could see him rebuilding his body, getting it into shape. And thirdly, the fight sequences. I am a boxing fan and would have liked to see him having flashbacks of himself struggling, fighting, reliving those great achievements, fights and opponents in his mind, like any retired fighter would do. Strategizing and planning his up and coming fight. NOTHING of Apollo Creed ( C Weathers ), Clubber Lang ( Mr. T ), Captain Ivan Drago ( D Ludgren )... But the movie caries a powerful message: you have to find and be yourself, no matter what others say about you. Even if you are past the ""sell by"" date. All in all, Stallone remains my favorite action hero of all time. I remember as a child, being so excited about his movies, especially the Rambo series, that I couldn't sleep at night.

1052810,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B000N3AXQU,Zoe Paris,"[3, 8]","This movie was not all I thought it would be. Honestly I am torn on my opinion. There were things about it I liked and things about it I disliked. Here is the lowdown on what I thought and why...What I liked: Stallone is in AWESOME shape and is an inspiration to people young and old. A healthy lifestyle pays off and here is your proof. He still has a great body. He still looks great shirtless even at 60 years old and I respect that a lot. It's not easy to stay in that kind of shape at any age. The acting, Stallone has matured as an actor and is a lot more natural and believable than in other movies. The cinematography was nice and really captured the essence of the first Rocky movie. The HBO PPV fight LOOKED like a real boxing match! The camera angles during the fight looked very authentic. Paulie was great, I loved his line about ""People who skate on ice are stupid"" (I am not a fan of the cold either) and I think he was a valuable and funny character in this movie. Paulie added some laughs in the somber beginning. The Champ, they picked a real boxer for the part of the rival and I think the authenticity really came through, he's not a bad actor and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. It's nice to see someone who is not just an athlete but has other talents too! He did a very good job of acting like the young, self-absorbed, arrogant champion. To see him interviewed in real life, he seems like a respectful, humble guy. I think this role was a good challange for him. He actually seemed to enjoy playing an ego-inflated star who everyone hates and I think it takes a lot of character for an otherwise nice guy to play such a role.What I disliked: The slow, sappy version of the famous ""Rocky"" music. I thought the music was a downer and really did not like hearing the formerly upbeat and inspirational theme song slowed down to the pace of a funeral dirge through most of the film! Yeah we get it, we are supposed to feel sad, depressed and it's meant to be nostalgic. It was overkill! The first half hour of the film is dedicated to showing how down in the dumps Rocky is, his wife is dead and he goes to all his old hangouts and there are too many flashbacks. The beginning dragged a lot and I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. The son, a good actor who looked a lot like Stallone but the whole 'living in dad's big shadow' concept was cliche. I didn't like his character at all. I found it hard to believe that a 25-30 year old man would still have such an immature resentment of his dad. I was thinking ""Dude, get over it, grow up and give your old man a break!"" This attitude would have been more suited to the behavior of a teenager and not a grown man, though I did like Rocky's speech to his son about blaming people and making excuses. Way to go dad, I would have felt the same way if I had such a grumpy, ungrateful kid! I also thought it was unrealistic how the son suddenly was so supportive after being so distant for so long. It was painful to watch such a loving kind hearted dad being brushed off by his whiny, wimpy and disrespectful son! The girl Marie, they could have heated this part up just a little, it was too 'innocent' a relationship. Rocky's wife is dead, he's had a tough time, the guy deserves to hook up with a new lady and prove that he is indeed still the Italian Stallion! I would not have gone so far as a love scene but I found the one kissing scene was too 'vanilla' for my taste. I wasn't feeling any passion there. So, Rocky is not young anymore but he's not dead, geeze! The ending, ok so it was realistic but it was dissapointing, I much preffered the alternate ending on the DVD! I also could have done without the shot of Adrienne's grave, like we already SAW that 3 times during the film, why show it again and end a good movie on a sad note? We know she is gone, I want to see him move on with his life and stop wallowing in the past like he did for half the movie.Overall, I liked the movie but I didn't love it. Halfway through the film I was thinking ""PLEASE lets get past the sappy parts and show him training, climbing stairs, drinking raw eggs and punching sides of beef!"" I really liked how the other Rocky movies pumped me up and made me want to go work out. This movie did not have the degree of adrenaline that I would have wanted in an action-based Stallone movie.This movie showed a more human Rocky but it was so overdone it came off too sappy and slowed the pace of the film. There was a lot of emotion in the beginning but the end lacked emotion and fell flat. There was a big build up and it lacked a big ending to carry it. I wanted to see the tear-jerking ending where he triumphs over all odds after being beaten to a bloody pulp. The satisfaction simply wasn't there. It was a good ending to a great series but unfortunately I think this movie could have been better.The alternate ending on the DVD was stellar and would have been a much better choice than the original. If they had gone with the alternate ending I'd have given it 4 stars. If they had done that and cut down on the sap and sad music I'd have given it 5 stars. It was WAY better than Rocky 5 but that's not saying much because Rocky 5 was a one star movie as far as I was concerned. I am looking forward to the next Rambo movie and I hope it has a better ending than Rocky Balboa. I might watch this again one day but I think I will skip the ending and watch the alternate one instead!",3,Needs more testosterone and less sap!,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,5466,"['movie', 'was',
