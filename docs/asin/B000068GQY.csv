But no, this is a 2001 job and has no value at all.  It's not scary.  It's not funny.  It's not sexy (though it is explicitly sadistic enough to fall in the category of pornography; I'm surprised Amazon even sells it).  The acting and production values are atrocious.  It's a miserable mess.  I fast forwarded through most of it until finally I gave up on it.

Basically, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave"" consists of a short series of disgusting sadistic acts perpetrated on three men by a short haired, tattooed, and really, really nasty butch lesbian who concludes her reign of terror by  revoltingly masturbating in graphic stomach churning detail (I feel the bile rising into my throat just thinking about it) with full penetration with a broom stick before sodomising the sole surviving man with it.Not only did ""I Spit on Your Corpse.."" lack talented actors, but it was in need of better camera angles, a grittier, creepier atmosphere, and less time focusing on one of the lamest looking cemeteries I've ever seen as well as experimentation with their camera's special effects which took up what seemed like half of the movie.For those that are looking for a movie similar to ""I Spit on Your Grave"" which was a far superior movie, don't bother with this filth.",1,....No Comment.....,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,1139,"['Extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'someone', 'talent', 'rather', 'what', 'be', 'group', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Basically', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Corpse', 'Piss', 'Your', 'Grave', 'short', 'series', 'disgusting', 'sadistic', 'acts', 'perpetrated', 'three', 'men', 'short', 'haired', 'tattooed', 'really', 'really', 'nasty', 'butch', 'lesbian', 'who', 'reign', 'terror', 'revoltingly', 'masturbating', 'graphic', 'stomach', 'churning', 'detail', 'feel', 'bile', 'rising', 'throat', 'just', 'thinking', 'full', 'penetration', 'broom', 'stick', 'sodomising', 'sole', 'surviving', 'man', 'it.Not', 'only', 'did', 'Spit', 'Corpse..', 'lack', 'talented', 'actors', 'was', 'need', 'better', 'camera', 'angles', 'grittier', 'creepier', 'atmosphere', 'less', 'time', 'focusing', 'one', 'lamest', 'looking', 'cemeteries', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'experimentation', 'camera', 'special', 'effects', 'took', 'up', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'half', 'movie.For', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'similar', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'filth']","I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave"
704558,A2ZX6GW8WL5AG3,B000068GQY,jimmy_rants@yahoo,"[1, 1]","I grabbed this from Netflix inadvertently thinking it was a mid-70's slasher/exploiter, a genre and era I usually get a lot of amusement from.Disappointment was the word when I realized I was sent a similarly titled flick made in 2001.I was little turned away at first by the audio quality. The background music is good and very creepy, but at points it overpowers the dialogue which is often a whisper in comparison to the disturbing and moody music that accompanies it. Anyway with that said, it still kept me for a while. Eric Stanze is creative visually and can set a creepy scene with a disturbed matter-of-fact narration over shots of an abandoned amusement park. This part of the film works very well.Soon, a turn for the worst is taken as ISOYC details a backwoods sex crime that dramatizes the brutality a cut away to a loud train on an overpass, a technique lifted from early 80's film ""Bad Boys"" or maybe even something older. Further ISOYC degresses into a revenge tale which involves abduction, sexual torture and some moderately pretty girls who went a little too far with their tattoos. I've seen just about everything that can be out on film and surely don't shock that easily, but I do have to say I was a little surprised by the sexual content here as it does include full frontal nudity and object penetration. Not my thing, but I'm sure there's some kind of fetish crowd that would really dig the bondage and torture scenes that are here.Again, it's not awful filmaking, but not a great script and mediocre actors that  hurt ISOYC. Eric Stanze probably had a microbudget and I respect that he made anything that could hold my attention for more than a few minutes. Maybe his later videos will show improvement.",2,Spit on this DVD Instead,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1730,"['grabbed', 'Netflix', 'inadvertently', 'thinking', 'was', 'mid-70', 'slasher/exploiter', 'genre', 'era', 'usually', 'get', 'lot', 'amusement', 'from.Disappointment', 'was', 'word', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'sent', 'similarly', 'titled', 'flick', 'made', '2001.I', 'was', 'little', 'turned', 'away', 'first', 'audio', 'quality', 'background', 'music', 'good', 'very', 'creepy', 'points', 'dialogue', 'often', 'whisper', 'comparison', 'disturbing', 'moody', 'music', 'Anyway', 'said', 'still', 'kept', 'while', 'Eric', 'Stanze', 'creative', 'visually', 'can', 'set', 'creepy', 'scene', 'disturbed', 'matter-of-fact', 'narration', 'shots', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'part', 'film', 'very', 'well.Soon', 'turn', 'worst', 'taken', 'ISOYC', 'details', 'backwoods', 'sex', 'crime', 'brutality', 'cut', 'away', 'loud', 'train', 'overpass', 'technique', 'lifted', 'early', '80', 'film', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'maybe', 'even', 'something', 'older', 'Further', 'ISOYC', 'degresses', 'revenge', 'tale', 'abduction', 'sexual', 'torture', 'moderately', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'tattoos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'out', 'film', 'surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'shock', 'easily', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'sexual', 'content', 'here', 'include', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'object', 'penetration', 'Not', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kind', 'fetish', 'crowd', 'would', 'really', 'dig', 'bondage', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'here.Again', 'not', 'awful', 'filmaking', 'not', 'great', 'script', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'hurt', 'ISOYC', 'Eric', 'Stanze', 'probably', 'had', 'microbudget', 'respect', 'made', 'anything', 'could', 'hold', 'attention', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'Maybe', 'later', 'videos', 'will', 'show', 'improvement']","I Spit on Your Corpse, I Piss on Your Grave"

Very explicit and downright cruel in places, this is a well made sucker punch to the gloss of Hollywood and shows what can be achieved when films are made to be challenging, rather than just mindless feel-good fodder.Highly recommended, but for fans of extreme cinema only.

A great deal of the film simply consists of shots of a graveyard, shots of Jesus statues, more shots of tombstones, some meaningless dialog, and then some more dumb footage of something or other.

It's not a 74' release, it's a 2001 release by a group of about 10 inexperienced, amateurish, 20-something ""filmakers."" The ""plot"" is on a girl who meets her escaped from jail b/f in the woods and he takes her to some guys house where he has captured 3 different guys who have in some way done this girl wrong.The b/f says he will kill her too, but she ends up defending herself and killing him instead. The tables turn and instead of releasing these guys she decides to torture and kill them one by one in some inhumane ways (pretty sick stuff, but so badly done it's stupid). After her revenge, the movie's over.This ""film"" runs 73 minutes long, and about the first 20 are pointless overly run shots of the b/f's brother attacking a girl (which really has nothing at all to do with the story) and some pointless still shots of religious statues in a cemetary (which also have no meaning whatsoever to the movie)....It took them 8 days to shoot this thing...8! How good of a movie can you have in 8 days? It just looks like people who were bored and needed something to do. And the sex scenes?! Ridiculous! There is 1 real lovemaking scene which is the stupidest thing ive ever seen on film. One sodomizing scene with a broom handle, which i guess could be ""graphic,"" and a scene of the girl masterbating with the broomstick (which is the only good part of the movie). The extras are funny though, not in a good way. ""the making of"" stuff runs waaayyyy too long for such short and cheap of a movie, and the fact that these people are proud of their efforts is even more pathetic. I can't say enough bad things about this dvd! It's boring, it's stupid, it's extremely low budget. This is the kind of movie that shouldn't be sold but be distributed free for promotional uses (ok, maybe they should sell it, but for no more then 10 bucks!)
