The concert, filmed in the early 1990's took place in a relatively small venue, and had a casual intimate atmosphere. Frankie Valli sounded great. Though he was a little reserved at times, his performance, for the most part, was very strong and reminiscent of the early rock 'n' roll/doo wop sound. His interpretations of ballads like ""Silence is Golden"", and ""My Eyes Adored You"" come across as more tender and sensitive than the studio versions. In addition to hits like ""Grease"", ""Dawn"", and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" there are also some little known treasures included like, ""Silver Star"", and ""Fallen Angel"". Although the Four Seasons are replacements for the originals, they do an exceptionally good job, especially the very talented and charismatic singer and keyboardist, Tim Stone.

It was a casino club stage venue in Atlantic City. Their catalog of music is extensive for those of us who loved them well, and many who do not know of them well do not know this. They were to the East Coast what the Beach Boys were to the West Coast at the same time and fought hard to stay on the air amidst the newly hyped Beatlemania craze at the same time and British Invasion which I think negatively impacted the whole US music scene. So many excellent groups and US-made songwriting was going on yet it seemed the media was bent on supporting this ""British Invasion"" then and to this damn day, and so much quality American made music was going on at the same time being overshadowed until now, when people are able to buy these cd's and start to remember the US they grew up in then and how good we really had it back then...

But this is more a tribute to Mr. Valli's professionalism, not his enthusiasm. He's still a great performer (very little falsetto anymore, which is fine), and he knows how to work the crowd. But overall, he seems to be going through the motions. He's singing songs and using patter as if he's done this thousands of times before -- which he has.
