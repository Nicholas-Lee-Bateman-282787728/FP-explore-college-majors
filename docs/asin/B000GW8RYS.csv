1007723,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000GW8RYS,Newton Ooi,"[21, 24]","Like many other fans of Russell Peters, I got to know his comedy from his 40 minute video download of the Internet.  Watching it over and over again, I was amazed by his accents, facial expressions, situational comedy and improvised skits.  So I bought this DVD hoping for more.  And more you get, as in more of the same.  The DVD's main feature is an 1 hour 20 minute video of him onstage somewhere in San Francisco.  He is performing to a multi-racial crowd, and as usual, his entire show is devoted to multi-racial comedy.  Many of his jokes are of the same nature as his infamous download, and about 20 - 25 minutes of the show is actually him performing the same comedy as that found in his download.  Another good 10 - 15 minutes of the show is comprised of him pausing and the audience laughing.  So of the 1 hr and 20 minutes, only about half of it is original comedy.  And none of it was as good as that found in his download.  So for me, it was not that funny.  For someone who has never seen his internet download however, this DVD is great.  The innovativeness and wit of his comedy is as good as anyone else out there in the US now.  And when it comes to racial jokes, his is the best out there.",3,Not as good as I expected,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1208,"['many', 'other', 'fans', 'Russell', 'Peters', 'got', 'know', 'comedy', '40', 'minute', 'video', 'download', 'Internet', 'Watching', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'amazed', 'accents', 'facial', 'expressions', 'situational', 'comedy', 'improvised', 'skits', 'So', 'bought', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'more', 'more', 'get', 'more', 'same', 'DVD', 'main', 'feature', '1', 'hour', '20', 'minute', 'video', 'onstage', 'somewhere', 'San', 'Francisco', 'performing', 'multi-racial', 'crowd', 'usual', 'entire', 'show', 'devoted', 'multi-racial', 'comedy', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'same', 'nature', 'infamous', 'download', '20', '25', 'minutes', 'show', 'actually', 'performing', 'same', 'comedy', 'found', 'download', 'good', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'show', 'comprised', 'pausing', 'audience', 'laughing', '1', 'hr', '20', 'minutes', 'only', 'half', 'original', 'comedy', 'none', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'found', 'download', 'So', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'internet', 'download', 'however', 'DVD', 'great', 'innovativeness', 'wit', 'comedy', 'as', 'good', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'US', 'now', 'when', 'racial', 'jokes', 'best', 'there']",Russell Peters - Outsourced
