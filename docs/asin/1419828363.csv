175477,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,1419828363,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","KNUTE ROCKNE ALL AMERICAN is based in part on the private papers of the coach's widow.In an early portion of this idealized biopic, Pat O'Brien is clearly too old to portray the Notre Dame footballer who is shown pioneering the forward pass in a mid-Teens game against a superior Army squad. This tactic had in fact been around for decades. Although an 1876 toss from Yale's Walter Camp was ruled a touchdown, for 30 years, passes other than laterals were consistently disallowed. As a later member of the rules committee, Camp lobbied to legitimize the forward pass. It was finally added to the rule book several years before Knute attended college.Knute's locker room ""win just one for the Gipper"" speech didn't occur soon after the star player's 1920 death, but almost a decade later. Gipp didn't succumb to disease (as depicted here) he was taken by complications from strep throat, a viral infection easily treatable if antibiotics had only been available. Finally, the coach's fatal plane crash occurred while he was enroute to act as technical supervisor for a UNIVERSAL Studios movie called THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (1931), not because he wished to defend his beloved sport at a hearing.Amid these truth-stretchings, WARNER's manages to work in a glitzy chorus line number! (All songs are public domain, due to an ongoing ASCAP strike.)The movie's strong points include actual game footage, Rockne's invention of the backfield shift, cameos in one sequence by four legendary coaches and above all, the true-to-life depiction of Knute's finest qualities: his positive influence on young athletes through an emphasis on fair play, a demonstration of unflagging will to win, and encourgement of the brotherly bond unique to sports teams.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.7) Knute Rockne All American (1940) - Pat O'Brien/Gale Page/Ronald Reagan/Donald Crisp/John Litel/'Pop' Warner/Amos Alonzo Stagg/Bill Spaulding/Howard Jones (uncredited: Brian Keith/William Hopper/Dckie Jones/George Reeves/Charles Trowbridge/Maris Wrixon)",4,"""Tell 'em to go out there with all they got and win just one for the Gipper.""",1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2074,"['KNUTE', 'ROCKNE', 'ALL', 'AMERICAN', 'based', 'part', 'private', 'papers', 'coach', 'widow.In', 'early', 'portion', 'idealized', 'biopic', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'clearly', 'too', 'old', 'portray', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'footballer', 'who', 'shown', 'pioneering', 'forward', 'pass', 'mid-Teens', 'game', 'superior', 'Army', 'squad', 'tactic', 'had', 'fact', 'been', 'decades', '1876', 'toss', 'Yale', 'Walter', 'Camp', 'was', 'ruled', 'touchdown', '30', 'years', 'other', 'laterals', 'were', 'consistently', 'disallowed', 'later', 'member', 'rules', 'committee', 'Camp', 'lobbied', 'legitimize', 'forward', 'pass', 'was', 'finally', 'added', 'rule', 'book', 'several', 'years', 'Knute', 'attended', 'college.Knute', 'locker', 'room', 'win', 'just', 'one', 'Gipper', 'speech', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'soon', 'star', 'player', '1920', 'death', 'almost', 'decade', 'later', 'Gipp', 'did', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'disease', 'depicted', 'here', 'was', 'taken', 'complications', 'strep', 'throat', 'viral', 'infection', 'easily', 'treatable', 'antibiotics', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'available', 'Finally', 'coach', 'fatal', 'plane', 'crash', 'occurred', 'was', 'enroute', 'act', 'technical', 'supervisor', 'UNIVERSAL', 'Studios', 'movie', 'called', 'THE', 'SPIRIT', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', '1931', 'not', 'wished', 'defend', 'beloved', 'sport', 'hearing.Amid', 'truth-stretchings', 'WARNER', 'manages', 'work', 'glitzy', 'chorus', 'line', 'number', 'songs', 'are', 'public', 'domain', 'due', 'ongoing', 'ASCAP', 'strike', 'movie', 'strong', 'points', 'include', 'actual', 'game', 'footage', 'Rockne', 'invention', 'backfield', 'shift', 'cameos', 'one', 'sequence', 'four', 'legendary', 'coaches', 'true-to-life', 'depiction', 'Knute', 'finest', 'qualities', 'positive', 'influence', 'young', 'athletes', 'emphasis', 'fair', 'play', 'demonstration', 'unflagging', 'will', 'win', 'encourgement', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'unique', 'sports', 'teams.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.7', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'All', 'American', '1940', 'Pat', ""O'Brien/Gale"", 'Page/Ronald', 'Reagan/Donald', 'Crisp/John', ""Litel/'Pop"", 'Warner/Amos', 'Alonzo', 'Stagg/Bill', 'Spaulding/Howard', 'Jones', 'uncredited', 'Brian', 'Keith/William', 'Hopper/Dckie', 'Jones/George', 'Reeves/Charles', 'Trowbridge/Maris', 'Wrixon']",N/A

It almost makes me a Fighting Irish devotee. If you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.As a sports fan, I loved watching the classic footage of early college games. They had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. They interspersed that footage with Pat O'Brien shown as head coach Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan).Reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. O'Brien is the only actor with a large role in here. The rest - all playing nice characters - include Gale Page as Rockne's wife ""Bonnie;"" Donald Crisp, as the Notre Dame's ""Father John Callahan;"" Albert Bassermann as chemistry professor ""Father Nieuwland"" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps Notre Dame's most talented and famous player ever.What this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football. Neither angle is overdone. The characters in here all people you can root for, as there are no villains. On my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - playing Rockne at the age of seven and to see George Reeves, TV's Superman, as one of the players.There have been very few football movies made in Hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. Most are modern-day ones filled with profanity.

175482,A313OU4NOWZDBY,1419828363,David R. Allen,"[0, 0]","Knute Rockne movie more than a showcase for Ronald Reagan and a fun football movie.Knute Rockne, All American (1940 Warner Brothers) starring Pat O'Brien, Ronald Reagan, Donald Crisp, and John Qualan is technically and artistically a splendid movie, far better than its reputation in many circles as mainly a nostalgia movie about one of college football's grand old men (Knute Rockne, long time football coach for Notre Dame University in South Bend Indiana).It is a movie of which displays the very best talents of Warner Brothers movie studio at the height of it's golden age in the years immediately before USA entry into World War II.The camera work, the special effects provided by Hollywood cameraman and then future director Byron Haskin (he later directed Walt Disney's ""Treasure Island"" [1950] and also George Pal's ""War Of The Worlds"" [1952] movies in the early 1950's and in his old age was interviewed on camera in the 1970's by Kevin Brownlow for the ""Hollywood: The Silent Era"" documentary series which described Haskin's silent era cameraman days), the slick and wonderful newspaper headline montages which punctuate and advance the movie story (which covers the entire, rather long life of Knute Rockne from his childhood in Norway to his death following decades of service as Notre Dame's football coach of fame) are all breathtaking.This is no ""airhead"" movie.In addition to the great way it captures the physical part of college football, and the charismatic personality of Knute Rockne during his coaching years (and also during his undergrad years as a student football player), the movie takes on the question of what place football and ""big sports"" have had and should have in the college world, and in American culture generally, and provides viewers with thoughtful, worthwhile answers worth pondering and reviewing often.But briefly, Knute Rockne, All American (1940 Warner Brother) starring Pat O'Brien and Ronald Reagan is an intelligent movie about a subject many people doubt is intelligent at all....football and other big time contact sports.Ronald Reagan is given second billing in the beginning credits as the co-star of the movie, Pat O'Brien's main co-star. Yet Reagan's time on the screen (he plays George Gipp, a World War I era Notre Dame University football player of fame who sadly died in his senior year at Notre Dame) is relatively brief.Reagan's actor performance is underplayed, and quiet to the point of being undramatic. His more hysterical performance as ""Drake McHugh"" in King's Row (1942 Warner Brothers) two years later is rightly counted his best and most skilled movie actor performance by movie historians (he plays a character in King's Row who has his legs amputated and is spectacular in the scene where he discovers in a hospital recovery room what has happened to him).This movie is part of the USA Federal Government Library Of Congress National Film Registry List and placed among 475 movies (as of 2010) ranked as important and notable due to aesthetic, cultural, and/ or historical importance.Knute Rockne, All American (1940 Warner Bros) starring Pat O'Brien and Ronald Reagan is important in all three areas, a sweetheart of a movie worth screening often, truly a cinematic masterpiece not ranked usually among ""the great movies,"" but worthy and excellent in every way.-------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",3,"Knute Rockne, All American (1940)  movie was more than a showcase for Ronald Reagan and a fun football movie,",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3387,"['Knute', 'Rockne', 'movie', 'more', 'showcase', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'fun', 'football', 'movie.Knute', 'Rockne', 'American', '1940', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'starring', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'John', 'Qualan', 'technically', 'artistically', 'splendid', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'reputation', 'many', 'circles', 'mainly', 'nostalgia', 'movie', 'one', 'college', 'football', 'grand', 'old', 'men', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'long', 'time', 'football', 'coach', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'University', 'South', 'Bend', 'Indiana', '.It', 'movie', 'very', 'best', 'talents', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'studio', 'height', 'golden', 'age', 'years', 'immediately', 'USA', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'camera', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'provided', 'Hollywood', 'cameraman', 'then', 'future', 'director', 'Byron', 'Haskin', 'later', 'directed', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Treasure', 'Island', '[', '1950', ']', 'also', 'George', 'Pal', 'War', 'Worlds', '[', '1952', ']', 'movies', 'early', '1950', 'old', 'age', 'was', 'interviewed', 'camera', '1970', 'Kevin', 'Brownlow', 'Hollywood', 'Silent', 'Era', 'documentary', 'series', 'described', 'Haskin', 'silent', 'era', 'cameraman', 'days', 'slick', 'wonderful', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'montages', 'punctuate', 'advance', 'movie', 'story', 'entire', 'rather', 'long', 'life', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'childhood', 'Norway', 'death', 'following', 'decades', 'service', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'coach', 'fame', 'are', 'breathtaking.This', 'airhead', 'movie.In', 'addition', 'great', 'way', 'physical', 'part', 'college', 'football', 'charismatic', 'personality', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'coaching', 'years', 'also', 'undergrad', 'years', 'student', 'football', 'player', 'movie', 'question', 'what', 'place', 'football', 'big', 'sports', 'have', 'had', 'should', 'have', 'college', 'world', 'American', 'culture', 'generally', 'viewers', 'thoughtful', 'worthwhile', 'answers', 'worth', 'pondering', 'reviewing', 'often.But', 'briefly', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'American', '1940', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'starring', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'subject', 'many', 'people', 'doubt', 'intelligent', '.football', 'other', 'big', 'time', 'contact', 'sports.Ronald', 'Reagan', 'given', 'second', 'billing', 'beginning', 'credits', 'co-star', 'movie', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'main', 'co-star', 'Reagan', 'time', 'screen', 'George', 'Gipp', 'World', 'War', 'era', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'University', 'football', 'player', 'fame', 'who', 'sadly', 'died', 'senior', 'year', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'relatively', 'brief.Reagan', 'actor', 'performance', 'underplayed', 'quiet', 'point', 'being', 'undramatic', 'more', 'hysterical', 'performance', 'Drake', 'McHugh', 'King', 'Row', '1942', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'rightly', 'counted', 'best', 'most', 'skilled', 'movie', 'actor', 'performance', 'movie', 'historians', 'character', 'King', 'Row', 'who', 'legs', 'amputated', 'spectacular', 'scene', 'where', 'hospital', 'recovery', 'room', 'what', 'happened', '.This', 'movie', 'part', 'USA', 'Federal', 'Government', 'Library', 'Congress', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'List', 'placed', '475', 'movies', '2010', 'ranked', 'important', 'notable', 'due', 'aesthetic', 'cultural', 'and/', 'historical', 'importance.Knute', 'Rockne', 'American', '1940', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'starring', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'important', 'three', 'areas', 'sweetheart', 'movie', 'screening', 'often', 'truly', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'ranked', 'usually', 'great', 'movies', 'worthy', 'excellent', 'way.', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor']",N/A

Bernabo,"[23, 23]","Ronald Reagan might have gotten the nickname of the ""Gipper"" from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, but it was veteran character actor Pat O'Brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead. James Cagney had lobbied hard for the role, but when the actor signed a petition supporting the Republican (and anti-Catholic) government in the Spanish Civil War, Notre Dame refused to okay him for the part. This was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in South Bend, and if you do know that the other one was ""Rudy"" you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one.""Knute Rockne All American"", which was added to the National Film Registry in 1997, is a fairly standard bio-pic, evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time. We see how the young Rockne (played by Johnny Sheffield, a.k.a. Boy in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies) learned to love football, revolutionized the game with the forward pass, and coached his alma mater to glory with the Four Horsemen and George Gipp. The result is a long series of episodes from Rockne's life that have varying degrees of appeal, such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests.Lots of footage of actual Notre Dame games are worked into the film, although I have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed (I would be curious to know). O'Brien's performance seems a tad wooden, but if you have ever seen actual film clips of Rockne you know he is in the ballpark. A lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original Rockne, an American legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash. The result is not great, but certainly compelling (plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being Ka-Nute).Reagan's supporting role is deservedly memorable. That same year he would get to play third banana George Armstrong Custer to Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland in ""The Santa Fe Trail"" and would provide his best performance in ""King's Row"" before military service in World War II effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path.Final Note: While there is little doubt that Rockne invented the forward pass, there is debate over one aspect of this film. In his first scene as George Gipp, Reagan is sitting around doing nothing when Rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball. Gipp asks ""How far?"" and proceeds to run it back all the way. After crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone, instead of laying it down for the ""touchdown."" An argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football. At least it is the first ""recorded"" spike. Did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what Ronald Reagan did in this 1940 film? You decide if that is yet another part of the Reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week.",5,Pat O'Brien asks Notre Dame to win one for Ronald Reagan,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,3094,"['Ronald', 'Reagan', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'nickname', 'Gipper', '1940', 'bio-pic', 'legendary', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'football', 'coach', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'was', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'had', 'role', 'lifetime', 'lead', 'James', 'Cagney', 'had', 'lobbied', 'hard', 'role', 'when', 'actor', 'signed', 'petition', 'supporting', 'Republican', 'anti-Catholic', 'government', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'refused', 'okay', 'part', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'campus', 'South', 'Bend', 'do', 'know', 'other', 'one', 'was', 'Rudy', 'should', 'least', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'guess', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'Knute', 'Rockne', 'All', 'American', 'was', 'added', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', '1997', 'fairly', 'standard', 'bio-pic', 'evincing', 'almost', 'documentary', 'style', 'was', 'standard', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'young', 'Rockne', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Sheffield', 'a.k.a', 'Boy', 'Johnny', 'Weissmuller', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'learned', 'love', 'football', 'revolutionized', 'game', 'forward', 'pass', 'coached', 'alma', 'mater', 'glory', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'George', 'Gipp', 'result', 'long', 'series', 'episodes', 'Rockne', 'life', 'have', 'varying', 'degrees', 'appeal', 'such', 'when', 'up', 'idea', 'backfield', 'shift', 'watching', 'chorus', 'girls', 'dance', 'experiments', 'idea', 'using', 'wife', 'dinner', 'guests.Lots', 'footage', 'actual', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'games', 'are', 'worked', 'film', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'actual', 'games', 'being', 'portrayed', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'know', ""O'Brien"", 'performance', 'tad', 'wooden', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actual', 'film', 'clips', 'Rockne', 'know', 'ballpark', 'lot', 'charm', 'film', 'ethos', 'original', 'Rockne', 'American', 'legend', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'famous', 'victim', 'airplane', 'crash', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'learn', 'correct', 'pronunciation', 'name', 'being', 'Ka-Nute', '.Reagan', 'supporting', 'role', 'deservedly', 'memorable', 'same', 'year', 'would', 'get', 'play', 'third', 'banana', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Olivia', 'DeHavilland', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Trail', 'would', 'provide', 'best', 'performance', 'King', 'Row', 'military', 'service', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'effectively', 'derailed', 'acting', 'momentum', 'ultimately', 'set', 'life', 'different', 'path.Final', 'Note', 'little', 'doubt', 'Rockne', 'invented', 'forward', 'pass', 'debate', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'first', 'scene', 'George', 'Gipp', 'Reagan', 'sitting', 'doing', 'nothing', 'when', 'Rockne', 'orders', 'go', 'halfback', 'play', 'varsity', 'run', 'ball', 'Gipp', 'How', 'far', 'proceeds', 'run', 'back', 'way', 'crossing', 'goal', 'line', 'ball', 'endzone', 'instead', 'laying', 'down', 'touchdown', 'argument', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'first', 'spike', 'history', 'football', 'least', 'first', 'recorded', 'spike', 'Did', 'current', 'tradition', 'choreographed', 'celebrations', 'stem', 'what', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'did', '1940', 'film', 'decide', 'yet', 'part', 'Reagan', 'legacy', 'being', 'reconsidered', 'week']",N/A

Rockne was tragically killed in a plane crash in Kansas on March 31st, 1931.  He as only 43 years of age.  Knute was known as one of the most innovative and charismatic coaches of his era. He was the first football coach to initiate intersectional rivalries and build a national schedule. Knute is well known for coaching the most dazzling, dramatic, idolized athlete of all time, George ""Gipper"" Gipp, played in the film by the late President Ronald Reagan. Gipp's running, passing, kicking and leadership lifted Notre Dame to fame. George Gipp became Notre Dame's first All-American and the famous subject of Rockne's motivating pre-game speech, ""Win one for the Gipper.""The role of Rockne would fall to Pat O' Brien, a veteran star who had been in such films as ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" ""The Fighting 69th"" and ""San Quentin""  it was not the first time O' Brien had played a football coach either.  In 1933 he starred in a film called ""College Coach"".  O' Brien did a good job in mimmicking the voice and mannerisms of the legendary coach.  Of course the most famous scene in the film is O' Brien giving his famous ""Win one for the Gipper"" speech after Gipp passed away tragically.  It is the most well known sports pep talk in history and was used by Reagan himself during the 1988 Presidential campaign.The movie did a good job of displaying football action although it is a very different game than we see today.  Rockne actually pioneered many of the offensive schemes seen today with men in motion and backfield alignments.Donald Crisp turns in a fine performance as Father Callahan and there's even the legendary four horseman in the film as well.

The film is done in the heartwarming Americana style of Frank Capra: Themes like the self made man, American prosperity, religious belief, and patriotism are strong. The great Irish American actor Pat O'Brien, too old to be believable in his early scenes as a 20-something college student, nevertheless makes a great Rockne. Rockne, a Scandinavian immigrant, moves with his family to Chicago, grows up playing football, and attends the fledgling Catholic University of Notre Dame after working for a few years as a laborer. There he shows skill in chemistry and football, but pursues the latter, helping revolutionize the game of football with increased use of the forward pass in a game against Army. He later rises to become Notre Dame's football coach before dying in an airplane accident on the way to film a documentary about his team on the West Coast. Some neat things about the film are its use of real Notre Dame game footage, the Notre Dame band, and campus location footage that give a real sense of the school's legendary pride and fervent Catholicism.
