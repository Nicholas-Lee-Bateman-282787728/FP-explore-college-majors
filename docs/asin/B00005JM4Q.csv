I don't understand why people don't like this one. It is hilarious, full of surprises and very, very CRAZY.Only this movie will be enough for you to make you pee on your couch. Nicholson's performance is just...DYNAMITE..... this one proofs that Jack Nicholson can really make comedy films. I love this one as much as ""Billy Madison"" or ""Happy Gilmore"".Terrific! But not only Nicholson's performance is fantastic, Sandler was also too much on this one.

""What was this film compared to what I enjoy?""  ""What was this film compared to what I think the producers / director intended?""  Always keep that in mind when reading reviews.  As I began watching this movie, I wasn't enjoying it, because a) it wasn't what I expected and b) it didn't seem like the sort of thing I usually enjoy.  But when I began to understand what this movie was really all about, I loved it.Anger Management is nothing less than a very enjoyable, funny insight into the nature of all anger.  Psychologists and spiritual types alike will tell you that all anger we feel toward others is ultimately anger we feel toward ourselves.  That can often be hard to swallow when we're feeling hacked off at someone for something they did to us.  But what this film shows us, gradually, and in a very sneaky way, is that most of us are a lot angrier inside than we care to admit, and that, in truth, the person we're most angry with is ourselves. And only when we deal with that can our lives get better and happier.Sandler plays a typical hard working Joe (Dave Buznik) who's having a very hard time getting ahead in the world.  No matter how hard he tries to please his boss, nothing is ever enough, and he's consistently passed over for opportunities to advance.  And he's beginning to have doubts about his girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei, as her best friend just happens to be a guy with the largest equipment Dave has ever seen.  Despite set back after set back, kind hearted Dave persists, swallowing his pride, putting up with his boss and his love frustrations, hoping some day things will turn around for him.Then, one day, quite calmly, he asks for a set of movie headsets on a long flight and ends up being arrested for assault and battery.  He's done nothing more than touch the flight attendant on the arm and calmly repeat his request for a headset, and still, he ends up in court.  Assuming that things will be quickly cleared up as he has actually done nothing wrong, Dave is shocked when the situation blows up in his face.  In a heartbeat, Dave's simple, if depressing life, has been turned completely upside down, and he's facing a choice between a prison term or living each day with one of the most annoying therapists ever to walk the face of the earth.After just a few days of living with Jack Nicholson's character, Dr. Buddy Rydell, Dave is beginning to wonder if prison might not have been the better choice.  Try as he might to comply with the extreme and completely unconventional demands of his therapy (such as stopping a car in the middle of a bridge in rush hour traffic to sing ""I Feel Pretty""), it seems more to Dave that his therapy is specifically designed to make him crazy and ruin his life than to help with some imaginary anger problem he never had in the first place.The movie climbs through a series of increasingly proposterous situations as Dr. Rydell seems bent on stealing Dave's girl and leaving him jobless and penniless.  On the verge of losing everything, Dave finally snaps and really does become angry ... and with good reason.  Rydell HAS been trying to ruin his life and steal his girl ... to help Dave admit to being angry, perhaps for the first time in his life.  Dave is the kind of guy who has sucked up other people's abuse all his life, never allowing himself to get angry, even when he had reason to.  Dave HAS an anger management problem ... he doesn't allow himself to get angry or to admit what he's angry about.  We think of anger management as a class for people who can't control their anger, and who unleash it too often in inappropriate situations.  This movie ... surprise ... is about someone whose problem is quite the opposite.  Only when Dave finally gets angry at how completely out of control his life is getting, does he discover his REAL problem ... he's been letting people walk on him all his life.  And the person he most needed to get angry with was himself ... for letting his life become such a mess while trying to live up to the expectations of everyone around him while forgetting about himself.In the end, it turns out that everything that's happened since Dave sat down on the airplane has been a set up.  His loving girl, Linda (Marisa Tomei), set the whole thing up with Dr. Rydell to help push Dave ""gently"" over the edge and help him finally get angry enough at himself to stop letting other people push him around.As someone who suffered from this same problem for most of my life, when the point of this movie got to me, I was utterly blown away.  I never saw it coming.  When I was younger, I used to let people walk all over me, making my own life a living hell by allowing others to make of my life what they wanted, then blaming them for what my life had become.  NO one can make anything out of your life other than what you want, unless you let them. And if we choose to let other people push us around, we are allowing them to have our way with us ... and that choice ... our choice ... is what makes our life a mess.  Only when we recirect our hidden anger away from other people and get fed up ourselves with our own willingness to be walked on can we finally start enjoying the kind of life we always wanted all along.If you don't get the deeper meaning of this movie, it can seem to be a very silly, stupid flick, with one apparently crazy scene after another stacking up to a huge pile of silliness.  But it all has a point ... just how completely stupid will some of us let our lives become before we finally scream ENOUGH!!! and stand up for ourselves and begin making out lives what we want them to be.Like many of the movies with which Sandler has been involved for the past several years, Anger Management is a sleeper.  I was never a fan of Sandler in his younger days, but I have a ton of respect for him now.  His recent work consistently serves up deep insights into the nature of the human heart, cloaked in what appears to be mindless silliness that is anything but.  Sandler's genius is helping us learn about ourselves while keeping us laughing.  It's brilliant, and I thank him for it.",5,Enjoyable Insight Into Anger,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,6226,"['CONTAINS', 'SPOILERSMovies', 'can', 'be', 'reviewed', 'many', 'ways', 'What', 'was',

612762,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JM4Q,Alistair McHarg,"[6, 9]","It's axiomatic in theatre and film that when a secondary character starts to emerge and overshadow the leads, the project is in trouble.  In Anger Management we see this problem elevated to unprecedented extremes.  It's true that secondary characters like Chuck, John Turturro, and Lou, Luis Guzman deliver some of the best acting and most cheerful moments in the picture, eclipsing the rampant stupidity of Sandler and Nicholson.  But this film actually carries the phenomenon one step beyond.From start to finish, non-actors known for their names, and tempers, walk through this film with all the conviction of octogenarians being wheeled through a nursing home.  They are not even given anything to do, they are used symbolically.  The apotheosis of this is John McEnroe.  McEnroe drew attention to himself a while back through behavior so abominable it dragged the sport of tennis down to hitherto unplumbed depths.  A despicable brat, he was only allowed to stick around because he filled seats.  In Anger Management he doesn't even have a line, he's a knowing wink at the audience.The same can be said of Bobby Knight and Roger Clemens.  Rudolph Giuliani makes an appearance.  Woody Harrelson is funny as Galaxia not because he's funny as Galaxia, but because the casting itself is amusing.  The highlight of the film occurs when Nicholson appears to be giving himself a Frankenstein treatment with a device emitting jolts of blue electricity intended to stimulate his scalp.  Nicholson is comfortable as a demented, irascible coot - what a stretch for him!  Sandler is, as always, a lost man/child with a head and face less interesting than a boiled egg.  Marisa Tomei, a good actress, appears to be somewhat anesthetized as she smiles through the insipid love story allegedly driving this catastrophe.That Sandler continues to find employment renews my faith in America, a land that welcomes the tired, the stupid, the talentless, those who unapologetically aim low, with open arms.  If your movie can be stolen out from under you by a washed up tennis bad boy without lines, you're not just bad, you're awful.",1,Movie Mismanagement,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2118,"['axiomatic', 'theatre', 'film', 'when', 'secondary', 'character', 'emerge', 'overshadow', 'leads', 'project', 'trouble', 'Anger', 'Management', 'see', 'problem', 'elevated', 'unprecedented', 'extremes', 'true', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Chuck', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Lou', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'deliver', 'best', 'acting', 'most', 'cheerful', 'moments', 'picture', 'eclipsing', 'rampant', 'stupidity', 'Sandler', 'Nicholson', 'film', 'actually', 'phenomenon', 'one', 'step', 'beyond.From', 'start', 'finish', 'non-actors', 'known', 'names', 'tempers', 'walk', 'film', 'conviction', 'octogenarians', 'being', 'wheeled', 'nursing', 'home', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'are', 'used', 'symbolically', 'apotheosis', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'McEnroe', 'drew', 'attention', 'while', 'back', 'behavior', 'so', 'abominable', 'dragged', 'sport', 'tennis', 'hitherto', 'unplumbed', 'depths', 'despicable', 'brat', 'was', 'only', 'allowed', 'stick', 'around', 'filled', 'seats', 'Anger', 'Management', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'line', 'knowing', 'wink', 'audience.The', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Bobby', 'Knight', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'Rudolph', 'Giuliani', 'appearance', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'funny', 'Galaxia', 'not', 'funny', 'Galaxia', 'casting', 'amusing', 'highlight', 'film', 'when', 'Nicholson', 'be', 'giving', 'Frankenstein', 'treatment', 'device', 'emitting', 'jolts', 'blue', 'electricity', 'intended', 'stimulate', 'scalp', 'Nicholson', 'comfortable', 'demented', 'irascible', 'coot', 'what', 'stretch', 'Sandler', 'always', 'lost', 'man/child', 'head', 'face', 'less', 'interesting', 'boiled', 'egg', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'good', 'actress', 'be', 'somewhat', 'anesthetized', 'insipid', 'love', 'story', 'allegedly', 'driving', 'catastrophe.That', 'Sandler', 'find', 'employment', 'renews', 'faith', 'America', 'land', 'tired', 'stupid', 'talentless', 'who', 'unapologetically', 'aim', 'low', 'open', 'arms', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'stolen', 'washed', 'up', 'tennis', 'bad', 'boy', 'lines', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'bad', ""'re"", 'awful']",Anger Management

Things have changed and both of their careers are less than admirable at this point (Nicholson is still a god, but one that coasts on a clich&eacute;, but Sandler is a mess) and this particular film rests as the beginning of the end for both of them.  I mean, this came one year after Nicholson's last great role (`About Schmidt') and right before Sandler had a string of ridiculous lows.`Anger Management' could have been funny, and I'm sure that on paper it looked like it would be a giant success, but the film fails to ever live up to any potential.  Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler yelling at one another for two hours just isn't as funny as you'd think it would be, and the endless barrage of failed jokes make this a burden to watch.  It grows tiresome and winds up draining the spirit out of the audience.  The cameos fail to make any impact (save for Reilly and Graham, to a degree).  At the end of the day this is just another one of Sandler's ill-advised film choices.The worst thing about `Anger Management' is that it is trying to have a good time but in the process it just gets everything wrong.  That seems to be Sandler's issue.  He has too much fun ruining everyone else's good time.  His humor has faded and he no longer understands how to carry a film, and Nicholson is just content in his old age to play a caricature of his own perceived persona.  There is nothing new anymore, and this is quite frankly the worst portrayal of Jack Nicholson that Nicholson has given us to date.",1,I'm not even sure this sounded good on paper...,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1650,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'time', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'acting', 'god', 'Sandler', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'funny', 'Things', 'have', 'changed', 'careers', 'are', 'less', 'admirable', 'point', 'Nicholson', 'still', 'god', 'one', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Sandler', 'mess', 'particular', 'film', 'rests', 'beginning', 'end', 'mean', 'came', 'one', 'year', 'Nicholson', 'last', 'great', 'role', 'Schmidt', 'right', 'before', 'Sandler', 'had', 'string', 'ridiculous', 'lows.', 'Anger', 'Management', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', ""'m"", 'sure', 'paper', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'giant', 'success', 'film', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'yelling', 'one', 'two', 'hours', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'endless', 'barrage', 'failed', 'jokes', 'make', 'burden', 'watch', 'tiresome', 'up', 'draining', 'spirit', 'audience', 'cameos', 'fail', 'make', 'impact', 'save', 'Reilly', 'Graham', 'degree', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'one', 'Sandler', 'ill-advised', 'film', 'choices.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'Anger', 'Management', 'trying', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'process', 'just', 'everything', 'wrong', 'be', 'Sandler', 'issue', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'ruining', 'everyone', 'else', 'good', 'time', 'humor', 'faded', 'no', 'longer', 'how', 'carry', 'film', 'Nicholson', 'just', 'content', 'old', 'age', 'play', 'caricature', 'own', 'perceived', 'persona', 'nothing', 'new', 'anymore', 'quite', 'frankly', 'worst', 'portrayal', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Nicholson', 'given', 'date']",Anger Management

Forget the plot and things like that. The mere idea of pairing these two is reason enough to see this movie.David Buznik (Sandler) is a mild - mannered businessman who has to deal with a less than admirable job and overcome his anxiousnous about proposing to his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei). While on a flight to St. Louis, David gets into an altercation with a flight attendant, though in reality he didn't really do anything wrong. The courts sentence him to Anger Management Class. There he meets Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson), a doctor who may either be a medical genius...or insane. After a failed stinit with an anger buddy (John Turtorro), Rydell decides the best way to cure David's anger is to move in with him for 30 days. And that's where the fun begins. Rydell takes David through a series of tasks to cure his anger, including a confrontation with his boss, a failed ""date"" with a weight conscious girl (Heather Graham), and most hilariously an ex - childhood bully who is now a monk (John C. Reilly). Throughout the film, we get to see each of these characters as themselves. Buddy, however, is rathrer mysterious. He leaves you through the whole film guessing if he's a good guy or a bad guy. The ending wraps things up nicely and hilariously.This film is a hilarious romp from start to finish. The two stars are both great, but of course only one really shines. Sandler may get top billing, but Jack takes this movie and runs with it. He pretty much gets all the best lines and owns the movie. Then again, it's not like it's unexpected - this is Jack Nicholson we're talking about.This film is also notable for the many cameos in this movie. Woody Harrelson, John Turtorro, Heather Graham, Bobby Knight, Louis Guzman, John C. Reilly John McEnroe, Marc Maguire, Derek Jeter and Rudy Guiliani all pop up at one point, and make the most of their screen time.

I absolutely loathe the characters, and I hate the manipulative mode that this film put me in: sugarcoating me into liking this film despite the fact that there are hundreds of explicit sexual references. From my point of view, where this movie was going looks obvious, but I am not sure entirely yet; mainly, I am thinking of The Game meets Fever Pitch. Not surprisingly, it turns out to be exactly that. The moment that Heather Graham shows up with her dumb blonde look in her eyes, I just know she was acting as a decoy. Forget everything I said. Simply put, Anger Management is truly a cornball of a movie; I just hate, hate, hate, and hate everything about it. Yeah, there are two or three funny moments; but they don't excuse the sorry mess the film got me in. Ironically, I am only willing to watch Anger Management because of Jack Nicholson despite my fears of Adam Sandler; I end up feeling sorry for him and hating Jack and everybody else except for Marisa Tomei who does a good job of looking cute as possible most of the time. My intelligence got overly insulted throughout the movie, but I knew Anger Management was turning out to be The Game. Actually, Adam Sandler's character could and should have taken control of the situation by getting a better lawyer, feeling anger that this is really ""happening"" to him, and being wronged by the situations. Of course, he is stupidly meek and follows along with the rules. When he gets to the Yankee Stadium and is admitted in without a problem, he should have stopped himself in midst of running and said to himself, ""How the heck did I get in here that easy?"" Boy, throwing in Yankee thing and the bigot mayor himself is enough to kiss Anger Management good-bye into the seas of hell. Finally, Lynne Thigpen has seen her life expired after doing Anger Management; in case, you don't know who she is. She is famous for playing the angry black ""b*tch"" from Lean on Me. I could never stand looking at her face. That Buddhist thing goes too far. Man, the ending of Anger Management says it the best. All in all, Anger Management gets a big fat F from me, and it ends with YOU. Well, I feel a little bit proud that I spotted Woody after three seconds; and then again, I had to blink a few times and ascertain that.",1,I Grew Angry After Seeing This Dreck.,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2407,"['Viewed', '6/08Rate', '16/08', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'am', 'being', 'harsh', 'Anger', 'Management', 'want', 'get', 'angry', 'kill', 'everybody', 'film', 'absolutely', 'loathe', 'characters', 'hate', 'manipulative', 'mode', 'film', 'put', 'sugarcoating', 'liking', 'film', 'fact', 'are', 'hundreds', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'references', 'point', 'view', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'looks', 'obvious', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'entirely', 'yet', 'mainly', 'am', 'thinking', 'Game', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'moment', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'up', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'look', 'eyes', 'just', 'know', 'was', 'acting', 'decoy', 'Forget', 'everything', 'said', 'Simply', 'put', 'Anger', 'Management', 'truly', 'cornball', 'movie', 'just', 'hate', 'hate', 'hate', 'hate', 'everything', 'Yeah', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'funny', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'sorry', 'mess', 'film', 'got', 'Ironically', 'am', 'only', 'willing', 'watch', 'Anger', 'Management', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'fears', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'hating', 'Jack', 'everybody', 'else', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'looking', 'cute', 'possible', 'most', 'time', 'intelligence', 'got', 'overly', 'insulted', 'movie', 'knew', 'Anger', 'Management', 'was', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'Game', 'Actually', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'control', 'situation', 'getting', 'better', 'lawyer', 'feeling', 'anger', 'really', 'happening', 'being', 'wronged', 'situations', 'course', 'stupidly', 'meek', 'along', 'rules', 'When', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'admitted', 'problem', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'midst', 'running', 'said', 'How', 'heck', 'did', 'get', 'here', 'easy', 'Boy', 'throwing', 'Yankee', 'thing', 'bigot', 'mayor', 'enough', 'kiss', 'Anger', 'Management', 'good-bye', 'seas', 'hell', 'Finally', 'Lynne', 'Thigpen', 'seen', 'life', 'expired', 'doing', 'Anger', 'Management', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'famous', 'playing', 'angry', 'black', 'b*tch', 'Lean', 'Me', 'could', 'never', 'stand', 'looking', 'face', 'Buddhist', 'thing', 'too', 'far', 'Man', 'ending', 'Anger', 'Management', 'best', 'Anger', 'Management', 'big', 'fat', 'F', 'YOU', 'Well', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'proud', 'spotted', 'Woody', 'three', 'seconds', 'then', 'again', 'had', 'blink', 'few', 'times', 'ascertain']",Anger Management
612770,AHSY48775P8RI,B00005JM4Q,Avalon Daughter,"[5, 6]","I'm really surprised that the critics jumped all over this movie.  I think it's because the critics generally don't like Sandler movies.  They love Jack but jumped all over him for agreeing to this union. I don't enjoy Sandler's usual films for that matter, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick all the way to the end.With that said, I'll again reiterate: I'm NOT a typical Sandler fan and the last movie I liked with Jack Nicholson was Witches of Eastwick.  However, when I saw the previews I was intrigued from the start.  Sandler and Nicholson?  What a wild combo!  Last time I had this reaction was when Michael J. Fox was in Frighteners, which was tauted as a horror film.  Still, the curiosity was enough for me to go out and rent it.You've probably already read the synopsis, so I'll be brief: Sandler is subjected to anger management classes, which are supervised by Nicholson's character.  His treatments are completely outrageous from the start, seemingly enraging Sandler more than pacifying his anger.  The whole film is like a sweetly wrapped present that is neatly tied up with a lovely bow at the end.  I'll leave it at that.Sandler, who is usually a whiny, strange character in his films plays the straight role, while Nicholson goes more towards the wacky.  Still, Nicholson isn't that outrageous that you believe it's a Sandler film, but Jack does steal the spotlight.The cameos in this film are just hysterical.  Some of which you'd probably miss if you blink but some are purposely put in tongue-in-cheek -- two of which being Bobby Knight and John McEnroe who are notorious temper-mongers in real life.  One that you'd miss: Clint Black playing a massage therapist.This really is a fun movie.  It has humorous moments, some crude but not completely overdone, some unbelievable but they all work wonderfully.  This is also, in my opinion, not a typical Sandler film and definitely surprising with a fun and loving ending.  I highly recommend this film for those who want a good laugh.  Sandler and Nicholson fans will thoroughly enjoy this, but others will just have fun.I give this four out of five because I always leave five for classics that I'll immediately go out and buy.

612772,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JM4Q,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 3]","At first hearing of the concept, you would think that it was a fun premise for a comedy. When word came out that it would star Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, it made seem like it could be even more interesting. It was a fun concept, and it had inspiring casting with those two put together, but the filmmakers didn't take adavantage enough of the concept and seemed to let the actors picks up the pieces. What seemed like a perfect vehicle for Adam Sandler, something right up his alley, really becomes a non-Sandler film. When you expect big outbursts and zany, slapsticky comedy, you wouldn't expect Sandler to take a more subtle, low-key approach. It really becomes The Jack Nicholson Show, and Sandler is more the straight man. Sure, he gets steam off every once in a while, but it is not the Sandler performance that one would of expected. Thankfully, there is the master. Jack. Like I said before, this is his movie. He has the best lines, the best scenes, and the most fun, spirited, and interesting performance. Well, of course. He's Jack. Of anything, Sandler bogged the film down. Adam plays Dave Buzznik, an clothes designer for overweight cats(you heard me). He seems mild mannered and quiet enough, but thru some unfortunate(and highly preposterous incidents)on an airplane, Dave is sent to go to anger management classes runned by Dr. Buddy Rydell(Nicholson), who seems to paint Dave as someone with a real problem. Things go from bad to worse when Dave's sentence is pro-longed and the good doctor decides to move in with Dave and watch him more carefully. This also buts in on Dave's relationship with his lovely girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei, who is always adorable. After some time, Dave, and you, wonder if Dr. Buddy isn't the one who's nuts. It all ends in a very &quot;safe&quot; way, and one that most can smell a mile off. What was kind of disappointing about the film is that it really didn't take advantage of the 'anger' issue. It would of been better if more anger was shown, and was shown because of everyday things that irritate all of us. Slow drivers, drivers with cell phones, talking in movie theaters, crying babies on airplanes. All of that kind of stuff. The film plays it safe and that is where it falters. Buddy's teaching technique elicits some laughs, but it's slow, and your mind sometimes wanders. This is why it would of been so good if Sandler was like himself in his other movies. Where's the jovial goofball that always acted up and had something funny to say?. That guy is rarely seen here, and it's up to the game Nicholson to carry the movie, which he does. Naturally. There were times where the movie felt forced, unnatural, and somewhat uncomfortable. The pairing of the two could of been used to so much better effect than it is here. You can also expect a handful of celebrities to cameo. People like Heather Graham, Rudy Giuliani, Harry Dean Stanton, Bobby Knight, John McEnroe, and others. Those last two you can probably guess why. It was an easy joke, but it worked.

612773,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00005JM4Q,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[1, 3]","No. It isn't. ANGER MANAGEMENT is easily Adam Sandler's best work since THE WEDDING SINGER so by the law of statistics that means we can expect an above average movie from him at least every five years. (But hey, there are CHIMPS out there who are more proficient at math that I am. At least that's what one of my former teachers told me. Bald old prat).After a stupid misunderstanding on board a plane (trying to poke fun at post 9/11 paranoia) David Buznik (Sandler who also co- Executive produced) is accused of assaulting an air hostess (a timely dig at all that P.C nonsense) and winds up in court. He is fined $3500 and ordered to attend 20 hours of anger management therapy. To Buznik's horror, his group therapist is Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who happened to be a passenger on the same plane that fateful day. Coincidence?  Or just Hollywood slothfulness?Other members of the anger management group all turn out to be dysfunctional. This includes a pair of bi-sexual female porn stars/ lovers who are in therapy because of one of them is angry at her partner kissing another woman- which they consider to be taboo territory in their business!, an over zealous football fan (NZ is full of them) who can only be calmed by chanting ""Goos fraba"" (there's a feature on the DVD that explains all this, so I don't feel any great need to go into detail about it.)But despite David being the least disturbed member of the group, Rydell takes the unusual step of DOUBLING his therapy time to 40 hours. This sees Buznik buddied up with the groups' most disturbed individual, a former war veteran named Chuck who describes himself as ""half Irish, half me, half Italian"".But this intervention fails to work, and David soon finds himself back before the court after becoming involved in another brawl. This further hurts his now fragile relationship with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei). However this time his skin is saved by Dr. Rydell who manages to get his therapy time extended by another month. The only catch is Rydell must move in with David and supervise him around the clock. The joke here is that the supposedly eternally calm Doctor is prone to outbursts of anger and his therapy tactics start to become more and more eccentric & unorthodox- joggling on the thin line between genius and madness.Standout scenes include a gag which involves Nicholson smashing a car window with a golf club (a few years back he wound up in the headlines for doing just that) and an unbilled Heather Graham making a brief appearance in her underwear (Yeah baby!) as well as cameos by Woody Harrelson, John C Reilly and Rudy Guliani. But the highlight of the movie for me is the sequence where Rydell has Dave confront the guy who used to bully him at school; who is now a Buddhist (Isn't that typical? You find religion and it makes everything all right! What a cop-out!In fact ANGER MANAGEMENT is Grade A comedy until the (deep breath) TYPICALLY SAPPY HOLLYWOOD ENDING which may leave you feeling cheated. Blame Writer David Dorfman. That remains my only complaint. Heck, if I gave it four stars, Sandler fanatics will revere this as a modern classic! (No offence intended. We're all entitled to our opinions). Just watch the movie, and enjoy it.DVD extras include Commentary by Seagal and Sandler, featurettes, outtakes and a short film starring Sandler's cute bulldog, Meatball.",4,IS THIS A MISPRINT?

He also has some great punch lines, moments of comic genius, &amp; purely great moments.  Adam, however, stays fairly boring in the movie with just some of his typical goofball antics in the movie, but his scene is when he goes after Jack towards the end of the movie.

You get some great ""Hey, I know that guy from somewhere"" faces for the co-stars (who all turn in great performances). The only thing you miss is all the laughs you could have been given. While there are some absolutely hilarious moments (Sandler reluctantly gets into a fight with a blind guy in a bar), there are some gross-out moments that you can skip (two women kissing and doing other things throughout the movie). The language is also kind of fierce in parts, and the biggest running joke in the film is about one character's rather large body part.

Adam Sandler causes a commotion on a plane and is forced by a court to attend anger management classes, instructed by Jack Nicholson. You would expect the pairing of Opera Man and Jack Nicholson to result in a lot of laughs, and there are a few funny moments littered about, but most of the gags were forced and fell flat.I understand realism isn't important in a comedy, but the entire premise was hastily thrown together just to team these two clowns together. The court and other scenes were so unreal that too much suspension of disbelief was required. Even so, it still could have been funny, but I was shocked at how poorly written some of these jokes were. Sandler seems perfect for this part, as his persona is one of gentleless with a hidden rage lurking underneath, but his odd line delivery isn't working anymore. The whole 'quiet mouse/sudden yelling' thing that he did so well in movies like the Wedding Singer and on Saturday Night Live, is getting old.Nicholson, who is such a good actor and just a naturally funny guy, couldn't do much with the nonsense in this script.There were some good cameos towards the end, including a grand appearance by the majestic Yankee Stadium, but by then my face had already frozen into stone.

I'm not sure how he manages to portray the angry parts while still conveying his usual expressionlessness.  The support group has some expected stereotypes that some people find amusing- lesbian lovers, a man prone to violence, a repressed gay man- and the characters provide some unsuprising gags. Marisa Tomei is lovely as Sandler's girlfriend, not a role with a lot of humor, although she seems sweet.  Dave gets to work with a fat cat with the same personality that Sandler  himself appears to have, so fans of stoic fat cats will enjoy the cat dressing scenes, sparse though they are.Most of the movie was highly improbable- Buddy vandalises a car and alienates Dave's co-workers, abuses him in his own home by moving in for 30 days- yet we're expected to swallow this as plausible.  There is some sort of trickery involving Buddy and Dave's girlfriend- oddly enough she supports the trickery.  When the full plot line is ""dramatically"" revealed to us, we learn she had a bigger role in this than was originally assumed, yet oddly, Dave still trusts her and wants to marry her.hmmm.... not sure I would marry someone who did that to me.One of the few funny things that actually worked was the role in which Woody Harrelson- he has an immense amount of potential as the Lovely and Talented Galaxia.",3,a silly fairytale,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,1857,"['initial', 'premise', 'film', 'fine-', 'Dave', 'Sandler', 'sent', 'anger', 'management', 'training', 'misunderstanding', 'training', 'done', 'Buddy', 'Dr.', 'Nutcase', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'poor', 'Not', 'Angry', 'Dave', 'court-ordered', 'doing', 'more', 'retraining', 'whims', 'Learned', 'Nutcase.Beyond', 'absurd', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'amusing.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'always', 'wonderful', 'crazy', 'person', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'appeal', 'deadpan', 'charactersplayed', 'Adam', 'Sandler-', 'one', 'included', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'portray', 'angry', 'parts', 'still', 'conveying', 'usual', 'expressionlessness', 'support', 'group', 'expected', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'find', 'amusing-', 'lesbian', 'lovers', 'man', 'prone', 'violence', 'repressed', 'gay', 'man-', 'characters', 'provide', 'unsuprising', 'gags', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'lovely', 'Sandler', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'role', 'lot', 'humor', 'sweet', 'Dave', 'work', 'fat', 'cat', 'same', 'personality', 'Sandler', 'have', 'fans', 'stoic', 'fat', 'cats', 'will', 'enjoy', 'cat', 'dressing', 'scenes', 'sparse', 'are.Most', 'movie', 'was', 'highly', 'improbable-', 'Buddy', 'car', 'Dave', 'co-workers', 'own', 'home', 'moving', '30', 'days-', 'yet', ""'re"", 'expected', 'swallow', 'plausible', 'sort', 'trickery', 'involving', 'Buddy', 'Dave', 'girlfriend-', 'oddly', 'enough', 'trickery', 'When', 'full', 'plot', 'line', 'dramatically', 'revealed', 'learn', 'had', 'bigger', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'assumed', 'yet', 'oddly', 'Dave', 'still', 'marry', 'her.hmmm', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'marry', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'me.One', 'few', 'funny', 'things', 'actually', 'worked', 'was', 'role', 'Woody', 'Harrelson-', 'immense', 'amount', 'potential', 'Lovely', 'Talented', 'Galaxia']",Anger Management

ANGER MANAGEMENT certainly doesn't disappoint: it has its share of juvenile lewdness, politically incorrect humor, and flatulence jokes.  But unlike some of his Saturday Night Live peers, Sandler knows that you can only make so many [obscene] jokes in a ninety minute film.  There's usually something sweeter underneath.In ANGER MANAGEMENT, Sandler plays mild-mannered Dave Buznik, who suddenly finds himself sentenced to anger managment class.  Directing his therapy is Dr. Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson.  The therapy becomes more difficult for Dave when he finds himself placed in Buddy's intensive anger management program, which requires the two of them to live together in the close quarters of Dave's apartment.The screenplay hinges on the chemistry between Sandler and Nicholson, and for the most part, it works.  Sandler plays Dave as quiet and emotionally suppressed.  Buddy Rydell is portrayed by Nicholson with an intense energy that works well with the part.  While neither role is a great stretch for either actor, in the end the relationship works, and the odd pairing makes for some interesting scenes.The ""sweeter"" part of this film is provided by the relationship between Dave and his girlfriend Linda, played by Marisa Tomei.  The film is obviously centered on Dave and Buddy, but Tomei is a welcome addition to her few scenes.In the end, most people will either see this film because they like Sandler or not see the film because they hate Sandler.  I'm not a big Sandler fan but the pairing was too unusual to miss.

612799,A103KNDW8GN92L,B00005JM4Q,David Hugaert,"[2, 3]","Jack Nicholson seems to have a fetish for portraying dark, brooding and psychotic personalities in film. First, he was wreaking havoc as a wacko mental patient in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". Next, he's posessed of a demonic spirit as a hotel resort guest in ""The Shining"". Now, he sort of reprises the first role in ""Anger Management"" - except, instead of being ""the hunted"", who once ran amok in an isolated mental ward, he is now ""the hunter"" - as a psychiatrist who hasn't quite cleared his head of those demented cobwebs, it seems. Enter a mild-mannered guy (Adam Sandler), who is extremely calm on the surface, but is somewhat a powder keg underneath. Thus, it takes a lot to get this Type A study in contrast to explode. This is where aversion type therapy kicks in, and the results could get quite messy, and hilarious in certain instances. While Nicholson's psychiatrist persona gets on Sandler's character's last nerve, it appears the former is teaching the latter everything he knows from his years of expertise at the same time - both from his view of life and from his profession. The storyline is good, containing a good dose of comedy with a touch of drama to spice it up. Add a fine main cast and a few celebrities to the mix, and you have the ultimate therapy session. Joining both Nicholson and Sandler in session, are John McEnroe, Bob Knight and other celebrities. Kevin Nealon, Woody Harrelson and Lynne Thigpen (in her final role), among others, round out the main cast. Need psychological help, but can't afford the high fees often associated with such therapy?

It was obvious from his days on SNL that he can play different characters; and that he can act when lead by a good director(""Punch Drunk Love"").  But once again he has been type-cast as a fumbling dork on the verge of violence.  Apparently, the 13-year-olds and delayed-adolescents love it, because all I heard at the box-office was ""CHA-CHING!""  There is another Hollywood trend being embraced here: let's cast a repsected veteran actor with a younger, less-respected or lesser-known actor.  You want examples?  How about ""Hollywood Homicide""  and ""The Recruit""?  This is derivative and predictable, testosterone-based comedy.  Crude sexual humor has been done so many times...that I'm getting a headache.  If you want this kind of humor, watch reruns of ""Married with Children.""  At least on that show it was so cheesy and ridiculous that it came across funny.  They spent millions of dollars making this film, people!  They should have had a few more re-writes.  However, if I really hated the movie I would have given it 1 star.  It's just all been done before.  Doesn't anyone else out there get tired of hearing the same jokes?  There were three moments worth mentioning.  John Turturro, with his over-the-top, raging mania was humorous, but he didn't get enough screen time.  Heather Graham(yowza!), has an extremely funny moment throwing fudge(or was it chocolate cake?), yelling about how no man will sleep with her because she's fat(yeah, right).  The remaining moment comes when Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson get into a rendition of ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story,"" stopped in the middle of a bridge, traffic congestion forming behind them as they sing.  But the song is repeated later in the score, as well as a finale at the end of the film which makes it sound tired.  I rented this film on a coupon: rent one, get one free!

When I got to the end, though, it all made sense, and the movie went from a 3-star, average comedy to a 4-star comedy/drama.Dave (Adam Sandler) is on a plane and people start completely overreacting to his simplest request, accusing him of being belligerent. It escalates, and he finds himself arrested and sentenced to anger therapy with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). Again, things escalate, and Buddy ends up moving in with Dave and shadowing him everywhere, even moving in on Dave's girlfriend (Marisa Tomei).I started out the movie being angry on Dave's behalf, then gradually became irritated with him for allowing all these things to continue happening to him--in retrospect, it was a very effective bit of filmmaking, because that's exactly what I believe the audience was intended to feel.Adam Sandler was believable as the mild-mannered, put-upon young businessman.

I had zero expectations going into this movie, but as soon as the hilarious plane scene unfolded I found myself watching with an ear-to-ear grin on my mug.I've seen Adam Sandler in numerous movies (and hated most of them), but as humble, wishy-washy Dave Buznik, Sandler is at his low-key best.  Buznik is the last person to have an anger management problem, but following a fateful series of miscues (and hysterically funny miscues at that) he is ordered by a judge to attend an anger management course.  And this is not just any old course:  This is a course led by the unorthodox and dysfunctional Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson's inherent creepiness is perfect for this role).  Nicholson and Sandler play off one another in grand fashion; the goofy therapist pushing the mild-mannered Buznik to the edge--and beyond--is mucho fun to watch!An added delight to this campy comedy is the plethora of camoes, including John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson (also hysterically funny), Rudy Giuliani, and New York Yankee greats (and ex-greats) Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.

He was decent in The Wedding Singer but the traielrs on all his other movies seemed incredibly stupid.  Since Jack Nicolson and Marrisa Tomei were playing opposite Sandler, I figured why not give the man a break.Somewhat to my surprise, Sandler's character did not come accross as totally looney, weird, or semi-retarded.  David Buznik(Sandler's character) plays a timid businessman who is always afraid of confronting others and standing up for his rights.  An incident aboard an airplane causes Buznik to undergo Anger Management therapy. There are many oddball scenarios that occur between Buznik and Dr. Buddy Rydell.The uncertainty that Buznik feels about his new live in shrink,Buddy Rydell has some comic moments but other spots of shear annoyance.  However, through all the lunacy the good doctor Rydell slowly gets David Buznik to differentiate between good anger and bad anger.  Whereas the climatic scene at Yankee Stadium is oh so silly, David Buznik finally realizes that only he needs to take more of a stand in controlling his life.Somehow I feel the script could have been a more sensible comedy instead of a crazy silly comedy.  Nonetheless, Jack Nicolson's commanding performance does elevate this film.  Notable performances by Woody Harrelson and John Tarturo help as well as the usual schtick from Sandler and Tomei.

He hits a new low (all time low for sadly misplaced JACK NICOLSON- this roll makes one think we'll see him next on an episode of WILL AND GRACE as a dance instructor or something) with ANGER MANAGEMENT, a silly excuse for a film with bits that don't hit and a script that isn't there.  SANDLER's films (though never avant garde) have looked and felt the same since HAPPY GILMORE, which was a laugh riot of a movie and led one to believe that the half hour comedy hour comic had the ability to create movie personas that elevated above standard SAT. NIGHT LIVE box office junk.  Too bad GILMORE was his opus and he has apparently run out of funny ink.  I tried to keep watching this flick past the groan inducing WOODY HARRLESON German transvestite hooker scene, but had to call it quits after the next cameo, which I am embarrased for HEATHER GRAHAM to have watched.  As with most of SANDLER's earlier escapades, the supporting players are better than the general material, but even that redeeming quality no longer exsists and especially not here.

All he wants is headset so he can watch the movie playing on the airplane, but things quickly spirals out of control from there, and before he realizes what is happening, he is sitting in court while the judge sentences him to participate in twenty hours of anger management therapy.  The person in charge of the sessions is one Dr. Buddy Rydell, a renowned clinical psychologist with some unorthodox methods in treating his patients.  As Dr. Rydell invades in every aspects of Dave's private life, Dave must keep his temper or faces jail time if he fails the evaluation.""There are two kinds of angry people, explosive and implosive.""Apparently writer David Dorfman have no trouble making fun of and insulting anything and anyone he can get his hands on in Anger Management.  The jokes range from the tasteless to the somewhat amusing, but more often than not they are mean spirited rather than funny.  The endless barrage of penis cracks becomes so tiresome that I found myself grimacing instead of laughing at them.  Of course, who can forget the not so subtle references to Sandler's other movies.  The plot is mostly nonsensical and serves only to take the characters from one point to the next, with the hopes to squeeze out a few chuckles in the process.  The ending is mawkishly sentimental and will probably have you rolling your eyes at the corniness of the whole thing.Adam Sandler plays the soft-spoken Dave Buznik, a guy who is intensely paranoid about showing affections in public.  His portrayal and delivery is practically a carbon copy of most of his prior roles, the differences between Dave and Sonny Koufax and Bobby Boucher are small if any at all.  Jack Nicholson, on the other hand, seems to have a lot of fun with Dr. Buddy Rydell, an eccentric man who lives by his own rules.  Nicholson by far is the most comical character of the bunch, and I would not mind seeing him paired up with Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson in the future.  This is not to say that Sandler and Nicholson did not emanate chemistry between the two of them, the most hilarious scene has got to be them singing a duet of ""I Feel Pretty"" from West Side Story.  Unfortunately, those moments are rare.  Marisa Tomei plays Sandler's love interest Linda.  The notable cameos this time around consist of Heather Graham, Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly.Anger Management plays like most of the previous Adam Sandler comedies, if you enjoy his routines, this will probably fit right in.  I, however, was not amused by the experience.  Laughs came only in fits and spurts for me, most of the time I sat wondering when the next punch line will be and how much longer the movie will drag on.  There is nothing special here.

In what should've been a really funny movie turned out to be a very slow paced, laugh every 20 minutes type movie. In my opinion Sandler's last comedy (Mr. Deeds)was his worst comedy movie but this one soon may take over. This film truly suffers from being too predictable and WAY too many jokes about the size of Sandler's character's manhood (got old after the first joke yet it seems like it's mentioned in every scene). The acting is good though it's just not the comedy it should be, especially with these two going head to head. Jack doesn't take too many roles like this and you would expect him to pull off a Deniro type performance (what was up with the I Feel Pretty song, which was also used in Analyze That, wasn't it). Hearing Deniro sing a showtune was funny but it felt old and stale once Jack started singing it.It's too bad that this movie didn't live up to it's expectations because it could've been one of those great comedies. Sandler like I said is really lacking it these days and that's kinda sad but he basically plays the same type character in every film anyways and Punch Drunk Love wasn't his Jim Carrey type turn he was hoping for.

612837,AX19A39YU2Y71,B00005JM4Q,"J. Cain ""fuzzlekins""","[0, 0]","The plot of this movie is very well managed ... Just when you think you know what's going on and what's real, you realize that it may not be.  It's not until the very end that everything becomes clear, and that's good plot management.  You don't feel lost along the way, and it's not predictable at all ... the writers guide you safely and humorously through the entire movie, then surprise you at the end.  I love that!  Now, how funny was it?  The movie stars Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, and as shown in the previews, Jack Nicholson winds up living with Adam Sandler ... what could be funnier, right?  Well, sort of.  In my opinion, the previews were too funny because they set the laugh expectation too high.  After seeing the previews, I expected this film to be an absolute laugh-fest.  It was not.  Nonetheless, it was funny (very funny and uncomfortably funny in parts) and well worth the watch.  I'm just saying that you will enjoy the movie more if you go into it with lesser expectations than I did.  That said, a little about the plot ...Sandler plays a soft-spoken, docile administrative assistant to a credit-stealing, jerk of an executive.  His girlfriend is played by Marisa Tomei, who is adorable as usual.  Early in the movie, Sandler winds up sitting next to Nicholson on a plane.  While Nicholson is boisterous and annoying, Sandler remains calm.  However, at Nicholson's prodding, Sandler asks the flight attendant for headphones ... three times.  On the final request, the flight attendant accuses Sandler of being hostile, even though he never raises his voice.  Sandler winds up being zapped by the US Marshall on the flight, and taken into custody for assaulting the flight attendant.  In court, where Kevin Nealon plays Sandler's lawyer, Sandler is ordered to enroll in Nicholson's anger management program.  To Sandler's surprise, the crazy man from the plane is going to be his psychologist.  Thus starts the antics of the film.

I'm recommending the movie for all the laughs there  were before the weak baseball stadium scene. It's so much fun seeing Sandler and Nicholson together especially with Nicholson in excellent nutty form.

612846,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JM4Q,Joe Sherry,"[4, 7]","A film by Peter SegalFor a movie with so much potential it sure was a let down.  This could have been a real show-off piece for Adam Sandler, working with Jack Nicholson.  The idea was good, Sandler being required to take an anger management class from Nicholson.  The execution was poor.  The bottom line is that the movie just wasn't funny.Dave (Adam Sandler) is a very non-confrontational man.  He has to fly out on a business trip.  When he calmly and quietly asks the flight attendant for headphones, the flight attendant freaks out, tells him to calm down and with every word that Dave says, she gets more and more alarmed until an air marshal steps in.  We next see Dave in court where he is convicted for assaulting the flight attendant and he is assigned an anger management course.  The doctor leading the course is Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).  Rydell appears to be slightly unhinged and as Dave works with the doctor, Rydell ends up getting Dave in more and more trouble until successfully completing the anger management training is the only hope to keep Dave out of prison.The whole problem stems from the fact that right from the start, the movie is not funny.  Considering the premise of Dave being put into anger management, I guess the point was that Dave exhibited no signs of anger.  The only problem is that during the scene on the airplane it was so obvious that Dave had done nothing wrong that it just sucked all the humor out of the scene.  The flight attendant wasn't over-reacting, she was reacting to nothing at all.  I thought the movie started out not being funny, and continued not being funny throughout the whole movie.

During the nineties there was a supply and demand for road comedy movies, for the most part. And now there seems to be a supply of Adam Sandler movies, with half-and-half demand. The younger crowds love him, and usually the older hoards of people despise him.In ""Anger Management,"" Sandler tries his hand at a buddy formula. It works on occassion, is at often times quite humorous, but fails to deliver what I really expected until the last thirty minutes, which finally gets some nice laughs in on a consistent basis.Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a generally peaceful young man who is flying on business. On the flight, Dave sits next to Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an obnoxious loudmouth (or so it appears at first glance) who insists that Dave should watch the in-flight movie Buddy himself is watching. Dave asks a flight attendant for a set of headphones, the stewardess starts chatting up a friend, the headphones never come. Dave asks again, and suddenly the stewardess is asking him not to yell. The next thing he knows, he's in an anger management program for assaulting a flight attendant, even though he simply touched her arm to stop her from walking away down the aisle, ignoring him.Big surprise for Dave when he finds out the anger management program is run by Buddy Rydell, who invites Dave to an anger group, comprised of Chuck (John Turturro), a crazy man who believes everyone hates him, Lou (Luis Guzman), who is gay, and two female lovers.Dave, who is not angry nor crazy, starts to think everyone else is, as Buddy moves into his apartment and even follows him to work. This of course gets in the way of his relationship with his girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei), who says they need to have some ""time apart."" You can expect what happens in the rest of the film.I was disappointed in this film overall. The first thirty minutes were painfully unfunny and predictable. The end somewhat redeems itself, but still doesn't make the film as great as it could have been given the potential.The cast is stellar, ranging from Nicholson to Kevin Nealon to an uncredited cameo by Heather Graham. I found it humorous that most of the cast has been in P.T.

The Village's twist was a groaner and the last scene of The Last Samurai knocked it down a rung or two. in a comedy however the end shouldn't matter.Comedy is about laughter during the journey not the stories conclusion. None of our best comedies are known for their finales. Meet the Parents left with a comparative whimper, There's Something about Mary's ending is at best forgettable, and the bombastic over the top noise of say The Blues Brothers or Caddyshack certainly wasn't for everyone. (The exception to this rule is the wonderful Stay Puff Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters)Unlike thrillers or drama, comedy rarely invests enough in the plot to begin with for the ending to matter all that much. In addition, an Adam Sandler comedy, let us face it, has less plot than most. Alternatively, at the very least, it has the same plot and characters over and over again. Sandler after all is the Jim Varney of Long Island nerds. Therefore, to create a disaster this momentous you first need an hour and change of good comedy (rare enough esp. with Mr. Sandler on board) then you will need an ending so stupendously bad it erases the laughter.First the good news. This movie has some quite funny bits. The bad news? Well let's start with the last 15 minutes or so absolutely feel good romantic awfulness with enough celebrity cameos that could sink the Titanic, wipe out any goodwill one feels towards former Mayor Giulliani of New York and embarrass one to be a Yankee fan. Add on a plot device at the end that would not be out of place in a Deanna Durbin film and let the jaw dropping awfulness commence.The last 15 minutes aside, this movie has some funny bits. Even stupid stuff like sweaters for overweight cats worked for me. Now that is rare. The set-up is pure gold and the cast is great.If anything, Sandler is easily the weakest of the bunch. (Luis Guzman and John Turturro's characters needed their own movie and it was great seeing Jack be Jack again after that slog that was About Schmidt. Sandler knows how to do cruel. Anger Management was such a good concept and had such funny execution that it demanded a dark cruel outburst of energy at the end not indescribably painful schmaltz.",3,The movie will make you laugh.

A cameo of Woody Harrelson ( The People Vs.Larry Flynt )as a German woman is also funny.Luiz Guzman ( Confidence,Carlitos' Way & also of the movie:""Boogie Nights""- is this movie a ""Boogie Nights""reunion ?)is solid as another candidate for therapy.Anger Management has an excellent soundtrack of pleasant 1970's soft rock along with classic 1970's rock n'roll that is music to the ears ( pun intended ). Sandler is best known for roles in such movies as ""Big Daddy"",""Mr.Deeds"",""The Wedding Singer"". Speaking of singing- remember Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live as ""Opera Man "" ? He is forced to sing as part of his therapy and sing he does. This is a really good comedy that really plays up a great script with great acting and lots of laughter set to a good soundtrack- Enjoy !",4,Uncredited actors: Heather Grahm + John C.Reilly co-star,1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,1907,"['Anger', 'management', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Assertiveness', 'training', 'man', 'who', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'portraying', 'really', 'not', 'angry', 'passive', 'man', 'who', 'everyone', 'be', 'angry', 'Surprisingly', 'cast', 'two', 'uncredited', 'actors', 'Grahm', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'License', 'Drive', 'dreamgirl', 'John', 'C.Reilly', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'Magnolia', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'grown', 'up', 'version', 'childhood', 'bully', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character.The', 'cast', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'As', 'Good', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'billed', 'second', 'Sandler', 'odd', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'actress', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'good', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'one', ""'real"", 'kiss', 'proof', 'however', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'filled', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'rewind', 'just', 'see', 'hear', 'laugh', 'again', 'more', 'script', 'intelligently', 'written.John', 'Turturrow', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'Do', 'Right', 'THing', 'hilarious', 'man', 'anger', 'management', 'therapy', 'cameo', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'People', 'Vs.Larry', 'Flynt', 'German', 'woman', 'also', 'funny.Luiz', 'Guzman', 'Confidence', 'Carlitos', 'Way', 'also', 'movie', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'movie', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'reunion', 'solid', 'candidate', 'therapy.Anger', 'Management', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'pleasant', '1970', 'soft', 'rock', 'classic', '1970', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'music', 'ears', 'pun', 'intended', 'Sandler', 'best', 'known', 'roles', 'such', 'movies', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Mr.Deeds', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Speaking', 'singing-', 'remember', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Opera', 'Man', 'forced', 'sing', 'part', 'therapy', 'sing', 'really', 'good', 'comedy', 'really', 'up', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'lots', 'laughter', 'set', 'good', 'soundtrack-', 'Enjoy']",Anger Management

Bernabo,"[5, 7]","I am sure I am not the only one who saw the trailer for &quot;Anger Management&quot; in which an apparently mild mannered Adam Sandler makes a polite request for a set of headphones from a flight attendant and is repeatedly told to &quot;calm down.&quot;  The next thing we know Sandler's character, Dave Buznik, is sentenced to attend anger management seminars with Dr. Buddy Rydell, who is played by Jack Nicholson, which really makes most questions about the reasons Dave ends up in this situation pretty moot.  After all, this is a film with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.  Plot seems a secondary consideration.  However, it turns out our initial queries were not as misdirected as might think, especially as it becomes clear that if anything, Buddy's problem is that he is not angry enough.Ultimately, &quot;Anger Management&quot; is something of a disappointment.  There are some funny moments, but the funniest one comes relatively early in the proceedings and involves Dr. Buddy requiring Dave to sing &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; from &quot;West Side Story.&quot;  Dave does the accented falsetto on the lead and Buddy provides the appropriate accompaniments.  The other standout sequence involves Dave and a Buddhist monk played by John C. Reilly, who is put one of many recognizable names running around in this film.  You also have Marisa Tomei as Dave's patient girlfriend, Kevin Nealon as his attorney, Luis Guzm&aacute;n and John Turturro as other members of the anger management group, and Woody Harrelson in a rather surprising little role.  Cameos begin with Bobby Knight and end with Rudolph Giuliani, Robert Merrill, Roger Clemens, and Derek Jeter.  You can also throw into the mix the uncredited performances by Reilly, Heather Graham, and Harry Dean Stanton.You know full well why this impressive supporting cast signed up for this movie: because it had Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.  The mere idea of that combination has got to make you smile, and if the end result is less than satisfactory (which is certainly true), then the fault, dear Brutus, must be on the other side of the camera.  This is David Dorfman's first script, and you know he did not write it with both Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson in mind (no rookie scribe would dare be that ambitious), so he gets a pass.  But director Peter Segel has &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; on his resume and the producers claim credit for such works as &quot;The Animal, &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Joe Dirt.&quot;  Actually, it is the usually Sandler gang, which is where I think this film goes wrong.  If Adam Sandler wants to play with the big boys, which he is no doubt capable of doing, then he needed to bring in some big guns to rework the script and shot the movie.  This was a great idea for a movie, but this is not a great movie.  Your level of disappointment may vary, but it is, I fear, inevitable given the universal heightened expectations.",4,A great idea to pair these two but this is not a great movie,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,2943,"['am', 'sure', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'saw', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Anger', 'Management', 'quot', 'apparently', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'polite', 'request', 'set', 'headphones', 'flight', 'attendant', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'quot', 'down.', 'quot', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Sandler', 'character', 'Dave', 'Buznik', 'sentenced', 'attend', 'anger', 'management', 'seminars', 'Dr', 'Buddy', 'Rydell', 'who', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'really', 'most', 'questions', 'reasons', 'Dave', 'up', 'situation', 'pretty', 'moot', 'film', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Plot', 'secondary', 'consideration', 'However', 'out', 'initial', 'queries', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'misdirected', 'might', 'think', 'especially', 'clear', 'anything', 'Buddy', 'problem', 'not', 'angry', 'enough.Ultimately', 'quot', 'Anger', 'Management', 'quot', 'something', 'disappointment', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'funniest', 'one', 'relatively', 'early', 'proceedings', 'Dr', 'Buddy', 'requiring', 'Dave', 'sing', 'quot', 'Feel', 'Pretty', 'quot', 'quot', 'West', 'Side', 'Story.', 'quot', 'Dave', 'accented', 'falsetto', 'lead', 'Buddy', 'appropriate', 'accompaniments', 'other', 'standout', 'sequence', 'Dave', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'put', 'one', 'many', 'recognizable', 'names', 'running', 'around', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Dave', 'patient', 'girlfriend', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'attorney', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'John', 'Turturro', 'other', 'members', 'anger', 'management', 'group', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'rather', 'surprising', 'little', 'role', 'Cameos', 'begin', 'Bobby', 'Knight', 'end', 'Rudolph', 'Giuliani', 'Robert', 'Merrill', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'can', 'also', 'throw', 'mix', 'uncredited', 'performances', 'Reilly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton.You', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'why', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'cast', 'signed', 'up', 'movie', 'had', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'mere', 'idea', 'combination', 'got', 'make', 'smile', 'end', 'result', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'certainly', 'true', 'then', 'fault', 'dear', 'Brutus', 'must', 'be', 'other', 'side', 'camera', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'first', 'script', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'mind', 'rookie', 'scribe', 'would', 'dare', 'be', 'ambitious', 'so', 'pass', 'director', 'Peter', 'Segel', 'quot', 'Tommy', 'Boy', 'quot', 'resume', 'producers', 'claim', 'credit', 'such', 'works', 'quot', 'Animal', 'quot', 'Deuce', 'Bigalow', 'Male', 'Gigolo', 'quot', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Dirt.', 'quot', 'Actually', 'usually', 'Sandler', 'gang', 'where', 'think', 'film', 'wrong', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'play', 'big', 'boys', 'doubt', 'capable', 'doing', 'then', 'needed', 'bring', 'big', 'guns', 'rework', 'script', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'level', 'disappointment', 'may', 'vary', 'fear', 'inevitable', 'given', 'universal', 'heightened', 'expectations']",Anger Management

If Roger Ebert pans a movie, it invariably is a good movie...  Check it out.  It actually makes Ebert a usable critic as long as you use the George Costanza approach of doing the opposite.So what about Anger Management?  Sure enough, Ebert hated it.  And, sure enough, it's a damn funny movie with a liberal dose of intelligence and insight.  I'm not allowed to reveal spoilers here, so I'll have to keep my comments relatively vague.  Nicholson, not surprisingly, is stellar in the role of psychotherapist qua psycho.  And this isn't Nicholson dialing it in.  Maybe the restrained performance he delivered in About Schmidt triggered this therapeutically free-wheeling performance.  Whatever it is, Jack's performance is genuine and genuinely hilarious.  Some people can't stand Sandler, and I don't expect them to fall in love with him here.  But this is Sandler's most restrained and likeable performance.  He instinctively knows that he can't compete with Nicholson's craziness, it seems, so he pulls back enough to make his character a sympathetic ""everyman"" who suffers from one of society's chronic ills:  sublimated anger.  Nicholson and Sandler riff off each other in scenes that brim with spontaneity and freshness.There nothing extraordinarily insightful about the plot line, but it talks about the modern male predicament in an interesting and wise voice.  You just need to catch the groove and roll with it.  And be prepared for a lot of it to be just plain silly and over the top.The bottom line is that this movie is both witty and fun, and Roger Ebert dislikes it.

612869,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JM4Q,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Adam Sandler is one of those actors who hits and misses with the best of them. Perhaps one of the more successful alumni from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE when it comes to the crossover to film, he started big and has since dropped down a bit. This could be explained by the fact that he chose to almost make the same movie over and over again and then tried to do something completely different. I mean BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE and THE WATERBOY were basically all about a bumbling idiot who ended up doing well. And folks enjoyed those movies.Although you can't make the same movie forever and expect it to do well, shifting gears to portray a son of the Devil didn't seem to be a good career move. And MR.DEEDS didn't do so hot either as he chose to make the bumbling idiot a sap instead. So it's great to see that he's chosen to take his abilities in a different direction and do it right with this film.ANGER MANAGEMENT features Sandler as Dave Buznik, a backwards, overworked and underappreciated exec who does the work while his boss garners the rewards. On a plane trip to join him to present a new idea, Dave is charged with assault on a stewardess simply because he asks for a set of headphones all the while being ignored. The judge sentences Dave to anger management therapy. His therapist?  Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the passenger who sat next to him on the plane egging him on.In group therapy, Dave continues his backward ways. When he gets slightly miffed about the way Buddy is handling things, Buddy tells him that he's going to require more intensive therapy.Moving in with Dave, Buddy takes over his life. He goes with him to work, hits on his girlfriend, spouts off to his boss and goes so far as to sleep in the same bed with him since the apartment is so small. He goes as far as to make Dave confront his old grade school nemesis, now a peace loving Buddhist monk!Through it all we are allowed to see Dave as he changes. Buddy's techniques may be a bit odd and at one point we all might hate him as he seems about to do something dreadful (hey I don't want to spoil everything), but the results and the changes that Dave goes through are there for us to see. And the twist at the end comes out of nowhere, making sense and giving the whole movie an even better feel.Had this movie been made with just anyone, it might not have turned out near as well. But Sandler and Nicholson both turn in tremendous performances. Sandler's bumbler has become a character with abilities that he just hasn't tapped into yet. And Nicholson's Dr. Buddy is one of his most eccentric and yet endearing as well.The laughs here are natural and ones that will not only tickle but make you guffaw at times as well.

Dr. Rydell moves in with Buznik and begins to control his life, going so far as putting moves on the younger man's girlfriend (a wonderful Marisa Tomei, bouncing back up after her horrible performance in IN THE BEDROOM).There are a few forced laughs here and there, mostly from seeing what crazy thing Nicholson's character will do next. It gets old fast. I thought this would be better than the typical Sandler farce. I was wrong.The best and by far most clever thing in Anger Management are cameos featuring Bobby Knight, John McEnroe, and ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as hilarious appearances by Woody Harrelson, Heather Graham, and John C. Reilly.If in desperate need of a laugh, this movie isn't for you. If there is nothing else to see, go for the nothing else instead.

The combination of droll-faced and laconic Adam Sandler with the devilish and ferocious Jack Nicholson could have been a match made in heaven, but somewhere along the line, it just doesn't gel.  Sandler plays a young businessman who was mocked and scorned as a child and who finds himself in court after supposedly assaulting an airline flight attendant.  Nicholson plays the celebrated anger management counselor who is supposed to set Sandler on the right path.Perhaps because the plot of the movie is really just one big set-up, it may be that an audience finds it hard to swallow all that Sandler has to go through for incidents that were truly not his fault.  By its over the top ending, though, we find out why Sandler was subjected to this anger management therapy, and the happy ending seems to set things right?  Marisa Tomei seems a little too old for Sandler and spends most of her time looking doe-eyed; John Turturro has a nice role as a very angry patient who is partnered with Sandler; and we have cameos from Heather Graham and Woody Harrelson that aren't particularly noteworthy, although watching Graham talk with a mouth full of cupcake is a bit inspired.

Things get out of hand when there's a little misunderstanding on an airplane.  The outcome of that &quot;misunderstanding&quot; leaves David having to undergo extreme anger therapy under the care of Dr. Buddy Rydell.  Buddy has big plans for David and is determined to cure him of his &quot;anger problems&quot; once and for all... that is, if the two don't end up killing each other.  The results are hilarious and unpredictable in this wildly entertaining comedy, &quot;Anger Management.&quot;Who would've thought that we would one day see a movie with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson working side-by-side.  The end result is pretty entertaining and impressive.  &quot;Anger Management&quot; has one goal and one goal only; to make people laugh.  This movie is not looking to receive any Academy Awards; nor is it looking to get high critical acclaim.  This is here to make us laugh and is not here to make the world a better place.  And, I happen to think that it succeeds.The movie is very funny and surprising.  Sandler and Nicholson make a terrific team, as you can tell that they enjoyed every minute of it.  There's a lot of wonderful actors in this, such as Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, John Turturro and many more.  The script is pretty funny and comical.  While the story isn't flawless or ingenious, it's still a nice premise and keeps us entertained throughout the duration of the movie.  There's a lot of cool twists and turns that will keep your complete attention and keeps the movie fresh and interesting.I really love the DVD for this movie, as I think they did an excellent job of putting it together.  There's a lot of cool extras on it and the picture quality looks great.  The only downside to it is that I don't think it has the best sound.  You can hear a little distortion at times.  It's nothing major, but it is noticeable.  Special features included are trailers, two featurettes, audio commentary from Sandler and the director, a gag reel and a DVD-ROM game.  The commentary from Sandler and the director is very amusing and informative (we even learn that the movie came very close to getting an &quot;R-rating&quot; due to some of the &quot;crude humor&quot;).  It's a great package for a movie like this.&quot;Anger Management&quot; is a hilarious movie for many reasons.  It is clear that Sandler and Nicholson make an excellent comedic team.  While it may not be the best Sandler movie out there, it is still a great one nonetheless.  Again, this movie is not looking for a place on an AFI list of great movies or anything like that.  It is what it is; a comedy.  If you're looking for a movie that could change the world... you may want to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a fun movie that's amusing and entertaining, this may be the one for you to pick.

A very hard thing to do you might think, but director Peter Segal and writer David Dorfman manage just that!! A success of the wrong kind!So much expectations and most importantly potential, with so little return, proving yet again that in order for a movie, even one starring the great Nicholson,to succeed,it has to have an equally talented writer, director and production team.Having said that, it is not a bad movie per se,and there are just very few scenes that are funny, but these are very far and few in between  and do not make one whole movie.I think the script is the main culprit! An over the top Nicholson (playing the eccentric but wise mentor who changes the life of his protege, a character often seen in cinema), an annoyingly calm Sandler(even his rare outbursts are somehow not convincing), the character of Turturro who comes out as  more aggressive and unstable than angry(I was wondering this man should have been locked up ages ago !!).The only bright spot in the film was Luiz Guzman who is always excellent and adds a lot to his roles,and of course the pairing of Krista Allen and January Jones as two porn stars/lovers who kiss in the middle of the anger management session (I was thinking this alone is capable of turning the angriest of men to sweet little puppies!), but even this scene was unnecessary and you really feel it does not belong to the movie!So Anger Management is a lifeless, humourless and  colourless film that missed a big opportunity to take advantage of this wealth of talent attached to it.",2,Success of the Wrong  Kind,1066348800,"10 17, 2003",2003,1788,"['How', 'do', 'manage', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Luiz', 'Guzman', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'cameos', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'ex', 'NY', 'mayor', 'Rudi', 'Guiliani', 'still', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'mediocre', 'best', 'very', 'hard', 'thing', 'do', 'might', 'think', 'director', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'writer', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'manage', 'just', 'success', 'wrong', 'kind', 'So', 'much', 'expectations', 'most', 'importantly', 'potential', 'so', 'little', 'return', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'order', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'starring', 'great', 'Nicholson', 'succeed', 'have', 'equally', 'talented', 'writer', 'director', 'production', 'team.Having', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'se', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'very', 'far', 'few', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'whole', 'movie.I', 'think', 'script', 'main', 'culprit', 'top', 'Nicholson', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'wise', 'mentor', 'who', 'life', 'protege', 'character', 'often', 'seen', 'cinema', 'annoyingly', 'calm', 'Sandler', 'even', 'rare', 'outbursts', 'are', 'somehow', 'not', 'convincing', 'character', 'Turturro', 'who', 'out', 'more', 'aggressive', 'unstable', 'angry', 'was', 'wondering', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'ages', 'ago', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'was', 'Luiz', 'Guzman', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'lot', 'roles', 'course', 'pairing', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'January', 'Jones', 'two', 'porn', 'stars/lovers', 'who', 'kiss', 'middle', 'anger', 'management', 'session', 'was', 'thinking', 'alone', 'capable', 'turning', 'angriest', 'men', 'sweet', 'little', 'puppies', 'even', 'scene', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'really', 'feel', 'not', 'belong', 'movie', 'So', 'Anger', 'Management', 'lifeless', 'humourless', 'colourless', 'film', 'missed', 'big', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'wealth', 'talent', 'attached']",Anger Management

I suppose my problem is that I don't try to analyze and dissect a movie, by separately examining the various components of the movie. I deal in the big picture. Did I enjoy the movie and to what extent did I enjoy it?In the case of Anger Management, while not a rolling in the isles funny movie, I found it to be a clever, well written, well directed, well acted and quite funny, which is the purpose of the movie.PlotThe story starts out where a bully, thoroughly embarrasses an unsuspecting, young(12 years) David Buznik (later played by Adam Sandler)by pulling down his pants in public as he is about to kiss a young attractive girl.Fast forward twenty-five years and a timid, unassertive Dave is now a secretary (Sandler gets all the good parts)whose immediate supervisor (Kurt Fuller) is .... a bully.While flying to St. Louis on a business trip, Dave, trying innocently to get headphones from a flight attendant, incredulously gets arrested for assault.To his and his flaky lawyers astonishment, Dave is found guilty, fined $3,500 and ordered to undergo two weeks of anger management.Enter the wacky and witty Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), as Dave's anger consoler, who seems to have Dave perform one crazy, illogical thing after another, including matching him up with a volatile, psychotic, member of the therapy group, Chuck (John Turturo)as an anger partner. This partnership shortly leads to Dave again going before the judge after an agitated Chuck starts a fight in a bar and Dave gets dragged in.The Judge sentences Dave to one year in jail or 30 days intensive, hands on therapy, which, to Daves surprise, involves Buddy, moving in and going to work with him.It is at this point that Buddy first notices a later meets Dave's girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) and seems to develop a unhealthy interest in her, which in turn, seems to lead him to perpetrate even stranger and more eratic treatments upon Dave, such as taking him to meet a German transvestite hooker (Woody Harrelson) and forcing him to accost a beautiful girl (Heather Graham)in a bar, with some off the wall line, which to Dave's surprise works.ConclusionThe movie was well directed by Peter Segal and overall the cast did a good job of acting, however, I thought John Turturo did an exceptional job of playing the on the edge, psycho (maybe he don't have to act) and Nicholson was brilliant with that Devilish, devious look of his.

Their personalities go great together and really fit the story. And believe it or not, there's not just great acting, but a great script too. Hilarious scenes and jokes are overflowing throughout the movie with charm and classic fun. While it does have a romance back-plot, don't worry about it teetering between genres -- this one is a knee-slapping comedy all the way. And with some great supporting actors and actresses such as John Turturro, Luis Guzman, Marisa Tomei, Allen Covert, and Woody Harrelson, it's the perfect blend of talent and comfortable atmosphere to make Anger Management a keeper.Not only is the film itself a great buy, but the DVD is packed with all sorts of goodies including feature-length commentary by Sandler and director Peter Segal, deleted scenes, ""My Buddy, Jack"" featurette, an anger survey game to see whether or not you have problems of your own, a making-of featurette, and a hilarious blooper real. Couple that with crystal-clear audio and picture and you've got an amazing deal.As for this particular viewer, not very many comedies I see in theatres or through rentals make me think ""Hey, this is something I need to own"", but Anger Management is one of them. With Jack's funniest, whackiest side shining through and the obvious comical chemistry between the cast, it's no wonder why this won over my heart.

Since the ending is a surprise, when I watched it again I saw the whole storyline in a different light.  I actually found myself watching it several more times to catch more and more of the layers and details.As annoying as Nicholson was in this movie, one cannot take his character [Buddy Rydel] at face value.  When you consider the ending and go back over all his dialogue, you begin to see that he was very up front and truthful about most everything he told Dave (Sandler).  I later became convinced of the sincerity of Buddy (Nicholson) in other situations--like provoking Dave with Galaxia.  If you watch this movie more than once you put on different lenses and see from a different vantage point.I agree with other reviewers--the first viewing may have you despising Nicholson and giving a thumbs down to the film.  I did at first.  Now it grew on me to be one of my favorites..One of my favorite characters in this movie was Chuck.  I love his wild looks, and many of his lines are my favorites... ""no more fudgicles"" and ""you're not ready"" - the Granada stuff, etc.WAs Buddy just being outrageously disgusting and perverse when he flipped off rival ""Linda's best friend"" ...? - I think not.  If you watch the film with a different paradigm, you can see that Buddy was truly doing ""his work"", and that included not only protecting Dave (Sandler), but having the innate manly ability to discern an enemy to Sandler and ""the cause"" he's undertaken to help.There are even a couple of times when Nicholson is even impressed with how his student [Sandler] fared during the process...in my opinion when he brought ""the girls"" to the club (strong move) and also when he dealt with his childhood nemesis who had become a monk.  That has to be the funniest scene in the movie!If you have ever known a nice guy with implosive anger, this will really strike a chord.  If you have ever sat in a group counseling session (like 12 step), then you will laugh noddingly.Anger Management.  At first I didn't like it.  Watched it some more, and I'm still seeing new things in it.  I really like it a lot.Jack Nicholson - annoying and dopey OR masterful?

There are many laughs throughout the movie so settle into your easy chair and enjoy.The special features are better than what I've seen on some of the older Sandler movies.

All the while, the love interest of the film, played by Marisa Tomei, stands on the sidelines, questioning the nature of her relationship with Sandler.

But even his presence isn't enough to prevent ""Anger Management"" from emerging as a decidedly unfunny comedy, one that ends up wasting the talents of Adam Sandler, Marisa Tomei, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Luis Guzman as well.The David Dorfman screenplay is yet another of those ""high concept"" package deals - replete with contrived plots and big-name movie stars in the leads - that look irresistible to all those corporate green-lighters at the studio, but which fall to pieces the moment they come to fruition on the big screen.  Sandler plays a mild-mannered, put-upon schnook who is unfairly and inexplicably convicted of assaulting a stewardess on an airplane.  Much to Sandler's chagrin, the court consigns him to the care of Nicholson, a well-known anger management specialist who is more certifiably psychotic than the patients he is ostensibly helping.  The strained, manufactured plot is little more than an excuse to give Nicholson a chance to chew the scenery and Sandler to act bemused, befuddled and benumbed.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much how the audience feels after 106 minutes of nonstop crudity, predictability and over-the-top ranting.  Director Peter Segal tries desperately to make the whole enterprise come across as madcap, witty and anarchic, but with virtually every single joke and set-up fizzling and sputtering out, the film ends up feeling merely chaotic and desperate.The filmmakers have peppered their movie with any number of cameo appearances by some famous real life New Yorkers, but their performances are so thoroughly inept and wretched that ""Anger Management"" begins to feel more like amateur night at the Roxy than a multimillion-dollar Hollywood production.  This is most acutely felt in the painfully awkward and embarrassingly mawkish climactic moments played out, stereotypically, before a packed house at Yankee Stadium (didn't we see this scene a few years back in ""Never Been Kissed""?).  Moreover, the ""surprise"" ending requires that we suspend disbelief more than is advisable even for a film of this nature, which could never expect us to believe for a fleeting moment anything that is going on here.In what is a bizarre fluke of fate, I suppose, ""Anger Management"" turns out to be the second film in recent months to feature characters massacring and mangling the Bernstein and Sondheim song ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story.""  What I said about this phenomenon in my review of ""Analyze That"" holds true here as well:  that filmmakers with a dubious movie on their hands should avoid reminding us of a much better film while we are being asked to suffer through theirs.

Not a guy who loses his temper, Dave nevertheless is a walking time-bomb of repressed rage.  Whether a childhood target for bullies or simply one of those men who joins the long-gray line of beaten-down adulthood, Dave is essentially an android who never says or otherwise expresses what's on his mind.  As an adult, he works for a company that sells expensive pet supplies for the moneyed pet owners (his big idea involves weight-concealing clothes for obese cats).  His one bright spot is Linda (Marisa Tomei).  Coming from a better background, and chafing against Dave's inability to show affection (or anything else) Linda's feelings for Dave are a miracle.On the verge of losing out on a promising new position, and while enroute to a business meeting in St Louis, Dave is arrested for ""air rage"" (the flick opened about 18 months after 9/11, and feels that the heightened sensitivities of airline workers is now stand-up material).  Convicted of assaulting a flight attendant (don't ask), Dave is sentenced to anger management classes.  Unfortunately, his counselor is Buddy Rydell, a cheerful psychotic specialist in anger management played by Jack Nicholson.  Overflowing with bromides on rage control (""Temper's the one thing you can't get rid of, by losing it""), Buddy is a bit of a ticking bomb himself.  At first grouped with Buddy's other rage-challenged clients (including John Turtorro as an army vet suffering post-traumatic stress from Grenada), Dave is sentenced to a more intense regimen once he gets waylaid on another disastrous encounter in a bar (don't ask!)  Now forced to endure Buddy everywhere he goes, Dave must re-examine his life on a daily basis and confront every possible source of his anger - childhood bullies now grown, his abusive boss, his sexual insecurities (the film has a recurring obsession with male anatomy) and his fear of losing Linda.""Anger Management"" has its share of surprises, but not many.  It's the latest in a long-line of movies starring Sandler as a hopeless loser who must undergo a painful or embarrassing transformation if he's to find love.  Nicholson and Sandler work together better than the script deserves, and the flick works a fine line without having them become great friends or enemies at each others throats.

It's a tale for those of us who can't resist the temptation of giving the ""middle finger"" to the person next to them while driving, being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic; It's about guys who get [angry] real easily, when they find-out their girlfriends are cheating on them behind their back; and to the guys who can't seem to manage to put the toilet seat down (you know who you are: your girlfriends/wives nagging you to put it down); and those of us who like to ""sweat-the-small-stuff,"" fighting over the remote control and the thermostat. Hey guys, I've got news for you: you can be like the rest of us single men out there, who don't have to deal with the incessant whining of ....... women who always have to have things their way, who are always having you be there at their beckon-call every waking-hour. Don't you hate it when your significant-other insists that you stay home to watch a sappy, romantic chick-flick (or another dull episode of ""Gilmore Girls"") instead of ""kickin' it"" with your buddies, to seeing the Tampa Bay Buccanneers kick the Oakland Raider's....? Doesn't it make you mad, when you're having to draw straws to seeing whose turn it is to cleaning the garage?  Sure it does. It's not the end of the world, it's just that life can be unfair sometimes. We all have to go through the same thing - at one time or another. If you're a couple of highbrows with nothing better to do than to reading the latest Harry Potter book, while laying down on the sofa with your legs getting numb - because God forbid - you can't seem to put the darn thing down, then this is the movie for you. So get off the couch and stretch those legs, so you can go over to Blockbuster to pick this movie up. It's hilarious! If you're old enough to remembering an old classic like ""West Side Story"" you will get plenty of laughs with this. You'll find yourself wondering: why am I watching this? Why is my wife making me see this movie? It's so you can realize all the good that life has to offer, instead of being mad all the time. So don't take my word for it.

The therapist is Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), who the audience soon discovers is an egomaniac with issues of his own. There are wonderful cameos by several members of the therapy group, and Marisa Tomei is charming as Linda, Dave's long suffering girlfriend who is continually trying to improve his self esteem. We even have Rudy Guiliani and several members of the New York Yankees in crucial roles as guest stars.This movie has some truly hilarious moments, really comedic incidents and unexpected developments to keep the theatergoer interested. The idea was quite clever, and the cast is talented enough to pull it off. But neither the script or the direction lived up to the idea's promise. It had the potential to be five stars, but only rated as high as three stars because of the truly enjoyable last half hour and the very clever and quite cute surprise ending.Why was I so disappointed? The beginning was very contrived, and a lot of the supposedly funny situations early in the film were quite strained and unbelievable. Nicholson is superb within the limits of the script, and carries the early part of the movie with Sandler as his straight man. It also moved slowly on occasion, a serious problem for a comedy. Most disappointingly, a story with this much comic potential did not need the continued attempts at humor through sexual innuendo, crude jokes and generally off color material that occasionally was truly humorous but just as often contributed nothing of substance to the story and at times actually detracted from it. It seemed as if the scriptwriters often decided that it was easier to go for cheap laughs than make the effort to be really funny.So, if you like the stars of this film and want to laugh without having to exert any effort having to think deeply for a few hours, you will find this film a satisfactory diversion and will leave the theater smiling and feeling good about the conclusion and the truly funny sequences that did occur. But if your expectations are high and you want to think as well as laugh, then see BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM instead.

Besides, the plot takes a backseat in this movie and though most of the time it is a story that drives a film, that isn't the case here. The reason most people will be going to watch this movie (and the reason you should too) is the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler together in a comedy.  Sandler, like he does in just about every other movie he has ever made, pretty much plays himself; the soft-spoken, mild-mannered man who is seething with a biting sarcasm and fiery anger underneath. Nicholson, on the other hand, gets to do something he hasn't been allowed to do very often in the past:  he gets to use his famous maniac energy and use it full force in a comedy. The results are hilarious. Though the movie looks like a bunch of loose sketches stiched together with a few scenes added in and an ending that resembles something out of CANDID CAMERA or the movie THE GAME, those stiched-together sketches with Nicholoson and Sandler are priceless. Especially funny are the scene of them singing ""I Feel Pretty"" in a stopped car on a busy New York bridge and the scene with John C. Reilly at a Buddhast monastary. Overall though the movie isn't all that great, it is more than worth the price of admission just to see Nicholson and Sandler paired off together.

612917,A1ZR196DOFT366,B00005JM4Q,Tyler Bond,"[0, 0]","Movie Review:Anger ManagementRelease Date: April 11, 2003Notable Actors: Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa TomeiDirector: Peter SegalAfter a misunderstanding on a plane Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is ordered by the court to attend anger management classes taught by Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). Dave tries to get out of the class until an incident at a bar, which involved a broken nose of a waitress, put him in Dr. Rydell&#8217;s intensive anger management program. Dr. Rydell has a more unorthodox way of doing things, and it is throwing Dave&#8217;s life into chaos. However, maybe Dr. Rydell is the only one that can save Dave from a problem that everyone else sees except of Dave.It seems like Dave just can&#8217;t get a break. He has a gorgeous girlfriend who he is on the verge of losing. Dave&#8217;s boss takes credit for all of his work and ideas he comes up with. Now after a misunderstanding on a flight, he is put in the hands of Dr. Rydell (who by the way is crazy!). Overall I thought this movie was more of a funny/serious one. There were parts that you got a snicker out of and other parts where you actually felt bad for Dave, because he hasn&#8217;t really done anything. One scene that comes to mind is the beginning plane scene. Dave just ask the flight attendant a question and next thing you know Dave is accused of assault and management problems from something he did not do.Adam Sandler v. Jack Nicholson. These actors were going back and forth with each other the entire movie, which made it funny. Both actors have proven themselves in previous movies and it showed in this particular one. However, it seems as if Adam Sandler plays the same role or the same type of person in his movies. If you seen one Adam Sandler movie you pretty much have seen them all. Jack Nicholson on the other hand brings something different in his characters that he plays. With that being said I believe Anger Management was not a Jack Nicholson movie.

612919,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JM4Q,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 2]","This sounded so promising. Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler both have enough anxiety and quirks built around their personnas to make a rich, satisfying comedy. If Anger Management falls a bit flat, it's more to do with the uneven screenplay and direction than the performers. Both Sandler and Nicholson give solid comedic performances. Although Nicholson coasts on his personality here playing a variation on characters he's played before, Sandler actually stretches a bit in his role. It's nothing compared to the stretch we saw in the dark comedy/drama Punch Drunk Love, but it's a step up from The Waterboy.The plot in a nutshell--Sandler plays an executive assistant at a firm that designs clothing for fat cats. He's always had a problem with intimacy since a bully pulled down his shorts while he shared his first kiss. As a result, he's also quiet and not very aggressive about going after what he wants. While on a flight he asks for a headset from a flight attendant. He asks several times, is assured he'll get it, only to be ignored. When he asks one final time (quite calmly) the flight attendant accuses him of being out of control and verbally abusive. A Marshall becomes involved and puts him under arrest. He's sentenced to an anger management course and fined as a result. The only problem--the doctor running the anger management course appears to nuts and having issues with anger himself. At one point he moves in with Sandler's character and forces him to proposition a complete stranger (even though Sandler's character has a girlfriend), partner with a psychotic as part of his buddy system and and confront his weasel of a boss. Ultimately, he does control his anger but learns to stand up for himself.Some of the cameos are inspired while others fall completely flat. The most bizarre is, perhaps, Woody Harrelson's performance in drag. The feel good happy ending kinda comes out of nowhere and undercuts the dark comedy elements that do work well here (particularly the encounter with a bully that used to pick on Sandler's character who is now--surprise--a Buddist Monk (played by the talented John C. Rilley).The DVD looks very good and the sound is up to the high standards we've come to expect from DVDs. The extras are a what we've come to expect  and, while the outtakes aren't as gut splittingly funny as one would hope, there are a couple of chuckles to be found. The featurettes are a bit quirky if, again, predictable.Although Anger Management doesn't live up to its potential (which is a pity but that's no surprise given the way the script and film was probably compromised by the egos of the actors involved), it has a number of truly funny moments. The film is at its best when it's unpredictable. Unfortunately, most of the film falls into a rut. It's like laying eyes on a new rollercoaster that looks unusual; you find that while it looks pretty good once you ride it the twists and turns are pretty familiar. The ride's still enjoyable even if it is predictable.",3,Entertaining comedy from the anxiety twins,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,3005,"['sounded', 'so', 'promising', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'have', 'enough', 'anxiety', 'quirks', 'built', 'personnas', 'make', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'comedy', 'Anger', 'Management', 'bit', 'flat', 'more', 'do', 'uneven', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'performers', 'Sandler', 'Nicholson', 'give', 'solid', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Nicholson', 'coasts', 'personality', 'here', 'playing', 'variation', 'characters', 'played', 'Sandler', 'actually', 'bit', 'role', 'nothing', 'compared', 'stretch', 'saw', 'dark', 'comedy/drama', 'Punch', 'Drunk', 'Love', 'step', 'up', 'Waterboy.The', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'Sandler', 'executive', 'assistant', 'firm', 'clothing', 'fat', 'cats', 'always', 'had', 'problem', 'intimacy', 'bully', 'pulled', 'down', 'shorts', 'shared', 'first', 'kiss', 'result', 'also', 'quiet', 'not', 'very', 'aggressive', 'going', 'what', 'flight', 'headset', 'flight', 'attendant', 'several', 'times', 'assured', ""'ll"", 'get', 'only', 'be', 'ignored', 'When', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'quite', 'calmly', 'flight', 'attendant', 'being', 'control', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'Marshall', 'becomes', 'involved', 'arrest', 'sentenced', 'anger', 'management', 'course', 'fined', 'result', 'only', 'problem', 'doctor', 'running', 'anger', 'management', 'course', 'nuts', 'having', 'issues', 'anger', 'one', 'point', 'Sandler', 'character', 'forces', 'proposition', 'complete', 'stranger', 'even', 'Sandler', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'partner', 'psychotic', 'part', 'buddy', 'system', 'confront', 'weasel', 'boss', 'Ultimately', 'control', 'anger', 'stand', 'up', 'himself.Some', 'cameos', 'are', 'inspired', 'others', 'fall', 'completely', 'flat', 'most', 'bizarre', 'perhaps', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'performance', 'drag', 'feel', 'good', 'happy', 'ending', 'kinda', 'nowhere', 'dark', 'comedy', 'elements', 'do', 'work', 'well', 'here', 'particularly', 'encounter', 'bully', 'used', 'pick', 'Sandler', 'character', 'who', 'now', 'surprise', 'Buddist', 'Monk', 'played', 'talented', 'John', 'C.', 'Rilley', '.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'high', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'DVDs', 'extras', 'are', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'outtakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'gut', 'splittingly', 'funny', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'are', 'couple', 'chuckles', 'be', 'found', 'featurettes', 'are', 'bit', 'quirky', 'again', 'Anger', 'Management', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'pity', 'surprise', 'given', 'way', 'script', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'compromised', 'egos', 'actors', 'involved', 'number', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'unpredictable', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'film', 'rut', 'laying', 'eyes', 'new', 'rollercoaster', 'unusual', 'find', 'pretty', 'good', 'once', 'ride', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'ride', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'predictable']",Anger Management
612920,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JM4Q,wellwellwell,"[2, 4]","Although the duo of Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson may be one of the oddest, most intriguing duos since `Meet The Parents' gave us Stiller and De Niro, this particular comedy doesn't reveal itself as anything more than your average comedy; and your average Adam Sandler movie.  But the appearances by Nicholson and the long list of cameos and Sandler-movie regulars make it worth your time.  And money.  Overall the movie featured some hilarious bits of comedy and a few surprises, but everything else in between is nothing we haven't seen before.  In comparing Sandler's earlier work, this would probably be a combination of `Happy Gilmore' and `Mr. Deeds'.  Do with that what you will.  You probably know a little about the storyline by now, but for the amateur, here's an overview:Adam Sandler plays the role of Dave, just your average worker.  In the previews, you saw how Sandler was put into anger management; the movie offers nothing too different.  And the way it happens (at first glance) is both ill-advised and stupid.  Once he is sentenced (that's a fitting word) to this ""group"", he gets to know the character of Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson).  Rydell's abnormal and zany healing habits offer for most of the movie's brighter spots; as it seems Buddy himself could use some quote-unquote: anger management.  As I said, there is a long list of cameos and regulars that appear.  Among those featured are New York Yankee superstars Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens, John C. Reilly (`Magnolia', `The Perfect Storm'), Heather Graham, John McEnroe (who was also in `Mr. Deeds'), John Turturro, and Woody Harrelson in an appearance worth the price alone.  I won't spoil it for you.  I could've kept going with that list but it would become too long to handle; there`s many, many more.  I won't spoil those for you either.  As you can probably imagine, the plot is pretty simple.  As with many other Sandler films (though not Nicholson's), the story becomes slow and does not hold the attention of [us] as well as it should.  But before you discard the movie, know that (lord behold) Jack Nicholson saves the day.  He brings some good twists to the screen with his character and that may overshadow the fact the movie is rather basic. If you're a Nicholson fan you'll probably like this film.  On the other hand, if you're a Sandler fan you'll probably be a bit disappointed with it.  Only if you are a die-hard fan will you really love it.Regardless of the poor script, average acting and typical humor, `Anger Management' does mange to entertain.  Everyone in the theatre was laughing and seemed to be enjoying the film.  If you pay to see this movie you will almost certainly end up laughing and remembering a few choice sequences.  But over time, the movie will probably do nothing more than be a theatrical blockbuster.  So if you want to help add to the success of a somewhat-hilarious, everyday comedy with some intriguing/well-known actors, then do see this.  But if you're looking for a movie that will change your life or persuade you to view it again, you won't find it here.  I recommend you watch this movie if you enjoy Adam Sandler and the type of comedy his movies possess.  Because if you don't, you might walk away frustrated with your head down.",3,Your average Sandler; with Nicholson twist,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,3266,"['duo', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'oddest', 'most', 'intriguing', 'duos', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'gave', 'Stiller', 'De', 'Niro', 'particular', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'more', 'average', 'comedy', 'average', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'appearances', 'Nicholson', 'long', 'list', 'cameos', 'Sandler-movie', 'regulars', 'make', 'time', 'money', 'movie', 'featured', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'comedy', 'few', 'surprises', 'everything', 'else', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'comparing', 'Sandler', 'earlier', 'work', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'combination', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Do', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'know', 'little', 'storyline', 'now', 'amateur', 'here', 'overview', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'role', 'Dave', 'just', 'average', 'worker', 'previews', 'saw', 'how', 'Sandler', 'was', 'put', 'anger', 'management', 'movie', 'nothing', 'too', 'different', 'way', 'first', 'glance', 'ill-advised', 'stupid', 'sentenced', 'fitting', 'word', 'group', 'know', 'character', 'Dr', 'Buddy', 'Rydell', 'Nicholson', 'Rydell', 'abnormal', 'zany', 'healing', 'habits', 'offer', 'most', 'movie', 'brighter', 'spots', 'Buddy', 'could', 'use', 'quote-unquote', 'anger', 'management', 'said', 'long', 'list', 'cameos', 'regulars', 'appear', 'featured', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'Yankee', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Magnolia', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'appearance', 'price', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'could', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'going', 'list', 'would', 'become', 'too', 'long', 'handle', 's', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'either', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'many', 'other', 'Sandler', 'films', 'not', 'Nicholson', 'story', 'slow', 'not', 'hold', 'attention', '[', ']', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'discard', 'movie', 'know', 'lord', 'behold', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'day', 'good', 'twists', 'screen', 'character', 'may', 'overshadow', 'fact', 'movie', 'rather', 'basic', ""'re"", 'Nicholson', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'film', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'Sandler', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Only', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'will', 'really', 'love', 'it.Regardless', 'poor', 'script', 'average', 'acting', 'typical', 'humor', 'Anger', 'Management', 'mange', 'entertain', 'Everyone', 'theatre', 'was', 'laughing', 'seemed', 'be', 'enjoying', 'film', 'pay', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'remembering', 'few', 'choice', 'sequences', 'time', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'theatrical', 'blockbuster', 'So', 'want', 'help', 'add', 'success', 'somewhat-hilarious', 'everyday', 'comedy', 'intriguing/well-known', 'actors', 'then', 'do', 'see', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'persuade', 'view', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'recommend', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'type', 'comedy', 'movies', 'possess', 'do', ""n't"", 'might', 'walk', 'away', 'frustrated', 'head', 'down']",Anger Management
612921,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JM4Q,William Hare,"[2, 3]","Jack Nicholson is a rebel with humor and feeling, someone delightfully unpredictable.  Who can forget him with a zany grin on his face playing a writer over the edge in Stephen King's ""The Shining"" and the great Stanley Kubrick as director, when he says ""Here's Johnny!""Nicholson, one of our greatest actors to come out of the Vietnam Era, is in hilariously outrageous form as a psychotherapist in ""Anger Management"".  He hooks up early with Adam Sandler, who promptly becomes his protege under tenuous circumstances.  A mild mannered executive secretary, overqualified and underacknowledged due to a laid back manner, he has his girlfriend, played by Adrian Ricard, constantly fretting, seeking to give him some kind of push to propel him forward in New York City's fast paced world.  Meanwhile Nicholson is determined to change his attitude and direction in life, to provide the necessary spark to give Sandler that necessary change in attitude.Nicholson enters the scene when Sandler, through strangely escalating circumstances, is attacked by an angry flight security guard aboard a flight after a verbal altercation with a female flight attendant with ultimate legal consequences.  A New York judge places Sandler under the care of Nicholson, a psychotherapist with decidedly unconventional methods, as manifested by the many outstanding lawsuits against him.  Soon, through equally implausible circumstances, Sandler is involved in a barroom brawl.  The judge assigns Nicholson to treat patient Sandler around the clock, with the patient moving into the psychiatrist's apartment.As the relationship develops one wonders whether Nicholson is helping Sandler or leading him to his ruination.  Nicholson keeps telling his patient that if he bears with him positive results will be obtained.  In one instance he tells his shy patient to make a move on an attractive young woman in a Boston bar by delivering a line Sandler is certain will bring a slapping rebuke.  Instead the woman invites Sandler to her waterfront apartment with wildly unpredictable results.  In another instance Nicholson suggests that his client address an old grievance as Sandler has it out with the man who bullied him when they were schoolmates.  The former bully is now a monk in a Buddhist monastery.  After the fight therapist and patient bearly escape with a monastery full of monks chasing them.Director Peter Segal uses the right approach, giving Nicholson plenty of latitude to launch his unique pyrotechnics display.  As the script by David Dorfman continues unfolding curiosity heightens as to just what Nicholson is trying to prove.  Just as Sandler has worked up enough nerve to propose to Ricard, Nicholson appears to enter the scene.  The comedy has a mystery film finale with laughs as the story concludes in Yankee Stadium, where either Nicholson or Sandler is set to pop the question to the lovely Ricard.  Just what is happening?  Is Nicholson a heartless turncoat seeking to break his patient's heart through treachery?  Stay tuned.  The finale is fascinating, with Yankee stars Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens delivering lines, making their impact as well, along with the thousands of fans watching the unfolding romantic spectacle in the Bronx.",3,"Once More With Feeling, Nicholson the Wild Rebel",1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,3240,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'rebel', 'humor', 'feeling', 'someone', 'delightfully', 'unpredictable', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'zany', 'grin', 'face', 'playing', 'writer', 'edge', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Shining', 'great', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'director', 'when', 'Here', 'Johnny', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'come', 'Vietnam', 'Era', 'hilariously', 'outrageous', 'form', 'psychotherapist', 'Anger', 'Management', 'up', 'early', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'promptly', 'protege', 'tenuous', 'circumstances', 'mild', 'mannered', 'executive', 'secretary', 'overqualified', 'underacknowledged', 'due', 'laid', 'back', 'manner', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Ricard', 'constantly', 'fretting', 'seeking', 'give', 'kind', 'push', 'propel', 'forward', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fast', 'paced', 'world', 'Meanwhile', 'Nicholson', 'determined', 'change', 'attitude', 'direction', 'life', 'provide', 'necessary', 'spark', 'give', 'Sandler', 'necessary', 'change', 'attitude.Nicholson', 'enters', 'scene', 'when', 'Sandler', 'strangely', 'escalating', 'circumstances', 'attacked', 'angry', 'flight', 'security', 'guard', 'flight', 'verbal', 'altercation', 'female', 'flight', 'attendant', 'ultimate', 'legal', 'consequences', 'New', 'York', 'judge', 'places', 'Sandler', 'care', 'Nicholson', 'psychotherapist', 'decidedly', 'unconventional', 'methods', 'manifested', 'many', 'outstanding', 'lawsuits', 'Soon', 'equally', 'implausible', 'circumstances', 'Sandler', 'involved', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'judge', 'Nicholson', 'treat', 'patient', 'Sandler', 'clock', 'patient', 'moving', 'psychiatrist', 'relationship', 'one', 'Nicholson', 'helping', 'Sandler', 'leading', 'ruination', 'Nicholson', 'telling', 'patient', 'positive', 'results', 'will', 'be', 'obtained', 'one', 'instance', 'shy', 'patient', 'make', 'move', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'Boston', 'bar', 'delivering', 'line', 'Sandler', 'certain', 'will', 'bring', 'slapping', 'rebuke', 'Instead', 'woman', 'Sandler', 'waterfront', 'apartment', 'wildly', 'unpredictable', 'results', 'instance', 'Nicholson', 'client', 'address', 'old', 'grievance', 'Sandler', 'out', 'man', 'who', 'bullied', 'when', 'were', 'schoolmates', 'former', 'bully', 'now', 'monk', 'Buddhist', 'monastery', 'fight', 'therapist', 'patient', 'bearly', 'escape', 'monastery', 'full', 'monks', 'chasing', 'them.Director', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'right', 'approach', 'giving', 'Nicholson', 'plenty', 'latitude', 'launch', 'unique', 'pyrotechnics', 'display', 'script', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'unfolding', 'curiosity', 'just', 'what', 'Nicholson', 'trying', 'prove', 'Just', 'Sandler', 'worked', 'up', 'enough', 'nerve', 'propose', 'Ricard', 'Nicholson', 'enter', 'scene', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'film', 'finale', 'laughs', 'story', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'where', 'Nicholson', 'Sandler', 'set', 'pop', 'question', 'lovely', 'Ricard', 'Just', 'what', 'happening', 'Nicholson', 'heartless', 'turncoat', 'seeking', 'break', 'patient', 'heart', 'treachery', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'finale', 'fascinating', 'Yankee', 'stars', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'Roger', 'Clemens', 'delivering', 'lines', 'making', 'impact', 'well', 'thousands', 'fans', 'watching', 'unfolding', 'romantic', 'spectacle', 'Bronx']",Anger Management

In the case of ""Anger Management"", director Peter Segal tries to weave some semblance of emotion into the ridiculous plot of his film...and fails miserably in the effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Anger Management"" sees young, mild-mannered businessman David Buznik (Adam Sandler) being treated as the company peon despite all his hard work and career aspirations.  With some prodding from girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) and a series of crazy events, Buznik begins seeing Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an anger management therapist specializing in some rather unorthodox ""treatments"".The main problem with this movie is that one must simply face facts: it just isn't all that funny.  Sandler makes a couple of his trademark wisecracks that might elicit a chuckle here and there, but Nicholson is completely wasted in a terribly annoying role.  For being billed as a ""comedy"", the laughs are few and far between.What makes it a truly abysmal effort, though, is the fact that the producers had the gall to try and make it ""mean something"" towards the end.  A movie this ridiculous (with characters so over-the-top as to be almost cartoonish at times) in premise cannot make the sudden switch to emotional without coming off as laughable (exactly what happens here).Overall, ""Anger Management"" was one of the most disappointing films I've seen in quite awhile.
