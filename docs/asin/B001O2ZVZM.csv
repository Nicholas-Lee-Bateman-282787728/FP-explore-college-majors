Lovecraft gets more than she bargained for.This presentation was probably meant to be a Halloween quickie of the ""Blair Witch"" type.  Unfortunately it falls cinematically short just about anything that you might have seen; it has bad camera work, bad actors, bad acting, bad dialogue, how many bads can something have.It is even a pity that Lovecraft Followers could not even appreciate this movie.

1221633,A79P3AW4RBULS,B001O2ZVZM,Jenny Sequois,"[1, 2]","I was never a huge fan of Lovecraft.  I always considered his style to be overwrought, even given the subject material.  Nevertheless, he had an interesting take on the horror genre and I'm glad I took the time to read the things of his that I did.There have been relatively few film adaptations of his work and so whenever one surfaces I try to check it out.  Up to now, that approach has stood me in relatively good stead.  Dagon's a fine little scare picture, and the recently done ""Call of C"" was so quirky as to be quite entertaining.This movie, on the other hand, sucks.  I regret descending to that level of of descriptive language, but no other word really seems to fit correctly.  The sets suck.  The acting sucks.  The cinematography sucks.  The script sucks.  The direction sucks.  The only suckitude I'm uncertain of is that of the end credits because I couldn't force myself to sit through the entire disaster.I kept thinking that the opening scenes were some sort of gag reel and that the movie would transition to something worthwhile. That didn't happen.This is one of the very few full length features I've seen where I quit watching halfway through, convinced that I could have done a better job with the same budget, which obviously was abysmally inadequate for a film of this length.Sorry to those involved in the project to be so negative, but this one should never have been released.

1221634,A16AFEPT3H8KNX,B001O2ZVZM,"John Oconnor ""Wrong Reverend Pope John the Me...","[17, 17]","Most new Lovecraft inspired movies don't adhere to the accepted ""canon"" created by either Lovecraft and/or Derleth, so I did not expect this film to do so, and I was not disappointed.  It is, however, far closer to the original ""canon"" than the Reanimator films or the Unnameable films.  So, I guess this is a ""true"" modern Lovecraft film.As for the movie itself, it obviously had a rather small budget.  The acting is adequate, but certainly not great.  The lead girl is attractive and competent, but hardly a great actress.  The story does move along slowly, which is much like a Lovecraft story, and the characters discover each new piece of the puzzle much as Lovecraft's characters did in his better stories.  Several times, the dialogue is very stilted, as though the writer is explaining things rather than doing true dialogue.  The actors occasionally seem to fall out of character, too.Still, for all the faults, this is not a terrible film.  It has moments of real Lovecraft feeling.  For the price, it isn't too terribly expensive, either.  If you are a Lovecraft fan, you can certainly do worse than watching this little film.",3,"Not horrible, but bad",1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,1138,"['Most', 'new', 'Lovecraft', 'inspired', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'accepted', 'canon', 'created', 'Lovecraft', 'and/or', 'Derleth', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'however', 'far', 'closer', 'original', 'canon', 'Reanimator', 'films', 'Unnameable', 'films', 'So', 'guess', 'true', 'modern', 'Lovecraft', 'film.As', 'movie', 'obviously', 'had', 'rather', 'small', 'budget', 'acting', 'adequate', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'lead', 'girl', 'attractive', 'competent', 'hardly', 'great', 'actress', 'story', 'move', 'along', 'slowly', 'much', 'Lovecraft', 'story', 'characters', 'discover', 'new', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'much', 'Lovecraft', 'characters', 'did', 'better', 'stories', 'Several', 'times', 'dialogue', 'very', 'stilted', 'writer', 'explaining', 'things', 'rather', 'doing', 'true', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'occasionally', 'seem', 'fall', 'character', 'too.Still', 'faults', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'moments', 'real', 'Lovecraft', 'feeling', 'price', ""n't"", 'too', 'terribly', 'expensive', 'either', 'are', 'Lovecraft', 'fan', 'can', 'certainly', 'do', 'worse', 'watching', 'little', 'film']",In Search of Lovecraft
