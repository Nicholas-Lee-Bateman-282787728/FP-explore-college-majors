The nice thing is the main couple (Heather Marie Marsden & David James Elliott) are good as the typical couple on the cusp of divorce who bicker and fight about there horrible marriage. When the going gets tough and the husband has to pull out all the stops and show us what a real man can do when its life or death and thank god the wife is no wimp and steps up to the pump for a little skull cracken her self. Now do not get me wrong here I was screaming at the screen telling them what to do next and was really into the movie for a good part of the film, so I liked it, but if this is not your type of trash cinema then why even read this, just go back and watch Twatlight one more time.I think if you go to the trouble to make a torture porn film then lets make it a strong Rated R or a unrated movie. You know this is never going to the big screen and you know who your audience is so lets get to it and stop pussy footing around. Michael Madsen has fallen so far and to see his name on a movie now is a sure sign that its a turd. I used to love Michael Madsen and think he does a fine job on this stellar film, it's just a far cry from his glory days of ""Kill Bill"" and such. Back to the movie, I had fun and got my moneys worth for sure. So if Hostel meets Vacancy sounds good then this is your movie.",3,Hostel meets Vacancy,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1391,"['Yes', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'OK', 'nice', 'thing', 'main', 'couple', 'Heather', 'Marie', 'Marsden', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'are', 'good', 'typical', 'couple', 'cusp', 'divorce', 'who', 'bicker', 'fight', 'there', 'horrible', 'marriage', 'When', 'going', 'tough', 'husband', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'show', 'what', 'real', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'life', 'death', 'thank', 'god', 'wife', 'wimp', 'up', 'pump', 'little', 'skull', 'cracken', 'self', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'was', 'screaming', 'screen', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'was', 'really', 'movie', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'liked', 'not', 'type', 'trash', 'cinema', 'then', 'why', 'even', 'read', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'Twatlight', 'one', 'more', 'time.I', 'think', 'go', 'trouble', 'make', 'torture', 'porn', 'film', 'then', 'make', 'strong', 'Rated', 'R', 'unrated', 'movie', 'know', 'never', 'going', 'big', 'screen', 'know', 'who', 'audience', 'so', 'lets', 'get', 'stop', 'pussy', 'footing', 'around', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'fallen', 'so', 'far', 'see', 'name', 'movie', 'now', 'sure', 'sign', 'turd', 'used', 'love', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'think', 'fine', 'job', 'stellar', 'film', 'just', 'far', 'cry', 'glory', 'days', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'such', 'Back', 'movie', 'had', 'fun', 'got', 'moneys', 'worth', 'sure', 'So', 'Hostel', 'Vacancy', 'good', 'then', 'movie']",Terror Trap
1442257,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00555ZSWA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Terror Trap is definitely a low budget horror with a few big name actors, but the plotline is pretty lackluster.  The biggest problem is that it takes forever for the storyline to actually get *moving* so we have to sit through several generic and predictable segments waiting for the storyline to finally get underway.The most offensive example of generic writing comes when the main characters (a man and his wife) are driving in a car on some back road and... you guessed it, behind them pulls up another vehicle shining their excessively bright headlights in their rear view window and blinding them.This leads to a minor accident immediately after... which means the man and his wife are now stranded in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by trees.  Then a ""police officer"" comes to the rescue... only to take them to a hotel that's occupied with vicious residents who are actually completely warped and spend their days watching people in the parking lot and hotel rooms get murdered in graphic fashion.  The people actually have video cameras and televisions hooked up in the backroom and sit around watching the innocent people run for their lives.  How twisted!It takes a LONG time for the storyline to follow through.  Too much useless time is devoted to terribly bland writing and well, basically total fluff that never accomplishes much of anything.However your reward for sitting through all that nothingness is that eventually the residents DO get upset and chase the man and his wife around with knives while wearing masks.  Of course the way they chase them around is more like a bully luring an innocent kid into a dangerous situation- I mean these bad guys most certainly COULD have killed the man and woman if they really wanted to be aggressive enough about it.The cop that drove the man and woman to the hotel turns out to be the one who's the most screwed up in the head, and he's also the biggest threat.Overall, waiting a good 30 minutes for some actual action and excitement to take place is what you can expect.  Once the man and woman find out what kind of vicious people they're dealing with, only then does the film go anywhere at all.  Until that point arrives, expect to be unentertained for a while.  Oh, and someone please PLEASE smack the mans wife for being obnoxious and relentless with the ""F"" word.  It's one thing to not get along with your husband, but a completely other thing to criticize and humiliate him so he feels ""this tall"".

The married couple having problems was very annoying (the unhappy couple was much better in the movie Vacancy) and the wife kept telling people to f-off, which added nothing to her character.  The addition of Michael Madison's character seemed a little pointless as the ""ring leader""...really what was the point?  he was hardly in the film then shows up at the end to kill a henchman who mentioned the ""organization""??  i guess it was suppose to be menacing and lead the audience to know the threat is still out there....yep... the threat of a sequel!!Since it is a rip off of Vacancy and a crappy rip off with annoying characters it gets one star.

The movie tells the story of a bickering couple that wind up in a backwoods motel, where they are terrorized by sadistic men as their ordeal is caught on camera for others.The movie is painfully unoriginal, filled with tedious dialogue, and is riddled with plot holes.  Michael Madsen, easily the best-known actors in the film, phones in his performance for an easy check.  Jeff Fahey turns up the volume on his performance as one of the film's bad guys, but neither his performance nor Madsen's are enough to salvage the movie.Once in a while, I discover a hidden gem amongst low-budget horror flicks that go straight to video. Terror Trap is not one of them.  It's not worth a rental, so I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD.

What seemed like potential for a very frightening film turned out to be another cheap knockoff of many horror films.

You have an argumentative husband and wife whose road trip land them in trouble.Out of respect for potential viewers and because I am trying my best to forget I've seen any of this movie, I will leave my review here. This film has a bunch of ridiculous surprises and you just have to watch the film (if you can) to catch them. It tries to be suspenseful but falls short.As for the actors, sigh. I used to be such a big Michael Madsen fan but he hasn't been in a decent film since The Getaway in '93! It's sad to see an actor of his caliber drift further and further into B-movie land but too late. Same for Jeff Fahey. I always enjoyed him and he's a good actor but I can't stomach the types of movies he does now.

(I suspect there's a cadre of Hollywood lawyers who have it down to a science how many scenes have to be different in order to stop studio A from suing studio B for plagiarism, and this movie is right on the border.) The only thing that marginally redeems this flick is the interplay between Michael Madsen and Jeff Fahey, of which there is far too little here to redeem this in any way.
