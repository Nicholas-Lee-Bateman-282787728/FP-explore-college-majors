666719,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00005N5SF,Bruce Rux,"[1, 1]","Both of these episodes share one thing in common:  they boldly went where no network program had gone before, in terms of ... bypassing the censors.  ""Wink of an Eye"" is the one in which comely Kathie Brown (the real-life Mrs. Darren McGavin) is seen brushing her hair beside William Shatner while Shatner sits on the edge of his bed pulling on his boot, and ""Plato's Stepchildren"" had T.V.'s first interracial kiss (William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols).  Neither of these things may seem like that big of a deal today, but in 1968, let me tell you...!""Wink"" is an episode that makes little sense, but is thoroughly enjoyable.  The entire race of the planet Scalos seems to have disappeared, without explanation.  All that remains there is an occasional odd insect buzzing  -  which follows the landing party back to the Enterprise, after which Captain Kirk suddenly disappears from the bridge, in full view of the crew.  What's really happened to him is the same thing that happened to the Scalosians, several of whom are now on board  -  he's speeded-up a thousand times, now moving too fast to be detected by anyone not accelerated at the same rate.  Alien leader Kathie Brown, like all alien women, has taken a fancy to the charismatic Kirk, and intends to keep him with her after freezing the entire Enterprise crew and stealing his starship to move on to greener pastures.  Forgetting the built-in logic problem of how matter accelerated to such an impossible speed keeps from falling apart by intense friction, this is still a pretty good little story, fascinating to watch, and Kathie Brown is a knockout, in addition to being a decent actress.""Plato's Stepchildren"" is a great episode, written by one of Outer Limits' best contributors, Meyer Dolinsky.  The Enterprise finds itself summoned to a previously believed to be uninhabited planet, populated by beautiful people affecting ancient Greek costume and architecture.  They call themselves Plato's Stepchildren, supposedly devoted to nothing but lofty philosophy  -  but in reality, they are telekinetic demigods, whose seeming immortality and incredible power has dragged them down into sadistic decadence.  Their power and immortality does have one terrible price  -  it makes them hemophiliacs, and their medical knowledge is dreadfully inadequate, so Dr. McCoy is commanded to remain behind with them.  When he refuses, Plato's Stepchildren force several of the Enterprise crew into cruelly degrading situations, and unleash the full force of their fury.The story is great, and so are the scenery and the guest stars.  Liam Sullivan is the Caligula-like Parmin, head of the planet, with the always sexy Barbara Babcock as his aristocratically sadistic mate.  Best of all is famous dwarf actor Michael Dunn as the planet's whipping-boy, who helps the Enterprise defeat the evil Platonians.  Dunn  -  best known as Dr. Loveless in The Wild, Wild West  -  had a phenomenal singing voice, and usually got to use it in his numerous 1960s guest appearances, as he does here in fine style.",5,Interracial Space Sex!,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,3050,"['episodes', 'share', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'boldly', 'went', 'where', 'network', 'program', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'terms', 'bypassing', 'censors', 'Wink', 'Eye', 'one', 'comely', 'Kathie', 'Brown', 'real-life', 'Mrs.', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'seen', 'brushing', 'hair', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Shatner', 'sits', 'edge', 'bed', 'pulling', 'boot', 'Plato', 'Stepchildren', 'had', 'T.V', 'first', 'interracial', 'kiss', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'things', 'may', 'seem', 'big', 'deal', 'today', '1968', 'let', 'tell', 'Wink', 'episode', 'little', 'sense', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'entire', 'race', 'planet', 'Scalos', 'have', 'disappeared', 'explanation', 'occasional', 'odd', 'insect', 'buzzing', 'landing', 'party', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'suddenly', 'bridge', 'full', 'view', 'crew', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Scalosians', 'several', 'whom', 'are', 'now', 'board', 'speeded-up', 'thousand', 'times', 'now', 'moving', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'detected', 'anyone', 'not', 'accelerated', 'same', 'rate', 'Alien', 'leader', 'Kathie', 'Brown', 'alien', 'women', 'taken', 'fancy', 'charismatic', 'Kirk', 'keep', 'freezing', 'entire', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'stealing', 'starship', 'move', 'greener', 'pastures', 'Forgetting', 'built-in', 'logic', 'problem', 'how', 'matter', 'accelerated', 'impossible', 'speed', 'keeps', 'falling', 'apart', 'intense', 'friction', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'story', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Kathie', 'Brown', 'knockout', 'addition', 'being', 'decent', 'actress', 'Plato', 'Stepchildren', 'great', 'episode', 'written', 'one', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'best', 'contributors', 'Meyer', 'Dolinsky', 'Enterprise', 'summoned', 'previously', 'believed', 'be', 'uninhabited', 'planet', 'populated', 'beautiful', 'people', 'affecting', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'costume', 'architecture', 'call', 'Plato', 'Stepchildren', 'supposedly', 'devoted', 'nothing', 'lofty', 'philosophy', 'reality', 'are', 'telekinetic', 'demigods', 'seeming', 'immortality', 'incredible', 'power', 'dragged', 'down', 'sadistic', 'decadence', 'power', 'immortality', 'have', 'one', 'terrible', 'price', 'hemophiliacs', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'dreadfully', 'inadequate', 'so', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'commanded', 'remain', 'When', 'Plato', 'Stepchildren', 'force', 'several', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'cruelly', 'degrading', 'situations', 'unleash', 'full', 'force', 'fury.The', 'story', 'great', 'so', 'are', 'scenery', 'guest', 'stars', 'Liam', 'Sullivan', 'Caligula-like', 'Parmin', 'head', 'planet', 'always', 'sexy', 'Barbara', 'Babcock', 'aristocratically', 'sadistic', 'mate', 'Best', 'famous', 'dwarf', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Dunn', 'planet', 'whipping-boy', 'who', 'Enterprise', 'defeat', 'evil', 'Platonians', 'Dunn', 'best', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Loveless', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'had', 'phenomenal', 'singing', 'voice', 'usually', 'got', 'use', 'numerous', '1960s', 'guest', 'appearances', 'here', 'fine', 'style']",N/A

Still, in the first episode which closely resembles the ""Squire of Gothos"" from Season 1, we get ""superior"" beings who become intoxicated with their powerful telekinetic powers and become living proof of George Orwell's famous pronouncement in ""Animal Farm"": ""Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely.""  It what can be described a painful episode in more ways than one to watch, we get to see Spock and Kirk made to look extremely foolish and humiliated almost beyond bearing but then managed to turn the tables around and to have the self-restraint to not take revenge when the opportunity arises.  All in all, this is an above average episode and is certainly one of the better ones of season 3.In the second episode, we get another example of a powerful race rationalising that superior power makes it alright to impose your designs on the less superior.  Here, in order to perpetuate the species at all costs, the Scalosians decide that it's okay to kidnap, use and discard the unsuspecting for their greater ""good"".  Like the first episode in this volume, while not great this episode still ranks among the better ones of the season.Overall we get two episodes which highlight how power can easily corrupt and can even be ""rationalised"" as a perfectly good reason to abuse, exploit and manipulate the less powerful.Two of the more interesting episodes make this volume come under the ""nice to have but not essential"" category if you picking which volumes to collect and keep.",4,Two of the Better Episodes of Season 3!,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1597,"[""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'very', 'much', 'given', 'quality', 'majority', 'episodes', 'season', 'Still', 'first', 'episode', 'closely', 'Squire', 'Gothos', 'Season', '1', 'get', 'superior', 'beings', 'who', 'become', 'intoxicated', 'powerful', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'become', 'living', 'proof', 'George', 'Orwell', 'famous', 'pronouncement', 'Animal', 'Farm', 'Power', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'painful', 'episode', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'watch', 'get', 'see', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'made', 'look', 'extremely', 'foolish', 'humiliated', 'almost', 'bearing', 'then', 'managed', 'turn', 'tables', 'around', 'have', 'self-restraint', 'not', 'take', 'revenge', 'when', 'opportunity', 'above', 'average', 'episode', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'season', '3.In', 'second', 'episode', 'get', 'example', 'powerful', 'race', 'rationalising', 'superior', 'power', 'alright', 'impose', 'designs', 'less', 'superior', 'Here', 'order', 'perpetuate', 'species', 'costs', 'Scalosians', 'decide', 'okay', 'kidnap', 'use', 'discard', 'unsuspecting', 'greater', 'good', 'first', 'episode', 'volume', 'not', 'great', 'episode', 'still', 'better', 'ones', 'season.Overall', 'get', 'two', 'episodes', 'highlight', 'how', 'power', 'can', 'easily', 'corrupt', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'rationalised', 'perfectly', 'good', 'reason', 'abuse', 'exploit', 'manipulate', 'less', 'powerful.Two', 'more', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'make', 'volume', 'come', 'nice', 'have', 'not', 'essential', 'category', 'picking', 'volumes', 'collect', 'keep']",N/A
666722,AEV640MKB3I9J,B00005N5SF,Hank Drake,"[2, 4]","Volume 34 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek contains two episodes which could best be described as fair-to-middling in quality.Plato's Stepchildren made history of sorts by containing the first interracial kiss (inter-ETHNIC, really, since Kirk and Uhura are both of the same race--the HUMAN race) on network television.  But William Shatner, in his book Star Trek Memories, pointed out that TWO versions of the kiss were filmed--one as a full-on kiss, and one where the actors' lips didn't actually meet.  The second take was used, which means the highly touted kiss is actually a fake!  (Watch the episode and you'll see what I mean.)  Perhaps the publicity mavens connected with Trek actually are referring to the smooch between Spock and Nurse Chapel when they refer to an interracial kiss--which would fit the bill since Spock is half-Vulcan.  The rest of the episode is a mix is sillyness, some cringeworthy moments from the actors, and lightweight sermonizing.Wink of an Eye is a bit better.  The idea of life-forms existing out of sync with each other has served Trek well and often.  Generally, this episode is well made, although there are inconsistencies.  It is never fully explained how the accelerated Scalosians can function on the Enterprise (the doors to the turbolift and corridors remain conveniently open for much of the episode).  Uncharacteristically, after the Scalosians have been defeated, Kirk does not extend the hand of friendship and offer them a cure for their ailment, but rather sends them on their way.  NBC's censors must have been asleep during the infamous scene where Kirk--after a coital romp with the Scalosian queen--pulls his boots back on.  There is an inventive touch late in this episode, where some stock music is played at the wrong speed to increase the disorienting effect.Picture and sound are fine.",3,TV's First Interracial Kiss...OR IS IT?,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,1862,"['Volume', '34', 'Paramount', 'complete', 'reissue', 'Classic', 'Trek', 'two', 'episodes', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'fair-to-middling', 'quality.Plato', 'Stepchildren', 'made', 'history', 'sorts', 'containing', 'first', 'interracial', 'kiss', 'inter-ETHNIC', 'really', 'Kirk', 'Uhura', 'are', 'same', 'race', 'HUMAN', 'race', 'network', 'television', 'William', 'Shatner', 'book', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Memories', 'pointed', 'out', 'TWO', 'versions', 'kiss', 'were', 'filmed', 'one', 'full-on', 'kiss', 'one', 'where', 'actors', 'lips', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'meet', 'second', 'take', 'was', 'used', 'highly', 'touted', 'kiss', 'actually', 'fake', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Perhaps', 'publicity', 'connected', 'Trek', 'actually', 'are', 'referring', 'smooch', 'Spock', 'Nurse', 'Chapel', 'when', 'refer', 'interracial', 'kiss', 'would', 'fit', 'bill', 'Spock', 'half-Vulcan', 'rest', 'episode', 'mix', 'sillyness', 'cringeworthy', 'moments', 'actors', 'lightweight', 'sermonizing.Wink', 'Eye', 'bit', 'better', 'idea', 'life-forms', 'existing', 'sync', 'other', 'served', 'Trek', 'well', 'often', 'Generally', 'episode', 'well', 'made', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'how', 'accelerated', 'Scalosians', 'can', 'function', 'Enterprise', 'doors', 'turbolift', 'corridors', 'remain', 'conveniently', 'open', 'much', 'episode', 'Uncharacteristically', 'Scalosians', 'have', 'been', 'defeated', 'Kirk', 'not', 'extend', 'hand', 'friendship', 'offer', 'cure', 'ailment', 'rather', 'way', 'NBC', 'censors', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'asleep', 'infamous', 'scene', 'where', 'Kirk', 'coital', 'romp', 'Scalosian', 'queen', 'boots', 'back', 'inventive', 'touch', 'late', 'episode', 'where', 'stock', 'music', 'played', 'wrong', 'speed', 'increase', 'disorienting', 'effect.Picture', 'sound', 'are', 'fine']",N/A
666723,A1G9IV3IBW8WMP,B00005N5SF,Jared Insell,"[0, 2]","Volume 34 of the Star Trek DVD series contains two episodes that have been considered good cause they were supposedly very risqu&eacute; during the time they aired.  Partly because each has it's own ""landmark moment in American television"".  In reality these moments are barely noticable and these two Trek episodes are just as mediocre as the rest that came out of the third season.PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN opens this one.  Yeah I know. I've heard it a thousand times: ""tv's first interracial kiss"" between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols.  The truth is (according to Shatner himself) that two scenes of this were shot. One that was actually a kiss and the other that wasn't.  The latter was chosen in the original airing and they have never bothered to put the actual kiss in any reruns.  Therefore technically there is nothing special about this one.  The plot is typical Star Trek and this episode showcases some of the actors most embarassing moments.  Still this is good for a laugh.  Especially when the dwarf Alexander mounts Kirk like a horse and our good Capt. begins to 'neigh'.  Apart from those embarassing moments and a few touching acting scenes between Kirk and Alexander this episode is pretty forgettable.The second episode here is WINK OF AN EYE which fairs little better than PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN.  For whatever reason I have always felt the sound in this one was muffled.  Maybe it was just me?  Anyways the supposed off camera sex scene between Kirk and the girl isn't very noteworthy.  As a matter of fact I didn't even notice it until another Amazon.com reviewer mentioned it!  The plot to WINK OF AN EYE is interesting but in the long run it's merely the Star Trek crew being invaded by bizarre aliens once again.  As I said many times before, it's been done!  Anybody else notice that the camera work of this episode was almost always on a slant?  Just a thought...Overall these two episodes are definetly watchable but I find neither them are as special as they claim to be.  Keep in mind these were released in 1968 so perhaps they were considered more shocking back then but I find it hard to believe since Star Trek's ratings and popularity were at an all time low when they aired.  Not the best but it's classic Trek so go on try it!
