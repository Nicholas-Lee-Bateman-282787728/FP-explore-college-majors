It is the story of Steve-o, essentially the &quot;poster boy&quot; for left wing punks in the SLC area, but also essentially believed to be one of the more intelligent people in the area too.Steve-O is played by Mathew Lillard of &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; fame (he played Shaggy).  No.  This is NOT your typical Mathew Lillard performance, though his zany personality DOES come out some in his character.The first time I saw this movie in any way, shape or form, I started watching near the end of the movie and it was one of the more confusing, worthless movie experiences I've EVER had and it really turned me off to the possibilty of this being a good movie.  Then I moved in with a roomate who owned the Video and was &quot;forced&quot; to watch the movie.It's a great flick about politics, &quot;punks&quot;, society, love, and life.  I really like the characters, the way the film shows the growth of all the characters, and I feel the side bar things, such as narratives and explanations of scenes (the fight scene with the rednecks being what I'm referring to) are great for showing a point, moving the plot and also justifying some scenes to punch up the movie a bit.Well worth your time, this small film is definitely a film to watch.  Some of the scenes are nearly stolen by the man who plays Lillard's dad, as he has a great performance too.",5,This film is great,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1471,"['was', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'romp', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Punk', 'scene', 'Mid-eighties', 'story', 'Steve-o', 'essentially', 'quot', 'poster', 'boy', 'quot', 'left', 'wing', 'punks', 'SLC', 'area', 'also', 'essentially', 'believed', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'people', 'area', 'too.Steve-O', 'played', 'Mathew', 'Lillard', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'quot', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'quot', 'fame', 'played', 'Shaggy', 'No', 'NOT', 'typical', 'Mathew', 'Lillard', 'performance', 'zany', 'personality', 'DOES', 'come', 'out', 'character.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'started', 'watching', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'confusing', 'worthless', 'movie', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'had', 'really', 'turned', 'possibilty', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'Then', 'moved', 'roomate', 'who', 'owned', 'Video', 'was', 'quot', 'forced', 'quot', 'watch', 'movie.It', 'great', 'flick', 'politics', 'quot', 'quot', 'society', 'love', 'life', 'really', 'characters', 'way', 'film', 'growth', 'characters', 'feel', 'side', 'bar', 'things', 'such', 'narratives', 'explanations', 'scenes', 'fight', 'scene', 'rednecks', 'being', 'what', ""'m"", 'referring', 'are', 'great', 'showing', 'point', 'moving', 'plot', 'also', 'justifying', 'scenes', 'punch', 'up', 'movie', 'bit.Well', 'time', 'small', 'film', 'definitely', 'film', 'watch', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'stolen', 'man', 'who', 'Lillard', 'dad', 'great', 'performance', 'too']",N/A

20777,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0767835980,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[8, 9]","If you're going to appreciate ""SLC Punk,"" the 1999 film by writer/director James Merendino, you need to have grown up during the 1980s. The film, taking place in Salt Lake City in 1984, hits all the right notes when documenting rebellion and music of the period. The lifestyles, attitudes and different cliques which spun off from American punk rock have been accurately detailed. Most importantly, the story transcends the era, revealing the frustrations of youthful rebellion and the angst of American suburban living.There's a thread connecting ""SLC Punk,"" ""Quadrophenia,"" ""Easy Rider"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause."" The protagonists are cut from the same cloth - different eras, same story. ""SLC Punk"" has also been compared to other films detailing punk rock, most notably ""Suburbia"" and ""The Decline of Western Civilization."" ""SLC Punk"" comes far closer to the emotional truth of this 1980s American subculture. I related to almost every scene, though found the ending to be melodramatic. Why can't characters evolve due to changes within rather than the tragedies of others?To see the beginnings of punk rock, all one has to do is view the extraordinary Sex Pistols' documentary ""The Filth and the Fury."" The anger and the music eventually spread to America, reaching such humble burgs as, according to this film, Salt Lake City. Fights with rednecks or frats were commonplace, and this is properly detailed. The chaos of concerts in small venues highlighted by thrash dancing and stage diving is expertly portrayed. The all-night parties, where wildly diverse styles including Nerds and Mods mixed with Punks, are recreated to great perfection.""SLC Punk"" documents all of this with a feverish style. The film is narrated entirely by our main protagonist Stevo, brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Lillard. This was the Reagan era, in which a movement to return to old values and traditions alienated the seeds of Woodstock. The styles of punk however, were eventually as rigid as a Southern frat house, and this is noted in ""SLC Punk.""In ""SLC Punk,"" we are much closer to our parents than we care to admit. This is emphasized during Stevo's hilarious conversations with his father, a former hippie turned lawyer who has ""bought in"" to the system. Played by Chris McDonald, he accepts his son's rebellion and tries to understand. Dad's a bit lost, but his love for his son is never in doubt. It's a multi-dimensional portrayal which is a highlight.The final conflict of ""SLC Punk"" comes at a rapid pace, the spiral begun by an impromptu acid trip in a park leading to yet another all-night party and a drug overdose. Stevo doesn't leave the punk scene more than he evolves, as most of us do in life. There's a tendency by hardcore faithful to downgrade this film because Stevo transforms rather than giving the world the finger. He reaches his breaking point, splintering off into his own individualism. It's an oddly touching moment, spiced by an incredible flashback as Stevo takes Rush off the turntable and plays Generation X for the first time. Suddenly, the road becomes clear.Who among us cannot recall instances from youth in which everything made sense - the translucent flash when the path cleared and we witnessed our definition? Moments like this are painful to watch because they are so truthful. Youth is pain, and ""SLC Punk"" is a uniquely executed slice of it.",4,"God Save ""SLC Punk""",1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,3377,"[""'re"", 'going', 'appreciate', 'SLC', 'Punk', '1999', 'film', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Merendino', 'need', 'have', 'grown', 'up', '1980s', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', '1984', 'right', 'notes', 'when', 'documenting', 'rebellion', 'music', 'period', 'lifestyles', 'attitudes', 'different', 'cliques', 'spun', 'off', 'American', 'punk', 'rock', 'have', 'been', 'accurately', 'detailed', 'Most', 'importantly', 'story', 'era', 'revealing', 'frustrations', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'angst', 'American', 'suburban', 'thread', 'connecting', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'Quadrophenia', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'protagonists', 'are', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'different', 'eras', 'same', 'story', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'also', 'been', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'detailing', 'punk', 'rock', 'most', 'notably', 'Suburbia', 'Decline', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'far', 'closer', 'emotional', 'truth', '1980s', 'American', 'subculture', 'related', 'almost', 'scene', 'though', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'characters', 'evolve', 'due', 'changes', 'rather', 'tragedies', 'others', 'see', 'beginnings', 'punk', 'rock', 'one', 'do', 'view', 'extraordinary', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'documentary', 'Filth', 'Fury', 'anger', 'music', 'eventually', 'spread', 'America', 'reaching', 'such', 'humble', 'burgs', 'according', 'film', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Fights', 'rednecks', 'frats', 'were', 'commonplace', 'properly', 'detailed', 'chaos', 'concerts', 'small', 'venues', 'highlighted', 'thrash', 'dancing', 'stage', 'diving', 'expertly', 'portrayed', 'all-night', 'parties', 'where', 'wildly', 'diverse', 'styles', 'including', 'Nerds', 'Mods', 'mixed', 'Punks', 'are', 'recreated', 'great', 'perfection', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'documents', 'feverish', 'style', 'film', 'narrated', 'entirely', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Stevo', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'was', 'Reagan', 'era', 'movement', 'return', 'old', 'values', 'traditions', 'alienated', 'seeds', 'Woodstock', 'styles', 'punk', 'however', 'were', 'eventually', 'as', 'rigid', 'Southern', 'frat', 'house', 'noted', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'are', 'much', 'closer', 'parents', 'care', 'admit', 'emphasized', 'Stevo', 'hilarious', 'conversations', 'father', 'former', 'hippie', 'turned', 'lawyer', 'who', 'bought', 'system', 'Played', 'Chris', 'McDonald', 'son', 'rebellion', 'tries', 'understand', 'Dad', 'bit', 'lost', 'love', 'son', 'never', 'doubt', 'multi-dimensional', 'portrayal', 'highlight.The', 'final', 'conflict', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'rapid', 'pace', 'spiral', 'begun', 'impromptu', 'acid', 'trip', 'park', 'leading', 'yet', 'all-night', 'party', 'drug', 'overdose', 'Stevo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'punk', 'scene', 'more', 'most', 'do', 'life', 'tendency', 'hardcore', 'faithful', 'downgrade', 'film', 'Stevo', 'rather', 'giving', 'world', 'finger', 'breaking', 'point', 'splintering', 'off', 'own', 'individualism', 'oddly', 'touching', 'moment', 'spiced', 'incredible', 'flashback', 'Stevo', 'Rush', 'off', 'turntable', 'plays', 'Generation', 'X', 'first', 'time', 'Suddenly', 'road', 'clear.Who', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'instances', 'youth', 'everything', 'made', 'sense', 'translucent', 'flash', 'when', 'path', 'cleared', 'witnessed', 'definition', 'Moments', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'so', 'truthful', 'Youth', 'pain', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'uniquely', 'executed', 'slice']",N/A

20780,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,0767835980,C. L. Messina,"[3, 3]","Wow! I can't recall the last time I saw so many heated reviews.I saw this movie awhile back so I'm a rusty review. Pardon me if I miss a few fine points but I can't watch it again. It's just too painful. When I saw it I saw my teenage life in a movie and wanted to just run out of the room. I didn't grow up in SLC but I did get transplanted from a large city into a small Midwest town with a fringe 'punk' scene during the second or third wave of punk. This movie is such a freaking history lesson because it describes a time when there was no Hot Topic (i.e. Punk was subculture and had no real money cashing in on it) and punk was a mostly unwanted subculture. If you looked like these kids during this time period you WERE the enemy, no matter how true your Anarchist morals might be. Just listening to the Dead Kennedy's in public was an act of Communism. See how I didn't say 'act of terrorism' there? Middle East terrorism was a thing of the late 70's so the hatred was against Communism. If you were anti-Reagan and said something as simple as 'what's so bad about collective farming?' in the mid 80's you were likely to evoke some hostility.And so many look back at the time with the lens of the internet and Wikipedia misguiding their view. You must understand that if punk (a very small and unpopular music genre) came to your town it was through import. Either a friend from a big city brought it or some lone independent record store carried it along with a few odd albums from the 70's, like Zappa, that you'd never heard or cared about. And that was all you got. You couldn't hyperlink from Johnny Rotten to Anarchy and try to figure out what that rally meant. You just saw pictures of the Sex Pistols pissing everyone off and thought, 'yeah, that sounds about right'. Punk was your shield. You may not have understood all it's underlying philosophy (like there's actually one they can all agree to) but you understood the reaction, and that was enough.Now here's the next kicker that strikes me as a little funny. It's odd that people can't fathom two people can experience the same phenomenon differently or have a different take on it. Being a punk in say NYC 77 would have been much different than being one in 86 insert small Midwest town, '81 Manchester England or '82 Los Angeles. This movie can't capture every 'punk' experience or perspective everyone had and it shouldn't. What it does well is describe the isolation, outcast and sometimes bizarre lifestyle proclaiming yourself a 'punk' might put you into. The scene with the drug dealer where he's shooting the car hoping to sink it in Great Salt Lake wasn't exactly my personal experience but it wasn't too far from the 'anything could happen so watch out' feeling I had when I proclaimed myself a 'punk'.I knew someone like every single character in the movie during my 'punk' phase, and while I didn't become a lawyer I did look back on it all as an absurd but necessary coming of age transition set to a very angry soundtrack (my personal soundtrack had Husker Du's 'Zen Arcade', Black Flags 'Who's Got the 10 1/2' and DK's 'Fresh Fruit' playing most of the time). Again, ALL of this was too insane to live one time around and watch a second time around.What really struck me as profound is Steve-O's girlfriend who points out how punk is just another uniform. Maybe the movement didn't start out that way but we all know that's all it became. It pains me to see what my friends and I used to call 'safety hawks' sported by people trying to look trendy just as much as it pains me to see motorcycle guys riding around wearing Harley gear. It's too cliche' to have any meaning or impact any more. When punk got corporate sponsorship a'la Hot Topic it said it's final death knell. It sounded kind of like this: ghhgghgghgghhh! Ghaaahhhh. Gehhhhehhgggh! (cough, cough, roll on the floor dramatically).Was Steve-O a poseur? God, how we threw that term around way back when. Well, how punk is 'punk'? What is punk? Is it the crybaby Clash of 'Sandanista' bleeding a left-leaning heart out for some idiotic third world problem I have no clue about or is it the thrash of Greg Ginn's guitar solo against a sea of seemingly mediocre music? Do you have to run for office as a joke, like Biafra, and keep up this anti-right atitude for life no matter how annoying (again, Biafra), or do you have to keep your hate face on like Rollins? Or were you no longer punk if you weren't hanging with the CBGB crowd in the mid-70's? What if you weren't in a band? And what about those God-Awful skaters that would hang around like  flies on punk's rotten corpse, are they punk? Is it all about fighting authority? What if you become an authority on fighting authority?Lux Interior (the Cramps) would tell Steve-O, and you for that matter, 'You ain't no punk, YOU PUNK!' After throwing away enough of my life to some silly movement that expressed my anger quite vividly I'd say Steve-O was  just as punk as anything else that came down the pike. I'm just glad he had the sense to move on and not let an art fad become his life. That's right hanger on-er's. Punk was just one big art fad. Time to let go and find something else or find nothing at all.Great movie, F-You.",4,Time Capsule,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,5229,"['ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'so', 'many',

20781,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,0767835980,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[2, 3]","A well-meaning if not slightly flawed film that is still highly recommended in the usually unwatchable wasteland that is the punk rock movie. The action centers around two lovably antagonistic protagonists, Stevo and Heroin Bob, as they try to verify personal truth in the unlivable (to them) wasteland of Salt Lake City in 1985. The fact that the pair are, at the time, the only ""real"" punks in the straight-laced Mormon metropolis allows the film to build upon a philosophical foundation of contrasts.Within the madness and mayhem, certain scenarios allow larger issues to be argued; dualities discussed include punks vs. hippies, violence vs. peace, ""real"" punks vs. poseurs, chaos vs. structure, and anarchy vs. fascism. Some very good questions are both implicitly and explicitly asked, such as ""Does violent anarchism become fascism when it seeks to impose its value systems on others?""And though most of these questions are answered with what amounts to a cinematic shrug, it is done in a knowing, wink-wink kind of fashion, as if the filmmakers are well aware that no solutions are being provided, and that it's only important that the viewer ponder the paradox. In other words: ""think for yourself.""The only problem I had with the film is that it seems to, in places, equate punk with mindless violence, a cultural construct and media myth which has been in place since daytime talk shows reached out to the violently disenfranchised youth of America and said, ""Punks are messed up and need makeovers."" And the youth bought in.And though I usually despise films that trumpet their soundtracks as a reason to see the film, in this movie the musical cues work really well, both in content and placement; not only are classic tracks by Exploited, the Stooges, Fear, the Ramones, the Vandals, the Velvet Underground, Adolescents, and Dead Kennedys featured, but oftentimes they are included at very appropriate points in the plot. The best example of this is when Minor Threat's ""Look Back and Laugh"" begins playing as Stevo contemplates his loyalty towards his best friend Bob. (For those of you not in the lyrical know, the words go, ""One day something funny happened, but it scared the s--- out of me/Their heads went in different directions, and their friendship ceased to be.""). But the real kicker is that the track is pushed back in the mix before the second part of the lyric kicks in, so in order for the musical cue to make any real sense, you have to know the song on your own. Nice.Also rising above the mix are the performances by the lead actors, Matthew Lillard as Stevo and Michael Goorjian as Heroin Bob. Lillard transcends his usual one-note snarkiness to create an actual character, and Goorjian makes Heroin Bob (so named because of his fear of needles) one of the most likable - nay, lovable - characters in recent memory.The commentary track on this DVD is somewhat entertaining but not particularly incisive - I was definitely expecting more insights from director/writer James Merendino, but he comes off somewhat disjointedly and nowhere near as thoughtful as the film he himself wrote and made.What saves this particular commentary is the engaging verbal sparring of Matthew Lillard (who enters the commentary late 'cause he overslept - VERY PUNK) and Michael Goorjian (who has to leave early to catch a plane - NOT VERY PUNK). They spar with and complain to Merendino about the director's sometimes-unsafe, seat-of-the-pants filming technique, Lillard's mugging and each other's acting choices. That makes it worth a listen, but if you're looking for deeper insights into the film, you'll come away slightly disappointed.",4,Are You Selling Out or Buying In?,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3653,"['well-meaning', 'not', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'film', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended', 'usually', 'unwatchable', 'wasteland', 'punk', 'rock', 'movie', 'action', 'centers', 'two', 'lovably', 'antagonistic', 'protagonists', 'Stevo', 'Heroin', 'Bob', 'try', 'verify', 'personal', 'truth', 'unlivable', 'wasteland', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', '1985', 'fact', 'pair', 'are', 'time', 'only', 'real', 'punks', 'straight-laced', 'Mormon', 'metropolis', 'film', 'build', 'philosophical', 'foundation', 'contrasts.Within', 'madness', 'mayhem', 'certain', 'scenarios', 'allow', 'larger', 'issues', 'be', 'argued', 'dualities', 'discussed', 'include', 'punks', 'vs.', 'hippies', 'violence', 'vs.', 'peace', 'real', 'punks', 'vs.', 'poseurs', 'chaos', 'vs.', 'structure', 'anarchy', 'vs.', 'fascism', 'very', 'good', 'questions', 'are', 'implicitly', 'explicitly', 'asked', 'such', 'Does', 'violent', 'anarchism', 'become', 'fascism', 'when', 'impose', 'value', 'systems', 'others', 'most', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'what', 'amounts', 'cinematic', 'shrug', 'done', 'knowing', 'wink-wink', 'kind', 'fashion', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'solutions', 'are', 'being', 'provided', 'only', 'important', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'paradox', 'other', 'words', 'think', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'places', 'equate', 'punk', 'mindless', 'violence', 'cultural', 'construct', 'media', 'myth', 'been', 'place', 'daytime', 'talk', 'reached', 'violently', 'disenfranchised', 'youth', 'America', 'said', 'Punks', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'need', 'makeovers', 'youth', 'bought', 'in.And', 'usually', 'despise', 'films', 'trumpet', 'soundtracks', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'movie', 'musical', 'cues', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'content', 'placement', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'classic', 'tracks', 'Exploited', 'Stooges', 'Fear', 'Ramones', 'Vandals', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Adolescents', 'Dead', 'Kennedys', 'featured', 'are', 'included', 'very', 'appropriate', 'points', 'plot', 'best', 'example', 'when', 'Minor', 'Threat', 'Look', 'Back', 'Laugh', 'playing', 'Stevo', 'loyalty', 'best', 'friend', 'Bob', 'not', 'lyrical', 'know', 'words', 'go', 'One', 'day', 'something', 'funny', 'happened', 'scared', 's', 'me/Their', 'heads', 'went', 'different', 'directions', 'friendship', 'ceased', 'be.', 'real', 'kicker', 'track', 'pushed', 'back', 'mix', 'second', 'part', 'lyric', 'kicks', 'so', 'order', 'musical', 'cue', 'make', 'real', 'sense', 'have', 'know', 'song', 'own', 'Nice.Also', 'rising', 'mix', 'are', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Stevo', 'Michael', 'Goorjian', 'Heroin', 'Bob', 'Lillard', 'usual', 'one-note', 'snarkiness', 'create', 'actual', 'character', 'Goorjian', 'Heroin', 'Bob', 'so', 'named', 'fear', 'needles', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'nay', 'lovable', 'characters', 'recent', 'memory.The', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'not', 'particularly', 'incisive', 'was', 'definitely', 'expecting', 'more', 'insights', 'director/writer', 'James', 'Merendino', 'off', 'somewhat', 'disjointedly', 'nowhere', 'as', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'wrote', 'made.What', 'particular', 'commentary', 'engaging', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'who', 'commentary', 'late', 'overslept', 'VERY', 'PUNK', 'Michael', 'Goorjian', 'who', 'leave', 'early', 'catch', 'plane', 'VERY', 'PUNK', 'spar', 'complain', 'Merendino', 'director', 'sometimes-unsafe', 'seat-of-the-pants', 'filming', 'technique', 'Lillard', 'mugging', 'other', 'acting', 'choices', 'listen', ""'re"", 'looking', 'deeper', 'insights', 'film', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'slightly', 'disappointed']",N/A
20782,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,0767835980,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[12, 20]","Set in the year 1985, SLC (Salt Lake City) Punk stars Matthew Lillard as Stevo, one of two punks caught in the heart of conservatism in Salt Lake City, or Salt Lake Sh*tty, as they would say.Never being a big fan of Lillard (Scooby Doo, Wing Commander, Scream), I waited nearly two years before picking this movie up.  I have to say I was impressed by his portrayal of Stevo, along with the rest of the movie.Many of the ideals of punk are explored, a lot of times in narrative, such as anarchy, rebellion, fighting, drugs, changing the system, sell outs, poseurs, music, and random chaos.  I really didn't get a sense of the true punk scene, not like I did with Sid and Nancy, but this movie was entertaining.Basically the movie follows Stevo and his friend, Heroin Bob around and documents their existence.  We get a view into their politics, social circles, lifestyle, relationships, and their difficulties in being a part of the counterculture in conservative America.  The film tends to bounce around somewhat erratically, but that seemed in line to me with the subject matter.  There are a number of very funny scenes, including one involving a trip to Wyoming for alcohol. Utah sells alcohol, but the sale of such spirits is highly restrictive.  I especially enjoyed the ending, even though I did see it coming, but Lillard's performance during the scene really helped to make it work.A good supporting cast, an excellent music score, and fine direction work together to make this movie worth looking into, especially if you have any interest in the punk scene in America during the 80's.  I didn't get a sense that it was completely representative of the movement, but maybe it's not supposed to be...I don't know.There are some decent extras, including a commentary track by the director and some of the stars, an isolated music score, a couple of trailers, production notes, and an SLC comic book (not an actual comic book, but one you can view on the screen).

20783,A31HN3JZNRB74Y,0767835980,"daibhidh ""daibhidh""","[35, 60]","This is a high-energy youth angst movie, set in 1980s Salt Lake City. Matthew Lillard is Stevo, protagonist punk and narrator. The movie basically tracks his post-college life in SLC as he tries to define just  who the hell he is, along with his long-time buddy, Heroin Bob (who's one of the only characters with even an iota of credibility to him, especially when stacked up with Stevo -- incidentally, the Steve-o from ""Jackass"" and ""Wildboyz"" is infinitely more hardcore than Lillard's Stevo -- hell, for the little poserkids out there, watch ""Jackass"" to get a better understanding of it!)Without  wanting to spoil much of this movie, because it really is a lot of fun, I  have to say that I think that Stevo's father IS the screenwriter, and he's  confronting his younger self in this movie, and reconciling his lifestyle  choices. There are patchwork references to anarchism and punk throughout  this movie, but for anybody who knows about either of these areas, it's  clear that the writer doesn't get it. How do I put this: it's a punk movie  for posers, or for people who don't know jack about punk.How do I know  this? Well, it's clear that Stevo is a shirtsleeve rebel from the start;  only people who put a lot of faith in appearances and lifestyles could  possibly believe he's anything but that (I mean, he mall-rants at length about how US hardcore is so much better than UK punk, but their punky party van has the Subhumans and PiL spraypainted on it -- hello??)All the punk stereotypes/cliches appear in  this movie - dyed hair, mohawks, leather jackets, and so forth. But anybody  who really gets punk should know that there isn't a look to it, not if  you're for real - nobody should look like a punk, or look like an  anarchist; punk was about anti-fashion, about genuine nonconformity, about  being yourself; anarchism is about self-expression and liberation. This is only practiced by two of the characters, and is pointed out by another. The  rest are charlatans, and they don't even know it.

Many of these, like this one, were with my roommate in college, who was a certified movie freak. Although I forgot about it until I recently bought it for myself, one of the movies I liked a lot back circa 1999 was SLC Punk. As it rapidly segues from hilarious to touching, tragic to gross, ultimately SLC Punk shows it has a message beneath its surface noise, and it says a lot as it unfolds. At its center SLC Punk asks the question ""is buying-in always selling-out?"" To translate that for the uninitiated, that means is following cultural norms always a betrayal of personal identify and youthful dreams? Stevo and his best friend ""Heroin"" Bob (who ironically never touches drugs and is terrified of needles) are two young men living in uber-right wing Salt Lake City during the mid-Reagan years. They do their best to be hard core punks in a time and place where that pursuit separates them from just about everyone else in their Mormon dominated society. Steveo, though, is more than he seems. Amid his binge drinking, ambushing of local rednecks, and philosophical asides on the healthiness of personal anarchy, Steveo, it turns out, is a brilliant student who has the chance to get into an Ivy League college. His father, a smooth-talking Yuppie jerk, does his best to persuade his son to accept the Harvard education open to him, even as the life Steveo believes in proclaims that path to be the ultimate in ""selling out."" Along the way between its memorable opening scene and its closing credits viewers of SLC Punk meet a cast of characters that includes a rebel who disguises himself as a conforming prep, a trust-fund Eurotrash psychopath, a hippie Wiccan woman, and, well...one case of skin infection so bizarre it even stumps medical science. SLC Punk is worth seeing, owning, and heck, even spending ten minutes reviewing on Amazon.com. So go get it.

This movie takes place in 1985,which is genius showing the early punk years. That's why your not going to see any Green Day, Rancid, or The Casualties t-shirts or posters. But they do talk about the ""Sex Pistols"" and the ""Ramones"" The thing that caught the corner of my eye was that James Meredino decided to shoot this film in 2:35:1. Shouldn't it be in 1:85:1? But I guess that's James Merdino's style. For a movie which they only wasted eight hundred thousand dollars, it looks pretty damn good. It looks like they wasted more than eight hundred thousand dollars.This film is about two punkers named ""Stevo and heroin Bob (Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian) who are college graduates who's dream is to make pure anarchy all over the country. Stevo's dad is a lawyer, who wants Stevo to go to Harvard Stevo has the grades, but he doesn't want to go with the system. After hardcore punk shows, and punch of drugs taken in, the two punks don't know what to do in Salt Lake. Heroin Bob doesn't really do heroin, infact he is scared of needles, that's why they call him that. What really caught my attention in this film is Til Schweiger  and how well he played his character mark. My favorite scene is when Mark explains how his whole family died, I know you will love that scene. Til Schweiger did that part so well it deserved an Oscar.  This film talks about the history of punk, and what a punker thinks.This DVD includes audio commentary by Matthew Lillard, Michael Goorgian, and writer/director James Meredino. The commentary is really funny. What I noticed in it was the fact that they mentioned they took out some scenes, so where are all the deleted scenes? This DVD also includes the trailer for this film, and the movie ""go"". It also shows art stills from the original comic book. There's not a behind the scenes look, but I guess it's still cool. There is a lot of flash backs in this film, which when Stevo goes back into talking to the person you go, ""woo I forgot he was talking to that guy"". It is fantastic to see those effects.

Well, the accuracy and whether or not it was &quot;punk&quot;.  Well, that really wasn't the point of the film.  It wasn't a documentary, it was a comedy-drama about a &quot;punk&quot; (which is debatable) who must decide whether to conform and persue a good career or continue his life as an anarchist out to destroy modern society.  It was very funny and entertaining, but most people watch it judging it as a &quot;punk&quot; movie for the &quot;punx&quot;.  For example, one girl remarked that straight-edge should have been a subject in the film.  Well, I'm guessing she's an emo-kid because they are the only ones who seem to think that straight-edge was the most important thing that happenned during the early era of punk.  If you were into the PUNK scene, you would know that it straight-edge was a movement popularised by A Minor Threat in the late 70s in Washington DC.  Of course, since they listen to EMO and not PUNK they think that Dischord was the most important thing to happen to the scene (since it relates to emo), and basically everything that was important about the scene was washed into the background.

So when I stumble upon something like The Curve or SLC Punk!, I find myself pleasantly surprised. The boy IS capable of acting, he just doesn't seem to do it all that often.SLC Punk! is the deceptively simple tale of two punks, Stevo (Lillard) and Bob (indie film favorite Michael Goorjian) trying to survive in the counterculture of perhaps the country's most boring metropolis, Salt Lake City, Utah. Professing a belief in anarchy and a general confusion about such heavy topics as drugs, the opposite sex, and what punk really is, the two, coupled with various fringe players, spend long hours cooking up ways to take down the system without ever actually doing so. That is, when they're not partying.While Lillard and Goorjian are the centerpieces, some of the fringe roles are just as well-acted and engrossing. Star Trek cutie Jennifer Lien plays Stevo's on-again off-again soulmate, while Bob falls in love with X-Files' Annabeth Gish. Christoper McDonald, forever branded with the stigma of having played Tappy Tibbons in Requiem for a Dream, does a minor but wonderful turn as Stevo's dad. James Duval, Summer Phoenix, Devon Sawa, and a host of others all also pop up in minor roles.Like its main characters, the movie seems to have no direction at first, but ends up being more than just your typical slice-of-life flick.

This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at ""The Sundance Film Festival"" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the ""F-word"" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that ""less is more."" There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to ""go-against-the-grain."" It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing. There's not a whole lot I can say about SLC Punk, other than I think it's a complete waste of time and money. This movie is rated [R] for: Profanity, Vulgarity, Drug Use, Teen Partying, and Violence.

I expected a movie about punk kids stuck in the Mormon citadel of Salt Lake City. And while that is the basis of the movie, that's not really what it's  about.What it's about is a punk guy named Steve-O and his friends that  spend all their time partying, doing drugs, and beating up rednecks, etc.  Eventually Steve-O starts to question the punk values he thinks are  important to him. In the movie, there is a lot of talk about posers, but in  the end Steve is a poser too.I thought there would be more involving  conflicts with the Mormon religion, but there are suprisingly few. Even so,  SLC Punk is a great movie: all the performances are great, and the  direction and visual style is great to look at. The colors are bright and  vibrant, like the youthful energy that the movie exudes. The movie is  hilarious - Steve-O's rants and speeches about anarchy and violence are  great and the various scenes and flashbacks are very good.One thing SLC  Punk lacks is a plot.

20826,A38QJ7JUUTVLKX,0767835980,"Tom Servo ""Robot""","[3, 4]","Finally a good movie. Hadn't seen one of these in a while. This movie is a perfect representation of punks in the 80s. Todays punks have become smart, and have adopted the individuality belief instead of anarchy. This movie I believe gets it point across. It also is very unique. The scene at the punk show is pretty acurate to todays punk shows, but the punks of today don't party. They fight for a cause. Also this film does a great job at exposing posers, skinheads, mobs, metalheads, punks, and new wavers. SLC Punk starts out entertainingly enough as a sarcastic snapshot of the punk-rock scene in Salt Lake City in 1985 and is complete with mohawks, moshing, and vague avowals of anarchy. But gradually, the wanderings of Stevo and Heroin Bob turn into a multilayered exploration of character and culture shock. Though he spends his days drinking and mocking the values of his parents, Stevo turns just as critical an eye on his own rhetoric and lifestyle, and comes to find that aimless rebellion may be just as hollow as the mindless pursuit of money. No character has the right point of view; there are no easy solutions. SLC Punk sustains its energy through wit, realism, propulsive editing, and excellent performances from Lillard, Goorjian, and the rest of the cast. Did I mention plot. Yes the plot is great. It's emblematic of the movie's sophistication that Stevo's lawyer father is treated satirically without being dismissed; though baffled by his son's form of rebellion, he never loses hope that Stevo will go on to law school and continues to cajole Stevo and argue with him about how the world works. By its end, the constantly shifting perspective of SLC Punk achieves a surprising emotional depth. All in all at the end Stevo becomes anything but a poser. Now that he thinks for himself, and has a purpose for his rebellion, he's become a punk all of us punx would be proud of. Forget the critics, and the poseur anarchist out there. This movie is an accurate portrayal of the 80s punx, and thus you must keep in mind that we've changed. Although there are more poseurs out there than there are real punx. It was true in the 80s and is still true today.",5,Great movie!!!,1071446400,"12 15, 2003",2003,2176,"['Finally', 'good', 'movie', 'Had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'while', 'movie', 'perfect', 'representation', 'punks', '80s', 'Todays', 'punks', 'have', 'become', 'smart', 'have', 'adopted', 'individuality', 'belief', 'instead', 'anarchy', 'movie', 'believe', 'point', 'also', 'very', 'unique', 'scene', 'punk', 'show', 'pretty', 'acurate', 'todays', 'punk', 'shows', 'punks', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'party', 'fight', 'cause', 'Also', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'exposing', 'posers', 'skinheads', 'mobs', 'metalheads', 'punks', 'new', 'wavers', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'out', 'entertainingly', 'enough', 'sarcastic', 'snapshot', 'punk-rock', 'scene', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', '1985', 'complete', 'mohawks', 'moshing', 'vague', 'avowals', 'anarchy', 'gradually', 'wanderings', 'Stevo', 'Heroin', 'Bob', 'turn', 'multilayered', 'exploration', 'character', 'culture', 'shock', 'days', 'drinking', 'mocking', 'values', 'parents', 'Stevo', 'just', 'as', 'critical', 'eye', 'own', 'rhetoric', 'lifestyle', 'find', 'aimless', 'rebellion', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'hollow', 'mindless', 'pursuit', 'money', 'character', 'right', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'easy', 'solutions', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'energy', 'wit', 'realism', 'propulsive', 'editing', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Lillard', 'Goorjian', 'rest', 'cast', 'Did', 'mention', 'plot', 'Yes', 'plot', 'great', 'emblematic', 'movie', 'sophistication', 'Stevo', 'lawyer', 'father', 'treated', 'satirically', 'being', 'dismissed', 'baffled', 'son', 'form', 'rebellion', 'never', 'hope', 'Stevo', 'will', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'cajole', 'Stevo', 'argue', 'how', 'world', 'end', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'perspective', 'SLC', 'Punk', 'surprising', 'emotional', 'depth', 'end', 'Stevo', 'anything', 'poser', 'Now', 'purpose', 'rebellion', 'become', 'punk', 'punx', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Forget', 'critics', 'poseur', 'anarchist', 'there', 'movie', 'accurate', 'portrayal', '80s', 'punx', 'thus', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'are', 'more', 'poseurs', 'there', 'are', 'real', 'punx', 'was', 'true', '80s', 'still', 'true', 'today']",N/A
20827,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,0767835980,Valerie J. Saturen,"[1, 1]","SLC Punk is about a couple of punk/anarchists stuck in the middle of conservative, Mormon-dominated Salt Lake City. This is a pretty good film, as long as one bears in mind that the kids in it represent more of a ""lifestyle anarchism"" than a political philosophy, and as Stevo (the main character and narrator) self-consciously admits at several points, their actions and attitudes often stand as a flagrant contradiction of the punk ethos they espouse. While the movie does not accurately portray the ""authentic"" punk or anarchist philosophy, it does accurately and poignantly portray a widespread, popular bastardization of it, so it still creates relevant social commentary. As a coming-of-age story, it is poignant and affecting, particularly as tragedy descends upon Heroin Bob, ironically named for his aversion to needles and drugs.Throughout the movie is an undercurrent of dissonance between an anti-oppression philosophy and the characters' aimless,testosterone-fueled adventures. While Stevo and his friends rail against ""fascism,"" they glorify violence and act in ways that perpetuate the ""macho"" dominant culture. Fights are a way of life, and in one scene, Stevo (who claims earlier that ""nobody owns anybody"") catches the woman he likes with someone else and proceeds to beat the daylights out of the rival, who he accuses of ""invading his territory."" A less obvious irony is Stevo's...well...patriotism! He goes to great lengths to extol the superiority of America's punk scene, in one instance harassing a singer from the UK who's been roughed up by Stevo and other patriotic punks.An excellent soundtrack adds another layer to the realism of the film.",4,Poignant and Full of Contradictions,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,1669,"['SLC', 'Punk', 'couple', 'punk/anarchists', 'stuck', 'middle', 'conservative', 'Mormon-dominated', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'mind', 'kids', 'represent', 'more', 'lifestyle', 'anarchism', 'political', 'philosophy', 'Stevo', 'main', 'character', 'narrator', 'self-consciously', 'several', 'points', 'actions', 'attitudes', 'often', 'stand', 'flagrant', 'contradiction', 'punk', 'ethos', 'espouse', 'movie', 'not', 'accurately', 'portray', 'authentic', 'punk', 'anarchist', 'philosophy', 'accurately', 'poignantly', 'portray', 'widespread', 'popular', 'bastardization', 'still', 'relevant', 'social', 'commentary', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'poignant', 'affecting', 'particularly', 'tragedy', 'Heroin', 'Bob', 'ironically', 'named', 'aversion', 'needles', 'movie', 'undercurrent', 'dissonance', 'anti-oppression', 'philosophy', 'characters', 'aimless', 'testosterone-fueled', 'adventures', 'Stevo', 'friends', 'rail', 'fascism', 'glorify', 'violence', 'act', 'ways', 'perpetuate', 'macho', 'dominant', 'culture', 'Fights', 'are', 'way', 'life', 'one', 'scene', 'Stevo', 'who', 'earlier', 'nobody', 'anybody', 'woman', 'someone', 'else', 'proceeds', 'beat', 'daylights', 'rival', 'who', 'invading', 'territory', 'less', 'obvious', 'irony', 'Stevo', 'well', 'patriotism', 'great', 'lengths', 'extol', 'superiority', 'America', 'punk', 'scene', 'one', 'instance', 'harassing', 'singer', 'UK', 'who', 'been', 'roughed', 'up', 'Stevo', 'other', 'patriotic', 'punks.An', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'layer', 'realism', 'film']",N/A
