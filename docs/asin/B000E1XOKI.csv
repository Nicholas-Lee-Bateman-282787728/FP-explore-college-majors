The only compaint if there is such one is I wish they showed the full complete show. The DVD says it isn't the full show, what a shame if true, but with running time of an hour, I think it is or close to it. If your a Waylon fan and dont have this DVD yet, get it! No way you'll be disappointed. Another good Waylon DVD is Live at the US festival 1983.",5,Best Waylon DVD there is,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,439,"['love', 'DVD', 'Great', '5.1', 'mix', 'great', 'video', 'quality', 'great', '1989', 'show', 'Waylon', 'only', 'compaint', 'such', 'one', 'wish', 'showed', 'full', 'complete', 'show', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'full', 'show', 'what', 'shame', 'true', 'running', 'time', 'hour', 'think', 'close', 'Waylon', 'fan', 'dont', 'have', 'DVD', 'yet', 'get', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'good', 'Waylon', 'DVD', 'Live', 'US', 'festival', '1983']",N/A

The audio choice of DTS 5.1 makes it sound like you are siting in the very room Waylon is playing. Waylon to me is the second best country singer behind George Jones and man he sure does deliver a great performance on this DVD. His wife Jessie even makes an appearance on 2 of the songs. I recommend this  DVD to any country music fan. We sure need more country music singers in this world like Mr. Jennings.,5,Waylon puts on a 5 star performance.,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,533,"['56', 'minutes', 'Waylon', 'doing', 'greatest', 'songs', 'doing', 'songs', 'other', 'singers', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'want', 'audio', 'choice', 'DTS', '5.1', 'sound', 'are', 'siting', 'very', 'room', 'Waylon', 'playing', 'Waylon', 'second', 'best', 'country', 'singer', 'George', 'Jones', 'man', 'sure', 'deliver', 'great', 'performance', 'DVD', 'wife', 'Jessie', 'even', 'appearance', '2', 'songs', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'country', 'music', 'fan', 'sure', 'need', 'more', 'country', 'music', 'singers', 'world', 'Mr.', 'Jennings']",N/A

Waylon is accompanied by a great band (which features daughter Jennifer Eddy singing backup), and a special treat is the appearance by Jessi Colter, Waylon's wife and a fine artist in her own right.

He is 52 and has put on some weight but his attitude is great, his personality really shows and his singing is terrific.  He is a seasoned performer and comfortable in his skin.  He exudes warmth and humor.  The duet with Jessi Coulter is great.  He shows that while he may be older and wiser and sober, he is still the king.  Oh wait, that's Bob Wills (grinning).
