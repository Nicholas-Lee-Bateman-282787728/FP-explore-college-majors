I know its was basic off a Brian De Palma movie. I hope it was good. The only reason I gave this two start because of Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea. I like both actors. This script was horror and the ending was even worse. It made no since. I some movies try to have a weird ending or open ended. This movie should be watch at it. Its not the worse movie I've seen. I recommend in this case stick with the original. I got the original on Netflix instant. If you must see this film use ur netflix or rent it from redbox.,2,Go Watch the Orignial,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,600,"['actually', 'remake', 'first', 'then', 'original', 'remake', 'show', 'up', 'showtime', 'know', 'was', 'basic', 'off', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'movie', 'hope', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'start', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'actors', 'script', 'was', 'horror', 'ending', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'made', 'movies', 'try', 'have', 'weird', 'ending', 'open', 'ended', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watch', 'not', 'worse', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recommend', 'case', 'stick', 'original', 'got', 'original', 'Netflix', 'instant', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'use', 'ur', 'netflix', 'rent', 'redbox']",Sisters
1131864,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0011NVC16,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I'm not much of a fan of medical doctors.  Their priorities in life are the following:  1.  Don't get sued.  2.  Pay off student loans.  3.  Family - their families, not yours.  4.  God - if they believe in a higher power, which most of them don't, so for most, five becomes four.  5.  Help their patients, as long as this does not intrude on any of the previous priorities.So for me, when the main character -- Lou Doillon, who is actually really good here -- says to the Chloe Sevigny character -- who is also really good -- ""I'm sick of doctors,"" Ms. Doillon's ironic statement rang true for me.  Now, she mostly was a patient of psychologists and psychiatrists, but I believe the same rules as above apply to those doctors as well, even though most of them seem to be no better than psychics.  (Answer me this:  if psychiatrists actually knew what they were doing, do you believe that modern-day mass murders would occur so much?)""Sisters,"" which seems to deal with the yin and yang of peoples' psyches, is actually fairly strong once you get past the beginning.  I thought that the opening scene was somewhat confusing; I didn't know who the main characters were, and they were just thrown in as if we were supposed to know them.  But the remainder of the first act was good, and it got really good in the second act.  But then, it seems that, as life imitates art, ""Sisters"" just came apart in the third.I was as confused by parts of the David-Lynchian-style ending just as much as the Sevigny character, not necessarily knowing what was real and what was imagined.  That might have been the point I suppose, but the film just left me feeling a little groggy.  But what I did understand I just didn't really buy here; I think that the ending could have been better, more believable perhaps.  However, overall, I really liked the European mood of the film and the soundtrack.  Those really worked for me.It's too bad, as Ms. Sevigny gives another very nice performance here.  But she wasn't quite enough to save ""Sisters.""  Still, I'll go with a mild recommendation on this sibling of a film.  Now, instead of a clone, I want to see the original.",3,Sisters comes apart at the end,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,2151,"[""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'medical', 'doctors', 'priorities', 'life', 'are', 'following', '1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sued', '2', 'Pay', 'off', 'student', 'loans', '3', 'Family', 'families', 'not', 'yours', '4', 'God', 'believe', 'higher', 'power', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'most', 'five', 'becomes', 'four', '5', 'Help', 'patients', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'intrude', 'previous', 'priorities.So', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Lou', 'Doillon', 'who', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'here', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'really', 'good', ""'m"", 'sick', 'doctors', 'Ms.', 'Doillon', 'ironic', 'statement', 'rang', 'true', 'Now', 'mostly', 'was', 'patient', 'psychologists', 'psychiatrists', 'believe', 'same', 'rules', 'apply', 'doctors', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'most', 'seem', 'be', 'no', 'better', 'psychics', 'psychiatrists', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'do', 'believe', 'modern-day', 'mass', 'murders', 'would', 'occur', 'so', 'much', 'Sisters', 'deal', 'yin', 'yang', 'peoples', 'psyches', 'actually', 'fairly', 'strong', 'once', 'get', 'beginning', 'thought', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'were', 'just', 'thrown', 'as', 'were', 'supposed', 'know', 'remainder', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'second', 'act', 'then', 'that', 'life', 'imitates', 'art', 'Sisters', 'just', 'came', 'apart', 'third.I', 'was', 'confused', 'parts', 'David-Lynchian-style', 'ending', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Sevigny', 'character', 'not', 'necessarily', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'imagined', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'point', 'suppose', 'film', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'groggy', 'what', 'did', 'understand', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'here', 'think', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'believable', 'perhaps', 'However', 'overall', 'really', 'liked', 'European', 'mood', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'worked', 'me.It', 'too', 'bad', 'Ms.', 'Sevigny', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'save', 'Sisters', 'Still', ""'ll"", 'go', 'mild', 'recommendation', 'sibling', 'film', 'Now', 'instead', 'clone', 'want', 'see', 'original']",Sisters

It is very original, tense and macabre.This remake is lacking a bit. They took some liberties with the story, which didn't make a big difference until the ending. That's where everything took too big of a turn for my liking. They completely missed the point of the serum and left doors open for a follow up (which I hope they don't do).All acting was done well. Sets were very good and cameras where excellent. No fast forwarding or multiple images, they kept it clean, which I do appreciate.The music... that's another story. It didn't fit. It didn't help to build or keep tension as in the original. Another big piece of the puzzle missing.I would recommend this movie only if you've seen the original. Otherwise, wait until it comes to television, which shouldn't be long.",3,Falls a little short,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,895,"['loved', 'original', 'movie', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'own', 'have', 'watched', 'number', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy', 'very', 'original', 'tense', 'macabre.This', 'remake', 'lacking', 'bit', 'took', 'liberties', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'ending', 'where', 'everything', 'took', 'too', 'big', 'turn', 'liking', 'completely', 'missed', 'point', 'serum', 'left', 'doors', 'open', 'follow', 'up', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', '.All', 'acting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'Sets', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'cameras', 'where', 'excellent', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'multiple', 'images', 'kept', 'clean', 'do', 'appreciate.The', 'music', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'build', 'keep', 'tension', 'original', 'big', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'missing.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Otherwise', 'wait', 'television', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'long']",Sisters
1131866,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B0011NVC16,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[2, 2]","Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' became a B-movie drive-in classic. In 1973 it really packed a powerful shock value for audiences of it's time. Being released just months before 'The Exorcist', Some considered it the most shocking movie ever made. Even warnings were posted within some advertisments making audiences aware of the unsettling nature of the film. I saw De Palma's version when I was 13 and it freaked me out at that age. The original Sisters found it's self laying somewhere between glorified B-film status and horror masterpiece. It remains a genuinely creepy movie even today. This version packs none of the shock value or production quality of the original. Chloe Sevigny's Grace has none of the Spunk and wit Jennifer Salt had in the original role of Grace Collier either. Like Salt, Sevigny has gorgeous and seductive eye's that say a great deal. But still it feels like she's sleep walking through this role, It was this role that had me falling in love with Jen, and the same role has caused me to lose interest in Sevigny. The murder sequences appear to have been built around new ideas for creating ways to shock audiences, but those fall flat as well, and the bloody killing at the end is seriously over the top. I can't imagine anyone drawing that much blood from a simple syringe no matter how many stabs they made at it. I did appreciate the fact that the movie isn't an exact duplicate of the original, and there were some effective moments here and there, but over all this version is just plain lousy and forgettable. If you haven't seen either, See this one then watch Brian De Palma's original thriller and you'll see just how much better the original really is.",1,Terrible!

1131867,A3W074KQ5R2NAU,B0011NVC16,Ryan Clark,"[3, 5]","I could write paragraphs raving about Brian De Palma's original film, but since there are already several well-written reviews that express exactly how I feel about it, I decided I would write a little about this remake, which so far has only one customer review.  When I first heard that there was going to be a remake, I was prepared for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was released rather quietly on video, but it is far better than most of the popular remakes that have come out lately.  The new ending is weak, but other than that, Douglas Buck did a decent job of retelling this story in a way that doesn't deviate far from the original, but has enough surprises to please fans (which is something this film has in common with the 1990 redo of Night of the Living Dead).  Chlo Sevigny and Lou Doillon were very good in their roles, and are probably the next best thing to Jennifer Salt and Margot Kidder.  Doillon in particular has a strange aura about her that makes her fascinating to watch.  One yearns for the odd William Finley as the evil doctor instead of Stephen Rea, but that's a quibble.  Don't expect anything close to the masterpiece of Brian De Palma, and you will likely enjoy this well-made film that deserves to rise from its obscurity.",3,Not bad,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1273,"['could', 'write', 'paragraphs', 'raving', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'already', 'several', 'well-written', 'reviews', 'express', 'exactly', 'how', 'feel', 'decided', 'would', 'write', 'little', 'remake', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'one', 'customer', 'review', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'remake', 'was', 'prepared', 'worst', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'released', 'rather', 'quietly', 'video', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'popular', 'remakes', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'lately', 'new', 'ending', 'weak', 'other', 'Douglas', 'Buck', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'retelling', 'story', 'way', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'far', 'original', 'enough', 'surprises', 'please', 'fans', 'something', 'film', 'common', '1990', 'redo', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'Lou', 'Doillon', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'are', 'probably', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'Jennifer', 'Salt', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Doillon', 'particular', 'strange', 'aura', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'One', 'odd', 'William', 'Finley', 'evil', 'doctor', 'instead', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'quibble', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'close', 'masterpiece', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'film', 'rise', 'obscurity']",Sisters
