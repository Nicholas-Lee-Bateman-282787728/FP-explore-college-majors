Oh well, he hasn't shown--let's leave.&quot;Besides this element of idiocy, it's obvious the &quot;flubber&quot; is extremely powerful, volatile, and potent, and a few people suffer impact injuries due to its strength when added to inanimate objects.

I found this to be one of the worst if not the worst remake of any movie. I found the plot to be too embelished as it made for the relationship between the characters played by Robin Williams and Marsha Gay-Hayden to be one of where it either tried to remake the safe and easy happy ending that's throughout all Disney movies, or it showed to be one where the parties had to wear their hearts out on their sleeves. I also feel that with the Character of ""Flubber"" it was a waste of time considering I don't remember any merchandising from the character. They should've stayed with the bouncing rubber balls from the original. I also feel that with the promotion of the Flubber substance that it was all shallow, and commericial as where in the original it was going to be put to good use in the military, and here it was to make a buck.

80293,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,0788812181,Joshua Koppel,"[4, 6]","Recently I went to a theater showing the Disney remake, Flubber, starring Robin Williams.  Although I still prefer the original The Absent Minded Professor, Flubber was a whole lot of fun.Robin Williams plays a science professor looking for a new form of energy.  As the film opens, Williams is already in danger of missing his own wedding for the third time.  But while guests wait patiently Williams discovers the semi-intelligent Flubber.  Much of the rest of the film is spent trying to win back the heart of his fiance and subsequently save the collage from bankruptcy and closure.  Williams is aided in his endeavors by two robots.  The first is an exceptionally capable housekeeping robot.  The second is a levitating, self-aware intelligence with full emotions.  While fun companions movie-wise, the technical aspects of these robots would be more than enough for Williams to save the college.  In the End Williams wins back his fianc&eacute;, defeats the bad guys trying to close the college and finds a future for Flubber.While Flubber is very enjoyable it seems like the writers added details for the sake of cuteness without thinking about the implications.  Williams is looking for a new energy source yet he has a robot that can defy gravity and powered by simple electricity.  He needs a discovery worth money yet he has two very successful and useful robots, one of them alive.  Flubber itself has been made into some kind of life form.  This may be good for merchandising but one can only wonder about the source of powdered Flubber or the implications of flight resulting from intentionally causing the organism's decay.  Selling the rights to flying cars to Ford made for a funny scene but now there can potentially be millions of semi-responsible drivers flying through the country's airlanes while carrying radioactive materials.  Additionally, a few scenes were changed from the original and are now less plausible.  For instance, in the original, the fianc&eacute; calls the professor when he is late for the wedding again.So if you are looking for fun then this is your movie.  However, if you tend to rebel at inconsistencies and like your plots to make sense, then you might want to avoid this one.

I enjoyed the original more, but if you were to watch this film for the first time, you'd enjoy it. Great music, Williams is on top form, and great computer effects.

80299,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0788812181,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 6]","I am opposed to remakes in general.  Rarely are they as good as the original.  I have thought, and continue to think, that remakes are a way to admit that filmmakers are not as creative as they once were, and a remake begins with a completed product.  Having said all that, I did like this movie.  The movie has problems, but I managed to ignore the problems and have a few good laughs.Professor Philip Brainard (Robin Williams) is a science genius.  Professor Brainard has enough inventions in his house to keep a fleet of patent agents and attorneys busy for years.  However, the movie ignores such trivialities to focus on Professor Brainard's need to develop a cheap source of power.  The story has Brainard focusing on his pursuit of cheap power to the exclusion of his fianc&eacute;e Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden) and his impending marriage to her.  Brainard also seems to be oblivious that Wilson Croft is out to steal his girl, his inventions and sink the college at which they are employed, all at the same time.Robin Williams is in good form, providing laughs throughout the film.  While Fred MacMurray had an air of absent-minded innocence that Williams fails to achieve, Williams brings his own style to the role and does a good job.  Marcia Gay Harden almost seems unnecessary to the film though I did like her character.  Williams's frenetic characterization of Brainard makes everyone else seem mundane in comparison.Two of the biggest stars in this movie are special effects, the flubber and a flying robot.  The flubber sings and dances and squeaks like a mouse.  The robot watches too many soap operas and movies and is jealous of Sara Jean.  The robot works diligently to keep the wedding from happening.This movie does ignore a lot of things in order to keep the plot moving along.  I kept wondering how Brainard created an intelligent flying robot the size of a football.  Brainard also ignores the need for nuclear elements to power his flubber, with the attendant problems associated with nuclear materials.  The missing of the wedding seemed an excessive plot detail, and I found that portion of the plot distracting.I think the original ""Absent-Minded Professor"" movie remains superior to the remake.  However, if you ignore that this movie is a remake and you are able to ignore the inconsistencies, the movie has a number of very funny moments.  I would consider this movie for a family library, though some of the action is quite violent and I would probably limit watching to children ages 7 or 8 and above.
