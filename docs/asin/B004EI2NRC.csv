1398212,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B004EI2NRC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Change of Plans was a half good half really bad movie. The first half was light, interesting and downright fun; the second half, not so much. The film really lost its way about midway.The film starts with a group of friends that get together for dinner. This is incredibly French, they plan for a long time for the dinner, the host cooks and prepares for a long time, who is invited and will they bring a guest, who sits next to who is critical, and finally the dinner conversation is fast furious and interesting. I've lived many of these dinners and absolutely love them. And the first annual dinner is absolutely charming.The dinner turns out to be an annual thing. The director does a really poor job communicating that a year has passed (well except the second dinner, there is a title that says one year later). And, as you might guess, this one is sleeping with that one, and that one loves that one, and this one is being snubbed by that one - all the personalities get in the way. And then something that completely confused me (I hope I wasn't dreaming) one of the characters ends up in a wheel chair. But yet, wait, she isn't in the next scene. Then she is. Then she isn't. Then she is. Then she isn't. I guess it was this point when the film jumped the shark for me.The acting is beautiful; these are all skilled French actors that are wonderful to watch. The women are all beautiful in their unique way. The men are nice looking, but not too nice. Generally, this is a pleasant film to watch, the eye candy is good.The English title is a bit odd, or doesn't really communicate something that runs over and over in this film. Change of Plans is a good name for people just missing an opportunity with somebody else. It is also about people missing the dinner because something has come up. The French title is Le Code as Change - or the code was changed. That has a little different connotation. The recurring theme in the film is people not being able to enter the apartment complex because the door code changed. And the French title suggests that the rules changed or the circumstances changed and somebody was left behind. Change of Plans doesn't really mean any of these things. Oh, it is a subtle point, but the film makes a lot more sense with the French title.The film is not rated and would probably get a PG-13 rating by the MPAA. There is no nudity or strong language translated in the subtitles (although if they were really translating some of the words, there would have been a lot of strong language). There are several scenes in a gynecologist's office with a woman in stirrups and clearly the doctor is working in that region, although private parts are hidden. There are a lot of adult conversations about infidelity and adult things. There is a lot of drinking and smoking. Hey the film is French, what would anybody expect (ah they cut out the nudity, so not everything is French)?The film is a little bit long at an hour and forty minutes. The DVD included a making of featurette and an interview with Danny Boon. Since I had enough with the film, I didn't really care to put myself through those two bonus features. Typically French films have excellent making of featurettes - they spend a lot of time analyzing the film and explaining why they did certain things. I didn't want to know why.I really enjoyed the first half of the film. By the time we got to year three of the dinner, the film just lost all its magic. It became predictable. I didn't really care much about what happened to one character or the other - they mostly got what they deserved.",3,Good First Half - Should Have Ended There,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,3589,"['Change', 'Plans', 'was', 'half', 'good', 'half', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'light', 'interesting', 'downright', 'fun', 'second', 'half', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'really', 'lost', 'way', 'midway.The', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'dinner', 'incredibly', 'French', 'plan', 'long', 'time', 'dinner', 'host', 'cooks', 'prepares', 'long', 'time', 'who', 'invited', 'will', 'bring', 'guest', 'who', 'next', 'who', 'critical', 'finally', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'fast', 'furious', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'many', 'dinners', 'absolutely', 'love', 'first', 'annual', 'dinner', 'absolutely', 'charming.The', 'dinner', 'out', 'be', 'annual', 'thing', 'director', 'really', 'poor', 'job', 'communicating', 'year', 'passed', 'well', 'second', 'dinner', 'title', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'might', 'guess', 'one', 'sleeping', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'being', 'snubbed', 'one', 'personalities', 'get', 'way', 'then', 'something', 'completely', 'confused', 'hope', 'was', ""n't"", 'dreaming', 'one', 'characters', 'up', 'wheel', 'chair', 'yet', 'wait', ""n't"", 'next', 'scene', 'Then', 'Then', ""n't"", 'Then', 'Then', ""n't"", 'guess', 'was', 'point', 'when', 'film', 'jumped', 'shark', 'me.The', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'are', 'skilled', 'French', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'unique', 'way', 'men', 'are', 'nice', 'looking', 'not', 'too', 'nice', 'Generally', 'pleasant', 'film', 'watch', 'eye', 'candy', 'good.The', 'English', 'title', 'bit', 'odd', ""n't"", 'really', 'communicate', 'something', 'over', 'film', 'Change', 'Plans', 'good', 'name', 'people', 'just', 'missing', 'opportunity', 'somebody', 'else', 'also', 'people', 'missing', 'dinner', 'something', 'come', 'up', 'French', 'title', 'Le', 'Code', 'Change', 'code', 'was', 'changed', 'little', 'different', 'connotation', 'recurring', 'theme', 'film', 'people', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'enter', 'apartment', 'complex', 'door', 'code', 'changed', 'French', 'title', 'rules', 'changed', 'circumstances', 'changed', 'somebody', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'Change', 'Plans', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'things', 'Oh', 'subtle', 'point', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'French', 'title.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'nudity', 'strong', 'language', 'translated', 'subtitles', 'were', 'really', 'translating', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'gynecologist', 'office', 'woman', 'stirrups', 'clearly', 'doctor', 'working', 'region', 'private', 'parts', 'are', 'hidden', 'are', 'lot', 'adult', 'conversations', 'infidelity', 'adult', 'things', 'lot', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'Hey', 'film', 'French', 'what', 'would', 'anybody', 'expect', 'cut', 'out', 'nudity', 'not', 'everything', 'French', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'long', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'included', 'making', 'featurette', 'interview', 'Danny', 'Boon', 'had', 'enough', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'put', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'Typically', 'French', 'films', 'have', 'excellent', 'making', 'featurettes', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'analyzing', 'film', 'explaining', 'why', 'did', 'certain', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'why.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'time', 'got', 'year', 'three', 'dinner', 'film', 'just', 'lost', 'magic', 'became', 'predictable', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'mostly', 'got', 'what', 'deserved']",Change of Plans

The humor permeated throughout, in typical French fashion, a melange of sarcasm, causticity, lightness and sincerity.You need to be alert to comprehend who has an affair with whom, as this group befriends each other on one day in June every year. The acting is perfect, the women are elegant and beautiful, the flamenco dancer is passionate and impressive, and the two old guys dancing together to the tune of Paul Anka is simply hilarious!

The truth is that I didn't really like it but I did sit through the whole thing.  I am a sucker for anything French and this was set in Paris...there is a stunning shot of the Eiffel Tower at night, all lit up, and another brief one of the Arch of Triumph.  Apparently the characters in the film live in a good location.  Another nice thing is the background which is a city wide street music festival that looks like a lot of fun.  Another good element is the final scene with a Flamenco dancer in great costumes.  I'm trying hard to find justification for my high score.There are some good actors, I guess.  My problem with the film is the really dopey script.  It tries to be clever and I suppose some people will find it so.  A group of middle aged people have love affairs with other people, some married, some not.  They change partners in the midst of the film for various reasons, a surprise pregnancy, a crippling accient.  People find different jobs and lose them... It's one of those ideas that sounds good on paper but didn't work out very well. Most of the characters are just not very likable and I couldn't really care about them.
