Every actor was more-or-less spot on! It had a great, almost cel shaded bubble gum style and look to it! It even had a great story! So, you ask, where did it fail? Car-fu. Well, the Wachowski brothers seem to have forgotten this is a story about racing and turned the whole thing into a story about aggressive ""car-fu"" driving. Now I, for one, feel NASCAR is boring but grand-prix and rally is not. Did they feel they couldn't make racing interesting? Hell, Talledega Nights almost made me feel NASCAR was exciting, imagine if these two (usually) talented directors had actually put effort into interesting and exciting race sequences! Alas, it was not to be and for me the lack of racing dropped this otherwise excellent movie a whole star and a half. It is worth a watch if your a fan of the old show, just know what your getting into.

But the racing scenes are fun too.*The cars and all their gadgets are pretty cool.  The race tracks are a series of wild, loopy circuits (which reminded me of certain computer games.  Could also be a bad thing, because it is so wild, but I found it imaginative and cool).*There is a cool kung-fu fight towards the end.  Also a few nifty shootout scenes.*Pretty good story.  Contains a good amount of action, drama, comedy, and romance.*Good cast of characters.*Great writing.*Music is not bad.The Bad Things*The film bombards you with transitions and weird effects, and although it can be seen as hypnotic and stylish, it is also goofy and kind of dizzying.  I think it also detracts a lot from the action scenes.*Some of the antics are a little too goofy (although this can be a good thing, because it corresponds to the cartoonish style).*The racing scenes themselves, although cool and fun, are also very fast, and it can be hard to see what's going on.  Whatever you do, don't blink!*A few scenes contain flashbacks that are intercut together, and can be convoluted (although you might also say that this is unique and stylish).This movie has its share of coolness, with the fast and furious racing scenes, nifty background effects, and some awesome writing.  At the same time, there are a lot of cartoon effects, some of which are great (like the backgrounds and the wild racing), some of which are goofy or weird (like some of the time-lapse effects, or the goofy antics), and some of which are annoying (like all of the transitions where people's heads move across the screen...I got pretty sick of it).  Still, it's vivid and entertaining.  Older kids should have a blast with it.  Fans of the original cartoon may enjoy it.

The cartoon is the first thing I remember watching on our new color TV. The movie was cast perfectly, with everyone's looks and mannerisms similar to what I recall. The plot was a more sophisticated version of the cartoons, complex enough to survive 90 minutes.Where did the movie go astray? It tried too hard to be modern. Rather than create a new product based on the old, like the Spiderman and Superman franchises, it tried to blow us away with a sense of what Speed Racer could be.I was going along happily until Spritle flipped off the bad guys in an elevator. While the movie was hardly profanity-laden, it had Speed, Racer X and several other protagonists using course language. This was unnecessary to plot and character development and showed weak screen writing.Racing scenes mimicked some of the old hyperbolism of the 1960s version, but took it too far. The CGI and other animation were colorful and amazing artistically, but left all sense of drama behind. I couldn't follow which car was which in the blur of jumps and loops. It was like my old Hot Wheels set on LSD.Christina Ricci looked like Trixie. With her, the personality update was OK in that she was less of an airhead Betty Boop and more of a genuine, confident woman. Speed Racer's relationship with her pushed what I would be comfortable letting a young child see. While nothing happens, a scene at Inspiration Point is led along until Spritle and Chim-Chim are found in the car.Many aspects of Speed's personality are rich and right on the money. His disdain for school as a child and the implication Trixie cheated to help him graduate was a poor choice.John Goodman cast as Pops Racer was brilliant. He had the look and feel of what I would expect of a guy running a racing company.Paulie Litt is terrific as Spritle. An actor to watch. In a DVD extra, he takes viewers around a tour of the studio during which production people explain their role in developing the film. He's playful and smart, and I expect we will see more from him.The plot is solid. When billionaire E.P. Arnold Royalton wants Speed to race for him, Speed is intrigued. For good reason too. Royalton offers incredible training, resources and glamor, as well as the promise that his family will be free from financial worry. The trouble is races are fixed. Speed's integrity is challenged. He fights back against corruption by rejecting the impressive offer, but Royalton pushes right back with a bounty on Speed in the next race. Racer X gets involved, as does another racer looking to escape from Royalton's clutches.Overall, my expectations were higher. While marketed to young viewers, the race scenes, profanity and romantic themes might be too much. For me, not so young, this was the case. I was confused at times, and disheartened. I am glad I didn't see this in the theater.Anthony Trendl[...]",3,"Almost a Great Movie, But Disappointing",1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,2907,"['wanted', 'like', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'lot', 'grew', 'up', 'cartoon', 'first', 'thing', 'remember', 'watching', 'new', 'color', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'everyone', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'similar', 'what', 'recall', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'version', 'cartoons', 'complex', 'enough', 'survive', '90', 'minutes.Where', 'did', 'movie', 'go', 'astray', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'modern', 'Rather', 'create', 'new', 'product', 'based', 'old', 'Spiderman', 'Superman', 'tried', 'blow', 'away', 'sense', 'what', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'could', 'be.I', 'was', 'going', 'along', 'happily', 'Spritle', 'flipped', 'off', 'bad', 'guys', 'elevator', 'movie', 'was', 'hardly', 'profanity-laden', 'had', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'X', 'several', 'other', 'protagonists', 'using', 'course', 'language', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'showed', 'weak', 'screen', 'writing.Racing', 'scenes', 'mimicked', 'old', 'hyperbolism', '1960s', 'version', 'took', 'too', 'far', 'CGI', 'other', 'animation', 'were', 'colorful', 'amazing', 'artistically', 'left', 'sense', 'drama', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'car', 'was', 'blur', 'jumps', 'loops', 'was', 'old', 'Hot', 'Wheels', 'set', 'LSD.Christina', 'Ricci', 'looked', 'Trixie', 'personality', 'update', 'was', 'OK', 'was', 'less', 'airhead', 'Betty', 'Boop', 'more', 'genuine', 'confident', 'woman', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'relationship', 'pushed', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'letting', 'young', 'child', 'see', 'nothing', 'happens', 'scene', 'Inspiration', 'Point', 'led', 'Spritle', 'Chim-Chim', 'are', 'found', 'car.Many', 'aspects', 'Speed', 'personality', 'are', 'rich', 'right', 'money', 'disdain', 'school', 'child', 'implication', 'Trixie', 'cheated', 'help', 'graduate', 'was', 'poor', 'choice.John', 'Goodman', 'cast', 'Pops', 'Racer', 'was', 'brilliant', 'had', 'look', 'feel', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'guy', 'running', 'racing', 'company.Paulie', 'Litt', 'terrific', 'Spritle', 'actor', 'watch', 'DVD', 'extra', 'viewers', 'tour', 'studio', 'production', 'people', 'explain', 'role', 'developing', 'film', 'playful', 'smart', 'expect', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'him.The', 'plot', 'solid', 'When', 'billionaire', 'E.P', 'Arnold', 'Royalton', 'Speed', 'race', 'Speed', 'intrigued', 'good', 'reason', 'too', 'Royalton', 'incredible', 'training', 'resources', 'glamor', 'as', 'well', 'promise', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'free', 'financial', 'worry', 'trouble', 'races', 'are', 'fixed', 'Speed', 'integrity', 'challenged', 'back', 'corruption', 'rejecting', 'impressive', 'offer', 'Royalton', 'pushes', 'right', 'back', 'bounty', 'Speed', 'next', 'race', 'Racer', 'X', 'involved', 'racer', 'looking', 'escape', 'Royalton', 'clutches.Overall', 'expectations', 'were', 'higher', 'marketed', 'young', 'viewers', 'race', 'scenes', 'profanity', 'romantic', 'themes', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'was', 'case', 'was', 'confused', 'times', 'disheartened', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'theater.Anthony', 'Trendl', '[', ']']",N/A

Emile did a fine job in the lead, Spridle was well done, John Goodman, Christinna, etc. The original series was always melodramtic and over the top with Speed saves the day or even the world but the film-makers took that and used it about as well as could be done.The dialogue does make you cringe at times but overall it is a very enjoyable ride and fans of the original series will not be disappointed at all. We even get the Chim-Chim Spridle double-team in trench coat. As for the DVD itself; few extras, just a couple of entertaining shorts, and no commentary.

And with that theme comes the tug-of-war between fairness and corruption, on and off the track.Clocking in at a bulky 135 minutes, actor Emile Hirsch does a credible job as Speed Racer, while John Goodman (Pops) is the talented driver's father and car designer in a family business. The plot bogs down, though, due to multiple story lines which do not enhance what should have been a powerful theme of family values and the quest for truth on a track of lies.In life imitating art, a promotional tie-in was with NASCAR's Petty Enterprises, as its famous #43 car advertised the movie in a race.

I got what I expected and I agree that at times I felt a headache coming on just trying to figure out what was going on in the races with frenetic, chaotic camera action and endless explosions and spinning, flipping, jumping, looping, and crashing constantly going on.However, the surprise, atleast for me anyway, was the story.  I respect Susan Sarandon as an Oscar winning actress and wondered why she would take on this role, aside from the money.  I can see why.Other reviewers have complained of too much dialogue, but to me, behind the action, that's the HEART of the story. It's about family loyalty.  John Goodman and Susan Sarandon play their parts well and believeable as car racing parents and Christina Ricci as Trixie as well as the humorous well matched child and chimp combo made me remember the characters from the series and I admired the constant bonding throughout the movie.  Matthew Fox also for me made this movie great as being the tormented but determined lost brother Racer X.  It's a movie about good vs. evil and good coming out the winner.Several times throughout the movie, I was like C'MON!!!  The racing was too much, I am looking forward to watching the animated series again with its simpler, understandable racing action.  Luckily, there is one racing sequence, a cross country rally during the course of the movie which was a bit easier to follow.I guess perhaps I went into this movie without a lot of expectations and was taken by some different elements than what many other viewers caught.  To each his own opinion, I respect that, but I liked this movie not for the blazing, over the top, slam bang crash special effects, but what I feel the directors made beyond the racing.It's all about family and I got the message.Sincerely,William",4,I hope I'm not the Lone Ranger in pulling something different out of this movie,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,1999,"['knew', 'coming', 'theater', 'was', 'store', 'more', 'futuristic', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'series', 'car', 'races', 'given', 'today', 'relentless', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'top', 'competition', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'movies', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'agree', 'times', 'felt', 'headache', 'coming', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'races', 'frenetic', 'chaotic', 'camera', 'action', 'endless', 'explosions', 'spinning', 'flipping', 'jumping', 'looping', 'crashing', 'constantly', 'going', 'on.However', 'surprise', 'atleast', 'anyway', 'was', 'story', 'respect', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'wondered', 'why', 'would', 'take', 'role', 'aside', 'money', 'can', 'see', 'why.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'action', 'HEART', 'story', 'family', 'loyalty', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'believeable', 'car', 'racing', 'parents', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'as', 'Trixie', 'as', 'well', 'humorous', 'well', 'matched', 'child', 'chimp', 'combo', 'made', 'remember', 'characters', 'series', 'admired', 'constant', 'bonding', 'movie', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'being', 'tormented', 'determined', 'lost', 'brother', 'Racer', 'X', 'movie', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'good', 'coming', 'out', 'winner.Several', 'times', 'movie', 'was', ""C'MON"", 'racing', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'animated', 'series', 'again', 'simpler', 'understandable', 'racing', 'action', 'Luckily', 'one', 'racing', 'sequence', 'cross', 'country', 'rally', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'easier', 'follow.I', 'guess', 'perhaps', 'went', 'movie', 'lot', 'expectations', 'was', 'taken', 'different', 'elements', 'what', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'caught', 'own', 'opinion', 'respect', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'blazing', 'top', 'slam', 'bang', 'crash', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'feel', 'directors', 'made', 'racing.It', 'family', 'got', 'message.Sincerely', 'William']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 4]","Being both heavily intoThe Matrix Trilogyand the originalSpeed Racer cartoonof the late 60s, I went into this re-imagining with high hopes. I figured surely the Wachowski brothers could do it justice if anyone could.I had to think back to my childhood and remember if the cartoon was really that good, and I must say that, in its day, it was. It was also probably the first anime I'd ever seen, and I enjoyed the style immensely. But one has to wonder if that style would translate well to a feature film in today's market.Although there must certainly be fans of this film out-and-about, you won't find one here. Why? you might ask. For me, it was the complete lack of a coherent story flow. Anime isn't necessarily known for this anyway, which was why I questioned Speed Racer being made into a movie in the first place. I think the Hollywood big-wigs must've thought that they could tug the memory-strings of those who'd grown up with the cartoon series and get them to plop down hard-earned cash at the box office. Not to mention attaching big name directors and stars to it. Undoubtedly the film did well because of these aforementioned items. But if you're looking for anything approaching substance, you won't find it here.The film is a zig-zagging, nonstop, car race (for the most part) that leaves no time for the audiences eyes to rest. This created a sort of disorientation for me, in that I felt I was being pushed (or dragged) along throughout the entire film. It was like the film makers didn't want you to rest and think about ...anything. ""Just enjoy the cool cars, the excess colors, and all this action,"" is what they seemed to be saying. Although Emile Hirsch (Milk) did an okay job with what he was given, I simply didn't care about him or his family in any way, shape or form because I never got to know them (we were always ""racing"" from one car race to the next).That said, I did discover some things that worried me as a kid:1. Pops Racer hasn't died of high blood pressure. He's got his temper semi-under control.2. Sparky is gay. For sure. Did you see the way he looked at Speedy's butt?3. Mom Racer needs to get laid. Desperately. She's too wound up.4.Racer X. Is he Speedy's long, lost brother. Well ...you'll have to watch and find out.I have to wonder if kids who can't sit through stories that develop good characters wouldn't enjoy this flick. It moves so fast that I don't think it'd give them time to care.

Perhaps the best example of that is the big hand to hand fight up in the mountains; whatever you think of the movie in general, that scene is a spectacular technical achievement.  Indeed, one cannot fault the Wachowskis on a technical basis in any film; they push the envelope in production design and photographic technique in every production.  However, I didn't buy into the live-action-as-cartoon concept, and the story left me cold.  Perhaps that's because I was never a huge ""Speed Racer"" fan growing up.  My wife was much more so than I, but even she didn't care for the movie so much.The performances are good; the actors are not the problem.  John Goodman is as good as he's been for a while (he's always an asset to a movie), Christina Ricci does a great job with the kind of part she hasn't really had before, and Matthew Fox turns in a good performance as Racer X for a promising big-screen debut.  (It helps that Racer X is not altogether different a character than Jack Shepard.)  Emile Hirsch is a fine Speed Racer, but he is burdened with playing the Oliver Twist of this movie.  Speed Racer is the title character, but like Oliver Twist, is the cipher at the center of the proceedings; a character that is a catalyst for other events but whom at the end of the tale we still hardly know.""Speed Racer"" is a kids' film, but in my view fails as such.  It's too long, takes too long to really get moving plot-wise, and has a little too much language for kids.  I'm not a language prude; the language in ""Speed Racer"" is mild.  And I don't really mind if my daughter hears that in other contexts.  I suppose my objection to it is its gratuitous appearance, particularly in a film obviously oriented toward children.If you are interested in this movie, I would recommend a rent before purchasing if you haven't seen it before.",2,Disappointing,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2044,"['How', 'much', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'partially', 'how', 'much', 'buy', 'central', 'concept', 'movie', 'live-action', 'film', 'made', 'as', 'cartoon-like', 'possible', 'art', 'direction', 'production', 'values', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'example', 'big', 'hand', 'hand', 'fight', 'up', 'mountains', 'think', 'movie', 'general', 'scene', 'spectacular', 'technical', 'achievement', 'Indeed', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'Wachowskis', 'technical', 'basis', 'film', 'push', 'envelope', 'production', 'design', 'photographic', 'technique', 'production', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'live-action-as-cartoon', 'concept', 'story', 'left', 'cold', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', 'wife', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'so', 'much.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'problem', 'John', 'Goodman', 'as', 'good', 'been', 'while', 'always', 'asset', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'great', 'job', 'kind', 'part', ""n't"", 'really', 'had', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'good', 'performance', 'Racer', 'X', 'promising', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'Racer', 'X', 'not', 'altogether', 'different', 'character', 'Jack', 'Shepard', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'fine', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'burdened', 'playing', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'movie', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'title', 'character', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'cipher', 'center', 'proceedings', 'character', 'catalyst', 'other', 'events', 'whom', 'end', 'tale', 'still', 'hardly', 'know', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'kids', 'film', 'view', 'such', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'long', 'really', 'get', 'moving', 'plot-wise', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'language', 'kids', ""'m"", 'not', 'language', 'prude', 'language', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'mild', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'daughter', 'other', 'contexts', 'suppose', 'objection', 'gratuitous', 'appearance', 'particularly', 'film', 'obviously', 'oriented', 'children.If', 'are', 'interested', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'rent', 'purchasing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen']",N/A
1175702,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B001CD6FKI,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","As I wrote, there are two types of people who will like this movie: people who watched Speed Racer (and, I suppose, liked it) and those (like me) who are curious because they liked ""The Matrix"" or follow the Wachowskis.I think the Wachowskis (Andy and Lana both co-wrote and directed this) are a unique pair of film makers, and are in their own way like Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers: people who make movies for themselves and so be it.  This list is not exclusive--it might include, say, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan--nor does it have to consist of brothers (Tarantino, for example), but I think it takes an unusual and insular ""team"" to resist the pressures of others successfully.To get to my point, I think those who gave this film a negative review tend to see a movie like this without understanding the talents and ambitions of the particular film maker(s).  I don't intend to denigrate those viewers, who may spend their money and think of others as they wish, but I do think that those who DO appreciate, say, the Wachowskis can disregared the reviews of those who don't ""get"" them.For my part, ""Speed Racer"" is quite a movie.  I wasn't a fan of the TV show, as I was too old and too interested in what I felt were ""hipper"" things,  But I caught an episode here and there, so I knew how difficult is would be to recreate the spirit of the show in ""live"" format.  But I think the Wachowskis, and the actors, did a great job.For those considering seeing this movie, please watch the show--even one or two episodes--to better follow this movie.  The plot is not the object of this movie--Speed Racer's love for racing is central here, as he and his family resist the lure of big corporations even though it means those bigwigs will be gunning for him throughout the movie.  What matters when you see this movie is appreciating how successfully these film makers accomplished their transformation.""Speed Racer"" is an imaginative tour de force, with so much going on in any one shot that it is almost too much to take in.  The crazy race tracks, the wild animations of light streaks and starbursts, the dizzying sense of motion, the evil and ever-constant machinations of Speed's fellow racers, the rainbow of colors of race cars (against Speed's dazzling white vehicle)--it's all in tandem, and I wouldn't recommend seeing it if you're prone to headaches.The acting is what you'd expect, but it's better than a lot of knock off films like ""The Flinstones"" or ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" (though John Goodman is in all those, too).  Emile Hirsch, a young actor I tend to like a lot, is fine as Speed, and the rest of the cast is fine, too: Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox as Racer X.  You don't expect Oscar performances here, but they did their jobs credibly and were assets to the film.All in all, see ""Speed Racer"" if you were a fan of the show.  If not, I'm not sure you're going to like this very busy and, yes, ambitious movie.  But if you were a fan I think you will see how terrific the Wachowskis are as movie crafters--how technically perfect this movie is.  It's a shame it did not do better at the box office: its $90 milllion worldwide take did not match its $120 million budget.  Too bad--I hope they succeed at their next one (see below), because I want this creative team to keep making films that suit them.A note: the Wachowskis' next movie will adapt David Mitchell's ""Cloud Atlas."" a very ambitious and imaginative novel itself, and will star Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon and other greats.

Most viewers will also most likely be familiar with the Wachowski Brothers biggest work, the Matrix Trilogy. They have delivered again with this fast paced, colourful and beautifully designed anime adaptation. I say beautiful but I can't really describe it any other way except to call the whole thing magnificent. The Wachowski's are real visionaries when it comes to movie making. With Speed Racer they took their artistic genius and put a whole new spin on it. The races are fast paced and truly artistic when displaying the race backgrounds, colours and general sequences involving crashes are unashamedly cartoon-like. Even the fight scenes are insanely ridiculous but unbelievably fun.The story starts with a kid who has natural racing instincts and idolises his brother, Rex Racer who at the time is one of the greatest auto mobile racers of the time. His brother Rex is unfortunately killed in a race after signing with another racing team and leaving the family team. Speed grows up to become one of the best racers in the world racing for his team Racer Motors. One day he's offered an extremely generous offer from the slimy, yet extremely rich Mr. Royalton, owner of the conglomerate Royalton Industries. Speed has always been taught by his family never to trust these big corporations as they are responsible for the death of his brother. He turns down Mr. Royalton's offer. Bitter about the rejection Royalton starts to reveal how he's deluded about racing and how companies have been fixing races for years in exchange for profit. He threatens to destroy the Racer family and Speeds future of racing. After making good on his initial threats, Speed bands together with his girlfriend Trixie, his one time rival Racer X and Taejo Togokhan and enters into the Casa Cristo 5000. A deadly cross country rally in an effort to expose Royalton and his companies corruption.You will have to watch the film to find out what happens next, just trust me when I say you're not going to be disappointed. This movie is just shockingly great, it's not only good on the CGI side of things, but it's also supported by an excellent story and cast. I love Emile Hirsch's work and he doesn't disappoint in this cult favourite role. The real gem of this film has to be Roger Allam. His role as the sleazy and manipulative Royalton really comes off well and he's a character that you really come to dispise. He's not a massively known actor, but when in a role of this kind and pulling it off so well, you have to wonder why he isn't bigger than he is.A wonderful movie that is enjoyable for the whole family.

Based upon the early ""Japanimation"" TV seriesSpeed Racer: The Complete Classic Series Collection, one of the first examples of anime ever to be seen in the U.S., it's the story of a family that overcomes loss, corporate shenanigans, and the limitations of time and flesh to ultimately come home in triumph.  Young Speed (Emile Hirsch) is the son of independent race-car designer Pops Racer (John Goodman) and his wife (Sisan Sarandon); he grew up idolizing his older brother Rex (Scott Porter), who was supposedly killed in a racing accident some 10 years ago, and never wanted anything but to be just as good a driver himself.  When a wealthy industrialist (Roger Allam) whose fuel cells drive every car, plane, and helicopter in the world offers him a tempting package to race exclusively for his stable, Speed hesitates, but in the end he realizes he has to stay independent, as his father and brother did.  With the help of his parents, their mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry), his food-loving little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) who he suspects may be Rex, and his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), a daring helicopter pilot, he takes part first in a gruelling team road race, then in a defining ""stunt"" race where all bets, and gloves, are off as the unscrupulous Royalton angles for the wealth and power that his team's victory will bring him.  Dazzling special effects, imaginative cars, nasty villains (there are some scary bits), and the leavening effect of family love and loyalty blend into a strangely satisfying whole that kids should find entrancing and even grownups may like more than they thought they would.",4,Anime made live,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1798,"['Many', 'critics', 'seem', 'think', 'neon-bright', 'movie', 'overdone', 'found', 'exciting', 'fast-moving', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Based', 'early', 'Japanimation', 'TV', 'seriesSpeed', 'Racer', 'Complete', 'Classic', 'Series', 'Collection', 'one', 'first', 'examples', 'anime', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'U.S.', 'story', 'family', 'loss', 'corporate', 'shenanigans', 'limitations', 'time', 'flesh', 'ultimately', 'come', 'home', 'triumph', 'Young', 'Speed', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'son', 'independent', 'race-car', 'designer', 'Pops', 'Racer', 'John', 'Goodman', 'wife', 'Sisan', 'Sarandon', 'grew', 'up', 'idolizing', 'older', 'brother', 'Rex', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'racing', 'accident', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'wanted', 'anything', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'driver', 'When', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'fuel', 'cells', 'drive', 'car', 'plane', 'helicopter', 'world', 'tempting', 'package', 'race', 'exclusively', 'stable', 'Speed', 'end', 'stay', 'independent', 'father', 'brother', 'did', 'help', 'parents', 'mechanic', 'Sparky', 'Kick', 'Gurry', 'food-loving', 'little', 'brother', 'Spritle', 'Paulie', 'Litt', 'mysterious', 'Racer', 'X', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'Rex', 'girlfriend', 'Trixie', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'daring', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'part', 'first', 'gruelling', 'team', 'road', 'race', 'then', 'defining', 'stunt', 'race', 'where', 'bets', 'gloves', 'are', 'off', 'unscrupulous', 'Royalton', 'angles', 'wealth', 'power', 'team', 'victory', 'will', 'bring', 'Dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'imaginative', 'cars', 'nasty', 'villains', 'are', 'scary', 'bits', 'leavening', 'effect', 'family', 'love', 'loyalty', 'blend', 'strangely', 'satisfying', 'whole', 'kids', 'should', 'find', 'entrancing', 'even', 'grownups', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'thought', 'would']",N/A

What I ended up seeing was a lot of critics who had it right and in some aspects had it very wrong.First of all, SPEED RACER is actually a pretty good movie that really only went wrong, in my opinion, in one place. It's isn't a great action movie, but it's dazzling in a lot of ways. First of all, the quirkiness of the movie was unsettling at first.... the many race commentors ranting and raving in different languages was strange. The cartoonish demeanor and delivery of lines and entire scenes was, at first, strange, but ultimately, I found them neat. Different. Different is always good.The color scheme was almost too blown out. Every single scene, every setting, every turn of the camera has you looking at a backdrop that looks like it was ripped out of a Van Gogh painting. This movie would be awesome for potheads.SPEED RACER was trying to be a cartoonish live action film and it succeeded in many aspects, but one thing bugged me to no end. The race scenes were fast furious and jarring, but much of it went by so fast that you wish they would slow down a skew just to get a good grasp as to what just happened. Why did he spin out of control? Who the heck is this person trying to run him off the road?Remember when the new Star Wars movies came out and they were over CG'd. We remember the original Star Wars and how REAL it looked... and then the new movie looked like the same sort of thing you can get with your PS2. SPEED RACER is 10x that. OVER CG'd to the hilt. Over CG'd beyond its time. It tried to be ground breaking... but ultimately was overkill.It's a good movie with 1 less star for the hyperactive scenes that left you wishing they had more tact than ego.",3,Sensory OVERLOAD,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1822,"['came', 'SPEED', 'RACER', 'expecting', 'overblown', 'CG', ""'d"", 'attempt', 'big', 'budget', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'failed', 'just', 'critics', 'said', 'What', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'was', 'lot', 'critics', 'who', 'had', 'right', 'aspects', 'had', 'very', 'wrong.First', 'SPEED', 'RACER', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'went', 'wrong', 'opinion', 'one', 'place', ""n't"", 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'dazzling', 'lot', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'quirkiness', 'movie', 'was', 'unsettling', 'first', 'many', 'race', 'commentors', 'ranting', 'raving', 'different', 'languages', 'was', 'strange', 'cartoonish', 'demeanor', 'delivery', 'lines', 'entire', 'scenes', 'was', 'first', 'strange', 'ultimately', 'found', 'neat', 'Different', 'Different', 'always', 'good.The', 'color', 'scheme', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'blown', 'out', 'single', 'scene', 'setting', 'turn', 'camera', 'looking', 'backdrop', 'was', 'ripped', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'painting', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'potheads.SPEED', 'RACER', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'cartoonish', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'succeeded', 'many', 'aspects', 'one', 'thing', 'bugged', 'end', 'race', 'scenes', 'were', 'fast', 'furious', 'jarring', 'much', 'went', 'fast', 'wish', 'would', 'slow', 'down', 'skew', 'just', 'get', 'good', 'grasp', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'Why', 'did', 'spin', 'control', 'Who', 'heck', 'person', 'trying', 'run', 'off', 'road', 'Remember', 'when', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'were', 'CG', ""'d"", 'remember', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'how', 'REAL', 'looked', 'then', 'new', 'movie', 'looked', 'same', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'PS2', 'SPEED', 'RACER', '10x', 'CG', ""'d"", 'hilt', 'CG', ""'d"", 'time', 'tried', 'be', 'ground', 'breaking', 'ultimately', 'was', 'good', 'movie', '1', 'less', 'star', 'hyperactive', 'scenes', 'left', 'wishing', 'had', 'more', 'tact', 'ego']",N/A
1175712,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001CD6FKI,Chris Pandolfi,"[64, 72]","""When I watch you do some of the things you do,"" says Susan Sarandon in the Wachowski Brothers' ""Speed Racer,"" ""you take my breath away."" This line pretty much sums up how I felt about the movie. ""Speed Racer"" is an absolute visual masterpiece, retooling the look of anime into an exciting, hyper-realized world of vibrant creativity. Every shot is like a cartoon brought to life, the neutral shades of the real world replaced with bold shades of red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and orange. It doesn't present us with a vision of the future so much as it presents an alternate reality, where racing tracks and cars defy gravity. Here's a film you have to see more than once for the imagery alone, because chances are you'll miss more than a few details along the way--every square inch of the screen is packed with visual delights almost all throughout. It isn't often you come across a movie this stunning, this lively, and this fun.Based on the 1960s cartoon series created by Tatsuo Yoshida, ""Speed Racer"" puts it foot on the gas as soon as the Warner Bros. logo appears, interweaving the title character's back story with a heart-pounding race. Even as a young boy, Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) has known nothing other than automobile racing; now as a professional racer himself, Speed is haunted by the death of his big brother, Rex (Scott Porter), a racing superstar who crashed eight years ago on a cross-country rally. The public believed that corporate sponsorship changed Rex into a money-grubbing backstabber, forcing him to turn his back on racing altogether. Naturally, Speed and his family are now completely against sponsorships of any kind, especially his father, appropriately named Pops (John Goodman). For this family, it's about racing, not money.Here enters Royalton (Roger Allam), a slick corporate mogul who tempts Speed with the fame and fortune associated with being sponsored. In essence, Royalton wants Speed to sell his soul, much like Rex sold his. Despite an impressive city suite and the top-of-the-line cars manufactured in a highly efficient factory, Speed refuses to make a deal. Royalton angrily lets him in on a little secret: Car races are always fixed because, contrary to what Speed was raised to believe, making money is what racing is all about. With the help of his girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), and a mysterious masked man known only as Racer X (Matthew Fox), Speed infiltrates a number of races in an attempt to destroy Royalton's reputation as well as the need for corporate sponsorship. This won't be so easy, though; numerous factions are in cahoots with one another, all of which connect with Royalton to some degree.If this sounds absolutely ridiculous, keep in mind that plot is not what ""Speed Racer"" depends on. This movie thrives on imaginative digital effects and spectacular racing sequences, all of which rely on lightening-quick edits and creative camera tricks for maximum entertainment. In this completely fantasy world, racecourses look like oversized Hot Wheels tracks, with sharp inclined curves, completely vertical drops, gaps to jump, and a variety of loops. Speed and his beloved car--the Mach 5--navigate these roller coaster-like twists and turns with ease and accuracy, as one would expect from a cartoon adaptation. Cityscapes are colossal, brightly colored, and sterile, looking much like the Worlds of Tomorrow depicted in science fiction pulp magazines. The sunny sky is a deep, rich shade of light blue, and it's accented with puffball clouds that are pure white. On DVD, one could easily pause a frame of this film and stare at it for hours while absorbing every single detail.Just as impressive are the side characters, all of which add a little something to the story. Speed's youngest brother, Spritle (Paulie Litt), is a loveable scamp who often stows away in the trunk of the Mach 5. Always at his side is Chim Chim, his beloved pet chimp; together, they act as the film's comedy relief. Speed's mother (Susan Sarandon) is a caring woman who can weld car parts after making a mean stack of pancakes. The family mechanic, Sparky (Kick Gurry), absolutely shines during a wonderfully cartoonish martial arts sequence, one that makes you laugh just as much as it makes you cheer.In a nutshell, ""Speed Racer"" has set a new standard for digital filmmaking, a standard previously set by brilliant films such as ""Sin City"" and ""300."" It's sure to snag Oscar nominations for visual effects, costumes, and cinematography, as well it should; watching this movie is an exhilarating experience, a perfect mixture of hard-driving action, childish whimsy, and visual creativity. The abundant imagery acts as a counterpart to Michael Giacchino's score, a cheerful opus that adapts the original theme song ""Go Speed Racer Go."" But all this wouldn't have worked without the actors, all of which were perfectly cast. Hirsch makes the title character both determined and vulnerable. Ricci gives Trixie a wide-eyed innocence that I absolutely loved. Allam is deliciously evil as Royalton, a sniveling, conniving villain you just love to hate. Sarandon and Goodman are convincingly down-to-earth as the parents of a racecar driver. And I have to give a lot of credit to young Paulie Litt, who not only delivered some of the film's best lines, but also played his part in the spirit of good fun. ""Speed Racer"" was all in good fun, definitely one of the year's most entertaining films.",5,"Gentlemen, Start Your Engines!",1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,5449,"['When', 'watch', 'do', 'things',

I'm afraid to open it because I may want to return it given that the little sticker about the digital copy on the front tells some disappointing news. There are barely any extras. What's that about? I know there has to be all sorts of goodies they could have released with it but they're not going to. Not yet anyway. WB has surpassed even Disney's level of greed because in addition to the lack of actual extras, according to the sticker on the front of the copy I bought the Digital Copy (which you have to get *separately* which will take more time and ""additional charges apply"") won't work on anything Mac. Windows Media all the way, apparently. Lame since WM has given me tons of trouble. One of many reasons I switched to Mac. I shouldn't be surprised thought. WB was the one who got the bright idea to make more money by selling a 2 disc version of Harry Potter with all the extras and a movie only version and then charging an arm and a leg for the extras we used to get for a reasonable price.

1175714,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001CD6FKI,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","After 1999's ""The Matrix"", a landmark and all around awesome movie, the Wachowski Brothers...(siblings I should say, one's apparently a girl now) might've took a couple criticisms that the film was too action-y and centered on style so they tried to amp up the depth with the 2 Matrix sequels which was ironic that they were overindulgent in silly action sequences as well as pompous dialogue masquerading as quotes to be discussed in philosophy class. So when their follow-up was announced, a big-budget adaptation of the old ""Speed Racer"", you'd think they'd drop their tendency to look for seriousness when it wasn't required. Well, apparently not since Speed Racer is undoubtedly one of the flashiest movie released this year but it's also too long and attempting too hard at adding depth to the whole thing.In the Racer family, being on the track is everything as elder brother Rex is practically a hero to everyone, notably his younger brother Speed. But after an accident claims Rex's life, Speed takes up the mantle and becomes quite a talented driver which attracts the attention of Royalton, a sponsor who's more concerned with money and the glamour than the racing itself. But when Speed declines the sponsorship contract, Royalton goes out of his way to get Speed off the track and with help from his family, his girlfriend Trixie and the mysterious Racer X, Speed will have to work hard to even survive the race, let alone win.I think anyone who watches this film will most likely walk away feeling that the visuals and the look of the film were definately the highlight so I'll start with that first. Filmed mainly in front of green-screen a la Sin City and 300 (2 other visually impressive-yet-story-deficient films), this movie resembles one flying around on the nighttime Las Vegas casinos at 500 mph or to use an oft-used description, being the ball inside a pinball machine. If you wanted to convert your parents to Blu-Ray or you wanted to show why you spent all that money on your expensive Playstation 3, pop this disc in and cue to any one of the races.It's the stuff in the middle that people will have problems with. While they don't pepper the film with topics about existence, choice, destiny and the like, the Wachowskis still wanted to make a movie that wasn't just about racing so we have characters chatting about sponsorship greed, corruption and the more honest and heartfelt family traditions. While it could be a thinly-veiled metaphor of the independent movie system versus the big studios, it's a bit unneeded and is discussed a bit too much.

1175716,A1DDKF0720PJ72,B001CD6FKI,"Courtney S. Putnam ""C.S. Putnam""","[2, 3]","***SPOILER WARNING ***  First of all, as you may have already noticed, this movie pretty much gets one star or five stars.  Something to consider about this film is the fact that it is PG rather than the ever-popular PG-13 rating (Ironman).  That means this film is geared as much toward children as it is toward adults.  This film is a bold approach in art direction and creativity.  Kind-of the TRON of the 21st Century.  I doubt you will see it on any Academy Award listings but that is not the reason I go see movies.  If that were the case, I would have already seen No Country For Old Men.So now for the review...Take is as you will.  Reviews and opinions are just that.  I will tell you the facts and what I believe to be general good information about the film.  Whether you lay down, near ten bucks to see it, will be a decision you have to make for yourself.  I saw this film at an IMAX theater with my family (wife, 5yr-old son and 9yr-old daughter).  To prepare my son for the onslaught of action, I bought him the entire 60's era Speed Racer series on DVD two months before the release of the film.  When he stepped into the theater, he knew the characters and was prepared for all the action; unlike when he saw Transformers.  In my opinion, IMAX is the only way to go with this film.  I had to travel over an hour to get to an IMAX theater and then pay a premium to see the film, but I think it was worth it.  A week after seeing this film, my son is still asking to go see it again.  What did he like most, you may ask?  Well, remember he is a 5yr-old; he most remembers the scene when Speed is young boy, and is day-dreaming in class about winning a race.  Something about the wacky animation and music connected with my son, somehow.  He still laughs about it.  Currently, he has no less than 8 Mach vehicles in his collection.  The one thing about the film, that was disappointing for my son, was the reveal of Racer X.  In the cartoon, Racer X is Speed's older brother.  In this film, when his identity is revealed, Racer X does not look like Speed's older brother (due to an elaborate plot to fake his death and extensive plastic surgery).  This disappointed my son, because he couldn't understand the whole ""deception/plastic surgery"" thing.  My son said, ""I guess he isn't Speed's brother.  That's not right.""  In any case, this is a small gripe, which shows that some parts of this film will play to an older audience.  When you think about what ""going to the movies"" is all about, this film stacks-up nicely.  There was a lot of effort to do it well, some really great lines, comedy, action and colors galore.  If you just can't sit back and enjoy a flick without having to banter around philosophical discussions of salt shakers and silly expectations, you should probably just go rent a copy of No Country For Old Men...the critics loved that one.",4,Not the Childhood Cartoon You Remember,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,2874,"['***SPOILER', 'WARNING', '***', 'First', 'all', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'noticed', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'star', 'five', 'stars', 'Something', 'consider', 'film', 'fact', 'PG', 'rather', 'ever-popular', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Ironman', 'film', 'geared', 'much', 'children', 'adults', 'film', 'bold', 'approach', 'art', 'direction', 'creativity', 'Kind-of', 'TRON', '21st', 'Century', 'doubt', 'will', 'see', 'Academy', 'Award', 'listings', 'not', 'reason', 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'were', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men.So', 'now', 'review', 'Take', 'will', 'Reviews', 'opinions', 'are', 'just', 'will', 'tell', 'facts', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'general', 'good', 'information', 'film', 'lay', 'down', 'near', 'ten', 'bucks', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'decision', 'have', 'make', 'saw', 'film', 'IMAX', 'theater', 'family', 'wife', '5yr-old', 'son', '9yr-old', 'daughter', 'prepare', 'son', 'onslaught', 'action', 'bought', 'entire', '60', 'era', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'series', 'DVD', 'two', 'months', 'release', 'film', 'When', 'stepped', 'theater', 'knew', 'characters', 'was', 'prepared', 'action', 'when', 'saw', 'Transformers', 'opinion', 'IMAX', 'only', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'had', 'travel', 'hour', 'get', 'IMAX', 'theater', 'then', 'pay', 'premium', 'see', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'week', 'seeing', 'film', 'son', 'still', 'asking', 'go', 'see', 'again', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'most', 'may', 'ask', 'Well', 'remember', '5yr-old', 'most', 'remembers', 'scene', 'when', 'Speed', 'young', 'boy', 'day-dreaming', 'class', 'winning', 'race', 'Something', 'wacky', 'animation', 'music', 'connected', 'son', 'somehow', 'still', 'Currently', 'less', '8', 'Mach', 'vehicles', 'collection', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'disappointing', 'son', 'was', 'reveal', 'Racer', 'X', 'cartoon', 'Racer', 'X', 'Speed', 'older', 'brother', 'film', 'when', 'identity', 'revealed', 'Racer', 'X', 'not', 'look', 'Speed', 'older', 'brother', 'due', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'fake', 'death', 'extensive', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'disappointed', 'son', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'deception/plastic', 'surgery', 'thing', 'My', 'son', 'said', 'guess', ""n't"", 'Speed', 'brother', 'not', 'right', 'case', 'small', 'gripe', 'parts', 'film', 'will', 'play', 'older', 'audience', 'When', 'think', 'what', 'going', 'movies', 'about', 'film', 'stacks-up', 'nicely', 'was', 'lot', 'effort', 'do', 'well', 'really', 'great', 'lines', 'comedy', 'action', 'colors', 'galore', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'flick', 'having', 'banter', 'around', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'salt', 'shakers', 'silly', 'expectations', 'should', 'probably', 'just', 'go', 'rent', 'copy', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'critics', 'loved', 'one']",N/A

1175720,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B001CD6FKI,Danielle Turchiano,"[8, 23]","As brothers, Andrew and Larry Wachowski could not be more different but for the passion they share for seemingly combining filmmaking with gaming.  Often such differences in personalities will clash on-set, leaving a product that never quite finds its flow and instead feels like little skits, each directed in a different voice, but lumped together as one big work.  While their critical hit The Matrix was the first in a long line of morphed-genre works in which the boys walked a dangerous tightrope of style over substance, it managed to find its ground with a common theme and thesis.  Unfortunately their latest release, Speed Racer plummets down the green-screen induced abyss that is postmodern filmmaking, creating and unfortunate mess out of a classic piece of pop culture history from our childhoods.Speed Racer gained acclaim when it was a cartoon, so it should have been comforting to see the Wachowskis tip their hats to the medium that made the franchise famous by incorporating some sequences that, although done with digital technology, felt drawn straight from an anime board.  When overlapping said images with their live action stars and stunts, though, the result felt too campy and cartoonish to be taken as seriously as the emotional storyline seemed to warrant.  Emile Hirsch is the hero and title character (with the budding young star Nicholas Elia playing him as elementary-aged), and the Wachowskis certainly didn't want to waste such raw talent, so they whipped up a convoluted tale of morality in a high speed sport.  All Speed has ever dreamed of is being a race car driver, like his older brother Rex (Scott Porter); his father (John Goodman) owns his own car servicing company, so there is no question he will go into the family business.  When Rex dies in a mysterious crash, Speed is not only competing against drivers who have been paid to take him out, too, but also the ghost of his fallen role model.  Add into the mix the rival company who wants to sign Speed, the question of whether Racer X (Matthew Fox) is really Rex, and the cheating, gambling, and fixing of races (even the Grand Prix!), and the result is a two and a half hour movie with so many characters that flit in and out (and often with bad accents) it's almost hard to keep track of who everyone is, let alone why we should care.  Oh yeah, and to keep with the original cartoon, Speed's girlfriend Trixie (Christina Richie), little brother (Paulie Litt), and pet Chimpanze (?) are along for the ride, too--though they do little but carry out a couple of funny sight gags.It's hard to tell which brother was pushing for the more involved, emotional details and which was fighting for the ""cool"" graphics and motion sequences, but it's obvious that they couldn't come together with a compromise.  Speed Racer is entirely unbalanced: some scenes are so high-octane they hurt your eyes whether you are viewing them in high definition or not, while others drag in comparison with attempts and thoughtful and thought-provoking serious and sentimental moments.The color scheme is so brightly neon, it as if there are fluorescent lights shining behind transparencies of people and objects and projecting false images.  Colors wipe the screen so quickly, it can be assumed the action is to simulate the speed of the cars, but the effect is simply psychedelic without cause.  The futuristic imagery tries too hard to one-up that of the original, but more importantly, the intensity of this dark tale falls flat because the actors are not allowed to explore the depth of their characters and situations but rather are thrown into absurd setting after even more absurd setting.  Ironically, despite the sensory overload of Speed Racer, the events that actually unfold are quite formulaic for this type of film, and by the time the Wachowski Brothers ""officially"" make their reveals, the audience has already been ""in the know"" for the better part of an hour.The special features on the DVD release of Speed Racer include two oddly simple featurettes (when compared with the overblown quality of the feature film), and a digital copy of the film, which if chosen to download, actually costs extra.  ""Speed Racer: Supercharged"" is a standard ""Making Of"" behind-the-scenes look, and ""Spritle in the Big Leagues"" is behind-the-scenes specifically with Paulie Litt, who the producers seem to think will be the next Bob Newhart.As if the bastardizations of Scooby Doo or The Flintstones as live action features weren't enough, the Wachowskis' Speed Racer is yet another to add to that DVD shelf--or better yet, to toss in the trash.",1,"Tries To Do Too Much, Ironically Not Fast Enough",1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,4619,"['brothers', 'Andrew', 'Larry', 'Wachowski', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more',

Remember feeling disappointed when Spritle didn't hit the candy jackpot or laughing hard enough to make the ice cream shoot out your nose every time Chim-chim did something crazy?  Those days are back with this hypercharged remake of the original anime classic.  Speed and all his pals are perfectly in character.  You'll get to find out what Pops Racer was doing before he got involved in racing.  You'll see for the first time what really makes Racer X so motivated to stay anonymous.  You'll even grit your teeth a little when that good for nothing Snake Oiler shows up.  This movie has not been cluttered with any sex, alcohol, drugs or whatever you'd rather keep your kids from seeing, so go ahead and play it for the whole family.  There is some violence, but it's tastefully done without making a bloody gore show out of it.  Best yet, it ties up a few loose ends left by the anime series.  You can't go wrong with this one.Haven't seen any Speed Racer at all?  No problem!

It's certainly better than those cynical ""Transformers"" movies.  Why did it fail to gain an audience on initial release?  I can surmise that its audience were probably forty-somethings like myself who didn't go to the movies as much.  Flaws in the movie are overlength(2 hours, 15 minutes) and possible preachiness.  The movie espouses an anti-corporate bias.  Strange because it was distributed by Warner Communications.  The Wachowski Brothers don't just deliver the message they bludgeon it.  Regardless, if you can overlook the preachiness ""Speed Racer"" is a lot of fun.  The effects are jaw-dropping and they don't overwhelm the story or performances which are generally good.

1175723,A137SY2CCOWTP6,B001CD6FKI,David Kenney,"[2, 2]","Speed Racer is older than I am, that is, the series ran for 52 episodes in the United States from 1967 -1968 the year I was born. Which means by the time I was 6 or 7 when I began to watch it, the show was already in re-runs. But man, did I love Speed Racer. Admittedly, I probably didn't understand the story very much, but if I had overheard you say, ""the car acrobatic team"" or ""snake oiler"" I would have known that you were talking about my favorite show.In 2008, the Wachoiski brothers released their version of the franchise, and admittedly I was one of the first few to see it and at the time I was really dissapointed. Being a huge fan of the Wachowski's and their work with the Matrix, I was sure this was going to be an over the top thrill ride. Ever since then, I have not had the opportunity to watch the film again to give it a second chance.  I had always picked the DVD up and stared at it, my inner child telling me to buy it and watch it just one more time.""You hated that movie, didn't you?"" My wife says.""Yea,"" I put it back on the shelf.Well, I wish it hadn't taken me until the blu-ray was only $7 but I bought it to watch it one more time and I am sure glad that I did. Now, looking back - the Wachowski's were ahead of their time! Speed Racer is exactly what it should be, an over the top thrill ride moving at the pace of a T-180!First of all, despite the anime style and the green screen effects, the script and the actors are the heart of this film. If you took away the glam and glitter there would still be a good movie here with a lot of heart. Plus, Matthew Fox does an amazing job mimicking Peter Fernandez from the American voice overs.I think for the critics who said the movie was too cartoony or too fake - it only proves how much the Wachowski's stayed true to the original cartoon. Lots of other movies were already on the market shot in this style: Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 300 and Sin City to name a few. If they had tried to modernize it like the other franchises have done, I think they would have been equally criticized for ""changing a classic.""The Wachowski's Speed Racer is an awesome movie and deserves a second chance from all of us.",5,Speed Racer [Blu-ray],1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2199,"['Speed', 'Racer', 'older', 'am', 'series', 'ran', '52', 'episodes', 'United', 'States', '1967', 'year', 'was', 'born', 'Which', 'time', 'was', '6', '7', 'when', 'began', 'watch', 'show', 'was', 'already', 're-runs', 'man', 'did', 'love', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Admittedly', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'had', 'say', 'car', 'acrobatic', 'team', 'snake', 'oiler', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'were', 'talking', 'favorite', 'show.In', '2008', 'Wachoiski', 'brothers', 'released', 'version', 'franchise', 'admittedly', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'few', 'see', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'dissapointed', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Wachowski', 'work', 'Matrix', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'top', 'thrill', 'ride', 'Ever', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'had', 'always', 'picked', 'DVD', 'up', 'stared', 'inner', 'child', 'telling', 'buy', 'watch', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'hated', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'wife', 'Yea', 'put', 'back', 'shelf.Well', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'taken', 'blu-ray', 'was', 'only', '7', 'bought', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'am', 'sure', 'glad', 'did', 'Now', 'looking', 'back', 'Wachowski', 'were', 'ahead', 'time', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'thrill', 'ride', 'moving', 'pace', 'T-180', 'First', 'all', 'anime', 'style', 'green', 'screen', 'effects', 'script', 'actors', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'took', 'away', 'glam', 'glitter', 'there', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'lot', 'heart', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'amazing', 'job', 'mimicking', 'Peter', 'Fernandez', 'American', 'voice', 'overs.I', 'think', 'critics', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'cartoony', 'too', 'fake', 'only', 'how', 'much', 'Wachowski', 'stayed', 'true', 'original', 'cartoon', 'Lots', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'already', 'market', 'shot', 'style', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', '300', 'Sin', 'City', 'name', 'few', 'had', 'tried', 'modernize', 'other', 'franchises', 'have', 'done', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'criticized', 'changing', 'classic', 'Wachowski', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'awesome', 'movie', 'second', 'chance']",N/A

But I was really blown away at how good this movie was. The plot was excellent; I loved the ""father/ son"" & ""Greed"" issues that occur in the film but what really pulled all of that together was the cast. The cast had great chemistry and it was a lot of fun seeing them work off of each other. I also like how they played around with the timeline of the film, I have never seen that before and you definitely have to see it to understand what I mean. (Check out the opening scene) And finally, the CGI was extremely well done; I liked how this film used it to create a completely fictional world for the characters to live in; allowing the film more freedom to do things that wouldn't be believable in a more realistic setting.

Speed Racer kept me thrilled, excited and loving every minute of it.  From the car crashes and different racers to the characters that play their roles very well including Speed, Trixie, Pops, his mom and Racer X.  I loved the detail on the cars and the different weapons that each of them had.Speed was motivated because of his brothers death.  Whether or not that was his only focus.  I don't know but i do know that he used that all of that anger, hate and everything to make himself and his family that much better.  I loved the villians in the movie and a couple that you might not see as villians because of their ultimate aims.  But when i was done watching the movie.  I felt that everyone involved did a good job of faithfully recreating that same feel that I got.

1175730,A1W0PUJUZ9IMZU,B001CD6FKI,Dr. W,"[1, 2]","(review of film only, not format)When I first heard about a Wachowski follow-up to the Matrix, I was excited, but when I heard it was Speed Racer (a cartoon that for some reason none of us watched or it didn't even air in my part of the country), when I remembered it was their name on the horrible V for Vendetta, and when the official reviews trashed it, I just let it speed by.  My mistake!This movie is thrilling, exciting, funny, and is as much an invention in ways of storytelling as The Matrix was (and has none of the drudgery that V for Vendetta has).The official reviewers, Berardinelli and Ebert amongst them, must just be getting too old - they don't seem to understand that there's a new kind of storytelling going on here.  I don't have names yet for what it is or how it's done, but if you've seen the film you know what I mean.  Quick cuts and pans and other ways of getting the plot, characters, and emotions to move along and tell a compelling story.The opening scene was absolutely thrilling.  Spliced flashbacks and whirlwind racing, all with a heartwarming story about brothers, duty, memory and doing the right thing - I almost jumped out of my seat and cried in empathy and joy!  The rest of the movie doesn't quite match this scene, but I was still stuck to the screen and cheering for most of it.Bad parts:-Parts of the rest of the film really dragged - lengthy dialogue that served no purpose as far as I could tell.-The tour of the big capitalist's facility dragged on.-Jack Shephard (oh right, Matthew Fox) was great as Racer X, but couldn't he have been more tough looking or something?  He seemed to just stand around a lot.  I loved how he spoke in an obviously ""cool"" voice that didn't help with diction or anything - the camp-ness was great.-A chimpanzee?  Even if it's in the original cartoon, do we really need that?  The chubby younger brother is great, but do we need to do this to the chimpanzee?-What about women?  OK, Speed's girlfriend is important, like Ricci's role in Sleepy Hollow actually, but it's still rather second-fiddle to the guy.  The mom makes pancakes, how cute!  OK, she welds or something too, and gives good advice in one scene, but I just wondered about the portrayal of women in the film. [note after second viewing:  OK, there are many cases where the women take on a strong role, like the mother's advise and praise for the son, Trixie's racing for a while and her piloting of the helicopter and contributions in getting Speed into the race, and Huroko Togukahn who offers Speed the entrance ticket to the Grand Prix and without which Speed would've had no chance.  But still, they seem to play roles that support males].-The races - they were fun and fast and all, but I would challenge any viewer to say just exactly what each car was doing at any given moment.  It was too quick, blurry and rushed to be of any narrative use.  They could've just put a blur in the background and taken the lines from the script (RACE CONTINUES, CARS SPEED BY, SPEED RACER PASSES THEM), since I didn't see anything else going anyway.  I'm willing to let the laws of physics go by the wayside (it's a movie after all, and done by the guys who brought you the guy who learns that the rules of physics don't always apply), but it would be nice if the racing scenes actually propelled the plot.  See, for example, The Road Warrior, where visuals (instead of dialogue) tell the story - the feral kid reaching for the shotgun shell on the hood of the tanker that Mel is driving...  Nothing like that sticks in my head from this film. [second viewing notes: OK, on second viewing, I could follow the ""moves"" of the cars, and it was indeed pretty thrilling, but still not deliberate and purposeful enough].Aside from those criticisms, oh and that its intellectual content is definitely designed for children (unlike The Matrix which could work at many levels), this movie was a blast.  [second viewing note:  well, children may not get the stock market connections or the convoluted plot, but you don't have to in order to get the main idea - so maybe it is a bit layered like The Matrix].[Second viewing note:  If you want to make comparisons, the moral story is a bit like The Matrix, too, in the sense that the hero can not simply defeat evil and lead everyone to a better world.  The scene where Pops and Speed discuss life and racing reminded me of the resolution of Matrix 2 and 3, where Pops is Morpheus envisioning a newer better future, and Speed is Neo, who knows that you can't just defeat evil and the best we can do is live with some kind of limited compromise.  Speed Racer does a better job, though, of satisfying the audience that even if limited results occur, one person's choices and belief can have positive outcomes for everyone.  As another comparison, consider Speed Racer and Iron Man - both have:  a male hero interacting with software-laden machinery powered by a blue-emitting perpetually-renewing micro-size clean-running energy source to achieve super-human feats and defeat cheating/evil/selfishness.  Is that a timeless tale or one specific to our current moment, or a timeless tale as told through the current concerns about renewable energy and integrated software/hardware systems in our portable devices and personal vehicles?]I'm sorry I listened to the official reviewers and didn't see it in the theaters or IMAX.  Something wonderful is going on here that the critics have no idea about.

Sure, I may have caught a segment or two, but even when I was a kid I thought this show was too ""kiddie"". So after the huge, over-hyped movie version crash and burned earlier this year, I was curious to see what went wrong. I'm surprised, what did go wrong here?Let's get one thing straight, this is the type of movie that will give your eyes diabetes. Colors scream at you, objects fly past the screen like lightning, and images are always in constant motion. Audio-wise it's like sleeping inside an engine, with the motor-roars tearing you apart. But at an amazing 2 hours and 12 minutes it just runs too long. Trust me, I didn't need to see the cartoon to know what's going on here, the history is laid out for you in just-too-deep detail. Not that the cast weighs the story down, they're actually pretty good in this, but to me this is one story that could have used a bit of an edit job. And how deep should a plot be for something called Speed Racer anyway?If Speed Racer ever had a Ben-Hur-like episode, this is it. With all the CGI effects, bordering between impressive and ""Oh, C'mon!"", this little Asian to America classic cartoon has been given a royal treatment that quite frankly it didn't deserve. Sure, it's really entertaining in parts, but it didn't have to go as far as being the Star Wars Episode III with racecars either. Looks good, less filling. I honestly can't see any official Speed Racer fan not hitting High Gear with this one. For those fanatics, it's your true blue honoring of the series. But to others like me, after all the special, and I do mean special, effects you may wonder what warranted it in the first place. So what went wrong? They paid tribute to a show with a motion picture that frankly could have been twice as less spectacular and gotten the same overall result.(RedSabbath Rating:7.5/10)",3,"Did You Have To ""Go, Go, Go"" THAT Far In Plot, Speed?",1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,1926,"['First', 'off', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'complete', 'episode', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'life', 'Sure', 'may', 'have', 'caught', 'segment', 'two', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'kiddie', 'So', 'huge', 'over-hyped', 'movie', 'version', 'crash', 'burned', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'what', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'here', 'Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'eyes', 'diabetes', 'Colors', 'scream', 'fly', 'screen', 'lightning', 'images', 'are', 'always', 'constant', 'motion', 'Audio-wise', 'sleeping', 'engine', 'motor-roars', 'tearing', 'apart', 'amazing', '2', 'hours', '12', 'minutes', 'just', 'runs', 'too', 'long', 'Trust', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'cartoon', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'history', 'laid', 'out', 'just-too-deep', 'detail', 'Not', 'cast', 'story', 'down', ""'re"", 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'edit', 'job', 'how', 'deep', 'should', 'plot', 'be', 'something', 'called', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'anyway', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'ever', 'had', 'Ben-Hur-like', 'episode', 'CGI', 'effects', 'bordering', 'impressive', 'Oh', ""C'mon"", 'little', 'Asian', 'America', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'been', 'given', 'royal', 'treatment', 'quite', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Sure', 'really', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'III', 'racecars', 'either', 'Looks', 'good', 'less', 'filling', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'official', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'fan', 'not', 'hitting', 'High', 'Gear', 'one', 'fanatics', 'true', 'blue', 'honoring', 'series', 'others', 'special', 'do', 'mean', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'warranted', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'paid', 'tribute', 'show', 'motion', 'picture', 'frankly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'twice', 'as', 'less', 'spectacular', 'gotten', 'same', 'overall', 'result', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:7.5/10']",N/A
1175735,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B001CD6FKI,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[1, 1]","Coming into Speed Racer, I had very low expectations for the film. I hated the cartoon, it looked a bit childish, and the Wachowski siblings helmed it. What could go wrong? Well, plenty does go wrong, but plenty goes right. Granted, most of these moments have nothing to do with the filmakers and lay solely in the CGI department, but I was surprised with this film, in a good way.This film is a true roller-coaster in more than ways than one. Quality-wise, it goes from interesting, to bad to just plain stupid, which it stays at for awhile. Then when Speed Racer agrees to run the forbidden death race, the film starts taking an uphill turn, going from bad, to just so bad, it's good. I mean, the Ninja scene will cause you to laugh out loud, but not because it's funny, but because it's just SO bad.It's when the death race really starts going where the visuals start carrying the movie. The crashes, the environments, the action, the falls and drops all contribute the movie's jaw-droppingly amazing visuals. Several moments produced a verbal 'Wow' for me, making this a must to at least see once in HD. Then in-between races, the movie starts coming together, for most part becoming a good to great movie, depending on what moment you're at. The final race brings the movie all together and really makes it worthwhile, for the most part.Where does the movie go wrong besides the absurdity and stupidity of many ""serious"" scenes written by the Wachowski siblings? Chiefly, the movie tries to hard to appeal to everybody. It doesn't really strike me as a kid's movie, mainly because of the action, story and visuals will fly over most youngsters heads, but yet, Speed's younger brother and chimp way overstay their welcome. It's a bit cute at the beginning, but then they start cutting into the good stuff. You're then forced to go between the more intense races and fights as such, only to be broken up by the antics of the overly childish duo. I mean, there's kid friendly, then there's stupid. They fall mostly into the latter category.The acting is decent overall, everybody does good with their roles, especially Cristina Ricci, and Matthew Fox does the best with what he's given. However, the movie makes a grave casting error. The role of the evil & cheesy corporate giant Royalton should have been filled by Tim Curry. I mean the no-name who does it in the movie played the character like he was Tim Curry. He sounded like Tim Curry, he acted like Tim Curry, and Tim Curry would have been brilliant in the role, because it was perfect and made for him. Sure it was small, but it bugged me throughout the WHOLE movie.Overall, Speed Racer greatly surprised me, although my fears were both confirmed then denied. It's a whirl-wind of a movie that could have been done better without the Wachowskis, and with a lot of editing, since the film clocks in at over 2 hours. There's lot to love and hate, with most of the love coming from the visual effects department. What's weired is, I actually wouldn't mind a sequel.

1175739,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B001CD6FKI,Graves,"[1, 1]","For many Americans of a certain age Speed Racer was our first exposure to anime back before we knew what that was. The idea someone could make this into a live action film was intriguing.The film focuses on Speed, proper noun, the middle son of the ""Racer "" family, a family based race team that is proudly independent of big corporate influence. Possibly the best driver on the circuit speed is courted by a major corporation for their team.Tempted by the glamour of the major corp, Speed remembers his beloved late brother, Rex, who had left the family to race for a corporation and died in a crash. Rejecting the corporation's offer he is told that racing is fixed and they will ruin him and his family. Speed then takes on the corporations the only way he can, behind the wheel, trying to prove them wrong, or break their deals if there are telling the truth.In the pacing, the look and the characters the film is amazingly true to the anime without going too far and filling in the characters without losing touch of where they came from. Delightedly the music is the original theme from Speed racer- not a modern version but the 1960's pianos and horns that grabbed peoples' imaginations. Bad guys have the bizarre hair style and clothes from the cartoon and while it looks weird, it still works in context.Then why did the film fail so spectacularly in the theatres? Because the CGI literally hurts to look at. The whole thing is done in eye searing, day glow colors. This is fine when you are looking at the race car or the arenas where the racing takes place. This is to some extent show business and needs some glitz. Unfortunately the other scenes are also done in this `whoa-brighter-than-life' mode and it is painful. Race car on the track? Luxury corporate suite? That is ok but when the front lawn seems to have a glow from it, the sky is a blue never seen in nature, and the office walls seem to radiate PURPLE!!!!! it is overwhelming.For all this though Speed Racer is probably a lot better on the small screen than the big.  The smaller screen means the images are not quite as likely to bludgeon your senses and if you need a break you can turn it off and come back to it a few minutes later. In this way it is a fun film for kids and their parents who remember the anime fondly will enjoy it too, just be prepared to look away a few times just to let your eyes recover.",4,Better on the small screen-eye searing CGI defeats plot,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2389,"['many', 'Americans', 'certain', 'age', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'anime', 'back', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'idea', 'someone', 'could', 'make', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'intriguing.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'Speed', 'proper', 'noun', 'middle', 'son', 'Racer', 'family', 'family', 'based', 'race', 'team', 'proudly', 'independent', 'big', 'corporate', 'influence', 'Possibly', 'best', 'driver', 'circuit', 'speed', 'courted', 'major', 'corporation', 'team.Tempted', 'glamour', 'major', 'corp', 'Speed', 'beloved', 'late', 'brother', 'Rex', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'family', 'race', 'corporation', 'died', 'crash', 'Rejecting', 'corporation', 'offer', 'told', 'racing', 'fixed', 'will', 'ruin', 'family', 'Speed', 'then', 'corporations', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'wheel', 'trying', 'prove', 'wrong', 'break', 'deals', 'are', 'telling', 'truth.In', 'pacing', 'look', 'characters', 'film', 'amazingly', 'true', 'anime', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'filling', 'characters', 'losing', 'touch', 'where', 'came', 'Delightedly', 'music', 'original', 'theme', 'Speed', 'racer-', 'not', 'modern', 'version', '1960', 'pianos', 'horns', 'grabbed', 'peoples', 'imaginations', 'Bad', 'guys', 'have', 'bizarre', 'hair', 'style', 'clothes', 'cartoon', 'weird', 'still', 'context.Then', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'fail', 'so', 'spectacularly', 'theatres', 'CGI', 'literally', 'look', 'whole', 'thing', 'done', 'eye', 'searing', 'day', 'glow', 'colors', 'fine', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'race', 'car', 'arenas', 'where', 'racing', 'place', 'extent', 'show', 'business', 'glitz', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'done', 'whoa-brighter-than-life', 'mode', 'painful', 'Race', 'car', 'track', 'Luxury', 'corporate', 'suite', 'ok', 'when', 'front', 'lawn', 'have', 'glow', 'sky', 'blue', 'never', 'seen', 'nature', 'office', 'seem', 'radiate', 'PURPLE', 'overwhelming.For', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'probably', 'lot', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'smaller', 'screen', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'likely', 'bludgeon', 'senses', 'need', 'break', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'come', 'back', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'way', 'fun', 'film', 'kids', 'parents', 'who', 'remember', 'anime', 'fondly', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'look', 'away', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'let', 'eyes', 'recover']",N/A

I did enjoy the anime in the past and the movie is like the anime. If you have seen the anime you know it will have cheesy moments and the race sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Based on one of the first Anime shows to find its way to the States, Speed Racer is a super-CGI, big budget version of the story about a kid and his super car, the Mach-5.In spite of the vertigo-inducing visuals and the big budget, is the movie any good? Not really. The acting is bad, the dialog is hokey and cliche-filled. I kept wishing for the Sprittle character to become a hit-and-run victim.

It's a little children-focused, but entertaining for the whole family.It has not much to do with the innocence and the simplicity of the original Japanese cartoon series and this is one more reason fans of this character should see the movie - to judge by themselves.Basically, this is a story of a little boy who is born and raised by a family of car and speed lovers. They truly believe in the joy and in the real spirit of the racing. Along the way, they end up facing the tough reality of the sport business - competitors, results and championships are determined by the industry, the money men, by the interest of big money corporations. There's no such thing as fair results, authentic competition. Winners and losers are previously chosen before they even compete. Speed Racer's family is even led to believe that the loss of their oldest children by a car accident was caused by this called corporate greed.As Speed and his family are determined to bring the power down, proving that talent and the love for the speed are capable of anything that money just can't buy, mysteries unfold throughout the story and everything end up just fine.

It had been a while since I had been to one because of all the good stuff life brings (job, bills, the overall daily rigamarol). As it was now a rare occasion to go to the movies, I wanted something that truly exemplified a summer movie experience...and no, I'm not talking about Iron Man (while a great movie in its own right, I'm gonna say its slightly overated...so nyah ;). I'm talking IMAX time, folks. And I'm talking Speed Racer!Now, I know, I know. ""Rotten Tomatoes has it at 35% rotten!"" and ""It looks like it's a kids movie!"". Raspberries all around! Pffffffffffft!!! Yes, Speed Racer is a family flick. And yes, the reviews (of which I follow almost religiously) have panned the movie mercilessly. Yet, it seems as if it is a movie that Hollywood and the viewing public just threw out in lieu of other things...other things not as amazingly trippy.(see What Happens In Vegas review by Rye Silverman.)I am not a fan of Speed Racer. I have seen a few eps during my youth and thought they were aight. Yet, I knew the film was magic because I believed in the Bros. Wachowski (even if Larry got that sex change operation, they're still the bros to me), the masterminds behind Bound and Matrix. Yes, I believed in their revolution, even if I didn't believe in their Revolutions. Sometimes, one has to trust in the imaginations of others. Even though the last two Matrix installments blew chunks pretty Speed Racer Christina Riccimuch, the Wachowskis could never be considered lacking in the imagination department. They are mavericks like Tarantino, Rodriguez, etc. People who are trailblazing...and bombing at the box office on the regular (see: Grindhouse...no, seriously F%C#IN see Grindhouse!)Audiences must not have been aware of the radical departure from the norm Speed Racer is. It is long, with an over two hour running time, yet you can't really feel it because you are too busy seizuring out on the floor, your eyes melting as your body turns to gleeful mush. It felt like what it was like to be a kid again and first go on the ""Gravitron"". It felt like the first roller coaster. It felt fresh for once, not phoned in like so many other blockbusters these days. I almost fell to the floor when I stood up to leave, but it was a good dizziness, and an exhalted nausea!So, I beg and plead with you. Here my inept cry (caw!...cough...caw!): this is a movie that anyone can see (except those with vertigo) and smile. It takes you into the first live action cartoon, with a blending of HD tech and a layering effect never before used. The acting is well done, the plot is serviceable, and the experience...the experience is pure cinematic gold.p.s.- I have gone around my job hyping this film in hopes of saving it from its crappy box office. I now sound like a mad lunatic who has taken one too many tabs of acid.

His brother Rex Racer was a hard-charging, risk-taking racer who seemingly loses his life in a dangerous icy cave race.Big corporations, greed, and conspiracy have control of races, dictating the winners for the past 50 years.  Speed Racer and his late brother don't play by those rules, and they must battle the evil influences of win at all costs racing monopolies to not only save racing, but also their family business, respect, and lives.The race scenes are amazing.  If NASCAR were like this in the future, I could see how people would like it.  As it stands now, it's far too boring to just see cars go in circles over and over and over again.  Perhaps if today's racing took some keys from this movie they would improve.  Since this is not only unlikely but also impossible, we will just have to enjoy the impossibility of this movie and its special effects.The action scene special effects are purposefully corny in some circumstances, and do not take away from the overall feel of the movie.  It only adds to the technical masterpiece of cinematography that is displayed.  Jagged and explosive, the oddball combination of a comic book and Japanimation somehow coalesce into a pleasing display of 21st century cinematic achievement.  It really is quite stunning when you think about all the green screen work that was necessary for the film.

Flashbacks of Speed as a dark haired kid watching his brother race, then present day of Speed's dark haired kid brother watching Speed race. After that it mellows out with a plot. The Racer family racing team (that's their name) is bought out or hired by a giant multi-billion dollar company to race for them. Speed grew up idolizing his racer brother and is haunted by his brother's death in a race. There are a slew of rivals sponsored by ""the Cartel"" and a mysterious Racer X that fights against them.Once the plot gets going an hour into the movie it gets much better with a lot more action. One fight in a hotel against a ninja is straight out of the Matrix especially with the musical score.Everything looks futuristic but the Racer family home that is still retro 60s. The cars, buildings and planes are very sci-fi, but the cars still drive on wheels. The racetracks are a feat of computer generated imagery as they twist, turn, divide, swoop up when they curve and hover high in the air. It would make for a nice video game.If you weren't a fan of the cartoon series, you or most likely your kids will watch this movie to see crazy car action. All of the action is cartoonish and not realistic. Cars jump, shoot, leap with robot legs and twirl in circles before regaining their composure. This will clearly miss the Nascar crowd and get the Dr. Seuss crowd despite cursing & violence.The movie is so colorful that it becomes the star. In every frame I keep thinking ""wow that's bright & colorful."" They could be speaking Shakespeare, but the color just gets in the way.Every character is color coordinated like Scooby Doo, but maybe that's the mold of the cartoon. Instead of solving crimes, this is a family of racers and instead of having a dog, they have a monkey. The monkey is never explained, and is pretty much a partner in crime for Speed's kid brother. Even with John Goodman in the movie, everything remotely funny that happens involves the monkey & the kid brother.The movie wraps up nicely after almost 2 hours. Sadly it goes on for an extra 30 minutes, making this movie feel anticlimactic.

1175755,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B001CD6FKI,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 6]","Based on the highly successful cartoon series from the 1960s, ""Speed Racer"" delivers a knockout punch sure to rev up everyone's engine.As a young boy, Speed always looked up to his older brother Rex (Scott Porter).  Rex was a highly successful driver who became legendary with his thrilling driving.  However, Rex became involved with some corporate sponsors who believed racing was all about money.  Rex was now viewed by his fellow drivers as being reckless as well as a thug who was only racing to make money.  So, Rex decided to fake his own death.Meanwhile, Speed (Emile Hirsch) has become a very good driver in his own right.  He has shown the natural ability to win races at the highest level.  This talent has been noticed by E.A. Royalton (Roger Allam), owner of Royalton Racing.  E.A. has decided to try to lure Speed into signing on with his team.  Speed and his family are wooed by Royalton, and soon, Speed is asked to sign on.  He declines, deciding rather to stay on with his father's (John Goodman) independent team.Speed's decision infuriates Royalton to no end, and he vows to ruin Speed and Racer Racing at all costs.  But, Speed, with the help of Trixie (Christina Ricci) and Racer X (Matthew Fox) have a plan of their own in mind for Royalton.  Will they be successful?This is a first-rate movie.  The special effects are some of the best I've seen, and the acting is very good as well.  All of the familiar names from the TV series are included.  Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his sidekick Chim-Chim still manage to get themselves into loads of mischief.  Sparky (Kick Gurry) helps keep the Mach 5 and later, Mach 6, in tip top shape.  Inspector Detector is on the job trying to solve the affairs of Royalton Racing.  Other well-known Speed Racer characters such as Cruncher Block and Snake Oiler make appearances in the movie, too.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects are terrific, and seeing the old names again is loads of fun.

But in no way am I exaggerating when I say that the look of this film is masterful and Stills made of moments of this film belong in a Museum of Modern Art.

The beginning of this movie is stuffed with a lifetime of explanations submerged into a race so handily won by Speed Racer, that indeed no one else can be seen except the ghost of the world record holder in clear doubt of its own reign. There would be little more to the qualifier, yes, besides the chance to rip the record if not for the flashbacks, but the continuum of them all together is confusing to say the least.

The movie is faithful to the cartoon series a few different ways. It's lively with fast talking and a cast that does the characters justice. Emile Hirsch has the right look for Speed Racer and isn't bad here but the supporting cast out shines him. Matthew Fox (Lost, Vantage Point) is surprisingly perfect as Racer X. A mysterious racer who wants to help Speed bring down crooked promoters. While John Goodman does some of his best work in awhile as Speed's father. You believe his love for racing plus watching him fight was actually hilarious. Christina Ricci is super cute as Speed's girlfriend and is well casted as well. While Scott Porter (Friday Night Lights, Prom Night) does fine work as Speed's older brother Rex in flashbacks. He was a great racer that Speed grew-up wanting to be like. So I liked the cast a lot, hell even the monkey in the movie is great lol. The kid who plays Speed's younger brother is a little annoying though I have to admit even if he gets some laughs as well.So if anyone hates this movie I doubt it will be because of the cast. I just found the two fight scenes more entertaining than any of the racing. The effects are eye popping yet I wasn't impressed for some reason. It felt like I was watching Spy Kids 3-D again. I actually would've preferred if the directors took a different approach with the look of the race tracks. A Speed Racer movie actually didn't need so much CGI. It's fine how colorful it looks with the costumes and everything else though. Plus again, the cast was excellent. I just found the effects to be over-done and the direction to be over-done as well. The script is actually a well done good script for a Speed Racer movie. It's just the over-stylized direction that gets boring after awhile.

1175758,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B001CD6FKI,J. O. Booker,"[1, 1]","Watching Speed Racer can lead to tooth decay. I've seen this movie at least four times since it's come out on DVD. I saw it a few hours ago, and I plan on seeing it again this weekend. And anyone who says this movie is ""complicated"" has no business critiqueing movies. The dummy who thinks this film is complicated probably thinks that Scooby Doo got robbed at the Academy Awards.I thought that Speed Racer's storyline was cliche: a small family business resisting corporate takover--how many films have used this premise? But, with Speed Racer, originality seems the least of its concerns; the storyline provides the infrastructure upon which to showcase the latest advancements in CGI technology, and in this sense, Speed Racer is--in its own way--as revolutionary as the Matrix, Larry and Andy's first CGI movie.The color palette is fun--almost oversweet, and when the cars are sliding, flipping, and bouncing around--like Hot Wheels in a pinball machine--the colors are loud and electric and psychotic. The CGI cars defy all the laws of physics stopping on dimes, turning on squares, changing directions in mid-air, dodging bullets, etc. Organic car movies like Bullit, or Ronin, or Mad Max, or Grand Prix are exciting on their own but there's a lot to be said of the artificial CGI cars and their cartoonish behaviors. Speed Racer has the best CGI since Transformers.Speed Racer didn't make a lot of money at the theaters. However, what people must remember is that Speed Racer isn't as high in the public's collective mind as properties such as Batman, Spiderman, and the Hulk are. The latter have been recycled for each successive generation; however, before the Wachowski's announced that they were making Speed Racer, who--besides old heads like me who actually remember watching Speed Racer way back in the '70's--heard of Speed Racer? DVD (and Blu Ray) will vindicate Speed Racer. I wish I could give it six stars. Thoroughly entertaining. Just don't watch it expecting it to be on par with Children Of Paradise or The Red Shoes.

And in some of the martial arts fight-stop-go scenes, especially one with John Goodman, I was slooshed with a moment of a set-up of Goodman just standing there ready to squash the ninja before digitized action thrust him into zoom speed action.(Actually, if I had never digitally filmed my own video, I might not have recognized those scenes, but I have and I did. Did it take away from the movie? No way. Actually, I felt privy to a second of movie making magic.)As for acting, I was awed by everyone, especially the coolly suave Emile Hirsch (looking like a young Charlie Sheen) as Speed Racer; Christina Ricci, who I was sure was really Susan Sarandon's daughter with those big eyes and similar facial expressions; Roger Allam, as the big corporate villain, who played a Michael Caine-like villain almost as well as Caine does himself; John Goodman, who played, well, Goodman as Pops, Speed's father. Stealer of every scene in which he appeared was young Paulie Litt, Speed's little brother, who I was definitely sure was Goodman's real life son because the resemblance was so uncanny.The story line was so complicated and told in such a complicated, back and forth manner, both narratively and visually (you'll have to see the movie to understand as this is a new kind of movie making and story telling, sort of magic realism on screen), that I was certain the Pretend Children would not understand. I quizzed them as I was hip hopping down the street to the car, while the boy was laughing and beseeching me not to embarrass him. I stopped. Their answers indicated complete understanding. Either I have little geniuses or the movie told its story in a less complicated manner than I first believed.Is ""Speed Racer"" a good movie from a 9-year-old's standpoint?

1175768,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B001CD6FKI,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[1, 3]","Okay folks, this one's going to be a dozy; let's talk about ""Speed Racer,"" the new film based off the 60's anime which is being directed by the Wachowski brothers (of ""The Matrix"" fame).  This is going to be a tough one because this movie walks a very fine line between ""high octane fun"" and ""pretty crap.""  I mean that in a good way.  If you've ever seen the Speed Racer cartoon you may have an image of poorly animated races with poorly dubbed dialog in your mind.  You may also have in mind that the cartoon was about a kid who was a race car driver, his family who were mechanics, and their pet monkey Chim-Chim.  Well take that image and imagine it as a live action movie, and the movie would pretty much look as you imagined it would.Well, except for the fact that the movie is animated better.  The story...well, the story doesn't matter really.  It's about how Speed (Emile Hirsch), distraught over how his brother, Rex (Scott Porter), died in a race several years earlier, has now become a top notch racer in his own right and now faces having to deal with sponsors.  A sponsor makes a deal with Speed, but feeling that having a sponsor sponsoring him would betray how he feels about the sport, turns it down.  The sponsor warns Speed that every race, including the Grand Prix races, have all been fixed because the point of racing is to make stock prices go up.  Or, you know, something like that.  Anyway, like I said, all this is pretty much no big deal.The only time the story itself takes off is during scenes where the story ever emotionally involves the viewer is during the scenes where the family discusses the impact Rex's death had on the whole family.  Most particularly this is where Pops (played excellently by John Goodman) provides the movie with it's most emotional scene.  Eh, but what am I talking about.  Kids won't care about Rex's death.  They won't care about Speed's issues with sponsorship, they won't care about his relationship with girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci making her first family film in years), or the fact that Susan Sarandon is getting so few roles that she has to settle for making ""Speed Racer.""  Nah, I'm sure the kids will care most about the car races.  Where Speed races in ice caverns, over volcanos, and these race track loops that look like they were built to KILL people with!The movie is all at once colorful, loud, and frenetic.  Many swirling colors shaded my view after this film was over.  It's pure cotton candy, and the Wachowski brothers prove that they are visual masters regardless of what color pallette they decide to use.  Yet the film also tends to provide a bit too much sugar at times, as the movie is almost non-stop insanity that goes on for more then two hours.  It's enough to make you wish it would slow down, and when it does slow down you wish it would start back up again.  Those who see this film in IMAX would do wise to bring a barf bag.  Visual and story aside though, I'm going to go on a limb and say the movies greatest strength is that the movie takes itself seriously and doesn't go for any inside jokes.Once you start making inside jokes the movie starts to steer towards being camp, but ""Speed Racer"" takes it's material seriously enough so that you never get this feeling that the actors are winking at the camera.  It feels really odd knowing how (at least fundamentally) stupid this film really is.  Still though, the directors are clearly fans of the work, the actors seemed to have fun with their roles, and therefor I had fun at this movie.  And I know I'm going to regret saying this in the morning, but I really do love that monkey.Rating: *** stars",3,Go Speed Racer...Go?,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,3653,"['Okay', 'folks', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'dozy', 'talk', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'new', 'film', 'based', '60', 'anime', 'being', 'directed', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'Matrix', 'fame', 'going', 'be', 'tough', 'one', 'movie', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'high', 'octane', 'fun', 'pretty', 'crap', 'mean', 'good', 'way', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'cartoon', 'may', 'have', 'image', 'poorly', 'animated', 'races', 'poorly', 'dubbed', 'dialog', 'mind', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'mind', 'cartoon', 'was', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'mechanics', 'pet', 'monkey', 'Chim-Chim', 'Well', 'take', 'image', 'imagine', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'look', 'imagined', 'would.Well', 'fact', 'movie', 'animated', 'better', 'story', 'well', 'story', ""n't"", 'matter', 'really', 'how', 'Speed', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'distraught', 'how', 'brother', 'Rex', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'died', 'race', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'now', 'become', 'top', 'notch', 'racer', 'own', 'right', 'now', 'having', 'deal', 'sponsors', 'sponsor', 'deal', 'Speed', 'feeling', 'having', 'sponsor', 'sponsoring', 'would', 'betray', 'how', 'sport', 'down', 'sponsor', 'Speed', 'race', 'including', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'races', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'point', 'racing', 'make', 'stock', 'prices', 'go', 'up', 'know', 'something', 'Anyway', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'big', 'deal.The', 'only', 'time', 'story', 'off', 'scenes', 'where', 'story', 'ever', 'emotionally', 'viewer', 'scenes', 'where', 'family', 'impact', 'Rex', 'death', 'had', 'whole', 'family', 'Most', 'particularly', 'where', 'Pops', 'played', 'excellently', 'John', 'Goodman', 'movie', 'most', 'emotional', 'scene', 'Eh', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Rex', 'death', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Speed', 'issues', 'sponsorship', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Trixie', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'making', 'first', 'family', 'film', 'years', 'fact', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'getting', 'so', 'few', 'roles', 'settle', 'making', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Nah', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'will', 'care', 'most', 'car', 'races', 'Where', 'Speed', 'races', 'ice', 'caverns', 'volcanos', 'race', 'track', 'look', 'were', 'built', 'KILL', 'people', 'movie', 'once', 'colorful', 'loud', 'frenetic', 'Many', 'swirling', 'colors', 'shaded', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'pure', 'cotton', 'candy', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'prove', 'are', 'visual', 'masters', 'regardless', 'what', 'color', 'pallette', 'decide', 'use', 'film', 'also', 'provide', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'sugar', 'times', 'movie', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'insanity', 'more', 'then', 'two', 'hours', 'enough', 'make', 'wish', 'would', 'slow', 'down', 'when', 'slow', 'down', 'wish', 'would', 'start', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'IMAX', 'would', 'do', 'wise', 'bring', 'barf', 'bag', 'Visual', 'story', 'aside', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'limb', 'say', 'movies', 'greatest', 'strength', 'movie', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'go', 'inside', 'jokes.Once', 'start', 'making', 'inside', 'movie', 'steer', 'towards', 'being', 'camp', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'material', 'seriously', 'enough', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'actors', 'are', 'winking', 'camera', 'really', 'odd', 'knowing', 'how', 'least', 'fundamentally', 'stupid', 'film', 'really', 'Still', 'directors', 'are', 'clearly', 'fans', 'work', 'actors', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'roles', 'therefor', 'had', 'fun', 'movie', 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'regret', 'saying', 'morning', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'monkey.Rating', '***', 'stars']",N/A

1175771,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B001CD6FKI,Laszlo Matyas,"[1, 1]","Appropriately, Speed Racer is a movie that can't sit still. It's a jolting, shuddering, bouncing, jet-propelled juggernaut of a movie, an explosion of sound and motion and color and story and personality. Images rocket across the screen with hypnotic intensity. The laws of physics are asked to go take a hike. The very texture of the pictures on the screen refuses to stay static: Raw realism mingles with cartoonish fantasia, colorful abstraction, and CGI dreamscapes.  Its restlessness isn't just special, either. It wreaks havoc with time as well, ducking and weaving and spiraling around events through an endless wormhole of recollections, cut scenes, flashbacks-within-flashbacks, and even a hallucination or two. The opening scene, for example, is an absolute narrative labyrinth, simultaneously relating something in the neighborhood of three overlapping storylines from about half a dozen differing perspectives, cramming humor, action, tragedy, suspense, drama, and raw excitement into a stunningly narrow framework. And then there are the characters, who are so much larger than life that it's hard to believe. The techno-fueled soundtrack, which revamps the original show's theme music (and throws in the guitar solo from ""Free Bird"" for good measure), is similarly explosive.It's an absolute sensory overload of a movie, a vicious Magic Eye painting, a comic book come brutally to life.  It can make viewers drool. It completely transcends that tired clich&eacute; about ""jumping off the screen,"" because that's not what it does. Instead, it sucks viewers into the screen, all but daring them to hang on to their senses as they experience its four electrified dimensions. It's a glorious head-trip.Needless to say, it's also entertaining as hell. If you're a fan of the classic TV show, then you'll be pleased to find that the movie retains that anime's sense of suspense, excitement, humor, and endearingly cheesy embellishment. The race scenes pummel viewers with everything described in the above two paragraphs, while the less intense moments offer a bevy of dazzling eye candy and surreal scenery. The cast is great, too: John Goodman is perfect as Pops Racer, Christina Ricci makes for a wonderfully bubbly Trixie, and Paulie Litt is hilarious and adorable as Speed's younger brother Spirtle. Roger Allam wonderfully unpleasant as the film's villain, and Matthew Fox is appropriately wooden as (The Mysterious) Racer X. There's also a cool monkey.

1175773,A3SSWZCKFB38VI,B001CD6FKI,LazerBlader,"[3, 4]","Perhaps the most underrated film this summer, Speed Racer was a completely enjoyable film to a watch; a wonderful experience that was made to be seen on the big screen. It's hard to understand why so many critics hated this movie. It's got action, style, and heart. Sure it's a ""family film,"" but it's a damn good one. It's rare to find a family film this sweet. Now doubt in my mind, the Wachoski brothers have another hit on their hands but this time around, no one seems to see it.The visual style of Speed Racer is trippy and unique. A wide range of colors filled the screen which equally match the vibrant intensity and fun tone of the film. All the cars have that retro trendy look including the newly-designed Mach 6. And the good ol' Mach 5's never looked better. At times I didn't even realize some of the backdrops were CGI because they were just so stunning to see. The Wachoski Bros have really created a ""live-action anime"" by presenting a look and feel that isn't quite fully 2-D or 3-D. Never before have I seen the artistic creativity as seen in Speed Racer. Sure I wouldn't have minded a full photo-realistic update like what last year's Transformers did, but alas it wouldn't be the same.Another postive aspect of Speed Racer was the sound design and musical score. Thank god the Wachowski's didn't keep the repetitive & droning ""vroom"" sound from the original anime show. Instead there are various sounds of every possible noise a car can make from a super engine revving to the remarkable crashes and stunts seen in the film. What they did keep was the unforgettable echoing ""chyu-chyu-chyu"" of the jump jacks and the Speed Racer theme. The composer of Speed Racer's music, the award-winning Michael Giacchino (Ratatouille, Lost), reworks the original Speed Racer theme to parts of his score along with his own. Speed Racer's music is more than solid and adds much to this already remarkable film. All together, I couldn't have asked more for the sound design of the movie.(*Fact tidbit* The Speed Racer theme song in the US and Japan have the same melody)Kudos to the casting selection because the actors not only look but act and feel like the original characters. Emile Hirsch surprisingly made a great Speed and Christina Ricci's large eyes and sweet demeanor were meant to play Trixie. John Goodman was a spot-on Pops Racer and Susan Sarandon sure felt like a mother as Mom Racer. Lost's Matthew Fox nailed the role of Racer X's mystique and confident valor. The rest of the cast was swell as well - there was definitely an aspiring chemistry between the actors giving Speed Racer a very convincing performance. In addition, I appreciate casting's choice to keep it ethnically diverse with actors like Korean superstar Rain, Australian Kick Gurry, English Roger Allam, Chinese actress Yu Nan, Benno F&uuml;rmann of Germany, and skilled Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada. Last of all on the note of casting, how could I forget the inclusion of Peter Fernandez's cameo as a race commentator? As the director and writer of the US adaptation of the Speed Racer television show as well as the original voice of Speed & Racer X, it would've been a crime not to include this legendary man.A few parts of the film I had mixed feelings on but nothing about the film did I completely dislike. The scenes with Spritle & Chim Chim got pretty stupid and annoying...of course scenes with them in the original show were just that! The story could've been more dynamic and less complex in its presentation. There are some parts in the middle that unfortunately slow down the movie a little and the whole anti-corporations plot line becomes overly wordy in its dialogue. More time could have been spent on fleshing out the backstories presented in the beginning. Those felt somewhat rushed although they were sufficient. Finally, some of the CGI was a bit too cartoony for my taste such as Royalton's factory filled with Segway traveling workers and the bubbling escape pod-like mechanism of the cars.Overall, I loved the Speed Racer movie. It left me completely content and satisfied. Some scenes had me to tears (death of Rex Racer, Speed's final struggle) and others had me on the edge of my seat as cars zoomed about the twisting and curving racetrack. I really couldn't ask more from Speed Racer. Aside from the Death Note films, Speed Racer's one of the best live-action anime adaptations and it's a shame it probably won't be expanded further (the Wachoski Brothers have plot ideas that would make Speed Racer a trilogy but it is unlikely those ideas will be fulfilled after Speed Racer's unfortunate low box-office performance). Hopefully, it can rebound enough from sales of related products and DVD sales to make Warner Bros. reconsider continuing this wonderful start to a trilogy.4 stars out of 5GO SPEED RACER GO!",4,"""It doesn't matter if racing never changes.

As for the movie, I'll admit that I had epileptic fears watching all those color flashes (and I don't even have epilepsy), but the Wachowski brothers have made a masterpiece of a family film.Come on folks; it's based on a manga, turned TV series then translated into a campy, 1967 cartoon, but it is also one of the early pioneers of America's intro to Japanese anime. I think it's fair to say that too often with ""children's"" films, critics are quick to dismantle, dismiss and disrespect the surface of what they see and hear and in doing so, completely overlook the depth of what's really being said.Speed Racer may not go down on black and white as an award winner or blockbuster, mega hit; but it's what's under the hood that counts.. morals with heart.

I remember very little about it, so I can not vouch for its faithfulness to the anime itself.  However, I have watched more anime than most will watch in their life time, and I can honestly say that I have never seen a film capture the spirit of any anime so well before.  The cinematography, the acting, the visual style, everything creates the atmosphere that you are actually watching an anime and not a movie (which is probably the biggest reason this film didn't do as well as it should've financially).  I have to give the Wachowskie brothers kudos for this, as it is not an easy feat to achieve, especially to be able to do it well.The plot revolves around Speed Racer (This is his real name), he comes from a family of racers.  His father, Pops, has his own racing company, and his brother raced for his father previously prior to a tragic accident.  As Speed grows up, he struggles with the same things that his brother previously struggled with, should he sign with a major sponsor which means better gear and a sure financial backing?  Or should he stick to his roots and continue to help support his father?  To tell you anymore would completely ruin any surprise in the film, so I will not divulge anymore.  The major themes in this family is supporting family vs. big business and supporting small businesses vs. big business.The cast is perfect; Christina Ricci is adorable of Speed's girlfriend Trixie, Emile Hirsch is great as Speed, John Goodman is Pops, Susan Surrandon his mother, and Pauli Litt plays Speed's little brother Sprittle which could have been extremely annoying, but instead comes out as a typical child in any anime series.  I have to give the Wachowskie brothers props for being so faithful in spirit to the material, regardless of whether or not the story is faithful, the spirit of the project coincides with the spirit of the Speed Racer anime or any classic anime for that matter.I could not ask for a better live action film version.  The visual style is stunning, and comes off a bit kiddish at first, but that was obviously intentional, and eventually finds a groove as it enters in the racing scenes.  The colors are splashy and bright, there are no dark colors and no earth tones (even the desert race scene is bright!), just brights and neons.  It is a shock to the eyes, but in a good way.The blu ray transfer is crisp and clean, it is a truly beautiful film, and beautiful transfer.  It is too bad this wasn't made when the Real 3D got in to full swing, it would have made an amazing 3D film.If you like fun movies, that are a little bit serious, but not too serious, than you will probably love Speed Racer.

In doing so, the film was good, but the storyline, just as in the animated series, is child-simple.The special effects were numerous and well-done, a virtual vertigo inducing dizzfest for those not spatially oriented!! The Mach 5 underwent some strange changes, and the Mach 6 was a good looking machine.I have only these gripes and observances:I don't like Emile Hirsch's acting style, and he did a bad job of convincing ME that he was Speed Racer, all-out mega-racer, and all-around good guy.Finally! We get to see what Mom Racer looks like!Trixie! How times have changed! You used to be tall and lanky. Now you're short and dumpy.....What happened?!Sparky speaks with an Australian accent? Since when?!Spritle and Chim-Chim could have been deleted from the story, and no one would have noticed.Racer X is NOT Speed's older brother? Oh, face change....Racer X isn't Speed's older brother?! Political intrigue.......Racer X isn't Speed's older brother?!Lastly, the film was too long for the storyline. it could have been done in an hour.My son, who was an avid Speed Racer fan (he would race home after school to watch Speed do his thing), says he didn't like it, because it strayed way too far from the animated series he knows so well.

After watching it, I realized that no trailer can do this movie justice. A few disconnected seconds just can't give you the idea of how exciting, fun (and funny), warm-hearted, and touching this movie is. I rarely watch a movie more than once, and I ended up watching this one three times in the first week, getting more out of it each time.The story builds beautifully and is far more than bright colors and flashy (and great) CG. It is a story of honor and honesty pitted against the evil that men can become when they have too much wealth and power.It is also laugh-out-loud funny. When John Goodman says, ""Ninja? More like a nonja. Terrible what passes for a ninja these days,"" everyone in the room laughed out loud--and not for the first or last time. It wasn't just *what* he was saying; it was how he said it and the implication that he had fought ninjas before.The overbright colors and fantasy cars and driving take a little getting used to, but they completely fit the story, and there are some gorgeous scenes that could not have been done without this style. (Such as the woman who starts the Casa Christo race--the way she walked, her outfit, her superb self-possession--with an improbably long scarf flaring dramatically out in front of a brilliant sunrise.)Of course, on Blu-Ray, the resolution is beautiful.

Even as a boy (Nicholas Elia in these flashbacks), he couldn't concentrate on school but spent the day dreaming about cars.  Of course, he comes by it naturally.  Pops (John Goodman) designs race cars and older brother Rex (Scott Porter) is an up and coming champion.  Things hit a bump when Rex and Pops fight and Rex leaves home only to die amidst allegations of wrong doing.But racing is in the Racer family blood (no surprise with that name), and Speed seemed destined to take the crown.  After making a splash at a local race, he catches the eye of Royalton (Roger Allam) who is a big sponsor of other racers.  He promises Speed the moon, but when Speed turns him down, he turns nasty, threatening Speed and his family.  Now he'll have to team up with the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox).  But can they work together well enough to bring the truth to light?I hadn't intended to see this movie, but after I read a rave review, I went to see it.  And I'm glad I did because I loved it.This movie looks amazing.  The racing involves cars in bright lights zooming by.  That makes it hard to follow at times.  But I loved how it looked.  Even the stuff off the track was filled with vibrant color.  It was just made for Blu-Ray.Now I will admit the story starts slowly and is predictable.  But I got so caught up in things, I really didn't care.  In fact, I was sorry to see it end.  But when we reached that ending, I felt like standing up and cheering.The characters never get too much beyond one dimensional.  But I loved them anyway, rooting for the heroes and booing the villain.Even though this movie was done by the Wachowski Brothers, it isn't one of their adult oriented epics.  Yes, there is a moral to the story, but it isn't hit you in the face.  And everything is in keeping with the PG rating.  In fact, Speed has a younger brother who has a pet chimp, and those two steal every scene they are in.  I loved them.This is a movie designed for a foremost to entertain.  And it did that for me.

He's at an age where he's really into cars, as well as fire engines and trains, and I thought this was right up his alley. I was right. He loved it. It was fast, it was exciting and it was fun for kids. Speed's little brother Sprital and his pet chimp Chim-Chim cracked up every kid in the theater and I have to admit they were pretty funny. The scene where Sprital is offered all the candy he wants made every kid laugh hard. It was creative in ways I would never think of and interesting for both kids and adults. There was a nice little message about family and integrity too. The portrayal of young Speed and his love of racing and his older brother was excellent. One of the best quiet little parts was when lil' Speed gets picked up from school by his big brother, in the Mach 5! What kid wouldn't love that? I don't get why people are saying there is no heart in this movie. It has plenty. I ended up liking the Racer family more in this movie than I ever did in the cartoon. While there are a couple of fight scenes they are more action-y than violent or vicious. Again, Sprital and Chim-Chim leaven the fights with humor.

1175789,A3UK21NY0SBOZ7,B001CD6FKI,Miguel Lescano Cornejo,"[4, 5]","I skipped the theatrical release of this movie because its Tomatometer rating was really low. Well, after watching it on Blu-ray, I can say that from now on I'll be taking the Tomatometer with a grain of salt.Call me crazy and childish, but I actually enjoyed it. No, I'm not a kid, I'm 29. No, I am not a big fan of pop music, I actually prefer Classical. And not, I wasn't a fan of the anime. I remember watching it a couple of times, but I can't remember a thing. But I am a fan of colorful visuals: I liked ""Yellow Submarine"", and I love to stare at Winamp's visualization plug-ins.This is the second over-the-top-colorful live-action movie I've watched. The first one was Shimotsuma Monogatari (poorly translated as Kamikaze Girls), which seems to have been one of the inspirations for this one.Then why 4 stars? Because sometimes the saturation was a bit (well, actually a lot) overdone, specially in Speed's flashbacks  to his childhood and in the Casa Cristo race. And because the chroma keying could have been better.Also, I noticed that following the jumpy timeline can be a bit difficult for slow people. However, I loved it! I have an older brother that falls asleep in almost every movie, no matter how many loud explosions it has (He slept through Transformers!), but he did like this movie, so there was obviously something extra.Don't fret too much about not getting lossless audio: The video is not lossless, either. Instead, a version of the lossy MPEG-4 standard is used. What's even more, all Blu-ray movies suffer from a higher compression of the chroma information (Actually, HALF the resolution) than the luma information, yet no one seems to be complaining about that.In the DVD era, audiophiles often said they could hear the difference between Dolby (which had usually a bitrate 448kpbs) and DTS (768 kbps), yet they were hard pressed to actually tell one from another in double-blind tests. Fast-forward to the Blu-ray era: Today, Blu-rays carrying a regular DTS soundtrack do so at a bitrate of 1.5Mbps, double that of DVD. At this high bitrate, even audio experts can't tell the difference between the compressed DTS track and the lossless original. This characteristic of being indistinguishable from the source is called being ""perceptually transparent"". Dolby says its competing codec achieves the same transparency at 640kbps. What's even more, when you get a DTS track at 1.5Mbps your are getting EXACTLY THE SAME quality audio than what you would get at a DTS-equipped movie theater, which plays the soundtrack from a CD with DTS-encoded audio at exactly 1.5Mbps. And when you download a movie with a Dolby Digital track at 640kbps, you are actually getting BETTER QUALITY audio than the same movie would have at a Dolby Digital-equipped commercial theater (yes, even a THX one), because the 35mm print carries Dolby Digital at just 320kbps.Bottom line: The audible difference between DD@640kbps, DTS@1.5Mbps and lossless audio is, to be blunt, ZERO. There is a difference measurable by computers, of course, but it's not important, as was demonstrated by the decision of the Blu-ray association to downscale the color information of the video.Touting the lossless tracks as the best thing since sliced bred was just marketing hype from Blu-ray and HD DVD to justify the upgrade from DVD among audiophiles. Ironically for the HD DVD group, promotion of the lossless tracks helped Blu-ray win the war: Blu-ray marketing said that you needed all the extra space in a BD disc to fit lossless tracks in several languages.[...]So, buy your movies, plug your BD player to a nice home theater setup, relax and enjoy knowing that you have better quality at home than the local multiplex.",4,Don't worry about the lack of lossless audio,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,3714,"['skipped', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie', 'Tomatometer', 'rating', 'was', 'really', 'low', 'Well', 'watching', 'Blu-ray', 'can', 'say', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'taking', 'Tomatometer', 'grain', 'salt.Call', 'crazy', 'childish', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'kid', ""'m"", '29', 'No', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'pop', 'music', 'actually', 'prefer', 'Classical', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'anime', 'remember', 'watching', 'couple', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thing', 'am', 'fan', 'colorful', 'visuals', 'liked', 'Yellow', 'Submarine', 'love', 'stare', 'Winamp', 'visualization', 'plug-ins.This', 'second', 'over-the-top-colorful', 'live-action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'Shimotsuma', 'Monogatari', 'poorly', 'translated', 'Kamikaze', 'Girls', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'inspirations', 'one.Then', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'sometimes', 'saturation', 'was', 'bit', 'well', 'actually', 'lot', 'overdone', 'specially', 'Speed', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'Casa', 'Cristo', 'race', 'chroma', 'keying', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Also', 'noticed', 'following', 'jumpy', 'timeline', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'difficult', 'slow', 'people', 'However', 'loved', 'have', 'older', 'brother', 'asleep', 'almost', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'loud', 'explosions', 'slept', 'Transformers', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'something', 'extra.Do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'getting', 'lossless', 'audio', 'video', 'not', 'lossless', 'either', 'Instead', 'version', 'lossy', 'MPEG-4', 'standard', 'used', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'Blu-ray', 'movies', 'suffer', 'higher', 'compression', 'chroma', 'information', 'Actually', 'HALF', 'resolution', 'luma', 'information', 'yet', 'one', 'be', 'complaining', 'DVD', 'era', 'audiophiles', 'often', 'said', 'could', 'hear', 'difference', 'Dolby', 'had', 'usually', 'bitrate', '448kpbs', 'DTS', '768', 'kbps', 'yet', 'were', 'hard', 'pressed', 'actually', 'tell', 'one', 'double-blind', 'tests', 'Fast-forward', 'Blu-ray', 'era', 'Today', 'Blu-rays', 'carrying', 'regular', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'do', 'so', 'bitrate', '1.5Mbps', 'double', 'DVD', 'high', 'bitrate', 'even', 'audio', 'experts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'compressed', 'DTS', 'track', 'lossless', 'original', 'characteristic', 'being', 'indistinguishable', 'source', 'called', 'being', 'perceptually', 'transparent', 'Dolby', 'competing', 'codec', 'same', 'transparency', '640kbps', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'get', 'DTS', 'track', '1.5Mbps', 'are', 'getting', 'EXACTLY', 'THE', 'SAME', 'quality', 'audio', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'DTS-equipped', 'movie', 'theater', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'DTS-encoded', 'audio', 'exactly', '1.5Mbps', 'when', 'download', 'movie', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'track', '640kbps', 'are', 'actually', 'getting', 'BETTER', 'QUALITY', 'audio', 'same', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'Dolby', 'Digital-equipped', 'commercial', 'theater', 'yes', 'even', 'THX', 'one', '35mm', 'print', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'just', '320kbps.Bottom', 'line', 'audible', 'difference', 'DD', '@', '640kbps', 'DTS', '@', '1.5Mbps', 'lossless', 'audio', 'be', 'blunt', 'ZERO', 'difference', 'measurable', 'computers', 'course', 'not', 'important', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'decision', 'Blu-ray', 'association', 'downscale', 'color', 'information', 'video.Touting', 'lossless', 'tracks', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bred', 'was', 'just', 'marketing', 'hype', 'Blu-ray', 'HD', 'DVD', 'justify', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'audiophiles', 'Ironically', 'HD', 'DVD', 'group', 'promotion', 'lossless', 'tracks', 'helped', 'Blu-ray', 'win', 'war', 'Blu-ray', 'marketing', 'said', 'needed', 'extra', 'space', 'BD', 'disc', 'fit', 'lossless', 'tracks', 'several', 'languages.', '[', ']', 'So', 'buy', 'movies', 'plug', 'BD', 'player', 'nice', 'home', 'theater', 'setup', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'knowing', 'have', 'better', 'quality', 'home', 'local', 'multiplex']",N/A

Well, now I do!The Wachowski brothers have created a loving tribute to the cartoon, and I love the international flavor of the film. But this is a Speed Racer entirely for today's video-game generation. What a wild ride! I can't believe it was panned by critics. Yeah, there's a lot of eye-candy from beginning to end, but there are also some incredibly poignant moments and a great deal of love in this film. The whole notion of family over industry is huge, and I love that the directors got some of the best actors in the biz to bring this point home. It's also wonderfully written. Some of the speeches of encouragement that the parents give or Racer X gives to Speed actually got me a little choked up.I've seen this film a few times on cable now.

SPEED RACER is the best film of the year thus far, and a perfect example of how artistic, brilliant and smart summer films once were.The Bros. create a ""Speed Racer"" reality for the film that is beyond description.  It's one-part our world, one-part Speedy's universe.  Colors glow brighter than on Christmas day, all portions of the frame are in focus - from the character talking to camera, to the character behind him, to the wonderfully detailed scenes capes behind them both.  What you get are shots and scenes from SPEED RACER that are composed, painted and presented with the same creative level of color, artistry and movement as those found in the top Japanese Anime films AKIRA, GHOST IN THE MACHINE, METROPOLIS and SPIRITED AWAY.  For an American audience unindoctrinated in the world of Anime, this brilliant look, choice and feel is simply lost.  To put this in perspective, it's like casting pearls before swine.  The Bros. also breath life into the stylized SPEED RACER animated series action sequences, combining flat elements such as simple action moves with animated ""movement"" cells and heightened reaction shots to give us fight sequences that move, pop and produce a mile-long smile on everyone's face.Ultimately, this is what holds SPEED RACER back from out grossing simple, less intelligent films such as INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.  SPEED RACER is too smart and too sophisticated for the average audience member.  It runs too fast for America Joe Blow moviegoer to keep up.  For those looking for an intelligent and emotionally involving family summer adventure, hit the track with SPEED.  You'll find yourself racing to keep up, roaring through the turns and thundering into victory lane with a huge grin on your face and the desire to immediately pluck down another $8.50 and see the flick again.

The races are a little confusing at times which is a little frustrating, but the overall feel of the film is very good.The cast is perfect except for Sparky.... who isn't really bad in the role, but does not resemble the original character in the cartoon! I wish there was more of the Mach 5 and the use of it's many weapons and gadgets as the film is over two hours long....you would think there would be plenty of screen time for the use of the gadgets!I'm not bashing the film as it was way better than I expected it to be, but I can understand some fan's frustrations with it. One other problem is you had better have a state of the art monitor to view this film on or your poor TV set will be battling to keep up with the incredible graphics!Speed Racer is a insane ride and for the most part you should be amazed, just be prepared to have some frustration in the process!

When it started, it was so garish and hyperkinetic that I prepared myself for the worst... however, I have to admit that as I watched it, it actually did start to suck me in to this bizarre pseudo reality, and I began rooting for Speed Racer (That's his name, not just his title..).Speed Racer is the car obsessed son in the Racer family, his father the designer of racing cars.  When he starts performing in major races, a huge corporate sponsor woos him, but amazingly, it turns out that the big corporation has money, and not the best interests of the Racer Family, at heart.  A few chases later, via a mysterious ally, an uneasy alliance with a rival Japanese driver, and &lt;ahem> ninjas, we reach the good versus bad confrontation.Nothing about this is real - everything is hyper real in a calculated way - remember, this is adapted from a Japanese anime.  Yet the actors, even in a wide eyed cartoon style way, do gradually do make you accept they might just be believable.  Even if on the podium the winners drink a hyper white milk, rather than any other sparkling drinks...The story linking the action scenes is actually passable, and is actually a welcome relief from the action scenes which could leave you woozy with an overdose of movement and primary colors which are pretty sickly after a while...just remember this is skewed young, yet the story does have a little depth for grown-ups too.The gimmick here is the effects, and though the effect may not be to everyone's cup of tea, the effects are seamless.  This sort of cartoonish hyper reality may just be what cgi was meant for.The movie as a whole is not a complete success.. that's for sure.  But neither is it a disaster.. this is at the very least innovative and imaginative cinema - you wont see another movie like Speed Racer this year, and the derision it received in some quarters smacks of close-mindedness.

Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit are two examples.  For 2009, Speed Racer was the only live-action animated combo movie, and did not do that well at the theaters.  The movie tries to combine several themes, and tries to come of as a serious movie.  There is the overall racing theme of the movie, which of course drives the special effects.  Then there is the requisite romance between Speed Racer (yes the movie is named after the title character) and his girlfriend.  There is also the tense relationship between Speed Racer and his fellow racers in the final cross-country marathon.

Could there possibly be a more appropriate place to drop that epigram than in a review of yet another bloated, unnecessary piece of crap from the Wachowski Brothers? Yes, I do realize the irony. And yet I knew I would eventually have to watch this flick, if only because like many people in their early forties, I was a complete Speed Racer addict back when it was in syndication. (Yeah, I tried the new ""reboot"" TV series a few years back. I lasted about three episodes.) And really, it's not a bad cast, as long as you discount the always-awful Susan Sarandon. And there are a whole lot of people (I am not among them) who thought the first and second Wachowski Brothers flicks were actually really good. (I thought Bound was one of the most boring attempts at noir I'd ever seen, and The Matrix was... just plain awful, really.) So while it was the slimmest of slivers, I had some minor hope in my heart that the Bros Wachowski would find it in their hearts not to completely mess up one of my most beloved childhood memories. More fool me.The thing is, I really do see what it was they were intending to do with all that awful CGI. It's obvious the intent was to make it look as much like the cartoon as possible without delving into actual cels. And in some ways, I admire the attempt. It's a good idea, and maybe someone will eventually get it right. But everything else about this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong.This movie does have a plot, though you have to stay awake long enough for it to get to its point. The Racer family--Speed (played as an adult by Milk's Emile Hirsch, and as a child by White Noise's Nicholas Elia), Pops (John Goodman), Mom (Sarandon), and Spritel (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Paulie Litt, who steals every scene he's in), along with perennial hangers-on Trixie (Christina Ricci, and how nice it is to see her back on the big screen), Sparky (Garage Days' Kick Gurry) and Jim-Jim (played by a pair of chimps), are keeping their independence in a sea of corruption and sponsorship (which are always the same thing) in the racing game. (As with the original series, the main basis for the racing seems to be Formula 1, but digressions are made into other forms for plot purposes.) When Speed turns down a lucrative offer from Royalton (The Queen's Roger Allam), the head of Royalton Racing, Royalton's team goes after him. Meanwhile, Speed gets involved in trying to ferret out racing's criminal elements with the mysterious Racer X (Lost's Matthew Fox) and Taejo (Korean pop superstar Rain). Speed suspects Racer X of being his supposedly-dead brother Rex (Dear John's Scott Porter, in flashback)... well, if I kept going, we'd be here all day. If you've ever seen the original series, you know most of it anyway. (Also, if you know the original series, you'll notice some minor spelling corrections in the names.)And that's one of the big problems: the Wachowskis tried to cram at least half the plot points from the series' original run (52 episodes, in case anyone wasn't counting) into a two-and-a-quarter-hour movie, with the expected results. There's way too much going on here, and I'm sure if you aren't familiar with the series, it's terribly confusing. Hell, it was confusing to me, and I am familiar with the original series. As well, and this was the kicker to me, Speed's character is entirely changed. I know you can't have two-dimensional good guys and bad guys in an action movie anymore, and I have criticized any number of films for not shading their characters better. But Speed Racer himself here isn't shaded; he comes off as much of a thug behind the wheel as his enemies, and that is more depressing than anything else in this movie. There are no good guys, unless you're willing to toe the ""indie by any means necessary"" line far closer than I ever was. (And I didn't read too many reviews of the movie, but didn't anyone else notice the irony of the ""indie or die"" theme being played so strongly in a film with a one hundred twenty million dollar budget that opened on five thousand screens worldwide?)But I do have to give credit where credit is due, and credit is due to both Christina Ricci, a very good actress who has been perennially underutilized by Hollywood, and Paulie Litt. Both of them make the movie worth watching; they're the only things that do. This is an awful, awful film, and both of them do the best they can, but they're wasted on this material. Rumor has it that Alfonso Cuaron was originally attached to this movie. Would that he had directed it.

I am 52 years old, and I absolutely was blown away by 'Speedracer'.I did not grow up with the 'Speedracer' cartoon. I know very little about the storylines. I also have learned that, over the years, not to always listen to critics, especially during the summer when films like 'Iron-Man' are dominating theatres. That said, 'Speedracer', from the makers of 'Matrix', is another extremely imaginative film. 'Speedracer' is FILLED (I emphasize this) with: tons of exciting car action (of course), loads of humor, a lot of tender moments, GREAT special effects, and a lot more action. And the music is fantastic. Watching 'Speedracer' is an experience, like a Disneyland ride. You are sitting in the theatre, but the filmmakers somehow pull you into the action (this wasn't IMAX). It's thrilling. As for the actors? Goodman, Sarandon, Hirsch (as Speedracer) and Christina Ricci, not to mention the rest of the cast, are just having fun with the rest of us. The story is good vs. evil, nothing more. What else do we need from a wonderful thrill ride??? Please don't listen to critics. And please consider what this poorly marketed film has to deal with: 'Iron-Man', next week 'Narnia', then 'Indiana Jones'... The list goes on. No wonder 'Speedracer' gets lost in the shuffle. This is a film that may be before its' time, as was 'Matrix'. Go see 'Speedracer'. It's for the kids. It's for the adults. And it is never offensive.'Speedracer' is so exciting and warm-hearted and funny you will find yourself laughing and cheering all at the same time while you are trying in vain to wipe away the tears in your eyes.

Moyer,"[3, 12]","Wow, that was bad.Unlike the directors' earlier effort, The Matrix, which had a level of substance beneath all of the style, this was all sound and fury signifying nothing.  First of all, there didn't seem to be any physics associated with the cars.  They spin and fly around the track but there's no real sense that they're heading toward a finish line let alone moving in the same direction.  It's more like watching a neon lit demolition derby.When I was a kid, the only car I wanted to own was the Mark V. But in this movie it didn't really stand out from the other race cars. And the fact that it was so easily replaced by the Mark VI for the final race reinforced that feeling. In the cartoon, the Mark V was the ultimate driving machine. It was a car that James Bond wished he could drive. In this movie, it was disposable, just one in a series.  How disappointing.Overall I didn't have a problem with the characters and I'm happy they didn't try to mimic the iconic fast-talking of the cartoon. That said, the coarse language peppered through the script was completely out of place for what should have been a straight up kids movie.And that's the core issue with Speed Racer.  It didn't know who its audience was.  Was it the under 10 set who wouldn't care about the story as long as the interesting visuals kept coming?  Or was it trying to make a kids movie cool enough for teenagers through swearing?To say they missed an opportunity here is too strong a statement.  Speed Racer as 1960 cartoon or modern movie is a confection.  Think of it as cotton candy.  You can't complain that it doesn't fill you up because it isn't meant to.  It's supposed to be a burst of sugar to the system that fades almost as quickly as it arrives.  But by pandering to two audiences at the same time this cotton candy is cheeseburger flavored.  It's too adult for kids, and not adult enough for teenagers.  It's a movie without an audience and it's no wonder it performed so poorly at the box office.",1,"Call AAA, this movie is a flat tire.",1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1993,"['Wow', 'was', 'directors', 'earlier', 'effort', 'Matrix', 'had', 'level', 'substance', 'style', 'was', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing', 'First', 'all', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'physics', 'associated', 'cars', 'spin', 'fly', 'track', 'real', 'sense', ""'re"", 'heading', 'finish', 'line', 'let', 'alone', 'moving', 'same', 'direction', 'more', 'watching', 'neon', 'lit', 'demolition', 'derby.When', 'was', 'kid', 'only', 'car', 'wanted', 'own', 'was', 'Mark', 'V.', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'race', 'cars', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'replaced', 'Mark', 'VI', 'final', 'race', 'reinforced', 'feeling', 'cartoon', 'Mark', 'V', 'was', 'ultimate', 'driving', 'machine', 'was', 'car', 'James', 'Bond', 'wished', 'could', 'drive', 'movie', 'was', 'disposable', 'just', 'one', 'series', 'How', 'disappointing.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'characters', ""'m"", 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'mimic', 'iconic', 'fast-talking', 'cartoon', 'said', 'coarse', 'language', 'peppered', 'script', 'was', 'completely', 'place', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'up', 'kids', 'movie.And', 'core', 'issue', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'audience', 'was', '10', 'set', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'as', 'long', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'kept', 'coming', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'kids', 'movie', 'cool', 'enough', 'teenagers', 'swearing', 'say', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'here', 'too', 'strong', 'statement', 'Speed', 'Racer', '1960', 'cartoon', 'modern', 'movie', 'confection', 'Think', 'cotton', 'candy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', ""n't"", 'fill', 'up', ""n't"", 'meant', 'supposed', 'be', 'burst', 'sugar', 'system', 'almost', 'as', 'quickly', 'pandering', 'two', 'audiences', 'same', 'time', 'cotton', 'candy', 'cheeseburger', 'flavored', 'too', 'adult', 'kids', 'not', 'adult', 'enough', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'audience', 'wonder', 'performed', 'so', 'poorly', 'box', 'office']",N/A

Zwick,"[0, 3]","With its Candyland color scheme, videogame graphics, and surrealistic backdrops, ""Speed Racer"" definitely has the look of an anime series come to life - not a surprise given that the same team responsible for ""The Matrix"" movies, the Wachowski brothers, served as the creative force here. Unfortunately, the cartoonishness extends to the characters as well, and that's where an adult audience quickly loses interest.This gruelingly long film - an absurd two-and-a-quarter hours - features Emile Hirsch as the title character who comes from a long line of racecar builders and drivers, including his father (John Goodman) and older brother (Scott Porter, of everlasting ""Friday Night Lights"" fame), the latter of whom may have had ties to some mighty shady characters and died under mysterious circumstances on a cross-country rally. Now Speed Racer is going to compete on the same course in the hopes of expunging the overwhelming corporate influence that is corrupting and destroying the sport.At least I think that's what the plot was about.  For to tell you the truth, the time-shifting narrative is confused to the point of incoherence at times, and the villains are strictly from cartoon-ville in their over-the-top two-dimensionality. There's even a precocious kid brother and an annoying anthropomorphic chimp around to serve feebly as alleged comic cutups. And, worst of all, the race scenes themselves are so abstracted from reality that they fail to generate any tension or interest in the viewer.  We never find anything or anybody to root for.Ultimately, ""Speed Racer"" leaves us with the question: how can something so impressive to look at be so boring to watch?",2,"Dazzling to look at, boring to watch",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1675,"['Candyland', 'color', 'scheme', 'videogame', 'graphics', 'surrealistic', 'backdrops', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'definitely', 'look', 'anime', 'series', 'come', 'life', 'not', 'surprise', 'given', 'same', 'team', 'responsible', 'Matrix', 'movies', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'served', 'creative', 'force', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'cartoonishness', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'adult', 'audience', 'quickly', 'interest.This', 'gruelingly', 'long', 'film', 'absurd', 'two-and-a-quarter', 'hours', 'features', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'long', 'line', 'racecar', 'builders', 'drivers', 'including', 'father', 'John', 'Goodman', 'older', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'everlasting', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'fame', 'latter', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'ties', 'mighty', 'shady', 'characters', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'cross-country', 'rally', 'Now', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'going', 'compete', 'same', 'course', 'hopes', 'expunging', 'overwhelming', 'corporate', 'influence', 'corrupting', 'destroying', 'sport.At', 'least', 'think', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'about', 'tell', 'truth', 'time-shifting', 'narrative', 'confused', 'point', 'incoherence', 'times', 'villains', 'are', 'strictly', 'cartoon-ville', 'over-the-top', 'two-dimensionality', 'even', 'precocious', 'kid', 'brother', 'annoying', 'anthropomorphic', 'chimp', 'serve', 'feebly', 'alleged', 'comic', 'cutups', 'worst', 'race', 'are', 'so', 'abstracted', 'reality', 'fail', 'generate', 'tension', 'interest', 'viewer', 'never', 'find', 'anything', 'anybody', 'root', 'for.Ultimately', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'something', 'so', 'impressive', 'look', 'be', 'so', 'boring', 'watch']",N/A

I actually did not have the chance to watch this in theaters and I can't say I regret it. I remember watching the Speed Racer cartoons when I was a kid, while I was not a big fan I remember it as a childhood memory as well as the smurfs, transformers, and the like.The MovieI will not get into many details reviewing the movie as there are already too many reviews in here for that. Yes, it is a movie with a very simple story and as far as I remember the movie does not deviate that much from the source material. Watching this film is like watching the cartoon come to life, the shots of the Speed talking to Trixie and Racer X in the middle of a race, Speed jumping out of his car after winning a race and striking his pose, the annoying kid with the chimp, all that made it to the movie. So I may call it nostalgia but while the story was too simple I found myself enjoying the film a lot.The picture quality is unbelievable. I watched this on a 50"" HDTV and it looked incredible, from the childhood sequences with Speed meeting Trixie to the Casa Cristo race, the colors look vibrant and the image looks impeccable. The Wachowski brothers have done it again, the technical achievements of this film make it a great movie to watch and definitely a must if you want to show off your HD home theater system. The audio however could have been better, it sounds ok, but I have other bluray movies that do sound better as they use the audio capabilities bluray has to offer.The ExtrasThe movie has some documentaries on the making of the film and the ""extreme"" racing style they created for the movie. These are presented in a 4:3 presentation and not HD.The bluray presentation has 2 additional discs, a DVD game and a digital copy of the film. While the digital copy is appreciated as I can carry the movie in my Ipod, it isn't really an added value to me (while it might be for someone else)Now the DVD game is not something you can install in your computer, it is actually a DVD that needs to be played in a regular DVD player. Using the racing sequences from the film you can choose to play as one of the characters of the film (this will determine the car and sequence you will play) and then you ""drive"" using the arrows in the remote... does it sound bad and boring? It is worst than it sounds.I have seen lately many releases have the +digital copy as a standard extra, I personally would be more interested in extras concerning the movie and how it was made than a boring DVD videogame and a digital copy of the movie, but that's just me. I don't think I'll use again the two additional discs included with the movie.",5,A visual feast of nostalgia!

I, having remembered MY experiences watching the original, agreed but recognized this as being one of those things a husband must do.I have never been more fortunately wrong.Speed Racer is not just a cartoon being brought to life. It's a story of a family, told with artistry drawn from the anime subgenre and with storytelling methods from all the eras of movies ever made. The sad thing is that this movie may make money, but it's almost dead-certain that the achievements involved in making it won't be really recognized... because it is, after all, ""Speed Racer!""What this movie does... is nothing short of magical. We are introduced to a world in which colors are brighter, where the 1960s meet the Bright Shining Future!!! envisioned in the 1940s, where -- it seems -- extreme auto racing has replaced not merely other sports, but even warfare. Corporations control almost every aspect of the sport, and the battle for supremacy on the track is echoed by the battles in the boardroom... or does the racing echo the boardroom?It focuses on a family -- a startlingly well-adjusted, coherent, loving family, one of VERY few found in American cinema where usually families are fragmented, shattered, traumatized, and dysfunctional; overall, I can only think of a couple of other really overall ""together"" families in cinema -- and one of them is the Addams Family.The Racer family LIVES auto racing -- racing at a level that normally is reserved for jet fighter pilots, on tracks that combine military-level equipment and Department of Transportation highway construction with roller-coaster design sensibilities and with cars that may exceed 800 kilometers per hour (500mph), cars sometimes armed and always with little surprising gadgets hidden away. The family does have an old tragedy in the background, but the focus of the family is on their racing -- building the cars, racing them, and keeping it a family business.As one can predict, the family business and the huge corporations are destined to clash -- violently.I'm not going to go into the details of the plot; it's not necessary. What's important is to know that the background is introduced seamlessly; you come to know this strange world, this unusual family, the power of the corporations, the sport that is central to the action, and all the conflicts that will emerge, in visual and dialogue sequences that interweave and lead into each other perfectly -- you ask a question, it is answered at exactly the right time, to produce exactly the right effect.Not everyone will like this movie. But for those who can, it is perfect. I cannot think of a single aspect of Speed Racer that could be changed without lessening it -- and I don't think there is another movie I can think of about which I could say that. The Wachowskis set out to distill the essence of what made that silly cartoon somehow appealing to a group of fans even over a period of 40 years... and they succeeded.",5,Family-Friendly Art Film?

1175824,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B001CD6FKI,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[2, 3]","Now, I've seen my share of cartoons elevated to live-action in The Big Hollywood Show.  Some were abysmal, likeCasper.  Some actually were pretty good, like the firstScooby-Doomovie.  But while the movies and the originals are related, they're still separate elements, each their own thing.  A cartoon can't be live-action and stay true to its cartoon-ness.  Cartoons offer impossible contortion and endless manipulation of set and scene, action and POV, and most importantly the complete and total abrogation of the laws of physics, not to mention that whole life/death thing.  But then came this movie.  This movie is as true to the originalSpeed Racercartoon as it possibly can be; it is without a doubt the best live-action cartoon that has yet to be made.Now, what do I mean by live-action cartoon?  Well,Shoot 'Em Upis a cartoon, and its success is that it knows this, and doesn't take itself that seriously.  But junk like theThe Fast and the FuriousandThe Transporter Collectionmovies, they pretend to some kind of legitimacy, while telling an action-packed story they're essentially remaining in the realm of the possible, despite physical laws and imperatives going out the window with the first chase scene.A live-action cartoon is not just swapping people and sets for cells and/or backgrounds, auteur production designers for Korean animators, and the mandatory CGI green screen.  It's so much deeper than that.  A true live-action cartoon is about the delicate translation of the unique cartoon cosmos, the rhythm and feel of the original cartoon into live action, about pacing and timbre and capturing the essence--nay, the very soul!--of a that 2-D rendering in the immensely challenging venue of full-on 3-D, with real actors.Of course, the CGI helps immensely, and this movie has got it like mad.  But, despite the numbing presence and absolutely crucial role CGI plays in setting the scenes and keeping the action excruciatingly intense, the computer power does not overwhelm and take over the film, as so unpleasantly was the case in theThe Golden Compass,Narnia, etc.If you're a deep fan of the original Speed Racer cartoon, you'll love this film.  You'll see more in the characters, the scenes, the posing and in the action than others will.  You've got the original Speed Racer theme song, pumped up and roaring.  You've got Spritle and Chim-Chim in the trunk, with the candy.  You've got the cartoon-impossible car-racing action, right out of the original show, with the gadgets and flips and spins.  You've even got Speed's classic pose from the end of the opening credits, if you're quick enough to catch it.Two of the film's fight scenes, one with the family in a hotel room and the other with the bad guys in a mountain wayside are what made this film for me.  Both are right out of the original cartoon, with Pops wading in with his moustachio'd, huge-armed ferocity and hilarity.  The editing and pacing are right out of the cartoon, with the moves and even the camera angles so very similar.  This was as live-action as it could get, and they worked as original/derived action sequences, while evoking the sweet childhood memory of afternoons sneaking off to a buddy's house to watch the cartoon.The cartoon fantasy starts immediately.  Physics as we live it is completely irrelevant, with cars traveling somewhere around 500 mph, the drivers intentionally doing flips, spins and pirouettes while airborne as part of their racing craft.  The physical structures in the scenes are beyond outrageous, as are the characters, the cars and the engines that power them.In keeping with the original cartoon, no one is killed in this movie.  My mother forbade me to watch this show, its fighting and gunplay, car wrecks and explosions too violent for her taste.  I nodded in solemn resignation, then went down the street to Adam's house to watch it every day.  But in this film, as in the cartoon, no one dies.  It's like theThe A-Team; the driver is thrown clear from his car, with futuristic escape and safety devices.  The physical violence is thoroughly cartoon-y, with no blood or gore.The film even keeps the original character names, with Snake Oiler and even Crusher Block.  Inspector Detector plays a major role, but I guess that CGI just hasn't progressed to the point to always have his beard sticking perpendicularly out from the side of his face.  You've got the car acrobatic team, racing through ice caves, driving up a mountain, helicopters chasing the race, a bit of Mammoth Car homage, and with more than enough Japanese content to place the film in its original Nippon.And the colors, oh, the dizzying colors.  They are intense as they can be, a near-nauseating blast of sparkling, flashing, whizzing and blurring colors, with everything in motion.  This isn't the straightforward chromatic assault we got fromDick Tracy, but is a thousand times more intense, all of the colors brighter, more day-glo, more intense, and always moving.The film bogs down only slightly in a couple of spots, when we get a bit too deep into Speed's adoration of his martyred brother and the overemphasized father-son relationship themes.  Racer X's treatment and portrayal are outstanding in every way, right down to his car.  I was disappointed to see the ravishing Susan Sarandon made out to be far more of a boring matron than I perceive her to be.Bottom line: I loved Speed Racer as a kid, but watching the original cartoon now is a joke because it is so low-budget and truly one-dimensional.  It's clear the Wachowski Brothers loved the show, too, so meticulous is their deep and spot-on translation of this Japanime classic into a CGI-powered memory for the next generation.",5,The Perfect

1175829,A3O9S9HQMKCUJR,B001CD6FKI,"Stephen Broome ""Anti-Noodling Consortium""","[1, 1]","There are plenty of good points about Speed Racer.  There are plenty of efforts made that -- taken on their own -- are very respectable for their attempts if not the execution. Unfortunately the Wachowskis seem to have forgotten some very basic elements of storytelling amidst all these attempts, and the results are a movie that's mediocre at best.Speed Racer begins telling story of a young Speed Racer who's never had any interests other than racing from the time he was a grade school student.  With his big brother setting the example as a famous race car driver, he ends up following in his brother's footsteps despite him leaving both racing and his family under lousy conditions. Determined to be great - but also racing directly against the memory of his deceased brother - he dominates the competition and is eventually offered a chance to race for Royalton Industries, the top company in racing headed by the creepy announcer from `V for Vendetta'.  The smarmy sales pitch doesn't win over Speed, and his refusal to race upsets the owner, who then chooses to  try and kill him for his refusal.  As a side-plot, Racer X (played by Fox) is busy crusading against the criminals who have ruined the game he loves.It's a pretty basic setup that presents an odd problem. While I often lament the lack of  patient storytelling in modern movies, I'm not sure this plot needed two hours and 15 minutes to execute.  It's especially notable when the main character is so drab. The performance by Emile Hirsch as speed racer, is, well:Not campynot convincingly seriousSort of semi-broodingNot really humorouscompletely lacking in chemistry with his on-screen girlfriend.Not menacing or intense at all when he tries.Hirsch's Speed Racer exists in a strange, uninteresting, no-man's land that mirrors the cg background and human actors in the entire movie. You're never completely attached him, he's simply a protagonist, not a hero.  And like most video game the ""talky parts"" just feel like cut scenes in between boss fights (or in this case races in new locations). Part of the problem in this comes from the aforementioned visuals. While it's fine to dazzle with bright colors, there aren't moments of quiet that are convincing enough to provide a real build to the races. Everything feels to be going at the same speed. Normal conversations should not have existed in the same lane as the races. In fact they shouldn't have even been on a freeway.There are some great visuals here, there's no doubt in that regard. Constant references to manga and anime storytelling devices are made, and most are successful.Characters make speeches while backed up by montages that illustrate their point.Speed lines, that old staple of manga and anime, is transformed into a very well done live version where backgrounds transform in live action and give an interesting escalation to the action. It works although I'm not sure if it holds much interest to those who aren't old-school anime fans. In this way it's reminiscent of Ang Lee's efforts to infuse comic book storytelling into his Hulk adaptation. It looked amazing to me, personally, but how many non-artists really cared?In the end this doesn't work as well as it should have, but there's a certain level of respect deserved for a bold attempt and a nice integration of some very good cg. Essentially it IS a live-action anime, which is what a lot of us have wanted to see (imagining what Cameron's adaptation of Angel Alita is going to be like, etc.).

1175831,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B001CD6FKI,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[83, 89]","Recently it seems like cartoon and comic books are about the only thing that gets made into blockbuster movies. While Transformers made the robots look like real living hulks of metal in the real world, and there's just no telling what the proposed Robotech movie will look like if it ever actually comes out, Speed Racer takes what is becoming the rather unpopular method of visual style. If you've seen Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow, you're familiar with it. Everything has a computer-adjusted color look to it, a super-crisp, super-sharp look reminiscent of the stop-motion films of yesteryear. And like those films that made the 80's so much fun for fantasy and sci-fi fans, Speed Racer features fantastic landscapes like nothing else on Earth (only now they are computer-generated instead of hand-painted).The story of Speed Racer the movie actually exactly the same as the old cartoon show of the 1960's. Speed Racer (yeah, that's actually his name) is an aspiring race car driver looking to become the best and win races, with Pop's company supplying the car and mechanic, and his mom, little brother Spritle, girlfriend Trixie and family pet chimp for support. Corporate thugs notice and try to either destroy, bankrupt, or otherwise make trouble for Racer Motors, and Speed teams up with Racer X (who may or may not be his presumed dead brother Rex), Inspector Detector, and a few friends he meets along the way, to bring down the bad guys and save the day. Yeah, nothing too complex story-wise, but hey, that's why you loved the cartoon show, right?Everything a Cartoon Should BeWhen I first heard there was going to be a Speed Racer movie by the makers of the Matrix, I was worried. Animated features and video games don't really have a good history as feature films. But after seeing Speed Racer in the theater five times, I have to admit, they got it pretty much perfect. The trick with making a cartoon movie live action, and intentionally making it look cartoony, is that you have to push everything into a consistent cartoon universe and have it make sense in it's context. In other words, you have to make things exaggerated, but not the point of total impossibility in the world you have created. You see in the Speed Racer world, cars have insane power, traction, control, and speed. So when you see the Mach 5 speeding around corners in insane power-slides, yeah it looks like a cartoon, but you accept it as actually happening in that cartoon. It never looks out of place. When the engine roars and cars explode into flames it isn't silly, it's movie magic of the best kind, like when Luke's X-Wing lands that shot into the Death Star in Star Wars.It's hard to describe without actually seeing it for yourself, but the cartoon universe of Speed Racer really is created wonderfully in this film. Everything from the sky to the furniture has an over-exposed super-vivid quality to it, like a technicolor gone mad. There is CGI backgrounds galore, but they jive perfectly with that universe as well, because everyone is wearing super-bright colors as well, and everything is always in razor sharp focus. Actually, this may be the movie to make me upgrade to a Blue Ray player, because it has to be the ultimate benchmark for color, contrast, and sharpness for a long time to come.The world of Speed Racer is amazing enough, but the way that the film is acted, shot, directed, and scored musically is what combines to make it a 10 out of 10. For starters, everyone is just so INTO their roles. Susan Sarandon as Mom and John Goodman as Pop Racer are both absolutely perfect, managing to become those stereotypical cartoon caricatures and at the same never come across as cheesy, over-the-top or unrealistic. Again, in the context of the film, they are part of the Universe. Pop talks to Speed like he really is his son, mom gives a heart-warming speech about how proud she is of Speed that really gets to you if you know what it's like to love your family. Never does anyone betray even slightly that they think their names are ridiculous or that they are saying silly lines. EVERYONE gives their lines like they are absolutely real. And if you're making a Star Wars or a Speed Racer, that makes the movie in the end. Everyone was great. From the mechanic and the little brother (a lot less annoying than the Spritle of the cartoon) to the absolutely gorgeous and incredibly cute-looking  Trixie played to perfection by Christina Ricci (where the heck has she been and why now of all times did she decide to play a sweet, loveable babe instead of all those crazy weird Gothic-horror type roles?), you gotta love them all. I especially was overjoyed by how well Racer X was portrayed with icy stoicism. Just wonderful.The near constant use of deep focus photography and other camera techniques, combined with tons of digital screen wipes and other minor tricks, results in an incredibly slick presentation that cascades past the screen like panels of a comic book in glorious living color. The comedy and dramatic buttons are always pushed to great effect, all while keeping things from getting too far from the light-hearted entertainment that Speed Racer should be. And when the orchestral remix of the Speed Racer theme kicks in, it's just magic.You really can't expect much more from this movie than it already is. It's true to the spirit of Speed Racer, the characters are all acted perfectly, the story is classic, there are tons of great moments and Speed Racer tributes (like Speed's wearing his trademark blue shirt and red handkerchief and his classic pose when he jumps from the Mach 5, or the sound effect made every time the Mach 5's jump jacks are used). Speed Racer may not be perfect. The villains feel more Hanna Barbara than Speed Racer, the sprinkling of swear-words (and Spritle giving someone the finger?) really don't jive in the kid-friendly Speed Racer universe, and the visual style of this film is definitely not for everyone. But...If you're like me and love comic books, video games, and anime, if you like to watch old shows just as much as new ones, if crazy CGI and a movie shot entirely with blue-screens makes you smile, and the Speed Racer theme kicking in full-blast just as Speed makes a triumphant comeback makes you cheer... this is the movie for you!",5,Go Speed Racer Go!,1216166400,"07 16,

As he waits in the locker room, mentally preparing himself for the upcoming race, he remembers back to a similar moment when his older brother, Rex (Scott Porter) once faced the same challenges...Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, the duo behind ""The Matrix"", one of the most visionary films ever made, ""Speed Racer"" isn't as bad as the third installment of ""The Matrix"" trilogy, but it has problems. I was hoping the brothers had worked the kinks out of their system, the same kinks that helped to create ""Revolutions"", the third installment and one of the most disappointing sequels ever. They've worked out some, but not all of them....But Rex and his father had a falling out and Rex ended up having a bad accident during a race, causing his death. As Speed takes to the twisty, curvy track, resembling something out of a Matchbox set only a sadist could create...The Wachowski Brothers are very visual filmmakers, interested in, possibly obsessing over all details of the looks of their films. This may seem like a `well, duh"" statement, but the brothers have created many completely unique worlds for their films, making them seem believable, viable, possible. Of course, they become a filmmaking powerhouse after ""The Matrix"", spending this cache to make two sequels to that film. Yes, I actually liked the second installment, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", but even I have my limits. These limits were surpassed by ""Revolutions"". As the producers of ""V for Vendetta"", they helped to stamp their signature on this project as well, creating a future look at a very Orwellian London. Now, with ""Speed Racer"", they turn their unique eye on an animated series they grew-up with. ""Racer"" really does blow your mind with new and interesting visuals; there are so many interesting ideas at work in the film, it would take me hours to go through them all, so I'll just highlight a few. The brothers use a `deep focus' technique giving this film the look of animation. Generally, if a camera is focusing on one subject, people and objects in the background, further behind the subject in question, are blurry, allowing us to focus on the character in the foreground. If the attention shifts, the focus changes. In ""Racer"", both subjects are always in focus and this gives the film a flatter appearance. Normally, this flatter appearance would be problematic, but it is intentional and the color palette of the film is filled with neon colors and brightness, making these same images pop off the screen. It's a unique, somewhat strange effect. Because the images are a little flatter, and at the same time, they aren't, they almost appear slightly 3-D....Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Speed's gal-pal, Trixie (Christina Ricci) sit in the crowded stands, ready to cheer Speed on...I know the Wachowski Brothers grew up with the original animated series and are trying to pay homage with this film. But they are, perhaps, paying too much homage and not trying to fix the things they should. Many of the actors portray their characters in a very, very broad way and this only makes them seem more like cartoons, less real and makes it more difficult to believe in the rest of the world the brothers spent so much time and effort to create. Paulie Litt who plays Spritle, Speed's younger brother is particularly broad and cartoony and it doesn't help that he has Chim Chim, a monkey at his side, throughout the entire film. There are a few nice visual puns involving Spritle and Chim Chim, but these characters place a strain on an already incredulous story. There are also a series of villains who growl and snarl at the camera as though someone is shouting out single word descriptions of their emotions, causing them to react. Hirsch, Sarandon, Goodman and Ricci do a better job with the material....Speed takes to the track and it quickly becomes evident the other racers are determined to do whatever they have to do to keep Speed from winning. This is like no race you have ever seen before; more like a wire cage match combined with NASCAR, the drivers have implements added to their cars to help them fend off attackers who have added dangerous implements to their cars, implements designed to do some nasty stuff...And this film is like no film you have ever seen before. In addition to the crazy, interesting color palette and the crazy designs of the racetracks and cityscapes, they Wachowski Brothers use two interesting techniques throughout the film. Rather than use a normal dissolve or other typical transition to move from one scene to the next, they frequently use one or more characters, wiping them across the screen as the scene changes. Frequently, these characters are talking as well, providing some thought or snippet of information relating to the action on screen. This is an interesting technique, because it provides a lot more layers to the film, always, always giving us something interesting to look at. But it also an overused technique and ultimately becomes exhausting. Frequently, the characters used for this technique are the seemingly dozens of sportscaster, many from other countries, speaking in their native tongue. Because these characters appear randomly, sometimes shouting a line in Italian or Japanese, their appearance only serves to add to the cacophony of the film....But Speed is a great racer, possibly the best ever, so he is able to deflect the attackers off, flipping his car, jumping from one track to the next, the car spinning through the air with ease...This is easily the best part of the film. The races are amazing to watch because they seem to be taking place on a Matchbox set in the film ""Bladerunner"". It's a little difficult to follow the action at times, but this helps to keep the viewers engaged....Speed's antics attract the attention of Royalton (Roger Allam, ""The Queen"", ""V for Vendetta"" and lots of British TV credits), a wealthy industrialist who is very interested in getting Speed to race for his company and help promote his new, unbeatable engine, which would conveniently be built into the car he wants Speed to drive.And Racer X (Matthew Fox, TV's ""Lost"", ""Vantage Point"") is a mysterious, ""Robin Hood"" type, out to help those who need it. He takes an interest in helping Speed especially when he declines to join Royalton's team. After a series of events unfolds, Speed is able to race in the upcoming Grand Prix, the penultimate event for all racers. But Royalton unleashes the many henchmen...Royalton's henchmen eerily resemble the 1960s Television version of the Riddler's goons....At his disposal to ensure that won't happen. Will Racer X be able to help?""Racer""'s problems are even more upsetting because I had such high hopes for the film. The trailers promised a mind-blowing, trippy journey. And the filmmakers deliver on this promise. But the story is lacking and the acting is uneven and an odd storytelling device makes the film a mixed effort, one many are clearly staying away from.The odd storytelling device? The film opens with Speed sitting on a bench in the locker room, waiting for the next race, psyching himself up. As he sits, his back to us, he remembers back to similar events involving his brother, Rex, when he was much younger. So we watch a moment between Rex and Speed, then return to the current, thanks to Mom and Pops (Sarandon and Goodman) sitting in the stands, cheering in both scenarios. We watch a moment of the race, than return to the other story. Back to the race, and so forth. Much like the character transitions, this initially works and provides interest to the film, but it becomes overused and ultimately slows the film...And this review......Down at a time when every minute counts. The same thing happens during the Grand Prix race. A few moments of the race, transition to another story in the past, back to the race, and so forth. This technique makes the Grand Prix, the big, ultimate, climactic race seem like the slowest race ever.I also think it is a mistake to market the film as `family friendly'. This campaign is most likely driving away the teenage boys, afraid there money and time will be spent watching something too tame and sweet. Teenaged girls? Maybe. Little girls? Forget it. So, little boys are really the only audience suitable for this film. And they can't buy tickets on their own. So it is left to the few people interested enough in the film, or nostalgic enough for the animated series, to buy a ticket for this film. And there are apparently very few of those people out in the world.",3,Great Visuals are Marred by Hammy Acting and Overuse of Some Techniques,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,8774,"['Speed', 'Emile',

1175837,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001CD6FKI,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 12]","Talk about a dead engine. After sitting through this loud, headache inducing, mind-numbing color-vomiting mess of a childrens' movie, I really wanted to find the W-Brothers' home phone number and ask them WTF were you thinking? Were you really out to make a 'family film' that went on for over two-hours? Did you really intend to put in insipid wall-collision scene stoppers with Spridle and Chim-Chim where ever you could? Did John Goodman's fight scene look like you envisioned it or was it supposed to look inane?Holy cow, what a waste of time. Emile Hirsch and John Goodman do an admirable job of recreating their cartoon counterparts, but everyone else is reduced to banalities and hopeless mugging. The villain, as played by Roger Allom, is so over-the-top oily that he could have lubed the entire fleet of CGI vehicles. The constant use of screen wipes using tight shots of his face got to be aggravating to the point of distraction, an effect used to show cleverness more than anything else. Same for the endless race scenes, which looked mostly like hyper-hallucinatory giant hot-wheels toys.Oh wait, the plot. Family loyalty is good, corporate monsters are bad. Which is not a bad message, but it gets buried beneath the barrage of primary colors and bright flashing splatter. While the final race, the Grand Prix, is actually exciting, it comes so late in the film that you're already reaching for the Advil. Racer X (Lost's Matthew Fox, given little to do except look solemn and spout dopey Zen racing dialogue like ""You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver. You do it because you're driven"") and Christina Ricci (forced to utter ""cool beans"" alot) are window dressing to the hyperkinetic action zooming around them. Every time Speed and Trixie try to set off sparks, Spridle is there to annoy you. The road to the races are filled with irritating speed bumps. I was really wanting this to end before the Grand Prix finally started.About the nicest thing I can say about this screeching blue-print for a video game is I bet it will look great on your Blu-Ray system.

Remember watching those little metal cars zip around on the track and trying to imagine what it would be like to be inside one? Speed Race gives you the opportunity.The Wachowski brothers follow up their massively successful Matrix Trilogy, with Speed Racer. This time the story is PG-rated and appeals to children ages 7-11, but do not let that scare you away! It is enormously entertaining and the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time.Speed Racer follows the story of a teenage boy Speed (Emile Hirsch), a born racer, who has just become extremely popular after winning a big race. His popularity has caught the eye of Royalton (Roger Allam), the owner and CEO of a gazillion dollar corporate conglomerate, who is bent on signing Speed onto his team of race car drivers. When Speed refuses to sign with him, Royalton goes about trying to destroy Speed's life as well as his parents (John Goodman, Susan Sarandon). Speed, feeling responsible decides to fight back; and to do this he must...yes you guessed it...RACE! The plot has many more intricacies to it but I will leave that for you to discover when you see it.The casting was perfect, and everyone played their part flawlessly. John Goodman stood out the most as the passionate father, and relatively new Paulie Litt made quite an impression as Speed's younger brother.Yes, the script and delivery of some of the lines were rather sappy, and there were the moments of that warm fuzzy-wuzzy father-son-family time; all which could be annoying in other circumstances but here they actually almost suited it.Speed Racer does not disappoint and surprises you with how much you are drawn into it!

Back in the 1950s and 1960s, while there wasn't much of a selection there were three huge Anime titles that were extremly popular. Astro Boy, Kimba The White Lion and of course the hero with the extremly catchy theme song...Speed Racer. Speed Racer is an extreme race car driver with a heart of gold. He wants to prove that racing is not about money or power it is about loving what you do. So now Speed Racer has become a live action movie unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen.This movie promised to be either the biggest success of the Summer 2008 line up or the biggest bust. Unfortunatly I had a feeling it was going to fall into the bust catagory. The Wachowski Bros., directing already put up a major red flag because of all those people who hated how the Matrix saga ended. Still after seeing the trailers for this movie and knowing how the series was played out I still had high hopes for a good time in the theater. I went to see and I got exactly what I wanted. Speed Racer was just as goofy and funny with the rambling diologue the corny 60ish jokes and put on screen to be a live action anime. The special effects and cinemetography blew me away. After seeing Sin City and 300 it was amazing to see the same style of filming with wide open spaces and extremly colorful layouts. The soundtrack also kept that 1960's feel to it. All and all eventhough this film is over 2 hours long. You will only appreciate this movie if you know exactly what you are getting into.

You knew it had to happen that way.) If that were all this movie offered, I wouldn't bother.The effects keep it moving at a roller-coaster pace, though. Fast cars on (and often in the air over) surreal race tracks pound together like supersonic bumper-cars, seen through vertiginous angles of the CGI ""camera.""

Garcia ""snozwanger""","[7, 7]","this movie really was made for the big screen. i saw it in imax which was the very first real hollywood movie i had ever seen on the imax screen. they gave us these necklace speed racer passes, and i sat down and watched one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen in a movie theater. i assumed this had a lot to do with the fact that it was on the imax screen. then, i watched kung fu panda on the imax, which was good but did not impress me as much as speed did. then even more recently i saw dark knight in the imax. its a fantastic movie, but made my friend sick, and was overwhelming on such a large screen. speed racer remains the greatest imax experience of my life, and has left me with a great desire to obtain this dvd. movies these days are so similar in the ways they are made, and yet speed racer shows us filming of a 1960's cartoon put into real time and it shines like an idea being born. soo, o not to mention christina richi has never really looked hotter... very cute. i dont really call it cartoon-y. to me its greatly artistic, and unique. very very unique. this is going to be the most under rated movie of the year and i think its because people saw it as a kids movie. really enjoyable for anyone. and i am serious, anyone",5,wow so unique,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1252,"['movie', 'really', 'was', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'i', 'saw', 'imax', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'real', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'i', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'imax', 'screen', 'gave', 'necklace', 'speed', 'racer', 'passes', 'i', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'theater', 'i', 'assumed', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'was', 'imax', 'screen', 'then', 'i', 'watched', 'kung', 'fu', 'panda', 'imax', 'was', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'as', 'much', 'speed', 'did', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'recently', 'i', 'saw', 'dark', 'knight', 'imax', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'made', 'friend', 'sick', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'large', 'screen', 'speed', 'racer', 'greatest', 'imax', 'experience', 'life', 'left', 'great', 'desire', 'obtain', 'dvd', 'movies', 'days', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'ways', 'are', 'made', 'yet', 'speed', 'racer', 'filming', '1960', 'cartoon', 'put', 'real', 'time', 'idea', 'being', 'born', 'soo', 'not', 'mention', 'christina', 'richi', 'never', 'really', 'looked', 'hotter', 'very', 'cute', 'i', 'dont', 'really', 'call', 'cartoon-y', 'greatly', 'artistic', 'unique', 'very', 'very', 'unique', 'going', 'be', 'most', 'rated', 'movie', 'year', 'i', 'think', 'people', 'saw', 'kids', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'i', 'am', 'serious', 'anyone']",N/A
1175845,AE9GUE3HHOX3U,B001CD6FKI,zooni,"[0, 0]","The first half hour of Speed Racer was excruciating to watch.  I was ready to eject it and throw it across the room.  But as the film transcends it slowly puts you in a trance and you begin to aclimate to the bright colours and spazy visuals.  Alot of the film is bizarre.  I will definately say it is a unique style of filmaking,  but I sure hope this is not the future of movies.  I only need one movie like this, Speed Racer is in a class of it's own.  The Wachowski Brothers did a borderline good job with this, but there are a few flaws here and there.  By the second half of the movie Speed Racer thankfully gains it's momentum and keeps it going.  Some of the acting was borderline as well.  Spirtle added a surreal and borderline annoying element to the film.  He  adds to the campiness, giving it that b-movie feel.  You don't know whether to hug him or bash his face in. OKAY WARNING. THIS IS WHERE MY REVIEW TAKES A DETOUR.  The main reason I liked Speed Racer is because of Emile Hirsch. there is something about him.  I loved him in Into the Wild and in Speed Racer he is his usual beyond hot self.  You just want to pause the movie on his face and go up and kiss the screen.  There were a couple parts where he looked really cute and I hit pause and just stared at his face for a couple minutes.  Is that weird?  He really turned this movie out with his intense acting.  I hate saying this but it almost seemed as though he was miscast.  His character and persona are a bit deep for this kind of movie but for me, it worked to his advantage.  At this point I would watch anything he stars in.  he could read the phone book for all I care and I would sit there and watch every minute.  He's got to be the #1 actor.  From beginning to end this is a decent movie so Emile Hirsch is 2 for 2.  I hope he stars in another good movie.",4,Go!,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1841,"['first', 'hour', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'was', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'was', 'ready', 'eject', 'throw', 'room', 'film', 'slowly', 'trance', 'begin', 'aclimate', 'bright', 'colours', 'spazy', 'visuals', 'Alot', 'film', 'bizarre', 'will', 'definately', 'say', 'unique', 'style', 'filmaking', 'sure', 'hope', 'not', 'future', 'movies', 'only', 'need', 'one', 'movie', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'class', 'own', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'did', 'borderline', 'good', 'job', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'here', 'there', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'thankfully', 'gains', 'momentum', 'going', 'acting', 'was', 'borderline', 'as', 'well', 'Spirtle', 'added', 'surreal', 'borderline', 'annoying', 'element', 'film', 'campiness', 'giving', 'b-movie', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hug', 'bash', 'face', 'OKAY', 'WARNING', 'THIS', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'REVIEW', 'TAKES', 'A', 'DETOUR', 'main', 'reason', 'liked', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'something', 'loved', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'usual', 'hot', 'self', 'just', 'want', 'pause', 'movie', 'face', 'go', 'up', 'kiss', 'screen', 'were', 'couple', 'parts', 'where', 'looked', 'really', 'cute', 'hit', 'pause', 'just', 'stared', 'face', 'couple', 'minutes', 'weird', 'really', 'turned', 'movie', 'out', 'intense', 'acting', 'hate', 'saying', 'almost', 'seemed', 'was', 'miscast', 'character', 'persona', 'are', 'bit', 'deep', 'kind', 'movie', 'worked', 'advantage', 'point', 'would', 'watch', 'anything', 'could', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'care', 'would', 'sit', 'watch', 'minute', 'got', 'be', '1', 'actor', 'beginning', 'end', 'decent', 'movie', 'so', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', '2', '2', 'hope', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
