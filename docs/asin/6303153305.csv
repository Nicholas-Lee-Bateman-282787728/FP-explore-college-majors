Recently I reviewed the food-centered ""Julie and Julia"" about the marathon efforts of a modern day blogger to race through and prepare every recipe in the famous Child's cook book. Now we have this little precursor, a little Mexican import that has the mysteries, portents and usages of food, if not as the central plot then as an important prop in the narration of the story.And that story? A tale straight out of the ""magical realism"" trend that is still, mainly, in vogue these days in novelistic treatments. In short, a tale of love, longing for love, love thwarted, love twisted, conventional family life Mexican style gone awry, old time views on the place of women and children in the nuclear family structure and all glue together by...endless scenes of the preparation of this and that in the ever present kitchen. A nice sent-up of a film and a cautionary tale or two to make one think.

360491,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303153305,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 11]","This is a Mexican romance novel set in the early part of the 20th century masquerading as a naturalistic melodrama with supernatural overtones, penned by director Alfonso Arau's wife, Laura Esquivel.  We can see from the frequent narrative voice-overs that her novel was beautifully, if idiotically, written. Although ""Chocolate"" strains credulity at times and offends my sensibilities, it provides moments of pleasant diversion.  I am reminded of Dickens, somehow.  I think it is because the mother is so bad, and so many years pass before she gets her comeuppance, which is the way Dickens used to do it.  She is truly a mommy from hell.  She even comes back to haunt her poor last-born daughter.Tita, the youngest daughter, played sympathetically by Lumi Cavazos, is a sort of Cinderella to her two older sisters and her evil mother.  She has to work in the kitchen and is constantly abused by her mother while forbidden to marry since it is a family tradition that she must take care of her mother in her old age.  Consequently, her true love, Pedro, a wooden pretty boy, is given to her sister instead of her.  He goes along with this since it allows him to be close to Tita.  One gets the sense that Pedro figures he's getting two for the price of one, although initially he acts out a celibate role, the better to whet the appetite, I suppose.The scene where the oldest daughter is carried off by a swashbuckling rebel, (...) on his horse, reveals the romance novel heart of the movie.  Further swells the fancy of the feminine heart when she returns years later as a revolutionary general (!) in tweed jacket wearing bandoliers of bullets, still beloved by her handsome abductor.As is the rule in women's POV fairy tales, the men in this movie are without personality: they just fill the roles as heroes, lovers and villains.  What counts is the interaction between the women and the fulfillment of romantic notions.  Nonetheless, there are a number of nice touches, especially the sumptuous feasts including such delectables as baked quail with rose petal sauce, chillis with walnuts, and corn fritters with syrup.

Instead, Cavazos internalizes the frustrations of her character and conveys a mountain of meaning with just a  look, a smile or a frown.The film is sensual, playful, and extremely  evocative.  It helps that the source material, Laura Esquivel's novel, is  also exquisite and unusual (using recipes as a structural device, much in  the way diary entries have traditionally done).  Alfonso Arau visualizes  the novel brilliantly; this was one rare case where the literary work and  the film are complementary instead of in competition.

Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 6]","If you are looking for a great introduction to magical realism and food, in cinema, COMO AGUA PARA EL CHOCOLATE (LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE), directed by Alfonso Arau, is the film to see. For those of you unfamiliar with magical realism, this is probably the most straightforward way to explain it.  It is an artistic genre in which magical elements appear in an otherwise realistic setting.  CHOCOLATE is rich in this fine art of storytelling, prevalently seen in Latin American literature.  This splendid adaptation of the novel of the same name, by Laura Esquivel, is beautiful.Tita (Lumi Cavazos) is the youngest daughter of Elena (Regina Torn&eacute;), a heartless Mexican woman, who, by tradition, must stay with her mother and take care of her.  This tradition is upheld even when Lumi remains in love with Pedro (Marco Leonardi), who wants her for his wife, but is turned away by Mama Elena, and marries her older sister, Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi) to be close to her. This is just the beginning of Tita's deeply rooted connection between her emotions and the food she prepares.  Everything from a wedding cake, to a dinner, becomes a reflection of Tita's state.  It also is her way of connecting with Pedro, to show him her love. What's more, those who consume the food absorb Tita's mood and react accordingly.  One example is in the wedding cake she prepares of Rosaura and Pedro.  Tita cries tears of anguish into that batter and everyone who eats it wants to die and gets really ill.I feel that food and mood are very interconnected.  I have made a habit not to cook when I am angry.  Something always goes wrong when I am unhappy.  I will burn the meal, it will come out too salty or I will almost have an accident with the knife.  Yes, I have had kitchen accidents.  This film confirms that for me.  This film is a very sexy, beautifully acted and sensuous journey for the senses.

Tita falls in love with Pedro, who then requests her hand in marriage.  But because of the tradition, the mother decides Pedro can not have Tita as his wife, and promptly offers her eldest daughter!  That is terrible enough, but then when Pedro accepts the offer, it is even more troubling.  His idea is to marry the sister so that he may be close to Tita (a difficult task considering the mother watches them like a hawk).Over the period of many years, Tita uses her cooking to express herself and her love for and with Pedro and it affects her family in many interesting ways that make this an excellent film.

The premise is simple: a girl, Tita, loves a man (although I cannot think of his character's name now) from the time she is young. He is also desperately in love with her. Tita is mistreated by her mother who insists that Tita's place in the family and in life is to never wed and to take care of her, and therefore prefers the charm of being in the kitchen with her grandmother. Tita learns all the secrets of working magic in the kitchen. Eventually Tita's beloved sister runs away, and the remaining sister ends up marrying the man who is Tita's one true love. This makes Tita desperately sad (and her sadness magically ends up in the food she cooks for the wedding party), but eventually she realises that her man only married Tita's sister in order to be close to her. At some point Tita's mother dies, and this creates a lot of problems for Tita. Throughout the film, Tita's culinary creations reflect the person herself-her sadness, her love, her beauty, her revenge, and so on. The film shows the magic inherent in everything Tita touches. Of course, at some point Tita leaves (if I recall she got very ill-perhaps emotionally ill). Tita ends up marrying a man and having a child. And when her child grows up, he falls in love with and marries the child of Tita's sister and Tita's one true love (the sister's husband).

I think the movie is profund and it made me think about the characters, why they did what they did, etc. Tita is the youngest daughter. Her family tradition is that the youngest daughter is born to care for her mother and is not to ever marry. The problem is that out of her 3 sisters, it is she the youngest who has a suitor who has fallen in love with her and she with him. Her mother is a very strict stern woman who will not allow her to marry. So Pedro (Tita's suitor) decides that he will marry her older sister to be close to Tita. Pedro's decision is questioned throughout the movie. Was his decision wise or foolish? At one point Tita asks him why didn't you just ask me to run away with you. Did he take the coward's way out by marrying someone he did not love or was that a true sacrifice of love. Regardless, their love is strong and always present throughout their lives. Tita spends most of her time in the kitchen preparing family meals and her emotions go directly into the foods she prepares. I found this facinating. Her mother forces Tita to put aside her emotions and bake the wedding cake. Well Tita starts to cry for her lost love while she is mixing the cake batter and her tears fall into it. When the guests eat the cake, each person is taken over by deep meloncholy in remember their own unrequited love. And a massive crying and outpouring of emotions take over the wedding. It's funny yet profund in showing how each one of us has a story of a lost love. The movie is great. I found so much enjoyment in it.

More than once, Gabriel Garcia-Marquez came to my mind, especially his two major novels, 100 Hundreds Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera. I easily recognized supernatural realities that organically become a part of everyday life in a Mexican Farm in the beginning of the 20th century. Like in ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" the unrequited and undying love that lives through decades and all sorts of obstacles, plays the major part in Like Water for chocolate. The film has some beautifully done emotional and sensual scenes but overall, something is missing. Maybe it is simply impossible to adequately adapt this sort of literature to the screen? Whatever is truly magical, unique, and beautiful in the words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters where you can create your own vision of what you read simply does not always make you accept fully the film creators' vision. What is meaningful, moving, and passionate on the pages of the brilliantly written book, may lose its charm and seem preposterous or pretentious while being adapted to the film. Like Water for Chocolate is an entertaining movie with the exotic settings and very interesting idea of expressing the repressed love, unfulfilled longing, desperation, and hope in cooking and in the ability to change the people's lives and fates through the meals they consume. It was just difficult for me to fully accept the fateful romance between two main characters and the old tradition of not letting a youngest daughter in the family to get married and to fulfill her own dreams of happiness. Maybe this book requires another cinematic reading with better production values including  more fluid camera work. The way it is, some scenes just end abruptly, and the following scenes would not make much sense. Where the movie succeeds for me, is in my wish to find and read the novel, to capture its magic to which each reader keeps referring, and to try to cook some of the Tita's dishes. The novel which consists of twelve chapters named after twelve months opens each chapter with a new recipe. Now when I think of it, if Tita had been happily married to Pedro, she more likely would not have become such a genius in cooking and there would not have been her delicious recipes for us to enjoy.3.5/5",3,"Like Water for Hot Chocolate: A novel in monthly installments with recipes, romances and home remedies.",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3227,"['missed', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1993', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'read', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'description', 'kind', 'movie', 'passionate', 'Tita', 'Lumi', 'Cavazos', 'love', 'Pedro', 'Marco', 'Leonardi', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Regina', 'Torne', 'marrying', 'When', 'Pedro', 'instead', 'sister', 'Tita', 'cooking', 'discovers', 'can', 'transfer', 'emotions', 'food', 'Passionate', 'romance', 'hot', 'boiling', 'water', 'chocolate', 'delicious', 'food', 'people', 'most', 'amazing', 'ways', 'magical', 'realism', 'are', 'components', 'perfect', 'cinema', 'dish', 'was', 'salivating', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'arrive', 'Netflix', 'Well', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'magical', 'course', 'very', 'much', 'South', 'American', 'literature', 'tradition', 'magic', 'realism', 'More', 'once', 'Gabriel', 'Garcia-Marquez', 'came', 'mind', 'especially', 'two', 'major', 'novels', '100', 'Hundreds', 'Years', 'Solitude', 'Love', 'Time', 'Cholera', 'easily', 'recognized', 'supernatural', 'realities', 'organically', 'become', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'Mexican', 'Farm', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'Love', 'Time', 'Cholera', 'unrequited', 'undying', 'love', 'decades', 'sorts', 'obstacles', 'major', 'part', 'Water', 'chocolate', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done', 'emotional', 'sensual', 'scenes', 'overall', 'something', 'missing', 'Maybe', 'simply', 'impossible', 'adequately', 'adapt', 'sort', 'literature', 'screen', 'truly', 'magical', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'words', 'sentences', 'paragraphs', 'chapters', 'where', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'vision', 'what', 'read', 'simply', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'accept', 'fully', 'film', 'creators', 'vision', 'What', 'meaningful', 'moving', 'passionate', 'pages', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'book', 'may', 'lose', 'charm', 'seem', 'preposterous', 'pretentious', 'being', 'adapted', 'film', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'exotic', 'settings', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', 'expressing', 'repressed', 'love', 'unfulfilled', 'longing', 'desperation', 'hope', 'cooking', 'ability', 'change', 'people', 'lives', 'fates', 'meals', 'consume', 'was', 'just', 'difficult', 'fully', 'accept', 'fateful', 'romance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'old', 'tradition', 'not', 'letting', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'family', 'get', 'married', 'fulfill', 'own', 'dreams', 'happiness', 'Maybe', 'book', 'cinematic', 'reading', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'including', 'more', 'fluid', 'camera', 'work', 'way', 'scenes', 'just', 'end', 'abruptly', 'following', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Where', 'movie', 'wish', 'find', 'read', 'novel', 'capture', 'magic', 'reader', 'referring', 'try', 'cook', 'Tita', 'dishes', 'novel', 'twelve', 'chapters', 'named', 'twelve', 'months', 'chapter', 'new', 'recipe', 'Now', 'when', 'think', 'Tita', 'had', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'Pedro', 'more', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'become', 'genius', 'cooking', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'delicious', 'recipes', 'enjoy.3.5/5']",Like Water for Chocolate VHS

""A New Yorker""","[8, 9]","When I was in college, I majored in Fashion Merchandising Mgt., and as part of one of my Read/Writing WKSHP courses, I had to read this book. After reading it, I realized it was a wonderful book. I don't know what I had done with book but that was back in 1994. I was at the library one day and I spotted it and rented it out. It was not my first time seeing it either. The movie is sensual, playful, and extremely evocative. It helps that the source material, Laura Esquivel's novel, is also exquisite and unusual (using recipes as a structural device, much in the way diary entries have traditionally done). Alfonso Arau visualizes the novel brilliantly; this was one rare case where the literary work and the film are complementary instead of in competition. Ironic, then, that this bittersweet romance of almost mythic emotional force came from the collaboration of Esquivel and Arau, who are divorced.This film is about Tia, a Mexican girl who wants to marry a boy named Pedro. Her only problem -- and it's a bad one -- is her mother, Mama Elena. Mama Elena upholds an old family tradition where the youngest daughter is to stay home and take care of her mother. It's a good idea in theory, but in practice somebody obviously failed to consider what might happen to the youngest daughter when the mother dies. Because Mama Elena insists that Pedro marry Rosaura and not Tita, Pedro does marry Rosaura -- but only to be near Tita. Tita has to cook the wedding feast, and her tears fall into the batter of the wedding cake. And the magic begins.The two primary actresses are excellent. I really wanted Tita to find happiness -- especially with Pedro. As for Mama Elena, I hated her enough to want to strangle her. Kudos to the actress who played her for creating such a despicable part. The actor who played Pedro was acceptable, but he didn't have that much to do. Of course, it is a film where women are the most important characters, so maybe that's why the actor didn't have much to do.After watching this movie you will realize that Like Water for Chocolate is more than a movie, it's an experience.

Some of the film's charm lies in its uncompromising vision of what it must be like to be a poor, Mexican woman, surrounded by angry sisters and petty jealousies.  The food is a miracle of texture and authenticity that makes the book a recipe lover's dream.  But the spiritual aspects of the movie take it someplacve else altogether....by tying food and unseen forces together, the author and director have fashioned love as a cycle of human emotion coupled with betrayal and passion.  Believers and non-believers alike are asked to suspend judgement and just BE with this movie, for it raises issues and themes rarely imagined or acheived on film.  A few sequences are startling - such as a wedding party where every guest is gastronimically infected by a soup that is stewed with the tears of our protagonist, and they all end up regurgitating the mixture, and in the end, understanding that true love should not be gambled away for money or superiority.  Another sequence, where the middle daughter Gertudis, is literally kidnapped by a horse riding gunslinger while she sits alone in an outhouse doing her business, is hysterical, yet also painful to watch, because it symbolizes the woman's need for free choice in a world where men have so much of the power.  Besides, any couple who has eloped or married without their parent's blessings will quickly make the connection to their own experience.  If you can keep up with the subtitles, I'd advise against a dubbed version, for in its Spanish - eloquent, funny and dramatic - the film c aptures its truest form of communication.

Based upon the best selling novela of the same name by Laura Esquivel, who also wrote the screenplay, the film successfully captures this tale of forbidden love. Well directed by Laura Esquivel's husband, Alfonso Arau (The Magnificent Ambersons, A Walk In the Clouds), the cast delivers wonderful performances in this mystical tale.During the early twentieth century in Mexico, just south of the border, a girl catches the eye of boy. A number of years later, the boy, Pedro, now a young man, speaks to the girl, Tita, now a young woman, and declares his heartfelt, passionate love for her. Pedro (Marco Leonardi) wants Tita (Lumi Cavazos) to marry him.He and his father meet with Tita's mother, Elena (Regina Torne), and ask if she would give her consent to a union between Pedro and Tita, Elena's youngest daughter. Elena forbids such a marriage to take place, as it is an unbroken family tradition that the youngest daughter remain single, so that she may take care of her mother until the mother dies. Such is the destiny of Tita. Elena, instead, cruelly offers to have her oldest daughter, Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi), marry Pedro.Surprisingly, Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura, his twisted logic being that this is the only way he can be close to Tita. Thus, begins an untenable situation. Tita, forced by her selfish, harridan of a mother to prepare the wedding feast for Rosaura and Pedro, begins a lifelong sublimation of her passion and emotions with food. Its mystical properties become self evident in the expert hands of Tita, as she becomes a superlative cook. She has the ability to imbue the food that she prepares with the fervor and feelings, both good and bad, that she dare not express. Her love, her pain, her passion is evident in every delightful and delicious dish that she creates, and her feelings manifest themselves in those who ingest her meals.This is a glorious film about love, filled with mystical, magical, and supernatural portents. Sensual and evocative, it details the road that Tita and Pedro must travel before their journey is complete. Wonderfully acted and beautifully told, theirs is a story that will long linger in the mind of the viewer. Awash in amber tones, the brilliant cinematography contributes to the mystical properties of this film. Sumptuous and surreal, it is a feast for the eyes and not to be missed. Bravo!The DVD offers clear visuals and great sound. It does not offer much in the way of special features.

The way of the old traditions are swept away by the Mexican Revolution of 1910 at a hacienda sited next to Texas. Long term care for old age was not provided by insurance, but by the youngest child. Love and war and refuge across the Rio Grande challenge the old assumption. Love triumphs at the end but with cost of family. Those of us who have lived along this border all our lives can appreciate the complexity of life where very different cultures co-exist and struggle to retain a sense of identity. Those who have not experienced this phenomena may gain an understanding not just of culture, but of the stories behind the headlines of today.

360526,AAX9ZIMIYJ77W,6303153305,Lei,"[0, 1]","Like water for Chocolate (Como Agua Para Chocolate), released in 1992 is based on a novel published in 1989 by Laura Esquivel. This is a good portrayal of why certain traditions should die. The film consists of a Mexican family of Dona Elena and her three daughters: Gertrudis, Rosaura, and Tita. TIta, being the youngest, is to stay home with her mother until her passing. ""Never, for generations has anyone in our family ever questioned this tradition!"" Dona Elena states.  Day in and day out Tita is obligated to daily chores like the housekeepers Chencha and the Nacha. She spent much of her childhood in the kitchen and is the best daughter  at cooking. The older housekeeper, Nacha, has been way more of a mother to Tita since day one. Tita confides in Nacha greatly. Pedro had confessed his love for Tita during a party. Pedro tells Tita, ""One doesn't think about love. Either one feels it or one doesn't"". He asks for Tita's hand in marriage, but Dona Elena refuses the proposal, but offers Rosaura as replacement.  Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura to be closer to Tita. Pedro disappointed me with this decision. He was not in love with Rosaura. There was no fooling anyone with his new marriage proposition. My solution for Pedro: impregnate Tita. That way she would have been forced to marry Pedro to save what would be left of her reputation, unless the ancient tradition still presides over that.  It seems like there aren't enough Pedros to go around in the neighborhood. Where are the other eligible young men? Throw one in Rosaura's direction.  I find it odd that Rosaura accepts Pedro's hand for marriage when she knows he loves Tita. I dislike Rosaura for her pushiness in having sex with Pedro when clearly he had been avoiding it.  In the meantime, Tita cooks everyday on the ranch for the family. Everyone is affected by Tita's cooking.  She cooks the most deliciously seductive dishes that bring out sensations of love and desire amongst everyone at the dining table. One day the sensations of passion and sexual desire drove Gertrudis to remove all her clothes due to the hot flashes. She jumped on a horse with one of the revolutionary soldiers and rode off. Dona Elena disowned her existence for it. Every opening chapter starts with food. Author Esquivel does an amazing job incorporating food, such as the salt, onions, and soup broth.  My favorite dialogue takes place during the scene where Pedro walks into the kitchen to watch Tita make mole: ""Preparing the `mole', Tita Knew how contact with fire alters elements. How dough becomes a tortilla. And that a breast untouched by love's fire just isn't a breast, but a useless ball of dough"". This is the best hyperbole/simile that exactly describes my personal feelings. It is so relatable for anyone. ""In one instant Pedro had transformed Tita's breasts from chaste to voluptuous without even touching them"", Esquivel continues. It was a heated scene. Bottom line, you cannot keep lovers separate under one roof. And you cannot force someone to marry a person they don't love. It will only end tragic. Dona Elena finally sees that this living arrangement is not going to work. She suggests that Rosaura and Pedro move to San Antonio, TX in hopes she can keeps the lovers apart.  Dona Elena is obsessed with giving Tita orders and work to which drives her insane. She is released to the doctor for care for her behavior. Dr. John Brown uses an incredible analogy of a matchbox to the human heart, and the processes it should take to recover. If the viewer understands this scene then, the viewer too will understand the ending scene. Meanwhile, Dona Elena and Chencha faced trouble with a pack of malevolence men at the ranch. Dona Elena dies. Rosaura comes back home for the funeral of her mother and has a baby girl. Rosaura is stupid and wants her baby girl to go through the same tradition of taking care of her mother for life without marriage. Tita rejects the idea for what it has done to her own life. And what a surprise, Rosaura is still coming on to Pedro in the bedroom to no avail. She is like the third wheel. She is always sick and needy. She just does not get it. She is the last person to understand what is happening around her. I liked the idea of Dr. John marrying Tita. He was very nice and helpful. I felt bad that the marriage didn't follow through for him. Poor Dr. John Brown was left alone. Dr. John and Gertrudis are my favorite characters of the film. Gertrudis inspires Tita to take hold of what she wants.  Tita tells Dr. John that she cannot marry him. The film jumps well ahead into the future, which is my only complaint of the film.Finally, Rosaura died of too much gas and farts.  Her daughter Esperanza marries Dr. John's son. The ending comes full circle. This movie is well done, but now I have grown an appetite to read the book. It is a classic now. Note: the title, Like Water for Chocolate, refers to how water is simply added to chocolate in Mexico to make hot chocolate. Chocolate releases serotonin in the brain,  which creates the same sensations as if one were to be in love.",5,The things we do for love...,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,5096,"['water', 'Chocolate',

360527,A3JHO01J3H0GJ9,6303153305,"Leon Baradat ""Homebrewer""","[8, 13]","This movie was unbelievably awful.  It focuses heavily on metaphor, and I'm ok with metaphors--but I resent being expected to take them literally.  The ""heat"" of her sister's sexual arousal in the shower physically burned down the shower?  Is this some kind of joke?  Eating matches causes her bed to catch fire?  Are you %$#@ing kidding me?  The movie is full of these overblown metaphors, which would be fine in jest or as passing comments, but shown as physical happenings in a movie, they're just absurd.Add in the two-dimensional characters (which would be most of them) and the unrelenting cruelty of the heartless mother, which everyone reacts to with ""Oh, that's so sad, but I guess we just can't do anything about it"", and you come away thinking the moral of the story must be that it's ok to be an enabler for someone who treats you and your loved ones like dirt.I understand this is part of a genre called magic realism.  It seems to me that as with Socialist Realism, if you have to add the word ""realism"" to try to convince people there's something realistic about what you're portraying, you've already failed on that point.I felt intellectually insulted and emotionally abused by this movie.

It's considered to be a part of the magical realism realm of literature and art.  So you have to be willing to suspend disbelief and accept it as it is presented.  It tells the story about a family of women in Mexico in the late 1800s early 1900s.  The story spans generations within the family and examines the relationships, traditions, secrets and lives of the women.  It is a very female-centered story with extremely strong female characters all around.  In its simplest most boiled down version, it's a love story.  But it's so much more than that.  There aren't a lot of films with strong female characters but it's definitely rare to have the cast and plot dominated and carried by multiple strong female characters.  This film is chock full of strong women doing things that society says women should not do.

So I got the truncated version after reading the reviews.It's still an excellent film despite the cuts. This Mama Elena is a selfish, self centred woman to ruin three lives. Knowing her daughter Tita is in love with Pedro, she forbids Tita from marrying. Mama Elena insists on the tradition of the youngest girl is to look after her mother for life.Mama then proposes Pedro marry her other daughter Rosaura. He does it to get close to Tita. What follows is that Rosaura tries to make a sham marriage work while Tita and Pedro have to sneak around for some stolen moments.Like Water For Chocolate utilizes food as a metaphor for love and sex very well. Tita's feelings are conveyed through her cooking. The wedding cake she's bakes for her sister is filled with bitter tears. So all those who ate it longed for the love they can never have and ended up puking it all out.There's also a very sensual scene involving quail in rose petal sauce. I'm very tempted to try out the recipe myself. Tita's sister Gertrudis felt so aroused after consuming the dish that she ignited the bathroom, ran out naked and was scooped up but her future husband on horseback.As Tita and Pedro reach middle age, Rosaura dies and her daughter gets married. Now, the pair are free to be together. The ending is so sad and beautiful that you really have to watch it for yourself. What I can give away is that the pair is consumed by the flames of passion, literally.This DVD is accessible in Spanish (for that authentic feel) and English (so you do not have to pause often to read the subtitles like I did).

It is about a young girl whose life is pre-ordained to be that of a spinster caring for her parents.  In her youth, she falls in love but her domineering mother will not allow her to marry.  The story moves on from there in a way that amuses, endears, angers, and, occassionally, confuses us.  It has a kind of mystical nature to it and much of it is tied into the special family recipes.  Apparently, the original book was both novel and cook book.  This is probably not a good movie to see on an empty stomach.The acting is very good.  The role of the mother is excellently protrayed as cold, and calculating.  One sister is free-wheeling while the other tends to take after mom.  There are many other characters including a couple of suitors, maids, and others who give the story a multi-dimensioned flavor.  It is the heroine of the story, Tita, who carries the movie.  Her innocence, patience, sincerity et. al. leaves no doubt as to whom we are cheering for.  The ending is where some of the confusion comes in.  You can decide for yourselves what to think of it.  I might have chosen a different ending but it probably wouldn't have had the same impact that this movies brings.The version I saw is in Spanish with English subtitles which means that you have to pay attention.  I don't think many people watching this movie have had trouble paying attention.

The problem is that the film was originally released in a 144-minute version, and then was commercially released in a 113-minute version, and neither this Mexican-produced DVD nor the American equivalent apparently is more than 105 minutes long.  (Some ads even say that the Mexican issue is ""about 90 minutes"" -- whatever that means.)  So at best the Mexican release of the DVD, even if 105 minutes long, has cut out 39 minutes of the film!  As another reviewer asked, will it take us until Criterion finally decides to rescue the full film before we can have a look at the original 144-minute version on DVD?  Or even the full 113-minute version that was commercially released, perhaps with the other 31 minutes available as ""extra scenes""?  Or could the distributor do what other DVD distributors have done, and offer BOTH the 144-minute original release AND the 113-minute commercially released versions together on opposite sides of the same disc?  It is simply too much to have the only DVD versions available as truncated as this one and the currently available US version are.  This really is a missed opportunity for the distributor, and for the viewer as well.  Again, the film itself is wonderful, and a great companion to anyone who is reading the book (in Spanish or in English).

360554,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6303153305,Shashank Tripathi,"[25, 30]","""Como agua para chocolate"" is a fabulous feast of film, pun intended for the dollops of cooking that make a big chunk of the movie.Set in Mexico at the turn of the century, Tita is doomed never to marry. Her family's tradition requires the first born daughter to spend her life taking care of her mother until death. But Tita is in love with Pedro, and he with her. Since he cannot marry Tita, he asks for the hand of her sister, in order to be near Tita. Tita's third sister runs off with a group of guerillas fighting in the civil war. The movie follows Tita and Pedro through 1932.Along the way, the movie manages to develop some interesting themes about the roles of women in Mexico. The women in the movie are repressed in, and yet empowered by, the kitchen which gives them a mystical control over everyone who eats their meals. Tita, in particular, is forced into the kitchen by her mother and she learns to appropriate the kitchen as her tool of revenge. Food also creates a bound between women that eludes time.Mexican national identity is explored with the mix (often a clash) of cultures that seem to define Mexican History -- Spanish colonialism and its idiosynchracies, indigenous beliefs and traditions, and to an extent American influences.While not a deeply profound film, it is insightful, well done (no food pun intended) and a very refreshing change of tone for movie buffs -- the direction, the cinematography and the narrative lush with a magical quality. It's a tribute to an old vision of romantic love, a love that transcends time, and overcomes distance, madness, and even the direct interference of Tita's family. Some viewers may find this style and tone slow, even boring. But for those who enjoy contemplative film making this is a very enjoyable treat.If you care about movies that veer around culinary moments, ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" (Chinese) is another excellent movie to wrap your evening around.",4,A LIP-SMACKING TASTE OF MAGICAL REALISM,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,1929,"['Como', 'agua', 'para', 'chocolate', 'fabulous', 'feast', 'film', 'pun', 'intended', 'dollops', 'cooking', 'make', 'big', 'chunk', 'movie.Set', 'Mexico', 'turn', 'century', 'Tita', 'doomed', 'never', 'marry', 'family', 'tradition', 'first', 'born', 'daughter', 'spend', 'life', 'taking', 'care', 'mother', 'death', 'Tita', 'love', 'Pedro', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'Tita', 'hand', 'sister', 'order', 'be', 'near', 'Tita', 'Tita', 'third', 'sister', 'group', 'guerillas', 'fighting', 'civil', 'war', 'movie', 'Tita', 'Pedro', '1932.Along', 'way', 'movie', 'develop', 'interesting', 'themes', 'roles', 'women', 'Mexico', 'women', 'movie', 'are', 'repressed', 'yet', 'empowered', 'kitchen', 'mystical', 'control', 'everyone', 'who', 'meals', 'Tita', 'particular', 'forced', 'kitchen', 'mother', 'appropriate', 'kitchen', 'tool', 'revenge', 'Food', 'also', 'bound', 'women', 'eludes', 'time.Mexican', 'national', 'identity', 'explored', 'mix', 'often', 'clash', 'cultures', 'seem', 'define', 'Mexican', 'History', 'Spanish', 'colonialism', 'idiosynchracies', 'indigenous', 'beliefs', 'traditions', 'extent', 'American', 'influences.While', 'not', 'deeply', 'profound', 'film', 'insightful', 'well', 'done', 'food', 'pun', 'intended', 'very', 'refreshing', 'change', 'tone', 'movie', 'buffs', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'narrative', 'lush', 'magical', 'quality', 'tribute', 'old', 'vision', 'romantic', 'love', 'love', 'time', 'distance', 'madness', 'even', 'direct', 'interference', 'Tita', 'family', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'style', 'tone', 'slow', 'even', 'boring', 'who', 'enjoy', 'contemplative', 'film', 'making', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'treat.If', 'care', 'movies', 'veer', 'culinary', 'moments', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Chinese', 'excellent', 'movie', 'wrap', 'evening', 'around']",Like Water for Chocolate VHS
