The movie I would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress Juliette Marquis (from Ukraine no less). The image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video. I can undertand and accept that. This DVD however is a lousy Pan and Scan version. Some movies can be Pan and Scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future TV transfers in mind. But this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and didn't make room for transfer to fullscreen TV. It is intensely frustrating to watch this damned DVD. You watch noses talking to half faces, half faces talking to ears, heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly. I am furious at the studio a__holes at Hart Sharp Video who sanctioned this Pan and Scan monstrosity. And they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen. To add insult to injury, they show pictures on the back cover and the insert, of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the Pan and Scan cropped crap. Hart Sharp Video goes straight to my list of Never Buy From Again. By all means see this movie - at the theater.

After her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops Parkinson's Disease.  At 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life.  She juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by Rosario Dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher.  I really enjoyed this film but couldn't help but feel like the actress who portrayed Moon was doing her best Angelina Jolie impersonation, I mean she had Angelina down pat.  James Wood deserves an Oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down. I enjoyed this film, but like many other films I was frustrated with the story at times.  It seemed to be all over the place sometimes.  I never knew if the love story between Moon and her blind date was going anywhere, then we see Mon venture off into a new business, then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis'.

In a style not unlike a documentary Moon (Juliette Marquis, an impressive newcomer) shows us around a mini-camera rich home where she makes porn movies under the direction of Aronson (Tomas Arana), introduces her fellow porn stars and her friends (including Rosario Dawson as Martine), and ultimately brings us into her home life (she takes care of her Pops - James Woods - who suffers from Parkinson's Disease) and her past, including her reasons for entering into the porn star business.Along the way she meets an ordinary guy Kip (Kip Pardue) who suggests that Moon may be ready for a relationship.  Moon's friends gradually introduce her to a new role of 'sex investigator', using her seductive powers to test their boyfriends' or husbands' fidelity. One of these adventures results in an encounter with one Terry (Michael Rappaport) who has abusive issues that alter Moon's perception of her role.How Moon deals with the new direction her life is taking provides the climax of this film.  The movie is sparked by some very fine performances not only by Juliette Marquis, but also by James Woods, Kip Pardue, Ioan Grufford (Lancelot in KING ARTHUR), Rosario Dawson, and Tomas Arana.  THIS GIRL'S LIFE is an inside look at a thriving business that deserves this kind of examination.

It did, however, have a few redeeming qualities.The story is of a beautiful young woman in the porn business. She was not forced into it. The money is only part of it. She does it because she likes sex. She works on the internet and makes a good living. She also takes care of her father who suffers from Parkinson's disease.Through the course of the film, she undergoes a character change. She decides to go into the PI business investigating men for infidelity and that takes her to some even uglier parts of life. She seems amoral but there is some character in there. The problem is she is not sure what she wants. She thinks she may have found a boyfriend but is not sure. The factors in her life, stress, taking care of Pops, an aides scare, physical danger and such prompt an even stronger character change. Most people would consider it to be for the better.The end is ambiguous. You know she has cleaned up some aspects of her life but we are not really sure how thorough the cleaning is.The film is well acted and well done. The drama is real and some of the action is graphic.

Alhough he didn't appear until much later in the film, Michael Rapaport also gave an extremely effective performance - as a ""sexually-rejected man turned into a would-be rapist"" - very scary.

The story revisits different stages of herlife and the events that have impacted the person that shehad become. Moon doesn't see herself as one of the ""sadstories"" that you often hear about porn stars.  But, inreality, her life is a lot like what you hear, coming from abroken home, and using sex to deal with the difficulties ofher life.Despite Moon being a well known porn star whose dailynorms includes dealing with the hustle of the adultentertainment business, she manages to have a verysensitive and soft side that makes her very likeable. Shelives with her father (James Woods), who is terminally illand suffers from Parkinson's disease. Her love anddedication to care for her father shows a side of Moon thatmakes her more human as she copes with the challengesof caring for a parent who is ill.Moon puts porn on pause after being asked to test thefaithfulness of a friend's fianc&eacute; by playing femme fatale .Moon soon starts her own sex intelligence business.Moon learns the business quickly as she had done withthe porn business,  but also learns a very difficult lessonthat causes her to question the path she choose forherself.This film shows an introspective view of the life of a pornactress and the evolution that her life takes throughevents in her life.The film also gives a realist view of the porn industry. Forexample, explicit nudity,  realistic sex scenes, and fullfrontal scenes of both men and women.  But the film alsoshows the harsh reality that many porn actresses try tocamouflage, like drug use behind the scenes, pressure todo scenes that are not comfortable, and being exploitedby directors and producers all in the name of the almightydollar.Writer/director Ash did a good job in showing the life of aporn actress in front of and behind the scenes as while asthe personal life reality and everyday obstacles that theyface as human beings. But the story kinda lost its eroticismtowards the middle, and became a series of eventstowards the end of the movie.I also wanted to see more of Rosario Dawson in the movie.She played a small role and played more of a supportiveand intelligent type friend to Moon; she did not have anynudity or sex scenes in the movie.Newcomer, Juliette Marquis did an awesome job in playingthe role of Moon. I look forward to seeing more from her inthe near future.James Wood, as expected, did a great job in playing hischaracter role of a man who suffers from Parkinson'sdisease.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend themovie to anyone over 21.Four stars out of five.Reviewed by Natasha Brooks, editor-in-chief,Bare Back Magazine[...]Fairy Tales Can Come True: The Very Best Erotic Fairy Tales",4,This Girl's Life,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2741,"['Girl', 'Life', 'Moon', 'Juliette', 'Marquis', 'aninternet', 'porn', 'star', 'story', 'different', 'stages', 'herlife', 'events', 'have', 'impacted', 'person', 'shehad', 'become', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'sadstories', 'often', 'hear', 'porn', 'stars', 'inreality', 'life', 'lot', 'what', 'hear', 'coming', 'abroken', 'home', 'using', 'sex', 'deal', 'difficulties', 'ofher', 'life.Despite', 'Moon', 'being', 'well', 'known', 'porn', 'star', 'dailynorms', 'dealing', 'hustle', 'adultentertainment', 'business', 'have', 'verysensitive', 'soft', 'side', 'very', 'likeable', 'Shelives', 'father', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'terminally', 'illand', 'suffers', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'love', 'anddedication', 'care', 'father', 'side', 'Moon', 'more', 'human', 'challengesof', 'caring', 'parent', 'who', 'ill.Moon', 'puts', 'porn', 'pause', 'being', 'asked', 'test', 'thefaithfulness', 'friend', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'playing', 'femme', 'fatale', '.Moon', 'soon', 'own', 'sex', 'intelligence', 'business.Moon', 'business', 'quickly', 'had', 'done', 'withthe', 'porn', 'business', 'also', 'very', 'difficult', 'lessonthat', 'question', 'path', 'choose', 'forherself.This', 'film', 'introspective', 'view', 'life', 'pornactress', 'evolution', 'life', 'throughevents', 'life.The', 'film', 'also', 'realist', 'view', 'porn', 'industry', 'Forexample', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'realistic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'fullfrontal', 'scenes', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'harsh', 'reality', 'many', 'porn', 'actresses', 'try', 'tocamouflage', 'drug', 'use', 'scenes', 'pressure', 'todo', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'comfortable', 'being', 'exploitedby', 'directors', 'producers', 'name', 'almightydollar.Writer/director', 'Ash', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'life', 'aporn', 'actress', 'front', 'scenes', 'asthe', 'personal', 'life', 'reality', 'everyday', 'obstacles', 'theyface', 'human', 'beings', 'story', 'kinda', 'lost', 'eroticismtowards', 'middle', 'became', 'series', 'eventstowards', 'end', 'movie.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'movie.She', 'played', 'small', 'role', 'played', 'more', 'supportiveand', 'intelligent', 'type', 'friend', 'Moon', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anynudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie.Newcomer', 'Juliette', 'Marquis', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'playingthe', 'role', 'Moon', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'inthe', 'future.James', 'Wood', 'expected', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'hischaracter', 'role', 'man', 'who', ""Parkinson'sdisease.Overall"", 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'themovie', 'anyone', '21.Four', 'stars', 'five.Reviewed', 'Natasha', 'Brooks', 'editor-in-chief', 'Bare', 'Back', 'Magazine', '[', ']', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'Can', 'Come', 'True', 'Very', 'Best', 'Erotic', 'Fairy', 'Tales']",This Girl's Life

All the actors deliver their lines with a crisp delivery that makes you think that they are reciting Shakespeare and that Method Acting never reared it's mumbling head. The camera work is excellent and the characters are engaging enough.The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know if it wants to be the sleazy movie that it's advertised as, or a serious drama about a woman trying to care for her father with Parkinson's disease. James Woods is giving it his all as the one character in the movie that mumbles and stumbles and falls. He's got enough energy to let you know that he was once a powerful figure and the way the disease tears into him is that much more heart breaking.The only problem is that he's acting the hell out of this tragic character in the middle of a sleazy sex movie. So every time he shows up, he's distracting from a Skinemax scene, and as much as I admire the man's acting, he's not so good of an actor that his tragic character can overcome his interruption of the sleazy parts.So this could have been a good movie - or it could have been two separate good movies, but instead it's one big mess.",3,Strangely uneven movie,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1229,"['movie', 'trashy', 'Skinemax', 'flick', 'sure', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'quality', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'crisp', 'delivery', 'think', 'are', 'reciting', 'Shakespeare', 'Method', 'Acting', 'never', 'reared', 'mumbling', 'head', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough.The', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'sleazy', 'movie', 'advertised', 'serious', 'drama', 'woman', 'trying', 'care', 'father', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'James', 'Woods', 'giving', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'mumbles', 'stumbles', 'falls', 'got', 'enough', 'energy', 'let', 'know', 'was', 'once', 'powerful', 'figure', 'way', 'disease', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'only', 'problem', 'acting', 'hell', 'tragic', 'character', 'middle', 'sleazy', 'sex', 'movie', 'So', 'time', 'up', 'distracting', 'Skinemax', 'scene', 'as', 'much', 'admire', 'man', 'acting', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'actor', 'tragic', 'character', 'can', 'overcome', 'interruption', 'sleazy', 'parts.So', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'separate', 'good', 'movies', 'instead', 'one', 'big', 'mess']",This Girl's Life

The situations she was put in were transparent and lacked any grounding in a rational mind. If she was this big porn SUPERSTAR then why can't she afford a nurse to care for her ""Parkinson's disease-suffering"" father when she is gone?  Would not starting a business based on trying to make people cheat be dangerous?  Would saying you can ""take on"" twenty guys be a bad move?  I know that was not Moon but the stupidity is not limited to her story.
