1217645,A1BM7TP9L9WDXR,B001MUJFGC,"Paul Ess. ""I almost care.""","[10, 10]","It's a surprise to everyone (including yours truly) when beautiful socialite Polly Dean gives up a life of luxury in opulent West London to go and live in a grotty flat in ruthless Battersea and work at a chilly chocolate factory with a bunch of raucous, moral-less, bee-hived slappers.Such is the plot of 'Up The Junction' (the title refers to Clapham Junction Railway Station around which much of the film is set), a gritty but reassuring drama in the vague style of 'Cathy Come Home'.Although Polly's reasons for abandoning her pampered lifestyle are a bit obtuse - she alludes that it makes her sick ('yeuchh' is how she describes it), and she appears genuinely happy in her new environment of sling-backs, pop culture, abortion and random drunken violence.Polly gets involved with Sylvie and Rube; two dayglo sisters straight from the 'Knees Up Muvva Brahn' school of tarts-with-a-heart-of-gold; and their mother - a twitching, screeching harpy.She also finds herself a boyfriend - Peter: a gold-digging charmer with ideas well above his furniture-removal-boy station.'UTJ's main bone of controversy was a long, heart-breaking abortion sequence. Terminations were illegal in the UK at the time the film came out with the law just on the cusp of change, and while it does appear slightly preachy, it's vitally handled sympathetically.From the disgusting hardware store hiding an appalling upstairs sideline, to the screaming culmination at victim Rube's home; the whole section is sickeningly believable.Nothing explicit, just unpleasant sweaty close-ups of panic-stricken, mascara-lined faces, mouths howling to the Heavens between curses, in emotional pleas for respite.All this is offset by with a dream-like stroll by Polly along Wimbledon Common, where she seems to glide through all the stages of life. Babies wail, couples grope, oldies stroll hand-in-hand, with everything in-between and particularly poignant is the sight of a tiny black toddler feeding a swan three times the size she is.With Manfred Mann's smashing soundtrack at full volume it all seems a little clumsy and crass - but it works.Director Peter Collinson ('Fright', 'the Italian Job', 'Straight on Til Morning') has a nose for realism, and utilises it to the absolute maximum - hitting hard when he has to, but still finding beauty and humour in even the most bleak and difficult of situations.'UTJ' looks like a forceful history lesson, but unlike 'Quadrophenia' or 'the Knack' it's no meaningless nostalgia trip or tourist film for the modern viewer. It has brilliant locations (showing London as it exists no longer), the starkly beautiful Battersea Power Station, a marvel of 1930's modernism, seems to be observing every scene - dominating the industrial sky-line like a gothic Hammer castle, only relinquishing its surveillance at the end credits.The cast is great too. 70's scream queen Suzy Kendall plays Polly; the impossibly handsome Dennis Waterman is Peter; notable theatre actress Maureen Lipman is Sylvie and the unfortunate Rube is played quirkily by disappeared-without-trace Adrienne Posta.No frills on this one: rude, garish and brutal - but compelling, funny and human at the same time.The dvd transfer is excellent; intimately revealing the exquisite nature of the simple personal stories hidden away in the vast 'Scope framing.",5,"""And So It's My Assumption, I'm Really.....""",1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,3329,"['surprise', 'everyone', 'including', 'yours', 'truly', 'when', 'beautiful', 'socialite', 'Polly', 'Dean', 'up', 'life', 'luxury', 'opulent', 'West', 'London', 'go', 'live', 'grotty', 'flat', 'ruthless', 'Battersea', 'work', 'chilly', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'bunch', 'raucous', 'moral-less', 'bee-hived', 'slappers.Such', 'plot', 'Junction', 'title', 'refers', 'Clapham', 'Junction', 'Railway', 'Station', 'much', 'film', 'set', 'gritty', 'reassuring', 'drama', 'vague', 'style', ""'Cathy"", 'Come', ""Home'.Although"", 'Polly', 'reasons', 'abandoning', 'pampered', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'bit', 'sick', 'how', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'new', 'environment', 'sling-backs', 'pop', 'culture', 'abortion', 'random', 'drunken', 'violence.Polly', 'involved', 'Sylvie', 'Rube', 'two', 'dayglo', 'sisters', 'straight', ""'Knees"", 'Muvva', 'Brahn', 'school', 'tarts-with-a-heart-of-gold', 'mother', 'twitching', 'screeching', 'harpy.She', 'also', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'gold-digging', 'charmer', 'ideas', 'well', 'furniture-removal-boy', 'station', 'main', 'bone', 'controversy', 'was', 'long', 'heart-breaking', 'abortion', 'sequence', 'Terminations', 'were', 'illegal', 'UK', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'law', 'just', 'cusp', 'change', 'appear', 'slightly', 'preachy', 'vitally', 'handled', 'disgusting', 'hardware', 'store', 'hiding', 'appalling', 'upstairs', 'sideline', 'screaming', 'culmination', 'victim', 'Rube', 'home', 'whole', 'section', 'sickeningly', 'believable.Nothing', 'explicit', 'just', 'unpleasant', 'sweaty', 'close-ups', 'panic-stricken', 'mascara-lined', 'mouths', 'howling', 'Heavens', 'curses', 'emotional', 'pleas', 'respite.All', 'offset', 'dream-like', 'stroll', 'Polly', 'Wimbledon', 'Common', 'where', 'glide', 'stages', 'life', 'Babies', 'wail', 'couples', 'grope', 'oldies', 'stroll', 'hand-in-hand', 'everything', 'in-between', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'sight', 'tiny', 'black', 'toddler', 'feeding', 'swan', 'three', 'times', 'size', 'Manfred', 'Mann', 'smashing', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'volume', 'little', 'clumsy', 'crass', 'works.Director', 'Peter', 'Collinson', ""'Fright"", 'Italian', 'Job', ""'Straight"", 'Til', 'Morning', 'nose', 'realism', 'absolute', 'maximum', 'hitting', 'hard', 'when', 'still', 'finding', 'beauty', 'humour', 'even', 'most', 'bleak', 'difficult', 'situations', 'looks', 'forceful', 'history', 'lesson', ""'Quadrophenia"", ""'the"", 'Knack', 'meaningless', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'tourist', 'film', 'modern', 'viewer', 'brilliant', 'locations', 'showing', 'London', 'no', 'longer', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'Battersea', 'Power', 'Station', 'marvel', '1930', 'modernism', 'be', 'observing', 'scene', 'dominating', 'industrial', 'sky-line', 'gothic', 'Hammer', 'castle', 'only', 'relinquishing', 'surveillance', 'end', 'credits.The', 'cast', 'great', 'too', '70', 'scream', 'queen', 'Suzy', 'Kendall', 'Polly', 'impossibly', 'handsome', 'Dennis', 'Waterman', 'Peter', 'notable', 'theatre', 'actress', 'Maureen', 'Lipman', 'Sylvie', 'unfortunate', 'Rube', 'played', 'quirkily', 'disappeared-without-trace', 'Adrienne', 'Posta.No', 'one', 'rude', 'garish', 'brutal', 'compelling', 'funny', 'human', 'same', 'time.The', 'dvd', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'intimately', 'revealing', 'exquisite', 'nature', 'simple', 'personal', 'stories', 'hidden', 'away', 'vast', ""'Scope"", 'framing']",Up the Junction [Region 2]
1217646,A1AHYCO2YWXXG5,B001MUJFGC,"Privacy, Please","[1, 1]","Polly, a rich girl in mid-60s London, decides to take a job in a factory in the working-class neighborhood of Battersea, get her own little old apartment nearby, and live on what she makes.  Her motivations for doing this are unclear through about the first half of the film, to the point where you wonder if she's doing a senior thesis on poverty or covertly writing a book, until she finally explains herself by making remarks about how money makes people ""false"" and how the poor people of Battersea are more ""real"" with their loud expression of emotions right down to profanity and street-fighting - including girls and even middle-aged mums as combatants. You don't get to see anything of her family life and have no idea if she doesn't get along with her parents or how they feel about their heiress daughter living and working in the slums.Polly befriends a pair of dolly-bird sisters, Sylvie and Rube, who work with her at the factory.  They can tell she's probably rich, but they don't much care as long as she's not stuck-up.  Then Polly falls in love with Peter, who's the typical handsome young working-class hero who hates his constrained, economically limited existence and wants to be upwardly mobile.  Unlike Sylvie and Rube, Peter can tell Polly's rich, but he very much DOES care - the fact that she's wealthy and more cultured and mannerly and ""different"" from the other girls is why Peter likes her.  However, the love affair makes little sense because Polly and Pete don't seem to have anything in common to bond over.  She gets excited over going bowling and eating a plate of cockles from a stand, while he wants to drive around in expensive sportscars and eat at fancy restaurants that bore her to death.  One wonders why Polly didn't choose to date any number of lower-class blokes who would be perfectly content to take her to local pubs on their motorbikes once a week.  The other weird part of this film is how Polly sees first-hand her new friends going through tragedies such as abortion, accidental death, and prison, and if she hung around long enough she'd probably see people going hungry and homeless too, but it never seems to put her off her romantic ideals of how cool poor people are compared to rich people.  It all makes a bit of an odd story, set against a little bit of swinging London - the girls dress up in mod outfits and hairdoes, but have no ambition to get further involved in ""Swinging London"" or venture beyond Battersea.I can think of so many ways this film could have been more realistically scripted, such as having all these folks hang out at some disco or clothing store that attracted different social classes and meet in that way, rather than by having an obviously posh rich girl come to work at a factory.  (This film could only have been set in the 60s since later than that, jobs would have been scarce enough to either keep her from getting one, or incur her coworkers' wrath for taking a job from someone who truly needed it.) Might also have been interesting if Polly actually went through some hardship herself, instead of just watching everybody else's.  I half expected Polly to be acting out the tried-and-true theme of a rich person disguised as a poor person, trying to find people who'd love her for herself without expecting her money to be part of the package, but instead she seems to just be on a crusade against money generally. Pete might have been a poor boy who made good (lots of poor London boys made good in the 60s) and started dating the rich girl of his dreams, only to find she didn't appreciate his accomplishments.  But it is what it is.  Still manages to be intriguing, although I think Adrienne Posta as cute spunky Rube steals the show from Suzy Kendall as Polly, who seems childishly overjoyed by every piece of rubbish she sees in the Battersea streets.This isn't quite a kitchen sink drama, although it has some of the same basic themes of social class struggle, relationships mismatched between different classes, and forbidden sex leading to some awful consequences.  It's on the cusp where kitchen sink started shifting to Swinging London, same as ""Billy Liar"" and ""Georgy Girl"", but ends up darker than either of those.  The characterizations of the Battersea folks are pretty enjoyable (and people from that place and time have said they are true to life as well), and there are some funny moments.  In the end I think the filmmaker was trying to make a point about high-class rich people who go slumming, that they're always going to have a safety net and be insulated from the real troubles of the people with whom they're hanging out.  That seemed a bit harsh on Polly given how loyal she was to her female friends.  (Oh, and the Manfred Mann soundtrack is an absolute gem if you like 60s dreamy psych-pop.0",4,Far-fetched but intriguing nonetheless,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,4811,"['Polly', 'rich', 'girl',
