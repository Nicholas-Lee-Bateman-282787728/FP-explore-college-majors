I had only ever seen her as the 'sex kitten' type in her previous films and I was so glad I got to see her in this.  This may have been a year prior to her TV performance in 'A Streetcar Named Desire', but I could be wrong.  (Another bravo acting job!)If I remember correctly it was based on a true story of a dying mother who made sure that she found a proper home(s) for all of her kids before she died.  The story is so moving and actors were all just wonderful.  I would love to see this movie again.If it isn't available on VHS or DVD it REALLY should be!p.s. Why isn't there an Ann-Margret box set of films available by now?

566669,AXVKMYWNIHK7W,B00005420H,"Terri ""3kids-at-home""","[3, 4]","This is the all time tear jerker. Starring Ann-Margret, this is a true story of Lucille Frey. She is a mother of ten children ranging in ages 2-14 years of age. She is married to an alcoholic man with arthritis in his hands, and he's in denial that she is dying of breast cancer. He thinks that life is a bowl of cherries because Lucille always is there for him and his children. The children are all well behaved, and really enjoy life even though they're poor. When Lucille finds out that her cancer can't be cured, she decides to find families for her children in fear that the state will take them away from her husband when she's gone. The first child to be given away is the baby, little Stephen. He is so pitiful when the young couple comes to pick him up to take him home with them. He cries his eyes out as if Ann-Margret is really his mother in real life. I cried right along with him, having kids of my own, I can't imagine giving them away like that. Lucille Frey made sure each child liked the family they went to, and had them go for over-night visits before making her final decision. One by one, the children were given away, and one day Lucille wakes up and imagines her children coming home to see her one last time before she dies, and begs her husband to let her see her kids one more time. He buys her a ticket to travel to each child's new home, and gets to see her kids again for the last time. Later, at Lucille's funeral, the children gather around her grave and notice their father there, standing in the distance, and goes over to see him too. It's so heart wrenching, so grap some tissue and enjoy this true story of love, trust and pure faith. This is a wonderful classic starring Ann-Margret as Lucille Frey.",5,Everyone will cry watching this movie,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,1738,"['time', 'tear', 'jerker', 'Starring', 'Ann-Margret', 'true', 'story', 'Lucille', 'Frey', 'mother', 'ten', 'children', 'ranging', 'ages', '2-14', 'years', 'age', 'married', 'alcoholic', 'man', 'arthritis', 'hands', 'denial', 'dying', 'breast', 'cancer', 'life', 'bowl', 'cherries', 'Lucille', 'always', 'there', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'well', 'behaved', 'really', 'enjoy', 'life', 'even', ""'re"", 'poor', 'When', 'Lucille', 'out', 'cancer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'cured', 'find', 'families', 'children', 'fear', 'state', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'husband', 'when', 'gone', 'first', 'child', 'be', 'given', 'away', 'baby', 'little', 'Stephen', 'so', 'pitiful', 'when', 'young', 'couple', 'pick', 'up', 'take', 'home', 'eyes', 'out', 'Ann-Margret', 'really', 'mother', 'real', 'life', 'cried', 'right', 'along', 'having', 'kids', 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'giving', 'away', 'Lucille', 'Frey', 'made', 'sure', 'child', 'liked', 'family', 'went', 'had', 'go', 'over-night', 'visits', 'making', 'final', 'decision', 'One', 'one', 'children', 'were', 'given', 'away', 'one', 'day', 'Lucille', 'up', 'imagines', 'children', 'coming', 'home', 'see', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'husband', 'let', 'see', 'kids', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'ticket', 'travel', 'child', 'new', 'home', 'see', 'kids', 'again', 'last', 'time', 'Later', 'Lucille', 'funeral', 'children', 'gather', 'grave', 'notice', 'father', 'there', 'standing', 'distance', 'see', 'too', 'so', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'grap', 'tissue', 'enjoy', 'true', 'story', 'love', 'trust', 'pure', 'faith', 'wonderful', 'classic', 'starring', 'Ann-Margret', 'Lucille', 'Frey']",Who Will Love My Children?

566670,A1Z6U3MDHU58L2,B00005420H,"Terry E. Benn ""Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","I will try not to duplicate other reviews of this incredibly touching True Story of a beautiful, caring, happy and loving Wife and Mother of ten (countem!) 10 beautiful children. Lucile Fray discovers she has an incurable illness. Since her husband, tho he loves his wife and children with his whole heart; has a problem himself that would exclude him from raising their children alone, Lucile spends the remainder of her time on this Earth finding a home for each of her 10 children. Fredric Forest gives a great performance. Ann-Margret's performance was one, if not the BEST, performance of her career.She WAS Lucile Fray. Every scene was spot-on. I must warn you, you will be in tears throughout this movie. And the knowledge that this is a true story, keeps those tears flowing. .I could not stop the flow of tears. the incredible heartbreak both parents and each child felt having to split up one from the other...Traci Gold (Growing Pains) and Solie Moon Frye portrayed 2 of the younger girls. each and ever child actor's performances were impecable. The toddler boy screamed and cried uncontrollably when being taken away from him Mommy and brothers and sisters. It was amazing how this cast bonded so tightly to give such an unforgettable tribute to this amazing woman who putthe future lives of her children above her own pain and suffering.
