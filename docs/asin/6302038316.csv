Deathstalker 2 is one of them. It's a movie that crams about all the fun you could ask for into 77 minutes. It's a great mix of comedy, action, fantasy, and even horror. There is a scene featuring zombies, which I didn't expect since this isn't a zombie movie. It's a sword and sorcery movie, and it's one of the films included in the Roger Corman's Sword and Sorcery collection. Toni Naples is great in this movie, playing a tough and sexy villianess. It's the kind of role that Julie Strain would perfect in the Andy Sidaris movies she starred in the 90's.

293210,A14LV2SJSR3102,6302038316,Cartimand,"[5, 6]","From the moment, in the opening sequence, when Sultana's (the delicious Toni Naples) vow ""I'll have my revenge - and Deathstalker too"", heralds the title - ""Deathstalker 2"" on screen, accompanied by Chuck Cirino's amazing score, I fell totally in love with this movie! No sad Conan clone this!Cult director Jim Wynorski has quite simply given us one of the most entertaining movies of all time.The masterful casting of John Terleskey as our wisecracking hero and the gorgeous, scantily-clad Monique Gabrielle in her inspired double-role, ensures a whole laboratory of sexual chemistry between the highly picturesque duo. They also look like they're enjoying this bawdy romp no end!The unprecedented amount of inspired one-liners, corny puns and cheeky verbal and visual references to other movies (most notably Spaghetti Westerns, Hammer Horror and Star Wars) demand repeat viewing to extract every delicious drop of Wynorsky's waggery.The plot is a simple one - our eponymous hero (but is Deathstalker his first name or his last name?), promised a great reward, teams up with Evie the seer (Gabrielle), whose rightful position of princess has been taken by an evil clone of herself (evil Evie of course). Battling their way past zombies, pirates, and Amazon tribeswomen, Terleskey and Gabrielle never miss an opportunity to extract every potential bit of humour from each scenario. The other players join in the fun too - John La Zar, as evil wizard (is there any other kind?) Jerak warns Deathstalker that grave-robbing carries a stiff penalty in these parts, Sultana pokes fun at Evie's wardrobe (the Wilma Flintstone look) and pirate Chin (a tribute to Hawaii 5-O) and his hapless team are to bounty-hunting what the Archbishop of Canterbury is to bungee-jumping.Scene follows glorious scene, my personal favourites being the initial punch-up in the tavern, evil Evie tiring of her musical dwarf playing nothing but the Deathstalker theme, Deathstalker's hilarious fight against the Amazon's champion and , of course, the final scene - when told that his heroic exploits will be reenacted for centuries to come, Deathstalker grins and says ""Well, I sure hope they get a good looking guy to play me"". What a parting shot!There's no mistaking the miniscule budget here, and there's even some footage recycled from the (inferior) Deathstalker 1 and a couple of amusing inadvertent anachronisms and continuity errors. With a movie as refreshingly entertaining as this, who cares though?The DVD contains the outtakes (the same as were also present during the end titles on the VHS version), the theatrical trailer and, delightfully, optional full-length commentary by Wynorsky, Terleskey and Naples. This is very very funny, and adds yet another dimension to the whole package, as Wynorsky flirts with Naples and points out anachronisms, such as a tyre visible as our heroes ride past.For potential UK purchasers, make sure your DVD player is multi-region, as this is only available as Region 1 (NTSC). My copy took around 10 days to arrive from the States. At this price, Deathstalker 2 has to be the DVD bargain of the century!You will either think it is brilliant or complete garbage!

I never heard of the ""Detahstalker"" straight-to-video franchise before this flick, but enjoyed it anyway.

Deathstalker, free-booting adventurer, steps in to save the life of the impoverished Reena, a fortuneteller marked for death by angry customers (she foretells the birth of children to men other than husbands).  Reena, as it turns out, is a princess deposed by Jarek the sorcerer.  In her place, Jarek has installed Reena's magically-created clone - but the process that created the clone won't allow Jarek to kill the original.  There's also Sultana, a warrior who's as beautiful as she is fiercely insistent to...Oh, does it matter what it's about?  You'll probably forget about it two minutes after your player has spat the tape out.  (Did somebody make this available on DVD?)  However, ""Deathstalker"" is one of those flicks that taps into its own flaws in a good way.  Much like the story and the main character, ""Deathstalker"" seems like a good-natured relic of a lost age, never really following any path other than that that provides some (cheap) thrills.  Nowhere near as poorly solemn as the ""Ator"" movies, nor as just misguided as ""Barbarians"", ""Deathstalker"" is a movie you just know is junk, yet one you can sit through.

So you could choose between the normal version and the Director's Cut. What this would mean is that the disc would skip the clips of DS1 and Barbarian Queen and the extra long fight footage to make it a more concise viewing experience. Although not having this option isn't worth dropping a star as you still get to see everything but have to skip the bits yourself. More out-takes would have been nice, but I guess you'll have to live with the ones in the credits.",5,"""Is that your first name or your last name?""",1022025600,"05 22, 2002",2002,1152,"['Deathstalker', 'II', 'RULES', 'best', 'low-budget', 'comedy', 'fantasy', 'T', 'A', 'filled', 'epic', 'EVER.But', 'enough', 'film', 'know', 'great', 'DVD.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'fine', 'best', 'turn', 'brightness', 'up', 'tv', 'quite', 'dark', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'fault', 'have', 'brighter', 'VHS', 'version', 'just', 'faded', '.This', 'not', 'cropped', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'full', 'picture', 'cars', 'spare', 'tires', 'too.Audio', 'addiquate', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'deathstalker', 'II', 'theme.Extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'informative', 'funny', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'make', 'trailer', 'to.Bad', 'Points', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'had', 'multistream', 'option', 'T2', 'disc', 'could', 'choose', 'normal', 'version', 'Director', 'Cut', 'What', 'would', 'mean', 'disc', 'would', 'skip', 'clips', 'DS1', 'Barbarian', 'Queen', 'extra', 'long', 'fight', 'footage', 'make', 'more', 'concise', 'viewing', 'experience', 'not', 'having', 'option', ""n't"", 'worth', 'dropping', 'star', 'still', 'get', 'see', 'everything', 'have', 'skip', 'bits', 'More', 'out-takes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'live', 'ones', 'credits']",Deathstalker 2 VHS
