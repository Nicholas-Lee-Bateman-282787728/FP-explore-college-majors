505147,A3N9D7Q4JC7494,B00000IXOG,AvidReader,"[1, 1]","Jennifer Kries combines ballet, pilates, and yoga into a flowing, well-instructed set of exercises.  She empathizes control, balance, and focus to get the most out of each movement, and her instruction is motivating without being annoying.  The choice of exercises is balanced and the pace is challenging but achievable.  I initially feared that the live drumming of the soundtrack would be too repetitive, but I actually find it enjoyable and well-suited to the workout.  The workout is divided into four 15-minute chapters (Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs), which makes each segment long enough for results but manageable when time is limited.There are some advanced Pilates movements (particularly in the Abs section) as well as several ballet movements - and no instructor showing modifications - so this DVD might frustrate someone who is brand new to Pilates.  It is probably best suited to those who have at least some Pilates experience and are looking for a strong ""fusion"" workout to balance out their repertoire.Most of the content has been covered in other reviews, so I'll just add a few thoughts that might be useful.  First, the Abs section starts with a somewhat long segment about posture and breathing.  Those concepts are crucial to the practice of Pilates, but it might have been nice if they were covered separately to save the time.  However, the Abs section makes up for the lost minutes - in fact, there are days I'm GLAD it's shortened a few minutes :-) Second, the ""Hips"" and ""Thighs"" sections use several of the same exercises, with the exception of the yoga poses (Sun Salutations, Warrior, Awkward Chair, Lunges) that dominate the Thighs section.Overall, a fantastic workout!",5,Energizing and Motivating,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,1696,"['Jennifer', 'Kries', 'ballet', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'flowing', 'well-instructed', 'set', 'exercises', 'control', 'balance', 'focus', 'get', 'most', 'movement', 'instruction', 'motivating', 'being', 'annoying', 'choice', 'exercises', 'balanced', 'pace', 'challenging', 'achievable', 'initially', 'feared', 'live', 'drumming', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'repetitive', 'actually', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'well-suited', 'workout', 'workout', 'divided', 'four', '15-minute', 'chapters', 'Abs', 'Arms', 'Hips', 'Thighs', 'segment', 'long', 'enough', 'results', 'manageable', 'when', 'time', 'are', 'advanced', 'Pilates', 'movements', 'particularly', 'Abs', 'section', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'ballet', 'movements', 'instructor', 'showing', 'modifications', 'so', 'DVD', 'might', 'frustrate', 'someone', 'who', 'brand', 'new', 'Pilates', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'who', 'have', 'least', 'Pilates', 'experience', 'are', 'looking', 'strong', 'fusion', 'workout', 'balance', 'out', 'repertoire.Most', 'content', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'few', 'thoughts', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'First', 'Abs', 'section', 'somewhat', 'long', 'segment', 'posture', 'breathing', 'concepts', 'are', 'crucial', 'practice', 'Pilates', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'were', 'covered', 'separately', 'save', 'time', 'However', 'Abs', 'section', 'up', 'lost', 'minutes', 'fact', 'are', 'days', ""'m"", 'GLAD', 'shortened', 'few', 'minutes', 'Second', 'Hips', 'Thighs', 'sections', 'use', 'several', 'same', 'exercises', 'exception', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'Warrior', 'Awkward', 'Chair', 'Lunges', 'dominate', 'Thighs', 'section.Overall', 'fantastic', 'workout']","The Method - Pilates Target Specifics: Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs VHS"

I must admit that at first I thought that using those light weights wouldn't do much, but now I can see that the point is about having fluidity of motion with control, as well as awareness of the core. The weights just create a gentle resistance to the movement. I had to get past the mindset of my old weight training days in order to appreciate the value of using light weights through these various ranges of motion.As a relatively uncoordinated (in terms of dance movements) 46 year old male, I found the ballet type moves that are incorporated in the third section to be something that will really help me with my balance. The movements weren't that hard to grasp and were an interesting challenge.If someone has never done Pilates or Yoga before they should probably start with something that explains the basics of those disciplines. Stott Pilates Basics is a great program for Pilates and Yoga Zone Basics is a great place to start with Yoga.Once you have an idea of the fundamentals of those approaches then you will at least have some background in which to try this program. It moves fast and fluidly without much explanation so you will want to have some experience before trying this.Highly recommended!",5,"Amazing Blend of Pilates, Yoga and Dance exercises.",1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,1998,"['just', 'did', 'Jennifer', 'Krie', 'Target', 'Specifics', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'got', 'great', 'workout', 'was', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'it.While', 'program', 'designed', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'done', '15', 'minute', 'self', 'contained', 'increments', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'one', 'long', 'session', 'very', 'short', 'breaks', 'sections.The', 'individual', 'sections', 'were', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'can', 'easily', 'benefit', 'someone', 'who', 'pressed', 'time', 'get', 'Pilates/Yoga', 'Ballet', 'type', 'in.The', 'format', 'program', 'so', 'well', 'explained', 'other', 'reviewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'so', 'well.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'do', 'program', 'just', 'Yoga', 'type', 'mat', 'set', 'very', 'light', 'hand', 'weights', 'must', 'admit', 'first', 'thought', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'having', 'fluidity', 'motion', 'control', 'as', 'well', 'awareness', 'core', 'weights', 'just', 'create', 'gentle', 'resistance', 'movement', 'had', 'get', 'mindset', 'old', 'weight', 'training', 'days', 'order', 'appreciate', 'value', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'various', 'ranges', 'motion.As', 'relatively', 'uncoordinated', 'terms', 'dance', 'movements', '46', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'found', 'ballet', 'type', 'moves', 'are', 'incorporated', 'third', 'section', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'really', 'help', 'balance', 'movements', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'grasp', 'were', 'interesting', 'challenge.If', 'someone', 'never', 'done', 'Pilates', 'should', 'probably', 'start', 'something', 'basics', 'disciplines', 'Stott', 'Pilates', 'Basics', 'great', 'program', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Basics', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'Yoga.Once', 'have', 'idea', 'fundamentals', 'approaches', 'then', 'will', 'least', 'have', 'background', 'try', 'program', 'fast', 'fluidly', 'much', 'explanation', 'will', 'want', 'have', 'experience', 'trying', 'this.Highly', 'recommended']","The Method - Pilates Target Specifics: Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs VHS"

Between those three videos, she covers a lot of ground- anyone who enjoys yoga, Pilates and dance would do well to take a look at those.  When I heard about about Target Specifics, I wasn't sure that I would find a whole lot that I didn't already have in that series.  Curiousity got the best of me, and I made the purchase.This is a great DVD to have in your collection.  If you're short on time, you can pick the area that you need to work on that day.  If you want to make this a full workout, you can use the entire program.For abs, Kries includes almost the entire Intermediate Pilates mat program.  As with all Pilates programs, proper form is important here if you want to feel the work.  If you're new to Pilates, you may want to watch this section a few times before you join in.For the arms and upperbody, Kries uses most of the Standing Sculpting series as well as a few yoga-inspired moves.  A lot of people have mixed feelings about this work.  It would be very difficult to get large muscles or even gain significant upper body strength using these light dumbbells (3 to 5 lbs is the maximum recommended).  However, proper technique will contribute to overall integrated strenght, that is, properly using your center as well as your limbs.  Again, this may be better done after viewing a few times.At first glance, there is quite a bit of repetition between the Thighs and Hips section, and that can be annoying.  However, upon closer examination, there are enough differences to justify doing both sections.  The Hips section is predominantly ballet and Pilates movements.  The moves here concentrate on lateral movement, thus more effectively targeting the hips.  A bunch of plies as well as tendus and degages (ballet kicks) are performed here.  You may want to modify if you have sensitive knees.The Thighs section uses a small bit of ballet and Pilates, concentrating on yoga.  This section includes Sun Salutations (sneaking in some upper body strengthening as well), Awkward Chairs/Fierce Pose and Lunges (again, modify if your knees are not your strong suit).There is quite a bit of overlap between this and Kries' newer offerings.  However, it would be a good way to introduce yourself to her fusion-style in small pieces before you take the plunge into some of her longer tapes.",4,"Great &quot;non-traditional&quot;, parts toning",1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,2382,"['first', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'purchases', 'were', 'newest', 'set', 'New/Pilates', 'Method', 'Between', 'three', 'videos', 'lot', 'ground-', 'anyone', 'who', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'dance', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'take', 'look', 'When', 'heard', 'about', 'Target', 'Specifics', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'find', 'whole', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'series', 'Curiousity', 'got', 'best', 'made', 'purchase.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'collection', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'can', 'pick', 'area', 'need', 'work', 'day', 'want', 'make', 'full', 'workout', 'can', 'use', 'entire', 'program.For', 'abs', 'Kries', 'almost', 'entire', 'Intermediate', 'Pilates', 'mat', 'program', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'proper', 'form', 'important', 'here', 'want', 'feel', 'work', ""'re"", 'new', 'Pilates', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'section', 'few', 'times', 'join', 'in.For', 'arms', 'upperbody', 'Kries', 'most', 'Standing', 'Sculpting', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'yoga-inspired', 'moves', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'get', 'large', 'muscles', 'even', 'gain', 'significant', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'using', 'light', 'dumbbells', '3', '5', 'lbs', 'maximum', 'recommended', 'However', 'proper', 'technique', 'will', 'contribute', 'overall', 'integrated', 'strenght', 'properly', 'using', 'center', 'as', 'well', 'limbs', 'Again', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'done', 'viewing', 'few', 'times.At', 'first', 'glance', 'quite', 'bit', 'repetition', 'Thighs', 'Hips', 'section', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'However', 'closer', 'examination', 'are', 'enough', 'differences', 'justify', 'doing', 'sections', 'Hips', 'section', 'predominantly', 'ballet', 'movements', 'moves', 'here', 'concentrate', 'lateral', 'movement', 'thus', 'more', 'effectively', 'targeting', 'hips', 'bunch', 'plies', 'as', 'well', 'tendus', 'degages', 'ballet', 'kicks', 'are', 'performed', 'here', 'may', 'want', 'modify', 'have', 'sensitive', 'knees.The', 'Thighs', 'section', 'small', 'bit', 'ballet', 'Pilates', 'concentrating', 'yoga', 'section', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'sneaking', 'upper', 'body', 'strengthening', 'as', 'well', 'Awkward', 'Chairs/Fierce', 'Pose', 'Lunges', 'again', 'modify', 'knees', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'quite', 'bit', 'overlap', 'Kries', 'newer', 'offerings', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'fusion-style', 'small', 'pieces', 'take', 'plunge', 'longer', 'tapes']","The Method - Pilates Target Specifics: Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs VHS"

This is the second of her workouts I've bought, and I won't be buying more.  I found the mixture of instruction to actual work to be frustrating -- I'd be ready to flow on to the next exercise, and she'd be standing there telling me about it.  This is very useful the first few times through (proper alignment and breathing are essential, after all), but I'd like to just do the exercises straight through after I learn them.Kries's narration is sometimes uneven, and her explanations aren't always that clear.

They make Kathy Smith look absolutely hyper.I also found the 15-minute segments too short -- I prefer 20 to 60-minute workouts that work my whole body rather than 15 minutes on just one area.

I have never been one to work out in my home, but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have I saved so much money by doing this DVD instead of my beloved studio sessions, but I'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than I ever could with the sessions.As the reviews before me have indicated, the DVD is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area, but I think that's slightly misleading. While about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under, each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well, which make for a more overall workout, whether you're doing one section or four at a time. For instance, in the section entitled ""abs"" you'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs. Therefore, you're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout!******NOTE:  I recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates, but NOT for beginners!!!  In order to do these exercises correctly, you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement, breathing techniques, and proper alignment. If you are attempting these exercises as a beginner, they may seem straightforward, but without the proper foundation and knowledge (which is NOT explained), you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse, could get hurt.*******For those who are newer to pilates, I would recommend perhaps watching the video first, as it moves at what I would consider a fast intermediate pace.",5,This DVD is a MUST!!!!,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1801,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'studying', 'pilates', 'gyrotonics', 'six', 'years', 'top', 'instructors', 'NYC', 'increasing', 'popularity', 'pilates', 'sessions', 'have', 'gotten', 'absurdly', 'expensive', 'why', 'wanted', 'try', 'DVD', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'work', 'out', 'home', 'ths', 'truly', 'amazing', 'workout', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'saved', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'doing', 'DVD', 'instead', 'beloved', 'studio', 'sessions', ""'m"", 'able', 'incorporate', 'busy', 'schedule', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'ever', 'could', 'sessions.As', 'reviews', 'have', 'indicated', 'DVD', 'broken', 'up', 'four', 'segments', 'target', 'specific', 'area', 'think', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'percent', 'exercises', 'section', 'do', 'target', 'area', 'are', 'labeled', 'section', 'also', 'variety', 'stretches', 'counter-workouts', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'more', 'overall', 'workout', ""'re"", 'doing', 'one', 'section', 'four', 'time', 'instance', 'section', 'entitled', 'abs', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'exercises', 'strengthen', 'back', 'muscles', 'legs', 'Therefore', ""'re"", 'able', 'get', 'lot', 'variety', 'great', 'overall', 'workout', '******NOTE', 'recommend', 'highly', 'intermediates', 'advanced', 'students', 'pilates', 'NOT', 'beginners', 'order', 'do', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'must', 'know', 'basic', 'pilates', 'foundation', 'such', 'pelvic', 'placement', 'breathing', 'techniques', 'proper', 'alignment', 'are', 'attempting', 'exercises', 'beginner', 'may', 'seem', 'straightforward', 'proper', 'foundation', 'knowledge', 'NOT', 'explained', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'exercises', 'properly', 'worse', 'could', 'get', 'hurt', '*******For', 'who', 'are', 'newer', 'pilates', 'would', 'recommend', 'perhaps', 'watching', 'video', 'first', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'fast', 'intermediate', 'pace']","The Method - Pilates Target Specifics: Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs VHS"
505159,A3J32CP7XVRNS8,B00000IXOG,not telling,"[0, 0]","I was happy when I picked up this DVD to find that it is not as long as the Pilates All In One Work out (which was an hour and a half!) - this work out squeezes all the necessary exercises into one hour... anything that saves me time is a good thing!Starts off: 15 Minutes of Abdominal exercises (they really work.. they helped me lose my baby belly after I had my daughter)They are pretty difficult, though. I found that it took me a long time to be able to do these exercises without taking breaks. But you know it's working 'cause you can already feel the burn 30 seconds into the workout!Then 15 minutes of arms - this really helps you tone up your arms... but don't expect to really bulk up. This is just a basic beginners work out to keep the extra skin from flapping underneath your arms - you won't become a body builder from this! They are not very difficult at all.. even if you have no strength training experience at all, you should be able to do these... you may have to take short breaks here and there, but keep up with it and you'll get better.Then 15 minutes of hips, which is great because it's always been my &quot;problem area&quot; and there aren't that many exercises out there that specifically target the hip area. This work out helps my jeans and skirts fit so much better and makes me feel much better about the way I look! They're a little difficult at first, but if you keep with them you will get better and be able to do them!Then last is 15 minutes of thighs which are all standing and floor exercises target to your thigh area to help tone and strengthen to help you shed fat, flab, and inches. They are difficult... I've heard that your thigh area is the hardest area on the human body to tone and keep toned - I don't disagree. These exercises are very challenging, but start off at your own pace and you will gradually get better and better.I try to do this work out 3-5 times a week, depending on my schedule... It has really helped keep me in good shape. it's especially great to own if you're like me - I'm a stay at home mom and I don't have the luxury of being able to leave my house multiple times a week so that I can work out, and I don't have very much free time on my hands.So, I put this dvd in when the kids are napping and I get in a good work out and then shower... saves much more time (and money!)than heading out to a gym.If you're serious about finding a routine that you want to stick to, then I recommend this video.If you're looking to burn a lot of fat though (say over ten pounds) you're going to also have to get an aerobics dvd also, there are no aerobic exercises on here.

I find that this goes quickly and I also like that she does stretching at the end of each section before moving on. The four sections make it easy to pick and choose your workout, and I usually find myself doing two one day and two the next.

If you are looking for a great full-body workout, you can do all four workouts one after the other. If you are short on time or just want to work on one area of your body, you can choose from four workouts:Abs (15 minutes)Arms (15 minutes) - Need 1-3lb weightsHips (15 minutes)Thighs (15 minutes)You will recognize many of the signature ""Method"" postures and exercises in this workout, however there are quite a few surprises. Not only are all the exercises even more precise than before, they seem to be the ""next"" challenge. The pace is slightly faster at times and the ""d'gag'"" reaches a new level of intensity.Some of the Exercises:The HundredRoll-UpLeg CirclesRolling Like a BallDouble-Leg Lower LiftCrissCrossActive Moving CatActive Cat with Yoga PressDown DogExercises from the Side Series for LegsSwimmingSun SalutationStanding Sculpting SeriesChest ExpansionBoxingPli' Series (makes you feel like you are doing ballet)It is helpful to have Jennifer Kries' new book: Pilates Plus Method to learn the names of all her exercises and read the finer details of how your body should feel as you work through each exercise.""Try to feel as if you were pushing your foot through the sand on the beach, moving with great resistance."" (from her new book)There is hardly time to give extra advice, but Jennifer still manages to give you tips throughout this workout. If you have been doing her exercise videos over the years you will almost ""hear her advice in your mind"" as you go through the exercises.If you are just starting to exercise with Jennifer Kries try:The Method - Pilates: Precision Sculpting (1996)The Method - Pilates: Precision Toning (1996)The Method - All in One Workout (1997)The Method - Precision Yoga (1998)Pilates Method and 3-Dimensional Toning Box Set (2002)The Method Pilates ""Target Specifics"" seems to be the most advanced workout I've tried so far when I do all four sections in one hour. If you can make it through the list above, you are ready for this workout. Once you complete Target Specifics, you will reach a new level of confidence and fitness. For me, this was the next level in my Pilates practice. The drums keep you motivated and keep you at the pace you need to be to burn those calories! Definitely an intermediate to advanced workout.If you are just starting to do Pilates, it might be difficult to learn the moves and keep up with the fast pace. Start with some of the slower paced workouts from 1996 and learn the basics. I'd also recommend finding the Winsor Pilates workouts because they are excellent for anyone who is just discovering these amazing exercises.Results from The Method workouts include:Flat, firm stomach without having to do sit-ups or crunchesDefined buns without lungesSculpted Legs without bouncy aerobic exercisesTones arms without heavy weightsImproved posture and flexibility.
