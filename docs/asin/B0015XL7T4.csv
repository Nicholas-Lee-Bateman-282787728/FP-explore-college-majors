Now this is real tv that you can enjoy with the family.  This is one of those programs you could enjoy as a kid or as an adult without fear of hearing curse words or very adult rated themes.  This was a time when tv was innocent and enjoyable. Boy do I miss those days.  So if you are into good clean fun join Charles and the rest of the cast as Charles helps the little darling grow up.",5,Back to the 80s with Class,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,482,"['Welcome', 'Powells', 'Join', 'Jamie', 'Sarah', 'Adam', 'third', 'season', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'Now', 'real', 'tv', 'can', 'enjoy', 'family', 'one', 'programs', 'could', 'enjoy', 'kid', 'adult', 'fear', 'hearing', 'curse', 'words', 'very', 'adult', 'rated', 'themes', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'tv', 'was', 'innocent', 'enjoyable', 'Boy', 'do', 'miss', 'days', 'So', 'are', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'join', 'Charles', 'rest', 'cast', 'Charles', 'little', 'darling', 'grow', 'up']",Charles in Charge: Season 3

Some of the episodes can border on way-too-corny (to the point of nausea), but even this can be funny if you are in the right mood. They do sort of run the token side kick (the one who played the ship wrecked jungle kid in the movie, something Lagoon, with Brook Shields) a little into the ground.",4,80's flackback,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,434,"['like', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'means', 'favorite', 'sitcom', '80', 'most', 'part', 'engaging', 'funny', 'episodes', 'can', 'border', 'way-too-corny', 'point', 'nausea', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'are', 'right', 'mood', 'do', 'sort', 'run', 'token', 'side', 'kick', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'ship', 'wrecked', 'jungle', 'kid', 'movie', 'something', 'Lagoon', 'Brook', 'Shields', 'little', 'ground']",Charles in Charge: Season 3

It was always funny, I used to follow Jamies fashion style and Charles was very easy on the eyes.  When I watched this entire season the other week, I loved watching all the episodes that I remembered well, but these days it's not as funny as it used to seem.  I think sitcoms have gotten so much smarter, that this humour is tired now.  It's still cool to enjoy a show that I used to love, but it's not going to be something I'll watch over and over.  And while I love all the characters, this season seemed to make Buddy more stupid (and subsequently annoying) than ever.  Other than that, this is fun to watch purely for sentimental reasons and to watch Scott Baio again (while he still looked good).",4,Brings back memories :-),1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,747,"['always', 'loved', 'watching', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'was', 'always', 'funny', 'used', 'follow', 'Jamies', 'fashion', 'style', 'Charles', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'When', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'other', 'week', 'loved', 'watching', 'episodes', 'remembered', 'well', 'days', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'used', 'seem', 'think', 'sitcoms', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'much', 'smarter', 'humour', 'tired', 'now', 'still', 'cool', 'enjoy', 'show', 'used', 'love', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'love', 'characters', 'season', 'seemed', 'make', 'Buddy', 'more', 'stupid', 'subsequently', 'annoying', 'ever', 'Other', 'fun', 'watch', 'purely', 'sentimental', 'reasons', 'watch', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'again', 'still', 'looked', 'good']",Charles in Charge: Season 3
