1624385,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BC1UP3I,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","A man is sent to prison for raping and killing a woman that he had a reputation for stalking. 20 years later, that same man Eugene Wang (Nick Cheung) is released on parole and is a free man. Meanwhile, a renowned pianist named Han Tsui (Michael Wong) is preparing for his final string of concerts before retirement. Behind closed doors, Tsui is an abusive alcoholic that takes all of his frustrations out on his daughter Zoe (Janice Man). When the authorities pull Han Tsui's mangled corpse out of the river, Inspector Lam (Simon Yam) is put on the case. Lam has a reputation for reopening closed cases and is the only one who's connecting the case from 20 years ago to this one. Lam's detective work seems to only uncover more questions. What could the Tsui family be hiding and how is Eugene Wang connected to them?Personally speaking, it's always been incredibly easy to compare the acting careers of Simon Yam and Liam Neeson. They're both mostly known for their supporting roles where they usually made a strong impact, but became relevant for the tragic end the characters they portrayed always seemed to find. The vengeful storyline of ""Nightfall"" seems to purposely echo ""Oldboy"" with its never ending tale of revenge, one of the main characters being imprisoned, and the large gap in time; ""Nightfall"" also makes it a point to make sure you see Eugene pick up a hammer without ever actually doing anything with it.There are quite a few layers to dig through when it comes to the story and while it's easy to comprehend it also seems like the film goes out of its way to take every back road and scenic route just to get there. They highlight Lam's shortcomings early on; he passes out from drinking too much regularly because he's still mourning his wife that committed suicide. Lam also has a teenage daughter who's bringing home boys and griping at him for never having time away from work. Both issues seem to plague the Lam character rather fiercely, but are suddenly dropped halfway through the film. The screenplay isn't very memorable either. It gets the job done, but doesn't really seem to be trying to reel the viewer in. Michael Wong's performance makes you incredibly weary, as well. He jumps back and forth between Cantonese and English for seemingly no reason at all. Maybe it was done to enhance the drunken stupor his character was always in, but that seems to be a bit of a stretch.The performances of Simon Yam and Nick Cheung along with the stunning cinematography are what make ""Nightfall"" so intriguing. It seems like a lot more could have been done with the Inspector Lam character being so flawed, but Simon Yam does the best he can to bring the character to life. His best moment comes in the closing moments of the film where Lam finally seems to breakdown and have a revelation of sorts. Nick Cheung is an absolute beast. ""Nightfall"" begins with one of the most stunning and brutal shower sequences in cinematic history and Eugene Wang is at the center of it. The Eugene Wang character is terrifying as he's always lurking about and you never seem to know what he's actually capable of. You can never quite get a clear read on his strange behavior, but his facial expressions are so absorbing. He's watching Zoe play the piano in a key scene and he has this look of pure ecstasy on his face that is both touching and haunting at the same time. Cheung has a way of making any particular scene unsettling, uncomfortable, and absolutely memorable all at the same time. The cinematography is at its best when Eugene first gets out of prison and you follow him walking around the city. The shot of him eating ice cream and sitting by the river with the city breathing down his neck in the background is incredible. Another favorite is a really quick scene as the camera is looking down a spiral staircase and you see Eugene stick his head out and look up at the camera. The cinematography is just very rich in ""Nightfall"" over all with enriched colors and superb lighting.""Nightfall"" is a bit of a mess, but it's an enjoyable mess. Maybe it gets a pass because it seems to blatantly mimic ""Oldboy"" and that's such a personal favorite. Its beautiful cinematography, engrossing performance of Simon Yam, and mesmerizing performance of Nick Cheung attempt to make you forget about whatever pitfalls the screenplay and storyline may have. With all of its imperfections, ""Nightfall"" is still a rather enticing crime thriller.",3,A flawed thriller with impeccable acting,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,4450,"['man', 'sent', 'prison', 'raping', 'killing', 'woman', 'had', 'reputation', 'stalking', '20', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'man', 'Eugene', 'Wang', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'released', 'parole', 'free', 'man', 'Meanwhile', 'renowned', 'pianist', 'named', 'Han', 'Tsui', 'Michael', 'Wong', 'preparing', 'final', 'string', 'concerts', 'retirement', 'closed', 'doors', 'Tsui', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'frustrations', 'out', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Janice', 'Man', 'When', 'authorities', 'pull', 'Han', 'Tsui', 'mangled', 'corpse', 'river', 'Inspector', 'Lam', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'put', 'case', 'Lam', 'reputation', 'reopening', 'closed', 'cases', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'connecting', 'case', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'Lam', 'detective', 'work', 'only', 'uncover', 'more', 'questions', 'What', 'could', 'Tsui', 'family', 'be', 'hiding', 'how', 'Eugene', 'Wang', 'connected', 'Personally', 'speaking', 'always', 'been', 'incredibly', 'easy', 'compare', 'acting', 'careers', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'Liam', 'Neeson', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'known', 'supporting', 'roles', 'where', 'usually', 'made', 'strong', 'impact', 'became', 'relevant', 'tragic', 'end', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'always', 'seemed', 'find', 'vengeful', 'storyline', 'Nightfall', 'purposely', 'echo', 'Oldboy', 'never', 'ending', 'tale', 'revenge', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'large', 'gap', 'time', 'Nightfall', 'also', 'point', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'Eugene', 'pick', 'up', 'hammer', 'ever', 'actually', 'doing', 'anything', 'it.There', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'layers', 'dig', 'when', 'story', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'also', 'film', 'way', 'take', 'back', 'road', 'scenic', 'route', 'just', 'get', 'there', 'highlight', 'Lam', 'shortcomings', 'early', 'out', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'regularly', 'still', 'mourning', 'wife', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Lam', 'also', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'bringing', 'home', 'boys', 'griping', 'never', 'having', 'time', 'away', 'work', 'issues', 'seem', 'plague', 'Lam', 'character', 'rather', 'fiercely', 'are', 'suddenly', 'dropped', 'halfway', 'film', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'either', 'job', 'done', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'reel', 'viewer', 'Michael', 'Wong', 'performance', 'incredibly', 'weary', 'as', 'well', 'back', 'forth', 'Cantonese', 'English', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'was', 'done', 'enhance', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'character', 'was', 'always', 'be', 'bit', 'stretch.The', 'performances', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'Nightfall', 'so', 'intriguing', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Inspector', 'Lam', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'flawed', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'best', 'can', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'best', 'moment', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'Lam', 'finally', 'breakdown', 'have', 'revelation', 'sorts', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'absolute', 'beast', 'Nightfall', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'brutal', 'shower', 'sequences', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Eugene', 'Wang', 'center', 'Eugene', 'Wang', 'character', 'terrifying', 'always', 'lurking', 'never', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'capable', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'clear', 'read', 'strange', 'behavior', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'so', 'absorbing', 'watching', 'Zoe', 'play', 'piano', 'key', 'scene', 'look', 'pure', 'ecstasy', 'face', 'touching', 'haunting', 'same', 'time', 'Cheung', 'way', 'making', 'particular', 'scene', 'unsettling', 'uncomfortable', 'absolutely', 'memorable', 'same', 'time', 'cinematography', 'best', 'when', 'Eugene', 'first', 'prison', 'follow', 'walking', 'city', 'shot', 'eating', 'ice', 'cream', 'sitting', 'river', 'city', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'background', 'incredible', 'favorite', 'really', 'quick', 'scene', 'camera', 'looking', 'down', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'see', 'Eugene', 'stick', 'head', 'look', 'up', 'camera', 'cinematography', 'just', 'very', 'rich', 'Nightfall', 'enriched', 'colors', 'superb', 'lighting', 'Nightfall', 'bit', 'mess', 'enjoyable', 'mess', 'Maybe', 'pass', 'blatantly', 'mimic', 'Oldboy', 'personal', 'favorite', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'engrossing', 'performance', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'attempt', 'make', 'forget', 'pitfalls', 'screenplay', 'storyline', 'may', 'have', 'imperfections', 'Nightfall', 'still', 'rather', 'enticing', 'crime', 'thriller']",Nightfall
1624386,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00BC1UP3I,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Director/writer Chow Hin Yeung Roy may not have a long list of films in his oeuvre just yet.  With only two films under his belt and having worked as a researcher in ""Lust, Caution"" and an assistant producer for ""Fearless"".But all it takes is one film to capture the attention of an audience and film critics and in 2012, Roy's gritty revenge film ""Nightfall"" (daai deoi bou) did just that.Starring Simon Yam (""Ip Man"", ""PTU"", ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"", ""Election""), Nick Cheung (""Election"", ""Breaking News"", ""Exiled""), Michael Wong (""Thunderbolt"", ""City Hunter"", ""Beast Cops""), Kay Tse and Janice Man.The film would earn director Chow Hin Yeung Roy a ""Best New Director"" award at the Hong Kong Film Awards and also win a ""Best Sound Effects"" award at the ""Golden Horse Film Festival"", including ""Best Actor"" nominations for Nick Cheung.VIDEO:""Nightfall"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  One of the high points of the film is the use of a Red One camera which brings out amazing detail in the film.  From the orange tinged fight scenes at the beginning of the film, showcasing the violent actions and closeups of a character.  Outside of the opening gritty and violent fight scene, the film uses natural colors.  Natural skin tones and great closeup detail, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, the film looks great on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Unlike the Edko Asian Blu-ray release, Well Go USA Entertainment opted to use a Cantonese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 48 kHz soundtrack instead of the 7.1 lossless track.  I was a bit surprised because the highlight of the Edko Films Blu-ray release was its lossless 96 kHz 7.1 soundtrack.  But for the most part, action sequences and music are utilized through the surround channels and sound crystal clear, especially during the more action-intense sequences.  Also, included is a Dolby Digital 2.0 Cantonese soundtrack.Subtitles are in English and Chinese.SPECIAL FEATURES""Nightfall"" comes with the following special features:Making Of - (47:42) Featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the making of ""Nightfall"" and interviews with the director and cast.Theatrical Trailer - (:56) The theatrical trailer for ""Nightfall"".JUDGMENT CALL:For rookie filmmaker Chow Hin Yeung Roy, ""Nightfall"" is a pretty satisfying revenge film with twist and turns and a solid performance from both Simon Yam and Nick Cheung that is able to make the film stand out in the plethora of other Hong Kong films with a ""revenge"" theme.While Simon Yam has been featured as a supporting actor in films of late, it's great to see him in the main lead as a detective George Lam who is dedicated to his job, yet knows that dedication has cost him his family.  It's his discovery and how he evolves throughout the film is rather fascinating.But even more fascinating is how Nick Cheung was able to embody the character of Wong Yuen-yeung.  Watching this actor evolve from Benny Chan's 1992 film ""Hua! ying xiong"" to romantic comedies such as ""The Teacher Without Chalk"", since ""Runaway"" of 2001, he is able to tap into gritty action films such as ""Breaking News"", ""Election"" and the same can be said with his recent film ""Nightfall"".This is probably one of the best films he has acted in that he doesn't even have to mutter one single word.  It's all about facial expressions, body movement and physicality.  And with decades in cinema, Cheung doesn't look like has aged all that much as he is able to play these physical roles with efficacy.Let's first talk about what I liked about the film.  I liked how the film sets you up believing this film was a creepy stalker/murder film but then switches gears and then as each layer is stripped off from the main storyline, things change in a different direction and you can't help but be fascinated by the new developments of the film.  As mentioned, there are plenty of twists and turns along the way and you can't help but remain captivated and watch how the film ends.The acting performances by Simon Yam and Nick Cheung is a major highlight of the film and there are some beautiful scenes of cinematography.What I didn't like about the film?  Not sure if it's more unlike but more of it being too farfetched.  You have a mute convict who has not seen society in more than 20-years, coming out to reality but yet manages to garner high end spy equipment.  With what money was he able to purchase a powerful telescope, bugging device.In one accident scene, both George and Wong take a major fall.  In reality, one would find themselves in the hospital but of course in Hong Kong action cinema, falling from several feet and landing on a tree is enough as a cushion to keep one alive and well.And no different from previous work from Michael Wong, it's always hilarious for me to see him speak in English then to Cantonese, then to English.  This is not a distraction and for some it may be a negative but for me, you have seen Michael Wong do this in so many films, you come to expect it and want to see it.But despite some of the farfetched ideas implemented in the film, ""Nightfall"" is still a gritty, revenge action film that is able to stand on its own two feet and separate itself from other Hong Kong films with a similar theme.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good but for lossless audio, Well Go USA Entertainment opted for a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 48 kHz soundtrack instead of the very well-received Edko Films 7.1 Dolby TrueHD 96 kHz soundtrack.  But still, the film does sound amazing, especially during the more action-intense sequences.Overall, ""Nightfall"" is a riveting, revenge, action film for rookie director Chow Hin Yeung Roy.  Featuring a solid performance from both Simon Yam and Nick Cheung, the storyline from ""Nightfall"" is filled with gritty action but also many twist and turns that will keep interested from beginning to end.Recommended!",4,"""Nightfall"" is a riveting, revenge, action film for rookie director Chow Hin Yeung Roy.",1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,5907,"['Director/writer', 'Chow', 'Hin', 'Yeung', 'Roy',

1624387,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00BC1UP3I,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 2]","Everyone appreciates a good cop story, and the Chinese are no different.  Those dedicated investigators who stick it out through thick and thin to get to the bottom of things are a cause for celebration wherever they serve.  There's one thing a cop anywhere will tell you: somehow - in some way - it all comes back to family.  This doesn't necessarily mean mom or dad or little sis are guilty, mind you; what it means is that there are few motivators in life as strong as the bonds that tie us together.  Despite the best of intentions, families can drive us to drink; they can drive us to drive; and, in the worst circumstances, they can drive us to commit the very darkest of sins.Such is the stuff of NIGHTFALL, a quiet and meditative thriller directed by Chow Hin Yeung Roy.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're entirely accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Detective Lam (the omnipresent Simon Yam) heads up a detective squad that specializes in cold cases.  He identifies Wong Yeun-Yeung (Nick Cheung) as being tied to what appears to be a revenge killing.  It looks like once he was released from prison, Wong went after the man a put him there - a renowned pianist whose daughter it was proved Wong raped and murdered.  However, things don't rest easy with Lam, and, as he keeps pulling back the layers, he uncovers a family's long-hidden secret ... something so stark that it's still causing pain today.Try as it might, NIGHTFALL can't escape comparisons to practically every other solid cop flick that's been produced in whatever culture.  You have your committed, grizzled senior detective (Lam); you have his team of young, willing, still-learning sidekicks; and Lam's got a plethora of family issues.  His wife committed suicide years ago, an act he still can't quite reconcile.  His daughter hates him.  His hide is being chewed out by his captain.  And now he's got the murder of a Hong Kong celebrity requiring his attention.  Can't a guy catch a break?What differentiates NIGHTFALL just a bit is the fact that the pieces of the puzzle are almost always successfully in motion.  Wong is introduced in an opening fight sequence that raises serious questions about whether he's a good guy or a bad guy in the flick, and the director cleverly straddles this line consistently while never allowing the audience to take their eyes off of the quickly developing new murder the ex-con finds himself a part of.  Needless to say, it's this story that's pivotal for the climax, and, despite a healthy sprinkling of clues along the way, there's just enough ambiguity to keep viewers guessing.However, NIGHTFALL is not without some pacing problems.  There are several long sequences shot by Chow Hin Yeung Roy that, honestly, could've been trimmed to give the picture a better running length.  At 108 minutes, it feels a bit bloated for where it all comes from, not including where it's all heading.  It's well photographed and smartly lit, but, then again, there's a word for things that are so: they're called commercials.  With greater narrative trickery, the impact could've been strengthened while the excess was trimmed (by easily 20 minutes); the end result would've been an even stronger story.Still, you get what you get: a strong tale centered on retribution where family truly matters even at the cost of one's sanity.NIGHTFALL is produced by EDKO Film, Film Development Fund of Hong Kong, Irresistible Films, and Sil-Metropole Organisation.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Well Go USA.  As for the technical specifications, the presentation looks and sounds mostly solid, though I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that I found the audio mix to be a bit off; in early parts of the film I had to crank the center channel way up in order to hear the dialogue, but this problem seems to taper off in the latter half.  The disc has two special features: a nice `making-of' short (about 40 minutes) that actually combines talent interviews with some behind-the-scenes footage, and the theatrical trailer.RECOMMENDED.  The pacing is a bit off, and I could've used more relationship-building between Detective Lam and his large team of investigators, but, otherwise, NIGHTFALL is a pretty impressive police procedural with some taut moments of family melodrama perfectly built in.  This isn't to say that I didn't see most of the ending coming, but the tight script by Chow Hin Yeung Roy and Chi-long To still managed to squeak out a surprise or two here and there.  And Simon Yam never gets enough love so far as this online reviewer is concerned; here, he's given the chance to fully take the reins, and he turns in a convincing performance as the cop who'll stop at nothing to uncover the truth hidden beneath the coldest cases.  It would've been nice for his own character's story to get some resolution ... but, if it had, then he might not have been the detective he's become.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA provided me with an advance DVD copy of NIGHTFALL for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,NIGHTFALL Keeps It `All In the

""Nightfall"" is the first thriller from the Island I've seen in some while and it's quite the watch.Here's the scoop. A man (Wang) is let out of prison, after 20 years, for a murder he didn't commit. Upon release he spies on the family of the daughter who he was accused of murdering. He becomes obsessed with their new, young daughter. Dad is killed and the police are now after him again.There's a lot to like here. You see what's happening and you have some of it figured out, but it doesn't all add up so you stick with it to fill in the blanks. You also have some good characters. The ex-prisoner, Wang, is mute so there is a degree of sympathy for him, but why is he acting so creepy? Is he planning another murder? Of who? The father? The daughter? Then there's detective Lam (Simon Yam) who is a good detective but always has a booze bottle nearby and needs a much better relationship with his daughter. All these things begin to add up but, after all was said and done, I had some pretty serious questions.This is some good film making. The shots of Hong Kong are great. It looks like a modern, bustling metropolis. The nighttime overheads make you want to plan your next vacation. The acting, writing and all that are very professional. I also liked the way the story unfolded. The key plot elements are kept as late into the film as possible so the revelations are surprises. But doesn't, given what happens to dad fairly early on, it make the whole thing unnecessary? I guess I might need to see it again to determine this.This is a good watch. Not the best movie you'll ever see but much better than most.",4,Hong Kong is Alive and Kickin',1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,1730,"['used', 'watch', 'lot', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'usurped', 'South', 'Koreans', 'Nightfall', 'first', 'thriller', 'Island', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'quite', 'watch.Here', 'scoop', 'man', 'Wang', 'let', 'prison', '20', 'years', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'release', 'family', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'accused', 'murdering', 'obsessed', 'new', 'young', 'daughter', 'Dad', 'killed', 'police', 'are', 'now', 'lot', 'here', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'have', 'figured', 'out', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'so', 'stick', 'fill', 'blanks', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'characters', 'ex-prisoner', 'Wang', 'mute', 'so', 'degree', 'sympathy', 'why', 'acting', 'so', 'creepy', 'planning', 'murder', 'who', 'father', 'daughter', 'Then', 'detective', 'Lam', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'who', 'good', 'detective', 'always', 'booze', 'bottle', 'nearby', 'much', 'better', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'things', 'begin', 'add', 'up', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'had', 'pretty', 'serious', 'questions.This', 'good', 'film', 'making', 'shots', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'are', 'great', 'modern', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'nighttime', 'overheads', 'make', 'want', 'plan', 'next', 'vacation', 'acting', 'writing', 'are', 'very', 'professional', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'story', 'unfolded', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'kept', 'late', 'film', 'possible', 'revelations', 'are', 'surprises', ""n't"", 'given', 'what', 'dad', 'fairly', 'early', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'unnecessary', 'guess', 'might', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'determine', 'this.This', 'good', 'watch', 'Not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'most']",Nightfall

The women in this film were just adequate in their performance. The cinematography had a few great moments and images and tried hard to keep the action ""moving.""There was a complex story which could have been unraveled better than it was; I thought this work deserved better direction and editing. It needed to go a shred faster, and a bad habit developed of dropping Afterthoughts (explanations) sloppily, where I thought they would have been  better served as action in proper sequence. I did think the plot had a couple of stunner points but they did not serve to shock or shake me. I felt that I should have teared up at the end but there was nothing to make me. The dialogue was very good.All in all, this is a good movie. Not ""riveting,"" but the two male leads are quite electric to watch, especially the controlled power of Simon Yam. Nick Cheung has a more difficult role because he is tasked with a more complex character than Lam.See it.",4,"A good Chinese Thriller, worth seeing",1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,1027,"['was', 'competent', 'production', 'great', 'acting', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'women', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'adequate', 'performance', 'cinematography', 'had', 'few', 'great', 'moments', 'images', 'tried', 'hard', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'was', 'complex', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'unraveled', 'better', 'was', 'thought', 'work', 'deserved', 'better', 'direction', 'editing', 'needed', 'go', 'shred', 'faster', 'bad', 'habit', 'developed', 'dropping', 'Afterthoughts', 'explanations', 'sloppily', 'where', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'action', 'proper', 'sequence', 'did', 'think', 'plot', 'had', 'couple', 'stunner', 'points', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'shock', 'shake', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'teared', 'up', 'end', 'was', 'nothing', 'make', 'dialogue', 'was', 'very', 'good.All', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'riveting', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'quite', 'electric', 'watch', 'especially', 'controlled', 'power', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'more', 'difficult', 'role', 'tasked', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'Lam.See']",Nightfall
1624390,ARUHLQVP23GQ1,B00BC1UP3I,hongkongfilmfan,"[0, 0]","One of the best detective films in recent years due to an excellent unpredictable script that you will surprise you and perfect acting. The first few minutes has a brief brutal, realistic action like Hong Kong filmed before the censorship of the handover. At the Asain FIlm Festival in Dallas they announced a few minutes had been cut due to violence in their release in Asia so this Well GO USA release is actually a director's cut. The first scene is graphic but crucial to the set up of the main character. This film quickly builds suspense in the opening scene before the credits, is unpredictable and never lets up the tension until the twist ending which you will suprise you. Dallas screened over 30 Asian movies at the festival last year and this was my favorite. Nick Cheung appears to have transformed himself physcially for this role as a tough, extremely intelligent, mute crminal recently released from prison stalking a young female. Simon Yam does an excellant job as the veteran detective obsessed with solving cold cases who suspects Nick is involved in a murder that occurs soon after Nick's release. Watched this with my elderly father who loves mysteries but always solves the cases first them out. NIGHTFALL he did NOT solve so he really enjoyed it. Very highly recommended for all fans of Hong kong crime cinema, mysteries and suspense. You will not want this NIGHTFALL to end because it is so good.",5,Nightfall you wish would not end,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1421,"['One', 'best', 'detective', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'due', 'excellent', 'unpredictable', 'script', 'will', 'surprise', 'perfect', 'acting', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'brief', 'brutal', 'realistic', 'action', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'filmed', 'censorship', 'handover', 'Asain', 'FIlm', 'Festival', 'Dallas', 'announced', 'few', 'minutes', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'due', 'violence', 'release', 'Asia', 'Well', 'GO', 'USA', 'release', 'actually', 'director', 'cut', 'first', 'scene', 'graphic', 'crucial', 'set', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'quickly', 'suspense', 'opening', 'scene', 'credits', 'unpredictable', 'never', 'up', 'tension', 'twist', 'ending', 'will', 'suprise', 'Dallas', 'screened', '30', 'Asian', 'movies', 'festival', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'favorite', 'Nick', 'Cheung', 'have', 'transformed', 'physcially', 'role', 'tough', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'mute', 'crminal', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'stalking', 'young', 'female', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'excellant', 'job', 'veteran', 'detective', 'obsessed', 'solving', 'cold', 'cases', 'who', 'suspects', 'Nick', 'involved', 'murder', 'soon', 'Nick', 'release', 'Watched', 'elderly', 'father', 'who', 'mysteries', 'always', 'cases', 'first', 'out', 'did', 'NOT', 'solve', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Hong', 'kong', 'crime', 'cinema', 'mysteries', 'suspense', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'NIGHTFALL', 'end', 'so', 'good']",Nightfall
