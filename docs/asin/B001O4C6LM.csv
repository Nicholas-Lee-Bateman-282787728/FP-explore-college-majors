1221762,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B001O4C6LM,Anthony McGill,"[0, 0]","Pete Seeger made only one concert tour of Australia and when he performed at the Melbourne Town Hall in 1963, I was not only  too young to attend  but didn't know much about Mr. Seeger or his music.  A handful of years later I discovered a wonderful  record shop located in a city basement named Discurio  which specialized in folk music.  Here, with the help of the proprietors I discovered Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, the New Lost City Ramblers, Joe Glazer and of course, Pete Seeger.  Of all the folkies, Pete will always be my favorite: great composer, wonderful singer and beautiful person with principles, grace and dignity that few people can ever hope to match.This Melbourne concert had the good fortune of being filmed  by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and has been restored in excellent condition. The filming technique was no great shakes; remember Aussie film making and television was still pretty primitive at this time. The concert is fairly basic but who needs special effects, etc. when you have Pete on the stage; you just dread the moment when the concert ends and you have to say goodbye to the wonderful Pete.  Nothing too controversial in his choice of songs but he does squeeze in a nice  Woody Guthrie medley of union songs.  Remember the main reason for this ten month  world tour was as a result of his shameful blacklisting in his home country.  I suppose we should be grateful that  bad events can sometimes lead to good things; in this case, this wonderful tour and the subsequent boost to Australian folk music and our love of Pete.  Extras on this disc include Pete's television appearance on the Aussie Bandstand show and a homage to Leadbelly.We recently lost Pete, a tireless troubadour promoting all that is good in the world. This rare concert footage even if a little creaky is a treasure to have preserved and will be appreciated by all admirers of this music legend and his contribution to traditional and political folk music.",5,A RARE PIECE OF THE WONDERFUL PETE,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1974,"['Pete', 'Seeger', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'concert', 'tour', 'Australia', 'when', 'performed', 'Melbourne', 'Town', 'Hall', '1963', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'young', 'attend', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Seeger', 'music', 'handful', 'years', 'later', 'discovered', 'wonderful', 'record', 'shop', 'located', 'city', 'basement', 'named', 'Discurio', 'specialized', 'folk', 'music', 'Here', 'help', 'proprietors', 'discovered', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Leadbelly', 'New', 'Lost', 'City', 'Ramblers', 'Joe', 'Glazer', 'course', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'folkies', 'Pete', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'great', 'composer', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'beautiful', 'person', 'principles', 'grace', 'dignity', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'match.This', 'Melbourne', 'concert', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'being', 'filmed', 'Australian', 'Broadcasting', 'Commission', 'been', 'restored', 'excellent', 'condition', 'filming', 'technique', 'was', 'great', 'shakes', 'remember', 'Aussie', 'film', 'making', 'television', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'primitive', 'time', 'concert', 'fairly', 'basic', 'who', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'when', 'have', 'Pete', 'stage', 'just', 'dread', 'moment', 'when', 'concert', 'have', 'say', 'goodbye', 'wonderful', 'Pete', 'Nothing', 'too', 'controversial', 'choice', 'songs', 'squeeze', 'nice', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'medley', 'union', 'songs', 'Remember', 'main', 'reason', 'ten', 'month', 'world', 'tour', 'was', 'result', 'shameful', 'blacklisting', 'home', 'country', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'bad', 'events', 'can', 'sometimes', 'lead', 'good', 'things', 'case', 'wonderful', 'tour', 'subsequent', 'boost', 'Australian', 'folk', 'music', 'love', 'Pete', 'Extras', 'disc', 'include', 'Pete', 'television', 'appearance', 'Aussie', 'Bandstand', 'show', 'homage', 'Leadbelly.We', 'recently', 'lost', 'Pete', 'tireless', 'troubadour', 'promoting', 'good', 'world', 'rare', 'concert', 'footage', 'even', 'little', 'creaky', 'treasure', 'have', 'preserved', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'admirers', 'music', 'legend', 'contribution', 'traditional', 'political', 'folk', 'music']",PETE SEEGER: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA 1963
1221763,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B001O4C6LM,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[13, 13]","OK, black & white, but that actually seems to add to the nostalgic aspect of this great look at folk music as presented by Pete Seeger in 1963. He went on a 22 country, 10-month world tour blessing the world with folk music and, himself, picking up some new folk music from other countries along the way. Seeger received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1993), and this DVD shows why. It's still hard to believe the folk singer was blacklisted in the USA.Fortunately, Australia loved his music and overlooked his politics, giving him a warm welcome and preserved it on film. Then, after a long shelf rest, it was discovered, Acorn became involved in the restoration, and the rest of the story is in the 16 page booklet that comes with the DVD. Packed full of photos, history, and the DVD contents lists.The product description lists many of the songs included in this DVD live performance, but special note should be given to a pair of special banjo renderings of the songs ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"" and ""Allegretto from Beethoven's 7th Symphony."" Wow.  And Seeger even teaches the Aussie concert attenders to yodel to ""Way Out There"" a song done with banjo that was taken from ""Sons of the Pioneers.""Another favorite of mine was ""I Never Will Marry"" plus one actually written by Bob Dylan but performed by Seeger, ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."" Then you'll just have to sing along with ""Michael, row The Boat Ashore"" and ""If I Had A Hammer"" (Pete's song) and others.The concert has a total of 29 musical numbers, ending with ""I Know an Old lady Who Swallowed A Fly"", fun for any age.  There is at least 15 musical presentations as well as some interviews on the Extra Bonus Stuff. There is filmed performances of Lead Belly from 1945, the man who taught Pete Seeger to play the 12 string guitar. Seeger sings some of his songs as well.This DVD is 160 total minutes of looking back at folk music of the Hootenanny (the word was coined by Seeger) years as well as an educational but enjoyable romp through the history of American Folk Music and some of its origin.  Perhaps this DVD would be usable by music teachers. The extras include a method to single out just one song for replay. How easy is that?Thanks Australian Broadcasting Corporation for helping give Pete Seeger folk music back the United States.",5,NOSTALGIC HOOTENANNY STYLE MUSICAL BLAST FROM THE PAST,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,2315,"['OK', 'black', 'white', 'actually', 'add', 'nostalgic', 'aspect', 'great', 'look', 'folk', 'music', 'presented', 'Pete', 'Seeger', '1963', 'went', '22', 'country', '10-month', 'world', 'tour', 'blessing', 'world', 'folk', 'music', 'picking', 'up', 'new', 'folk', 'music', 'other', 'countries', 'way', 'Seeger', 'received', 'Grammy', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'Award', '1993', 'DVD', 'why', 'still', 'hard', 'believe', 'folk', 'singer', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'USA.Fortunately', 'Australia', 'loved', 'music', 'overlooked', 'politics', 'giving', 'warm', 'welcome', 'preserved', 'film', 'Then', 'long', 'shelf', 'rest', 'was', 'discovered', 'Acorn', 'became', 'involved', 'restoration', 'rest', 'story', '16', 'page', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'Packed', 'full', 'photos', 'history', 'DVD', 'contents', 'lists.The', 'product', 'description', 'many', 'songs', 'included', 'DVD', 'live', 'performance', 'special', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'pair', 'special', 'banjo', 'renderings', 'songs', 'Jesu', 'Joy', 'Man', 'Desiring', 'Allegretto', 'Beethoven', '7th', 'Symphony', 'Wow', 'Seeger', 'even', 'Aussie', 'concert', 'attenders', 'yodel', 'Way', 'song', 'done', 'banjo', 'was', 'taken', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'favorite', 'mine', 'was', 'Never', 'Will', 'Marry', 'one', 'actually', 'written', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'performed', 'Seeger', 'Hard', 'Rain', 'A-', 'Gon', 'Fall', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'sing', 'along', 'Michael', 'row', 'Boat', 'Ashore', 'Had', 'Hammer', 'Pete', 'song', 'concert', 'total', '29', 'musical', 'numbers', 'ending', 'Know', 'Old', 'lady', 'Who', 'Swallowed', 'Fly', 'fun', 'age', 'least', '15', 'musical', 'presentations', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Extra', 'Bonus', 'Stuff', 'filmed', 'performances', 'Lead', 'Belly', '1945', 'man', 'who', 'taught', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'play', '12', 'string', 'guitar', 'Seeger', 'songs', 'well.This', 'DVD', '160', 'total', 'minutes', 'looking', 'back', 'folk', 'music', 'Hootenanny', 'word', 'was', 'coined', 'Seeger', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'educational', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'history', 'American', 'Folk', 'Music', 'origin', 'Perhaps', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'usable', 'music', 'teachers', 'extras', 'include', 'method', 'single', 'out', 'just', 'one', 'song', 'replay', 'How', 'easy', 'Thanks', 'Australian', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'helping', 'give', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'folk', 'music', 'back', 'United', 'States']",PETE SEEGER: LIVE IN AUSTRALIA 1963
1221764,A3MOWPCCKDITSH,B001O4C6LM,kevin garrett,"[0, 0]","I first gained an interest in Pete Seeger when I found him on YouTube, singing &#34;Away Out There,&#34;  but then You Tube deleted it from their files, so I had to buy this DVD to hear it.  This DVD has the best version of this song that I have ever heard rendered.  When I was growing up, I would often have to buy an entire album just to get one song that I liked, because back in the days of vinyl records, that was often times the only way you own the songs you liked.  This DVD album has lots of other good songs besides &#34;Away Out There,&#34; but it's still my favorite. If you like this, you should go to YouTube and listen to Arlo  Guthrie sing &#34;The Garden Song.&#34;  It's the black and white version shown a TV special and he's trying to get the audience to sing.  He tells the story of how he got stopped coming back from Canada.

(Anyone who would get angry over Dylan going electric is inherently suspect in my book.) Even when Springsteen did that marvelous tribute album, Seeger couldn't help grousing that it should have been more political. But a PBS documentary made me like him more and appreciate all he accomplished in the face of tremendous adversity. Blacklisted in the US, he went overseas in 1963 and found a rapturous audience in Australia. This is a rough TV print but perfectly serviceable and it captures Seeger perfectly: he was never happier than when he was in front of an audience, passing along the tradition of folk music and teaching people a new song.
