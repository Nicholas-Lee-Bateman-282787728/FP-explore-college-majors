I truly believe its to this day one of the funniest shows ever to air. Each of the four characters were hilarious in their own right...Dorothy the bookwarm, dry-humored substitute teacher, Rose the dimwitted airhead, Blanche the southern belle floozy, and Sophia the ornery little grandma.

The episodes have been reviewed and listed ten times over, so there's no need to do that again in this review. I agree, this is great, it's what fans have been waiting for. My only question is why is it so skimpy on the bonus features? The fashion commentary by Joan and Melissa Rivers is good, funny, but ... why just that? I'd have liked to see some interviews with three actresses who are still around and able to speak, but we get none of that. I feel this makes the release a bit weak. We don't even have commentary from the creators!Still, it's a pretty good release of this great, and perhaps classic, series. I actually like the effort that went into designing the box; you have their faces on the front, pictures of them all within the actual package. The discs are packed nicely into a fold-out insert that's fully designed and decorated with pictures from the first season. The menus are easy to get around; an easy ""play all"" feature that'll take you through all the episodes on the discs enables you to just pop it in, sit back, and watch without havin to get up and change in between each episode.The writing is great. Always funny while tackling serious situations. ""Adult Education"" deals with Blanche facing sexual harrassment, ""Blind Ambitions"" deals with Rose's blind sister wanting her to move in with her and leave the girls, ""the Operation"" deals with Dorthy facing her fear and the girls helping her by revealing some of their own fears. There are also a lot of humorous episodes, such as ""The Competition"" that shows the more competitive side of Rose, ""In a Bed of Rose's"" where a man dies in Rose's bed after she brings him home, and ""The Way We Met"" which is the last episode of the season that shows how this entire living situation came around.It's one of those T.V. shows that everyone should be aware of. Old women talking about life, sex and many other subjects ... that's entertainment. I think once you watch, you'll be hooked.

Following the lives of four older women living together as roommates in Miami, the show displayed a raw wit and a sharp humor. The women live in the house of Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), a Southern belle who loves men of every kind and has dated every eligible bachelor in the Miami area. Her roommates are former high school teacher Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur) and St. Olaff housewife and widower Rose Nylund (Betty White). Rose loves to tell stories about her former hometown, much to the chagrin of the other girls.When the series begins, the three girls are joined by Dorothy's mother, the firebrand Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), a spunky Italian immigrant who always speaks her mind. In her early 80's, Sophia may walk at a measured pace, but the velocity of her sarcasm only increases with age.In this Season 1 DVD of The Golden Girls, the girls must face a number of obstacles and various travails of life. Dorothy must learn to deal with her ex-husband Stanley, a loser who left her after nearly 40 years of marriage for a young bimbo who later dumped him. Blanche and Rose must deal with the various men in their lives - especially those who want to marry them. And Sophia just simply does her own thing, which is quite a lot for a young woman in her 80's.Overall, this is a charming situation comedy with likeable characters who have certainly developed their own unique identities. Although some of the same aspects of the show tend to be used over and over again (such as the St. Olaff stories and Dorothy's reaction to them), The Golden Girls never seems to grow tiresome. With powerful performances from each of the cast members, viewers will find that Sophia steals the show...Below is a list of episodes from The Golden Girls (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (The Engagement)Episode 2 (Guess Who's Coming To The Wedding?)Episode 3 (Rose The Prude)Episode 4 (Transplant)Episode 5 (The Triangle)Episode 6 (On Golden Girls)Episode 7 (The Competition)Episode 8 (Break-In)Episode 9 (Blanche And The Younger Man)Episode 10 (Heart Attack)Episode 11 (The Return Of Dorothy's Ex)Episode 12 (The Custody Battle)Episode 13 (A Little Romance)Episode 14 (That Was No Lady)Episode 15 (In A Bed Of Rose's)Episode 16 (The Truth Will Out)Episode 17 (Nice And Easy)Episode 18 (The Operation)Episode 19 (Second Motherhood)Episode 20 (Adult Education)Episode 21 (Flu Attack)Episode 22 (Job Hunting)Episode 23 (Blind Ambitions)Episode 24 (Big Daddy)Episode 25 (The Way We Met)The DVD Report",5,"Somewhat predictable, but hilarious nonetheless...",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2624,"['Making', 'debut', 'fall', '1985', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'quickly', 'established', 'fixture', 'Saturday', 'night', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'Following', 'lives', 'four', 'older', 'women', 'living', 'together', 'roommates', 'Miami', 'show', 'displayed', 'raw', 'wit', 'sharp', 'humor', 'women', 'live', 'house', 'Blanche', 'Devereaux', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Southern', 'belle', 'who', 'men', 'kind', 'dated', 'eligible', 'bachelor', 'Miami', 'area', 'roommates', 'are', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'Dorothy', 'Zbornak', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'St.', 'Olaff', 'housewife', 'widower', 'Rose', 'Nylund', 'Betty', 'White', 'Rose', 'loves', 'tell', 'stories', 'former', 'hometown', 'much', 'chagrin', 'other', 'girls.When', 'series', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'joined', 'Dorothy', 'mother', 'firebrand', 'Sophia', 'Petrillo', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'spunky', 'Italian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'always', 'mind', 'early', '80', 'Sophia', 'may', 'walk', 'measured', 'pace', 'velocity', 'sarcasm', 'only', 'age.In', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'girls', 'must', 'face', 'number', 'obstacles', 'various', 'travails', 'life', 'Dorothy', 'must', 'learn', 'deal', 'ex-husband', 'Stanley', 'loser', 'who', 'left', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'marriage', 'young', 'bimbo', 'who', 'later', 'dumped', 'Blanche', 'Rose', 'must', 'deal', 'various', 'men', 'lives', 'especially', 'who', 'want', 'marry', 'Sophia', 'just', 'simply', 'own', 'thing', 'quite', 'lot', 'young', 'woman', ""80's.Overall"", 'charming', 'situation', 'comedy', 'likeable', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'certainly', 'developed', 'own', 'unique', 'identities', 'same', 'aspects', 'show', 'tend', 'be', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'such', 'St.', 'Olaff', 'stories', 'Dorothy', 'reaction', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'never', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'powerful', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'Sophia', 'show', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Engagement', 'Episode', '2', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Wedding', 'Episode', '3', 'Rose', 'Prude', 'Episode', '4', 'Transplant', 'Episode', '5', 'Triangle', 'Episode', '6', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Episode', '7', 'Competition', 'Episode', '8', 'Break-In', 'Episode', '9', 'Blanche', 'Younger', 'Man', 'Episode', '10', 'Heart', 'Attack', 'Episode', '11', 'Return', 'Dorothy', 'Ex', 'Episode', '12', 'Custody', 'Battle', 'Episode', '13', 'Little', 'Romance', 'Episode', '14', 'Was', 'No', 'Lady', 'Episode', '15', 'Bed', 'Rose', 'Episode', '16', 'Truth', 'Will', 'Out', 'Episode', '17', 'Nice', 'Easy', 'Episode', '18', 'Operation', 'Episode', '19', 'Second', 'Motherhood', 'Episode', '20', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Episode', '21', 'Flu', 'Attack', 'Episode', '22', 'Job', 'Hunting', 'Episode', '23', 'Blind', 'Ambitions', 'Episode', '24', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Episode', '25', 'Way', 'Met', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

847754,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0002W4SX6,Byron Kolln,"[5, 7]","At long-last, fans of THE GOLDEN GIRLS can take home the hilarious first season of their favourite sitcom.  The groundbreaking series earned over 50 Emmy Award nominations during it's run, including awards for each of the main players.Picture it:  Miami, 1985.  Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur), Blanche Deveraux (Rue McClanahan), Rose Nylund (Betty White) and Dorothy's mother Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty) share a house in the sunny city.Each of the characters is beautifully-defined:  Dorothy is the strong, self-assured and self-appointed `leader' of the group, a substitute teacher whose ex-husband Stan often shows up to stir the mix.  Blanche is the Southern Belle whose main interest in life is men..and more men.  Rose is the simple farmer's daughter who hails from St. Olaf (the town that common sense forgot).  Sophia is the sharp-tongued barb whose antics more often than not steal the show.The laughs never diminish with this series, and the jokes still hold up after numerous repeated viewings.  This is largely thanks to the expert writing of Susan Harris (who also created SOAP, another fine series worth collecting on disc), and of course the impressive ladies who portray these characters so well.The first season includes many episodes which are some of the best in the series, including ""In a Bed of Rose's"" where grieving widow Rose finally commits to a new relationship, only to have her boyfriend suddenly expire; ""The Break-In"" where the girls have a frightening encounter with burglars; and ""The Way We Met"" where the girls reminisce about the start of their friendship (and how it almost never happened).So break out the cheesecake, and settle back.

847769,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B0002W4SX6,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[3, 3]","The recent deaths of Estelle Getty and Beatrice Arthur makes watching ""The Golden Girls"" a more poignant, but certainly not a less funny, experience. The series began in 1985 and immediately defined the phrase ""Must See TV."" With my college friends and I, it was always, ""What did you do on Saturday night?"" The answer always was, ""I stayed home and watched ""The Golden Girls"", of course.""The basic series premise is familiar to all fans by now. Three women over the age of 50 (although Blanche would never admit to it) are all room-mates in Blanche's Florida house. Blanche (Rue McClanahan) is man-crazy and seemingly over-sexed, Rose (Betty White) is sweetly naive about life. Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur) is the sensible one. Arthur's perfect comic timing and dead-pan delivery ground the series in reality. The trio is soon joined by Dorothy's  wise-cracking mother Sophia (Estelle Getty), who moves in after her retirement home burns down. The foursome remain best friends through thick and thin, despite many comic misadventures:1. The Engagement (Pilot): Blanche plans to marry boyfriend Harry, who is not what he seems to be.  Note, in this episode, the Girls have a gay cook named Coco, who was immediately written out when it was decided Sophia would be the one to give uncensored remarks.2. Guess Who's Coming To The Wedding: Dorothy is delighted her daughter is getting married, until she learns her ex-husband Stan (Herbert Edelman) will also be at the wedding.3. Rose, The Prude: Rose ponders being intimate with a man for the first time since her beloved husband Charlie died. Guest star Harold Gould would portray Rose's boyfriend Miles Webber later in the series.4. Transplant: Blanche's sister Virginia (Sheri North) arrives in need of a kidney transplant.5. The Triangle: A man causes a misunderstanding between Dorothy and Blanche.6. On Golden Girls:Blanche's  undisciplined  grandson (Billy Jacoby) visits and gets a lesson in manners from the Girls. Billy Jacoby's brother, Scott Jacoby, would portray Dorothy's son Michael later in the series.7. The Competition: A bowling tournament brings out the worst in the Girls.8. The Break-In: After the Girls are robbed, a terrified Rose buys a gun. Sophia remarks, ""one night I'll belch and stable Mable here will blow my head off.""9. Blanche & The Younger Man: Blanche dates a much younger fitness instructor. Rose's mother visits, and soon resents Rose being so over-protective and ""mothering"" her.10. The Heart Attack: Sophia suffers a heart attack during a storm.11. Stan's Return: Stan returns again, much to the annoyance of Dorothy and Sophia.12. The Custody Battle: Dorothy's sister Gloria wants Sophia to live with her.13. A Little Romance: In this hilarious episode, Rose dates Dr. Jonathon Newman, a very short man, and has a  wacky dream.14. That Was No Lady: Dorothy dates a married man and feels guilty.15. In A Bed Of Rose's: Rose is shocked when her date dies in her bed.16. The Truth Will Out: Rose is nervous about a visit from her daughter and grand-daughter.17. Nice And Easy: Blanche's niece is a bit too much like her.18. The Operation: Dorothy is scared to have an operation on her foot.19. Second Motherhood: Blanche dates a wealthy businessman.20. Adult Education: Blanche is propositioned by her nightschool teacher.21. Flu Attack: Just before the Friends Of Good Health Awards Banquet, the Girls, except Sophia, are struck bythe flu.22. Job Hunting: When the Grief Center closes, Rose has trouble finding another job.23. Blind Ambition: Polly Holliday guest stars as Rose's sister Lily, who recently became blind. The Girls attempt to have a yard sale, but can not bear to part with any of their belongings.24. Big Daddy: Blanche's father, Big Daddy (Murray Hamilton) wants to become a country-western singer.25. The Way We Met: The Girls recall how they became room-mates.The series was an instant success. Frequent reruns on numerous stations, such as Lifetime, WE, and The Hallmark Channel, have only increased the series' appeal. The Golden Girls are as enduring as they are humorously endearing. Needless to say, ""The Golden Girls"" on DVD is highly recommended.",5,"""THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND""",1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,4156,"['recent', 'deaths', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'watching', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'more', 'poignant', 'certainly', 'not', 'less', 'funny', 'experience', 'series', 'began', '1985', 'immediately', 'defined', 'phrase', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'college', 'friends', 'was', 'always', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'answer', 'always', 'was', 'stayed', 'home', 'watched', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'course', 'basic', 'series', 'premise', 'familiar', 'fans', 'now', 'Three', 'women', 'age', '50', 'Blanche', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'are', 'room-mates', 'Blanche', 'Florida', 'house', 'Blanche', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'man-crazy', 'seemingly', 'over-sexed', 'Rose', 'Betty', 'White', 'sweetly', 'naive', 'life', 'Dorothy', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'sensible', 'one', 'Arthur', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'dead-pan', 'delivery', 'ground', 'series', 'reality', 'trio', 'soon', 'joined', 'Dorothy', 'wise-cracking', 'mother', 'Sophia', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'who', 'retirement', 'home', 'burns', 'down', 'foursome', 'remain', 'best', 'friends', 'thick', 'thin', 'many', 'comic', 'misadventures:1', 'Engagement', 'Pilot', 'Blanche', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'Harry', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'Note', 'episode', 'Girls', 'have', 'gay', 'cook', 'named', 'Coco', 'who', 'was', 'immediately', 'written', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'decided', 'Sophia', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'give', 'uncensored', 'remarks.2', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Wedding', 'Dorothy', 'delighted', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'ex-husband', 'Stan', 'Herbert', 'Edelman', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'wedding.3', 'Rose', 'Prude', 'Rose', 'ponders', 'being', 'intimate', 'man', 'first', 'time', 'beloved', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'died', 'Guest', 'star', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'would', 'portray', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'Miles', 'Webber', 'later', 'series.4', 'Transplant', 'Blanche', 'sister', 'Virginia', 'Sheri', 'North', 'need', 'kidney', 'transplant.5', 'Triangle', 'man', 'misunderstanding', 'Dorothy', 'Blanche.6', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Blanche', 'undisciplined', 'grandson', 'Billy', 'Jacoby', 'visits', 'lesson', 'manners', 'Girls', 'Billy', 'Jacoby', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Jacoby', 'would', 'portray', 'Dorothy', 'son', 'Michael', 'later', 'series.7', 'Competition', 'bowling', 'tournament', 'out', 'worst', 'Girls.8', 'Break-In', 'Girls', 'are', 'robbed', 'terrified', 'Rose', 'gun', 'Sophia', 'remarks', 'one', 'night', ""'ll"", 'belch', 'stable', 'Mable', 'here', 'will', 'blow', 'head', 'off.', '9', 'Blanche', 'Younger', 'Man', 'Blanche', 'much', 'younger', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'Rose', 'mother', 'visits', 'soon', 'resents', 'Rose', 'being', 'so', 'over-protective', 'mothering', 'her.10', 'Heart', 'Attack', 'Sophia', 'heart', 'attack', 'storm.11', 'Stan', 'Return', 'Stan', 'returns', 'again', 'much', 'annoyance', 'Dorothy', 'Sophia.12', 'Custody', 'Battle', 'Dorothy', 'sister', 'Gloria', 'Sophia', 'live', 'her.13', 'Little', 'Romance', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'Rose', 'Dr.', 'Jonathon', 'Newman', 'very', 'short', 'man', 'wacky', 'dream.14', 'Was', 'Lady', 'Dorothy', 'married', 'man', 'feels', 'guilty.15', 'Bed', 'Rose', 'Rose', 'shocked', 'when', 'date', 'dies', 'bed.16', 'Truth', 'Will', 'Out', 'Rose', 'nervous', 'visit', 'daughter', 'grand-daughter.17', 'Nice', 'Easy', 'Blanche', 'niece', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'her.18', 'Operation', 'Dorothy', 'scared', 'have', 'operation', 'foot.19', 'Second', 'Motherhood', 'Blanche', 'wealthy', 'businessman.20', 'Education', 'Blanche', 'propositioned', 'nightschool', 'teacher.21', 'Flu', 'Attack', 'Just', 'Friends', 'Good', 'Health', 'Awards', 'Banquet', 'Girls', 'Sophia', 'are', 'struck', 'bythe', 'flu.22', 'Job', 'Hunting', 'When', 'Grief', 'Center', 'Rose', 'trouble', 'finding', 'job.23', 'Ambition', 'Polly', 'Holliday', 'guest', 'stars', 'Rose', 'sister', 'Lily', 'who', 'recently', 'became', 'blind', 'Girls', 'attempt', 'have', 'yard', 'sale', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'part', 'belongings.24', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Blanche', 'father', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'become', 'country-western', 'singer.25', 'Way', 'Met', 'Girls', 'recall', 'how', 'became', 'room-mates.The', 'series', 'was', 'instant', 'success', 'Frequent', 'reruns', 'numerous', 'stations', 'such', 'Lifetime', 'WE', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'have', 'only', 'increased', 'series', 'appeal', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'are', 'as', 'enduring', 'are', 'humorously', 'endearing', 'Needless', 'say', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

God knows with television currently focusing on little other then 'reality-based' programs or silly domestic comedies ( i.e. ""Yes, Dear "" or "" Still Standing "" ) its more then just a little delightful to see this classic ( yes, classic! ) show arriving in glorious DVD.Watching the "" Golden Girls "" is rather like visiting old friends whose company you constantly crave. Watching Dorothy, Bea Arthur, do her 'stop you in your tracks' double-take after suffering thru another St. Olaf story still brings laughter to this viewer and perhaps always will. Perhaps one of this shows greatest assests is simply that each character, be it Rose, Blance, Dorothy or even 'Ma' is so well defined and fleshed out by their respective actress that you truly feel as though you know these wonderful women and care about them deeply as well. The episode where Rose and Blanche start an "" Unofficial Elvis Presley Fan Club "" must be considered some of the finest comedy writing ever to grace the airwaves. Oddly enough though I truly do not watch the show simply for 'laugh out loud' jokes but for the sense of family that this show creates with such believability and finesse that sometimes it has me wondering if, in some strange way, this isn't some type of reality show that I am indeed enjoying!All in all, its simply impossible in many ways to explain to others why some things tickle your 'funny bone' and why some others may not. Trying to put into words why this show is so utterly charming is perhaps beyond words other then to say that it is simply wonderful to watch a television program that doesn't beg the viewer to watch and almost plead to enjoy. One in which the characters are not only humorous but also very real, alive and four women who enjoy life so very, very much. Take the "" Golden Girls ' on your own terms ( which is all its ever asked! ) and take comfort that for many of us Dorothy, Blanche, Rose and Ma will always be golden.

Each of these women bring something different and hilarious to each episode. And honestly i have never even met or heard of anyone who has ever said that they didn't like Golden Girls. Although the cast consists of four elderly Caucasian women, this show can (and still is) enjoyed by people of different races and age brackets. I am 24 years old and I've been laughing and enjoying Golden Girls episodes for years. They're not the ""norm"" in terms of what you'd expect from older women, they have some of the funniest punch lines and delivery and the acting is so great that you'll forget you're actually watching a TV show.The best shows are the most down to earth shows and that's exactly what Golden Girls is. From Dorothy's quick witted side splitting sarcasm, to Rose's classic St Olaf stories, along with Sophia's wise cracks and Blanche's over the top personality, all four of these ladies are sure to have you laughing through the entire episodes. I had the privilege of meeting the late Estelle Getty (who plays the role of Sophia) before she passed and she was truly sweet and hilarious, just like the rest of her cast members.

Winner of 11 Emmy awards, this landmark comedy has it all, laughs, drama, feminist issues, and social issues other shows did not dare touch for its time, such as homosexuality, mixed race marriages, lesbians, sperm donors, and so forth. Dorothy is the sharp tongued level headed member of the clan whose wit and wisdom usually provides the way out of any jam the girls have gotten themselves into. Rose is the lovable blonde Scandinavian whose dense perception sets the stage for outrageous humor and outlook on life. Blanche is the oversexed gal whose had more men than she can count and is a walking encyclopedia on the realm of men and dating. And there's Dorothy's mother Sophia with her old world charm, wisdom and whose gracious humor and nature sets her apart from the typical old lady of the house. For seven years these four vivacious and sassy ladies were a joy to welcome into our homes every Saturday nite and we wanted them with us for more than just a half hour. Now we can have them with us for all time and learn vital lessons of life from their views like never before. Though the edited versions come on Lifetime each day, we can hopefully now see each show uncut and commercial free as it is supposed to be. A whole new generation can experience the laughter, joy, and hilarity we lived with years ago and can do so for years to come. This DVD release is a piece of heaven.

847786,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,B0002W4SX6,Ian Phillips,"[8, 8]","Oh how I really love this show! I was devastated when this programme finished (its sequel, The Golden Palace failed to live up to the dynamics of The Golden Girls and was scapped after just one season of 24 episodes)! Though it wound up production well over ten years ago, The Golden Girls (1985 - 1992) still firmly ranks as one of my all-time favourite sitcoms. The Golden Girls was a huge success throughout the duration of its run, collecting ten emmy awards including one for this first season for outstanding comedy series. In all, an impressive total of 180 fun-filled episodes were produced of The Golden Girls.In 2005 Buena Vista Home Entertainment began releasing the early seasons of The Golden Girls (and not before time!). This 4-disc set of the first season is attractively packaged , containing all 25 episodes and also boasts a bonus feature which sees Joan and Melissa Rivers offering their own witty fashion critique to the now laughably dated and kitschy wardrobe of The Golden Girls.The Golden Girls is set in the heart of Miami where four middle-aged to elderly women share a house and touchingly support one another, trade insults, eat a whole lot of cheese cake together and almost incessantly talk about sex.Buxom, Southern-belle Blance Deveraux, a promiscuous widow (she even tried to date a man on the day of her husbands funeral) advertises for two room mates in her Miami Beach home, for companionship and above all else at the time, to apportion costs of the running of her home. A fiesty but well-meaning and very likeable character, Blanche thinks of little else but sex, sex, sex and is forever on the look-out for a man. She is also (slightly unhealthily) obsessed with her looks and age often fearing her beauty is fading as old age looms closer. Southern-belle Blance Deveraux is marvelously played by the charismatic Rue McClanahan who really excells in the role.Dorothy Zbomak is a tall, elegant though earthy and gruff-voiced (which becomes the [...] of many a joke in the series) supply teacher. She had recently divorced from the adulterous Stan Zbomak after he had run off with an air hostess. This is how Dorothy came to be living with sultry, man eater Blance Deveraux after answering her advertisment for two room mates to share her Miami Beach home. Dorothy is beautifully played by the inimitable Bea Arthur. Bea Arthur's impeccable timing and witty delivery is one of the many reasons why The Golden Girls was such a unique and special comedy series.The dizzy, scatter-brained Rose Nylund was the illegitimate daughter of a monk, was sadly orphaned at birth and is of Scandinavian lineage. Rose had married a man named Charlie Nylund but he died one night whilst making mad, passionate love to Rose. Rose had met Blanche Deveraux in the local supermarket when Blanche was about to pin up her advert for two room mates. Blanche was instantly taken with Rose's sweet though rather niaeve character and invited Rose to move in with her, an offer which Rose swiftly accepted. Despite not being quite all there, Rose worked as a grief councellor. Betty White's beautiful portrayal of Rose Nylund is a joy to watch. Though Rose often provides a foil for the other characters to make the focus of a joke, Betty White's sparkling performance ensures that she remains just as inadvertently witty and amusing as the other players.Last but certainly not least is Sophia Petrillo. Sophia is Dorothy's widowed, 80 year old and loveably eccentric mother. Sophia is of Sicillian descent and possesses a notably razor-sharp tongue. After a fire at the retirement home she was living in, Sophia moves in with Dorothy, Rose and Blanche. The then little known Estelle Getty, who put in a charming performance as acid-tongued Sophia Petrillo, was in actual fact, two months younger than her screen daughter, Bea Arthur. This was down to a fantastic, top-notch make up job which effectively ""aged her up"". The oldest member of the cast was infact the lovely Betty White, who played loveable dumb-blonde, Rose Nylund.Created by Susan Harris (previously famous for the late 70's/early 80's sitcom, Soap), The Golden Girls boasts fast, furious scripts that crackles with sharp, intelligent wit and four dynamic characters that spark off one another highly effectively. The chemistry of Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Estelle Getty is magical, really shining through and becoming one of the sole ingredients to its knockout, phenemenal success.I'd be here forever if I did a detailed break down of each episode on this first season collection but some of my personal favourites include the series pilot when Blanche is about to wed a two-timing cheat, the one where they all compete in a bowling pin championshp - Betty White in particular causes the most significant amusement in that episode , another one where they arrive home one night after seeing Madonna in concert (who 80 year old Sophia laughably describes as ""a [...]"" - tact is not one of Sophias strong points!) and find their home has been ramsacked and an episode which flashes back to how Dorothy, Rose and Blanche very first met. Throughout the other episodes it touches on their family relationships, their often complex affairs with men, shared stories and reminisces bewteen the four characters. At times the comedy can turn poignantly into drama, other times merely depicting their fondness for each other (without shrinking to being saccharine or schmaltzy).I don't know why but when I think of The Golden Girls, I always picture Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia seated around the kitchen dining table, delicately tucking into cheese cake (Bea Arthur actually detested cheese cake in real life), indulging in what seems like a verbal tennis match, exchanging stories about love, life and men whilst in Rose's case she'd usually come out with some pointless story ""back in St Olaph"" or Sophia prattling on about Siccerly usually beginning with ""picture it...Siccerly, 1953"" etc.The contrast of these four loveable characters from the sharp, witty Dorothy to fiery, vein Blanche, to dizzy, niaeve Rose to the sharp-tongued Sophia is what made The Golden Girls such a huge International success story. It is an important landmark in American television history. ESSENTIAL to any serious comedy collection! Wonderful!(Incidentally i'd LOVE to see a reunion special of the Golden Girls!)Ian PhillipsAugust 2006",5,"Fantastic, Emmy Award Winning Sitcom With Charming, Loveable Performances From The Four

847800,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B0002W4SX6,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[0, 0]","Back on September 14, 1985 a new sitcom made its television debut on NBC. I would have never realized then that it would become my all-time favorite TV show. ""The Golden Girls"" is not only the best TV sitcom of all-time, it's the funniest. There have been many sitcoms that have made me laugh out loud, but ""The Golden Girls"" made me laugh the hardest, and it still does 20 years later. The creator of ""The Golden Girls"" is Susan Harris, one of TV's best sitcom writers who created another uproarious sitcom during the '70s: ""Soap"". Man is this show funny. Not only is it funny, it's very well-written, well-directed, and well-acted by all. And now I'm going to review each season of my favorite show ""The Golden Girls""SEASON ONE (1985-86)In its very first season, ""The Golden Girls"" became a big hit with critics and audiences alike. Season One was an absolute gem, introducing the four women who would make us laugh for a long time to come: Dorothy, the divorced substitute teacher from New York; Rose, the naive and widowed grief counselor from Minnesota; Blanche, the oversexed southern belle and art museum worker from Georgia who, like Rose, was also a widow; and Sophia, Dorothy's tart-tongued 80-year-old mother from Sicily. These four women lived together as roommates in a house in Miami, and would become best friends. The four actresses who played these characters were perfect from the start. Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty were superb in their roles as Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, and Sophia.Some of the memorable episodes in Season One include: Dorothy preparing for her daughter's wedding, and not looking forward to seeing her ex-husband Stan on the day of the nuptials; Blanche's 14-year-old grandson stopping by for a visit; the girls' Miami home getting robbed and Rose going to bizarre measures to keep safe; Sophia thinking she's having a heart attack; Rose dating a midget; the girls all getting sick with the flu at the same time and in the process get on each others' nerves; Blanche's father paying a visit to announce that he's persuing a career as a country singer, and a flashback episode on how the girls' first met. There isn't a weak link in any of the episodes in Season One, and it's a season to cherish.For Season One, ""The Golden Girls"" won two Golden Globe Awards as Best Comedy Series and Best Actress in a Comedy Series for Estelle Getty, who stole the show as Sophia.

From Season 1 all up to the end of the final season (Season 7)there is so much laughter and comedy and even better is how many episodes not only had its usual comedy but how many serious issues the series actually dealt with. Episodes of teen pregnancy,sexual harrassment,politics,sexuality,to simple quarrels among the ladies.I've enjoyed the show since I was a kid (I'm only 19 lol)and you see these mature older women in their prime who still have healthy sexual relationships and also suffer from failed relationships.Today,television is consumed in physical attraction,how thin one is,how much sexuality is aired on television is beyond belief.The Golden Girls is a show where the viewer isn't bombarded with such negative situations but rather with situations where the average person may go through.It's a good show where these ladies with different personalities all blend in together to form a hilarious band of best friends:Dorothy: She's the educated, strong woman who although got ""knocked"" up as a teenager, she's a very straightforward character who loves Rose but hates those St.Olaf stories.Blanche sometimes puts Dorothy down in regards to her looks saying she's never had many boyfriends unlike Blanche whose had more than one can remember. Sometimes her own mother Sophia hilariously tells her own daughter why she can't get a boyfriend.Sophia: She's almost like the philosopher of the group.She tells stories to the girls to help them get by their problems often exaggerating her stories and characters within those stories.Though she may be in her 80s, Sophia is still out looking for fun and a good laugh.Rose: Often, she is confused for an idiot, although she is no idiot, it's fitting to say she's naive. Rose annoys the other ladies by constantly telling her St.Olaf stories but mostly with her naive attitude, the other characters are still annoyed.Blanche: She's overly sexual and uses her sexuality to get what she wants.Though sometimes getting her into trouble, Blanche is out to look for a good time with so many different men that even in some episodes Blanche gets carried away and gets ""hot"" or excited.Together, they are the Golden Girls who made this series a smash and the thought of one of these ladies missing makes the cast incomplete. The series itself is pure genius and makes for great comedy among the older population but also appeals to the younger audience with its lively characters.Thank You for being a friend.",5,Old Age Seems Alot Funner...,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2538,"['be', 'one', 'most', 'funniest', 'most', 'classic', 'sitcom', '1980s', 'Season', '1', 'up', 'end', 'final', 'season', 'Season', '7', 'so', 'much', 'laughter', 'comedy', 'even', 'better', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'usual', 'comedy', 'how', 'many', 'serious', 'issues', 'series', 'actually', 'Episodes', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'politics', 'sexuality', 'simple', 'quarrels', 'ladies.I', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'show', 'was', 'kid', ""'m"", 'only', '19', 'lol', 'see', 'mature', 'older', 'women', 'prime', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'healthy', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'also', 'suffer', 'failed', 'relationships.Today', 'television', 'consumed', 'physical', 'attraction', 'how', 'thin', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'sexuality', 'aired', 'television', 'belief.The', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'show', 'where', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'bombarded', 'such', 'negative', 'situations', 'rather', 'situations', 'where', 'average', 'person', 'may', 'go', 'through.It', 'good', 'show', 'where', 'ladies', 'different', 'personalities', 'blend', 'together', 'form', 'hilarious', 'band', 'best', 'friends', 'Dorothy', 'educated', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'knocked', 'up', 'teenager', 'very', 'straightforward', 'character', 'who', 'Rose', 'hates', 'St.Olaf', 'stories.Blanche', 'sometimes', 'Dorothy', 'down', 'regards', 'looks', 'saying', 'never', 'had', 'many', 'boyfriends', 'Blanche', 'had', 'more', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'Sometimes', 'own', 'mother', 'Sophia', 'hilariously', 'own', 'daughter', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'boyfriend.Sophia', 'almost', 'philosopher', 'group.She', 'stories', 'girls', 'help', 'get', 'problems', 'often', 'exaggerating', 'stories', 'characters', 'may', 'be', '80s', 'Sophia', 'still', 'out', 'looking', 'fun', 'good', 'laugh.Rose', 'Often', 'confused', 'idiot', 'idiot', 'fitting', 'say', 'naive', 'Rose', 'other', 'ladies', 'constantly', 'telling', 'St.Olaf', 'stories', 'mostly', 'naive', 'attitude', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'overly', 'sexual', 'sexuality', 'get', 'what', 'wants.Though', 'sometimes', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Blanche', 'out', 'look', 'good', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'men', 'even', 'episodes', 'Blanche', 'carried', 'away', 'hot', 'excited.Together', 'are', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'who', 'made', 'series', 'smash', 'thought', 'one', 'ladies', 'missing', 'cast', 'incomplete', 'series', 'pure', 'genius', 'great', 'comedy', 'older', 'population', 'also', 'appeals', 'younger', 'audience', 'lively', 'characters.Thank', 'being', 'friend']",N/A

Actually, Rose sometimes acts like SpongeBob.  And Sophia...In ""The Heart Attack,"" her gluttony gets to her.  Sophia isn't gluttonous because she's Italian (though the stereotype gets cheerfully, lovingly skewered).  She's gluttonous because she's Sophia--living life to the fullest.  Which all of the women do, even often dour Dorothy.  Hey, with an ex like Stan, it's no wonder she tends to come off as a drill sergeant.  And Blanche...shallow, sexy, sex-seeking, self-centered, but unexpectedly spiritual and the only man she'll truly ever love is her late husband George.  Great stuff.

And even if you can't relate entirely to the situations presented, there's always a theme that can be related to, regardless of age.  Add in some great actors, and you've got yourself an excellent show!The Golden Girls follows four roommates who are all in their ""golden"" years.  There's Blanche, the owner of the house and the boy crazy one of the bunch.  Dorothy, the sarcastic divorced woman who seems to be the sensible one most of the time.  Dorothy's mother Sophia, who has no filter and does a lot of the cooking.  And finally, Rose, the absent-minded one who is the heart of the group.  Together they get into quite a bit of trouble and have all kinds of problems with dating and just general living.  But since they're all together they manage to get through each day.Characters:Beatrice Arthur: DorothyRue McClanahan: BlancheEstelle Getty: SophiaBetty White: RoseYou don't really need any other characters than these four.  Sure there are some random family members and dates that pop in and out, but they're more props than anything.  Although I do wonder where the cook from the first couple of episodes disappeared to.  All the ladies play wonderfully off of each other though and you really feel as if they're living life, not acting it.  And they make you want to have a group of friends to live with when you get older as they have so much fun.  But they all have distinct personalities.  I appreciate Dorothy's sarcasm and Rose's absentmindedness.  I get a little tired of Blanche's romantic notions sometimes, but you can't deny that McClanahan plays the part well.  And Getty as Sophia is downright hilarious at times.You would think watching a show about four older women would be boring.  But it's not.  They write in enough comedy that you're always laughing.  And while it's not action packed it still has quite a bit going on.  Obviously the story arcs over all the seasons and episodes, but each episode has a small issue that is normally resolved by the end.  So they are almost somewhat stand alone in that nature.  I would still watch them in order though.  Each episode leaves you wanting more and it's easy to sit down and watch a whole disc in one sitting.They mostly spend time in the house so there's not a whole lot of setting going on.  In fact, I can't even tell you what some of the colors are of the furniture even though I see it every episode.  I pay more attention to the dialogue and what the people are doing rather than where they are.  Which I think kind of speaks as to what sort of show it is, there isn't a need for fancy sets or camera work or special effects.  There also isn't a need for music, although there is some background instrumentals.  And the theme song is pretty catchy and instantly recognizable.So ""Thank You For Being A Friend"" Golden Girls.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series and regretting that Betty White is the only one of these wonderful women still around.  They put out a fantastic show.Review by M.

Hard-driving, no-nonsense, Dorothy Zbornak (Beatrice Arthur), dim-witted fluff ball, Rose Nylund (Betty White) and haughty femme du jour, Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan) shared their deluxe accommodations with Dorothy's mother, Sophia Patrillo (Estelle Getty - the youngest in the troupe) after Sophia's retirement home burnt down. The first season follows `the girls' as they go through a series of adjustments and failed attempts to find marital happiness the second, third and tenth time around. Each episode is a gem, but aficionados will note that in the first two episodes the girls (except for Arthur) look considerably older than they do in the rest of the series. The laughs come fast and furious. Highlights include Rose's lover dying of a heart attack after a night of passion, Blanche's planned affair with her personal trainer and Dorothy's failed reunion with her ex husband, Stan (Herb Edelman). For outright riotous fun, this is one series from the 80s that - despite its dated set d&eacute;cor and costuming - hasn't dated in terms of good time humor and great fun.Unfortunately Buena Vista's three disc DVD collection presents a series of problems for certain DVD players. If you discover cut outs in sound in episodes 3-7 and 11 and 15, or experience sudden fades during the opening theme music - it's an interesting anomaly that only seems to happen on certain models of DVD players. By that measure, I can't really fault the disc mastering entirely. But I can fault Buena Vista for presenting `the girls' in a rather inconsistently rendered batch of transfers. Colors vary widely from episode to episode. Flesh tones are sometimes too pink, sometimes too orange, and other times nicely balanced. There are a barrage of glitches associated with digital tape that crop up throughout the episodes, including blips and lines running up and down the image. This isn't a stellar presentation of one of the most successful sitcoms in television history and it's certainly not the way I'd like to remember `the girls' for years to come.",2,BRONZE TRANSFER FOR THESE GOLDEN LADIES,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,2214,"['1985', 'television', 'was', 'introduced', 'rambunctious', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'wacky', 'troupe', 'hill', 'living', 'posh', 'pastel', 'surroundings', 'Miami', 'Hard-driving', 'no-nonsense', 'Dorothy', 'Zbornak', 'Beatrice', 'Arthur', 'dim-witted', 'fluff', 'ball', 'Rose', 'Nylund', 'Betty', 'White', 'femme', 'du', 'jour', 'Blanche', 'Devereaux', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'shared', 'deluxe', 'accommodations', 'Dorothy', 'mother', 'Sophia', 'Patrillo', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'youngest', 'troupe', 'Sophia', 'retirement', 'home', 'burnt', 'down', 'first', 'season', 'girls', 'go', 'series', 'adjustments', 'failed', 'attempts', 'find', 'marital', 'happiness', 'second', 'third', 'tenth', 'time', 'around', 'episode', 'gem', 'aficionados', 'will', 'note', 'first', 'two', 'girls', 'Arthur', 'look', 'considerably', 'older', 'do', 'rest', 'series', 'laughs', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Rose', 'lover', 'dying', 'heart', 'attack', 'night', 'passion', 'Blanche', 'planned', 'affair', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Dorothy', 'failed', 'reunion', 'ex', 'husband', 'Stan', 'Herb', 'Edelman', 'outright', 'riotous', 'fun', 'one', 'series', '80s', 'dated', 'set', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'costuming', ""n't"", 'dated', 'terms', 'good', 'time', 'humor', 'great', 'fun.Unfortunately', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'three', 'disc', 'DVD', 'collection', 'series', 'problems', 'certain', 'DVD', 'players', 'discover', 'cut', 'outs', 'sound', 'episodes', '3-7', '11', '15', 'experience', 'sudden', 'fades', 'opening', 'theme', 'music', 'interesting', 'anomaly', 'only', 'happen', 'certain', 'models', 'DVD', 'players', 'measure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'disc', 'mastering', 'entirely', 'can', 'fault', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'presenting', 'girls', 'rather', 'inconsistently', 'rendered', 'batch', 'transfers', 'Colors', 'vary', 'widely', 'episode', 'episode', 'Flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'sometimes', 'too', 'pink', 'sometimes', 'too', 'orange', 'other', 'times', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'are', 'barrage', 'glitches', 'associated', 'digital', 'tape', 'crop', 'up', 'episodes', 'including', 'blips', 'lines', 'running', 'up', 'image', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'presentation', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'television', 'history', 'certainly', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'remember', 'girls', 'years', 'come']",N/A

People don't know how much this show was watched by young viewers, given the women being in their 60s for their characters.  It made them think more about their grandmothers or elderly people, rather than thinking about themselves.  There was a nice chemistry between the four characters.  And if they were to do a reunion show, Blanche would still be man chasing at those younger men, making her passes at them!  The Miami theme was like a softer side for those who wouldn't watch the more agressive crime drama of Miami Vice on the same NBC network. This show surprised many critics, TV people and viewers.

Golden Girls is a sitcom about four senior ladies living under one roof in Miami, Florida, and all the zany and fun things that goes in their lives. The show revolves around sex hungry Blanche (Rue McLanahan) with her southern charm, and Sophia (Estelle Getty) as a sharp talking Sicilian with wit, and her daughter Dorothy (Bea Arthur) as a wise member of the house hold, and then the sweet and innocent Rose (Betty White) make a wonderful team and an excellent recipe for a great comedy. There are 25 episodes (season 1) on this DVD; in the episode Transplant, we see how a delicate and serious issue such as a request for an organ donation from a family member is dealt with when Blanche's sister Virginia asks for her kidney which would save Virginia's life. In Bed of Rose's episode a date of Rose passes away in his sleep; this shows the problems of old people dating, and how the girls deal with the situation.

847842,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0002W4SX6,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[4, 4]","It's absolutely amazing how a TV comedy about 4 pensioners, made and set in the mid-1980's, is still so fresh and so funny today, almost 20 years later.Dororthy, Blanche and Rose all share a house in Miami, and are joined by Dorothy's octogenarian mother Sophia, when her retirement home burns down. The adventures and misadventures of these four women makes for the most entertaining and episode-for-episode funniest DVD collection I've ever had the pleasure of owning.So where to start? Dorothy (Bea Arthur) is a jewel, a grim and urbane tank of a woman with a voice like Barry White and an attitude like Leona Helsmley, a relief school teacher, and is plagued by her philandering ex-husband and irked by the antics of her earthy, mischievous mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). Blanche Devereaux, the house owner and a grand southern dame in the manner of Blanche DuBois, is, as Dorothy puts it, 'classified by the Navy as a friendly port', and Rose (Betty White) is the personification of midwest naivete, full of stories and foolishness and expert comedic timing.Actually, I think timing is what it's all about. Although the dialogue in places may lack some of the polish and finnesse of later seasons (but this is true of all TV sitcoms, really), it's an absolute joy to watch four established performers on a brilliantly-written, outlandishly funny stage. The one-liners and put-downs come ninteen to the dozen and the heart and warmth of the show is thrown into relief because of this.The costumes and overall 'look' of the show is mired so awfully in the excessive 80's (padded collars, padded shoulders, pastel synthetics, LOTS and LOTS of yellow crepe) that it becomes sort-of timeless, but it's a testimony to both the quality of writing and prestiege of the performers that they do not become charicatures of themselves.All in all, this is a collection that no comedy fan can afford to be without.

847853,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0002W4SX6,Simon Davis,"[2, 3]","A total joy is the best way to describe my feelings about this very special series that dared to defy most of the accepted television stereotypes about how ""older"" women were expected to behave and live their lives. Indeed in my book five stars are not nearly enough to describe this wonderful series that debuted in 1985 and ran for seven stunning seasons. It was a unique format for any period on television where the women starring in the series weren't gorgeous young babes showing lots of cleveage and little talent, these four gifted performers; Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty were seniors in comparison and proved that comedy could be just as sparkling and indeed just as sexy when you are over 50. Between Dorothy the leader with the cutting one liners, Blanche the sexy Southern Belle with men always on her mind, naive Rose with her hilarious St Orlov stories, and straight talking senior citizen Sophia, we as the audience were guaranteed lots of laughs with each episode and were very often left with something memorable  to think about later. ""The Golden Girls', with its superb performances and first class writing had a wonderful way of combining hilarious comedy high jinks with moments of great emotion and tenderness that made it stand leagues above most other television shows of that time and certainly those of the present. Laughter, love, and a whole lot of cheesecake made ""The Golden Girls"", essential viewing each week for years in my home as it was in countless others across the world for those seven years.It is interesting to see in this superb DVD box set of the complete first season of 25 episodes that in some of the very early stories the women are still finding their characters and developing them up to what we all remember them so well as in later years. It's also interesting to see the initial pilot that has now become episode one in this boxed set where the girls actually have a man servant/cook called Coco living with them who was promptly written out of the series from the second episode. Despite the series still being in its infant stage in season one it contained some truly brilliant episodes that deservedly won the series an Emmy award for best Comedy Series of the year. All four actresses were given stories during this first season that allowed each of them to shine and allowed us as the audience to get to know their unique character traits just that little better. I think every ""Golden Girls"", fan has their own particular favourites among these first season episodes. I think almost all of them are brilliant however my personal favourite of the season is the hilarious ""Blanche and the Younger Man"", that really allowed all four actresses to develop their characters where we see Blanche trying to recapture her youth by dating a young fitness instructor while at the same time Rose's mother pays a visit and brings a few home truths to the girls about getting older.While the restored episodes are everything a devoted ""Golden Girls"", fan like myself could wish for the same cannot be said for the supposed ""extras"", contained in this season one boxed set. We are inflicted with a truly terrible ""fashion commentary"", by the Queen of bad taste and crassness Joan Rivers. Why she was asked to comment on the costumes worn on the show escapes me but she manages to do a total hatchet job which is basically an insult to the series. My suggestion would be to ignore this ""extra"", all together and just concentrate on what really matters which is the wonderful work done by the four actresses in these season one episodes.Thankfully despite its huge success from its first year ""The Golden Girls"", was never really imitated or copied which helps make it all the more unique in the annuals of television sit-com history. Watching this first season boxed set has made me fall in love with Dorothy, Blanche, Rose, and Sophia all over again as I'm sure it will do the same  to anyone else who purchases this DVD. Excellence in television comedy is a rare commodity these days and I can't recommend ""The Golden Girls: The Complete First Season"", highly enough.

My mother used to watch it ( and she is very picky )and she would always tell me to sit-along but it took me awhile to follow her advice. I remember catching an odd episode here and there and I really appreciated it. But it took me to the reruns of the later years to ""really"" watch it. It is been on ever since but lately I can only watch in 1 am when I am on nightshift. So I decided to get me these DVDs after all and I do not regret it.

Being older now then when I first watched it, I can appreciate the themes much better than as a teen.It is a special treat for me to listen to their original voices, although the German-dubbed version was alright, a lot of its bite was lost during translation, because you simply cannot translate American style jokes.

A true landmark in situation comedy, ""The Golden Girls"" has established itself as a broadcasting classic along with ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""Mary Tyler Moore"", ""All in The Family"",  and ""I Love Lucy"". This DVD set features all 25 episodes of the series that originally aired in the 1985-86 TV season. The show would become a top 10 series and would win the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy, as well as an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy for Bette White. This first season sets up the characters and the relationships the girls have with each other and what made ""The Golden Girls"" so wonderful that there was at least one golden girl that we could relate to. The chemistry among the cast was impeccable: White, Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty all showed the love and admiration they had for one another, and it was no surprise that they would all win Emmy awards for their roles in subsequent seasons, a feat only matched with the cast of ""All in The Family"".The best episodes this year are ""The Flu"" in which the roomates all get sick, with the exception of Sophia. They then all have to stay cooped up in the house while getting on each others nerves. ""A Little Romance"" is excellent as Rose dates a midget. The pilot is also included in this set. Written by Susan Harris (who created the series), Blanche finds herself getting married as Sophia moves in with the roomies when her retirement home burns down.The only bonus features are a forgetable piece hosted by Joan and Melissa Rivers talking about the different clothes the golden girls wore.The shows are on three individual discs and the shows themselves look breathtaking, considering they are over twenty years old.One good thing too about ""The Golden Girls"" is that every single season has been released and all episodes are uncut unlike the many syndicated shows that are spliced up to allow stations room for more commercials. They don't make TV shows like this anymore.

The acting is good, the writing is good and the guest stars are fabulous.  No matter what your age, this show is funny.  I think that's the key to it's success.  Though it centers around 3 50+ women and 1 80+ plus senior, it still is funny to all ages.The quality of the picture, color and sound is outstanding and the complete, uncut episodes are wonderful.

847865,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0002W4SX6,Twiddles42,"[2, 3]","Picture it:  November 23, 2004.  A man who had signed petitions all over cyberspace to get ""The Golden Girls"" released on DVD smiles with childlike glee to see the season 1 box set on the shelf!I've always been a fan of this show; which is well written, well acted, and well balanced.  Dorothy the sardonic intellectual.  Rose the loveable naive twit.  Sophia the wisecracking mother, due to a stroke.  Blanche the free spirit.  Add in Bea Arthur, Betty White, Estelle Getty, and Rue McClanahan, and a nonstop hit was born.The show lasted for 7 highly successful seasons, which had Dorothy of all people leaving the group at the end because she fell in love.  Which is almost ironic when you consider what she had said at the end of the pilot episode.  :-)At $34.99, this set is a steal.  All the episodes exist, complete with a commentary on ""kitschy 80s fashion"".  I have not yet seen this extra, but as the Golden Girls themselves always wore such wonderful outfits (that's not sarcasm either), I can't wait to see it.It's a pity we don't have any of the actresses doing episodic commentary (maybe for season 2?) but that's a minor quibble.The DVD packaging has only one minor point:  Disc 2 has to be removed in order to access disc 3.  However, I won't drop any points.  :-)DVD sound quality is as good as Dolby 2.0 can get.  No arguments here.DVD video quality is exceptional.  The dual-layer disc allows 8 episodes to be put on a disc with no compromise in quality.  Big kudos to Buena Vista for going the extra mile here; some distributors don't.Original video quality is excellent, if not slightly soft.  However, this is really a non-issue.Any fans of the show will be utterly DELIGHTED to see this set.  Anyone interested in the show should at least rent it, but it will win you over with its charm.Note:  The pilot episode featured the four Girls and a gay chef.  The gay character was dropped from the series after the pilot was screened.  It's obvious that his character, which is too similar to Dorothy's, wasn't necessary.  It was a nice thought at the time, but the inter-character chemistry did work far better without him.",5,Worth every penny and more!!,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2141,"['Picture', 'November', '23', '2004', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'signed', 'petitions', 'over', 'cyberspace', 'get', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'released', 'DVD', 'smiles', 'childlike', 'glee', 'see', 'season', '1', 'box', 'set', 'shelf', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'balanced', 'Dorothy', 'sardonic', 'intellectual', 'Rose', 'loveable', 'naive', 'twit', 'Sophia', 'wisecracking', 'mother', 'due', 'stroke', 'Blanche', 'free', 'spirit', 'Add', 'Bea', 'Arthur', 'Betty', 'White', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'nonstop', 'hit', 'was', 'born.The', 'show', 'lasted', '7', 'highly', 'successful', 'seasons', 'had', 'Dorothy', 'people', 'leaving', 'group', 'end', 'fell', 'love', 'Which', 'almost', 'ironic', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'had', 'said', 'end', 'pilot', 'episode', '34.99', 'set', 'steal', 'episodes', 'exist', 'complete', 'commentary', 'kitschy', '80s', 'fashion', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'extra', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'always', 'wore', 'such', 'wonderful', 'outfits', 'not', 'sarcasm', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'it.It', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'actresses', 'doing', 'episodic', 'commentary', 'maybe', 'season', '2', 'minor', 'quibble.The', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'only', 'one', 'minor', 'point', 'Disc', '2', 'be', 'removed', 'order', 'access', 'disc', '3', 'However', 'wo', ""n't"", 'drop', 'points', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'can', 'get', 'arguments', 'here.DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'exceptional', 'dual-layer', 'disc', '8', 'episodes', 'be', 'put', 'disc', 'compromise', 'quality', 'Big', 'kudos', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'going', 'extra', 'mile', 'here', 'distributors', ""don't.Original"", 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', 'not', 'slightly', 'soft', 'However', 'really', 'non-issue.Any', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'utterly', 'DELIGHTED', 'see', 'set', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'show', 'should', 'least', 'rent', 'will', 'win', 'over', 'charm.Note', 'pilot', 'episode', 'featured', 'four', 'Girls', 'gay', 'chef', 'gay', 'character', 'was', 'dropped', 'series', 'pilot', 'was', 'screened', 'obvious', 'character', 'too', 'similar', 'Dorothy', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'was', 'nice', 'thought', 'time', 'inter-character', 'chemistry', 'did', 'work', 'far', 'better']",N/A
