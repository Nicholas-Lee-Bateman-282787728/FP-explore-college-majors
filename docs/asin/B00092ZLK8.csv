900323,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00092ZLK8,Grady Harp,"[16, 19]","CRUTCH is a film you want to like: it feels honest, from the heart of the autobiography of writer/director/producer/actor Rob Moretti, and it aims to deliver a statement about the dangers of drug abuse and how to conquer it. The problems with this film are 1) it all has been said and shown before, 2) the camera work and editing are so inconsistent that they become intrusive, and 3) the actors selected to enact this downfall film are pretty much folks with good intentions but little finesse.  Obviously made on a very low budget with a group of people who appear committed to the project, it has everything we could want from an Indie except polish.David (Eben Gordon - unfortunately not resembling a 16-year-old boy he is supposed to be) is trying to hold together his fragile family of adulterous father Jack (James Early), an alcoholic self-destructive mother Katie (Juanita Walsh), and brother and sister.  Jack leaves the family for his paramour, Maryann is hospitalized for rehab after an injurious fall, the other siblings are copeless, and David attempts to escape reality by joining an acting class.  The acting teacher Kenny (Rob Moretti), accompanied by his close friend and confidant Maryann (Jennifer Katz), encourage David's young ability and despite wise Maryann's warnings, Kenny responds to his attraction to David.Out of need for order in his life David opens up his sexuality and becomes bonded with Kenny.  Kenny's hidden drug addiction is uncovered by David and David begins to use the coke and his downfall begins.  It is a love/hate relationship, David becoming the movie star Kenny's drug habit prevented.  And eventually David attempts to return to his family and girlfriend only to meet with disaster until in the final moments of the film we find David in a 12-step program. The ending summarizes how each of the characters' lives stand at the present via screen statements before the credits.As said before, the film cries to be loved but the technical aspects of its creation simply fall short of the much-needed chemistries that this inexperienced cast is unable to deliver.  It may be an example of the writer losing the necessary distance from the final product by being over-extended in the making of the film.
