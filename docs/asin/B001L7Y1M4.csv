If you are a UFO buff or just someone interested in hearing and seeing all the unexplained. Bill and his crew do the best job possible and travel the country and parts of the Globe to get you close up and personal accounts and they do their homework on getting the facts. I like Patrick is always logical and looking to disprove, well, he is a person who wants facts, not fantasy and Ted the producer I think does a wonderful job. Bill with his sunglasses and hat makes him an interesting character with his voice and that he never ceased to quit until he exhausts every avenue. But the interesting facts they come up with are what this show is all about. So, if you think you have ever seen something unusual in the skies or coming out of the ocean or want to know more about things like Area 51, you will love this series and want more. I myself can't get enough of this show. 2 thumbs up for the interesting topics they cover, the presentation and all the folks they get that are reputable. If you are still skeptical, watch some of the series on the History 2 channel on Friday nights and you'll get a taste of their series, you won't be disappointed.",5,UFO Hunters,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1188,"['love', 'show', 'series', 'are', 'UFO', 'buff', 'just', 'someone', 'interested', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'unexplained', 'Bill', 'crew', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'possible', 'travel', 'country', 'parts', 'Globe', 'get', 'close', 'up', 'personal', 'accounts', 'do', 'homework', 'getting', 'facts', 'Patrick', 'always', 'logical', 'looking', 'disprove', 'well', 'person', 'who', 'facts', 'not', 'fantasy', 'Ted', 'producer', 'think', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Bill', 'sunglasses', 'hat', 'interesting', 'character', 'voice', 'never', 'ceased', 'quit', 'avenue', 'interesting', 'facts', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'So', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'unusual', 'skies', 'coming', 'ocean', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'things', 'Area', '51', 'will', 'love', 'series', 'want', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'show', '2', 'thumbs', 'up', 'interesting', 'topics', 'cover', 'presentation', 'folks', 'get', 'are', 'reputable', 'are', 'still', 'skeptical', 'watch', 'series', 'History', '2', 'channel', 'Friday', 'nights', ""'ll"", 'get', 'taste', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",UFO Hunters: Season 2

You need not be an expert (I'm certainly not) to understand what they are showing you.  They go to all the actual locations and interview eye witnesses for first hand accounts.
