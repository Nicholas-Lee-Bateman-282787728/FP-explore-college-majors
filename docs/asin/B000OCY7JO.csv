Like a taste of Ireland's Guinness Beer, the movie makes a strong impression that leaves a long aftertaste.  Screenwriter Paul Laverty and Director Ken Loach take us to Ireland in 1920 when modern tensions met an apex.  Brothers Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Paddy (Padriac Delaney) form with others, working with the IRA and political group, Sein Finn, to bring Ireland to independence.  From the start a stark contrast is made between the simplicity of decent people living in thatched, stone houses and the palpable brutality of British forces reigning in the resistance of labor unions.  Once a young resident is killed for refusing to divulge his name in English, the wheel of violence starts rolling.  Underarmed and often divided, the men try to hold their own against the British through clever tactics and ambushes.  When they get England's attention, they can broker for peace on certain terms or take advantage for complete Irish sovereignty.  The discord amongst the two brothers is a study in the choice for peace and a compromise--or to fight all the way to independence.  Some of the best scenes show the Irish people divided, especially the quiet arguing between Damien and Paddy.  It's easy to see why with such meager resources and inner squabbling, the Irish resistance didn't succeed as well as Rob Roy or Michael Collins.With beautiful scenery, desperate violence that make the battle scenes seem all too real, and a fragile comraderie amongst truly wronged people, 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' harvests a rich viewing experience.(The recent peace agreement among the Nationalists and Loyalists in  Ireland is certainly heartening--the day after I saw this movie--even if the conflict in the movie is between the Irish and English.)",5,As Strong as a Pint of Guinness,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,1840,"[""'The"", 'Wind', 'Barley', 'transports', 'setting', 'few', 'movies', 'do', 'taste', 'Ireland', 'Guinness', 'Beer', 'movie', 'strong', 'impression', 'long', 'aftertaste', 'Screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Laverty', 'Director', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'take', 'Ireland', '1920', 'when', 'modern', 'tensions', 'met', 'apex', 'Brothers', 'Damien', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Paddy', 'Padriac', 'Delaney', 'form', 'others', 'working', 'IRA', 'political', 'group', 'Sein', 'Finn', 'bring', 'Ireland', 'independence', 'start', 'stark', 'contrast', 'made', 'simplicity', 'decent', 'people', 'living', 'thatched', 'stone', 'houses', 'palpable', 'brutality', 'British', 'forces', 'reigning', 'resistance', 'labor', 'unions', 'Once', 'young', 'resident', 'killed', 'refusing', 'divulge', 'name', 'English', 'wheel', 'violence', 'starts', 'rolling', 'Underarmed', 'often', 'divided', 'men', 'try', 'hold', 'own', 'British', 'clever', 'tactics', 'ambushes', 'When', 'get', 'England', 'attention', 'can', 'broker', 'peace', 'certain', 'terms', 'take', 'advantage', 'complete', 'Irish', 'sovereignty', 'discord', 'two', 'brothers', 'study', 'choice', 'peace', 'compromise', 'fight', 'way', 'independence', 'best', 'scenes', 'show', 'Irish', 'people', 'divided', 'especially', 'quiet', 'arguing', 'Damien', 'Paddy', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'such', 'meager', 'resources', 'inner', 'squabbling', 'Irish', 'resistance', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'Michael', 'Collins.With', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'desperate', 'violence', 'make', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seem', 'too', 'real', 'fragile', 'comraderie', 'amongst', 'truly', 'wronged', 'people', 'Wind', 'Barley', 'harvests', 'rich', 'viewing', 'experience', 'recent', 'peace', 'agreement', 'Nationalists', 'Loyalists', 'Ireland', 'certainly', 'heartening', 'day', 'saw', 'movie', 'even', 'conflict', 'movie', 'Irish', 'English']",N/A

It is the legacy left behind by a troubled people who were enslaved by British authorities to make them subservient to their rule no matter what it wound entail. It is the plight of the Irish people left homeless &#8230;driven from their modest cottages into trenches and later forced to flee from there as well. The Irish were forbidden to speak the Gaelic language and were punished for reading or writing. And were forced into starvation&#8230; with the guns pointed at their heads &#8230; but managed to survive the treachery and the butchery of the British solders. The Irish republican army was formed and the battle to free Ireland and take back their land from British was a turning point to live free or die for it's cause. You will really enjoy this film and reminds us of other cultures like the Jews & Blacks who were also enslaved and forced to flee their homeland as well.

Not a grand film, but it covers the bases of an Ireland that was going through the same angst as many countries were at that time, with bewildering poverty, arrogant wealth, and a sense of a people being forced to fight and for them it was at first an enemy from without, which made the decision to fight easier, and in the end not winning as much as they had hoped but taking a step in the right direction, but not for all.

Cillian Murphy plays Damien, an apolitical Irish student, planning to become a doctor in London, who after witnessing the English brutal repression of Irish independence, decides to join his brother in the armed struggle to liberate Ireland from the English yoke. Director Ken Loach is certainly not among the most fluid of filmmakers, his movie is sometimes didactic, but is also consistently informative and interesting (it certainly lead me to look more information about this historical period on the Internet). The beautiful actress Orla Fitzgerald, playing Murphy's girlfriend, adds to the movie's appeal. The movie ends in a sad note: when the terms of the peace fails to conform the more belligerent Irish republicans (who particularly objected to the required oath to the King), the civil war erupts, and it ends up putting (literally) brother against brother.

1063398,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000OCY7JO,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 8]","THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY is about on-par in the UK as the troubles the US has accepting its treatment of Native Americans. Mother England has calloused hands, and it's not all from hard work; some of it is from taking up arms against neighbors and suppressing democracy in favor of holding a death-grip on the finances of other countries. Which brings us to the formation of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and this film's point.Anyone with a working knowledge of history knows that northern and southern Ireland aren't exactly peaceful toward one another. And it isn't just about religion. Dating back to the 1920s and beyond, England flexed her mighty muscle over the Irish in order to keep a tight hold on its foreign provinces. The ""emerald island"" suffered incredible oppression and financial destitution at the hands of UK law and its enforcing military. This divided Ireland and its inhabitants on multiple levels. Peace versus non-oppression. Catholic versus Protestant. The rich versus the poor. It is an incredibly complex situation.What this film does it put the perspective entirely on the IRA and why they became a force to be reckoned with. The story it surrounds is basically a microcosmic study which focuses on Damien (Cillian Murphy,Breakfast on Pluto), a student off to medical school but pulled up short by the atrocities he witnesses from English troops on Irish men, women, and children.Damien's brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is already an IRA member when the film begins, and Damien's transition into their ranks is easily done. Teddy is a higher-up in the IRA and Damien is seen as second-in-command. The difficulties Damien has in turning from healing doctor-to-be, to that of a war-hardened killer are excellently filmed. The love between Damien and his brother is fraught with peril as the two eventually find themselves on opposite sides after the ratification of a peace treaty. Damien's descent into questionable morals (enabled by his brother) are handled very well by director Ken Loach who has an eye for panoramic vistas littered with fields of barley.The barley is important to the film if a bit too obscure for most watchers. The title implies a 19th century poem by Robert D. Joyce in which young men fighting for Irish independence in 1798 would carry barley strands in their pockets. When they were killed, their bodies were buried and from there a barley patch would later emerge. With all of the barley sprouts visible around Ireland, there's little doubt how many young men died.Although pretty lopsided as far as historical recountings go, the story of a young man's dedication to his country, his brother, and his own damaged morality are something rarely seen in a short 127 minute film. Most of the time it would take years of filming documentary material to get this sense across to an audience. But The Wind That Shakes The Barley really does shake up the watcher.

It was well done, by an all Irish cast, filmed on location, or close to it, and fairly true to history for a piece of fiction. The brutality and the bitterness of the conflict are done realistically, although the violence is not glorified. Nonetheless, I found parts of the film rather dry, and it was longer than it needed to be. That detracted from my emotional involvement with the characters.The story is a good one, and the ending left me depressed. If you had relatives that lived through ""the troubles"" who were reluctant to talk about those times, you might find a degree of understanding in this story.

Under British troops they were tortured for minor infractions to the government or the local sergeant. Rights we take for granted like assembly and freedom of speech were acts of treason for the Irish. This shows how troops tortured and killed citizens and the Irish rebellion that followed. When they win some rights they split into two factions. One that is willing to settle with having there own court and army but under British rule, and one that doesnt beleive they are free until they are not ruled by Britain. The conversation scenes where they discuss the laws and politics are compelling.This is not for the feint of heart but for those that enjoy heartwrenching stories like ""Gallipoli"". I appreciated the brutal honesty but unlike Gallipoli I don't think I could re-watch this one. This is not an entertaining movie, but an excellent drama. However, I doubt I will watch it again so I give it low marks on replayability except to the strongest drama fans. I say that with the greatest respect to the makers of this movie. I just can't take a steady diet of this kind of gripping drama and heartache. They did their job to well.

1063407,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000OCY7JO,C. O. DeRiemer,"[249, 260]","Ireland in the early Twenties exploded into armed rebellion against the British. Two brothers at first made opposite decisions. A group of Black and Tan British soldiers arrive at a farm where the brothers and a group of other young men are resting after a hurling game (something like field hockey). The British terrorize everyone there, the men, the women, the aged and the young. They beat and kill one man for refusing to give his name in English. When they roar off, one brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), immediately helps form the men into armed resistors. Damien (Cillian Murphy), a medical student, decides to go on to London to a prestigious medical school where he is enrolled to finish his studies. At the train station he witnesses another group of soldiers attack and beat the train's conductor and engineer. The attacks are filled with screams and rifle butts. Damien returns to the village and joins the armed resistors.From then on we're in the middle of a rag-tag guerilla war, driven by a stern sense of justice and a determination to force the British out of Ireland. The British use wide-spread intimidation, brutality, imprisonment and executions by courts martial. Some of the men we've met die, British soldiers die, hostages die, traitors die, a young friend of Damien's who gave information is executed by Damien. He slowly moves from a reluctant fighter to a man who has become single-minded in what he does. When a truce is declared and a peace treaty is finally agreed upon in 1922 between the British Government and Sinn Fein, the stark reality of compromise splits the fighters. On the one hand, there will be an Irish Free State with British troops withdrawn. On the other hand, it will be a member of the British Commonwealth, an oath of allegiance to the British crown will be required and Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of Britain. Is this what we fought for...to give allegiance to the British, many ask? What we fought for was independence and in most regards we have it, say others. Ireland must be whole, say some. If we don't agree the British will flood the island with their troops, say others. We watch a civil war begin, with Irishmen taking up arms and killing each other. For the brothers, who once fought the British together, it means a crucial split. One fights to put down the rebellion against the newly independent Irish state, the other vows to fight until all Ireland is completely free.One critic of the film said that ""there isn't much nuance to either side."" That's probably because, nurtured by terrible actions and long memories, there wasn't much nuance in real life. The Wind That Shapes the Barley is a sad, powerful and emotional film. It doesn't shy away from the brutality and torture by British soldiers or the ruthlessness of the armed response. Most of all, we come face to face with both the courage and the grime needed by the Irish to finally, after centuries of ruthless, condescending oppression, rid most of the island of the British. The acting is uniformly persuasive, especially by Murphy and Delaney as the two brothers. Cillian Murphy, in particular gives a subtle and mesmerizing performance. The brothers' fate may not be tragic but it is so sad it makes you reflect on what you've seen. That's not a bad thing. Each brother in his own way pays for the choices he makes.And the title? It's from a 19th Century poem that tells of a young Irish boy who soon will leave his sweetheart to join others fighting the English in the 1798 rebellion. They would carry barley in their pockets as provisions on the march. When they were slain and their bodies pitched into unmarked mass graves by the English, from their bodies the sprouting barley came to symbolise that Irish resistance to the British would never die.I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true loveMy sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new loveThe old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearlyWhile soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound usBut harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around usAnd so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning earlyAnd join the bold united men,"" while soft winds shake the barleyWhile sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flingingA yeoman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringingA bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so earlyAnd on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barleyI bore her to some mountain stream, and many's the summer blossomI placed with branches soft and green about her gore-stained bosomI wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse then rushed o'er vale and valleyMy vengeance on the foe to wreak while soft wind shook the barleyBut blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart HollowAnd laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may followAs round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning earlyWith breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley.",4,"A brutal, sad, powerful film of the Irish rebellion against the British, and the

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[0, 0]","Except here the occupied are Catholic rather than Muslim, and agricultural products for hungry London is the object rather than petroleum.If the official Church documents and proclamations cannot convince you, this movie alone demonstrates clearly, if rather more gently than the actual brutal history, why no Catholic can now ally themselves in any way with British imperial interests in Iraq.And yet we find reviews here which find this movie both too slow and too violent. Turn on the excellent commentary to accompany you if you find it builds slowly (that opening hurling match is slow?); read your history. The truth was far more brutal, the torture of the Irish by the British over centuries, the sacking of the homes, the murder and mutilation of millions, the destruction of language, culture, religion, a nation.For us Catholics, we are invited to compare and contrast the spectrum of pastoral care presented in this film with historical accuracy. One priest who gives the boys the Sacraments in a hidden barn is an old hedgerow priest from the days when the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass could only be celebrated in hidden ditches because of the brutal religious oppression and the blood of many unknown martyrs for our Faith from the time of Oliver Cromwell (who slaughtered us in the name of his Lord) until one hundred years ago (and still in the unfree Orangeman county of Belfast).Another priest, under the auspices of the British Empire, bedecked in historically accurate liturgical robes, in a gleamingly appointed Church, etc., scolds and roars at his congregation to swear allegiance to the British crown which oppresses them, under the pain of excommunication, making the Church &#34;irrelevant&#34; and even enemy of their real lives under imperial oppression, allying the heirarchy with the Empire which starves, tortures, mutilates, masacres and robs them. Such dichotomy in pastoral theology remains in force throughout our Church, although the beloved and blessed hedgerow priests grow fewer and harder to find, and their memory more dear.Think of Iraq and realize what our media reveals is indeed very mild compared to the reality on the ground of our colonialist military occupation. And realize what a horror our participation in that British imperialist aggression must be for our American founders who fought for our freedom from the same British colonial oppression.And for our Irish grandfathers.Certainly we may point to slight quarrels with the acting, slightly weak at points, and at the mild representation of what in reality occurred, but this movie must be seen by every American as a parable to our present times and what we ourselves have become: mercenaries of the Empire.See this great film. Know your history. Work for peace and true freedom. Sure there are some plot holes you could drive a lorry through: A boy from Cork going to London to study medicine in the times of the oppression and after the Great War? Did the squadron of British troops assigned to Ireland after the Great War ever get on that train? Wouldn't the troops have raped that young woman instead of just giving her a haircut (but think of the British wrtier and director and production here and their own slant)?

It hardly needs to be said that this is a recent and contentious subject on which many people have very strong feelings.The filmaker, Ken Loach, is an extreme left wing British intellectual who, like Noam Chomsky in the US, directs all his energy to one and only one goal; showing how contemptible he believes his own country to be (as well as Israel, the US, the Power Structure, Capitalism, etc.) The film has high production values - enthralling images of the Irish countryside, convincing period looks - but is simplistic in its interpretation of history, bordering on propaganda. The violence seems put there to inflame the audience against the British, who are portrayed as Nazi-like thugs brutalizing Irish civilians and torturing prisoners. How can we be sure these incidents really happened? So one-sided are Loach's sympathies that the film implies the Irish population was 100% on the side of the IRA, which was hardly the case. And you could watch the whole movie without being aware there were any Protestants in Ireland.The movie does not lead to any resolution but simply ends after one particularly tragic incident. Except for the courage of the Irish fighters, there is little development here at all, just atrocity piled upon atrocity. Are artists allowed to take sides? Of course they are. And most Americans including myself sympathize with Irish Catholics as an oppressed minority. But this movie is over the top. You could make a similar film about Palestinians, completely ignoring the Israeli side, or about Al-Queda, completely ignoring the American side. Osama bin Laden also says that he is driving the occupiers from his lands. ""One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.""Loach, who is not as smart as Noam Chomsky, is so self-righteous that he does not seem to realize he has portrayed his own heroes, the IRA fighters, as fanatical absolutists who will execute their own brothers over family political disagreements or shoot a 17 year old kid from the neighborhood because he was coerced into informing. This is how left wing partisans justify morphing into murderous terrorists, which is exactly what happened to the IRA as the 1920's became the 1960's.I ended up wanting to learn more about Ireland's tragic history, and with memories of its beautiful countryside.

The movie is  beautiful cinematically and the acting very convincing, although I did think Cillian Murphy somewhat miscast as Damien, the young doctor who is reluctantly converted to the IRA cause by the British brutality he witnesses.  However, overall I found the movie disappointing for somewhat the same reasons as reviewer Pouliot.  If the viewer does not have a pretty good background in Irish history, especially of the 1910-1922 years, he is likely to have difficulty understanding what is going on and why.  The film is narrowed so sharply to one small group of guerilla fighters in Cork County that I don't know how an average viewer could put the action in perspective with the 1916 Easter rebellion, the nationwide struggle going on, the direction and control being exercised by IRA leaders in Dublin and the overall scope of the fight against the British. The biggest plus of this film, to my mind, and it is a very big plus, is that it shows graphically the kind of savagery being engaged in by the British soldiers (the ""black and tans"" who were sent in to support the regular British forces in Ireland) and the galvanizing effect it had on the Irish populace.  It also shows the tragedy that befell Ireland when the independence movement came apart after the Treaty was signed and the die-hard Republicans refused to support the new Irish Free State, feeling that it was a sell-out to accept anything but complete freedom for the whole island. The movie does a good job of showing how the two sides could differ so drastically and still each have legitimate reasons for taking the stance they did. It also drives home how devastating the Civil War was in the final wrenching scenes of what devotion to their beliefs cost the two brothers.  This was certainly a singularly Irish story, as another reviewer said, and it leaves you feeling very melancholy to realize what their independence ultimately brought the Irish, i.e., families torn apart forever, scars much deeper than any the British left and a shadow that hangs over the land even today.

His brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After the treaty with England Damien and Teddy find themselves on opposite sides. Damien joins the Anti-Treaty IRA and Teddy joins the Irish Army as the Irish Civil War begins.This is a heartfelt and beautifully shot film dealing with the difficult choices that people make, and how people with even the same goals in sight see differing means to that end, and how this can lead to devastating decisions.",4,The divisions of war,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,967,"['Wind', 'Barley', '2006', 'powerful', 'film', 'British', 'oppression', 'Irish', 'people', 'shortly', 'WWI', 'film', '1920', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'eventually', 'find', 'fighting', 'same', 'battle', 'different', 'sides.Damien', ""O'Donovan"", 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'young', 'doctor', 'leave', 'England', 'seeing', 'beating', 'railway', 'guard', 'stay', 'join', 'resistance', 'brother', 'Teddy', 'Padraic', 'Delaney', 'local', 'flying', 'column', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'treaty', 'England', 'Damien', 'Teddy', 'find', 'opposite', 'sides', 'Damien', 'Anti-Treaty', 'IRA', 'Teddy', 'Irish', 'Army', 'Irish', 'Civil', 'War', 'begins.This', 'heartfelt', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'dealing', 'difficult', 'choices', 'people', 'make', 'how', 'people', 'even', 'same', 'goals', 'sight', 'see', 'differing', 'means', 'end', 'how', 'can', 'lead', 'devastating', 'decisions']",N/A

1063431,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000OCY7JO,Jean E. Pouliot,"[12, 28]","The struggle for Ireland to be free of British control has been going on for an awfully long time. I do not pretend to be conversant or even barely knowledgeable of its twists, turns, reversals and rekindlings. This movie attempts to depict the events from about 1920 to 1922 through the eyes of a small band of IRA men and women.In truth, the movie is less a historical depiction than a condensation - almost to the point of allegory - of the issues that gripped the country during this period. The film does this by focusing on a pair of brothers - Damien and Teddy Donovan. As the film starts, Damien is planning to travel to England for his medical training. But the brutality of the British ""Black and Tans"" soon radicalizes him, and he joins with his brother to drive out the English and restore native rule to his land. After the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921, found unacceptable by some for not completely ridding Ireland of the Brits, the former fighters find themselves fighting each other. Teddy accepts the treaty and joins the Irish homeland army while Damien opposes the treaty, setting the stage for tragedy.The filmmakers made some interesting, curious, and not altogether successful choices. By focusing on a relatively small part of the country, and a very small number of actors, they made the story more manageable, but also robbed it of its context. We see exactly one starving child and are told (not shown) that there are tens of thousands more. The same family homestead is attacked over and over, almost to the point of ludicrousness. Also, the filmmakers decided to let their actors speak in a brogue so thick that I did not realize that Teddy and Damien were brothers until well into the second half of the film. My teenage son never perceived this crucial fact until after the film was over. The decision to let the actors adlib some of their lines should have lent verisimilitude to the angry exchanges that peppered the film. But listening to the actors stumble over their lines was a distraction, not a way to increase the sense of reality. And unless one was minimally conversant with the personalities and facts around Ireland's struggle for independence, many of the scenes did not make sense.There was a curious languor about the film - a lack of passion that should have inhabited its core. In an example scene, a priest at Mass is angrily urging his parishioners to accept the peace treaty, threatening excommunication upon those who refuse. Damien ""angrily"" talks back to his pastor, and walks out of Mass accompanied by a dozen or more of his supporters. But they move away from church like they are on a summer walk, with their fires completely banked, their challenge to the [...] of the Church making barely an emotional ripple. Not enough was done to set a historical context for the existence of British soldiers in Ireland. Sure, the Black and Tans were nasty, but what were they doing in Ireland in the first place?The film did do some good. For those (like me) who do not understand the Irish war and the origin of the IRA, this film provided basic information and made me somewhat sympathetic to these men and women who wanted to be rid of foreign occupiers. The lighting was superb, capturing the gloomy dankness of a prison cell and the crepuscular lighting of a pre-dawn attack. The violence was especially well-done, almost too much to watch in parts. The film also has to be lauded for attempting to portray the bind that so many Irish found themselves in - conflicted over whether to accept an imperfect peace, or to launch a bloody and unending civil war until compete independence was achieved.Taken as a whole, ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" is a noble failure - a film that could not capture the large-scale story and left too much passion out of its small-scale facsimile. But perhaps that's a function of the missing dialog.

The IRA was a ragtag band of farm boys and local townsmen who, enraged by the appearance of the British Black and Tans in their country, decide that independence for Ireland is going to be a fight to the death. The British used cruel paramilitary tactics to try to suppress the rebellion, which did more to undermine their moral authority than anything else. The film depicts the futility of military tactics to subdue a people defending their own land.  A political solution, though not a cure all, as we know from history, was the only answer.Teddy O'Donnell unsuccessfully tries to draw his doctor brother Damien into the struggle. But Damien abandons his intention to take a job at a prestigious London hospital as he witnesses an act of violence on the platform of the train he's about to depart on.  The brothers lead a band of guerillas harassing the British at every turn; exhausted by the fight, a Truce is finally declared by the British. But there's no redeeming end to this story for many years, as we all know. The Truce was the beginning of a fierce civil war, that has tragic consequences for the brothers and has had terrible consequences for Ireland for decades.Shot on location, primarily in County Cork, the film doesn't romanticize the countryside or the people. The land is rainy and foggy and cloudy; the farms are poor. The interiors are cramped, smoky and dark. The film has a gritty, realistic quality, to match the grim story.

I was looking for a film that wasn't ""The Quiet Man"" to celebrate my lineage. I was thinking of ""Michael Collins,"" a good, solid film covering the same time period as this film.While re-visiting the reviews of ""Michael Collins"" a reviewer suggested renting ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" instead. I didn't even know the film existed so I rented it online from Amazon.I was held completely in sway for all 2.07 hours of it. What ""Michael Collins"" attempts to explain, ""...Barley"" simply, movingly, showed with the interwoven story of two brothers gripped in the whirlwind of a country attempting to throw off the shackles of 700 years of occupation and oppression. Only to wind up in civil war. Like any drama involving a civil war, the analogy of two brothers who wind up on opposite sides of the conflict is cliche.But this story is so directly and straight forwardly told, the acting so natural and unadorned, that the complex politics and history of Irish history is emotionally gripping. There are no big name Hollywood stars here. There are few folks who look like the local gentry. It is unmistakably Ireland (county Cork.) But it achieves the nearly impossible - as the viewer, you understand what multiple episodes of ""Biography"" and umpteenth readings of Wikipedia can't tell you. You don't need ""Ireland for Dummies"" to understand the conflict. It's all on the screen.It grabs you by the throat, with a knock to heart, and by the end you'll have tears in your eyes. To think, nearly 90 years later, the fallout from that armistice and treaty that tore the country apart is still alive. The ""troubles"" never went away.

THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY takes place during the later days of the Irish Rebellion of 1916-1921, when the British adopted (or readopted) their time-tested policy to utterly subjugate the Irish. Gaelic publications were suppressed; meetings (of any sort) were banned; half-trained criminal mercenaries recruited from British jails were given khaki uniforms and black berets, truncheons and guns, and let loose with little restriction, becoming known as the infamous Black and Tans.Damien (Cillian Murphy) is a young Irish doctor headed to London to complete his medical education. His life's course is changed when he becomes witness to anti-Irish atrocities. Putting aside his plans, he joins the Irish Republican cause.THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY captures its era and atmosphere perfectly. Having been raised by one who was there, I will attest to its accuracy. The glorious beauty of the Irish countryside is (as it was) a jarringly incongruous backdrop to the horrors depicted onscreen.This film is a searing chronicle. Young Irish men of good breeding and kindly ways are transformed into the denizens of a partisan army that gives no quarter and asks none.This film pulls no punches in its realism. Particularly grotesque is a sequence in which the Black and Tans yank out a young rebel's fingernails with a rusty pliers. Other sequences are less graphic but more troubling, as when the rebel force has to execute one of its own for inadvertently disclosing their plans to the British authorities. The heartbreak of the act is palpable.Worst of all is the schism that develops between the Free State forces and the Anti-Treaty forces in 1921. Ireland was partitioned into north and south. The south (the ""Free State"") was granted a limited form of self-government under the British Crown, while the north remained (and still remains) an integral part of the United Kingdom.The issue of whether to accept the Free State and partition or to continue fighting for a fully free unified Ireland split the country, and caused a bitter rift between people who had been fighting alongside each other only days before. Brothers and bloodsworn friends become each others' mutual murderers in the dark days of the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) which grew directly out of the War of Independence. Anti-Treaty advocates were hunted down and executed. The Irish Church excommunicated them. Many were forced to leave Ireland or face ostracism (at the least). Damien is caught up in this vortex, a storm which was ridden out by the Free State (the Republicans laid down their arms but never surrendered or formally renounced their goals).This exemplary film captures a moment in time in a crystal and preserves it with all its roiling emotion, joy, terror, sorrow and grandness.",4,"""T'was hard the woeful words to frame; to break the ties that bound us.""",1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,3067,"['history', 'Ireland', 'long', 'lamentable', 'catalogue', 'abuses', 'indigenous', 'population', 'occupying', 'power', 'catalogue', 'rapine', 'pillage', 'exploitation', 'expropriation', 'denuding', 'culture', 'religion', 'language', 'Irish', 'English', 'rulers', 'WIND', 'THAT', 'SHAKES', 'BARLEY', 'place', 'later', 'days', 'Irish', 'Rebellion', '1916-1921', 'when', 'British', 'adopted', 'readopted', 'time-tested', 'policy', 'utterly', 'subjugate', 'Irish', 'Gaelic', 'publications', 'were', 'suppressed', 'meetings', 'sort', 'were', 'banned', 'half-trained', 'criminal', 'mercenaries', 'recruited', 'British', 'jails', 'were', 'given', 'khaki', 'uniforms', 'black', 'berets', 'truncheons', 'guns', 'let', 'loose', 'little', 'restriction', 'becoming', 'known', 'infamous', 'Black', 'Tans.Damien', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'young', 'Irish', 'doctor', 'headed', 'London', 'complete', 'medical', 'education', 'life', 'course', 'changed', 'when', 'witness', 'anti-Irish', 'atrocities', 'Putting', 'aside', 'plans', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'cause.THE', 'WIND', 'THAT', 'SHAKES', 'BARLEY', 'era', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'Having', 'been', 'raised', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'will', 'attest', 'accuracy', 'glorious', 'beauty', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'was', 'jarringly', 'incongruous', 'backdrop', 'horrors', 'depicted', 'onscreen.This', 'film', 'searing', 'chronicle', 'Young', 'Irish', 'men', 'good', 'breeding', 'kindly', 'ways', 'are', 'transformed', 'denizens', 'partisan', 'army', 'quarter', 'none.This', 'film', 'punches', 'realism', 'Particularly', 'grotesque', 'sequence', 'Black', 'Tans', 'out', 'young', 'rebel', 'fingernails', 'rusty', 'pliers', 'Other', 'sequences', 'are', 'less', 'graphic', 'more', 'troubling', 'when', 'rebel', 'force', 'execute', 'one', 'own', 'inadvertently', 'disclosing', 'plans', 'British', 'authorities', 'heartbreak', 'act', 'palpable.Worst', 'schism', 'Free', 'State', 'forces', 'Anti-Treaty', 'forces', '1921', 'Ireland', 'was', 'partitioned', 'north', 'south', 'south', 'Free', 'State', 'was', 'granted', 'limited', 'form', 'self-government', 'British', 'Crown', 'north', 'remained', 'still', 'integral', 'part', 'United', 'Kingdom.The', 'issue', 'accept', 'Free', 'State', 'partition', 'continue', 'fighting', 'fully', 'free', 'unified', 'Ireland', 'split', 'country', 'caused', 'bitter', 'rift', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'fighting', 'alongside', 'other', 'only', 'days', 'Brothers', 'bloodsworn', 'friends', 'become', 'others', 'mutual', 'murderers', 'dark', 'days', 'Irish', 'Civil', 'War', '1922-1923', 'grew', 'directly', 'War', 'Independence', 'Anti-Treaty', 'advocates', 'were', 'hunted', 'down', 'executed', 'Irish', 'Church', 'excommunicated', 'Many', 'were', 'forced', 'leave', 'Ireland', 'face', 'ostracism', 'least', 'Damien', 'caught', 'up', 'vortex', 'storm', 'was', 'ridden', 'out', 'Free', 'State', 'Republicans', 'laid', 'down', 'arms', 'never', 'surrendered', 'formally', 'renounced', 'goals', '.This', 'exemplary', 'film', 'moment', 'time', 'crystal', 'roiling', 'emotion', 'joy', 'terror', 'sorrow', 'grandness']",N/A

My own  parents could well have been among the characters in it.  It is set in 1920-1922 in West Cork, around Ballingeary, not so far from my mother's home.  Indeed, my parents played their own roles in these events, my father in the IRA and my mother as a messenger (just like the several children that appear throughout).The early scenes of the movie, of the casual and brutal violence of the Black and Tans, were for me the visualization of stories I have heard from my childhood.  People I knew in my youthful visits to Ireland were among the victims.  But it is hard for someone born in the US to really grasp how terrifying it must have been.  This movie certainly does it well.It also does a good job of cataloging the ways in which kindly disposed young men could be driven to become guerrilla fighters who, in their turn, became efficient killers.I think the movie is better in presenting the early part of the story.  It breaks down somewhat in dealing with the Treaty and the Civil War.

1063453,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000OCY7JO,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[63, 72]","""The Wind that Shakes the Barley,"" (from an old Irish revolutionary song) Ken Loach's uncompromising, tragic film begins in chaos: a group of young Irish men are playing a rough and tumble game of hurling while the referee yells and threatens to stop the game or eject one player or another out of the game. It's all very testosterone fueled: men at play, having fun, taking it all too seriously. In the next scene, these same men arrive at a shocking scene at the home of one of them: English Black and Tans (the occupying soldiers sent from England to stamp out the crackling embers of Irish independence), thuggish and cruel and intent on demeaning the Irish, are taunting a house of women and upon spying the young men with hurling sticks, the B&T;'s demand that they stand up against the house and give their names in English (not Gaelic). One man refuses to speak English. He is killed.And so begins this shocking, mesmerizing film about a County Cork rebellion against the British, circa 1920-1922 and zeroes in on two brothers Damien (a sensitive, intelligent, driven Cillian Murphy of ""28 Days Later""), trained as a doctor who feels that, instead of pursuing his life long dream of working in London, chooses instead to stay home and fight the good fight. Damien's brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney in a fueled-by-fire performance...his first movie), a big man strangling under the iron grip of the British. The Cain and Abel story is recalled here as it is in a number of Motion Pictures including ""East of Eden,"" as Damien and Teddy eventually have a moral and political parting of the ways and find themselves on opposite sides of the Anglo Irish Treaty of 1920.Loach's films are all about making the political personal and the personal political and ""TWTSTB"" is no exception. Cillian Murphy is the perfect choice to play Damien: he is a good son and caring brother, he does the right thing, he is inextricably caught up in a David versus Goliath war who emotionally shouts at a particularly terrifying juncture in the film: ""I hope this Ireland we're fighting for is worth it."" Murphy's heartfelt and emotional characterization of a man who has dedicated his life to saving others but who kills in the name of his beliefs, until he finds himself impossibly torn between patriotic oaths and blood ties forms the moral core of this film.Loach is painting on a large canvas here as this subject matter requires but his artist's palette is muted by the many gallons of blood and the many buckets of guts spilled by both the Irish and the British in this rebellion. ""Barley"" has the soul of an anti-war movie and the style of a thriller.There are no winners here, no good people or bad people, there is logic on both sides of this war...that's the tragic dilemma.",5,Brother against Brother,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2768,"['Wind', 'Barley', 'old', 'Irish', 'revolutionary', 'song', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'uncompromising', 'tragic', 'film', 'begins', 'chaos', 'group', 'young', 'Irish', 'men', 'are', 'playing', 'rough', 'tumble', 'game', 'hurling', 'referee', 'yells', 'stop', 'game', 'eject', 'one', 'player', 'game', 'very', 'testosterone', 'fueled', 'men', 'play', 'having', 'fun', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'next', 'scene', 'same', 'men', 'arrive', 'shocking', 'scene', 'home', 'one', 'English', 'Black', 'Tans', 'occupying', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'England', 'stamp', 'out', 'crackling', 'embers', 'Irish', 'independence', 'thuggish', 'cruel', 'intent', 'demeaning', 'Irish', 'are', 'taunting', 'house', 'women', 'spying', 'young', 'men', 'hurling', 'sticks', 'B', 'T', 'demand', 'stand', 'up', 'house', 'give', 'names', 'English', 'not', 'Gaelic', 'One', 'man', 'speak', 'English', 'killed.And', 'so', 'shocking', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'County', 'Cork', 'rebellion', 'British', 'circa', '1920-1922', 'zeroes', 'two', 'brothers', 'Damien', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'driven', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'trained', 'doctor', 'who', 'instead', 'pursuing', 'life', 'long', 'dream', 'working', 'London', 'instead', 'stay', 'home', 'fight', 'good', 'fight', 'Damien', 'brother', 'Teddy', 'Padraic', 'Delaney', 'fueled-by-fire', 'performance', 'first', 'movie', 'big', 'man', 'strangling', 'iron', 'grip', 'British', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'story', 'recalled', 'here', 'number', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'including', 'East', 'Eden', 'Damien', 'Teddy', 'eventually', 'have', 'moral', 'political', 'parting', 'ways', 'find', 'opposite', 'sides', 'Anglo', 'Irish', 'Treaty', '1920.Loach', 'films', 'are', 'making', 'political', 'personal', 'personal', 'political', 'TWTSTB', 'exception', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Damien', 'good', 'son', 'caring', 'brother', 'right', 'thing', 'inextricably', 'caught', 'up', 'David', 'versus', 'Goliath', 'war', 'who', 'emotionally', 'particularly', 'terrifying', 'juncture', 'film', 'hope', 'Ireland', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'worth', 'Murphy', 'heartfelt', 'emotional', 'characterization', 'man', 'who', 'dedicated', 'life', 'saving', 'others', 'who', 'name', 'beliefs', 'impossibly', 'torn', 'patriotic', 'oaths', 'blood', 'ties', 'moral', 'core', 'film.Loach', 'painting', 'large', 'canvas', 'here', 'subject', 'matter', 'artist', 'palette', 'muted', 'many', 'gallons', 'blood', 'many', 'buckets', 'guts', 'spilled', 'Irish', 'British', 'rebellion', 'Barley', 'soul', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'style', 'are', 'winners', 'here', 'good', 'people', 'bad', 'people', 'logic', 'sides', 'war', 'tragic', 'dilemma']",N/A

It took home the Palme D'Or in 2006 at the Cannes Film Festival and deservedly so.Loach tells a sympathetic and political tale of war and the birth of the I.R.A through two brothers Damien played by Cillian Murphy who is solid in pretty much every film I have seen him in and Teddy played by Padraic Delaney who equals Murphy's performance with a great one of his own.  Damien a med school graduate headed to a London hospital to further his training decides against it after witnessing one to many atrocities on his people at the hands of the British Black and Tan soldiers and joins a guerrilla squad of the Irish Republican Army headed by his brother Teddy to fight and prevent such atrocities.Above everything I found this to be a political film and doesn't go into the brothers relationship in any detail although there are some powerful and painful moments between them that could bring tears to your eyes.  Also there facial expressions and looks in there eyes say a lot which can be attributed to powerful performances and great acting all around.Even a love interest between Damien and a strong willed Sinead is still a backdrop for there political cause which they share an equally strong if not greater love for, there real passion in this film is the cause they fight for.A truce is declared but with of course many unacceptable terms as seen by Damien.  And  seen as a victory and a stepping stone to greater things as seen by Teddy, which inevitably divides the Irish against there own people and brother against brother.I rented this film from Netflix but will now be purchasing, It is a good add to any film collection at a fair price and highly recommended, this is one of the best of 2007 I have seen so far.Thanks for reading.",5,4.5 Stars.

1063456,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000OCY7JO,mirasreviews,"[6, 8]","Director Ken Loach trains his signature ""social realism"" on the Republic of Ireland's turbulent formative years in ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"", which follows the Irish War of Independence and subsequent Civil War in the early 1920s through the experiences of two brothers, Damien and Teddy. Damien (Cillian Murphy) is a medical student looking forward to completing his studies in London. Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is committed to the Irish Republican Army's fight for Ireland's independence from British rule. When a young friend is murdered by the brutal ""Black and Tan"" military police, Damien decides he must stay and fight. He joins Teddy in one of the IRA's flying column guerilla units, immersing himself in a very dirty war.Barry Ackroyd's photography of the lovely Irish countryside makes a strong impression. The rest of the film is superficial in comparison. It doesn't delve into political complexities. The circumstances are what they are at any given moment, and characters react accordingly. But we never get to know the characters enough to understand their motives. Why does someone give up a comfortable life with a person he loves to oppose the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, when neither he nor his family are personally threatened by it? There must be a reason. These characters are distant and elusive. The script seems insufficient to support the implied gravity. But I think the greater fault lies in a directing style that continually creates separation between the viewer and the characters. ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" isn't a bad film, but it's inconsequential.The DVD (IFC 2007): There is a theatrical trailer, a featurette about Ken Loach, and an audio commentary. ""Carry On Ken: A Look at the Work of Director Ken Loach"" (48 min) discusses Ken Loach's directing style, humor, character, and career through interviews with the director himself and many artists who have worked with him. The audio commentary is by Ken Loach and historical advisor Donal O'Driscoll. The commentary is not continuous and does not provide a background or great detail of the Irish-British conflict. But it does add some useful explanations, and Loach contributes his recollections about filming the movie.

I doubt you'll ever have the same views about the IRA after watching this film -- let alone American independence by comparison. The poetry of this film lays in the opening and closing scenes, in which the persecuted have been divided and made to commit the same atrocities against their fellow patriots. The oath that the rebels swear to protect their country is almost verbatim the oath that Americans take as members of the Armed Forces. So, for an American viewing this film, I think it becomes easy to associate our country with the rebels, as we basically exercise the freedoms that the IRA demands for Ireland. For this reason, I think it becomes much easier for people struggling for independence at varying levels to identify with this film, which Loach manages to portray as if he's recovered reels of documentary footage packed with all of the intensity and emotional intimacy that comes with really being there -- a monumental achievement for a filmmaker.

The film does a particularly good job of depicting the rural Ireland of the 1920s' poor, isolated, in some respects almost preindustrial, and deeply Catholic.  Against this background, The Wind... is the story of 2 brothers who join the IRA after witnessing the brutal behavior of the Black and Tans, paramilitaries used by the British government to suppress the rebellion.  Loach shows the vicious nature of guerilla war and attempted suppression unsparingly, with stark scenes of torture, ambush, and execution.  The film reaches a tragic climax in the civil war that followed the treaty with Britain.  The two brothers line up on opposite sides of the pro- and anti-treaty divide with fatal consequences.Very well filmed, extremely well acted, and written well, this is a serious and successful attempt to understand and describe an important historical event.That said, this film has a couple of probably unavoidable drawbacks.  The viewers who will get the most out of this film will be those with some knowledge of the period.  Loach's close focus on the experiences of a small group of men and women gives this film powerful intensity but it sacrifices some important context.  For example, the film does a very good job of showing how the brutal behavior of British paramilitaries radicalized many Irish but it does not show the fact that IRA radicals initiated violent activities with the intention of provoking British suppression in the successful hope of producing a radicalizing conflict.",4,Very Good,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,1663,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'post-WWI', 'Irish', 'revolt', 'British', 'rule', 'civil', 'war', 'followed', 'formation', 'Irish', 'Free', 'State', 'film', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'rural', 'Ireland', '1920s', 'poor', 'isolated', 'respects', 'almost', 'preindustrial', 'deeply', 'Catholic', 'Against', 'background', 'Wind', 'story', '2', 'brothers', 'who', 'join', 'IRA', 'witnessing', 'brutal', 'behavior', 'Black', 'Tans', 'paramilitaries', 'used', 'British', 'government', 'suppress', 'rebellion', 'Loach', 'vicious', 'nature', 'guerilla', 'war', 'attempted', 'suppression', 'unsparingly', 'stark', 'scenes', 'torture', 'ambush', 'execution', 'film', 'tragic', 'climax', 'civil', 'war', 'followed', 'treaty', 'Britain', 'two', 'brothers', 'line', 'up', 'opposite', 'sides', 'pro-', 'anti-treaty', 'divide', 'fatal', 'consequences.Very', 'well', 'filmed', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'well', 'serious', 'successful', 'attempt', 'understand', 'describe', 'important', 'historical', 'event.That', 'said', 'film', 'couple', 'probably', 'unavoidable', 'drawbacks', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'knowledge', 'period', 'Loach', 'close', 'focus', 'experiences', 'small', 'group', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'powerful', 'intensity', 'important', 'context', 'example', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'brutal', 'behavior', 'British', 'paramilitaries', 'radicalized', 'many', 'Irish', 'not', 'show', 'fact', 'IRA', 'radicals', 'initiated', 'violent', 'activities', 'intention', 'provoking', 'British', 'suppression', 'successful', 'hope', 'producing', 'radicalizing', 'conflict']",N/A

Although the treaty was ratified with a popular vote majority, the more radical elements of the IRA chose to continue armed resistance against the new goverment.

Ultimately Britain and Ireland reach an accord which is not acceptable to many of the Irish as it does not grant them independence.

1063481,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000OCY7JO,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","Ken Loach`s ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" is a stirring, beautifully realized film that chronicles Ireland's struggle for independence from English rule.  The story is set in 1920, four years after the Easter Uprising, in which the citizens of this British-ruled isle unilaterally declared themselves to be a sovereign nation.  To make that assertion a reality, bands of armed volunteers, calling themselves the Irish Republican Army, began fighting against the English troops who were suppressing, terrorizing and executing many Irish citizens during the time depicted in the movie.  This war lasted from 1919-1921, resulting finally in a partitioned Ireland, consisting of an independent nation called the Irish Republic in the South and an area still voluntarily subject to British rule in the North.However, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" (which takes its title from an old Irish folk song) is less concerned with the politics of the situation than with the human cost of war.  The events of the story are seen mainly through the eyes of a promising young doctor named Damien (played by the fine actor, Cillian Murphy), who is at first reluctant to join the guerillas, believing the British army to be just too well armed and too well manned to be successfully overcome by such a piddling, homegrown force as the IRA.  However, after witnessing some particularly brutal treatment of his people by English soldiers, Damien gives up his promising career as a doctor to become a passionate, full-time warrior in the cause of independence and freedom.Writer Paul Laverty has constructed a simple, straightforward narrative that shows what life is like in a wartime setting.  Damien understands that the cause he believes in so passionately is requiring him to commit acts he would never even dream of doing in a time of peace, including executing a boyhood friend of his for betraying him and his fellow fighters to the enemy.  A war of freedom requires fortitude, sacrifice and courage from its participants, to be sure, but it also demands a part of their humanity as well.  Damien soon learns that one often has to compromise one set of values in order to fulfill another.  Laverty makes it plain that no one on either side of such a conflict will ever be able to live entirely at ease with his conscience even if the goal he is fighting for is eventually achieved.  This is brought out with particular vividness in the second half of the film, after a treaty has been signed between England and Ireland, granting ""independence"" to the latter, though with many unsavory strings attached.  It is at this point that the rebel forces spilt into two diametrically opposed factions and engage in a civil war, with men who were just recently allies suddenly turning their weapons against one another.

This leads to a heartrending and shattering conclusion that exemplifies the horrifying personal cost of just such a conflict.Through the character of Damien, Laverty and Loach turn what could have been a fascinating, if dry, history lesson into a deeply moving human drama that reminds us of the high price that often must be paid if future generations are to live in freedom.

It also racked up 18 further award nominations, and five wins, elsewhere.  It's a historical drama, a sympathetic look at the early 20th century Irish Republic, one of the stages of the Irish revolution, written by Paul Laverty.  It's said to be fairly accurate historically, and was filmed in the gorgeous green countryside of County Cork.The film stars Cillian Murphy as Damien, a doctor, and Padraic Delaney as his brother Teddy, who get caught up in the struggle for Irish independence, and are driven apart by it, as was not uncommon at the time.  The look of the landscape is accurate, as are the set dressings, the vehicles, and the weapons.  So is the look and sound of the people: they've got good ""crac,""or wit, say most.Historians say that history is written by the victors, and, in the Irish revolution, a long and bloody one, the Irish eventually came out on top, though they don't always admit it.  Thus, it comes down to us that the Black and Tans, a mercenary paramilitary organization, adjunct to the regular British Army, recruited from demobbing British World War I solders, paid better than the regular army, and all over Ireland in this war, were a gang of brutal thugs.  Quite likely, they were.  At any rate, we see a lot of brutality in this tragedy-infused film, that can achieve powerful moments.""The Wind"" begins and ends during that long Irish war, not yet quite settled, and if you're not already familiar with its history, you'll find the movie hard to follow.  The general audience may have further difficulty with the film's pacing: it opens on a hysterical note of murderous violence by the Black and Tans, and never once gives us a substantial break from it, aside from a brief ""ceili,""a scene of song and dance.  The young Murphy, playing a doctor here, gets but one brief doctoring scene.  Among the film industry's new male stars, he'd have to be considered one of the easiest on the eyes, but you'd never guess that from this film: he gets only a few brief, mild, romantic scenes.  In fact, if like some of us, you might be thinking of seeing this movie just for the sake of seeing him, forget it.

My wife and I could not sit still to finish this film, but in the footage we did see, no attempt was made to place the guerrilla war from 1919 to July 1921 (in which this film begins) in proper context. That proper context is:England entered World War on Aug. 4, 1914, taking on (among other enemies) Germany, the same power Democrat President Woodrow Wilson would eventually declare war upon.In the spring of 1916 Irish insurrectionists (including socialists) staged the Easter Rising, the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798; this while England was engaged in mortal combat with Germany. In polite society we call this ""a stab in the back"". In this movie, it would be characterized as ""freedom fighting"". The British response to this stab in the back was understandably harsh (Roosevelt imprisoned thousands of Japanese-American citizens in WWII who had not thrown a single rock), and those harsh reprisals turned the mood of Ireland, as a whole, in favour of the rebels. The pro-independence republican party, Sinn F&eacute;in, received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann) and government.

We have watched films about the fight for Irish independence from England in the early 20th Century, but ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" may be the most powerful and moving yet.  Its ensemble cast is magnificent, including Cillian Murphy as Damien.Ireland shared a kinship with the American colonies in its fight against the cruelty and subjugation of the British crown.  Just like the American patriots who spurned any compromises with England short of total freedom, this film graphically records the Irish fight for that cherished goal--with brother sometimes pitted against brother, not unlike the American Civil War.Some of us have Scottish roots and have been there too; and some day Scotland may be totally independent, like William Wallace fought for centuries ago.  It is moving in that direction, peacefully.The courageous American actor Sylvester Stallone said in an interview more than 20 years ago: ""A survivor is someone who has to be somewhat of a loner and listen to his own inner voice.  And the most important thing . . . a survivor has is to be able to take a totally desperate, negative, horrendous, pessimistic situation and turn it into a positive.  And that can happen.""It happened with the American and Irish patriots.

Scanlon,"[13, 15]","I returned from Ireland barely a month ago where I learned more than I imagined about the Irish ""Rising"" and Civil War, something few Irish Americans even know about.A friend of mine--by the name of McCarthy--recommended this film as ""what really happened; all the rest you hear is hot air.""Yes, it's brutal, but should a ""war movie"" not be that way? The worst brutality came from the British troops--it took place in 1920--who treated the Irish like they weren't humans--or even animals! It caused me to reflect: How many of the British troops who treated the Irish like they were fertilizer are now buried in ""honor and glory"" in British national cemeteries and remembered as if they were heroes in English history books? As I frequently visit the Arlington National Cemetery, I thought the same about Vietnam, Korea, Iraq--and the many other wars. That's where the ""metaphor"" comes in.While in Ireland, I picked up the book ""Brother Against Brother"" on which the film, alas, may have been based. There's so much we need to learn, about that struggle, and about struggles in general...The Irish civil war cause, so beautifully summarized by the film's script, was a consequence of those willing to continue under provisional English rule, and those who declared, ""What? They've been oppressing and killing us for 900 years. I won't accept ANY English rule!""The acting is stellar, the set magnificent, the story needs to be repeated! I've recommended the film heartily to friends and acquaintances of all nationalities, more for the metaphorical than historical value. Perhaps when we realize how we can treat and have treated others, we'll learn to stop doing so.Why only four stars? Well, when some of the characters were shot, there was no blood. It's true that such a fine film didn't have a Hollywood budget so such special effects may have been too expensive. But perhaps if they had been included, the real brutality may have been more evident, and not gratuitous.Despite ""only"" four stars, I have preordered the film, so I can see it again and again, and show it to others, those interested in Irish history, and those interested in the truth of war.",4,Great as history and somewhat as metaphor,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,2159,"['returned', 'Ireland', 'barely', 'month', 'where', 'learned', 'more', 'imagined', 'Irish', 'Rising', 'Civil', 'War', 'something', 'few', 'Irish', 'Americans', 'even', 'know', 'about.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'name', 'McCarthy', 'recommended', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'rest', 'hear', 'hot', 'air', 'Yes', 'brutal', 'should', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'worst', 'brutality', 'came', 'British', 'troops', 'took', 'place', '1920', 'who', 'treated', 'Irish', 'were', ""n't"", 'humans', 'even', 'animals', 'caused', 'reflect', 'How', 'many', 'British', 'troops', 'who', 'treated', 'Irish', 'were', 'fertilizer', 'are', 'now', 'buried', 'honor', 'glory', 'British', 'national', 'cemeteries', 'remembered', 'were', 'heroes', 'English', 'history', 'books', 'frequently', 'visit', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetery', 'thought', 'same', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'Iraq', 'many', 'other', 'wars', 'where', 'metaphor', 'in.While', 'Ireland', 'picked', 'up', 'book', 'Brother', 'Against', 'Brother', 'film', 'alas', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'so', 'much', 'need', 'learn', 'struggle', 'struggles', 'general', 'Irish', 'civil', 'war', 'cause', 'so', 'beautifully', 'summarized', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'consequence', 'willing', 'continue', 'provisional', 'English', 'rule', 'who', 'declared', 'What', ""'ve"", 'been', 'oppressing', 'killing', '900', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'ANY', 'English', 'rule', 'acting', 'stellar', 'set', 'magnificent', 'story', 'be', 'repeated', ""'ve"", 'recommended', 'film', 'heartily', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'nationalities', 'more', 'metaphorical', 'historical', 'value', 'Perhaps', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'can', 'treat', 'have', 'treated', 'others', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'stop', 'doing', 'so.Why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'when', 'characters', 'were', 'shot', 'was', 'blood', 'true', 'fine', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hollywood', 'budget', 'so', 'such', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'expensive', 'perhaps', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'real', 'brutality', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'evident', 'not', 'gratuitous.Despite', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'have', 'preordered', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'show', 'others', 'interested', 'Irish', 'history', 'interested', 'truth', 'war']",N/A
1063500,A21AW4TNF12PTK,B000OCY7JO,TruxtonSpangler,"[2, 2]","I just read a British apologist's denunciation of the film in the one star reviews.  Allow me to counter that:First of all, whatever the other merits of the film, the best part of the movie for me, an Irish/American dual citizen, was the debate over whether to accept the Partition or not.  This finely represented, within the confines of the movie, the essential arguments facing the Irish populace at the time.Now, insofar as the complaint about this being anti-British...let's review some of the finer points of British but mostly English occupation of Ireland.  For someone to complain about a movie dealing with the hideous history of that occupation is laughable.The statutes of Kilkenny were wonderful instruments of British governship.  Cromwell's sack of Drogheda is another.  Depending on which account you believe, Cromwell massacred anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 civilians.  After he took Drogheda, thousands of Irish were enslaved in Barbados where, according to many accounts, they were forced to breed with African slaves to produce a more valuable, biracial slave for sale.  Cromwell, to thank his men, doled out lands to his Scottish Presbyterian troops in Ulster, which set the stage for the Troubles later on.The Famine is yet another jewel in the crown of English governship.  According to many historians, while there was more than sufficient supplies of food to feed Ireland, most of that was shipped to Britain, while the Irish peasants who tilled the land were offered one-way tickets out of Ireland by the gentry.  Parliament did precious little to stave off the Famine, although there were some efforts by enlightened Members.  Again, according to historians, somewhere between one quarter ane one third of Irelands population was lost over a generation, largely due to the Famine and the exiles it created.Partition was a joke. Read the stories behind the ""negotiations.""  The British government threatened all out war with the army that had returned from the continent that it was finding it hard to give employment.  In many cases, the Black and Tans were the criminal element of the British army that were given carte blanche to wreak terror on the Irish population to try and get it to stay with Britain.  Sure, there were probably reprisals for IRA raids, but in many cases, they didn't even need those to justify their actions.  The Black and Tans were murderous thugs who sought to terrorize the populace into staying with Britains.What Carson, Lloyd George and Churchill accomplished was carving out the largely Catholic counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan out of Ulster, leaving an overwhelming majority of Protestants in the remaining Six Counties. This, of course, was set up with Cromwell's planting back in the 1600's.Fast-forward to the Troubles.  We'll never know for sure what started the shooting on Bloody Sunday.  But thanks to the suppression of the Stalker Report, which was thankfully published outside the UK, we've learned that the police and military authorities were surreptiously giving Protestant paramilitary units information so that it could go out and exterminate IRA or Catholic (not always the same thing) individuals.The depredations the British visited upon Ireland are too numerous to mention.  I've only touched on a few of them here.  But for someone to complain that a movie is anti-British propaganda ignores history.  In fact, that there aren't more such movies from other former colonies is surprising.",5,Excellent,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,3475,"['just', 'read', 'British', 'apologist', 'denunciation', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'Allow', 'counter', 'First', 'whatever', 'other', 'merits', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Irish/American', 'dual', 'citizen', 'was', 'debate', 'accept', 'Partition', 'not', 'finely', 'represented', 'confines', 'movie', 'essential', 'arguments', 'facing', 'Irish', 'populace', 'time.Now', 'insofar', 'complaint', 'being', 'anti-British', 'let', 'review', 'finer', 'points', 'British', 'mostly', 'English', 'occupation', 'Ireland', 'someone', 'complain', 'movie', 'dealing', 'hideous', 'history', 'occupation', 'laughable.The', 'statutes', 'Kilkenny', 'were', 'wonderful', 'instruments', 'British', 'governship', 'Cromwell', 'sack', 'Drogheda', 'Depending', 'account', 'believe', 'Cromwell', 'massacred', 'anywhere', '2,000', '4,000', 'civilians', 'took', 'Drogheda', 'thousands', 'Irish', 'were', 'enslaved', 'Barbados', 'where', 'according', 'many', 'accounts', 'were', 'forced', 'breed', 'African', 'slaves', 'produce', 'more', 'valuable', 'biracial', 'slave', 'sale', 'Cromwell', 'thank', 'men', 'doled', 'out', 'lands', 'Scottish', 'Presbyterian', 'troops', 'Ulster', 'set', 'stage', 'Troubles', 'later', 'on.The', 'Famine', 'yet', 'jewel', 'crown', 'English', 'governship', 'According', 'many', 'historians', 'was', 'more', 'sufficient', 'supplies', 'food', 'feed', 'Ireland', 'most', 'was', 'shipped', 'Britain', 'Irish', 'peasants', 'who', 'tilled', 'land', 'were', 'offered', 'one-way', 'tickets', 'Ireland', 'gentry', 'Parliament', 'did', 'precious', 'little', 'stave', 'off', 'Famine', 'were', 'efforts', 'enlightened', 'Members', 'Again', 'according', 'historians', 'somewhere', 'one', 'quarter', 'ane', 'one', 'third', 'Irelands', 'population', 'was', 'lost', 'generation', 'largely', 'due', 'Famine', 'exiles', 'created.Partition', 'was', 'joke', 'Read', 'stories', 'negotiations', 'British', 'government', 'threatened', 'out', 'war', 'army', 'had', 'returned', 'continent', 'was', 'finding', 'hard', 'give', 'employment', 'many', 'cases', 'Black', 'Tans', 'were', 'criminal', 'element', 'British', 'army', 'were', 'given', 'carte', 'blanche', 'wreak', 'terror', 'Irish', 'population', 'try', 'get', 'stay', 'Britain', 'Sure', 'were', 'probably', 'reprisals', 'IRA', 'raids', 'many', 'cases', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'justify', 'actions', 'Black', 'Tans', 'were', 'murderous', 'thugs', 'who', 'sought', 'terrorize', 'populace', 'staying', 'Britains.What', 'Carson', 'Lloyd', 'George', 'Churchill', 'accomplished', 'was', 'carving', 'out', 'largely', 'Catholic', 'counties', 'Cavan', 'Donegal', 'Monaghan', 'Ulster', 'leaving', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'Protestants', 'remaining', 'Six', 'Counties', 'course', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'Cromwell', 'planting', 'back', ""1600's.Fast-forward"", 'Troubles', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'sure', 'started', 'shooting', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'thanks', 'suppression', 'Stalker', 'Report', 'was', 'thankfully', 'published', 'UK', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'police', 'military', 'authorities', 'were', 'surreptiously', 'giving', 'Protestant', 'paramilitary', 'units', 'information', 'could', 'go', 'out', 'exterminate', 'IRA', 'Catholic', 'not', 'always', 'same', 'thing', 'individuals.The', 'depredations', 'British', 'visited', 'Ireland', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', ""'ve"", 'only', 'touched', 'few', 'here', 'someone', 'complain', 'movie', 'anti-British', 'propaganda', 'ignores', 'history', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'such', 'movies', 'other', 'former', 'colonies', 'surprising']",N/A

Saturen,"[4, 5]","Set in the early 1920s, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" tells the story of two Irish brothers at first united in the struggle for independence from England, but ultimately torn apart by the civil strife that followed. Damien (Cillian Murphy) is a bright medical student who, on his way to study in London, witnesses British atrocities and chooses instead to stay home and join the resistance group led by his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney). Despite his initial reluctance to get involved in the fighting, Damien grows increasingly steadfast and unyielding in his Republican (and Marxist) convictions. Damien's unwavering allegiance to his ideals places him in a heartbreaking position--at one wrenching point in the film, making him the executioner of a lifelong friend.The deepest tragedy comes after the IRA signs a truce with England, splitting former comrades into opposing camps. Some, like Teddy, hail the truce as a victory they do not want to jeopardize with continued violence. However, the agreement falls short of granting Ireland full independence, and in Damien's eyes, accepting it means ""selling out"" the martyrs who died for true autonomy. In the ensuing turmoil, brother turns against brother with heartrending results.Powerful performances by Murphy, Delaney, and Orla Fitzgerald (Sinead, a participant in the resistance who falls in love with Damien) make ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" an affecting film. The movie shows the very personal consequences of the political rift in Ireland, while imparting the positions of both sides in a nuanced manner.
