769121,A2F5B0TI5FK4AZ,B0000AZKP6,A Sharer,"[1, 1]","I did not read any reviews before buyng this used at a video store, but it seemed so appealing based on its description and photo.  I really wanted to like the movie and kept on watching even after the first 10 minutes when I had already realized I was just not going to like it. The acting is tremendous but I did not feel any chemistry between any of the guys and their women ( not even rory and the runaway) except Kirk and Diana. It looks like it could have been a nice  family movie, but it has two torrid ripping off of clothes to have instant sex scenes, a gratuitous scene of girl lying lewdly in thong underwear while talking on the phone to cameron, and a morning-after scene of  Cameron beside a naked girl lying under the sheets though thankfully no sex was really shown.)  I did like the dance scene between Kirk and Diana, the a little bit tender moments Michael showed sometimes with Bernadette, and the hilarious scene with the green thong underwear when Bernadette says: ""Not ""bad?Not bad? Whatever else this is, it is certainly bad.""  I never found anything to like in Cameron - there was no growth of character, nor was there really in the other Douglas men, though there was a hint of them trying to tell each other they loved each other, but it didn't really happen.  - Well, maybe it was a miniscule bit of growth for Cameron to say at the end that he wished he had protected his ""girl."" But did he ever go back to her lovingly and try to make things right?  Young Rory showed some strength of character in taking the risk of approaching the runaway girl and defending her against the bullies, but sadly he later described the incident in a way that was too macho for me -bragging about how he beat up the bad guys and exactly where he hit them.  Sending the dead uncle off in a burning boat was not funny, believable, or acceptable - sorry - I just think these excellent actors could have insisted on a more enlightened story.  I would have liked to see the men soften more and really open up more, because the back of the disc jacket claims that michael ends up pulling his familly back together but all I saw at the end was a kind of sweet scene where he and his dad joked as they fell asleep on the couch together and everyone warmly said good night to each other, but not much of any kind of real shift in any way. How is the family back together when michaeal is still sleeping on the couch anyway?",1,Disappointed: definitely not a wholesome family movie nor a chick flick,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2426,"['did', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'buyng', 'used', 'video', 'store', 'seemed', 'so', 'appealing', 'based', 'description', 'photo', 'really', 'wanted', 'movie', 'kept', 'watching', 'even', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'when', 'had', 'already', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'guys', 'women', 'not', 'even', 'rory', 'runaway', 'Kirk', 'Diana', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'two', 'torrid', 'ripping', 'clothes', 'have', 'instant', 'sex', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'scene', 'girl', 'lying', 'lewdly', 'thong', 'underwear', 'talking', 'phone', 'cameron', 'morning-after', 'scene', 'Cameron', 'naked', 'girl', 'lying', 'sheets', 'thankfully', 'sex', 'was', 'really', 'shown', 'did', 'dance', 'scene', 'Kirk', 'Diana', 'little', 'bit', 'tender', 'moments', 'Michael', 'showed', 'sometimes', 'Bernadette', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'green', 'thong', 'underwear', 'when', 'Bernadette', 'Not', 'bad', 'Not', 'bad', 'else', 'certainly', 'bad', 'never', 'found', 'anything', 'like', 'Cameron', 'was', 'growth', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'other', 'Douglas', 'men', 'was', 'hint', 'trying', 'tell', 'other', 'loved', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'Well', 'maybe', 'was', 'miniscule', 'bit', 'growth', 'Cameron', 'say', 'end', 'wished', 'had', 'protected', 'girl', 'did', 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'lovingly', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Young', 'Rory', 'showed', 'strength', 'character', 'taking', 'risk', 'approaching', 'runaway', 'girl', 'defending', 'bullies', 'sadly', 'later', 'described', 'incident', 'way', 'was', 'too', 'macho', '-bragging', 'how', 'beat', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'exactly', 'where', 'hit', 'Sending', 'dead', 'uncle', 'burning', 'boat', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'believable', 'acceptable', 'sorry', 'just', 'think', 'excellent', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'insisted', 'more', 'enlightened', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'men', 'soften', 'more', 'really', 'open', 'up', 'more', 'back', 'disc', 'jacket', 'michael', 'up', 'pulling', 'familly', 'back', 'together', 'saw', 'end', 'was', 'kind', 'sweet', 'scene', 'where', 'dad', 'joked', 'fell', 'asleep', 'couch', 'together', 'everyone', 'warmly', 'said', 'good', 'night', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'kind', 'real', 'shift', 'way', 'How', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'when', 'michaeal', 'still', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'anyway']",N/A
769122,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0000AZKP6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","It Runs In the Family is about a family with their own personal problems that they must work out on their own.  The best way to describe this type of comedy is that it takes a while to get going and there's several dry periods when you can probably walk away for a few minutes and not miss anything special, but the second half is a dramatic improvement and worth sticking with it until the end.Michael Douglas and his father share the role of lead character.  Michael's character finds himself involved with a girl he works with which prompts one inappropriate but really hilarious sexual-related scene while a homeless man watches.  The father begins his performance in the doctors office after suffering from a stroke.  Meanwhile the two sons have their own issues.  The oldest one likes to flirt with the Liv Tyler-resembling Michelle Monaghan but struggles to find a connection.  Seriously, I thought it WAS Liv until I did a google search.  This part of the story doesn't receive much attention and is sort of pointlessly integrated.  The youngest son however, has a more compelling portion of the film.  He has to work up the courage to not only ask a girl out that he likes, but find a way to stand up to a skateboarder kid that continues to pick on him and his friends.However, the father is the best and character by *far* and the reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars.  After suffering from a stroke, he goes about his daily routine more cautiously with the realization that his life could end at any time, and he's always hanging around his son (Michael Douglas) as a way for the two of them to figure out their relationship.  Michael seems to think he's never good enough to please his father.  This portion of the movie is really well-told.  It's not always serious drama here however- several comedy bits occur as well.  Sort of disappointing that the mother isn't utilized much.  She's always around to make sure the family remains functionable (for the most part) but that's about it for her performance.A type of comedy/drama comparable to the hit TV show Parenthood is what you can expect here.  The humor doesn't always work but when it does (especially during the more storyline-focused second half) that's what makes It Runs In the Family such a compelling combination of drama and comedy.",4,what a family,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,2309,"['Family', 'family', 'own', 'personal', 'problems', 'must', 'work', 'out', 'own', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'type', 'comedy', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'several', 'dry', 'periods', 'when', 'can', 'probably', 'walk', 'away', 'few', 'minutes', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'special', 'second', 'half', 'dramatic', 'improvement', 'worth', 'sticking', 'end.Michael', 'Douglas', 'father', 'share', 'role', 'lead', 'character', 'Michael', 'character', 'involved', 'girl', 'prompts', 'one', 'inappropriate', 'really', 'hilarious', 'sexual-related', 'scene', 'homeless', 'man', 'watches', 'father', 'performance', 'doctors', 'office', 'suffering', 'stroke', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'sons', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'oldest', 'one', 'flirt', 'Liv', 'Tyler-resembling', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'find', 'connection', 'Seriously', 'thought', 'WAS', 'Liv', 'did', 'google', 'search', 'part', 'story', ""n't"", 'receive', 'much', 'attention', 'sort', 'pointlessly', 'integrated', 'youngest', 'son', 'however', 'more', 'compelling', 'portion', 'film', 'work', 'up', 'courage', 'not', 'only', 'ask', 'girl', 'out', 'find', 'way', 'stand', 'up', 'skateboarder', 'kid', 'pick', 'friends.However', 'father', 'best', 'character', '*far*', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'suffering', 'stroke', 'daily', 'routine', 'more', 'cautiously', 'realization', 'life', 'could', 'end', 'time', 'always', 'hanging', 'son', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'way', 'two', 'figure', 'out', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'think', 'never', 'good', 'enough', 'please', 'father', 'portion', 'movie', 'really', 'well-told', 'not', 'always', 'serious', 'drama', 'here', 'however-', 'several', 'comedy', 'bits', 'occur', 'as', 'well', 'Sort', 'disappointing', 'mother', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'much', 'always', 'make', 'sure', 'family', 'functionable', 'most', 'part', 'performance.A', 'type', 'comedy/drama', 'comparable', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Parenthood', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'here', 'humor', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'when', 'especially', 'more', 'storyline-focused', 'second', 'half', 'what', 'Runs', 'Family', 'compelling', 'combination', 'drama', 'comedy']",N/A

769126,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0000AZKP6,David Hugaert,"[3, 4]","""It Runs In The Family"" takes both a candid and panoramic view inside the lives of three generations of one of Hollywood's most famous families - the Douglases. According to the (entire) film's storyline, Dad Kirk is a senior citizen trying to cope with both retirement and a somewhat ""hectic"" home life, including a stern, yet loveable wife trying to keep her head above water. Son Michael is a crusty, tough-as-nails lawyer trying to balance both career and family, with a son in college - who's not sure about himself, let alone what to make of his surroundings. Most of the time, the family seems to have it all together, with most of the clan displaying a close-knit relationship, all except for father and son in certain instances. These two squabble about even the most petty of things, but who said a familial relationship has to be free of disagreements and strife, especially between father and son (in certain cases)? It is these particular moments that draws the viewer into the scenario of ""IRITF"". Seeing father, son and grandson (together) out on an uninhabited lake in a canoe out in the middle of nowhere is priceless, and is just one of this movie's many tender moments that cannot be bought or sold. But, if you want to see good cinematic relations up close and sort-of personal, you'll have to purhase a ticket (or video) to become an ""adopted"" member of the Douglas family.

Frankly, although I think they might have done better;  once in awhile it's reasonable to judge success by a different set of criteria.This film is a study of three generations of a well to do family, and this family's inability to deal openly with years of unspoken conflicts. This certainly isn't the first movie to tackle this subject, and it won't be the last. There isn't a great deal in terms of plot twists, surprises, astonishing performances or writing. It's look and feel are on a par with a high quality made for TV movie. Many of the non family members in the story are not well developed, and don't really contribute very much to the story.However ...  it would be difficult to think of a father and son who have contributed more to the film industry than have Kirk and Michael Douglas, and it is highly unlikely that this pairing will ever be seen again. This is, in and of itself, a good enough reason for me to see this film. But there is something else that this film does extremely well. It depicts the pain of an elderly man who is facing the kind of losses that are to be expected as one ages, and in doing so, Kirk Douglas makes it abundantly clear that he is still a substantial force on screen. I hate to fall back on the old sports analogy, but I am reminded of the last few years that Louis Tiant pitched for the Red Sox. Sure, he was past his prime, yet  he was able to offer perspective, experience and a positive mind set that only years in baseball could provide. In other words, his value to the club what about more than statistics. It was about character.Kirk Douglas invests this film with just this sort of extra ingredient. If you are someone who has paid close attention to American cinema for the last 50 plus years, you understand what I am trying to describe.

That's the question you'll ask yourself if you watch this drivel.Perhaps the answer is three generations of Douglases -- Kirk, Michael and Cameron -- appear in ""It Runs in the Family"". The two older Douglases play Jewish (Gromberg) lawyers (Kirk a retired former partner now overcoming a stroke) while son Asher (Cameron) is a slacker attending college. The cast includes Bernadette Peters as Michael's wife and Rory Culkin and their younger son.My onscreen guide said the movie was taken from a short story by the guy that wrote ""Christmas Story"" and was supposed to be a followup on that success based on memories of the pre-teen son, which would be Culkin. Whomever wrote that never saw this movie!This script was apparently about family dysfunction, since the dad wants to do the nasty with a woman he knows from a soup kitchen, the college boy can't keep his pants on and ends up in trouble with the cops over drugs, and the younger son also has a romantic entanglement with a skag he knows from school. The old man's wife dies, too, pushing him into Michael's disheveled household.This sounds formulaic except the formula doesn't work. Instead of being drawn into the lives of these losers, you laugh at the silly predicaments created for them by the awkward script. There is hardly a moment in the entire film that represents anything remotely close to real family life. Every moment seems to be taken over by one calamity or another, usually of the male Douglases creation.For me, this was a memorable film in a negative way. If Michael Douglas made $20 million for this movie, the people that bankrolled this turkey should ask for a 95 percent refund. For, in addition to the movie being a loser, Michael Douglas is badly out of shape in it with a big gut that sticks out.

769133,A27UE9HJRZ22YI,B0000AZKP6,"Louie's Mom ""Compulsive Reader""","[0, 0]","NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW:  I just watched this film on H B O and immediately wanted to review it so that it would be on my list of reviews, for people who have interests similar to mine. (There are plenty of reviews already posted for this film for someone who looks it up by name to decide if she or he wants to watch it.)  And fyi - I'm not a ""fan"" of any actors - I appreciate it when they perform well, but they are paid to do it and I don't ever see a film just because an actor is in it.However, it was very interesting watching a movie about three generations of men, in which the actors ARE those three generations of one family.  I particularly like the fact that the oldest male was played by Kirk Douglas, who had suffered a stroke seven years' previously and thus very realistically played an older man who has suffered a stroke.  I'd like to see more movies cast with older people who look and ARE old, people who have had illnesses that have left them with some impairments, women who are not in the subset of maybe 5% who are beautiful, etc.The family dynamics in this film rang true - we all have strong, and mixed feelings about our parents, our children (well, I don't have any but I have nieces and nephews and children of close friends), our roles in life, our shame at our failures and bad behaviors, etc.Some of the reviewers here on Amazon have stated that there isn't enough comedy, that the main characters are not likeable, that the film is boring, etc.  It's true that there isn't a lot of comedy - and if you saw this film expecting it to be light and comedic you would be disapointed.I agree that the main characters in the film are not entirely likeable - but I think that in real life our close friends and family members aren't easily characterized as ""likeable"" or ""not likeable"" - we see their likeable and unattractive characteristics both, and we sometimes have strong love and affection for people who others find unlikeable - because we have over time weighed those unlikeable characteristics against the likeable ones, and have considered the efforts they have made to improve themselves.  If you know where someone started and has been in life - in terms of the healthiness of their home lives as children, tragedies they may have endured, etc. you may well ""like"" them whereas others who don't know their stories do not.I think it would be interesting if we could see the reviews here on Amazon organized by the ages of the reviewers, and see if there is a positive correlation between the ages of the reviewers and the numbers of stars they gave the film.  I'm over forty, and over the last ten years have evaluated my close relationships and have decided which ones to continue and which ones to end.As the credits rolled, there was a beautiful song, (and I don't usually care for ""lounge"" type music!) with piano and bass and some quiet drums, which I am going to look up.  ""You went away, and my heart went with you, I speak your name in my every prayer, if there is some other way to prove that I love you, I swear I don't know how, you'll never know if you don't know now.""  I think it was perfect for the ending.  Ok, I just interrupted writing this review to look it up and it is titled ""You'll Never Know"" and at the end of the file is sung by Diana Krall.",4,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I really liked this film",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,3308,"['SPOILERS', 'IN', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'H', 'B', 'O', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'review', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'list', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'interests', 'similar', 'mine', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'already', 'posted', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'name', 'decide', 'watch', 'fyi', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'actors', 'appreciate', 'when', 'perform', 'well', 'are', 'paid', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'actor', 'it.However', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'watching', 'movie', 'three', 'generations', 'men', 'actors', 'ARE', 'three', 'generations', 'one', 'family', 'particularly', 'fact', 'oldest', 'male', 'was', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'who', 'had', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'seven', 'years', 'previously', 'thus', 'very', 'realistically', 'played', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'stroke', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'cast', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'ARE', 'old', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'illnesses', 'have', 'left', 'impairments', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'subset', 'maybe', '5', '%', 'who', 'are', 'beautiful', 'etc.The', 'family', 'dynamics', 'film', 'rang', 'true', 'have', 'strong', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'parents', 'children', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'children', 'close', 'friends', 'roles', 'life', 'shame', 'failures', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'etc.Some', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'have', 'stated', ""n't"", 'enough', 'comedy', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'likeable', 'film', 'boring', 'etc', 'true', ""n't"", 'lot', 'comedy', 'saw', 'film', 'expecting', 'be', 'light', 'comedic', 'would', 'be', 'disapointed.I', 'agree', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'likeable', 'think', 'real', 'life', 'close', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'characterized', 'likeable', 'not', 'likeable', 'see', 'likeable', 'unattractive', 'characteristics', 'sometimes', 'have', 'strong', 'love', 'affection', 'people', 'who', 'others', 'find', 'unlikeable', 'have', 'over', 'time', 'weighed', 'unlikeable', 'characteristics', 'likeable', 'ones', 'have', 'considered', 'efforts', 'have', 'made', 'improve', 'know', 'where', 'someone', 'started', 'been', 'life', 'terms', 'healthiness', 'home', 'lives', 'children', 'tragedies', 'may', 'have', 'endured', 'etc', 'may', 'well', 'whereas', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stories', 'do', 'not.I', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'could', 'see', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'organized', 'ages', 'reviewers', 'see', 'positive', 'correlation', 'ages', 'reviewers', 'numbers', 'stars', 'gave', 'film', ""'m"", 'forty', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'evaluated', 'close', 'relationships', 'have', 'decided', 'ones', 'continue', 'ones', 'end.As', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'beautiful', 'song', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'lounge', 'type', 'music', 'piano', 'bass', 'quiet', 'drums', 'am', 'going', 'look', 'up', 'went', 'away', 'heart', 'went', 'speak', 'name', 'prayer', 'other', 'way', 'prove', 'love', 'swear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'now', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'ending', 'Ok', 'just', 'interrupted', 'writing', 'review', 'look', 'up', 'titled', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Know', 'end', 'file', 'sung', 'Diana', 'Krall']",N/A

769135,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000AZKP6,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","In ""It Runs in the Family,"" real life father and son, Kirk and Michael Douglas, portray a fictional father and son who seem never to have gotten along very well in life.  Despite the fact that we know that this filial conflict is what the film is supposed to be about, there is such a profusion of characters and subplots cluttering up the storyline that the central relationship is never as fully developed as it needs to be to make the concept work.  I suspect that the fact that the elder Douglas is currently suffering from the debilitating effects of a stroke he had a few years back (resulting in his inability to speak clearly) necessitated this shift away from these two characters for an inordinate amount of the movie's running time.  Indeed, if there is one charge to be leveled against Jesse Wigutow's all-over-the-map screenplay, it is that it is clearly trying to do too many things at once - and not doing any of them particularly well, I might add.Wigutow and director Fred Schepisi have provided us with a dizzying array of characters, some of whom make an impact on the audience and some of whom come across as mere devices to help pad out the enormously overstuffed plot.  The multi-generational canvas is made up of Mitchell Gromberg, the curmudgeonly patriarch who seemingly never gave his son the love and encouragement he needed; Alex Gromberg, Mitch's liberal-minded attorney son who resents his father and worries that he may be no better a role model to his own boys than Mitchell was to him; Evelyn Gromberg, the understanding matriarch who has always had to serve as broker and peacemaker between her two feuding ""boys;"" Rebecca Gromberg, Alex' levelheaded wife who worries (rightfully in one case) that both their children are headed for some kind of major trouble; Asher Gromberg, their pot-pushing, ne'er-do-well son who sure could use some guidance from his hardworking, preoccupied father; and, finally, Eli Gromberg, their eleven-year-old boy who gets beaten up regularly by the rampaging school bullies.  Add to this list a bevy of friends, relatives, business associates and other assorted onlookers and hangers-on, few of whom are of any interest to us in the audience, and you have the recipe for one mighty messy and overcooked storyline.  ""It Runs in the Family"" does achieve moments of pathos and power, particularly when it is focusing on the harsh realities of aging and losing a loved one, and the poignancy of time passing, but too often these moments are diluted by soap opera mechanics and an inappropriately slapstick tone (an impromptu, middle-of-the-night ""Viking"" funeral is particularly ludicrous and egregious in this respect).  Just as we are caught up in the problems of one character, we are deflected to those of another whom we could - quite frankly - care less about.One can't exactly fault the actors for not being to pull this material off.  The two Douglases, Bernadette Peters, Diana Douglas and Rory Culkin do what they can with what they've been given.  What they really could have used was a more disciplined writer and director to keep the whole damn thing in better focus.",2,"sloppy, overstuffed family drama",1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,3140,"['Family', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'son', 'Kirk', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'fictional', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'seem', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'life', 'fact', 'know', 'filial', 'conflict', 'what', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'such', 'profusion', 'characters', 'subplots', 'cluttering', 'up', 'storyline', 'central', 'relationship', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'be', 'make', 'concept', 'work', 'suspect', 'fact', 'elder', 'Douglas', 'currently', 'suffering', 'debilitating', 'effects', 'stroke', 'had', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'resulting', 'inability', 'speak', 'clearly', 'necessitated', 'shift', 'away', 'two', 'characters', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'Indeed', 'one', 'charge', 'be', 'leveled', 'Jesse', 'Wigutow', 'all-over-the-map', 'screenplay', 'clearly', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'not', 'doing', 'particularly', 'well', 'might', 'add.Wigutow', 'director', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'have', 'provided', 'dizzying', 'array', 'characters', 'whom', 'make', 'impact', 'audience', 'whom', 'come', 'mere', 'devices', 'help', 'pad', 'out', 'enormously', 'overstuffed', 'plot', 'multi-generational', 'canvas', 'made', 'Mitchell', 'Gromberg', 'curmudgeonly', 'patriarch', 'who', 'seemingly', 'never', 'gave', 'son', 'love', 'encouragement', 'needed', 'Alex', 'Gromberg', 'Mitch', 'liberal-minded', 'attorney', 'son', 'who', 'father', 'worries', 'may', 'be', 'no', 'better', 'role', 'model', 'own', 'boys', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'Evelyn', 'Gromberg', 'understanding', 'matriarch', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'serve', 'broker', 'peacemaker', 'two', 'feuding', 'boys', 'Rebecca', 'Gromberg', 'Alex', 'levelheaded', 'wife', 'who', 'rightfully', 'one', 'case', 'children', 'are', 'headed', 'kind', 'major', 'trouble', 'Asher', 'Gromberg', 'pot-pushing', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'son', 'who', 'sure', 'could', 'use', 'guidance', 'hardworking', 'preoccupied', 'father', 'finally', 'Eli', 'Gromberg', 'eleven-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'beaten', 'up', 'regularly', 'rampaging', 'school', 'bullies', 'Add', 'list', 'bevy', 'friends', 'relatives', 'business', 'associates', 'other', 'assorted', 'onlookers', 'hangers-on', 'few', 'whom', 'are', 'interest', 'audience', 'have', 'recipe', 'one', 'mighty', 'messy', 'overcooked', 'storyline', 'Family', 'achieve', 'moments', 'pathos', 'power', 'particularly', 'when', 'focusing', 'harsh', 'realities', 'aging', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'poignancy', 'time', 'passing', 'too', 'often', 'moments', 'are', 'diluted', 'soap', 'opera', 'mechanics', 'inappropriately', 'slapstick', 'tone', 'impromptu', 'middle-of-the-night', 'Viking', 'funeral', 'particularly', 'ludicrous', 'egregious', 'respect', 'Just', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'problems', 'one', 'character', 'are', 'deflected', 'whom', 'could', 'quite', 'frankly', 'care', 'less', 'about.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fault', 'actors', 'not', 'being', 'pull', 'material', 'off', 'two', 'Douglases', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Diana', 'Douglas', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'What', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'was', 'more', 'disciplined', 'writer', 'director', 'keep', 'whole', 'damn', 'thing', 'better', 'focus']",N/A

769139,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000AZKP6,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","I heard this is a light-weight comedy about one family.  Surely, it is intended as such, but the laugh comes not so often, and the story is too slow, or the characters are too many.  The only unique point is that it features the Douglas family, particularly Michael and Kirk in one film (and as father and son), but that fact doesn't help at all when it takes more than ten minutes (in a roundabout way) to introduce all of them to us.  Hey, we (I mean, those fans who would watch this film) all know that Kirk is the father of Michael, so why you take so long before starting things?Yes, three generations from the Douglas family show up in this film as the &quot;Grombergs&quot; a dysfunctional family whose members just do not how to communicate with each other.  Grumpy Kirk Douglas is the center of the family (and the film) while his son Michael Douglas's character faces the crisis of the family (in the shape of the suspected infidelty).Each member has his/her problems, as this kind of film always show.  So, you also see Diana Douglas (Michael's mother) playing against Kirk Douglas while Cameron Douglas (Michael's son) appears as ... er ... Michael's character's son, who is not doing well in university, and got into troubles, one drug-related.Now, the troubles with &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot; is that the film ALMOST touches the very biting truths about being in a family -- you cannot get away from your children, siblings, or parents no matter what they are, or how they act.  You sit through the embarrasing moments of the family's annual gatherings, wishing that this would end soon, and the film tries to show such moments.  But what it reveals in the overlong running time is nothing original or truthful to us.  One example shows: when a quiet, very introspective boy Rory Culkin (cast as Cameron's younger brother) falls for a girl in school, she must be a wild, goth girl who has a pierce in nose.  The film is full of such cliched elements that you can tell who is going to die, and how, before it happens.I don't think acting is bad, and it is good to see Kirk Douglas after he suffered from a stroke (and he still has the daredevil personality seen in, say, &quot;Doc&quot; in &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;).  Cameron Douglas is good and looks natural as rebellous college student, and there are some memorable moments from the cast, especially from the dance scene of Diana and Kirk.  But after watching this long film, you will remember almost nothing in it, perhaps except the fact that you saw four Douglases in one picture.
