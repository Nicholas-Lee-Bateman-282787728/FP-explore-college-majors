I watched them all in a row and this one just took my breath away. So much so that I watched it a few more times just to understand it more. Society seems to think that only people with no prospects commit suicide; but this movie that shows that even if you have everything going for you, it can all seem like too much. Too much to handle, to the point where you'd rather not handle anything at all. I know the movie is not just about David's suicide, but about how his friends handle and grow from it, how society itself handles teenage suicides.The students wanting to have a tribute to David, but the school being afraid that honoring someone who commited suicide would cause others to do the same; they also seemed to believe that having a tribute for someone who took his own life was just something that you didn't do. I personally found this insulting and was glad that in the end the students found their own way of memorializing their fallen friend.Your friends may lie, the truth can come from strangers...life is long, it is not made to measure. It will go on, the same in pain and pleasure. Wondering how we ever got this far by wishing on another lucky star.",5,This movie took my breath away,980812800,"01 30, 2001",2001,1413,"['was', ""n't"", 'going', 'write', 'review', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'said', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'had', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'great', 'movie.After', 'Speed', 'became', 'obsessed', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'rented', 'movie', 'watched', 'row', 'one', 'just', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'So', 'much', 'watched', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'just', 'understand', 'more', 'Society', 'think', 'only', 'people', 'prospects', 'commit', 'suicide', 'movie', 'even', 'have', 'everything', 'going', 'can', 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'Too', 'much', 'handle', 'point', 'where', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'handle', 'anything', 'know', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'David', 'suicide', 'how', 'friends', 'handle', 'grow', 'how', 'society', 'teenage', 'suicides.The', 'students', 'wanting', 'have', 'tribute', 'David', 'school', 'being', 'afraid', 'honoring', 'someone', 'who', 'commited', 'suicide', 'would', 'cause', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'also', 'seemed', 'believe', 'having', 'tribute', 'someone', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'personally', 'found', 'insulting', 'was', 'glad', 'end', 'students', 'found', 'own', 'way', 'memorializing', 'fallen', 'friend.Your', 'friends', 'may', 'lie', 'truth', 'can', 'come', 'strangers', 'life', 'long', 'not', 'made', 'measure', 'will', 'go', 'same', 'pain', 'pleasure', 'Wondering', 'how', 'ever', 'got', 'far', 'wishing', 'lucky', 'star']",N/A

Being a teenager is hard enough, but to have to deal with this kind of tragedy and the attendant emotional turmoil can almost be too much.I dare you to NOT get choked up when Keanu seeks comfort from the father of the dead teen (whose little brother Keanu nearly runs down with his car after a night of sorrow-drowning drinking), and again at the end of the film when the students finally use a very public forum to express their grief and pay tribute to their fallen friend.At least rent this film - you'll probably be tempted to buy it afterwards.",4,"Early Keanu film.

But the movie concentrates more on what David's close friends feel on his suicide. The film focuses heavily on Keanu Reeves character, Chris. He features in some of the film's most powerful scenes, and although he plays his Ted character, goofy and gangly, he really acts his socks off. He also features in an almost painful crying scene.There's a terrific song, which unfortunately isn't available. It's worked on throughout the film, but it really comes to light towards the end.

The film excels because it does not paint its characters in black and white -  teenagers do not have all the answers, and grown-ups are not  one-dimensional antagonists. The film basically focuses how on a group of  high school students react when their friend, an intelligent and well-liked  young man, takes his own life for no apparent reason. Permanent Record  contains Keanu Reeves' best performance to date as the suicide's best  friend, who tries to find answers as to why his friend took his own life,  and who feels guilty that he could not prevent this tragedy (the scene  where he finally expresses that guilt is particularly moving). Barry Corbin  (Northern Exposure) and Kathy Baker (Picket Fences) also give fine  performances as the parents of the suicide.

245585,A3SAU1A0IEYDNX,6301133412,Soaring Heart,"[38, 43]","&quot;PERMANENT RECORD&quot; is the story of how a suicide affects OTHER peoples' lives. The first time I viewed this I kept trying to figure out WHY David Sinclair (Alan Boyce) killed himself. That is not the focus of the film and is barely even touched upon.  I like countless other viewers I'm sure STILL really wanted to know WHY a bright, attractive, loving, popular, talented young man with EVERYTHING going for him would kill himself.  We just aren't supposed to understand.  LET GO OF THE &quot;WHY?!&quot; (very hard I know if you are at all like me! I want to know Why about Everything! Frustrating indeed!) and you will really enjoy this Amazing movie about Remembering but Moving On.PERMANENT RECORD opens at the ocean cliffs with all the teens hanging out together.  I could sense the closeness of the entire group: David, Chris (Keanu Reeves), MG (Michelle Meyrink), Kim (Pam Gidley), and Lauren (Jennifer Rubin) and others from the school--no words needed.  This movie contains one of the best casts I've ever come across; acting so superb it dominates all other movie components. Everyone was fantastic; however, Chris (Keanu) and Lauren (Jennifer) give the best performances humanly possible in my humble opinion.PERMANENT RECORD is about LIFE. (Ironic isn't it? Hmmmmm...) It's about fun and friendship, music and laughter, fear and anxiety, tension and tragedy, confusion and guilt, grief and anger, helplessness and regretfulness, acceptance and nostalgia, and finally after all those emotions have been taken to the extreme and exhausted, Then and ONLY THEN can you FINALLY MOVE ON...never forgetting though, mind you...just accepting--ACCEPTING IS SO HARD!!! I know but you can do it. You must. You must.Chris and David's relationship was very strong and deep but I think Chris doesn't realize how much he really loved David until he was gone--maybe that is the point. And although we don't see what happens to the others left behind, it is definitely implied,  to me anyway, that they go on to become Extraordinary because of the Experience.  Suffering is Very Painful but a necessary part of life that will make you stronger, you'll see.  It may also inspire you to do Great things once the raging, torrential, bitter storm clouds have finally...Finally...Passed.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. PERMANENT RECORD is wonderful from  start to finish and the ending couldn't have been better.  The title of the movie says it all.  It will leave a &quot;Permanent Record&quot; in your mind and heart that will not be soon forgotten.  Please pay close attention to the song playing at the ending/credits. &quot;Wishing on Another Lucky Star.&quot;_________________________________________________________________________Another awesome movie about suicide that I highly recommmend, maybe even more than this (!) is &quot;TRAGEDY&quot; with Molly Ringwald,  River Phoenix, Paul Sorvino, Ellen Burstyn and Marsha Mason.
