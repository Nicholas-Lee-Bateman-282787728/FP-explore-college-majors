It's got some of Elvis's great songs of the pre-Army days, a spirited little story with a happy ending, and while it's not as good as ""Jailhouse Rock,"" it's still one of his best.That said, however, I'm wondering why it is that this one is so much more expensive than any other Elvis movie on DVD. Most don't run more than $15; yet this one is listed at $79.99 -- I haven't seen a price like that on a DVD since early in the video age! It's not even Blu-Ray. Even entire seasons of television shows don't run this pricy anymore.I'm hoping it's a typo and that I can eventually get it, because right now, I can't justify that price, no matter how much I love Elvis!",3,More a Question than a Review,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,745,"['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'having', 'DVD', 'got', 'Elvis', 'great', 'songs', 'pre-Army', 'days', 'spirited', 'little', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'still', 'one', 'best.That', 'said', 'however', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', 'other', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'more', '15', 'yet', 'one', 'listed', '79.99', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'price', 'DVD', 'early', 'video', 'age', 'not', 'even', 'Blu-Ray', 'Even', 'entire', 'seasons', 'television', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'pricy', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'typo', 'can', 'eventually', 'get', 'right', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'price', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Elvis']",Loving You VHS

They're definitely in competition.This was before Wild in the Country and he's a better actor in this. Sad Wild came later. Elvis wasn't that good of an actor but he was an entertainer and he succeeds on that level in this movie.Unlike Wild, this movie moves at a good pace. It is loaded with songs, lipsynced but it's still fun to watch them. Elvis plays a troubled country boy whose talent is discovered by Lizabeth Scott. Even in 1957, Lizabeth was still beautiful. She plays a half villian type role. The noir movies in the 40's were more suited for her but she pulls this off okay. Dolores Hart, who later was cast in ""Where the Boys Are"", gives a nice performance also as a pretty innocent country girl.Wild in the Country is unintentionally funny all the way.

I suppose this was one reason why Elvis didnt watch this film much after the passing of his mom.There is nothing special abut the story ( its really his). The cast of Wendell Corey and Lizabeth Scott make it happen and adds some real character to the plot line. The songs , I think are Elvis, best.
