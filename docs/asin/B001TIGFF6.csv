1236509,A1QC1BTL48JITH,B001TIGFF6,"Brian C. Smyth ""B""","[3, 4]","Another random movie I decided to watch on Showtime. The Devil's Ground can be classified as a cheap horror movie that lacks punch. The story begins with a women name Carrie traveling down a dark road and almost runs over a young girl by the name of Amy. Amy appears to be covered in blood and was being chased in the woods by a hostile killer. Carrie decides to help Amy and as the two go down the road Amy explains that she was a environmentalist student at Boston University and she and four other classmates were sent out to Arrowhead to do some research where a mine collapsed on December 19th 1967 killing 239 coal miners. Before the students reached their destination they stopped at a gas station and were warned by the station attendant name Billy which had no arms. Billy told Amy that they were headed to ""The Devil's Playground"" and they should stay away. They proceeded to go on and ignore the warning and starting digging up bones that they believe belonged to the Indians. However they found teeth with gold fillings and a watch that was encrypted with the year 2002 so they realized that these deaths were more recent so they got all freaked out and decided to leave only be approached by this madmen that was trying to kill them. Amy tries to get back to to the gas station for help but only to find out she wasn't gonna get the help she expected.The plot of this movie is very basic and simple. Been there done that type of horror movie. The acting was decent at best but just a boring movie overall. The camera shots and editing were horrible. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and the killer looked like a goofball with his stupid mask. I wasn't intimidated by his presence at all. I mean if someone was chasing me with a machete I'd run too but that's besides the point. The only thing i really enjoyed about this film was the plot twist at the end. I thought I had it figured it out but then threw me for an extra loop. But come to think of it, it hints at it in the begging. That's the only pleasure in this film. Otherwise you're just watching a redundant horror flick and that's no fun!",2,Blah,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,2122,"['random', 'movie', 'decided', 'watch', 'Showtime', 'Devil', 'Ground', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'cheap', 'horror', 'movie', 'punch', 'story', 'women', 'name', 'Carrie', 'traveling', 'down', 'dark', 'road', 'almost', 'runs', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'be', 'covered', 'blood', 'was', 'being', 'chased', 'woods', 'hostile', 'killer', 'Carrie', 'help', 'Amy', 'two', 'go', 'road', 'Amy', 'was', 'environmentalist', 'student', 'Boston', 'University', 'four', 'other', 'classmates', 'were', 'sent', 'out', 'Arrowhead', 'do', 'research', 'where', 'mine', 'collapsed', 'December', '19th', '1967', 'killing', '239', 'coal', 'miners', 'students', 'reached', 'destination', 'stopped', 'gas', 'station', 'were', 'warned', 'station', 'attendant', 'name', 'Billy', 'had', 'arms', 'Billy', 'told', 'Amy', 'were', 'headed', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'proceeded', 'go', 'ignore', 'warning', 'starting', 'digging', 'up', 'bones', 'believe', 'belonged', 'Indians', 'However', 'found', 'teeth', 'gold', 'fillings', 'watch', 'was', 'encrypted', 'year', '2002', 'realized', 'deaths', 'were', 'more', 'recent', 'got', 'freaked', 'decided', 'leave', 'only', 'be', 'approached', 'madmen', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'Amy', 'get', 'back', 'gas', 'station', 'help', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'gon', 'get', 'help', 'plot', 'movie', 'very', 'basic', 'simple', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'type', 'horror', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'best', 'just', 'boring', 'movie', 'overall', 'camera', 'shots', 'editing', 'were', 'horrible', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'killer', 'looked', 'goofball', 'stupid', 'mask', 'was', ""n't"", 'intimidated', 'presence', 'mean', 'someone', 'was', 'chasing', 'machete', ""'d"", 'run', 'too', 'point', 'only', 'thing', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'thought', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'then', 'threw', 'extra', 'loop', 'come', 'think', 'begging', 'only', 'pleasure', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 'redundant', 'horror', 'flick', 'fun']","Devil's Ground, The"
