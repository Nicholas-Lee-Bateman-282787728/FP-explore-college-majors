1060542,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B000NTPGCA,O'Dryden,"[7, 8]","Wanted Dead or Alive is one of the best Western shows created during the golden era of TV Westerns in the late 50s and early 60s. In my opinion, Season 2 of Wanted Dead or Alive is the better of than Season 1. I have not seen Season 3 yet so I cannot comment on it. The main reason I prefer Season 2 is due to the change in demeanor and personality of the main character, Josh Randall. In this season, Josh Randall undergoes a major overhaul. In Season 1 he was a pretty normal and straight guy who didn't have much personality. In Season 2, Steve McQueen does a 180 degree turn and makes the Randall character a truly fascinating and somewhat humorous person. His dry sense of humor and perfect delivery of one-liners make the Randall character one of the most memorable and entertaining in TV Westerns history. I suspect this is one of the main reasons why the First Season finished at number 16 in the TV ratings while Season 2 finished at number 9. The plots are extremely well thought out and very suspenseful. If it's possible to put a human face on a bounty hunter, Wanted Dead or Alive does it. Randall's philosophy throughout each episode is basically this: If I bring you in, at least you'll get a fair trial. If someone else finds you, they'll simply kill you and collect the reward money. This makes Randall the bounty hunter seem like a compassionate and caring rescuer in comparison to the other bounty hunters. One strange thing about Season 2 is that near the end of the series, a side kick named Jason is introduced to help Randall track down wanted men. I prefer the show when Randall works alone. Giving screen time to Jason means less screen time for Randall resulting in a decrease of entertainment. Season 2 is well worth the investment.

Season Two is more sophisticated and ambitious. It also just gets better as the season progresses. McQueen fully shapes out his character and is beginning to become too big a star for a mere TV screen. However, he certainly displays his generosity as the intriguing and original character of Jason (played by Wright King) is introduced and is a part of the Wanted: Dead or Alive cast for several episodes. King is surprisingly likeable and interesting onscreen, considering he is sharing it with Steve McQueen. Perhaps McQueen was working on Never So Few and somewhat preoccupied, but hats off to him for allowing another character to play on his turf. Normally, I would just be annoyed that the writers would decrease my man McQueen's role for some upstart, but Wright King is really excellent in his character and I found myself looking forward to the next episode that continued the ""Jason"" storyline.

1060548,A1TYO8IC9950XA,B000NTPGCA,Stephen Gordon,"[3, 4]","As a Steve McQueen fan and remembering WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE from television when I was a kid, I was a little disappointed in Season One. It was a little perfunctory and McQueen was just starting his career. Considering that often the first season of any show can be a little weak until it establishes itself and its characters, I ordered the second Season and was glad I did so. McQueen's character was more developed and had more edge, the stories were more about bounty-hunting than the helpful saddletramp that McQueen was mainly in the first season, and overall the packaging was much better and the disks were one-sided (not double-sided as with the first season). Now I wish someone would bring out the other great Four Star Films, Inc show - RIFLEMAN - in its entirety and in a professionally done package rather than the Chinese version of 23 disks mostly recorded from TV that is available now.

1060549,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000NTPGCA,trebe,"[1, 1]","Film icon Steve McQueen returns as bounty hunter Josh Randall, in the second season of Wanted Dead or Alive.  Things get of to a slow start, as Randall is at first involved more in domestic matters than in corralling outlaws.  The producers may have wanted to emphasize the character's human side, however things soon get back to familiar ground, with Randall also employing a six gun, as well as his trademark mare's leg, in the pursuit of wanted men.  The quality of the writing is mostly good, but does slide bit at times, as Randall finds himself in some clich&eacute;d situations that he mostly avoided in season one.Rarely injured in season one, Randall takes a slew of bullets in season two.  Fortunately he's a fast healer.  At the end of `Reckless' (Episode 46), Randall gets shot in his left arm, then in the very next episode (`Desert Seed'), he gets shot again in the precredit opening scene.  He is nicked on the arm in `Pariah' (Episode 63), and then his skull is grazed in `Vendetta' (Episode 64).  In `Jason' (Episode 57) he takes his most serious hit, and is taken out of action.  This episode, introduces the character Jason Nichols (Wright King), a lawman who wants Randall to help him to become a bounty hunter.  The writers finished off Season Two, teaming Josh with Jason Nichols, in nine of the last twelve episodes.  Perhaps giving Randall a partner was a change the writers were contemplating making in season three.  If so, it is fortunate that it did not happen, as Josh Randall operates best alone.  Jason Nichols, while mildly likeable, does not really have particularly good chemistry with Randall.Some noteworthy episodes include, `Black Belt', where on the trail of a man who is an expert in karate, Randall receives a blow that almost kills him.  An interesting situation arises in `Tolliver Bender', where Randall uses Jason Nichols as collateral, to `borrow' a condemned man so he can testify and save the life of a friend.  In `The Tyrant', Josh helps free a town from the grip of a dictatorial marshal.  Running afoul of the law, Randall ends up working in a gold mine in `Chain Gang'.  `The Monster' is a farfetched tale where an elephant is apparently being used as a tool for robbery.  `Vendetta' is a poorly written adventure, where after Josh has his prisoner taken from him by a deranged army officer.  He is conscripted by the army to relieve that same officer of command.  In `Prison Trail', Josh and Jason face danger while escorting four prisoners to Leavenworth prison.The thirty two episodes of Season Two are on four single sided discs with eight episodes each.  The episodes now have chapter stops.  No colorized versions this time.  The lone bonus is the short featurette, The Women of Wanted Dead or Alive, which unfortunately doesn't have much substance.  Women are an interesting subject, as Randall doesn't have much time for the ladies.  He has no inclination to settle down, and women often appear just for decorative purposes.  When a female is actively involved in the story, unfortunately for Randall, she often turns out to have bad intentions toward him.  Females who murder are a common occurrence on this program, perhaps serving as a reflection of Randall's ethical code.If you liked the first season, Season Two delivers much of the same.  The writing, while still creative, shows signs of taking the easy way out, and Josh gets shot up a lot.  Giving Randall a companion was an experiment with mixed results, and he would be back on his own, for the final season of Wanted Dead or Alive.",4,wounded in action . . .,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3555,"['Film', 'icon', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Josh', 'Randall', 'second', 'season', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Things', 'get', 'slow', 'start', 'Randall', 'first', 'involved', 'more', 'domestic', 'matters', 'corralling', 'outlaws', 'producers', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'character', 'human', 'side', 'however', 'things', 'soon', 'get', 'back', 'familiar', 'ground', 'Randall', 'also', 'employing', 'six', 'gun', 'as', 'well', 'trademark', 'mare', 'leg', 'pursuit', 'wanted', 'men', 'quality', 'writing', 'mostly', 'good', 'slide', 'bit', 'times', 'Randall', 'clich', 'eacute', 'situations', 'mostly', 'avoided', 'season', 'one.Rarely', 'injured', 'season', 'one', 'Randall', 'slew', 'bullets', 'season', 'two', 'Fortunately', 'fast', 'healer', 'end', 'Reckless', 'Episode', '46', 'Randall', 'shot', 'left', 'arm', 'then', 'very', 'next', 'episode', 'Desert', 'Seed', 'shot', 'again', 'precredit', 'opening', 'scene', 'nicked', 'arm', 'Pariah', 'Episode', '63', 'then', 'skull', 'grazed', 'Vendetta', 'Episode', '64', 'Jason', 'Episode', '57', 'most', 'serious', 'hit', 'taken', 'action', 'episode', 'character', 'Jason', 'Nichols', 'Wright', 'King', 'lawman', 'who', 'Randall', 'help', 'become', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'writers', 'finished', 'off', 'Season', 'Two', 'teaming', 'Josh', 'Jason', 'Nichols', 'nine', 'last', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Perhaps', 'giving', 'Randall', 'partner', 'was', 'change', 'writers', 'were', 'contemplating', 'making', 'season', 'three', 'so', 'fortunate', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Josh', 'Randall', 'best', 'alone', 'Jason', 'Nichols', 'mildly', 'likeable', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'particularly', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Randall.Some', 'noteworthy', 'episodes', 'include', 'Black', 'Belt', 'where', 'trail', 'man', 'who', 'expert', 'karate', 'Randall', 'blow', 'almost', 'interesting', 'situation', 'arises', 'Tolliver', 'Bender', 'where', 'Randall', 'Jason', 'Nichols', 'collateral', 'borrow', 'condemned', 'man', 'can', 'testify', 'save', 'life', 'friend', 'Tyrant', 'Josh', 'free', 'town', 'grip', 'dictatorial', 'marshal', 'Running', 'afoul', 'law', 'Randall', 'up', 'working', 'gold', 'mine', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'Monster', 'farfetched', 'tale', 'where', 'elephant', 'apparently', 'being', 'used', 'tool', 'robbery', 'Vendetta', 'poorly', 'written', 'adventure', 'where', 'Josh', 'prisoner', 'taken', 'deranged', 'army', 'officer', 'conscripted', 'army', 'relieve', 'same', 'officer', 'command', 'Prison', 'Trail', 'Josh', 'Jason', 'face', 'danger', 'escorting', 'four', 'prisoners', 'Leavenworth', 'prison.The', 'thirty', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Two', 'are', 'four', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'eight', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'now', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'colorized', 'versions', 'time', 'lone', 'bonus', 'short', 'featurette', 'Women', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'substance', 'Women', 'are', 'interesting', 'subject', 'Randall', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'ladies', 'inclination', 'settle', 'down', 'women', 'often', 'appear', 'just', 'decorative', 'purposes', 'When', 'female', 'actively', 'involved', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'Randall', 'often', 'out', 'have', 'bad', 'intentions', 'Females', 'who', 'murder', 'are', 'common', 'occurrence', 'program', 'perhaps', 'serving', 'reflection', 'Randall', 'ethical', 'code.If', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'Season', 'Two', 'delivers', 'much', 'same', 'writing', 'still', 'creative', 'signs', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'Josh', 'shot', 'up', 'lot', 'Giving', 'companion', 'was', 'experiment', 'mixed', 'results', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'own', 'final', 'season', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive']",Wanted: Dead or Alive - Season Two
