241326,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,630098866X,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","One of the most memorable moments in Star Trek occurs in this episode. Two aliens, each half-white and half-black, make the Enterprise their battlefield. Kirk and Spock try to mediate. Spock says, ""Your war is surprising, given your genetic similarity."" The alien responds, ""Are you blind? I'm white on the right side. He is white on the left side!""Bravo! Differences that seem trivial to any rational observer take on significance to groups looking for any excuse to hate each other. This is what the original show did best: use interstellar allegory to comment on the issues of the 1960s. Yet the message is timeless... Are racism and bigotry still with us? You bet! These aliens could be Sunnis vs. Shiites, Sikhs vs. Hindus, or Serbs vs. Bosnians. Whatever.Two other things make this episode worth watching: 1) the guest performances by Frank Gorshin (representing the authoritarian faction) and Lou Antonio (representing the rebel faction) are strong, and each is well cast... Gorshin doing a sly turn that is sneering and arrogant, while Antonio is appropriately angry. 2) The centerpiece of the episode is a battle of wills between Commissioner Beal (Gorshin) and Captain Kirk for control of the ship. Beal's powers enable to him to take control of the helm, to take his ""prisoner,"" Loki, back to their home planet. Kirk's only option to is to threaten to make the ship self-destruct.That's not as silly as it sounds. The conflict results in an exceptionally tense, dramatic scene. What's wonderful is that it uses technology but doesn't depend on technology to resolve the dilemma. It's really about the characters' choices. Writers would revisit this famous self-destruct concept at the end of Star Trek III.The episode is not without flaws. The aliens are obviously wearing face paint, like Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer. The tight trousers they wear (their costumes are deliberately made identical) show all-too-obvious bulges. But maybe that's intended; these are overtly male characters bent on aggressive behavior. Perhaps the biggest flaw is that the ending isn't fully satisfying. Kirk manages to get the Enterprise to its rendevous to innoculate a planet (saving a few billion people we never see) but nothing can be done to stop Beal and Loki from destroying each other. In that, Kirk fails.But maybe that was the point. What can be done against such relentless hate?",4,"If You're Half-White, You're Alright??",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2384,"['One', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Two', 'aliens', 'half-white', 'half-black', 'make', 'Enterprise', 'battlefield', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'try', 'mediate', 'Spock', 'war', 'surprising', 'given', 'genetic', 'similarity', 'alien', 'Are', ""'m"", 'white', 'right', 'side', 'white', 'left', 'side', 'Bravo', 'Differences', 'seem', 'trivial', 'rational', 'observer', 'take', 'significance', 'groups', 'looking', 'excuse', 'hate', 'other', 'what', 'original', 'show', 'did', 'best', 'use', 'interstellar', 'allegory', 'comment', 'issues', '1960s', 'message', 'timeless', 'Are', 'racism', 'bigotry', 'still', 'bet', 'aliens', 'could', 'be', 'Sunnis', 'vs.', 'Shiites', 'Sikhs', 'vs.', 'Hindus', 'Serbs', 'Bosnians', 'Whatever.Two', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'episode', 'worth', 'watching', '1', 'guest', 'performances', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'representing', 'authoritarian', 'faction', 'Lou', 'Antonio', 'representing', 'rebel', 'faction', 'are', 'strong', 'well', 'cast', 'Gorshin', 'doing', 'sly', 'turn', 'sneering', 'arrogant', 'Antonio', 'appropriately', 'angry', '2', 'centerpiece', 'episode', 'battle', 'wills', 'Commissioner', 'Beal', 'Gorshin', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'control', 'ship', 'Beal', 'powers', 'enable', 'take', 'control', 'helm', 'take', 'prisoner', 'Loki', 'back', 'home', 'planet', 'Kirk', 'only', 'option', 'threaten', 'make', 'ship', 'self-destruct.That', 'not', 'as', 'silly', 'conflict', 'results', 'exceptionally', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'What', 'wonderful', 'technology', ""n't"", 'depend', 'technology', 'resolve', 'dilemma', 'really', 'characters', 'choices', 'Writers', 'would', 'revisit', 'famous', 'self-destruct', 'concept', 'end', 'Star', 'Trek', 'III.The', 'episode', 'not', 'flaws', 'aliens', 'are', 'obviously', 'wearing', 'face', 'paint', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'tight', 'trousers', 'wear', 'costumes', 'are', 'deliberately', 'made', 'identical', 'show', 'all-too-obvious', 'bulges', 'maybe', 'intended', 'are', 'overtly', 'male', 'characters', 'bent', 'aggressive', 'behavior', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'ending', ""n't"", 'fully', 'satisfying', 'Kirk', 'get', 'Enterprise', 'rendevous', 'innoculate', 'planet', 'saving', 'few', 'billion', 'people', 'never', 'see', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'stop', 'Beal', 'Loki', 'destroying', 'other', 'Kirk', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'such', 'relentless', 'hate']",N/A
241327,A1S3C5OFU508P3,630098866X,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","Subtle is the last possible word that could be used to describe this episode. It is blunt and a bit over the top in making a point about race hatred. It all begins with the Enterprise pursuing a shuttlecraft stolen from Starbase 4. After a tractor beam brings the craft on board the Enterprise, a being from Cheron (Lokai), with one side of his face white and the other black, staggers out and collapses on the deck. He is immediately taken to sick bay where Spock and McCoy are in agreement that his coloration is a genetic anomaly, a one-of-a-kind. When Lokai awakens, he is arrogant, feeling that it was his need that gave him the right to use the shuttlecraft.The Enterprise proceeds on mission when an unknown vessel approaches. While the sensors can detect it, there is no visual confirmation and when the vessel is destroyed, another, similar creature (Bele) appears on the bridge. He immediately announces that he is a law enforcement officer and he has been pursuing the criminal Lokai for thousands of years. Kirk refuses to hand Lokai over and Bele uses his mental powers to take over the ship. Kirk then begins to execute his threat to engage the autodestruct and when Bele is unable to stop it, acquiesces to giving control back to Kirk.The Enterprise completes its assigned mission and then Bele once again takes over the ship, which proceeds to Cheron. When they arrive, they discover that everyone on the planet is dead, having killed each other in a vast race war. In this case the racial differences are not in coloration but in location. While both Lokai and Bele are black on one side and white on the other, one is black on the right side and the other black on the left side. One after the other, they beam down to the surface of Cheron to engage in the last, pitiful battle of a race war that can only end in the deaths of everyone on the planet.The performance of Frank Gorshin as Bele is what made this episode work, his intonation and facial expressions drive home the point that this is a police officer who will stop at nothing to capture his prey. Gorshin is best known as ""The Riddler"" in the campy Batman series, and those same talents are demonstrated in his portrayal of Bele. It is a hard episode; neither of the protagonists generates much sympathy in you. They have only their hatred of the other and their only goal is to satisfy this perverted desire. It is also notable that this episode introduces the autodestruct potential built into the Enterprise. This feature was a fundamental plot necessity in a subsequent movie and in the ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" series.",4,"An in-your-face commentary about racial hatreds, superb performance by Frank Gorshin",1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,2610,"['Subtle', 'last', 'possible', 'word', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'episode', 'blunt', 'bit', 'top', 'making', 'point', 'race', 'hatred', 'Enterprise', 'pursuing', 'shuttlecraft', 'stolen', 'Starbase', '4', 'tractor', 'beam', 'craft', 'board', 'Enterprise', 'being', 'Cheron', 'Lokai', 'one', 'side', 'face', 'white', 'other', 'black', 'staggers', 'out', 'collapses', 'deck', 'immediately', 'taken', 'sick', 'bay', 'where', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'are', 'agreement', 'coloration', 'genetic', 'anomaly', 'one-of-a-kind', 'When', 'Lokai', 'arrogant', 'feeling', 'was', 'need', 'gave', 'right', 'use', 'shuttlecraft.The', 'Enterprise', 'proceeds', 'mission', 'when', 'unknown', 'vessel', 'approaches', 'sensors', 'can', 'detect', 'visual', 'confirmation', 'when', 'vessel', 'destroyed', 'similar', 'creature', 'Bele', 'bridge', 'immediately', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'been', 'pursuing', 'criminal', 'Lokai', 'thousands', 'years', 'Kirk', 'hand', 'Lokai', 'Bele', 'mental', 'powers', 'take', 'over', 'ship', 'Kirk', 'then', 'execute', 'threat', 'engage', 'autodestruct', 'when', 'Bele', 'unable', 'stop', 'giving', 'control', 'back', 'Kirk.The', 'Enterprise', 'assigned', 'mission', 'then', 'Bele', 'once', 'again', 'ship', 'Cheron', 'When', 'arrive', 'discover', 'everyone', 'planet', 'dead', 'having', 'killed', 'other', 'vast', 'race', 'war', 'case', 'racial', 'differences', 'are', 'not', 'coloration', 'location', 'Lokai', 'Bele', 'are', 'black', 'one', 'side', 'white', 'other', 'one', 'black', 'right', 'side', 'other', 'black', 'left', 'side', 'One', 'other', 'beam', 'down', 'surface', 'Cheron', 'engage', 'last', 'pitiful', 'battle', 'race', 'war', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'deaths', 'everyone', 'planet.The', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'Bele', 'what', 'made', 'episode', 'work', 'intonation', 'facial', 'expressions', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'capture', 'prey', 'Gorshin', 'best', 'known', 'Riddler', 'campy', 'Batman', 'series', 'same', 'talents', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'portrayal', 'Bele', 'hard', 'episode', 'protagonists', 'much', 'sympathy', 'have', 'only', 'hatred', 'other', 'only', 'goal', 'satisfy', 'perverted', 'desire', 'also', 'notable', 'episode', 'autodestruct', 'potential', 'built', 'Enterprise', 'feature', 'was', 'fundamental', 'plot', 'necessity', 'subsequent', 'movie', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'series']",N/A

Taken aboard the ship, Lokai tells the crew he is from the planet Cheron, and asks for asylum on the U.S.S.  Enterprise. His most distinctive feature is that he is half black and half  white, starkly separated down the middle of his body.  The U.S.S.  Enterprise tracks another vessel, pursuing at great speed. The ship's only  passenger beams on board and is discovers to be another humanoid from  Cheron. The difference in this man, Bele, is that his black and white skin  is reversed from Lokai's. Bele claims to be Cheron's chief officer sent out  to bring in political traitors, and has been pursuing Lokai. The more the  two men are aboard the starship, the more Kirk realizes that the basic  problem between them... and their entire race, apparently... is their  opposite color. Tiring of their bigotry, Kirk decides to ignore the two  guests and concentrate on his original mission; to decontaminate the planet  Ariannus, plagued with a bacteria that endangers billions of lives.  When  Bele takes control of the U.S.S. Enterprise in a desperate attempt, Kirk  sets the ships auto-destruct sequence instead of allowing the hijacking to  continue, and the alien returns command to the captain. However, once  planet Ariannus is decontaminated, Bele takes back his control over the  starship and leads it back to Cheron. What they find is a long-dead planet,  annihilated by their interracial bigotry. Lokai beams down to the surface  to escape Bele, who follows. The U.S.S.

Indeed, this is the closest original Trek ever got to telling people how to be politically correct, but in this case it's justified, immensely well told, and there are little gems of dialogue scattered all over the place in this episode.  And, quite frankly, having seen it a thousand times or for the very first time, it takes little time for the viewer to be caught up in the intrigue and kept hooked thanks to the dialogue and quality of the actors' performances.Even when there are obvious gaffes:* Spock thinks Lokai's color scheme is impossible and goes through the range of human pigmentations, but has he never seen a zebra?!  Such a dual skin tone is hardly unique, impossible, or anything else.* Spock doesn't see the difference between Lokai and Bele (one is black on the right side, the other is black on the left)* The conservative element (Bele) is ""right on the white side"" - that and subsequent dialogue making an (incorrect) inference that only white is right.I'll ignore the obvious re-use of Enterprise shuttlecraft footage.  This was the no-budget season 3, which had to rely far more on character than what any special effect could do to carry.But later, Spock (who's otherwise remarkably obtuse in this episode) points out to Lokai that, for all Lokai's talk of revolution and ""justice"", Lokai himself doesn't seem to want to put in his own weight; thereby diminishing his credibility.  The whole scene is so well thought out, it more than makes up for the earlier gaffes.  It defines the story.Given this was season 3, with no budget and time available, what was made is astonishingly good and that needs to be taken into account.This episode is a winner.
