193346,AY1G069JXU49L,160399405X,"A. Thankful ""RolyPolyBear""","[24, 24]","I received this as a Mother's Day gift after I got hooked on Molly from the previously released Goldbergs that amazon sells.  What I can't get over is how all of these episodes are so fresh and timeless!  Molly was addressing issues such as plastic surgery, jealousy, infidelity, weight-loss and many other topics way before anybody and dealing with it all in a very tasteful, motherly way.  If you are someone who grew up with lots of family visiting you and remember every little quirk about your relatives, this will ""bring you back home again"".  What is interesting is that there are a few episodes that are repeat scripts, yet they are filmed once in the Bronx and again in the town of Haverville Connecticut with slight changes to the story, yet you can watch both and enjoy the range all these talented actors had.(i.e. episode 10 from Disc 1 is the same as episode 46 from Disc 4) Gertrude Berg was a wonderful talent and I think there was/is no one like her.  Her ability to capture something about life and it's nuances in a family, be it in the city or the suburbs, was so remarkable!  I never knew about this show until a year or so and I really have enjoyed all of it except maybe the one episode entitled ""Molly's Dreams"" from 1955.  There was a lot of emerging psychobabble at the time and psychoanalyzing everything was becoming as redundant as Mia Farrow in a Woody Allen movie...  But I digress...I was searching for something that embodied all the wonderful warmth of a family (think Radio Days without the smutty stupid parts) and I found it in Molly and Jake and Uncle David and Rosie and Sammy and Tante Elka etc...  And don't think you need to be Jewish to enjoy/like this program, because I think it transcends all that.  What it is is family and warmth and Molly embodies that person who wants to not only take care of everybody, but make sure everybody knows they are loved, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness... She has the best and kindest heart and I really enjoyed that the most.  When she gets hurt, you just want to comfort her.  When she talks to you through her window about Rybutol or Sanka or whatever else she had to sell for a commercial, you feel she is really speaking to you and that you matter to her.  What a switch from anything that ""Follywood"" cranks out today!!!  You want to see real tv with real people?  Give this program a try!  You'll be glad you did!!!  Discover a lost treasure and lose yourself embraced by a family and some gefilte fish and chicken noodle soup and Tzimmes and chicken liver and all of Molly's witty ways of saying things...I call them ""Molly-isms""... You'll see, and if you don't buy it, well I have two words, to coin a phrase from Molly...""Foolish, no?"" Also please realize that there is an error in the book included with the product...Steve McQueen is actually in the episode 54 entitled Rosie the Actress and NOT episode 56 entitled David's Cousin.  Just one more morsel before I go, for those of you who have enjoyed the Christmas Rankin Bass special with Heat Miser and his chilly brother, in episode 44 Die Fledermaus, you can see the man who did the voice of Heat Miser in his role as a singing butcher...Toodlee-yoo!",5,MAZEL TOV!

193348,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,160399405X,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 3]","Though admittedly poor entertainment when compared with television as we know it today, The Goldbergs represent programming that was popular in 1949. This episode dates back to August 1949 and reflects a much simpler form of comedy. The premise for this show is based on a jewish family living in NYC and it centers on the heart of the family Molly Goldberg (portrayed by Gertrude Berg who was also the show's creator and writer). Supported by her husband (actor Phillip Loeb) and a son and a daughter, it takes a look at everyday life. The episode I viewed centered on people misrepresenting themselves.The episode begins with the credits rolling and a good view of early sponsor product placement (a Sanka can being used as a flowerpot). Molly segues into a three way conversation with her two neighbors through her apartment window which essentially sets up the episode. The viewer is informed that Molly has just returned from a summer vacation in the Catskills. Her husband has met Alex Reitman, a wealthy businessman who is going to go into some sort of venture involving the manufacture of pajamas. Alex has been invited to dinner and to impress Molly's cousin Simon they also invite Simon. The episode is set-up in such a way that begs the question 'is Reitman a con man or phony?'. The ensuing program attempts to grapple with that question.At the end of the program Molly returns to the window and does a two minute monologue about Sanka after she philosophizes about people exagerating their own importance while on holiday.Not great comedy by any measure, but in its heyday this was a popular program. The picture quality is pretty good; the sets look like cardboard flyaways. The acting is at times o.k. and at times really stagey.None the less, I found this interesting. It makes the ancient episodes of I Love Lucy look sophisticated by comparison and illustrates how quickly the medium evolved.",3,Interesting Look At A Early Sitcom,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1910,"['admittedly', 'poor', 'entertainment', 'when', 'compared', 'television', 'know', 'today', 'Goldbergs', 'represent', 'programming', 'was', 'popular', '1949', 'episode', 'back', 'August', '1949', 'much', 'simpler', 'form', 'comedy', 'premise', 'show', 'based', 'jewish', 'family', 'living', 'NYC', 'heart', 'family', 'Molly', 'Goldberg', 'portrayed', 'Gertrude', 'Berg', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'show', 'creator', 'writer', 'Supported', 'husband', 'actor', 'Phillip', 'Loeb', 'son', 'daughter', 'look', 'everyday', 'life', 'episode', 'viewed', 'centered', 'people', 'misrepresenting', 'themselves.The', 'episode', 'credits', 'rolling', 'good', 'view', 'early', 'sponsor', 'product', 'placement', 'Sanka', 'can', 'being', 'used', 'flowerpot', 'Molly', 'three', 'way', 'conversation', 'two', 'neighbors', 'apartment', 'window', 'essentially', 'up', 'episode', 'viewer', 'informed', 'Molly', 'just', 'returned', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Catskills', 'husband', 'met', 'Alex', 'Reitman', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'who', 'going', 'go', 'sort', 'venture', 'involving', 'manufacture', 'pajamas', 'Alex', 'been', 'invited', 'dinner', 'impress', 'Molly', 'cousin', 'Simon', 'also', 'invite', 'Simon', 'episode', 'set-up', 'such', 'way', 'question', 'Reitman', 'con', 'man', 'phony', 'ensuing', 'program', 'attempts', 'grapple', 'end', 'program', 'Molly', 'window', 'two', 'minute', 'monologue', 'Sanka', 'people', 'exagerating', 'own', 'importance', 'holiday.Not', 'great', 'comedy', 'measure', 'heyday', 'was', 'popular', 'program', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'sets', 'look', 'cardboard', 'flyaways', 'acting', 'times', 'o.k', 'times', 'really', 'stagey.None', 'less', 'found', 'interesting', 'ancient', 'episodes', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'look', 'sophisticated', 'comparison', 'how', 'quickly', 'medium', 'evolved']",N/A

The 2 uncles get into it in very clever dialogue about some family issues, which ultimately resolves. I won't spoil it. It is vintage &#34;The Goldbergs,&#34; except the sponsor is not Sanka but RCA.

This, along with MAMA, was basic television in the late forties and early fifties when I was a small child growing up.

Molly Goldberg (Gertrude Berg, who also wrote the series), is a housewife in the Bronx, living with her husband Jake, son Sammy, daughter Rosalie and tenant Uncle David. These are first generation Jews who want the best for their children and who will destroy the English language in their desire to use words properly. (Their mangling of words is both humorous and endearing as they try so hard to assimilate while, at the same time, keeping true to their heritage.)  The device of Molly leaning out the window and talking to the viewers as she does her other friends, pulls us into her life and makes her and her family our friends. These were the lucky ones who had made it to these shores before the holocaust, and the warmth of the Goldberg family made Jewish Americans feel more accepted as it also did a lot to dispel the feeling of anti-Semitism found in many xenophobic Americans of the day.What a joy to see these primitive shows; no wide screen, no color no 3-D, just warm loving family stories.
