She doesn't love herself because she is too desperate to get a man. If she really loved the guy, she would have gotten his autograph, a picture, a few clothes, some shoes, anything but the man himself. I don't think you should take things that are very valuable. Ideally, they would be things he can easily replace...well, not completely. You be the judge. Just try to be nice. Anyway, it's just like Abba's song One Man, One Woman. She should have respected his married status; besides, there are other fish in the sea as ""they"" say. She needed to get a new job elsewhere, be on some antipsychotic drug as well as an antidepressant and something to help her sleep for a long time, listen to great music, watch great movies, read great books, make herself productive to society, have a good cry, go to a gym, take a walk, etc. But she was too desperate. She needed to know that there's nothing wrong with being single because when you're single, you get to think about the state of the world and what you can do to make it better, not just yourself. It's unhealthy to be needy, and they already had a child. She needed to respect that. I thought she got what she deserved at the end. You should never obsess over someone you're never going to have or even the ones you can have 'cause it's not healthy. I noticed the interracial friendship, which was nice. The caucasian guy looked out for his 'black' American/African-American friend. He knew that you should measure the worth of a person by the individual character, not race. Idris Elba was terrific, and so was his caucasian friend so I'll add one more star. I will not recommend this film because she tried to break a home.

This movie was good.Maybe it WAS a re-tread of some movies but it was still very entertaining, with bits and pieces of goodness on the way until the finale which was just short of excellence.Every one of the main characters acted their butts off, and that includes the deranged temp who was in love with B's man.The movie starts off with her and her husband moving into a beautiful (and big) house, where they plan on spending a great deal of their lives together. They move in with their young son and make things cozy. Edris goes to work quite often and brings home the bacon as Beyonc&eacute; provides a stay-at-home environment for her child, Kyle (or is it Cal?

However, the lack of an R rating really hinders it from becoming spectacular. The movie has its slow low points, but overall, it was an effective thriller with some titillating tension between the actors and actresses. Of course, Ali Later steals the film. One minute without her crazy antics on screen just feels like a life time. The director made an excellent executive decision by keeping Beyonce's screen time to a minimum. The girl has always had and will always have way too much country swagger and after all this time in Hollywood, she has yet to drop it. It's like the winner of Americas Next Top Model not being able to drop the accent in order to do an effective CoverGirl commercial. When Beyonce utters the line: That gurl mayba alotta thangs, but she aint plain - Just makes me want to cringe. There is a comma in that sentence. Please, pause Beyonce. This is a movie, not a song your singing or a track on your CD where you are trying to carry a tune. Someone please get her an acting coach!I'll give a quick recap of the store, but will not go into full detail, as everyone else's review already has. Derek and Beyonce are a happily married couple that just moved into their new house. On his way to work he bumps into, Lisa, on the elevator and thinks that she's a model. However, she is actually the new temp in the office & it just so happens to be the same office as Derek's. Slowly but surely, she weasels her way to the assistant's desk outside his office & listens in on his calls, goes through his music collection, doesn't give him messages from his wife's missed calls, and so forth. Pretty much the madness ensues since her arrival. I have to hand it to Ali who really deserves an award because she plays crazy Lisa to a tee! Of course, all the girls and gays went crazy for the final showdown scene between the two GURLS! Everyone loves a cat fight & that was one of the major highlights of the movie. Except, it was ruined by Beyonce being ridiculous and insisting the scene be done with her wearing high heels!Overall, this is a great thriller! I know the reviewers have been trashing this movie left and right. I don't understand what their problem is. I guess they were all looking for the next Fatal Attraction. If that's the case, this isn't it. But if you like silly over the top fun in the vein of ShowGirls, then this is the movie for you.

Beyonce and Idris are a young couple who are in love and trouble comes in the form of obsessive Ali Larter as Lisa Sheridan who is a temp in Idris's office. She becomes obsessed with Idris and trouble ensues. It is up to the wife, to take matters in her hands.I thought the movie was badly directed with no chemistry between Idris and Beyonce.

1262494,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002CAWNDS,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 7]","I kind of like this movie.Seriously, this movie is kind of stupid yet completely entertaining.  I was really floored with how much enjoyment (cheap and slightly guilty I will admit) I got out of this movie.  My wife and I happened to catch this while lazing it up on our last vacation, and while I was not initially interested in watching the film at all I must say that it held my attention and then some.Yes, the film is kind of a cheap knock off of `Fatal Attraction' with inferior acting and plot development, but it doesn't matter.The film follows a successful man named Derek who happens to land in the evil and manipulative clutches of Lisa, a hot temp who has a thing for him.  The thing is, Derek is married.  He has a family.  He isn't interested (well, at least not to such a degree that he would jeopardize what he has for her).  Lisa is very interested, so much so that she goes all sorts of bat-poop crazy and starts wrecking Derek's life, one ridiculous move after another.  With Derek's family on the line, things start getting pretty intense...and then, well, you have Sharon, Derek's wife; and she isn't content with `sitting pretty'.Yes, there are many moments in this film that are unintentionally funny (Beyonce alone is unintentionally funny) but it doesn't matter.  Nothing matters here.  The film is fun.  Aside from Beyonce's ridiculous performance, and Ali's obvious overacting (I miss the days when she was a fresh face with lots of untapped potential) there is a surprisingly deep performance delivered by Idris Elba.  Seriously, this is far from what I expected.  He adds layers of authenticity to Derek's situation, and you can feel each emotional connection he has on full display here.  It is a performance that is far above the material, which also makes this film somewhat of a hidden gem.Go figure.So, the movie is not a masterwork of any kind, but when it comes of mindless popcorn thrillers, this one is better than average in the fact that it actually entertains more than it insults our intelligence.  Sure, I gave it a C, but that is a C+ with a very strong recommendation.

I was willing to give it a try. While Obsessed isn't nearly the thriller of the Glen Close/Michael Douglas movie, it isn't as terrible as it could have been.The plot is predictable and it is unfortunate that they didn't at least TRY to make it stand out from similar films. There were some excellent opportunities to create ""I didn't see that coming"" moments - you know, the kind that make a film stick out, or become a must-buy for your DVD library. This movie was written closely to the formula - sort of like Harlequin novels; no deviation, no surprises. The end scene where the wife is finally facing off with the obsessive freak goes on WAY too long and runs into the ridiculous.I always love Ali Larter as a psychopath and she really shines in this film - more so than the other actors. Beyonce Knowles was surprisingly good; I was expecting a lot worse.That said, I still liked Obsessed. There was a certain deviant charm to it that resonated with the thriller genre lover inside. It isn't nearly as bad as other films I've seen this year, including the absolutely horrendousSins of The Father.

Eventually it leads to the woman making unexpected visits to the guys home.The storyline is a bit predictable which is why I'm taking away one point, but as far as utter suspense and keeping me glued to the television screen goes, YES!

1262503,A672SQEY05LPN,B002CAWNDS,Buddy Love,"[6, 7]","This movie seemed like a combination of Jungle Fever, with a twist of Fatal Attraction, and Wall Street, all in one. I liked the strong commitment minded role Derek portrayed of rejecting Lisa's advances. Usually these interracial plots are portrayed in the script, by weak black men characters. Black men that are desperate, and on a mission to get with white women. And eventually permanently taking themselves off the dating market of availability, towards black women. Black men portrayed as big, strong, and dumb, with jungle fever.It was refreshing to see a strong, committed, black family man, finally resist a white woman for a change. Refreshing to see him stay loyal to his marriage, and try to keep his family together. It was especially uplifting to see that Derek was successful, and nowhere near as insecure, or as weak like Tiger Woods. (The self-proclaimed Cau-Blin-Asian). The Tiger Woods type would have quickly given in to Lisa, by grinning and pretending, and secretly fornicating with this woman, to escape his obvious blackness.Derek was the perfect example of what to do when you are tall, dark, handsome, financially successful, being pursued, stalked, bullied, by an overly aggressive woman. I was hoping that Derek did not give up, nor give in to Lisa. She had a smile that could win over the weak, she had very sexy, and graceful, body language, with natural rhythm. She was very convincing for the mentally ill part that she portrayed. Beyonce showed the ugly disrespectful side of some black women, and why some successful black men gravitate to other women. Beyonce expected Derek to remain faithful to her, while he was put out the house and suffering emotionally, all while he kept a roof over her head.In real life situations, most unemployed wives, would not put their six figure salary husbands out for 3 months, after just purchasing their first dream home. I found out the Executive Producers of the film also included Beyonce Knowles, and basket ball great Magic Johnson. They've continued the cinematic expectation, exploitation, and mammy-fication, of the angry black woman syndrome. Beyonce blinded herself to the truth of Derek's complete innocence, and showed excessive anger, insecurity, cursing out, fussing, behavior just as mentally unstable, and unpredictable, as Lunatic Lisa. When the movie first came on, Beyonce played difficult to get in bed, and was trying to get out of knowing Derek.The ultimate showdown between Beyonce and Lisa, was not believable on behalf of Beyonce's weak script. Beyonce offered her kind hand, in a last ditch effort to save Lisa from falling over 30 feet to her death, when the attic floor caved in. Lisa had invaded Beyonce's home, and was trying to kill her, and Beyonce decided to try and save Lisa's life. Executive producer Beyonce, gave herself the script of playing a good samaritan, by trying to save Lisa as she dangled from the high ceiling. Lisa decided to grab Beyonce's hand, but not to save herself, but to try and pull Beyonce down also, so both would fall to their deaths, and neither would be with Derek. The attitude that if I can't have him, you can't live to have him either.Overall a different outcome of a growing black men, white women phenomenon. Idris Elba was the perfect actor for the part of Derek, Ali Larter was the perfect actress for the part of Lisa. Beyonce unknowingly played the perfect part to explain why some black women, force black men to bolt out the back door, to be with other women. The baby did not look like Derek or Beyonce, could have ever been his parents. The movie looked great on Blu-ray, and the soundtrack was mysterious but perfect, for the fatal attraction, demented role that Lisa portrayed very convincingly.",4,"Suicidal, Demented Desperation, Demonic Femme Fatale!",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,3747,"['movie', 'seemed', 'combination', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'twist', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Wall', 'Street', 'one', 'liked', 'strong', 'commitment', 'minded', 'role', 'Derek', 'portrayed', 'rejecting', 'Lisa', 'advances', 'Usually', 'interracial', 'plots', 'are', 'portrayed', 'script', 'weak', 'black', 'men', 'characters', 'Black', 'men', 'are', 'desperate', 'mission', 'get', 'white', 'women', 'eventually', 'permanently', 'taking', 'off', 'dating', 'market', 'availability', 'towards', 'black', 'women', 'Black', 'men', 'portrayed', 'big', 'strong', 'dumb', 'jungle', 'fever.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'strong', 'committed', 'black', 'family', 'man', 'finally', 'resist', 'white', 'woman', 'change', 'Refreshing', 'see', 'stay', 'loyal', 'marriage', 'try', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'was', 'especially', 'uplifting', 'see', 'Derek', 'was', 'successful', 'nowhere', 'insecure', 'weak', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'self-proclaimed', 'Cau-Blin-Asian', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'type', 'would', 'have', 'quickly', 'given', 'Lisa', 'grinning', 'pretending', 'secretly', 'fornicating', 'woman', 'escape', 'obvious', 'blackness.Derek', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'tall', 'dark', 'handsome', 'financially', 'successful', 'being', 'pursued', 'stalked', 'bullied', 'overly', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'was', 'hoping', 'Derek', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'give', 'Lisa', 'had', 'smile', 'could', 'win', 'weak', 'had', 'very', 'sexy', 'graceful', 'body', 'language', 'natural', 'rhythm', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'mentally', 'ill', 'part', 'portrayed', 'Beyonce', 'showed', 'ugly', 'disrespectful', 'side', 'black', 'women', 'why', 'successful', 'black', 'men', 'gravitate', 'other', 'women', 'Beyonce', 'expected', 'Derek', 'remain', 'faithful', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'house', 'suffering', 'emotionally', 'kept', 'roof', 'head.In', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'most', 'unemployed', 'wives', 'would', 'not', 'put', 'six', 'figure', 'salary', 'out', '3', 'months', 'just', 'purchasing', 'first', 'dream', 'home', 'found', 'out', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'film', 'also', 'included', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'basket', 'ball', 'great', 'Magic', 'Johnson', ""'ve"", 'continued', 'cinematic', 'expectation', 'exploitation', 'mammy-fication', 'angry', 'black', 'woman', 'syndrome', 'Beyonce', 'blinded', 'truth', 'Derek', 'complete', 'innocence', 'showed', 'excessive', 'anger', 'insecurity', 'cursing', 'out', 'fussing', 'behavior', 'just', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'unpredictable', 'Lunatic', 'Lisa', 'When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'Beyonce', 'played', 'difficult', 'get', 'bed', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'knowing', 'Derek.The', 'ultimate', 'showdown', 'Beyonce', 'Lisa', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'behalf', 'Beyonce', 'weak', 'script', 'Beyonce', 'offered', 'kind', 'hand', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'save', 'Lisa', 'falling', '30', 'feet', 'death', 'when', 'attic', 'floor', 'caved', 'Lisa', 'had', 'invaded', 'Beyonce', 'home', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'Beyonce', 'decided', 'try', 'save', 'Lisa', 'life', 'Executive', 'producer', 'Beyonce', 'gave', 'script', 'playing', 'good', 'samaritan', 'trying', 'save', 'Lisa', 'dangled', 'high', 'ceiling', 'Lisa', 'decided', 'grab', 'Beyonce', 'hand', 'not', 'save', 'try', 'pull', 'Beyonce', 'down', 'also', 'would', 'fall', 'deaths', 'would', 'be', 'Derek', 'attitude', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'have', 'either.Overall', 'different', 'outcome', 'growing', 'black', 'men', 'white', 'women', 'phenomenon', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'was', 'perfect', 'actor', 'part', 'Derek', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'was', 'perfect', 'actress', 'part', 'Lisa', 'Beyonce', 'unknowingly', 'played', 'perfect', 'part', 'explain', 'why', 'black', 'women', 'force', 'black', 'men', 'bolt', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'be', 'other', 'women', 'baby', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Derek', 'Beyonce', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'parents', 'movie', 'looked', 'great', 'Blu-ray', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'mysterious', 'perfect', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'demented', 'role', 'Lisa', 'portrayed', 'very', 'convincingly']",Obsessed

I also knew by the long shot of the attic with the weak floorboards that it was going to play a significant part in the movie later on.  To say that there is nothing subtle or unpredictable about Obsessed is an understatement.  We get a pretty married couple with a cute baby, but we never really know how old he is.  Hubby tells the temp they've been married for three years, and other coworkers have made it clear that he married her because he got her in trouble.  Okay, fair, he did the right thing.  So why is it that when he's going to the Christmas party she wants him to eat something if he's going to drink (Beyoncee sounds like my mom used to when I went out!) because he got her in trouble the year before.  Um, so is this kid a little more than 2 or is he 9 months old?  If he's two, he should be munching on cookies and eating solid food!Ali Larter as the temp does everything you expect her to do as a psycho chick without any reason behind it.  What temp knows all about the vice president of the company they're not staying at in the first place?  Most temps just want to get their check and get out.  And if she's so gosh darned efficient, why is she a temp in the first place?  Answer THAT one!  All we know for sure is that she's nasty, conniving, and wants to break up a happy little family consisting of a wife who pushes her husband around so much you'd think he'd be in the market for a little side action.  Anyway, this plot reeks of haven't-we-met-beforeisms of deluge quantity impact so as to rival a Mississppi flood, except more disastrous.The acting is so-so, but Beyoncee' is pretty bad except for the end when the claws (and the previously mentioned attic floor) come out.

1262508,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002CAWNDS,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 7]","While not as complex or frightening as Adrian Lynn's ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Obsessed"" still manages to be an entertaining film. In one very crucial way, it breaks tradition with the average domestic thriller: There's no infidelity. There's an awful lot of flirtation, no question, but when it comes to faithfulness, the married man gets high marks. I'm referring to Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a Los Angeles asset manager. He becomes the object of a new office temp's desire, and as we see over the film's 105 minutes, she'll go to just about any lengths to get what she's after. I agree that this is hardly an original premise, and at times, the film seems more interested in being formulaic than in being compelling. But at the very least, it makes due with what little it has, which is to say that it's perfectly acceptable.It's a classic scenario: Not only has Derek just been promoted to the rank of Executive Vice President, he also has a beautiful family and a luxurious new house. He's respected by his colleagues, his superiors trust him deeply, and he has great friends. Things are going really well.Then comes the day he enters an elevator and meets Lisa (Ari Larter), a sultry beauty with long blonde hair and a killer figure. She's carrying a large amount of paperwork, so much so that she inevitably drops them in a moment of clumsiness. Derek, trying to be nice, offers to help her out, and that leads to the next inevitable moment--they reach for the same piece of paper at the same time, resulting in their hands touching. There's nothing subtle about this. For that matter, there's nothing subtle about the entire film, which has no qualms about going for the obvious.Take, for example, a scene that takes place some weeks after Derek and Lisa first meet: Derek walks into the lounge area and sees Lisa on the verge of tears. He assumes she's having boyfriend trouble, and encourages her by saying how pretty she is and how any man would be lucky to know her. In fact, if he was single ... ah, but he doesn't finish his sentence. There are two specific reasons why people do this: (1) some people don't actually mean it when they say it, so there's no point in completing the thought; (2) some people are afraid that they do mean what they're saying, and therefore don't want to incriminate themselves any further. What reasoning do you think Derek followed? Choose whichever one you think applies. I have a feeling the filmmakers wanted it to be ambiguous.It isn't long before Derek regrets ever having met Lisa. In spite of the fact that she's incredibly efficient (at times frighteningly so), she rapidly becomes overly friendly, pretty much to the point of intrusiveness. It isn't until the annual office Christmas party that things begin taking a darker turn; Lisa takes advantage of the fact that Derek has had one too many and tries to have sex with him in a bathroom stall. He wards her off, but that doesn't stop her from trying again the next day, when she insistently gets into his car as he's leaving work.Before I go any further, let me backtrack a bit and talk about Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles), who looks bootylicious but acts, for the most part, like a typical wife and mother. When she first learns that a new female temp is working for Derek, she jokingly chides him for allowing such a thing to happen. Then the two actually meet, and while it's too early for Sharon to be suspicious, she definitely shows concern. Let's face it--Lisa's a beautiful woman and Derek is a handsome man. It doesn't take a genius to see what could potentially happen.As Lisa's attempts at seduction grow more and more brazen, Derek finds himself in a very awkward position, desperate to maintain his reputation but even more desperate to distance himself from Lisa. There inevitably comes a point at which Sharon finds out that something isn't quite right, that Lisa labors under the delusion that Derek is in love with her. This paves the way for the final confrontation, which, for me at least, was the weakest section of the film, designed less like a plausible plot point and more like an excuse to have two women fighting. I have no doubt many will see this movie specifically for this scene.There are other aspects that don't work too well, including a strange camaraderie between Lisa and a gay office assistant named Patrick (Matthew Humphreys). Within the context of this story, I failed to see how this character was necessary--other than a few stereotypical one-liners and some witty banter, he contributes nothing to the story. There's also Derek's office buddy, Ben (Jerry O'Connell), a sex-hungry party animal who seems to lack the conviction of his personality. He too contributes nothing to the story. Fortunately, these are side characters that have little bearing on either the central story or the three main characters, all of which are the most developed components of ""Obsessed."" While hardly a masterpiece, it's an entertaining thriller that achieved exactly what it wanted to achieve. And even if Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is better suited for more meaningful characters like Etta James, she has once again proven herself as a competent actress.",4,Keep Your Hands Off My

The movie stars Idris Elba, Ali Larter, Beyonce Knowles and Jerry O'Connell. The trailer for 'Obsessed' had me fired up and ready to see a fantastic movie, however, the trailer ended up being the best part. I struggled to sit through this flick and was disturbed over the $3.00 I had spent to rent it! We have all seen this movie before. It was called 'Fatal Attraction'. The difference being that there was none of that pesky sex stuff to make us understand how our villainess became so enthralled with our married, male lead!The acting in 'Obsessed' was much like watching a fourth grade play (No offence forth graders), and very quickly made me come to the conclusion that not all singers can act, regardless of their efforts...sorry Ms. Knowles! Ali Larter, on the other hand, played a fantastic psycho but the movie's dullness and lack of luster threw a dark veil over her performance.

I think it's also a film that can be used in marriage counselling classes as you really feel sorry for the husband, and the fact that he has to go through the come-ons by the temp, but he should've told his wife about it in the first place. I found this to be the dark side of going to work. I have come to the conclusion that work isn't a social outlet, and it doesn't pay to find out how the other co-workers are doing. It's also becoming where you have to keep yourself...just keep saying you're F.I.N.E. you can fill in the blanks. I honestly don't know if work was supposedly at one time a way of making friends, or not....who knows we may have been all wrong about socializing with our co-workers, giving hugs, dating each other. If that wasn't what we were supposed to do at work then we've put each other in danger. I don't know the answers to this. It's just a crying shame that something as innocent as a hug can be construed as a sexual come-on, and that some people are ignored, not part of the team, or part of the family while others are fortunate to have friends at work, possibly soul mates. Me being one of the many who are ignored sympathize with all the others out there who are ignored. The ones who get in trouble for being vulnerable, and feel like they don't just belong. I feel for each and everyone of you I wish I could say that your co-workers will like you, and everything will be fine...well it may very well be if you find the right place to work to have social outlets. However, don't do what was done in this feature....it may cost you your life. I know I've said I would rather work out of my house instead of going to work anymore, but I may not have that option, so until I find that job where I feel like I belong, and can have friends at work...possibly a soul mate I will just have to watch out, and be careful with who I want to be friends with at work.",4,"Not quite the classic ""Fatal Attraction"", or ""Play Misty For Me"" was",1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,1989,"['still', 'very', 'good', 'feature', 'can', 'be', 'tool', 'used', 'teaching', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'think', 'also', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'marriage', 'counselling', 'classes', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'husband', 'fact', 'go', 'come-ons', 'temp', 'should', ""'ve"", 'told', 'wife', 'first', 'place', 'found', 'be', 'dark', 'side', 'going', 'work', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'work', ""n't"", 'social', 'outlet', ""n't"", 'pay', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'other', 'co-workers', 'are', 'doing', 'also', 'becoming', 'where', 'have', 'keep', 'just', 'keep', 'saying', ""'re"", 'F.I.N.E', 'can', 'fill', 'blanks', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'work', 'was', 'supposedly', 'one', 'time', 'way', 'making', 'friends', 'not', '.who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'socializing', 'co-workers', 'giving', 'hugs', 'dating', 'other', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'work', 'then', ""'ve"", 'put', 'other', 'danger', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answers', 'just', 'crying', 'shame', 'something', 'as', 'innocent', 'hug', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'sexual', 'come-on', 'people', 'are', 'ignored', 'not', 'part', 'team', 'part', 'family', 'others', 'are', 'fortunate', 'have', 'friends', 'work', 'possibly', 'soul', 'mates', 'Me', 'being', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'ignored', 'sympathize', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'ignored', 'ones', 'who', 'get', 'trouble', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'belong', 'feel', 'everyone', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'co-workers', 'will', 'like', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'well', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'find', 'right', 'place', 'work', 'have', 'social', 'outlets', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'feature', '.it', 'may', 'cost', 'life', 'know', ""'ve"", 'said', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'house', 'instead', 'going', 'work', 'anymore', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'option', 'find', 'job', 'where', 'feel', 'belong', 'can', 'have', 'friends', 'work', 'possibly', 'soul', 'mate', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'out', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'friends', 'work']",Obsessed

Beyonce cannot pull off the wife scorned and the only reason she got this part is because her father is one of the producers.Beyonce's character Sharon is not rootable at all, she's too damn possessive, ""Why didn't you call me back,"" ""Are you listening to me,"" ""Eat something,"" shut up. The ultimate ""I thought we had an agreement no female assistants."" Her husband Derrick is not in charge of who gets hired to work as a temp, so she shouldn't be blaming him for that. Then when she meets Lisa, Sharon is acting like a bitch with a stick up her ass. When they first met Lisa did nothing to show she was obsessed with Derrick and just making conversation but Sharon just made her insecurities show. Does she not have faith in her husband for him not to go sleeping around.Derrick being an idiot not telling his wife Lisa came on to him just because Sharon just talked her sister off the ledge. What a pathetic plot device to use to keep him from telling his wife. Then when Sharon finds out and Derrick is telling her he didn't do anything with the woman, Sharon automatically believes Lisa's story and not her own husband. She kicks her husband out of the house for 3 months, where there is no solid proof of him cheating. When she kicked him out did he go out and cheat and be with another woman like some men would do, nope. She's acting crusty for 3 whole months of not talking to him and all for what? How the hell is she kicking him out and she got no damn job, did she pay one bill during those 3 months, no she didn't because she has no income.Why was Lisa targeting Derrick specifically, there was no reason why she became obsessed with him out of the blue. Like others said they gay assistant or Derrick's best friend could have been behind the whole thing but no they weren't. So makes no sense at all.

Amith (kndy),"[2, 5]","In the Spring of 2009, the obsessed psychopath film known as ""OBSESSED"" made its way to theaters.The film would be directed by Steve Shill (""Dexter"", ""The Tudors"" and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent""), featuring a screenplay by David Loughery (""Lakeview Terrace"" and ""Money Train""), music by composer James Dooley (""Pushing Daisies"") and cinematography by Ken Seng (""Quarantine"" and ""The Poker House"").""OBSESSED"" would star Idris Elba (""The Human Contract"", ""28 Weeks Later"" and ""American Gangster""), pop singer Beyonce Knowles (""Dreamgirls"", ""The Pink Panther"", ""The Fighting Temptations"" and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember), Ali Larter (""Heroes"", ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", ""Final Destination 2' and ""House on Haunted Hill""), Jerry O'Connell (""Do Not Disturb"", ""Samantha Who?"" and ""Crossing Jordan"") and Christine Lahti (""Jack & Bobby"" and ""Chicago Hope"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""OBSESSED"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1).  The picture quality is quite solid, with plenty of detail on the characters, Derek's office and home. Director of Photography Ken Seng, does a good job of capturing the two areas of Derek by making sure the colors are different.  Colors for Derek's office are more towards the blues while his home is more Earth tones and natural.  Blacks colors are nice and deep and overall, picture quality is quite vibrant during the outdoor scenes and colors look strikingly beautiful throughout the film.  There is adequate detail seen throughout the film and I found no digital artifact compressions.  Grain was subtle and overall, a beautiful looking film.As for audio quality, ""OBSESSED"" is featured in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1).  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film and mostly everything is center and front channel driven.  Along with the dialogue, you get composer James Dooley's haunting music playing during the intense scenes during the film.  Also, you get quite a bit of contemporary music such as Estelle's ""American Boy"" playing nice and clear.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""OBSESSED"" comes with a second disc which is the Digital Copy of the film.  The first disc comes with the following special features (all in High Definition):** Playing Together Nicely - (15:37) An interview with director Steve Shill, screenwriter David Loughery and the various talents on the film.  Everyone talks about what they enjoyed about doing this film and working with each other.* Girl Fight - (11:13) The film had to have a major climax and that is the confrontation between Sharon and Lisa and the ""Girl Fight"".  This was a scene that had to be planned quite well and look effective.  So, through this featurette, we get to learn how this major scene was shot.* Obsessed: Dressed to Kill - (9:30) Interview with John Gary Steel and Ken Seng about the look of the film.  And an interview with Maya Lieberman, the costume designer and why she selected certain clothing for the main talents.I do wish there was a commentary track because I wanted to hear if there were changes from the actual screenplay and the final cut.  Also, with the various scenes of the city, if a lot of it was stock video. It would have been a nice addition to hear from the director, screenwriter or cinematographer.JUDGMENT CALL:""OBSESSED"" was a film that didn't do that well when it came to critic reviews but in the box office, the film debuted at #1 for the weekend of April 2009 and has grossed over $71 million worldwide.The film is essentially a springboard for Beyonce Knowles, the actress.  We have seen her in various comedy and dramatic films but this is the first time we would see her partake in film that required action scenes on her part.  On one hand, Beyonce fans can appreciate her growing acting range.  But on the other hand, part of the problem with ""OBSESSED"" is that it will be compared to a classic psychopath film ""FATAL ATTRACTION"".Where ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" lays groundwork of the stages of how a woman scorned through a one night stand, becomes obsessed and ends up doing the unthinkable.  ""OBSESSED"" is a film that is much harder to accept.  We don't know why Lisa is so obsessed over Derek.  Before they started working together, she's already has some attraction to him.  I thought that there would be groundwork of why this woman is sick and obsessed but we never find out.  It's just a woman obsessed with a man and doing whatever it takes to be with him.The other problem is that the film focuses on Derek for the majority of the film.  Derek working with Lisa and having to deal with the situations that arise from Lisa's lies.  But during final half of the film, it seems that Derek becomes less important and a switch is made from being a main character and all of a sudden a supportive role, giving Beyonce the main lead to showcase her acting through action and becomes more of a film about a wife who will not stand for this psychopath to disrupt her family.  Because of this, the pacing of the film suffers and although it does work, it's not as effective.  But despite the plot falling short, for the most part, Idris Elba, Ali Larter and Beyonce Knowles do a fine job.In the end, ""OBSESSED"" is a slick film that will unfortunately be compared to ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" but it's best to move far from the comparisons and enjoy the film for what it is.",3,"Blu-ray: Definitely for Beyonce fans!

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[0, 0]","Screenwriter David Loughery and director Steve Shill would have us believe that ""Obsessed"" is some absorbing psychodrama. It's actually a Psycho-Comedy, with Ali Larter as Psycho Lisa; the ""office temp"" from Hell at the center of it all. It's all been there, done it before as ""Fatal Attraction""; with Larter less intense than Glenn Close, but equally demented and deranged. In retrospect, ""Fatal Attraction"" is a misogynistic, retrogressive piece of junk-- with smug, cocky Michael Douglas allowed to have his extra-marital affair and get away with it! ""Obsessed"" is obviously the same piece of junk; but it is a much more fun, ""popcorn movie"" piece of junk.Derek's (Idris Elba) marriage to Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) is so stable and hot-- they make love on the bedroom carpet of their beautiful new house-- he, unlike Michael Douglas in ""Fatal Attraction"", won't even THINK about having an affair.And twisted Lisa tries so hard to seduce him (in the Men's Room, parking garage, etc.). Elba is such a dull actor, he's not the type anybody would flip their lid for.  Now, L.L. Cool Jay would have been perfect casting--AND PERFECT eye candy in the role. Jerry O'Connell co-stars as Elba's office pal with a very liberal attitude towards office ""hanky-panky"", and Christine Lahti is an investigator who needs a few more brains in her head.Don't worry, though, Beyonce is not going to play the ""victimized wife"" to any degree. Beyonce brings her ""Diva Attitude"" to the ""wife"" role-- and thank God! Things don't get interesting until Larter attempts suicide; and Beyonce tells dull Elba to get the hell out of her house! The fun part is just about to begin; because the movie is just an excuse for a ""girl fight"" between Beyonce and Larter. Beyonce and the fight do not disappoint! Beyonce does a GREAT job of whipping Larter around like she is a rag doll (""I'm gonna whip the floor with your white ass!""). Beyonce's triumphant song over the end credits, the ironically/hilariously titled ""Smash Into You"", did however leave me in fits of uncontrollable laughter.",3,"""I'll  show you CRAZY: GIRL FIGHT!!!!!!""",1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,2059,"['Screenwriter', 'David', 'Loughery', 'director', 'Steve', 'Shill', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Obsessed', 'absorbing', 'psychodrama', 'actually', 'Psycho-Comedy', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Psycho', 'Lisa', 'office', 'temp', 'Hell', 'center', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Larter', 'less', 'intense', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'equally', 'demented', 'deranged', 'retrospect', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'misogynistic', 'retrogressive', 'piece', 'junk', 'smug', 'cocky', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'allowed', 'have', 'extra-marital', 'affair', 'get', 'away', 'Obsessed', 'obviously', 'same', 'piece', 'junk', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'piece', 'junk.Derek', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'marriage', 'Sharon', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'so', 'stable', 'hot', 'make', 'love', 'bedroom', 'carpet', 'beautiful', 'new', 'house', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'THINK', 'having', 'affair.And', 'twisted', 'Lisa', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'seduce', 'Men', 'Room', 'parking', 'garage', 'etc.', 'Elba', 'such', 'dull', 'actor', 'not', 'type', 'anybody', 'would', 'flip', 'lid', 'Now', 'L.L', 'Cool', 'Jay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'casting', 'PERFECT', 'eye', 'candy', 'role', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'co-stars', 'Elba', 'office', 'pal', 'very', 'liberal', 'attitude', 'towards', 'office', 'hanky-panky', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'investigator', 'who', 'few', 'more', 'brains', 'head.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Beyonce', 'not', 'going', 'play', 'victimized', 'wife', 'degree', 'Beyonce', 'Diva', 'Attitude', 'wife', 'role', 'thank', 'God', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'interesting', 'Larter', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'Beyonce', 'dull', 'Elba', 'get', 'hell', 'house', 'fun', 'part', 'just', 'about', 'begin', 'movie', 'just', 'excuse', 'girl', 'fight', 'Beyonce', 'Larter', 'Beyonce', 'fight', 'do', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Beyonce', 'GREAT', 'job', 'whipping', 'Larter', 'rag', 'doll', ""'m"", 'gon', 'whip', 'floor', 'white', 'ass', 'Beyonce', 'triumphant', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'ironically/hilariously', 'titled', 'Smash', 'Into', 'did', 'however', 'leave', 'fits', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter']",Obsessed
1262516,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002CAWNDS,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 3]","In the 2009 film Obsessed, director Steve Shill attempts to recreate the ""Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)"" thriller about a pretty blonde temp secretary Lisa (Ali Larter) who has attractive successful investment banker Derek (nicely portrayed with gravitas by the understated and suave Idis Elba) in her rather infatuated sights.  Oddly, even though Shill has plenty of chances to inject some intrigue into this fairly routine go-around of one woman's mind fantasy about moving in on a one-time bachelor now happy family man complete with the lovely Beyonce as wife Sharon, a too cute toddler, brand new upscale abode and requisite Mercedes Benz, he plays it straight, offering instead the usual tale of pursuit, rejection and violence.With Jerry O'Connell playing a smarmy office mate, Shill had a great opportunity to add a behind-the-scenes note of competition utilizing Lisa's obvious charms as bait to lure Derek into a semi-scandal that may lose him the firm's more prestigious clients.  Doesn't happen.  This is ""Fatal Attraction"" redux without the boiling rabbit . . .. . . and without the quiet albeit resigned hysteria of the Anne Archer-type wife.  Once Sharon gets wind of Lisa's intrusion within her dream Queendom, her nostrils flare with a heady sense of survival `hood-style and she prepares herself psychologically with some knowingly street-smart explicatives that suggest that once she gets involved blood will be spilt.  Other than exhibit ample displays of anger and jealousy, Beyonce Knowles does little else--her role inCadillac Recordsas Etta James showcased her beauty and vocal talents with more poignancy and depth.Bottom line: Director Shill should have added a corporate rivalry subplot to this ""Fatal Attraction"" clone that would have at least warranted some ingenious form of retribution rather than just two women duking it out for the attentions of a stud-ly investment banker.  Attach a star if you love catfights involving a blonde in her underwear and a high-heeled Beyonce with a murderous glint in her eyes.

1262519,AT3FXRUH0EHDF,B002CAWNDS,"D. Michael Elkins ""D. Michael Elkins""","[4, 11]","Many of the reviewers here have focused upon the performance of Beyonce Knowles in this updated version of ""Fatal Attraction.""  For my money, her performance certainly shows that she can certainly do more than just sing and dance.  Was she believable?  Yes.  Was her performance in any way embarrassing?  Not in the least.  Should Meryl Streep start to worry about the competition?  No, but then again the role that Beyonce was required to play was one that could have been played effectively by any number of young performers in today's entertainment universe, with the possible exception of Mariah Carey.  Hopefully having her name on the marquee will draw in viewers who otherwise might have missed this exciting psychological thriller.Fans of ""The Wire"" and ""The Office"" are already familiar with the talents of Idris Elba.  The twist in this film that makes it different from ""Fatal Attraction"" is that Elba's husband character is entirely innocent of any extra-marital activity, unlike Michael Douglas in ""Fatal Attraction.""  Even though the Douglas character did not deserve the troubles that he faced in that earlier film, you always knew that he was responsible for them due to his choice to be unfaithful to his wife.In this film, to his credit Idris Elba, rejects the advances of the persistent Ali Larter's character on numerous occasions.  Sure, he could have told his wife about the initial advances of the obsessed temp and perhaps saved himself some of the strains to his marriage but such would have done nothing to affect the behavior of the obsessed woman who was not going to give up her quest.  Elba's husband was simply in an impossible situation.  Telling his wife, co-workers, and even the police was not going to get him out of the box that he found himself in.I found Ali Larter's performance to be even more frightening than Glenn Close's in ""Fatal Attraction"" since unlike Close, she exhibited no outward visible manifestations of a mental illness.  A casual observer in the office might have noticed her interest and attraction to the Elba character, but who would have suspected the sort of obsessive behavior that she was capable of once she was outside of the office environment?Although the film's ultimate conclusion was fairly predictable, it was exciting and satisfying.

Steigman ""Movie fan from silents to now""","[7, 9]","A poor man's version of Fatal Attraction with a series of dumbfounding stupid events - easily avoidable leading to 'a crazy woman is stalking me' formula. The acting wasnt very good, the situations where Idris Elba (as Derek Charles) has plenty of chances to tell his wife, Beyonce 'I cant act' Knowles (Mrs Charles) to tell her that Ali Larter (as Lisa Sheridan) is making movies on him,stalking him, and so forth. Of course everyone finds out and then it becomes the Beyonce ghetto acting performance of a decade. She throws him out after she discovers whats going on and refuses to believe him , even though its painfully obvious that Lisa is a nutcase. Of course there is the great scene of Beyonce leaving the house for a weekend in San Diego (with he hubby) ,turning on the home security system ,then forgetting her purse. She has to goes back home to get the purse, thus turning off the home security system when she is inside. Of course when she leaves the home for the 2nd time, predictably she amazingly somehow forgets to turn back on the home security system, leaving the house vulnerable to Lisa. I started groaning after awhile whenever I saw her. Even when she enters the house for the first time she easily gets past the babysitter who decides not to talk to Mrs Charles on the phone whom Lisa is supposed to be talking to on the phone to get past the babysitter. Lisa to the babysitter as she offers to hand the phone to her "" You want to talk to her"". The babysitters response "" No."" Give me a break !The big payoff is of course the cat fight scene finale between Beyonce 'Mrs. Charles"" and Lisa, as is the entire film was made for that moment where Lisa is fighting in a long shirt & panties on & we get plenty of shots of her black panties (oh boy !! ) It became the Beyonce 'you want some, come get some' very reminiscent of a WWE Diva's match. I think the whole movie could have been cut down to just the fight scene...There were a couple of other mind numbing scenes as well but I dont want to spoil it other than I will just this question - would you show the slightest compassion to a person who has stalked you, tried to kill you, steal your child , rob your home and drive you insane for 100 minutes ? If your answer is no then you will be groaning over a few choice scenes...This movie was frustrating, un-original & the biggest piece of crap Ive seen all year..despite the suspenseful moments.

Idris Elba looks like a younger Magic Johnson (ironically one of the Producers of this mess) but he acts like an Idiot: instead of taking care of the Stalker/Nut Job with a quick visit to Human Resources, he allows Ms. Lauter's Lisa to keep harassing him until it's too late. Ms. Lauter is a completely unconvincing Psycho. She seems more concerned with good camera angles and her skimpy wardrobe. But she looks like Meryl Streep compared to Beyonce Knowles. Ms. Knowles struggles to bring any sympathy to her character and while she looks great and treats us to some new songs (!) , she simply can't act. Period. And when she finally gets to ""Kick some Ass,"" it is so poorly choreographed and ridiculous, it is too little too late.

The husband met his wife when she was his secretary.  Later we find out that the wife does not like the man's secretary being a woman.  They made a promise that he would not have a female for the job.  So, in comes this new girl.  When she first sees the man on the elevator she kind of stares at him.  They start talking and she drops her papers.  As the man is helping her pick them up she runs her hand over his.  Seem obvious.  Well that's how the whole movie is.  The lady is at a Christmas party with the man and starts getting all over him.  He tells her to stop and she acts like she does not know why he is acting like he is.Now, you would think that he would tell his wife.  When he calls her though, it just so happens that her sister's husband has just left her.  So after the man hears her talk about that, he decides not to tell her.  Then, he is going to tell his boss.  His friend though tells him that the lady may turn it around.  Seeing as how he met his wife after she worked for him at on point.  He still decides to tell his boss.  But before he does the boss tells him the girl has left the company.  Sound annoying?  My God is it ever.  Every time the man gets a change to stop what's happening, or to tell someone, something happens in which that does not occur.  It's like a movie made by a bunch of art house goons.  My mom and I were thinking Fatal Attraction.  But this was no wear near as good as that movie.  It was a complete waste of money.  There were also things that happened, that led to nothing.  Like at first, when the secretary would be around the man, he would always look at her legs.  Why?  He didn't like her, and never acted like he did.  Also, when he calls the cops in the end.  They take FOREVER to get there.  Somehow they get their when everything is over.  Plus, the husband gets to the house at the same time as they do.In the end it comes down to this.  This was a really bad movie.  A complete waste of time and money.  The entire movie, this guy keeps having bad luck when it comes to letting someone know about what is going on.  The secretary try's to play a crazy deranged character, but makes you laugh at how bad she is at doing so.  Also, through the movie you will think you know what is going to happen.  I will save you the time and tell you that everything you think is going to happen, happens, exactly the way you think it will.  The move isn't even 1 hour and 45 minutes.

She has become a dramatic actress.Although Beyonce is the star, Ali Larter,Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)and Heroes, is a dreamgirl, and it requires some suspension of disbelief to imagine anyone resisting her.

1262547,A1H1O1UV61R0EX,B002CAWNDS,LuvDuchess,"[0, 1]","This film is almost an exact copy of Fatal Attraction...you know the thriller starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. It felt like the director didn't even care about the plot of this movie, and to make matters wrose he figures ""Hey, let's cast Beyonce!"", that'll be a sure way to draw a crowd to see this movie...and it did.  Like most of Ms. Knowles films, her fans don't care what the movie is about as long as she's in it. (Remember her in 'Carmen: A Hip-Hopera'?) The majority of people watched that film with no prior knowledge about Bizet's Carmen...or at least Dorothy Dandridge's 'Carmen Jones' as long as Beyonce's in it who cares right? I do...Besides 'Obsessed' not being that great of a film with a recycled plot, Beyonce's performance is average at best.  She forces her lines too much and her acting skills don't come naturally to her.  Her dialogue in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes and facepalm, and you almost feel sorry for her.  Though she has a few films under her belt, she could still use about 2 years of acting school. Then again her role in this film didn't require much talent, all she had to do was play the black woman who's 'not having it' when a white woman tries to sink her claws into her man.I would say the only redeeming attribute of the film is Ali Larter.  Even though she plays the cliche jilted vixen who eventually goes pyscho over her completely fabricated love affair with Idris Elba, her performance is still strong, as well as Elba's.

1262548,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002CAWNDS,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","Obsession is used in so many things these days, from describing how people relate to politics to perfume. Now the name has been taken and used for a feature film that offers little new but delivers the goods for fans of the genre.That genre is the cheated on spouse whose rival goes crazy and attempts to take over. Perhaps the biggest known film in this genre was FATAL ATTRACTION. After that film came out, it's hard to believe anyone would be stupid enough to cheat on their spouse. And yet they continue to do so. If not we wouldn't have films like OBSESSED.Derek Charles (Idris Elba) is an asset manager with a major firm. He's just about to land the biggest contract of his career, things are going well with his wife Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) and they've recently had a child. Life couldn't be better.Then one day a secretary takes ill and Derek finds a temp in the office by the name of Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter). They first meet accidentally in the elevator but not long after he finds Lisa working as a temp for his ill assistant. While she seems efficient, she has a certain air of familiarity about her that bothers Derek.No doubt this comes from a past of flirting in the office, a past that resulted in his marrying Sharon. And the two of them made a pact of no female secretaries. When Sharon discovers the young woman working there, she gets angry (since he told her she was plain looking) and suggests he find a replacement. This happens soon enough when his assistant comes back. But then Lisa snags a job replacing another ill secretary.At the office Christmas party, Lisa makes her play for Derek by trying to catch him under the mistletoe. This lame ploy is brushed off but not before she follows him into the men's room and plants a big old wet one on him. Not one to fall back on his old ways, Derek rebuffs her attempt but she doesn't let go. Then again, he fails to mention the problem to Sharon.Instead not long after, Derek finds himself about to head home in the parking garage when Lisa jumps into his car wearing a trench coat. And underneath? A revealing teddy. Derek insists she get out of the car but Lisa is convinced that he truly loves her. While he continues to tell her to get out, she argues until he finally gets her to leave. Swearing to tell Sharon when he gets home, he puts it off when he finds her crying about her sister whose husband has just had an affair.Push comes to shove and Lisa attempts suicide blaming Derek for the whole thing. The police now begin to investigate Derek even though he denies everything. Lisa has planned this well and the evidence all points to the two of them having had an affair. He denies, she confirms. And Sharon, fearful of his previous indiscretions prior to their marriage, believes Lisa and kicks Derek out.Eventually the proof comes out of Derek's innocence. Months go by and Sharon forgives him, even though he did nothing wrong with the exception of not telling her immediately. Lisa has returned to the care of her sister after the initial hospital stay. But she's out again and about to make one last attempt to regain the man she is certain loves her. While that may be her desire, it isn't one Sharon is bound to take lightly and the battle is on.It would be easy to say that this film is predictable, because honestly it is. But there are some films that come along that are predictable and that's okay. It forms a sort of shorthand for the viewer and fulfills the need for this sort of trashy romance type film.While it does fill that need, it left me feeling like it was more routine than anything. I found it hard to believe that someone who has worked so hard to get where he is could act so stupidly and not notice what is right before his eyes. The character of Sharon was such a shrew at times I had a hard time sympathizing. She was so determined to believe Derek could do wrong that she never gave him a chance to speak let alone defend himself. For two people so in love one would think at least she would give him the chance.The actors perform well in this outing, doing what a good actor does. They make you lose the idea that this is an actor and instead believe them in their roles. Especially well done is the performance by Larter which could have found its way into clich&eacute;. Instead she comes off as truly scary while at the same time making you feel a touch of sympathy for her and her unstable condition. She only wants to be loved.While the performance delivers that, one has to also suspend belief to the extreme to believe that someone as attractive as Larter wouldn't be able to find someone who cared for her. Even a shallow relationship would have been enough for the character of Lisa to jump at. Then again, I guess one could always fall back on the idea that ""it's only a movie"".So does it entertain? Does it make for a good viewing? Sure, especially if you like this genre. For a night's rental you could do worse. As for a vehicle that will drive the career forward of Beyonce?

I mean chips would fall. But really, Ali is way out of her weight class, and no where near as competitive as Missi Pyle in Bringing Down the House, as she goes a few rounds with the Queen Latifah dialogue spewing Knowles. Meanwhile somewhere, Michael Douglas is telling Catherine Zeta Jones pass the T-Mobile so he can call his attorneys to find out if the master copies for any more of his films are missing.  By the time I stopped paying attention I felt like I had dropped in on a Douglas film festival featuring Fatal Attraction, Disclosure and The Game with the climax of War of the Roses thrown in for full effect.[...]She might be deranged but her intuitiveness wasn't that far off seeing how Charles' possessive paranoid spouse, Sharon (Beyonce) used to be his secretary.  Lisa will not be deterred by any measure of obstacle, Derrick is the non-aggressive objectified prize of her fantasies and Sharon, well she's a woman who might look like the girl daddy always wanted you to marry but she obviously no stranger to applying an ample supply of Vaseline before a fight but regrettably 'thespianly' challenged.  Throw in Christine Lahti (in an absolutely throwaway role) as the investigating detective desperately in need of a clue, Jerry O'Connell [...]into oblivion) as the horny, wandering eye office best buddy and a stereotypically gay office assistant (Matthew Humphreys) who just has to gossip and before you know it, we've cut and pasted the middle third of Douglas's career.But for this movie derivative and clich&eacute;d are not enough, so inanity is tossed in to create a trifecta. At one juncture, Sharon kicks out Derrick because according to her logic he exhibited no trust in her although it has been made perfectly clear to the audience she had even less in him.  When she finally relents and the estranged couple agrees to re-unite after three months, the pound of flesh she exacts (in jest evidently) are the keys to his Benz even though she continues to tool around in her immaculately conditioned hybrid Escalade.  During this three month period BTW, Lisa makes no attempt to contact Derrick , when presumptively, he would be at his psychological low point.I'm only mildly pleased while the put upon couple had a toddler, they had not yet committed to a sacrificial pet.",2,I admit it.

Save for some major holes in the plot, it was an ok movie.  The problem is that it was done before and they did it better the first time because there weren't so many holes in the plot.Derek has everything - a good job, nice home, a beautiful wife (Beyonce Knowles, no less!), good friends, and a baby.  One day he gets a new temp in his office, Lisa.  She was blue one day because she was having some man troubles, Derek comforts her, and she becomes obsessed with him - showing up places where he is and then living in a fantasy world that they are having an imaginary affair.  His wife Sharon, however, does not remain living in ignorant bliss, but will confront Derek and kick him out of their house for months when she learns that he and this woman may have had an affair.  And in the end, as in Fatal Attraction before, there will be confrontation between the wife and the mistress.If he had actually had an affair with the obsessed woman, it would have made a bit more sense.  If Lisa had a past history of behavior (even by something as lame as finding a box full of newspaper clippings), one would have realized that she was very unstable, then perhaps debate ""So he made a mistake"".  But Derek never makes a mistake, he rejects her outright and every other attempt she makes towards him.  Sharon (his wife) naturally thinks that something is amiss and becomes furious.

This time I listened to the advice of a female friend. Call me sexist but that's the last time I'll ever listen to a woman.This is the most annoying, in fact literally painful film I've seen since... hmmm ever really. There's a 'successful' guy with a wife and a small kid who gets hit on by a new temp worker. In fact she sets out to conquer him from his wife. We have no idea why, I mean the guy is happily married, has money, a boring job as some finance manager, and looks ok, but that shouldn't be enough to be singled out like that. Anyway, the stalker is just so unattractive that viewers would find it hard to consider her a genuine threat to the marriage.Except of course the wife is almost as unattractive. She gets hysterical, with no attempt to understand what's going on. Beyonce seems to have just needed a role where she could be angry. Maybe she is angry in real life, take it easy girl, move out to the country, real life isn't lived in LA.I sort of enjoyed the final catfight between the two jealous princesses, though I didn't really care who won.

No reason is given for Lisa's obsession with Derek. He appears, she'd enthralled, and that's it...and there's where the discrepancies begin.  Derek should've never kept quiet in the first place, but immediately hauled Lisa before Human Resources on a harrassment charge. Of course if he'd done that, there might not be a movie. His wife, who professes to love him deeply, is quick to believe he's having an affair, though apparently he's never given her any reason before. She doesn't let him explain, just immediately orders him out of the house as soon as any hint of impropriety occurs.The friend at work to whom he mentions Lisa's fixation, never comes forward to speak of this.  Lisa wanders in and out of his life with no explanation as to how she gets into some of the places she does. Idris Elba is great in the role. Ali Larer is a perfect pyscho, brushing aside any and all denials from Derek that he cares anything about her. Her idee fixe is permanently in place.

1262575,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002CAWNDS,trebe,"[0, 0]","The psychological thriller Obsessed (2009), may not have lofty aspirations, but it nicely achieves some of its goals, presenting a provocative story involving some strong characters, as a happily married lawyer, becomes the target of the fantasies of a temporary worker in his office.Idris Elba (Luther) is Derek Charles, a successful account manager at a big investment firm, who is married to his former secretary Sharon, who is played by singer Beyonce Knowles (Goldmember), appearing in her first real dramatic role.  When Derek meets Lisa (Ali Larter), he has no clue that the temporary worker, is about to turn his life upside down.The story isn't that complex, and has some rather large gaps in the plot, but what is presented is still pretty interesting, as Lisa attempts to manipulate Derek, before making an attempt to seduce him at a Christmas party.  Matters escalate, as Lisa later drugs Derek, and spends the night in his room.  What happens between them is unclear, in what seems like a real missed opportunity.  Matters reach a new level, when the couple's young son is threatened.  While certainly not as graphic as it could have been, and with practically nothing is revealed about Lisa's background, the strong performances of the three leads, helps to make up for some of the deficiencies in the story, which plays much like a Lifetime movie.Ali Larder (Final Destination, Heroes) does a convincing job of flirting with insanity.  Playing a toned down role, Idris Elba is impressive working with either leading lady.  Also an executive producer for the movie, Beyonce Knowles does well in a dramatic role, which also features an extended fight sequence at the finale.  The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell, and Christine Lahti.Although much that happens is quite predictable, and often defies logic, some may find Obsessed to be fairly entertaining.  The screenplay doesn't take a lot of chances, but builds to a climactic fight between the two women, that while not spectacular, is competently executed, and a glass table begging to be shattered, does play a prominent role.  However, unless you're really into checking out the flawless makeup job on Beyonce and Ali Larter, getting the Bluray probably isn't a must.",3,"nothing new, but some decent acting makes Obsessed worth a watch...",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,2245,"['psychological', 'thriller', 'Obsessed', '2009', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'lofty', 'aspirations', 'nicely', 'goals', 'presenting', 'provocative', 'story', 'involving', 'strong', 'characters', 'happily', 'married', 'lawyer', 'target', 'fantasies', 'temporary', 'worker', 'office.Idris', 'Elba', 'Luther', 'Derek', 'Charles', 'successful', 'account', 'manager', 'big', 'investment', 'firm', 'who', 'married', 'former', 'secretary', 'Sharon', 'who', 'played', 'singer', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Goldmember', 'appearing', 'first', 'real', 'dramatic', 'role', 'When', 'Derek', 'Lisa', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'clue', 'temporary', 'worker', 'turn', 'life', 'down.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'complex', 'rather', 'large', 'gaps', 'plot', 'what', 'presented', 'still', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Lisa', 'manipulate', 'Derek', 'making', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Matters', 'escalate', 'Lisa', 'later', 'drugs', 'Derek', 'night', 'room', 'What', 'unclear', 'what', 'real', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Matters', 'reach', 'new', 'level', 'when', 'couple', 'young', 'son', 'threatened', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'graphic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'practically', 'nothing', 'revealed', 'Lisa', 'background', 'strong', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'make', 'up', 'deficiencies', 'story', 'much', 'Lifetime', 'movie.Ali', 'Larder', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Heroes', 'convincing', 'job', 'flirting', 'insanity', 'Playing', 'toned', 'down', 'role', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'impressive', 'working', 'leading', 'lady', 'Also', 'executive', 'producer', 'movie', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'well', 'dramatic', 'role', 'also', 'extended', 'fight', 'sequence', 'finale', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Christine', 'Lahti.Although', 'much', 'quite', 'predictable', 'often', 'logic', 'may', 'find', 'Obsessed', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'chances', 'climactic', 'fight', 'two', 'women', 'not', 'spectacular', 'competently', 'executed', 'glass', 'table', 'begging', 'be', 'shattered', 'play', 'prominent', 'role', 'However', ""'re"", 'really', 'checking', 'out', 'flawless', 'makeup', 'job', 'Beyonce', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'getting', 'Bluray', 'probably', ""n't"", 'must']",Obsessed

Obsession created a sketchy but interesting picture of just how much of a mess sexual harassment by a female employee could create for a good boss and family man when he did nothing wrong but circumstances conspired to make it look like he did.Here, the guy was a young executive at a hard-working, hard-partying investment firm. A good-looking guy with a history as a ""player,"" he married his last female office assistant. A sexy blonde temp is attracted to him, and his office buddy reacts with a ""go for it"" locker-room mentality. The exec has a lot to lose.His wife is high-maintenance, strong-willed, and jealous, insisting that only male secretaries can work for him. Then his wife got even more touchy when her sister's marriage hit the rocks over infidelity. Another source of tension is that the exec is uncomfortable with his wife's plan to go back to school to ""get her degree"" (in what is not clear), now that their son was born.At work, the exec is important to client relationships and to his firm's reputation. The temp uses her position (including listening in on his phone calls and manipulating his weakling permanent assistant) to get information about him. After several polite conversations, she suddenly became hyper-aggressive, ambushing the exec in a stall in the men's bathroom during an office holiday party (about the only scene in the movie with any real suspense, as to whether his co-workers would see and misinterpret what was going on) and in his car in the office parking garage. He rejected her and tried to discuss it with his wife, his buddy, and a human resources official, but for natural enough reasons ended up holding back each time. When the woman attempted suicide, after somehow secretly gaining access to his hotel room at a firm retreat, the situation blew up, with him looking terrible to his wife, co-workers, and police.But the movie failed to develop the situation effectively or to take it anywhere. At crucial points in the story, the temp simply disappeared, either quitting work or being whisked away to another city by an unseen sister. Her actions did not build into a fast-paced, suspenseful sequence of events. Instead, even when reasonably well executed -- such as a visit to the exec's house to fool the babysitter into letting her get access to the baby -- they seemed aimless and disorganized. A prime example: the night before the suicide attempt, the temp drugged the guy senseless; in a confusing, dream-like sequence, she then showed up in his hotel room and got into bed with him. Nothing was ever made of this scene. Then the movie really fell apart, with little happening -- none of it surprising, interesting, or entertaining. This included a ridiculous, stagey, drawn-out catfight to the death between the wife and the scantily clad temp at the end. Musical sequences went on way too long in the movie and did not seem to fit. The pace was too slow.Idris Elba was good, if somewhat wooden, with what he was given to do as the male lead. The temp was the thinnest of cardboard characters, a pure psycho with not a shred of depth or background or explanation for her behavior and with nothing meaningful to say or do. Frankly, I was embarrassed for Ali Lartner, who had nothing to work with in this film but her good looks. Beyonce seemed okay in the thin role of the wife until toward the end, when her lines and actions sunk to the worst of smack-mouth, tough-mama clich&eacute;s. None of the supporting cast added anything worthwhile or memorable; all were let down by the weak material, especially the intelligent Christine Lahti looking pathetically ineffectual as a police detective.I had hoped that this movie would be fun and interesting to watch. Instead, it was a near-total waste of time.",2,Almost nothing to it,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,4194,"['never', 'thought', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'would', 'look', 'deep', 'intricate', 'saw', 'Obsessed', 'really', 'made', 'appreciate', 'work', 'went', '1987', 'film', 'comparison', 'even', 'Obsessed', 'had', 'almost', 'nothing', 'production', 'credits', 'boasted', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Magic', 'Johnson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'weak', 'even', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'owed', 'less', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Disclosure', 'Obsession', 'created', 'sketchy', 'interesting', 'picture', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'mess', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'female', 'employee', 'could', 'create', 'good', 'boss', 'family', 'man', 'when', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'circumstances', 'conspired', 'make', 'look', 'did.Here', 'guy', 'was', 'young', 'executive', 'hard-working', 'hard-partying', 'investment', 'firm', 'good-looking', 'guy', 'history', 'player', 'married', 'last', 'female', 'office', 'assistant', 'sexy', 'blonde', 'temp', 'attracted', 'office', 'buddy', 'go', 'locker-room', 'mentality', 'exec', 'lot', 'lose.His', 'wife', 'high-maintenance', 'strong-willed', 'jealous', 'insisting', 'only', 'male', 'secretaries', 'can', 'work', 'Then', 'wife', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'touchy', 'when', 'sister', 'marriage', 'hit', 'rocks', 'infidelity', 'source', 'tension', 'exec', 'uncomfortable', 'wife', 'plan', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'get', 'degree', 'what', 'not', 'clear', 'now', 'son', 'was', 'born.At', 'work', 'exec', 'important', 'client', 'relationships', 'firm', 'reputation', 'temp', 'position', 'including', 'listening', 'phone', 'calls', 'manipulating', 'weakling', 'permanent', 'assistant', 'get', 'information', 'several', 'polite', 'conversations', 'suddenly', 'became', 'hyper-aggressive', 'ambushing', 'exec', 'stall', 'men', 'bathroom', 'office', 'holiday', 'party', 'only', 'scene', 'movie', 'real', 'suspense', 'co-workers', 'would', 'see', 'misinterpret', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'car', 'office', 'parking', 'garage', 'rejected', 'tried', 'discuss', 'wife', 'buddy', 'human', 'resources', 'official', 'natural', 'enough', 'reasons', 'ended', 'up', 'holding', 'back', 'time', 'When', 'woman', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'somehow', 'secretly', 'gaining', 'access', 'hotel', 'room', 'firm', 'retreat', 'situation', 'blew', 'up', 'looking', 'terrible', 'wife', 'co-workers', 'movie', 'failed', 'develop', 'situation', 'effectively', 'take', 'anywhere', 'crucial', 'points', 'story', 'temp', 'simply', 'disappeared', 'quitting', 'work', 'being', 'whisked', 'away', 'city', 'unseen', 'sister', 'actions', 'did', 'not', 'build', 'fast-paced', 'suspenseful', 'sequence', 'events', 'Instead', 'even', 'when', 'reasonably', 'well', 'executed', 'such', 'visit', 'exec', 'house', 'fool', 'babysitter', 'letting', 'get', 'access', 'baby', 'seemed', 'aimless', 'disorganized', 'prime', 'example', 'night', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'temp', 'drugged', 'guy', 'senseless', 'confusing', 'dream-like', 'sequence', 'then', 'showed', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', 'got', 'bed', 'Nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'scene', 'Then', 'movie', 'really', 'fell', 'apart', 'little', 'happening', 'none', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'included', 'ridiculous', 'stagey', 'drawn-out', 'catfight', 'death', 'wife', 'scantily', 'clad', 'temp', 'end', 'Musical', 'sequences', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'slow.Idris', 'Elba', 'was', 'good', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'do', 'male', 'lead', 'temp', 'was', 'thinnest', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'pure', 'psycho', 'not', 'shred', 'depth', 'background', 'explanation', 'behavior', 'nothing', 'meaningful', 'say', 'do', 'Frankly', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'Ali', 'Lartner', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'work', 'film', 'good', 'looks', 'Beyonce', 'seemed', 'okay', 'thin', 'role', 'wife', 'end', 'when', 'lines', 'actions', 'sunk', 'worst', 'smack-mouth', 'tough-mama', 'clich', 'eacute', 'None', 'supporting', 'cast', 'added', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'memorable', 'were', 'let', 'down', 'weak', 'material', 'especially', 'intelligent', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'looking', 'pathetically', 'ineffectual', 'police', 'detective.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Instead', 'was', 'near-total', 'waste', 'time']",Obsessed
