1585086,A3PQJ6J7FOOWFG,B0094AH37K,"Dr. John W. Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[0, 0]","Giovanna D'Arco is number seven of the early ""Galley Slave Years"" of Verdi opera compositions. It followed a few months, 15 February 1845, after I Due Foscare in November 1844. For this production at La Scala Milan the services of their in-house librettist Temistocle Solera was made available. He was considered a better poet and man of the theatre than the more pedantic but serviceable Piave that Verdi had used for Ernani and I Due Foscari. The play ""Die Jungfrau von Orleans"" by Frederick Schiller is a long rambling highly romantic paean to freedom's fight against the mighty oppressors. Since the play was not on Verdi's list of possible subjects for future operas, it's probable that the subject was given to him by the management.I have particular interest in Giovanna D'Arco because early on in my exploration of opera I became acquainted with Tchaikovski's opera ""The Maid of Orleans"" based on the same Schiller play. The two operas were written many years apart: Verdi's in 1845 and Tchaikovski's in 1881. It is unlikely that Tchaikovski knew of Verdi's work as Giovanna D'Arco did not travel much around the world outside of Italy and even there was not widely done. Tchaikovski's Joan opera is a big expansive piece with nine major characters; a juicy bit about Agnes Sorel, mistress to the dauphin who will be Charles VII of France. This and the love affair of Joan and the Duke of Burgundy are not in the Verdi at all, which has only three major parts. But the most emphatic difference in the two operas is in the ending. In the play and in the Tchaikovski opera, Joan is declared a witch and sentenced to death by burning by the Roman Catholic church. In the Verdi she is absolved of the witchcraft charges by her father and allowed to go back into battle against the English, rescue the king and die a martyr. This ending would go over much better with the Roman Catholic audiences in Italy than the burning at the stake by the church in the Russian opera and the original play. In Russia after all the Roman Catholic was not highly regarded by the Russian Orthodox church. Just look at how the Roman Catholics are depicted in Prokofiev's Aleksander Nevsky. Later in life Verdi would confront this again in his 1867 opera Don Carlo and the church sanctioned Auto-de-fe of burning of heretics. It caused some problems sometimes but he was above such things by now. In a recent revival at the Met pickets appeared saying the opera was anti-church. When interviewed one picket said he had not read the opera or seen it but the local priest said the opera was anti- Catholic.(Wechsberg: ""Verdi"")The music in Giovanna D'Arco is some of Verdi's most brilliant thus far in his career. However it is patchy and there are glaring holes in the continuity within the opera. The part of Joan is a tour-de-force for an endowed soprano and in this recording Svetla Vassileva is so gifted. She sprints here and there and belts out long lines of music as if she were ""possessed"". Her lines are smooth, pure of tone and under complete control. She is amazing. Brava!Another new and most talented vocal artist is Evan Bowers as the Dauphin and later King. He has a firm, unforced lyric voice of good range and even power who was very pleasant to listen to. He showed a good heft to his singing and you felt there was much more in reserve if needed. He was a bit awkward on stage, but he is not the king (yet) he is the Dauphin. I thought he carried off the stumbling youth quite well.Yes he wobbled on top and couldn't quite make it all the time but I loved hearing Renato Bruson again. It brought back memories of the real Verdi baritone of decades ago. He had (has) a magisterial resonance that I heard many times fill he Met auditorium. His was a richer, fuller, of more depth baritone than others of that era (Milns, MacNeal etc) in the 1980s-90s. I can still hear his ""Eri tu?"" from Masked Ball that sent chills up my spine. It was good to hear him again and I thought did himself proud in this role as Joan's father.What a pleasure to hear Bruno Bartoletti again. I attended forty years of Lyric Opera of Chicago seasons during his tenure as Music Director. I often sat so close to him that on an upswing of his baton I received a shower of perspiration - especially one night when he conducted Wozzeck. Back then he had black hair. He has died since this recording was made.Sets, costumes, chorus, stage direction are all first rate; a well done production.",5,A Fable against oppression......almost.,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,4464,"['Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'number', 'seven', 'early', 'Galley', 'Slave', 'Years', 'Verdi', 'opera', 'compositions', 'followed', 'few', 'months', '15', 'February', '1845', 'Due', 'Foscare', 'November', '1844', 'production', 'La', 'Scala', 'Milan', 'services', 'in-house', 'librettist', 'Temistocle', 'Solera', 'was', 'made', 'available', 'was', 'considered', 'better', 'poet', 'man', 'theatre', 'more', 'pedantic', 'serviceable', 'Piave', 'Verdi', 'had', 'used', 'Ernani', 'Due', 'Foscari', 'play', 'Die', 'Jungfrau', 'von', 'Orleans', 'Frederick', 'Schiller', 'long', 'rambling', 'highly', 'romantic', 'paean', 'freedom', 'fight', 'mighty', 'oppressors', 'play', 'was', 'not', 'Verdi', 'list', 'possible', 'subjects', 'future', 'operas', 'probable', 'subject', 'was', 'given', 'management.I', 'have', 'particular', 'interest', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'early', 'exploration', 'opera', 'became', 'acquainted', 'Tchaikovski', 'opera', 'Maid', 'Orleans', 'based', 'same', 'Schiller', 'play', 'two', 'operas', 'were', 'written', 'many', 'years', 'apart', 'Verdi', '1845', 'Tchaikovski', '1881', 'unlikely', 'Tchaikovski', 'knew', 'Verdi', 'work', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'did', 'not', 'travel', 'much', 'world', 'Italy', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'done', 'Tchaikovski', 'Joan', 'opera', 'big', 'expansive', 'piece', 'nine', 'major', 'characters', 'juicy', 'bit', 'Agnes', 'Sorel', 'mistress', 'dauphin', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'Charles', 'VII', 'France', 'love', 'affair', 'Joan', 'Duke', 'Burgundy', 'are', 'not', 'Verdi', 'only', 'three', 'major', 'parts', 'most', 'emphatic', 'difference', 'two', 'operas', 'ending', 'play', 'Tchaikovski', 'opera', 'Joan', 'declared', 'witch', 'sentenced', 'death', 'burning', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Verdi', 'absolved', 'witchcraft', 'charges', 'father', 'allowed', 'go', 'back', 'battle', 'English', 'king', 'die', 'martyr', 'ending', 'would', 'go', 'over', 'much', 'better', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'audiences', 'Italy', 'burning', 'stake', 'church', 'Russian', 'opera', 'original', 'play', 'Russia', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'church', 'Just', 'look', 'how', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'are', 'depicted', 'Prokofiev', 'Aleksander', 'Nevsky', 'Later', 'life', 'Verdi', 'would', 'confront', 'again', '1867', 'opera', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'church', 'sanctioned', 'Auto-de-fe', 'burning', 'heretics', 'caused', 'problems', 'sometimes', 'was', 'such', 'things', 'now', 'recent', 'revival', 'Met', 'pickets', 'appeared', 'saying', 'opera', 'was', 'anti-church', 'When', 'interviewed', 'one', 'picket', 'said', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'opera', 'seen', 'local', 'priest', 'said', 'opera', 'was', 'anti-', 'Catholic', 'Wechsberg', 'Verdi', 'music', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'Verdi', 'most', 'brilliant', 'thus', 'far', 'career', 'However', 'patchy', 'are', 'glaring', 'holes', 'continuity', 'opera', 'part', 'Joan', 'tour-de-force', 'endowed', 'soprano', 'recording', 'Svetla', 'Vassileva', 'so', 'gifted', 'here', 'there', 'belts', 'out', 'long', 'lines', 'music', 'were', 'possessed', 'lines', 'are', 'smooth', 'pure', 'tone', 'complete', 'control', 'amazing', 'Brava', 'new', 'most', 'talented', 'vocal', 'artist', 'Evan', 'Bowers', 'Dauphin', 'later', 'King', 'firm', 'unforced', 'lyric', 'voice', 'good', 'range', 'even', 'power', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'listen', 'showed', 'good', 'heft', 'singing', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'reserve', 'needed', 'was', 'bit', 'awkward', 'stage', 'not', 'king', 'yet', 'Dauphin', 'thought', 'carried', 'off', 'stumbling', 'youth', 'quite', 'wobbled', 'top', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'time', 'loved', 'hearing', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'again', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'real', 'Verdi', 'baritone', 'decades', 'ago', 'had', 'magisterial', 'resonance', 'heard', 'many', 'times', 'fill', 'Met', 'auditorium', 'was', 'richer', 'fuller', 'more', 'depth', 'baritone', 'others', 'era', 'Milns', 'MacNeal', 'etc', '1980s-90s', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'Eri', 'tu', 'Masked', 'Ball', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'was', 'good', 'hear', 'again', 'thought', 'did', 'proud', 'role', 'Joan', 'father.What', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'Bruno', 'Bartoletti', 'again', 'attended', 'forty', 'years', 'Lyric', 'Opera', 'Chicago', 'seasons', 'tenure', 'Music', 'Director', 'often', 'sat', 'so', 'close', 'upswing', 'baton', 'received', 'shower', 'perspiration', 'especially', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'conducted', 'Wozzeck', 'Back', 'then', 'had', 'black', 'hair', 'died', 'recording', 'was', 'made.Sets', 'costumes', 'chorus', 'stage', 'direction', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'well', 'done', 'production']",Giovanna D'Arco

1585088,A2GOTY2STOMEAU,B0094AH37K,John G. Gleeson Sr.,"[7, 7]","And I liked it a lot! But it is a somewhat uneven performance, when viewed objectively.Giovanna d'Arco is Verdi's seventh opera; it is a melodic, fast paced, musically intense work that enjoys some sustained popularity in Italy, but less so elsewhere. And with Parma being in the heart of ""Verdi Country"", the reaction of the audience gives a new definition to the word enthusiastic. Personally, I was first introduced to the work in a recording with Caballe, Milnes and Domingo, and ""bonded"" with it at first hearing.At the outset, I feel it necesssary to note that this is a regional Italian opera company; it is not the Met. The stage is small, and I suspect that the Parma budget for staging opera is a bit less than the Met's. Staging, costumes, sets, etc. reflect this.That said, there is some wonderful singing in this performance, and some that is a bit less so. Svetla Vassileva is an intense Giovanna. Berger (""Verdi With a Vengeance"") notes that the role is the first of the Verdi soprano roles ""...to encapsulate an archetype"" Vocally, Vassileva is secure throughout the range, exciting to hear and dramatically the best of the three leads. ""Incandescent"" is the word that came to my mind when seeing her.Evan Bowers is new to me; vocally I actually prefer him to the CD Domingo. There is a sweetness in the voice that resonates with me, and he is secure from top to bottom. Dramatically however, he needs a LOT of help. It is almost like he is thinking his blocking instructions: two steps left, sing, three steps forward, sing. It is near painfully obvious in the first act; later on, it is less so. There are explanations other than lack of acting skills, such as a small stage, but I think that lack of acting skills is it. Vocally, though, Bowers is the real deal!When I reviewed the Tutto Verdi sampler disc, I noted my reservations of having Renato Bruson sing Giacomo, Giovanna's father, and having now experienced the performance, I have mixed feelings. The man is nearly 80 ( born 1934) and it shows; the top wobbles a lot and there is some spread to the vowel focus, and yet ... I just have huge admiration for an old guy who is a bit older than I that can really pull this role off! And he does, wobbly top and all. Any time Verdi gets a baritone dad and a soprano daughter together in the same scene, music and dramatic peaks are scaled. That happens here in deeply moving style.Bruno Bartoletti has, I think, been conducting for as long as Bruson has been singing. Yet despite a noticible hand tremor, he does a splendid job in fully realizing the score. Orchestra and chorus do very well with some choruses that have been subject to some critical jibes over the years. Chorus costumes for the demonic folk are just plain odd.The audience was hugely enthusiastic about this performance. Bruson probably got the most applause; I suspect that he is a bit of an icon in Parma. I saw some reviews to the effect that he sang opening night only and Bowers not much more. I, too am very enthusiastic about having this disc and expect to view it often. Picture quality is excellent and sound in the DTS mode gave my viewing room a real sense of presence. There are subtitles in all western and most oriental languages.I think that a reviewer needs to be objective in doing a review here, noting both good and not so good features of a performance. That said, gentle reader, I hope that the negatives do not send you away from this hugely enjoyable performance.",4,The Audience Loved It!!,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,3478,"['liked', 'lot', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'performance', 'when', 'viewed', ""d'Arco"", 'Verdi', 'seventh', 'opera', 'melodic', 'fast', 'paced', 'musically', 'intense', 'work', 'sustained', 'popularity', 'Italy', 'less', 'so', 'elsewhere', 'Parma', 'being', 'heart', 'Verdi', 'Country', 'reaction', 'audience', 'new', 'definition', 'word', 'enthusiastic', 'Personally', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'work', 'recording', 'Caballe', 'Milnes', 'Domingo', 'bonded', 'first', 'outset', 'feel', 'necesssary', 'note', 'regional', 'Italian', 'opera', 'company', 'not', 'Met', 'stage', 'small', 'suspect', 'Parma', 'budget', 'staging', 'opera', 'bit', 'less', 'Met', 'Staging', 'costumes', 'sets', 'etc', 'reflect', 'said', 'wonderful', 'singing', 'performance', 'bit', 'less', 'so', 'Svetla', 'Vassileva', 'intense', 'Giovanna', 'Berger', 'Verdi', 'Vengeance', 'role', 'first', 'Verdi', 'soprano', 'roles', 'encapsulate', 'archetype', 'Vocally', 'Vassileva', 'secure', 'range', 'exciting', 'hear', 'dramatically', 'best', 'three', 'leads', 'Incandescent', 'word', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'seeing', 'her.Evan', 'Bowers', 'new', 'vocally', 'actually', 'prefer', 'CD', 'Domingo', 'sweetness', 'voice', 'secure', 'top', 'bottom', 'Dramatically', 'however', 'LOT', 'help', 'almost', 'thinking', 'blocking', 'instructions', 'two', 'steps', 'left', 'sing', 'three', 'steps', 'forward', 'sing', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'first', 'act', 'later', 'less', 'so', 'are', 'explanations', 'other', 'lack', 'acting', 'skills', 'such', 'small', 'stage', 'think', 'lack', 'acting', 'skills', 'Vocally', 'though', 'Bowers', 'real', 'deal', 'When', 'reviewed', 'Tutto', 'Verdi', 'sampler', 'disc', 'noted', 'reservations', 'having', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'sing', 'Giacomo', 'Giovanna', 'father', 'having', 'now', 'experienced', 'performance', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'man', 'nearly', '80', 'born', '1934', 'top', 'lot', 'spread', 'vowel', 'focus', 'yet', 'just', 'have', 'huge', 'admiration', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'bit', 'older', 'can', 'really', 'pull', 'role', 'wobbly', 'top', 'Any', 'time', 'Verdi', 'baritone', 'dad', 'soprano', 'daughter', 'together', 'same', 'scene', 'music', 'dramatic', 'peaks', 'are', 'scaled', 'here', 'deeply', 'moving', 'style.Bruno', 'Bartoletti', 'think', 'been', 'conducting', 'as', 'long', 'Bruson', 'been', 'singing', 'noticible', 'hand', 'tremor', 'splendid', 'job', 'fully', 'realizing', 'score', 'Orchestra', 'chorus', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'choruses', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'critical', 'jibes', 'years', 'Chorus', 'demonic', 'folk', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'odd.The', 'audience', 'was', 'hugely', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'Bruson', 'probably', 'got', 'most', 'suspect', 'bit', 'icon', 'Parma', 'saw', 'reviews', 'effect', 'sang', 'opening', 'night', 'only', 'Bowers', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'too', 'am', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'having', 'disc', 'expect', 'view', 'often', 'Picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'sound', 'DTS', 'mode', 'gave', 'viewing', 'room', 'real', 'sense', 'presence', 'are', 'subtitles', 'western', 'most', 'oriental', 'languages.I', 'think', 'reviewer', 'needs', 'be', 'objective', 'doing', 'review', 'here', 'noting', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'features', 'performance', 'said', 'gentle', 'reader', 'hope', 'negatives', 'do', 'not', 'send', 'away', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'performance']",Giovanna D'Arco
1585089,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B0094AH37K,Keris Nine,"[3, 3]","By the time Verdi came to compose Giovanna D'Arco in 1845, the composer was eager to take on more substantial works of literary merit with the kind of romantic scope and emotional range that suited and appealed to his musical sensibility.  He had engaged the young poet Francisco Maria Piave to work on his Victor Hugo adaptation, Ernani, and he would soon come to tackle his first Shakespeare work with Macbeth the following year.  For Giovanna D'Arco, Verdi found inspiration in Friedrich von Schiller's story of Joan of Arc, finding material for a true dramma lirico that was a match for his developing talent, but also clearly responding personally to the revolutionary sentiments that echoed with the contemporary reality of Risorgimento Italy.The grand epic nature of the story and Verdi's responsiveness towards it is immediately evident in the composer's scoring for the overture and in his personal reworking of the material.  Giovanna D'Arco deals with a classic high Romantic subject in the conflict between love and duty, caught up in a tense dramatic situation that involves war, revolution, family and religion - subjects that Verdi would often deal with, and there's a similarity between this work and something like La Forza del Destino.  While later Verdi would be more refined in characterisation and dramatic development - neither Giovanna D'Arco nor Macbeth are matches for the later Schiller and Shakespeare adaptations of Don Carlos or Otello, nor indeed is the earlier Hugo Ernani comparable to his work on the later Rigoletto - but Verdi's earlier work has its attractions, principally here in the composer's beautiful melodic line and the consistency of his treatment of the opera's themes.  Broken down into Grand Op&eacute;ra-like scenes - the King's vision, the chorus of angels and demons in Act I alone - the construction may be conventional and not exactly inspired but it is exceptionally well crafted, pointing clearly towards the direction and the strengths of the later Verdi.The quality of this rarely performed and underrated work is made evident here in this 2008 performance at the Teatro Regio di Parma's Verdi Festival through a handsome production that is sympathetic to the style and nature of the work, and it also benefits from some excellent singing performances.  Other than a painted backdrop depicting a Risorgimento cavalry charge - nothing more than a hint of what might have been on Verdi's mind while composing - the production design and costumes are traditional and naturalistic to the Joan of Arc story itself.  It's beautifully lit and staged, transforming smoothly from one scene to the next, finding an appropriate look and tone that brings out the full impact of each highly charged situation.  The placing of the performers - the stage often filled with the huge choruses composed by Verdi - also works to the best dramatic purpose, with little in the way of stagy theatrics or operatic mannerisms.The singing of all three lead roles is excellent.  Svetla Vassileva's performance - as it ought to be for a figure like Joan of Arc - is powerful, impassioned, lively and precise in delivery, working fully in the spirit of the work itself.  If there are any reservations about Evan Bowers' performance as Carlos, they are only in respect of the writing for the role itself.  It is however a similarly committed performance, well sung and acted, that works marvellously in the context of the work.  Renato Bruson sounded a little unsteady in his first scene, but is solid where it counts later in the opera, as vocal challenges rise correspondingly with the emotionally charged dramatic developments.  The orchestra, conducted by Bruno Bartoletti, and the chorus are also in fine form here, the cast and production working in common accord to present about as good an account of this rare Verdi work as you could imagine.  The Blu-ray quality is of a very high standard, the audio in particular giving a warm, clear rendering of the invigorating music, chorus and singing.  The Blu-ray is all-region, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.",5,Impressive production of an underrated early Verdi,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,4149,"['time', 'Verdi', 'came', 'compose', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", '1845', 'composer', 'was', 'eager', 'take', 'more', 'substantial', 'works', 'literary', 'merit', 'kind', 'romantic', 'scope', 'emotional', 'range', 'suited', 'appealed', 'musical', 'sensibility', 'had', 'engaged', 'young', 'poet', 'Francisco', 'Maria', 'Piave', 'work', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'adaptation', 'Ernani', 'would', 'soon', 'come', 'tackle', 'first', 'Shakespeare', 'work', 'Macbeth', 'following', 'year', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'Verdi', 'found', 'inspiration', 'Friedrich', 'von', 'Schiller', 'story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'finding', 'material', 'true', 'dramma', 'lirico', 'was', 'match', 'developing', 'talent', 'also', 'clearly', 'responding', 'personally', 'revolutionary', 'sentiments', 'echoed', 'contemporary', 'reality', 'Risorgimento', 'Italy.The', 'grand', 'epic', 'nature', 'story', 'Verdi', 'responsiveness', 'immediately', 'evident', 'composer', 'scoring', 'overture', 'personal', 'reworking', 'material', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'deals', 'classic', 'high', 'Romantic', 'subject', 'conflict', 'love', 'duty', 'caught', 'up', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'war', 'revolution', 'family', 'religion', 'subjects', 'Verdi', 'would', 'often', 'deal', 'similarity', 'work', 'something', 'La', 'Forza', 'del', 'Destino', 'later', 'Verdi', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'refined', 'characterisation', 'dramatic', 'development', 'Giovanna', ""D'Arco"", 'Macbeth', 'are', 'matches', 'later', 'Schiller', 'Shakespeare', 'adaptations', 'Don', 'Carlos', 'Otello', 'indeed', 'earlier', 'Hugo', 'Ernani', 'comparable', 'work', 'later', 'Rigoletto', 'Verdi', 'earlier', 'work', 'attractions', 'principally', 'here', 'composer', 'beautiful', 'melodic', 'line', 'consistency', 'treatment', 'opera', 'themes', 'Broken', 'down', 'Grand', 'Op', 'eacute', 'ra-like', 'scenes', 'King', 'vision', 'chorus', 'angels', 'demons', 'Act', 'alone', 'construction', 'may', 'be', 'conventional', 'not', 'exactly', 'inspired', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'crafted', 'pointing', 'clearly', 'direction', 'strengths', 'later', 'Verdi.The', 'quality', 'rarely', 'performed', 'underrated', 'work', 'made', 'evident', 'here', '2008', 'performance', 'Teatro', 'Regio', 'Parma', 'Verdi', 'Festival', 'handsome', 'production', 'sympathetic', 'style', 'nature', 'work', 'also', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'singing', 'performances', 'Other', 'painted', 'backdrop', 'depicting', 'Risorgimento', 'cavalry', 'charge', 'nothing', 'more', 'hint', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Verdi', 'mind', 'composing', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'are', 'traditional', 'naturalistic', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'story', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'staged', 'transforming', 'smoothly', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'finding', 'appropriate', 'look', 'tone', 'out', 'full', 'impact', 'highly', 'charged', 'situation', 'placing', 'performers', 'stage', 'often', 'filled', 'huge', 'choruses', 'composed', 'Verdi', 'also', 'best', 'dramatic', 'purpose', 'little', 'way', 'stagy', 'theatrics', 'operatic', 'mannerisms.The', 'singing', 'three', 'lead', 'roles', 'excellent', 'Svetla', 'Vassileva', 'performance', 'ought', 'be', 'figure', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'powerful', 'impassioned', 'lively', 'precise', 'delivery', 'working', 'fully', 'spirit', 'work', 'are', 'reservations', 'Evan', 'Bowers', 'performance', 'Carlos', 'are', 'only', 'respect', 'writing', 'role', 'however', 'similarly', 'committed', 'performance', 'well', 'sung', 'acted', 'marvellously', 'context', 'work', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'sounded', 'little', 'unsteady', 'first', 'scene', 'solid', 'where', 'later', 'opera', 'vocal', 'challenges', 'rise', 'correspondingly', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'dramatic', 'developments', 'orchestra', 'conducted', 'Bruno', 'Bartoletti', 'chorus', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'form', 'here', 'cast', 'production', 'working', 'common', 'accord', 'present', 'as', 'good', 'account', 'rare', 'Verdi', 'work', 'could', 'imagine', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'very', 'high', 'standard', 'audio', 'particular', 'giving', 'warm', 'clear', 'rendering', 'invigorating', 'music', 'chorus', 'singing', 'Blu-ray', 'all-region', 'subtitles', 'Italian', 'English', 'German', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'Japanese']",Giovanna D'Arco

1585092,A1V9VW14946PNC,B0094AH37K,Richard Askenase,"[0, 0]","For me, this early Verdi opera is only a middling work.  It has some very nice melodies, especially for the Baritone (Giacomo- Giovanni's father), which is, of course, classic Verdi.  He always writes great melodies.But the work is dramatically fairly conventional, and often very static as everyone, including the chorus, just stand and sing.  The song structures (Grand duet, double arias, etc) are in classic form- which is typical for early Verdi as he was learning and shaping his craft.  The story, taken from Schiller's play, is not terribly engaging.  Sorry, for me, this work just sort of lies there.  It is nowhere nearly as exciting as even some of his early so-called mediocre operas like ""I Masnadieri"".As for the performance?  Well, it also is just middling.  I was not taken with Svetla Vassileva's voice, though her performance was certainly committed (as an actress).  (I have not seen her Traviata in this series.  She is new to me.)  I would have preferred another singer in this role.  Evan Bowers did NOTHING for me at all.  His singing was generic tenor, and his acting atrocious.  He was as wooden as they come.  Terrible.For me, the whole show was salvaged by Renato Bruson as Giacomo.  Despite (and maybe because of his) advanced age, he has a commanding presence, overwhelming grief (as a father who believes that his daughter has been unpure), and great dramatic force.  I don't care if his singing isn't perfect.  Instead, he perfectly inhabits the role.  His duets with Giovanna are compelling, and his solo prayer scene was especially moving.  Yes, he isn't as great a singer in this performance as the earlier one with Susan Dunn, but his acting and presence more than make up for that.  Bravo!The scenery is minimal, but the costumes of the chorus are especially colorful.  Video, etc are excellent.  One comment I will make here.  The singers are body-miked, which I am in favor of.  But here, they stand out in the mix a little too much, when they should have been better blended with the orchestra.  (It may be why I think Vassileva's voice is a little shrill- it could be the sound.)Overall, I was a little disappointed in this, though it is great to have another rare Verdi work on dvd.  The performance did not do enough to raise up a mediocre opera to a much higher level.  But, as always, there are great tunes to listen to.",3,Good performance of a mediocre opera.,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,2364,"['early', 'Verdi', 'opera', 'only', 'middling', 'work', 'very', 'nice', 'melodies', 'especially', 'Baritone', 'Giacomo-', 'Giovanni', 'father', 'course', 'classic', 'Verdi', 'always', 'great', 'work', 'dramatically', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'often', 'very', 'static', 'everyone', 'including', 'chorus', 'just', 'stand', 'sing', 'song', 'structures', 'Grand', 'duet', 'double', 'arias', 'etc', 'are', 'classic', 'form-', 'typical', 'early', 'Verdi', 'was', 'learning', 'shaping', 'craft', 'story', 'taken', 'Schiller', 'play', 'not', 'terribly', 'engaging', 'Sorry', 'work', 'just', 'sort', 'lies', 'there', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'as', 'exciting', 'even', 'early', 'so-called', 'mediocre', 'operas', 'Masnadieri', '.As', 'performance', 'Well', 'also', 'just', 'middling', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'Svetla', 'Vassileva', 'voice', 'performance', 'was', 'certainly', 'committed', 'actress', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Traviata', 'series', 'new', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'singer', 'role', 'Evan', 'Bowers', 'did', 'NOTHING', 'singing', 'was', 'generic', 'tenor', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'was', 'as', 'wooden', 'come', 'Terrible.For', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'salvaged', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'Giacomo', 'maybe', 'advanced', 'age', 'commanding', 'presence', 'overwhelming', 'grief', 'father', 'who', 'daughter', 'been', 'unpure', 'great', 'dramatic', 'force', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'singing', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Instead', 'perfectly', 'role', 'duets', 'Giovanna', 'are', 'compelling', 'solo', 'prayer', 'scene', 'was', 'especially', 'moving', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'singer', 'performance', 'earlier', 'one', 'Susan', 'Dunn', 'acting', 'presence', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Bravo', 'scenery', 'minimal', 'costumes', 'chorus', 'are', 'especially', 'colorful', 'Video', 'etc', 'are', 'excellent', 'One', 'comment', 'will', 'make', 'here', 'singers', 'are', 'body-miked', 'am', 'favor', 'here', 'stand', 'out', 'mix', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'blended', 'orchestra', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'think', 'Vassileva', 'voice', 'little', 'shrill-', 'could', 'be', 'sound', 'Overall', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'great', 'have', 'rare', 'Verdi', 'work', 'dvd', 'performance', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'raise', 'up', 'mediocre', 'opera', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'always', 'are', 'great', 'tunes', 'listen']",Giovanna D'Arco

Kreutzer,"[0, 1]","I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106&#34; screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6&#34; apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.Picture is fine.Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1 or PCM Stereo. Sound stage of the surround track is just between the front corner speakers, i.e. it isn't really surround. I switched a few times between the surround and the stereo track and found no difference. The little that comes out of the surrounds has no bearing on the sound stage.Balance favors the principals, which carry body mics. They seem to be about 2 dbs louder than the orchestra and come through the center only. Chorus is sometimes meant to be off-stage and even sung with the back to the audience. Does not help with the sound.I had trouble finding a good loudness setting. When the orchestra is by itself, I would increase the loudness. When the principals started, I would reduce it 2 db.Applause is also from the front and it seemed artificially and untimely added for the curtain calls. Bruson was already 5 seconds on center stage without much applause before the applause increased for him. Seemed edited in.Overall, I can give only 1 star for surround audio, that isn't really surround.As for the opera and the performance itself, it is Verdi's seventh, and it was not his lucky number.  Besides one catchy tune when the demons dance, I could not find much melody nor harmony in it. There are parts where the 3 principals sing together without orchestra and it is just terrible. While I liked Vassileva's voice, the sound of her inhaling was a bit distracting as she was recorded too loud. She had some difficult passages, but just difficult is not enough if the music doesn't speak to me. I reserve judgment until I hear her singing something like Lucia di Lammermoor.I could not warm up to Bowers nor Bruson, who's vibrato just sounded not natural. Other reviewers called it a wobble. He was a fine Giorgio Germont years ago but those days are gone. I was glad when the performance was over.I listened to it partially again today, just to make sure my review is not too harsh and it isn't. It will not get another playing and I will return this one as it isn't surround.Youtube might be an indicator of this opera's popularity: Giovanna 4,500 results, Aida 150,000. Sometimes the majority gets it right.",1,The surround track is just like stereo and I suggest you skip this one,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2618,"['have', 'over', '150', 'classical', 'DVD/BRs', 'watch', '106', '34', 'screen', 'listen', '7.1', 'loudspeaker', 'setup', 'where', 'front', 'speakers', 'are', '9', '6', '34', 'apart', 'surround', 'speakers', 'are', 'sides', 'room', 'sound', 'treatments', 'hear', 'what', 'disc', 'not', 'distorting', 'reflections', 'walls', 'reviews', 'concentrate', 'surround', 'audio', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'judge', 'video', 'stereo', 'youtube', 'similar', 'sites.Picture', 'fine.Sound', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'Sound', 'stage', 'surround', 'track', 'just', 'front', 'corner', 'speakers', 'i.e', ""n't"", 'really', 'surround', 'switched', 'few', 'times', 'surround', 'stereo', 'track', 'found', 'difference', 'little', 'surrounds', 'bearing', 'sound', 'stage.Balance', 'principals', 'carry', 'body', 'mics', 'seem', 'be', '2', 'dbs', 'louder', 'orchestra', 'come', 'center', 'only', 'Chorus', 'sometimes', 'meant', 'be', 'off-stage', 'even', 'sung', 'back', 'audience', 'not', 'help', 'sound.I', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'good', 'loudness', 'setting', 'When', 'orchestra', 'would', 'increase', 'loudness', 'When', 'principals', 'started', 'would', 'reduce', '2', 'db.Applause', 'also', 'front', 'seemed', 'artificially', 'untimely', 'added', 'curtain', 'Bruson', 'was', 'already', '5', 'seconds', 'center', 'stage', 'much', 'applause', 'applause', 'increased', 'Seemed', 'edited', 'in.Overall', 'can', 'give', 'only', '1', 'star', 'surround', 'audio', ""n't"", 'really', 'surround.As', 'opera', 'performance', 'Verdi', 'seventh', 'was', 'not', 'lucky', 'number', 'one', 'catchy', 'tune', 'when', 'demons', 'dance', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'melody', 'harmony', 'are', 'parts', 'where', '3', 'principals', 'sing', 'together', 'orchestra', 'just', 'terrible', 'liked', 'Vassileva', 'voice', 'sound', 'inhaling', 'was', 'bit', 'distracting', 'was', 'recorded', 'too', 'loud', 'had', 'difficult', 'passages', 'just', 'difficult', 'not', 'enough', 'music', ""n't"", 'speak', 'reserve', 'judgment', 'hear', 'singing', 'something', 'Lucia', 'di', 'Lammermoor.I', 'could', 'not', 'warm', 'up', 'Bowers', 'Bruson', 'who', 'vibrato', 'just', 'sounded', 'not', 'natural', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'called', 'wobble', 'was', 'fine', 'Giorgio', 'Germont', 'years', 'ago', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'performance', 'was', 'over.I', 'listened', 'partially', 'again', 'today', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'review', 'not', 'too', 'harsh', ""n't"", 'will', 'not', 'get', 'playing', 'will', 'return', 'one', ""n't"", 'surround.Youtube', 'might', 'be', 'indicator', 'opera', 'popularity', 'Giovanna', '4,500', 'results', 'Aida', '150,000', 'Sometimes', 'majority', 'right']",Giovanna D'Arco
