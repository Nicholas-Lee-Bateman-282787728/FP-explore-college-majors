The storyline was well written, and the casting was on target, however the mixture of computer graphics took plenty away from the film and cheapened it quite a bit. Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical ""Evil Witch"" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in ""Matilda,"" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled ""Un Semplice Desiderio"") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it.

There was some hysterical  moments-like when Murray is trying to turn the mean guy into a rabbit and  instead turns him into a rabbi!  Or when the bad fairy (played by Kathleen  Turner) turns the head fairy paper-thin and stuffs her mouth with bricks.  However, I think that Mara Wilson has been in better movies.  Also, if you  are gullible, do not watch this movie.  Some parts are very believable, but  some parts are totally unrealistic!

I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from.

Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever.
