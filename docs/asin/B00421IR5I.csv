With his goofy collection of young friends he embarks on various plans to get rid of the baby.Meanwhile, his parents are worried about money, trying to climb the social ladder, currying favour with Nicolas's father's boss - a hilarious dinner party scene, where you know every single gag before it happens, but delight in the infectious, witty performances.This really is a totally feel-good film, but done with great wit and style, by all performers.It is the quirkiness, the great look of the film, the expertise of the performances and somehow a lack of saccharine sentimentality that make this so good.French Film, English subtitles, 91 minutes. This really is a film that can be enjoyed by both children AND adults. In patronises neither audience, nor does it indulge or overplay its feel-good nature.

1382446,A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K,B00421IR5I,"M. Derby ""drone45""","[2, 9]","This may have been an instance of mismatched expectations. Perhaps I was expecting something gently nostalgic? Or more  subtle than a Hollywood comedy (or a Hollywood film for kids). There are occasional and wonderful moments of observational humor. Mostly, though, this is broad farce.What the writers considered to be funny: it's nearly always based on a familiar formula, one of which I'm admittedly weary: such that this will feel more like a pet peeve than an opinion. But nevertheless, the sort of thing where characters are repeatedly (and at times sadistically) tormented, for the sake of a few chuckles? Don't like it, never did: and this film relies on it. In ways both predictable and tiresome.(Of course, some viewers will find it more to their liking. I wouldn't want to cast aspersions on someone else's enjoyment. This isn't an awful movie; it's simply not the sort of thing I particularly enjoy.)The young actors do a fine job. Which could have been a challenge, given that most of the characters are little more than stereotypes: i.e. the kid who eats too much, the ""dumb"" kid, the ""teacher's pet"" who's a prissy tattletale, etc. Oh but they're somewhat affectionately portrayed, as cardboard cutouts go. (Except the obsessively-studious boy. Not a surprise that he's repeatedly bullied, but appalling how he's portrayed as fully deserving of every taunt and assault.) Nicolas is more well-rounded. Not terribly interesting: although--compared to his schoolmates--he's remarkably complex.Despite being boxed-in by similarly stereotypical characteristics? The foibles of Nicolas' parents (and of the other kids' parents, and the teacher) are a highlight, and got the most enthusiastic laughs. I recognize I may feel this way because they're adults and ""can take it."" Whereas seeing winsome, endearing kids endure mind-numbing mistreatment? Before using the word ""funny,"" I'd think of plenty of less-flattering ways to characterize their seemingly-unending woes.Tone is everything. In Fargo many of the characters are tremendously engaging: including those who are loathsome. Even when they're placed in agonizing situations, it's hilarious.Le Petit Nicolas, superficially, appears a charming story about a group of prepossesing (even adorable) schoolboys. Then, at length, we see them (metaphorically) put through the woodchipper. This is neither Fargo nor South Park. It doesn't feel wrong; it feels worse than wrong.",2,More cruel than intended (or--at least--far more than this viewer was willing to accept),1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2434,"['may', 'have', 'been', 'instance', 'mismatched', 'expectations', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'gently', 'nostalgic', 'more', 'subtle', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'kids', 'are', 'occasional', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'observational', 'humor', 'Mostly', 'though', 'broad', 'writers', 'considered', 'be', 'funny', 'nearly', 'always', 'based', 'familiar', 'formula', 'one', ""'m"", 'admittedly', 'weary', 'such', 'will', 'feel', 'more', 'pet', 'peeve', 'opinion', 'nevertheless', 'sort', 'thing', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'times', 'sadistically', 'tormented', 'sake', 'few', 'chuckles', 'Do', ""n't"", 'like', 'never', 'did', 'film', 'ways', 'predictable', 'tiresome', 'course', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'liking', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'cast', 'aspersions', 'someone', 'else', 'enjoyment', ""n't"", 'awful', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'young', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Which', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'challenge', 'given', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'stereotypes', 'i.e', 'kid', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'dumb', 'kid', 'teacher', 'pet', 'who', 'prissy', 'tattletale', 'etc', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'somewhat', 'affectionately', 'portrayed', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'go', 'obsessively-studious', 'boy', 'Not', 'surprise', 'repeatedly', 'bullied', 'appalling', 'how', 'portrayed', 'fully', 'deserving', 'taunt', 'assault', 'Nicolas', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'Not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'compared', 'schoolmates', 'remarkably', 'complex.Despite', 'being', 'boxed-in', 'similarly', 'stereotypical', 'characteristics', 'foibles', 'Nicolas', 'parents', 'other', 'kids', 'parents', 'teacher', 'are', 'highlight', 'got', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'laughs', 'recognize', 'may', 'feel', 'way', ""'re"", 'adults', 'can', 'take', 'seeing', 'winsome', 'endearing', 'kids', 'endure', 'mind-numbing', 'mistreatment', 'using', 'word', 'funny', ""'d"", 'think', 'plenty', 'less-flattering', 'ways', 'characterize', 'seemingly-unending', 'woes.Tone', 'everything', 'Fargo', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'tremendously', 'engaging', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'loathsome', 'Even', 'when', ""'re"", 'placed', 'agonizing', 'situations', 'hilarious.Le', 'Petit', 'Nicolas', 'superficially', 'charming', 'story', 'group', 'prepossesing', 'even', 'adorable', 'Then', 'length', 'see', 'metaphorically', 'put', 'woodchipper', 'Fargo', 'South', 'Park', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wrong', 'worse', 'wrong']",N/A

In both style and approach it is very much closer to the wonderful 1980 Australian Classic 'Fatty Finn', and is much the better film as a result, especially for the adults in the audience. Maxime Godart apparently effortlessly becomes the character of Nicolas, who has a very clear take on events around him, as most boys his age do. This film brings back to me all the joys and fears of my own eight year old life, and it is a joy to see that the rest of the cast get into the spirit of Nicolas' world with relish.

It stars Maxim Godart as the little Nicolas and he is a talent to watch out for and has already made another two films. In this he leads what he knows is a charmed life, loving his parents, his home and his school mates &#8211; well all except the Teacher&#8217;s pet &#8216;cockroach&#8217; grass one with glasses.Then one of their class mates has a new arrival &#8211; a baby brother and he relays that  life is now the pits for him, worse still he stops coming to school and no one knows why. Then Nicolas overhears his parents talking of a visit and they say he must be gotten out of the way. He now knows that not only will he be getting a baby brother but that they are going to dump him; possibly in the woods as the urban myths have it.So he sets out on a charm offensive and all his school chums are going to help &#8211; badly that is. As his demise gets closer their plans become ever more urgent and funny.This is set in the sixties and just oozes style and charm in equal dollops. The clothes the cars the primary colours and lack of office technology and casual sexism are all just brilliant, well maybe not the sexism. The acting is superb with a cast of kids that are all brilliant, entertaining and funny in all the right places. This is laugh out loud at times too and had me wanting more. Sandrine Kiberlain as their teacher deserves special mention as she is really good and well rounded as always. She is also in the ruddy excellent &#8216;The Women on the sixth floor&#8217;.This is also one for the whole family as kids will definitely get it too. This tells the story and the reasons they do things all from a child&#8217;s perspective and the collective naivety that can come from kid group decicions, which is just great.

Unfortunately I haven't read any of the original stories of ""Little Nicolas"" (created by Ren&eacute; Goscinny and illustrated by Jean-Jacques Semp&eacute;), though I read somewhere the books are very popular in France. Well, never mind if you haven't read them either, for ""Le petit Nicolas"" is a pleasant and amusing film that everyone can enjoy.The film's story revolves around ""Little Nicolas,"" a happy, good-natured and sensitive boy who loves his parents, and a group of his unique friends (mostly boys). No one, not even their dedicated (and kind) teacher or the pompous school superintendent, can stop the ever-resourceful children from having fun. They are not rude. They are not disobedient. The boys are just having a good time, doing their best to do something good for friends. It is only that their ""good"" is not exactly what most adults would think. For these boys, hiring a gangster over the phone is nothing special.Set in the 50s-like nostalgic world, the film has two main stories: one about Nicolas's (groundless) fear of being abandoned by his own parents; the other about Nicolas's parents arranging a dinner with his hard-working father's boss for his promotion. These two storylines, both unpredictable and interspersed with amusing episodes, keeps a brisk pace throughout, before it concludes with a nice finale.The 91-minute film is helmed by Laurent Tirard, whose works as director includes an engaging romantic comedy ""Moli&egrave;re."" With its unanimously fine cast and skillful storytelling (that sometimes becomes pleasantly satirical), ""Le petit Nicolas"" keeps you entertained until the end.
