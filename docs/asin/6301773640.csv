His early films were often too 'artistic' to be taken seriously and his pretentiousness is quite evident here; he borrowed soundly from Godard and it shows with the excess wearisomeness. The plot concerns a young man named Athos Magnani who visits a small village in Italy where his father was reputedly an &#34;anti-fascist freedom fighter&#34; in 1936, but from the flash backs, he was a pompous jerk who really didn't do much anti-fascist work.In one scene of a dance in the village, Athos' father is smoking his cigarette in defiance of the fascist thugs who are giving him vicious looks. It all seems so silly and mundane, like a challenge that never surfaces. His father was 'supposedly' murdered by the fascists and in the present is considered a hero, with the whole bit of martyrdom being evident in the erected statue that bears a striking resemblance to Athos. So steps his son, in search of what his father was. The town does not want to return to the past, they have heroes today for a reason and they hesitate to unravel anything about that long ago era.Bertolucci manages to bore us while piecing useless confabulations from the people who knew his father including the mistress and three close chums, who are played by the old actors in the flashbacks, and thus Bertolucci plays with the contextual memory of the plot. Athos is a character who seems pained and thus reducing our sympathy of him to distaste and animosity. I wanted to grab him and slap him a few times, he was such a chump! Is Athos his father or did his father ever exist? What we have in the end is an erection of exorbitant delineations that don't really matter at all to us. Bertolucci could have made a wonderful film that rivals some of the great directors of the time but somewhere along the line everything didn't get aggregated like it should have, what we have instead is an egotistical exercise in excess that is only ideal to a half drowsy art student.",3,Continuity That Sleeps,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2132,"['Bertoluci', 'film', 'often', 'abundantly', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'case', ""n't"", 'keep', 'interested', 'enough', 'protagonist', 'development', 'plight', 'film', 'early', 'films', 'were', 'often', 'too', ""'artistic"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'pretentiousness', 'quite', 'evident', 'here', 'borrowed', 'soundly', 'Godard', 'excess', 'wearisomeness', 'plot', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Athos', 'Magnani', 'who', 'small', 'village', 'Italy', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'reputedly', '34', 'anti-fascist', 'freedom', 'fighter', '34', '1936', 'flash', 'backs', 'was', 'pompous', 'jerk', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anti-fascist', 'work.In', 'one', 'scene', 'dance', 'village', 'Athos', 'father', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'defiance', 'fascist', 'thugs', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'vicious', 'looks', 'so', 'silly', 'mundane', 'challenge', 'never', 'father', 'was', ""'supposedly"", 'murdered', 'fascists', 'present', 'considered', 'hero', 'whole', 'bit', 'martyrdom', 'being', 'evident', 'erected', 'statue', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Athos', 'So', 'son', 'search', 'what', 'father', 'was', 'town', 'not', 'want', 'return', 'past', 'have', 'heroes', 'today', 'reason', 'hesitate', 'unravel', 'anything', 'long', 'ago', 'era.Bertolucci', 'manages', 'bore', 'piecing', 'useless', 'confabulations', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'father', 'including', 'mistress', 'three', 'close', 'chums', 'who', 'are', 'played', 'old', 'actors', 'flashbacks', 'thus', 'Bertolucci', 'contextual', 'memory', 'plot', 'Athos', 'character', 'who', 'pained', 'thus', 'reducing', 'sympathy', 'distaste', 'animosity', 'wanted', 'grab', 'slap', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'such', 'chump', 'Athos', 'father', 'did', 'father', 'ever', 'exist', 'What', 'have', 'end', 'erection', 'exorbitant', 'delineations', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Bertolucci', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'great', 'directors', 'time', 'somewhere', 'line', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'aggregated', 'should', 'have', 'what', 'have', 'instead', 'egotistical', 'exercise', 'excess', 'only', 'ideal', 'half', 'drowsy', 'art', 'student']",The Spider's Stratagem VHS

It is breathtakingly beautiful. The interweaving of present and past, with &quot;son&quot; also playing  &quot;father,&quot; is really  a self-referential game of hide and seek.  The common thread between past and present is the radiant Alida Valli,  richly conveying layers of meaning with each word and move. Perhaps over 20  years had passed since &quot;The Third Man&quot; when this movie was made,  yet she's never looked more beautiful. The use of a long but simple string  phrase from an early Verdi opera (he, the master of father-son conflicts in  opera) is a stroke of genius which instantly sums up the unbridgeable,  melancholy regrets between generations, their irespective life histories,  ambivalences and myths, which lie at the core of this film. Love is indeed  quite different from understanding.  Bertolucci has given us grander,  arguably more ambitious masterpieces, such as &quot;The Conformist,&quot;  but this is probably his finest film. Storaro's cinematography is of such  beauty as to make one cry: when have we seen such play of flowers and  light?

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Made the same year as Bertolucci's better known 'The Conformist', thislook at the legacy of fascism in a small Italian town certainly hasmany strong points. Beautifully shot, with some interesting plottwists, and subtly surreal touches it's always interesting.A son returns to a town where his father ' an anti-fascist fighter inthe years of Mussolini ' was murdered by person(s) unknown, and hasbeen made into a martyr and a hero by the locals. The son meets thosewho knew his father, and as he tries to discover the truth about whathappened in the past, the reality gets more and more complex.A touch of the conventional thriller runs through this in a good way,keeping the story focused, even when the film-making techniques are alittle more obscure or baroque.Only the slightly flat acting, which feels a bit phony and distancing,keep this from seeming more like a full-on masterpiece. It's as ifBertolucci wanted to engage only our heads, when nothing would havebeen lost by pulling in our hearts as well - something I think hesucceeded with in ""The Conformist""That said, given that many see this as Bertolucci's best film, I'llwatch it again.

Magnani(Guilo Brogi),returns to his birth-place where his father,murdered by Fascists in 1936,is still regarded asa a martyr and a hero.He has been summoned by his father's former mistress,Draifa(Alida Valli), who urges him to seek out the murderer and avenge the killing.Athos's investigation reveals a complex web of deceit and subterfuge,casting new light on the allegedlyheroic death of his father.His father's statues litter the town.The film is strange in that it has never been made into a DVD only a video version is available,(however you can see it on You tube)when it is probably one of his greatest films,classed his finest by many critics.Like The Conformist,Strategem concerns the fascist period in Italy,but it is not a luxurious recreation of the 30s.Rather it is set in an ephemeral present,it concerns the encroachment of the past and the re-creation of the present into the past.The young man's return to his hometown to seek the truth,discovers it's a lie.His father betrayed his cause,and to cover the betrayal had himself killed by his comrades, a contrived plot to make his death a spectacle that turns himself and the town into a legend.This is made in Bertolucci's transition period between Before the Revolution and The Conformist.The film takes place in two times,the past and the present,which overlap and destroy each other.Once Athos junior steps off the train,at the beginning of the film,he enters a history of the 30s,in a town where time has stopped, where the `present'time of his investigations and the `flashbacks' that elaborate his father's story as it is told to him intertwine into a web that finally entraps young Athos himself.Working with Vittorio Storaro,they develop Bertolucci's elaborate visual style,long luxurious tracking shots,the rich colouring,the significant textures of walls and buildings.The town's vistas appear at times like a De Chirico stage set.There is a lingering,unspoken tension between the aging townspeople.They take a dislike to his digging around in the past,where the violence of history is digestible through myth,old wounds should not be reopened.There is a beautiful scene of Athos the father dancing in the face of the fascists.The use of Verdi's music comes into ravishing play about fathers and sons.The film has a striking, beautiful look, a distinctive aesthetic which is unforgettable.",5,The lingering of the eternal past,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2491,"['Spider', 'Stratagem', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Jorge', 'Luis',
