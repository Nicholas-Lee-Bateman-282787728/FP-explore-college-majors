This show was funny and showed the struggles two divorced women faced trying to raise and support children and all live under one roof in a ground floor apartment in New York. This DVD claims to be the complete seasons 1&2 but I think there are episodes from season one missing. I use to watch this show and I remember the first episode when both wanted the apartment and decided to more in together. I would recommend buying each season separately because you will probably get all of the season.,5,This is what TV used to be like!,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,581,"['forgot', 'how', 'good', 'TV', 'was', 'back', 'then', '34', 'reality', '34', 'shows', 'became', 'norm', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'showed', 'struggles', 'two', 'divorced', 'women', 'faced', 'trying', 'raise', 'support', 'children', 'live', 'one', 'roof', 'ground', 'floor', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'DVD', 'be', 'complete', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'think', 'are', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'missing', 'use', 'watch', 'show', 'remember', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'wanted', 'apartment', 'decided', 'more', 'together', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'season', 'separately', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'season']",N/A
989622,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000FGFBR6,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","These first 2 season of this awesome sitcom introduced a new type of nuclear family to the 1980s: a pair of divorced women living with their children together in a somewhat cramped New York brownstone.The 1st Seasons replacement in the Spring of 1984 starring Susan Saint James as Kate McArdle and Jane Curtain as Allie Lowell was both a critical and commercial success. The shoulder pads, clunky answering machine, and hairdon'ts give away the decade, but the storylines of grown-up best friends supporting and, at times, sparring with each other during personal and professional crises are timeless.Curtain and Saint James share a wonderful chemistry that makes them easy to watch. At the start of this sitcom that ran on CBS from 1984-89, viewers are introduced to Allie's first post-divorce date, played by a dashing young Kelsey Grammar from CHEERS & FRASIER.Almost 2 decades before the gals on SEX & THE CITY began tackling relationships, Kate summed it up best: ""Dating's about finding someone so you never have to date again."" By the time CBS cancelled KATE & ALLIE in the Spring of 1989, Kate and Allie's relationship had gotten a little hackneyed & stale and it was time for the ladies to move on. But those first few seasons were fast, funny, and full of possibilities since the show was still in its honeymoon phase, but perhaps the whole cast & crew of the show was getting tired & the show was running out of steam.",4,Kate & Allie Rock,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1429,"['first', '2', 'season', 'awesome', 'sitcom', 'introduced', 'new', 'type', 'nuclear', 'family', '1980s', 'pair', 'divorced', 'women', 'living', 'children', 'together', 'somewhat', 'cramped', 'New', 'York', 'brownstone.The', '1st', 'Seasons', 'replacement', 'Spring', '1984', 'starring', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Kate', 'McArdle', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'Allie', 'Lowell', 'was', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'clunky', 'answering', 'machine', ""hairdon'ts"", 'give', 'away', 'decade', 'storylines', 'grown-up', 'best', 'friends', 'supporting', 'times', 'sparring', 'other', 'personal', 'professional', 'crises', 'are', 'timeless.Curtain', 'Saint', 'James', 'share', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'easy', 'watch', 'start', 'sitcom', 'ran', 'CBS', '1984-89', 'viewers', 'are', 'introduced', 'Allie', 'first', 'post-divorce', 'date', 'played', 'dashing', 'young', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'CHEERS', 'FRASIER.Almost', '2', 'decades', 'gals', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'began', 'tackling', 'relationships', 'Kate', 'summed', 'up', 'best', 'Dating', 'finding', 'someone', 'so', 'never', 'have', 'date', 'again', 'time', 'CBS', 'cancelled', 'KATE', 'ALLIE', 'Spring', '1989', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'relationship', 'had', 'gotten', 'little', 'hackneyed', 'stale', 'was', 'time', 'ladies', 'move', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'were', 'fast', 'funny', 'full', 'possibilities', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'perhaps', 'whole', 'cast', 'crew', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam']",N/A

Jane Curtain plays Allie Lowell and Susan St. James plays Kate McArdle. Allie has two children and she moves in with Kate and her daughter. The first season only has six episodes to it. It was a mid season replacement and season two has 20 plus episodes. There are laughs and chuckles throughout this series and it gives a realistic look on the reprocussions on divorce with children let alone parents.Allie is a bit nerotic and Kate still acts like a teenager. The fun and laughs are definately worth getting.,5,A DVD set for a good laugh.,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,647,"['who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'TV', 'two', 'teenage', 'friends', 'now', 'divorced', 'living', 'together', 'one', 'roof', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'Allie', 'Lowell', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'Kate', 'McArdle', 'Allie', 'two', 'children', 'Kate', 'daughter', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'was', 'mid', 'season', 'replacement', 'season', 'two', '20', 'episodes', 'are', 'laughs', 'chuckles', 'series', 'realistic', 'look', 'reprocussions', 'divorce', 'children', 'let', 'alone', 'parents.Allie', 'bit', 'nerotic', 'Kate', 'still', 'teenager', 'fun', 'laughs', 'are', 'definately', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A
