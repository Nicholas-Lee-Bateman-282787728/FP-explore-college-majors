1549688,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008BKQZKU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'll say first that `Oslo, August 31st' is not a feel good film.  By the film's end I was almost completely void of emotion and broken.  It reminded me of the feeling I got when watching `The Deep Blue Sea'.  Both films are fantastic, but not for everyone (and not for every mood).The film follows a young man named Anders (played with pitch perfect detachment by Anders Danielsen Lie) as he leaves his drug rehabilitation center for a day in the city.  He's supposed to be attending a job interview, but he uses his time away from the center to visit old friends and drudge up the past.  His past actions haunt his every movement and soon he finds himself reverting back to a former way of life as a way to escape the pain he feels from his former way of life.  Anders is flooded with suicidal tendencies (the opening scene is breathtaking in its ability to shock) thanks to a deep depression that clouds his thinking.  Through the conversations that litter his day in Oslo, one gets a better understanding of Anders past and his eventualities.That closing scene is unshakable.As I mentioned, this is not a film for everyone.  It is very slow moving, more contemplative than anything else, and certainly exposes the buried pangs of past decisions.  Instead of delivering a message of hope, director Joachim Trier never shies away from delivering to us the darker aspects of Anders plight.  This is a film that will devastate you, and rightfully so.  Anders Danielsen Lie is sensationally reserved as Anders and gives so much of  his soul here (you can feel so much festering beneath his skin) and the technical aspects of the film are truly beautiful (that cinematography).  This was truly a highlight of last year for me, a film I didn't expect to react so strongly to.  It stayed with me all year (I saw it pretty early on last year) and has continued to be one of the finest films of 2012.",5,The clouded mind...,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,1893,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'first', 'Oslo', 'August', '31st', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'void', 'emotion', 'broken', 'reminded', 'feeling', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'films', 'are', 'fantastic', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'mood', '.The', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Anders', 'played', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'detachment', 'Anders', 'Danielsen', 'Lie', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'center', 'day', 'city', 'supposed', 'be', 'attending', 'job', 'interview', 'time', 'away', 'center', 'visit', 'old', 'friends', 'drudge', 'up', 'past', 'past', 'actions', 'haunt', 'movement', 'soon', 'reverting', 'back', 'former', 'way', 'life', 'way', 'escape', 'pain', 'former', 'way', 'life', 'Anders', 'flooded', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'opening', 'scene', 'breathtaking', 'ability', 'shock', 'thanks', 'deep', 'depression', 'thinking', 'conversations', 'litter', 'day', 'Oslo', 'one', 'better', 'understanding', 'Anders', 'past', 'eventualities.That', 'closing', 'scene', 'unshakable.As', 'mentioned', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'more', 'contemplative', 'anything', 'else', 'certainly', 'buried', 'pangs', 'past', 'decisions', 'Instead', 'delivering', 'message', 'hope', 'director', 'Joachim', 'Trier', 'never', 'away', 'delivering', 'darker', 'aspects', 'Anders', 'plight', 'film', 'will', 'devastate', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Anders', 'Danielsen', 'Lie', 'sensationally', 'reserved', 'Anders', 'so', 'much', 'soul', 'here', 'can', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'festering', 'skin', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'was', 'truly', 'highlight', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'react', 'so', 'strongly', 'stayed', 'year', 'saw', 'pretty', 'early', 'last', 'year', 'continued', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2012']",N/A

He has been cut off from his family and friends but is approaching the end of his treatment so is allowed to go out from the facility in order to look for a job. In one day, Anders meets up with his old friends, realizes how disconnected he is from the realities of other people&#8217;s lives and how far behind he is in comparison to people he use to party with. Anders attempts to reconnect with an old ex but finds that in sobriety his connection to her is gone. He tries calling another old girlfriend whom he feels a stronger bond but she does not return his calls. His parents are in the process of selling their house in order to pay his monstrous debts, his sister sends her girlfriend to meet with him because the disappointments in the past makes her unable to deal with him at present. Anders listens to the conversations of the people around him at the park, in cafes, and on the street. He finds that he is even more on the outskirts and unable to relate. He attends a party thrown by old friends. He starts drinking. It quickly elevates to him stealing money from the checked coats. He buys heroine. The movie ends at the end of that day with him shooting up in his old house.The movie is extremely powerful and as a person is dealing with personal demons of addiction I can relate. I find that the bleak outlook Anders has and his defeated attitude when attempting to acquire a job indicates how low he feels. The portrayal is honest and shows how difficult it is to stay sober regardless of the support from family and friends when such people do not understand how it is to be under the bubble of the disease.Well done film!",5,love it,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1734,"['Oslo', 'August', '31stAnders', '34', 'heroin', 'addict', 'living', 'rehab', 'last', 'ten', 'months', 'been', 'cut', 'off', 'family', 'friends', 'approaching', 'end', 'treatment', 'so', 'allowed', 'go', 'out', 'facility', 'order', 'look', 'job', 'one', 'day', 'Anders', 'up', 'old', 'friends', 'how', 'disconnected', 'realities', 'other', 'people', '8217', 'lives', 'how', 'far', 'comparison', 'people', 'use', 'party', 'Anders', 'attempts', 'reconnect', 'old', 'ex', 'sobriety', 'connection', 'gone', 'calling', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'stronger', 'bond', 'not', 'return', 'calls', 'parents', 'are', 'process', 'selling', 'house', 'order', 'pay', 'monstrous', 'debts', 'sister', 'girlfriend', 'meet', 'disappointments', 'past', 'unable', 'deal', 'present', 'Anders', 'conversations', 'people', 'park', 'cafes', 'street', 'even', 'more', 'outskirts', 'unable', 'relate', 'party', 'thrown', 'old', 'friends', 'drinking', 'quickly', 'stealing', 'money', 'checked', 'coats', 'heroine', 'movie', 'end', 'day', 'shooting', 'up', 'old', 'house.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'person', 'dealing', 'personal', 'demons', 'addiction', 'can', 'relate', 'find', 'bleak', 'outlook', 'Anders', 'defeated', 'attitude', 'when', 'attempting', 'acquire', 'job', 'how', 'low', 'portrayal', 'honest', 'how', 'difficult', 'stay', 'sober', 'regardless', 'support', 'family', 'friends', 'when', 'such', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'be', 'bubble', 'disease.Well', 'done', 'film']",N/A

S-L-O-W Norwegian film, but worth watching. The cinematography and the limited soundtrack transport you to Oslo, which looks bleak and beautiful at the same time.In my opinion, the movie shows how Anders cannot connect to the world around him even though he is already clean of drugs. Why? Because even those around him who have no drug problems are not leading  worthwhile, happy lives. He finds no motivation to insert himself back into the world because he, and even those around him, cannot make sense of it. My favorite part of the movie is when he's stting at a coffee shop and he finds himself surrounded by all these people having everyday conversations that, on a closer look, are nothing but silly and pointless.Why movies should only be about &#34;winners and heroes&#34;? Another reviewer says that he sees no reason whatsoever to watch a movie about a &#34;loser&#34;. This movie is like life itself: some are winners and some are losers. I appreciate when writers and film directors are willing to show the audience the dark side of the moon; the side that nobody wants to see or cannot see.I don't have problems with addictions but I was able to relate to Anders at all times. Life and people, sometimes, make no sense and seem to be driven more out of inertia than real and meaningful motivations.

Returning to the city where he became hooked on cocaine, alcohol and heroin for a job interview, he stops at a remote lake.  He loads up his pockets with rocks, picks up a large stone and walks in, fully clothed.  As if to test his resolve or get a near death experience, he walks back out. Although he shows up for the interview, he doesn't make much of an attempt to get the job.  His real motivation seems to be to see his sister and girlfriend both of whom have shunned him.  And his cadre of party friends.""Oslo"" is a very quiet film full of interesting dialog.  At the same time we are given aural jolts when Anders (excellent Anders Danielsen Lie) enters a party or a night club.  By the way, the soundtrack is superb.  Trier and cinematographer Jakob Ihre provide some provocative shots of Oslo, Norway.  From simple trees or windows to bustling city life, it all works.Along the way, Anders buys a gram of heroin, but sticks it in his pocket.  Both he and the rest of us forget about it.  After a night of fun and booze only, Anders leaves his friends and walks to his parent's home, knowing they are away.

1549692,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008BKQZKU,Paul Allaer,"[2, 2]","""Oslo, August 31st"" (2011 release from Norway; 95 min.) brings the story of Anders (played by Anders Danielsen Lie), a 34 yr. old recovering drug addict. As the movie opens, we see Anders spending time in the drug rehab center, and receiving the word that he is allowed an evening out from the rehab center in order to travel to Oslo for a job interview. Anders takes the opportunity to reconnect with friends and acquaintances from years ago. One of his best friends, now married with two young children, gets Anders to open up. At the end of the conversation, Anders concludes ""Everything will get better"", but after a short pause he adds ""Except that it won't"". How will the job interview pan out? Can Anders make amends with some of his (girl)friends from the past? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a bleak movie, there is no other way to put it. Without telling you how it all ends, I am not giving away anything when I say that the main character is continuously struggling to keep his head clear and forging a way forward in his life. Second, please note that much of the movie seems to be underlit for some reason. Maybe this was the intent of the director, an ""artistic near-darkeness"" of sorts. Third, the movie showcases Oslo's architecture very nicely.Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a jolly, light movie, by all means, save yourself the trouble and look for something else. If on the other hand you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that has something meaningful to contribute in the drug dependency debate, you cannot go wrong with this.

Anders Danielsen Lie is the thirty something heroin addict allowed out of rehab for a day wandering Oslo,ruminating on the value of his existence: an internal debate that exerts a low-key,powerful grip.The drama is also a love letter to Oslo,rapturously rendered, the city at summer's end is lush and green, redolent with the memories of adolescent bliss, recalled via voiceovers .Alongside this and even with the hopeful new beginning is the darker heart of Anders-a man with everything going for him,education,family,people who care-finds it impossible to see a future,attempts suicide by drowning just before the day he gets out of the clinic.Anders gets over this and suffers the optimism of others that he can start over from scratch.Anders's peculiar honesty won't allow him to be spurred by pep talks or be suffocated by goodwill.The actor's performance and facial expression of scorn and self hatred capture this quality.His refusal to compromise insisting upon the writer he might have been in the past rather than the writer he may become in the future.His friends and family keep him at a distance.His sister stands him up fearing remission and the enormous financial burden upon his family.His ex-girlfriend won't reply to his phone calls.A gap in his CV makes him fluff a good job interview.The film is not bleak,it's made up of fleeting,episodic moments--from Anders's charged conversations with friends, percolating with wounded pride and self-mockery, to his catching snippets of strangers' gossiping in a caf&eacute;, or watching his new acquaintances go for a dip in a public swimming pool before summer officially ends. The evocation of things ending suffuses the film with melancholy, as Anders increasingly becomes more an observer rather than a participant in his own life.A chance remark sends him back over the edge into drugs and alcohol.His privileged upbringing has left him with expectations he can't meet.Anders takes his leave of every scene/situation as if for the last time.The city awakening to another day has a poignancy and lyricism because of Anders personal tragedy, and with the empty streets they affirm what Anders has rejected-the delicate beauty of the everyday.Has a superb soundtrack.In Norwegian with English subtitles.",5,Mind the gap,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2713,"['Norwegian', 'drama', 'day', 'life', 'Anders', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict.Reaching', 'end', 'treatment', 'course', 'rehab', 'centre', 'Anders', 'clean', 'day', 'leave', 'Oslo', 'go', 'job', 'interview', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'where', 'stock', 'situation.Based', 'Pierre-Eugene', 'Drieu', 'La', 'Rochelle', '30s', 'novelLe', 'Feu', 'Follet', 'once', 'filmed', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'sombre', 'reflective', 'drama', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'end', 'life', 'Anders', 'Danielsen', 'Lie', 'thirty', 'something', 'heroin', 'addict', 'allowed', 'rehab', 'day', 'wandering', 'Oslo', 'ruminating', 'value', 'existence', 'internal', 'debate', 'low-key', 'powerful', 'grip.The', 'drama', 'also', 'love', 'letter', 'Oslo', 'rapturously', 'rendered', 'city', 'summer', 'end', 'lush', 'green', 'redolent', 'memories', 'adolescent', 'bliss', 'recalled', 'voiceovers', '.Alongside', 'even', 'hopeful', 'new', 'beginning', 'darker', 'heart', 'Anders-a', 'man', 'everything', 'going', 'education', 'family', 'people', 'who', 'care-finds', 'impossible', 'see', 'future', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'drowning', 'just', 'day', 'clinic.Anders', 'optimism', 'others', 'can', 'start', 'scratch.Anders', 'peculiar', 'honesty', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'spurred', 'pep', 'talks', 'be', 'suffocated', 'goodwill.The', 'actor', 'performance', 'facial', 'expression', 'scorn', 'self', 'hatred', 'capture', 'quality.His', 'refusal', 'compromise', 'insisting', 'writer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'rather', 'writer', 'may', 'become', 'future.His', 'friends', 'family', 'keep', 'distance.His', 'sister', 'up', 'fearing', 'remission', 'enormous', 'financial', 'burden', 'family.His', 'ex-girlfriend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reply', 'phone', 'calls.A', 'gap', 'CV', 'fluff', 'good', 'job', 'interview.The', 'film', 'not', 'bleak', 'made', 'fleeting', 'episodic', 'moments', 'Anders', 'charged', 'conversations', 'friends', 'percolating', 'wounded', 'pride', 'self-mockery', 'catching', 'snippets', 'strangers', 'gossiping', 'caf', 'eacute', 'watching', 'new', 'acquaintances', 'go', 'dip', 'public', 'swimming', 'pool', 'summer', 'officially', 'evocation', 'things', 'ending', 'film', 'melancholy', 'Anders', 'increasingly', 'more', 'observer', 'rather', 'participant', 'own', 'life.A', 'chance', 'remark', 'back', 'edge', 'drugs', 'alcohol.His', 'privileged', 'upbringing', 'left', 'expectations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'meet.Anders', 'leave', 'scene/situation', 'last', 'time.The', 'city', 'awakening', 'day', 'poignancy', 'lyricism', 'Anders', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'empty', 'streets', 'affirm', 'what', 'Anders', 'rejected-the', 'delicate', 'beauty', 'everyday.Has', 'superb', 'soundtrack.In', 'Norwegian', 'English', 'subtitles']",N/A
1549695,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008BKQZKU,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[8, 10]","As the late Amy Winehouse discovered, offers of a visit to rehab often get received with a `no, no, no'. Well in this case Anders played by Anders Danielson-Lie, is in rehab, whilst he is successfully completing the course it is obvious that he is just going through the motions and sobriety, which can be depressing at the best of times, has left him feeling worthless. So he fills his pocket with stones and jumps in a lake - which sort of fails miserably.After drying off he is given a pass to go to Oslo for a job interview and a day out, so off he goes. The problem is that he comes from Oslo and all his old `friends' are still there. They have moved on with their lives whereas he has been in a downward spiral of drug abuse for years. He doesn't even have good times to show as most of it was an intoxicated blur. The interview goes badly and Anders slowly goes back to what he knows will give him solace.This is not the first film to say drugs are bad, it is not the first to deal with suicidal tendencies or a mid life crisis, but it is different all the same. Anders has a series of conversations with the old friends he meets and what at first seems to be the perfect marriage is soon revealed to be a marriage of endured compromise. Jobs that could appear glamorous are merely a means to an end. The revelation that the whole world is rubbish is probably not what Anders wants. But it is what he deserves, because this is all about life choices. He admits to being a spoilt brat and there are references to his caring parents throughout, especially as to how much he has cost them.He is very hard to like as a person, but it is a credit to director Joachim Trier that he still manages to engage us with someone who is a selfish drug user and dealer. It is from the book by the late Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, and so this must be a real labour of love to have taken such an old story and set it in a modern contextThis is in Norwegian and runs for just over an hour and a half; it will not be to everybody's taste as some would call it a slow burner or `lyrically paced'. This is not an action film it is a study of self awareness, delusion and a wasted life.
