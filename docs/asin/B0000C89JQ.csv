773901,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,B0000C89JQ,Dusty,"[35, 43]","This made-for-TV film was quickly put together to exploit the deaths of so many ATF agents and Davidian men, women and children, barely after the smoke had cleared in Waco. Years later, the screenwriter who wrote this film, Phil Penningroth--much to his credit--confessed that he had been pressured by television executives to forget about researching the facts, and to instead use the film as a forum for promoting the government's spin on events at Waco. Do a google search for Penningroth's article, ""Righting Waco"", and you'll soon learn, as he eventually did, that this film was an utter sham from the beginning, and never even sought the truth. But such is the awesome power of propaganda in a nation of corporate-dominated media: when even the people who write the stories we're told don't know they are lying, how are the masses supposed to know?When the Davidian ""compound"" burned on April 19, 1993, I was horrified by the carnage, but felt like so many others that the Davidians had brought it on themselves, and the ATF/FBI had done the best they could. After all, that is what this film portrays. But after researching the matter for myself, traveling to the site, speaking with survivors, and kneeling at the tiny plaque which marked the location of the concrete room that became the oven that burned so many women and children alive, I will live the shame of my former beliefs for the rest of my life. The U.S. government killed those people, used the enormous power of the mass media to lie about it, and we all believed them.Watch ""Waco: Rules of Engagement"" instead. Or better yet, travel to the site yourself and stand where those flames once reached into the sky. Then you'll understand what really happened. This film is classic only in the sense of its value as a powerful propaganda piece that diverted an entire nation's attention away from the rogue power of its own government--an atrocity that Timothy McVeigh attempted to avenge with yet another senseless tragedy in Oklahoma City.

I liked it. It was a strong movie from beginning to end. I've always liked the tv movie genre of the 90s. Tim Daly really gets into character and pulls off a chilling portrayal of David Koresh. It might be mostly fiction but as a movie it was well done.,5,From a pilot in Nantucket to a wacko in Waco,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,393,"[""'m"", 'not', 'qualified', 'review', 'facts', 'real', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'real', 'story', 'can', 'review', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'strong', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'tv', 'movie', 'genre', '90s', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'really', 'character', 'off', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Koresh', 'might', 'be', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done']",N/A

773904,A1TEPFS8EGMJP1,B0000C89JQ,Lone Wolf,"[2, 5]","This is one of the best movies in the ""Line of Duty"" series that were fairly popular back in the 80's & 90's on NBC.  The cast features some very familiar faces like: Tim Daly (Wings), Dan Laurie (Wonder Years), Neil McDonough (Minority Report), a young Jeri Ryan & a Very young James Marsden (X-Men).  The acting was good & the battle sequence at the Branch Davidian compound was very impressive.  To me, it looked very much like what was shown on the news coverage of the assault on tv & at times, I could hardly tell the difference between the movie & real life. The movie only shows what happened up to the end of the battle though & in that regard, I say the filmmakers did a good job.Now i've read all the negative reviews here & see that most people are upset because they think this was a pro-gov't propaganda film & also becuz it didn't go into the terrible things that were discussed in the documentary: ""Waco - The Rules of Engagement""  I agree that those revelations were very disturbing but this movie takes place before those events happened.  I also disagree that this movie made all the Davidians look like wackos.  The only one that was really shown that way was David Koresh.  Tim Daly played him as a meglamaniac religious fanatic with fierce convictions & disturbing behaviors but I don't think he went too over the top in his portrayal.  Especially after everything i've read about Koresh.  The Davidians were portrayed mostly as just regular folk who had some strange beliefs and were conflicted about Koresh's actions but were still loyal to him because they thought he was their savior.  The ATF were portrayed as a group that was trying to do the right thing in stopping the Davidians buildup of illegal weapons & reports of child molestation. Was this film a little biased in favor of the gov't?  Perhaps. But many negative things were said about Koresh & not all of them were said by the gov't.  Some of them were said by former Davidians who left the compound because of the alleged crimes & wacky behavior that Koresh & his followers were engaging in. That being the case, I think this movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of what happend right up to the firefight between the ATF & Koresh.  For the rest of the story, you should definitely checkout the documentary I mentioned earlier. This movie was only part of this tragic story.",5,Well Made TV Movie,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,2362,"['one', 'best', 'movies', 'Line', 'Duty', 'series', 'were', 'fairly', 'popular', 'back', '80', '90', 'NBC', 'cast', 'very', 'familiar', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'Wings', 'Dan', 'Laurie', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'Neil', 'McDonough', 'Minority', 'Report', 'young', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'Very', 'young', 'James', 'Marsden', 'X-Men', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Branch', 'Davidian', 'compound', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'news', 'coverage', 'assault', 'tv', 'times', 'could', 'hardly', 'tell', 'difference', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'only', 'what', 'happened', 'up', 'end', 'battle', 'regard', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'good', 'job.Now', 'i', ""'ve"", 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'see', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'think', 'was', ""pro-gov't"", 'propaganda', 'film', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'terrible', 'things', 'were', 'discussed', 'documentary', 'Waco', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'agree', 'revelations', 'were', 'very', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'place', 'events', 'happened', 'also', 'disagree', 'movie', 'made', 'Davidians', 'look', 'wackos', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'shown', 'way', 'was', 'David', 'Koresh', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'played', 'meglamaniac', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'fierce', 'convictions', 'disturbing', 'behaviors', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'went', 'too', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Especially', 'everything', 'i', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Koresh', 'Davidians', 'were', 'portrayed', 'mostly', 'just', 'regular', 'folk', 'who', 'had', 'strange', 'beliefs', 'were', 'conflicted', 'Koresh', 'actions', 'were', 'still', 'loyal', 'thought', 'was', 'savior', 'ATF', 'were', 'portrayed', 'group', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'stopping', 'Davidians', 'buildup', 'illegal', 'weapons', 'reports', 'child', 'molestation', 'Was', 'film', 'little', 'biased', 'favor', ""gov't"", 'Perhaps', 'many', 'negative', 'things', 'were', 'said', 'Koresh', 'not', 'were', 'said', ""gov't"", 'were', 'said', 'former', 'Davidians', 'who', 'left', 'compound', 'alleged', 'crimes', 'wacky', 'behavior', 'Koresh', 'followers', 'were', 'engaging', 'being', 'case', 'think', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'happend', 'right', 'up', 'firefight', 'ATF', 'Koresh', 'rest', 'story', 'should', 'definitely', 'checkout', 'documentary', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'tragic', 'story']",N/A
