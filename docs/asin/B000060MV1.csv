691290,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,B000060MV1,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","This DVD contains the last three episodes of the Adventures of Sherlock Holes series. As usual, the acting is wonderful and the setting is full of period flavor. Jeremy Brett in particular has really outdone himself in his portrayel of Holmes.Of course, even the weakest episodes in the series are still a pleasure but the three on this DVD are surely some of the best.The Resident Patient: Holmes is called on to investigate when the only crime seems to be a minor intrusion. However, things change when there is an apparent suicide. This episode delves into definate Poe territory with its opening nightmare sequence. The banter between Holmes and Watson is very good.The Red-Headed League: I freely admit that this story was one of my least favorites since I was forced to read it three times in school. However, the adaptation is very good and I was forced to rethink my dislike. Holmes is once again called to investigate what seems to be a non-crime. A mysterious League of Red-headed men forms and vanishes inexplicibly. The episode also features our first glimpse of Holmes's arch-foe, Moriarty. Not according to the book but an understandable addition.The Final Problem: Any Holmes fan knows what this story entails. To those who have never read the books, I shall say that the series closes with a real bang. Mariarty tires of Holmes's interference in his criminal affairs and goes on the offensive.The show ends on a literal cliff-hanger and as I write, there is yet no word on when the Return of Sherlock Holmes will be released on DVD. I do hope it is soon since I am ready for more!There is a complete DVD set of the entire series available. However, if you, like me, have been collecting the DVDs as they come you will find this disc a worthy completion of your Adventures set.",5,The grand finale,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,1792,"['DVD', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'Adventures', 'Sherlock', 'Holes', 'series', 'usual', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'full', 'period', 'flavor', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'particular', 'really', 'outdone', 'portrayel', 'Holmes.Of', 'course', 'even', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'still', 'pleasure', 'three', 'DVD', 'are', 'surely', 'best.The', 'Resident', 'Patient', 'Holmes', 'called', 'investigate', 'when', 'only', 'crime', 'be', 'minor', 'intrusion', 'However', 'things', 'change', 'when', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'episode', 'definate', 'Poe', 'territory', 'opening', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'banter', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'very', 'good.The', 'Red-Headed', 'League', 'freely', 'admit', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'least', 'favorites', 'was', 'forced', 'read', 'three', 'times', 'school', 'However', 'adaptation', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'forced', 'rethink', 'dislike', 'Holmes', 'once', 'again', 'called', 'investigate', 'what', 'be', 'non-crime', 'mysterious', 'League', 'Red-headed', 'men', 'forms', 'vanishes', 'inexplicibly', 'episode', 'also', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Holmes', 'arch-foe', 'Moriarty', 'Not', 'according', 'book', 'understandable', 'addition.The', 'Final', 'Problem', 'Holmes', 'fan', 'what', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'shall', 'say', 'series', 'real', 'bang', 'Mariarty', 'tires', 'Holmes', 'interference', 'criminal', 'affairs', 'offensive.The', 'show', 'literal', 'cliff-hanger', 'write', 'yet', 'word', 'when', 'Return', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'do', 'hope', 'soon', 'am', 'ready', 'more', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'collecting', 'DVDs', 'come', 'will', 'find', 'disc', 'worthy', 'completion', 'Adventures', 'set']",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)
691291,ARA48345JZPZR,B000060MV1,Archmaker,"[3, 4]","This windup to the first series of Holmes & Watson on Granada TV brought it all to the ending Conan Doyle wanted, at Reichenbach Falls. Since this was the best pairing of Jeremy Brett's defining Holmes and David Burke's excellent Watson, it is almost a shame that, like Doyle, Granada continued with the additional, later, tales with an exhausted Brett, slowed and puffy from illness, and a very able actor (whose name escapes me) as Watson who is, nevertheless, less satisfying than Burke in the role. Ah well.The Resident Patient has Holmes solving a strange murder that turns out to be a case of delayed justice of a sort, rough justice though it may be.  It's okay.Then we get to The Red Headed League, which is a mystery that at first Holmes' takes lightly but soon realizes has deeper implications.  The most important aspect of the story is where it leads...to Professor Moriarty (deliciously played by Eric Porter who gets my vote as best Moriarty of all!).This, of course, takes us to The Final Problem.  Tired of Holmes, Conan Doyle wanted to end the stories by killing-him-off.  However, he told this tale with just enough ambiguity to leave the door slightly ajar.  By popular demand, he had to kick it open again and bring Holmes back.  The tale of The Final Problem is told well here, faithful to the story, and with enough detail to make the final confrontation inevitable and believable.One watches the two tales of Holmes versus Professor Moriarty and one is struck at how such a archetypal character was created with just a few deft strokes.  Moriarty is only in the two tales and only briefly and yet the legacy of the character can be seen in the James Bond villains, Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse, the Deaf Man (with tongue firmly in cheek) of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct, and even Hannibal Lecter.The Evil Mastermind will continue to be with us in book & film, and it was a real inspiration to pick Eric Porter for Moriarty.  He has the slightly disheveled and disreputable look of a brilliant gentleman gone to seed.The 5 stars are for Sherlockians, of course, and for Jeremy Brett's brilliant capture of Holmes high-strung, imperious, and restless intelligence.  The quality of the DVD's is lacking but this is all there is and the stories are worth it.",5,"Delayed Rough Justice, a Mystery & Moriarty & Moriarty!!!",1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2269,"['windup', 'first', 'series', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'Granada', 'TV', 'brought', 'ending', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'wanted', 'Reichenbach', 'Falls', 'was', 'best', 'pairing', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'defining', 'Holmes', 'David', 'Burke', 'excellent', 'Watson', 'almost', 'shame', 'Doyle', 'Granada', 'continued', 'additional', 'later', 'tales', 'exhausted', 'Brett', 'slowed', 'puffy', 'illness', 'very', 'able', 'actor', 'name', 'Watson', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'less', 'satisfying', 'Burke', 'role', 'Ah', 'well.The', 'Resident', 'Patient', 'Holmes', 'solving', 'strange', 'murder', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'delayed', 'justice', 'sort', 'rough', 'justice', 'may', 'be', 'okay.Then', 'get', 'Red', 'Headed', 'League', 'mystery', 'first', 'Holmes', 'lightly', 'soon', 'deeper', 'implications', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'story', 'where', 'Professor', 'Moriarty', 'deliciously', 'played', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'who', 'vote', 'best', 'Moriarty', '.This', 'course', 'Final', 'Problem', 'Tired', 'Holmes', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'wanted', 'end', 'stories', 'killing-him-off', 'However', 'told', 'tale', 'just', 'enough', 'ambiguity', 'leave', 'door', 'slightly', 'ajar', 'popular', 'demand', 'had', 'kick', 'open', 'again', 'bring', 'Holmes', 'back', 'tale', 'Final', 'Problem', 'told', 'well', 'here', 'faithful', 'story', 'enough', 'detail', 'make', 'final', 'confrontation', 'inevitable', 'believable.One', 'two', 'tales', 'Holmes', 'versus', 'Professor', 'Moriarty', 'one', 'struck', 'how', 'such', 'archetypal', 'character', 'was', 'created', 'just', 'few', 'deft', 'strokes', 'Moriarty', 'only', 'two', 'tales', 'only', 'briefly', 'yet', 'legacy', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'James', 'Bond', 'villains', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Dr.', 'Mabuse', 'Deaf', 'Man', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'Ed', 'McBain', '87th', 'Precinct', 'even', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter.The', 'Evil', 'Mastermind', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'inspiration', 'pick', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Moriarty', 'slightly', 'disheveled', 'disreputable', 'look', 'brilliant', 'gentleman', 'gone', 'seed.The', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'Sherlockians', 'course', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'brilliant', 'capture', 'Holmes', 'high-strung', 'imperious', 'restless', 'intelligence', 'quality', 'DVD', 'lacking', 'stories', 'are']",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)

In my opinion, it is essential for Watson to be portrayed correctly for a Sherlock Holmes adventure to be correctly done.

691296,A3FIBEA9H40C9Z,B000060MV1,Lefty Louie,"[1, 2]","Two of the very best episodes of this series.I read the Sherlock Holmes canon for the first time only last month. Where was he all my life! I was so taken in by the stories' cleverness and style that I just had to have the Granada TV series. There is no one else like the young Brett as Holmes and it is unlikely that anyone will try to do the entire series again.The later episodes in the series run from good to hideous, but it's not really Brett's fault. When he had control over Holmes, the results were ideal. But the later films show him a mere caricature of the real Holmes. At least Hardwicke remained constant as Watson.Regarding these two shows, I don't know why Moriarty was dragged into the Red Headed League. It really isn't necessary, and it implies that Doyle's story is somehow inadequate as written. I find this to be my favorite of the Holmes stories, and the casting in the TV version couldn't have been better. The only other nick I have with it is that when Holmes knocks on Wilson's door and the fellow who has been digging in the basement comes out, his knees are very obviously wet, but there is no evidence that he was on his knees in dirt. I found this rather odd, but it is a minor issue.As for The Final Problem, I was spellbound all the way through. I felt that I knew Holmes and Watson well by now, and they were old friends. When Holmes and Moriarty fight it out at the end, we all know what will happen. And when they finally went over the edge, I was in awe. The way this was done on the limited TV budget was marvelous. I've never seen a scene of this type that was so effective.Then, as they continued to fall, I kept waiting for the freeze frame, showing them dangling in space - as well as in the viewer's imagination - for all time. What an excellent memory that would have been! I believe it would have gone down as one of my favorite TV scenes (of which I have few).But when they contiued to drop and drop, well past the cut off time, I started to get worried, and finally I was appalled when they both - as represented by two obvious dummies - hit bottom and bounced off the big rock.I just sat there cold, wondering how the HELL they could ruin a perfect scene like that. We all know what really happened to Holmes. Why did they show this? If they would have left it dangling, it would have made a perfect segue into The Empty House. I can't imagine why they chose to run to this. I know that in the book it is so, but things changed with Doyle after he finished this story, and if he had been thinking of more Sherlock in the future, I think he might have left them both dangling too.But this is a mere quibble. That's the way the story is, and that's the way they chose to film it. It is still one of the best of the series. How sad that Brett didn't get to finish all of the stories his way (I understand that this was his intention).",5,Two of the Best,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,2879,"['Two', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'series.I', 'read', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'canon', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'last', 'month', 'Where', 'was', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'stories', 'cleverness', 'style', 'just', 'had', 'have', 'Granada', 'TV', 'series', 'one', 'else', 'young', 'Brett', 'Holmes', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'will', 'try', 'do', 'entire', 'series', 'again.The', 'later', 'series', 'run', 'good', 'hideous', 'not', 'really', 'Brett', 'fault', 'When', 'had', 'control', 'Holmes', 'results', 'were', 'ideal', 'later', 'films', 'show', 'mere', 'caricature', 'real', 'Holmes', 'least', 'Hardwicke', 'remained', 'constant', 'Watson.Regarding', 'two', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Moriarty', 'was', 'dragged', 'Red', 'Headed', 'League', 'really', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Doyle', 'story', 'somehow', 'inadequate', 'written', 'find', 'be', 'favorite', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'casting', 'TV', 'version', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'only', 'other', 'nick', 'have', 'when', 'Holmes', 'Wilson', 'door', 'fellow', 'who', 'been', 'digging', 'basement', 'out', 'knees', 'are', 'very', 'obviously', 'wet', 'evidence', 'was', 'knees', 'dirt', 'found', 'rather', 'odd', 'minor', 'issue.As', 'Final', 'Problem', 'was', 'spellbound', 'way', 'felt', 'knew', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'well', 'now', 'were', 'old', 'friends', 'When', 'Holmes', 'Moriarty', 'fight', 'out', 'end', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'finally', 'went', 'edge', 'was', 'awe', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'limited', 'TV', 'budget', 'was', 'marvelous', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'scene', 'type', 'was', 'so', 'effective.Then', 'continued', 'fall', 'kept', 'waiting', 'freeze', 'frame', 'showing', 'dangling', 'space', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'time', 'What', 'excellent', 'memory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'scenes', 'have', 'few', '.But', 'when', 'contiued', 'drop', 'drop', 'well', 'cut', 'off', 'time', 'started', 'get', 'worried', 'finally', 'was', 'appalled', 'when', 'represented', 'two', 'obvious', 'dummies', 'hit', 'bottom', 'bounced', 'off', 'big', 'rock.I', 'just', 'sat', 'cold', 'wondering', 'how', 'HELL', 'could', 'ruin', 'perfect', 'scene', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Holmes', 'Why', 'did', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'dangling', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'segue', 'Empty', 'House', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'chose', 'run', 'know', 'book', 'so', 'things', 'changed', 'Doyle', 'finished', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'thinking', 'more', 'Sherlock', 'future', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'left', 'dangling', 'too.But', 'mere', 'quibble', 'way', 'story', 'way', 'chose', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'How', 'sad', 'Brett', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'finish', 'stories', 'way', 'understand', 'was', 'intention']",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)

Each episode is based on a story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930) who wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Sherlock Holmes.(1) ""The Resident Patient""  (12 scenes; based on the 1893 story).A wealthy man in ""a state of mortal dread"" sets up a practice for a struggling doctor in his home.  Later, the wealthy man is found dead in his home.  Was it suicide or murder?  Sherlock investigates.(2) ""The Red-Headed League"" (12 scenes; based on the 1891 story).A businessman gets a second lucrative job because he satisfies the condition for employment: he has red hair.  An episode that's hilarious at first (check out Sherlock and Watson laughing uncontrollably) but later turns more sinister.  The quotation by Sherlock that is the title of this review comes from this episode.(3) ""The Final Problem"" (12 scenes; based on the 1893 story).What can I say about this riveting episode?  There's a unique ""meeting of masterminds"" at 221B Baker Street.  Check out the thrilling ""Final Solution"" at the end of this episode that may spell the end of Sherlock.  Eric Porter as Professor Moriarty does a fantastic job in this role.  A must-see for all Sherlock Holmes' fans.Brett (who made 41 Sherlock Holmes' dramas between 1984 and 1994) is in top-form in these episodes since they were made before the time of his health problems.  He captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performances.The costumes, background music, and especially cinematography are quite well done.  In my case, I found the picture quality and sound quality for this DVD to be almost perfect.Finally, this DVD has 3 extras.  I found these interesting.  Newcomers to the series should especially enjoy them.In conclusion, be sure to view this DVD and see why it won a 1988 Swedish Academy of Detection Award!!(1984;  150 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)+++++",5,"""A Mastermind has been at Work""",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,2002,"['+++++This', 'DVD', 'presents', 'three', '50', 'minute', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'episodes', 'had', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'Sherlock', 'David', 'Burke', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'episode', 'based', 'story', 'written', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', '1859', '1930', 'who', 'wrote', '56', 'short', 'stories', '4', 'novels', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '1', 'Resident', 'Patient', '12', 'scenes', 'based', '1893', 'story', 'wealthy', 'man', 'state', 'mortal', 'dread', 'up', 'practice', 'struggling', 'doctor', 'home', 'Later', 'wealthy', 'man', 'found', 'dead', 'home', 'Was', 'suicide', 'murder', 'Sherlock', '2', 'Red-Headed', 'League', '12', 'scenes', 'based', '1891', 'story', 'businessman', 'second', 'lucrative', 'job', 'condition', 'employment', 'red', 'hair', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'first', 'check', 'out', 'Sherlock', 'Watson', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'later', 'more', 'sinister', 'quotation', 'Sherlock', 'title', 'review', 'episode', '3', 'Final', 'Problem', '12', 'scenes', 'based', '1893', 'story', 'can', 'say', 'riveting', 'episode', 'unique', 'meeting', 'masterminds', '221B', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Check', 'thrilling', 'Final', 'Solution', 'end', 'episode', 'may', 'spell', 'end', 'Sherlock', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Professor', 'Moriarty', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'must-see', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'fans.Brett', 'who', 'made', '41', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'dramas', '1984', '1994', 'top-form', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'time', 'health', 'problems', 'essence', 'famous', 'gumshoe', 'performances.The', 'costumes', 'background', 'music', 'especially', 'cinematography', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'case', 'found', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'be', 'almost', 'perfect.Finally', 'DVD', '3', 'extras', 'found', 'interesting', 'Newcomers', 'series', 'should', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'them.In', 'conclusion', 'be', 'sure', 'view', 'DVD', 'see', 'why', 'won', '1988', 'Swedish', 'Academy', 'Detection', 'Award', '1984', '150', 'min', 'British', 'drama', 'made', 'TV', 'full', 'screen', '+++++']",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)
691301,A37R6FFCXGC4KN,B000060MV1,The Professor,"[0, 0]",Jeremy Brett was the best Sherlock Holmes ever! He leaves Basil Rathbone in his dust. I first saw one of the series in the mid 1980's and was overwhelmed by his performance. In the mid 1970's I had read all sixty of the Holmes stories and Brett just made them come to life. He is the first and only actor to portray Homes the way the character was written. This DVD is worth both your time and your money.,5,Simply the Best,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,405,"['Jeremy', 'Brett', 'was', 'best', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'ever', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'dust', 'first', 'saw', 'one', 'series', 'mid', '1980', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'performance', 'mid', '1970', 'had', 'read', 'sixty', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'Brett', 'just', 'made', 'come', 'life', 'first', 'only', 'actor', 'portray', 'Homes', 'way', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'DVD', 'worth', 'time', 'money']",The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Vol. 5: (The Resident Patient / The Red-Headed League / The Final Problem)
