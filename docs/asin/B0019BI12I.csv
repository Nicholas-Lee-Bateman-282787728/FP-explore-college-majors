1162886,A3ROE64EVHDTTV,B0019BI12I,"AMP ""Al""","[3, 3]","The Good Things*The Blu-Ray has excellent video; it is one of the cleanest, clearest, and shrapest movies I've seen.  Also has some great colors.*Includes the ""Raging Boll"" feature (the notorious clip where director Uwe Boll boxes his critics), director's commentary, and some brief clip where Verne Troyer mocks Indiana Jones.  The cover says ""And much more!"", but that's not true; this is all of the features you get (maybe it's a joke on the cover).*Also includes the PC game ""Postal 2"" (woohoo!).*The comedy is surprisingly great at times.  There are some original jokes, and lots of great funny lines.  Some of it is crazy slapstick, other parts have thought-provoking satire (all the terrorist stuff), other parts yet make good fun of real-life situations (like the job interview scene).*Includes some self-parody.*Pretty good story.  It is well-paced and is hardly dull.*Lots of action scenes throughout, especially at the end.  A few excellent special effects.*The cameramanship is splendid.*Production design is great.  Look out for all sorts of funny text on building signs, billboards, and props.*The acting is great; the characters are quite zany and expressive.  Writing is good, and there are some good funny (perhaps even memorable) lines.  The cast is great; Zach Ward was always great with comedies, and even though everybody else are basically nobodies, they are distinctive and good.  Plus, there are a bunch of hot chicks in it.*Some good music.The Bad Things*The sound quality is generally not bad, but it has some parts that seem to be very loud and other parts that are very low (DTS HD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0).*Special features are in standard definition.*Some parts do seem contrived and are there only for the sickness of it (like when the main character drinks spoiled milk, or the brief male nudity, etc...).The Questionable Things*There is quite a bit of perversity throughout (as promised by the package!).  Expect some toilet humor, violence (including the deaths of many many innocent bystanders; men, women, and children), lots of swearing, gross comedy, etc... Its not too graphic (except for all of the bloody violence), and serves to accentuate the comedy in many areas (it shocks you before delivering a punchline).  But if you're repulsed by such things, you should probably stay away.I know what you're thinking:  ""Uwe Boll sucks and I'll never watch his movies again."" But believe it or not, this one is not so bad, and can even be considered funny and well-made.  This movie succeeds at being a perverse zany comedy.  I'm even surprised as to how much satire and self-parody there is.  Its not the crud I thought it would be; it is respectable and perhaps even a little thought-provoking.  Above all, its pretty funny.  If you have the tolerance for both the director and some sick comedy, you will find this to be great.",4,"""Bring on the monkeys!""",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2865,"['Good', 'Things*The', 'Blu-Ray', 'excellent', 'video', 'one', 'cleanest', 'clearest', 'shrapest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Also', 'great', 'colors', 'Raging', 'Boll', 'feature', 'notorious', 'clip', 'where', 'director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'boxes', 'critics', 'director', 'commentary', 'brief', 'clip', 'where', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'mocks', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'cover', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'true', 'features', 'get', 'maybe', 'joke', 'cover', 'PC', 'game', 'Postal', '2', 'woohoo', '*The', 'comedy', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'times', 'are', 'original', 'jokes', 'lots', 'great', 'funny', 'lines', 'crazy', 'slapstick', 'other', 'parts', 'have', 'thought-provoking', 'satire', 'terrorist', 'stuff', 'other', 'parts', 'yet', 'make', 'good', 'fun', 'real-life', 'situations', 'job', 'interview', 'scene', 'self-parody', '*Pretty', 'good', 'story', 'well-paced', 'hardly', 'dull', '*Lots', 'action', 'scenes', 'especially', 'end', 'few', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', '*The', 'cameramanship', 'splendid', '*Production', 'design', 'great', 'Look', 'out', 'sorts', 'funny', 'text', 'building', 'signs', 'billboards', 'props', '*The', 'acting', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'zany', 'expressive', 'Writing', 'good', 'are', 'good', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'even', 'memorable', 'lines', 'cast', 'great', 'Zach', 'Ward', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'comedies', 'even', 'everybody', 'else', 'are', 'basically', 'nobodies', 'are', 'distinctive', 'good', 'are', 'bunch', 'hot', 'chicks', '*Some', 'good', 'music.The', 'Bad', 'Things*The', 'sound', 'quality', 'generally', 'not', 'bad', 'parts', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'loud', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'low', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', '*Special', 'features', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', '*Some', 'parts', 'do', 'seem', 'contrived', 'are', 'only', 'sickness', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'drinks', 'spoiled', 'milk', 'brief', 'male', 'nudity', 'etc', '.The', 'Questionable', 'Things*There', 'quite', 'bit', 'perversity', 'promised', 'package', 'Expect', 'toilet', 'humor', 'violence', 'including', 'deaths', 'many', 'many', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'lots', 'swearing', 'gross', 'comedy', 'etc', 'not', 'too', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violence', 'accentuate', 'comedy', 'many', 'areas', 'delivering', 'punchline', ""'re"", 'repulsed', 'such', 'things', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away.I', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'sucks', ""'ll"", 'never', 'watch', 'movies', 'again', 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'considered', 'funny', 'well-made', 'movie', 'being', 'perverse', 'zany', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'even', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'satire', 'self-parody', 'not', 'crud', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'respectable', 'perhaps', 'even', 'little', 'thought-provoking', 'pretty', 'funny', 'have', 'tolerance', 'director', 'sick', 'comedy', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'great']",Postal

Much of it is unfunny, tasteless and stupid.  But the upside of a movie that throws so much stuff at the wall is that some of it sticks.  There are some genuinely funny bits and ideas in ""Postal,"" executed with remarkably workmanlike ability.  The whole opening sequence (except for the last few seconds, which don't make any sense in the context of the scene and are there for deliberate tastelessness) is pretty funny.  The rest of ""Postal"" manages to deliver on about that level.I don't know how Boll managed to land Zack Ward and Dave Foley for this movie, but their performances are what make this watchable.  (With the exception of Foley's full frontal nudity.  I respect that he's willing to do that, I guess, but no one wants to see that.)

1162890,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0019BI12I,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","OK, now I'm worried.  Over the last few days, I've actually enjoyed watching two different Uwe Boll films.  Could the man actually have some writing and directing talent, after all?  Nah, I don't think so.  He just got lucky with Rampage, and Postal is mainly a result of Boll letting it all hang out and not taking his job the least bit seriously.  It doesn't take a genius to direct a movie with the tag line ""Disgusting.  Offensive.  Stupid.""  Heck, Boll even dons some lederhosen and puts in a cameo appearance as himself, whereupon he's attacked by the designer of the video game Postal for making such a mockery of this video game adaptation.  It's certainly true that this movie has very little to do with the video game (a great and senselessly violent game I've been an unapologetic supporter of for years), apart from the massive body count and an irreverence toward just about anything and anyone under the sun, but it doesn't really matter in the end because this film is so darn funny.  I get all kinds of giddy just thinking about how deeply offended the politically correct Neanderthals must be by everything that goes on here.The opening scene is one of the funniest in the entire movie, as we watch a couple of Muslim hijackers confront conflicting information about the number of virgins they're supposed to get by their martyrdom.  Radical Islamic terrorism plays a major role throughout the film, as Al Qaeda and Osama ""Sammy"" Bin Laden find their newest jihad plot constantly undermined by a group of crazy cultists executing a plan very much like their own.  Both plan to use a stolen supply of very scarce dolls for their own purposes.  It's just that one group plans to sell them on EBAY to pay the back taxes on their fake church, while the other wants to use them to spread death all over the country.  The hero (for lack of a better word) of the film is a poor schmuck sick and tired of his life in the hellhole of Paradise city - he's unemployed, his wife is the morbidly obese town slut, and his trailer park life is so miserable that he gladly returns to a life of crime alongside his cult leader uncle Dave (Dave Foley, who - I must warn you - appears completely naked in one wholly unnecessary scene) - anything to get out of Paradise, and I don't blame him for that one bit.  The whole story is just sick and twisted, and I couldn't even begin to tell you about all of the hilariously offensive scenes that take place throughout the film.  I think Boll threw everything he could think of at this story, and most of it actually works.I think part of the secret of Postal's success is the fact that Boll seems to know he is making fun of his own infamously bad film career alongside all of the other satire about religion, government, and everything else under the sun.  He obviously didn't care about all of the movie critics he's constantly railing against (or daring to take him on in a boxing match), and that is why he made the film as ridiculous as he possibly could.  Let's just hope he finds time in his busy schedule of pumping out painfully bad movies to put this magical comedy formula to use again someday.",4,"Ridiculously over the top, blatantly offensive, and pretty darn funny",1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,3149,"['OK', 'now', ""'m"", 'worried', 'last', 'few', 'days', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'two', 'different', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'films', 'Could', 'man', 'actually', 'have', 'writing', 'directing', 'talent', 'Nah', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'just', 'got', 'lucky', 'Rampage', 'Postal', 'mainly', 'result', 'Boll', 'letting', 'hang', 'out', 'not', 'taking', 'job', 'least', 'bit', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'take', 'genius', 'direct', 'movie', 'tag', 'line', 'Disgusting', 'Offensive', 'Stupid', 'Heck', 'Boll', 'even', 'lederhosen', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'attacked', 'designer', 'video', 'game', 'Postal', 'making', 'such', 'mockery', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'certainly', 'true', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'video', 'game', 'great', 'senselessly', 'violent', 'game', ""'ve"", 'been', 'unapologetic', 'supporter', 'years', 'apart', 'massive', 'body', 'count', 'irreverence', 'just', 'anything', 'anyone', 'sun', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'darn', 'funny', 'get', 'kinds', 'giddy', 'just', 'thinking', 'how', 'deeply', 'offended', 'politically', 'correct', 'Neanderthals', 'must', 'be', 'everything', 'here.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'one', 'funniest', 'entire', 'movie', 'watch', 'couple', 'Muslim', 'hijackers', 'confront', 'conflicting', 'information', 'number', 'virgins', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'get', 'martyrdom', 'Radical', 'Islamic', 'terrorism', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'Osama', 'Sammy', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'find', 'newest', 'jihad', 'plot', 'constantly', 'undermined', 'group', 'crazy', 'cultists', 'executing', 'plan', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'plan', 'use', 'stolen', 'supply', 'very', 'scarce', 'dolls', 'own', 'purposes', 'just', 'one', 'group', 'sell', 'EBAY', 'pay', 'back', 'taxes', 'fake', 'church', 'other', 'use', 'spread', 'death', 'country', 'hero', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'film', 'poor', 'schmuck', 'sick', 'tired', 'life', 'hellhole', 'Paradise', 'city', 'unemployed', 'wife', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'town', 'slut', 'trailer', 'park', 'life', 'so', 'miserable', 'gladly', 'life', 'crime', 'cult', 'leader', 'uncle', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'who', 'must', 'warn', 'completely', 'naked', 'one', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'anything', 'get', 'Paradise', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'one', 'bit', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'sick', 'twisted', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'tell', 'hilariously', 'offensive', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'think', 'Boll', 'threw', 'everything', 'could', 'think', 'story', 'most', 'actually', 'think', 'part', 'secret', 'Postal', 'success', 'fact', 'Boll', 'know', 'making', 'fun', 'own', 'infamously', 'bad', 'film', 'career', 'other', 'satire', 'religion', 'government', 'everything', 'else', 'sun', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'critics', 'constantly', 'railing', 'daring', 'take', 'boxing', 'match', 'why', 'made', 'film', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'possibly', 'could', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'time', 'busy', 'schedule', 'pumping', 'out', 'painfully', 'bad', 'movies', 'put', 'magical', 'comedy', 'formula', 'use', 'again', 'someday']",Postal

The similarities between Postal the movie and Postal the PC game pretty much end with the title, as Zack Ward (from TV's Titus and Boll's Bloodrayne 2) stars as the Postal Dude; a guy who's sick and tired of his white trash life in the town of Paradise.  Soon enough, he teams up with his cult leader uncle (Dave Foley) in a plot to help themselves out, only to run afoul of the Taliban (led by Osama Bin Laden).  Yup, Postal doesn't make much of a lick of sense, but it doesn't try to either, as Boll pokes fun at everything he can.  From 9/11, to George Bush, to any and every religion, to even Boll himself (who appears in a very funny cameo); Postal is guaranteed to offend (J.K.

I was getting really worried, in fact, that he had finally found a way to make a somewhat successful movie.  I mean, it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible.Well...  then the rest of the movie played, and there's just no way to explain it: he drops the ball, miserably.  It got so bad, at one point a friend who was watching it with me said, ""Man, won't this movie ever end?!"" and another friend pointed out that it had only been playing for an hour and fifteen minutes.  This movie seemed to last an eternity!What Boll is attempting here is to make a broad satire of the United States and general religiosity by pitting one man against The World: a cult, terrorists, random people on the street with guns, the government, the work force, and so on.  He uses the title of a popular videogame but this time doesn't even pretend to make it an ""adaptation,"" in fact deciding instead to only reference the videogame proper by having a character attack him on-screen for ruining the videogame (actually, this scene works out better than you'd think; the most surprising thing about this movie is that Boll actually shows he CAN laugh at himself, which was weird to behold), and a few mentions of the whole ""do videogames create violence?"" issue.  That kind of stuff generally works out, for better or for worse, in this movie.  All of the political stuff really doesn't.  It's either very simplistic ""Bush can't read"" jokes, or long-winded speeches by characters meant to be ironic.What Boll manages to make funny are some of the more random elements: moments of scatological humor, randomly killing a bunch of children, things made of various meats exploding...  At the beginning, when it almost seems like there will be characters, it even seems to be going somewhere.  But about a third of the way in, the movie just goes way off track, and at that point simply drags.  Action scenes go on without end.  An entire thing is made out of getting Verne Troyer (of Mini-Me fame) into the movie simply for a single gag.  The locations themselves keep constantly changing, and Boll can't settle in a single place at all without finding some way to make characters run around for a while until they go back to where they came from.  It gets VERY tiresome VERY quickly.So as much as I was fearing, during the first act, that Boll would disappoint me counter-intuitively by actually being successful, his dependable ineptitude eventually won over and, once again, I treated myself to a feast of pure incompetence.  Yet once again, it is worth noting that this movie is just that much better than the others, and so he still climbs the long, trudging ladder towards the day when he might actually figure what he's doing out.And at least he proves he can laugh at himself.  When all is said and done, a fresh statement is made about an Uwe Boll movie: it could have been worse.--PolarisDiB",2,"Boll hits a target.

As it's unfolding, we sit in open-mouthed astonishment, asking ourselves, ""They're not really going to go there, are they?"" - and, by golly, they do.And that's only for starters.  This satire - about the propensity of human beings to slaughter one another in the name of foolish causes - then goes on to make light of jihadists, the morbidly obese, religious charlatans, apocalyptic preachers, buxom bimbos, tie-dye-wearing flower children, latte drinkers, Asian drivers, sadistic cops, trailer trash, immigrants, civil servants, the handicapped, little people, insincere news reporters, neighborhood watch groups, suicide bombers, neo-Nazis, George W. Bush - you name it, it's in here.  For, if nothing else, ""Postal"" clearly prides itself on being an equal-opportunity offender, and no sacred cow - or not so sacred cow - is safe from its savaging.  It even has little children being shot point-blank by terrorists, replete with blood spewing forth in slow-motion as their lifeless little bodies writhe in the air then hit the ground.  The movie - overflowing as it is with wanton death, destruction and graphic violence - is, you will not be surprised to learn, based on a video game.For their effort to turn ""political incorrectness"" into an art form, writer/director Uwe Boll and co-writer Bryan C. Knight certainly deserve a healthy amount of commendation and praise. In an age when too few comedies are willing to tackle serious subjects, there's something downright refreshing about a group of filmmakers who are willing to display this degree of in-your-face defiance and chutzpah.  But as so often happens with pitch-dark comedies, those who make them often mistake being daring with being funny - and, indeed, too often in ""Postal"" the humor itself falls well short of the mark, leaving only a bitter aftertaste in the end (less because it's offensive than because it's so poorly executed).What story there is centers around a well-meaning schmuck, referred to simply as Dude (the likable Zack Ward), who's unemployed in a bad economy and having a devil of a time finding work, until he meets up with some crazy cultists bent on bringing the Final Days to fruition.  But, basically, the movie is a series of loosely related blackout sketches held together by the barest minimum of a plot and a desire to shock audiences out of their bourgeois complacency.Not unexpectedly, given the movie's rather third-grade level of humor, vomit, poop and male genitalia serve as major sources of comedy in the story.And when Osama bin Laden is telling George W.

Well, at least one of those is correct, and the other two are subjective.  With Postal, our pal Uwe Boll has shown he's as good at making comedy video game adaptations as he is horror video game adaptations.  I know some folks think this film is Boll's redemption, but I'm certainly not one of them(I actually enjoyed Rampage much more).Postal seems extremely forced to me.  It feels as though Boll sat around one weekend and watched Team America: World Police, a few episodes of Family Guy and/or South Park, and maybe a few Troma films for good measure, and said, ""Hey! I can do that!""  So here we get Postal, a movie that subscribes to the bogus philosophy that the more crude and un-PC it is, the funnier is must be!In the film, a guy known as Postal Dude played by Zack Ward(who you'll remember as the bully, Scut Farkus from A Christmas Story-""He had yellow eyes! So help me God, yellow eyes!!"") has a lousy life.  He lives in a sleazy trailer park, his morbidly obese wife is mean as hell and sleeps with just about everybody but her husband, and he can't get a job.  His life changes when he plans a heist with his uncle(David Foley), and he ends up in a series of misadventures that ultimately have him playing hero in a terrorist plot to release a bird flu epidemic on the U.S.(orchestrated by Osama Bin Ladin, who's in cahoots with George Bush).So yes, the film is an onslaught of vulgar humor and outrageousness, minus any wit.  A makeshift pistol silencer is made by sodomizing a cat with the gun barrel and firing through the cat's mouth, there many graphic sex scenes with Postal Dude's wife having sex with various men, and an ongoing joke about how these guys can't find certain parts of her anatomy(Hardy Har Har), a corrupt cop shoots a woman for not going during a green light and steals donations from a handicapped man who he keeps in his garage(Ho Ho Ho), Postal Dude runs down a baby in a stroller with his truck while picking at a hangnail.Vern Troyer is on hand too(not that anyone cares about this guy), but his role exist solely for the purpose of one gag where in order to fulfill a apocalyptic prophecy, he is ""raped by 1,000 monkeys""(they're actually chimpanzees).Does this all sound funny to you?  If so, don't delay another minute!  Hell, I'm no prude, I'm a John Waters fan for crying out loud, but this movie just seems so forced.  You can practically hear Boll screaming, ""Look! See! I can do other stuff!""Now, with any film that crams nonstop gags in, some are likely to slip through and give you a chuckle or two, and Postal is no different.  Boll plays himself(I think) at one point and pokes fun at his image, and is attacked by the creator of the Postal video game.  I kinda liked that.I can understand that Boll wants to shed the reputation he has built for himself, and in some of his recent films, he is showing us that he is capable of more than we thought, but Postal is just too desperate of an attempt.",2,Boll Makes A Comedy-Intentionally This Time,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,3008,"['tagline', 'Postal', 'Disgusting', 'Offensive', 'Stupid', 'Well', 'least', 'one', 'correct', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'subjective', 'Postal', 'pal', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'shown', 'as', 'good', 'making', 'comedy', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'horror', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'know', 'folks', 'think', 'film', 'Boll', 'redemption', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Rampage', 'much', 'more', '.Postal', 'extremely', 'forced', 'Boll', 'sat', 'one', 'weekend', 'watched', 'Team', 'America', 'World', 'Police', 'few', 'episodes', 'Family', 'Guy', 'South', 'Park', 'maybe', 'few', 'Troma', 'films', 'good', 'measure', 'said', 'Hey', 'can', 'do', 'So', 'here', 'get', 'Postal', 'movie', 'bogus', 'philosophy', 'more', 'crude', 'un-PC', 'funnier', 'must', 'be', 'film', 'guy', 'known', 'Postal', 'Dude', 'played', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'who', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'bully', 'Scut', 'Farkus', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story-', 'had', 'yellow', 'eyes', 'So', 'help', 'God', 'yellow', 'eyes', 'lousy', 'life', 'sleazy', 'trailer', 'park', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'wife', 'mean', 'hell', 'sleeps', 'just', 'everybody', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'heist', 'uncle', 'David', 'Foley', 'up', 'series', 'misadventures', 'ultimately', 'have', 'playing', 'hero', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'release', 'bird', 'flu', 'epidemic', 'U.S.', 'orchestrated', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'who', 'cahoots', 'George', 'Bush', '.So', 'yes', 'film', 'onslaught', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'outrageousness', 'wit', 'makeshift', 'pistol', 'silencer', 'made', 'sodomizing', 'cat', 'gun', 'barrel', 'firing', 'cat', 'mouth', 'many', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Postal', 'Dude', 'wife', 'having', 'sex', 'various', 'men', 'ongoing', 'joke', 'how', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'certain', 'parts', 'anatomy', 'Hardy', 'Har', 'Har', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'shoots', 'woman', 'not', 'going', 'green', 'light', 'steals', 'donations', 'handicapped', 'man', 'who', 'garage', 'Ho', 'Ho', 'Ho', 'Postal', 'Dude', 'down', 'baby', 'stroller', 'truck', 'picking', 'hangnail.Vern', 'Troyer', 'hand', 'too', 'not', 'anyone', 'guy', 'role', 'exist', 'solely', 'purpose', 'one', 'gag', 'where', 'order', 'fulfill', 'apocalyptic', 'prophecy', 'raped', '1,000', 'monkeys', ""'re"", 'actually', 'chimpanzees', 'sound', 'funny', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'delay', 'minute', 'Hell', ""'m"", 'prude', ""'m"", 'John', 'Waters', 'fan', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'forced', 'can', 'practically', 'hear', 'Boll', 'screaming', 'Look', 'See', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'stuff', 'Now', 'film', 'nonstop', 'gags', 'are', 'likely', 'slip', 'give', 'chuckle', 'two', 'Postal', 'different', 'Boll', 'think', 'one', 'point', 'pokes', 'fun', 'image', 'attacked', 'creator', 'Postal', 'video', 'game', 'kinda', 'liked', 'that.I', 'can', 'understand', 'Boll', 'shed', 'reputation', 'built', 'recent', 'films', 'showing', 'capable', 'more', 'thought', 'Postal', 'just', 'too', 'desperate', 'attempt']",Postal
