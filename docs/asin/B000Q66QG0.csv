1073719,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B000Q66QG0,Adam B. Krenn,"[4, 4]","...a vampire film that doesn't suck (ok, pun intended).  If you have read the wonderful (yet hard to find) Vampire novel; The Vampire Tapestry, then this film will seem very familiar.  What is important to note is this movie is free of the Made for TV cheese and the Hyper Goth/Romanti-Erotic BS so common in most modern Vampire stories.  Without giving too much away, it is the perceived and then logically deduced relationship of the human regarding his Vampire captive that truly make this movie above even most higher budget Vampire films.  Sure, the production value is weak at times and gaps in the character's logic (well, one character named Javi, anyway) but I have to applaud the writer/director's desire to show a vampire as a cold and calculating hunter with a shadow of it's once human life.  The leads are both actually quite good as is Michael Biehn in the only really good supporting role in the film.

1073720,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B000Q66QG0,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[2, 2]","The Insatiable is a rather original vampire film, I watch allot of them and I have not seen a story quite like this before. The movie is about a shy, timid man who get targeted by a beautiful vampire woman. Like in many films the nobody turned protagonist teams up with a vampire hunter and get advice on how to kill the creature, but when push comes to show our hero is incapable of killing the lovely Tatiana, instead he takes her captive, to prevent her from killing more people and most of the movie is about the protagonist, Harry, falling for his supernatural prisoner and about how far he is willing to go to keep her alive.At times the Insatiable is a little long drawn, the acting is rather uneven, it go from awful to pretty good. It is also obvious that this film had rather low production value so do not expect Hollywood quality, however when all is said and done I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Allot of cheap vampire films is about nudity and gore, The Insatiable however is more about the strange relationship which develops between Tatiana and Harry. I really enjoyed watching this movie, for what it is this movie is very good, the story is interesting and the characters are involving.This movie do not have much gore, so if that is what you are after this is probably not for you, The Insatiable is more drama than traditional horror, and oddly enough it is one of the few movies who actually manages to portray vampires as tragic, and that without getting all emo about it. If you are looking for vampire movie with an original plot and which are a little different from the rest then you can definitely do worse than The Insatiable.I love watching B horror movies, one of the joys of this movie is discovering gems that have passed under the mainstream radar. The Insatiable is definitely one such gem, sure the movie have it's flaws, but all in all it is a good, solid, satisfying vampire movie, and one I am sure I will be watching more than once, I am glad I bought this DVD.",4,Suprisingly good vampire film.,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2010,"['Insatiable', 'rather', 'original', 'vampire', 'film', 'watch', 'allot', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'story', 'quite', 'before', 'movie', 'shy', 'timid', 'man', 'who', 'get', 'targeted', 'beautiful', 'vampire', 'woman', 'many', 'films', 'nobody', 'turned', 'protagonist', 'teams', 'up', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'get', 'advice', 'how', 'kill', 'creature', 'when', 'push', 'show', 'hero', 'incapable', 'killing', 'lovely', 'Tatiana', 'instead', 'captive', 'prevent', 'killing', 'more', 'people', 'most', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'Harry', 'falling', 'supernatural', 'prisoner', 'how', 'far', 'willing', 'go', 'keep', 'alive.At', 'Insatiable', 'little', 'long', 'drawn', 'acting', 'rather', 'uneven', 'go', 'awful', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'obvious', 'film', 'had', 'rather', 'low', 'production', 'value', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'quality', 'however', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'Allot', 'cheap', 'vampire', 'films', 'nudity', 'gore', 'Insatiable', 'however', 'more', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Tatiana', 'Harry', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'involving.This', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'gore', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'Insatiable', 'more', 'drama', 'traditional', 'horror', 'oddly', 'enough', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'who', 'actually', 'portray', 'vampires', 'tragic', 'getting', 'emo', 'are', 'looking', 'vampire', 'movie', 'original', 'plot', 'are', 'little', 'different', 'rest', 'then', 'can', 'definitely', 'do', 'worse', 'Insatiable.I', 'love', 'watching', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'joys', 'movie', 'discovering', 'gems', 'have', 'passed', 'mainstream', 'radar', 'Insatiable', 'definitely', 'one', 'such', 'gem', 'sure', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'good', 'solid', 'satisfying', 'vampire', 'movie', 'one', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD']",N/A

Jenkins,"[2, 3]","An extremely worthwhile effort on a shoestring out of Austin, featuring an actress named Charlotte Ayana who delivers an entirely new take on the vampire legend. She's worth keeping an eye on in the future. She's a doll, she's a dish, but she's also a hell of an actress.It's described as a black comedy but don't let that put you off, there are no big laughs, it's not a parody. It instead creates and maintains an unusual and captivating mood, and doesn't always head in the direction you expect it to.It's not scary in the slightest and gore fans should look elsewhere... but what it does deliver are small traces of genuine emotion, such as a moving and very convincing moment which I won't describe in detail where the vampire says to our hero ""I don't want to kill you."" Very heartfelt acting on everyone's part in that scene, actually quite touching. It speaks with more than a bit of eloquence to one's helplessness in the face of love.The film looks great, it's nicely paced, well written, all in all a winner. Only truly unbelievable scenes (hence the lack of a fifth star) are those where our hero initially resists the opportunities presented by the stereotypically blonde Young, Dumb and ___ of ___ neighbor - and her reaction to his eventual advances.Not a Great Film by any stretch but a very, VERY good little movie which sustains more interest than virtually any blockbuster I've seen this year and at literally 1/100th the production budget.

It took it's time to set up the story and the plot. It was actually 45 minutes in before our protagonist actually captures the co-star of the film, the not-really-evil vampire, Tatiana. That's good, because it really fleshes out the plot, characters and the story. Like, we get to see Harry try to call the police and reach out for help several times before having to capture Tatiana himself as a very last resort. In most movies, the director or writer won't care enough to explain any of that. I wish we could've gotten to see how Tatiana was turned, but it's okay. There are other enjoyable characters in it too, such as the dispicable co-worker Javier, the supportive Paul Rudd look-alike co-worker and the Vietnam vet who lost his legs to a 90 pound vampire woman in the jungle during the war and spends his remaining years tracking them down online.

This is a pretty good description of the vampire horror/comedy ""Fright Night"" (1985), which I highly recommend for fans of the genre. 2006's ""The Insatiable"" borrows heavily from ""Fright Night"" for its basic premise, but neglects to also borrow any of the excitement, humor, good conversation, and most everything else that make the original film work. To some extent the same could be said about the segments it borrows from ""Clerks"" (1994), which are not done as well as the original but still leave the viewer wishing they had borrowed more and created less.""The Insatiable's"" 103-minute running length is very front-end loaded. It sets itself up to be another Fright Night"" but the wheels fall off at the midway point and the thing dully limps along until it recovers somewhat with a decent closing scene.It does manage to put most of its tiny budget on the screen in a professional manner and should get high marks for the crew's hard work. But it is one of those sow's ears to silk purse things where you just can't do much with such a weak script.It is a depressing lost opportunity because Sean Patrick Flanery and Michael Biehn could have carried a film of this nature if they had more parody and exploitation elements to work with; their scenes together are excellent. The vampire (Tatiana) is played by a middle age woman named Charlotte Ayanna; her acting is more listless than bad so it is not a particularly good mockfest candidate. I doubt if even Leighton Meester could have done much with the lines they wrote for Tatiana, although she would have looked better even in Titiana's dreary thrift shop wardrobe.Co-Directors Cory Solomon and Chuck Konzelman seem pretty much clueless about acting for the camera direction.The DVD thankfully has no commentary feature.Then again, what do I know?

I suppose I could get into a mood where I could get a lot of laughs out of it, thinking, ""That dumb nerd was so hard up that he let some sexy chick lead him around by ""the nose"" and drag him down even though he knew she was a vampire. It was hysterical!""Or, I could get into a mood where I would say, ""This is just an example of how guys so typically go crazy over sex and can't think straight. Sure. But there could have been more blood and less talk, dude.""But actually I was in a mood to find it extremely creepy. There have been a lot of films about how guys can be driven into terrible compulsions by sex or some emotional longing. Baby Doll comes to mind. Rain/Miss Sadie Thompson. Reflections in a Golden Eye. Apartment Zero. We can all think of films we have seen. And terrible crimes of passion are on the TV every day. The hungry heart commonly makes fools of people and even criminals and this is an important theme about human nature that has been worked and reworked.This film could be placed in that genre but is distinctive in a few ways. Obviously using a captive vampire as the object of desire should get an A for imagination and taking risks.Also, there was indeed a lot of talk, and that worked for me. Without the dialogue the basic theme of a lonely guy falling for a vampire would have been over the top and probably not very interesting to me personally. The mind games that the vampire played with Harry were interesting to follow, as well as the mind games that he was playing with himself and his struggles with denial and rationalization. The film did not stoop to hamming this up and the director and actors did a pretty darned good job playing it straight. I very much appreciated the drama taking place in the mind games in the dialogue. There were some moral dilemmas and conflicts of interest with some substance to them and I wondered how they would come out.",4,13th review,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2161,"['horror', 'obsession', 'point', 'self-destruction', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'me.I', 'am', '13th', 'reviewer', 'other', 'reviews', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'film', 'think', 'can', 'add', 'few', 'things.Boy', 'can', 'imagine', 'sorts', 'different', 'reactions', 'film', 'suppose', 'could', 'get', 'mood', 'where', 'could', 'get', 'lot', 'laughs', 'thinking', 'dumb', 'nerd', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'up', 'let', 'sexy', 'chick', 'lead', 'around', 'nose', 'drag', 'down', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'vampire', 'was', 'hysterical', 'could', 'get', 'mood', 'where', 'would', 'say', 'just', 'example', 'how', 'guys', 'so', 'typically', 'go', 'crazy', 'sex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'straight', 'Sure', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'blood', 'less', 'talk', 'dude', 'actually', 'was', 'mood', 'find', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'films', 'how', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'driven', 'terrible', 'compulsions', 'sex', 'emotional', 'longing', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'mind', 'Rain/Miss', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'Reflections', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'Apartment', 'Zero', 'can', 'think', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'terrible', 'crimes', 'passion', 'are', 'TV', 'day', 'hungry', 'heart', 'commonly', 'fools', 'people', 'even', 'criminals', 'important', 'theme', 'human', 'nature', 'been', 'worked', 'reworked.This', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'genre', 'distinctive', 'few', 'ways', 'Obviously', 'using', 'captive', 'vampire', 'object', 'desire', 'should', 'get', 'A', 'imagination', 'taking', 'risks.Also', 'was', 'indeed', 'lot', 'talk', 'worked', 'dialogue', 'basic', 'theme', 'lonely', 'guy', 'falling', 'vampire', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'personally', 'mind', 'games', 'vampire', 'played', 'Harry', 'were', 'interesting', 'follow', 'as', 'well', 'mind', 'games', 'was', 'playing', 'struggles', 'denial', 'rationalization', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'stoop', 'hamming', 'up', 'director', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'straight', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'drama', 'taking', 'place', 'mind', 'games', 'dialogue', 'were', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'substance', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'come', 'out']",N/A
1073733,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000Q66QG0,P. Mann,"[33, 33]","I am not a great connoisseur of vampire lore, and perhaps that fact helped me enjoy this film. What helped more, though, were three of the actors: Sean Patrick Flanery as the improbable vampire hunter, Charlotte Ayanna as the vampire, and Michael Biehn as the veteran of too many encounters with vampires. These three carry the movie and make any scene with two of them in it worth watching.The plot: Harry Balbo works at a flange company and lives in an apartment building, of which he is the super (in exchange for a rent reduction). He seems to have no social life, which explains why he must listen to a coworker (Jon Huertas) brag incessantly about his sexual prowess and conquests. One night, Balbo witnesses a vampire attack. Before long, he finds himself marked by the vampire and seeks help online. This leads him to Strickland (Biehl), who tells him to kill the vampire. The problem, though, is that Balbo finds himself unable to kill her. Instead, he lures her into a trap.The bulk of the movie involves Balbo and the vampire in a bizarre sort of relationship--always assuming, of course, that a relationship in which one of the pair is caged constitutes your definition of bizarre. Here, the film succeeds. Ayanna is wonderful as the vampire with a soul, and Flanery admirably conveys a man completely out of his depth. Somehow, they establish a rapport that made me want to keep watching.""The Insatiable"" is a low-budget film, to be certain, but it makes good use of its few locations and is not as completely derivative as its bigger-budget contemporaries. At the heart of the film is the relationship between Balbo and the vampire, and we are never quite sure what to make of this relationship. Of course, she is a vampire and therefore a killer (as she helpfully reminds him), but Ayanna conveys a tenderness and vulnerability that made me root for the relationship in spite of that problem.""The Insatiable"" is not a great film, but it is fun to watch for the most part.",3,A quirky but generally enjoyable film,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,1986,"['am', 'not', 'great', 'connoisseur', 'vampire', 'lore', 'perhaps', 'fact', 'helped', 'enjoy', 'film', 'What', 'helped', 'more', 'were', 'three', 'actors', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'improbable', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'vampire', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'veteran', 'too', 'many', 'encounters', 'vampires', 'three', 'carry', 'movie', 'make', 'scene', 'two', 'watching.The', 'plot', 'Harry', 'Balbo', 'flange', 'company', 'lives', 'apartment', 'building', 'super', 'exchange', 'rent', 'reduction', 'have', 'social', 'life', 'why', 'must', 'listen', 'coworker', 'Jon', 'Huertas', 'brag', 'incessantly', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'conquests', 'One', 'night', 'Balbo', 'vampire', 'attack', 'long', 'marked', 'vampire', 'help', 'online', 'Strickland', 'Biehl', 'who', 'kill', 'vampire', 'problem', 'though', 'Balbo', 'unable', 'kill', 'Instead', 'trap.The', 'bulk', 'movie', 'Balbo', 'vampire', 'bizarre', 'sort', 'relationship', 'always', 'assuming', 'course', 'relationship', 'one', 'pair', 'caged', 'constitutes', 'definition', 'bizarre', 'Here', 'film', 'Ayanna', 'wonderful', 'vampire', 'soul', 'Flanery', 'admirably', 'conveys', 'man', 'completely', 'depth', 'Somehow', 'establish', 'rapport', 'made', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'Insatiable', 'low-budget', 'film', 'be', 'certain', 'good', 'use', 'few', 'locations', 'not', 'completely', 'derivative', 'bigger-budget', 'contemporaries', 'heart', 'film', 'relationship', 'Balbo', 'vampire', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'relationship', 'course', 'vampire', 'therefore', 'killer', 'helpfully', 'Ayanna', 'tenderness', 'vulnerability', 'made', 'root', 'relationship', 'spite', 'problem', 'Insatiable', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'part']",N/A

It keeps not happening, but I keep watching his movies just in case. The end result is that I end up watching movies like The Insatiable, a film so monstrously bad that I watched the first half of it, had to go do something else, then came back a week later and completely forgot I'd watched the first half until I was twenty minutes into my second viewing.  This is a soul-sucking, sanity-destroying waste of time that actually had a few interesting ideas in its premise, but failed to deliver on every count.Harry Balbo (Flanery) is a meek, mousy guy who gets bossed around at work, then comes home and gets bossed around by the other tenants in his building. His life is just going on day after day until people around him start dying. He eventually finds out that they're being killed by a vampire (Jawbreaker's Charlotte Ayana), and in order to stop her from killing again, he constructs a massive steel cage in the building's basement, then lures her into it. (None of the other tenants, of course, notice the construction.) All goes relatively well until he finds himself falling for her...There are a couple of scenes after Harry gets her into the cage where it seemed to me as if the directors meant this as a commentary on regular human relationships, and I really kind of liked the idea of that. If that's what they intended, however, it's so undeveloped as to be nothing more than the ghost of a breath. The acting is ludicrous (save for some scenes containing Michael Biehn as a hopped-up wheelchair-bound vampire hunter), the script doubly so. Please don't waste your time on this; if you're looking for the aggressively mediocre, I'm sure Uwe Boll has released six or seven awful movies this month that are still many times better than The Insatiable.

So I'd peruse the shelves in the Horror section of my local bookstore in search of alternatives, and there'd be a ton of paperback titles and authors to choose from.The alternatives all had cool looking images on their covers, and the back covers always made the stories sound like just what I was looking for in a Horror title...but you know what they say about judging books by their covers. And that old axiom rang true 90% of the time.Same thing with movies. You get these solicitations to try this DVD or that DVD ""based on your past purchases"", but you wonder why you've never heard of them before the solicitation. So along comes The Insatiable.So I'm like: Hmmm...has a good cover. Plus The Insatiable has Michael Biehn it (The Terminator&Aliens)...ohhh...but he was in those a long time ago. Plus The Insatiable has Sean Patrick Flanery in it...oops I thought Sean Patrick Flanery was Seann William Scott (not that Scott's a real draw either). Oh well.So I approached THINKFilm's The Insatiable with the same wariness of one of those mass-produced, unknown author, paperback titles with the forward by some famous author. And I was pleasantly surprised by The Insatiable. The movie was pretty good...unlike the too-many-to-count pulp disappointments that I was rewarded with for judging a book by its cover.But The Insatiable isn't scary. It's more of an interesting take on a vampire story with some dark (sometimes not dark) humor. Have you seen 2007's excellent sleeper Black Snake MoanBlack Snake Moan? The Insatiable has a similar plot: Hold a Young Girl Against Her Will in Order to Make Her a Better Person. Well, in The Insatiable's case...make a young girl a better vampire.THINKFilm's direct to DVD empire was recently acquired by Time Warner.

A serial killer who rips the heads off of each victim.  Turns out it's a pretty girl who drinks blood and can leap into a second-story window from a standing start.  It's always who you least expect, isn't it?  Naturally, the police think he's insane.  So while trying to catch a peep show from an acquaintance whose been bragging about his new sex-crazed girlfriend he witnesses the same girl feeding on said acquaintance.  She manages to scratch him and get a taste of the blood and our protagonist runs into the night, having gotten more than his jollies.  Scouring the internet for other true believers, he comes into contact with a paraplegic vampire hunter who makes it his business to track the creatures of the night.  Turns out that once a vampire tastes your blood, they can follow you anywhere.  Long story short: man has no balls and winds up with his own pet vampire.""The Insatiable"" has an decent if uninspired premise but suffers from a thoroughly unlikeable protagonist and an underdeveloped supporting cast.  Charlotte Ayanna is pitch perfect in her role as Tatiana (even her name is hot), and she's what really makes this movie work.  There is also a pretty good subplot about one of Harry's cute neighbors who seems to be the classic ""sexy girl next door pursuing clueless but good-hearted nerd"" type, but turns out to be the kind of woman many of us so-called ""nice guys"" are all too familiar with.  Nice touch.  The main story manages to touch on some very nice underlying relationship themes as well; one of which being people who lock their spouses into loveless relationships in the hope that their fundamental differences will some day just resolve themselves and it will be all happily ever after some day.  I like.Unfortunately, this is a movie that doesn't deliver on some counts.  There are a few solid gore shots as well as some twisted humor, but when one watches a movie with this premise and a title like ""The Insatiable"" you expect a bit more exploitation.  Tatiana uses her nuclear arsenal of sex appeal to manipulate Harry throughout the film, but apparently is a very modest undead seductress of the night as she never even attempts to show some skin.  Harry himself is embarrassing to watch at times and never really had me thinking ""gee, I hope that guy doesn't die a horrible, blood-spurting death"".  That fact alone detracts from the tension that should be built up in a movie like this.  The vampire hunter bit was very interesting, but was dropped like a hot potato once it's use as a plot device was over and the succubus was in her cage.I figured there were only two ways to end the story and neither of them were very satisfying to me, but ""The Insatiable"" came through for me in the end with a conclusion that was dark, ironic, amusing, and utterly and completely fitting for all characters involved.  That gets it out of the ""meh"" area and into the ""check it out"" zone with me.  If you are a major vampire nut who can't get enough of the ladies in black then this is a decent little horror flick.  Don't go in expecting a lot of sex and violence; go in for a hot leading lady, a few chills, a little fun, some insight into the awkwardness of human relationships, and an ending that will have you smiling a black little smile.",3,For the vampire fanatic whose got everything.,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,4262,"['mean', 'come', 'what', 'horror', 'geek', ""n't"", 'want', 'impossibly', 'sexy', 'vampire', 'seductress', 'locked', 'away', 'basement', 'Got', 'real', 'jerk', 'coworker', 'bothering', 'job', 'Hook', 'man', 'up', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'can', 'resist', 'mysterious', 'attraction', 'ofWomen', 'Cages', 'See', 'even', 'make', 'movies', 'nothing', 'else', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'A-holes', 'handy', 'can', 'always', 'feed', 'adorable', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'whispering', 'sweet', 'nothings', 'mind', 'middle', 'night', 'keeping', 'pesky', 'repairmen', 'away', 'girl', 'how', 'work', 'chair', 'name', 'was', 'Janet', 'Jackson', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'get', 'one', 'she-vamps', 'very', 'own', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'think', 'way', 'broach', 'topic', 'wife', 'though.So', 'Insatiable', 'then', 'Not', 'bad', 'flick', 'Not', 'great', 'can', 'think', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'hour-and-a-half', 'story', 'out', 'thoroughly', 'average', 'man', 'one', 'Harry', 'Balbo', 'witnessing', 'serial', 'killer', 'work', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'heads', 'victim', 'out', 'pretty', 'girl', 'who', 'blood', 'can', 'leap', 'second-story', 'window', 'standing', 'start', 'always', 'who', 'least', 'expect', ""n't"", 'Naturally', 'police', 'think', 'insane', 'So', 'trying', 'catch', 'peep', 'show', 'acquaintance', 'been', 'bragging', 'new', 'sex-crazed', 'girlfriend', 'same', 'girl', 'feeding', 'said', 'acquaintance', 'scratch', 'get', 'taste', 'blood', 'protagonist', 'night', 'having', 'gotten', 'more', 'jollies', 'Scouring', 'internet', 'other', 'true', 'believers', 'contact', 'paraplegic', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'who', 'business', 'track', 'creatures', 'night', 'out', 'once', 'vampire', 'blood', 'can', 'follow', 'anywhere', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'man', 'balls', 'up', 'own', 'pet', 'vampire', 'Insatiable', 'decent', 'uninspired', 'premise', 'suffers', 'thoroughly', 'unlikeable', 'protagonist', 'underdeveloped', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'role', 'Tatiana', 'even', 'name', 'hot', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'work', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'subplot', 'one', 'Harry', 'cute', 'neighbors', 'who', 'be', 'classic', 'sexy', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'pursuing', 'clueless', 'good-hearted', 'nerd', 'type', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'woman', 'many', 'so-called', 'nice', 'guys', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'Nice', 'touch', 'main', 'story', 'manages', 'touch', 'very', 'nice', 'underlying', 'relationship', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'being', 'people', 'who', 'lock', 'spouses', 'loveless', 'relationships', 'hope', 'fundamental', 'differences', 'will', 'day', 'just', 'resolve', 'will', 'be', 'happily', 'ever', 'day', 'like.Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'counts', 'are', 'few', 'solid', 'gore', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'twisted', 'humor', 'when', 'one', 'movie', 'premise', 'title', 'Insatiable', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'exploitation', 'Tatiana', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'sex', 'appeal', 'manipulate', 'Harry', 'film', 'apparently', 'very', 'modest', 'undead', 'seductress', 'night', 'never', 'even', 'attempts', 'show', 'skin', 'Harry', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'thinking', 'gee', 'hope', 'guy', ""n't"", 'die', 'horrible', 'blood-spurting', 'death', 'fact', 'alone', 'tension', 'should', 'be', 'built', 'up', 'movie', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'bit', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'was', 'dropped', 'hot', 'potato', 'use', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'over', 'succubus', 'was', 'cage.I', 'figured', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'ways', 'end', 'story', 'were', 'very', 'satisfying', 'Insatiable', 'came', 'end', 'conclusion', 'was', 'dark', 'ironic', 'amusing', 'utterly', 'completely', 'fitting', 'characters', 'involved', 'meh', 'area', 'check', 'out', 'zone', 'are', 'major', 'vampire', 'nut', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'ladies', 'black', 'then', 'decent', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'lot', 'sex', 'violence', 'go', 'hot', 'leading', 'lady', 'few', 'chills', 'little', 'fun', 'insight', 'awkwardness', 'human', 'relationships', 'ending', 'will', 'have', 'smiling', 'black', 'little', 'smile']",N/A
1073739,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000Q66QG0,trebe,"[0, 0]","The performances of Sean Patrick Flannery, and Charlotte Ayanna, as a sexy vampire, are what make The Insatiable (2007) a horror/romance worth watching.  The PG-13ish tale features little violence or gore, and instead is built around the strange relationship that evolves between the two main characters.One night after leaving a convenience store, Harry Balbo (Flannery) sees what appears to be a woman, biting the neck of a bum.  The creature rips the man's head off and flees, high jumping through a window of a nearby building.  The police don't believe him, but Balbo is convinced he seen a vampire, and locates a vampire expert named Strickland (Michael Biehn) on the internet.  In a remarkable coincidence, the wheelchair bound Strickland lives in the same apartment building where Balbo is manager.  Following Strickland's advice, Balbo locates the vampire's daytime lair, but when the vampire named Tatiana (Ayanna) begs for her life, he is unable to drive a stake through her heart.  According to Strickland, it is only a matter of time until the vampire tracks him down, so Balbo puts a plan into action, and manages to trap Tatiana in a steel cage he has constructed in the basement of his apartment building.  Things get more complicated as to keep his prisoner alive, Balbo has to somehow get her the fresh blood she needs to survive.Some of the plot elements in The Insatiable are rather weak in the credibility department.  Balbo does some outrageous things, like requisitioning the materials to build the cage from his place of work, and disposing human remains in a dumpster where he works.  Vampires evidently don't excrete any waste, as Tatiana doesn't even get a bucket for a toilet.Truly striking, with eyes that sparkle, Charlotte Ayanna (Dancing At The Blue Iguana) puts the `vamp' in vampire, as Tatiana, who is more vulnerable than threatening.  Once imprisoned, Tatiana employs her charms to entice Balbo to turn her loose, but (unfortunately) nothing explicit is shown.  For the DVD cover, a dreadful attempt is made to make Ayanna look frightening, but thankfully she looks nothing like that in the film.  Sean Patrick Flannery is pretty convincing as the shaky and confused loser, who has so little going in his life, that he sacrifices the lives of others to keep his prize alive.  Michael Biehn is enjoyable as the edgy paranoid Strickland, and Amanda Noret (Veronica Mars) also gives a good performance as Balbo's quirky neighbor.With some engaging performances by the leads, and solid acting from the supporting cast, it's not that hard ignore the film's faults and buy into the story.  The Insatiable is a good choice when you are looking for some mild vampire thrills, with minimal violence.  Forget about buying a DVD-R copy, if you can get a real DVD version used for less.",3,"ignore the DVD cover, Charlotte Ayanna makes a very sexy vampire!",1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2811,"['performances', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'sexy', 'vampire', 'are', 'make', 'Insatiable', '2007', 'horror/romance', 'worth', 'watching', 'PG-13ish', 'tale', 'features', 'little', 'violence', 'gore', 'instead', 'built', 'strange', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters.One', 'night', 'leaving', 'convenience', 'store', 'Harry', 'Balbo', 'Flannery', 'what', 'be', 'woman', 'biting', 'neck', 'bum', 'creature', 'man', 'head', 'flees', 'high', 'jumping', 'window', 'nearby', 'building', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Balbo', 'convinced', 'seen', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'expert', 'named', 'Strickland', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'internet', 'remarkable', 'coincidence', 'wheelchair', 'Strickland', 'same', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'Balbo', 'manager', 'Following', 'Strickland', 'advice', 'Balbo', 'vampire', 'daytime', 'lair', 'when', 'vampire', 'named', 'Tatiana', 'Ayanna', 'begs', 'life', 'unable', 'drive', 'stake', 'heart', 'According', 'Strickland', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'vampire', 'down', 'so', 'Balbo', 'plan', 'action', 'trap', 'Tatiana', 'steel', 'cage', 'constructed', 'basement', 'apartment', 'building', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'keep', 'prisoner', 'alive', 'Balbo', 'somehow', 'get', 'fresh', 'blood', 'survive.Some', 'plot', 'elements', 'Insatiable', 'are', 'rather', 'weak', 'credibility', 'department', 'Balbo', 'outrageous', 'things', 'requisitioning', 'materials', 'build', 'cage', 'place', 'work', 'disposing', 'human', 'dumpster', 'where', 'Vampires', 'evidently', 'do', ""n't"", 'excrete', 'waste', 'Tatiana', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'bucket', 'toilet.Truly', 'striking', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'Dancing', 'Blue', 'Iguana', 'vamp', 'vampire', 'Tatiana', 'who', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'threatening', 'Once', 'imprisoned', 'Tatiana', 'charms', 'entice', 'Balbo', 'turn', 'loose', 'unfortunately', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'shown', 'DVD', 'cover', 'dreadful', 'attempt', 'made', 'make', 'Ayanna', 'look', 'frightening', 'thankfully', 'nothing', 'film', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'shaky', 'confused', 'loser', 'who', 'so', 'little', 'going', 'life', 'lives', 'others', 'keep', 'prize', 'alive', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'enjoyable', 'edgy', 'paranoid', 'Strickland', 'Amanda', 'Noret', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'Balbo', 'quirky', 'engaging', 'performances', 'leads', 'solid', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'hard', 'ignore', 'film', 'faults', 'buy', 'story', 'Insatiable', 'good', 'choice', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'mild', 'vampire', 'thrills', 'minimal', 'violence', 'Forget', 'buying', 'DVD-R', 'copy', 'can', 'get', 'real', 'DVD', 'version', 'used', 'less']",N/A
