On the other hand this is a classic Alice show that a older fan shouldn't miss. One of his best stage shows and bands in my opinion. Too bad not a cleaner copy but this is all we have from this tour.

1531941,A1TNLP8YZIDV8P,B007JZFX42,Jeffer,"[3, 3]","From the Inside is one of my favorite albums by Alice after the original band broke up, and he went solo, so I am glad to see this show finally on DVD.  It is a different stage show, more dancing than others, and some of the songs were not performed again after this tour.  The instrumental/dancing segment during the first song (On the Inside), has always been alot of fun.  Alice's voice on certain songs (I Never Cry, The Quiet Room, How You Gonna See Me Now), doesn't sound right to me.  His phrasing and tone is very different from the studio recordings.  It is a fun concert though, and Alice's onstage banter during School's Out and the band intros is terrific.As others have said, the video and audio quality is not as good as it could be.  It's watchable, but I was expecting better.The only extra on the DVD is Alice's commentary and it is sparse as other reviewers have written.  He talks about bit about the band and makes other comments, but says very little about how the show was developed. His wife, Sheryl, is the lead dancer in the show and helped choreograph it.  She should have been included in on the commentary.I'm a hard core fan so I'm glad I picked this up, and it is low-priced.  If you are new to Alice Cooper, you might want to track down one of his newer DVDs, like Theatre of Death.",3,Probably only for hard core Cooper fans,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1313,"['Inside', 'one', 'favorite', 'albums', 'Alice', 'original', 'band', 'broke', 'up', 'went', 'solo', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'show', 'finally', 'DVD', 'different', 'stage', 'show', 'more', 'dancing', 'others', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'performed', 'again', 'tour', 'instrumental/dancing', 'segment', 'first', 'song', 'Inside', 'always', 'been', 'alot', 'fun', 'Alice', 'voice', 'certain', 'songs', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Quiet', 'Room', 'How', 'Gon', 'See', 'Me', 'Now', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'phrasing', 'tone', 'very', 'different', 'studio', 'recordings', 'fun', 'concert', 'Alice', 'onstage', 'banter', 'School', 'Out', 'band', 'intros', 'terrific.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'watchable', 'was', 'expecting', 'better.The', 'only', 'DVD', 'Alice', 'commentary', 'sparse', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'bit', 'band', 'other', 'comments', 'very', 'little', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'developed', 'wife', 'Sheryl', 'lead', 'dancer', 'show', 'helped', 'choreograph', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'commentary.I', ""'m"", 'hard', 'core', 'fan', ""'m"", 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'low-priced', 'are', 'new', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'might', 'want', 'track', 'down', 'one', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'Theatre', 'Death']",The Strange Case of Alice Cooper: Live 1979 - The Madhouse Rock Tour
1531942,A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,B007JZFX42,"Mike Reed ""Mike Reed""","[1, 1]","This was my first [real] concert, as I remember it well, as the Babys opened for Alice. I also recall this was the very first full-length concert video I ever got to see on VHS. The tour itself - was subtitled as the 'Madhouse Rock Tour' - as I don't believe I've ever seen seen Alice so thin. Although this show has it's flaws, I feel it truly deserves a five-star rating because the picture quality has been so well preserved. Through the years, I've had a couple of bootleg cassettes of this particular Alice Cooper tour - but rest assure that 'Strange Case' certainly deems all those bootlegs now completely obsolete. Just wish it hadn't taken so long to have this gig to get a legitimate release. 'Strange Case' was notably the only Alice Cooper trek that featured Elton John guitarist - Davey Johnstone. Loved seeing Uncle Alice bring songs from his (then) current lp 'From The Inside' to life - like the opener ""From The Inside"" (with six-foot tall dancing whiskey bottles), ""Serious"", ""Nurse Rozetta"" (with a sexy nurse), ""The Quiet Room"", the upbeat ""Wish I Were Born In Beverly Hills"", his sappy ballad ""How You Gonna See Me Now"" and the humorous ""Inmates (We're All Crazy)"". Nice to see ""Ballad Of Dwight Frye"" performed as it fit right into this show. Plus, I noticed that the shorter-than usual version of ""School's Out"" did possess a certain 'rawness' to it.

1531943,A1SA5D0QD4GZEI,B007JZFX42,Raven Shaddock,"[2, 2]","This concert is pretty much like the original VHS that came out at that time. Only edit I notice was ""School's Out"" encore was edited down a bit. I believe the VHS it was close to 15 or 18 minutes long. I didn't mind that being shorten at all. Alice was pretty amazing during this show he seemed to be changing lyrics during some of the songs. Reminds me of the old Popeye cartoon when Popeye starts mumbling to himself. Check out ""I'm Eighteen"". As some others noted they wished ""All Strapped Up"" and ""Dead Babies"" which I have on a bootleg audio were not included but I believe Shout Factory just copied the original VHS. It seemed no one really took time to add extras or even try to pursue some added bonuses for the fans. I think if Alice's assistant (the late) Brian Nelson was around he would of gave us some vintage material. Since he was one of Alice's biggest fans and knows what the fans are looking for.As for the commentary I have to agree with some others who say Alice plays off better if someone else was viewing it with him. Alice needs a co-host to banter with like Hunter, Cheryl, or Shep. This concert is good it's just pretty much like the VHS of old and no added attraction.
