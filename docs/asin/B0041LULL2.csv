I have to say that I have been sorely disappointed by the junk Hollywood has been spinning out nowadays--Love and Distrust was definitely like a breath of fresh air.I normally am not in the majority; yet, sadly, the way the reviews are so one-sided on this one makes me wonder about the moral character of most people today, as well as their emotional and intellectual IQs.  I can only hope that most of the reviews are from teenagers who were just expecting 90 minutes of Pattinson and who still have time to mature and appreciate what really matters in life...That being said, I did not see the trailer so all I knew was that it included several decent actors and what the case description said (and of course the image of Rob Pattinson on the cover.  I have since watched the trailer, and since there were no words, only clips from the 5 short films, I cannot say that it was ""misleading"", as others have said. Although it may have been nice to know that this is a collection of short films and not a feature-length film (could have put a note at the end of the preview for example, like ""A collection of short films""), I don't believe that would have changed many reviewers' opinions anyway.I am not a huge Pattinson fan so I was not disappointed as many of the other reviewers were that he was barely in the film, although I was a bit surprised at the blink-and-you'll-miss-him part he did have.  However, with so many other great actors, this did not come as a shock.  I do not base my reviews on the actors involved, but rather the acting itself, what emotions it invokes in me and what messages it succesfully(or not) portrays.James Franco and Amy Adams(who actually each played the main character in their respective shorts) did amazing jobs, as did the other famous ones in their brief roles.This film was succesful in portraying various scenarios that we all might find ourselves in, including financial woes, stereotypes, alcoholism, sexuality and of course love and trust issues.  It kept me interested, as most movies nowadays have a problem doing thru 2 whole hours and it  actually felt like it understood the human condition.  The fact that several great actors were involved was just icing on the cake.PS. If you really want to see a movie that's a good 2-hour waste of your time, try the new Arthur with Russel Brand or No Strings Attached with Ashton Kutcher.",5,Love & Distrust is like a breath of fresh air.,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,2554,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', '1-star', 'reviews', 'when', 'checked', 'Amazon', 'prior', 'watching', 'Love', 'Distrust', 'was', 'even', 'MORE', 'shocked', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'junk', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'spinning', 'out', 'nowadays', 'Love', 'Distrust', 'was', 'definitely', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.I', 'normally', 'am', 'not', 'majority', 'yet', 'sadly', 'way', 'reviews', 'are', 'so', 'one-sided', 'one', 'wonder', 'moral', 'character', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'IQs', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'most', 'reviews', 'are', 'teenagers', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'expecting', '90', 'minutes', 'Pattinson', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'mature', 'appreciate', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'trailer', 'knew', 'was', 'included', 'several', 'decent', 'actors', 'what', 'case', 'description', 'said', 'course', 'image', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'cover', 'have', 'watched', 'trailer', 'were', 'words', 'only', '5', 'short', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'misleading', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'know', 'collection', 'short', 'films', 'not', 'feature-length', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'note', 'end', 'preview', 'example', 'collection', 'short', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'many', 'reviewers', 'opinions', 'anyway.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Pattinson', 'fan', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'was', 'barely', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-him"", 'part', 'did', 'have', 'However', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'shock', 'do', 'not', 'base', 'reviews', 'actors', 'involved', 'rather', 'acting', 'what', 'what', 'succesfully', 'not', 'Franco', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'actually', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'respective', 'shorts', 'did', 'amazing', 'jobs', 'did', 'other', 'famous', 'ones', 'brief', 'roles.This', 'film', 'was', 'succesful', 'portraying', 'various', 'scenarios', 'might', 'find', 'including', 'financial', 'woes', 'stereotypes', 'alcoholism', 'sexuality', 'course', 'love', 'trust', 'issues', 'kept', 'interested', 'most', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'have', 'problem', 'doing', '2', 'whole', 'hours', 'actually', 'felt', 'understood', 'human', 'condition', 'fact', 'several', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'involved', 'was', 'just', 'icing', 'cake.PS', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'good', '2-hour', 'waste', 'time', 'try', 'new', 'Arthur', 'Russel', 'Brand', 'No', 'Strings', 'Attached', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher']",N/A
1381910,A32ZD3CMV82ETI,B0041LULL2,Gia,"[0, 1]","I'd been searching for this obscure RPattz gem, ""Summer House"", in the US for a long time.  I happened across this DVR only due to Amazon suggested items. I was besides myself with excitement that Summer House was among the vignettes and the first in the line up.  This coveted segment is not more than 30 minutes in length with RPattz being in approximately 5 minutes towards the end.  The storyline is not unique - essentially boy cheats on girl, boy follows girl to breathtaking summer mansion to reconcile, but despite his obvious irrestible charms, girl comes to her senses and rejects him.  What makes this story different is that it is shown in comparison and timeframe with the actual first man walking on the moon footage.  I tried to decifer what the common theme was, but perhaps the point is still lost on me; nonetheless, I enjoyed the 1960's time period clothing/hairstyles, the breathtaking English mansion setting, lush greenery, and other fine acting.  As far as the RPattz piece, I'm biased, but I absolutely loved it and have played that little section over and over again.  It's interesting to see RP playing the scoundrel for once, topped off with long wispy greasy hair and all his now classic expressions down to sticking his tongue out included.  Ironically, one of his lines is literally right out of New Moon and I keep picturing Bella there.  Plus, with his recent real life romance turbulence, it puts an uncanny spin on the exchange.  Consequently, Tahlulah gave a noteworthy, convincing performance as the anguished, spurned, but resolved ex-girlfriend; it was also impressive to see her evolve into a strong lead role here coming out from behind the scenes of her secondary role in Pride and Prejudice. I look forward to seeing her in future lead roles.  Shamefully, I invested less time in the other vignettes, which include a range of impressive Hollywood heavy hitters portraying so that's the way life goes scenarios.  The section with versatile James Franco includes a profound, disturbing gory murder.  The section with Sam Worthington and a traveling musician is mildly engaging, but I can't think of Sam in any other role except for Avitar or his playing Avitar again in Clash of the Titans.  The segment with Robert Downey, Jr. is disappointing as it's very choppy with visual images coming at you quickly; hard to see/know what is going on or even that it's the reknowned charismatic RD, Jr. in the scenes.  There's a section with acclaimed Amy Adams as a waitress and all the brutality that goes with that work - well done, but I feel like we've seen her in this beaten down persona before.  Overall, based on the DVD title, I had hoped that it included gushy over the top romantic vignettes like Valentine's Day; although not the case here, the sketches were still thought-proking.  As far as my recommendation of this DVD, if you're an avid RPattz fan, you'll want this to complete your collection. It's well worth it to fangirl me!  Otherwise, this DVD is no Slaves of NY; so unless you're a big fan of the other actors on the roster, wait until it goes on sale to view on a rainy day.

1381911,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0041LULL2,Grady Harp,"[14, 17]","Just as there is a surge in the attention being paid to flash fiction (stories that are limited, in general, to 1000 words) and other evidences that we are running too fast through life to really commit to just about anything (relationships, long novels, thoughtful motion pictures, food that requires more than 40 seconds to 3 minutes in the microwave, instant weight loss, chats on the computer or cell phone rather than sit down conversations, etc), so here is a DVD that presents five stories with  the loose theme of love.  In some ways these vignettes work - quickie ideas that don't merit further exploration than what is offered - and in more ways they seem so poorly made that even the excuse of low budget can't cover the results.This DVD is five stories, briefly described as one form of love and the results, given a name, and then proceeds to a short story attempted to make passable by the use of star names but self-defeating in the fact that they seem shot on home video gear - grainy, poorly focused, meaningless lighting, and embarrassingly bad script writing.  SUMMER HOUSE (shot in Normandy we are informed in the credits stars a house with the incidental, very brief  placement of Robert Pattinson in the deep shadows as the love who got away from Talulah Riley and who  wants back. BLUE POLES is a truck ride in Australia with Sam Worthington on his way to Canberra to see a painting called 'Blue Poles' and offers a ride to Emma Randall whose naivet&eacute; crossroads don't seem to alter the driver's desires. GRASSHOPPER places James Franco on a train with Rachel Miner, a Goth-like sex kitten who retrieves Franco's cell phone and opens a thankfully brief silly near blackmail episode to retrieve the cell phone - with a corny twist at the end. PENNIES places Amy Adams in a diner, taking a job as a waitress to make enough cash to keep her daughter from being 'cut' - the 'cut turns out to be less than dramatic - and discovers the varieties of people's reactions to diner help on several levels. AUTO MOTIVES deals with cars - Michael Imperioli tries in vain to seduce girls into his car parked in Washington Square while Robert Downey Jr appears VERY briefly as a car detailer who wants to get in front of the attention of Director James Cameron.Why make this five-part movie?  Perhaps it is a project of a wealthy philanthropist who needs a diversion, perhaps it is payback for favors in the industry.  The material is lack luster and it is surprising that the star actors took on the project. But then step back and consider the means: this is one way to get flash fiction on the screen for little money and a lot of hope that people will buy into the concept that from little seeds, gardens grow.
