276922,A2AHW89YUJDBFK,6301966236,black*mamba,"[4, 5]","This film needs to legally released on dvd NOW because it is an original, extremely well-written portrait of a man in love, and the forever underrated John Heard gives the best performance I have ever seen in a romantic film. John Heard is so sharp and funny; it is a delight to watch him in every frame of this. I watched this back to back with Cutter's Way (and Cat People the night before), and this man deserved to be a big big star rather than waddling around in tv shows and second rate movies I've glanced at over the years. He is really one of our finest actors. Mary Beth Hurt is also quite good as the object of his obsession.  Look for Peter Riegert (and his hair - whoa!) and a young Griffin Dunne who also co-produced this when he was only in his twenties. I bought an old used VHS of this and the picture is worn and wobbly; I know new releases are always top priority, but more of these 70s and 80s small movies need some attention, too. Many people are begging for the dvd release here, on IMDB, many places, and I want to add my voice - PUT CHILLY SCENES OF WINTER ON DVD NOW, PLEASE!",5,"ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S THE DVD?

276923,A1VNPP2IRDLCUQ,6301966236,daedrya,"[1, 1]","I first saw this movie last night, it was fascinating. Young John Heard was handsome and it was fun to recognise Peter Riegart (crazy hair) Griffin Dunne, and the always great Gloria Graham. It was hard, however, to fathom what Heard saw in his Laura, altho maybe that was the point.She herself thinks he's idealising her way out of proportion and it's driving her mad.In today's world it's funny, instead of a romantic, John would be consider a creepy stalker. He made me want to scream, ""get over it and get on with your life!""...I would love a dvd of this, hope they do release it, especially with a commentary.

The  one-liners might be even superior to a Woody Allen  movie (they at least tie each other). I, myself, am very interested in  seeing the original &quot;Head Over Heels' like many of the critcs below  me. I'm with you, everyone and I love &quot;Chilly Scenes...&quot; just as  much as you. If some MGM big-shot ever reads my review (which is  slim-to-none) please take my advice- there are many people out there  wanting to see the original cut of Joan Micklin Silver's masterpiece  &quot;Chilly Scenes of Winter&quot; (apparently entitled &quot;Head Over  Heels&quot;),so if you can pull some strings for us, please release it on  video. It at least deserves a place in MGM/UA's Home Video collection of  &quot;Contemporary Classics&quot;. This is one of my personal favorite  movies and I've seen plenty. John Heard and Mary Beth Hurts' performances  are magnificent and the characters really are colorful enough to the extent  that they come alive. For anybody who hasn't seen it, purchase it on Ebay  used or get it new on Amazon. Either way you have to see it. It's a real  treat!",5,A highly rewarding romancer with a great ending and music,936662400,"09 7, 1999",1999,1678,"['quot', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'quot', 'blind', 'man', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Laura', 'quot', 'young', 'executive.These', 'are', 'first', 'lines', 'film', 'quot', 'Chilly', 'Scenes', 'Winter', 'quot', 'line', 'had', 'saying', 'things', 'myself', ""'Good"", 'beginning', 'thinking', 'guy', 'was', 'depressed', 'just', 'being', 'sarcastic.', 'quot', ""C'mon"", 'what', 'do', 'have', 'quot', 'blind', 'man', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Ruth', 'quot', 'young', 'executive', 'quot', '50', 'cents', 'quot', 'executive', 'off.I', 'know', 'quot', 'Chilly', 'Scenes', 'Winter', 'quot', 'lines/dialogue', 'back', 'hand', 'one-liners', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'superior', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'least', 'tie', 'other', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'original', 'quot', 'Head', 'Heels', 'many', 'critcs', ""'m"", 'everyone', 'love', 'quot', 'Chilly', 'Scenes', 'quot', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'MGM', 'big-shot', 'ever', 'review', 'slim-to-none', 'please', 'take', 'advice-', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'there', 'wanting', 'see', 'original', 'cut', 'Joan', 'Micklin', 'Silver', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Chilly', 'Scenes', 'Winter', 'quot', 'apparently', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Head', 'Over', 'Heels', 'quot', 'so', 'can', 'pull', 'strings', 'please', 'release', 'video', 'least', 'deserves', 'place', 'MGM/UA', 'Home', 'Video', 'collection', 'quot', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'quot', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'John', 'Heard', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurts', 'performances', 'are', 'magnificent', 'characters', 'really', 'are', 'colorful', 'enough', 'extent', 'come', 'alive', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Ebay', 'used', 'get', 'new', 'Amazon', 'way', 'have', 'see', 'real', 'treat']",Chilly Scenes of Winter VHS

John Heard plays a somewhat lost, slightly wounded romantic, and Mary Beth Hurt is the perfect companion he meets while she's separated from the husband she never should have married.  They are brought to life from Ann Beattie's novel with such commitment, it's a joy.  The secondary characters, every single one, are all such a treat as well.  The late Ken McMillan and Gloria Grahame, Peter Riegert when he was just starting out, they're all wonderful.
