Maybe Gene Roddenberry was a soldier in his heart more than a man who was interested in science fiction. The idea of the warp drive in Star Trek is quite valid and intelligent, provided someone discovers subspace by the year 2022...This branch of the Star Trek family is very similar in many respects to all the other ones, aliens here and there and everywhere, and into the fray and aim the photon torpedo at their engines. So much like naval battles fought in space. There is an elaborate reverse history of the Star Trek genre on the web on various meticulously created websites by various Trek fans.

929544,A3AFFR1OI77BQQ,B000AOEMXC,,"[2, 6]","I have previously written reviews of the first and third seasons of Enterprise, and in bot I managed to miss saying things that I wanted to say. I have just finished watching the fourth season and it has allowed me to distill and focus those thoughts quite a bit.To begin with, many of the opinions I have heard expressed indicate that, a lot of Trek fans felt the fourth season of Enterprise was what the entire series should have been. I take umbrage with that point of view. The idea that a series has to pay homage to one or more of it's predecessors, or has to fit it's stories within the narrow margins of what is already known by it's audience, is preposterous.What we are actually looking at is the difference between a history book and the actual historical events. A history book provides a concise but extremely objective view of historical events, most often removing the emotions and motivations of important individuals, to relay what are considered to be the facts. The events themselves are much more than a paragraph or even a chapter in a history book.Now, what does this have to do with Enterprise? Simple. What we were watching in the first three seasons was history as it happened, if you watched closely and paid attention there were a multitude of historical threads subtley woven into the show. The fruition of these threads would have been outstanding in the long run, however the Enterprise staff new during the third season that they didn't have a long run in which complete the developement. So they had to truncate and condense those threads in the fourth season.Why it was done this way is clear, they had to tie up the loose ends, but in doing it this way we missed out on the longer more entertaining versions. It is a pity that they had to finish it in this way and I find it shocking that in retrospect this is apparently what the majority of Trek fans were looking for. Tidy little packages full of answers but devoid of the detail that generates historical significance. In other words, it appears that the paragraph from the history book is more desirable than the actual coarse of events that it describes.Have you ever wondered how the Federation was created? Why Klingons disliked humans so much and for so long? How Vulcans became such an integral part of the Federation, and why they defer to humans to such a great degree? Why Romulans despise humans and the Federation? Those answers and more are here if you look for them.The fourth season, although it does seem rushed, is not disappointing. I found the Mirror Universe episodes to be the weakest of the entire series. They were very good but, the best part of any mirror universe story is seeing our heroes interact with that universe, unfortunatley this didn't happen in these episodes.Finally, the last episode. I have heard differing view points on this one. This is my opinion. It was an excellent episode. Seeing Riker and Troy explore the NX01 was great. Watching Riker glean insight from the crew that essentially ""wrote the book"" was fantastic. The worst part was realizing what we missed, the episode was set in the future, the Enterprise had been deployed for ten years and was getting ready to be mothballed. There are six years of great adventures that we will never get to see because we allowed this show to be cancelled.This is by far the best Star Trek series of the group, and this is a great season, but you don't want to watch it by itself, watch the others first, so you'll understand some of the backstory and motivations that are integral to these episodes.

929549,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000AOEMXC,,"[4, 6]","I happen to consider the ""Enterprise"" series of the ""Star Trek"" franchise to be far and away the best of them all (and I love them all.)  This has got to be the first time ever that a series was cancelled just as it was beginning to reach its full flowering, for Season Four is the best season of this series, surpassing even the excellent Season Three.  In my opinion the entire cast reached a depth and complexity akin to a fine California Cabernet wine ... mellow, pleasant, and deep.  All of the main characters really came to mean something to me, and some of the Season Four storylines were among the best science fiction you can find anywhere.  Even the wonderful Original Series was in decline when it was cancelled--it is notorious that the third season of The Original Series was shot though with stinker episodes (see the episode ""Turnabout Intruder"" if you want to see some really awful stuff).""Enterprise"" features (must I use the past tense--no!) a hopeful vision of humanity's future in which Earth achieves unity (mostly--see the fine ""Terra Prime"" episode)and meets the other nearby interstellar civilizations as equals.  The ""Enterprise"" vision of a united humanity reaching political maturity in which totalitarianism, war, and want have been eliminated is a wonderful prognositication of the future and this shining vision permeates the entire series, particularly the end of Season Three and all of Season Four.One of the wonderful things about ""Enterprise"" is that it often shows how humanity is (i.e. might be) perceived through the eyes of aliens.  I really enjoyed the ""Forge"" episodes dealing with the planet Vulcan, and the episodes that dealt with the Andorians were also excellent.Season Four had some fabulous episodes.  ""Through a Glass, Darkly"" is fine science fiction dealing with an alternate universe (the same one as ""Mirror Mirror"" in The Original Series.)  ""Terra Prime"" shows that mankind in the Enterprise universe still has some growing up to do, but nevertheless Earth is shown as indeed well along in the process of maturing.  The ""Augment"" episodes (the precursor to the Khan episodes in The Original Series) are also great entertainment.  I even enjoyed the sometimes-panned final episode, although I might have handled it differently.  The last episode did a fine job of wrapping up the series.  If you want to know how much the ""Enterprise"" series meant to me, I will state that I was emotionally upset when I watched the final episode and realized that I would never see Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip, Mayweather, Hoshi, Malcome, and the incomparable Dr. Phlox ever again, except in re-runs.  This was a great series.I suppose it is too much to hope that we will ever see a feature length Star Trek movie featuring the Enterprise cast and theme.  Here is a good idea: the Earth-Romulan War!

It was strange seeing them portrayed as such poor characters.The Augment episodes touched on the old original series episode about Kahn and his superhumans, later revisited in ""Affliction"" when it turns out the Klingons got a hold of some Augment DNA and tried it out on their own people with disastrous results (which explains why in the original series Klingons looked human and why Worf wouldn't discuss it in DS9 ""Trials and Tribbleations""), Archer and Phlox saved the day.The Romulans are even seen, by us- not Enterprise, in a few episodes as were two species of Andorians.""In a Mirror, Darkly"" parts 1 &2 was a very interesting side trip, kind of surprising (read the Okuda's text commentary in part II), the only real stinker of the season was the finale ""These are the Voyages"", in which the producers turned what could have been a good episode into the Troi & Ryker show, that was disgusting.",4,"Very good final season, terrible series finale",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1687,"['think', 'final', 'season', 'Enterprise', 'barely', 'even', 'got', 'produced', 'Shot', 'video', 'instead', 'film', 'cut', 'costs', 'then', 'season', 'was', 'cut', 'two', 'episodes', 'yet', 'still', 'think', 'most', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'television.The', 'first', 'bad', 'sign', 'see', 'first', 'thing', 'Disc', '1', 'sales', 'promos', 'Trek', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Six', 'discs', 'instead', '7', 'reduction', 'number', 'extras', 'inside', 'Mirror', 'feature', 'was', 'nice', 'best', 'features.I', 'did', 'almost', 'episodes', 'even', 'Stormfront', 'II', 'Tempporal', 'Wars', 'Suliban', 'got', 'dumped', 'immediately', 'Vulcan', 'episodes', 'four', 'years', 'finally', 'got', 'finishing', 'up', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'speculation', 'Vulcan', 'history', 'naturally', 'Archer', 'saved', 'Vulcan', 'ensured', 'future', 'have', 'always', 'known', 'was', 'strange', 'seeing', 'portrayed', 'such', 'poor', 'characters.The', 'Augment', 'episodes', 'touched', 'old', 'original', 'series', 'episode', 'Kahn', 'superhumans', 'later', 'revisited', 'Affliction', 'when', 'out', 'Klingons', 'got', 'hold', 'Augment', 'DNA', 'tried', 'out', 'own', 'people', 'disastrous', 'results', 'why', 'original', 'series', 'Klingons', 'looked', 'human', 'why', 'Worf', 'would', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'DS9', 'Trials', 'Tribbleations', 'Archer', 'Phlox', 'saved', 'day.The', 'Romulans', 'are', 'even', 'seen', 'us-', 'not', 'Enterprise', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'two', 'species', 'Andorians', 'Mirror', 'Darkly', 'parts', '1', '2', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'side', 'trip', 'kind', 'surprising', 'read', 'Okuda', 'text', 'commentary', 'part', 'II', 'only', 'real', 'stinker', 'season', 'was', 'finale', 'are', 'Voyages', 'producers', 'turned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'episode', 'Troi', 'Ryker', 'show', 'was', 'disgusting']",N/A

What does that say?Enterprise was always a missed opportunity in my opinion. First of all, why do a prequel series in the first place and then rewrite things as you go? Why create characters and then not flesh them out? Enterprise was good at this and yes, the writing did improve in season 4 but the ""improvement"" was on such a superficial level that it didn't impressed viewers who demand sensible storytelling and they (we) continued abandoning ship.I came back after giving up on the show during the middle of Season 1 because it was more ofthe same that Voyager was dishing out, bland rehashings of old plots with emphasis on sex rather than Sci Fi.That fans still defend the show and actually think it is good still puzzles me. This season is good for no other reason that they finally try to connect the dots between this show and the original series, something they should have started doing the very first season.My other puzzlement is that Paramount charges so much for all these Star Trek box sets. Why, when most shows that come out are anywhere from $20.00 to $60.00, is this season or any episodes of Enterprise or Voyager close to a hundred dollars?As for the finale, it was a kick in the ass to fans of this show and Trek in general with the utterly horrible story and dialogue. The last episode was described by it's talentless creators Berman and Braga as being a Valentine to the fans.

I really did.  I had been a fan of ""Star Trek"" ever since the mid '70s when I was a kid and started watching the original series in syndication.  ""The Next Generation"" (at least for the middle of its seven year run) was good, and ""Deep Space 9"" was good toward the end (even if it took ripping off an ongoing interstellar war concept from ""Babylon 5"" to get it there).  But the franchise really started to go south with ""Voyager"", and there were two big reasons for this: Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.""Voyager"" had real problems, and most of them could be traced back to Berman and Braga, who were who were finally responsible for the writing and the whole direction of the show.  When I first heard they were going to helm a new series, and set it in the pre-Kirk era, I was worried.  Those worries grew worse when I read that neither of them cared for the original series.  Not only were they likely to make some of the same mistakes they made with ""Voyager"", but on top of that, they had no affection for the original show, and were likely to crap all over its continuity.  Sure enough, they did exactly that.  Consequently, it came as no surprise that the series' ratings sank lower and lower each season.Then, perhaps at the insistence of someone inside Paramount Studios, perhaps not, Berman and Braga stepped aside and turned creative control of the series over to Manny Coto, and what a world of difference it made.  Not only was Coto a far better writer (as were the assistant writers he hired), but he _did_ like and respect the original series.  Not only was the quality of the stories improved dramatically, effort was being made to link the show in with the original series' continuity, instead of disregarding it.  The improvement in continuity made the show a lot more enjoyable to long-time ""Star Trek"" fans, and the improvement in the quality of the episodes made the show a lot more enjoyable all around.It really is a pity the show couldn't have begun with Coto in creative control from the outset.  It might still be on the air.  It would almost certainly have been able to run out seven seasons the way all the three other sequel series did.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[4, 4]","Many many Star Trek fans such as myself,after seeing this will wonder why just when Enterprise was starting to hit it's stride that it's creators abandoned the field while it was ahead. That didn't stop the series from being triumphant for all concerned for the most part. After resolving the Xindi dileama in the beginning of the season Captain Archer and his crew find themselves on a newly xenophobic Earth (seeing Phlox's face puff out Raptor-style in a bar fight is a classic moment of this series) and the mission continues. But the writers have chosen to do something a little different this season.Rather then focus on a lot of individual episodes this season mainly focuses on four loose story arcs. The first revolves around the character of Arik Soong (Brent Spiner-obviously bought in to help bolster ratings) who is trying to reawaken a series of genetically enhanced embryos with surprizing results for him. The other involves a younger T'Pau (YES the same character as featured in Amok Time) involving herself with a group of renagade Vulcans who embrace the less repressed ""true teachings of Surak"" and mind melds;that arc is also marked by T'Pol marrying and finding her and Trip are mentally connected. There's also a mirror universe story arc,involing the resolution to two TOSS episodes including 'Mirror Mirror' and 'The Tholian Web'-we actually get to see a full bodies Tholian. That isn't the only TOS references here-in 'Affliction' and 'Divergence' we discover about how the Klingons of Kirk's era had no head ridges. There are some personal favorite episodes this season.Such as ""Daedelus"" where we meet the inventer of the transporter played by Bill Cobb and learn of his secrets. In ""Observer Effect"" the crew are inhabited by Organians (another TOS reference) with the exception of Phlox who has to foil their plot. Of course another TOS reference is the appearance of the manipulative green Orion slave girls in ""Bound"". My favorite story here is ""Terra Prime"",a politically based story of a sort Enterprise tended to have danced around-in this case revolving around a group of humans who no longer want aliens on Earth,as well as the first Vulcan/Human hybrid child who sadly dies. What bothers me as much as everyone else is the finale-it has many problems. For one thing,the choice to transform the story into one that takes place five years after ""Terra Prime"" BUT ALSO it takes place mostly in a holodeck fantasy on the Enterprise D during TNG's episode 'Pegesus' (with a very aged looking Frakes and Sirtis reprising their classic roles). But most insulting to Star Trek and Enterprise is that for the first time since TOS left the airwaves in 1969 this was the first Star Trek series finale to be a standard episode lengh show rather then a 90 minute episode as the finales of TNG,DS9 and Voyager had been.And for that and only that reason I deduct one star for this otherwise enjoyable season,one that will actually make you regret this series didn't last just a few years longer then it did.",4,Why Did It Have To End At This Point?,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,3030,"['Many', 'many', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'such', 'seeing', 'will', 'wonder', 'why', 'just', 'when', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'starting', 'hit', 'stride', 'creators', 'abandoned', 'field', 'was', 'ahead', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'series', 'being', 'triumphant', 'concerned', 'most', 'part', 'resolving', 'Xindi', 'dileama', 'beginning', 'season', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'crew', 'find', 'newly', 'xenophobic', 'Earth', 'seeing', 'Phlox', 'face', 'puff', 'Raptor-style', 'bar', 'fight', 'classic', 'moment', 'series', 'mission', 'writers', 'have', 'chosen', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'season.Rather', 'then', 'focus', 'lot', 'individual', 'episodes', 'season', 'mainly', 'four', 'loose', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'character', 'Arik', 'Soong', 'Brent', 'Spiner-obviously', 'bought', 'help', 'bolster', 'ratings', 'who', 'trying', 'reawaken', 'series', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'embryos', 'surprizing', 'results', 'other', 'younger', ""T'Pau"", 'YES', 'same', 'character', 'featured', 'Amok', 'Time', 'involving', 'group', 'renagade', 'Vulcans', 'who', 'embrace', 'less', 'repressed', 'true', 'teachings', 'Surak', 'mind', 'melds', 'arc', 'also', 'marked', ""T'Pol"", 'marrying', 'finding', 'Trip', 'are', 'mentally', 'connected', 'also', 'mirror', 'universe', 'story', 'arc', 'involing', 'resolution', 'two', 'TOSS', 'episodes', 'including', ""'Mirror"", 'Mirror', ""'The"", 'Tholian', ""Web'-we"", 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'full', 'bodies', 'Tholian', ""n't"", 'only', 'TOS', 'here-in', ""'Affliction"", ""'Divergence"", 'discover', 'how', 'Klingons', 'Kirk', 'era', 'had', 'head', 'are', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season.Such', 'Daedelus', 'where', 'meet', 'inventer', 'transporter', 'played', 'Bill', 'Cobb', 'learn', 'secrets', 'Observer', 'Effect', 'crew', 'are', 'inhabited', 'Organians', 'TOS', 'reference', 'exception', 'Phlox', 'who', 'foil', 'plot', 'course', 'TOS', 'reference', 'appearance', 'manipulative', 'green', 'Orion', 'slave', 'girls', 'Bound', 'favorite', 'story', 'here', 'Terra', 'Prime', 'politically', 'based', 'story', 'sort', 'Enterprise', 'tended', 'have', 'danced', 'around-in', 'case', 'revolving', 'group', 'humans', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'want', 'aliens', 'Earth', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'Vulcan/Human', 'hybrid', 'child', 'who', 'sadly', 'What', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'finale-it', 'many', 'problems', 'one', 'thing', 'choice', 'transform', 'story', 'one', 'place', 'five', 'years', 'Terra', 'Prime', 'BUT', 'ALSO', 'place', 'mostly', 'holodeck', 'fantasy', 'Enterprise', 'D', 'TNG', 'episode', ""'Pegesus"", 'very', 'aged', 'looking', 'Frakes', 'Sirtis', 'reprising', 'classic', 'roles', 'most', 'insulting', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'first', 'time', 'TOS', 'left', 'airwaves', '1969', 'was', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'finale', 'be', 'standard', 'episode', 'lengh', 'show', 'rather', 'then', '90', 'minute', 'episode', 'finales', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'Voyager', 'had', 'been.And', 'only', 'reason', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'otherwise', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'actually', 'make', 'regret', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'longer', 'then', 'did']",N/A

929557,A24IW2UD0OAZ1L,B000AOEMXC,"camcas5 ""camcas5""","[2, 2]","This is the season of the ""Star Trek"" franchise series that fans have been waiting for.  In terms of rich character development, gripping drama (with actual surprises and true tension in the narrative twists), and provocative, funny, and moving writing and direction, Season 4 consistently reaches the heights of the best in the entire Star Trek franchise (only paralleled in the best seasons of The Next Generation, while the original series remains iconic and quite enjoyable).  The viewer is truly brought to care about the characters and events depicted in these shows.  For fans who may have drifted off while ST:E got derailed by current events during 2 & 3 and most of the fun and originality was sucked from the series, definitely check out this season, because the writers, headed by Manny Coto, truly delivered the attention to detail and understanding of characters that was a hallmark of the best of this series.  In addition, the producers and directors showed far better timing and originality in the feel to the show, which demonstrated a spark that had only been hinted at until then.  The drive and high quality of the storytelling and the full portrayal and resolution of the universe created through the Trek series leads to a palpable energy throughout the shows.  Finally, literally every major cast member was given tremendous material to play off of, and they delivered.  In particular, Connor Trinneer as ""Trip Tucker"" and Linda Park as ""Hoshi Sato"" really developed tremendously satisfying portrayals of their characters, although the same could be said of Captain Archer, T'Pol, Phlox, and the entire central core of characters.On the other hand, the awful reputation of the finale is well-deserved: it is so poor that one has to wonder what was at the source of the whole affair.  Manny Coto and the entire team delivered such a wonderfully brilliant season, and then Braga and Berman return to deliver a poisoned Valentine that is a nearly complete opposite of the entire season.  It is not particularly the framing device of Riker and Troi that is the problem here (and for series finales, creators often choose an abrupt shift in format or structure, as was the case with ST:TNG and many other shows), but the awful narrative which makes little sense in terms of the characters and even has a number of utterly incongruous scenes (such as crew members smiling and looking quite satisfied seemingly moments after their colleague and close friend has died!).  Not only that, but Braga and Berman demonstrate yet again the most sophomoric and uncreative attempts at injecting drama -- just kill off a character for no reason except to do something that's, well.. dramatic.  As a result of the poor writing, the whole affair seems slapped together and as if everyone were distracted and rudderless.  (By the way, as much as the presence of Riker and Trio get the blame for this, Frakes delivers a fine performance for a thankless task.)  For a franchise that often notes the importance of its fans, its a truly deranged sendoff.This is particularly true after the two-part story that precedes it, which, if it had been the final show, would have been a stunningly moving ending to the series.  In fact, it would also have been a truly original and satisfying choice to end on a small, private moment between two of the characters -- and characters who represent core images of the Star Trek story, a human and a Vulcan -- in a moment of shared experience and hope for the future.  (The story of the preceding loss of a child would also have been quite apt in relation to the regretted cancellation of the series.)

929558,AU852OCTFL67U,B000AOEMXC,"Cam T. ""&#34;Reclusive Writer&#34;""","[6, 6]","The 4th season used an interesting format this time around, with several miniature story arcs, and a couple of stand alone episodes. Picking up where the 3rd season left off, the Enterprise crew is trapped in a terrifying alternate timeline, where the Nazis have proven victrious in WWII, thanks to aid from aliens from the 31st century, or somewhen around then. Aiding Archer in reversing in the damage in his final appearance is Silik, whom I would've liked to see more of, as John Fleck made a great recurring villain. He can be seen in other Star Trek episodes in a variety of roles, usually as a bad guy.The season was also noted by an appearance by Brent Spiner (TNG's Data) as an ancestor of Data's creator, who believed that genetic engineering was the future of human evolution, and had unleashed a group of Augments on the galaxy, ie: The Wrath of Khan, bringing a nice bit of continuity in with the other series. Also seen in this season were more brushes with Andorian Shran (played by Jeffrey Combs, DS9's Weyoun), a complete transformation of Vulcan society when Surak's true teachings were finally uncovered by Archer, T'Pol, and T'Pau (previously seen much older on TOS's ""Amok Time"").Second contact with the Romulans, and yes, they held to the Original Series adage that Romulans and humans never saw each other until ""Balance of Terror"", as well as introduction of a rarely seen subspecies of Andorian, the Aenar.The difference between Original Series Klingons and the other series is finally explained when a Klingon Doctor kidnaps Dr. Phlox to find a cure for a disease that is disfiguring and eventually killing the Empire. The surprise is that the Klingons were attempting to make their own Augments, with enhanced human DNA, which backfired horribly.The inventor of the transporter is also introduced in a single episode, as are Orion slave girls, tee-hee!Things come to a head when an isolationist movement on Earth threatens the creation of an interplanetary alliance between several species, a precursor to the founding of the Federation. Of course, things work out, but at a high price.Then in the series (and hopefully not franchise) finale, aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, NCC-1701-D, Commander Riker, troubled by the plans of Admiral Pressman (Riker's storyline in this episode is an outgrowth of the TNG 7th season episode ""The Pegasus""), consults a holodeck program depicting the final mission of the Enterprise NX-01, in 2161 as it's on its way home to attend the founding of the United Federation of Planets.  Sadly, one of the crew doesn't make it to the signing, but for anyone who hasn't seen it, I'm not saying who. Hopefully, none of the other reviewers here will divulge it.  The closing montage literally brought tears to my eyes, but you can form your own opinions.Sadly, the fourth season was the final for ""Enterprise"", though in my opinion, they had a lot of good stories left to tell, except that everyone was nitpicking and throwing fits over the slightest changes to unofficial backstories that they've been told about but never seen before. Sadly, it seems that people have lost the ability to sit back, relax, and enjoy a story without becoming superhypercritical over every single detail.Reality shows were the final nail in the Star Trek coffin, as more and more people are falling into the trap of these cheezy setups that are in no way 'realistic'. They're GARBAGE, people!  Boycott those awful things, buy DVD's, and STOP WASTING YOUR LIFE with REALITY SHOWS!!!!!  Okay, I've said my piece.Star Trek may be gone for awhile, but Trekkers still have the fan-made series, ""New Voyages"", ""Starship Exeter"", ""Star Trek; Hidden Frontier"", and several more in production, to tide them over until a new series comes!

929559,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000AOEMXC,Craig MACKINNON,"[5, 6]","I doubt that anyone shares this particular view, but I enjoyed the Enterprise franchise better than any of the Trek series since the Original.  Yes, Next Generation was generally good after its initial growing pains, and DS9 and Voyager had some good moments, but overall, I enjoyed Enterprise more.  The fourth season is the best of this shortened series, finally fulfilling the promise of filling in the back-stories we've heard so much about in the other series.In both the 3rd and 4th seasons, multi-part episodes were the order of the day.  Watching these episodes on DVD is much less irritating than on network TV, since you don't have to wait an entire week between installments!  There is also the advantage of being able to develop characters, increase the budget, etc.  In the 4th season, there are a number of multi-parters of note:1. The resolution of the Temporal War, where Archer and crew must correct the timeline after Hitler successfully invades the United States, using technology supplied by Earth's enemies.2. The Augments arc.  Guest-starring Brent Spiner as Data's (great?) grandfather, this is the best and most important of the story arcs of the season.  Dr. Soong steals genetically-modified embryoes (think: Khan, from Space Seed and Wrath of Khan) and raises them as ""his"" children.  They then wreak havoc on the galaxy as they steal ships and generally try to set themselves up as leaders.  The arc continues later in the season when Klingons try to replicate the results for their own species, with disasterous results.3.  The Forge: In probably the most important arc in terms of character development, Archer and T'Pol seek out a group of rebels in a desolate and dangerous area of Vulcan called the Forge.  Here we learn more about Vulcans than at any time since McCoy inherited a katra in ST III.4.  In a Mirror, Darkly: Set entirely in the ""Mirror, mirror"" universe, including a unique title sequence, we see the evil counterparts of our favourite characters.  It also improbably serves as a big bridge with the Original series, pulling together elements from the classic Trek episodes ""Arena"", ""Tholian Web"", and ""mirror, Mirror.""  Very enjoyable in an action-arcade kind of way, although one has to wonder how an empire could remain stable with this many assassinations: 4 flag-level officers are killed out-of-hand in these 2 episodes alone!5.  In the weakest shows of the season, a separist group called Terra Prime tries to get all alien species off of Earth.The final show of the series links it to the Next Generation series by having it take place as a simulation on the Enterprise-D's holodeck (with Riker and Troi taking part as members of Archer's crew).For the most part, the shows are enjoyable, even when they fall into the standard Trek trap of having the 1st half of the 2-parters being much better than the second half's resolutions (but this has been happening since ""The Best of Both Worlds"", the first season-ending cliffhanger in Next Gen, so there's nothing particularly alarming about it).  The best part about Enterprise in general, and this 4th season in particular, is that it uses the accumulated lore of Trek to find story ideas.  Thus, we have Tellarites and Andorians at war, followers of Col. Green (who led the bad side in World War III), and even Klingons lacking their cranial ridges (for details, pick up this DVD!)Overall, a very enjoyable season and series, especially for those that have followed the Star Trek shows over the years.  A detailed knowledge of the Trek universe is certainly not a requirement, but will add to the enjoyment in viewing these episodes.  The extras on the DVD set are not that interesting - the audio and text commentaries are localised in the inferior final few episodes, for example.  Nonetheless, the shows themselves are worth the cost of the DVD.",4,The best Trek since the Original Series comes to a premature end,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,3852,"['doubt', 'anyone', 'shares', 'particular', 'view', 'enjoyed', 'Enterprise', 'franchise', 'better', 'Trek', 'series', 'Original', 'Yes', 'Next', 'Generation', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'initial', 'growing', 'pains', 'DS9', 'Voyager', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'Enterprise', 'more', 'fourth', 'season', 'best', 'shortened', 'series', 'finally', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'filling', 'back-stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'series.In', '3rd', '4th', 'seasons', 'multi-part', 'episodes', 'were', 'order', 'day', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'much', 'less', 'irritating', 'network', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'entire', 'week', 'installments', 'also', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'develop', 'characters', 'increase', 'budget', 'etc', '4th', 'season', 'are', 'number', 'multi-parters', 'note:1', 'resolution', 'Temporal', 'War', 'where', 'Archer', 'crew', 'must', 'correct', 'timeline', 'Hitler', 'successfully', 'United', 'States', 'using', 'technology', 'supplied', 'Earth', 'enemies.2', 'Augments', 'arc', 'Guest-starring', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Data', 'great', 'grandfather', 'best', 'most', 'important', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Soong', 'steals', 'genetically-modified', 'embryoes', 'think', 'Khan', 'Space', 'Seed', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'children', 'then', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'galaxy', 'steal', 'ships', 'generally', 'try', 'set', 'up', 'leaders', 'arc', 'later', 'season', 'when', 'Klingons', 'try', 'replicate', 'results', 'own', 'species', 'disasterous', 'results.3', 'Forge', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'arc', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'Archer', ""T'Pol"", 'seek', 'out', 'group', 'rebels', 'desolate', 'dangerous', 'area', 'Vulcan', 'called', 'Forge', 'Here', 'learn', 'more', 'Vulcans', 'time', 'McCoy', 'inherited', 'katra', 'ST', 'III.4', 'Mirror', 'Darkly', 'Set', 'entirely', 'Mirror', 'mirror', 'universe', 'including', 'unique', 'title', 'sequence', 'see', 'evil', 'counterparts', 'favourite', 'characters', 'also', 'improbably', 'big', 'bridge', 'Original', 'series', 'pulling', 'together', 'elements', 'classic', 'Trek', 'Arena', 'Tholian', 'Web', 'mirror', 'Mirror', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'action-arcade', 'kind', 'way', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'empire', 'could', 'remain', 'stable', 'many', 'assassinations', '4', 'flag-level', 'officers', 'are', 'killed', 'out-of-hand', '2', 'episodes', 'alone', '5', 'weakest', 'shows', 'season', 'separist', 'group', 'called', 'Terra', 'Prime', 'get', 'alien', 'species', 'Earth.The', 'final', 'show', 'series', 'Next', 'Generation', 'series', 'having', 'take', 'place', 'simulation', 'Enterprise-D', 'holodeck', 'Riker', 'Troi', 'taking', 'part', 'members', 'Archer', 'crew', 'most', 'part', 'shows', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'when', 'fall', 'standard', 'Trek', 'trap', 'having', '1st', 'half', '2-parters', 'being', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'resolutions', 'been', 'happening', 'Best', 'Worlds', 'first', 'season-ending', 'cliffhanger', 'Next', 'Gen', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'alarming', 'best', 'part', 'Enterprise', 'general', '4th', 'season', 'particular', 'accumulated', 'lore', 'Trek', 'find', 'story', 'ideas', 'Thus', 'have', 'Tellarites', 'Andorians', 'war', 'followers', 'Col.', 'Green', 'who', 'led', 'bad', 'side', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'even', 'Klingons', 'lacking', 'cranial', 'ridges', 'details', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'Overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'series', 'especially', 'have', 'followed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'years', 'detailed', 'knowledge', 'Trek', 'universe', 'certainly', 'not', 'requirement', 'will', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'extras', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'audio', 'text', 'commentaries', 'are', 'localised', 'inferior', 'final', 'few', 'episodes', 'example', 'Nonetheless', 'shows', 'are', 'worth', 'cost', 'DVD']",N/A

Dent,"[127, 135]","The fourth season of Star Trek Enterprise was the season that most Trekkers have been waiting for, with homages to the original series(Mirror Universe,The Eugenics Wars,Orion slave women,T'Pau), as well as rectifying continuety errors(The Vulcans,The Klingon ""forehead"" issue).Unfortunately,the show was cancelled prematurely as the show was becoming what Trekkers been waiting for since ""Broken Bow"".One of the biggest contributing factors for the success of the fourth season was supervising producer Manny Coto,an original series fanatic who brought Enterprise back on the right tracks as far back as season three.Sensing that the show wasn't going to see a fifth season,Executive producer Rick Berman handed the reins to Coto, who set about in correcting the many elements in Trek history that have been disregarded,which drove away even the most dedicated fan.The season's format was tweaked to make room for multi episode arcs which dealt separately with The Eugenics Wars(The Augment trilogy featuring Brent Spiner as Arik Soong),A Vulcan Civil War(featuring Surak, and T'Pau),A Klingon Virus (resulting in the humanoid Klingon foreheads from the original series), and the mirror universe featuring the USS Defiant from The Tholian Web.One of the biggest disappointments of the season itself was the final episode ""..These Are The Voyages"" which takes place on the Enterprise-D, featuring Riker and Troi.Instead of giving the NX-01 crew a dignified send off,they were used supporting characters in a glorified ""Next Generation"" episode.The finale (written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga) was called a ""Valentine to the fans"".But the real valentine was the entire fourth season which finally gave the fans what they wanted,and the most problematic Star Trek series a dignified ending, dispite it's weak finale.",5,Star Trek Enterprise Fourth Seasons - These Were The Voyages....,1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,1818,"['fourth', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'season', 'most', 'Trekkers', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'homages', 'original', 'series', 'Mirror', 'Universe', 'Eugenics', 'Wars', 'Orion', 'slave', 'women', ""T'Pau"", 'as', 'well', 'rectifying', 'continuety', 'errors', 'Vulcans', 'Klingon', 'forehead', 'issue', '.Unfortunately', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'show', 'was', 'becoming', 'what', 'Trekkers', 'been', 'waiting', 'Broken', 'Bow', '.One', 'biggest', 'contributing', 'factors', 'success', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'supervising', 'producer', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'original', 'series', 'fanatic', 'who', 'brought', 'Enterprise', 'back', 'right', 'tracks', 'far', 'back', 'season', 'three.Sensing', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'fifth', 'season', 'Executive', 'producer', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'handed', 'reins', 'Coto', 'who', 'set', 'about', 'correcting', 'many', 'elements', 'Trek', 'history', 'have', 'been', 'disregarded', 'drove', 'away', 'even', 'most', 'dedicated', 'fan.The', 'season', 'format', 'was', 'tweaked', 'make', 'room', 'multi', 'episode', 'arcs', 'separately', 'Eugenics', 'Wars', 'Augment', 'trilogy', 'featuring', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Arik', 'Soong', 'Vulcan', 'Civil', 'War', 'featuring', 'Surak', ""T'Pau"", 'A', 'Klingon', 'Virus', 'resulting', 'humanoid', 'Klingon', 'foreheads', 'original', 'series', 'mirror', 'universe', 'featuring', 'USS', 'Defiant', 'Tholian', 'Web.One', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'season', 'was', 'final', 'episode', '..These', 'Are', 'Voyages', 'place', 'Enterprise-D', 'featuring', 'Riker', 'Troi.Instead', 'giving', 'NX-01', 'crew', 'dignified', 'send', 'off', 'were', 'used', 'supporting', 'characters', 'glorified', 'Next', 'Generation', 'episode.The', 'finale', 'written', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'was', 'called', 'Valentine', 'fans', '.But', 'real', 'valentine', 'was', 'entire', 'fourth', 'season', 'finally', 'gave', 'fans', 'what', 'wanted', 'most', 'problematic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'dignified', 'ending', 'dispite', 'weak', 'finale']",N/A
929561,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B000AOEMXC,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[8, 10]","Manny Coto was given the unenviable task of trying to save Star Trek: Enterprise from its creators. After 3 rather lukewarm seasons, both Berman and Braga stepped away from the show (though Berman would go on record saying that he still over-saw the day-to-day production of the show). The Xindi arc, while it had problems, worked as a story tool. But instead of doing a season long story, Coto decided they would do mini-arcs, some about 3 episodes long. This gave the chance to flesh out good stories -plus it saved on the budget as sets could reused. Also, the show would now be filmed in HD video to save more money, and would run only 22 episodes (all Treks since the TNG have run 26 episodes, but with the last two seasons of ENT, it would be reduced to 24 and the after mentioned 22).Judith Reeves-Stevens and her husband Garfield -respected long-time Star Trek novelists -were signed on to help, while Paramount would go after some casting stunts (Peter Weller and Joanna Cassidy) in hopes of showing fans the new direction the series was taking. The biggest stunt was bring back Brent Spiner. The former TNG actor was signed onto play Arik Soong, whose's ancestors would go on to create Data. The three episode arc explored how Soong was trying to create better humans with embryos left from the Eugenics War. While it was clever stunt, and gave long-time fans a feeling that Coto was trying to tie-in this prequel into TOS, the story itself was not that interesting, and plot points on why the there are embryos left from time period (something that could've be given a good moral argument) are quickly glossed over for needless violence. And once again, the white arrows point to the obvious conclusion ruined the whole story (which can damage any prequel style of storytelling).The Vulcan story line by the Reeves-Stevens almost gave me hope. While it contained plot holes, the 3-part story was filled with Vulcan intrigue -giving us, perhaps, and explanation as to why these Vulcans are so different from the ones we would eventually see on TOS.Still, the show failed on a couple of other stories, mainly the 2-part opener (which is not Coto's fault, as he forced to figure out how to get out of the corner that Berman and Braga painted the crew into) along with bland transporter story Daedalus, the overused aliens-are-observing-the-crew-again of The Observer Effect, the Bound episode (which still showed the series was never ever going to treat women with any sort of dignity) and the 2-part Mirror universe story, In a Mirror, Darkly. For those who say that the story was just a good romp with the cast able to chew the scenery, I say that was its problem. It should fit into the storyline of the Mirror universe that TOS did and what would be continued years later on DS9. In the end, it impacted nothing. That was what was wrong with the franchise, of course. It's impact on mainstream audience was gone. It had lost 10 million viewers since its launch and after being dumped to Fridays, its doom was sealed. The final episode, written by series creators Berman and Braga (and rumored to have been penned a year earlier when it looked like the show was not returning for a 4th year), was a horrible story which featured the return of Jonathan Frakes as Riker and Marina Sirtis as Troi and is set within TNG's fifth season episode The Pegasus. It felt so forced and while I enjoy Frakes and Sirtis, who have so much chemistry together (something both Voyager and ENT lacked with its cast), it was a real disservices to ENT crew. Tucker's death was meaningless and was a sad commentary on how far the franchise had diverged from its original beginnings.So 7 bad stories out of 22. Not bad in some peoples books. But Trek needed 22 excellent, high rated episodes to come back for a 5th season. But, it was never going to come.In February 2005 (during the production of Demons and Terra Prime), word came that UPN was cancelling the show (which surprised no hardcore fan, as most expected this would be the shows final season). But the season was a turn-around from the three previous three, and Coto deserved, perhaps, a chance to continue with a fifth season.Perhaps then, maybe some explanation of Temporal Cold War - a thread of the series since its beginning and unceremoniously dropped (or forgotten) by season three -would've come forward, as we are left with never finding out who Future Guy really was.Still, at the end of the day, Trek was never going to be saved with letter writing campaigns, as UPN was trying to lure a female audience who liked its urban comedies and American's Next Top Model reality show. Demographically, Trek did not fit in with who they were trying to get. Like it or not, there was the true reality.Could've Trek been brought to another network, like Sci Fi? I doubt it, even if cable network had room for it. The franchise is expensive and even moving the entire production to Vancouver they would've still would've needed to cut the budget further. Plus, Trek was the butt of many jokes, and the network heads felt the show was no longer a viable entity to invest in.Plus, Trek did need to rest after 18 years on TV. It needs to heal the schism in the fan base that Berman and Braga created. It needs to go back and understand why most of TOS 79 episodes still stand well today.And while DS9 will always be seen as the Red-headed stepchild of all the Trek series, it still remains the most creative and I believe if Trek is return anytime to soon, it will need to learn from DS9 and even Sci Fi's remake of Battlestar Galactica. The allegory tales have always proven to be Trek's best way of telling a story. BG -a huge post 9/11 tale -has shown what the Law & Order franchise has been doing for years -that you can get good ratings from tales ripped from the headlines. Trek has only made minor attempts over Voyager's 7-year run and Enterprise's four-year run to appeal to the fans who liked those stories. In abandoning its fundamental principles, it doomed it self to mockery and found out that while fans will put up with jeering from non-fans, it will not tolerate it from creators of Trek itself.",3,A

I was very very sad to see this show cancelled, i had hoped for the usual 7 season life that star trek shows had enjoyed, before, however, what they did here with this season , makes the send off much easier to bear, as the conclusion really leaves you satisfied and fullfilled, now all we need is another star trek show on televison, or we could always hope they realise what a mistake they made cancelling enterprise, and put it back on the air.All and all i couldnt recomend this series more, to star trek fans, like myself, this will be a great treat, and a must have, for those who just enjoy science fiction , i highly recomend this series as a great moment in television science fiction.",5,GREAT closure,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,1750,"['Xindi', 'saga', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'Cold', 'Front', 'II', 'connect', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '3', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'extremelly', 'impressed', 'chances', 'taken', 'season', 'episodes', 'sometime', 'span', 'ark', 'three', 'sometimes', 'two', 'episodes', 'random', 'one', 'off', 'even', 'frawned', 'television', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'tell', 'stories', 'season', '4', 'wanted', 'tell.The', 'increased', 'production', 'value', 'quality', 'writting', 'reached', 'new', 'quality', 'high', 'comprised', 'fact', 'show', 'became', 'lot', 'darker', 'episodes', 'mirror', 'darkly', 'parts', 'II', 'telling', 'story', 'mirror', 'universe', 'enterprise', 'ship', 'war', 'also', 'incredible', 'apearence', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'robocop', 'episode', 'terra', 'prima', 'xenophobia', 'earth.I', 'was', 'also', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'teh', 'extras', 'seemed', 'give', 'good', 'amount', 'inside', 'staff', 'cast', 'favourite', 'moments', 'production', 'information', 'great', 'other', 'snippets', 'how', 'enterprise', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'sad', 'see', 'show', 'cancelled', 'i', 'had', 'hoped', 'usual', '7', 'season', 'life', 'star', 'trek', 'shows', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'however', 'what', 'did', 'here', 'season', 'send', 'off', 'much', 'easier', 'bear', 'conclusion', 'really', 'satisfied', 'fullfilled', 'now', 'need', 'star', 'trek', 'show', 'televison', 'could', 'always', 'hope', 'realise', 'what', 'mistake', 'made', 'cancelling', 'enterprise', 'put', 'back', 'air.All', 'i', 'couldnt', 'recomend', 'series', 'more', 'star', 'trek', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'treat', 'must', 'have', 'who', 'just', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'i', 'highly', 'recomend', 'series', 'great', 'moment', 'television', 'science', 'fiction']",N/A

929565,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B000AOEMXC,iMike,"[4, 4]","I will never stray from Amazon again for another Star Trek Blu-Ray set.  I've always been interested in the pricing contrasts between the TNG Blu-Rays and the ENT Blu-Rays.  Amazon sells the TNG Blus for around $60.00 on release week; ENT has always been a few dollars higher.  If I recall Season 3 of ENT on Blu-Ray was also $74.00 on release week.  I found S4 of ENT at BestBuy.com for $59.99 so I decided to stray from Amazon.  Sure, I saved $15.00, but I wasted money in expedited shipping.  I paid for the expedited shipping, ordering on release date.  While I did get my package a day early (it was expected tomorrow, it came today, for which I'm grateful) I feel like paying for expedited shipping I shouldn't have had to wait just shy of a week.  With Amazon, I never pay for expedited shipping.  It may be I'm near a shipping hub, but with Amazon I can do the free shipping and almost always get my package within two business days.Now, on to the set itself.  CBS-D gave us a four-part documentary for the fourth season of 'Enterprise' called &#34;Before Her Time: Decommissioning Enterprise.&#34;  This four-part documentary covers several important topics.  Manny Coto, who took the reigns in Season Four, is heavily featured all four documentaries.  He discusses not only his experiences coming off of Season Three going into Season Four, but his reactions learning he was in charge going into the fourth season.  He also talks heavily about his plans for the fifth season and beyond, an intriguing arc that would have featured William Shatner (but the network said no to due to the price), plans for the Romulans and T'Pol, and more of the Mirror Universe.Rick Berman and Brannon Braga discuss their feelings about being blamed for the extinction of the Star Trek television franchise.  They also open up about their feelings about the series cancellation.  This is especially revealing because Brannon is very open about what he thought (looking back, I think, rightfully so) were network failings.  The cast also gives a lot of insights and personal opinions.  Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) and Connor Trinneer (Tripp) talk about their feelings on the Tripp/T'Pol relationship, which is fun to watch.  Every insight and opinion given is unique.Beyond the four-part documentary, there is the bevy of special features included on the original Season Four DVDs, newly-recorded episode commentaries, and a newly-produced roundtable of writers from 'Enterprise.'Roger Lay did a spectacular job on the newly-produced bonus material.  You can feel a bit of emptiness watching the documentaries how everyone involved felt at the time, realizing that the television franchise was coming to an end.  Roger Lay did a fantastic job capturing that feeling.This set is a must buy if you've purchased the first three seasons of 'Enterprise' on Blu-Ray.",5,Fabulous Final Season ...

929566,A16YCLRKOU0EV3,B000AOEMXC,Jacob Joseph,"[2, 2]","Manny Coto ran the show for the final season, and did a great job, unfortunately, the studio was dead-set on cancelling the series.  The Arik Soong trilogy with Brent Spiner was great, as was the Vulcan trilogy and the Romulan trilogy, both of which foreshadowed the Romulan War. The Klingon two-parter addressed the difference in the their appearance as time went on in an interesting way. The Mirror Universe two-parter was the best of the season with the altered opening credits. The series finale was the low point, however this has been rectified by the novel series. I'm glad that Archer was mentioned in the Star Trek movie reboot. I only wish the prequel movie ""Star Trek: The Beginning"" written by Erik Jendrensen would have been made.

929567,A1FEITLECMZ6EW,B000AOEMXC,Jeffrey Thomas,"[2, 2]","Spoilers included:The main problem with this episode is that they decided to combine it with the Next Generation series. This, being the last episode of Enterprise, should have just been Enterprise, no other series included. The ending not connected with that last statement as it was a good ending. I'm talking about the ""Going where no one has gone before"" ending, not the stupid cutting off at the speech about the Federation Charter.To start using the magnifying glass, let's look closer:First, you realize that the episode features Riker going into a holographic program of the events in the last episode of the Enterprise series. What's even stupider is they relate this to the Pegasus in TNG (The Next Generation series) which shouldn't even be an issue as the episode about the Pegasus should've covered the experiment that was done on the Pegasus. In that episode, to clear things up, everything was revealed to Picard about the experiments about a phased-cloaking device on-board the Pegasus. Also, the episode was really good. This series, Enterprise, didn't need to add anything else to that. In fact, I think adding this in with that episode is weird. This was not needed at all.Second, you skip from part to part. Better yet, you skip to years ahead. Yes, you add descriptions of things, but still, if people wanted to skip ahead, why not just add another season, or more than one season. The whole skipping from place to place was really weird, and I think it threw things off for a last episode. A last episode of a series like this should be about the series it is in, and be straight forward, not confusing to people. If the episode wasn't skipping around all the time it probably would've been better. Personally, I think if they needed more time to encompass everything, they should've added more episodes to help instead of bunching everything here.Third, this being the worst in my opinion, you get to the ending, the Federation Charter part, the moment that's been talked about through a lot of the Enterprise series, and you cut it off. Archer is walking to the Charter to make his speech and you cut it off with him walking to it. This is the stupidest thing in my opinion. Why put so much suspense around something and not even allow time for people to enjoy the event. Very very very, much more very's, disappointing.Last, when you get down to it, you know by now you have people who can write great episodes, thus meaning that the problem lies with the fact that the best way to do this was not done. When you have a good crew, like this, and you see a failure like this, it brings down the respect for the series. This ending ruined it for a lot of people. Very disappointing. With any great series, when you end it badly, you're going to get scolded, and for good reason. You have talent, and you chuck it out the window for a poor ending. I'll relate this to kind of give you a picture: You remember Harry Potter 7 part 2, the movie? Well, if you remember the parts after Voldemort dies you see Harry walk into the castle with people all around and no one says anything. It's just silence. There might be some motion, like a thumbs up or something, but everything is silent. If anyone's read the beginning of the first book you know that everyone was overjoyed at the prospect of Voldemort having disappeared. Now, with everyone knowing he's dead, everyone's silent. Surprising? Very much. Also, I got the distinct impression he killed Voldemort in the Great Hall in the book. However, the battle scene in the movie did fine. However, the way Voldemort died was stupid in my opinion.Anyways, my point is that you have a great series going and you end it horribly. It's very stupid. To end it like this is a whole lot more than disappointing. I'm talking about the Enterprise series, but I suppose HP 7 part 2 is applicable here to.Anyways, so the last episode ended horribly. I give it no more than one star as it has not earned more. I'll give it a star for creativity, however, ending it like this with all it had going for it I think it should lose any stars I'd give to it. One, is the best I'll give to it.So, my points are, unneeded adding of TNG into series, unnecessary skipping where more episodes were needed, and very bad ending of cutting off the Federation Charter part.Also, I'd like to add that although Trip died in this episode, I can understand that happening. Him dieing or not probably would've been fine if things were better put. Meaning, either better episode or longer series that stayed good.In my opinion, this series is great, minus the last episode. It just ended very badly. I'll give everything in the series, except the last episode, a 4.5 out of 5. It was great, with a few things I think that could've been better.So, great series, but bad ending.",1,"Great Series, Horrible Ending",1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,4811,"['Spoilers', 'included',

929568,AB33FFMQMZS5T,B000AOEMXC,Jonathan Cortez,"[2, 2]","For Star Trek fans that abandoned the show in season 1 or 2 or never got into it, I strongly recommend season 4. It has intense plots, great characters, epic battles, suspense, and ample moral/intellectual pondering material.Much of the season is a homage to TOS. There's Orions, Andorians, Tellarites, Gorn, and Tholians. All of these races were popular among fans, but TNG era Trek didn't use them.In Season 3, Enterprise borrowed long story arcs, epic battles, and darker themes from DS9. This is continued in season 4, which perfects the three part episode. The season is designed to be watched as a series of stories, each one building off of the previous ones.Manny Coto took over the show's direction, and he wanted to bridge Enterprise to the other shows. So he created story arcs that would advance the plot by leaps and bounds.Stormfront I and II and Home: Enterprise has a plot called the Temporal Cold War. The producers felt it needed to be wrapped up to focus on the development of the Federation. I felt this arc was a little weak and overdone, as I think there's been plenty on Nazis in ST already.The Augments: A three part episode guest starring Brent Spiner. This arc ties into Khan, Data's eventual creation, and features the Orion Syndicate. Brent Spiner is superb, but all of ST's stories featuring genetically engineered super humans always play out the same.Vulcan Awakening: We see a younger T'Pau, the Katra of Surak, a Sehlat, an epic battle, and the first signs of the Earth-Romulan War. For all fans of Vulcans, this is a must see. Vulcans were the first alien race ever seen in Star Trek, and this gives them the screen time and development deserved.Daedalus, Observer Effect: Stand alone episodes. These are morality tales, and I think on par with some of TNG's great moral/emotional stories.Romulan Plot: The Romulans attempt to start a war between the Andorians, Humans, Tellarites, and Vulcans. Jeffrey Coombs (from DS9), plays Shran (an Andorian captain), and Coto based much of Andorian culture off of the novel ""Among the Clans.""Klingon Augments: Finally explains why Klingons look different in TOS. Some people might think this explanation is bulls***, but considering how deep a hole ST had dug with the issue, I think Enterprise gives a creative solution.Bound: Orion sex slaves! Who doesn't like those?In a Mirror Darkly, I and II: The best Mirror Universe story ever. This is in my top five ST two-parters. Everyone is evil, treacherous, and/or slutty. Plus, there's a Vulcan with a goatee.Demons/Terra Prime: This was designed to be the actual climax of the show, since Enterprise wasn't getting a feature length. The writers made sure the entire cast had an important role, and they ended the series with the creation of a proto-Federation. However, in order for humanity to become part of a uniformed interstellar community, they had to deal with intense xenophobia at home. Peter Weller plays one of the most hatable villains in ST, complete with an evil widow's peak.These Are the Voyages: Very controversial episode, because it's primarily about William Riker (TNG) and ruins some Enterprise plot elements. I understand and appreciated the writer's desire to connect Enterprise to TNG, but I think it would have been better before Terra Prime and without the lame character developments.I strongly recommend that all ST fans check this season out. If you didn't like the show, this season might change your mind. If you haven't watched Enterprise before, check out some key Season 1 and 2 episodes to get a feel for the characters. If you like them, watch the whole show. If not, check out this season. It's critical to the Star Trek canon.If you think ST should be reset at the end of every episode and shouldn't have action, then your opinion is extremely different than mine. I think story arcs and action ad to the emotional intensity and make for much more interesting plots.I'm very sad this show got canceled. Enterprise had found it's direction and an excellent story formula.

The show moved to Fridays, a move that showed a lack of confidence in the show.Behind the scenes, Manny Coto took over as executive producer and show runner during this time.  His infusion of fresh ideas brought us an exciting, entertaining, and unpredictable season.The only reason I was still watching it at this point was because I had friends who came over to watch it with me.  If I could have talked them out of it, I would have missed this season.  That would have been a real shame.Season 4 starts with a two parter bringing a conclusion not only to last season's finale, which found Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) in a World War II where aliens were helping the Axis, but also ended the series long temporal cold war story arc.  The ending felt a little rushed, like Mr. Coto wanted to be done with it and move on.Once the season got going, however, we were treated to lots of two or three episode story arcs that were highly entertaining.  The first such story involved tracking down so-called Augments, humans with altered genetic abilities and brought Brent Spiner as a guest star.  These episodes built upon stories from the original series and one of the movies, neither of which I had seen.  I enjoyed them, but not as much as I would have if I had seen the back-story.Many of the stories worked to set up the future Treks.  One arc was devoted to a civil war on the Vulcan home world.  Through T'Pal (Jolene Blalock) we got a glimpse into the changes that would come to their culture before the Original Series started.One inconsistency between the Original Series and every other Trek series has been the Klingon makeup.  A two parter from this season explains why when Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley) is kidnapped and made to try to fix a genetic disease.  I hadn't been looking for an explanation to this inconsistency, but I liked the one they gave us.In another move to please fans, we get a two parter set in the Mirror Universe.  This was my first exposure to the dark side, but I can see the appeal.  It was quite fun.In the third season, Chief Engineer ""Trip"" Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and T'Pol had begun to develop a reluctant attraction to each other.  This is build upon during the final season.  At times it takes on a soap opera feel, but ultimately it keeps the viewer hooked.Of course, one thing everyone wanted to see from this series was the start of the Federation.  While we only get a glimpse of it during the finale, the basis is laid in a three part storyline in which Enterprise finds itself caught between the Andorians, Tellarites, and Vulcans when someone begins attacking all three of their ships.The season finale was a bitter disappointment to long time Trekkies.  Set several years ahead of the rest of season 4, it shows the founding of the Federation via the holodeck of the Next Generation's Enterprise as Commander Riker (guest star Jonathan Frakes) uses the events to help him make a decision.  Designed to be a finale to the recent 20 year run of Star Trek on TV, it upset many fans with it's focus on Next Generation characters over Enterprise characters.Naturally, every season has a few dud episodes, but this season's entertaining episodes far outweighed the mediocre ones.

929574,ACY27M578XP2R,B000AOEMXC,"Mark C. Aron ""quality dvd & book man""","[11, 15]","the 4th and last season of enterprise was by any measure, the best season of enterprise and one can make a good case that season 4 of enterprise is one of the better of all 28 seasons of star trek. when stories about enterprise first came out, i through then (and still do) that the concept was great. however the fan base had to wait until season 4 to see what they promised as far back the summer of 2000. in season 4 the story arc from season 3 was finished up, at the same the temoral cold war story was finally put to bed. we also saw that even in the mid 22nd century there was still fallout from the eugenics wars,we found out why vulcan in the 22nd century was so much different than in the 23rd century, and why it changed. we learned why some klingons in the 22nd century looked differentthan most other klingons, and  we found out that even before there was a federation, there was ""section 31"". we also found out the romulans were up their old tricks and create hatred amonst the local races. about the only bad episode was ""these are the voyages........."" which turned out to be a ""tng"" episode than a enterprise episode, let alone the series finale.it is no wonder (if it is true) the cast member, almost to a person hate this episode, because they feel they were hosed, slimed, and made to feel 2nd class to the ""tng"" crew.the irony is that looking back, season 4 was doomed from the beginning. viacom and paramount decided to keep enterprise around only to provide enough episodes make it easier to sell in reruns. how did things come to this impass----1. the backround (or bible) for the series set up confict between earth and vulcan that lasted until season 4. i have read enough to know that many people blame rick berman & brannon  braga for not only the downfall of enterprise, but all but claim that they went out of there to sink the entire fanchise. while i think that is unfair, i do feel that the ""bible"" did cripple the show in it's first 2 years, and that was something that they are liable for, intender or not.2. viacom & paramount (for better or worse) own the copyrightthe the star trek universe, and i do not think that they competent manage the fanchise. it is clear the ""upn"" networkis no longer wants the type of viewers that want to watch goodquality tv. instead ""upn"" seems to want to bring on-board nothing but airheads who would not know good tv if it fell on their heads. what should happen if/when another show is created is to market the new show in the same was as ""tng"" & ""ds9"" and other sci-fi shows that are currently on tv, or work with outside network like the sci-fi channel. however viacom & paramount seem more interested in cross-feeding programingto itself, and that case star trek, at least for now does notfit into viacom's plans for the future. as for the future, i am not very hopful unless there is a radical change at viacom/paramount even with the recent changes in corp. stucture.",5,a great last season,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2943,"['4th', 'last', 'season', 'enterprise', 'was', 'measure', 'best', 'season', 'enterprise', 'one', 'can', 'make',

929575,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000AOEMXC,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[26, 28]","Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series of 1966-1969), 200 years before the time of Captain Picard (during the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" of 1987-1994) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek: First Contact"".The new series, entitled ""Enterprise"", debuted in the fall of 2001, months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Voyager"", concluded its seven-year run.  As the show's title implied, the ship used in the show was named ""Enterprise"" and had serial number NX-01 with a maximum speed of warp 5.  It's crew was comprised of Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"" of 1989-1993), Vulcan science officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), pilot Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), ship's communications officer Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), the Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), weapon's officer Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and ship's engineer Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).Over 12,000,000 viewers watched the first season's premiere episode, but subsequent shows had ever-shrinking audiences.  The average number of viewers per first-season episode was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  After nearly canceling the show after its third season, UPN gave it one more chance, but the average number of viewers per fourth season episode was only 3.1 million. UPN then cancelled the series.Why did ""Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  The blame rests primarily with Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who's combined strangle hold upon the show's writing during the first three seasons drove fans away.  The fourth season, however, was placed under the creative control of Manny Coto.Whereas the first three seasons of ""Enterprise"" were largely disconnected from the four previous ""Star Trek"" TV series, Manny Coto successfully reconnected the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" with the rest of the ""Star Trek"" universe.  He began the fourth season by personally finishing the temporal cold war and other disconnected story elements from the first three seasons by writing the first two episodes of the fourth season himself.  He then produced (and sometimes co-wrote) the next 19 episodes, most of which were parts of several multi-episode story arcs that filled in many holes that had been left from previous ""Star Trek"" TV series and the ten feature length films.  He also corrected some of the mistakes created by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga during the first three seasons of ""Enterprise"".The first story arc (episodes: ""Borderland"", ""Cold Station 12"" and ""The Augments"") featured a guest appearance by Brent Spiner playing Dr. Arik Soong, who had continued the work done by geneticists that had created genetically-enhanced individuals such as Kahn (refer to the original ""Star Trek"" series episode ""Space Seed"" and the second feature length film, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"").  The second story arc (episodes ""The Forge"", ""Awakening"" and ""Kir'Shara"") began with the bombing of Earth's embassy on Vulcan and quickly makes Capt. Archer aware that Vulcan's population is dangerously divided.  (No other ""Star Trek"" TV series spent this much time on Vulcan.)The third story arc (episodes ""Babel One"", ""United"" and ""The Aenar"") featured the Tellurites, Andorians, Vulcans and Romulans.  The Romulans try to disrupt peace talks between the Tellurites and Andorians. (This is the only time that the planet Andoria is visited during any ""Star Trek"" TV series.)  The fourth story arc (episodes ""Affliction"" and ""Divergence"") featured Dr. Phlox, who is kidnapped by Klingons who want to stop a genetic disease that is changing their appearance to look more human.The fifth story arc (episodes ""In a Mirror, Darkly"", two parts) is a trip to the infamous alternate universe.  The sixth and final story arc (episodes ""Demons"" and ""Terra Prime"") is about xenophobic humans that want to undermine talks that may lead to a coalition of several planets, including Earth.Manny Coto's fourth season episodes were great, but not enough people were watching.  Of the 22 fourth season episodes, the best were those 19 that followed the first two and before the final one.  The final episode (""These Are the Voyages..."") was disappointing as it was written and produced by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Though it featured guest appearances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis (as William Riker and Deanna Troi, respectively, of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), this episode was as poorly written as the first three seasons that Rick Berman & Brannon Braga had strangled.Of the 28 years of live-action ""Star Trek"" TV series, I regard the third season of ""Enterprise"" to be the worst, but Manny Coto's wonderful fourth season was one of the best.  Sadly, what I and many other ""Star Trek"" fans had hoped would occur during ""Enterprise"" was the Earth-Romulan War (as eluded to in the original ""Star Trek"" TV series) and the formation of the United Federation of Planets (UFP); but neither of these could be produced because of the show's premature cancellation.  Manny Coto would no doubt have made these stories wonderfully if he had been given the opportunity.Overall, I rate the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  I wholeheartedly thank Manny Coto for reconnecting ""Enterprise"" with the rest of the ""Star Trek"" universe during its fourth & final season.  Let us hope that any possible future ""Star Trek"" productions are not controlled by Rick Berman or Brannon Braga.",5,"Thank You Manny Coto For Reconnecting Enterprise with ""Star

Enterprise , had very good hopes from the start , but they had lame writers and didnt correct their mistake till they brought in Manny Cotto in season 3 , then the show blasted off , but way too late , many fans aready left the show . With Cotto writing a season with an arc really put ENTERPRISE  back on the map , too bad they killed off Steven Culps character, He would had made a good cast member. Season 4 was a trip back to the originals storylines , with Orion slavegirls , a MIRROR -MIRROR two part story that was awesome (the Gorn was a plus ) The three part arc with Brent Spiner about the genaric enginiered super youths , that was also a great show . Yeah also killing off a cast member was bad as was the final show .

929580,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000AOEMXC,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[29, 35]","Usually with a TV series, the strategy is to hook the audience early, get enough episodes for syndication, and then worry less about quality, producing episodes that are just good enough to stay on the air and ensure video and DVD sales.  ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" could be a case study in doing the opposite.  The uneven, mostly disappointing first three seasons of the show felt like a retread of earlier ""Star Treks"" and other sci-fi, and there appeared to be an assumption that audiences would simply stick with the show out of Pavlovian habit.  Fans will watch anything with ""Star Trek"" attached to it, right?  When ratings plunged and budgets got slashed, the best thing that could happen to ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" occurred -- producer Manny Coto arrived to salvage things.  The fourth season is clearly its best, with the show for the first time beginning to feel like a prequel that didn't rudely skip over the series that started everything.  Had this season been the first, ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" might still be on the air; as things stand, ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" was cancelled just as it finally showed potential, the accumulated damage to its reputation from previous seasons too much to draw audiences back.  Scott Bakula, visibly older and looking at times not unlike Joe Camel, nonetheless finally musters some of the appeal he had on ""Quantum Leap"" in episodes that give him more to do than get beaten or bark at people for no reason.  Even the often appealing but ultimately go-nowhere romance between T'Pol and Tucker found its way into an excellent story with the series' penultimate episode.  Unfortunately, even eye-catching apples can have worms, and two episodes stand out as inexcusably awful:  ""Daedulus"" and ""These are the Voyages.""  In fact, the final episode feels like the punch line to an otherwise funny joke.  While ""Star Trek:  Enterprise"" had high quality special effects and great potential, it will probably -- and with justification -- be remembered as the series that killed the franchise . . . at least until the franchise inevitably gets resurrected.  The generally lowbrow stories and paint-by-numbers approach to telling them are what sent the series to the bottom of the ratings, not an oversupply of ""Star Trek"" on TV.  When ""Star Trek"" shows some smarts again, people who read more than the funnies and sports page and can chew with their mouth closed will return -- in droves.",4,"The Best of the Four Seasons, Despite a True Stinker of a Finale",1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,2427,"['Usually', 'TV', 'series', 'strategy', 'hook', 'audience', 'early', 'get', 'enough', 'episodes', 'syndication', 'then', 'worry', 'less', 'quality', 'producing', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'stay', 'air', 'ensure', 'video', 'DVD', 'sales', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'could', 'be', 'case', 'study', 'doing', 'opposite', 'uneven', 'mostly', 'disappointing', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'felt', 'retread', 'earlier', 'Star', 'Treks', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'there', 'appeared', 'be', 'assumption', 'audiences', 'would', 'simply', 'stick', 'show', 'Pavlovian', 'habit', 'Fans', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'Star', 'Trek', 'attached', 'right', 'When', 'ratings', 'plunged', 'budgets', 'got', 'slashed', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'occurred', 'producer', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'arrived', 'salvage', 'things', 'fourth', 'season', 'clearly', 'best', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'beginning', 'feel', 'prequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'rudely', 'skip', 'series', 'started', 'everything', 'Had', 'season', 'been', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'air', 'things', 'stand', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'cancelled', 'just', 'finally', 'showed', 'potential', 'accumulated', 'damage', 'reputation', 'previous', 'seasons', 'too', 'much', 'draw', 'audiences', 'back', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'visibly', 'older', 'looking', 'times', 'not', 'Joe', 'Camel', 'nonetheless', 'finally', 'appeal', 'had', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'episodes', 'give', 'more', 'do', 'get', 'beaten', 'bark', 'people', 'reason', 'Even', 'often', 'appealing', 'ultimately', 'go-nowhere', 'romance', ""T'Pol"", 'Tucker', 'found', 'way', 'excellent', 'story', 'series', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'eye-catching', 'apples', 'can', 'have', 'worms', 'two', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'inexcusably', 'awful', 'are', 'Voyages', 'fact', 'final', 'episode', 'feels', 'punch', 'line', 'otherwise', 'funny', 'joke', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'had', 'high', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'potential', 'will', 'probably', 'justification', 'be', 'remembered', 'series', 'killed', 'franchise', 'least', 'franchise', 'inevitably', 'resurrected', 'generally', 'lowbrow', 'stories', 'paint-by-numbers', 'approach', 'telling', 'are', 'what', 'sent', 'series', 'bottom', 'ratings', 'not', 'oversupply', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TV', 'When', 'Star', 'Trek', 'smarts', 'again', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'more', 'funnies', 'sports', 'page', 'can', 'chew', 'mouth', 'closed', 'will', 'return', 'droves']",N/A

It contains some of the best episodes of the series, but also the worst one of possibly the whole franchise- ""These are the Voyages"", titled as ""Valentine for fans"" by the writers, but it was the exact opposite of that, a slap in the face of those who liked Enterprise and its crew as well as the cast. I won't go into detail, this episode may have been average as a stand-alone one in the middle of a season, but as a finale it was just bad. Totally ignoring any character development established in the previous seasons, only a 1-hour finale instead of the established 2-hours,  but to bring more insult, bringing in two characters from TNG and delegating Enterprises' own cast to the rank of gueststars. I didn't need a farewell to the whole franchise, I wanted a fair farewell to Enterprise and we didn't get that.As for the rest of the season, it contains gems like ""Home"", ""Demons"", ""Terra Prime"" and the Vulcan-Arc trilogy ""The Forge"", ""The Awakening"" and ""Kir'Shara"".Enterprise was in my opinion the best of all Trek series. While many Trekkers might disagree, I think it was the most human Trek and most suited for the casual viewer, not only the die-hard fan.The DVDs are what you come to expect of Paramount, the extras are okay, but not as generous as the previous seasons, the bloopers are painfully short.

This is one of the rare instances where budget cutting worked in favor of the series as it was shot in HD so the transition for blu-ray was a bit easier here than prior seasons which were shot on film (a naturally HD format), then assembled on HD videotape (where the the show was compromised due to the choices during the assembly process for broadcast). Also, seasons one and two had lower resolution CGI which was uprezzed (noticeably)for blu-ray resulting in less than ideal image quality and, given the number of visual effects per episode, compromised the show.The big attraction aside from the HD transfer which looks extremely good here (it was no doubt tweaked a bit here for blu release but the source remains the same as for the original DVDs--high rez, yes, but older HD masters)are the new commentary tracks and feature length (although it is broken up into sections) documentary on the challenges the cast and crew faced with diminishing viewers, as well as, the struggle to stay afloat.All the original special features form the DVDs have been ported over for this edition.The second special feature is a terrific featurette featuring the writers who worked on the fourth season (with the exception of showrunner Manny Cotto who wasn't available due to a conflict with the revived ""24"")discussing the challenges they faced but also the opportunity that Cotto gave them at exploring HOW the original series world evolved by looking back into the past.There is an interesting tidbit here--Rick Berman and Brannon Braga wrote the final episode of season three as a cliffhanger. This angered the suits at UPN and Paramount because this took away the chance to cancel the show at the end of season three. Braga admits that he and Berman had that somewhat in mind as they knew that Paramount would never accept a cliffhanger as a conclusion as it would anger fans and damage the abilityt to syndicate the series. The studio (and UPN) insisted that they go back and reshoot the ending. It was impossible as it was completed and the cast members that they needed for it were already gone. It did allow for ""Enterprise"" to enjoy its best season. Sure there were duds (every season of every ""Star Trek"" series had its duds)but it allowed for ambition and real focus. It's just a pity that the show wasn't allowed a fifth season as it would, no doubt, have continued to explore the formation of the Federation and background on the series in compelling ways.Original DVD Review:""Enterprise"" was the victim of ""Star Trek"" success; the new series constantly was compared to other shows in the ""franchise"". It took ""Enterprise"" a couple of seasons to find its footing. Luckily, by the third season the show took flight with the season long story arc based around the Xindi threat to Earth.The fourth season is a gem. We see producer Manny Coto and his writers turn the season three cliffhanger into a memorable two part episode for season four with ""Cold Front"". Archer returns home a change man in ""Home"" and we meet another Dr. Soong--this one the ""father"" to survivors of the Eugenics war. The fourth season had fun connecting the dots between ""Enterprise"" and the original series. ""In a Mirror Darkly"" parts 1 & 2 both provided ample entertainment and showed us what really happened to the Defiant from The Original Series episode ""The Tholian Web"". A very good series continued to get better.The DVD picture quality looks terrific overall. The extras are a bit lighter than what I would have expected here given that this was the last season of the series. I am disappointed that Paramount feels the need to charge the same amount for a set with less extras and episodes but the quality of the episodes makes up for part of that. We get featurettes on the visual effects, the wrap party, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the filming of the last episode. Best Buy customers get two additional featurettes available only there and at Musicland (whereas everywhere in the world these two featurettes on Michael Westmore's make up and the canines that played Archer's pooch Porthos were included as part of the package). There are three commentary tracks (all of which are available as podcasts at the Star Trek website)for ""In a Mirror Darkly"" parts 1 & 2 and ""Terra Firma"". Michael and Denise Okuda provide more text commentary tracks and, while they are occasionally enjoyable, I wish they had more to do with the episodes being shown.""Enterprise"" wasn't cancelled because of ratings. Sure the ratings had fallen but the show was really cancelled because Paramount wanted to move the UPN network to a new demographic--shows designed to appeal only to women--in hopes of expanding their ratings on the network. ""Enterprise"" just didn't fit into their game plan. It's a pity because the last season showed tremendous promise and a fifth season would have just build on the success of the fourth season. Paramount kept ""Enterprise"" around to reach the magical 99 mark so that they could syndicate the show (which it met if you split the two hour premiere into two episodes). It's to the production crew and cast's credit that they elected to create something memorable during the last season of a show that was clearly headed for cancellation.",5,"""Enterprise"" soars during
