I'm so happy to see that so many other people treasure The Heavenly Kid as much as I do. If you've never heard of it, it's about a cool guy who dies while racing his car off a cliff. He gets sent back to earth after some time to help out a ""spazola"" of a kid who is actually his son and helps the kid to be cool. If it sounds cheesy, well, it is. But it's got that kind of cheese that could only ferment from the early 80's. There are a couple things you could nitpick at such as when the motorcycle guy tells Lewis Smith's character that they're in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. I live in Ft. Lauderdale and have my entire life and I've never seen a cliff. But hey, that's just overanalyzing. That would be my only complaint.
