His talent allows Arturo Sandoval to travel the world, but his wife and family are back in Cuba.  His wife is a government employee who at first believes in the revolution until her eyes are opened to the reality behind the facade.  The final straw is when Castro kills a hero of the revolution because he feels his monolithic power is threatened.In 1990 Sandoval defects at the US embassy in Greece, but is stopped by bureaucracy until his friend Dizzy Gillespie calls the Vice President....yes, that's right, Dan Quayle the dunce.  Well the only good thing Quayle ever does is speeding Sandoval through the bureaucracy.  The irony here is that any Cuban who can get to the US by raft is granted US citizenship, but Sandoval is thoroughly grilled.The film has some great jazz and Afro-Cuban music and Andy Garcia is believable and entertaining as the lead.

You gotta play the game!  -For Love or CountryIf a character in the movie The Player were pitching For Love or Country, he would describe it thus :  it's the Sound of Music, but set in Cuba.  Indeed, this gross oversimplification manages to capture some  important aspects of the film.  Arturo Sandoval, like the von Trapps, is a real life musician--a  renowned jazz trumpeter--who fled a repressive regime and whose flight was complicated by concerns  for family.  But the differences are also important, and they serve to give this picture a depth and  resonance that make it wholly worthwhile in its own right.First, where the Nazis are so notorious as to immediately invoke our sympathy for the von Trapps,  there has been a disturbing tendency in America to glamorize Fidel Castro and to minimize the crimes  of his regime, right from the very beginning of the Revolution and the absurdly favorable profiles that  the New York Times published in the late 50s.  In a grotesque irony, this film was actually made  during the whole Elian Gonzalez mess, when a significant portion of the American public, and a  majority of the intellectual class, argued that a young boy, whose mother died trying to get him to  freedom, should be returned to live in Castro's dictatorship.  One of the fascinations of For Love or  Country is that it gives us a rare glimpse into the lives of regular Cuban citizens and shows the spirit  crushing effects of Communism on their lives.  And it powerfully demonstrates the illegitimacy of a  political system which is so bent on controlling the minds of its citizenry that even certain rebellious  forms of music are outlawed.  In one of the best scenes, Sandoval's wife, Marianela, asks an official for  permission for her husband to play straightforward jazz, rather than just the distinctively latin jazz that  he has helped pioneer in the band Irakere.  The Party leader ominously warns her not to say something  she'll regret and admonishes her that the Revolution needs everyone's' support to survive.  In turn, she  asks :If the Revolution can't withstand...a Cuban man playing the music he loves, why bother trying to  save it ?What lends this scene its particular power is that, where Arturo has always harbored doubts about the  Revolution and has refused to join the Party, Marianela has been a firm defender and has acted as a  brake on his desire to rebel and even to flee.  This dynamic, of Arturo being forced to choose between  his love for his wife and his yearning to be free to play his own music, gives the story its great drama.  In general, the scenes showing how difficult a choice it is for people to defect, to love family, friends,  and homeland behind, are genuinely affecting, and should serve as a tonic for anyone who questions  the motivations and commitment of refugees who seek our shores.Added to the strong political themes are a hopefully career reviving performance by Andy Garcia, once  one of Hollywood's hottest young stars; a dynamic star turn by Charles S. Dutton as Dizzy Gillespie;  and, of course, a terrific soundtrack.  Unfortunately, this movie, though it won several awards, was  only shown on cable, but now that it is available on a budget priced DVD, perhaps it will find the  wider audience it so richly deserves.  I hope so, though I tend to doubt it.  But there is a consolation; at  the end of the movie you somehow feel a little bit prouder to be an American, just knowing what the  Sandovals went through to become Americans themselves.GRADE : A",5,deserves a wide audience,992908800,"06 19, 2001",2001,3568,"['wan', 'na', 'play', 'horn', 'right', 'got', 'ta', 'game', '-For', 'Love', 'CountryIf', 'character', 'movie', 'Player', 'were', 'pitching', 'Love', 'Country', 'would', 'describe', 'thus', 'Sound', 'Music', 'set', 'Cuba', 'Indeed', 'gross', 'oversimplification', 'manages', 'capture', 'important', 'aspects', 'film', 'Arturo', 'Sandoval', 'von', 'Trapps', 'real', 'life', 'musician', 'renowned', 'jazz', 'trumpeter', 'who', 'fled', 'repressive', 'regime', 'flight', 'was', 'complicated', 'concerns', 'family', 'differences', 'are', 'also', 'important', 'serve', 'give', 'picture', 'depth', 'resonance', 'make', 'wholly', 'own', 'right.First', 'where', 'Nazis', 'are', 'so', 'notorious', 'immediately', 'invoke', 'sympathy', 'von', 'Trapps', 'been', 'disturbing', 'tendency', 'America', 'glamorize', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'minimize', 'crimes', 'regime', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'Revolution', 'absurdly', 'favorable', 'profiles', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'published', 'late', '50s', 'grotesque', 'irony', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'whole', 'Elian', 'Gonzalez', 'mess', 'when', 'significant', 'portion', 'American', 'public', 'majority', 'intellectual', 'class', 'argued', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'trying', 'get', 'freedom', 'should', 'be', 'returned', 'live', 'Castro', 'dictatorship', 'One', 'fascinations', 'Love', 'Country', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'regular', 'Cuban', 'citizens', 'spirit', 'crushing', 'effects', 'Communism', 'lives', 'powerfully', 'illegitimacy', 'political', 'system', 'so', 'bent', 'controlling', 'minds', 'citizenry', 'even', 'certain', 'rebellious', 'forms', 'music', 'are', 'outlawed', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'Sandoval', 'wife', 'Marianela', 'official', 'permission', 'husband', 'play', 'straightforward', 'jazz', 'rather', 'just', 'distinctively', 'latin', 'jazz', 'helped', 'pioneer', 'band', 'Irakere', 'Party', 'leader', 'ominously', 'not', 'say', 'something', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'admonishes', 'Revolution', 'everyone', 'support', 'survive', 'turn', 'Revolution', 'ca', ""n't"", 'withstand', 'Cuban', 'man', 'playing', 'music', 'why', 'bother', 'trying', 'save', 'What', 'scene', 'particular', 'power', 'where', 'Arturo', 'always', 'harbored', 'doubts', 'Revolution', 'refused', 'join', 'Party', 'Marianela', 'been', 'firm', 'defender', 'acted', 'brake', 'desire', 'rebel', 'even', 'flee', 'dynamic', 'Arturo', 'being', 'forced', 'choose', 'love', 'wife', 'yearning', 'be', 'free', 'play', 'own', 'music', 'story', 'great', 'drama', 'general', 'scenes', 'showing', 'how', 'difficult', 'choice', 'people', 'defect', 'love', 'family', 'friends', 'homeland', 'are', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'should', 'serve', 'tonic', 'anyone', 'who', 'questions', 'motivations', 'commitment', 'refugees', 'who', 'seek', 'shores.Added', 'strong', 'political', 'themes', 'are', 'hopefully', 'career', 'reviving', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'once', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'hottest', 'young', 'stars', 'dynamic', 'star', 'turn', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'course', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'cable', 'now', 'available', 'budget', 'priced', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'wider', 'audience', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves', 'hope', 'so', 'tend', 'doubt', 'consolation', 'end', 'movie', 'somehow', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'prouder', 'be', 'American', 'just', 'knowing', 'what', 'Sandovals', 'went', 'become', 'Americans', 'themselves.GRADE']",For Love or Country - The Arturo Sandoval Story
578165,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005ALS5,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[34, 41]","FOR LOVE OR COUNTRY is based on the true story of Arturo Sandoval who finally cooperates with the Cuban government and even joins the communist party in order to have the freedom to travel internationally. He was living in a country where there was no respect for human rights, let alone freedom of expression in music.Arturo Sandoval is one of the most brilliant musicians of our time and is known as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the great Dizzy Gillespie. He was born in Artemisa on November 6, 1949. Artemisa is a small town on the outskirts of Havana, Cuba.He realized he was a trumpet player when he was eleven. He began studying classical trumpet at the age of twelve. He is now known as one of the world's most acknowledged guardians of jazz trumpet and flugelhorn. As a Professor, Sandoval has lectured internationally.Filled with a virtuoso capability, he had an intense desire to share his musical gift with those who share the same love for music. Arturo Sandoval appears on the tracks ""Moonglow"" and ""That Old Feeling"" in Rod Stewart's  release ""It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook."" His diverse style can be heard on albums like Gloria Estefan's ""Into the Light."" He also has made a contribution on albums by Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra and Paul Anka.This movie emphasizes his virtuoso technical ability and his specialty in high notes. He also is shown playing the piano and is known for lyrically improvising a ballad. He also had the privilege of creating and performing the score for this movie. The story of his own life. He explains:""When the idea for the movie came up, I was happy to be able to tell my story, but even happier to write the film score,"" he says. ""Music for movies has been my life's passion, and this was my first and biggest step in that direction...""In the movie, Arturo (Cuban-American actor Andy Garc&iacute;a) is thinking about defecting when he meets Marianela (Mia Maestro). She becomes more important to him than freedom. Their beliefs are on the opposite sides of the political spectrum and yet their love binds them to one another as they try to overlook their political differences.Marianela represents family loyalty and the way people who live in Cuba really think. It shows how Marianela goes from being completely loyal to a dictator to having her eyes opened to the reality of the situation. She falls completely in love with this talented musician but fears he may leave her like her first husband. Arturo has also been married before and while he is willing to spend his entire life with Marianela, she has her doubts and issues with trust. She has been betrayed by the government she supported.""What I feel about you. I've never felt it before ... I don't trust it."" -MarianelaThis movie is at times so romantic. Especially the scene where Marianela and Arturo are dancing and when she wakes him up after he spends the night sleeping on a grave. The scene overlooking the ocean is so pristine.After performing with the Cuban Orchestra of Modern Music, he was allowed to start a group called Irakere that promoted a combination of Cuban music and jazz. In 1981 he then leaves Irakere to form his own band.He believes he has a gift to give the world and is fighting a force that threatened to drown his true love, music.After living with his wife in Cuba and starting a family, he decides it is time to leave. He believes that by defecting to the United States he is rejecting a system that kills confidence and personality. Rejecting a government that controls everything to the point that people lose their desire to achieve.The government finally tries to control Sandoval's music and his dream for greater artistic expression. While on a European tour, he leaves for a secret meeting at the U.S. Embassy.Sandoval was granted political asylum in July 1990. Since his defection, Sandoval has increased his classical performances world wide including performances with the National Symphony, L.A. Philharmonic, National Symphony of Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh Symphony.""This was such a blessing for me.  I thank God everyday for being here in this wonderful country and sharing my music.  This experience has been very rewarding.  I hope that our modest musical contribution here today shows we stand united and strong and that we are America the Beautiful."" ~Arturo Sandoval speaking of his opportunity to share his music at the White HouseEven Arturo says he would like to go back to visit his homeland, but under a different government.""Flight to Freedom"" was his first recording immediately following his defection.An emotional movie about the desire to use your God-given talents without repression from those who don't see beauty in the soul. This movie really is about having a dream and finding your true purpose in life. This is a movie about beauty and sadness with a happy ending.Life is truly a dream for those who are free and yet at times even if you are free, you can feel that you are in a prison of yourself. There are times when a person feels they have so much to give and they can't find an outlet for their gift to the world. In such a case a person can at times risk everything for the freedom of expression and the freedom to grow as a person, as a soul.If you never follow your dreams, you might not be really free.A movie about Romance and Freedom everyone should see! Especially romantics and those who love Jazz.~The Rebecca Review",5,Escape to Freedom,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,5425,"['LOVE', 'OR', 'COUNTRY', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Arturo', 'Sandoval',

578166,A17RFKCYS69M3Y,B00005ALS5,Tall Paul,"[2, 3]",Very well done HBO movie about the great Cuban-American jazz trumpeteer. Very emotional and touching performance from Andy. Also a great performance from the unbelievably gorgeous Mia Maestro. Great screenplay that really focused on the characters and the impact the situations had on the family. A DVD worth owning even though its made for cable.,5,Fabulous,1003536000,"10 20, 2001",2001,347,"['Very', 'well', 'done', 'HBO', 'movie', 'great', 'Cuban-American', 'jazz', 'trumpeteer', 'Very', 'emotional', 'touching', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Also', 'great', 'performance', 'unbelievably', 'gorgeous', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'Great', 'screenplay', 'really', 'focused', 'characters', 'impact', 'situations', 'had', 'family', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning', 'even', 'made', 'cable']",For Love or Country - The Arturo Sandoval Story
