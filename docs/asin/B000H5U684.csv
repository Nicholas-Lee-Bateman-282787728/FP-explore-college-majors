This movie is no different, although our first film was a little better than this oneThis movie is bad. Not like ""this is bad for a professional movie"" or ""this is bad for an indie"" or ""this is bad for a fan film on YouTube"" or ""this is bad for cable access television"" or ""this is bad for a Mystery Science Theater movie"". This movie is closer to ""this is bad for a high school English project"". It would never have been released had Tony Jaa not later become famous. But i bet he doesn't tell any of his friends that he was ever in this (despite what other reviews say, Tony Jaa was in the movie and was a major character; you just wouldn't recognize him)i was appalled the first time i saw it but to be mean i made my friends sit through a few minutes of it and eventually it grew on me.

1010035,A262L4PY8IBY2F,B000H5U684,Byoba,"[0, 1]","Actually Tony Jaa is in this movie... But he is not one of the main actors.  He has a cameo appearance.  He appears with a group of ppl who are looking for a villiage relic.  He has on a black jump suit with zebra like designs in the shoulder area of his jacket.  His fight scenes with his mentor are pretty solid.  A lot of viewers see this movie as a disaster, but I have decided to give 3 stars for the effort since they did not use any cheesy wires or cgi which makes the film look more authentic to a real fight.  The problem with most viewers, is the assumption of fights being beautiful and precise... but that is what happens to ppl's mind when they are use to glam down hollywood action... lol!

This is what happens when you give a bunch of high school kids a film camera, send them out into the woods, and tell them to make a movie.  This is the most amateurish piece of crap I have ever seen released on a DVD.  My God do I wish I had read the user reviews on this movie before buying it.  Anyone who gives this more than 1 star must have been watching a different movie.Okay, we have no acting.  Not bad acting, but no acting.  The characters could have just been making up the dialogue as they went along and it would have made zero difference.  There are no sets, just them running around in the woods beating each other up.  And here is the big one, there are NO EXCITING FIGHT SCENES.  I mean the people in the movie just kind of swing their arms and kick randomely.  There is no fight choreography and there are no stunts.  Me and my brothers could have made this movie.  The plot?  Who cares?  It doesn't make any sense anyway.Even the film quality is bad!  About a dozen times throughout the movie, the color would change.  It was as if they had two cameras that recorded with two different kinds of film.  I mean it's just god-awful.And it's a two disc special edition!  What in the world could they possibly have needed two discs for?

What happens is a woman drinks it and dies.  Another man had already drank it but the director does not exactly focus on that.  The voodoo doctor does not want them to tell on him so he kills them.  He can't kill one of them, I guess I will consider him the hero, but he does kill the guy who drank the potion.  So they kill this voodoo doctor and we fast forward 5 years.  All of a sudden without any explanation the guy who took the potion comes back invincible.  Now we just get weak fight after fight after fight.  This movie honestly looked like a home video recording.There is one very good fight scene.  It took me a couple minutes to recognize Tony Jaa but he is doing some sweet moves.  So he has by far the best part of the movie.  The ending I thought was one of the worst ending I could imagine, but for a home video, it was actually pretty good.  If you are looking for a movie with the same type of budget with some truly awesome action check out Legend of the Wolf.Also the picture quality is pretty bad but is probably not BCI Eclpipse's(Brentwood Home Video's) fault.  It is extremely low budget and the film stock changes hundreds of times from shot to shot.The special features are so so at best.  Half of it is just a bunch of clips from Rittikrai movies and man I hope this is not the best action Thailand could come up with back then.  There is some good Tony Jaa stuff but the only things I found interesting was the display he did at a movie showing and a demonstration of some awesome looking muay thai moves which is basically just a demostration by a couple of guys.2.5/5 for the movie2/5 for the special features",2,"This is not a good movie, but what do expect from a movie that they obviously didn't put any money into?",1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,1845,"['Tony', 'Jaa', 'movie', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'only', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'max.The', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'town', 'offer', 'potion', 'will', 'make', 'invincible', 'ageless', 'What', 'woman', 'man', 'had', 'already', 'drank', 'director', 'not', 'exactly', 'focus', 'voodoo', 'doctor', 'not', 'want', 'tell', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'one', 'guess', 'will', 'consider', 'hero', 'kill', 'guy', 'who', 'potion', 'kill', 'voodoo', 'doctor', 'fast', 'forward', '5', 'years', 'sudden', 'explanation', 'guy', 'who', 'took', 'potion', 'back', 'invincible', 'Now', 'just', 'get', 'weak', 'fight', 'fight', 'fight', 'movie', 'honestly', 'looked', 'home', 'video', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'fight', 'scene', 'took', 'couple', 'minutes', 'recognize', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'doing', 'sweet', 'moves', 'So', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'ending', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'ending', 'could', 'imagine', 'home', 'video', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'same', 'type', 'budget', 'truly', 'awesome', 'action', 'check', 'Legend', 'Wolf.Also', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'bad', 'probably', 'not', 'BCI', 'Eclpipse', 'Brentwood', 'Home', 'Video', 'fault', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'stock', 'changes', 'hundreds', 'times', 'shot', 'shot.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'so', 'so', 'best', 'Half', 'just', 'bunch', 'clips', 'Rittikrai', 'movies', 'man', 'hope', 'not', 'best', 'action', 'Thailand', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'back', 'then', 'good', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'stuff', 'only', 'things', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'display', 'did', 'movie', 'showing', 'demonstration', 'awesome', 'looking', 'muay', 'thai', 'moves', 'basically', 'just', 'demostration', 'couple', 'guys.2.5/5', 'movie2/5', 'special', 'features']",Spirited Killer
