It was the first show that made me care about anything scientific, with the exception of anything that blows up. It has been a decade, and I still have the urge to break out a box, stick a hole in it, then watch tv backwards and upside down. Beakman, the guy in a rat suit, and all envolved started an interest in science that has never left me. I learned inertia from Beakman two years before my early classmates. He has a flashy personna that grabs the attention of youngsters and adults alike. Buy Beakman's World, especially if you homeschool, or think your child is having trouble in this area. It's hard to find educational material that is so much fun.",5,Welcome to Beakmans World...,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,720,"['show', 'stayed', 'first', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'made', 'care', 'anything', 'scientific', 'exception', 'anything', 'up', 'been', 'decade', 'still', 'have', 'urge', 'break', 'out', 'box', 'stick', 'hole', 'then', 'watch', 'tv', 'backwards', 'upside', 'down', 'Beakman', 'guy', 'rat', 'suit', 'envolved', 'started', 'interest', 'science', 'never', 'left', 'learned', 'inertia', 'Beakman', 'two', 'years', 'early', 'classmates', 'flashy', 'personna', 'attention', 'youngsters', 'adults', 'alike', 'Buy', 'Beakman', 'World', 'especially', 'homeschool', 'think', 'child', 'having', 'trouble', 'area', 'hard', 'find', 'educational', 'material', 'so', 'much', 'fun']",The Best of Beakman's World VHS

This show is intended for kids but it was really amusing to me too. My son and I enjoyed many afternoon when the show was broadcasting alive. With simple format, funny characters and straight forward way to share knowledge this series were among the best to educate children and kids. This item is just a small extract from the best episodes from the show, even though it is a mandatory collector&#8217;s pick. Now other young kids in my family are having amusement with this still fresh show.

Has there ever been a program that made science and education more fun than this?  I can't imagine there has been.  Beakman is a not-so-mad scientist, who teaches scientific principles and facts, with fun, wit, and charm.  His &#34;lab rat&#34; Lester and assistant Josie (Alana Ubach, who since has made a career for herself in numerous roles) add to the fun.  I enjoyed this as a teen, and now my kids have an absolute blast learning about science with Beakman.  These episodes really hold up, and are just as good as they were 20 years ago  - they don't look that dated at all.  Paul Zaloom is fantastic as Beakman, and again, why this show never found a huge audience is a mystery to me.

I thought it was so funny and made science interesting and fun.  I learned a lot of ""tricks"" or rather cool experiments, in particular how to balance two forks on a toothpick!  The only thing that is wrong with the DVD is Josie isn't on it enough.  She was one of my favorite characters and I guess since this DVD isn't complete episodes, the scenes she appears in weren't included as much.  Also, the only other bad thing is, it isn't long enough!  Only 60 minutes!  I am certainly grateful as it has been many years since I have seen the show on TV.  But really, it is just a teaser.  They need to put the entire series on DVD!At any rate, it is a good starter for anyone who has not seen the show, or who hasn't seen it in a long time and remembers it!  I would definitely recommend it for kids and adults, whether they like science or not.  I never really liked science, but this show just made it so fun!  The show is very cleverly written and the acting is great.  It was obviously made by talented and intelligent people with a sense of humor, sometimes weird, but always funny!  What more can I say?
