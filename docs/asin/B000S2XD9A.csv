But in ""Jonathan Creek: Season Two,"" he discovers that you can become a lot more famous just by solving mysteries -- and the mysteries are as baffling and bizarre as ever, just as Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin have the same sparking chemistry.A vicar arrives on Maddy's doorstep, with suitably bizarre and baffling case -- his mother-in-law, a well-known horror writer (think a much, MUCH schlockier Dean Koontz), was shot dead on Halloween night. The costumed murderer also carried off the vicar's wife as a hostage... but after being chased into a garage by the police, he vanished without a trace.Then in ""Time Waits for Norman,"" Maddy's editor asks Jonathan to figure out how her husband could have been on both sides of the Atlantic, with witnesses and evidence on both sides. In ""The Scented Room,"" an El Greco painting vanishes from a small room... which is surrounded by schoolgirls on a field trip. Jonathan knows how it was done, but he also has a grudge against the owner.In ""Mother Redcap,"" a judge is found stabbed in the heart despite his police guards, and Maddy and Jonathan soon learn that it's connected to an infamous inn where seven men died mysteriously. And finally, there's a ""Problem at Gallows Gate"" when Adam's sister spots a man strangling a young woman... and the problem is that that man committed suicide in front of witnesses a month ago!One major change that has taken place in ""Jonathan Creek Season Two"" is that Jonathan and Maddy are now minor celebrities, to the point where Maddy's editor starts designing sexy new covers of the two of them. But the main thrust of the series -- Jonathan solving bizarre and impossible crimes -- is still very much the same.And the writers maintain the right combination of whodunnit and quirky Brit-drama, with subplots like Adam being blackmailed by a stripper with a fondness for Verdi. The dialogue is snappy and fun (""Didn't you get suspicious when you were running your fingers through her hair and she wasn't even in the room?""), but there are also some heartrending moments, like the revelation of who killed the horror writer.Davies and Quentin are still sparkling as the eccentric Jonathan and the firecracker Maddie. They have plenty of fun banter and romantic tension, but they seem to have settled into a more comfortable groove with each other. And watch out for Peter Davison as a sweet, confused vicar in the first episode.""Jonathan Creek Season Two"" is more of the same -- more quirky problems, more brain-bending solutions, and more magic.",4,You're making the big mistake of sticking to what's likely rather than what's logical,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2633,"['Nobody', 'knew', 'much', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'anonymous', 'brain', 'clever', 'magic', 'tricks', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Season', 'Two', 'can', 'become', 'lot', 'more', 'famous', 'just', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'mysteries', 'are', 'baffling', 'bizarre', 'ever', 'just', 'Alan', 'Davies', 'Caroline', 'Quentin', 'have', 'same', 'sparking', 'chemistry.A', 'vicar', 'Maddy', 'doorstep', 'suitably', 'bizarre', 'baffling', 'case', 'mother-in-law', 'well-known', 'horror', 'writer', 'think', 'much', 'MUCH', 'schlockier', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', 'Halloween', 'night', 'costumed', 'murderer', 'also', 'carried', 'vicar', 'wife', 'hostage', 'being', 'chased', 'garage', 'police', 'vanished', 'trace.Then', 'Time', 'Waits', 'Norman', 'Maddy', 'editor', 'Jonathan', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'husband', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'witnesses', 'evidence', 'sides', 'Scented', 'Room', 'El', 'Greco', 'painting', 'vanishes', 'small', 'room', 'surrounded', 'schoolgirls', 'field', 'trip', 'Jonathan', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'also', 'grudge', 'owner.In', 'Mother', 'Redcap', 'judge', 'found', 'stabbed', 'heart', 'police', 'guards', 'Maddy', 'Jonathan', 'soon', 'learn', 'connected', 'infamous', 'inn', 'where', 'seven', 'men', 'died', 'mysteriously', 'finally', 'Problem', 'Gallows', 'Gate', 'when', 'Adam', 'sister', 'spots', 'man', 'strangling', 'young', 'woman', 'problem', 'man', 'committed', 'suicide', 'front', 'witnesses', 'month', 'ago', 'One', 'major', 'change', 'taken', 'place', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Season', 'Two', 'Jonathan', 'Maddy', 'are', 'now', 'minor', 'celebrities', 'point', 'where', 'Maddy', 'editor', 'designing', 'sexy', 'new', 'covers', 'two', 'main', 'thrust', 'series', 'Jonathan', 'solving', 'bizarre', 'impossible', 'crimes', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'same.And', 'writers', 'maintain', 'right', 'combination', 'whodunnit', 'quirky', 'Brit-drama', 'subplots', 'Adam', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'stripper', 'fondness', 'Verdi', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'fun', 'Did', ""n't"", 'get', 'suspicious', 'when', 'were', 'running', 'fingers', 'hair', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'room', 'are', 'also', 'heartrending', 'moments', 'revelation', 'who', 'killed', 'horror', 'writer.Davies', 'Quentin', 'are', 'still', 'sparkling', 'eccentric', 'Jonathan', 'firecracker', 'Maddie', 'have', 'plenty', 'fun', 'banter', 'romantic', 'tension', 'seem', 'have', 'settled', 'more', 'comfortable', 'groove', 'other', 'watch', 'out', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'sweet', 'confused', 'vicar', 'first', 'episode', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Season', 'Two', 'more', 'same', 'more', 'quirky', 'problems', 'more', 'brain-bending', 'solutions', 'more', 'magic']",N/A

1085122,A4FX5YCJA630V,B000S2XD9A,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","My favourite season of my favourite show! There are plenty of episodes that come before and after the second season of ""Jonathan Creek"", but in my opinion, this is the very best that writer/creator David Renwick has to offer. The mysteries are intricate, the banter is hilarious, the pacing is perfect, and our crime-fighting duo is at the top of their game.Introverted Jonathan Creek (Alan Davis) and go-getter Madeline Magellan (Caroline Quentin) are an unlikely pair, but it's the combination of their skills that makes them so successful as amateur detectives. Jonathan is a lateral thinker who designs illusions for a stage magician, and Maddy has the ""gift of the gab"" that gets them embroiled in all sorts of police investigations.Containing five mysteries across six episodes (one is split into two parts), ""Jonathan Creek"" has everything you'd ever want from a television show: wonderful banter and chemistry between its two leads, intricate puzzle-box plotting in regards to the mysteries it presents, and the occasional hilarious subplot revolving around Jonathan's egotistical boss Adam Klaus.Perhaps the season's weakest episode is its opener, ""Danse Macabre"" in which a priest appeals to Maddy for a solution to the murder of his mother-in-law, popular Gothic novelist Emma Lazarus. After returning home from a Halloween party, she was shot in her bedroom and the priest's wife taken hostage. But after retreating into the stone garage, the killer (clad in a skeleton costume) seems to have disappeared into thin air.Jonathan manages to solve the case without even visiting the crime-scene (much to Maddy's frustration), and I'll admit that this is one of the very few mysteries that I've been able to solve myself. Thankfully things crank into high-gear with the next episode:""Times Waits for Norman"" is a play on the old adage ""time waits for no man,"" which is a fitting title for a mystery about a man who is temporophobic (that is, someone with a phobia of time passing). And yet somehow Norman Stangerson seems to have found a way to cheat the laws of space and time. While he was supposedly in New York on a business meeting, a waiter at a burger-place in London swears that he was there only a day earlier - and he's got Norman's lost wallet to prove it. Yet Norman's business partners in New York are just as adamant that he was with them.Norman's wife reaches out for help, but Maddy can't seem to make the opposing stories corroborate. The New Yorkers all swear that Norman was with them, yet photographs emerge of him in London only a few hours later. How can both stories be true? Jonathan seems to think a cryptic message hidden in Norman's wallet might be the key to the mystery.In ""The Scented Room"" a priceless portrait vanishes from the home of wealthy Sylvester Le Flay in a seemingly impossible manner. Just a few seconds after a group of school girls leave the room where it's on display, the door opens to reveal its disappearance. Maddy is entranced by the promise of a hefty reward to anyone who can retrieve the painting, but Jonathan is enjoying the sight of Sylvester Le Flay (a critic who once gave his magic show a scathing review) squirm. According to him, he knows exactly where the painting is - he's just not going to say where.""Murder at Gallows Gate"" is a two-part episode that combines a visit from Adam's interfering sister Kitty with the murder of the beautiful Felicity Veil. On orders from Adam to get Kitty out of the house for the night, Jonathan takes her on a badger watch where (while out looking for a public toilet) she sees a man strangling a woman in the window of a cottage. Maddy and Jonathan investigate, but it's only when Kitty identifies the man that things get really strange: he was Duncan Proctor, Felicity's ex-boyfriend who killed himself over a week ago.Has someone managed to effectively impersonate a dead man? Or did Duncan Proctor somehow fake his suicidal fall so that he might get away with murdering his ex-girlfriend? And if so, why did he leave his fingerprints all over the house? And why take Felicity's boots off before leaving her in the bathroom? Jonathan knows he's missing some crucial clue, but it takes an off-handed comment from Maddy to figure out what.And finally ""Mother Redcap"". This is it: not only the best ""Jonathan Creek"" episode you'll ever see, but one of the best forty-minutes of television ever. I'm serious. Everything about it is practically perfect: the mystery, the pacing, the comedy, the resolution - everything.A criminal gang promises that Judge Sweetland will be dead by morning - and sure enough, despite a house full of police protection, he's found dead on the floor the following day. How is a mystery since the door was guarded and the window bolted, and the only other person in the room was his devoted wife. Even stranger, Jonathan thinks it all has something to do with a mysterious pub known as the Mother Redcap, infamous for a series of deaths in the 19th century in which several grown men were apparently frightened to death after looking out of a window.Maddy is bewildered as to how or why the two crimes might be connected, but between their terrible dates (Maddy with a nudist, Jonathan to a cop who sticks her tongue before she eats anything) they realize how solving one mystery will make the other clear.I really can't say enough about the intricacy of David Renwick's plotting. Every plot-thread, every tiny detail, has set-up and pay-off, whether it ends in a joke or the resolution of the mystery. Jonathan and Maddy's banter is hilarious, their chemistry is wonderful, and every episode demands a rewatch just to make sure you caught all the clues strewn throughout. I've lent my DVD box set to countless friends, and they've all loved it. I would recommend to pretty much anyone.",5,"""What Level of Surrealism are we Operating on Here?""",1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,5820,"['favourite', 'season', 'favourite', 'show', 'are', 'plenty',
