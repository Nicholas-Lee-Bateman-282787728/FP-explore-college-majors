924929,A2Z4B0VALQL9CC,B000AA4KLA,Cheese Steak Jimmy,"[5, 5]","In 2005, the Ultimate Fighting Championship was in a sorry state. Sold off by SEG due to collapsing pay-per-view revenues, the new owners Zuffa [fronted by controversial president Dana White] were struggling, and ended up fronting ten million of their own money to produce this show for US Cable channel, Spike TV. The rest, as they say, ishistory, and [aided by a monster of a fight betweenForrestGriffinand Stephan Bonnar towards the end of the show], turned MMA into the fastest growing sport since NASCAR.So this is the show that saved mainstream MMA, and it really is car-crash television of the finest vintage, a sort of cross between Big Brother and Fight Club, with contestants alternating between alpha-male scenery chewing, trash-talking, whinging, crying, and fighting in the octagon. Into the house enter a variety of fighters of varying proficiency and stamina, and stand-out characters include the requisite nutters [yoga-practicing borderline-psychotic Diego Sanchez; emotional wreck and general stirrer Chris Leben; the smug Josh Koscheck; the charming but loopy Forrest Griffin, a man who goes the entire season sporting a nasty compound fracture in his forearm that juts out under his skin], through the most laid-back cage fighter of all time [Stephan Bonnar], a few whingers [mainly Bobby Southworth: a moan and a bully] and on to the cannon fodder who look like deer in headlights [most predominantly Jason Thacker, a man who permanently looks like he's about to have his lunch money stolen from him, and is solely famous for having his bed 'spritzed' by another contestant].The format of the show isn't perfect- weirdly, a recurrent theme is dividing up the fighters into two teams, presumably to encourage tribal loyalty [and therefore conflict for the cameras], but one that doesn't make a lot of sense when one team loses a lot of fighters over successive weeks, and so is given fighters from the other team. In addition, it's a few episodes before anyone actually fights, as the first few eliminations are via team challenges [in retrospect, the weaker individuals who are punted would have been pummelled by their peers in the octagon, and so perhaps there was an element of logic to this approach]. I'm also a little suspicious of the editing, as [like MTV's 'The Real World'], it's heavily tweaked to construct a narrative, and I'm still in two minds as to whether or not one contestant was the thief that the show made him out to be [I would say probably, but I still have my nagging doubts]. Finally, given the substantial injury rate of this sport, there is a high turn-over of individuals who are put out the show but then return when other contestants are injured.These points are quibbles: this is a show that gets its hooks in, and due to the unpredictable nature of the bouts [a stray hook, knee, or elbow can end a fight that had been going heavily in favour of the other contestant], doesn't let go. It has a soap opera cast, some blistering fights, and is 'high stakes' for all the players involved.

924936,A1VCPMT1RRS7K0,B000AA4KLA,Matt,"[0, 0]","I had never before followed a reality TV show.  I actually prided myself on never having seen an episode of Survivor or Big Brother - or even American Idol.  Just not into it.The Ultimate Fighter is more of a behind-the-scenes look than it is a reality show.  It's obviously glitzed up a bit with the challenges and eliminations and all, but it essentially follows these 16 fighters on their potential road to the UFC.  This is in a completely different category than the fluff reality shows being fed to the public over the past few years.  This is something interesting - providing a glimpse into a world most people will never see.The powers that be at the UFC chose quite a crew for this show.  Right off the bat, you get a feel for who you are going to love (Forrest Griffin, Stephan Bonner, Nate Quarry, Kenny Florian) and who you are going to hate (Josh Koschek, Bobby Southworth, etc...) along the path.  Just like with any group thrown into the mix together, there will be conflict.  Yet there is less than most people would probably expect.  I mean, these are fighters and they come into less conflict than the foolish college students on shows like The Real World.  Their experiences are interesting, as are their interactions with one another.This is simply an amazing show.  Good drama, good fights, great insight into the UFC and a legendary battle in the live season finale event.  A mixed martial arts fan has to appreciate the closer look we get at Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell in their coaching capacity.  They are both great coaches and very likeable characters in general.  Randy Couture stood out to me, though, as someone who wholly personifies the sport.  Along with being one of the most accomplished mixed martial artists in history, he is simply all that the sport is supposed to be about each time you see him.  I was truly impressed with him on this show.For a fan of MMA, this is an exciting glimpse into the UFC - the biggest platform there is for the sport.  This show helped to catapult the sport into the spotlight and it is now getting its due recognition.  I wish the best for our ""Ultimate Fighters"" in the UFC and look forward, with great anticipation, to seeing them fight...",5,Ultimate Fighting hits primetime,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,2216,"['had', 'never', 'before', 'followed', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'actually', 'prided', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'episode', 'Survivor', 'Big', 'Brother', 'even', 'American', 'Idol', 'Just', 'not', 'it.The', 'Ultimate', 'Fighter', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'reality', 'show', 'obviously', 'glitzed', 'up', 'bit', 'challenges', 'eliminations', 'essentially', '16', 'fighters', 'potential', 'road', 'UFC', 'completely', 'different', 'category', 'fluff', 'reality', 'being', 'fed', 'public', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'something', 'interesting', 'providing', 'glimpse', 'world', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'see.The', 'powers', 'be', 'UFC', 'chose', 'quite', 'crew', 'show', 'Right', 'bat', 'get', 'feel', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'Forrest', 'Griffin', 'Stephan', 'Bonner', 'Nate', 'Quarry', 'Kenny', 'Florian', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'Josh', 'Koschek', 'Bobby', 'Southworth', 'etc', 'path', 'Just', 'group', 'thrown', 'mix', 'together', 'will', 'be', 'conflict', 'less', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'expect', 'mean', 'are', 'fighters', 'come', 'less', 'conflict', 'foolish', 'college', 'students', 'shows', 'Real', 'World', 'experiences', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'interactions', 'one', 'another.This', 'simply', 'amazing', 'show', 'Good', 'drama', 'good', 'fights', 'great', 'insight', 'UFC', 'legendary', 'battle', 'live', 'season', 'finale', 'event', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'fan', 'appreciate', 'closer', 'look', 'get', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Chuck', 'Liddell', 'coaching', 'capacity', 'are', 'great', 'coaches', 'very', 'likeable', 'characters', 'general', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'stood', 'out', 'though', 'someone', 'who', 'wholly', 'sport', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artists', 'history', 'simply', 'sport', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'see', 'was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'show.For', 'fan', 'MMA', 'exciting', 'glimpse', 'UFC', 'biggest', 'platform', 'sport', 'show', 'helped', 'catapult', 'sport', 'spotlight', 'now', 'getting', 'due', 'recognition', 'wish', 'best', 'Ultimate', 'Fighters', 'UFC', 'look', 'forward', 'great', 'anticipation', 'seeing', 'fight']",UFC Presents The Ultimate Fighter - Season 1

This series has it all, from cast backstories worked into the show, mostly exciting fights, great finale, and stellar bonuses on the extras disc.It was painfully obvious that the producers were still trying to work out the perfect formula/format for an elimination/fighting-type tv show because sometimes they reversed rules, questioned decisions, and had lop-sided teams often needing to trade fighters.Other than that, you really got to know the contestants, coaches, trainers, and the sport of mixed martial arts!

924939,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B000AA4KLA,R.A. McKenzie,"[31, 32]","NOTE - This is reviewing the show only, as I have yet to see the Extra Features.REVIEWNow this is what reality television was meant to be.  First off, the focus on what the show is about is dead-on.  Sixteen men, who actually qualify to be here, are brought to train with and against each other in hopes of becoming a UFC fighter.  The challenges, in which the winners gain the strategic advantage, are fun to watch and result in some good fights.  The fights themselves would be worth the DVD alone, especially if they include the legendary Light-Heavyweight bout that finished the show (best of UFC ever!).But with the fights come good drama, and none of it feels forced.  You see, you will learn to love the competitors.  You will appreciate the religion of Diego Sanchez, the cool style of Forrest Griffin, and the intelligence of Nathan Quarry.  You will also meet some unpleasant fighters like the cocky Josh Koshcheck, the bitter Bobby Southworth, and the troubled Chris Leben.  The important thing to note, though, is that even the semi-annoying fighters in the big house aren't unreasonably annoying.  With their attitudes comes real emotions and skills that few of us possess.  These men are not caricatures, but a magnificent study of how the imbalances of egos and skills clash both in and out of that intimidating octagonal arena.The coaches are Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell (who fought 1 week after the show's finale), who are strong, wise, approachable, and skilled mixed-martial-artists.  Both of these guys bring different but equally effective styles of coaching.  Also present is UFC president Dana White.  This guy is not executive hogwash.  No, this man is not afraid to come down hard on the fighters, and speak bluntly about the 16 guys competing for those contracts.  The only problem is that he doesn a little too much commentating with his interviews, but he is insightful and very smart.What might the unintiated not like about this DVD collection?Well, this is a show about fighting.  If you don't really dig boxing or wrestling, then perhaps this isn't for you.  It is a lot easier for me to recommend this First Season as a UFC fan, and martial-arts learner.  But this show isn't about violence.  The 16 fighters, the coaches, and Dana White all make it clear that UFC fighting is a job with no room for uncertainty.  Professional fighting requires calculation, strategy, hard work, mental/emotional stability, and physical conditioning.  I watched this entire season with a friend of mine who hates fighting, but she still grew to appreciate what these men do for a living, and loved that the unfit challengers didn't stick around very long.This show exemplifies the perfect balance for reality TV.  It's a competition, but it isn't too focused on being a game show.  It's got lots of interviews and fighter-feedback, but is not too interested in the secret alliances or betrayals that have foreshadowed and ruined countless reality TV shows.  The fights are good, but there is even intercut opinions to explain why the fighters did what they did in that ring, and why they were or were not smart with their game plan.  The crew of this show took the time to edit enough so that fight-fans and martial artists could understand the terms and didn't get bored, and also enough so that newcomers didn't feel confused.  I've always liked the UFC, but now I love it.  This show has propelled the Ultimate Fighting Championship to new heights, and has rightfully earned its reputation.  I'm not fond of reality TV that much (except for WWE's Tough Enough 1 and 2...see a connection here?), but ""Ultimate Fighter"" is an outstanding work of television, and has been followed by a good second season worthy of the franchise.  This crew knows what its doing.  I'll even go so far as to say that any fan of TV in general should check this DVD-set out.  You want originality, emotional depth, hard-hitting competition, and non-censored television...you can have it all in one package!
