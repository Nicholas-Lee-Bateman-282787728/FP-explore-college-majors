The CGI in this movie is a joke. nearly every action scene features digitally rendered versions of the actors and it's not very high quality looking at all. The acting (or maybe it was the script?) was also equally laughable. Channing Tatum can't act to save his life! And that chick that played the Baroness? What the crap? She was pretty, but not pretty or exotic enough to convincingly play a character like that. When she first stepped off the enemy plane at the beginning of the movie, I almost laughed. She had on this low cut black top with these cheap looking sequins sewn around the neck line. I didn't really know what to make of that; it looked like some Kmart club outfit, certainly not something one would wear to kick butt. Dennis Quaid was equally horrific playing the big man in control of the GI Joe team. Nearly one handed, he really upped the cartoon quality on the movie. The role was completely ill suited for him. I sat all the way through it, but I would never do it again. And a sequel? Fuhgeddaboutit!! The Blu-ray quality is extremely nice with a robust soundtrack and perfectly pleasant picture, but it's hard to improve on what you're seeing and hearing when that's the way it was written and acted.

Good guys include General with a heart of gold, hunky lead, comic relief sidekick, hot chick number 2, martial arts expert number 2, computer hacker and dependable strong arm guy.4. The plot obviously involves good guys trying to stop bad guys from unleashing havoc and mass destruction yada yada yada, amidst a maze of flashbacks and little snippets of snappy dialogue.5. Massive CGI and action extravaganza follows, including, but not limited to, easily accessible underground fortresses, a little cat fight, awesome weaponry, cool super-suits, planes, trains and automobiles, space age submarines, altered henchmen, a polar bear and the amazing sinking polar ice-cap.This movie may be totally inaccurate and impossible, but you can't fault the in-your-face non-stop action for light summer movie fare.

When you say GI Joe to me, I think of the action toy GI Joe with his circa WWII Jeep and uniform. I seem to have slept thru all of the various modernizations of GI Joe including the comic book, cartoon movies and newer toys. So, going into this movie, I had no expectatoins of what it would be. So, I've learned that the action toy has morphed into an elite military unit with sci-fi special weapons and tools. Only the elite become GI Joe's (men and women) who work out of ""The Pit"". This movie was very well made. Action from the first minutes to introduce the team during a firefight to protect a truck convoy. Next we find the hero of protecting that convoy is taken to the Pit and introduced to the team; after traning he becomes a GI Joe. The bulk of the movie was focused on the recovery of the item taken from that truck convoy and learning who was behnd the plot. Some good twists and unexpected things. Great action, wow sets and special effects that were seamless, the characters were a bit flat and 2-D hence the 4 stars. Oh, did I mention great action (yes, I did). This is a fun movie to watch and is worth a couple of bags of popcorn to enjoy. I do recommnd it. The blu-ray had sufficient behind-the-scenes contents on a second disk in the set, however, that disk and materials were on SD on a DVD; too bad, no HD extra contents.

Joe thanks to botching up supervising the delivery of nano-mite war-heads on behalf of the US Army, they join the team to try and track the war-heads down before they're unleashed on the world. To make things even more difficult for Duke, his ex-girlfriend, Anastasia ""Ana"" DeCobray (Sienna Miller), also the ""Baroness,"" is part of the team responsible for stealing the nano-mite war-heads, and he is torn between trying to figure out what happened to her and also doing the right thing not just for his country, but for the whole world.Yet Duke and Ana aren't the only ones with a past. Opposing ninja warriors Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) go back to when they were children and trained under the same sensei. It wasn't until a tragic event in their youth drove the two apart, only to meet now, years later, and settle their conflict once and for all.With only the safety of the world resting in the hands of the best of the best of the best, team G.I. Joe has their work cut out for them as they try to save the world from the rising C.O.B.R.A.This movie is lightning. Seriously. Right from the first minute straight through to the last this sucker moves at breakneck speed with non-stop action, fireballs, lasers, bullets, super-powered armor, kung-fu, car chases, car crashes, aerial battles and a whole ton more.It's been awhile since I've seen a movie where I felt like I was moving at the speed of light and G.I. Joe delivers that in spades. I went in expecting an action movie. I got it. I went in expecting a military movie. I didn't get that but instead got something between the Avengers, Desert Storm and James Bond. It didn't feel like an army movie and for that I was thankful because, though I like history and military fiction, I have a hard time watching army movies. Don't know why. Just can't get into them. Also, all that olive green is nauseating after a while. Thank goodness that stupid color is absent in G.I. Joe. They wear black, thank you very much.The overall plot was cool. The problem was the pace. It was just way too fast. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the flashback sequences throughout the movie and even the fact the movie starts off in 1641 instead of the present day. More specifically, I was impressed the flashback sequences didn't happen to just one character, but to several, each segment adding to that character's history and giving us something more than a man or woman with an agenda. We actually get to understand their motivations because we get to be there with them and see how they came to be what they came to be.There was something else I had a hard time buying, but I'll leave it there because I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet.In the end, this film delivered a lot and truly embodied the idea of ""rise of the cobra."" There was origins galore, the ones not mentioned above being Destro and the Doctor. There will no doubt be a sequel because there's obviously way more story to tell.Rating this film was tough because there's no way to be critical of it without coming off unfair. I mean, really, the effects were 5 out of 5. No challenge there.

1280436,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B002NXSRVG,AverageReviewer,"[2, 4]","Ok, first of all I loved the look of this movie and the idea of GI Joe.  Having grown up watching the cartoons and playing with the toys, I have to say that this and transformers were the two most anticipated movies of the year for me....although in the end bothAngels & Demons (Two-Disc Extended Edition)andStar Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)stole the year for me.From an adult's perspective, I'll tell you why:- Transformers 2 was a big giant advertisement for the US Armed Forces (every war machine in the US arsenal was featured)- GI Joe was a big giant advertisement for the United Nations (very eerie)I can understand Hasbro's dilema, GI Joe was marketed in the US but it was also sold in the UK, Germany, France etc so they had to give it a more worldly treatment.  There were rumors the Joes would be HQed in Belgium (big no no from my side) and in the end they wind up being based somewhere in Africa.  With technology available today, I think they could've easily done 5 movies with the Joe's HQed in whatever country the movie was released in (why not?).The other thing that detracted from the Joes for me was that the action sequences were eeriely similar to the Transformers scenes. In one scene the Joes are running down some street and they have this slow motion leap where they're dodging bullets and debris.  I swear that was the same scene from Transformers where the Transformers do the exact same contorted leaks (did they just replace transformers for Joes and use the same CGI rendering code?)  I wonder.So at the end of the day, I have to say that the movie breaks down as follows for me:PROS- great special effects (on par with Transformers, feels like they used the same CGI artists)- Dennis Quaid (I'm a big fan)- fast paced story- cool special effects (worth saying twice)CONS- embedded political ideologies- shallow character development (except for the ninjas - that was good)Agewise:- if you're between 10 and 18 this movie is probably just great- if you grew up with GI Joe, you'll probably enjoy but you'll likely see the politicsOverall, I enjoyed the GI Joe Movie but I had a real hard time getting beyond the political propaganda being peddled.  In the end for a grown guy like me, Star Trek and Angels and Demons were more entertaining but hey, I'm an old guy.  If you're young, probably transformers and GI Joe were where it's at....but definitely give Star Trek a try.At the end of the day Star Trek was the best movie of the year, albeit it has its own set of political ideologies embedded in it.",5,Beautifully Subtle Propaganda,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,2541,"['Ok', 'first', 'loved', 'look', 'movie', 'idea', 'GI', 'Joe', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'playing', 'toys', 'have', 'say', 'transformers', 'were', 'two', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'year', '.although', 'end', 'bothAngels', 'Demons', 'Two-Disc', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'andStar', 'Trek', 'Two-Disc', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'Edition', 'stole', 'year', 'me.From', 'adult', 'perspective', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'Transformers', '2', 'was', 'big', 'giant', 'advertisement', 'US', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'war', 'machine', 'US', 'arsenal', 'was', 'featured', 'GI', 'Joe', 'was', 'big', 'giant', 'advertisement', 'United', 'Nations', 'very', 'eerie', 'can', 'understand', 'Hasbro', 'dilema', 'GI', 'Joe', 'was', 'marketed', 'US', 'was', 'also', 'sold', 'UK', 'Germany', 'France', 'etc', 'so', 'had', 'give', 'more', 'worldly', 'treatment', 'were', 'rumors', 'Joes', 'would', 'be', 'HQed', 'Belgium', 'big', 'no', 'side', 'end', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'based', 'somewhere', 'Africa', 'technology', 'available', 'today', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'done', '5', 'movies', 'Joe', 'HQed', 'country', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'why', 'not', 'other', 'thing', 'detracted', 'Joes', 'was', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'eeriely', 'similar', 'Transformers', 'scenes', 'one', 'scene', 'Joes', 'are', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'have', 'slow', 'motion', 'leap', 'where', ""'re"", 'dodging', 'bullets', 'debris', 'swear', 'was', 'same', 'scene', 'Transformers', 'where', 'Transformers', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'contorted', 'leaks', 'did', 'just', 'replace', 'transformers', 'Joes', 'use', 'same', 'CGI', 'rendering', 'code', 'wonder.So', 'end', 'day', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'down', 'as', 'PROS-', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'par', 'Transformers', 'feels', 'used', 'same', 'CGI', 'artists', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'fast', 'paced', 'story-', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'saying', 'twice', 'CONS-', 'embedded', 'political', 'ideologies-', 'shallow', 'character', 'development', 'ninjas', 'was', 'good', 'Agewise', ""'re"", '10', '18', 'movie', 'probably', 'just', 'great-', 'grew', 'up', 'GI', 'Joe', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'see', 'politicsOverall', 'enjoyed', 'GI', 'Joe', 'Movie', 'had', 'real', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'political', 'propaganda', 'being', 'peddled', 'end', 'grown', 'guy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'were', 'more', 'entertaining', 'hey', ""'m"", 'old', 'guy', ""'re"", 'young', 'probably', 'transformers', 'GI', 'Joe', 'were', 'where', '.but', 'definitely', 'give', 'Star', 'Trek', 'try.At', 'end', 'day', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'own', 'set', 'political', 'ideologies', 'embedded']",N/A

It looked like a teenage boy thing--which is what I suppose GI JOE is supposed to be--plus throw in stuff for us old timers that actually saw the cartoons and read the comics back in the day.The movie thankfully keeps itself PG-13 where it should be and just has fun. There are a ton of characters in it and so the scripting is actually pretty good considering. There are lots of connections here--like, why are they blasting through Paris? Well, it was the French that made Destro, and his decendent wanted revenge. The little and the big are all wrapped up neatly. Throw in unexpected fun moments like Bendan Fraser as a JOE, some great lines (""Nice shoes.""), and a great character triangle with Duke, the Baroness and Cobra Commander, and as a whole the movie just works. This is a good, solid update to the franchise.Why did I give it a chance? Well, I saw the preview for the next GI JOE movie--and it's supposed to have Bruce Willis as the original JOE.

Joe when I was a kid, had a whole backpack full of the little guys that I carried around with me. I figured they would mess up this one like Transformers did for me.... (Bubble Bee is a Volkswagen Bug!... That's why they call him Bubble Bee.... He's a Bug! He's the little guy!) but anyways...If you were a huge fan of the cartoon, then you will probably hate this movie. They butchered the back stories of each character pretty bad. Snake Eye's and Storm Shadow's story is really awkward. It has elements of their orginal story, but still seems to mess it up.  (And that's why it loses a star) I will never understand why they can't leave characters alone in films, why must they always change them somehow?  (Cobra Commander looks like some deformed power ranger at the end of the movie)Sorry G.I. Joe diehards. They let you down.But with all that aside, I just really enjoyed the film. I had fun watching it. Sure there are some really hard to believe parts and some really corny parts, but I just got into that Saturday morning cartoon mode.

1280439,A1JXE27STRRE0H,B002NXSRVG,"Beardyjin ""beardyjin""","[0, 2]","To be fair, I've two conflicting viewpoints on this film. One is that of the adult filmgoer who's seen more than his fair share of cinema and can look at this film as nothing more than another summer action film. The other viewpoint is that of the nine-year-old boy who had a room full of G.I. Joe toys and watched the cartoon show everyday after school back in the 80s. I'll give reviews for both viewpoints.*For the non-Joe fans:If you're not a fan or have no prior knowledge of the 1980s G.I. Joe franchise, chances are this is a movie you can skip in the theaters. A few great action sequences aside, it'll likely be a film that has more cons than pros for you.  If you're going into this film for just a straight up good action flick you'll likely be disappointed with the horrible acting, spastic editing, overly clich&eacute;d moments, and mediocre directing. A ""C"" grade (2  star) film at best.*For the Joe Fans:As a longtime fan I walked out of G.I. Joe feeling like the film had some really great parts, but as a whole it didn't reach its potential. The main element that turned me off as a long time Joe fan was the way Storm Shadow & Snake Eyes were handled. They had what I'm sure were pretty spectacular sword fights, but I couldn't tell because of all the ridiculous close ups and jump cuts! Plus the two brief flashbacks handling their history together were just plain awful.Surprisingly the Baroness character turned out to be the most interesting part of the film. She was a much more fully realized character than her animated counterpart and she was perhaps the most sympathetic and well rounded character in the entire film. I thought the plot of the film was actually pretty good. They made a really plausible prequel for the 80s cartoon show. Well, as plausible as one can get for an 80s cartoon show. As the title implies, this film is all about how Cobra is formed. And it does a fairly decent job of explaining why so many capable people followed the weak and almost inept leader of Cobra in the cartoon show as well as how the iconic characters of Destro, Zartan, Baroness, Storm Shadow, Dr. Mindbender, and Cobra Commander all came together. Also for fanboys wondering about the absent Cobra logo, towards the very end of the film we get a brief underwater glimpse of it.Speaking of the ending, this will likely be a BIG controversy for Joe fans and geeks in general. I won't go into spoiler territory here, but I will say it's basically a combination of the endings of Star Wars Episodes I & IV. No, seriously. My friends and I were having a blast pointing out all the ""lifted"" shots and similar moments between the films. Personally I thought it was fun and meant to be kind of obvious (because it really is obvious), a geeky bit of cross-pollinating cinema if you will.

I remember G.I Joe from when I was young, and yes there are alot of discrepancies when compared to the cartoon, but the formula that the producers and writers used in this movie worked. Excellent story and nice twists. The acting was a little bland. Channing Tatum's performace here was very sub par. To me he just did not seem to be into it like the other characters were. Marlon Wayans' role suprised me. I'm used to seeing him in goofy humor roles, but he did very well in this film. Special effects were awesome too. Very impressive.

I was afraid not having been a fan I would not be able to follow what was going on, however this is more of an origin film and they do a great job of walking noobs like me through it. I had a blast watching this movie from start to finish, and this movie had some of the coolest action sequences I've seen this year.Here is a brief plot synopsis, the movie takes place in the not too distant future where weapons expert James McCullen played by Christopher Eccleston has created a weapon that uses nanotechnology to basically eat through anything including whole cities. He sells four of these warheads to NATO, and Duke played by Channing Tatum and Ripcord played by Marlon Wayans are soldiers in the U.S. army  and are tasked with delivering the warheads. During the mission the pair are ambushed by the Baroness played by Sienna Miller, however they are saved by Scarlett played by Rachel Nichols, Snake Eyes played by Ray Park, and Heavy Duty played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje  members of a secret black ops group known as the Joes.They are then taken back to The Pit the Joe's command center in North Africa. Here Duke, and Ripcord convince General Hawk played by Dennis Quaid to let them join the team for this mission as they know the Baroness personally from the past.The rest of the movie is a battle between the Joes and the double crosser James McCullen and his group of genetically altered soldiers over these warheads. There are some amazing fights in this movie I especially like the scenes with Sanke Eyes who's like some kind of super ninja and his rival Storm Shadow played by Lee Byung-hun. The whole car chase scene in France was amazing as well. This movie definitely snuck up on my top five movies of the year list, I'm going to give it a 4 out of 5 and would definitely recommend seeing it on the big sreen, to anyone who likes a good action flick.",4,"Never watched cartoon, but like this for what it is",1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2139,"['never', 'watched', 'cartoon', 'child', 'collected', 'dolls/toys', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'movie', 'up', 'compared', 'past', 'works', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'afraid', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'fan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'however', 'more', 'origin', 'film', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'walking', 'noobs', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'had', 'coolest', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'brief', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'place', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'where', 'weapons', 'expert', 'James', 'McCullen', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'created', 'weapon', 'nanotechnology', 'basically', 'eat', 'anything', 'including', 'whole', 'cities', 'four', 'warheads', 'NATO', 'Duke', 'played', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Ripcord', 'played', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'are', 'soldiers', 'U.S.', 'army', 'are', 'tasked', 'delivering', 'warheads', 'mission', 'pair', 'are', 'ambushed', 'Baroness', 'played', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'however', 'are', 'saved', 'Scarlett', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'played', 'Ray', 'Park', 'Heavy', 'Duty', 'played', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'members', 'secret', 'black', 'ops', 'group', 'known', 'Joes.They', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'back', 'Pit', 'Joe', 'command', 'center', 'North', 'Africa', 'Here', 'Duke', 'Ripcord', 'convince', 'General', 'Hawk', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'let', 'join', 'team', 'mission', 'know', 'Baroness', 'personally', 'past.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'battle', 'Joes', 'double', 'crosser', 'James', 'McCullen', 'group', 'genetically', 'altered', 'soldiers', 'warheads', 'are', 'amazing', 'fights', 'movie', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Sanke', 'Eyes', 'who', 'kind', 'super', 'ninja', 'rival', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'played', 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'whole', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'France', 'was', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'definitely', 'snuck', 'up', 'top', 'five', 'movies', 'year', 'list', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', '4', '5', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'big', 'sreen', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'action', 'flick']",N/A

BAD guys use noise guns that shoot noise at people, which pushes them backwards, and sometimes makes them do backflips.The GOOD guys decapitated at least three people, and stabbed two different people in the eyeball (not counting the three eyeball-harpoonings).  The BAD guys tried to dissolve the Eiffel Tower.  The GOOD guys made it stop dissolving halfway through, which made it tumble over and crush a bridge full of people.Later a good guy got one of the noise guns, and it had a lock-on function, so Destro must have invented heat-seeking noise.  Unfortunately he had to stop using it when it evidently ran out of noise.The Baroness is haunted by memories of the best picnic ever.  It's unclear whether she ever did anything else with Duke, or if they just had the one late-afternoon picnic and then got engaged, but I wouldn't be surprised if that picnic was enough to seal the deal.  It was such an incredible picnic that the mere memory of it gave the Baroness strength to reject her evil nano-machine programming/infection.Cobra Commander: This injection deactivates people's self-preservation instinct.Destro: In ENGLISH please!Cobra Commander: They feel no fear.First of all, I've heard lots of complicated, confusing pseudo-science that makes another character say ""in ENGLISH please!"" in movies, and this was the least-complicated and least-confusing.  I think Destro might be stupid.  Second of all, three minutes later two of the fearless guys fell off something tall and screamed all the way down.Channing Tatum utilized the ""Palin Method"" in his portrayal of Duke (so called after the blogger/actress/former governor).

Plus about a quarter of the movie is montages of two little boys beating and stabbing one another while an old pervert watches.  I'd say it's so bad that it's good for a laugh, if they trimmed it down by about seven hours.

So being that Joe fan growing up in the 80's and knowing that a movie  was being made upon it gave you something to look forward to until its release. Being a spectator of this film after having high hopes can be damaging to your health, and everything that you can remember from the cartoon show; in other words childhood memory.I will notate the flaws from this movie that made my stomach twitch: The dialogue and the ridiculous script that made look the Joe's (America's most badass!) like amateurs.The dialogue reminded me alot of what is considered one of the worst movie ever made: Batman & Robin. Cheesey lines, and unneccesary gags. In the movie theater you would hear dead silence when one of the characters 'tried' to be 'funny'. Even I felt ackward.I also hated the fact that the Cobras found so easily the Joe's their underground layer. Yes I know, there was a chip inside the suit case which is the only possible way of initiating such search but it was just too unreal and too easy. The writers could of thought of something better.Now, for the good things. Obviously the special effects, very well done, as well with the action sequences. Used to watch the 80's cartoon I found it quite astonishing how they pulled that one off.Snake Eyes steals the show for sure. He was my favorite character from the cartoon series and I can say that he is my favorite character from the movie. The female cast was also an eye candy, and I think them and Snake Eyes are the only reason why I would watch this movie again.If they are planning to make a sequel please make it less childish and remember that us real G.I Joe fans are actually adults. I was hoping for a more serious atmosphere and for an adult action movie. Kids probably left the theater happy and cheering while most of us grown ups left disappointed. It's not a bad film, it is entertaining but it does have its flaws that without them could of been far superior.

Sure, it wasn't set back in the 60's when G.I. Joe was founded, but World War 2 and Vietnam movies have been done to death. So, it was refreshing to see them take G.I. Joe in a completely different direction. The future. With new weapons, new technology and new faces.Sure the script has been criticized as being non-existent and smothered by action sequences and special effects. Yet, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is by far, a more creative and involving story than many actions movies of recent, as in, anything by Roland Emmerich, Twilight movies or whatever. It actually is a fast and furious pace with an actually very complicated story. That to me, was the problem. Because the fast and furiuos pace would brush over the story elements with a very thin brush and so when the ending finally got there, there were way too many loose ends and they all seemed to come pouring down in the final 3 minutes.They could have slowed down and made the story elements more important, but all in all, what you get with G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is an energetic, cyber-weapon summer flick that gave people what most summer movie viewers want, slam bam action with cool effects.If anything, G.I. Joe tried to do TOO MUCH story, and didn't cover all of it or give it justice because they were more interested in pleasing the teenage crowd that buys the tickets.

1280469,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002NXSRVG,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 6]","Back in June, a rumor was spread amongst Hollywood insiders stating that the director of ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" Stephen Sommers, was fired from the project and locked out of the editing room after a test screening received the lowest score of any Paramount Pictures test screening. I have no way of knowing whether or not this is true. On the basis of the final product, however, I tend to think that it might be. This movie is painfully bad, a nonstop, aggressive, ear splitting, eye straining explosion of action and special effects. It has a plot in the strictest sense, but in terms of delivery and execution, it never bothers to tell a story. It's a hopped up assault on the senses, the audience constantly bombarded with loud, hyperactive sequences of mindless violence and destruction. I enjoy summer popcorn flicks as much as the next guy, but I find them much more tolerable if they pause and take a deep breath every so often.I don't pretend to know anything about the original Hasbro action figures; my personal toy preference tended towards building sets and blank sheet of paper for drawing. From what I know, however, the original G.I. Joe figures were based on the American military and divided into actual branches like Army, Navy, and Air Force. They eventually shifted into a more action oriented back story involving the evil Cobra Command, and I guess that's what the movie is based on. So what we have is not so much a military story but a science fiction shoot-`em-up featuring a lot of cool special effects. If eye candy is your thing, fine, but don't expect to get anything out of the story. Incidentally, I use the word ""story"" loosely since it's pretty hard to figure out what this movie is about.At best, I can say that it involves specially engineered warheads filled with microscopic robots that can eat entire cities on a molecular level. Fighting over control of the warheads are the evil MARS corporation and a top secret military faction known as G.I. Joe. From the MARS corporation, we have the duplicitous weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), the smoking hot Baroness (Sienna Miller), the stealthy Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun), and master of disguise Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who can never stop whistling ""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."" There's also a mad doctor who looks like a cross between Freddy Kruger and Darth Vader, but I don't think I should reveal who plays him since that would give away a crucial plot point.From G.I. Joe, we have two recruited soldiers, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), the team leader, General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the mute Snake Eyes (Ray Park), the hulking Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and the super-intelligent Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), who, much like a Vulcan, believes that emotions are useless because they can't be explained logically. Funny, given the fact that Nichols was also cast in this year's version of ""Star Trek.""We're introduced to all of these characters, and we're told a fair amount about their personal lives: Duke and Baroness were once engaged; Ripcord is falling in love with Scarlett; McCullen had an ancestor who was tried for treason in France back in 1641, which is when the film begins; the mad doctor knows more about Duke and Baroness than he cares to admit. But what does any of this mean? Not a heck of a lot, given the fact that most of what we're told plays second fiddle to the action. My God, the action--endless scenes of running and falling and jumping and shooting and punching and kicking and flying, and all of it saturated with CGI. Of all the things I gathered from this movie, the most prominent is that Sommers really has a thing with stuntmen projected through sheets of glass. That, and the fact that he must have had a burning desire to watch the Eiffel Tower get destroyed.If there is a saving grace for ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" it's that it manages to get better as it goes along. I still couldn't figure out what was going on, but at least I began getting involved. Of course, that's the point at which the movie ends, so I was ultimately left feeling completely unsatisfied. Who are these characters? What are they doing? Why should anyone even care?Some of you probably feel that I'm being too harsh on this film, especially since it isn't supposed to be anything more than summer entertainment. If you're one of them, here's what I have to say: Why should movies get a pass simply for being released during the summer? Why can't a good movie be good and a bad movie be bad, regardless of the season? I enjoy escapist entertainment as much as the next person, but when your movie can't take a couple of minutes to slow down and give the audience's eyes and ears a rest, you no longer have a movie. You have a noisy video game projected on a screen. ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is exactly like that, and what's worse, the filmmakers never give the audience the controller and let it have a turn.",2,An Action-Packed Action Film with Lots of

1280470,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B002NXSRVG,Christopher,"[3, 6]","Let me say first that I did not buy this film - I downloaded it in HD.  I am glad that I did not blind buy this one!!  When I heard that they were making a G.I. Joe live action film I said ""it's about time!""  When I saw the promo pics of Snake Eyes, I thought that it looked promising - until I saw the first trailer.  Once I saw that I said this does not look right.  Rip Cord? He was not a major character!Once I heard that Marlon Wayans and Dennis Quaid would be in it I was not feeling good.  Wayans is about jokes and Quaid does not look athletic.  I had this on my PC since it was first released and I just got around to watching it.  That bad feeling that I had came true.  First is the Destro's ancestor scene which was not needed.  If they felt the need to go back in time, it should have been for Cobra Commander if anything.  The Destro character clearly wears a mask because he is the 'enemy weapons supplier' and does not want to be identified.Well, aside from the lack of a coherent story that seems like scenes were filmed and put together to hope that they get a movie, the script is horrible!  I rarely talk badly about most film's scripts (except B movies), but this script is one of the worst ever!  Why have Hawk say ""knowing is half the battle?""  That was from the cartoon, not the G.I. Joe universe. They should not have even thought about the cartoon (although it seems as if the makers just watched one episode and felt that they got the gist of it), they should have just made their own vision of it.I always wondered what if they made a Transformer film and a G.I. Joe film, what would they look like?  I expected The Transformers to look stupid and I expected G.I. Joe to look serious.  Who would have thought that the film that would be harder to make convincing looked and was better, but the easier one was the one that looked foolish and corny?  The actors act as if they know the script sucks, but they are saying it anyway.  None of the actors look like they are least was put into some basic training and discipline.  They never stand like soldiers, act like soldiers or conduct themselves like soldiers.  Instead, they all look like actors dressed like soldiers.Since when did G.I. Joe have foreign soldiers?  Roadblock surly was not British and i do not recall Breaker being Moroccan let alone a main character - especially after Dial-Tone came along.  Also, Duke was a Master Sargent not a lieutenant. Hawk was a Brigadier General not a four star general.  I suppose they changed ranks in order to make it more believable that Duke would be the ground leader even is some Joe members out-ranked him and were officers.  The only time I can recall that this got addressed was in G.I. Joe:The Movie when Falcon said to Duke ""I'm pulling rank!""  Some of us actually paid attention to the ranks, names and positions of the figures...Let me just say that this movie is horrible and I hope that they do not make a sequel.  If they do, PLEASE get someone else to do EVERYTHING on this film.  hell, REBOOT this one now.  i do not know how they messed this up when it should of had a focus on military instead of the cartoon or anything else that did not go together.  Not good.  Also, who cares about Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow fighting?  The did not start out as brothers and Snake Eyes did not start out as a martial artist, he just have the black commando suit and then they turned it into a ninja thing which helped ruin the toy line.I guess the makers felt that they should throw everyone in a black suit because black always looks cool and dangerous?  G.I. Joe was an AMERICAN thing (although the toys were released internationally but as native to those countries), but they put all of these foreigners in there.  Maybe some people are correct when they say that those who run the Federal Reserve are softening us up for a one world government with all of these British people on American movies, TV shows (tell me when have you seen this in US history?) and worst of all - our NEWS and politics shows!  As you can see from the cover, they thought that Snake Eyes was the selling point.  He was a cool character (mainly the Darth Vader effect with black), but I doubt that he was everyone's main attraction, although his figure was hard to find in stores.I felt NOTHING for any of the characters.  Hawk did not look strong or like a solider.  I think that the production team thought of this as toy line instead of it being a military thing. I did not care about ninjas, Cobra or G.I. Joe! It was also stupid for the director to have the characters be called their called names from the start of their lives.  Their names are code names not real names! This ruined my great memories of that toy line!  Stick to the cartoon as that was waaaaaaaaaaay better than this film!  This is one to stay away from and is not even worth a rental.  I now you will be hard headed and buy it anyway, but trust me...",1,I was warned...,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,4936,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'film', 'downloaded', 'HD', 'am',

JOE: THE RISE OF COBRASTARRING: Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, Sienna Miller, Christopher Eccleston, Dennis Quaid, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, Byung-hun Lee, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin J. O'Connor and Brendan FraserWRITTEN BY: Stuart Beattie, David Elliot, Paul Lovett, Michael Gordon and Stephen SommersDIRECTED BY: Stephen SommersRated: PG-13Genre: Action / Science FictionRelease Date: 07 August 2009You know it's a bad movie when Marlon Wayans is out-acting everyone on screen. Maybe the other actors of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, were trying to portray the action figure version G.I. Joes rather than the characters they play in the film. Their performances are every bit as lifeless as the plastic toys.Channing Tatum plays the central character named Duke, who is all about fighting and is a hard-core solider to the bone. But there is a huge flaw with his character. If he's such an awesome soldier, I'm sure he would know to address Generals as sir, wouldn't he? Not in this film. Apparently it's okay for him to cop an attitude towards them as well. Tatum is normally fun to watch but his performance in this film was terrible.Marlon Wayans plays Ripcord. Despite his ridiculous name, he was the only thing keeping my entertainment level from completely plummeting during the course of the film. He was a real-live person; he was believable and hilarious, as to be expected. He had some very good laugh-out loud one liners.The two of them must have joined in the buddy program because they have been together through every moment of their military careers side by side.The Plot? The two are transporting some warheads from A to B when they are ambushed by Duke's ex fianc&eacute; Anastasia (Sienna Miller) who wants them for evil. They are then rescued by the G.I. Joes; a special elite military team headed by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Immediately Duke wants in and Ripcord of course follows.Then there are some more bad guys, who want to take over the world for various reasons. There are a good ninja and a bad ninja who have some issues to discuss regarding their troubled childhood together. Oh yeah, and then one of the bad guys turns out to be an old friend of Duke's and the brother of Duke's ex-girlfriend, Anastasia and now none of them like each other because Duke was supposed to look after the brother, but then the brother supposedly was killed in action, so the sister was angry with Duke and vanished and died her hair black and got all dark and scary. But then the brother wasn't dead after all; only injured badly in an explosion, so now he is angry as well and wants to take over the world. Did you get all of that? It feels a little more like a daytime soap opera than one of the biggest action movies of the year doesn't it? Maybe they should have all went on the Dr. Phil show or to a group therapy session or something, to work out these issues and they could have saved all of us seven dollars and 100 minutes of our lives.I have been a huge fan of Stephen Sommers' work in the past. The Mummy, Deep Rising and Van Helsing are all among favorites of mine.With directing this film however, It seems like his goal may have been to use the most CGI (computer graphic imagery) ever. The man CGI'd everything! Water was CGI, underwater shots were CGI, sand was CGI, snow was CGI and even an Air Craft Carrier was CGI! Why? I just watched a low budget straight to DVD movie the other day and they were able to get footage of a live Carrier, so why wasn't this film able to do the same with its massive budget?It's bad enough that so many things were fake to begin with, but most of it was horribly done. There is a weapon in the film that releases this green gas, and takes down the Eiffel Tower. You can see it on any of the trailers. The tower was the only Computer Generated Image that was done well but the green gas looks so fake! I have seen video games and lower budget films with way better computer graphics. The water looked fake, snow looked fake and the sand looked really fake. Why were all of these things computer generated at all? You would think of all people, the guy who directed The Mummy would know where and how to get his hands on some real sand! I guess I shouldn't be too surprised though. After all, he did CGI The Rock in The Mummy Returns. I wished he hadn't returned.Let's talk about the costumes for a second. I understand that this was a T.V show and that the action figures were the most popular of all. I get all that. But if you look at the X-Men films, they enhanced the costumes in the movies to look, how should I put this... not so LAME. The `multi-million' dollar suits that Tatum and Wayans are running around the streets of Paris with were absolutely ridiculous looking. It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger dressed as Turbo Man at the end of Jingle All the Way. That was a comedy, so what's G.I. Joe's excuse?From what I have heard, rather it's true or not I'm not sure, the film didn't even raise a profit at the box office. Despite this, rumor has it a sequel is already in the works. Upon hearing this information my brain could only muster a single response: G.I. wonder why they would do that.",1,G.I.

1280483,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002NXSRVG,DanD,"[11, 15]","The main problem with G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA?  It's not a G.I. JOE movie.  At all.  Somewhere along the way, the studio probably decided (correctly, it seems) that they could tack the G.I. JOE label on this baby and make a few extra bucks.  This story line could be told with any characters, and it would still make no sense whatsoever.Let's face it: you don't watch films like this for the story, the plot, the acting, the dialogue, or anything that you would watch a decent movie for.  You watch it for cheesy lines, lots of action...basically something to watch while eating nachos and drinking beer.  And, on that level, God help us all, THE RISE OF COBRA works.I won't bother rehashing the plot; there isn't one.  There's a whole lot of miscasting--Marlon Wayans? Really?--and way, way too many flashbacks; we don't care about Snake-Eyes's past, we only care about how much a** he kicks in the present (and, thanks to Ray Parks, he kicks a lot).  There's too much back story between Duke (Channing Tatum, as reliably wooden as always) and the Baroness (Sienna Miller, slumming it hardcore), and eventually a showdown between Duke, Cobra-to-be Rex (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Destro-to-be McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) involving who loves the Baroness the most (did I just ruin things?).  Yeah, even for an action-and-no-brains flick, it's far-fetched.  And don't get me started on the excelerator suits.But there's something to be said for actors who know they're making a horrible movie.  Gordon-Levitt is a pure and under delight, hamming it up almost as much as he did in (a far superior film) KILLSHOT; Eccleston is pure and utter camp, as is Dennis Quaid as the leader of the Joes.  We also get cameos from Sommers mainstays Brendan Fraser and Kevin J. O'Connor, and you know you're watching crap when you think to yourself: ""This film could use more Brendan Fraser.""  Fraser's MUMMY nemesis Arnold Vosloo is grossly under-used as Zartan, Cobra's shape-shifting wild card, as is Jonathan Pryce as the U.S. president.  Ultimately, we are left with a movie that means little or nothing to those of us who grew up with G.I.

Not because it was a good movie, or because it was innovative or original. ""GI Joe"" is simply amazing in that it fails at almost everything it tries to deliver.Action - I will give the movie a couple stars here, there are plenty of action scenes with things blowing up and bullets (and funky looking electricy blobs too) being shot almost constantly. Throw in some techno-matrix-karate fighting and a couple ""Iron Man""-like super suits and you'll be distracted for a few minutes.Plot - Are you kidding? I love the idea of a metal-eating ""virus"" and the visual of seeing it hit the Eiffel Tower was pretty cool, but the mish-mash of a soldier feeling he let down the girl he loved, haunted by a failed mission..blah, blah, blah. We've seen it all before and it's a pretty thin stretch to make this the backbone of your film(this same plot device is actually the basis for the comedy ""Airplane!""). At one point our hero shows up at a funeral in a thunderstorm...on a motorcycle...wearing sunglasses. Okay, I have an easier time buying the bionic super-suit and the Borg-like bad-guy than I do believing anyone would think its a good idea to go for a motorcycle ride in a driving rain wearing sunglasses, arriving while the funeral is in progress just so you can look all melancholy and cool.Special Effects - The big F/X moments in the flick actually pay off. The underwater villain's lair, the metal eating munchies going after the tanks and the tower look great. Unfortunately not as much attention seemed to be paid to the ""little"" things, like the CGI chase scenes where everything looked too cartoonish and simply silly.Cast - I'm convinced there were no actual humans in this film. Not one person ""acted"", they simply walked around looking good in several costumes, kind of like ninja-models-on-the-loose. You have to worry when the one character who doesn't utter a word the entire film and is hidden behind a mask actually manages to out-act everyone around him. Quite a menagerie of cliches too; the witty black side-kick who provides the comic relief (kept waiting for him to say ""dayyyummm""), the drone like henchman, the Asian karate expert, the fat karate master.

Yes, it won't likely win the actors any Oscars, but who was really expecting that kind of movie here anyways.

In fact having a 5 year old of my own and getting him the old cartoon series (which in my memory I held in very high esteem), I can safely say that it wasn't filled with a lot of believabilty, plot lines, or great voice acting. In fact the plots were often cheesy as was the sexual tension between some of the male and female characters. Ditto for the movie.  And if I am somewhat disappointed in the movie it is only in that the violence is a little bit much for the crowd they are marketing all those toys to. As an adult, I was OK with it and thought it fit what I wanted but as a parent watching it with my son I thought it was a bit much (the old cartoons were kid of like McGyver and the A-team in that about 10,000 rounds were expelled per episode yet no one on either side died).

Yet ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" contains a significant number of ""homages"" even when considering the standards of its genre.In truth, it's not a bad movie.  ""Rise of Cobra"" contains a number of gratifying action sequences, and the special effects on the whole are quite good.  It's also fun for the grown man who enjoyed the toys of his youth to watch the story unfold and ask himself, for example, ""Is that the Baroness?""  And every scene involving Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes (old or young) is edge-of-your-seat good stuff.  There is a lot to keep the casual fan involved.The problem is, many scenes trigger deja vu in a distracting way.  Take, for example, a shot of slo-mo backflips over projectile weapons in a narrow city street: ""Transformers,"" anyone?  Or consider the targeting of the Eiffel Tower by a terrorist organization.  We saw that in ""Team America: World Police,"" a much better movie in more than one way (here's a hint: it never takes itself too seriously).  The accelerator suits certainly made me think of ""Ironman"" on more than one occasion.  The trope of the friend who turns on you--because of a woman--seemed copied-and-pasted from ""The Dark Knight.""

Joe: Rise of Cobra perfectly. Coming from Director Steven Sommers, who after 'Van Helsing' stopped taking himself seriously, doesn't really take anything seriously in this movie. There is a plot, that tries to take itself seriously, but towards the middle of the movie I think it just gives up and throws in Cobra's story every once and a while. And yes, if you try to give the bad guys motivation, 9 times out of 10 it fails, and watching this film it's a 4 out of 4.Channing Tatum, that ""cute"" guy with the Army haircut takes on the burden of playing G.I. Joe, sure, it's technically an organization, but he's basically an action figure in this movie, and his acting attests to that. But even with all this, I did find his character somewhat interesting in that he's this super soldier, but no matter what he does he's a screw-up. He tries to help his friend, his face gets Vadarized. He tries to save the Eiffel Tower, it's partially intact when it topples over and kills a ton of people. If the filmmakers care about character development in the sequel, this feature to the character would be very interesting to expand on. The rest of the Joe team is pretty good, but a little unmemorable. Except in a bad way for Marlon Wayans, who stayed away from his brothers' crappy movies, but gets saddled with all these awful jokes. Also, even though Dennis Quaid is shown in all the trailers and is given high billing, he mails it in for all of the five minutes he's there.But wait, then there's Snake Eyes. Channing Tatum is the ""star"" of this film, but Snake Eyes is the most bad-a** dude here. First, he doesn't talk because he's taking a lifelong vow of silence, and he's an awesome fighter. Really, some of his sword-fighting sequences are some of the best I've seen in years. Even the child version of him is kicks butt. Snake Eyes looks cool, gets the job done, and is the film's breakout character.Action-wise, it's like a best-of summer action films. There's chases in vehicles, underwater, in the air, with swords, with guns, with fists & feet. Did I miss any? Basically if you ask what kind of action this film has, I say all the above. For the most part, all of it works, it's all pretty cool, and it never overstays its welcome. Also, at home Blu-Ray & an awesome home theater system will mean everything to this movie, and it increases the experience ten-fold. And yes, perhaps the film's best sequence, and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while is the Paris chase with the accelerator suits. It's incredibly self-indulgent with slow motion, but I loved every minute of it.There are also two great unique elements to the movie I found enjoyable.1. The movies makes very heavy use of the flashback sequence to give the backstory for all the main characters, and while it does slow it down some because there's not really any action to them, I applaud the effort and I found them pretty engaging.2. Having seen a lot of these future technology weapons on the History Channel, it's pretty cool seeing the movie making heavy use of this advanced technology working the way it would really work, and not a Hollywood version of it. Somers says all the tech will be in use in 20 years, and I highly doubt it, but it's cool to see these futuristic weapons grounded in reality for once.Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, the action-phile I am, and it's a great way to lose two hours. It never loses it's welcome, and it provides a lot of satisfactory bones thrown to the audience. It never takes itself seriously, as it shouldn't, and you shouldn't either, because you'll wind up disappointed. For the G.I. Joe fans, if you're a fans of 60s/70s Joe, it's in name only unless you count the scar on Channing Tatum. As for the 80s cartoon Joe fans, you'll most likely find yourself highly pleased since the movie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.",5,"Put Me Down For An Accelerator Suit, Please!",1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,4025,"['need', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'also', 'pure', 'action', 'movie', 'then', ""'ve"", 'just', 'described', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'perfectly', 'Coming', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Sommers', 'who', ""'Van"", 'Helsing', 'stopped', 'taking', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'anything', 'seriously', 'movie', 'plot', 'take', 'seriously', 'middle', 'movie', 'think', 'just', 'up', 'throws', 'Cobra', 'story', 'once', 'while', 'yes', 'try', 'give', 'bad', 'guys', 'motivation', '9', 'times', '10', 'watching', 'film', '4', '4.Channing', 'Tatum', 'cute', 'guy', 'Army', 'haircut', 'burden', 'playing', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'sure', 'technically', 'organization', 'basically', 'action', 'figure', 'movie', 'acting', 'attests', 'even', 'did', 'find', 'character', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'super', 'soldier', 'matter', 'what', 'screw-up', 'help', 'friend', 'face', 'Vadarized', 'save', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'partially', 'intact', 'when', 'kills', 'ton', 'people', 'filmmakers', 'care', 'character', 'development', 'sequel', 'feature', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'expand', 'rest', 'Joe', 'team', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'unmemorable', 'bad', 'way', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'who', 'stayed', 'away', 'brothers', 'crappy', 'movies', 'saddled', 'awful', 'jokes', 'Also', 'even', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'shown', 'trailers', 'given', 'high', 'billing', 'five', 'minutes', 'there.But', 'wait', 'then', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'star', 'film', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'most', 'bad-a**', 'dude', 'here', 'First', ""n't"", 'talk', 'taking', 'lifelong', 'vow', 'silence', 'awesome', 'fighter', 'Really', 'sword-fighting', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Even', 'child', 'version', 'kicks', 'butt', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'cool', 'job', 'done', 'film', 'breakout', 'character.Action-wise', 'best-of', 'summer', 'action', 'films', 'chases', 'vehicles', 'underwater', 'air', 'swords', 'guns', 'fists', 'feet', 'Did', 'miss', 'Basically', 'ask', 'what', 'kind', 'action', 'film', 'say', 'above', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'cool', 'never', 'welcome', 'Also', 'home', 'Blu-Ray', 'awesome', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'will', 'mean', 'everything', 'movie', 'experience', 'ten-fold', 'yes', 'perhaps', 'film', 'best', 'sequence', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Paris', 'chase', 'accelerator', 'suits', 'incredibly', 'self-indulgent', 'slow', 'motion', 'loved', 'minute', 'it.There', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'great', 'unique', 'elements', 'movie', 'found', 'enjoyable.1', 'movies', 'very', 'heavy', 'use', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'give', 'backstory', 'main', 'characters', 'slow', 'down', 'not', 'really', 'action', 'applaud', 'effort', 'found', 'pretty', 'engaging.2', 'Having', 'seen', 'lot', 'future', 'technology', 'weapons', 'History', 'Channel', 'pretty', 'cool', 'seeing', 'movie', 'making', 'heavy', 'use', 'advanced', 'technology', 'working', 'way', 'would', 'really', 'work', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Somers', 'tech', 'will', 'be', 'use', '20', 'years', 'highly', 'doubt', 'cool', 'see', 'futuristic', 'weapons', 'grounded', 'reality', 'once.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'action-phile', 'am', 'great', 'way', 'lose', 'two', 'hours', 'never', 'welcome', 'lot', 'satisfactory', 'bones', 'thrown', 'audience', 'never', 'seriously', 'should', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'either', ""'ll"", 'wind', 'up', 'disappointed', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'fans', ""'re"", 'fans', '60s/70s', 'Joe', 'name', 'only', 'count', 'scar', 'Channing', 'Tatum', '80s', 'cartoon', 'Joe', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'highly', 'pleased', 'movie', 'most', 'universe', 'cartoon', 'series']",N/A

Besides the action and stories and military technicalities of this show, I remember loving the interactions of all the different characters and the great chemistry between the friends and romantic couples like Flint and Lady Jay, Destro and the Baroness and especially, Scarlett and Duke. I can only guess that Hasbro has taken leave of its senses because it has recklessly allowed the makers of the film to pull a Bryan Singer and completely change the mythology of this original series. The action scenes were great, the CGI is state of the art, the music is good and the origin story on Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was well done. But, TRAGICALLY, it appears that once they decided to cast Sienna Miller as the Baroness, they must have felt compelled to make her the star of the film which meant making her the female lead heroine opposite the male lead hero, Duke!!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the current released movie version of this wonderful series omits one of the major components of what made this series wonderful in the first place: the original, established love stories.In the original animated show, Destro is a burly, deep voiced, authorative, powerful character (easy to understand why the Baroness loves him)- more so than the Cobra Commander versus the movie where he is a stringy, funny looking, squeeky voiced old guy with a Scottish accent and a stalker-like attitude toward the Baroness!In the original series, the Baroness, herself, is a deliciously cool and conniving character integral to the workings of the COBRA organization versus the current film which actually starts really well then slams you into a twisted, distracting, boring and idiotic thread where the Baroness is made out to be an American under mind control by the little brother (Cobra Commander) she believed dead, caused by the guy she was engaged to - Duke.In the series, Scarlett is THE number one woman on the Joe Team and in Duke's heart. In the TERRIBLY written movie, Scarlett has a crush on - Ripcord.The sheer stupidity that Hollywood film makers keep engaging in time after time after time is mind blowing! If something is good, they always think they can make it better. If something is NOT broken, they ruin it!! Wether it's giving Lois Lane an illigitmate child and turning Superman into a stalker a la Mr. Bryan Singer, or introducing superlana and previously non-existant sidekick chloe to Smallville, or even dishing out millions of dollars to give Halle Berry the chance to show off her more-animal-than-human moronic and unattractive version of Catwoman, you can almost always count on those selfless movie people to do away with nice bits of childhood art appreciation and hand you the tripe concocted by their ginormously over-priced egos instead!The exception of changing mythos is Transformers. In the original series, there was no love story. What's more, I always thought it was funny how the Dad and son who befriend the Autobots were always wearing their yellow hard hats. In the two live action movies, for once, spielberg's team, actually improved on an already established storyline by adding a love story and digging deeper into the human/robot friendship. It is just plain SAD that G.I.

Recent examples include Transformers and Spider Man. However, as someone that grew up with the GI Joe cartoons, action figures, vehicle toys, etc... I felt this movie was moderately acceptable.My biggest complaints are with how they changed re-imagined the story, and the cheezy CGI. Physics don't apply to any of the action sequences. Scarlett, while being smoking hot, ""performs"" feats in a motorcycle that break every law of physics to the point it was painful to watch. The accelerator suits were a nice touch, but the CGI didn't make them seem very probable even in the near future. I love Sci-Fi and mech suits, but I thought it would be a bit more palatable if the accelerator suits had jump jets / flight capability ala Apple Seed.The good parts are still aplenty. The Cobra/MARS fortress and the GI Joe base fall into the same category of ""crazy, but apropos"" concepts found in the original cartoon. The underwater weaponry also aligns with the laser-beams that they used in the cartoons.Overall, I give Rise of Cobra 3/5 stars and recommend it as a rental on the weekend.

1280530,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B002NXSRVG,G. Max Gooding,"[3, 3]","BackgroundThe G.I. Joe trademark and franchise has its origins in the realm of toys. In 1964, Hasbro launched a line of realistic 12"" action figures that represented various divisions of the military services. Later in 1982, a smaller line (3.75 inches) of these toys were introduced. With this line an entire storyline was also told. This story involved the battles between the G.I. Joe forces and the evil Cobra Command. It is from this storyline that this movie takes it queue.StorylineThe storyline is one that is closely knit around life long enemies, past lovers and good friends. At various points, there are flashbacks to fill in the missing pieces. The main article of contention are 4 warheads that contain a newly developed technology - Nanomites. These miniature robots and be programmed to eat metal and any other material as necessary, and can literally destroy anything in their path until they are deactivated.Action SequencesThere is plenty of action sequences throughout this film. There is a full set of high tech vehicles (air, land, underground and sea) to captivate your imagination. The sequence that I like the most is the street chase scene in Paris. I haven't seen such an intensely packed road sequence since the Matrix Reloaded.

I go into these types of movies knowing they could be stupid (Transformers 2) or disappointing (Watchmen). I'm not expecting much...I mean, if I want Oscar performances or something with meaning I'll got to an art house movie theater and catch something indie.Whatever the reason, this movie just took me along for the ride and kept me entertained the whole way. Maybe it's the great action throughout...maybe it's the awesome marital arts between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow...maybe it's the toned down hotness of Scarlett and the Baroness (they tease with their beauty, no need for anything excessive here). The movie grabs you with early action and keeps going. The story unfolds with tossed in highlights of the pasts of a handful of the characters so you can understand what's going on but doesn't waste any more time than is necessary. Looking for feelings and emotion? The touchy-feelly aisle is over there. This movie's just here to entertain and keep you guessing in places.Meanwhile the tech is great even if some of it is infeasible. But even that...I'm a military junkie so when things get out of hand, it's hard not to notice...here, I didn't mind it (okay, it was bugging me a bit at the end with the jet but that's beside the point).The movie's a fun ride and gets you there without wasting too much time on boring scenes the director wanted in there for some unknown reason. The plot is actually not bad considering but it's irrelevant in the end. This is about GI Joe vs Cobra (or what will become Cobra) and you're here to have fun.My only complaint about this (I got both Blu-Ray and standard DVD versions, by the way so this applies to both--what can I do, we don't have Blu-Ray in the living room) is how they started packaging these movies. It used to be that when you saw ""2 Disk Set + Digital Copy"" that meant you got 2 Disks of content and a digital copy on one of the disks or on a separate disk. Now, they're still calling it a 2-disk set but the second disk has all of 2, count them, 2 special features (a making of and a sfx doc). Especially with Blu-Ray...the whole idea is the disks include more storage space so you can fit the HD version but also fit a lot of other content.To me, a film this big deserves the extra content and that needs to include a lot more than two featurettes. Honestly, let me download the digital copy or something and give me more like gag reels, docs on other parts of the behind the scenes stuff. Or else call it a 1 Disk + Digital Copy set and call it a day. Need another disk for the digital copy? Fine, charge me the extra $0.50 it costs to add the disk (including shipping!) and put it in there on a separate disk.This is like what food retailers do with the reduced size packaging that ""looks"" like it hasn't changed but is thinner, taller-but-narrower, or some other deceptive format. It's obvious greed and is not appreciated, despite the price of the Blu-Ray. If it wasn't for that, I'd give this sucker a five-star rating (rare for me).

I went to see this one months ago and, based on that crapalicious trailer (ya know, the one with the armored suits), I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed. Or even whelmed. This movie doesn't aim too high, and so it hits its target audience. G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA is what it is - a big budget summertime popcorn flick in which the big dogs figured that as long as it's slick and peopled with cool and beautiful actors and chock full of dazzling and eardrum-shattering effects, then that'll do for the sheep. The critics showered it with hate. And, sheepishly, I wasn't as turned off as I maybe should've been. I'm giving it a generous 3 stars out of 5, thanks to the inner kid in me which may be not cool with what's been done here but, on the other hand, is just grateful that G.I. Joe finally made it to the big screen as a live action picture.Odds are, any movie featuring a Wayans brother instantly surrenders busloads of credibility. This one lost a few more points with me once Marlon Wayons started mugging for the camera. I give the writers credit for trying to come up with a story from the ground level up, this by having Duke and Ripcord introduced as fresh recruits to this elite military team. This gives us two point-of-view characters to identify with. There's a lot of stuff going on. The movie depends on the audiences' childhood familiarity with the characters to pull them thru all the hectic.The plot is big and bloated, the dialogue is dumbed down, the action sequences a showcase for big budget excesses. What's missing is heart and, okay, a solid script and enough actors who can sell the storyline. It's a bit damning that, for me, the two most absorbing characters happen to be the black ninja with the vow of silence and the vampy bespectacled villainess. I guess, for the lead, they tried to find a stud who was hip and smoove and relatable, and Tatum Channing must've fit the bill. But I feel that he was miscast as Duke, that he lacks the necessary acting chops and that sense of solidity and resolve, despite all claims from his buddy Wayans that ""Duke wasn't born, he was government-issued."" Tatum Channing sleepwalks thru this one, and one wonders what Sam Worthington would've done with this role (it was offered to Worthington but dude had to do AVATAR). And, as for Marlon Wayans, well, there he is, standing there just being a Wayans. We really could've done with more of Dennis Quaid's General Hawk. Good thing, then, that the guy is signed on for two sequels.The story is set somewhen ""in the not too distant future,"" which then allows for some pretty impressive future tech from both the good guys and the bad. The Joes, for example, flaunt a coat enabling extreme camouflage and clunky one-man armors called Delta 6 Accelerator Suits (the unconvincing demonstration of which seriously cheesed me off). The McGuffin of the movie are frightfully corrosive nanomites which can dissolve metal in mere moments. This frightening weapon is what one formidable terrorist organization holds over the free world. Unless General Hawk's special unit can save the day. And, even then, the bad guys are tricky enough and far-thinking enough that Duke and company can't possibly foil each of their contingency plans. So, sequel, anyone?Some credit goes to the movie for trying to add detail to its characters' backstories. Same credit is then snatched away for the numbing and excessive flashbacks. There's too much dawdling, also, in some scenes early on in which the bad guys talk on and on about their big nefarious scheme. But two things, more than anything else, bugged the heck out of me: a) Being a Snake Eyes fan, I wasn't cool with Scarlett and Ripcord doing the flirty flirty, and b) Snake Eyes' mask has friggin' lips! What the --? Speaking of flirting, Duke and the Baroness having a past history is new to me, not that I minded it all that much, and their relationship turns out to be pretty key to the story. But I thought it's always been ""Destro and the Baroness practicing the clarinet"" (and if you don't get that reference, check out the Funny or Die website for the awesome Ballad of G.I. Joe video clip).The fighty fights to watch out for are the grudge matches between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. There's also a nice bit between Scarlett and the Baroness, and I understand that both the very fine actresses (Rachel Nichols, Sienna Miller) actually suffered injuries while filming the scene. The rest of the action sequences are slick and big and must have cost a ton, but I just couldn't get into them. Just something so soulless and by-the-numbers to them, I think. And the bits with the exterior shots of the Pit (the G.I. Joe headquarters) somewhere in the Egyptian desert? Look very unconvincing.The actors playing the baddies carry the actors playing the heroes. There's something gleeful in how Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Byung-hun Lee, Sienna Miller (yes, Sienna Miller), and Arnold Vosloo go about fleshing out their villainous parts. Gordon-Levitt gets a chance to chew the scenery a bit as the kookybag who would eventually become the Cobra Commander. In this movie, the Terrordrome is still but a gleam in his rat crazy eyes.G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA, at least, isn't as bad as TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN. But, y'know, I wouldn't have minded at all if they'd just taken the soldiers from the TRANSFORMERS flicks and revamped them into the Joes. Tyrese Gibson comes off as a more convincing and gritty elite commando than Marlon Wayans.I do like the off-handed way the iconic phrases were worked in (""real American heroes,"" ""Knowing is half the battle,"" etc.). And despite Tatum Channing's weak interpretation, Duke remains my favorite Joe (And then Snake Eyes).Basically, if you were turned off by that trailer with the armor suits, then think of the film as one big extrapolation of that discontent. I'm glad G.I. Joe finally made it as a live action film, but damn...",3,"...rise of Cobra, collapse of franchise?

1280551,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002NXSRVG,Jason,"[4, 6]","Remember how Michael Bay and Shia LaBarf dropped a steaming deuce on your childhood memories of Transformers?  Well, the crew responsible for the miasma lingering around this rendition of GI Joe have upped the ante.Starting off with the bad, this is a collection of some of the worst acting and casting in movie history.  Siena Miller and Rachel Nichols look gorgeous the entire movie, but their more serious roles were on runways and in Dumb and Dumberer, respectively.  Channing ""Pinocchio"" Tatum reprises his emotionless military figure from Stop-Loss while perfecting acting without facial expressions of voice inflection that he flawlessly pulled off in Dear John.  Others like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all brought down by the rest.  To make matters worse, the guy playing Snake Eyes doesn't have any lines and he's the best actor.  The biggest travesty, however, is that Dennis Quaid was relegated to horribly predictable one-liners that serve no purpose other than to echo the mid-movie comments made by viewers who have figured out every storyline twist and turn eons before they occur.  His part may as well have been a holographic face in the top-right corner of the screen with a robotic voiceover.  Speaking of voiceovers, did I mention how horrible Tatum is?  My goodness, I feel like I just divided by zero, because the impossible has happened: there is an actor in Hollywood worse than Keanu Reeves.The flaws and plot-holes are so numerous they are not worth mentioning, but would it kill someone to remake a movie and stick even remotely close to the original storyline that everyone already loved?  The nonsensical side stories with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow didn't happen; there was no engagement between Duke and Baroness - and definitely wasn't a connection between Scarlett and Ripcord.  And what they did with Cobra Commander - making him a scientist with secretive ties to GI Joe members - is absolutely ridiculous.  None of these plot add-ons resonate with new viewers, much less attract longtime fans.As for the plot-holes, pick your favorites; they are too numerous to mention.  The overabundance of extras (e.g. nanotechnology, unnecessary background, underwater jets, strange energy rays, acceleration suits, multi-billion dollar facilities under the polar ice caps and the Egyptian deserts, etc.) is at times interesting and at others maddening.  It's just too much to be coherent.  The inclusion of multi-national forces in an organization that is supposed to be American (Hello! A real American hero...) is a slap in the face to the GI Joe canon.  Seeing soldier chums Duke (Tatum) and Ripcord (Wayans) wiggle their way into this ultra-secretive and best-of-the-best military commando unit because, you know, they really want to, is just too much to bear.If you're into this for the action and special effects (read: more CGI than Toy Story), and you loved the Transformer movies, then I suppose you'll like it.  I'd rather have the shade of gray that provides a bit more story, significantly better dialogue, and actors who can't be easily replaced by mannequins.  Overall it's just a little bit of good (i.e. Miller and Nichols in form-fitting, cleavage-producing outfits, and Snake Eyes' fight scenes) in a pile of garbage (i.e. acting, casting, CGI, plot, directing).Jason Elin",2,Digesting eye candy in a bowl of raw sewage,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,3340,"['Remember', 'how', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Shia', 'LaBarf', 'dropped', 'steaming', 'deuce', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Transformers', 'Well', 'crew', 'responsible', 'miasma', 'lingering', 'rendition', 'GI', 'Joe', 'have', 'upped', 'ante.Starting', 'off', 'bad', 'collection', 'worst', 'acting', 'casting', 'movie', 'history', 'Siena', 'Miller', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'entire', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'were', 'runways', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'respectively', 'Channing', 'Pinocchio', 'Tatum', 'emotionless', 'military', 'figure', 'Stop-Loss', 'perfecting', 'acting', 'facial', 'expressions', 'voice', 'inflection', 'flawlessly', 'pulled', 'off', 'Dear', 'John', 'Others', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'are', 'brought', 'down', 'rest', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'guy', 'playing', 'Snake', 'Eyes', ""n't"", 'have', 'lines', 'best', 'actor', 'biggest', 'travesty', 'however', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'relegated', 'horribly', 'predictable', 'one-liners', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'echo', 'mid-movie', 'comments', 'made', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'storyline', 'twist', 'turn', 'eons', 'occur', 'part', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'holographic', 'face', 'top-right', 'corner', 'screen', 'robotic', 'voiceover', 'Speaking', 'voiceovers', 'did', 'mention', 'how', 'horrible', 'Tatum', 'My', 'goodness', 'feel', 'just', 'divided', 'zero', 'impossible', 'happened', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'worse', 'Keanu', 'Reeves.The', 'flaws', 'plot-holes', 'are', 'so', 'numerous', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'would', 'kill', 'someone', 'remake', 'movie', 'stick', 'even', 'remotely', 'close', 'original', 'storyline', 'everyone', 'already', 'loved', 'nonsensical', 'side', 'stories', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'engagement', 'Duke', 'Baroness', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'connection', 'Scarlett', 'Ripcord', 'what', 'did', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'making', 'scientist', 'secretive', 'ties', 'GI', 'Joe', 'members', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'None', 'plot', 'add-ons', 'resonate', 'new', 'viewers', 'much', 'less', 'attract', 'longtime', 'fans.As', 'plot-holes', 'pick', 'favorites', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'overabundance', 'extras', 'e.g', 'nanotechnology', 'unnecessary', 'background', 'underwater', 'jets', 'strange', 'energy', 'rays', 'acceleration', 'suits', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'facilities', 'polar', 'ice', 'caps', 'Egyptian', 'deserts', 'etc', 'times', 'interesting', 'others', 'maddening', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'coherent', 'inclusion', 'multi-national', 'forces', 'organization', 'supposed', 'be', 'American', 'Hello', 'real', 'American', 'hero', 'slap', 'face', 'GI', 'Joe', 'canon', 'Seeing', 'soldier', 'chums', 'Duke', 'Tatum', 'Ripcord', 'Wayans', 'wiggle', 'way', 'ultra-secretive', 'best-of-the-best', 'military', 'commando', 'unit', 'know', 'really', 'want', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'bear.If', ""'re"", 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'read', 'more', 'CGI', 'Toy', 'Story', 'loved', 'Transformer', 'movies', 'then', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'like', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'shade', 'gray', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'significantly', 'better', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easily', 'replaced', 'mannequins', 'Overall', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'good', 'i.e', 'Miller', 'Nichols', 'form-fitting', 'cleavage-producing', 'outfits', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'fight', 'scenes', 'pile', 'garbage', 'i.e', 'acting', 'casting', 'CGI', 'plot', 'directing', '.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

1280556,A13BS9HAH2339E,B002NXSRVG,J. Combs,"[4, 6]","I'm one of the rare 30something guys that didn't really play with GI Joes or watch the cartoon, although I liked the comics (Marvel and Devils' Due versions), which had a more mature, complicated presentation of GI Joe, so I came into the movie without a strong childhood connection.  I'll split my review into Plot, Characters/Acting, and Visuals/Action.-Plot: First off, I could not help but notice how much of the plot was pulled from the Devils Due GI Joe comics; the nanomites and Destro's history are directly from it, which I liked because it added some extra depth. This is not a thoughtful, Dark Knight-esque movie, but a summer action film.  Despite that, the plot had some great twists and turns; character histories were also especially good. I liked the Duke/Baroness/Destro/""Doctor"" connections, and the Snake-Eyes/Storm Shadow history was well presented.  What was best though, was the presentation of Cobra. these are not the incompetents from the cartoon, they are brilliant, clever, and vicious.  They actually destroyed the Eiffel Tower for crying out loud!  Most action flick villains aren't that accomplished, so props to them for being successful.  There's also the very nice setup for the sequel that actually got me clapping. The only thing I did not like was confusion about who the Doctor was; I kept confusing him with Mindbender.  Sometimes it seems they tried to stuff too much into the film, but overall it didn't drag.-Characters/Acting: Getting some good actors helped out with this; Sienna Miller as the Baroness made the movie; she may not have had the accent, but the icy viciousness was there in spades, and makes glasses sexy.  I also liked Arnold Vosloo as Zartan, but he didn't get anywhere near enough screen time; hopefully that will change for the next movie.  The ninjas were both perfect.  As for Duke, I agree with others that he was pretty flat.  However, Duke was always the ""good guy"" who didn't really have a personality in the comics, so I partly think Tatum had nothing to work with.  The ""Doctor"" was on the other extreme; the Commander was always like that, but I felt it was done in a way that detracted, so the interactions between Duke and the Doctor were tough to take.  There were some good lines too; ""Duke wasn't born, he was government issued!"".-Visuals/Action: Very nice.  The CGI looked pretty good, and the explosions were aweseome; the car chase through Paris was a particularly good one, especially the part with the train.  Based on that scene alone, you know chars definitely get hurt in this movie!  The nanomites were pretty good.  Fight scenes were great, although I felt the Storm Shadow/Snake-Eyes fights should have been better and longer; I actually liked the fight between the kid versions of them better; no holds barred there!  The girlfight between Scarlett and the Baroness should go into the Top 5 Best Girlfights of all time, and really shows off how the female chars are some of the most dangerous chars in the movie.To conclude, GI Joe was an excellent action flick that contained some good plot (better than Transformers 2 anyway), did great homage/respect for  the established characters, and some very nice setups.  It's not thoughtful or brilliant, but does make for a good time.",4,Fun!,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3267,"[""'m"", 'one', 'rare', '30something', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'GI', 'Joes', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'liked', 'comics', 'Marvel', 'Devils', 'Due', 'versions', 'had', 'more', 'mature', 'complicated', 'presentation', 'GI', 'Joe', 'came', 'movie', 'strong', 'childhood', 'connection', ""'ll"", 'split', 'review', 'Plot', 'Characters/Acting', 'Visuals/Action.-Plot', 'First', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'how', 'much', 'plot', 'was', 'pulled', 'Devils', 'Due', 'GI', 'Joe', 'comics', 'nanomites', 'Destro', 'history', 'are', 'directly', 'liked', 'added', 'extra', 'depth', 'not', 'thoughtful', 'Dark', 'Knight-esque', 'movie', 'summer', 'action', 'film', 'plot', 'had', 'great', 'twists', 'turns', 'character', 'histories', 'were', 'also', 'especially', 'good', 'liked', 'Duke/Baroness/Destro/', 'Doctor', 'connections', 'Snake-Eyes/Storm', 'Shadow', 'history', 'was', 'well', 'presented', 'What', 'was', 'best', 'was', 'presentation', 'Cobra', 'are', 'not', 'incompetents', 'cartoon', 'are', 'brilliant', 'clever', 'vicious', 'actually', 'destroyed', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Most', 'action', 'flick', 'villains', 'are', ""n't"", 'accomplished', 'so', 'props', 'being', 'successful', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'setup', 'sequel', 'actually', 'got', 'clapping', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'confusion', 'who', 'Doctor', 'was', 'kept', 'confusing', 'Mindbender', 'tried', 'stuff', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag.-Characters/Acting', 'Getting', 'good', 'actors', 'helped', 'out', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'Baroness', 'made', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'accent', 'icy', 'viciousness', 'was', 'there', 'spades', 'glasses', 'sexy', 'also', 'liked', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Zartan', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'hopefully', 'will', 'change', 'next', 'movie', 'ninjas', 'were', 'perfect', 'Duke', 'agree', 'others', 'was', 'pretty', 'flat', 'However', 'Duke', 'was', 'always', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'personality', 'comics', 'partly', 'think', 'Tatum', 'had', 'nothing', 'work', 'Doctor', 'was', 'other', 'extreme', 'Commander', 'was', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'detracted', 'interactions', 'Duke', 'Doctor', 'were', 'tough', 'take', 'were', 'good', 'lines', 'too', 'Duke', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'was', 'government', 'issued', '.-Visuals/Action', 'Very', 'nice', 'CGI', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'explosions', 'were', 'aweseome', 'car', 'chase', 'Paris', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'especially', 'part', 'train', 'Based', 'scene', 'alone', 'know', 'chars', 'definitely', 'get', 'hurt', 'movie', 'nanomites', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'felt', 'Storm', 'Shadow/Snake-Eyes', 'fights', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'longer', 'actually', 'liked', 'fight', 'kid', 'versions', 'better', 'barred', 'girlfight', 'Scarlett', 'Baroness', 'should', 'go', 'Top', '5', 'Best', 'Girlfights', 'time', 'really', 'how', 'female', 'chars', 'are', 'most', 'dangerous', 'chars', 'movie.To', 'conclude', 'GI', 'Joe', 'was', 'excellent', 'action', 'flick', 'contained', 'good', 'plot', 'better', 'Transformers', '2', 'anyway', 'did', 'great', 'homage/respect', 'established', 'characters', 'very', 'nice', 'setups', 'not', 'thoughtful', 'brilliant', 'make', 'good', 'time']",N/A

He's a very talented actor and tries hard to be sinister and it does almost work but I also had a hard time trying not to laugh.

McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[2, 4]","Going into this movie I honestly thought it was going to be terrible move, maybe 1 star or worse, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. That being said I wouldn't pay to see it in the theater I'd wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it.The story was bad and had major plot holes or didn't make any sense, but what can you expect from a Stephen Sommers movie(As you can tell I really don't like the his directing/writing).The acting was decent with Dennis Quaid(General Hawk), Christopher Eccleston(Destro). He's also good in Doctor Who. Byung-hun Lee(Storm Shadow) and Ray Park(Snake Eyes). Though Sommers and the rest of the writers destroyed their great stories from they had from the cartoon and comics. As for everyone else from Channing Tatum to Marlon Wayans pretty much sucked.Action/Special Effects I thought were the best part of the film. The high not was the battle in Paris which was great. The other action scenes were visual good but weren't well executed especially the underwater one.Now for my tangent on the so call director Stephen Sommers. Back to my first question. Can Stephen Sommers direct, and the overwhelming evidence says NO!Lets look at the list of films he has directed.Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Van Helsing, and GI Joe. The only film that I though was above mediocre was The Mummy which I gave 3 1/2 stars. The rest were Mediocre to terrible.Now lets look at all the things he's written/screenplay.Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King, Van Helsing, and G.I. Joe. Again the only really decent film was The Mummy. Is he the worst director/writer out there of course not but he is really bad.Now if this movie manages to make enough money to garner a sequel. Which I truly think is in question. Here are a few things their going to need to do to bring me back.1. Get rid of Stephen Sommers. There are a lot better directors than him.2. Get rid of Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans. They were two of the worst actors in this film.3. Make the third film better. I'd say less is more. You don't have to have these over the top actions scenes to have make entertaining movie. Also add move depth to the characters like Snake Eyes, Scarlet and Destro.

Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[0, 3]","I initially had difficulty in rating this film, as there is much to be annoyed with it.At the top of the list are the obvious PC alterations to the GI Joe brand.*GI Joe is an AMERICAN special forces unit, but the film changes that to some UN force so as not to offend the sensibilities of the international market. (Yet, somehow movies about CIA operatives and the like are still successful, without having to change the CIA into Interpol.)* Cobra Commander's lame mask, because they were afraid that a hood would be offensive because it resembles a KKK hood. Cobra Commander is the TERRORIST leader! Who were they afraid of offending by making the terrorist look like a klansman? The KKK, or terrorists? Who else, after all, would be offended?* Channing Tatum's attitude (behind the scenes) of initially not wanting to do the movie so as not to glorify the military/war, yet changing his mind when it showed that the script was more akin to a superhero movie. Of course, the movie still had a high body count with a lot of bystanders getting injured/killed. Hey Channing, how many people do you think said, ""I'd love to see that kind of action,"" after seeing something like ""We Were Soldiers""? It's actually movies like this that glorify violence and make it look ""fun"".* The black guy portraying Ripcord, a white character. Why not have a black guy portray Stalker, one of the coolest of the original Joes? Because the name ""Stalker"" might offend.Then there were the poor ideas.* Snake-Eyes in a rubber suit with a mask with lips. What were they thinking?!?! Just put him in a regular, black colored uniform. Remove the lips. He looked like an oversized, alien muppet. And a vow of silence is why he can't speak? Why not leave the original story, that all others have used? He wears the mask and does not talk because he was disfigured in some explosion that damaged his vocal cords as well. (I mean, who is going to admit someone into an elite military force who refuses to talk?)* The accelerator suits. If they were just armored suits they would have been fine (or if used by Cobra), but making them run as fast as a car? That would rip your body apart if you had some outside force moving your limbs about that fast. (And why did the two rookies get these, while the experienced members of the team sit in the van?)So why the four stars?Well I have to admit, despite the above flaws, I did enjoy the movie.It works very well as a generic action/sci-fi movie and the plot (other than the PC changes) was actually well thought out. The bad guys actually had a clever plan and the twist was that it actually worked, despite the Commander ending up in custody at the end.So even though there are several aspects about this movie that make me, as a GIJoe fan, cringe (another being the Duke, Baroness, Destro love triangle), I am not such an absolute purist that it kept me from enjoying a fun, reasonably well acted (given what it is), and clever action flick.If you are one of the GI Joe fans that has refused to see this up till now, I would recommend taking a chance on it.

All his films had a certain zing and lots of humor, which sometimes worked like in ""The Mummy"" but other times it seemed forced rather than breezy.Now he brings the G.I. Joe franchise to the big screen and despite my early fears turned out to be the perfect blend of action, humor, nostalgia and of course bad acting. The film involves a group of bad guys working for an arms dealer named McCullen (Christopher Eccelston, ""The Others"") and Cobra (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, T.V.'s ""Third Rock From The Sun"" and ""500 Days of Summer"") trying to capture 4 warheads with nano-technology that can destroy any metal objects it comes into contact with.The good guys of course are a covert group named G.I. Joe, lead by General Hawk (Dennis Quiad, ""The Rookie""). He recruits two soldiers Duke (Channing Tatum, ""Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans, ""The Scary Movie"" franchise) who were on a covert mission to deliver the warheads when Cobra soldiers intercepted and captured em.There's a bit of a story here beyond that but not much, McCullen designed the warheads and wants to use them to control the world. There's also a side sotry with Duke and Ana aka The Baroness (Sienna Miller, ""Casanova"" and ""Stardust""), they were to be married but certain events caused their relationship to fall apart.There's also a character called Snake Eyes, a fully costumed master swordsman (Ray Park, Darth Maul in ""The Phantom Menace"") who has a score to settle with Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee). Other cool characters include Zartan (Arnold Vosloo, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"") and Scarlett (Rachel Nichols, ""The Amityville Horror""). Even Jonathan Pryce makes an appearance as the President of the U.S.There are problems like the shear unbelievable stunts, some of the writing goes beyond cheesy and is just bad and honestly Tatum is one of the most wooden actors besides Josh Harnett and Keanu Reeves.The good points are the action and pacing are both well done, the humor is dead on most of the time and for the guys (and statistically some of the girls) Miller and Nichols look beyond fantastic.

Unable to distinguish itself from other cinematic behemoths of the past few months - aside, perhaps, from its admirable ability to never take itself seriously - Sommers' tireless action romp feels stale this late in the game.The film consistently teeters on the edge of self-conscious family fun and uninspired, shallow flash that cant compensate for being late to the blockbuster party.That said, it's truly difficult to criticize Joe too much in the wake of a certain other summer juggernaut that used similar elements of enticement to lure audiences in, only to make them suffer through worthless side stories and slapstick comedy (I'm throwing tomatoes at YOU, Mr. Bay).  Here's two hours of film that knows what it is, and isn't afraid to work with what its got to the fullest extent.The acting, like the special effects, are merely satisfactory, with even Wayans looking surprisingly comfortable in a significant role.  While this is nothing to throw on the tag line, rest assured that everyone really does pull their weight in GI Joe.Still, there's certainly an air of obsolescence to Joe that is ultimately its biggest issue.

1280575,AWAXS66YMHMNW,B002NXSRVG,"J. Thomason ""Movie Family""","[0, 0]","G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Bowling for Movies Score: 165.938 of 300  (What's this bowling score business... check out the last paragraph or read my earlier reviews)Ok movie fans, let me start this one by telling your that I reviewed Snow White and the Huntsman a couple of days ago and the Amazon-Spam-Finding-Bot (pronounced amazon-spam-finding-bought in the US and amazon-spam-finding-butt in Canada) bounced it back to me as REJECTED because I assume my reviews have to this time all been made from the same template and a robot(robutt) apparently isn't into quasi/pseudo-scientific movie reviews, so I guess I have to mix them all up.  I haven't felt that blue over a rejection since my sophomore year in high school when I walked up to the gal who lived two doors down from my house's locker and said, ""Hey - me, you, my car... what do you say?"" only in a moment of adolescent panic it sounded more like, ""So, have you read any good books lately?"" (to which the answer was no).  Any way around it, I guess I will just have to be more creative in the future (or amazon spam robutts will have to get more intelligent and then they have the real chance of taking over the world and wage war on humankind (no more boxes in the mail with smiles on them).  What does this have to do with G.I. Joe you might ask - um, nothing.Movie in the Quick:Beefy military dude with a boo-boo under his eye (convenient reminder of a bad day) and his too intelligent to tell such bad jokes side-kid get their butts kicked by super villains but it's all ok because it gets them in a super elite multi-national fighting force - G.I. Joes.  Pretty standard 3 parts action 1 part bad joke ensues until SUPRIZE twist (which I won't tell you) which actually surprised me (which I will tell you, it did, it did) and a mediocre movie gets suddenly way better right towards the end.Overall:This movie did pretty good (not great, not bad) at the box office and critics did what critics will do (mainly not like good movies, and praise bad ones).  By-in-large the first 2/3 of this movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  Loads of action.  Action all over the place.  The CGI is what you'd expect for a movie which ran $175m aaaand the story wasn't half bad.  I personally enjoyed the backstories of most the main characters.  Hey now, if you're a `true blue' G.I. Joe fan I get it... really I get it - they tweaked with the mythos, they twisted the storylines, the twanged on the universe - but (fortunately) I really wasn't all that into G.I. Joe as a youngster and wouldn't have known if y'all didn't make such a fuss.  It does give one pause that people come out of the woodwork to complain about things such as that and then pay out the nose to see what the latest Batman reboot has done (Batman Reboot 17 - this time he's 33% more dark than before).  So, I digress :]  The story was fine, I liked the visuals, I didn't mind the actors... (what's wrong movie dude, why such a middle of the road score?)  Well, I'll tell you - the acting is bad.  No, let me clear that up and make it a paragraph all its own:The acting is really very very bad... Buffy The Vampire Slayer bad... Gilligan's Island bad... and it's across the board (not just Dennis Quaid this time)So I have to ask the question, how could it be that Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (to name a few) delivered such a plastic action figure like performance?  Channing isn't a favorite but I've seen him do better - Marlon's portrayal of Ripcord was nearly offensive as the funny sidekick (I kept waiting for him to say ""Now that's Whack!), and Adewale is downright TERRIFYING in Strike Back... these aren't bad actors... what happen?  I can only assume it's how the director, Stephen Sommers wanted it.  You'd think in this day and age somebody would have told him (hey, spt... ya, Stephen... duuuude, I watched the daily and um, it's kind of bad - like Buffy the Vampire Slayer bad...).  I guess the jokes on me though, he laughed all the way to the bank - and there is hope that Jon Chu will do a better job in the much anticipated sequel... well much anticipated here because it's supposed to show up next week in 3D (check back for a bowling score for it!)The good:Great pace and full of action - my glutes got an excellent work out - although there may be some post-movie clenching/crampingOut of no-where (but it should have been obvious) twist 2/3 of the way thru... good golly I did a Scooby Doo double take (and then got a Scooby Snack for my efforts).The bad:The acting... cardboard is more enthusiasticThe Ugly:Anything Ripcord said that was supposed to be funnyThe Movie Bowling Scoring System:Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]  I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",3,G.I.

1280577,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B002NXSRVG,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 0]","G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra: 7 out of 10: I think I may have liked this movie less had I not recently sat through the two and a half hour opus that is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. GI Joe is like Transformers with a coherent plot and a half an hour of stupid removed. (Notice I said half an hour not all.)First, let us get the ugly out of the way. GI Joe is no longer 'A Real American Hero' instead it is a group of foreigners led by Dennis Quaid and answerable to well nobody as far as I can tell. While I understand the change from a cowardly international marketing point of view, it really is a sad state of affairs. However, since all the real heroes turn out to be Americans after all and the bad guys are mostly foreigners from despot countries like Scotland and Japan, it is less jarring of a change than one would suppose.If you can get past the fact the GI Joe Corps is a secret international army (no doubt enforcing the upcoming one world order), has weapons more advanced than the US troops and yet is still inexplicably called GI JOE. (I had assumed at some point Dennis Quaid would declare it is a lame acronym such as Global Initiative something something Expedition alas to his credit he does not.) You still have to deal with some of the casting choices.While I am not overly familiar with the GI Joe mythos, I did see a major flaw on the Joe side. Channing Tatum simply does not look or act like Duke. Now Duke is the main character and everyman of the Joes. If you are familiar with the Duke Nukem videogame, think that guy with less one-liners and titty bar visits. Channing simply does not have the charisma or presence to pull of the character and the script does not give him much help.The other character the script torpedoes is The Baroness. She is the bad girl of the GI Joe universe and is played brilliantly by Sienna Miller (It really helps to hire great actors for these roles sometimes). The storyline unfortunately softens the Baroness to the point that by the end Duke is carrying her out of the exploding bad guys headquarters in his arms. (The bad guys lose. I hope that is not a spoiler in a movie called G.I. Joe)The other main characters are well represented. Marlon Wayans plays the black comic relief in the form of Ripcord (Dukes buddy). Normally I am aghast at the ethnic comic relief but Wayans pulls it off with aplomb. Rachel Nichols might seem a strange choice to play a smart woman, but she certainly looks the part and the whole Scarlett is an intellectual meme has clearly been toned down. She and Wayans have a romance that while safe for the kids may make adults in the audience dislocate their ciliary muscle.Rounding out the cast is a bunch of foreigners, Dennis Quaid, Jonathan Pryce as the President and an uncredited Brendan Fraser.The movie has a videogame feel and I mean that in the most complementary way. The weapons are out of a Sci-fi shooter. The Joes wear suits cribbed directly from the videogame Crackdown (Complete with the same powers); the very well shot action sequence in Paris will be quite familiar to any old school players of Twisted Metal 2.The finale is right out of any Roger Moore James Bond film. This is old school fun action, well shot, with a plot a seven year old could follow. There is some back-story and attempts at depth, but needless to say it is perfectly safe to turn your brain off for a few hours and enjoy the show.The plot is as follows. Bad guys steal evil weapon (Nanobite missiles). Good Guys get weapons back. Bad guys invade good guys headquarters killing cute blond and stealing missiles, Bad guys use missiles on unimportant foreign city (Paris) to show they mean business. Good Guys have their badges take away and are ordered to report to base. Good guys go to bad guys base instead. Good guys destroy bad guys underwater Arctic base by blowing up the icecap causing the underwater base to be crushed by the falling ice... hold on... falling ice????Yes, apparently in the GI Joe universe the concept that ice floats is just another unproven liberal egghead theory like evolution or the female orgasm. I guess that is what happens when you have a redheaded bimbo play your science officer. (Moreover, do not get me started on the chasing ballistic missiles with an airplane part.)The stupid is strong in this one... but so is the fun.",4,G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra...

1280578,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002NXSRVG,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[8, 13]","Due to the great success from parlaying their Transformers toy line and various animated series' into box office gold, it was only a matter of time before toymaker Hasbro decided to try their luck with yet another of their long-standing toy brands, namely G.I. Joe. However, unlike the overwhelming sense of excitement I had when I saw the various trailers for both of the ""Transformers"" films, not to mention the actual films themselves; those heralding the forthcoming release of ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" were severely underwhelming to say the least. Despite a low amount of interest in the movie, I did finally get around to seeing it recently. Not surprisingly, much like my reaction to the film's trailers which were steeped in great disappointment; the actual experience of the movie itself was nothing short of an utter disaster, just on a much bigger scale than even I had anticipated.""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is essentially summed up by the title. Basically, an evil organization known as Cobra is attempting to become one of the deadliest terrorist cells on the planet. After a dangerous new weapon falls into Cobra's hands the world has only one hope for survival...G.I. Joe. A powerful covert military group, G.I. Joe is comprised of the very best operatives this world has ever seen, and when all else fails, they don't.Well, whenever a movie is this unabashedly bad the number of complaints that one can level against it can be quite staggering. Don't worry, I'll do my best to not bore you by listing every single one of them, but I will touch upon numerous problems along the way. So, the best thing to do is to just start at the backbone for the movie's failures... the story.The screenplay from writers Stuart Beattie (""30 Days of Night"") and David Elliot & Paul Lovett (""Four Brothers""), all of whom have written far better films than this one, goes wrong in almost every way imaginable. Since the troubled areas for this movie's story are virtually all-encompassing, one could easily surmise that the writers never wanted to pen the movie in the first place. To be honest, if someone did have that thought (which I did), I don't honestly believe you would be that far from the truth.For a movie based on a continually successful toy line and an animated series that shaped many a child of the 80's, I was extremely disappointed in the paint by numbers approach the story took. The entire film felt like the writers were simply ticking off items on a checklist; for example, working in numerous classic lines of dialogue from the animated series (which sound extremely cheesy nowadays)... check, vehicles... check, iconic characters... check, and borrowing ideas from movies ten times better than this one... check. The problem with this approach is that none of it ever gelled in a natural fashion; instead, it all felt shoe-horned into the story to meet some sort of quota of G.I. Joe references and affiliations. Honestly, if more time had been spent on polishing up the dialogue, building up character development, and creating an actually interesting plot, then perhaps ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" could have been an entertaining movie, or at least had the potential to be one.The cast for this film was sub-par at best, which is sad when you realize that it was comprised of several very talented actors and actresses. Together this assemblage of assorted talents should have been able to offer up something better than what was put up on the screen, regardless of the irredeemable script. However, the majority of the cast members' performances felt stilted and uninspired, which by no means elevated the movie's already low entertainment value.Then there's the fact that I found myself surprised by certain actors' presence in a movie so obviously inferior to some of their previous films. For those that are curious, the cast members I was most disappointed in were Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who has proven himself to be quite the talented actor with intensely dramatic roles in films such as ""The Lookout""), Dennis Quaid (who apparently was in dire need of a paycheck is my guess), and Channing Tatum (whose role in ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" earned him critical notice at Sundance Film Festival). These three actors, and a few others I didn't mention, all should have known better than to sign on to this movie. To make matters worse, most of the cast members, including the aforementioned, have signed for sequels, so they are stuck for the foreseeable future in what looks to be a horribly ill-conceived franchise.On the other hand, some of the other cast members I wasn't as disappointed in, for various reasons. Comedian and actor Marlon Wayans (""Scary Movie"") does his level best to provide as many comedic moments in the movie as humanly possible, most likely in some doomed attempt to distract from the idiocy occurring everywhere else in the film. The problems with Marlon's character of Ripcord were numerous, but a couple of them would be the fact that his humor fell flat almost 90% of the time and the only real similarity this incarnation shares with his animated counterpart is the fact that he's an accomplished pilot. The reason Marlon didn't disappoint me was because I had no real expectations for him. I mean, consider his body of work, there's not much there to really be proud of, in my opinion.As for the actresses in the film, Sienna Miller (""Stardust"") and Rachel Nichols (""Star Trek"") added very little to the story other than the obvious eye candy for the predominantly male audience. I can say this about the two female leads, while their performances weren't impressive, they did excel in the aforementioned area that their presence was geared towards from the get-go. So at least in that respect, they did not disappoint either.Lastly, Ray Park's character of Snake Eyes was the sole member of the cast of characters that I was actually intrigued by. What makes this kind of humorous to me is the fact that he is never given any lines to speak; which is probably what allowed him to remain interesting. I almost feel sorry for Ray Park, because yet again his prowess with weapons and martial arts are the only reasons he was even included in the cast (other examples of this would be ""Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" and ""Sleepy Hollow""). If this were the silent era of films the man could be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood rather than a glorified stuntman. You know, if the acting gigs ever dry up, perhaps he should consider becoming a mime. Then if someone didn't pay enough attention to him he could beat the snot out of them. Seems like a plausible scenario to me.Even though my expectations for this film were low from the very beginning, I thought that at least the movie's visual effects would stand some chance of impressing me. My belief that because the film was being directed by Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy""), that the movie's effects would be solid throughout was completely misplaced. I knew that from the previews a few of the scenes looked a little on the weaker side, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the off-chance that perhaps these were early cuts of the scenes that hadn't been fully finished at the time. However, shortly into my viewing of this movie I became well aware that much like the rest of the experience; the CGI would also prove to be an area of extreme weakness.The film utilized multiple effects houses, as is often the case with big budget blockbusters, so pinpointing one effects house as the source of the film's visual shortcomings is difficult. However, from what I can gather, it does appear that Digital Domain has been tagged as being responsible for the lion's share of the work in the film. That being the case, I feel it's only fair for me to hold them accountable for the majority of the abhorrently bad visual effects.What makes this failure on the part of Digital Domain even more shocking, in my mind, is the fact that their body of work has been downright stunning in past films. For example, they took part in some of the recent summer blockbusters; such as ""Star Trek"" and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". So, my question Digital Domain is this, ""What went so horribly wrong with your work on this film?"" One visual effects trouble-spot was whenever CGI stunt doubles were being used. The lack of weight in their movements made them stand out like a sore thumb, and left me frustrated with just how unrealistic they appeared. Other problematic areas would be most of the shots involving various G.I. Joe or Cobra vehicles in action or completely CGI created set pieces that lacked any sense of realism. What this all boils down to is that almost every single visual effects shot in this film looked shoddy, and in my opinion there is just no excuse for this to be allowed given the capabilities we see on display in movies these days.So, what did I take away from this experience? Not a whole lot, aside from a newfound understanding of just how ridiculous some of those classic lines from the animated series really were or that the name G.I. Joe makes me laugh due to how comical it sounds. But seriously, this movie is a poor excuse for a summer blockbuster, and the fact that it can't even qualify as a guilty pleasure speaks volumes to just how horrible this movie is.""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1,"This Movie is Terrible, and Knowing is Half the Battle...",1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,9410,"['Due', 'great', 'success',

So any change to the series I remember so fondly is tough. They had to run a fine line with this movie, appeal to those who loved and know GI Joe, while appealing to those who just wanted to see a good movie. I think the biggest problem I had with Rise of the Cobra is they tried to do too much with it. It is a fine line to create a movie based on a much loved and nostalgic comic/cartoon and do it in a modern way. I am all for updating and even a change in continuity if it helps the series and over all story, but I didn't get that from Rise of the Cobra. What I saw was a poor story, over acting, under acting and so much scene chewing it made me hungry and I had to make a trip to the lobby. The biggest issue is they took away so much of what made GI Joe unique. Forced multiculturalness, drastic changes to beloved characters, and the inability to tell if they wanted to make an action movie or a comedy. They had good actors and a lot of money to make this, with a better story and better direction this could have been great. If you haven't seen it yet I'd say to pass and if you really want to see an updated and adult version of GI Joe, then the animated GI Joe Resolute does the job so much better than this mess.

That said is pretty much what i expected but better. As far as comic, toy and superhero movies go this one is a winner, and compared to Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen, this one is a work of art.",4,"Hey, not bad at all!",1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,750,"['Ok', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'not', 'something', 'Oscars', 'not', 'bad', 'Visually', 'movies', 'fine', 'good', 'sfx', 'good', 'designs', 'atmosphere', 'costumes', 'looked', 'good', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'mask', 'truly', 'stupid', 'joe', 'armor', 'suits', 'bulky', 'complicated', 'something', 'more', 'Iron', 'Man', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'acting', 'well', 'good', 'enough', 'material', 'only', 'bad', 'part', 'was', 'whole', 'Paris', 'chase', 'secuence', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'good', 'guys', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'more', 'damage', 'bad', 'ones', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'i', 'expected', 'better', 'As', 'far', 'comic', 'toy', 'superhero', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'winner', 'compared', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'one', 'work', 'art']",N/A
1280591,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B002NXSRVG,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 3]","My wife and I recently made plans to go check out a movie with another couple.  When differences arose on which movie we were to see, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" became the choice of compromise.  Despite having played with G.I. Joe toys and watching the cartoon series when I was young, I fully planned to wait for this film to hit the DVD shelves before I watched it.  There just wasn't anything too appealing about it based on the previews.Having now viewed it I must say that it was a pleasant surprise.The plot is rather simple.  In this film, James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), an arms dealer with a checkered family history, joins forces with a sinister scientist known only as The Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the duo plan to take over the world by threatening it with nanomite weapons.  These weapons can literally eat through metal (and pretty much everything else).  When a convoy of these weapons, led by two soldiers codenamed Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), is attacked and the nano-weapons are stolen, the international force known as G.I. Joe is sent to retrieve them.From that point on, the film is basically one CGI-laced battle after another.  Fight sequences go from the Joe headquarters to France to the icy waters of the North Pole.  Hand-to-hand combat, ""accelerator"" suits, ninjas, computerized crossbows, etc. all take center stage as the action spills out on the screen.Like many other big-budget action yarns this film suffers in a number of areas.  Heading the list of things that are wrong with this film is Channing Tatum.  He tries to come across as a leader but instead looks more like a lightweight John Cena (WWE).  Tatum ain't no Duke, and his performance here goes to show that his poor delivery in ""Havoc"" was no misstep on his part.  Another thing wrong with this film is the fact that it's covered in cheese.  Granted, it's based on a toyline from the 80's, but it would have been nice if the film had been taken a bit more seriously.  Otherwise, the scriptwriters should have gotten rid of some of the strong language and aimed for a more kid-friendly PG rating.I also found that despite the busy nature of the film, it was rather boring at times.  With little character development, it became nothing more than a ""that explosion was cool, but wait until you see the next one"" series of CGI sequences.There's plenty that's bad about this film, but there is also quite a bit that is good.  As nothing more than an action film, it works wonders.  The CGI does look excellent and the numerous vehicles and weapons that are used in the film turned out great.Although Tatum was miscast as Duke, the majority of the other characters were given decent representations.  Mired in bad one-liners, Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as Hawk.  Christopher Eccleston is sufficient as McCullen/Destro, but much like Quaid he has to swim his way through bad writing.  Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) gives one of the best performances in the film, and Said Taghmaoui is quite enjoyable as Breaker.  Sienna Miller filled out the Baroness' black suit quite well, but her delivery was only average.Other actors who did quite well were Ray Park as the silent and deadly Snake Eyes, Lee Byung-hun as Snake Eyes' arch enemy, Stormshadow and Arnold Vosloo in a small but sinister role as Zartan.Two actors in particular deserve kudos for their performances in this film.  When I first saw that Marlon Wayans was going to portray Ripcord, I immediately smelled a stinky film.  However, Wayans does surprisingly well as the humorous Ripcord.  Deserving even more praise is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Although he wasn't perfect as the Doctor/Cobra Commander, he has shown marked improvement from his ""Havoc"" and ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" days.  He was a pleasant surprise.There are also a few old faces that pop up.  Director Stephen Sommers reached deep into his ""The Mummy"" bag and pulled out Vosloo, Brendan Fraser in a cameo role and Kevin J. O'Connor as Dr. Mindbender.  Screen veteran Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Twelve Monkeys"") plays the President of the United States.Overall, ""G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra"" is a mixed bag of great action sequences and solid individual performances weighed down by a poor choice for a leading man, a dull script and too much focus on the ""wow"" factor.  If you like pop, sizzle, and bang in your movies, ""Joe"" is an excellent film to check out.  If you expect your films to develop a little bit more and not rely on CGI to cover up weaknesses, you might want to stay away from ""The Rise of Cobra.""  Mildly recommended to action fans.  I'll probably buy it once it's been out on DVD awhile and the price goes down.",3,"Lots Of Explosions, Plenty Of Noise, Not Much Else",1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,4716,"['wife', 'recently', 'made', 'plans', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'couple', 'When', 'differences', 'arose', 'movie', 'were', 'see', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'became', 'choice', 'compromise', 'having', 'played', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'toys', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'fully', 'planned', 'wait', 'film', 'hit', 'DVD', 'watched', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'too', 'appealing', 'based', 'previews.Having', 'now', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'film', 'James', 'McCullen', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'arms', 'dealer', 'checkered', 'family', 'history', 'forces', 'sinister', 'scientist', 'known', 'only', 'Doctor', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'duo', 'plan', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'threatening', 'nanomite', 'weapons', 'weapons', 'can', 'literally', 'eat', 'metal', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'When', 'convoy', 'weapons', 'led', 'two', 'soldiers', 'codenamed', 'Duke', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Ripcord', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'attacked', 'nano-weapons', 'are', 'stolen', 'international', 'force', 'known', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'them.From', 'point', 'film', 'basically', 'one', 'CGI-laced', 'battle', 'Fight', 'sequences', 'go', 'Joe', 'headquarters', 'France', 'icy', 'waters', 'North', 'Pole', 'Hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'accelerator', 'suits', 'ninjas', 'computerized', 'crossbows', 'etc', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'action', 'out', 'screen.Like', 'many', 'other', 'big-budget', 'action', 'film', 'suffers', 'number', 'areas', 'Heading', 'list', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'film', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'come', 'leader', 'instead', 'more', 'lightweight', 'John', 'Cena', 'WWE', 'Tatum', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Duke', 'performance', 'here', 'show', 'poor', 'delivery', 'Havoc', 'was', 'misstep', 'part', 'thing', 'wrong', 'film', 'fact', 'covered', 'cheese', 'Granted', 'based', 'toyline', '80', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'bit', 'more', 'seriously', 'Otherwise', 'scriptwriters', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'rid', 'strong', 'language', 'aimed', 'more', 'kid-friendly', 'PG', 'rating.I', 'also', 'found', 'busy', 'nature', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'boring', 'times', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'became', 'nothing', 'more', 'explosion', 'was', 'cool', 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'series', 'CGI', 'plenty', 'bad', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'good', 'nothing', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'wonders', 'CGI', 'look', 'excellent', 'numerous', 'vehicles', 'weapons', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'great.Although', 'Tatum', 'was', 'miscast', 'Duke', 'majority', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'decent', 'representations', 'Mired', 'bad', 'one-liners', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'good', 'performance', 'Hawk', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'sufficient', 'McCullen/Destro', 'much', 'Quaid', 'swim', 'way', 'bad', 'writing', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Scarlett', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Breaker', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'filled', 'out', 'Baroness', 'black', 'suit', 'quite', 'well', 'delivery', 'was', 'only', 'average.Other', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'were', 'Ray', 'Park', 'silent', 'deadly', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Stormshadow', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'small', 'sinister', 'role', 'Zartan.Two', 'actors', 'particular', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'performances', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'was', 'going', 'portray', 'Ripcord', 'immediately', 'smelled', 'stinky', 'film', 'However', 'Wayans', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'humorous', 'Ripcord', 'Deserving', 'even', 'more', 'praise', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Doctor/Cobra', 'Commander', 'shown', 'marked', 'improvement', 'Havoc', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'days', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise.There', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'old', 'pop', 'up', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'reached', 'deep', 'Mummy', 'bag', 'pulled', 'out', 'Vosloo', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'cameo', 'role', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'Dr.', 'Mindbender', 'Screen', 'veteran', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'President', 'United', 'States.Overall', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'mixed', 'bag', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'solid', 'individual', 'performances', 'weighed', 'down', 'poor', 'choice', 'leading', 'man', 'dull', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'wow', 'factor', 'like', 'pop', 'sizzle', 'bang', 'movies', 'Joe', 'excellent', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'expect', 'films', 'develop', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'not', 'rely', 'CGI', 'cover', 'up', 'weaknesses', 'might', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'Mildly', 'recommended', 'action', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'been', 'out', 'DVD', 'awhile', 'price', 'down']",N/A

If you had high expectations like I did, for the summer flick WOLVERINE ORGINS and was sent crashing down, then give this film a try. IT KICKS MAJOR BUTT. There is non-stop action, in many ways it's like X-MEN meets STAR WARS meets LEAGUE OF EXTRODINARY GENTLEMEN. I was blown away by this film. Are you getting the picture that I actually liked it? First of all for being based on a toy franchise and a cartoon, this film exceeds expectations. It is melodramatic, cheesey in some aspects but when it comes down to it you have to been an idiot to realize that it makes the movie that much more fun to watch. Dennis Quaid gives a very hammed up performance as the commander or general, of the Joes. Everytime he spoke I couldn't help but smile to myself. The actress who played the Baroness was by far my favorite. For you parents who might be considering this film for your kids. There is some very low mild language. I think the worse that I actually heard or was made to notice is the word p*ssed off. There is an incredible amout of action violence but if you have already let the kids see SPIDERMAN, X-MEN, STAR WARS EPISODE III, then you should feel safe showing them this film. In some aspect I feel that this film could grow to be a cult classic. As far as the storyline, there are actually a few suprises that I did not see coming.

1280603,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B002NXSRVG,Leif Sheppard,"[0, 0]","""G.I. Joe"", much like last years""Transformers""sequel, is an action film of the most common denominator. It's bright, flashy, loud, occasionally obnoxious and rife with eye-rolling stabs at inducing laughter. Yet whereas ""Transformers"" could be genuinely funny, ""G.I. Joe"" seems painfully unaware that its attempts at crowd pleasing humor almost always fall flat. For starters, the two leads are grossly miscast. Channing Tatum, who portrays Duke, is the lesser offender. Though he certainly looks the part of a square-jawed All-American soldier, he's among the most wooden actors I've ever seen in a massive-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Eternal twelve year old Leonardo DiCaprio could act circles around this guy, and that's saying something! But though Tatum may be lacking in versatility and range, he makes up for these shortcomings in that he's a likeable enough fellow. So much so that I wouldn't mind a whit seeing Tatum star in a sequel. Besides, let's face it, a film based off a toy line and Saturday morning cartoon doesn't exactly require Daniel Day Lewis types.By far the worst component here is Marlon Wayans as Ripcord. Considering the character is intended as comic relief and a foil to Duke's more straight-laced gung-ho soldiering, I can understand the producers felt compelled to cast someone with a background in comedy. Unfortunately, Wayans is as hammy as a club sandwich and a terrible actor to boot. Despite a packed theatre, nearly every one of his flimsy jabs at humor failed miserably (though one joke in particular, uttered when Duke proposed to Ana, elicited a fair amount of laughs). The dialog exchanges between Duke and Ripcord is b-movie quality weak, particularly at the beginning of the film. The bulk of their banter is composed of jokes we've heard many times before, jokes that were lame the first time told. This exchange is particularly weak:Ripcord: ""You know Duke, I've been thinking...""Duke: ""What have I told you about that?""Ripcord: ""...I've already submitted an application.""Duke: ""They take those in crayon?""The one clever, nearly hilarious joke involving Ripcord actually has nothing to do with Wayans' performance. When donning his advanced Delta 6 suit, he's told the equipment has integrated artificial intelligence that will respond to whatever he's thinking. Instantly, images of Scarlett (who Ripcord is deeply attracted to), flash across his helmet visor. But that's the one solid moment of humor, otherwise this goofy interpretation of Ripcord is one of the films weakest points, and though he'll probably be a hit with children, for anyone older than twelve he'll come across as naught but irritating.The action setpieces, which are certainly the main draw of ""G.I. Joe"", are absolutely flawless. So much so that this was my fourth favorite action-oriented film released last year. The majority of those who didn't enjoy the film either didn't see the trailer or were under some sort of strange impression they were going to see an Oscar contender. The straight action is sole reason to see this film. The two best, most memorable action sequences include an excellent assault on the Joes headquarters and a lighting-fast race to save the Eiffel Tower from the nefarious Baroness and Storm Shadow. Most of the Joe favorites are here, including: Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Destro, Cobra Commander, Cover Girl, Zartan, General Hawk, and Heavy Duty among others. Each one of these characters is well cast and even resemble their cartoon counterparts quite well (particularly Dennis Quaid as General Hawk and Sienna Miller as the Baroness).I appreciate, however, that the crew didn't feel it vital to strictly adhere to the comic book and cartoon interpretations of these characters. Had they done that, the Zartan character would almost assuredly look hilariously absurd! I've noticed many reviewers have complained that there's ""too many"" characters, but that's part of the fun of a film adaptation of comic book material like G.I. Joe or""X-Men"". If anything, I found myself wanting to see more characters, and cannot wait to see the new ones that will feature in the sequel. The G.I. Joe universe has a host of novel players to utilize, including my personal favorites Shipwreck, Gung Ho, Dial Tone, Flint, and Dusty. Will any of those feature in the sequel? Time will tell.One of the producers, prior to the release, stated that all the futuristic technology featured in the film (including the nearly invisible camoflage clothing and variants of the Delta 6 suits) was a mere ten to twenty years away from being reality. This is true for the most part, adding a small dose of authenticity to what is, admittedly, a very silly testosterone-fueled explosion-fest. The most prominent technological fantasy invention would have to be Destro's missiles which feature sophisticated nanotechnology. Speaking of fantastical inventions, one of the most bizarre scenes is when Breaker attempts to use a device to read the final thoughts of a deceased baddie. He jabs two poles into the corpse's head and uses a cell phone sized device to attempt to scan the dying memories. As if that isn't enough, we watch as the body rather gruesomely decomposes in mere seconds due to a self-termination device implanted in him, also using the same nanomites the missiles use.There are numerous flashback sequences between Duke and the Baroness and between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow that add a modicum of depth to the story. The Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow feud goes way back to the comic books, though here (perhaps in the interest of time) it's reduced to something much more simplistic. I'm not well versed in G.I. Joe canon, so I don't know if it's been previously established that Duke and the Baroness had a relationship, but its a great story element to help tie the characters together. There's even a grand flashback piece at the very beginning of the film that adds some intrigue to Destro's story. The pace of the film is never ruined by these flashback scenes, which is a difficult feat to be certain. As the film's byline states, this is the ""Rise of Cobra"", so I hope that in the sequel we get to see an entrenched, organized Cobra military as opposed to the mostly freelance gang of mercenaries featured in this film.Ultimately, ""G.I. Joe"" will not be remembered as a great film, but I feel genuine pity for someone who cannot watch a film such as this and simply have a great time. The plot is typically simplistic, involving the tried-and-true ""protect the valuable object"" scenario we've seen in countless other recent films (such as""Eragon""and""Babylon A.D."", off the top of my head). Still, though the story may not be terribly complex, it's well told and doesn't detract. Well, except perhaps for one of the final scenes, in which Cobra Commander and Destro don goofy-looking helmets and share an evil cackle together. Yes, Mr. Screenwriter, as much as we appreciated the numerous nods to the classic cartoons, some things should've been left in those cartoons. Hopefully in the sequel we'll see a more involving tale, because even though this film may be explicitly targeted at the young, a handful of blockbusters have proved general audiences can handle a slightly more complicated story, such as""Mission Impossible""or""The Dark Knight"".I feel it prudent to stress again that, at times, ""G.I. Joe"" is nearly unbearably stupid. Keep in mind that the film is merely a vehicle for exciting action sequences, and as that, it's an absolute success. Those sequences are tight, frenetic and well choreographed. This is, of course, the primary reason one should see the film to begin with. More than that, it's a memorable film, which is more than I can say for some recent action flicks such as""Bangkok Dangerous""or""The Spirit"". In summation: if you have a hearty appetite for action and are willing to shut off your brain for two hours, there's not a single dull moment in ""G.I. Joe"".",4,"Knowing is, indeed, half the battle. . .",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,7928,"['G.I', 'Joe', 'much', 'last', 'years', 'Transformers', 'sequel', 'action', 'film', 'most', 'common',

I couldn't believe it because if there was any movie that is pro America I would think it'd be GI JOE The All American Hero! Having watched the film, I can now see their point. It wasn't anti american, but there was a coldness to the film. The dark body outfits, the lack of display for the American flag, recruiting members from around the globe rather than using America's Finest soldiers... it seemed to stray from the original concept. Films are increasingly becoming way too dependent on CGI and having futuristic advanced technology in storylines to push a film, and its a shame. The storylines are suffering as a result. I also have to say the acting in this film is as bad as other reviewers state. ITs watchable, but there are cringe worthy moments. Not entirely the fault of the actors though since the dialogue throughout the film is too simplistic. I never watched the cartoon series, but I have to say the most interesting characters in the film were the ninja characters, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes. I did enjoy their childhood flashbacks and if this film gets a sequel, Id like to see them play bigger roles. As a kid, I do remember the Baroness character being much more devilish, stronger and having more of a dominant presence than this horrible choice of an actress picked for this film. Its like they recruited actors from The Hills to play these parts. In spite of all the complaints, it was still something Id watch again just for the sake of having something to watch.

Brief Movie review (just a quick take on it)First off, the Blu Ray of this movie is awesome!  Crystal clear, great sound and smooth.  Loved it on my plasma TV, but it looks even better on my friends LCD screen.  The scenes literally come off the screen and he does not have 3D on the TV!  Get this Blu Ray!  It deserves room on your shelf.Next, a quick review of the movie itself.I went to see this in the theater expecting it to be total trash and very surprised.  It's pure fun and very entertaining.  It delivers, period.  Yes, it has a few corny lines, but people, this is an fun action movie, not a love story, not a serious drama or theater.  You see this to have some fun.  I suspect there are many GI Joe fans that felt disappointed by this movie because they haven't grown up yet.  Yes those people that still have their action figures, the GI Joe underwear, or the action figure with the kung fu grip (ok that one is cool) and probably went to this movie looking for a serious GI Joe movie.  Come on!  Grow up!For example, the entire action sequence in France was a blast in the movie theater and great on Blu Ray with surround sound!  The whole movie is just plain fun with great action, special effects and good imagination.Is it perfect?  Hell no!  It's no Blade Runner or Empire Strikes Back, but what it is is just pure entertainment.  It has a high replay value and if you are a fan of action movie, this Blu Ray deserves room on your shelf.And if you don't like it, then sell your copy on Ebay and go back to watching the old Gi Joe cartoons while being wrapped up in your GI Joe blanket, in your GI Joe underwear and have Mommy tuck you in with a Kung Fu Grip shot to the head ;-)Really, just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is...fun!I do hope that they keep the same actors and director for the next release and can't wait to see it!

1280623,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002NXSRVG,Mark Turner,"[3, 7]","Movie makers are always looking for sources to create films from. More so than that, they're looking for movies that can become franchises, turning a single film into a multi-million dollar money making machine. Sometimes they do so at the cost of a good film resulting in the franchise dying. Other times they make a movie that does so well, that hits all the right notes, that they have a sure fire hit. Such is the case with G.I.JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA.Based on what was first a toy from Hasbro and then a hit TV cartoon series, the creators here led by director Stephen Sommers (of THE MUMMY fame) have transformed those original ideas into a fantastic action film. When the term pulse pounding action is used, this is the movie you should think of.The film opens in the past with a weapons developer and a look at the McCullen clan founder whose current descendant James (Christopher Eccleston) has just turned over a new weapon to U.N. This weapon uses nanomites, nearly invisible robots, to destroy and eat metal. Leading the convoy transporting the weapons is a top Special Forces team led by Duke (Channing Tatum).Attacked by a secret villainous team led by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), an ex-flame of Duke, the team (or what's left of it) is rescued by an elite group known as G.I. Joe, led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Sticking with his orders, Duke and fellow team mate Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) stay with their package.Arriving at the Joe's secret headquarters, they request to join the team and are given the chance once it becomes known Duke knows the Baroness. After a brief training period, they become part time members. But a tracking device on the weapons case switched on by McCullen has led his team to the Joe base and they attack using both special operatives infected with the nanomites and martial arts expert Storm Shadow (Byun-hung Lee) with the Baroness.The weapons taken, Gen. Hawk wounded, the team goes into full blown rescue mode as they track the weapons to France. With the help of super powered armor that enhances all abilities (as well as containing some high tech fire power), the team tries to reclaim the weapons before they can be used. They fail and (as seen in previews) the Eiffel Tower falls.With only one chance left to recapture the weapons and take on this new enemy, later to be called Cobra, the team sets out to save the world. Will they make it in time? Will they have sufficient weapons to do so? Does the sun rise in the east?This movie is a blast. It takes the toys so many were fond of playing with (for my age 12"" tall jointed clod hoppers, for the younger set 6"" tall characters with names and multiple weapons) and brings them to life on the screen. It makes those many minutes of animated cells seen by so many for so long come to life and appear in full color action, blasting their way across the screen.The story is simple. Good guy versus bad guy. To make it complete we get background segments that explain who these characters are, fleshing them out further than the cartoons had time for. Duke and the Baroness, Cobra Commander and Duke, and everyone's favorite, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. There pieces give us a full fledged story to wrap all the action around.But it is the action that takes center stage here. This is a definite popcorn flick determined to keep you cheering for the good guys and hissing the bad. Underwater battles, snow covered terrains, secret lairs in the Sahara and enough rough and ready heroes to make the world seem a safer place.More than anything this movie is about having fun. It makes it a film that all ages can enjoy as opposed to playing too much to the young, or overdoing the adult thing for parents. Unlike the cartoon, people do die here and when shot fall down for good. But not to the point of glorifying the violence or lingering on it. Think Lone Ranger in the 50's type violence.Having seen the movie twice, in the theater and now on DVD, I can't recommend it enough. It's not just one that you'll want to rent, but one you'll want to add to your collection. Myself, I determine that by if I think I'd watch it again.

Then I realized that these people probably were never fans of the show I grew up on as a kid. They probably went in expecting to see something like Star Wars or Batman for all I know. None of the 1 star reviews I saw on here even mentioned anything about the adaption from the Cartoon to the live action movie. For me sitting back after all these years and seeing a live action G.I. Joe movie on screen was pretty exciting. Although this movie didn't have some of my favorite characters that I remember I.E.(Lady Jane) it was still pretty awsome.Watching G.I. Joe was just like watching the cartoon. There was always some rediculous over the top scheme Cobra was planning, and the Joe's always had some rediculous and over the top way of stopping them. The vehicles, the weaponry, the action... it was all here! They even used the ""lazer"" bullet effects and sounds! I really couldn't imagine how they would take all the action from the Cartoon and bring it to the silver screen but they did just that. I was worried they would ""Hollywoodize"" the crazy schemes of Cobra but they didn't. The plot revolved around the strong concept of deception with a bigger scheme behind it...which is what Cobra mostly did.I was very pleased with the overall movie, but what kind of took away from it was a few of the choice actors. Well... I take that back... just one! ""DUKE"" who ever they hired for that role didn't belong in the movie. He had absolutely no emotion for the character of Duke and was 1 dimensional. He was completely flat, and didn't belong in a film like this. It was a very poor casting decision and it showed. You don't pick an actor like that to play one of the greatest heroes/lead characters in the G.I. Joe franchise. I hated having to watch the scenes featuring him because his acting ruined the movie.The other characters that steal the show are the Baroness,Snake Eyes,and RipCord. In the movie Ripcord had a big role, but I don't remember him that much from the show. The Baroness was the cherry on the cake and Snake Eyes(my favorite character from the show) is what made me watch this in the first place. There were alot of people from the Joe team missing that I hope we'll see in the next film.Overall this was a good movie and I think it doesn't get the respect that it deserves. G.I. Joe the live movie did a good job modeling the cartoon and I'm glad the directors didn't try to change that. They brought me a G.I. Joe similar to the one I remember.

I didn't turn over to go to sleep until the movie was over.  It just grabbed me from the start.  The weapons weren't too unrealistic (given it's in the future) and the action was on the same level of a Transformers movie.

Being a fan of the cartoon from my childhood, I at least wanted to see the new attempt at the franchise.First of all, the acting is horrendous, even when you factor in the macho/roided out nature of the characters.  Of course, the cast is a collection of C-list stars, so you can't expect too much out of them.  I would have been happy if they had all made like Snake-Eyes and stayed silent, especially Wayans.The action is almost too-fast. I barely had time to register what was going on.  One minute the new Joes are training, the next they're being attacked at their base, then they're running around Paris.  Combined with all their flashy gadgets, the pace was bewildering.  And in between these rushes of action were these half-conceived, afterthought backstories on a few of the major characters, mostly Duke & the Baroness, and then Snake-Eyes & Storm Shadow.  I know the first movie in a series is supposed to establish some backstories, but for GI Joe, it was hastily done and incomplete.  The team was already together with no explanation of how the team was even conceived, funded, how the team was put together, etc.  I felt like the movie picked up in the middle instead of the beginning.There was just too much cheesiness to the story, and that's saying a lot for a movie based on a toy & cartoon.  The producers were obviously cashing in on the franchise name and appeal to kids from the 80's instead of trying to put together even a decent action movie.  Just not a well thought out or well executed concept.Very disappointing considering what the movie could have been.",2,"Disappointing, even with low expectations",1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1649,"['rented', 'GI', 'Joe', 'having', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'Being', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'childhood', 'least', 'wanted', 'see', 'new', 'attempt', 'franchise.First', 'acting', 'horrendous', 'even', 'when', 'factor', 'macho/roided', 'out', 'nature', 'characters', 'course', 'cast', 'collection', 'C-list', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'had', 'made', 'Snake-Eyes', 'stayed', 'silent', 'especially', 'Wayans.The', 'action', 'almost', 'too-fast', 'barely', 'had', 'time', 'register', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'One', 'minute', 'new', 'Joes', 'are', 'training', 'next', ""'re"", 'being', 'attacked', 'base', 'then', ""'re"", 'running', 'around', 'Paris', 'Combined', 'flashy', 'gadgets', 'pace', 'was', 'bewildering', 'rushes', 'action', 'were', 'half-conceived', 'afterthought', 'backstories', 'few', 'major', 'characters', 'mostly', 'Duke', 'Baroness', 'then', 'Snake-Eyes', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'know', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'supposed', 'establish', 'backstories', 'GI', 'Joe', 'was', 'hastily', 'done', 'incomplete', 'team', 'was', 'already', 'together', 'explanation', 'how', 'team', 'was', 'even', 'conceived', 'funded', 'how', 'team', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'etc', 'felt', 'movie', 'picked', 'up', 'middle', 'instead', 'beginning.There', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'cheesiness', 'story', 'saying', 'lot', 'movie', 'based', 'toy', 'cartoon', 'producers', 'were', 'obviously', 'cashing', 'franchise', 'name', 'appeal', 'kids', '80', 'instead', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'even', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'Just', 'not', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'executed', 'concept.Very', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A
1280630,A4UM5DS14TSCO,B002NXSRVG,Matthew Warner,"[1, 1]","As a writer, it's always instructive to watch a poorly written movie and to analyze what went wrong.Oh, maybe I'm being too hard on G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, a retelling of the cartoon I enjoyed as a kid, which itself was a rehash of an older entertainment franchise.  I mean, I did say to my wife, ""Let's watch something mindless,"" and I got what I wanted.Still, I can't help wondering if the movie makers intended for me to burst out laughing the first time the Baroness walks onto the screen looking like Sarah Palin in a skin suit.  Nor can I help wondering if, when the movie was finished, I was supposed to admit that I couldn't remember the main character's name.Somewhere between the underwater space battle, the ninja swordfight over the pit of crackling electrical arcs, and the evil doctor talking through a mask, I finally realized that this movie aspired to be Star Wars and failed miserably.  And I think the problem can be summed up in one elementary topic of story craft: character development.  Sure, I believe the original Star Wars had lots of revolutionary special effects for the time, and that's what all of us kids buzzed about as we ran around our lawns with our X-Wings making ""pew!  pew!"" laser gun sounds.  But I also remember being fascinated with the character dynamics.  By the end of Star Wars, I felt like I knew Luke, Han, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and C-3PO as well as members of my own family.  I never forgot their names.  Interest in where these characters were headed (and, of course, the cool special effects) brought me back for The Empire Strikes Back sequel. When the simulated space battles on the front lawn were done for the day, we sat down for long philosophical discussions about Darth Vader's revelation that he was Luke's father.G.I. Joe had all the ingredients of a great story like Star Wars, but they were undercooked and underseasoned.  The writers tried to establish character dynamics through the use of flashbacks rather than to let the present story do the work.  Characters contrivedly addressed each other by their names (""yes, we will work on that next, Storm Shadow"") so the audience would learn those (corny) names and/or connect them to their previous cartoon incarnations rather than to let this information come out more naturally.The cinematography didn't help.  The frenetic, herky-jerky camera work made me nauseous at the same time that it prevented me from even understanding what was going on.  You don't need to move and shake the camera to film a good fight scene, you really don't, not unless the actors are so bereft of athleticism that you need to cover up their shortcomings.  (Yes, I'm talking to you, David Carradine, in the latter years of Kung Fu.)  Please, just pan back a little, and let me follow the action like a normal human being and not like someone flipping through comic book panels in fast motion.  Also, it's okay, really it is, to let a single camera angle last for more than two seconds.  I won't get bored, I promise.Maybe I'm just getting old.  Maybe I should just pull up the A&E; channel and watch a black-and-white adventure story from the 1940s.  The characterizations in those are usually outstanding.  And because the directors no doubt were raised in the theater, the camera angles are always a good ten feet away from the subject, as if to film the events on a stage.  (The actors always shouted their lines, too, so those of us the back of the movie theater could hear.  Yes, I admit some things have improved in movie-making.)Sigh.

1280634,AT393OR1JTYNR,B002NXSRVG,Miami Nights,"[0, 1]","""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" provides big, loud, dumb, silly fun. It's a ""bad"" movie, but a ""bad"" movie that is entertaining. I would have given it a two-star overall, but the fun quotient it provides in a rather lackluster summer bumps it up to three.It's like a live-action version of the cartoon, and it's good that the filmmaker doesn't take it too seriously.At the same time, it's good that they do try to provide some bits of character development and exposition, although they try a little bit too hard, especially with some flashback scenes that fall short.But, that's a small quibble, as the movie's a fun action-blast of a ride from beginning to end.By contrast, Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was dumb -- and awful. G.I. Joe is dumb and silly, but for fans of the cartoon, it's more in line with that 80s show and the whole movie is delivered with tongue firmly in cheek.But if someone sits down to analyze the acting, the character development and preposterous, yet interesting storyline, they're going to hate this movie.This is a fun, entertaining piece of junk that entertains on pure adrenaline, goofy bits and lame one-liners.Marlon Wayans is his typical annoying self, yet still fun at times, the female leads (Rachel Nichols and Sienna Miller) are good-looking as Scarlett and the Baroness, and Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are ultra-cool.One thing that did surprise me -- aside from it being a fun two hours -- was the violence. They really lived up to that PG-13 rating. Unlike the cartoon, where no one bites the bullet (or, er, the laser), there are some graphic death scenes and all sorts of violence, maiming and graphic fatal, close-up gun shots to the head and other body parts, even some impalings. That did lend the movie some gravitas. Just had to let you all know, and knowing's half the battle.Yo Joe! :)",3,"Big, Dumb, Loud, Silly Fun",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,1836,"['G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'big', 'loud', 'dumb', 'silly', 'fun', 'bad', 'movie', 'bad', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'two-star', 'overall', 'fun', 'quotient', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'summer', 'bumps', 'up', 'three.It', 'live-action', 'version', 'cartoon', 'good', 'filmmaker', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'do', 'try', 'provide', 'bits', 'character', 'development', 'exposition', 'try', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'especially', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'fall', 'short.But', 'small', 'quibble', 'movie', 'fun', 'action-blast', 'ride', 'beginning', 'end.By', 'contrast', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'was', 'dumb', 'awful', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'dumb', 'silly', 'fans', 'cartoon', 'more', 'line', '80s', 'show', 'whole', 'movie', 'delivered', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek.But', 'someone', 'down', 'analyze', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'preposterous', 'yet', 'interesting', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'going', 'hate', 'movie.This', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'junk', 'pure', 'adrenaline', 'goofy', 'bits', 'lame', 'one-liners.Marlon', 'Wayans', 'typical', 'annoying', 'self', 'yet', 'still', 'fun', 'times', 'female', 'leads', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'are', 'good-looking', 'Scarlett', 'Baroness', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'are', 'ultra-cool.One', 'thing', 'did', 'surprise', 'aside', 'being', 'fun', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'violence', 'really', 'lived', 'up', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'cartoon', 'where', 'one', 'bullet', 'er', 'laser', 'are', 'graphic', 'death', 'scenes', 'sorts', 'violence', 'maiming', 'graphic', 'fatal', 'close-up', 'gun', 'shots', 'head', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'even', 'impalings', 'did', 'lend', 'movie', 'gravitas', 'Just', 'had', 'let', 'know', 'knowing', 'battle.Yo', 'Joe']",N/A
1280635,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B002NXSRVG,Michael A. Newman,"[2, 6]","I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this film was.  I liked it a lot more than any of the Transformer movies and the movie never seemed to get boring.  It begins with a Scottish arms dealer caught in 1600's France being forced to wear a steel mask (which is literally burnt into his head).  We then flash forward to what is labelled ""the near distant future."" and the arm's dealer's later descendent is now a heavy dealer to the US military (and to other unsavory characters as well).A contingent of soldiers is delivering a bunch of nanoweapons capable of eating anything in their patch (including steel, concrete, etc) when they are set upon by high tech and seemingly unstoppable enemies led by a mysterious woman with long black hair.  Two of the soldiers are able to escape and are later captured by the GI Joes which is a covert operation headed by Dennis Quaid.  The soldiers talk their way into joining the Joes, especially since one of the soldiers was engaged to the mysterious woman attacker and may know enough about her to capture her.The movie continues with unbelievable technology close to Star Wars type with super soldier suits and incredible planes and underwater vehicles.  There is also a rivalry between the evil kung fu assassin with the bad guys and the Joe's own kung fu warrior.  Apparently the two were rivals from the time they were boys and each wants to kill the other.If you can ignore the obvious logic flaws (how can all the technology be financed, how come the soldier in the super soldier suits can run as fast as cars and not get tired, etc.) and sit back and just watch you will be highly entertained throughout and the action is virtually non-stop.  This movie was way better than expected.

G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra is loud and the action never quits, but the sense of fun here is contagious. Unlike Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, this flick isn't a chore to sit through. Most of the acting is pretty good for this type of film and the CGI is top notch majority of the time. The action scenes also seemed really fresh and exciting, which is hard to do nowadays. On top of all that, Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols are both super hot, which only makes every scene they are in that much better.I grew up playing with G.I. Joe action figures. In fact I still have boxes full of them up in the attic and numerous vehicles scattered about and tucked away somewhere in the house.

The story wasn't bad, but the casting of Marlon Wayans as Ripcord really REALLY killed it for me. I kept waiting for the next Scary Movie gag to appear. He really tries to act, but is more suited for comedies than anything else. He ended up being a major distraction. Hopefully the next Joe film will replace him with a real actor. The pacing of the film seemed a little off to me as well. All in all, it was watchable... but I had hoped for something with more character development and a cohesive story line.

Well, characters which get thrown around and stepped on in much the way their toy counterparts do..  Stephen Sommers, director of The Mummy, creates here a cgi heavy action thriller based on an elite team of soldiers, called G.I. Joes.  When a nanotechnology based warhead is stolen, they spring in to action to recover it.By all rights, this could have been pretty awful.  The cgi has that look about it where you're constantly reminded what you are watching is not real, removing any sense of jeopardy for the characters.  There's a nagging feeling as you watch characters in motorised suits do leaps and jumps or planes flying past the speed of sound zip off in a different direction, that the movie is just not quite obeying the laws of physics... On the other hand, several elements save the movie from mediocrity.  The action scenes that do not involve, or at least involve less cgi, are actually pretty impressive.  Carnage on the streets of Paris involves both the annoyingly unconvincing aforementioned suits, but a fair deal of genuine car carnage which is pleasurable to watch.  Even a few set piece cgi scenes have a wow factor, like the climax to the Paris scene.  Then there is the actors, who do a good job of making the ridiculous.. well, maybe not believable, but acceptable.  Then there's an infectious sense of fun and not taking themselves too seriously that serves the movie well.  This is not a Batman style dark adaptation, but a lively and colourful imagining of what sort of world a G.I. Joe could inhabit.  While Dennis Quaid has little screen time and even then just has to grin at the camera and bark a few commands, the rest of the cast manage to cram a heap of backstory into the movie without the film ever collapsing in on itself under the need to explain everything.  Somewhat bizarrely, there are a heap of references and similarities to Star Wars plotlines and scenes, from a black masked heavy breathing villain, to underwater fights which look remarkably like the attack on the death star, and even duels which may as well have been with light sabres to complete the effect.So with a music score full of zest by Alan Silvestri, aided by a brilliant and clear transfer to Bluray in both sight and sound, this is a brash, action packed, disposable movie even.. but good fun, for all that.",3,"Fun, far-fetched cgi heavy thriller",1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2382,"['So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'movie', 'based', 'toy', 'product..', 'Well', 'characters', 'get', 'thrown', 'stepped', 'much', 'way', 'toy', 'counterparts', 'do..', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'director', 'Mummy', 'here', 'cgi', 'heavy', 'action', 'thriller', 'based', 'elite', 'team', 'soldiers', 'called', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'When', 'nanotechnology', 'based', 'warhead', 'stolen', 'spring', 'action', 'recover', 'it.By', 'rights', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'awful', 'cgi', 'look', 'where', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'reminded', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'not', 'real', 'removing', 'sense', 'jeopardy', 'characters', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'watch', 'characters', 'motorised', 'suits', 'do', 'leaps', 'jumps', 'planes', 'flying', 'speed', 'sound', 'zip', 'different', 'direction', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'obeying', 'laws', 'physics', 'other', 'hand', 'several', 'elements', 'save', 'movie', 'mediocrity', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'involve', 'least', 'involve', 'less', 'cgi', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Carnage', 'streets', 'Paris', 'annoyingly', 'unconvincing', 'aforementioned', 'suits', 'fair', 'deal', 'genuine', 'car', 'carnage', 'pleasurable', 'watch', 'Even', 'few', 'set', 'piece', 'cgi', 'scenes', 'have', 'wow', 'factor', 'climax', 'Paris', 'scene', 'Then', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'ridiculous..', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'believable', 'acceptable', 'Then', 'infectious', 'sense', 'fun', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'well', 'not', 'Batman', 'style', 'dark', 'adaptation', 'lively', 'colourful', 'imagining', 'what', 'sort', 'world', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'could', 'inhabit', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'even', 'then', 'just', 'grin', 'camera', 'bark', 'few', 'commands', 'rest', 'cast', 'manage', 'cram', 'heap', 'backstory', 'movie', 'film', 'ever', 'collapsing', 'need', 'explain', 'everything', 'Somewhat', 'bizarrely', 'are', 'heap', 'references', 'similarities', 'Star', 'Wars', 'plotlines', 'scenes', 'black', 'masked', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'villain', 'underwater', 'fights', 'look', 'remarkably', 'attack', 'death', 'star', 'even', 'duels', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'light', 'sabres', 'complete', 'effect.So', 'music', 'score', 'full', 'zest', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'aided', 'brilliant', 'clear', 'transfer', 'Bluray', 'sight', 'sound', 'brash', 'action', 'packed', 'disposable', 'movie', 'even..', 'good', 'fun']",N/A

It's not going to win any Oscars that's for sure. The script is brutal, the acting more than occasionally cringe worthy, and the plot full of as many holes as a spaghetti strainer. However there are some great action sequences, as a sort of pervasive comic book fun that makes the whole thing better than the sum of its parts. Most of the characters are pretty one dimensional, and the few that aren't aren't given enough time to develop. I thought the most interesting characters were Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, and their various confrontations made for the best moments in the entire film. They could have done so much more with that storyline than they did. It would have been more interesting to have Storm Shadow redeemed at the end than the boring girl friend character.The Joes being some sort of multi-nation peace keepers instead of ""Real American Heroes"" put a bad taste in my mouth. Is it so bad to have American Heroes these days that we have to turn it into a badass version of NATO?The powered exoskeletons were ripped right out of CRYSIS. They look almost identical.

Nothing wrong with that--it's actually A LOT better than 90% of movies based on video games.Despite some pretty glaring flaws, the movie is pretty entertaining.

From the moment it was announced that Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing) would be helming it and all through its production, just about everyone knew that the live-action adaptation of G.I. Joe would more than likely be incredibly bad.  And boy oh boy, whoever would have thought that it could be so bad.  If you thought that the universally-panned Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was bad, you haven't seen anything yet until you view G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.  Soldier buddies Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) get drawn into the world of the elite unit known as G.I.

1280661,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B002NXSRVG,Newton Ooi,"[1, 2]","It seems this is the decade for resurrecting old cartoons as movie franchises.  Starting with x-Men, then Spiderman, then Transformers, and now G.I. Joe, each one has been jazzed up sex appeal, great special effects, big budgets, and a host of movie stars young and old.  Unfortunately, all of this does not replace a good script and authentic details, both of which are lacking in this movie.First, the general premise of the movie is nonsensical.  To begin, we have an evil scientist who builds the world's ultimate weapon, metal-eating nanobots, on NATO's dime.  This grand weapon is then delivered to NATO in the middle of a foreign country, to be transferred in a small convoy to storage.  Last time I checked, the biggest and baddest weapons were usually developed at very secure national laboratories or military bases guarded by a whole lot of soldiers.  For something so valuable to be transported across open country guarded by a handful of trucks is ridiculous.  And this is how this movie begins.  But of course we need such a ridiculous setup to allow the aforementioned evil scientist the opportunity to steal said weapon.  Why didn't this mad scientist just program his nanobots to come alive while en route and destroy the convoy that was carrying them?Another big problem in the script are the battle scenes, specifically how open they are.  Both the good guys and the bad guys in this movie are supposed to be the world's top experts in covert action.  Yet they walk around in very eye-catching outfits, pulling the trigger in very public places.  So much for ""covert"" action.  Talking about the outfits, why does the Baroness walk into battle with her breasts half-exposed.  Are they supposed to distract her targets (men mainly) so she can get of the first shot?  And the long hair?  Come on, anyone who has served in the armed forces knows that long hair is a no-no; they easily get caught or tangled up.And then we have various issues with casting.  First of, why is the US president played by a British actor, Jonathan Price, who clearly speaks with a British accent in the movie.  Come on, this is the year of Obama; get someone like Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington to play the president.  Or at least an American who does not speak with a European accent.  And then notice almost everyone of note in either the G.I. Joe side or Cobra's side is either American or British.  We have two characters of Middle Eastern descent, and one japanese ninja.  Last time I checked, South Africa, Russia, Israel, Argentina, Colombia and numerous other countries outside of NATO have produced their fair share of para-military and cover action operatives, many of which operate on the free market.

However, what really captivated me at that age were the unbelievably awesome action figures and toy sets that accompanied the franchise.  I can remember cracking open the Sears catalog and dreaming about the new vehicles and huge weapons that were released as accessories to the figures; knowing full well that I could never convince my mother to buy me any of them.  I once managed to score some parachutes for my Joes and began a tireless quest to find just the right height from which to drop them.  I settled on the balcony of an apartment building.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that the toys didn't actually float down like real parachutes.That is what this movie accomplishes in silly popcorn sort of way.  It's the imagination of young kids everywhere who dream(ed) of how awesome these vehicles and weapons would be in real life.  And that's how I watched this movie:  Constantly anticipating the next ridiculously awesome piece of advanced technology that the filmmakers had thought up.  And it's all here.  Jet packs, fully armed snowmobiles, submarines that maneuver like fighter planes, awesome pulse rifles that take out five guys at a time.... etc... etc.I could really care less about who Scarlett falls in love with in the cartoon or the comic book.  I could care less that The Baroness in the film is nowhere near as cool as she was in the original cartoon.  This movie hits all the points that really mattered to me as someone who grew up loving this stuff.It's all about the tech, man.  It's all about guns and ninjas.

1280669,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B002NXSRVG,Only-A-Child,"[3, 7]","By now everyone has heard that ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" (2009) is a rather sad exercise in excess, although no worse than other digital effects cartoons with actors superimposed on the screen (much cheaper than creating actual sets and paying a real production designer).  So I will just highlight a few random points.This is what screenwriters call a ""moron movie""; with a target audience so unsophisticated that suspension of disbelief is irrelevant-as disbelief requires conceptual reasoning ability. For a writer this sort of project is a dream job  because there are no logic constraints on the action; strengths and weaknesses do not have to be consistent between characters, between weapons, or even between segments in the same production.  Each moment exists as if it is a short independent clip and the writer cannot box themselves into a corner and can simply ignore continuity considerations. Nothing wrong with the concept, morons need to be entertained like anyone else and there are worse things than dumbing yourself down for a couple hours; so think ""Rambo"" (2008) if you want something geared for the same audience.The franchise dates back to the Action Man figures launched in Britain in 1966 by Palitoy; licensed to them by Hasbro who had introduced GI Joe a couple years earlier.  In 1982 it crossed the ocean back to the USA and inspired by elements from Marvel Comics' ""Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.""  was renamed ""Action Force"".  Names were changed but all the basic characters, organizations, missions, and gadgets can be found in those mid-60's Nick Fury comic books.The just released film attempts to package all the background information, characterization, gadgets, the evil plot to rule-the-world story, and 150 minutes of exercise-in-excess digital effects into 118 minutes.  As you can imagine things got a little rushed and a lot of basic stuff got left on the cutting room floor; but almost everything on the special effects hard drives made it into the final cut.  So there was no time to build up any anticipation or suspense.  And each time the rival organizations try figure out the location of each others assorted  lairs, the producers did not have the luxury of  incorporating cerebral exercises in detection; the locations are just lamely revealed.  Real movies can get 60 minutes of mentally engaging quality running time from solving this type of puzzle.None of the male characters are worthy of note nor are the actors who play them.  The talent-challenged Dennis Quaid (playing the Nick Fury based character) is not required to act; he just plays himself again which is something to be thankful for as is his minimal screen time.  But the guys in the theater where I watched the movie were only there to see Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols parade around in the tight costumes seen in all the promo material.Yes they have a short hyper-edited catfight, but it is an extremely sterile one and in the middle of the film; which was a disappointment.  Yes Miller (in her much advertised outfit) looks hotter than you have ever seen her (actually I doubt that anyone until now has viewed this tiny actress as especially hot) and seems to be having fun playing against type as the evil Baroness; she is light years ahead of the rest of the cast in basic thespian ability.  But it turns out that the Baroness is not really evil, which was a disappointment although interesting to observe how this revelation quickly causes her to slip several steps down on the hotness scale.  Producers should take note of the dynamic-bad girls are only hot if the viewer thinks they are bad girls.Nichols is poorly showcased and underutilized.  While unfortunate visually, as she  would  have been even more stunning than Miller in that outfit; her lack of screen time is another thing to be thankful for; you know what I mean if you have ever been subjected to her Kathy Ireland quality acting skills (her only emotion is a look of stunned surprise).Personally I think George Lucas has a copyright infringement claim against the producers; as the staging of the Snake Eyes vs Storm Shadow showdown bears more than a coincidental resemblance to Luke vs Darth Vader  in ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983).  And the COBRA headquarters (and the climatic attack on it) will remind you of the Death Star; although oddly not as effective visually - maybe models are better than digital generation after all.  This is all obvious enough to actually be parody; perhaps the brains of the production staff needed some exercise after being unchallenged by the other elements of the movie.Then again, what do I know?

1280670,A7S389T88I0HC,B002NXSRVG,Patricia Laverty,"[1, 2]","This is a formula action movie with a lot of fantastic gadgets. It has power suits (the sort of military equipment envisioned by Robert Heinlein in his 1959 book, ""Starship Troopers,"" but which never made it into the crappy film adapted from Heinlein's book for economic and practical reasons). G.I. Joe also displays some kind of magnetic energy pulse weapons and lots of fancy airplanes, submarines and earth-drilling vehicles. The main technical device in the film is nanotechnology. Its use in the film is pervasive and this movie provides ample illustrations of how this technology could be dangerous. After seeing this movie you can understand why many scientists are calling for tight international controls of nanotechnology. All this gadgetry, combined with the film's well-staged action scenes and fast pace makes it entertaining. Saddled with the unwieldy name ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" and produced in association with the toy company Hasbro (which also produced the ""Transformers"" movies) this movie is fully expected to be another franchise film. A sequel is built into the plot. Based on this first movie, I expect it will spawn another film or two which will produce a combined worldwide box office total of a billion dollars or more.The movie's main character is a G.I. named Duke (played by Channing Tatum of ""Public Enemies""). He and his friend, Ripcord (Marlon Wayans of ""Norbit"") are the only two survivors of an attack on their heavily-armed convoy by a team of mercenaries led by Duke's old friend Ana (Sienna Miller of ""Stardust""). The mercenaries have superior technology, including those magnetic pulse weapons, which are used to wipe out most of the convoy. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by a secret special operations unit called G.I. Joe. Despite its name, G.I. Joe is not American, but rather is international, comprised of the best soldiers from the world's armies. Duke and Ripcord talk their way into the organization and after undergoing a ridiculously short training program become elite commandos in the secret military organization headed by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid of ""Flight of the Phoenix""). They are opposed by international arms manufacturer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston, a former ""Doctor Who""). He wants to use nanotechnology bombs to rule the world (yes, just like a Bond villain). He not only uses nanotechnology to build bombs which can destroy whole cities, but uses medical nanorobots to control people and to change their appearance. McCullen is aided by a mysterious mad scientist, of course. G.I. Joe's mission is to stop McCullen from using the nanotech bombs. This is accomplished, but acres of room is left in the conclusion of the movie for a sequel.The story has a lot of coincidences in it. Duke and Ripcord just happen to be the only survivors of an attack. They also just happen to be the only people in the entire G.I. Joe organization who know the person who led that attack. They also just happen to be the only people who happen know that mysterious mad scientist. Another member of the G.I. Joe team, Snake Eyes (played by Ray Park of ""X-Men,"" who has no dialogue in this film at all) just happens to be the only person in the organization who knows the true identity of the arch-villain Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee). Granted, this is not nearly as many coincidences as it takes to get the ridiculous plot of Atonement off the ground, but it still had me laughing and rolling my eyes. It helps that G.I. Joe doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as Atonement did.

Figured out early on I should try to pretend I was a 14 year old boy and put aside any expectations for great drama and convincing plot details etc.Then --- Very nice visual material, well designed CG sets, and backgrounds etc. Very visually rich. Good photography and lively camera work. The camera moved frequently and nicely to contribute to the action but they avoided the terrible hand held camera gimmick.Relentless mayhem and explosions and destruction. It never seemed to stop and did not seem to be repetitive and gratuitous. They must have put a tremendous amount of work into it artistically to have had so much variety. I may have never seen so much in a film. I really hate car chases, crashes etc. because they seem like cheap thrills. But they did a great job here with these and I was impressed. A lot of well done action.So technically, I feel that the film was remarkable. Even classy. But unless you are a 14 year old boy (well, 13-22), or interested in the technicalities of film making, this film might bore you for its lack of adult dramatic pacing and slim character development and instead its emphasis on violent mayhem and visuals.I might add that I just watched Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (again on a lark) which I thought was pitifully formulaic and poorly acted and yet got generally good reviews. I feel it is fair to compare it to this because it also tried to maintain relentless action and tension --but it was just stale. GI Joe was so much more successful in this respect as well as visually, acting etc. my opinion that there is just no comparison whatsoever.

The cast in itself wasn't the real problem but the poor and shallow storyline for the movie is, but that's kind of expected with once good director Stephen Sommers leading the way of this seemingly today version of the Mummy.  The small story is you have Destro with the help of a unknown scientist and the Baroness plotting to take over the world and it's up to the joint special forces unit of various countries called Joe to stop him and his nefarious plot.  We also get the introduction of Duke and Ripcord who after being ambushed by Cobra and rescued by G.I. Joe demand to join the shadow unit and help stop Destro,  of course you can't have this kind of cheesy movie without the romantic entanglement and angst between a couple of characters but one story between one of the couples is such a joke it tightropes on pathetic or predictably stupid your choice.  Considering the amount of money it took to make the movie you would think the effects would be a lot better,  sadly while not the worse I've ever seen it still was pretty sad to see these kinds of effects on such a big budgeted movie.

But then I actually went to see the movie near the end of its theatrical run, well after hearing and reading all of the negative feedback ang giving the negative feedback time to sink in. I decided to see it any way because it was one of the last few movies in theatres that I hadn't seen that summer. I had a choice to see G.I. Joe, or whatever chick flick my mom was going to see. Obviously, I chose the former. It actually turned out to be a pretty big surprise. I definitely liked it about as much as I liked Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which I still like to this day, despite the never ending insults from people who hate the movie. Going into it with low expectations turned out to be a very good thing. There were complaints about the quality of the CGI, but I didn't have any problems with it. Even with near reference picture quality, I stil don't find much to complain about in the special effects department. They aren't flawless, but they are still very convincing, and not distracting at all. There were also alot of complaints that important G.I. Joe material from the cartoon and comics was missing, but people should understand that this should really be considered a prequal to what fans of the old cartoons and comics consider ""the real G.I. Joe"". It's the ""Rise of Cobra"".In the end, Rise of Cobra was actually a fun summer blockbuster, in my opinion, because it doesn't take itself too seriously, they experiment with creative ideas for futuristic military technology, and when the big budget of this movie is on display, it really becomes a visual treat. There were some nice flashbacks that filled in all the gaps, and the end was a nice lead into part two. I also liked that Stephen Sommers had a few cameos of a few of his Mummy stars. Speaking of The Mummy, that's the type of feel this movie has. The material is obviously cheesy, but it's all about having fun while you're watching it. I also liked how fleshed out the story felt, from start to finish, with intercut flashbacks to fill in backstory. Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum are well hated among the geek community, but while I didn't find their acting impressive, I still don't think they were bad enough for people to get so riled up. I don't know. Maybe there are more important things worth hating to me. So overall the story is pretty solid, in my opinion. I'm sure that's pretty much everyone would beg to differ, but I'm okay with that. At least we can all agree that this Blu-ray has a terrific all around transfer. The extras are a little light though. The few extras are interesting though. So in the end, I recommend G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a rental for general film enthusiasts.

Overall, neither of us had any problems with this movie. We both thought it had good action sequences and a lot of fun special effects. The acting was a little bit better than the average Bruce Campbell B-film. The story, though very...simple, is fun and doesn't have any gaps. There are a ton of flashbacks in here so, that is saying a lot. Snake Eyes is awesome and my friend was trying to imitate Ray Park's martial arts skills for the next few days, after we both saw this movie.

It had potential but the makers chose to flush it all away in favor of cornball one-liners, plot holes galore, not-so-special effects, an ending that drags out about half an hour too long and some of the worst acting ever caught on film. When the mute Snake Eyes out-acts everyone else, you know your movie is in trouble. Even old pro Dennis Quaid looks bored out of his skull, not that I can blame him since he's given absolutely nothing to do.The worst of the worst are Channing Tatum and Sienna Miller, who play Duke and Baroness. Based on their acting (or lack of it) I'd have to say they were having a contest to see who could deliver the most flat, lazy, wooden performance. Seriously, both spend the entire movie looking around as if they had better things to do. The clear winner of the bad acting contest is Tatum. You could have replaced him with a cardboard cutout and a tape recorder and nobody would have noticed. In fact, it might have been an improvement. Meanwhile, Miller delivers all her lines with all the enthusiasm of a 3rd grader delivering her first book report. In the scene at the graveyard her expression doesn't express grief so much as someone trying to decide if she wants to hit the McDonald's drive-thru for a burger and fries on the way home.One of the worst films of 2009.

1280719,ACL0EVYL4M2GR,B002NXSRVG,SLAINE,"[11, 12]","This is a good action movie, but it's not GI JOE. I don't know why they even bothered to call it GI JOE if they weren't going to stick closely enough to the original source material. Sure you can change things up a bit, but you don't need to go this far. The only time I got the chills at the sight of something that even vaguely represented GI JOE was when Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow were on screen, but that didn't make up for it. The other thing about this film is that it's for the kids. Gritty and real this is not. Some might say it's a bit harsh but I think it's only a hop skip and jump away from Power rangers territory. Even the Fantastic Four seems more serious, and more convincing, at times (much better acting played a big part in this) and even they stayed closer to the source material (Yes, even the one with Silver Surfer). So if you're looking for a good action movie this is good, but we've yet to see something that brings GI JOE to the screen. To be fair, the biggest departure is the visual aspect, but that's so important in capturing the feel. If no one looks like the characters you were expecting, then it feels like you're watching something completely unrelated. I was dying to see the Vipers as they really looked and many other characters too. It's possible to do it without it being a kiddie flick - if they can make 3 foot tall people with hairy feet who go around fighting goblins convincing then there's no excuse why GI JOE couldn't stay much closer. I give it 2 stars for a GI JOE film and maybe 4 for an action film - so evens out to about 3.

1280720,AJ6XR403WY88M,B002NXSRVG,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[0, 3]","So I walked out of this movie after about 45 minutes. G.I. Joe just isn't my kind of movie, but that's not the movies problem. It's my problem. I had no business being there in the first place. For one, I was always ambivalent about the cartoon. I watched it only because it came on after the Transformers. Most of the time I didn't finish the episodes. Not much has changed considering that I saw G.I. Joe only because I had my schedule mixed up with what I really wanted to see: the movie ""Adam."" Having already made the drive to the theater, I took a gamble on G.I. Joe.With only 45 minutes to work from, all I can write here is that the plot centers around nanobugs that can get inside human beings and reprogram their brains and their immune systems. They can also eat metal or entire cities for that matter. The nanobugs have been intercepted by the bad guys who will do bad things with them. The G.I. Joe force are the people who will stop this. This may sound like a sarcastic synopsis, but really it's not. The plot is as simplistically heinous as how I remember the cartoon. And it shouldn't be anything more than that. This is G.I. Joe we're talking about. One guy even says, ""the Joe's won't know what hit them."" A line that probably came right out of the series, and if it didn't, it could have. Duke, the main character, is not already a member of the G.I. Joe unit at the start of the movie. So he uses lines like ""I want in."" Twice, actually. There's plenty more of where that came from. The movie even borrows the moral platitudes of the 80s; so we get a ""when-you-get-knocked-down-get-right-back-up-pep-talk"" from one of the Wayan brothers.Again, I'm not criticizing. Whoever is behind this movie decided to detour away from Bay's direction with Transformers, and actually make a movie that is true to the source material. I applaud that. Fans of the cartoon will recognize the characters (more than I can say for Transformers), and newcomers won't have to because, from what I could gather, The Rise of Cobra will make for a fun and fast-paced introduction. The acting and the writing may feel as if it were originally a made for TV flick, but that's because it is sincerely inspired by a TV series. Smart move. It will make it all the more easier to start a live-action TV series - after they clean-up on three or four of the big screen versions, of course.If Hawk is right, and ""knowing is half the battle"", then I don't feel too bad about writing a review based on only the first half of the movie.

I know it's not fair to expect Citizen Kane here.Even so, the movie manages to be four degrees too stupid to bear. It still shows the strange plot structure of a movie that has been re-written too many times and never read through once. It is incoherent in a way that actually detracts from the action, the characters are thin in a way that disengages you from the movie, and the action has numerous moments that make no sense. All of this pulls you out of the movie, keeps you from staying in the moment, and makes you realize ""wow, I'm watching a really stupid movie."" After you hear Scarlet give another speech about refusing to accept illogical emotions that was probably rejected by the writers of ""The Big Bang Theory,"" Breaker stab a dead guy in the head in the streets of Paris to retrieve his memories (which was used to bad effect before in ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Fringe""), and Rex (a bad guy named Rex? really?) explain his evil motives, you cannot withdraw from the fact that movie is catastrophically stupid.The other aspect of the film that is difficult to bear is its exceedingly black heart, especially when compared to the source material that never killed anyone. During the raid on the Joes' base, the evil characters are ruthless to a degree that shocks but does not entertain, and extras are dispatched with shocking callousness that the filmmakers don't seem to notice. Zartan's taunting a woman he stabbed from behind as she dies comes off feeling more pornographic than shocking. Storm Shadow's execution of an unseen guard wit ha few flicks of his blade comes off as equally strange and matter-of-fact. When you are watching this movie, thinking kids will be watching this, the lack of horror at these aspects leaves you really cold. There is no thrill from knowing about their future comeuppance, there is no style - it just happens.What I find most telling about this movie is how virtually all of the characters from it are killed off for the sequel to provide a blank slate.

1280731,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B002NXSRVG,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 6]","For many, the outlandish threat of nanotechnology and biochemical warfare utilized by a technologically advanced arms dealer with a plot to rule the world might be slightly over-the-top, but when it comes to the world of G.I. Joe, it's a rather fitting adversary for the elite military group. But there's a difference between those generally accepting of such escapism in toy-based action movies and those who actually possess knowledge of the vast array of characters from the Hasbro-created world. Sadly, the latter group will be dismayed by the drastic changes to their beloved organization (now an international group - so much for A Real American Hero). Costume alterations are almost mandatory these days to avoid the brightly colored garb of once awe-inspiring superheroes, but these Joes have suffered from over-modernization and most are virtually unrecognizable from their comic book and figurine counterparts. Not to mention their individual backstories have undergone such extreme revisions it's a wonder they kept the same code names. At least plenty of stuff blows up.After a deadly biochemical weapon is stolen from their squad during a transport mission, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are introduced to the G.I. Joe, an elite military group of special operatives. Joining the unit in a super-secret underground base known as The Pit, under the command of General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the two soldiers team up with Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Breaker (Said Taghmaoui), and more to stop a maniacal arms dealer hell-bent on world domination.G.I. Joe opens with the phrase ""In the Not Too Distant Future,"" but should have read ""In a Galaxy Far, Far Away..."" With the dizzying amount of futuristic technology, boundless financing and all-encompassing intel, there isn't really anything in the film that's grounded in reality. Least of all the mechanical accelerator suits that give the wearer superhuman powers, the gargantuan undersea laboratory or the nanomite warheads that eat through everything like GORT from the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Few people will recall playing with those creations from the Hasbro toy company. In terms of faithfulness to the original line of figurines that became a household name in the 80s, about all that is retained are the names.Baroness goes through multiple outfit changes like a twisted dark Barbie, Dubble Bubble is now the official gum of the Joes, Ripcord hands out life lessons and theories on attraction and bizarre relationships between the main characters conflict with every comic book and cartoon show storyline before it. With a Wayans brother in the lead and a cameo by Brendan Fraser, the level of seriousness (or lack thereof) is immediately apparent. Even the CG is too ambitious, occasionally slacking on vehicle designs and movement. When a shot of a computer animated polar bear is necessary, perhaps it's time to rethink the amount of graphics to utilize.Director Stephen Sommers also couldn't seem to eliminate the need for Arnold Vosloo (who played the mummy in his earlier films) or pyramids. At least the director embraced nonstop action, destruction and general mayhem (in what seems to be a competition against Roland Emmerich), which gives the film an undeniable level of excitement, even if it's frequently lessened by comical yet authentic ""Knowing is half the battle!"" blurbs. Duke sums it up when he exclaims, ""That was crazy! I didn't expect that!"" after plowing through Paris streets in his accelerator suit to protect a doomed Eiffel Tower. Except that we did expect just about every memorable aspect of G.I. Joe lore to be completely redefined in this explosive, outlandish, and most of all silly, action extravaganza.- The Massie Twins",2,G.I.

In short, I will not be going to any more films directed by Steohen Sommers, unless they have enormously good buzz.I was actually more than a little shocked by how bad this new film is.The acting is terrible; even Dennis Quaid, who plays General Hawk, in charge of a special brigade called ""G.I. Joe"", is usually able to surprise me with his ability to make a film work. In ""Joe"", he looks like he is passing a kidney stone in every scene. Really. He pops up with an incredibly pained expression on his face and barks out his lines like he is trying to get back to the bathroom for another try. Channing Tatum plays Duke, the 'handsome, courageous lead' necessary in such a film. I have never seen Tatum in any other films as a lead, but if ""Joe"" is any indication, the guy is being cast for his looks. He can't act. There are a few moments when he is trying to flirt with his old girlfriend and they come across like a high school kid trying to taunt the girl he is secretly interested in. Christopher Eccleston (a once promising British actor who most recently played the Ninth ""Doctor Who"") Adewale  Akinnuoye-Agbaje (most recently on TV's ""Lost""), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""(500) Days of Summer"") and many others play various characters, heroes and villains, sometimes changing halfway through the film. But it is difficult to tell who is who because the film is soo loud and makes little sense. You get to the point that you really don't care what is going on. Or who is responsible.It really is inconceivable to me why some of the actors are involved in this film. The plot concerns the theft of a new bioweapon developed by Christopher Eccleston's company. Tatum and Marlon Wayans (What the F?) are two soldiers hired to protect the shipment. Soon, they are under attack (in what appears to be a field covered with Astroturf and fake trees) and trying to fend off the baddies. When they start to lose ground, the G.I. Joe brigade shows up to lend a hand. And Tatum keeps saying, ""I want in"". Finally, they let him and Wayans in.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose other film this summer is the far more impressive ""(500) Days of Summer"" plays some sort of doctor. He may be a villain but it is difficult to tell because nothing is extremely clear in this film. Throughout, he wears a Hannibal Lecter-like mask obscuring the bottom of his face and speaks with a voice that seems to mimic the villains in the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" television show. When you start paying homage to a kids show that is generally recognized as one of the worst ever created, something is wrong with your character. More importantly, something is wrong with the film.Finally, they show up at G.I. Joe headquarters and get a tour of all of the special effects direct Sommers has at his disposal. Shockingly, they are really pretty unrealistic looking. Maybe this is due to the shear volume of special effects. At one point, a plane flies into view and the character in the cockpit looks like bad special effects. This continues throughout. I think the key problem is that because there are so many special effects, the entire look of the film becomes flat and 2-D. Everything looks painted and poorly executed.So, back to the title. The film is called ""G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"". It isn't just called ""G.I. Joe"". The title and the film have been set-up to be sequel ready. They are already anticipating making more than one film. This means they expect the film to be a huge hit. Why is that? Because it is filled with special effects, good looking models and a fantastical story? It is for these very reasons there should never be another ""G.I. Joe"" film. Given the fact the film made a tremendous amount of money during the opening weekend, I think we are due for at least one sequel. Given the negative buzz for the first film, perhaps we will only be subjected to one sequel. Let's hope. And pray that the powers that be can hear our pleas over the din of this film.",1,I Wish I Could've Tivo'd Through the Movie,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,4448,"['G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'contemptible', 'title', 'more', 'later', 'newest', 'film', 'perpetrated', 'public', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'Sommers', 'first', 'big', 'hit', 'Mummy', 'was', 'fun', 'loud', 'throwback', 'horror', 'films', '30s', 'only', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'new', 'century', 'then', 'made', 'series', 'sequels', 'other', 'films', 'only', 'proceed', 'get', 'louder', 'more', 'obnoxious.With', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'noise', 'bad', 'sound', 'effects', 'even', 'worse', 'acting', 'new', 'level', 'short', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'going', 'more', 'films', 'directed', 'Steohen', 'Sommers', 'have', 'enormously', 'good', 'buzz.I', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'little', 'shocked', 'how', 'bad', 'new', 'film', 'is.The', 'acting', 'terrible', 'even', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'General', 'Hawk', 'charge', 'special', 'brigade', 'called', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'usually', 'able', 'surprise', 'ability', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Joe', 'passing', 'kidney', 'stone', 'scene', 'Really', 'up', 'incredibly', 'pained', 'expression', 'face', 'out', 'lines', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'bathroom', 'try', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'plays', 'Duke', ""'handsome"", 'courageous', 'lead', 'necessary', 'such', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Tatum', 'other', 'films', 'lead', 'Joe', 'indication', 'guy', 'being', 'cast', 'looks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'trying', 'flirt', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'come', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'trying', 'taunt', 'girl', 'secretly', 'interested', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'once', 'promising', 'British', 'actor', 'who', 'most', 'recently', 'played', 'Ninth', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'most', 'recently', 'TV', 'Lost', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'many', 'others', 'play', 'various', 'characters', 'heroes', 'villains', 'sometimes', 'changing', 'halfway', 'film', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'who', 'film', 'soo', 'loud', 'little', 'sense', 'get', 'point', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'responsible.It', 'really', 'inconceivable', 'why', 'actors', 'are', 'involved', 'film', 'plot', 'theft', 'new', 'bioweapon', 'developed', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'company', 'Tatum', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'What', 'F', 'are', 'two', 'soldiers', 'hired', 'protect', 'shipment', 'Soon', 'are', 'attack', 'what', 'be', 'field', 'covered', 'Astroturf', 'fake', 'trees', 'trying', 'fend', 'off', 'baddies', 'When', 'start', 'lose', 'ground', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'brigade', 'up', 'lend', 'hand', 'Tatum', 'saying', 'want', 'Finally', 'let', 'Wayans', 'in.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'other', 'film', 'summer', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'sort', 'doctor', 'may', 'be', 'villain', 'difficult', 'tell', 'nothing', 'extremely', 'clear', 'film', 'Throughout', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter-like', 'mask', 'obscuring', 'bottom', 'face', 'voice', 'mimic', 'villains', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'television', 'show', 'When', 'start', 'paying', 'homage', 'kids', 'show', 'generally', 'recognized', 'one', 'worst', 'ever', 'created', 'something', 'wrong', 'character', 'More', 'importantly', 'something', 'wrong', 'film.Finally', 'show', 'up', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'headquarters', 'get', 'tour', 'special', 'effects', 'direct', 'Sommers', 'disposal', 'Shockingly', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'looking', 'Maybe', 'due', 'shear', 'volume', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'point', 'plane', 'view', 'character', 'cockpit', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'think', 'key', 'problem', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'entire', 'look', 'film', 'flat', '2-D.', 'Everything', 'painted', 'poorly', 'executed.So', 'back', 'title', 'film', 'called', 'G.', 'I.', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', ""n't"", 'just', 'called', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'title', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'set-up', 'be', 'sequel', 'ready', 'are', 'already', 'anticipating', 'making', 'more', 'one', 'film', 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'huge', 'hit', 'Why', 'filled', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'looking', 'models', 'fantastical', 'story', 'very', 'reasons', 'there', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'film', 'Given', 'fact', 'film', 'made', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'money', 'opening', 'weekend', 'think', 'are', 'due', 'least', 'one', 'sequel', 'Given', 'negative', 'buzz', 'first', 'film', 'perhaps', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'subjected', 'one', 'sequel', 'Let', 'hope', 'pray', 'powers', 'be', 'can', 'hear', 'pleas', 'din', 'film']",N/A
1280736,AA78TCLHXPJOK,B002NXSRVG,Timothy G. Berntsen,"[5, 7]","I grew up watching GI Joe cartoons in the early 90's, when reruns of the Sunbow series would air in the morning and the new episodes from DIC would air in the afternoon. I was crazy about the toys, and managed to amass quite an army back in my heyday. If you're like me and miss the days of smacking around the iconic 4"" plastic soldiers in the back yard, this movie manages to re-capture that same feeling, but for adults. It's big, loud, fun, and full of tanks, lasers, terrorists, ninjas, high-tech gadgets and all that good stuff that made us giddy for the show.That's not to say the movie isn't without problems-- first of all, the special effects are a very mixed bag. A lot of them look fine, but when they're bad, it basically looks like a cartoon. Also, even though Channing Tatum certainly looks the part of Duke, the man simply cannot act. Also, Ripcord's flirting with Scarlett felt completely forced, and his lines sounded like they were written by someone who has never talked to a girl. Also, many fans will probably be disappointed by some of the big changes made to The Baroness in the movie, however I liked Sienna Miller's performance as her enough that I was willing to accept it. Younger fans probably won't care about such changes that much, but the hardcore Baroness fans will.That's not to say the movie isn't without some shining performances, though. As I said, Sienna Miller was good as Baroness, in spite of the changes to her character, and aside from Channing Tatum most of the cast ranges from pretty good to great. One of the real standouts of the movie though, was The Doctor / Cobra Commander. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the movie version very successfully captured the essence of the cartoon version's voice, but at the same time made it much more imposing and threatening sounding. Of all the performances in the movie, I felt that one was the true stand out.And of course, with Snake Eyes being my favorite Joe, I have to mention him in here. I thought they nailed Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow pretty much perfectly, and my only complaint was that Snake Eyes was not in the movie more, and that we didn't get a chance to explore his relationship with Scarlett (which was hinted at, but not elaborated on). Their fight scenes were awesome, and you'd be hard pressed to ask for a better on-screen interpretation of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow without resorting to trivial nitpicking.Overall, this movie gets my seal of approval. It's not perfect, but it was better than most of the other big-budget fair I've seen this summer. I only saw two movies in the theater twice this year: one was Star Trek, and the other was GI Joe. If you're a fan of GI Joe, nostalgic about the 80's, or simply enjoy big loud action movies and military stuff, this movie was made for you.",4,A fun action romp that successfully captures the spirit of the original cartoons and toys.,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2814,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'GI', 'Joe', 'cartoons', 'early', '90', 'when', 'reruns', 'Sunbow', 'series', 'would', 'air', 'morning', 'new', 'episodes', 'DIC', 'would', 'air', 'afternoon', 'was', 'crazy', 'toys', 'managed', 'amass', 'quite', 'army', 'back', 'heyday', ""'re"", 'miss', 'days', 'smacking', 'iconic', '4', 'plastic', 'soldiers', 'back', 'yard', 'movie', 're-capture', 'same', 'feeling', 'adults', 'big', 'loud', 'fun', 'full', 'tanks', 'lasers', 'terrorists', 'ninjas', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'good', 'stuff', 'made', 'giddy', 'show.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'problems', 'first', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'mixed', 'bag', 'lot', 'look', 'fine', 'when', ""'re"", 'bad', 'basically', 'cartoon', 'Also', 'even', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'certainly', 'part', 'Duke', 'man', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'Also', 'Ripcord', 'flirting', 'Scarlett', 'felt', 'completely', 'forced', 'lines', 'sounded', 'were', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'talked', 'girl', 'Also', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'big', 'changes', 'made', 'Baroness', 'movie', 'however', 'liked', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'performance', 'enough', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'Younger', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'such', 'changes', 'much', 'hardcore', 'Baroness', 'will.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shining', 'performances', 'though', 'said', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'was', 'good', 'Baroness', 'spite', 'changes', 'character', 'aside', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'most', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'great', 'One', 'real', 'standouts', 'movie', 'was', 'Doctor', '/', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'spoiling', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'say', 'movie', 'version', 'very', 'successfully', 'captured', 'essence', 'cartoon', 'version', 'voice', 'same', 'time', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'imposing', 'threatening', 'sounding', 'performances', 'movie', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'true', 'stand', 'out.And', 'course', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'being', 'favorite', 'Joe', 'have', 'mention', 'here', 'thought', 'nailed', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfectly', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'explore', 'relationship', 'Scarlett', 'was', 'hinted', 'not', 'elaborated', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'awesome', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'ask', 'better', 'on-screen', 'interpretation', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'resorting', 'trivial', 'nitpicking.Overall', 'movie', 'seal', 'approval', 'not', 'perfect', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'big-budget', 'fair', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'summer', 'only', 'saw', 'two', 'movies', 'theater', 'twice', 'year', 'one', 'was', 'Star', 'Trek', 'other', 'was', 'GI', 'Joe', ""'re"", 'fan', 'GI', 'Joe', 'nostalgic', '80', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'big', 'loud', 'action', 'movies', 'military', 'stuff', 'movie', 'was', 'made']",N/A

1280741,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002NXSRVG,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","First I must confess I do not know much about Hasbro's ""G. I. Joe"" franchise. I have not seen the TV shows. I have not read the comics either. I just went to see ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" as pure entertainment, a summer season blockbuster film helmed by the director of ""The Mummy"" and ""Van Helsing."" Those who have seen these moderately entertaining films know what they will see in theater - exotic locations, beautiful girls and lots of computer-rendered actions.But there is one thing that ""G.I. Joe"" doesn't have - a hero you can relate to. Apparently we are supposed to follow the story of Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), two US soldiers who recently joined the G.I. Joe team led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) after they were attacked by the ""Baroness"" (Sienna Miller), during their mission to transport a nanotechnology-based weapon. Duke happens to know the identity of the Baroness. Then a flashback starts. More than once.There are another story about ninja-like warriors, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow (and another flashback), and a secret about Arnold Vosloo's character, plus one Scotsman who lived in the 17th century and his descendant. The 2-hour film is pretty fast-paced, but there are so many things going on and few of them are really interesting.I like Stephen Sommers' films. I like ""The Mummy"" and, to a lesser degree, ""Van Helsing."" But let's face it. Channing Tatum is no Hugh Jackman. And perhaps no Brendan Fraser either. Also, ""Joe"" really needs Kate Beckinsale, too.The greatest part of the film is, of course, Ray Park as Snake Eyes. Even if you don't see his face, he never disappoints. Some action sequences in Paris (especially the stunts) are wonderful, but still the special effects are average at best.""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is fairly entertaining. However, when the end credits roll, we realize the whole story about G.I. Joe has just begun. But frankly I am not sure the audiences are still interested in the fate of the characters, most of whom are not very interesting. ""G.I.

1280742,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B002NXSRVG,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[1, 3]","Transformers, based on a toy action figure set and animated series, had some interesting characters and a little bit of emotional pull. Some of the characters were memorable (i.e. Bumblebee, the car and Sam Witwicky was likeable and even believable).""GI Joe Rise of Cobra"" -- also based on a toy and animated series, apparently missed what made Transformers a relatively good movie - that is, believable and likeable characters and some drama, besides the unending explosions and destruction that are staples of this type of film.We get treated to enough testosterone from all the cast (male AND female) and so much macho posturing (also from male and female characters) that the movie becomes more plastic than the figures upon which the movie is loosely based.In short, this movie is structured like a 12 year old boy's fantasy come to life. And I expect that's who will appreciate this movie the most. Nothing wrong with  that except, shouldn't a movie have more going for it... like characters and a sensible plot and maybe teach something or impart some wisdom? Isn't the point of play ultimately a learning experience?There's is plenty of action along the line of Star Wars (except Star Wars did it better), along with absolutely unbelievably advanced technology and villains who are so irredeemable and unlikeable, they are pure plastic caricatures of themselves!Much of the acting talent is wasted here in favor of constant posturing -- who is more macho, butch, rough and tough on the part of the ""Joes"", and who is more evil, cunning and ruthless among the legions of COBRA. It's like reading the blurb on the back of the toy's packaging!The movie is also loaded with meaningless dialog that seemed to be filler for the CGI effects. And the logic of the characters makes even less sense. For example, when the hero, Duke, has a chance to stop the extremely and pointlessly evil Doctor Rex (who has turned evil because he got blown up in a bunker of some sort and Duke gave him up for dead) he starts arguing with him! Any sensible soldier would have at least wounded the guy to put him out of action. It IS possible to disarm someone without killing them.And of course, it works the other way around. While the Cobra folks wage battles with the Joes, and plenty of ""extras"" are wounded and killed on both sides (picture a 12 year old with the toys, smashing them against each other and bouncing them off walls and you've pretty much got this movie down), the principle characters insist on arguing with each other instead of disarming each other. And remember, the villains are bent on destroying the world (except for their main opponents apparently) without a second thought.This whole movie is just plain silly. You might enjoy it for the special effects (if you like seeing things explode a lot) and some of the technology (cool looking submarines, planes and land vehicles) but if you are able to think logically, this movie will annoy you more that anything else.Unfortunately the movie is more than just as plastic as the toys... it's as recycled as the plastic is.You'll recognize scenes lifted from the ""Day The Earth Stood Still"" remake, ""Independence Day"", and of course ""Star Wars"", to name a few obvious rip-offs. For example, in this movie we see two rival ninjas with swords battling it out in the hi-tech, electrically sparking COBRA base. We saw the same thing in Star Wars, the two Jedi knights (Obi Wan and Darth Vader) with light sabres battling it out among sparks in the Death Star. Different location, same idea. Star Wars did it better.It might be kind of fun to watch the movie, just to see how much they rip off from other films, could make for an interesting trivia game.And again, if you like seeing mass destruction for no reason, on a really grand scale, this could be the movie for you. As kids we used to try and blow up our GI Joe toys.

Raphael ""AstraDaemon of The Zombiep...","[1, 1]","This was a great action movie, but if you are familiar with the comic series and/or the 80s cartoon, you will be disappointed with the differences. I realize that it's hard to turn an ongoing series into one movie plot, or to make a cartoon look good in live-action, but they should have realized that most of the people who choose to watch this movie are already fans of G.I. Joe (and they will notice every little detail).First of all, G.I. Joe wasn't part of NATO or the UN - they are ""real American heroes"" because G.I. Joe is suppose to be an American orginization. I guess they were trying to be politically correct. I did get a kick out of Brendan Frasier as Sgt. Stone, but kind of silly. Scarlett is suppose to be Snake Eyes woman, not Ripcord - give me a break...and they portrayed the Baroness as Duke's ex-fiance *rolls eyes* I was really disappointed with Cobra Commander - he looked and sounded more like Destro than the actual Destro character (Christopher Eccleston wasn't convincing). The worst part was casting Arnold Vosloo (fromThe Mummy) as Zartan - they pretty much ruined that character...and those just are few of the problems with the movie discrepancies.I did like the scenes with Stormshadow and Snake Eyes, and even the flashbacks weren't too bad (although Stormshadow didn't kill their master). Their fight scenes were some of the best action sequences. In general, lots of explosions, fancy high-tech weapons, etc, as G.I. Joe fights to stop the forces of COBRA from using nano-technology to wreak havoc...lots of flashbacks for several of the characters.  As I said, a great action movie, but a not-so-great crossover from the comic and cartoon.P.S.

1280749,A17B9IJ50LIEVZ,B002NXSRVG,"William A. Smith ""Polymath""","[0, 1]","Yes, I do enjoy brain-dead action films on occasion.  (First warning--potential spoilers.)I will freely admit that I enjoy Stephen Sommers's films. The Mummy remains a perfect example of how to redo a classic horror film in a modern mode, and I for one found that the mash-up of classic horror elements in Van Helsing was great fun, and would not have minded a sequel there. And Sommers' virtues are on display in G.I. Joe--plenty of well-done CGI eye candy, and well-structured (if completely absurd) action sequences that defy the laws of physics. If those elements were enough to justify watching a film, this would be an 8 (on the scale of 10) or higher.But G. I. Joe has a few things missing--a coherent plot for one, and characters that anchor the film. The plot is a generic supervillain exercise (potential spoiler ahead)--evil arms dealer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) is out to rule the world with an elaborate plot involving cheating NATO out of the billions to fund a super-weapon based on so-called nanites (nano-robots in the real world) that can chew through anything and then stealing them back in order to destroy Paris, Moscow, Beijing, and Washington so as to throw the world's confidence onto the US president (Jonathan Pryce) who has been eliminated and replaced by a double (also via nanite--handy little things), henchman Zartan (played by ex-Mummy Arnold Vosloo). One can't judge this sort of plot and related contrivances on much more than superficial plausibility, of course. I will merely note, first, that it is entirely generic, and second, that it has even less logic than usual. (Just once, I would like to see a big budget film like this come up with a plot contrivance like nanites that respects the principle of conversation of mass / energy.) And I haven't even touched some of the more improbable plot contrivances.Of course, one can redeem many sins with good casting. This is not the case here. In early films, Sommers built the improbable action around some remarkably enjoyable performers--Brendan Fraser in The Mummy, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale in Van Helsing. Channing Tatum (whose star is very much in the ascendant after Magic Mike), as Duke, the closest thing to a protagonist this film has, is one attractive slab of beef, and just about as expressive. Ray Park, the inevitable sidekick, is equally formulaic. I don't get Christopher Eccleston at all--here he is a generic villain with a very bad Scots accent (far more Georgie or Glaswegian than Highlands) who chews the scenery with abandon and to little effect. (I don't think I've seen him give a good performance, ever, and that includes Dr. Who.) The two female characters are ciphers. Dennis Quaid and Brendan Fraser are wasted in relatively small parts. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt is unrecognizable under a Darth Vader mask, and is if anything more generic a villain than Eccleston.In a word--all dressed up, no story to tell, and nobody to tell it.Not that this isn't rather enjoyable in a completely brainless way. But the obvious set up for a sequel also somewhat dampens one's enthusiasm.Putting it on my 10 point scale--I'm giving it a 5, watchable if you like this sort of thing. But junk food. A pity, since Sommers is capable of better work. Gregory the movie cat concurs--he watched a few bits, purred once or twice, and slept through most of it.  That translates to an Amazon 3 star.",3,"Entertaining, but brain dead, and not as much fun as it should be",1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,3404,"['Yes', 'do', 'enjoy', 'brain-dead', 'action', 'films', 'occasion', 'First', 'warning', 'potential', 'spoilers', 'will', 'freely', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'films', 'Mummy', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'redo', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'modern', 'mode', 'one', 'found', 'mash-up', 'classic', 'horror', 'elements', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'minded', 'sequel', 'there', 'Sommers', 'virtues', 'are', 'display', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'plenty', 'well-done', 'CGI', 'eye', 'candy', 'well-structured', 'completely', 'absurd', 'action', 'sequences', 'defy', 'laws', 'physics', 'elements', 'were', 'enough', 'justify', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'be', '8', 'scale', '10', 'higher.But', 'G.', 'I.', 'Joe', 'few', 'things', 'missing', 'coherent', 'plot', 'one', 'characters', 'anchor', 'film', 'plot', 'generic', 'supervillain', 'exercise', 'potential', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'evil', 'arms', 'dealer', 'McCullen', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'out', 'rule', 'world', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'involving', 'cheating', 'NATO', 'billions', 'fund', 'super-weapon', 'based', 'so-called', 'nanites', 'nano-robots', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'chew', 'anything', 'then', 'stealing', 'back', 'order', 'destroy', 'Paris', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'Washington', 'so', 'throw', 'world', 'confidence', 'US', 'president', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'who', 'been', 'eliminated', 'replaced', 'double', 'also', 'nanite', 'handy', 'little', 'things', 'henchman', 'Zartan', 'played', 'ex-Mummy', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'sort', 'plot', 'related', 'contrivances', 'much', 'more', 'superficial', 'plausibility', 'course', 'will', 'merely', 'note', 'first', 'entirely', 'generic', 'second', 'even', 'less', 'logic', 'usual', 'Just', 'once', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'nanites', 'principle', 'conversation', 'mass', '/', 'energy', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'touched', 'more', 'improbable', 'plot', 'contrivances.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'redeem', 'many', 'sins', 'good', 'casting', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'early', 'films', 'Sommers', 'built', 'improbable', 'action', 'remarkably', 'enjoyable', 'performers', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Mummy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'star', 'very', 'much', 'ascendant', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'Duke', 'closest', 'thing', 'protagonist', 'film', 'one', 'attractive', 'slab', 'beef', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'expressive', 'Ray', 'Park', 'inevitable', 'sidekick', 'equally', 'formulaic', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'here', 'generic', 'villain', 'very', 'bad', 'Scots', 'accent', 'far', 'more', 'Georgie', 'Glaswegian', 'Highlands', 'who', 'chews', 'scenery', 'abandon', 'little', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'ever', 'Dr', 'Who', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'ciphers', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'are', 'wasted', 'relatively', 'small', 'parts', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'unrecognizable', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'mask', 'anything', 'more', 'generic', 'villain', 'Eccleston.In', 'word', 'dressed', 'up', 'story', 'tell', 'nobody', 'tell', 'it.Not', ""n't"", 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'completely', 'brainless', 'way', 'obvious', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'also', 'somewhat', 'one', 'enthusiasm.Putting', '10', 'point', 'scale', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'watchable', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'junk', 'food', 'pity', 'Sommers', 'capable', 'better', 'work', 'Gregory', 'movie', 'cat', 'concurs', 'watched', 'few', 'bits', 'purred', 'once', 'twice', 'slept', 'most', 'Amazon', '3', 'star']",N/A

Joe universe is very limited. I am however, aware of its characters seeing as how a bunch of my friends used to collect the little action figures. ""G.I. JOE: RISE OF THE COBRA"" directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) was written during the writer's strike and is geared towards a specific audience. I lowered my expectations when I saw this film on dvd, (hey, no writers on duty) and I know this movie was inspired by toys. So how does it hold up?The M.A.R.S. industry had developed a new nanotech technology that was used to cure cancer and is now being re-tooled to be used for military purposes. This nanotech can eat through anything and is able to decimate a city with a small warhead. Arms dealer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) had pitched the technology to N.A.T.O. and the new tech is about to be transported to a NATO base when C.O.B.R.A. a group of high-tech terrorists attack the group of grunts led by Duke (Tatum Channing, Fighting) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans). However, Cobra gets intercepted by a secret counter-terrorist unit called G.I.JOE. The set up for an encounter of high-tech weaponry between COBRA led by the Doctor (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and members Storm shadow, (Lee Byung Hyun, A Bittersweet Life), Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) and the Baroness (Sienna Miller) and the JOES led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) with members Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Breaker (Sad Taghmaoui) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) with new members Duke and Ripcord joining the battle for supremacy with the dangerous nanotech weapon as the final prize.Leave it to Hollywood to try and capitalize on the success of the ""Transformers"" franchise. While there is nothing remotely wrong with this practice, I would have wished that they would have at least come up with a movie that would appear to have been carefully thought out. The plot in ""Rise of the Cobra"" is pretty routine and unimaginative; the label of the ""Real American Hero"" is disposed with and replaced with ""when all fails, we don't"", the plot devices and elements are so predictable and even the twist in the final act was too forced. The film is your typical good vs. evil action movie with an overload of rehearsed explosions and eye candy special effects. Stephen Sommers makes no attempts in trying to add anything intricate plot wise, he knows his intended audience, kids and teenagers who enjoy boisterous displays of senseless action and visual effects.The action scenes in ""G.I. Joe"" are elaborate, loud, stylish and slick. Sommers have a lot of experience in handling caricaturist characters by hiding the flaws of the script by wall to wall action. The movie can be fun to watch, and the slick visuals do have its charm. The mayhem in the film is nicely staged with quick editing tricks, occasional slow-mo that follows the movements of the Joes as they spring into combat. The film does have a very nifty chase scene in the streets of Paris, that scene alone could have saved the movie from mediocrity, and sadly this is also the film's best scenes, as the other action sequences of the film did not match its quality. I would have expected for the final encounter to be much more intense and decisive than for a chase that occurs in the film's halfway point to steal the show. Also, the visual effects are good, but effects without the emotion of high stakes can feel rather superficial and too unreal.The characterization in the film falls into a sad display of cinematic shameless caricatures. I know these characters are toys but I thought Hasbro was selling these for the toys themselves to tell a story. The costumes and gimmicks does appear to have been inspired by the toys, and Lee Byung Hyun and Ray Park makes for a good Storm shadow and Snake Eyes, their past brings a small amount of depth but wasn't fully utilized; but Tatum Channing and Marlon Wayans were miscast and felt very stereotypical. Sienna Miller needed more `gutsy', ruthless aura for her role; Rachel Nichols and Levitt were just so ineffective to the point of almost embarrassing themselves. The links between the Baroness and Duke were also too perfunctory and was obviously added to stimulate some romantic angle that was unneeded. Flashbacks were used to add character development and while the past between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow showed some potential; it just couldn't be the right element to capitalize on.With ""Van Helsing"" and two movies of ""The Mummy"" under his belt, Sommers does know how to shoot eye candy action sequences and repetitive, stylish effects. One should know what he is in for when watching a movie directed by Sommers, it may be fun, popcorn, brainless, unrisky entertainment meant for the general audiences. The G.I. Joe franchise maybe expected not to have any real depth or inventive characterization; and for this expectation, Sommers may be the right man for the job. The movie gives hints of a sequel, and while I knew off the bat that I wasn't the movie's intended audience, I can see how some people can find this movie fun. ""G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra"" doesn't really fail when you consider its source material (which is a toy line) but it also isn't exactly anything special.
