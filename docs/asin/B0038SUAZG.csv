The cover and description makes it look amazing but as soon as it starts you know the acting will be terrible and you hope for great sex, but it just isn't.",1,The cover is deceiving.,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,300,"['was', 'not', 'good', 'hentai', 'art', 'style', 'sucks', 'regret', 'buying', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'Too', 'expensive', 'Waste', 'money', 'cover', 'description', 'look', 'amazing', 'as', 'soon', 'know', 'acting', 'will', 'be', 'terrible', 'hope', 'great', 'sex', 'just', ""n't""]",Slave Market [DVD]
1333200,A22NQ1YA87YYD1,B0038SUAZG,MacConnell Sylvester,"[6, 13]","This film is written and slanted toward sadism with little regard for sexuality and even less for sensuality. The animation is slightly less than the quality that is available with today's technology. If the idea of beating a woman and raping her in a port-o-potty give you a thrill, then this is a movie for you; otherwise, I would not recommend it.",2,BDSM Anime,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,350,"['film', 'written', 'slanted', 'sadism', 'little', 'regard', 'sexuality', 'even', 'less', 'sensuality', 'animation', 'slightly', 'less', 'quality', 'available', 'today', 'technology', 'idea', 'beating', 'woman', 'raping', 'port-o-potty', 'give', 'thrill', 'then', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'recommend']",Slave Market [DVD]

1333202,A1CASZ0FESCPWV,B0038SUAZG,Peter L. Harriss,"[17, 21]","If you ae cursed with knowing too much history, this tale is full of howlers! One historical blunder after another but - what the hell, there is enough explicit and kinky sex to satisfy the most libidinous of us. The girls are pretty. villians villianous and the hero sufficently heroic. The graphics are reasonably good and thespeech patterns discernable enough to carry meaning out of the story.Having said all that, look at the DVD and enjoy it. We are over-clocking our brains to expect too much out of such material. We should be thankful the author and producer put Constantinople (which is what they entitle Istanbul) on the Bosphorus and even heard of the Thirty Years War.
