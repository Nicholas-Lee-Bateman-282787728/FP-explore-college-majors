However, character alone does not make up for plot holes one can drive a carrier group through. Nor does it make up for acting that imitates the sound of wood. What I liked, as part of the tradition of European cinema, was the rich attention to detail in the movie- colors, tapestries, landscape, all create a sensuality to the visual landscape that places one firmly in it. But, visual narrative techniques cannot supplant plot holes and cartoonish dialogue. Example A- in the midst of a critical board meeting, an initial suspect for the murder of Nerio Winch is himself assassinated, in front of the entire board of Nerio Winch's company, by gunshot wounds to the head. The filming is graphic. The protagonist, Largo Winch, Nerio's adopted son, attempts to follow the assassin. The scene ends with his discovery of a favorite secretary of his father's sitting on the toilet. They casually exchange pleasantries before she closes the door to resume her business. This is the end of the sequence to the assassination of the accountant for his father's company. None of the scenes subsequent mention or allude to the fact of the assassination. Instead, the next scene depicts the board as it convenes to scheme on how to defeat the takeover attempt by a Russian baddie, with no reference to the dramatic death which had occurred in front of them moments earlier. Also, hearing these actors deliver their lines made me appreciate Hollywood studio actors all the more. The thud of Largo Winch's dialogue, in some cases, was almost sonically audible.",3,Why Hollywood rules,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1655,"['nice', 'see', 'character', 'action', 'thriller', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'never', 'got', 'much', 'backstory', 'remember', 'However', 'character', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'one', 'can', 'drive', 'carrier', 'group', 'make', 'up', 'acting', 'sound', 'wood', 'What', 'liked', 'part', 'tradition', 'European', 'cinema', 'was', 'rich', 'attention', 'detail', 'movie-', 'colors', 'tapestries', 'landscape', 'create', 'sensuality', 'visual', 'landscape', 'one', 'firmly', 'visual', 'narrative', 'techniques', 'can', 'not', 'supplant', 'plot', 'holes', 'cartoonish', 'dialogue', 'Example', 'A-', 'midst', 'critical', 'board', 'meeting', 'initial', 'suspect', 'murder', 'Nerio', 'Winch', 'assassinated', 'front', 'entire', 'board', 'Nerio', 'Winch', 'company', 'gunshot', 'wounds', 'head', 'filming', 'graphic', 'protagonist', 'Largo', 'Winch', 'Nerio', 'adopted', 'son', 'attempts', 'follow', 'assassin', 'scene', 'discovery', 'favorite', 'secretary', 'father', 'sitting', 'toilet', 'casually', 'exchange', 'pleasantries', 'door', 'resume', 'business', 'end', 'sequence', 'assassination', 'accountant', 'father', 'company', 'None', 'scenes', 'subsequent', 'mention', 'allude', 'fact', 'assassination', 'Instead', 'next', 'scene', 'board', 'scheme', 'how', 'defeat', 'takeover', 'attempt', 'Russian', 'baddie', 'reference', 'dramatic', 'death', 'had', 'occurred', 'front', 'moments', 'earlier', 'Also', 'hearing', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'made', 'appreciate', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'actors', 'more', 'thud', 'Largo', 'Winch', 'dialogue', 'cases', 'was', 'almost', 'sonically', 'audible']",N/A

1289629,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B002UADLXG,Brian Maitland,"[1, 6]","Honestly, one of the stupidest movies ever. It plays across a grand canvas in exotic locales such as a Croatian island lagoon, a Brazilian Amazonian outback to the skyscrapers of Hong Kong's financial district. It looks like some sort of James Bond movie but mashes in all this corporate intrigue. The most laughable part is the climactic scene is set against this race to get to a ""general meeting"" at corporate HQ.I do believe there are good-looking people in France but this French movie cast what is possibly the most unattractive lead actors ever. If the producers wanted us to connect with this Largo Winch (what is up with that name when the guy was supposed to be Croatian), you know looks do count. Throw in the hooker turned industrial espionage spy who although cute to some extent is no beauty...and then there's the always mannish Kristin Scott Thomas as well as the evil protagonist. Oh brother, if you are going to go this pseudo Bond route, at least cast some hot babe as the spy and an even hotter Daniel Craig meets Sean Connery as the hero.The plot is completely ridiculous where (now get this) Largo has to retrieve the actual ten physical shares in the Winch Corporation that allow him to take over from his murdered father. These shares are not in some bank vault in Switzerland. No, they're in a safe on some abandoned island formerly used by a monastic order off Croatian shores.I could go on but it almost has to be seen to be believed. It's like some B movie soap opera plot with a budget from the biggest Bond movies for the action scenes which, frankly, are not blow-your-socks-off Bourne flick level at all. In this day and age the movie comes across as cinematically great looking but as hollow as can be plot- and character development-wise.The extras feature interviews all in French with the lead actor (Tomer Sisley...and you thought Largo Winch was a bizarre name, Homer...uh, Topher...uh, Tomer), KST, the author of the book (this plot is based on a book?), the screenwriter and the director.Also, if you do want to watch this DVD, set the movie to ""English"" and the subtitles to ""None."" When the actors speak French or Croatian or whatever, subtitles will automatically pop up in English. It took me 20 minutes to figure that out as I thought this was a French movie at the start and set it for ""French"" with ""English"" set for the subtitles. You do that and you get subtitling as if the viewer is deaf. For example, when Largo and the hooker/spy are in Brazil you get the subtitle ""(moaning)"" in case you don't understand those noises they are making while getting it on.",2,worst looking cast ever,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,2608,"['Honestly', 'one', 'stupidest', 'movies', 'ever', 'grand', 'canvas', 'exotic', 'locales', 'such', 'Croatian', 'island', 'lagoon', 'Brazilian', 'Amazonian', 'outback', 'skyscrapers', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'financial', 'district', 'sort', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'mashes', 'corporate', 'intrigue', 'most', 'laughable', 'part', 'climactic', 'scene', 'set', 'race', 'get', 'general', 'meeting', 'corporate', 'HQ.I', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'good-looking', 'people', 'France', 'French', 'movie', 'cast', 'what', 'possibly', 'most', 'unattractive', 'lead', 'actors', 'ever', 'producers', 'wanted', 'connect', 'Largo', 'Winch', 'what', 'up', 'name', 'when', 'guy', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Croatian', 'know', 'do', 'count', 'Throw', 'hooker', 'turned', 'industrial', 'espionage', 'spy', 'who', 'cute', 'extent', 'beauty', 'then', 'always', 'mannish', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'protagonist', 'Oh', 'brother', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'pseudo', 'Bond', 'route', 'least', 'cast', 'hot', 'babe', 'spy', 'even', 'hotter', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'meets', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'hero.The', 'plot', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'where', 'now', 'get', 'Largo', 'retrieve', 'actual', 'ten', 'physical', 'shares', 'Winch', 'Corporation', 'allow', 'take', 'over', 'murdered', 'father', 'shares', 'are', 'not', 'bank', 'vault', 'Switzerland', 'No', ""'re"", 'safe', 'abandoned', 'island', 'formerly', 'used', 'monastic', 'order', 'Croatian', 'shores.I', 'could', 'go', 'almost', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'B', 'movie', 'soap', 'opera', 'plot', 'budget', 'biggest', 'Bond', 'movies', 'action', 'scenes', 'frankly', 'are', 'not', 'blow-your-socks-off', 'Bourne', 'flick', 'level', 'day', 'age', 'movie', 'cinematically', 'great', 'looking', 'as', 'hollow', 'can', 'be', 'plot-', 'character', 'development-wise.The', 'extras', 'feature', 'interviews', 'French', 'lead', 'actor', 'Tomer', 'Sisley', 'thought', 'Largo', 'Winch', 'was', 'bizarre', 'name', 'Homer', 'uh', 'Topher', 'uh', 'Tomer', 'KST', 'author', 'book', 'plot', 'based', 'book', 'screenwriter', 'director.Also', 'do', 'want', 'watch', 'DVD', 'set', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'None', 'When', 'actors', 'speak', 'French', 'Croatian', 'subtitles', 'will', 'automatically', 'pop', 'up', 'English', 'took', '20', 'minutes', 'figure', 'out', 'thought', 'was', 'French', 'movie', 'start', 'set', 'French', 'English', 'set', 'subtitles', 'do', 'get', 'subtitling', 'viewer', 'deaf', 'example', 'when', 'Largo', 'hooker/spy', 'are', 'Brazil', 'get', 'subtitle', 'moaning', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'noises', 'are', 'making', 'getting']",N/A

This film has the WORST transitions I have ever experienced! I found myself looking at the characters' hair to figure out ""when"" we were, and sadly, becoming more interested in how odd Largo's hair looked at times.The acting was stilted, wooden, and the only characters I managed to care about were the family's loyal manservant on the yacht and an unnamed boy at the end. None of the others were remotely believable. Very disappointing since there were some very familiar faces in the cast, actors I like very much, and their characters should have been larger than life. They were doomed by the constraints of this dreadful, horrible project.I remain confused about how the paranoia and vigilance of Largo and his father was pounded into everyone's heads, but the two let down their guard every second of the movie. We were constantly told how smart they were but aside from the looks of concentration, there were mountains of evidence against it. Revealing to a room full of enemies that hidden ""Bearer Bonds"" are the only proof of the legitimate heir? THAT was not even the most stupid idea of the plot...imagine!Not knowing anything about the production--and after watching it-- not caring, I had the impression that there were more than 3 different directors and that the scripts may have been completely destroyed on more than one occasion, then had to be completely reconstructed without the benefit of seeing film already shot. I have no idea what happened in editing.In case there is any doubt, I do not recommend watching this film for any reason.

1289638,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002UADLXG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","For decades, many people in Europe grew up reading the ""Largo Winch"" novels (by Jean Van Hamme) or the Belgian comic book series (by Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme) have been intrigued by this character and its action-packed storyline.The novels would lead to a TV series in Germany in 2001 and in 2008, a French film titled ""Largo Winch"" was released, followed by a sequel titled ""Largo Winch II: The Burma Conspiracy"" in 2011. Directed by J&eacute;rme Salle (writer of ""The Tourist"", ""Duplicity"" and ""Anthony Zimmer""),  ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" would be nominated for ""Best International Film"" at the 2012 Saturn Awards and now, the first film titled ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Music Box Films in March 2012.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:The film is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 and presented in French and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English subtitles. While the film has been released on Blu-ray in other countries, as of now, Music Box Films will be releasing ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" on DVD.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD comes with a special digital comic of ""Largo Winch"" Issue #1 ""The Heir"", the Making of Largo Winch featurette and the theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:While watching ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"", there is no doubt that this French film was a major attempt to create an action thriller along the lines of ""Bourne Identity"", ""Die Hard""etc.First the good news.  The good news is that for action fans, what you get with ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" is a straight-up popcorn action film.  A lot of vehicles are totaled, a lot of firearms are fired and a lot of fighting.  Also, because the eponymous Largo Winch is not your average protagonist and is rough around the edges, he's definitely a character that kicks a lot of ass!Now the not so good news.It's formulaic and overly predictable.  But the worst offender is the spotty acting in this film.""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" had intriguing potential but according to fans, the French film strays away from the comic books too much for its own good.  Among the criticisms is that Largo Winch is to supposed to live in the New York at the Winch Building but instead, he operates from a yacht near Hong Kong and not all characters are represented in this first film.The film has an international flavor, which is great!  Unfortunately, the acting is quite weak and while the English conversations will work on most countries outside of the United States, for me, some characters don't seem natural enough in their dialogue and it really makes this film out to be more of a B-film.  Most of the time, I was hoping Kristin Scott Thomas would come back on screen because at least she is actress that can deliver and possibly save the scene.Along with Kristin Scott Thomas, I did enjoy seeing Tomer Sisley as Largo Winch.  I know the character may be too different from what people have read and seen of the character in the original comic book series, but I felt he did a good job playing Largo Winch.  He doesn't have the typical muscles-bulging action hero, if anything, he seemed like a stoic, carefree free spirit doing whatever he wants and he fit that mold perfectly.And also, it was great to see ""Babylon A.D."" actress Melanie Thierry playing the double role of Lea/Naomi and although her scenes were limited to a sex and massage scene and few other minor shots, the actress also had wonderful chemistry with actor Tomer Sisley onscreen.Overall, I really wanted to enjoy ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" and really hoped to see an action thriller with the comic book hero Largo Winch and if anything, show that Europeans can make excellent action thrillers based on a comic book character.  I was hoping to watch a film with not just attention to the action but overall storyline but ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" became too simplistic and banal.After all, with the corporate backstabbing and your not so clean cut protagonist, this could have been a film that would rival James Bond, Jason Bourne or John McClane.  And while the film started off with a lot of excitement, with plenty of action and a passionate sex scene all within the first 20-minutes of the film, unfortunately the pacing starts to go way off, the storyline and acting starts to spiral downward and all that is left is the film's action sequences which were good but not awesome!In the end, ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" will appeal to audiences wanting a straightforward popcorn action film.

But on the other hand there is something wrong.Here's the scoop. Nerio Winch, a self made billionaire, heads a huge but tumultuous empire. He is killed by a rival trying to stage a hostile takeover of his company, but he has an ace up his sleeve. He has an adopted son, Largo, who nobody knows about. Can Largo step up, take charge, get to the root of the takeover and thwart the dastardly plans of the perpetrators?This feels a lot like the ""Bourne"" films. Very big and slick. It takes place over several countries so it has that feeling of international intrigue. The difference here is that you're dealing with big business as opposed to the intelligence community. But Largo poses a problem. In the beginning of the film he's a Bruce Wayne type. Big adventurer who seems to attract trouble. He rather shuns his father's wealth and privilege. But then he steps up and does an immediate 180. He not only knows the ins and outs of this world, he seems steeped in it. I didn't buy it. And it seems some scenes might have been cut because he'll untangle a really messy plot and the viewer doesn't see where he got the information to do so. And it all got wrapped up so nice and pretty at the end I almost went into a diabetic coma. Sorry. Things don't happen that way.This is a fun film done up in big Hollywood style. All the production values were top of the heap. With the exception of a couple of odd cuts it was edited well. If you're given to this sort of thing you'll probably enjoy it.

But the treasure is not just laying around for him to soak in... Largo has to fight to take and keep what is his from pretty much anyone with a pulse in his life.I enjoyed this movie even with the sub titles. It is shot with multiple languages woven into the discourse including English. That added to the meatiness like a good stew. Don't be looking for James Bond (Daniel Craig) style action or even physiques but the 'fisticuffs' in the various knife fights and kickem ups are good and scrappy.Tomer Sisley does a good job showing a range of emotions in this movie. He is not a polished actor but he has some raw talent and a genuine face... i.e. his emotions are very believable. I did find him a bit 'Kramer-like' in some of the running scenes but he has that type of face and hair so it was inevitable.Steve Waddington shows up in a bad guy role and it the first time I have seen him since he was hung up in a fire in the Last of the Mohicans. He has been in a few other flicks since then but they haven't been on my watch list. All in all... you won't be disappointed in the rental. Definitely not a PG-13 as there is a steamy 40 second love scene with some after glow, 'heavy petting' as well as some death, gore and blood with gun shots to the head and body and a drowning/murder scene.Against other movies similar to this I would have gone 3 stars but there were some good plot twists, cinematography, beautiful scenery and action so I bumped it up as it worked hard to differentiate itself.

A worthy DVD though and my customers have been asking for it daily.The story follows an unwilling yet physically and mentally adept heir to a multi-billion dollar corporate empire as he trots the globe, first for himself then later throughout the film to find who murdered his father and is conspiring to take over the Group. The camera work is great as they went all over the world to film and used some beautiful aerial angles with each switch. The story is told out of sequence over five different times in our main character's life, but I enjoyed how they played out, especially with the final two plot twists. There are a couple scenes where you have to suspend some reality (James Bond-ish kind of events) but they kept it real otherwise.The picture quality is good, but it NEEDS a Blu treatment as this could be an amazing transfer. The sound is solid, with both English and French mixed tracks, and a reversible cover that is either French or English text. The five interview supplements all last less than a few minutes but are French only with no subtitles. For those that might be concerned, almost half of the movie is in English at varying times, but the scenery, stunts and pacing can keep the attention span if the remaining subtitles bother you that much.",5,"Excellent film, wish it was readily available",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1398,"['one', 'slipped', 'radar', 'solid', 'action/suspense', 'movie', 'yet', 'be', 'distribution', 'here', 'States', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'customers', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'story', 'unwilling', 'yet', 'physically', 'mentally', 'adept', 'heir', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'corporate', 'empire', 'globe', 'first', 'then', 'later', 'film', 'find', 'who', 'murdered', 'father', 'conspiring', 'take', 'over', 'Group', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'went', 'world', 'film', 'used', 'beautiful', 'aerial', 'angles', 'switch', 'story', 'told', 'sequence', 'five', 'different', 'times', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'especially', 'final', 'two', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'have', 'suspend', 'reality', 'James', 'Bond-ish', 'kind', 'events', 'kept', 'real', 'otherwise.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'Blu', 'treatment', 'could', 'be', 'amazing', 'transfer', 'sound', 'solid', 'English', 'French', 'mixed', 'tracks', 'reversible', 'cover', 'French', 'English', 'text', 'five', 'interview', 'supplements', 'last', 'less', 'few', 'minutes', 'are', 'French', 'only', 'subtitles', 'might', 'be', 'concerned', 'almost', 'half', 'movie', 'English', 'varying', 'times', 'scenery', 'stunts', 'pacing', 'can', 'keep', 'attention', 'span', 'remaining', 'subtitles', 'bother', 'much']",N/A
