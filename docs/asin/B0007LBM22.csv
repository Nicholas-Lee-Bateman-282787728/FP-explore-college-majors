881941,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,B0007LBM22,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[53, 58]","We've had to wait an entire year for the release of season two.  I hope this is not the case for future releases.  I'm especially looking forward to season 4 which has my all time favorite ""Walton"" episode in it....""The Burnout""...the episode when the house is gutted by fire in the middle of the night.  But, back to season two.  I agree with the reviewer below with the tight packaging and the 2 sided disks are a pain with them overlapping and all.  But besides that, the quality of the DVDs are wonderful, the show is timeless and the episodes are first rate! My particular favorite is ""The Gift"" with a young Ron Howard guest starring as Jason's best friend who has leukemia.  This episode is a real tearjerker and I cry buckets every time I see it.  Its not full of sap sentimentality but honest truth about loss and grief.  There are two memorable scenes in this episode.  The first is Ron Howard (Seth) running out into the woods after he finds out that he has only a short time to live.  He runs out and screams and cries his heart out because of the unfairness of it all.  The other scene is the poignant and touching guidance and wisdom to Jason from Grandpa (Will Geer)helping him cope with the grief that is hurting him so much.  Jon Walmsley as Jason is outstanding in this episode and the haunting strains of ""beautiful dreamer"" as he plays it on the flute at the end....well...just have the kleenex handy!!  How can you honestly compare the wasteland that television has become today with a program like the Waltons?  Its wonderful to see a quality program like this restored with quality!  I'll take a program like ""The Waltons"" and pit it against all the reality crap on TV these days.  Do your youngsters and family a favor and ""watch"" ""The Waltons"" together as a family!  If they don't want to, ""make them"".  My parents did that with me and I turned out o.k.  We need to restructure the familial moral fiber in AMERICA today and programs like ""The Waltons"" are a good place to start!",5,KEEP 'EM COMIN',1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,2003,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'wait', 'entire', 'year', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'hope', 'not', 'case', 'future', 'releases', ""'m"", 'especially', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '4', 'time', 'favorite', 'Walton', 'episode', 'Burnout', 'episode', 'when', 'house', 'gutted', 'fire', 'middle', 'night', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'tight', 'packaging', '2', 'sided', 'disks', 'are', 'pain', 'overlapping', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'show', 'timeless', 'episodes', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'particular', 'favorite', 'Gift', 'young', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'guest', 'starring', 'Jason', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'leukemia', 'episode', 'real', 'tearjerker', 'cry', 'buckets', 'time', 'see', 'not', 'full', 'sap', 'sentimentality', 'honest', 'truth', 'loss', 'grief', 'are', 'two', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'episode', 'first', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Seth', 'running', 'out', 'woods', 'out', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'out', 'screams', 'cries', 'heart', 'unfairness', 'other', 'scene', 'poignant', 'touching', 'guidance', 'wisdom', 'Jason', 'Grandpa', 'Will', 'Geer', 'helping', 'cope', 'grief', 'hurting', 'so', 'much', 'Jon', 'Walmsley', 'Jason', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'haunting', 'strains', 'beautiful', 'dreamer', 'flute', 'end', '.well', 'just', 'have', 'kleenex', 'handy', 'How', 'can', 'honestly', 'compare', 'wasteland', 'television', 'become', 'today', 'program', 'Waltons', 'wonderful', 'see', 'quality', 'program', 'restored', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'take', 'program', 'Waltons', 'pit', 'reality', 'crap', 'TV', 'days', 'Do', 'youngsters', 'family', 'favor', 'watch', 'Waltons', 'together', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'parents', 'did', 'turned', 'out', 'o.k', 'need', 'restructure', 'familial', 'moral', 'fiber', 'AMERICA', 'today', 'programs', 'Waltons', 'are', 'good', 'place', 'start']",The Waltons: Season 2

Premiering on CBS in the Fall of 1972, the hour-long drama series chronicled the lives of a tightly-knit mountain family living during the Depression era. Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based The Waltons on his true-to-life story of growing up in the Hamner family. Noted for its family-oriented subject matter (and absence of torrid sex and violence), The Waltons paved the way for the success of the popular TV series Little House On The Prairie (1974). And, in the aftermath of the cancellation of The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Green Acres (1965), proved wrong the assertion of some CBS executives that shows with rural settings were becoming unpopular. Celebrated for its raw depiction of the human experience, The Waltons towers above modern day television dramas by laying claim to the added weight today's critics give to ""realism"" in a series while simultaneously avoiding the bad language, adult content, and gratuitous violence that often accompany those shows which earn such a designation...The Waltons follows the daily lives of the various members of the Walton family as they make a living working their humble saw mill on Walton's Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Set in the 1930's, the series unfolds through the eyes of John Boy (Richard Thomas). An aspiring writer, John Boy chronicles life on Walton Mountain where his parents, John Sr. (Ralph Waite) and Olivia (Michael Learned), raise their seven children (John Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Erin, Ben, Jim-Bob, and Elizabeth) with the aid of live-in grandparents Esther (Ellen Corby) and Zeb (Will Greer) Walton. A wide array of supporting characters live near the Waltons, including Reverend Fordwick (portrayed by Three's Company star John Ritter), the Godseys, the Baldwins, and various others. As the trials of the Great Depression fade into the tribulations of World War II, the Waltons connect with every facet of the human experience - love, marriage, birth, death, aging, social ills, and the numerous travails of life, making The Waltons one of the most popular shows in television history...The Waltons (Season 2) DVD features a number of memorable episodes including the season premiere ""The Journey"" in which Maggie McKenzie would like to see the ocean one last time in her life, and John Boy agrees to take her, although he must miss an important dance in order to do so. Meanwhile, Grandpa Zeb and the kids nurse and injured bird back to health. This episode is also notable because it boasts of being the only show of series in which creator Earl Hamner (playing the role of Maggie's wife) appears... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Fawn"" in which Erin nurses an injured fawn back to health while John Boy becomes a collections agent for a notorious landlord, and ""The Honeymoon"" in which John Sr. and Olivia enjoy a belated honeymoon in Virginia Beach...Below is a list of episodes included on The Waltons (Season 2) DVD:Episode 26 (The Journey)Episode 27 (The Odyssey)Episode 28

Though I always found Richard Thomas (John-Boy) a bit ""actor-ish"" in his role, the series always hung on the excellent performances of Ralph Waite and Miss Michael Learned, (Did she ever get married, I wonder?) as well as the rest of the excellent cast.The strength of the show is the great writing and the excellent relationships the characters had with each other. Things rarely got bored, tedious, or drawn-out, even though the material covered a lot of topics. Things always seemed very interesting around Walton's mountain.I really identified with the people on this show. They were wholesome and believable in an entirely different way than on shows like Father Knows Best. Because the episodes are set in the 30's and 40's, they never go out of style.

Instead, I will tell you why I feel this DVD set is perhaps is the best series that ever aired on TV, and is true family entertainment.The Waltons first aired in 1972 on CBS. It was considered ""hokey"" by some of the critics of the day, yet it captured the hearts of the viewers and went on to be one of the finest long-running series on TV. It captured peoples hearts because it told stories of real people, real people in a family that loved and cared for each other. Although many of the stories are of course fictional, the writer, Earl Hamner (who is actually John-boy), weaves fiction with real-life drama and shows how his loving family dealt with the hard times they grew up in, and how they related to each other with love. In essence, the Waltons shows the viewer what all of us would like our families to be like. One cannot help caring about the characters because Hamner does such a great job of developing their unique personalities for us. The actors and actresses that play his family are perfect for the parts, and even though many of them are just children, their realistic acting makes one believe they are actually a real family. The series is carried on the shoulders of three central characters, John-Boy (Richard Thomas), his mother Olivia Walton (Michael Learned), and Father John Walton (played by Ralph Waite). All three are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and earned honors and accolades for their depiction of Hamner's family. When these three characters eventually left ths show in later years, the show itself folded.If you have never seen The Waltons on TV, my suggestion is that you buy the first season shows before viewing the second season set.  Although not entirely necessary, as each show is a complete story, the first season will unveil the general themes and storylines that help you to better understand the characters and their dire economic situation (the Great Depression).  You will also learn that although the Waltons had little money, they were not ""poor"" when it came to their bond of family love for one another.  The second season, (24 episodes) is just as good as the first season, with family stories that will capture your heart. The second season won several awards, an emmy for Michael Learned (Olivia Walton) and an emmy for writer Joanna Lee for her script, ""The Thanksgiving Story"".I watch the Walton shows with my own 6 children and even in these modern days with so many other distractions, my kids are thrilled with the stories. Each child relates to a particular Walton child, and after finishing an episode, they beg to watch another.  I hope that they will learn family values by watching the Walton family interact with each other.  I know that I have garnered some parenting tips from John Walton.Television does not get better than The Waltons. I recommend this series for those viewers who desire more family values and less violence, sex, and questionable language and topics in their tv viewing. This is true family values TV, and I wish we had something like it today. The Waltons will capture your heart, and you will come to love the characters and care about them.

I would only add that the WB could have stuck The Waltons seasons in a box like that which CBS/Paramount's packaged Beauty and Beast in. B&B; season sets consist of thin boxes in which each disc has been placed on a separate disc holder. This makes it less likely that discs will damaged during transit or during use.As for the transfer, its quite poor. I don't know what the original elements are like but there is noticeable damage in the transfer as well variable quality in the film elements themselves--pops, clicks, graininess, variable levels of brightness. I suspect that WB did the least possible when they put together this package and it shows.Finally, let me add my two cents worth on the other bargain basement aspects of the set. As others have noted there are no commentaries, there are no extras that I can find, there are no chapters, there are no English subtitles, and you have to manually turn off the French subtitles.In sum, the WB should be ashamed. They won't be, however, because it's not about the fans and it's not about the show. It's about money--the WB making the most money with the least amount of effort on their part.
