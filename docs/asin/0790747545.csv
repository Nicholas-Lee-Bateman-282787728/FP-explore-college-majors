It has a plot and storyline and everything but not much quality to it. There's not particular climax though their is a so-called climax towards the end where you can actually sense what is going to happen so makes it less exciting.Personally, if your looking for a GOOD movie, you should go and look for something else but if your looking for a good twins from the Olsen Twins, try &quot;Passport To Paris&quot; or &quot;Billboard Dad&quot; which were a pleasant surprise to me.",3,Very Cute!,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,869,"['Olsen', 'Twins', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'really', 'cute', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movies', 'can', 'actually', 'pass', 'good', 'fantastic', 'considering', ""'m"", 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'movies', 'definitely', 'talented', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'cute', 'funny', 'movies', 'up', 'sleeve.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'boys', 'soccer', 'cute', 'clothes', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'plot', 'storyline', 'everything', 'not', 'much', 'quality', 'not', 'particular', 'climax', 'so-called', 'climax', 'end', 'where', 'can', 'actually', 'sense', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'so', 'less', 'exciting.Personally', 'looking', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'look', 'something', 'else', 'looking', 'good', 'twins', 'Olsen', 'Twins', 'try', 'quot', 'Passport', 'Paris', 'quot', 'quot', 'Billboard', 'Dad', 'quot', 'were', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",N/A
