1388905,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0047UJBJA,Andres C. Salama,"[28, 35]","This acceptable biopic deals basically with the pretrial interrogation of Adolf Eichmann after he was captured in Argentina and brought to Israel. In the interrogation, he insists his role in the Holocaust was minor, just a sort of transport commissioner who has to make sure the different prisoners arrive on time at each concentration camp. This is contrasted with flashbacks from Eichmann during World War II, showing him directly in charge of the extermination of Jews. His main interrogator is a police captain, and the movie shows some of his background, how his role affects his family life, etc. German actor Thomas Kretschmann, who has made a career of playing Nazi officers (in Downfall, Stalingrad and Valkyrie, for instance) is very good as the Nazi criminal. So is Troy Garity playing the Israeli detective. Maybe the movie would have benefited from a larger scope - it includes nothing of Eichmann during the trial itself, very few about his life in Argentina, his capture is dealt in just one quick scene. And there were a few scenes that sounded false to me. For example, Eichmann is seen making love to a Hungarian mistress during the war and to get her hot he tells her the amounts of people he ordered killed. Or in another scene the same lady dares Eichmann to kill a baby. Maybe it really happened but the way it is portrayed in the movie sounded downright false and tasteless to me.

For a long time, I have viewed several publications in print and film about Eichmann.  Here is a DVD which has a balanced presentation of Adolf Eichmann as a Husband, Father, soldier - and the monster that he was.  Just like the trials at Nuremberg, Eichmann could not justify his behaviors as &#34;just following orders&#34; because he &#34;was in uniform&#34; and &#34;on the lower chain of command.&#34;  He was a key player in the Ende Eintung (The Final Solution)!  I am proud of my Uncles who fought in Europe during WW II,  and they would endorse my praise of the authorities in Israel who refused to become like the enemy whom they defeated:  This was completely exemplified in the professionalism and person in real life portrayal of Captain Avner Less.  Captain Less pursued justice with civility. The best example of his dedication to the natural law, was Eichmann, before his execution gave Captain Less a letter to send to his Sons in Argentina.  The entire Western world should have rose in praise and applause, as Captain Less discreetly put the letter in the mail to Eichmann's 3 Sons.  The character of Captain Less - firm but also tempered with mercy and compassion - was a demonstration of the Greatness and Justice to be found in the people of Israel.",5,Eichmann,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,1440,"['Officer', 'USAF', 'one', 'interests', 'been', 'Nuremberg', 'War', 'Crimes', 'Trials', 'emphasis', 're-establish', 'Natural', 'Law', 'international', 'standard', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'viewed', 'several', 'publications', 'print', 'film', 'Eichmann', 'Here', 'DVD', 'balanced', 'presentation', 'Adolf', 'Eichmann', 'Husband', 'Father', 'soldier', 'monster', 'was', 'Just', 'trials', 'Nuremberg', 'Eichmann', 'could', 'not', 'justify', 'behaviors', '34', 'just', 'following', 'orders', '34', '34', 'was', 'uniform', '34', '34', 'lower', 'chain', 'command.', '34', 'was', 'key', 'player', 'Ende', 'Eintung', 'Final', 'Solution', 'am', 'proud', 'Uncles', 'who', 'fought', 'Europe', 'WW', 'II', 'would', 'endorse', 'praise', 'authorities', 'Israel', 'who', 'refused', 'become', 'enemy', 'whom', 'defeated', 'was', 'completely', 'exemplified', 'professionalism', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'Avner', 'Less', 'Captain', 'Less', 'pursued', 'justice', 'civility', 'best', 'example', 'dedication', 'natural', 'law', 'was', 'Eichmann', 'execution', 'gave', 'Captain', 'Less', 'letter', 'send', 'Sons', 'Argentina', 'entire', 'Western', 'world', 'should', 'have', 'rose', 'praise', 'applause', 'Captain', 'Less', 'discreetly', 'put', 'letter', 'mail', 'Eichmann', '3', 'Sons', 'character', 'Captain', 'Less', 'firm', 'also', 'tempered', 'mercy', 'compassion', 'was', 'demonstration', 'Greatness', 'Justice', 'be', 'found', 'people', 'Israel']",N/A

1388909,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0047UJBJA,Grady Harp,"[88, 103]","EICHMANN is not an easy film to view: revisiting the atrocities of the Nazi Third Reich through the greasy, smooth, denying words of Adolf Eichmann is a nightmare, but a nightmare we must revisit periodically to remind us of just how heinous was that period of history.  The film is set in 160 - 1962 and is based on transcripts obtained by the Israeli forces from the files of the concentration camps and Nazi regime, transcripts that document the words of Adolf Eichmann that lead to his final confession of his participation in the Third Reich atrocities as unveiled under the slow and insidious interview by Police Captain Avner Less.The film opens after the 1960 capture of Eichmann from his home in Argentina, the country where he and his wife and four sons had been in hiding since the end of WW II. Adolf Eichmann (brilliantly portrayed by Thomas Kretschmann) had been the World's Most Wanted Man and his transport to Israel was met by jeering crowds. The Israeli Minister Tormer (Stephen Fry) elects police captain Avner Less (Troy Garity) to conduct the interview in what is supposed to be a top-secret assignment.  But the news escapes and Avner's wife Vera (Franka Potente), suffering from polio of the spine, and the Avner children are marked as targets by the Israeli's who do not appreciate the duty of Avner Less's obligation to interrogate and gain a complete confession from Eichmann before he can be tried.  The months that the interrogations take prove that the Israeli's believed in justice: the facts must be proven completely before the prisoner is tried for atrocities.During the interrogation months Eichmann is shown in flashbacks to have been not only following the orders of Hitler, but being committed to the purification of the 'Aryan race'. What screenwriter Snoo Wilson and director Robert Young allow is for us to see the human weakness of Eichmann as portrayed By Kretschmann: he had mistresses, including one Austrian Jewess and a Hungarian Countess who urged him to complete the Final Solution, he coldly signed extermination orders 'because he had to follow Hitler's orders', yet he also was an apparently devoted father to his own sons.  Equal time is given to allow the audience to see the interaction between the conflicted parties of the interrogation: Avner was convinced he must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the prisoner was indeed guilty of all of the crimes fro which he was accused.  The interrogations become a battle of wills between the smarmy, oily, manipulative Eichmann and the personally distraught Avner.  At the close of the film the real Avner E. Less provides voice over regarding the hanging of Eichmann along with statistics of the Nazi atrocities that no matter how often they are quoted continue to astonish our ability to comprehend.The only artistic aspect of the film that is ultimately distracting is the director's choice to have cinematographer Michael Conner use near black and white/sepia toning for the film. Certain scenes break into real color but the tone of the film footage seems dirty - and perhaps that is the reason for the choice.  Richard Harvey adds the musical score, and there are some very fine cameo roles by  Delaine Yates, Tereza Srbova, and Judit Viktor.  But in the end  it is the performance by Thomas Kretschmann that is terrifyingly real: he deserves awards for his courage to accept this role  and for his unforgettable impersonation of a man so evil that under other actor's skills would be simply unbelievable. It is Kretschmann's extraordinary performance that brings home the terror of his film.

Sherwin,"[27, 33]","Eichmann is a well done film telling the true story of how one of the former Nazi leaders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the systematic murder of millions of Jews during World War Two, was interrogated by Captain Avner Less in Israel over an eight month period before his trial for crimes against humanity. The acting is really very good; and the lighting helped a great deal to set the mood for each scene. Although eight months are condensed into this movie, it could have been edited down just a little bit to keep it moving a bit faster; there is a heavy emphasis on brooding Avner Less (Troy Garity) and Eichmann (played brilliantly by Thomas Kretschmann) who is seemingly forever able to worm his way out of admitting he did anything to kill Jews during World War Two.The use of flashbacks works well to contrast what Eichmann claims happened during his interrogation and what he really did during the war; I liked how they did that. There are fine supporting appearances by Franka Potente as Vera Less, Avner's wife who suffers from polio of the spine; Stephen Fry as Israeli Minister Tormer and Avner Less himself does a good commentary at the very end of the film. The DVD doesn't come with any extras; but this is a rather minor concern.Overall, Eichmann keeps your interest as it flows along well despite a slight editing problem and a very heavy emphasis on Avner Less who comes across as a bit one-dimensional even though the film has a few scenes designed to show a more tender side of him.

But after reading the glowing reviews for this DVD, I couldn't help myself.Are we talking about the same ""Eichmann"", or did I happen to purchase the ""Special Crappy Edition DVD"" by mistake? I guess to suggest that the four and five star reviews came from sellers trying to unload their DVDs would sound cynical, so I'll refrain from taking that leap.To begin with, a subject as serious as the Holocaust warrants serious filmmaking. There ought to be a law against cheesy, gratuitous, straight-to-video genocide flicks.This movie is an extremely poor offering, with far too much emphasis placed on Eichmann's real-life interrogator, Capt. Avner Less, and too little on Adolf Eichmann, his crimes, or his trial. In addition to the deceptive title, the story suffers from a bad script, predictable sub-plot, and excessive sentimentality. No Oscar winning performances from the actors here either; particularly bad scenes include the ""Baroness and the baby"", the Charlie Chaplin-esque jailhouse plate swap, and the all too familiar ""Eureka!"" moment, when Less realizes he has the goods on Eichmann. I suppose the director can assume credit for all of the above. Sorry Mr. Young. And most important, many so-called facts in this bio-pic are actually fiction.This film is offensive to the intelligence of the viewer, and will satisfy neither the student nor scholar of the Holocaust.In contrast, I highly recommend HBO Films ""Conspiracy"".

Seemingly a man without any conscious.Another good movie on this subject is CONSPIRACY with Kenneth Branagh & Stanley Tucci on the Wannsee Conference where the Nazi Final Solution phase of the Holocaust was devised.This Eichmann movie is another example (he was at this conference - FYI) of how intelligent people are able to do such horrible things to others and rationalize why and live with what they have done.",5,Very Interesting View of Eichmann,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,835,"['Based', 'interviews', 'occured', 'capture', 'custody', 'Isreal', 'fact', 'based', 'movie', 'open', 'chilling', 'perpective', 'man', 'not', 'just', 'Eichmann.Loving', 'father', 'own', 'children', 'shame', 'feelings', 'sufferings', 'other', 'children', 'adults.An', 'educated', 'man', 'not', 'simpleton', 'who', 'knew', 'better', 'obviously', 'understood', 'moral', 'impplications', 'what', 'was', 'occuring', 'went', 'anyway', 'Seemingly', 'man', 'conscious.Another', 'good', 'movie', 'subject', 'CONSPIRACY', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Wannsee', 'Conference', 'where', 'Nazi', 'Final', 'Solution', 'phase', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'devised.This', 'Eichmann', 'movie', 'example', 'was', 'conference', 'FYI', 'how', 'intelligent', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'such', 'horrible', 'things', 'others', 'rationalize', 'why', 'live', 'what', 'have', 'done']",N/A

This is the story of the pre trial interviews that Eichmann (Thomas Kretschmann) gave to his Israeli interviewer after he was `kidnapped' from Argentina, and taken to Israel to stand trial for crimes against humanity and the Jewish people.It is based on the transcript of those interviews so is hard to question the veracity. There is a lot of attention to period detail, in the cars and props etc, I did wonder at an Israeli driving a VW Beetle, but that is just me.If you are interested in the real history of WW II this is a film that will interest you, however, if you wanted more of an expos&eacute; of what actually took place then this will not live up to expectations. There are some disturbing scenes which attempt to expose him for the Nazi animal he was, especially so with his Hungarian, Countess. She uses him listing the numbers of `exported' people as an aphrodisiac amongst other things. The fact that he had a Jewish mistress did not convince of his continual claim to `not be an anti Semite', merely he lusted for her.The film has some flash backs to the war, these are mostly small set pieces where the atrocities are discussed rather than being shown - although on occasion we do see actual murders and executions. This helps to undermine the prolonged denials that Eichmann was giving to his interrogator. His role gets more of a billing in this and the trials of his personal life, but this does not detract from the central theme as Eichmann struggles to find common ground with his captor.There is some German and Hebrew, but no sub titles and they are really not needed. There have been criticisms that this would have been more authentic had it been all in Hebrew and German, but sub titles do put a lot of people off (not me I hasten to add) and this is a British effort (Stephen Fry is in it!). Dealing with such an emotive subject and man it was never going to please everyone and I agree that a mention of how he escaped Europe and found succour so easily in Argentina would have been welcome. That said it is a well made and thoughtful film that attempts to tell a part of history that should never be forgotten.",4,"""It wasn't my job to be loved""",1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,2181,"['quote', 'film', 'story', 'pre', 'trial', 'interviews', 'Eichmann', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'gave', 'Israeli', 'interviewer', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Argentina', 'taken', 'Israel', 'stand', 'trial', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'Jewish', 'people.It', 'based', 'transcript', 'interviews', 'so', 'hard', 'question', 'veracity', 'lot', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'cars', 'props', 'etc', 'did', 'wonder', 'Israeli', 'driving', 'VW', 'Beetle', 'just', 'me.If', 'are', 'interested', 'real', 'history', 'WW', 'II', 'film', 'will', 'interest', 'however', 'wanted', 'more', 'expos', 'eacute', 'what', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'are', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'attempt', 'expose', 'Nazi', 'animal', 'was', 'especially', 'so', 'Hungarian', 'Countess', 'listing', 'numbers', 'exported', 'people', 'aphrodisiac', 'amongst', 'other', 'things', 'fact', 'had', 'Jewish', 'mistress', 'did', 'not', 'convince', 'continual', 'claim', 'not', 'be', 'anti', 'Semite', 'merely', 'lusted', 'her.The', 'film', 'flash', 'backs', 'war', 'are', 'mostly', 'small', 'set', 'pieces', 'where', 'atrocities', 'are', 'discussed', 'rather', 'being', 'shown', 'occasion', 'do', 'see', 'actual', 'murders', 'executions', 'undermine', 'prolonged', 'denials', 'Eichmann', 'was', 'giving', 'interrogator', 'role', 'more', 'billing', 'trials', 'personal', 'life', 'not', 'detract', 'central', 'theme', 'Eichmann', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'captor.There', 'German', 'Hebrew', 'sub', 'titles', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'criticisms', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'authentic', 'had', 'been', 'Hebrew', 'German', 'sub', 'titles', 'do', 'put', 'lot', 'people', 'not', 'hasten', 'add', 'British', 'effort', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Dealing', 'emotive', 'subject', 'man', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'please', 'everyone', 'agree', 'mention', 'how', 'escaped', 'Europe', 'found', 'succour', 'so', 'easily', 'Argentina', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'said', 'well', 'made', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'tell', 'part', 'history', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A
1388917,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0047UJBJA,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","Being a fan of two German players Thomas Kretschmann and Franka Potente, I got interested in this Hungary-UK film ""Eichmann,"" (2007) which is based on the interrogation of Eichmann before his trial and execution. The casting is fine. The German Nazi officer is played by Thomas Kretschmann (""The Pianist""); the Israeli interrogator Captain Avner Less (whose real-life voice can be heard at the end credits) is played by Troy Garity; his wife Vera Less by Franka Potente; and Minister Tormer by Stephen Fry. As to the film itself, however, it was a huge disappointment.Those who are looking for something like a detailed bio-pic may skip ""Eichmann."" The film will not tell you much. Also, as a drama - fictionalized or not -""Eichmann"" is simply dull. A considerable portion of the film's running time is spent on the family of the police captain, who has to get a confession out of him. The subject matter could have been interesting with a better screenplay, but with a superficial treatment from a veteran director Robert Young, the film's theme, whatever it is, is half-baked at best. No insightful observations into the psyches of the family members supporting the police detective doing this difficult work. No intense interaction between the interrogator and the interrogated.
