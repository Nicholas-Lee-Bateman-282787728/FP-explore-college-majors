Based on the reviewers and cast I decided to get this selection.I am glad because I found this performance outstanding. Andr&eacute;a Chenier played byPavarotti is always a guaranty that it is going to be wonderfulI was not disappointed because he was a very good singer and one of the best tenors in the world in all times. Maria Guleghina does her role very well opposite to this outstanding singer and Carlo Gerald played by Juan Pons was very well done.I liked the music very much and I only was familiar with some areas. I also realized that the story is good, showing the cruelty of that society knowing that some elements were actual facts for instance the way Andrea Chenier was killed for his ideas, as well as that other historical situations were changed to create a romantic scene for the opera plot.I was surprised by the quality of the film and the sound because it was done before the HD technique.The direction by James Levine as usual was great.",5,An outstanding cast.,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,997,"['was', 'interest', 'have', 'opera', 'Based', 'reviewers', 'cast', 'decided', 'get', 'selection.I', 'am', 'glad', 'found', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Chenier', 'played', 'byPavarotti', 'always', 'guaranty', 'going', 'be', 'wonderfulI', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'one', 'best', 'tenors', 'world', 'times', 'Maria', 'Guleghina', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'opposite', 'outstanding', 'singer', 'Carlo', 'Gerald', 'played', 'Juan', 'Pons', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.I', 'liked', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'was', 'familiar', 'areas', 'also', 'realized', 'story', 'good', 'showing', 'cruelty', 'society', 'knowing', 'elements', 'were', 'actual', 'facts', 'instance', 'way', 'Andrea', 'Chenier', 'was', 'killed', 'ideas', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'historical', 'situations', 'were', 'changed', 'create', 'romantic', 'scene', 'opera', 'plot.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'quality', 'film', 'sound', 'was', 'done', 'HD', 'technique.The', 'direction', 'James', 'Levine', 'usual', 'was', 'great']",Giordano: Andrea Chénier

The singing is superb throughout, but Pavarotti's performance in the title role is in itself worth the price of the whole DVD.

The first question that came to my mind was ""Why is this not performed more often?"".  The second one was ""Which DVD should I get?"".  I quickly settled on this new release from a 1996 performance and must say that I have just about worn it out!  Everything about it is top notch.  Of course, the main attraction was Pavarotti; but I have also now discovered Juan Pons and Maria Guleghina, neither of whom I had ever heard of (and WOW!).  Do yourself a huge favor and add this to your collection ASAP!",5,Bravissimo!,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,648,"['seeing', 'final', 'duet', 'performed', 'Bocelli', 'Martinez', 'PBS', 'recently', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'opera', 'other', 'having', 'heard', 'first', 'question', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'Why', 'not', 'performed', 'more', 'often', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'Which', 'DVD', 'should', 'get', 'quickly', 'settled', 'new', 'release', '1996', 'performance', 'must', 'say', 'have', 'just', 'worn', 'out', 'Everything', 'top', 'notch', 'course', 'main', 'attraction', 'was', 'Pavarotti', 'have', 'also', 'now', 'discovered', 'Juan', 'Pons', 'Maria', 'Guleghina', 'neither', 'whom', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'WOW', 'Do', 'huge', 'favor', 'add', 'collection', 'ASAP']",Giordano: Andrea Chénier

At that time, Pavarotti was 62 years old and definitely a bit past his prime. However, by just being Pavarotti, he still makes it all totally worthwhile. Besides, he is more than ably supported by both Maria Guleghina and Juan Pons, not to mention the superb accompaniment by a still young James Levine at his best.""Andrea Chenier"" happens to be one of my favorite operas and I have both the Jose Carreras and the Jose Cura DVDs each of which has its own merits. But, at least to this reviewer, taken as a whole presentation, this particular ""Andrea Chenier"" with an Italian title hero - and the Italian being Luciano Pavarotti - outshines them all.Steffi B.
