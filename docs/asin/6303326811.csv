Now he is divorced and out of a job. He gets a job opportunity to use his skills to teach or bring a hand full of marginal soldiers up to military material. The soldiers of course are from all walks of life and bring with them different backgrounds and emotional luggage. He must learn how to do help each one accomplish the goal. He settles on Shakespeare as the learning tool as he is familiar with the material.Will he succeed?Does he learn anything in the process?What effect does this have on the instructors he works with?Do we come away with anything of worth?There are many teaching ""the unruly"" movies out there and there will be many more. This one has a little more depth in also teaching the teacher. It is not some great unknown insight but a gradual awareness that benefits all involved.

369289,A3DCKK2C60Z2K7,6303326811,Bill Lincicome,"[18, 19]","which really isn't a bad thing at all.  &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; does a pretty good job of depicting military basic training with a few  laugh-out-loud scenes along the way -- especially the  &quot;sniff-n-git&quot; approach to chow time (what great memories!).  I  especially liked Gregory Hines' character (Drill Sergeant Cass) emphasizing  the daunting task of transforming civilians into soldiers capable of saving  lives in combat.  Sergeant Cass and Bill Rago may come from entirely  different perspectives, but, like one of the primary goals of military  basic training, the two men realize they're on the same team and gradually  develop a respect for each other's duty.I also liked the scene where  Private Benitez, who does a dead-on Jake LaMotta impression throughout the  movie, presents a moving soliloquy from Henry V during his company's  bivouac (&quot;on St. Crispin's Day&quot;).  Mark Wahlberg (who I suppose  graduated basic training and moved on to &quot;Three Kings&quot;!), the  lovely Stacey Dash (who isn't given enough to do) and the wonderfully  restrained Richard T. Jones (Private Jackson Leroy) round out a solid cast.  A few minor things prevent this from being a 5-star movie (I actually give  it 4 1/2 stars):1)  I felt sorry for the soldier (Private Hobbs) who was  busted for his past history of selling drugs -- but hey, he didn't seem too  sorry about it when he got caught, did he?  At least he was trying to  better himself in the slammer... 2)  The &quot;white boys ain't got no  rhythm&quot; crack is pretty played out (even if it is true). 3)  I was  disappointed not to find &quot;United&quot;, the track played during the  closing credits, on the soundtrack.  Great song!Last item -- they way  the movie ended, it sort of left the door open for a follow-up of some  sort.  Was there a TV series made of this (I've been overseas for a LONG  time!)

369295,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6303326811,D. Litton,"[4, 13]","The thing that makes &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; a less-than-worthy film is its overly long running time. Throughout the movie, one gets the notion that there is a lot of good underlying material that is just bursting to break free, but never gets a chance to. The laughs are there, but there don't seem to be nearly enough of them to keep it a comedy. By the movie's end, it seems more like a weird combination of morals and laughs mixed into an army storyline whose characters never fully express the message of the film.Bill Rego is a highly successful advertising businessman whose recent divorce has left him broke, down on his luck, and late to work everyday. After being fired from his job, he is forced to take many trips to the unemployment office, where his conversations with the clerk, while aiming for comedy, seem to be forced and unenjoyable for both actors. By this point in the movie, I was trying so hard to try and find something funny to laugh at, and maybe that's the movie's problem: we are forced to look for the laughs instead of having them look for us.His job hunt takes him to an army base, where he is given the assignment of teaching a group of trainees who have apparently scoring big in the underachievment category. I really wish that the movie would have elaborated more on exactly why they were in that position in the first place. They are all seen in the fields doing their things with their guns and running in place, so why does the chief of headquarters see it fit to place them in the classroom with a man who has no experience as a teacher? The students are just as blind ot the answer as we are.Rego has no idea what to teach them, or how to react to them. Each of the students comes from a different area of the country, each being a stereotype of a different social circle in the areas they lived in. When they all stand up and deliver a speech about their background, this seems to be a sign that the movie is going to get better, but don't count on it. From here on out, Rego preaches the verses of Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; to them, supposedly insighting them with lyrical phrases and expanding their minds. And how exactly is this supposed to help them when they're out on the fields, practicing the art of war?The whole &quot;Hamlet&quot; angle is just one of the many contrivances of the movie's plot, which seems to jump from comedy to drama within minute-long periods. It goes through an identity crisis, so to speak, of trying to decide which one it wants to be, and in the end ends up being neither. There are some genuine laughs that will tickle your fancy, and Danny Devito certainly does a goos job in trying to bring the story a sense of lightheartedness, but this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, and he is unable to keep it from flopping.It's a slight surprise to see that the director of this film is Penny Marshall, whose past films such as &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and &quot;Big&quot; each contained a healthy balance of drama and comedy. Here, she seems to want to give it to us in increments, not wanting us to forget that this is not just a comedy, but a drama as well, and vice versa. It's as if she's forcing this fact down our throats through the movie, and this makes it almost painstaking to watch.While there are some laughs, &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; falls into the category of films that have a lot going for it, but never make it off the ground. There are too many nonessential elements within the film that keep it from obtaining a good combination of the ones we really want to see, and it seems to drag on longer than it needs to.",3,Not what it appears to be.,984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,3649,"['thing', 'quot', 'Renaissance', 'Man', 'quot', 'less-than-worthy', 'film', 'overly', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'one', 'notion', 'lot', 'good', 'underlying', 'material', 'just', 'bursting', 'break', 'free', 'never', 'chance', 'laughs', 'are', 'there', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'nearly', 'enough', 'keep', 'comedy', 'movie', 'end', 'more', 'weird', 'combination', 'morals', 'mixed', 'army', 'storyline', 'characters', 'never', 'fully', 'express', 'message', 'film.Bill', 'Rego', 'highly', 'successful', 'advertising', 'businessman', 'recent', 'divorce', 'left', 'broke', 'down', 'luck', 'late', 'work', 'everyday', 'being', 'fired', 'job', 'forced', 'take', 'many', 'trips', 'unemployment', 'office', 'where', 'conversations', 'clerk', 'aiming', 'comedy', 'seem', 'be', 'forced', 'unenjoyable', 'actors', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'funny', 'laugh', 'maybe', 'movie', 'problem', 'are', 'forced', 'look', 'laughs', 'instead', 'having', 'look', 'us.His', 'job', 'hunt', 'army', 'base', 'where', 'given', 'assignment', 'teaching', 'group', 'trainees', 'who', 'have', 'apparently', 'scoring', 'big', 'underachievment', 'category', 'really', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'elaborated', 'more', 'exactly', 'why', 'were', 'position', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'seen', 'fields', 'doing', 'things', 'guns', 'running', 'place', 'so', 'why', 'chief', 'headquarters', 'see', 'fit', 'place', 'classroom', 'man', 'who', 'experience', 'teacher', 'students', 'are', 'just', 'blind', 'answer', 'are.Rego', 'idea', 'what', 'teach', 'how', 'react', 'students', 'different', 'area', 'country', 'being', 'stereotype', 'different', 'social', 'circle', 'areas', 'lived', 'When', 'stand', 'up', 'deliver', 'speech', 'background', 'be', 'sign', 'movie', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'here', 'out', 'Rego', 'verses', 'Shakespeare', 'quot', 'Hamlet', 'quot', 'supposedly', 'insighting', 'lyrical', 'phrases', 'expanding', 'minds', 'how', 'exactly', 'supposed', 'help', 'when', ""'re"", 'out', 'fields', 'practicing', 'art', 'war', 'whole', 'quot', 'Hamlet', 'quot', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'contrivances', 'movie', 'plot', 'jump', 'comedy', 'drama', 'minute-long', 'periods', 'identity', 'crisis', 'so', 'speak', 'trying', 'decide', 'one', 'be', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'neither', 'are', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'will', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'certainly', 'goos', 'job', 'trying', 'bring', 'story', 'sense', 'lightheartedness', 'one', 'bad', 'movies', 'good', 'actors', 'unable', 'keep', 'flopping.It', 'slight', 'surprise', 'see', 'director', 'film', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'past', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'quot', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'contained', 'healthy', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Here', 'want', 'give', 'increments', 'not', 'wanting', 'forget', 'not', 'just', 'comedy', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'vice', 'versa', 'forcing', 'fact', 'down', 'throats', 'movie', 'almost', 'painstaking', 'watch.While', 'are', 'laughs', 'quot', 'Renaissance', 'Man', 'quot', 'category', 'films', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'never', 'make', 'off', 'ground', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'nonessential', 'elements', 'film', 'keep', 'obtaining', 'good', 'combination', 'ones', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'drag', 'longer']",Renaissance Man VHS

One where I watch it on faith that it will be a good movie, and then there's the other scenario where it strikes a chord in my heart, and makes me wake up and listen. The day I saw this movie my heart and faith were in the toilet. I remember feeling sorry for myself, and yet at the same time I remember walking through EPCOT flipping the bird at everyone as I wanted to pick a fight because I was feeling that downhearted. The characters of this movie were all out of faith too:Bill Rago: Divorced ad artist who lost the biggest account, and his job in one day; is regulated to take a job as a teacher in guess where? The U.S. Army.Jackson Leroy: Former college football superstar who after a serious injury to his knee had to give up his dream, and make a living for his wife, and soon to be child. Fortunately, he had a good wife to keep him going as his education was limited.Tommy Lee Haywood: His bubble was burst when the paper mill where he worked was shut down, and with no real college education he was stuck in a trailer.Miranda Myers : Had a mother who more or less needed a man, and it didn't matter to her whether she needed a daughter, or not.Melvin Melvin: This is a real name. Tendency to fall asleep as he was the victim of physical abuse growing up.Brian Davis: Didn't have a father growing up, and that made him feel incomplete as he knew his father was over in Veitnam, but didn't know all the details of how he died.Donald Benetiz: Wisecracking New Yorker who just didn't seem to have any ambition...especially after the tragic death of his sister.Jamal Montgomery: Thoroughly undisciplined and arrogant as it seems as though his parents just turned him over to the wolves.Roosevelt(Nathanial)Hobbs: Quiet unassuming guy, and that's the way he wanted it kept as he was looking for salvation from his past.Rago is in charge of trying to help all these recruits survive boot camp as they are physically, mentally, and emotionally challenged. This is actually based on a true story where Rago the teacher gets them to succeed academically, and physically, and emotionally by having them read the Shakesphere play ""Hamlet"".

When we study the Renaissance in World History, our text makes reference to Leon Battista Alberti, the scholar and architect who, from a standing start and with his feet together, could leap over a man's head.  The DeVito character, in his efforts to get his students interested in Shakespeare, makes reference to Alberti in one scene in the movie, so I couldn't resist showing that clip in my class.  Then, since I taught the same students (high school freshmen) in English, I also showed all the clips related to the teaching of *Hamlet*.  I've been patiently waiting for the DVD to come out so I won't have to do the slow ""fast forwarding"" and can just leap to the clips I want.

Renaissance Man directed by Penny Marshell this is about the only movie that she has directed that  I like starring Danny DeVito as Bill Rago James Remar as Captain Tom Murdoch Gregory Hines as Sargent Cass Stacy Dash as Miranda Myers Richard T Jones as Jackson Leroy & Mark Wahlberg as Tommy Lee Haywood. Plot is Bill Rago is fired from his job & really down on his luck the unemployment office finds him work at a Military Base to teach new recruits. This is where we meet Tommy Lee Haywood, Miranda Myers, Jackson Leroy, Hobbs & Melivin. Thes guys argue & it's funny some of there interaction. Rago tells them to write a paper on why they joined The Army it's a really great scene why they want to serve they want to be a part of something greater than they could ever imagine. Rago teaches the recruits Shakespeare's Hamlet this movie got me interested in the works of William Shakespeare. When Melivin reads his lines off the paper Danny DeVito's reaction is funny I enjoy The ""Go Hamlet!"" Rap. 1 scene a guy that Rago likes he has Captain Murdoch look into his record cause he thinks he should be elevated but it's a real heartbreaking scene it turns out he was a drug dealer & he was hiding out from Law Enforcment his real name is Nathaniel Hobbs. While I'm not a fan of Mark Wahlberg's rap career I love the song Life In The Streets. Rago tells the recruits what he did only cause he wanted to see Hobbs succeed he say ""The choices we make dictate the life we lead."" I could put more about how awesome this movie is & I do know this was a bad summery of the plot. I thought that this was the last great performance by Danny DeVito James Remar did a good job it really depends on the role cause he wasn't the best choice as Raiden in the 2nd MK movie. Mark Wahlberg did a good job for 1st time role as did everyone else & this was a comedy that really knew it's audience & was funny unlike 2 certain comedies that recently reviewed.

369308,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303326811,JRP,"[1, 1]","Hello out there & welcome to the 1st 20 years ago review for the month of June & I am kicking it off with a very underrated movie Renaissance Man. This right here is what I would call a perfect movie I rarely & I mean rarely do I ever give a movie a 10 out of 10 rarely do I give a movie that I don't like anything under a 1. But way back when I saw this movie when I was 15 I liked I just love this movie. I have it only on VHS I still watch VHS tapes from time to time & this movie is hard to find in stores I had to get it from a resale shop I would like a Special Edition cause this movie while it tanked in theaters it did get an audience & a cult following. Now the movie did bad cause it was released in the summer of 1994 & you had so many other movies hurt it like a week later Speed was released. It only made $24 million on on a $40 million budget. It was directed by Penny Marshall this has been the only movie of hers that she has directed that I have seen she has done a lot of TV work as well as acting. The movie stars Danny DeVito as Bill Rago, Gregory Hines as Sergeant Cass, James Remar as Captain Murdoch, Mark Wahlberg as Tommy Lee Heywood, Peter Simmons as Brian Davis, Lillo Brancato Jr as Donnie Benitez, Stacey Dash as Miranda Myers, Richard T Jones as Corporal Jackson Leroy, Khalil Kain as Roosevelt Hobbs, KIadeem Hardison as Jamaal Montgomery, & Gregory Sporleder as Melvin Melvin, The story is about a man named Bill Rago has lost his job a an Advertising Executive after being late & he was stuck in traffic & tried to give presentation over a Cell Phone & he was cussing out other drivers & the people in the board room heard it. He goes to seek employment. Bill is also divorced & has a Daughter. Now Bill's Daughter Emily wants to go with her Class to Mexico on an Astrology Trip but he can't afford it he even tells her to grow up. Bill gets work as a Teacher on a Military Base cause he got his Master's Degree & that's the only thing he can take. So you have a very likable group of Students that are all rookies in The Military except for 1. These people are from all over the country. They have their own personalities & reasons for joining The Army. You're also introduced to Captain Tom Murdoch who shows Bill around. Tommy Lee Heywood who worked in a Paper Mill lived in a Trailer Park when The Mill closed he wanted to see the world beyond The Trailer Park. Donnie Beritez joined cause his Little Sister was killed in a gang shooting so he & he used to be in gang so he left The Bronx to join The Army. Jackson Leroy who unlike the others has a higher rank of Corporal he used to be an All Star Football Player but an injury ended that since he was only told to play sports his whole life his only choice was to join The Army. Miranda Myers who was the only woman in the group joined cause her Mother ran off with a Man & on a Bus Ride she saw sign that said Be All You Can Be. So she wants to see if she can be all she can be. You have Roosevelt Hobbs who is the smartest guy in the group & Jamaal Montgomery who jokes around & does a lot of wisecracks on everyone. As well as Melvin Melvin who sleeps through everything & joined more than likely to escape the abuse from his Step Dad. The 1st time Class doesn't go well Jamaal is getting under everybody's skin. Melvin's asleep. Benitez is making fun of Brian Davis cause he is proud of his Father who fought & died in The Vietnam War. Jamaal is making fun of Heywood cause he's a Southerner. Jamaal talks bad about Myers Mom Corporal Leroy Jackson is trying to be the voice of reason. Mr Rago tells Jamaal that he is suceeding in being an a * * hole. Plus you have the group use the term double D Which I have used on some wisenheimer's on here. Bill has a hard time adjusting to Military life like when they're doing training in the middle of the night. Now in their class they're required to read something they all got magazine's Benitez did the best he got an Archie Comic this was funny. Bill gets the group interested in Hamlet by Shakespeare. Jamaal asks if that's about a little bitty pig. When he tells them what it's about & 1 of the subjects it deals with Jamaal has wisecrack comment for Heywood. ou have Bill teach this group. The Drill Sergeant tells Bill that what he's teaching them won't help them in the battlefield. You have some good moments in The Mess Hall The Drill Sergeant is telling the troops to eat. You have Myers tell this girl off who is talking trash how she could whoop all these people & Myers tells her that she is a swinger from the ugly tree. There's this part that's funny where Benitez has his head turned & he's making fun of Davis & all the people at the table put food on Benitez's tray & he's like where did all this food come from & The Drill Sergeant yells ""EAT EAT!"" There's a scene at a bar where Bill is talking to Captain Murdoch. Murdoch pretty much tells the future of education in this scene. When the troops get letters from home Melvin finds out his Step Dad threw 1 of his brothers stairs. You have a scene where Davis loses a bracelet that was his Father's & Benitez actually helps him find it & they're late for training The Drill Sergeant is mad he tells them he wants them to show up for training 9 minutes early & Mr Rago is passing by & tells them show up to his class 9 minutes late. The Drill Sergeant gets mad at Rago. Rago asks The Drill Sergeant if he was potty trained at gun point it's a funny scene however Bill gets in trouble & is warned. The next day he is late for class he at a job interview which upsets the class cause they felt Mr Rago doesn't have time for them so they walk out of the classroom. He doesn't want to lose them so he goes to talk to them but goes through an obstacle course to he actually goes through it & the group gives him another shot meanwhile Bill sells some stuff off to buy a ticket for his Daughter & a new Telescope. You have 1 of my favorite scenes ""The Go Hamlet"" rap. When Rago is talking to Corporal Leroy he tells Rago that he has a Son on the way & he won't have him anywhere near sports. Rago takes an interest in this guy named Roosevelt Hobbs who is smart & like nice guy Bill wonders what a guy like him is doing in The Army. He has Captain Murdoch look into his background to see if they can't place him in an important position/ This scene is sad always have found it sad where you find out Hobbs was on the run from the law for drug charges & his real name is Nathaniel Hobbs not Roosevelt Hobbs The Drill Sergeant even said he had the stuff to make it. The song ""Life In The Streets"" by Marky Mark was great. The next day Rago has to tells the class he had them check into Hobbs's background which upsets Myers cause she had a thing for Hobbs. He tells them he did it cause he only wanted to see him go far in life & he didn't know about his trouble with the law. Rago, The Drill Sergeant & Murdoch put in the good word for him. Hobbs writes from Prison he tells him the word they put in for him might get him an early release. He was also the 1st inmate in 16 years to check out Shakespeare Books. If he gets out early he wrote that he might go to College if they have teachers like Rago then he would surely go. Another scene that fun is when Rago takes the group to Canada to go see The Play King Henry The V. When the guy at the border asks where they're from the troops all yell ""The USA!"" Rago also does this favor for Davis he wants to find out about Davis's Father he meets this Woman in The Records Office named Marie she tells him no but they end up taking a liking to each other & Marie's Secretary Shana gives Bill the documents on Davis's Father in Vietnam. Shana is Corporal Leroy's Wife. Bill goes to give Davis the documents but they're out in the rain training. The Drill Sergeant wants 1 of the soldiers to recite some Shakespeare Benitiez does cause he bought the book King Henry The V while they were out. It moves the Drill Sergeant & of course Bill is proud of him. Bill is going to hold a final exam which the group has to pass to graduate but he is told they don't have to take it so it's only optional but they like, respect & feel they owe it to Mr Rago so they take it & pass then you get to The Graduation Davis's Father is posthumously given The Silver Star for his service in Vietnam after The Students Graduate Bill stays on as a teacher. That's pretty much the movie. This movie is a forgotten classic I know this retrospective doesn't make it sound like it. I would like this to get a Special Edition or even a Blu Ray. The only way to see this other than getting it online is watching a stream online. This movie has likable characters the cast all works well together. Great moments as well as funny moments. Like I said I have never seen any of Penny Marshall's other movies but she should be proud that she directed this movie. Danny DeVito did a great job. I don't need to go into what kid acting the rest of the cast did as they all did a good job.

The ridged boot camp in the movie was cool and I liked Devito's character, he introduces William Shakespeare to the army men and woman in the movie. It talks about war and how this group of misfits come together to achieve a common goal, to trust each other, especially in a time of war and to learn how to work hard for what you want and not to be handed any for free.
