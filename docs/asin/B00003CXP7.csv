531267,A395K1LG8IODD9,B00003CXP7,,"[4, 6]","This film can be ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on how you choose to approach it.  If you approach it from the standpoint of ""I want to be entertained for an hour and a half, and I don't want to think much"", this film will likely be enjoyable for you.  This was how I approached it, and it *was* entertaining.  However, afterwards, I started replaying certain aspects of the film as they relate to the ending, and you can't help but feel a little lied to by the writers and director in order to make the final twist work.  Likewise, the main character, Hansen, is just way too unbelievable in terms of a politician.  She's portrayed as a saint by the end, and you can't help but think how impossible her career would be for any politician so attached to their ideals.Lastly, we're told that she is a Republican-turned-Democrat.  She says she turned Democrat because the Republican Party moved too far from her ideals.  Well, at about the 2/3 mark in the film, she rattles off her ideals and you can't help but wonder 'when in the US timeline could she have ever possibly been a Republican'.  They tried to backfill a round hole with a square peg, and it won't work on anyone who remotely follows party politics.The one saving grace for me was Jeff Bridges as President Jackson Evans.  He nails the part and his character is entertaining for every moment he's on screen.I can't really recommend this film, but if you do decide to see it, don't give it too much thought.  It's more enjoyable that way.",3,"Problematic, but Entertaining",1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,1494,"['film', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'how', 'choose', 'approach', 'approach', 'standpoint', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'much', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'approached', '*was*', 'entertaining', 'However', 'afterwards', 'started', 'replaying', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'relate', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'lied', 'writers', 'director', 'order', 'make', 'final', 'twist', 'work', 'Likewise', 'main', 'character', 'Hansen', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'terms', 'politician', 'portrayed', 'saint', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'impossible', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'politician', 'so', 'attached', 'ideals.Lastly', ""'re"", 'told', 'Republican-turned-Democrat', 'turned', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Party', 'moved', 'too', 'far', 'ideals', 'Well', '2/3', 'mark', 'film', 'ideals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', ""'when"", 'US', 'timeline', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'possibly', 'been', 'Republican', 'tried', 'backfill', 'round', 'hole', 'square', 'peg', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'anyone', 'who', 'remotely', 'party', 'politics.The', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'President', 'Jackson', 'Evans', 'part', 'character', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'screen.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'decide', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'thought', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'way']",N/A
531268,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00003CXP7,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I have spilled much ink this year, in the wake of Jeff Bridges' Oscar victory in the role of broken-down country singer-songwriter, Bad Blake, in the film Crazy Hearts , arguing that he had been preparing for that role since he first broke out as the future  good ol' boy, Duane Jackson, in The Last Picture Show. I will argue here that his persona as the President in this film, The Contender, follows that same career path. Bridges plays the up front and in your face,  wise, witty, populist-oriented, but also politically savvy good ol' boy president to a tee, from his bowling in the White House basement to his plebeian culinary tastes. I will rest my case on those scenes.What I will not rest my case on is the plot; liberal, feminist-friendly, democracy-friendly, and politically feel good that it turns out to be. Apparently, for some undisclosed reason, the then sitting Vice President dies leaving under the then (and now, as well) current constitutional amendment the need for the president to appoint a successor (and for Congress to approve of that appointment in some form). Of course, Bridges, as a second and final term president, has more candidates that he can shake a stick at, including one prominent recently heroic state governor. He, eventually, settles on an Ohio (naturally, the Midwest for balance and stability) woman Senator. Seems that good ol' boy Bridges, carrying a secret progressive streak, like every president before him, starts to worry about his legacy and having appointed the first woman Vice President is where he will hang his hat.That is the easy part. What transpires though is said (if you can believe this about anyone from Ohio) woman Senator has an allegedly shady sexual past, among other personal problems that pile up as the film progresses. Moreover, various Congressmen, including the chairman of the committee that will give its advice on the appointment, are gunning for said Senator for his own reasons. The bulk of the remainder of the film centers of the political fight to save the president's appointment, led by the President himself and his trusty advisors (using all the powers at their disposal).Hold on a minute, I can enjoy a political thriller just as well as the next guy but this whole thing has the quality of a science-fiction thriller. What were those screenwriters in the year 1999 on anyway? Why? Simple, anyone who has even glanced at a newspaper headline over the last twenty or so years (or checked out the Internet, for that matter) KNOWS that no sitting president, second term or not, legacy or not, would do anything but make the quickest withdrawal of the appointee in recorded history (or be pushed out the back door by his party's leaders, they still have to make a living remember) the minute the facts of the Senator's case were known. Even old stand up Bridges. So if you want to see Bad Blake in a science fiction thriller this is for you. Oh, as almost always is the case, Bridges is just fine here.",3,Bad Blake As President,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2987,"['have', 'spilled', 'much', 'ink', 'year', 'wake', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Oscar', 'victory', 'role', 'broken-down', 'country', 'singer-songwriter', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'film', 'Crazy', 'Hearts', 'arguing', 'had', 'been', 'preparing', 'role', 'first', 'broke', 'out', 'future', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Duane', 'Jackson', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'will', 'argue', 'here', 'persona', 'President', 'film', 'Contender', 'same', 'career', 'path', 'Bridges', 'up', 'front', 'face', 'wise', 'witty', 'populist-oriented', 'also', 'politically', 'savvy', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'president', 'tee', 'bowling', 'White', 'House', 'basement', 'plebeian', 'culinary', 'tastes', 'will', 'rest', 'case', 'scenes.What', 'will', 'not', 'rest', 'case', 'plot', 'liberal', 'feminist-friendly', 'democracy-friendly', 'politically', 'feel', 'good', 'out', 'be', 'Apparently', 'undisclosed', 'reason', 'then', 'sitting', 'Vice', 'President', 'leaving', 'then', 'now', 'well', 'current', 'constitutional', 'amendment', 'need', 'president', 'appoint', 'successor', 'Congress', 'approve', 'appointment', 'form', 'course', 'Bridges', 'second', 'final', 'term', 'president', 'more', 'candidates', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'including', 'one', 'prominent', 'recently', 'heroic', 'state', 'governor', 'eventually', 'settles', 'Ohio', 'naturally', 'Midwest', 'balance', 'stability', 'woman', 'Senator', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Bridges', 'carrying', 'secret', 'progressive', 'streak', 'president', 'worry', 'legacy', 'having', 'appointed', 'first', 'woman', 'Vice', 'President', 'where', 'will', 'hang', 'hat.That', 'easy', 'part', 'What', 'though', 'said', 'can', 'believe', 'anyone', 'Ohio', 'woman', 'Senator', 'allegedly', 'shady', 'sexual', 'past', 'other', 'personal', 'problems', 'pile', 'up', 'film', 'Moreover', 'various', 'Congressmen', 'including', 'chairman', 'committee', 'will', 'give', 'advice', 'appointment', 'are', 'gunning', 'said', 'Senator', 'own', 'reasons', 'bulk', 'remainder', 'film', 'centers', 'political', 'fight', 'save', 'president', 'appointment', 'led', 'President', 'trusty', 'advisors', 'using', 'powers', 'disposal', '.Hold', 'minute', 'can', 'enjoy', 'political', 'thriller', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'guy', 'whole', 'thing', 'quality', 'science-fiction', 'thriller', 'What', 'were', 'screenwriters', 'year', '1999', 'anyway', 'Why', 'Simple', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'glanced', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'last', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'checked', 'out', 'Internet', 'matter', 'KNOWS', 'sitting', 'president', 'second', 'term', 'not', 'legacy', 'not', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'quickest', 'withdrawal', 'appointee', 'recorded', 'history', 'be', 'pushed', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'party', 'leaders', 'still', 'have', 'make', 'living', 'remember', 'minute', 'facts', 'Senator', 'case', 'were', 'known', 'Even', 'old', 'stand', 'up', 'Bridges', 'So', 'want', 'see', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'Oh', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'Bridges', 'just', 'fine', 'here']",N/A
531269,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00003CXP7,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 11]","&quot;The Contender&quot; is a riveting and unfortunately all-too-accurate portrayal of the price politicians of principle may have to pay to preserve those principles in today's Washington, D.C.A lame-duck Democratic President (Jeff Bridges) has just nominated dyed-in-the wool liberal Laine Hansen (Joan Allen) to take the place of a recently-deceased Vice President. Approval of Laine's nomination becomes incredibly politicized, mostly along party lines, and the chief spoiler for the Republicans is the party elder played by Gary Oldman.  He promises a fair fight, but quickly word leaks out that someone who looks a lot like a young version of Laine appears in an amateur film of a frat-boy-gone-wild sex orgy from the early 1970s.  Laine steadfastly maintains the following:  (1) her private life is none of anyone's business; and (2) if she were a man, none of this would even be worth asking.  And she answers no questions.Nonetheless, the inevitable congressional inquiry turns into a witch hunt with Oldman's character leading the charge.  If you thought the Watergate hearings were nasty, well, imagine the tricks Hollywood can turn with such a juicy topic.  Even under oath, Laine continues to answer no questions about her sex life.Excellent writing and acting all the way.  There is also a twisty subplot woven in that I can't even hint at without giving it away. I enjoyed Jeff Bridges as the glad-handing, back-slapping, people-oriented second-term President (Gee, I wonder who they were thinking of?).  Christian Slater was quite believable as a rookie Representative from Delaware who isn't quite sure whether he needs to lend a piece of himself to the cause or sell himself out completely.  Joan Allen as the party under seige was superb.  I was astounded by the versatility and nuance of Gary Oldman's performance.  Any more evil and he would have made the entire United States political establishment seem so corrupt that our best hope would be to surrender to Canada.  Any less evil and he would have come out looking like a man of principle with whom one had better &quot;agree to disagree.&quot;  He walked that tightrope with world-class finesse.Now, you probably know that this is not a Capra-esque movie.  If you want a Capra-esque movie, see &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; or anything with the word &quot;feelgood&quot; attached.  I won't even hint at the ending except to say it will raise emotions.  And I believe this is quite a fine movie indeed, even though I've been known to vote against Democrats from time to time.",4,"It takes guts to see this movie, and all the more to live it",991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,2549,"['quot', 'Contender', 'quot', 'riveting', 'unfortunately', 'all-too-accurate', 'portrayal', 'price', 'politicians', 'principle', 'may', 'have', 'pay', 'preserve', 'principles', 'today', 'Washington', 'D.C.A', 'lame-duck', 'Democratic', 'President', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'just', 'nominated', 'dyed-in-the', 'wool', 'liberal', 'Laine', 'Hansen', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'take', 'place', 'recently-deceased', 'Vice', 'President', 'Approval', 'Laine', 'nomination', 'incredibly', 'politicized', 'mostly', 'party', 'lines', 'chief', 'spoiler', 'Republicans', 'party', 'elder', 'played', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'fair', 'fight', 'quickly', 'word', 'out', 'someone', 'who', 'lot', 'young', 'version', 'Laine', 'amateur', 'film', 'frat-boy-gone-wild', 'sex', 'orgy', 'early', '1970s', 'Laine', 'steadfastly', 'following', '1', 'private', 'life', 'none', 'anyone', 'business', '2', 'were', 'man', 'none', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'worth', 'asking', 'questions.Nonetheless', 'inevitable', 'congressional', 'inquiry', 'witch', 'hunt', 'Oldman', 'character', 'leading', 'charge', 'thought', 'Watergate', 'hearings', 'were', 'nasty', 'well', 'imagine', 'tricks', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'turn', 'juicy', 'topic', 'Even', 'oath', 'Laine', 'answer', 'questions', 'sex', 'life.Excellent', 'writing', 'acting', 'way', 'also', 'twisty', 'subplot', 'woven', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'hint', 'giving', 'away', 'enjoyed', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'glad-handing', 'back-slapping', 'people-oriented', 'second-term', 'President', 'Gee', 'wonder', 'who', 'were', 'thinking', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'rookie', 'Representative', 'Delaware', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'lend', 'piece', 'cause', 'sell', 'out', 'completely', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'party', 'seige', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'astounded', 'versatility', 'nuance', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'performance', 'more', 'evil', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'political', 'establishment', 'seem', 'so', 'corrupt', 'best', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'surrender', 'Canada', 'Any', 'evil', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'man', 'principle', 'whom', 'one', 'had', 'better', 'quot', 'agree', 'disagree.', 'quot', 'walked', 'tightrope', 'world-class', 'finesse.Now', 'probably', 'know', 'not', 'Capra-esque', 'movie', 'want', 'Capra-esque', 'movie', 'see', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'quot', 'anything', 'word', 'quot', 'feelgood', 'quot', 'attached', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'hint', 'ending', 'say', 'will', 'raise', 'emotions', 'believe', 'quite', 'fine', 'movie', 'indeed', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'vote', 'Democrats', 'time', 'time']",N/A
531270,A2ASXLK8AN5BW6,B00003CXP7,Amanda,"[4, 5]","As a huge fan of Joan Allen, I am shocked to see the low ratings on this movie....but they are primarily (if not all) by men.  This movie is deeper than male politics (to the disappointment, obviously of the male reviewers)......this movie is about a woman in the depths of a slimy, backstabbing, good ol boys political dog-fight. I LOVE this movie and watch it every couple years. I urge all women to see it......you will get it. The review entitled ""insults my intelligence"" by Simon Lee....well, HE insults MY intelligence.  Just because it focuses on a woman, he discredits the entire theme of the movie....it's about a woman, her feelings, her life, her decisions and how she reacts under pressure.  The reviewer just doesn't get it.  As an educated female, it's one of my all time favorite movies.  It focuses on Joan Allen as a lovely lady of honesty and integrity chosen as a possible candidate to step into the vice presidential seat after his death. A scandal is created (by men of course) of her past and her subtle, eloquent handling of the situation with grace and dignity is absolutely BRILLIANT. In an attempt for the slime balls to crush her, she stands tall and firm on her conviction: that one's personal life, is personal.  It changed a part of me forever....the script is brilliant and Joan Allen pulls it off to perfection. I immediately fell in love with this movie and all it stands for.  I implore all woman to see this movie about courage, truth and vindication.  Jeff Bridges makes a great President and the supporting cast is superb. Love the ending and the overall message is well conveyed.",5,Joan Allen is superb!

531271,AOOCDN5TFZ9QP,B00003CXP7,"Amazon Customer ""benshlomo""","[22, 41]","This movie was a tremendous relief to my sense of integrity.  Under ordinary circumstances I'm a good knee-jerk liberal on just about all issues, public and private.  (I realize that I've just talked myself out of any elected office, down to and including Sewer Inspector, in the current political climate, but never mind).  Once in awhile I wonder, as we all must, if I still have the capacity to think for myself or if I simply swallow the party line.  Well, apparently I do; I am proud to say that I consider _The Contender_, a movie with a political slant that I agree with wholeheartedly, to be an intellectually dishonest piece of claptrap.So much for my rant, but let's consider this logically - and I'm sure I'm not giving anything away here because by now everyone knows how this thing ends, if they didn't before it was even made.  Joan Allen plays a liberal-minded former Republican senator who has joined the Democratic party and is under consideration as the vice-presidential nominee.  Gary Oldman wangles his way into chairmanship of the committee that is about to recommend her confirmation or not.  He declares at once that he will do anything at all to prevent her from getting the job, up to and including smearing her reputation on national television based on some sexual hijincks she allegedly got up to in college.  Now, here's the critical point; Oldman's character is willing to go that far because, as he says, he genuinely believes that her liberal agenda is a cancer, profoundly dangerous for the country, and must be stopped at all costs.I ask you to do this; pretend that you are a member of Congress with a sincere conservative point of view.  You genuinely believe that liberalism has gone too far and is damaging the life of Americans.  You go into the joint session presented at the end of this movie to see what President Jeff Bridges will say about his nominee, who has apparently become a severe political liability.  And what do you hear your president say?  He informs you that Oldman and his friends have abused their positions as senators, used tactics to destroy his nominee that they must not get away with.  So far, so good.  He tells you that those who use such tactics are destructive to the United States and its ability to govern itself, and that these men are therefore traitors.  Well, maybe.  He says that clearly their only reason for doing as they did was that they can't face the idea of a woman in high executive office.  Wait a minute.  He then tells you and your colleagues that, to demonstrate that you are not traitors of Oldman's kind, he would like you to immediately confirm his nominee as Vice President of the United States.Now, hold it right there.  You sincerely believe that this woman and those of her opinion are genuinely dangerous, and your president has just told you that if you don't confirm her you're a traitor.  The last time someone in government insisted on intellectual conformity of that kind, his name was Joseph McCarthy.The very least these moviemakers could have done was just come right out and give their conservative characters no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Like I said, I'm a liberal; I supported Bill Clinton through the Lewinsky scandal because, like the makers of this film, I didn't think it was okay for anyone to be asking about the president's sex life, or anyone else's for that matter.  I felt a certain thrill when those old pervs in Congress were hoist on their own petard.  I'm not about to put up with cheating, however, and _The Contender_ is a cheat.All the more depressing is this dishonesty because this movie is made so well.  The cast is uniformly good, sometimes excellent, the dialogue sparkles and the cinematography and editing come from the top drawer.  I mean, come on, look at who's participating - Gary Oldman is always interesting to watch, Joan Allen projects dignity with every step, Christian Slater is growing into a very fine and mature actor, and as for Jeff Bridges...well, the man is congenitally incapable of giving a bad performance and this movie maintains his record admirably.  How discouraging it is that all this talent and hard work went into the service of something so unfair.Like most people I'd prefer to think that all the sleaziness is on the other side of my position - obviously that's not so, but _The Contender_ was jarring in the shamelessness of its cheating.  Now, I'm not so removed from reality that a mere movie is going to change my politics; on the other hand, this one comes close.  My thanks to the makers of _The Contender_ for their services to myself, as I can now confirm my own ability to perceive the flaws of my co-liberals - now it's back to unabashedly liberal movies like _The American President_ for me.Benshlomo says, Real allies don't insult your intelligence.",1,The Well-Wrought Bamboozle,1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,4832,"['movie', 'was', 'tremendous', 'relief',

In what universe would someone with Laine Hanson's (Joan Allen) views ever have been a Republican?  And it is strongly implied that her father (Philip Baker Hall), a former governor, was a Republican, yet he is adamantly opposed to any expression of religion.  Then there's the part where, after the governor of Virginia (CSI's William Petersen) tries in vain to rescue a drowning woman, the president's chief of staff (Sam Elliott) says to the Va. governor when he is not tapped to be vice president, ""we don't need another Chappaquiddick.""  Uh...sorry guys, but this isn't the same situation as Chappaquiddick.The film made the salient point that politicians' personal lives have no bearing on their competency, but the filmmaker hammers the point home in such a way with his lack of subtlety and the loooooong ending that he renders his message ineffective.  And while the film claims to be feminist, it seems to take every opportunity to degrade and humiliate the Joan Allen character.  As a previous Amazon reviewer said, there's something in this film to offend everyone.

531274,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00003CXP7,Andy Orrock,"[5, 6]","Upon seeing 'Bourne Supremacy' recently, I was reminded of Joan Allen's other movies - she's fantastic in a relatively small role in the recently released 'The Notebook,' incredible as Pat Nixon (a role she was literally born to play) in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon.'  Here, in 'The Contender' she's a Geraldine Ferraro-like putative VP nominee, sans the New York accent and 'John Zaccaro problem,' while Jeff Bridges is one of Hollywood's idealized versions of Bill Clinton (see also Michael Douglas in 'The American President,' Martin Sheen in 'The West Wings,' etc., etc.).Now, four years after the movie's release, what lingers is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Rep. Sheldon Runyon and the controversy that followed.  As with any movie Oldman is in, he is - far and away - the best actor in every scene in which he appears.  Remember, Oldman was born, grew up and continues to live in London, yet he pulled off this stellar portrayal of an American archetype as if he were steeped lifelong in the U.S. legislative political swamp.  To put this into perspective, imagine Brad Pitt playing Tony Blair.Where it gets interesting is after the shooting had stopped.  Oldman claims there were scenes cut in which you see Runyon's really not an overall bad guy - he's more than one-dimensional, has nuances in his character, etc.  Well, forget nuance: In the movie as released by writer/director Rob Lurie, Runyon comes across as if he's on a monomaniacal jihad to get Bridges' President.  This is about as nuanced as a sledgehammer, frankly, given the battles Clinton was going through at the time with impeachment procedings.  The intriguing question is how much say Dreamworks proprietors David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg (big Clinton and Gore supporters) had in the released product.  I'm not sure if anything got proven either way (i.e., what Lurie planned and filmed vs. what got released), but it gives the movie a heck of a background and certainly enhances the re-viewing experience.I do like the editorial comment made on thes pages about the DVD release - ""It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD.""  Yeah, very curious indeed and a shame.  It would be a treat to see the deleted scenes with Oldman and be the judge of how his character may have been distorted in one way or another through injudicious exclusion.There is, however, one scene that I really want to take Lurie to task for (on simple technical merits) - the confrontational scene between Oldman and Bridges takes place over a dinner, and Lurie and crew has the place miked up like the old U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  I almost couldn't hear the dialogue between all the sounds of violent mastication and slurping.  You could almost put that scene on 'Animal Planet' it was so over the top.  Four years out, I can't tell you what the two characters said (not even the nature of the exchange), but I do remember being repulsed by the sound mix.",3,Oldman controversy is what sustains this film,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2961,"['seeing', ""'Bourne"", 'Supremacy', 'recently', 'was', 'reminded', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'other', 'movies', 'fantastic', 'relatively', 'small', 'role', 'recently', 'released', ""'The"", 'Notebook', 'incredible', 'Pat', 'Nixon', 'role', 'was', 'literally', 'born', 'play', 'Oliver', 'Stone', ""'Nixon"", 'Here', ""'The"", 'Contender', 'Geraldine', 'Ferraro-like', 'putative', 'VP', 'nominee', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'Zaccaro', 'problem', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'idealized', 'versions', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'see', 'also', 'Michael', 'Douglas', ""'The"", 'American', 'President', 'Martin', 'Sheen', ""'The"", 'West', 'Wings', 'etc.', 'etc', '.Now', 'four', 'years', 'movie', 'release', 'what', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'portrayal', 'Rep.', 'Sheldon', 'Runyon', 'controversy', 'followed', 'movie', 'Oldman', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'actor', 'scene', 'Remember', 'Oldman', 'was', 'born', 'grew', 'up', 'live', 'London', 'yet', 'pulled', 'off', 'stellar', 'portrayal', 'American', 'archetype', 'were', 'steeped', 'lifelong', 'U.S.', 'legislative', 'political', 'swamp', 'put', 'perspective', 'imagine', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'playing', 'Tony', 'Blair.Where', 'interesting', 'shooting', 'had', 'stopped', 'Oldman', 'were', 'scenes', 'cut', 'see', 'Runyon', 'really', 'not', 'overall', 'bad', 'guy', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'nuances', 'character', 'etc', 'Well', 'forget', 'nuance', 'movie', 'released', 'writer/director', 'Rob', 'Lurie', 'Runyon', 'monomaniacal', 'jihad', 'get', 'Bridges', 'President', 'about', 'as', 'nuanced', 'sledgehammer', 'frankly', 'given', 'battles', 'Clinton', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'impeachment', 'procedings', 'intriguing', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'say', 'Dreamworks', 'proprietors', 'David', 'Geffen', 'Jeffrey', 'Katzenberg', 'big', 'Clinton', 'Gore', 'supporters', 'had', 'released', 'product', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anything', 'got', 'proven', 'way', 'i.e.', 'what', 'Lurie', 'planned', 'filmed', 'vs.', 'what', 'got', 'released', 'movie', 'heck', 'background', 'certainly', 're-viewing', 'experience.I', 'do', 'editorial', 'comment', 'made', 'thes', 'pages', 'DVD', 'release', 'interesting', 'note', 'none', 'Oldman', 'work', 'up', 'dozen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'shown', 'DVD', 'Yeah', 'very', 'curious', 'indeed', 'shame', 'would', 'be', 'treat', 'see', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Oldman', 'be', 'judge', 'how', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'distorted', 'one', 'way', 'injudicious', 'however', 'one', 'scene', 'really', 'want', 'take', 'Lurie', 'task', 'simple', 'technical', 'merits', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'Oldman', 'Bridges', 'place', 'dinner', 'Lurie', 'crew', 'place', 'miked', 'up', 'old', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'Moscow', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'dialogue', 'sounds', 'violent', 'mastication', 'slurping', 'could', 'almost', 'put', 'scene', ""'Animal"", 'Planet', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'Four', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'two', 'characters', 'said', 'not', 'even', 'nature', 'exchange', 'do', 'remember', 'being', 'repulsed', 'sound', 'mix']",N/A

From Hathaway's innane  attempt at heroism, which immediately backfires as a ploy to gain the vice-presidency, through all the exposing takes on the pomposity, rhetoric, and posturing, of the genera, through the references to Coen brother's films, to the faux-moving speech at the finale, this film is a laugh riot.  The bonus laugh is that it seems everyone is taking it seriously: pondering, for example, such questions as whether the film was biased.  The idea that a political movie, or any movie, should be objective--suggesting a mass blurring of the distinction between entertainment and reality--is just the kind of silliness the film takes aim at.

Yoe ""Miami Dan""","[9, 17]","As a political independent I really don't have much of a problem believing that the Republicans in Congress are the uncaring, sneaky bunch of politicians they are portrayed as in this film.  What I don't buy at all, though, is the Democrats in Congress being the truthful, caring, altruistic bunch they're portrayed as here.  For me, this film simply confirms the fact that the Hollywood elites are no more than a wing of the Democrat Party when it comes to political movies.  The premise of this movie is, in a word, ridiculous.  Pity really, as the acting and production are both pretty good.  Even liberals should be offended by the simplistic pandering offered up in this pathetic outing, but my guess is they won't be.  I'll guess the feedback on this review will be around 50/50 positive to negative.  How do I know?  Because liberals can't even be objective about how someone expresses his opinion when that opinion differs from their own - and as long as someone or something agrees with their opinion they'll love it........even when it's as lame as this movie.

531288,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXP7,Daniel McInnis,"[4, 7]","Over the months I've become increasingly intent on using my reviews as a forum to critize Academy voters, and though it does little to further my cause of depreciating the over-bloated awards ceremony, seldom has my critisim been more deserving than of Joan Allen's third snub in five years (and that isn't even counting the number of times she's been wrongly denied a nomination).  If she'd asked me I'd have told her to boycott the Oscars, as her tour de force performance in The Contender was merely a footnote to their six thousand members who went with the much flashier and less substative Erin Brockovich star, Julia Roberts.  I hate to attack anyone whose given a good performance, no matter how modest, but the hype surrounding Julia's win was so oversaturated that I can't help but begrudge her, especially when you consider the competion that was overlooked in her favor.Here Joan Allen potrays the first woman nominated to the vice presidency, a liberal Demonocrat (I like her already) who finds herself subject to character assassination by a committee chairman whose idealogy doesn't match her own.  The chairman, Shelly Runyon (played to perfection by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman), is a stauch conservative and feels her disloyal for having crossed over party lines.  You see, she's the duaghter of a Republican governor and once ran herself under the elephand insignia.  So the battle lines are drawn with the charismatic president (Jeff Bridges) and his Chief of Staff (Sam Elliott) facing off with Shelly and a power-driven Democrat (Christian Slater) looking to climb the latter by attaching himself by the hip to a notable Congressman.Shelly's motives for lauching this attack seem blurred.  One one hand he doesn't believe her to have the potential of his perferred candidate (Manhunter's William Petersen), but if he truly feels that Laine (Allen) is incapable and it's merely his tactics that are suspect, than there is still an underlying current of sexism in his beliefs.  During the course of the hearings she displays the &quot;promise of greatness&quot; that he speaks so highly of, but because he's so set in his ways he disregards her virtues and continues to hammer away at her indiscretions.At the root of all this is an alleged encounter she had while in college with two men, exchanging sexual favors for admission into a fraternity.  I must admit that seeing this scene brought to life so vividly in fifteen second increments is pretty tough to stomach and made me do some self-examination in the double standards that I hold women to.  Even as a liberal and devote supporter of Bill Clinton during that whole Monicagate mess, found myself with reservations towards nominating a &quot;loose&quot; woman to office.  Seldom does a movie come along that's this well made that makes you question your own integrity.As I'm sure you've already inferred by now, I think Joan Allen's fabulous in everything she does and to me is the female equivalent of a Marlon Brando or Robert DeNiro.  Her verbal jousting with Oldman, and her banter with Bridges are the best parts of the film and makes me wonder if she as an actress doesn't make those around her better.  Even when sharing the screen with lesser talents she exudes self-assuredness, and they respond by raising the level of their performances.  Christian Slater, whose been wasting away in movies like Hard Rain the past few years, reverts back to the Slater of old.  For the first time since Murder in the First we see the actor who left an indelible print on such contemporary classics as Heathers and Pump up the Volume.As politicals thrillers go, this is about as good as it gets.  Melding together elements of All the President's Men, The Parallax View and the Candidate, Rod Lurie's made a fascinatingly provative film that I'm sure is going to age like wine.",4,Should've  Been  a  Contender,988675200,"05 1, 2001",2001,3857,"['months', ""'ve"", 'become', 'increasingly', 'intent', 'using', 'reviews', 'forum', 'critize', 'Academy', 'voters', 'little', 'further', 'cause', 'depreciating', 'over-bloated', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'seldom', 'critisim', 'been', 'more', 'deserving', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'third', 'snub', 'five', 'years', ""n't"", 'even', 'counting', 'number', 'times', 'been', 'wrongly', 'denied', 'nomination', ""'d"", 'asked', ""'d"", 'have', 'told', 'boycott', 'Oscars', 'tour', 'force', 'performance', 'Contender', 'was', 'merely', 'footnote', 'six', 'members', 'who', 'went', 'much', 'flashier', 'less', 'substative', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'star', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'hate', 'attack', 'anyone', 'given', 'good', 'performance', 'matter', 'how', 'modest', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Julia', 'win', 'was', 'so', 'oversaturated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'begrudge', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'competion', 'was', 'overlooked', 'favor.Here', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'first', 'woman', 'nominated', 'vice', 'presidency', 'liberal', 'Demonocrat', 'like', 'already', 'who', 'subject', 'character', 'assassination', 'committee', 'chairman', 'idealogy', ""n't"", 'match', 'own', 'chairman', 'Shelly', 'Runyon', 'played', 'perfection', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'stauch', 'conservative', 'disloyal', 'having', 'crossed', 'party', 'lines', 'see', 'duaghter', 'Republican', 'governor', 'once', 'ran', 'elephand', 'insignia', 'battle', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'charismatic', 'president', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'facing', 'off', 'Shelly', 'power-driven', 'Democrat', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'looking', 'climb', 'latter', 'attaching', 'hip', 'notable', 'Congressman.Shelly', 'motives', 'lauching', 'attack', 'seem', 'blurred', 'One', 'one', 'hand', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'potential', 'perferred', 'candidate', 'Manhunter', 'William', 'Petersen', 'truly', 'Laine', 'Allen', 'incapable', 'merely', 'tactics', 'are', 'suspect', 'still', 'underlying', 'current', 'sexism', 'beliefs', 'course', 'hearings', 'quot', 'promise', 'greatness', 'quot', 'so', 'highly', 'so', 'set', 'ways', 'virtues', 'hammer', 'away', 'indiscretions.At', 'root', 'alleged', 'encounter', 'had', 'college', 'two', 'men', 'exchanging', 'sexual', 'favors', 'admission', 'fraternity', 'must', 'admit', 'seeing', 'scene', 'brought', 'life', 'so', 'vividly', 'fifteen', 'second', 'increments', 'pretty', 'tough', 'stomach', 'made', 'do', 'self-examination', 'double', 'standards', 'hold', 'women', 'Even', 'liberal', 'devote', 'supporter', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'whole', 'Monicagate', 'mess', 'found', 'reservations', 'towards', 'nominating', 'quot', 'loose', 'quot', 'woman', 'office', 'Seldom', 'movie', 'come', 'well', 'made', 'question', 'own', 'integrity.As', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'already', 'inferred', 'now', 'think', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'fabulous', 'everything', 'female', 'equivalent', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'verbal', 'jousting', 'Oldman', 'banter', 'Bridges', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'wonder', 'actress', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'Even', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'lesser', 'talents', 'self-assuredness', 'respond', 'raising', 'level', 'performances', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'been', 'wasting', 'away', 'movies', 'Hard', 'Rain', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Slater', 'old', 'first', 'time', 'Murder', 'First', 'see', 'actor', 'who', 'left', 'indelible', 'print', 'such', 'contemporary', 'classics', 'Heathers', 'Pump', 'up', 'Volume.As', 'politicals', 'thrillers', 'go', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'Melding', 'together', 'elements', 'President', 'Men', 'Parallax', 'View', 'Candidate', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'made', 'fascinatingly', 'provative', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'going', 'age', 'wine']",N/A
531289,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00003CXP7,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 11]","An interesting movie that is worth watching.  Especially if the world of politics intrigues you.  This is a movie of you either love it or hate it.  It will bring out your feelings of morality and possibly your feelings of partisanship. As a person who worked several years in politics and now in the entertainment industry, I have quite a few feelings about this movie.  Let's start with the entertainment side.  For a movie that stayed at the top for so long, the movie is very interesting and will capture your interest if you go in with an open mind.  Controversial?  For some people it might be but go in this movie with an open mind if possible.  The acting is very well done and the things that play out in the political chess match of who is one up on the other is quite interesting.  Last, if anything bothered me was more on the camera end of the shaking that went on during the discussion scene between the president and his men.  This is merely me being picky but one scene made me question the way the shot was filmed.  I'll have to listen to the director's commentary if there was anything on that.  Probably not.  Also, right after...there is this spot on the camera lens...anyway, again this is me being picky and I don't expect many people to pick up on or needle pick on things.  What matters is the presentation and the storyline which is very well done. Now the political side.  This is a movie that I enjoyed watching because it shows the ugly side of politics that many people don't see.  The movie covered it well and I applaud Rod Lurie for having the ... to do this movie.  For those who scoff at this, I'm sure perhaps there are good politicians that don't get involve in the dirty side of things right?  The DVD is a gem.  Not only do you get Digital 5.1 but you also get DTS.  The DTS feature is alone to make you scream for joy but this is a dialogue movie.  Sure you can hear the helicopters but this is a dialogue movie.  Video is really nice as well.As for the special features, I haven't had the chance to watch the movie with the director's commentary but I'm sure having both Rod Lurie and Joan Allen commenting is a plus.  The deleted scenes were well done and the commentary along with the scenes was a plus.  The production notes on a DVD.  I applaud Dreamworks for this.  Why?  Most companies feel they can put the notes inside the case ala a booklet.  It's nice to have it on the DVD.  Last, the featurette on the behind-the-scenes: The Making of a Political Thriller.  What makes me enjoy this featurette was not that it was nearly half an hour long but also the various references of other popular political movies in the past.  This making of is a definite bonus. All in all, a very interesting and good movie?  Should it win &quot;Best Picture of the Year&quot;?  I felt it was good movie but not great.  Otherwise if you can have an open mind for over two hours, then give it a try.  Try not to let your political beliefs distract you and shout blasphemy.  Keep an open mind.  As for the DVD as a whole, the movie and the special features is worthy enough to entertain you for several hours.",5,An interesting and provactive movie!,984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,3136,"['interesting', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Especially', 'world', 'politics', 'intrigues', 'movie', 'love', 'hate', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'feelings', 'morality', 'possibly', 'feelings', 'partisanship', 'person', 'who', 'worked', 'several', 'years', 'politics', 'now', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'feelings', 'movie', 'Let', 'start', 'entertainment', 'side', 'movie', 'stayed', 'top', 'so', 'long', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'will', 'capture', 'interest', 'go', 'open', 'mind', 'Controversial', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'go', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'possible', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'political', 'chess', 'match', 'who', 'one', 'up', 'other', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Last', 'anything', 'bothered', 'was', 'more', 'camera', 'end', 'shaking', 'went', 'discussion', 'scene', 'president', 'men', 'merely', 'being', 'picky', 'one', 'scene', 'made', 'question', 'way', 'shot', 'was', 'filmed', ""'ll"", 'have', 'listen', 'director', 'commentary', 'was', 'anything', 'Probably', 'not', 'Also', 'right', 'spot', 'camera', 'anyway', 'again', 'being', 'picky', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'many', 'people', 'pick', 'up', 'needle', 'pick', 'things', 'What', 'presentation', 'storyline', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Now', 'political', 'side', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'ugly', 'side', 'politics', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'covered', 'well', 'applaud', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'having', 'do', 'movie', 'who', 'scoff', ""'m"", 'sure', 'perhaps', 'are', 'good', 'politicians', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'involve', 'dirty', 'side', 'things', 'right', 'DVD', 'gem', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'Digital', '5.1', 'also', 'get', 'DTS', 'DTS', 'feature', 'alone', 'make', 'scream', 'joy', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Sure', 'can', 'hear', 'helicopters', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Video', 'really', 'nice', 'well.As', 'special', 'features', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'director', 'commentary', ""'m"", 'sure', 'having', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'commenting', 'plus', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'was', 'plus', 'production', 'notes', 'DVD', 'applaud', 'Dreamworks', 'Why', 'Most', 'companies', 'feel', 'can', 'put', 'notes', 'case', 'booklet', 'nice', 'have', 'DVD', 'Last', 'featurette', 'behind-the-scenes', 'Making', 'Political', 'Thriller', 'What', 'enjoy', 'featurette', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'nearly', 'hour', 'long', 'also', 'various', 'references', 'other', 'popular', 'political', 'movies', 'past', 'making', 'definite', 'bonus', 'very', 'interesting', 'good', 'movie', 'Should', 'win', 'quot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Year', 'quot', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'Otherwise', 'can', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'two', 'hours', 'then', 'give', 'try', 'Try', 'not', 'let', 'political', 'beliefs', 'distract', 'shout', 'blasphemy', 'Keep', 'open', 'mind', 'DVD', 'whole', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'worthy', 'enough', 'entertain', 'several', 'hours']",N/A

YES, this film has a &quot;slant&quot;. ANY film worth its salt has a VIEWPOINT. The fact that &quot;The Contender&quot; sparks such lively debate shows that it succeeds as a FILM, because it makes people THINK (what a concept). The movie blends Capraesque &quot;Mr.Smith&quot; idealism with backstabbing political intrigues worthy of ancient Rome. Gary Oldman is perfect as the Jesse Helms/Joe McCarthy/Newt Gingrich type out to &quot;get&quot; Joan Allen's idealized vice-presidential nominee. Allen gives a commanding performance and never rings a false note. Jeff Bridges plays the president somewhat broadly,(with an amusing wink and a nod to Bill Clinton's &quot;inner foodie&quot;) but his charismatic screen charm wins out. Sam Elliott is a revelation as the president's ruthless, snake-in-the-grass &quot;handler&quot;, contrasting his usual &quot;laid back cowboy&quot; image.

531291,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXP7,D. Litton,"[7, 17]","&quot;What I say, the American people will believe, and do you know why? Because I'll have a very big microphone in front of me.&quot;This comes from the mouth of Congressman Shelly Runyon, one of the many characters in what is perhaps the most intriguing political thriller ever made, &quot;The Contender,&quot; a film that captures so many of today's political and societal elements and behaviors that it becomes much more than just a movie, but a testimonial into the moral beliefs and traditional values of citizens and politicians alike. It focuses on a person's right to a personal life as well as that person's strength and ability to stick to them in a time when people run scared from their beliefs in the face of the possible consequences.The premise of the story begins with the president's search for a suitable candidate to fill the vacant vice president's position after his own running mate's death a few short weeks ago. His first initial choice is Governor Jack Hathaway, whose recent attempted rescue of a drowned woman have made him a hero in the eyes of a nation. But President Jackson Evans decides that he wants someone that American citizens will value for their beliefs, and not for heroics, and therefore rejects Hathaway for his choice candidate, Senator Laine Hanson, who is more than happy to fill the position.Being a Republican-turned-Democrat, Hanson is not liked by some, especially Shelly Runyon, who meets with the rejected Hathaway and lays out his plans of determination to bring down Hanson by delving into her past. He strikes pay dirt when he uncovers photographic evidence of Hanson being &quot;gang-banged&quot; by a college sorority group, and even though none of the photographs show her face outright, many witnesses appear to give their testimonial about the events of that evening, and not in Hanson's favor. As the hearings begin to determine whether or not she is a likely and qualified candidate for the position, the rumors begin to build, more witnesses arrive, but never does Hanson confess or deny the allegations brought against her, stating clearly that it is no one's business as to what her past involved.From the very beginning, the movie piles on the politics, giving us all the terminology without ever making it sound too complicated or overly brainy. It has all the makings of a perfect political thriller, and it takes those makings and makes them reality, giving us a story that is based not only on a person's rights, but on the way in which today's society behaves when there is an authority figure involved in a scandal.The movie itself is a testament to this way of thinking, because instead of focusing solely on the possible sexual proclivities of Hanson, it chooses to allow Runyon to question her morals concerning her political beliefs as well. He very rarely attacks her on the basis of her past, but instead criticizes her beliefs on abortion, separation of church and state, and her atheism. This is the defining contrast between the two major forces against Hanson in the film: the press focuses on her sexual past, while the governing bodies lean towards her moral and societal beliefs.And in dealing with her sexual past, the movie is truly wonderful in never coming out and saying that it, in fact, is her in the photographs, or whether or not she did engage in &quot;deviant sex.&quot; Rare flashback glimpses never give us a clear look at her, nor do the photos. This gives the movie such a great opportunity which it capitalizes on: it allows Hanson to make a choice between allowing the allegations to overtake her or to simply look upon them as personal and say nothing publicly. In her choice to remain silent about her affairs, Hanson comes off as strong, morally righteous and defiant of those who want her out of the running.The plot for this film is complete and utter brilliance, with twist after twist, and revelation after enticing revelation. What really keeps it moving is its connections to the real political world, using such events as Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky as an example of moral belief. The movie also takes a stand on how our nation looks solely at the bad qualities and past events of a person's life, without ever really paying attention to the greatness they have to offer to this country.Performances are solid all around, with an especially commendable performance from Joan Allen, who is the centerstage for all the goes on in this movie. She plays the part of Laine Hanson, who, through Allen's performance, comes off as solid, strong, and most importantly, intelligent, in the face of her enemies. Her acting for this movie deserves a nomination for something at least. Jeff Bridges plays President Evans with sincerety and wit, and he is able to make us believe in the President's stand behind his candidate with firm dialogue and attitude. Gary Oldman plays Shelly Runyon, and does so with all the deviousness and craftiness that he brings to his many other roles that require this trait. He is the character of the film that we love to hate, and by movie's end, we hae no remorse for him. The supporting cast, which includes Christian Slater, Sam Elliot and William Petersen, all bring more life and charisma to the picture, making this cast one of the best of 2000.&quot;The Contender&quot; itself is one of the ten best films of 2000, and also the most innovative political thriller ever made. There were moments that I cheered for; there were times when I felt such a connection between the fiction of the film and reality that it almost seemed disturbing that this is such an accurate portrayal of how we as a nation act in the face of scandal. The movie has a lot to say about us, and about personal rights, and it carries all of this off successfully and with competence.",5,One of the best political thrillers ever made!,984268800,"03 11,

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","THE CONTENDER very bluntly and directly tells us the obvious, namely, there's a double standard when it comes to judging men and women as qualified to hold high office.  When the Vice President dies in office, President Jackson Evans (a fiery Jeff Bridges) appoints Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as his new veep.  Senator Hanson (a former Republican--gasp!--now a pro-life Democrat) must be confirmed by the Senate; but first, she faces a grueling series of hearings before the Senate Judicial Committee, chaired by crafty, uber conservative Senator Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman is chilling).  Senator Runyon is going to pull all the stops to make sure this former ""traitor"" to his party is discredited to the point she withdraws her nomination; accordingly every grain of dirt from Hanson's past is dragged to the surface--particularly charges of infidelity and an alleged episode--while the Senator was in college--involving group sex. And because the Senator is still of child-bearing age--and because she took maternity leave a few years before when she gave birth to a son--Senator Runyon demands the public be told if she ascends to the office of the presidency, and becomes pregnant, will she take maternity leave from the highest office in the land?  Or will she resort to another alternative?  (Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.)Senator Hanson, fully cognizant that had she been a he none of her past dalliances would ever be considered or discussed, sticks to her principles--namely, she tells the committee she refuses to talk about her private life.  And while the rumors and innuendos become even more outrageous and disgusting, she sticks to those principles.  And when President Jackson obtains the evidence to exonerate the senator from the most egregious charge, and pleads with her to come forward with said evidence. . .she still sticks to those principles.  There's a rousing plot twist that had me cheering from my couch, followed by an in-your-face address by the president to a joint session of Congress, making THE CONTENDER one grand political thriller.Allen, Oldman, and Bridges give exceptional performances, but I especially enjoyed Sam Elliott playing the president's chief of staff.  I'm used to seeing this actor in laid-back roles, but here Elliott, sans bushy mustache, is a whirling dervish of human emotion; in short, don't tick off this guy, or it gets ugly very quickly.  One star off for the tired cliches of liberals and conservatives and Washington hypocrisy that is force-fed from start to finish; but if you're in the mood for a grand donnybrook of a political thriller THE CONTENDER is enthusiastically recommended.--D.

And you always will[sic] be.""  should tell you what POTUS thinks about his Republican enemy's Democratic candidate not only for the vice presidency but either as a running mate or opponent in the next Presidential election.  Is the Contender Shelly Runyon and not Hathaway nor Laine Hanson?  Did POTUS return the favor of having a traitor in his party by having Freshman Congressman Christian Slater cross party lines to offer his assistance to Shelly Runyon?  Laine Hanson played by Joan Allen with a glint of Predator around the eyes is herself a trap of sorts for Shelly Runyon and his wife returns the favor by offering seemingly useful information that would make Laine Hanson look as bad as Shelly Runyon should she be foolish enough to give into temptation as Shelly Runyon has.  Some things are too good/awful to be true, neh?  It's a TRAP!This film has a beautiful and large cast of very good actors and is packaged to show a very American take on plush comfort and solid wealth - traditional but not ancient and not stale and not concerned with being impressive.This movie is more foodie thanAmerican Psycho (Uncut Version) (Killer Collector's Edition).  I know about Hot Italian Heroes but what is UP with the Spicy Pen(ne) references?I would watch this film with Season One of House of Cards and Shelly Runyon as George Smiley inTinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  You're in for a treat especially with the latter.n.b.  There are habitual cemetary jogging scenes by both short-haired blondes in this film and in House of Cards probably to show in a seemingly callous treatment of the unfuriating sacrifices made for this country.  And both Shelly Runyon and Francis Urqhart 2.0 have blanked out during conversation reminiscent of Novell's Noorda shift from the present before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.This movie is less obvious than House of Cards - that's the whole point.

531294,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00003CXP7,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[4, 5]","A lazy afternoon of fishing suddenly becomes a life and death struggle that will propel a governor to prominence and head a short list of vice presidential candidates to replace the one that just died. But the next surprise is the one who is actually given the nod, a senator from Ohio, Laine Hanson, played by Joan Allen.This triggers a visceral reaction from Republican Senator Shelly Runyon of Illinois, played by Gary Oldman, who wants to see the passed over candidate, Governor Jack Hathaway, played by William Petersen, get the nod instead of her. As the chairman of the confirmation committee, there is only one thing for him to do--destroy her. Along the way, he enlists the help of a junior Democrat Congressman, Reginald Webster, played by Christian Slater who opposes her nomination for more idealistic reasons. The hearings provide the drama, and the camera takes us to the president, the hearings, the investigation by the FBI, and back to the hearings again. This keeps the story moving at a decent pace, and builds the suspense.What makes this so good for me is that there are many scenes that I would be willing to see over again, but not all. After all, this is not ""The Godfather."" Should you see this, please go back to the beginning and note the governor's behavior and movement, and what the first woman in the story mouths to him.The acting is superb. Senator Runyon reveals a sinister character who has fallen somewhere in the past from the idealistic and moral person his wife married. She sees, with dismay, the change that he does not realize. He plays his part with precise timing, speaking, halting, looking, waiting, baiting, only lacking the accent so identifiable of his home state. Joan Allen is a master at showing a face of barely contained emotion and distress. Jeff Bridges, as President Jackson Evans, is a disarming character who doesn't appear easily vexed in spite of the revelations that come out in the hearings. He takes them in stride, as well as his slight disappointment being unable to catch his White House chefs off-guard or lacking the ingredients for a meal he requests.  His affability camouflages his caginess as he challenges once again the man he defeated in the presidential election, Shelly Runyon. A minor but thoroughly believable role was given to Kathryn Morris, playing Paige Willomina, a pony-tailed, cutsey, eye-glass-wearing, nerdy, almost ditzy FBI agent who is as sharp as a tack, and doesn't miss a word or nuance.The viewer might be unhappy that the noble characters are progressive or that Runyon and his minions are not. You can despise the character of Runyon, without concern for his political persuasion. You can admire Hanson without embracing what she stands for politically. That is the strength of this film. Nevertheless, the movie represents something that is not so far from present-day Washington on both sides of the aisle--putting partisan politics above the good of the country and winning at all costs.  Released in 2000, it might be a reflection of the White House and Congress of the last decade with some exaggeration, but ten years later, it might be a reality that no one thought would happen.Four stars because it will appeal to the political drama afficionado, but as I watched the feminine form on the love seat next to me drift in and out of consciousness, I was reminded that it might not be for all audiences, and she will probably get even by turning on ""The Bachelor.""

531295,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,B00003CXP7,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[1, 3]","Hmmmm. Hello. (chuckles) It's funny, some of the same people who give this one wild ride of politics one star, [mostly because of delayed adolescent political reasons], are the same ones who give films like Fantastic Four and Scream five stars. Enough said.I was glued to my seat from almost inception to the ending, and Mr. Lurie did a fine job with the plot twist and turns and had me guessing left and right what was going to happen, right to the very end. That is a special craft to not have a film so predictable, and I think Rod did that here exceptionally well IMHO. The four people watching it with me were equally suprised at the realism of the acting, and we were really impressed that it was not just another, boring, tired political drama. I have not enjoyed such a movie in years, it was so great to finally see a film that evoked so much response and emotion from its watchers.The scene where Joan Allen, (absolutely adored her in Bobby Fischer) [and how can you not love here in almost everything], is getting drilled about her sex party in chambers, was so nerve racking, I was actually sweating for her and chewing on my nails and had to shush, shush a friend, almost getting terribly angry, as I did not want to miss one emotion or reaction of her character. INTENSE. Not many films can do that to me. Certainly Scream wont.In the age of the lost classic, and Dimension Film excrement, it is refreshing to see a super charged cast, with the likes of Bridges and Allen and movie lover, think about the absolute PURE RAW ACTING CRAFT you have in this...Sam Elliott> I mean honestly, he is one of my favorite actors of all time, in every single roll he is in, he is superb. Now don't shoot me down because I don't agree with you if you hated it. Try to see the acting side, instead of your paltry, political views and the like. Sam Elliott was astonishing in 'Mask' and he was absolutely riveting and brilliant in his role as Kermit Newman. He scared the crap out of me, he was so domineering and stellar. That is right, his performance was stellar. Gary Oldman, brilliant. I mean absolutely brilliant. I am still trying to cope with people giving this one star, it truly boggles my mind. Gary Oldman, is unarguably one of the finest, most talented creatures to exist in film. His roles have stayed with many for years and years and are so plot driven and acted with the highest quality and method. Sinister, mesmorizing and flat out glowing performances and on screen chemistry....William Peterson, Jeff Bridges, {bland ok role as president}, but he wasn't trying to steal the show; it was Joan's ride all the way...Character actor Philip Baker Hall, who's mystical, whispy voice is such a wonderful addition to any movie; and the ever endearing and personable Saul Rubinek round out an exceptional ensemble cast. Ok yeah the uninspiring and 'give it up now' Slater as well, but we can all agree how horrific he is.I found this diamond amongst the rough in a close out deal rack, and I am glad I did.

As for Joan Allen, I've liked her a good deal better in other movies, such as NIXON. I even liked her considerably in PLEASANTVILLE, although I found the movie as a whole pretty flaky.  [Joan Allen] plays a designee for Vice-President, appointed by the President after a Vice-President's death. The movie will focus on the confirmation process she has to go through and how it becomes nasty. Her opponents dig up an allegation that during her college days she participated in a group sex incident as a part of a fraternity initiation. She right off refuses to say whether the allegation is true or not, insisting that it is totally irrelevant to her qualifications to be Vice-President. To that extent I sympathize with her. I think it should be consideded irrelevant. But what in the movie does become relevant to those qualifications? Very little. The movie ends up dominated with the accusations about the alleged group sex and no less pre-occupied with her protestations of the question's irrelevance. If those are not what dominates the movie's screen-time, they certainly seem to be.

However, it detracts from a film when a writer/director uses a film as his personal pulpit from which to preach a political philosophy replete with pejorative value judgments about those who disagree.  Writer/Director Rod Lurie's story is a good one that is relevant in today's political climate.  Unfortunately, Lurie's obvious liberal crusade pervades the film and his depictions of Republicans as vile and hateful people are so exaggerated that it makes the film far less realistic.This leads to numerous plot inconsistencies.  For instance, it is impossible to believe that Senator Hanson could have switched from Republican to Democrat.  With her ultra leftist political views, she never would have been elected as a Republican initially because the party would not have supported her candidacy.  Also, Lurie tries to make Hanson into such a saintly character that he ignores the first rule of political mudslinging.  A candidate must never respond to a smear campaign when it is true, and always respond when it is false.  Another directorial error was attempting to make Hanson look like an athlete by including the running and basketball scenes when Joan Allen is not particularly athletic.Despite these unnerving flaws, the dramatic tension of the film is outstanding.  The political infighting and backroom deals are very realistic and Lurie maintains a razor sharp edge throughout, pacing the film perfectly.  He captures the supercharged atmosphere that results from the high stakes involved in national politics.The acting in this film is outstanding.  Joan Allen nails this role with a career performance that is likely to put her on the map.  She is tough and smart in her portrayal, but not so callous that she is unable to identify with the character's vulnerability.  Jeff Bridges is excellent as the president, playing the part with a haughty swagger and a cavalier attitude towards all around him.  His delivery of the final speech is spine tingling.  Gary Oldman is also electric as the evil and conniving Congressman, and though I didn't like the way the character was written, I can't imagine anyone playing him better.  Sam Elliott blows the roof off the White House with his no-bull performance as the President's Chief of Staff.This film is an excellent drama with numerous flaws propagated by a strident director with a political axe to grind.

Even Gary Oldman complained bitterly about the lack of balance that marked the Contender.  It is a bigoted anti-religious screed.  Early on when Senator Laine Hanson's six-year-old son mentions that the 'baby Jesus' created 'top-spin', Hanson's father is outraged.  Apparently the kid heard this from his private school teacher. Ex-Governor Hanson mentions that he spent his career trying to stop this 'nonsense' in the public schools (yeah, this kid goes to a public school).  Later on our heroine Hanson announces that though she is an 'atheist', she 'worships' in the 'church of Democracy'. As usual, the bad guy (Gary Oldman as Sheldon Runyon) not only looks like a bad-haired geek, but he's pro-life as well.  He's a red meat eater (several scenes pointedly depict him cutting and eating steak) while our sensitive pro-choice (it's a 'fetus') heroine is a vegetarian. He's unkempt; she dresses smart.  The message is clear -- only clods are pro-life while cool, sensitive people are for abortion rights. As an earlier reviewer has pointed out, the clearest analogy to The Contender in real life was the Clarence Thomas hearings. In Thomas' case, he was smeared with charges of sexual impropriety. But that's o.k. -- he was a conservative. I always enjoy Gary Oldman and he turns in another engagingly eccentric performance. Otherwise, this film is a disaster.

Realizing, that the character of Jeff Bridges combines the aura of JFK, the wiliness of LBJ with dashes of FDR, I came to admire the film even more. This is a fictional presidency, but an ideal one, grounded in principles, precedents and the rule of laws. Very few presidencies since JFK have been allowed to embrace and uphold those ideals. It is a disgrace that this country cannot take inspiration from works of fiction that bleed for a return to Lincolnian wisdom.If a liberal is one who wishes to return to a presidency of justice, decency and the rule of law over privilege, than so be it.

If it did, how might it play out. Certainly, what is depicted as the plot of this film is one such outcome.

Runyon, [Gary Oldman] play the role of the power mad hypocrit that every viewer would have contempt for, was a cheap cliche despite Gary Oldman's savvy execution of his predictable role.Making matters worse, we have Runyon's wife coming to Senator Hanson and telling her that her husband had forced her to have an abortion 20 years earlier. This, despite his rhetorically insistence that life is precious to him, but not to Hanson, during Hanson's ongoing confirmation hearing.-----*- Secondly, Senator Laine Hanson, [Joan Allen] refused to deny the charges by Runyon, that she was a college co-ed prostitute 25 years earlier. She kept repeating to the committee, and the press, something along the lines - that she wouldn't dignify the charge with a response. Nevertheless, at the end of the film, Senator Hanson does tell the President [Jeff Bridges] and through him, us as well - that she is innocent, the pictures were fake, and the witnesses had lied.

It is a duty, a must, a compulsory mandatory obligation for any free citizen in this world to watch this film, at least twice to recognize the mugs and the characters and understand all the allusions. Launched in 2000 to prepare Al Gore's presidency, it came too early because Russia is not the only country where elections are manipulated to paint up the result some want though they have no right to get it. The film is perfect in the present situation if you believe in democracy, the Shrine of Democracy in Mount Rushmore that any political assembly, caucus, council, committee must - not should, I said must - be in a democratic country. If you believe in the right for every and each citizen to decide on their private life and use of their brains and bodies. And it is time, high time this country finally democratically decides to entrust supreme power to those who are not and don't want to be only men, white if possible and by necessity, who do not accept to harbor guns and weapons in their homes, or to negate the rights for women to do what they want with their life and body. Those who do not want women to be negated the right to choose. And above all those who consider private life to be just that, private, and who oppose those who are always looking for perverted and perverse private events, made up and invented if necessary, to discredit those they don't like. It is high time the victims of that insistent and permanent, still true and alive, discrimination against more than half the population of the USA comes to an end. And for the first time in US history, Time magazine saw what some possible roads to freedom could be and put up on the front page of a recent issue Obama's picture with the title of this very film, The Contender, across the page. Let me congratulate Ted Turner and his successors. Yes it is time for a woman and a Black to become the hope and future of this country in which we are so proud to believe in spite of all the imperialistic reflexes some of its leaders develop as if it were their second nature, or maybe even their first nature. It is well known Washington did cut the cherry tree and did not tell a lie about it, even before he did it. That is not true of everyone indeed, and some are definitely both guilty and irresponsible in front of human history. Let's hope all the fundamentalists, from the communistic, anarchistic or just old-fashioned Trotskyite left to the authoritarian, militaristic or plainly conservative right will be pushed aside and the reasonable who know life is a constant creation through work, learning, exchanging knowledge and goods, experience and expertise, and many other creative elements. In our societies some dead individuals were neglected and overlooked when burying time had come and they are still roaming around among us the living, un-dead as they are and be sure dead and un-alive un-dead they are. That's all the bad future I am dreaming humanity will offer themselves in the next few years, in the USA or in China, or in Europe, democracy in our homes and gardens and public squares. But remember a Shrine of Democracy has to be built in every home, in every school, in every village, in every neighborhood, and that will take more time and courage from everyone of us than just bouncing up and down in our seats and banging over and over again our hands on the tables, humming and repeating ""Red Alert!

531310,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B00003CXP7,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[13, 23]","Former film critic Rod Lurie is one of the few filmmakers who specializes in movies about American politics.  For watching his films, its obvious that Lurie is a political junkie who has digested a lot of political information and trivia over the years.  Its also sadly obvious that he has no idea what to do with that information.  His second film, The Contender, is a perfect example.  The overly convuluted plot deals with the behind-the-scenes struggles to get Senator Joan Allen confirmed to the office of the Vice Presidency.  An outspoken liberal, Allen is nominated by President Jeff Bridges and forced to face the vilest of slanders from the chairman of the confirmation committee, a conservative played by a true-life conservative, the brilliant Gary Oldman (who also executive produced and later denounced this film).  William L. Petersen shows up as a Governor who wanted the nomination for himself, Christian Slater plays a young, liberal Represenative who opposes Allen because he feels that, as a former Republican, she's too much of a moderate (though she doesn't express one even slightly right-wing sentiment throughout the film), and Sam Elliott's also wandering about as Bridges' cheif-of-staff.  And there's a lot of other character actors popping up as well, helping to create a certain community theater feel to the whole affair.  Allen is forced to face charges of a long-ago sexual impropriety.  Its implied that she was a slut in college and, while everyone else begs her to clear the matter up, Allen responds with, &quot;It is simply beneath my dignity.&quot;  I think this line is supposed to be heroic and maybe in real life, it would be.  In an overlong, simplistic film like this, its simply annoying.  Even more annoying is that, after six hours or however long this film drags on, Allen finally does tell what happened and, of course, the charges are baseless.  In short, there really was no scandal and one can here Lurie saying, &quot;Hey, whattya know?  Thanks for sitting through the film, folks!&quot;Anyway, this film is full of political trivia and information but none of it really seems to connect with anything on screen.  Characters are quick to drop historical names and cite various incidents in the forgotten past (mostly concerning Nelson Rockefeller's Vice Presidency) but so what?  Rather than giving an insider's view of how government works, Lurie seems to be showing off.  The film comes across as a high school civics report written by the teacher's pet who is all too quick to smugly point out that he knows more about the U.S. Constitution than you do.  As well, there are other little details that, when put together, take away from the film's credibility.  Some of these are reflected in Lurie's directorial choices -- many of the scenes seem to linger just a second too long.  Such as, we get a lingering shot at Slater at a presidential reception with his blonde wife on his arm.  We see Slater shake the President's hand and then just stand around, doing that weird smiling thing he seems to do when he's not sure what else to do.  The shot goes on and on and on with no real purpose.  This may seem a small thing but one all these moments are added up, it becomes distracting.  Other problems seem to be brought on by the film's limited budget.  Again these things are small -- such as a shot of a Newsweek with Jeff Bridges on the cover and headline reading &quot;President Evans -- His views have changed the world&quot; that is painfully fake -- but when added up, detract from the film's realism.Of course, the big problem is Allen.  She's a wonderful actress and its good someone finally wrote a film where she can actually be the lead.  But Lurie seems so proud to have created an independent, strong woman, he doesn't seem to notice that he's also made her a complete bore.  Written to be strong, Allen instead comes across as rather shrill and inflexible.  Regardless of what you think of her politics, you have to wonder whether you'd really want her to be a heartbeat away from the President.  Change her sex and make her a conservative and you'd basically have Pat Buchanan.  Allen's big moment comes when she lists, for Oldman's committee, the issues that she believes in.  This is supposed to be a curageous moment but its hard to see how being pro-choice, for campaign finance reform, and greater social spending makes one all that unusual for an American politician.  Most polls show that Americans, superficially at least, agree with everything Allen says.  Perhaps the only real departure from general opinion is Allen's outspoken aetheism but even that's taken to such an extent that Allen seems less a free thinker and more an anti-religious bigot.  Just as one wouldn't want a Jerry Falwell or a Pat Robertson in the White House, a sensible person (religiously inclined or not) probably wouldn't want a Vice President who seems to suffer from an inflexible hatred of anything suggesting belief in a higher power.That said, the film does have two bright spots.  Jeff Bridges is likeable as the President if just because he actually dares to smile and not take everything so seriously -- one wonders what he'd see in a politician as rigid as Allen.  As well, Gary Oldman brings a sincerity to his right-wing role and refuses to turn the character into a stereotypical villian.  Its ironic that one of the few dignified Republicans should appear in a such a piece of liberal claptrap as this.",2,A dull film from the teacher's pet,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,5472,"['Former',

531315,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B00003CXP7,John Noodles,"[9, 15]","This movie could have been great.  The first half was dramatic, compelling, believeable, and character-driven.  The 2nd half degenerated into the tawdriest and most unbelieveable sort of political propagandizing imagineable.  It's hard to believe, in fact, that the person who wrote the first half of this movie also wrote the 2nd half.The first half of this movie is very human...a story about people in politics, being tested by morally ambiguous circumstances.  Their actual politics, while clearly laid out, are secondary.  Moviemakers used to wisely recognize the folly of imposing their own political views on their audience, and made sure that political expressions were limited to those that were fairly universally accepted--truth, honesty, and so forth.  Remember ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""? ""The Contender,"" however, goes out of its way to do the exact opposite.Near the beginning of the movie,Laine Hanson (an unbelieveably saintly Republican-turned-Democrat) is speaking to her father, a retired Republican Governor, whom the filmmakers gratuitously have chide his grandchild for his kindergarten teacher's having mentioned Jesus in the classroom. Teachers are there to ""teach, not preach,"" and he denounces her remark about Jesus as ""superstition""--quite beside anything remotely pertinent to the story.  His remark, though, is pointed, his attitude is bizarrely sneering for what the writers clearly hope to pass off as an aside.  The movie gets much worse, though.  Later, during what is supposed to be a rousing and morally superior closing statement before the Senate Confirmation Committee that has been questioning her moral suitability, she proudly declares herself to be an atheist who worships in the ""chapel of democracy.""  During the same speech, she declares that she wants to remove ""every gun from every household,""  that she supports a woman's sacred right to choose, and so on and so forth.  Standard political boilerplate.  (Curiously, she states at one point that she left the Republican party when they moved away from the values she espouses.  I wonder...when has the Republican party EVER espoused gun banning, abortion, abolition of the death penalty, or any of the causes for which Laine now so zealously crusades?  Are the filmmakers trying to make her seem thoughtful and fairminded in her zeal?  Come on!)Okay, so what's wrong with this?  After all, she's a politician expressing political ideals.  What's wrong is this:  First of all, the speech is hokey as can be, with music clearly meant to raise us to a feverish pitch of (left-wing) patriotism...the effect, though is embarrassing.  I was uncomfortable for Joan Allen having to recite such awful lines.  Second, she's is supposed to be a moderate Democrat...yet all the views she expresses extremely left-wing.  Even Republicans in this movie espouse leftist ideology (like her father).  The one person who expresses a conservative viewpoint is Gary Oldman's character, a political hardball player who during the confirmation hearings is given to snarling at this poor woman for supporting a ""holocaust"" of ""unborn babies.""  The cliches are fast and furious.  To show, however, that Runyon (Oldman's character) is--or WAS-- a good man, the writers trot out his haggard wife and have her remind him of the time he stood for something good...the time he stood up for hate crime legislation!  Amazing.  And it's not bad enough that Runyon is the bad guy:  The filmmakers make him as ugly as they can.  Third, the filmmakers take all this silly rhetoric as seriously as Laine Hanson does!  In fact, if this movie's failure can be summed up, it is probably that the moviemakers are as gravely serious about the protagonist's trenchant and extreme ideology as she is.  The term for this is: Authorial Intrusion.  The moviemakers committ is, big time.The problem with this movie is not that it favors liberal ideology, of course.  It's that it favors ANY ideology.  You cannot promote any controversial agenda as brazenly and aggressively as this movie does, and not have it throw the whole movie off kilter.  The ending of this movie--which I will not divulge--is improbably beyond belief.  This movie has been billed as a political thriller.  It isn't.  It's a hybrid between a cheesy soap opera, and a propaganda film.  Gary Oldman and Joan Allen deliver great performances, though, and if this movie is worth seeing at all, it is just to see two great actors practicing their craft.",2,It Coulda Been Great!,983836800,"03 6, 2001",2001,4479,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'dramatic', 'compelling', 'believeable', 'character-driven', '2nd', 'half', 'degenerated', 'tawdriest', 'most', 'unbelieveable', 'sort', 'political', 'propagandizing', 'imagineable', 'hard', 'believe', 'fact', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'also', 'wrote', '2nd', 'half.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'people', 'politics', 'being', 'tested', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'circumstances', 'actual', 'politics', 'clearly', 'laid', 'out', 'are', 'secondary', 'Moviemakers', 'used', 'wisely', 'recognize', 'folly', 'imposing', 'own', 'political', 'views', 'audience', 'made', 'sure', 'political', 'expressions', 'were', 'limited', 'were', 'fairly', 'universally', 'accepted', 'truth', 'honesty', 'so', 'forth', 'Remember', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Contender', 'however', 'way', 'do', 'exact', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Laine', 'Hanson', 'unbelieveably', 'saintly', 'Republican-turned-Democrat', 'speaking', 'father', 'retired', 'Republican', 'Governor', 'whom', 'filmmakers', 'gratuitously', 'have', 'chide', 'grandchild', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'having', 'mentioned', 'Jesus', 'classroom', 'Teachers', 'are', 'there', 'teach', 'not', 'preach', 'remark', 'about', 'Jesus', 'superstition', 'quite', 'anything', 'remotely', 'pertinent', 'story', 'remark', 'pointed', 'attitude', 'bizarrely', 'sneering', 'what', 'writers', 'clearly', 'hope', 'pass', 'off', 'aside', 'movie', 'much', 'worse', 'though', 'Later', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'rousing', 'morally', 'superior', 'closing', 'statement', 'Senate', 'Confirmation', 'Committee', 'been', 'questioning', 'moral', 'suitability', 'proudly', 'be', 'atheist', 'who', 'chapel', 'democracy', 'same', 'speech', 'remove', 'gun', 'household', 'woman', 'sacred', 'right', 'choose', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Standard', 'political', 'boilerplate', 'Curiously', 'one', 'point', 'left', 'Republican', 'party', 'when', 'moved', 'away', 'values', 'wonder', 'when', 'Republican', 'party', 'EVER', 'espoused', 'gun', 'banning', 'abortion', 'abolition', 'death', 'penalty', 'causes', 'Laine', 'now', 'so', 'zealously', 'crusades', 'Are', 'filmmakers', 'trying', 'make', 'seem', 'thoughtful', 'fairminded', 'zeal', 'Come', 'Okay', 'what', 'wrong', 'politician', 'expressing', 'political', 'ideals', 'What', 'wrong', 'First', 'all', 'speech', 'hokey', 'can', 'be', 'music', 'clearly', 'meant', 'raise', 'feverish', 'pitch', 'left-wing', 'patriotism', 'effect', 'embarrassing', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'having', 'recite', 'such', 'awful', 'lines', 'Second', 'supposed', 'be', 'moderate', 'Democrat', 'yet', 'views', 'extremely', 'left-wing', 'Even', 'Republicans', 'movie', 'leftist', 'ideology', 'father', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'conservative', 'viewpoint', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'character', 'political', 'hardball', 'player', 'who', 'confirmation', 'hearings', 'given', 'snarling', 'poor', 'woman', 'supporting', 'holocaust', 'unborn', 'babies', 'cliches', 'are', 'fast', 'furious', 'show', 'however', 'Runyon', 'Oldman', 'character', 'WAS', 'good', 'man', 'writers', 'trot', 'out', 'haggard', 'wife', 'have', 'remind', 'time', 'stood', 'something', 'good', 'time', 'stood', 'up', 'hate', 'crime', 'legislation', 'Amazing', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'Runyon', 'bad', 'guy', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'as', 'ugly', 'can', 'Third', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'silly', 'rhetoric', 'as', 'seriously', 'Laine', 'Hanson', 'fact', 'movie', 'failure', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'probably', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'gravely', 'serious', 'protagonist', 'trenchant', 'extreme', 'ideology', 'term', 'Authorial', 'Intrusion', 'moviemakers', 'committ', 'big', 'time.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'liberal', 'ideology', 'course', 'ANY', 'ideology', 'can', 'not', 'promote', 'controversial', 'agenda', 'brazenly', 'aggressively', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'throw', 'whole', 'movie', 'kilter', 'ending', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'improbably', 'belief', 'movie', 'been', 'billed', 'political', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'hybrid', 'cheesy', 'soap', 'opera', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'see', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'practicing', 'craft']",N/A

The acting and directing is superb, but as with just about anything Steven Spielberg touches (his company, DreamWorks, produced this little rat-fest), the story is rather hollow. Hollywood dreamers continue to portray &quot;their guys&quot; (Democrats) as noble, and the &quot;enemy&quot; (Republicans) as heartless ambitionaries. Thus in &quot;An American President&quot;, we have a widower stand-in for Bill Clinton whose chief crime is going out on a date, and whose chief adversary (Bob Rumsford, a clear allusion to Bob Dole), has nothing whatsoever to recommend him. Bob Dole, of course, risked his left and lost the use of his right arm whilst fighting in WWII, but never mind, that's too much to give him credit for.Here we have a Senate Judiciary chairman - Sheldon &quot;Shelly&quot; Runyon, who they had to put in the movie because the real Republican Judiciary Chairman, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is way too much of a Boy Scout, although the movie intersperses real names with fictitious - Barbara Boxer actually is a Senator, Runyon is not, etc. Don't waste your money on this propaganda.

531322,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00003CXP7,kacunnin,"[1, 1]","Rod Lurie's THE CONTENDER (2000) is one of those political movies aimed at making us all feel better about the political system of this ""greatest country on the face of the earth.""  The film focuses on the confirmation process when the president (Jeff Bridges) decides to appoint female senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) to fill the Vice Presidential slot vacated when the VP died three weeks earlier.  Bridges's President Jackson Evans is in the final leg of his final term, and he wants to make a ""big move"" - thus he picks Hanson instead of political sure-bet Jack Hathaway (William Peterson), who made headlines when he attempted to save a drowning woman whose car went off a bridge into river.  As expected, the head of the House committee in charge of the confirmation hearing, Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), isn't happy about Hanson's nomination.  First, she's a woman, second, she's too liberal (pro-Choice, anti-guns), and third, she's not Hathaway.  So Runyon and his minions dig up a bunch of pictures portraying Hanson as the primary participant in a sex orgy when she was a nineteen-year-old college freshman.  It's all very sleazy and we get a few almost-pornographic snippets of naked Hanson in various compromising positions with a bevy of frat boys.The film suggests that it's only because Hanson is a woman that such things have become an issue in her confirmation.  Several characters in this film insist that were Hanson a man, he'd be patted on the back for his orgiastic ""coming-of-age.""  Come on, really?!?  Suppose Romney's people had found photographs of a naked Barack Obama at nineteen performing a host of sexual acts with a bunch of sorority girls - you really think it wouldn't have been an issue?  Gary Hart's career was sidelined just because of one photo of him with a bikini-clad woman on his lap!  Clinton was impeached (impeached!) because he had the audacity to claim, ""I did not have sex with that woman!""  There may be a lot of misogyny in Washington - and I don't doubt a female candidate for Vice President would face opposition because she's female - but this particular scenario is so over-the-top that it defies credulity.  In reality, any candidate for a major office put in such a position would be pressured to step down.  No one wants a Vice President whose naked photos are all over the Internet!What's frustrating about THE CONTENDER is that it has a stellar cast, and for the most part the performances are exceptional.  Allen is perfect as the maligned Laine Hanson, trying desperately not to be drawn into a discussion of what did or didn't happen when she was in college.  Jeff Bridges gives a believable and amusing portrayal of a president whose career is coming to a close - he wants to support Hanson, but he doesn't want his swan song to become a train wreck.  Sam Elliot is great as the president's Chief of Staff, and Gary Oldman gives Shelly Runyon just the right combination of sleaze, selfishness, and patriotism.  There's an odd character played by Christian Slater - a junior Representative who pushes his way onto Runyon's committee - that doesn't really jive with the rest of the film, but aside from that the characters work.  So it's really frustrating that the film is ultimately disappointing.There's a scene late in the film where President Evans eludes his Secret Service detail (really?) to share a cigar-enhanced tte-&agrave;-tte with Hanson on the White House lawn.  This scene feels very much as if it was added to provide information preview audiences might have clamored for.  Unfortunately, the result is an ultimate cop-out, not only on Hanson's multi-faceted character, but on the issue of whether incidents from a candidate's private life (especially incidents that happened almost thirty years ago) are fair game.  And this isn't the only cop-out; the film does something with William Peterson's character, also near the end, that is not only patently unbelievable but again cops out on what it means to choose between two viable candidates for the same office.  President Evans initially selects Hanson over Peterson's Jack Hathaway because he wants to go down in history as having made such an historic move.  Hathaway is portrayed as a good guy, a governor everyone likes (sort of like Chris Christie after Sandy), so the dilemma is interesting.  Do you pick the easily-confirmable Hathaway or the risky-but-historic Hanson?  The cop-out here just makes that question moot.Overall, THE CONTENDER is a very watchable film, and it's certainly not dull.  But it does seem set up to make us all feel good in the end (smarmy Runyon gets his comeuppance and the film's cop-outs - especially involving Laine Hanson - allow us to have an AMERICAN PRESIDENT moment in the final minutes).  This really could have been a sharp and challenging film about the political world we live in today.  Instead it settled for being a nice little movie about how slimy politics is - but don't worry because the good guys will always win out in the end.",3,Engaging political thriller -- ltimately

Jeff Bridges is cast as the president, who wants to be remembered in history as appointing a woman vice president and Gary Oldman is cast as the sleazy chairman of the investigating committee.  Written and directed by Rod Lurie, the dialog is tight, the film fast paced, and the many twists and turns kept me fascinated throughout.Perhaps this film didn't get the recognition it deserved because it broke some rules of making films about politics.  It is frankly partisan and feminist, slanted towards a liberal democrat position.  The viewer, therefore, has more to think about than just the quality of the script, the directing and the acting. The quality is there, however, whatever your politics.  Joan Allen plays the role with a quiet dignity that is neither overly sensual or cold.  She's attractive and healthy as well as being highly intelligent and ethnical. What a combination!  No wonder she was nominated for an academy award for this role. Most of the scenes are inside shots of the president's office and hearing rooms, but the dialog is sharp and fast,  the camera lingering just long enough to pick up nuances of facial expressions.

Hudson remains true to herself and her convictions when others swing with the politcal winds in the controversy that arises over her confirmation.Joan Allen stars and deserves the strong reviews she got for the film, but the real star is Gary Oldman, who both produced the film and stars as Allen's nemesis, Sheldon Runyon the representative who heads the committee to &quot;confirm&quot; her nomination.  Shelly never intends for her nomination to go forward, openly favoring the governor of Virginia, (played beautifully by William Petersen, with a surprise twist of character!) Although he is not fond of Hudson's politics, it is really not her he is opposed to, he just wants to best the President, who defeated him in the last election.  Oldman plays his role as an unattractive, smarmy little beast who preens at the attention given to him by a young Democrat, (Christian Slater) that he attempts to mentor.  A fine contribution to hisacting catalog, &quot;The Contender&quot; sets the stage for Oldman behind the camera.Jeff Bridges plays the President, who is somewhat amused by all the goings on, who waffles on the final decision and finally saves the day.  His major contribution to the film was an ongoingfunny sequence about how he can get any type of food, no matter how silly or ill timed, at any time of the day from the White House culinary staff.In the hands of a better director (Oldman should have done this, as well!), the film would have presented its drama a little more clearly, and with a little less emphasis on Lurie's leanings to the Democratic party.  Despite this, and with some added features in the DVD such as a charming interview with Allen (cold, elegant, driven in the film; warm, generous and artistic in the interview), the DVD exceeded my expectations, and I would see it again!",4,I Coulda Been A Contender (not!)....,1006473600,"11 23, 2001",2001,2062,"['woman', 'who', 'designs', 'political', 'post', 'will', 'think', 'twice', 'seeing', 'film', 'know', 'would', 'not', 'relish', 'full-barrel', 'attack', 'past', 'indiscretions', 'Vice', 'Presidential', 'nominee', 'Laine', 'Hudson', 'grace', 'dignity', 'Hudson', 'true', 'herself', 'convictions', 'when', 'others', 'swing', 'politcal', 'winds', 'controversy', 'confirmation.Joan', 'Allen', 'stars', 'strong', 'reviews', 'got', 'film', 'real', 'star', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'stars', 'Allen', 'nemesis', 'Sheldon', 'Runyon', 'representative', 'who', 'committee', 'quot', 'confirm', 'quot', 'nomination', 'Shelly', 'never', 'nomination', 'go', 'forward', 'openly', 'favoring', 'governor', 'Virginia', 'played', 'beautifully', 'William', 'Petersen', 'surprise', 'twist', 'character', 'not', 'fond', 'Hudson', 'politics', 'really', 'not', 'opposed', 'just', 'best', 'President', 'who', 'defeated', 'last', 'election', 'Oldman', 'role', 'unattractive', 'smarmy', 'little', 'beast', 'who', 'attention', 'given', 'young', 'Democrat', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'mentor', 'fine', 'contribution', 'hisacting', 'catalog', 'quot', 'Contender', 'quot', 'stage', 'Oldman', 'camera.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'President', 'who', 'somewhat', 'amused', 'goings', 'who', 'final', 'decision', 'finally', 'day', 'major', 'contribution', 'film', 'was', 'ongoingfunny', 'sequence', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'type', 'food', 'matter', 'how', 'silly', 'ill', 'timed', 'time', 'day', 'White', 'House', 'culinary', 'staff.In', 'hands', 'better', 'director', 'Oldman', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'presented', 'drama', 'little', 'more', 'clearly', 'little', 'less', 'emphasis', 'Lurie', 'leanings', 'Democratic', 'party', 'added', 'features', 'DVD', 'such', 'charming', 'interview', 'Allen', 'cold', 'elegant', 'driven', 'film', 'generous', 'artistic', 'interview', 'DVD', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'would', 'see', 'again']",N/A
531329,A79U01AE98EV8,B00003CXP7,MACLEAR,"[3, 3]","""The Contender"" is another in a long line of polemical political movies that steamrolls over any chance the audience has for a legitimate suspension of disbelief.Our sympathies are supposed to lie with the President, a bullying, strident man whose sole occupation seems to be trying to stump his cooks with an odd lunch request.  He doesn't seem to have any political vision outside of going out in a burst of glory.  The burst of glory is represented here by Joan Allen's character who is unbelievably unlikable.  So what if she is an athiest.  Such a position should be applauded. (I ask you, in what dimension would Congress confirm a devout athiest?).  She stole the husband of her best friend.  But we are asked to see that as a minor character flaw having no weight in any confirmation hearing.  She does apologize, but only because it is politically expedient for her to do so. ""It's not as though I am an adultress!"" she self-righteously exclaims.  No.  She is a disloyal homewrecker.  Of course, we in the audience are asked to forgive such lapses - after all what do questions of character have to do with politicians?  I don't know about what others think, but one's character is a reflection of one's principles and her principles are, at best, dubious.Gary Oldman plays a senator bitterly opposed to Laine being confirmed as Vice-President.  Where in the name of all that's holy did they come up with the wig he (barely) wears?  As far as the film is concerned, he has no right to get in the way of the President.  At one point Bridges asks Oldman how he dares get in his Eminence's way.  Oh, I don't know Mr. President, I thought that in this country people could oppose their President's views without being termed corrupt.  Oldman's character engages in so much sleaze it amazes one he doesn't squeak and squeal as he walks.  Among his crimes are his uncovering of the Senator's sexual indiscretions, his being anti-abortion, his being pro-death penalty, and his outrageous hairpiece.Then there is a young (he must have been forty) senator, played by Christian Slater, whose political future is threatened by the President if he doesn't play ball.  And this is the President we are asked to admire as a bulwark of democracy - a man whose henchman Kermit is one of the most ruthless characters to ever grace a screen, a man who does the President's dirty work.  You see the movie condemns Oldman's character for being underhanded and corrupt while asking us to embrace the underhanded nature of the incumbent in charge.The film is capped by Bridges giving a rousing speech to the whole of Congress - condemning them for not rubber stamping his candidate.  How dare they!!  Only one congressman leaves.  The remainder are spiritually cleansed by the President's harsh words and give him a standing ovation as he exorts them to do their duty and confirm Allen's character, presumably for no other reason than because she is female - and a saint.The film does not stop at having her confirmed.  She is canonized.If you are one who believes in fairy tales this film has your name on it.  If you have at least one foot in reality, give it a miss.

If you have liberal leanings, politically, you might very likely enjoy this movie. If you are of the conservative like, then you would probably not like this movie. If you can manage to take how you feel about politics out of your mind while watching this flick, you have great self thought control. Politics aside, this movie is not bad, though. I thought Jeff Bridges was likable and the rest of the cast did a better than decent job, acting. The writing, on the other hand, was at times ok, but at times a bit over the top (the final presidential speech, for example). If you sit on the left side of the isle, you will enjoy how conservative politicians are generally portrayed as hypocritical scum bags.

531331,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXP7,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Reviewers and audiences have been contentious about The Contender. Some have said that it has a liberal bias. Others have claimed that the events portrayed could never in today's Washington, DC. The ending has been criticized as unrealistic, although I saw it as merely hopeful. I say The Contender is only a movie and is meant to reflect, not to mirror exactly, real life. I think it is the best political thriller in many years.The time is the not so distant future. It has been three weeks since the Vice President of the United States died of natural causes. President Jackson Evans [Jeff Bridges] is being pressured to pick a replacement. Evans is a liberal with a year and a half left to serve. Naturally, he wants to nominate someone he can work with, but there are also the needs of the powerful political right to consider. One major contender is the Governor of Virginia, Jack Hathaway [William L. Petersen], who recently made headlines for attempting to save a young woman whose car plummeted into a lake in which he was fishing. Senator Laine Hanson [Joan Allen] turns out to be the other likely candidate and soon becomes the front-runner in the eyes of the President. He likes her, and he thinks having a woman in the job will add to his legacy. There are several things about Hanson that bother the opposition, not the least of which is the fact that she is a woman. When information is magically unearthed about a sexual encounter Hanson had in college, the fireworks begin. What follows is a story about more than a struggle for power in the most powerful city on Earth. It is a story about keeping one's dignity in a time when the intimate [and often irrelevant] details of one's life are aired in public by petty people in power. It is also one about the importance of sticking to one's principals, even when those principals become inconvenient.As Senator Hanson, Joan Allen gives a riveting performance that rightfully has gained her a nomination for Best Actress. I have rarely seen a portrayal this good concerning what it is like to be a powerful woman in a world that is still dominated by men. To the movie's credit, Hanson is a character who likes men and is quite comfortable in their presence. Her husband, for example, is her lover, her best friend and her greatest political ally. She fits in more easily around the President than do most of the males who work with him. Hanson believes that, while there are sometimes differences in the way men and women think and act, there should never be a situation in which the rules that apply to men are applied differently to women. This is only one of her beliefs that riles her opposition,As great as Allen is in The Contender, the spotlight is shared equally by Jeff Bridges, one of our most shamefully underrated actors. His President Evans is smart, shrewd and cunning. Evans is an essentially good man, but it is clear that in any political situation, it is best not to be his enemy. Only someone as brilliant as Bridges could make the character so believable.If you decide to see The Contender, I beg you to put aside your political opinions for a couple of hours, if you can. Director and writer Rod Lurie is an admitted liberal, and some of the issues he addresses, such as abortion, are political hot potatoes. Consider, though, that it would have been a less interesting movie if no controversial subjects had been brought up. Had Hanson and Evans been written as conservatives, the principals the movie examines would have been just as relevant. Sometimes it's refreshing to see a movie that sparks a lively debate with the person you see it with.",4,I really enjoyed this political thriller,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3633,"['Reviewers', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'contentious', 'Contender', 'have', 'said', 'liberal', 'bias', 'Others', 'have', 'claimed', 'events', 'portrayed', 'could', 'never', 'today', 'Washington', 'DC', 'ending', 'been', 'criticized', 'unrealistic', 'saw', 'merely', 'hopeful', 'say', 'Contender', 'only', 'movie', 'meant', 'reflect', 'not', 'mirror', 'exactly', 'real', 'life', 'think', 'best', 'political', 'thriller', 'many', 'years.The', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'future', 'been', 'three', 'weeks', 'Vice', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'President', 'Jackson', 'Evans', '[', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', ']', 'being', 'pressured', 'pick', 'replacement', 'Evans', 'liberal', 'year', 'half', 'left', 'serve', 'Naturally', 'nominate', 'someone', 'can', 'work', 'are', 'also', 'needs', 'powerful', 'political', 'right', 'consider', 'One', 'major', 'contender', 'Governor', 'Virginia', 'Jack', 'Hathaway', '[', 'William', 'L.', 'Petersen', ']', 'who', 'recently', 'made', 'headlines', 'attempting', 'save', 'young', 'woman', 'car', 'plummeted', 'lake', 'was', 'fishing', 'Senator', 'Laine', 'Hanson', '[', 'Joan', 'Allen', ']', 'out', 'be', 'other', 'likely', 'candidate', 'soon', 'front-runner', 'eyes', 'President', 'having', 'woman', 'job', 'will', 'add', 'legacy', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'Hanson', 'bother', 'opposition', 'not', 'least', 'fact', 'woman', 'When', 'information', 'magically', 'unearthed', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Hanson', 'had', 'college', 'fireworks', 'begin', 'What', 'story', 'more', 'struggle', 'power', 'most', 'powerful', 'city', 'Earth', 'story', 'keeping', 'one', 'dignity', 'time', 'when', 'intimate', '[', 'often', 'irrelevant', ']', 'details', 'one', 'life', 'are', 'aired', 'public', 'petty', 'people', 'power', 'also', 'one', 'importance', 'sticking', 'one', 'principals', 'even', 'when', 'principals', 'become', 'inconvenient.As', 'Senator', 'Hanson', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'riveting', 'performance', 'rightfully', 'gained', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'portrayal', 'good', 'concerning', 'what', 'be', 'powerful', 'woman', 'world', 'still', 'dominated', 'men', 'movie', 'credit', 'Hanson', 'character', 'who', 'men', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'presence', 'husband', 'example', 'lover', 'best', 'friend', 'greatest', 'political', 'ally', 'more', 'easily', 'President', 'do', 'most', 'males', 'who', 'work', 'Hanson', 'are', 'sometimes', 'differences', 'way', 'men', 'women', 'think', 'act', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'situation', 'rules', 'apply', 'men', 'are', 'applied', 'differently', 'women', 'only', 'one', 'beliefs', 'opposition', 'As', 'great', 'Allen', 'Contender', 'spotlight', 'shared', 'equally', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'one', 'most', 'shamefully', 'underrated', 'actors', 'President', 'Evans', 'smart', 'shrewd', 'cunning', 'Evans', 'essentially', 'good', 'man', 'clear', 'political', 'situation', 'best', 'not', 'be', 'enemy', 'Only', 'someone', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Bridges', 'could', 'make', 'character', 'so', 'believable.If', 'decide', 'see', 'Contender', 'beg', 'put', 'aside', 'political', 'opinions', 'couple', 'hours', 'can', 'Director', 'writer', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'admitted', 'liberal', 'issues', 'such', 'abortion', 'are', 'political', 'hot', 'potatoes', 'Consider', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'interesting', 'movie', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'Had', 'Hanson', 'Evans', 'been', 'written', 'conservatives', 'principals', 'movie', 'examines', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'relevant', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'lively', 'debate', 'person', 'see']",N/A

It's as if the filmmakers and producers all spent their money to create a controlled, political world which was more to their liking than the messy real one (sort of like the West Wing). In Hollywood Productions, the liberals are straight, true and lovable (not to mention beautiful) and all conservatives are physically unattractive, gnarled of soul, and driven by repression and paranoia. Liberals get the beautiful lighting, good camera angles, and heart-swelling music: conservatives get the dark corners, single-note-drone soundtrack to indicate evil, and the camera either stuck up their noses or centering down on (of course) bulging, nervous eyes. Joan Allen is cast as Joan of Ark. Noble as all hell. All the time. Gary Oldman is cast as Rumplestiltskin, a bitter, twisted Midwesterner (again, of course). In case we don't naturally dislike this character on your own, the filmmakers trot out his wife, who hates him intensely for his hounding of the films' saint, Joan Allen. The plot, simply, is that up-and-comer Allen has her political wagon derailed by allegations that she was part of multi-partnered sex party in college that got filmed. What to do?  Her best political counsel decides the best move is to face the thing head on. Come clean, you might say. But Allen, as Joan of Ark, says no. Her answer is to stand in front of the cameras with perfect voice and, as the music swells and the flashes pop, to give one of the most jarringly adolescent speeches in pretend American political history. Miss noble stoops to inform the press that all this is far beneath her dignity. Her private life will remain that, PRIVATE. I mean, really. Do liberal filmmakers forget this very line was attempted by another philander, Gary Hart, and he got pounded into oblivion for his efforts, literally laughed off the political stage? The reason, in the real world, why Bill Clinton didn't take this line is that, well, he is a very smart man that lives in the real world. A poorly done, liberal sounding board at best; a badly written and directed movie at worst. The worst of it was (don't read any further if you haven't seen the film) it turns out it was a case of mistaken identity, a conservative set up, so Joan is pure as the driven snow, AND she refuses to discuss it on principal. In other words, the filmmakers have their cake and eat it, too.

The most important factor in one's ideology and voting pattern is their political party, not their sex.  Remarkably, this movie gives the impression that Republicans are intolerant of women in positions of power based on their past sexual transgressions.  This is untrue.  How else can one explain the number of women in George Bush's cabinet, including Condelizza Rice, Elaine Chao (Secretary of Labor), Karen Hughes (former counselor to the president), etcetera.However, I also do not believe an opposition party would actually, in reality, cause this much of a stir over a Vice Presidential appointee.  First of all, Vice Presidents are part of the president's cabinet, and few opposition senators are likely to oppose them.  After all, the president has a right -- usually thought -- to choose who shall serve in his administration.  The Vice President, of all cabinet posts, is usually selected by the president during his campaign for office, and no senator can stop him from choosing a person since the election for president and vice president happen simultaneously.  In this instance, the senate must approve, but given that it usually has no shot at debating this, one would think that the Senate ought to back off and let the president choose his VP.

She would thus make history as the first woman to hold the office.

Joan Allen is fiery and determined as the prospective vice president. I especially liked Jeff Bridges as the president: his performance is deliciously sly. Director/scripter Lurie has written some stirring pieces of oratory which the cast delivers with vigor.But the film is unsatisfying in some respects. Gary Oldman's character, despite the actor's talent, comes across as a shallow stereotype. I'm not sure if Oldman was let down by the script, by the editing room, or both.

Likewise, if you are a conservative you probably enjoy listening to Rush Limbaugh (Nothing wrong with that, either), but you shouldn't think you're hearing a serious journalist.I know that virtually no film is 100% down the middle (wherever the middle may actually be), and I can enjoy films that are somewhat biased either right or left.  However, this film goes so far over the top in its depiction of conservatives and Republicans that it loses any credibility, just as a film that constantly bashes liberals and Democrats must be viewed in the same light.

She engaged in a sex party in one of the fraternities when she was at Harvard.Joan Allen, a dignified, regal lady if there ever was one in all the roles she chooses, is the shamed candidate brought before the committees to defend her moral character.  It was just a coincidence that this movie came out when Monica Lewinsky was fresh on our minds, and not a coincidence that it was a gender role reversal.

More like a platform from which to present an ideological creed rather than explore the repercussions of the explosive issues it so readily tackles, this movie fails to deliver. Its story falls flat as a pancake on a pan of hot issues and doesn't even make a sizzle.

Also on hand are Sam Elliot, Christian Slater, and William Petersen in terrific supporting roles.The DVD contains lots of extras including commentary with writer/director Rod Lurie, and actress Joan Allen, as well as many deleted scenes.&quot;The Contender&quot; is one of the best films of the year, and a MUST own for thriller fans.Nick Gonnella",5,EXPLOSIVE!!!,983664000,"03 4, 2001",2001,1419,"['vice', 'president', 'dead', 'president', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'getting', 'ready', 'make', 'choice', 'replacement.Senator', 'Laine', 'Hanson', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'role', 'written', 'especially', 'nominated', 'choice', 'making', 'first', 'woman', 'history', 'hold', 'office.Hidden', 'agenda', 'explode', 'president', 'rival', 'Shelly', 'Runyon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'stop', 'nothing', 'keep', 'Laine', 'office.', 'quot', 'Contender', 'quot', 'riveting', 'thriller', 'lies', 'manipulation', 'used', 'game', 'politcs', 'first', 'frame', 'are', 'glued', 'seat', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'trust', 'what', 'lie', 'will', 'surface', 'next', 'plot', 'twist', 'exposing', 'one', 'shock', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'entertained', 'movie', 'powerful', 'satisfying', 'ending.Joan', 'Allen', 'excellent', 'senator', 'screen', 'intense', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'years', 'president', 'Jackson', 'Evans', 'man', 'own', 'agenda', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'magnificent', 'usual', 'bad', 'guy', 'Shelly', 'Runyon', 'Also', 'hand', 'are', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'William', 'Petersen', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'DVD', 'lots', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes.', 'quot', 'Contender', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'MUST', 'own', 'thriller', 'fans.Nick', 'Gonnella']",N/A

A far better vehicle for her is &quot;The Crucible&quot; but I suppose she was tempted by the starring role presented here. This film tries to impress us by revealing how politics works &quot;from the inside.&quot; Instead, we're left with the indelible impression of a film-maker trying to dazzle us with sophistication but instead falling flat on his face with boring, set-piece scenes and a listless, unbelievable script. The musical score tries to bolster things by setting a &quot;serious&quot; tone but you end up cringing at this nonsense. The very idea of portraying an avowed pro-choice atheist - who would remove &quot;every gun from every home in America&quot; - as being considered for vice-president reveals a profound disconnect with reality. How could anyone, even slightly acquainted with modern American politics, take this nonsense seriously? From watching The Contender, someone from Mars could easily conclude that those holding the harnesses of power in America are either sexually obsessed, morally detestible religious hypocrites or truly righteous, wonderfully kind, morally upright atheists. There is very little shading between these totally absurd extremes. The comic relief (e.g. the President's penchant for ordering custom made snacks from the White House Chef) is mildly amusing but mainly reminds us of the banality of the script. Couldn't the President have been portrayed, at least once, as concerned about something other than (a) partisan political maneuvering, or (b) what his next meal will be? Obviously, the film-maker's model for the President was the loathesome Clinton. The goal, I believe, was to show what a jocular, &quot;regular&quot; guy the President (i.e. Clinton) really is (was). The unintended achievement of this ridiculous, hackneyed film, however, is to remind us all how tragically frivolous American politics became under Clinton, a condition which inevitably led to the profound grieving playing out in endless funerals, processions, and memorial services now taking place in New York City.",2,Sad Reminder of How We Got Here,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,2154,"[""'m"", 'BIG', 'fan', 'Joan', 'Allen', ""'m"", 'appalled', 'let', 'be', 'cast', 'remarkably', 'inane', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'vehicle', 'quot', 'Crucible', 'quot', 'suppose', 'was', 'tempted', 'starring', 'role', 'presented', 'here', 'film', 'impress', 'revealing', 'how', 'politics', 'quot', 'inside.', 'quot', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', 'indelible', 'impression', 'film-maker', 'trying', 'dazzle', 'sophistication', 'instead', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'boring', 'set-piece', 'scenes', 'listless', 'unbelievable', 'script', 'musical', 'score', 'tries', 'bolster', 'things', 'setting', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'tone', 'end', 'up', 'cringing', 'nonsense', 'very', 'idea', 'portraying', 'avowed', 'pro-choice', 'atheist', 'who', 'would', 'remove', 'quot', 'gun', 'home', 'America', 'quot', 'being', 'considered', 'vice-president', 'reveals', 'profound', 'disconnect', 'reality', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'even', 'slightly', 'acquainted', 'modern', 'American', 'politics', 'take', 'nonsense', 'seriously', 'watching', 'Contender', 'someone', 'Mars', 'could', 'easily', 'conclude', 'holding', 'harnesses', 'power', 'America', 'are', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'morally', 'detestible', 'religious', 'hypocrites', 'truly', 'righteous', 'wonderfully', 'kind', 'morally', 'upright', 'atheists', 'very', 'little', 'shading', 'totally', 'absurd', 'extremes', 'comic', 'relief', 'e.g', 'President', 'penchant', 'ordering', 'custom', 'made', 'snacks', 'White', 'House', 'Chef', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'mainly', 'banality', 'script', 'Could', ""n't"", 'President', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'least', 'once', 'concerned', 'something', 'other', 'partisan', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'b', 'what', 'next', 'meal', 'will', 'be', 'Obviously', 'film-maker', 'model', 'President', 'was', 'loathesome', 'Clinton', 'goal', 'believe', 'was', 'show', 'what', 'jocular', 'quot', 'regular', 'quot', 'President', 'i.e', 'Clinton', 'really', 'was', 'unintended', 'achievement', 'ridiculous', 'hackneyed', 'film', 'however', 'remind', 'how', 'tragically', 'frivolous', 'American', 'politics', 'became', 'Clinton', 'condition', 'inevitably', 'led', 'profound', 'grieving', 'playing', 'out', 'endless', 'funerals', 'processions', 'memorial', 'services', 'now', 'taking', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A

531354,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXP7,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","Writer/director Rod Lurie's ""The Contender"" marks a significant advance in both technique and storytelling ability for this fledgling filmmaker over his sole previous cinematic effort, ""Deterrence.""  This former L.A. film critic-turned-filmmaker has created a crackerjack political thriller attuned to the temper of its times.  In this era in which one politician after another has fallen victim to the cutthroat ""politics of personal destruction"" as practiced in the media, in the committee hearing room and in the backrooms of campaign headquarters around the nation, ""The Contender"" emerges as a timely, astute and politically savvy drama.Like most contemporary films that deal with political issues, ""The Contender"" demonstrates an obvious left leaning bias.  As usual, it is the Democrats who are portrayed as the righteous speakers of truth and the Republicans who are shown as the scheming, unctuous and conniving dispensers of hatred and rumormongering.  Jeff Bridges stars as President Jackson Evans, a well-meaning, seemingly moral man who, upon the sudden death of his vice president, nominates a woman, Senator Laine Hanson, to be his replacement.  Gary Oldman plays the Republican chairman who will stop at nothing in his efforts to torpedo the nomination, even if that means exposing her rather torrid sexual past for all the world to see (although, in many ways, his obsession with ruining the chances of a candidate he feels to be less qualified in favor of one who is more beloved as a national figure makes little practical sense because wouldn't he, as a member of the rival party, be MORE inclined to support someone he thought would bring trouble to the present administration?)If you can see past the partisan propaganda, you will find ""The Contender"" to be one of the most riveting films of the past several years.  In many ways, it reminds one of those Biblical spectaculars that moviemakers like Cecil B. DeMille used to churn out in the 1950's, the ones that would allow us to wallow in the depiction of all sorts of ""sinful"" activities, yet when the divine judgments began to fall on the perpetrators, permit us to feel morally superior to it all at the same time.  In a similar way, ""The Contender,"" may come out foursquare against the obsession we seem to have concerning the sex lives of our elected officials - but it sure has a fun time devoting two solid hours to the topic.  And its fun is ours.One of the reasons that ""The Contender"" succeeds so well is because Laine Hanson, as portrayed by the brilliant Joan Allen, is an endlessly fascinating and enigmatic character.  We never know quite what to make of her and it is this sense of moral imbalance that draws us in to her plight.  Had she been made an innocent victim or a goody-two-shoes, she would quickly lose our interest.  As the President, seemingly more concerned with ordering up spectacular dishes from the White House kitchen than with the pressing concerns of affairs of state, Jeff Bridges cuts just as believable and compelling a figure.As with virtually all films of a political nature, the characters' actions are occasionally inexplicable within the context of practical politics.  For example, President Evans rejects one of his top candidates for the VP position for ludicrous reasons.  When Governor Jack Hathaway attempts but fails to rescue a woman from her vehicle that has crashed to the bottom of a river, Evans tells Hathaway that he believes the Republicans will try to bring up parallels to Chappaquiddick in an attempt to sink his nomination.  Not only is that a patently absurd possibility, but Evans seems blithely unconcerned about the much worse drubbing he and his eventual nominee end up undergoing.  Which leads us to the next implausibility - Evans' sticking by Hanson far past the point where any real president would have asked for the candidate to withdraw her name.  Oh well, ""The Contender"" may not always ring true in its plotting, but it definitely gets the job done as a piece of titillating pulp drama.My only serious complaint with the film comes in its closing stretches.  Perhaps it is too much, in these days of mandatory happy endings and feel-good emotionalism, to expect the type of clear-eyed cynical conclusions we were treated to in movies like ""The Candidate"" or ""The Best Man,"" but the upbeat, fairy tale resolution here is unworthy of all the good stuff that has gone before it.  By climbing onto a soapbox and deigning to lecture to us all, Lurie cops out on both Hanson and the audience - striving for the type of phony inspirationalism that went out with ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" way back in the 1930's.  Such an obvious sop to the box office leaves us with a bit of a sour aftertaste after all is said and done.  (Also, Lurie needs to shed himself of the gimmick he seems to have latched onto in both his films thus far - that of the melodramatic ""surprise"" turnabout ending.  It didn't work in ""Deterrence"" and it doesn't work here).Yet, despite its sundry flaws, ""The Contender"" emerges as one of the most compelling and fast-moving two hours you are likely to see in a long time.  You may feel like taking a shower when it's all over (maybe that explains the need Lurie may have had in providing a ""moral bath"" in the last 15 minutes or so), but you will at least have had a great time getting dirty.",4,crackling political drama,995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,5360,"['Writer/director', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'Contender', 'significant', 'advance', 'technique', 'storytelling',

531355,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CXP7,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[11, 18]","Joan Allen plays Lainie Hanson, an Ohio senator picked to fill the office of Vice Presidency in this earnest but incredibly self-righteous and arguably hypocritical political thriller.  ""The Contender"" is a lot like the lighter ""American President"" without as many likeable characters, deleting the jokes and swapping political ambition for the romance of Michael Douglas and Annette Benning.  Otherwise, the film is the same, with a noble, intelligent and left-minded woman becoming something of a pawn between a similarly minded and somewhat arrogant President (Jeff Bridges) and an evil right-wing GOP warlord (Gary Oldman as the insidious Sheldon ""Shelly"" Runyan).  Though Hanson ultimately reveals solidly liberal positions in her obligatory closing speech, we're supposed to believe that she was once a rank-and-file Republican.  And despite how far left she's become, her positions are inexplicably the least of Runyan's concerns.  Instead, Hanson's sexual history takes the stage during confirmation hearings, and Joan Allen's character must fend charges of a shocking but years past college-party turned orgy.  As in ""American President"", our heroes suffer less from character assassination than from their own unwillingness to directly respond to it - it's beneath them.  ...that is until the last moment when Jeff Bridges addresses a joint-session of congress in much the same way that Douglas did at the end of ""American  President"".  The film ends with the expected standing ovation, and the evil Runyan slinks off into the shadows.  As always, the right isn't only evil, but cowardly.  Hanson on the other hand is consistently heroic, even when explaining how she ruined her campaign manager's marriage.  In another spot, Hanson picks up some dirt on her senatorial adversary, but refuses to wield it.As an alleged liberal, I still found this flick impossible.  It's incredible that as accomplished a politician Runayn is, that he'd allow himself to get suckered into a character debate, no matter how apparently pious he is.  (the characters are fully aware of the Lewinsky scandal, yet allow themselves to fall into the same quagmire.)  We're supposed to decry how debate over character swamps over more important issues - like crime, health care and foreign relations - yet the sexual controversy of the film saves Allen from having to stand by her views, which are pretty controversial.  (The 1st amendment was always meant to protect the state from religion, and never the other way around; guns should be taken from every home, but the specter of a police state overstepping constitutional freedoms to get them is ignored; the US should use its military power to stamp out global genocide, or right through might).  No matter where you would stand on those views, you'd have to agree that they deserve more time than the lurid pseudo-issues dredged up here.  That the script holds you at all is because of the stars, especially Oldman.  I guess this film would play interestingly back-to-back with ""Advise and Consent"", the film based on the Drury novel.  Both films represent polar opposites on politics, and yet have received a fair amount of credit for an even-handedness on issues that they neither deserve.",1,"self-righteous film, and people call me a liberal!",1005004800,"11 6, 2001",2001,3231,"['Joan', 'Allen', 'Lainie', 'Hanson', 'Ohio', 'senator', 'picked', 'fill', 'office', 'Vice', 'Presidency', 'earnest', 'incredibly', 'self-righteous', 'arguably', 'hypocritical', 'political', 'thriller', 'Contender', 'lot', 'lighter', 'American', 'President', 'many', 'likeable', 'characters', 'deleting', 'jokes', 'swapping', 'political', 'ambition', 'romance', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'same', 'noble', 'intelligent', 'left-minded', 'woman', 'becoming', 'something', 'pawn', 'similarly', 'minded', 'somewhat', 'arrogant', 'President', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'evil', 'right-wing', 'GOP', 'warlord', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'insidious', 'Sheldon', 'Shelly', 'Runyan', 'Hanson', 'ultimately', 'solidly', 'liberal', 'positions', 'obligatory', 'closing', 'speech', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'was', 'once', 'rank-and-file', 'Republican', 'how', 'far', 'left', 'become', 'positions', 'are', 'inexplicably', 'least', 'Runyan', 'concerns', 'Instead', 'Hanson', 'sexual', 'history', 'stage', 'confirmation', 'hearings', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'character', 'must', 'fend', 'charges', 'shocking', 'years', 'college-party', 'turned', 'orgy', 'American', 'President', 'heroes', 'suffer', 'less', 'character', 'assassination', 'own', 'unwillingness', 'directly', 'respond', 'beneath', 'last', 'moment', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'joint-session', 'congress', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Douglas', 'did', 'end', 'American', 'President', 'film', 'expected', 'standing', 'ovation', 'evil', 'Runyan', 'shadows', 'always', 'right', ""n't"", 'only', 'evil', 'cowardly', 'Hanson', 'other', 'hand', 'consistently', 'heroic', 'even', 'when', 'explaining', 'how', 'ruined', 'campaign', 'manager', 'marriage', 'spot', 'Hanson', 'up', 'dirt', 'senatorial', 'adversary', 'wield', 'it.As', 'alleged', 'liberal', 'still', 'found', 'flick', 'impossible', 'incredible', 'accomplished', 'politician', 'Runayn', ""'d"", 'allow', 'get', 'suckered', 'character', 'debate', 'matter', 'how', 'apparently', 'pious', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'Lewinsky', 'scandal', 'yet', 'allow', 'fall', 'same', 'quagmire', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'decry', 'how', 'debate', 'character', 'swamps', 'more', 'important', 'issues', 'crime', 'health', 'care', 'foreign', 'relations', 'yet', 'sexual', 'controversy', 'film', 'Allen', 'having', 'stand', 'views', 'are', 'pretty', 'controversial', '1st', 'amendment', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'protect', 'state', 'religion', 'never', 'other', 'way', 'guns', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'home', 'specter', 'police', 'state', 'overstepping', 'constitutional', 'freedoms', 'get', 'ignored', 'US', 'should', 'use', 'military', 'power', 'stamp', 'out', 'global', 'genocide', 'right', 'might', 'No', 'matter', 'where', 'would', 'stand', 'views', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'deserve', 'more', 'time', 'lurid', 'pseudo-issues', 'dredged', 'up', 'here', 'script', 'stars', 'especially', 'Oldman', 'guess', 'film', 'would', 'play', 'interestingly', 'back-to-back', 'Advise', 'Consent', 'film', 'based', 'Drury', 'novel', 'films', 'represent', 'polar', 'opposites', 'politics', 'yet', 'have', 'received', 'fair', 'amount', 'credit', 'even-handedness', 'issues', 'deserve']",N/A

However, it's Bridges' role as the President of the United States -- with his jovial and everyman demeanour on the surface and a cold, calculating cunningness beneath -- that quietly elevates the film to another level, because Bridges defines that essence which separates us ordinary folks in the audience from successful politicians and awe-inspiring leaders.  The backroom machinations of big-time politics were a thrill to watch, even if they were not always completely believable.  The final plot twist involving Governor Hathaway was one turn too many and really, no successful politician would even believe for a second he/she could get away with such a high profile ruse.

The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it isn't *Battlefield Earth*.  That said, this old-hollywood melodrama is as cheerless as it is dumb.  What's so frustrating is that it might have been a much better movie, had it been written and directed by someone else.  Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman have all been in first rate pictures (JA: *Pleasantville*, *Nixon*, *Face Off*; JB: *The Big Lebowski*, *Fearless*, GO: *Prick Up Your Ears*).  Ditto the supporting cast, including Phillip Baker Hall, Christian Slater, Sam Elliot and, yup, Mariel Hemmingway.  So what happened?*The Contender* is at its worst when it is most solemn and self-contratulatory, as in the tortured moment when the candidate sums up to the committee why she ought to be Vice President. Or when Christian Slater's youthful congressman Webster moves lugubriously around a room in the White House looking at oil paintings, respectively, of Wilson, Lincoln, JFK, and Truman.  This takes up about 5 minutes of film in a 93 minute movie.  Or Jeff Bridges's bloviated President Evans offering Slater sage advice on political savvy and a shark-steak sandwich.  ""Webster, do you have a dictionary?"" (this is an actual line).  I could go on, but I'll spare you.Bridges and Slater are terrible.  Sam Elliot too.  Not because they have no talent, but because they do and it is sooooo wasted on this crummy script.  Phillip Baker Hall's character appears in one scene that appears to be an important plot moment, but that is dropped without explanation, so I'm sure he hopes no one will remember.  The best bit is Mariel Hemmingway's walk-on scene as one of Joan Allen's victims.  (Well, not Joan's victims, but her character's.)

It does not take a highly liberal position, but it is not conservative. The film's message is that the right's overarching investigations into Clinton's sex life were intrusive, although it does not examine the fact that his lies came under legal oath.The V.P. dies and a woman Senator is nominated to replace him. A rumor circulates that while in college she was gangbanged by a fraternity. She refuses to answer the allegations. A conservative Senator (Gary Oldham, who is actually conservative and later expressed dismay at script changes to make conservatives look worse than originally planned), opposes her because of her alleged youthful promiscuity. He is also in league with another Senator who he wants to get the nod. The President (Jeff Bridges) sticks by the nominee and after a few twists and turns she gets in. The charges are never publicly refuted, which is the film's message. She reveals privately that the gangbang story was false, and the moral is that politician's personal lives are not open season for the press. This resonates to an extent, but the timing of the film, in light of the Clinton scandals, makes it obvious that the purpose is to dissuade the public that Clinton's immorality is our business.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM",3,"""CONTENDER"" TRIES TO PUT DOWN CLINTON INVESTIGATION",1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1401,"['Contender', 'was', 'made', 'former', 'West', 'Point', 'guy', 'who', 'liberal', 'rarity', 'not', 'take', 'highly', 'liberal', 'position', 'not', 'conservative', 'film', 'message', 'right', 'overarching', 'investigations', 'Clinton', 'sex', 'life', 'were', 'intrusive', 'not', 'examine', 'fact', 'lies', 'came', 'legal', 'oath.The', 'V.P', 'dies', 'woman', 'Senator', 'nominated', 'replace', 'rumor', 'college', 'was', 'gangbanged', 'fraternity', 'answer', 'allegations', 'conservative', 'Senator', 'Gary', 'Oldham', 'who', 'actually', 'conservative', 'later', 'expressed', 'dismay', 'script', 'changes', 'make', 'conservatives', 'look', 'worse', 'originally', 'planned', 'alleged', 'youthful', 'promiscuity', 'also', 'league', 'Senator', 'who', 'get', 'nod', 'President', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'sticks', 'nominee', 'few', 'twists', 'charges', 'are', 'never', 'publicly', 'refuted', 'film', 'message', 'privately', 'gangbang', 'story', 'was', 'false', 'moral', 'politician', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'open', 'season', 'press', 'extent', 'timing', 'film', 'light', 'Clinton', 'scandals', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'dissuade', 'public', 'Clinton', 'immorality', 'business.STEVEN', 'TRAVERSAUTHOR', 'BARRY', 'BONDS', 'BASEBALL', 'SUPERMAN', 'STWRITES', '@', 'AOL.COM']",N/A

The President, looking to appoint a new vice president, picks a nominee that just about no one is happy with.  Off and running are the internal politics, deals, schleps, and sleaziness.  The opposition digs up some pretty nasty past sexual material on the nominee, which she refuses to defend, citing that in any case it's ""nobody's business"".That story line, along with great acting, and some pretty awesome cinematography will keep you intrigued and entertained.  The only complaint about this movie, before the final fifteen minutes, is a somewhat cheap portrayal of liberals as being ultra-moral and conservatives as being dishonest and nutty.  Unfortunately in the final fifteen minutes, the nominee's ridiculous political speech about what she does and does not stand for (yes to killing the unborn, no to killing convicted murderers), an equally ridiculous speech by the president that accuses anyone of not supporting his nominee of being unpatriotic, and finally her revelation that she was not guilty of the sexual acts that she was accused of (which ends her moral high ground of ""it's nobody's business"") all coincide in the last fifteen minutes to throw cheesiness all over a fairly polished movie.  It's a true shame.I can't really decide whether to recommend this movie to others or not.

The underhandedness of Gary Oldman is utterly believable of one whose goal is to win rather than be right, and the ambition of what's his name (the guy who tried to save the drowning girl) is completely plausible.  However, this movie still rates as many 1 stars as 5 stars, because people disagree with the politics.  So much so, that they are willing to cheat to lower the ratings of this movie, much like the chief villain in this movie (many of the one star votes, say, 30% are repeated comments, word for word).

531370,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,B00003CXP7,thecableguy,"[0, 1]","""The Contender"" is about as fair and balanced as a debate between Ann Coulter and a cactus. That's not a problem, though, the film presents itself as fiction. Sort of. I get irritated when the reviews on the box proclaim it as one of the most important films I'll ever see, because ""The Contender"" is little more than a bunch of adults playing ""I Know You Are But What am I?"" It's an entertaining game to watch, but hardly raises the bar for American cinema or political debate.The Vice President has died, and Democratic President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges from ""Tucker: the Man and His Dream"") has to pick a successor. He doesn't get his first choice, Governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen from ""CSI""), because while fishing Hathaway failed to save a girl from drowning after she'd driven her car off a nearby bridge. The President doesn't want ""another Chappaquiddick,"" so he opts for Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen from ""The Upside of Anger"").Representative Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman as Zorg from ""The Fifth Element"") doesn't like Senator Hanson because she used to be a Republican, and is rumored to have had sex and enjoyed it. It's a sloppy performance -- aside from a brief ""remember when you were nice"" scene between the Rep and his wife, Oldman gives no compassion or other trace of humanity -- he may as well have pasted a bulls-eye on his forehead and worn an ""I'm Evil"" t-shirt. He's too talented an actor to turn Runyon into a caricature. He's also one of the film's producers, so maybe that has something to do with it.Runyon antagonizes and interrogates Hanson about her enjoying sex and other hot-button political issues, like abortion and abortion, and whether or not she's pro-life. Hanson and the President never stoop to Runyon's level -- they stoically resist his muckraking with patriotic, you-would-have-to-be-insane-to-believe-this-guy rhetoric; composer Larry Groupe backs them up with heavy music swells.Do you remember Christian Slater (from ""Heathers"")? He's in this movie, too. He's Representative Reginald Webster, the nice, new Republican on the block. He spends most of the film quietly second-guessing Runyon. Neither of them get any music swells.""The Contender"" isn't a bad movie. For the most part I enjoyed it on a base level, like watching a two hour cockfight. The problem I have is that it's too clumsy to be a balancing act, and winds up being as pushy and preachy as the person the protagonist loathes. Check out Aaron Eckhart's tobacco lobbyist in ""Thank You for Smoking"" for a good example of injecting humanity into a person typically hated. Or, for something similar to ""The Contender"" check out Jill Clayburgh and Walter Matthau in the 1981 comedy ""First Monday in October,"" a fictionalized account of the appointment of the first female Supreme Court Justice. ""First Monday"" is an intelligently written battle of the sexes comedy where, unlike ""The Contender,"" the two parties realize one requires the other to exist.",3,"Thank you for not smoking, not that it's any of my business",1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2974,"['Contender', 'about', 'fair', 'balanced', 'debate', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'cactus', 'not', 'problem', 'though', 'film', 'fiction', 'Sort', 'get', 'irritated', 'when', 'reviews', 'box', 'proclaim', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'Contender', 'little', 'more', 'bunch', 'adults', 'playing', 'Know', 'Are', 'What', 'am', 'entertaining', 'game', 'watch', 'hardly', 'bar', 'American', 'cinema', 'political', 'debate.The', 'Vice', 'President', 'died', 'Democratic', 'President', 'Jackson', 'Evans', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Tucker', 'Man', 'Dream', 'pick', 'successor', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'choice', 'Governor', 'Jack', 'Hathaway', 'William', 'Petersen', 'CSI', 'fishing', 'Hathaway', 'failed', 'save', 'girl', 'drowning', ""'d"", 'driven', 'car', 'nearby', 'bridge', 'President', ""n't"", 'want', 'Chappaquiddick', 'Senator', 'Laine', 'Hanson', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Upside', 'Anger', '.Representative', 'Sheldon', 'Runyon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Zorg', 'Fifth', 'Element', ""n't"", 'like', 'Senator', 'Hanson', 'used', 'be', 'Republican', 'rumored', 'have', 'had', 'sex', 'enjoyed', 'sloppy', 'performance', 'aside', 'brief', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'nice', 'scene', 'Rep', 'wife', 'Oldman', 'compassion', 'other', 'trace', 'humanity', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'pasted', 'bulls-eye', 'forehead', 'worn', ""'m"", 'Evil', 't-shirt', 'too', 'talented', 'actor', 'turn', 'Runyon', 'caricature', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'producers', 'so', 'maybe', 'something', 'do', 'it.Runyon', 'antagonizes', 'interrogates', 'Hanson', 'enjoying', 'sex', 'other', 'hot-button', 'political', 'issues', 'abortion', 'abortion', 'not', 'pro-life', 'Hanson', 'President', 'never', 'stoop', 'Runyon', 'level', 'stoically', 'resist', 'muckraking', 'patriotic', 'you-would-have-to-be-insane-to-believe-this-guy', 'rhetoric', 'composer', 'Larry', 'Groupe', 'up', 'heavy', 'music', 'swells.Do', 'remember', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Heathers', 'movie', 'too', 'Representative', 'Reginald', 'Webster', 'nice', 'new', 'Republican', 'block', 'most', 'film', 'quietly', 'second-guessing', 'Runyon', 'Neither', 'get', 'music', 'swells', 'Contender', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'base', 'level', 'watching', 'two', 'hour', 'cockfight', 'problem', 'have', 'too', 'clumsy', 'be', 'balancing', 'act', 'up', 'being', 'pushy', 'preachy', 'person', 'protagonist', 'loathes', 'Check', 'out', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'tobacco', 'lobbyist', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'good', 'example', 'injecting', 'humanity', 'person', 'typically', 'hated', 'something', 'similar', 'Contender', 'check', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'Walter', 'Matthau', '1981', 'comedy', 'First', 'Monday', 'October', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'appointment', 'first', 'female', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Justice', 'First', 'Monday', 'intelligently', 'written', 'battle', 'sexes', 'comedy', 'where', 'Contender', 'two', 'parties', 'realize', 'one', 'other', 'exist']",N/A

That my in-laws might not like the language used, well, I'm sorry, but that's  life.And as to ""shallow,"" I agree that's an adequate description for the short-lived television series by the same writer, Commander in Chief. But I liked this script, found it a classic.The film starts with a governor, apparent vice president candidate, a position the country had apparently been without for a few weeks. A car flies off a bridge and the governor who was fishing under the bridge tries to help the car's driver. Unfortunately, the driver dies. Then, onto the president's (Jeff Bridges) office. He can't offer the governor the vice presidency.The president eventually chooses a woman senator, portrayed by Joan Allen.The presiden't rival in the prior election was Sheldon Runyon, masterfully portrayed by Gary Oldman, who was also the exec. producer of the film. Runyon is rurthless in his pursuit of dirt on Senator Hanson (Allen).I won't re-cover what other reviewers have doubtless said many times. But what I found moving about the script was that Hanson, while she knew it would be to her advantage, refused to indulge in the same tactics used by Runyon and his lieutenants.There are, of course, feminists who will say that ""That's the way it would be if there were a woman candidate."" Notwithstanding Senator Clinton's record as being pretty strong-willed herself, my objection to such an assertion is that beyond doubt the worst boss I ever had was a woman. So I know what women are capable of. The point is that CANDIDATE wouldn't settle for those completely unethical tactics.Would that happen in real life? I doubt it. The present day public relations/image production apparatus probably wouldn't even allow a ""cripple"" (FDR) to be elected president. And we all recall the Kerry campaign in '04. I guess Kerry's handlers felt that Kerry would be beyond responding to the Swift Boat thugs. So he came across looking like a con artist who used his clout to get military honors, or a candidate who didn't have the guts to confront those who smeared him. So, no, I don't think Senator Hanson would get confirmed by the Senate today. But one can dream.Back to the actors, I thought Jeff Bridges as the president was a president I could believe in. There was a down-to-earth nature about him, despite his obvious intelligence, that I appreciated. And Christian Slater played Reggie Webster, a freshman Delaware congressman who was trying to get on Runyon's right side, then saw that Runyon's tactics were not his cup of tea.Overall the story, while idealistic, was a good one.

The whole cast does a nice job, kudos to Jeff Bridges for playing a president who despite having a foul mouth, very much gets his lines out without missing a beat-honestly, I've never seen a presidential figure played like this before.I also agree with Joan in the fact that she won't adress the accusations, one way or the other, very different than Bill Clinton-who did a much better job as president despite his infidelities, why couldn't they leave him alone with that?I've always believed any celebrities personal life is just that, no one else's business, but between the tabloids and the paparazzi-which in my opinion abuse their freedom) someone's personal life is always made public and it shouldn't be like that, same goes for politics, in my opinion.

531379,A8KQFDL7D81KR,B00003CXP7,Trevor James,"[4, 12]","The Contender is arguably the best political drama since All The Presidents Men, and rightly so.  Joan Allen portrays female vice presidential candidate Laine Hanson who is the target of a ploy unleashed by Supreme Court judge Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman).  Shelly Runyon does all that he can to destroy Laine Hanson's reputation by bringing forward a steamy story of her sexual past.  The Contender is directed by the relatively unknown, Rod Lurie, who also writes the screenplay.  Lurie claims to have a fascination with political thrillers.  And his knowledge of this genre helped him resurrect the popularity of the political thriller.  The screenplay tackles taboo issues and gives viewers a very realistic glimpse of the game of political chess.  The Contender makes for one of the best movies of the year, if not one of the best in the past twenty years.  With more than a handful of controversy and ideas conflicting tradition, stars Gary Oldman, Joan Allen, and Jeff Bridges are given plenty to work with as each of them plays a Washington notable.  The high points in the film are the acting of course, the Oscar nominations for `Best Supporting Actor' for Jeff Bridges' portrayal of the U.S. president.  And another for `Best Actress' for Joan Allen who gives a riveting performance in her role as the targeted political successor to the throne of vice president of the United States.  The acting is well rounded, and Gary Oldman's character gives the movie the perfect `bad guy'.  And Christian Slater brings a character to life that you just want to strangle the duration of the movie.  All these elements mixed in with the most controversial topic addressed in American cinema in recent years all emulate one of the best films of 2000.

This movie tried to be a throw back to the political thrillers of 1940s and 1950s Hollywood when they made them right, but fails because the producers and director obviously never watched any of the classics for pointers.

531387,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00003CXP7,wellwellwell,"[0, 2]","Even though `The Contender' can be considered a take-off of the infamous Clinton scandal, there's many things that make it likeable; even for people who don`t appreciate politics.  Although you probably won't recognize most of the actors, the cast in its entirety is excellent.  With Jeff Bridges, Joan Allen and Christian Slater, the movie does offer some familiar faces.  But in my opinion, the show is simply stolen by Gary Oldman.  This is the first role I've ever seen him in; and it has since spawned my looking into his others.  Oldman is portrayed as the bad guy here (which makes him hard to like), but he does an excellent job.  There's also a good appearance by Sam Elliott, who co-starred with Bridges in `The Big Lebowski'.  He's a little rough around the edges, but his appearance still compliments the film.  And once you get past the extraordinary cast, there is actually a good movie.Joan Allen, the lone female present, has pretty much the starring role.  Women in politics is a touchy subject with many people; and this movie can certainly offend either way.  Allen (as Senator Laine Hanson) is selected to be the vice president of Bridges' character (known as the infamous ""Mr. President"").  The fact that she'd be the first woman ever in office turns a lot of heads and explodes into mass hysteria.  The film is a very good look at the corrupt side of politics; as Oldman (playing Rep. Shelly Runyon) and co. dig up whatever they can, truthful or not, about Senator Hanson.  That's where the title comes in.  The Senator is in fact a contender, as she fights off everything they throw at her.  The quote that Jeff Bridges uses (`they caught you being a human') sums it up perfectly; as things that seem morally wrong for politicians are acceptable for regular citizens.  The movie never really deals with the real aspects of political affairs.  It's only personal; which is what makes it watch-able for anyone not privy to political affairs.  A hidden treasure within the film is its subtle comedy.  Jeff Bridges provides most of the laughs; as he has an ongoing joke to see if his cooks will ever be out of some rare, unheard-of ingredient.  I particularly loved the part with the shark-steak sandwich.  I won't spoil the rest for you.  Also, the part when he cites his bowling average as 150 is great; though much more hilarious if you saw `The Big Lebowski'.  The greatest, and funniest quote of the movie comes from Joan Allen.  When compared to Clinton, she says `...[he's] not guilty, but responsible'.  That'll obviously bring out a laugh for everyone.The film does have a weird, slow start; but it picks up as it goes on.  `The Contender' is said to be a thriller, though nothing is really that thrilling.  It may be hard to enjoy for people who are expecting action or in-depth drama.  There is a continuing battle between the sides (good and bad), and nothing really unique takes shape.  Until the end.  I don't like to spoil movie endings or say too much about a movie; and I won't do that here.  I only gave this film 3 stars because it is very hard to ""get into"" what's happening.  But the acting is more than superb; mainly by Joan Allen.  I wouldn't say she is perfect, but she's not far from it.  The fact that she keeps things very personal makes her hard to figure out; which was intended, I`m sure.  Nevertheless, it's an excellent performance.  The slow start certainly knocks it down one star, and the ""Mr. President"" clich&eacute; is something we've seen far too many times.  The ending makes up for a lot though, and without it I would've gave the film only two stars.  But I do highly recommend `The Contender' to anyone.  As I've said, you don't have to be partial to politics in order to enjoy the film.

Lighten up, people!  It's just a movie!If I remember correctly, this was Joan Allen's first leading role (or at least her first one in a long time), and she does a marvelous job, and deservedly deserves her Best Actress Oscar nomination (this was the year Julia Roberts won, by the way).  ALL of the performances are first-rate in this one, especially Jeff Bridges as Mr. President (who's somehow witty AND decisive at the same time), as well as the ingenious screenplay and direction.Although I DO understand why this movie received the negative critical reviews it did (not counting Amazon reviews), I definitely think it should have received a little more love once Oscar time rolled around back in 2000.It's currently July, 2005 ... any other Joan Allen fans out there?  Any Academy members reading this right now?
