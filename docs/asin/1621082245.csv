195143,A2817AWABAP3RC,1621082245,"Anonymous ""JaneJane""","[0, 0]","My 9 year old daughter cried and laughted and made some profound statements about the value of having parents, good friends, compassion and love. What more can you want from a movie? She thanked me for her Christmas gifts, and understood that there are things more important in life. Maybe next year I can try to gift her only an orange? LOL, that would be great! This movie is a Christmas gem.  Yes it is sad and it is not for younger than 8. (Spoiler:At least two important characters die.) But the ""feel good"" scenes prevail, and the message is loud and clear. It is similar to the Secret Garden, Little Princess, Anne of GG and other orphan stories. There is nothing scary, just sad.  The ending is satisfying although not expected. I appreciated them not making it all wrapped up with the bow at the end.  Enjoy!!!

Christmas Oranges is a triumph and were this largely a theatrical film, there would be Academy Award nominations in a number of categories.  Leading would be Nancy Stafford who has already done Oscar and Emmy type work in the past and there definitely needs to be equal awards in recognition for this kind of work.  The writing was crisp, photography beautifully done and everything about it spells a Christmas Classic.  I have been a film and TV buff for over 70 years, have even used both as a classroom teacher and feel confident that Christmas Oranges will become a Holiday tradition.  I won't be a spoiler about the plot, a lot of information is out already.  I will just say don't waste any more time reading this, get the film.

The motherly caretaker, widow Mrs. Hartley, takes Rose in to the orphanage and raises her, along with the other children of the orphanage, as if they were her own. The children enjoy a loving environment and all is well until the unspeakable happens.Rose is then transferred to Irongates Orphanage, a place opposite in every way from the Greenwoods Orphanage. Under cruel Mr. Crampton&#8217;s direction, the children at Irongates are under strict rule with no love and very little attention.Rose is immediately grateful for the new friends she finds at Irongates, as well as, Mr. Crampton&#8217;s kind brother Joe, and Polly, the cook. She hears of the stories of what happens on Christmas &#8211; the only day Mr. Crampton allows the children to have any fun. It&#8217;s on that special day that Joe brings each child an orange &#8211; oranges he has hung on the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve. Rose finds it difficult to wait for Christmas Day.Along the way, Rose encounters difficulties at every turn with Mr. Crampton. When she discovers he harbors a secret, will her gentle spirit sway him to realize the mistakes he&#8217;s made and that it&#8217;s never too late to start anew?Christmas Oranges has quickly become one of my favorite films. Delightful, heartwarming, and humorous in parts, I was thrilled to have stumbled upon it. Christmas Oranges is not a Christian film, but it does have some wonderful lessons for discussion. For example: love despite biological ties, loyalty, friendship, forgiveness, grace, and serving others. There is nothing objectionable in this movie.But I will give you one word of caution: you may need a Kleenex.
