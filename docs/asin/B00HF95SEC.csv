Once I started watching it I realized that this was the first Israeli horror movie that I had come across. As a zombie horror movie it was somewhat typical of the genre with some pretty good action sequences! On another level this movie was totally fascinating for the portrayal of Israeli racial mores and attitudes and they didn't pull any punches. The interaction among the Israeli spec ops squad and how they talked about each other was more than a little interesting. Oddly it reminded me of my days in Bosnia when I went out with an Englishman, Welshman and an Irishman! The way they talked about and to each other was exactly the same. Anyone who thinks America has the market cornered on racism is mistaken. Again, as a zombie horror movie it's decent enough with good action what makes it really good is the interaction of the squad who is on the mission. You want to learn about another culture, check this one out!",3,Steve's Review,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1024,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'kind', 'caught', 'eye', 'Once', 'started', 'watching', 'realized', 'was', 'first', 'Israeli', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'come', 'across', 'zombie', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'typical', 'genre', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'level', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'Israeli', 'racial', 'mores', 'attitudes', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'interaction', 'Israeli', 'spec', 'ops', 'squad', 'how', 'talked', 'other', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'interesting', 'Oddly', 'reminded', 'days', 'Bosnia', 'when', 'went', 'out', 'Englishman', 'Welshman', 'Irishman', 'way', 'talked', 'about', 'other', 'was', 'exactly', 'same', 'Anyone', 'who', 'America', 'market', 'cornered', 'racism', 'mistaken', 'Again', 'zombie', 'horror', 'movie', 'decent', 'enough', 'good', 'action', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'interaction', 'squad', 'who', 'mission', 'want', 'learn', 'culture', 'check', 'one', 'out']",Battle of the Undead

Acting wasn't bad, though I did catch some dubbing. It didn't lack in action and lots of gore. But zombie movies are still about the same.
