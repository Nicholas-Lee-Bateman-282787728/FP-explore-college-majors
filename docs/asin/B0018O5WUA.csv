It teaches life lessons as well as features songs and activities.  No, don't use this to teach your kids Mandarin Chinese; there're few Chinese words.  But that's the whole point... it's a general-audience show for all preschoolers, and it does a great job at that.  The characters are loveable -- and easier on the eye.  The young actress who does Kai-lan's voice does a superb job -- she's my second favorite Nick Jr. voice actor, after the SpongeBob guy. :)  This DVD features 4 episodes, as well as a ""My Favorite Places"" music video.  The video is in 4:3 format, just like it is on regular TV.",5,A fun and educational show for preschoolers,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,682,"['really', 'good', 'show', 'preschoolers', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'life', 'lessons', 'as', 'well', 'features', 'songs', 'activities', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'teach', 'kids', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', ""'re"", 'few', 'Chinese', 'words', 'whole', 'point', 'general-audience', 'show', 'preschoolers', 'great', 'job', 'characters', 'are', 'loveable', 'easier', 'eye', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'Kai-lan', 'voice', 'superb', 'job', 'second', 'favorite', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'voice', 'actor', 'SpongeBob', 'guy', 'DVD', '4', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'Favorite', 'Places', 'music', 'video', 'video', '4:3', 'format', 'just', 'regular', 'TV']","Ni Hao, Kai-Lan: Super Special Days"

1160550,A3R1VUH9MIOE5N,B0018O5WUA,LB,"[3, 6]","This is just a Chinese-American version of Dora.  It's about as Chinese as I am (white Caucasian).  It reflects the low extent that Chinese-American kids are exposed to real Chinese culture (dragon boat festival, Chinese new year, red envelopes, dumplings etc. i.e. stuff that most non-Chinese people already know about anyways).  Your kid will hardly learn any Chinese language from these videos. That being said, the cartoon is well done, and very entertaining, very much in the style of Dora the Explorer, so you will get your money's worth if that is your goal.  However, if your goal is to teach your kids real Chinese language and culture, get some other video instead (e.g. Journey to the East), or go on a trip to China.  The good thing about this video is it really gets the kids hooked for hours, so you can have them glued on to TV while you do other stuff.  (Is that a good thing?  If they are to be glued for hours, I'd rather have them learn useful things, which isn't really the case here...)As a side note, in reply to M Chung's review below: our daughter has also been influenced by Rintoo's bad behavior.  I don't quite know why.  This bad behavior isn't present in Dora the Explorer.  The only bad character there is Swiper, but he rarely appears, and when he does, it is only for a short time, and they always deal with him swiftly.  You also see bad characters in Disney cartoons (e.g. Wile E Coyote), but those aren't problematic either.  Maybe the problem with Rintoo is that he isn't sidelined and marginalized (like Wile E Coyote is - because he's so ridiculous), but instead integrated?  I don't know.  But here, it does have a somewhat negative impact on our kid.  Luckily, she stopped watching Ni Hao Kai Lan and is instead learning real languages from other DVDs.  It's likely that this is an isolated even and your kid may not have this problem with acting like Rintoo.  I was surprised to see that myself.",2,Chinese-American Dora,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,1936,"['just', 'Chinese-American', 'version', 'Dora', 'about', 'as', 'Chinese', 'am', 'white', 'Caucasian', 'low', 'extent', 'Chinese-American', 'kids', 'are', 'exposed', 'real', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'dragon', 'boat', 'festival', 'Chinese', 'new', 'year', 'red', 'envelopes', 'dumplings', 'etc', 'i.e', 'stuff', 'most', 'non-Chinese', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'anyways', 'kid', 'will', 'hardly', 'learn', 'Chinese', 'language', 'videos', 'being', 'said', 'cartoon', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'goal', 'However', 'goal', 'teach', 'kids', 'real', 'Chinese', 'language', 'culture', 'get', 'other', 'video', 'instead', 'e.g', 'Journey', 'East', 'go', 'trip', 'China', 'good', 'thing', 'video', 'really', 'kids', 'hooked', 'hours', 'can', 'have', 'glued', 'TV', 'do', 'other', 'stuff', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'be', 'glued', 'hours', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'learn', 'useful', 'things', ""n't"", 'really', 'case', 'here', 'side', 'note', 'reply', 'M', 'Chung', 'review', 'daughter', 'also', 'been', 'influenced', 'Rintoo', 'bad', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'bad', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'present', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'only', 'bad', 'character', 'Swiper', 'rarely', 'when', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'always', 'deal', 'swiftly', 'also', 'see', 'bad', 'characters', 'Disney', 'cartoons', 'e.g', 'Wile', 'E', 'Coyote', 'are', ""n't"", 'problematic', 'either', 'Maybe', 'problem', 'Rintoo', ""n't"", 'sidelined', 'marginalized', 'Wile', 'E', 'Coyote', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'instead', 'integrated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'here', 'have', 'somewhat', 'negative', 'impact', 'kid', 'Luckily', 'stopped', 'watching', 'Ni', 'Hao', 'Kai', 'Lan', 'instead', 'learning', 'real', 'languages', 'other', 'DVDs', 'likely', 'isolated', 'even', 'kid', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'acting', 'Rintoo', 'was', 'surprised', 'see']","Ni Hao, Kai-Lan: Super Special Days"
