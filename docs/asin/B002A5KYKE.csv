Plot was thin and predictable.  Even poor movie for glenn ford and he usually gave a good performance.

I also enjoyed watching an ageless Rita Hayworth and Ricardo Montalban, Ford's detective partner.

I have seen all of Rita and Glenn's movies' dialogue between the two is interesting specially when she said "" You should have married me "" On second thought perhaps it would have been good if they married, this would have given credibility for the chemistry they have on the screen and avoided the string of divorces that happened.",5,The Money Trap,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,387,"['more', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'movie', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'have', 'seen', 'Rita', 'Glenn', 'movies', 'dialogue', 'two', 'interesting', 'specially', 'when', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'married', 'second', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'married', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'credibility', 'chemistry', 'have', 'screen', 'avoided', 'string', 'divorces', 'happened']",The Money Trap
