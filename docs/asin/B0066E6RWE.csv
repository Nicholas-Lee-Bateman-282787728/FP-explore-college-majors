1511017,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0066E6RWE,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH (1968) was the first-ever TV mini-series, running 6 hours over three consecutive nights. Shortened by a half, it exists now only as a theatrical release. Lost in the process are many interviews of partcipants, witnesses and victims of the 12 year horror that was Nazi Germany.The book's author, William L. Shirer appears twice. Stock footage, particularly of Post-WWI Germany is of great interest. Excerpts of several Hitler speeches are seen and heard, but translations are few and subtitles non-existent. Clearly intentional, for this is no unbiased work. At times the outrage and seething hatred for Der Fuhrer is so obvious you can touch it. Narrative insults are employed (not that the bastid didn't deserve 'em!). In its present form,  ""Rise and Fall"" is a fast-moving story consisting  primarily of contemporary war and other footage.A David L. Wolper production for MGM, directed by Jack Kaufman, written by Alan Landsburg.

The topic involved The Habsburg Monarchy.Historically The Habsburg Monarchy  from 1804-1867  was formally unified as the Austrian Empire and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.The former Chancellor chided perhaps the viewer mostly whereby there was a rediculous idea that the history of the Chancellors own country was not relevant in his discussion with Adolf Hitler.The undisclosed information is that Adolf Hitler in &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; discusses at length Vienna,Austria(A City of Races)(A City with the magic of mediocrity).Adolf Hitler says much about the House of  Habsburg and about the Habsburg Monarchy.Austria was  at one time a weakened state to Germany with the Triparte Pact(that is Adolf Hitlers opinion expressed in Mein Kampf).There is so much information that is not provided that it was that that made me truthfully consider if in fact this was worth viewing.Perhaps it was not worth viewing.I do not know much of anything if the sum of that knowledge was to be provided merely by this particular viewing experience.There is just much to much information that is not present whereby we as a viewer are not an informed consideration.I do not want to do the work that was the responsibility of the film to provide.I wish perhaps to suggest that there are better informed presentations that would most certainly not be reserved in their desire to provide something more truthful.I feel this film is lacking in candor perhaps in a greater reservation it is not truthful.",2,An Expressed Reservation,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2124,"['question', 'are', 'asked', 'consider', 'wheather', 'particular', 'film', 'worth', ""viewing.I'am"", 'not', 'certain', 'real', 'value', 'derived', 'watching', '34', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Third', 'Reich', '34', '.This', '3', 'Part', 'presentation', 'more', 'merely', 'judgemental', 'so', 'extent', 'lack', 'cognitive', 'presence', 'attempt', 'judge.A', 'particular', 'instance', 'example', 'when', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'preparing', 'take', 'over', 'Austria.The', 'Former', 'Austrian', 'Chancellor', 'Kurt', 'Schuschnigg', 'interviewed.He', 'remarks', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'broached', 'topic', 'when', 'discussion', 'Austrian', 'Chancellor', 'topic', 'involved', 'Habsburg', 'Monarchy.Historically', 'Habsburg', 'Monarchy', '1804-1867', 'was', 'formally', 'unified', 'Austrian', 'Empire', '1867', '1918', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'Empire.The', 'former', 'Chancellor', 'chided', 'perhaps', 'viewer', 'mostly', 'whereby', 'was', 'rediculous', 'idea', 'history', 'Chancellors', 'own', 'country', 'was', 'not', 'relevant', 'discussion', 'Adolf', 'Hitler.The', 'undisclosed', 'information', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', '34', 'Mein', 'Kampf', '34', 'discusses', 'length', 'Vienna', 'Austria', 'A', 'City', 'Races', 'City', 'magic', 'mediocrity', '.Adolf', 'Hitler', 'much', 'House', 'Habsburg', 'Habsburg', 'Monarchy.Austria', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'weakened', 'state', 'Germany', 'Triparte', 'Pact', 'Adolf', 'Hitlers', 'opinion', 'expressed', 'Mein', 'Kampf', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'not', 'provided', 'was', 'made', 'truthfully', 'consider', 'fact', 'was', 'worth', 'viewing.Perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'viewing.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'anything', 'sum', 'knowledge', 'was', 'be', 'provided', 'merely', 'particular', 'viewing', 'just', 'much', 'much', 'information', 'not', 'present', 'whereby', 'viewer', 'are', 'not', 'informed', 'consideration.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'work', 'was', 'responsibility', 'film', 'provide.I', 'wish', 'perhaps', 'suggest', 'are', 'better', 'informed', 'presentations', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'reserved', 'desire', 'provide', 'something', 'more', 'truthful.I', 'feel', 'film', 'lacking', 'candor', 'perhaps', 'greater', 'reservation', 'not', 'truthful']",The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich

1511020,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B0066E6RWE,EPA316,"[5, 5]","Finally, the DVD edition of the superb version of the TNT special that was aired in the early 90s. I did video tape it at the time, but the tape bit the dust a decade ago. This is what I consider to be the granddaddy of the WWII documentaries. Everything about it is outstanding: the narration, the music, the editing. In particular, the music does an excellent job of getting the intended emotion across. I also like the interviews of actual participants scattered throughout. We see former world leaders recounting their experiences, what they felt and what they were thinking, and we also see middle-aged former Nazis repeating their justifications for voting for Hitler and ushering in the Nazi party. We also see interviews with Holocaust survivors regarding their experiences. To me, this DVD was worth every penny. It's head and shoulders above some of the modern ""exploitation"" knock-off DVDs that are in the $5 bargain bin today.One minor note is that this DVD must be played on a dedicated DVD player. I have a DVD recorder/player, and it won't work on this. It also won't work on some computers. This is a security measure, I suppose, to prevent bootlegging. So you have to have a DVD play-only machine to view this.
