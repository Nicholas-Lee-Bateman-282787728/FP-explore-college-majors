The only quibbles I have with the documentary is that it is a patchwork affair, no real time spent on any particular snippet, it being a collection of short moments rather than a whole accounting, and that it is a bit difficult to know where you are in the sequence of this eleven year period as it continually jumps back and forth in the timeline in an almost random way.  That said, Patti herself narrates and you get generous amounts of her poetry and her personal life as well as concert footage and displays of her unique imagination and heartfelt beliefs.  It defintely adds some depth in understanding the artist, the mother, the daughter, the loyal friend and the fierce observer.",4,Rock music and poetry's wonderful caretaker,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,904,"['great', 'sampling', 'moments', 'roughly', 'eleven', 'years', 'Patti', 'life', 'musical', 'explorations', 'really', ""'ll"", 'chuckle', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'admire', 'influences', 'see', 'rock', 'industry', 'only', 'quibbles', 'have', 'documentary', 'patchwork', 'affair', 'real', 'time', 'spent', 'particular', 'snippet', 'being', 'collection', 'short', 'moments', 'rather', 'whole', 'accounting', 'bit', 'difficult', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'sequence', 'eleven', 'year', 'period', 'continually', 'back', 'forth', 'timeline', 'almost', 'random', 'way', 'said', 'Patti', 'narrates', 'get', 'generous', 'amounts', 'poetry', 'personal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'concert', 'footage', 'displays', 'unique', 'imagination', 'heartfelt', 'beliefs', 'defintely', 'depth', 'understanding', 'artist', 'mother', 'daughter', 'loyal', 'friend', 'fierce', 'observer']",Dream of Life

Three months later I find myself still watching it, looking for things I didn't notice before.  This woman is the real thing, her early days at NYC's CBGB's, the retirement with Fred Sonic Smith, her children, the loss of family friends and her resurgence in 1996 with Gone Again.This film was insightful to both Patti Smith fans and also managed to recruit new ones as well.  I love when she's on the couch with her parents and her mother requests songs. The deleted scenes are gems and the interview with Jackson Smith, son and heir to the legacies of both Patti as well as the late Fred Sonic Smith.  Jackson not only sounds like his mother but his face bares a nod to his father as well. The same can be said for Jesse. It's classic to see her playing piano with the keys pounding out her mother's 1975 classic birdland.Watch it, you'll enjoy every bit of this film.",5,"A treasure trove of images, sounds and details from the first woman of Punk.",1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,1031,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'was', '15', 'seeing', 'twice', 'concert', 'jumped', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'wait', 'was', 'released', 'dvd', 'Three', 'months', 'later', 'find', 'still', 'watching', 'looking', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'before', 'woman', 'real', 'thing', 'early', 'days', 'NYC', 'CBGB', 'retirement', 'Fred', 'Sonic', 'Smith', 'children', 'loss', 'family', 'friends', 'resurgence', '1996', 'Gone', 'Again.This', 'film', 'was', 'insightful', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'fans', 'also', 'managed', 'recruit', 'new', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'when', 'couch', 'parents', 'mother', 'requests', 'songs', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'gems', 'interview', 'Jackson', 'Smith', 'son', 'heir', 'legacies', 'Patti', 'as', 'well', 'late', 'Fred', 'Sonic', 'Smith', 'Jackson', 'not', 'only', 'mother', 'face', 'nod', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Jesse', 'classic', 'see', 'playing', 'piano', 'keys', 'pounding', 'out', 'mother', '1975', 'classic', 'birdland.Watch', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'bit', 'film']",Dream of Life
1188329,A31V1QWRV8PTU0,B001FACHBO,"Katherine McCarthy ""kath e. miller""","[7, 8]","I love Patti Smith - in all her mediums - and have followed her career from the very early '70's when I saw a TV special on WOR in New York City one Sunday night. She was describing the graffiti on subway cars (rampant at the time) like a new age Jackson Pollack. I was in High School, struggling to be a writer. I was captivated. I immediately sought out her poetry. She wasn't in rock band. She was writing about rock in Creem magazine, and doing animated poetry readings like Rock 'n' Rimbaud at a former Welfare Hotel, the Diplomat, with the earliest drag queen performance artists. I followed her as she started to do poetry readings with Lenny Kaye strumming on guitar, then to Max's with the addition of Richard Sohl.I didn't get around to seeing this film at the Film Forum. My schedule was crazy. I knew in advance I would buy it on DVD. I'm glad I saw it by myself, at home, in control of my environment. It's a dreamscape, and aptly named. Don't bother watching if you don't have the time or the attention span. This is detail work. Patti's life and commentary is like a tapestry, weaving in and out of remembrances. Tread by thread. Thought by thought.Patti is a lovable raconteur. In the early days, she would often stop her shows to tell a bad joke. Like a kid. Then proceed to sing as if possessed. She still does. The film takes its time to weave in her remembrances - the beloved husband and father taken too soon; her parents, working class, and loving, with their aged dog; her ambition to get out of Jersey and into New York; art - in all forms - to embrace the word, the vision, the textures of paint, photography, song, three chord rock & roll. When the film breaks away from the reverie with glimpses of shamanistic performance it's jarring but riveting.Kudos, not only to the director,Stephen Sebring, filming over 11 years is worthy of an ""Atta boy!"" and probably hazard pay. Access to Patti throughout the years, and obvious trust instilled, elevates this film from documentary to art. Bravo! to co-producer Margaret Smilow, who spun all that footage into this beautiful, grainy, ethereal, imperfect montage. It sucks you in and keeps you, if you're willing to let it, and have the time to devote.I don't know if people who have heard about Patti Smith but don't really know her work would love this film as much as I did. But to me it's the essence of who she is, and how she sees this mortal coil. It's a wonder to see her children's growth, from baby pictures with Fred, to finding a bathroom for little Jesse, to the man and woman they are today. At one point, when I saw the adult Jackson Smith, I sat upright in my chair and said to myself, ""God he looks just like his father!"" Fred would be proud.To see her beautiful daughter riding in a Central Park carriage while her mom talked about ""She Walked Home"" written about Jackie Kennedy coming to grips with dying, with her departed husband singing the song in the background, the song Patti wrote but won't sing because Fred made it his own. I cried.Patti, Fred, Jackson, Jesse. Lenny & the band. Her mom and dad. I gave Patti a letter at a book signing. Her mom took the time to write back, and send an autographed, early 45 rpm record jacket. I was awestruck she took the time to respond and send such a lovely keepsake.

Lesson #1 is that when it comes to unusual subjects that nearly defy a category such as this one, it's wise to do some research. In the case of this documentary, in order to appreciate it you'd have to understand the circumstances in which it was made. When director Sebring approached Patti about the idea of making this film she wasn't sure if she liked the idea or even wanted it to happen. She also had no idea what the film was to be about. Mostly Sebring told her, he simply wanted to capture her life on film. Good, bad, happy, boring, funny, or what ever. Patti just thought, ""Well why not? it might be nice to have some moments of my life and the lives of my friends captured for posterity even if I am not completely comfortable with the idea."" The film was also made over the course of nearly 12 years, which makes the presence of a camera often a rather routine presence after a period of time. So what you get in the process is the real Patti. Sometimes boring, sometimes funny. sometimes even slightly egotistical. But also sad, humble, reflective, intense, emotional, ect. In other words, Patti Smith is, in many ways- just like you and I. She just happens to be a legend too. A writer, artist, poet, singer, activist. But above all she's a warmly genuine and often interesting human being. This film is a rare glimpse into the life of a woman I admire more than nearly any woman I can think of, except for perhaps my own mother of course :)",5,Getting inside Patti's mind....,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1676,"['One', 'thing', 'have', 'discovered', 'years', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'reviews', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'art', 'writing', 'fair', 'accurate', 'review', 'came', 'up', 'bit', 'arse', 'Lesson', '1', 'when', 'unusual', 'subjects', 'nearly', 'defy', 'category', 'such', 'one', 'wise', 'do', 'research', 'case', 'documentary', 'order', 'appreciate', ""'d"", 'have', 'understand', 'circumstances', 'was', 'made', 'When', 'director', 'Sebring', 'approached', 'Patti', 'idea', 'making', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'liked', 'idea', 'even', 'wanted', 'happen', 'also', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'about', 'Mostly', 'Sebring', 'told', 'simply', 'wanted', 'capture', 'life', 'film', 'Good', 'bad', 'happy', 'boring', 'funny', 'what', 'ever', 'Patti', 'just', 'thought', 'Well', 'why', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'moments', 'life', 'lives', 'friends', 'captured', 'posterity', 'even', 'am', 'not', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'course', 'nearly', '12', 'years', 'presence', 'camera', 'often', 'rather', 'routine', 'presence', 'period', 'time', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'process', 'real', 'Patti', 'Sometimes', 'boring', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'even', 'slightly', 'egotistical', 'also', 'sad', 'humble', 'reflective', 'intense', 'emotional', 'ect', 'other', 'words', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'many', 'ways-', 'just', 'just', 'be', 'legend', 'too', 'writer', 'artist', 'poet', 'singer', 'activist', 'warmly', 'genuine', 'often', 'interesting', 'human', 'being', 'film', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'life', 'woman', 'admire', 'more', 'nearly', 'woman', 'can', 'think', 'perhaps', 'own', 'mother', 'course']",Dream of Life
1188332,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B001FACHBO,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[2, 3]","Patti Smith has always been an astonishingly iconoclastic, performing and visual artist. She's always been the most influential woman, in the Punk rock world. She really helped kick-start this exciting new genre of music, when it was still just a fringe element of the rock scene, in the mid-70s.Patti also single-handedly crafted a bold new image, of the female rock performer during the 70s. She startled the rock world with her unapologetic, devil-may-care androgynous style. Patti was the first woman in rock, to completely eschew glamor. Her clothes and shoes that she wears, have always been scruffy and disheveled. Her hair is scraggly, and she has a long, homely face. She is the complete personification, of what Punk rock is all about-brash, gritty, daring, and wickedly avant-guard.This documentary highlights Patti's exceptional achievements as a visual artist, poet, and Punk rock icon. Her personal life is completely laid open for the viewer. Patti is shown at her childhood home in a humble working class neighborhood, visiting her parents. Patti's two children also appear in this film, and she shows how proud she is of her family. The viewer plainly realizes that instead of being a decadent rock star, Patti Smith is a warm, caring, and sharply intelligent human being.This film has an arty visual style, which dovetails perfectly, with Patti Smith's status as a dedicated artist and performer. At times, the film drags on a bit. And there's a morose quality, underlying the film too. This factor is brought on mainly by Patti's intense focus, on the deaths of her spouse Fred, brother Todd, and friend Robert Mapplethorpe. It was obviously cathartic for Patti to discuss the sense of anguish that she feels, about the deaths of those she cared deeply about. That in itself is positive, but it dominated the film a bit too much.For those who are not yet familiar with Patti Smith, seeing this film is a good way to acquaint yourself with her, and her legendary accomplishments as an artist/musician. Now in her early 60s, Patti Smith still reigns supreme, as the Godmother of Punk rock.",5,The Godmother of Punk rock.,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2106,"['Patti', 'Smith', 'always', 'been', 'astonishingly', 'iconoclastic', 'performing', 'visual', 'artist', 'always', 'been', 'most', 'influential', 'woman', 'Punk', 'rock', 'world', 'really', 'helped', 'kick-start', 'exciting', 'new', 'genre', 'music', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'fringe', 'element', 'rock', 'scene', 'mid-70s.Patti', 'also', 'single-handedly', 'crafted', 'bold', 'new', 'image', 'female', 'rock', 'performer', '70s', 'startled', 'rock', 'world', 'unapologetic', 'devil-may-care', 'androgynous', 'style', 'Patti', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'rock', 'completely', 'eschew', 'glamor', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'scruffy', 'disheveled', 'hair', 'scraggly', 'long', 'homely', 'face', 'complete', 'personification', 'what', 'Punk', 'rock', 'about-brash', 'gritty', 'daring', 'wickedly', 'avant-guard.This', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'Patti', 'exceptional', 'achievements', 'visual', 'artist', 'poet', 'Punk', 'rock', 'icon', 'personal', 'life', 'completely', 'laid', 'open', 'viewer', 'Patti', 'shown', 'childhood', 'home', 'humble', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'visiting', 'parents', 'Patti', 'two', 'children', 'also', 'appear', 'film', 'how', 'proud', 'family', 'viewer', 'plainly', 'instead', 'being', 'decadent', 'rock', 'star', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'warm', 'caring', 'sharply', 'intelligent', 'human', 'being.This', 'film', 'arty', 'visual', 'style', 'perfectly', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'status', 'dedicated', 'artist', 'performer', 'times', 'film', 'bit', 'morose', 'quality', 'underlying', 'film', 'too', 'factor', 'brought', 'mainly', 'Patti', 'intense', 'focus', 'deaths', 'spouse', 'Fred', 'brother', 'Todd', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Mapplethorpe', 'was', 'obviously', 'cathartic', 'Patti', 'discuss', 'sense', 'anguish', 'deaths', 'cared', 'deeply', 'about', 'positive', 'dominated', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'much.For', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'familiar', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'seeing', 'film', 'good', 'way', 'acquaint', 'legendary', 'accomplishments', 'artist/musician', 'Now', 'early', '60s', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'still', 'supreme', 'Godmother', 'Punk', 'rock']",Dream of Life

As background, I grew up w/ Patti Smith, bought Horses on vinyl from Korvettes immediately when it came out. Intuitively I knew this was something special. I even met Patti Smith back in 1975 or 76 at a rock and roll auction in Manhattan and talked to her personally (while wearing a Patti Smith t-shirt). I was surprised how petite and low key she was. That said, Patti turned a corner somewhere, or maybe it was me? I last saw her perform at the Beacon Theatre around 2009, and it was then that I realized we weren't on the same page anymore. During her set, Patti spent a lot of time talking about sitting by the phone waiting for her late husband to call after a gig. Fred had died, and it turned out to be Fred's birthday.  But this wasn't the Patti I grew up loving - I thought she was a feminist/punk icon. I didn't come to see her talking on end about her late husband, Fred Sonic Smith, and don't get me wrong.  I love me some MC5.  But how about playing some rock and roll honey?  Unfortunately, Patti was metaphorically wearing widow's weeds that night, so she and the band played NONE of her great songs.  What she did do was  cheat her audience.  On stage, Patti shared a lovely duet with her daughter Jesse, but her son was there on stage too, and his body language said he didn't want to be there!  Or maybe guys don't want to be on stage with their mothers?  Frankly, if you're a guy and play guitar, being on stage with your mother is akin to castration.  For what it's worth, that's my psychoanalysis.Onto this film - I found it really hard to stay with it. I admit it - I fast forwarded through huge stretches of this train wreck out of complete and utter boredom!  The filmmaker must have been in love with Patti because everything she does is presented as an act of grace. Watch Patti tie her shoes. Look at Patti's art work that actually resembles a cracked egg on a wall. Having been called a flake myself, I found it all too flakey!
