Once you've done that one a few times though you are ready for this one. I can see Brian does talk a little to much but once you do it a couple of times you could probably tune him out a little. I am really looking forward to doing these as I have tried others but didn't like that the poses weren't held for long enough.

I bought this DVD because it's a great deal--three workouts for one price.I watched the first yoga set, Energize, before I tried it.  While I was watching the moves, I kept thinking about how easy it looked and that I could definitely do that stuff.  Then I actually tried it.  And found out that I was totally wrong.  It's not easy, especially for one who has an extremely poor sense of balance.  Bryan puts you in a pose and has you hold it for what seems like forever, long enough that your legs and arms are crying from the contraction.  But it's worth it; I have more muscle tone in my arms and upper back since I started this.  I feel more relaxed and in tune that I ever did with the Firm and I actually look forward to working out again.For those people who gripe about Bryan talking the whole time through...the first time I did this DVD, I felt that the monologue was kind of cheesy and unnecessary.  But, I have come to realize that his voice really helps me get into that relaxation frame of mind, so I don't mind it anymore.I recommend this as a good intermediate level workout.  I was a beginner and could barely finish; the next day, I was extremely sore from the stretching and moving.

Yes, it appears to strive for glamor. Yes, Bryan Kest's attitude stands out. Yes, he does not stop talking (I actually think he was guiding but ok, I'll go with talking). In fact, my wife, the moment I began playing this DVD, said that Bryan Kest comes across as annoying and seems to be just so in love with himself.But I think this is all just a perception (which sometimes is everything). Here's what I noticed first about these yoga workouts (there are three of them: Energize, Tone, and Sweat). In the beginning, Bryan ALWAYS tells you several key rules in his workouts: breathing is important, ""there is no such thing as a perfect pose"", we are not trying to get anywhere, we are just trying to be in the present (or something like that). And when I hear this and I see how his students do things perfectly, I tell myself that with small steps I may be able to do the same poses, and perfectly, in the future. But I am not driving myself crazy about it.All three workouts are not for beginners and cover a lot of different poses. I am still trying to figure out the rationale behind naming the workouts because regardless which one I do, after them I feel energized, toned, and drop about a gallon of sweat.This DVD is one of my favorites and I get to appreciate it more with each workout.",5,One of the best Yoga workouts on the market.,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,1396,"['want', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'first', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'strive', 'glamor', 'Yes', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'attitude', 'out', 'Yes', 'not', 'stop', 'talking', 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'guiding', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'go', 'talking', 'fact', 'wife', 'moment', 'began', 'playing', 'DVD', 'said', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'annoying', 'be', 'just', 'so', 'love', 'himself.But', 'think', 'just', 'perception', 'sometimes', 'everything', 'Here', 'what', 'noticed', 'first', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'are', 'three', 'Energize', 'Tone', 'Sweat', 'beginning', 'Bryan', 'ALWAYS', 'several', 'key', 'rules', 'workouts', 'breathing', 'important', 'such', 'thing', 'perfect', 'pose', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'get', 'anywhere', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'present', 'something', 'when', 'hear', 'see', 'how', 'students', 'do', 'things', 'perfectly', 'tell', 'small', 'steps', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'same', 'poses', 'perfectly', 'future', 'am', 'not', 'driving', 'crazy', 'it.All', 'three', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'beginners', 'cover', 'lot', 'different', 'poses', 'am', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'rationale', 'naming', 'workouts', 'regardless', 'one', 'do', 'feel', 'energized', 'toned', 'drop', 'gallon', 'sweat.This', 'DVD', 'one', 'favorites', 'get', 'appreciate', 'more', 'workout']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

Kest is a fabulous instructor who narrates his class with a clean sense of timing and a knack for saying what the student needs to hear at the precise moment. If you are a total beginner, however, this may not be the best place to start, because all three sessions are fairly challenging, and the pace is too fast for somebody who is still learning the sequence of a vinyasa. For the intermediate student, however, I cannot recommend this instruction highly enough. The sequencing just ""feels right""; it flows naturally.

In addition to showing how his class is doing the poses, you also see shots of Bryan doing the poses himself.A number of people complain about Bryan's obvious penchance for talking. I love it though. First, most of what he says are encouragements. His workouts are not easy. So, his explanations and encouragement, especially during the difficult poses, actually help me to stay in there until the next pose. Second, if you listen to the essence of what he says, you will learn a lot about yoga. Third, I feel like I'm in one of his actual classes, rather than just watching him on video/DVD. Fourth, his talking wakes me up in the morning. What I like about him is that he neither talks down to nor talks over the heads of his audience.

She swore by it, said it was one of her all-time favorite yoga workouts...she wasn't kidding!This DVD has 3 different workouts, basically easy, medium and hard. Honestly though? The Easy is NOT all that easy. It's a tough workout, from start to finish, true to its name ""Power Yoga"".

I just began working on the second workout, and I LOVE it. It's probably my favorite of the three. I still can't quite do the third one, it's incredibly difficult.

He's your classic weight-lifting kind of person, and he thinks this is a great DVD. So it's certainly breaks the stereotype that yoga is only for females (although anyone who really does yoga knows that's a sillystereotype). This DVD kicks his butt everytime too!Also, I can't forget, Bryan is an excellent teacher! He teaches in a very calming manner, constantly reminding the student to focus on their breathing, that if you're breathing is stressed then you need to relax your muscles and face and let go. He also is consistently reminding us that everyone is at different levels and there is no such thing as a perfect pose. The things he discusses during the workouts are key to doing any yoga practice!Highly recommended, get it, keep it at the top of your pile of workout dvds, do it a few times a week and you won't regret it!",5,One of my all-time favorites,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1827,"['was', 'recommended', 'DVD', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'mid-90', 'swore', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'DVD', '3', 'different', 'workouts', 'basically', 'easy', 'medium', 'hard', 'Honestly', 'Easy', 'NOT', 'easy', 'tough', 'workout', 'start', 'finish', 'true', 'name', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'doing', 'first', 'workout', 'twice', 'week', 'last', '3', 'weeks', 'muscles', 'are', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'strong', 'firm', 'shaping', 'up', 'beautifully', 'just', 'began', 'working', 'second', 'workout', 'LOVE', 'probably', 'favorite', 'three', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'third', 'one', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'got', 'Crow', 'pose', 'immediately', 'went', 'back', 'second', 'workout', 'haha', 'However', 'keeping', 'up', 'have', 'dbout', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'third', 'workout', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'DVD', 'asks', 'do', 'frequently', 'week', 'classic', 'weight-lifting', 'kind', 'person', 'great', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'stereotype', 'yoga', 'only', 'females', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'yoga', 'sillystereotype', 'DVD', 'butt', 'everytime', 'too', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Bryan', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'very', 'calming', 'manner', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'student', 'focus', 'breathing', ""'re"", 'breathing', 'stressed', 'then', 'need', 'relax', 'muscles', 'face', 'let', 'go', 'also', 'consistently', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'different', 'levels', 'such', 'thing', 'perfect', 'pose', 'things', 'workouts', 'are', 'key', 'doing', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'get', 'keep', 'top', 'pile', 'workout', 'dvds', 'do', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

I was greatly disappointed when I actually tried this DVD.I tried both Level 2 & 3 practices, as I wanted to give it a fair shot, but I have to say I was tempted to just turn it off within 5 minutes of beginning it & several times thoughout. But, I stuck with it due to the rave reviews it has received.To be fair, the actual yoga practice is good - it's just too distracting to actually use this DVD due to the excessive talking/preaching from Bryan Kest about the wonders of yoga & the cheesy 80's filming. For me, simple is better when it comes to yoga DVDs - all I need is clear cues, a nicely structured routine, & an instructor to be able to quickly glace at when I need some guidance. Unfortunately, he talks literally NON-STOP the entire practice & it alternates between a classroom setting & ""artistic"" shots of him doing yoga. I would probably do this again & forgive the cheesy filming if it weren't for the talking. I buy fitness DVDs to do on a consistent basis & I don't know how anyone (no matter how much they enjoy the actual practice) can listen to him say the same thing everyday (let alone once through!).

And that's the overall feeling I have of the DVD, too busy, too much talking by Kest. He repeats several mantras, such as ""There's no perfect pose"" and ""It's not what you do, it's how you do what you do,"" to the point they become irritating.There's no question he knows what he's doing, and he demonstrates the poses nicely, though he doesn't do a very good job of showing alternates for those of us not as limber as his class members.

Burke,"[6, 6]","Over the years, I have attempted several times to learn yoga, and until this Brian Kest video, I couldn't figure out what the big deal was.When I do yoga, I want to feel as if I'm actually working out.  I want to feel muscle soreness for a day or two, so I know that I did something.  With this video, I do.I have tried a few basic videos and one class through community education, and those increased my flexibility and were very relaxing, but it didn't keep my interest because in my busy schedule I couldn't justify the time spent when all I did was stretch and breathe deeply.  Whereas even the beginner phase of the Brian Kest video makes me feel like I've done a workout, where I'm sore for a few days after, AND it still increased my flexiblity and relaxation.Yoga is one of those things where the better you get at it, the more you get a workout from it, at least in the beginning.  If you can't hold a position for very long, you're not going to get as much from it if you could hold it for a longer time. But that short amount of time does do something because the next time you try you can hold it a little bit longer, and go a little bit deeper.  Brian Kest is good at reminding you during the workout that it's okay if you can't hold the position, just respect where you are.

However, he is not the proverbial pretty face and hot bod--his program is envigorating and extremely satisfying.  His supple, taut and muscular body wonderfully advertises the obvious advantages of following his Power Yoga regime.  His program consists of a brief introduction where Kest emphasizes the importance of breathing properly and understanding that none of the poses that he demonstrates need be done with the exact accuracy of his team of on-tape students.  He stresses the need to let go of your pride and competitiveness and simply &quot;be&quot; in the pose and let your breath do the rest to relax and nurture you.  After some struggle with my own ego to let go, I found that it works.  I was able to stop thinking and just go with the flow of the music and the echo of deep breathing that acts like a metronome throughout the tapes.His base consists of repetitions of the sun salutation series, moving sinously from mountain pose through downward facing dog.  From this base he moves through the warrior series, and other poses which promote balance and strength.  I love relaxing into the 'corpse' pose at the end---feels so good, mentally and physically.I would not recommend this tape for anyone who does not regularly exercise.  This is not yoga for the faint of heart.  It is strenuous and I guarantee you will sweat more than you ever imagined.  For beginners, I would recommend something a little slower---maybe Jennifer Kries Method Yoga---  which goes through the actual poses with more detail and breaks the programs up into 3 separate workouts instead of the 50 minutes spent on a tape like Kests.  Once the poses are learned with a degree of accuracy, I think it would be appropriate to move into Kest's faster flowing repetitions.For anyone who does exercise regularly and wants to try something a little different--this series is great!",5,Stud Muffin Yoga Rules,1035331200,"10 23, 2002",2002,1974,"['jokingly', 'call', 'program', 'Muffin', 'Yoga', 'puzzle', 'why', 'Brian', 'Kest', 'wonderful', 'look', 'However', 'not', 'proverbial', 'pretty', 'face', 'hot', 'bod', 'program', 'envigorating', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'supple', 'taut', 'muscular', 'body', 'wonderfully', 'obvious', 'advantages', 'following', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'regime', 'program', 'brief', 'introduction', 'where', 'Kest', 'importance', 'breathing', 'properly', 'understanding', 'none', 'poses', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'exact', 'accuracy', 'team', 'on-tape', 'students', 'need', 'let', 'go', 'pride', 'competitiveness', 'simply', 'quot', 'be', 'quot', 'pose', 'let', 'breath', 'do', 'rest', 'relax', 'nurture', 'struggle', 'own', 'ego', 'let', 'go', 'found', 'was', 'able', 'stop', 'thinking', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'music', 'echo', 'deep', 'breathing', 'metronome', 'tapes.His', 'base', 'repetitions', 'sun', 'salutation', 'series', 'moving', 'sinously', 'mountain', 'pose', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'base', 'warrior', 'series', 'other', 'poses', 'promote', 'balance', 'strength', 'love', 'relaxing', ""'corpse"", 'pose', 'end', '-feels', 'so', 'good', 'mentally', 'physically.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'tape', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'regularly', 'exercise', 'not', 'yoga', 'faint', 'heart', 'strenuous', 'guarantee', 'will', 'sweat', 'more', 'ever', 'imagined', 'beginners', 'would', 'recommend', 'something', 'little', 'slower', '-maybe', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'Method', 'Yoga', 'actual', 'poses', 'more', 'detail', 'breaks', 'programs', 'up', '3', 'separate', 'workouts', 'instead', '50', 'minutes', 'spent', 'tape', 'Kests', 'poses', 'are', 'learned', 'degree', 'accuracy', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'move', 'Kest', 'faster', 'flowing', 'repetitions.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'exercise', 'regularly', 'try', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'series', 'great']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

I was totally creeped out by the way he touches (strokes more like) the students. 2. Video looks cheap in its visual quality. 3. Camera keeps moving in a very distracting, annoying manner (shots are often partial on the poses). But once I started doing the work out, those things just didn't matter anymore. First of all, when you're doing the poses, you just mostly listen and glance at the screen every now and then so you hardly see much of the creepy touching (lol). And what he says is extremely insightful, helpful, and encouraging while you are doing the poses. Honestly, I really get a great work out from this. I sweat, get a seriously deep strech, and I can feel my strength building. It's challenging and quite energizing. I would feel bored doing the same video everyday normally but not with this one. It flows quite nicely and the time flies. Lastly, this DVD is a great value! It has 3 individual work-outs to suit your level. I've been doing the first one and working my way up.

He is a master teacher who keeps the viewer calm and builds your esteem up with his constant words of praise and wisdom. Hearing Kest say ""If your doing the best you can, you're doing this class perfectly"" is exactly what I need to hear while doing my practice. Aside from his words of encouragement, Kest takes the viewer through a rigorous workout through each of his three programs. I am thoroughly drenched in sweat after any of the three programs on this DVD. The best part about this DVD is that it also calms the mind as well as strengthens the body. I have lost a considerable amount of weight since beginning this program (20 lbs) and feel great. Beginners may be overwhelmed at first, but give Kest some time and you will soon realize that you are listening to a master who will guide you to be the best yogi you can be. Some of the criticisms leveled towards this DVD are unwarranted. First, the way Kest positions or touches his students are to maximize the effect of the poses that they are demonstrating, any suggestions that he is groping his students are juvenile, immature and are simply missing Kest's greater message. Second, who cares what kind of accent the guy has or if he's wearing jeans...I mean can we be any more fickle? Overall, this is the best Yoga DVD on the market period, it grows with you and always allows you to take your practice to the next level.

Which some people may prefer.  The first work out is truely for beginers.  The second work out wasn't bad, but not as challenging as I'd hoped.  The third workout is challenging enough to form a sweat, but there isn't any variety.  I recomend going for a DVD that has both set work outs and a matrix so that you can talor your work out for your day.The part that annoys me is that it looks like it was filmed in the early/mid 90s.  Kest himself wears jeans (which doesn't seem right while teaching a yoga class).  One of the women in the video is wearing a thong leotard - that's just gross.  The filming technique is weird - the white balance seems to be off, or something is happening to make the people look fuzzy.  And the volume balance is off - there is a weird synthesized music that matches the volume of Kest's voice making it a little harder to hear him.  Lastly, he rarely uses either the English or Sanskrit names for the poses - that's just a personal peeve, but it is annoying to me.",3,Okay - not great.,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1302,"['First', 'let', 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'ability', 'wise', 'used', 'be', 'dancer', ""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'intermediate/advanced', 'level', 'about', '3', 'years.Now', 'DVD', 'other', 'power', 'yoga', 'classes', ""'ve"", 'taken', ""n't"", 'much', 'flow', 'be', 'more', 'Ashtanga', 'Vinyasa', 'Which', 'people', 'may', 'prefer', 'first', 'work', 'out', 'truely', 'beginers', 'second', 'work', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'as', 'challenging', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'third', 'workout', 'challenging', 'enough', 'form', 'sweat', ""n't"", 'variety', 'recomend', 'going', 'DVD', 'set', 'work', 'outs', 'matrix', 'can', 'talor', 'work', 'out', 'day.The', 'part', 'was', 'filmed', 'early/mid', '90s', 'Kest', 'wears', 'jeans', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'teaching', 'yoga', 'class', 'One', 'women', 'video', 'wearing', 'thong', 'leotard', 'just', 'gross', 'filming', 'technique', 'weird', 'white', 'balance', 'be', 'off', 'something', 'happening', 'make', 'people', 'look', 'fuzzy', 'volume', 'balance', 'weird', 'synthesized', 'music', 'volume', 'Kest', 'voice', 'making', 'little', 'harder', 'hear', 'Lastly', 'rarely', 'English', 'Sanskrit', 'names', 'poses', 'just', 'personal', 'peeve', 'annoying']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

I make the disclaimer that yoga is a personal choice.... some may want sedate, calming stretches while others may want to move, stretch and invigorate your body.  Bryan Kest is in the ""move, stretch and invigorate"" category.  This workout is not easy.  If you're a beginner, look elsewhere.ABOUT:  I think Bryan Kest Power Yoga borders on YIN yoga, but way less boring.  Bryan Kest holds the poses for a decent amount of time.  You will get a full body workout, feel relaxed, calm, invigorated AND stretched.  I don't know why, but it took the 2nd or 3rd time of doing one of the practices on the DVD for me to actually feel that way.  I think it was because I wasn't familiar with moves, flow, etc.  After learning the flow, I can honestly say each time I do a practice, my body feels 20 years younger.  I was in gymnastics as a teenager, and doing Bryan Kest gives me the same feeling as doing a gymnastics practice----supple, strong & alive.Music in each of the workouts is the same, just different flows/mixes.  I like the music a lot. It jives with the moves.  It's more Indian/Tribal..... lots of percussion.  Very calming. Of all yoga practices, I like Bryan Kest the best.  I also like (in no particular order) Janet Stone, Eionn Finn, and Travis Elliot (who happens to have worked in Kest's studio with a similar flair).  All give my body a feeling of suppleness & aliveness.I find this to be an excellent buy with 3 wonderful 50 minute practices.

I have been practising Ashtanga yoga in the past year with a qualified yoga personal trainer and finds Kest's collection to be the next best thing to having my PT around - the DVD offers well-structured and time-efficient sessions (50 minutes for what are essentially full-body workouts from intermediate-beginner to advanced). Definitely a must-have yoga DVD to supplement your workouts when you have no time to hit the gym or when your yogasana is closed for the holidays!For maximum benefit, I would highly recommend combining this DVD with Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti - while Kest's 1995 collection offers the intermediate-beginner substantial aerobics workout from his well structured vinyasa routines, Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti offers a matrix system where viewers can mix and match routines to the tune of their body/moods. Combining the two gives yogis the best of both worlds - strenuous workouts on perky days and less demanding yin yoga routines on ""moon"" days.PS Digressing but having tried and tested many yoga mats, the black sticky mats used in Kest's DVD are also the best (non-slip, sturdy and cushioned) mats aficionados should lay their hands on!",5,Best Power Yoga DVD To Own,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,1716,"['Bryan', 'Kest', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'two', 'best', 'home-use', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'marketplace.Not', 'only', 'were', 'Ashtanga-rooted', 'flow', 'sequences', 'vinyasa', 'well', 'instructed', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'student', 'Kest', 'prep', 'messages', 'were', 'inspirational', 'workouts', 'challenging', 'highly', 'motivational', 'even', 'fit', 'regular', 'yoga', 'many', 'dull', 'home-use', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'marketplace', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'workouts', 'were', 'choreographed', 'fashion', 'yoga', 'MTV', 'offseting', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bore', 'users', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'have', 'been', 'practising', 'Ashtanga', 'yoga', 'past', 'year', 'qualified', 'yoga', 'personal', 'trainer', 'Kest', 'collection', 'be', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'having', 'PT', 'DVD', 'well-structured', 'time-efficient', 'sessions', '50', 'minutes', 'what', 'are', 'essentially', 'full-body', 'workouts', 'intermediate-beginner', 'advanced', 'Definitely', 'must-have', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'workouts', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'hit', 'gym', 'when', 'yogasana', 'closed', 'holidays', 'maximum', 'benefit', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'combining', 'DVD', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'Kest', '1995', 'collection', 'intermediate-beginner', 'substantial', 'aerobics', 'well', 'structured', 'vinyasa', 'routines', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'matrix', 'system', 'where', 'viewers', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'routines', 'tune', 'body/moods', 'Combining', 'two', 'best', 'worlds', 'strenuous', 'workouts', 'perky', 'days', 'less', 'demanding', 'yin', 'yoga', 'routines', 'moon', 'days.PS', 'Digressing', 'having', 'tried', 'tested', 'many', 'yoga', 'mats', 'black', 'sticky', 'mats', 'used', 'Kest', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'non-slip', 'sturdy', 'cushioned', 'mats', 'aficionados', 'should', 'lay', 'hands']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

I'm fairly new to yoga, but athletic so don't have many problems getting into the poses, or with flexability-and have taken yoga courses indipendantly of these two DVDs.The Good: Three solid workouts on one DVD, each coming in at about an hour. ""Classroom"" setting, showing different students with differing skill levels performing the poses: a great way to demonstrate that everyone will engage each pose a bit different. Quick clips of the poses by Brian mixed into the workouts, just in case you need a closer look at a pose. Poses are held for longer durations, truly adding to the challenge.The Bad: Brian talks way too much. I love this DVD for the workouts-but I'm left feeling less than calm when I'm finished. Yee's ""power yoga: full body"" isn't nearly as tough, yet Yee's delivery leaves you feeling the way you should after a session... calm, relaxed, and clear. For some reason, the director chose to shoot the last session in a ""rose"" tinted view. Annoying, though during a normal practice you won't be looking at the screen anyway. Brian has ""pet"" names for some of the poses, and doesn't explicitly state what pose your going into next... he relies on you either watching the screen, or having memory of the routine. His routines don't flow as well as I would have liked.The Verdict: Even with the constant commentary and stunted flow, it's still three solid yoga workouts that will challenge you for quite some time.

379554,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,6303548970,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[3, 3]","These three yoga programs are my favorite yoga of all time.  I originally had the VHS tapes of these and I played them so much that the tapes wore out!  I was very excited to see that these programs were now available on one DVD.  Energize, Tone and Sweat are the three programs.I had a very different experience than several of the reviewers who didn't like this DVD.  It's almost as though we were watching totally different DVDs.  This brings home the point that yoga is a very individual practice.I am an advanced exerciser who does mainly weight training and intense cardio.  I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years and consider myself a high intermediate.It seems the stronger I get, the harder these yoga routines become.  I think this is because as my strength and balance improve, I am going deeper into the poses.  I'm also holding the poses longer.  Thanks to yoga, I am so much more aware of my body and can really isolate exactly where I should be feeling a pose.Why I love this DVD:**It's yoga that grows with you.  You can make the practice as easy or as hard as you like.**No ""impossible"" poses like head stand or full crow.**I feel so calm, yet energized after finishing.**Bryan's calming voice is relaxing on its own.**Bryan gives just enough instruction and doesn't go on endlessly about a pose.  I have found this to be a major annoyance with other yoga workouts, most notable Cathe Friedrich and Tracey Staehle yoga programs.**The calming music suits the workout.**The set, that of an old warehouse with brick walls and wooden floors fits the mood of the workouts.There are a few things to note in these workouts.  I don't consider them to be negatives.  Here are the things:**Bryan doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  To get the most out of this workout, you should be somewhat familiar with the various yoga poses.**Bryan usually doesn't give the yoga terms for the poses.  For example with fierce pose, he just says to bend your knees and raise your arms.  It wasn't until I did subsequent yoga workouts by other instructors that I learned the official pose names.**Even though I love all three programs, I couldn't really tell the difference between the three.

I hate aerobics/hopping around but have just discovered that I really like yoga. I started 3 months ago with Rodney Yee's Yoga BurnRodney Yee: Yoga Burn& Power YogaPower Yoga - Total Body Workout, which are good for the novice to exercize/serious yoga. I have to agree with others that Yee's probably not as challenging as Kest. Also, it's nice to have 3 workouts in 1 DVD so I don't have to hunt down 3 discs! For the beginner it's critical to LISTEN to Kest's advice to challenge yourself but NOT exceed your limits or try to compete with anyone. I'm still at the ""shaky"" stage doing the 1st level, but I feel that I can try most of the poses and modify a bit when I need to, stop when I need to, without feeling inferior or getting that hopeless feeling that I'll never be fit or strong enough to do it. Maybe some are put off my his ongoing advice but I find it gentle and constantly encouraging, not annoying. [And if some of you think his ""Jersey accent"" is too heavy, y'all may want to examine your own ""accent""! I'm from NY, & his is pretty toned down!] You will get a lot of bang for your buck from this video, plus it's nicely produced. Bryan is very very nice to look at (as are his very fit class participants, male & female). But even though some camerawork is clearly shot to highlight his attractiveness, he himself focuses on you, the class, and teaching you to do your best for yourself & no one else. To be clear, the physical beauty in this video is not over the top, its just enough to be a bit of eye candy while you're shakily trying to balance on one foot & imagining one day if you keep it up, you could just maybe look like them.

The people are all super thin, yoga experts, wearing the same uniforms, they move fast through movements, he does not really explain what they are doing , how to do it, although he does explain what you should be feeling, which most yoga dvd's (and teachers) leave out, so that's refreshing. He seems to want to teach a very inward, personal experience, (which is good and traditional yoga philosophy) rather than trying to copy the models in the video, which I think is why the film is so grainy, fuzzy, blurry / foggy and dark (unless i got a very bad version) and the camera does not really focus on what the others are doing, so you can really see clearly..Not for a beginner - It's important to have a background in basic yoga moves, so you can figure out what they are doing.The shots move quickly from person to person, body part, rarely giving you a full look at the movement being done.  Since the models are clearly experts, only advanced positions are being used.  I wouldn't suggest this for a beginner, and depending on if you're in the mood for the very sexual aspect, his voice, and basically doing yoga on your own - with them as company -this is for advanced yoga folks . . .I enjoy it now and then.  He talks continuously, so it's very easy to tune him out, but he is giving very good suggestions on inward focus, and energy flow...  I think if the way it was filmed was more traditional, &#34;wide shots, &#34; , clearly showing the group, the person, the movements, it would be much better, since it does take the eastern based yoga essentials that are often left out of traditional Americanized yoga (move, fast, burn, work hard, intense, )..

It seems like they have a single microphone hanging in the room because as he wanders about, his voice gets better and worse depending upon where he goes. That said, I really like the progressively difficult courses on this DVD. I also like his attitude: very supportive and down-to-earth. I appreciate his ongoing instructions on form and breath.

I was able to hold and maintain most of the poses, although I defintely have some work to do on some of them.  I did #2 Tone a few days later, and in some ways I found that a little more difficult.  I think because of all the standing poses which are held for quite a while. I haven't tried #1 yet.What I like about these workouts are that Bryan DOES give constant instruction!  (I see this fact has been debated in other reviews.)  Because of my basic knowledge of yoga poses, I was able to do the whole workout without looking at the TV except for occassional glances just to check my form.  If you really LISTEN to his instruction and follow them, anyone should be able to assume the pose.  (Okay, beginngers may need to take a few peeks at the TV to make sure they've got it right!)  To me Bryan's running commentary is soothing.  I'm way too hyper to listen to some soft, new-agey music and my own breathing!  I'll get bored way too fast this way.  Bryan is motivating, encouraging yet always reminding that we need to listen to our bodies.  To me, during the workout, I feel calm, I focus more on what I'm feeling and doing, and I can (usually) let my over active brain rest from thinking about the 8 zillion things I need/want to do.  Yet I'm not being preached at to ""feel the power"" or ""just be"" or pretend my body parts are anything other than what they are or that I am actually sucking power from the floor of my bedroom!It depends on who you are and what you want, and I know there are a lot of people who practice yoga for that spiritual aspect.  I'm just not one of them, and for those of you like me who want the benefits of yoga without the other stuff, these are great workouts!  I get an awesome stretch, increased flexibility, increased power (these workouts will definitely strengthen your muscles - particularly in the legs), and a calm mind.  When the workout is over, I feel loose, open, relaxed yet energetic and just plain good!  (Kudos to you people doing these first thing in the morning!  There is NO WAY I could move smoothly through them with morning tightness! I find mid-afternoon to early evening to be my best time with them.  I do cardio in the morning!)And finally, c'mon guys!  Making of fun of his hair and a possible speech impediment!  What's with that?  I actually like Bryan's voice.  He's not bad to look at either.  And the hair?  Heck, I've got the same wild, natural curls.  Bryan's ""look"" might not be for everyone -- but he's a yoga instructor not your date!These workouts are just plain awesome!  If you're anything like me and are searching for some yoga you can and will do, this is it!",5,"FINALLY!

The best thing about this video is that it contains 3 complete routines, which are each different from one another, yet all are very much the in the same style.  Kest's Power Yoga seems to put a bit more emphasis on aerobic moves and breathing, and less on complicated stretches.  It is a good program.

Nice to see teachers proving that yoga is for men as well. The classes are done in what seems an warehouse with maybe purposely artsy very slightly grainy video to add to the warehouse industrial theme. All the students are in supreme shape in white tight outfits for an artsy look. The music has a heavy beat which is great for grounding, but is too complicated/too fast a tempo to be soothing.He has a good voice overall in my opinion, repeatedly tells you to always moving at your own pace which is great, but he does it too much. He keeps talking, pretty fast, barely breathes himself, probably from over trying, but he means well. His voice isn't soothing at first feel, actually tense, but only perhaps because of the camera... I think he needs to stop trying so hard & lay off the sugar &/or caffeine.The fact that the pace is good, he's not boring, etc. & really passionate about yoga, patience, etc. helps. But I can't tell how much body awareness he has. This would be great DVD for tense men who are afraid to be the only guy doing the workout & will feel more at home & less annoyed because they can't get into calming, soothing yoga dvds. This is NOT for beginners due to the lack of detailed cues & speed. This is best for strong/advanced beginners or intermediates.I'm not sure where some people got creeped out by Bryan, he's not as bad as Baron in terms of touching other students. Baron feels like a molester, a gf couldn't even watch & I am sensitive as well. Bryan definitely is not creepy.If anyone has taken a yoga class, the point of taking a class verses video IS that the teacher pulls you in the correct form so you don't hurt yourself so you can FEEL your own body in the right posture. It's quicker & easier then to use verbal instruction so they can help OTHERS in the class as well in that short time.Energize Disk 1 - (almost this order) - introduction for sun salutations (lot of plank, upward dog, downward dog mostly), chair (for only split seconds), several warrior 1, warrior 2, bound side angle, triangle, bound triangle, revolved triangle, pigeon, standing wide legged bend, prayer hands behind back standing hip stretch, prayer twist, tree, boat, camel, hero, sitting fwd bend, reclined spinal twist & ends w/2 min relaxation.The cons are that his voice isn't soothing like Rodney yee, Shiva Rea, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, etc. nor allows much silence. Also it's not HIM doing the workout, though cuts to him alone for a few seconds for each pose. He just walks around which I don't like as much. At least he uses advanced yoga students as demonstrators, so they at least have good form. Take off more stars if you like quiet reflection & calmness to relax your own body which is the goal of yoga.There are trailers of his other workouts at collagevideo com",4,"Good for advanced beginners/intermediate but not for those loooking for soothing, calming practice",1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2871,"['was', 'surprised', 'see', 'almost', '1/2', 'class', 'program', 'was', 'men', 'Nice', 'see', 'teachers', 'proving', 'yoga', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'classes', 'are', 'done', 'what', 'warehouse', 'maybe', 'purposely', 'artsy', 'very', 'slightly', 'grainy', 'video', 'add', 'warehouse', 'industrial', 'theme', 'students', 'are', 'supreme', 'shape', 'white', 'tight', 'outfits', 'artsy', 'look', 'music', 'heavy', 'beat', 'great', 'grounding', 'too', 'complicated/too', 'fast', 'tempo', 'be', 'soothing.He', 'good', 'voice', 'overall', 'opinion', 'repeatedly', 'always', 'moving', 'own', 'pace', 'great', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'pretty', 'fast', 'barely', 'probably', 'trying', 'well', 'voice', ""n't"", 'soothing', 'first', 'feel', 'actually', 'tense', 'only', 'perhaps', 'camera', 'think', 'stop', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'lay', 'off', 'sugar', '/or', 'caffeine.The', 'fact', 'pace', 'good', 'not', 'boring', 'etc', 'really', 'passionate', 'yoga', 'patience', 'etc', 'helps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'body', 'awareness', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'tense', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'be', 'only', 'guy', 'doing', 'workout', 'will', 'feel', 'more', 'home', 'less', 'annoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'calming', 'soothing', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'NOT', 'beginners', 'due', 'lack', 'detailed', 'cues', 'speed', 'best', 'strong/advanced', 'beginners', 'intermediates.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'people', 'got', 'creeped', 'out', 'Bryan', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Baron', 'terms', 'touching', 'other', 'students', 'Baron', 'feels', 'molester', 'gf', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'am', 'sensitive', 'well', 'Bryan', 'definitely', 'not', 'creepy.If', 'anyone', 'taken', 'yoga', 'class', 'point', 'taking', 'class', 'video', 'teacher', 'correct', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'so', 'can', 'FEEL', 'own', 'body', 'right', 'posture', 'quicker', 'easier', 'then', 'use', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'can', 'help', 'OTHERS', 'class', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'time.Energize', 'Disk', '1', 'almost', 'order', 'introduction', 'sun', 'salutations', 'lot', 'plank', 'upward', 'dog', 'downward', 'dog', 'mostly', 'chair', 'only', 'split', 'seconds', 'several', 'warrior', '1', 'warrior', '2', 'bound', 'side', 'angle', 'triangle', 'bound', 'triangle', 'revolved', 'triangle', 'pigeon', 'standing', 'wide', 'legged', 'bend', 'prayer', 'hands', 'back', 'standing', 'hip', 'stretch', 'prayer', 'twist', 'tree', 'boat', 'camel', 'hero', 'sitting', 'fwd', 'bend', 'reclined', 'spinal', 'twist', 'w/2', 'min', 'relaxation.The', 'cons', 'are', 'voice', ""n't"", 'soothing', 'Rodney', 'yee', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'etc', 'much', 'silence', 'Also', 'not', 'HIM', 'doing', 'workout', 'though', 'cuts', 'alone', 'few', 'seconds', 'pose', 'just', 'walks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'least', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'students', 'demonstrators', 'least', 'have', 'good', 'form', 'Take', 'off', 'more', 'stars', 'like', 'quiet', 'reflection', 'calmness', 'relax', 'own', 'body', 'goal', 'yoga.There', 'are', 'trailers', 'other', 'workouts', 'collagevideo', 'com']",Bryan Kest - Power Yoga VHS

379575,A1B86N6Q9NO5QU,6303548970,Vou's Reviews,"[6, 6]","... that can be enjoyed by conscientious beginners and intermediate yogis looking for comprehensive, flowing yoga lessons.From beginning to end each class flows smoothly from one traditional pose to the next. Stretches, balances, twists and strength asanas are all in each lesson.  Every part of the body is addressed.  Beginners can follow the instruction and take rest where necessary; intermediates can focus, look within themselves, and increase the intensity to the desired level of challenge. (The classes don't include advanced poses; for info, the toughest examples are probably upward facing bow, crow and bound revolved extended side angle.)Of course there are similarities between each class (come on, yoga's asanas have been around for a few thousand years now and these classes are not trying to reinvent them to suit those who ""want something different""); the subtle changes in instruction, variations and timing result in three quite different and challenging practices.  Having done each of them a number of times now, I definitely feel this disc is a great investment.The Bryan Kest debate rages on! His accent and personal teaching style are distinctive and whether the latter suits you is going to be a matter of personal taste. It's true he keeps the `instruction' going the whole time. He passionately includes motivational messages about us each being different, having our own levels of strength and flexibility and how we should not be comparing ourselves to others, telling us ""we're all perfect if we are where we are because where we are is perfect"" etc. His instruction to the poses is never adversely affected though.  He cues well, offers variations for different ability levels and continues to guide you through adjustments, correct alignment, placement and breathing while you hold the poses.  If you're not judgmental about his choice of stylized presentation, BK's intro to each class is worth using as a time to centre yourself and remind yourself of your breathing.I don't understand people who criticize BK's accent at all! Surely we all have our own way of speaking and should accept the differences in others without judgment!
