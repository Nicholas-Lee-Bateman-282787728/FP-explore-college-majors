However, the sport grows and becomes the most popular sport in the world. With the most popular athlete in the world Tre Ramesy. {Dean Cain} Switch to a Hawian gang ready to form a revolt against North America. {By the way I am just giving the general plot there is much more.} To prevent a war Tre challenges them to a game of FutureSport.

458880,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6305300798,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","There are some flagrant similarities to ROLLERBALL, but for a made for tv movie, FUTURESPORT is an entertaining, ""Rocky"" kind of movie.Seems like in the future, Hawaii has decided it wants to be independent of the US, so they have a bunch of ruthless terrorists out to overthrow the government.  One of their targets is supersportsman Dean Cain, who has become the idol of millions in the game of Futuresport, which is like ice hockey on flying skateboards, and you have to throw this metal ball into the goal BEFORE it becomes electrified and toasts your hands.  Cain has a romantic history with newswoman Vanessa Williams and after Cain's selfcentered ego loses his team the world championship, he sulks a little.  Then he comes up with the idea of having war avoided by staging a super Futuresport contest; whoever wins, gets Hawaii.  Far-fetched, but a good plot device for some dandy stuntwork.Cain and Williams are good in their roles; Wesley Snipes who served as executive producer, plays a rastaman who actually invented the game of Futuresport to help out the down zone, which is comparable to today's ghettos.  Snipes seems to have a good time, and his Jekyll/Hyde role works for the movie.  Bill Smitrivich does well as the coach.  Adrian Hughes and Brian Jensen as rivals and players also do a good job.Good action, and production values.",4,THE RETURN OF ROLLERBALL SORTA,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,1350,"['are', 'flagrant', 'similarities', 'ROLLERBALL', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'FUTURESPORT', 'entertaining', 'Rocky', 'kind', 'movie.Seems', 'future', 'Hawaii', 'decided', 'be', 'independent', 'US', 'have', 'bunch', 'ruthless', 'terrorists', 'out', 'overthrow', 'government', 'One', 'targets', 'supersportsman', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'who', 'become', 'idol', 'millions', 'game', 'Futuresport', 'ice', 'hockey', 'flying', 'skateboards', 'have', 'throw', 'metal', 'ball', 'goal', 'electrified', 'hands', 'Cain', 'romantic', 'history', 'newswoman', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'Cain', 'selfcentered', 'ego', 'team', 'world', 'championship', 'little', 'Then', 'up', 'idea', 'having', 'war', 'avoided', 'staging', 'super', 'Futuresport', 'contest', 'Hawaii', 'Far-fetched', 'good', 'plot', 'device', 'dandy', 'stuntwork.Cain', 'Williams', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'who', 'served', 'executive', 'producer', 'rastaman', 'who', 'actually', 'invented', 'game', 'Futuresport', 'help', 'out', 'down', 'zone', 'comparable', 'today', 'ghettos', 'Snipes', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'role', 'movie', 'Bill', 'Smitrivich', 'well', 'coach', 'Adrian', 'Hughes', 'Brian', 'Jensen', 'rivals', 'players', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job.Good', 'action', 'production', 'values']",Future Sport

In a nutshell ... it's 2025, and in only ten years a game called Futuresport (kind of like European Handball on skateboards) has become the most popular sport in the world.  Dean Cain's character plays Tre Ramzey, an ex-basketball player who has become Futuresport's biggest star.  An organization called the Hawaiian Liberation Organization, backed by the Pan-Pacific Commonwealth, carries out terrorist acts and demands sovereignty for the oppressed state of Hawaii (no joke).  In order to end the tensions between the Pan-Pacific Commonwealth and the North American Alliance, and prevent a war, our hero Ramzey proposes to settle the differences over ... a game of Futuresport.

458884,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6305300798,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[5, 6]","I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Considering it's a made for TV movie with the same kind of budget you can expect from that kind of production Futuresport really pulled it off. I'm not saying this movie is high drama or an incredible sci-fi epic, but I will say it deserves a little notation in the annals of the genre. I think it bears repeating: This is a made for TV movie, which means the budget was small and there was likely very little time for polish. In spite of this when you combine a good story, good acting and some of the cleanest special effects I have ever seen for a TV movie I get a pretty satisfied feeling by the time I get to the end credits. This is what the newer Rollerball movie should have been.The plot, though it looks pretty basic on the outside, does have all the elements of good science fiction writing. It's not Gattaca, but it does keep the movie's pace going without resorting to cheap Hollywood tactics. What I like most about the story is that is shows some development with the main characters as well as gives enough exposure to most of the supporting characters for the script to end up being well balanced. The progression of the plot, with its minor twists and turns, keep an otherwise bland premise interesting. The violence is toned down a lot more than what you might expect so I would probably rate it a PG-13 or PG in that regard.I won't say the acting is Oscar material by any means, but I will say it's better than most movies of this caliber. Wesley Snipes pretty much stole the show in this department. I enjoyed seeing him playing an essentially non-action role. It gives him a chance to stretch his acting muscles more, and that he did. You can tell he was enjoying his role, as were the rest of the actors. Dean Kane of Lois and Clark fame also plays a good lead in this one. The villains felt a little too much on the stereotypical bad person theme. Granted you get some pretty decent motives established at the beginning of the movie. They just didn't feel like terrorist/freedom fighters.When I say Futuresport's special effects were the cleanest I have seen in a long time I'm not kidding. The digital touch ups they did for the hover boards are outstanding. To see these things gliding around with ease as if they were skateboards (with no skates mind you) is wonderful. The CGI scenes of various cityscapes and whatnot are also very nice and remind me of the stuff you see on Babylon 5. The tech was neat too, especially the guns and cybernetic cameramen. Very cyperpunk I must say. Unlike most TV or cable sci-fi movies you do see enough technology around outside and indoors to give enough for you to believe you really are seeing the 2020's. To sum it up everything went really well on the technical, effects and scenery side.I'm not going to say Futuresport will win everyone over like it did me. It is after all it's a (everybody say it with me this time) made for television movie. If you can enjoy middle of the road, yet VERY well done, TV production values you should have no problems with this one. I wouldn't call it cyberpunk enough for the diehard fans of the genre, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the lighter side of it either. For the rest of you out there I say check it out, sit back, and enjoy what a good TV movie is supposed to be like.",4,Better than it sounds,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,3338,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'Considering', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'same', 'kind', 'budget', 'can', 'expect', 'kind', 'production', 'Futuresport', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'high', 'drama', 'incredible', 'sci-fi', 'epic', 'will', 'say', 'little', 'notation', 'annals', 'genre', 'think', 'repeating', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'budget', 'was', 'small', 'was', 'likely', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'polish', 'spite', 'when', 'combine', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'cleanest', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'movie', 'get', 'pretty', 'satisfied', 'feeling', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'what', 'newer', 'Rollerball', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'basic', 'outside', 'have', 'elements', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'writing', 'not', 'Gattaca', 'keep', 'movie', 'pace', 'going', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'Hollywood', 'tactics', 'What', 'like', 'most', 'story', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'enough', 'exposure', 'most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'script', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'well', 'balanced', 'progression', 'plot', 'minor', 'twists', 'turns', 'keep', 'otherwise', 'bland', 'premise', 'interesting', 'violence', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'PG-13', 'PG', 'regard.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'material', 'means', 'will', 'say', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'caliber', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'department', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'playing', 'essentially', 'non-action', 'role', 'chance', 'stretch', 'acting', 'muscles', 'more', 'did', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'enjoying', 'role', 'were', 'rest', 'actors', 'Dean', 'Kane', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'fame', 'also', 'good', 'lead', 'one', 'villains', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'stereotypical', 'bad', 'person', 'theme', 'Granted', 'get', 'pretty', 'decent', 'motives', 'established', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'terrorist/freedom', 'fighters.When', 'say', 'Futuresport', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cleanest', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'digital', 'touch', 'did', 'hover', 'boards', 'are', 'outstanding', 'see', 'things', 'gliding', 'around', 'ease', 'were', 'skateboards', 'skates', 'wonderful', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'various', 'cityscapes', 'whatnot', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'remind', 'stuff', 'see', 'Babylon', '5', 'tech', 'was', 'neat', 'too', 'especially', 'guns', 'cybernetic', 'cameramen', 'Very', 'cyperpunk', 'must', 'say', 'most', 'TV', 'cable', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'do', 'see', 'enough', 'technology', 'outside', 'indoors', 'give', 'enough', 'believe', 'really', 'are', 'seeing', '2020', 'sum', 'up', 'everything', 'went', 'really', 'well', 'technical', 'effects', 'scenery', 'side.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'Futuresport', 'will', 'win', 'everyone', 'did', 'everybody', 'say', 'time', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'can', 'enjoy', 'middle', 'road', 'yet', 'VERY', 'well', 'done', 'TV', 'production', 'values', 'should', 'have', 'problems', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'cyberpunk', 'enough', 'diehard', 'fans', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'enjoying', 'lighter', 'side', 'rest', 'say', 'check', 'out', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'what', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be']",Future Sport
458885,A342EHO42V2G38,6305300798,"Terran ""Terran""","[0, 0]","Futuresport is an electrically charged combination ice hockey-basket(hand)ball game that is invented to prevent gang violence - territory disputes are settled by which team wins the game.  Ten years after its world-wide exploitation, Futuresport is THE game on the planet and Tre Ramsey its #1 star.  But it is only utilized as a sporting event, until Tre Ransey gets the idea the world could return to its basic premise for the game, at least for now: settling land disputes.  The land under dispute is the Hawaiian Islands, which North America wants to retain, yet the HLO - Hawaiian Liberation Organization - wants to reclaim as independent.  HLO's method of liberation is through acts of terrorism, and their current target of assassination is Tre Ramsey and his former girlfriend, the journalist who first brought Futuresport to the world's attention.  The climax of the film is the &quot;street rules&quot; - no hold's barred - game of Futuresport between the North American team vs. the Pan Pacific team.  The plots and numerous characters make this film worth watching more than once, then you can sit back and enjoy the ride.  The performances are uniformly good; the technology intriguing and fun; Futuresport itself so fast-paced and skillful you can see why it would be THE world's sport.  Vanessa Williams plays the journalist, and does a fine job: a quibble is the peculiar yellow juandiced look to her skin and orange-tinted hair, evidently the epitome of chic in the future.  Oddly, in Tim Burton and even Ron Howard (WILLOW) films the heroine will sport a fanciful orange dye job.  Dean Cain is Tre Ramsey, and he's well-built for Futuresport, and attired in expensive-casual and a permanently unshaven look.  Other members of the cast look like gen-Xers or punks.  The movie is too short at 90 minutes to do the characters and plot true justice, and the only extra on the DVD is the trailer, as fast-paced and image-laden as the movie.",4,The way of the world...,992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,1953,"['Futuresport', 'electrically', 'charged', 'combination', 'ice', 'hockey-basket', 'hand', 'ball', 'game', 'invented', 'prevent', 'gang', 'violence', 'territory', 'disputes', 'are', 'settled', 'team', 'game', 'Ten', 'years', 'world-wide', 'exploitation', 'Futuresport', 'THE', 'game', 'planet', 'Tre', 'Ramsey', '1', 'star', 'only', 'utilized', 'sporting', 'event', 'Tre', 'Ransey', 'idea', 'world', 'could', 'return', 'basic', 'premise', 'game', 'least', 'now', 'settling', 'land', 'disputes', 'land', 'dispute', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'North', 'America', 'retain', 'yet', 'HLO', 'Hawaiian', 'Liberation', 'Organization', 'reclaim', 'independent', 'HLO', 'method', 'liberation', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'current', 'target', 'assassination', 'Tre', 'Ramsey', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'journalist', 'who', 'first', 'brought', 'Futuresport', 'world', 'attention', 'climax', 'film', 'quot', 'street', 'rules', 'quot', 'hold', 'barred', 'game', 'Futuresport', 'North', 'American', 'team', 'Pan', 'Pacific', 'team', 'plots', 'numerous', 'characters', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'then', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'technology', 'intriguing', 'fun', 'Futuresport', 'so', 'fast-paced', 'skillful', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'THE', 'world', 'sport', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'journalist', 'fine', 'job', 'quibble', 'peculiar', 'yellow', 'juandiced', 'look', 'skin', 'orange-tinted', 'hair', 'evidently', 'epitome', 'chic', 'future', 'Oddly', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'even', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'WILLOW', 'films', 'heroine', 'will', 'sport', 'fanciful', 'orange', 'dye', 'job', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Tre', 'Ramsey', 'well-built', 'Futuresport', 'attired', 'expensive-casual', 'permanently', 'unshaven', 'look', 'Other', 'members', 'cast', 'look', 'gen-Xers', 'punks', 'movie', 'too', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'do', 'characters', 'plot', 'true', 'justice', 'only', 'extra', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'fast-paced', 'image-laden', 'movie']",Future Sport
