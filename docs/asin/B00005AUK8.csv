579061,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005AUK8,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 26]","This was a very strange film developed in the 1960s.  The dark themes of love, money, greed, and overall the protagonist's dream of being the next big sensation were chilling.  This film was a perfect example of a very depressing story that never had a glimmer of light.  Sure, there are several times we think that Archie will taste success, but before he is able to put the symbolic spoon into the bowl, he is shot down harder and faster than before.  There is never a big break for Archie.  He represents the human in even the smallest entertainer.  As I read my local paper and see that Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg stopped at a local DQ earlier in the month, I can't help but realize the fact that this film is trying to show.  They are human.  While they may have more money and seen by more people, they are still human and have to deal with the human drama that we cope with daily.  Archie is no exemption, and his struggles with love, money, family, and success are just stronger realizations of his human element.  Add to this mix Archie's father and you see the true element of which I speak.  Archie's father represents a dying breed of actors that do not live grandiose lifestyles, but somehow live on just their name alone.  They have spent their money and rely on the kindness of strangers for favors.  This is where Archie lacks.  His kindness is only to women, and they continually hurt him in the long run.Outside of the ""human entertainer"" concept, this is a very flat and shallow film.  From the opening scene until the end, we are never quite given the big picture of this family or our surroundings.  I never quite understood the scenes.  Where were we?  Why were we here?  Who are the people that do visit Archie's shows?  This builds a horrible background for our characters to live within.  Without the proper structure behind our characters this forces them to crumble with the slightest bit of force.  Archie's daughter Jean, the self-appointed narrator of the family, never seems to fit into her role.  Plowright never seems comfortable with her character and is constantly giving off the wrong emotion during the scene. There was one part when I swore I saw her laughing.  She is a distraction and a downfall for this film.  Secondly, Olivier needed to contain his character a bit.  I know that he was to portray an entertainer on the edge of reality, but it never showed.  He needed more control over his emotions and really build a human element to his character.  He was neither believable nor enjoyable to watch.  From the beginning of this film I never once felt like he could be successful, and when he is the character we are trying to rejoice over, we need to feel that sensation.  I needed to feel like he could really make this show work, instead of constantly being pulled deeper into his depression.  This goes with Archie's father as well.  It is possible to play too senile, and this is a perfect example.  The entire cake scene (when you see it you will see) was laughable instead of emotional.  The only character that worked decently well in this film was Phoebe.  She had a touch character to grapple with and it felt like Brenda De Banzie was the only one carrying her weight in this film.  Her emotion and power made some of the scenes worth watching instead of completely unbearable.Finally, I would like to say that with the background taking second fiddle to the actors, and the actors taking second fiddle to the background, this band needed longer hours practicing.  Not only was this film confusing, but it also only allowed us to see one segment of the story.  I needed more pre-story information or possibly a better ending to really allow me to connection with Archie.  There was nothing forcing me to feel sympathy for the main character.  I didn't know enough about him, nor did I really feel comfortable with the family dynamics between him and Phoebe.  What was their relationship?  Plutonic?  Who knows?  All I do know is that director Tony Richardson did not have control over this film.  He seemed to slip between what his star player of the film (Laurence Olivier) and a developed story.  I do not see why Laurence was nominated for an Oscar for this role.  There was nothing spectacular.Overall, maybe I missed the boat on this film.  Perhaps I was expecting my first Laurence Olivier film to blow me out of the water, but instead all I found was a jumbled mess of papers.  I understand that the world of entertainment is not as glamorous as we think it is, but it is not as depressing as Richardson shows in this film.  I needed a stronger balance and a better cast to make this film work for me.  I needed to see some reason for me to attach myself to Archie, but sadly there was nothing.  This film failed for me, but I will not give up on Olivier, I think he can prevail.On a side note, maybe it is just me, but I thought that Olivier in this film resembled Robin Williams in not only the way that he spoke, but also the facial mannerisms.  Odd, maybe it is just me...Grade: ** out of *****",2,You don't look at the mantelpiece when you poke the fire,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,5064,"['was', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'developed',

579063,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005AUK8,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","THE ENTERTAINER is a 1960 British black-and-white drama, set in 1956, that is a variation on the ""kitchen-sink"" working-class dramas of the day: it concerns the privations and struggles of a working-class family but the emphasis is on age, not youth.  Laurence Olivier is the title character, Archie Rice, an aging British music-hall entertainer in the midst of an imploding career, still determined to strut his stuff on stage in spite of declining and apathetic audiences.  Archie's riposte for the trials of life is that his real hates are ""priests, nuns, and dogs"" but his ongoing crack about dodging the income-tax man is all too real: he and his disgruntled theatrical troupe are operating in bankruptcy, his beleaguered common-law wife (Phoebe, movingly played by Brenda de Banzie) forced to write the checks and struggle with the debts.  Joan Plowright plays the daughter, the glue and enabler trying to hold Archie's dysfunctional family together.  Roger Livesey plays Archie's father, an elderly dapper gent who was quite a successful entertainer in his day, unlike Archie.  Alan Bates and Albert Finney have their first screen roles here as Archie's sons, one of whom desultorily tries to keep bookings and billings going, the other shipped off to the Middle East during the Suez Canal crisis.  Everything that can go wrong does go wrong for this family, though a good deal of their tribuations are self-imposed; yet when the characters reach their extremities, this reviewer's estimation of them changed from distaste to sympathy: (**Small Spoilers: Phoebe lashing out at Archie's father for accidentally eating a piece of a luxurious layer cake she had bought with borrowed money for her soldier son's homecoming; Archie all but breaking down onstage after a performance, in which he admits his mediocrity and futility**).  Olivier received an Oscar nomination for this distinctly non-heroic change-of-pace role; interestingly, he later admitted that he was much more like Archie than Hamlet!  THE ENTERTAINER is a first-rate, slice-of-life drama with excellent peformances, but not what you want to see if you need cheering up.

Salama,"[0, 1]","Laurence Olivier stars as a sleazy, third-rate music hall performer in 1960's ""The Entertainer"", one of the first and best films of the so called Free Cinema movement, and a movie that is somewhat neglected today (it should be better known). Based on a play by John Osborne, Olivier plays Archie Rice, a mediocre performer in grim seaside town theaters. His shows attract few people (early in the film, we see passersby sneering at the theater marquee that falsely advertises Archie as a television comedian). His father, Billy, was once a talented and successful comedian, but now he is just a cranky old man living with him and Archie's wife, the unstable Phoebe. Archie has three grown children, played respectively by Alan Bates, Albert Finney and Joan Plowright, all very early in their careers. Jean (Plowright, who would become Olivier's wife soon after this film) comes to home from London and sees her family unraveling: one of her brothers have been sent to Suez, her stepmother is becoming more and more unstable, Archie is hounded by his creditors while he imprudently starts a romance with a beauty contestant, with the hope of obtaining financing for his shows from her rich parents. The film goes downhill from here, so is quite bleak, but it is very well done (and especially, performed). Some critics see Archie as a metaphor of postwar England, and this may indeed have been Osborne's intention, but the film plays better as a character study of a very flawed man.",4,"Great, somewhat neglected film, with superb Olivier performance",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,1482,"['Laurence', 'Olivier', 'sleazy', 'third-rate', 'music', 'hall', 'performer', '1960', 'Entertainer', 'one', 'first', 'best', 'films', 'so', 'called', 'Free', 'Cinema', 'movement', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'today', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'Based', 'play', 'John', 'Osborne', 'Olivier', 'Archie', 'Rice', 'mediocre', 'performer', 'grim', 'seaside', 'town', 'theaters', 'shows', 'attract', 'few', 'people', 'early', 'film', 'see', 'passersby', 'sneering', 'theater', 'marquee', 'falsely', 'Archie', 'television', 'comedian', 'father', 'Billy', 'was', 'once', 'talented', 'successful', 'comedian', 'now', 'just', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'living', 'Archie', 'wife', 'unstable', 'Phoebe', 'Archie', 'three', 'grown', 'children', 'played', 'respectively', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'very', 'early', 'careers', 'Jean', 'Plowright', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Olivier', 'wife', 'soon', 'film', 'home', 'London', 'family', 'unraveling', 'one', 'brothers', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'Suez', 'stepmother', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'unstable', 'Archie', 'hounded', 'creditors', 'imprudently', 'romance', 'beauty', 'contestant', 'hope', 'obtaining', 'financing', 'shows', 'rich', 'parents', 'film', 'downhill', 'here', 'so', 'quite', 'bleak', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'performed', 'critics', 'see', 'Archie', 'metaphor', 'postwar', 'England', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'been', 'Osborne', 'intention', 'film', 'better', 'character', 'study', 'very', 'flawed', 'man']",N/A

He has a way out - one of his relatives will pay off his debts if he'll accept his drunken wife's nephew's offer to run a motel in Canada. But like any Briton who can remember England's finer days he's just not about to cut and run, and even though I can despise the lying, the cheating on his used up wife, his odd ideas about parenting, and his willingness to use his own father, I can't help but admire his ""pioneer spirit"" to use an American term. He'd rather fail on his own terms than succeed on someone else's.Joan Plowright is the other lead, and she plays Archie's daughter, Jean. She shows some pioneer spirit herself. She shares some characteristics with dad - she's a painter who can't paint, Archie's a vaudevillian who can't entertain. Unlike dad, she owns up to her shortcomings and wants to make a contribution anyways by teaching art to poor slum kids. She has a way out of Britain just like dad does. Her fianc&eacute; has been offered a job opportunity in Africa, and he encourages her to leave her dead country behind, but she just isn't ready to give up on England or her family just yet. The two have a falling out and Jean goes to visit her dysfunctional family, in which she finds comfort.I just don't get people who say that they don't like this one because it's boring, depressing, ugly. Every minute of this film held my interest and stayed with me long after I'd watched it.

Archie Rice (Lawrence Olivier) is a third-rate, aging vaudeville entertainer, headlining his own show in the run-down English seaside resort of Morecomb. He's just about at the end of his string, playing to half-empty, bored audiences, running up debt, and desperate to stay in the business. He has a wife, Phoebe (Brenda De Banzie) who loves him and drinks too much, a daughter, Jean (Joan Plowright), who also loves him but has no illusions about him, two sons, Mick (Albert Finney), who joined the Army and is being shipped off to Suez, and Frank (Alan Bates), who works for his father in the music hall, and his own father, Billy Rice (Roger Livesey), once a headliner but now aging and retired. In the course of the movie Archie one way or another uses them, fails them or both.The Entertainer is grim stuff. It's redeemed, I think, by two elements. First, it represents the reaction in the Fifties by British playwrights such as John Osborne to the polished, upper-class and unrealistic theater in Britain following WWII. Playwrights such as Christopher Fry and Terrence Rattigan produced hugely popular works that many thought were out of touch with reality. Then Osborne and others came along with what critics called the kitchen sink school...slices of working life, puncturing British pretensions of class and power. Watched in this context, the movie brings a lot to the table.The second element is the acting. Olivier was the epitome of polished British theater. When he agreed to play The Entertainer on stage he instantly legitimized the style and he thoroughly revamped his own reputation. Archie Rice is a third-rate singer, dancer and comedian. ""Well, you're a lovely lot tonight,"" he says during his act, ""a lovely lot tonight. I've played in front of them all, you know...The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales...and, oh, what's the name of that other pub?"" Privately, he confesses to his daughter that ""I never solved a problem in my life."" Olivier, who could sing and dance very well when needed, is awful and perfect. In a rare moment of honesty, Rice points out to his daughter that he is dead behind his eyes. Olivier captures that flat moment. He also has a whole troupe of excellent actors backing him up, from such experienced hands as Roger Livesey and Brenda De Banzie, to two actors making their screen debuts, Alan Bates and Albert Finney.

Also notable in the role of Rice's social worker daughter is Joan Plowright, who would become the future Mrs. Olivier.  Albert Finney distinguishes himself in the one-scene part of Rice's doomed paratrooper son.

Before this 1960 film he had been a handsome leading man, receiving Oscar nominations for his performances in ""Wuthering Heights,"" ""Rebecca,"" ""The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with his Battell at Agincourt in France,"" ""Hamlet"" (for which he won,"" and ""Richard III."" After ""The Entertainer"" his nominations were all for character roles, beginning with Archie Rice in this film and then for ""Othello"" (performed in makeup as a Negro), ""Sleuth,"" ""Marathon Man,"" and ""The Boys From Brazil."" Performing the film adaptation of John Osborne's play, Olivier restaked his claim as the greatest actor of his generation by adding modern drama to his collection of work in Shakespeare and the classics.Archie Rice is a bitter character, without any noticeable redeeming quality besides the attempt to survive. He is a comic whose routines are not funny, and perhaps once upon a time, in the early days, they were a put-on, playing a bitter person taking out his anger on the world. Either way, the act is for real now and is a p[itiful] figure. Archie works in a seedy music hall and has his eye on Shirley Anne Field (Tina Lapford), who must be a symbol of some sort of redemption besides simple carnal desire. Just as he ignores his audiences, Archie ignores his own family, who would provide an even more devastating critique of his wretched life. There is no sentimental side to Archie, who remains unflinchingly flawed unto the bitter end.The film is directed by Tony Richardson, who had done Osborne's ""Look Back in Anger"" two years earlier and who would win his Oscar for ""Tom Jones."" However, ""The Entertainer"" is clearly representative of the ""kitchen sink"" style of film that characterized Britain's own ""New Wave"" cinema, which tended to focus on the growing decline in the quality of life in Britain after World War II. The cast features a young Alan Bates as son Frank, Albert Finney debuting as son Mick, and Joan Plowright as daughter Jean (within a year she would be the third and final wife of Olivier). Brenda de Banzie delivers a touching performance as Archie's wife, a bitter alcoholic, whose husband stopped loving her a long time ago. However, from start to finish the film is focused on Olivier's performance, which Olivier often said was the one of which he was most proud, being such a departure from his usual roles and work.

A rather average music hall performer is trying to hold on admid the collapse of his entire world. Music hall as a performance form is reaching its absolute end around 1956. Even the resort towns in which he performs are worn out. But Archie Rice keeps on performing no matter what the cost.I think its without a doubt the best film performance of Olivier's career. Its also possibly the only thing written by John ""Look back in Anger"" Osborne that I would consider a good work. Its tragegy in an almost classical sense. What sets it apart from many other works of Osborne is that the desperation creates sympathy for the main character which is something missing from (for example) ""Look back in Anger"". But the sympathy is mixed up with other emotions as ""Archie"" drags down everyone around him. Its also probably Tony Richardson's best film as well.There are obvious allusions made to Britain in the 1950s and the whole notion of imperial decline. The Suez (1956) war goes on the background. But the allusions are too obvious to really be interesting. The work is as powerful or more powerful with the nationalistic/period ties. Its a story as old as the final collapse of the Roman or Persian Empires. Its the desperation of a last stand among the ruins and the associated questions of how high a price should be paid to keep something going. Its a point that I dont know how many films about the end of slient films have never been close to making. The allusions to emigration (to Canada) as a solution in 1950s ""austerity Britain"" are more effective in terms of the story. I also think that it would have been an even more effective story had a been a good performer. Because in the situation, good, bad or average as a performer, music hall (like Vaudville in the US) was finished and so was his world.Its a rough thing to watch.

'the entertainer' features Laurence olivier in perhaps his greatest screen performance as the detestable, washed up vaudevilian Archie Rice who just can't give up the stage.. It is, moreover, the portrait of a family that struggles to survive in post world war 2 england.. With a son off in the military, a slightly senile yet amiable old grandfather, his son the not so sly womanizer archie rice, archie's much neglected wife, and the daughter played by joan plowright in her first screen performance..
