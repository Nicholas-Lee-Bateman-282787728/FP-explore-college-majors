1109278,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000WGLADI,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 2]","""Anyone and Everyone"" is a fascinating documentary about families struggling with their children's homosexuality. It shows a range of people- Cherokees, Hindus, Catholics, Jews, Southern Baptists, and Mormons. The families are upfront and honest--even the Indian family which has basically disowned their gay son. The documentary keeps the gay issue from being black&white.; The families are confused--torn between their doctrine and their children. Who-or what-do they love more?""Anyone and Everyone"" is a fast-moving documentary,with plenty of food for thought. Unfortunately,it leaves out Muslims,as well as those who belong to more progressive churches like Unity and Religious Science. The Jewish family shows that even those who have liberal congregations (with a female rabbi) struggle with their children's sexual orientation.""Anyone and Everyone"" is an educating and informative film.",4,Family Values,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,893,"['Anyone', 'Everyone', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'families', 'struggling', 'children', 'homosexuality', 'range', 'people-', 'Cherokees', 'Hindus', 'Catholics', 'Jews', 'Southern', 'Baptists', 'Mormons', 'families', 'are', 'upfront', 'honest', 'even', 'Indian', 'family', 'basically', 'disowned', 'gay', 'son', 'documentary', 'gay', 'issue', 'being', 'black', 'white', 'families', 'are', 'confused', 'torn', 'doctrine', 'children', 'Who-or', 'what-do', 'love', 'more', 'Anyone', 'Everyone', 'fast-moving', 'documentary', 'plenty', 'food', 'thought', 'Unfortunately', 'out', 'Muslims', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'belong', 'more', 'progressive', 'churches', 'Unity', 'Religious', 'Science', 'Jewish', 'family', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'liberal', 'congregations', 'female', 'rabbi', 'struggle', 'children', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Anyone', 'Everyone', 'educating', 'informative', 'film']",Anyone and Everyone - Documentary
1109279,A1GHPYA758SQ3G,B000WGLADI,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","When I saw the advertisement for this documentary I didn't expect much more than your average ""coming out"" documentary where horrible things happen like gay children being disowned and thrown out on the streets.  On the contrary, ""Anyone and Everyone"" is the most accurate, honest and touching film I have ever seen on this subject.  I was awed at the insight these parents had (especially the wonderful Mormon parents)on what homosexuality is all about.  The parents of these sons and daughters chronicle the pain, shame and hurt they experienced when their child told them that they were gay.  But then, out of their love of their gay children, they push aside all the myths and misconceptions and decide to educate themselves and find out the real truth.  It is inspiring how more loving and close these families became...and how the gay children blossomed into wonderful, normal, loving human beings.  Shaming our children for ""what they are"" causes emotional damage which can lead to self-loathing, depression, and self-destructive behavior.  We need to embrace and love our gay children for what they are, otherwise we are causing them great harm.  If you are gay and are ready to come out to your family, this is the PERFECT film to give them.  I wish this documentary would of been around when I came out.",5,A Must See Documentary!,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1313,"['When', 'saw', 'advertisement', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'more', 'average', 'coming', 'out', 'documentary', 'where', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'gay', 'children', 'being', 'disowned', 'thrown', 'out', 'streets', 'contrary', 'Anyone', 'Everyone', 'most', 'accurate', 'honest', 'touching', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'subject', 'was', 'awed', 'insight', 'parents', 'had', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'Mormon', 'parents', 'what', 'homosexuality', 'parents', 'sons', 'daughters', 'chronicle', 'pain', 'shame', 'hurt', 'experienced', 'when', 'child', 'told', 'were', 'gay', 'then', 'love', 'gay', 'children', 'push', 'aside', 'myths', 'misconceptions', 'decide', 'educate', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'truth', 'inspiring', 'how', 'more', 'loving', 'close', 'families', 'became', 'how', 'gay', 'children', 'blossomed', 'wonderful', 'normal', 'loving', 'human', 'beings', 'Shaming', 'children', 'what', 'are', 'emotional', 'damage', 'can', 'lead', 'self-loathing', 'depression', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'need', 'embrace', 'love', 'gay', 'children', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'causing', 'great', 'harm', 'are', 'gay', 'are', 'ready', 'come', 'out', 'family', 'PERFECT', 'film', 'give', 'wish', 'documentary', 'would', 'been', 'when', 'came', 'out']",Anyone and Everyone - Documentary

It's is honest about how different parents deal with their children coming out.

1109281,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000WGLADI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","ANYONE AND EVERYONE is a typically great, thorough documentary that addresses so much more than you might think. Though it deals with gay teens and the suicide/other horrors awaiting these poor kids, directly related to their families' rejection of them, it also addresses those parents who say, ""My child is my child, I love my child.""There was a mother in this film who said she approached her church's pastor about her gay son. The pastor told her the typical playbook line: ""We hate the sin, we love the sinner."" The mother took away a viewpoint of this phony-baloney statement that I found refreshing. She reasoned that in other words, you hate my son - when Jesus taught the Supreme Commandment is LOVE, you said the word ""hate"".And that is exactly what the message really says.This heart-warming, heart-breaking film is a must-see. Absolutely. After I saw this I happened to watch a documentary about the Stone Wall Inn 'uprising' that may have resulted in the launching of the American gay rights movement. The hatred, persecution and entrapment that awaited gay people back then ... I know I remember it well. When the Stone Wall Inn documentary showed the homophobic politprop films meant for us kids, it haunted me with memories of an ugly homophobic society.ANYONE AND EVERYONE refers to two things as I see it: to those who are gay and to those who will suffer/die for it. What I loved most about this film is its expos&eacute; of parents who will die for their children. For these great, brave people, the gay part of their kids is just that: a PART.It is a part they readily accept. How can they do this? Several of the parents said it: LOVE.",5,All we need is love,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1657,"['ANYONE', 'AND', 'EVERYONE', 'typically', 'great', 'thorough', 'documentary', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'might', 'think', 'gay', 'teens', 'suicide/other', 'horrors', 'awaiting', 'poor', 'kids', 'directly', 'related', 'families', 'rejection', 'also', 'parents', 'who', 'say', 'child', 'child', 'love', 'child', 'was', 'mother', 'film', 'who', 'said', 'approached', 'church', 'pastor', 'gay', 'son', 'pastor', 'told', 'typical', 'playbook', 'line', 'hate', 'sin', 'love', 'sinner', 'mother', 'took', 'away', 'viewpoint', 'phony-baloney', 'statement', 'found', 'refreshing', 'reasoned', 'other', 'words', 'hate', 'son', 'when', 'Jesus', 'taught', 'Supreme', 'Commandment', 'LOVE', 'said', 'word', 'hate', '.And', 'exactly', 'what', 'message', 'really', 'says.This', 'heart-warming', 'heart-breaking', 'film', 'must-see', 'Absolutely', 'saw', 'happened', 'watch', 'documentary', 'Stone', 'Wall', 'Inn', ""'uprising"", 'may', 'have', 'resulted', 'launching', 'American', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'hatred', 'persecution', 'entrapment', 'awaited', 'gay', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'know', 'remember', 'well', 'When', 'Stone', 'Wall', 'Inn', 'documentary', 'showed', 'homophobic', 'politprop', 'films', 'meant', 'kids', 'haunted', 'memories', 'ugly', 'homophobic', 'society.ANYONE', 'AND', 'EVERYONE', 'refers', 'two', 'things', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'gay', 'who', 'will', 'suffer/die', 'What', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'expos', 'eacute', 'parents', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'children', 'great', 'brave', 'people', 'gay', 'part', 'kids', 'just', 'PART.It', 'part', 'readily', 'accept', 'How', 'can', 'do', 'Several', 'parents', 'said', 'LOVE']",Anyone and Everyone - Documentary
1109282,A1L5PM0IE9TIPH,B000WGLADI,"Mark A. Biernbaum ""Researcher and Psychologist""","[1, 1]","This documentary hits hard.  A groups of parents discuss in vignettes their responses to having a child come out.  The parents represent several cultures and each culture/religion/social class has interesting and compelling responses. The young adults are interviewed too, so a complete picture, 360, is provided. With each set of parents, there is a moment that tugs deeply on the heart.  I cried many times while watching this film and grew to appreciate my own parents' struggle.  Particularly moving are the Mormon parents, the Catholic parents, and the Asian parents.  The outcomes are not always positive, and some parents go through extraordinary transformations, from rejecting and homophobic to accepting and committed to gay and lesbian rights.  An extraordinary little film that packs a powerful impact.
