This time Emmanuelle Beart is the angel.The story is one of those strait forward situation comedies. As in ""Heaven Can Wait"" or more like ""Meet Joe black"", an angle on a mission is detoured when a satellite nicks her wing. She lands in a pool of a soon to be married musician (Jim). You know musicians; he is obligated to help the angle, yet he can not tell his fianc&eacute;e (Patty), who of course suspects there is another woman. Naturally his friends find out and plan to get rich. And so on and so on.Eventually the angle that by this time is enamored with Jim and vice versa is well and leaves. Patty who has been insulted and assaulted by Jim and the angle leaves also. To top it off maybe there was no angle. Seems Jim has a brain tumor.

The basic story idea was good, but almost everyone plays a buffoon in the film.  If it were remade today (hopefully) it would be a tighter, more intelligent script.Phoebe Cates got a bad rap in this film.  She is sweet, beautiful and intelligent, and engaged to the lead boy.  She loves this stupid kid, but he falls in love with an angel.  Now the script takes a wrong turn and tries to make Phoebe a bad person because the kid broke her heart and she's pissed off at him.  Duh.The film should have ended 5 minutes earlier than it did.  But they decided to give it a ""Hollywood"" ending. Too bad.I give it 3 stars because of the scenes with the boy and the super beautiful Emmanuelle Beart (the angel) -- fast forward through everything else.",3,Film Does Not Date Well,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,802,"['film', 'not', 'carry', 'well', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'later', 'basic', 'story', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'almost', 'everyone', 'buffoon', 'film', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'hopefully', 'would', 'be', 'tighter', 'more', 'intelligent', 'script.Phoebe', 'Cates', 'got', 'bad', 'rap', 'film', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'engaged', 'lead', 'boy', 'stupid', 'kid', 'love', 'angel', 'Now', 'script', 'wrong', 'turn', 'tries', 'make', 'Phoebe', 'bad', 'person', 'kid', 'broke', 'heart', 'pissed', 'off', 'Duh.The', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'ended', '5', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'did', 'decided', 'give', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'Too', 'bad.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'scenes', 'boy', 'super', 'beautiful', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'angel', 'fast', 'forward', 'everything', 'else']",N/A
