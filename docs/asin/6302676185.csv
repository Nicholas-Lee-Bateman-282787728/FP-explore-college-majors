If not you can take this as your history and learn of the reasoning and lack of behind this great time in history.Riveting is to say the least as you expect this to be a documentary. Upon viewing you find that it is anything but. As with all BBC productions there is no equivalent. A few liberties were taken with history but you just do not care because you are too busy kibitzing.The Six Wives of Henry VIII can not be told in less than six programs. Each program or play has an appropriate title that explains the next queen. If the quality of the writing varies that is because they have different writers and it shows. When I first say that the episode ""Catherine of Aragon"" was written by Rosemary Ann Sission I knew we had a winner as she was also the screen writer for ""Strong Poison"" in the Lord Peter Wimsey (1987) (TV) series. So you can image how amazed I was to find that the episode ""Anne Boleyn"" was written even stronger.The unifying element is Keith Michell who plays a spoiled brat oops I mean Henry VIII. He starts out clean shaven in his pageboy hairstyle and ends up as scruffy as his personality by the last play. It helps to have some background information of the time and place. Yet they fill it in well as they describe the current events and how they were influences by Henry VIII and his Six Wives.",5,Riveting,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1391,"['know', 'history', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'interpretation', 'not', 'can', 'take', 'history', 'learn', 'reasoning', 'lack', 'great', 'time', 'history.Riveting', 'say', 'least', 'expect', 'be', 'documentary', 'viewing', 'find', 'anything', 'BBC', 'productions', 'equivalent', 'few', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'history', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'kibitzing.The', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'less', 'six', 'programs', 'program', 'play', 'appropriate', 'title', 'next', 'queen', 'quality', 'writing', 'varies', 'have', 'different', 'writers', 'When', 'first', 'say', 'episode', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'was', 'written', 'Rosemary', 'Ann', 'Sission', 'knew', 'had', 'winner', 'was', 'also', 'screen', 'writer', 'Strong', 'Poison', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', '1987', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'image', 'how', 'amazed', 'was', 'find', 'episode', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'was', 'written', 'even', 'stronger.The', 'unifying', 'element', 'Keith', 'Michell', 'who', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'oops', 'mean', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'out', 'clean', 'shaven', 'pageboy', 'hairstyle', 'up', 'as', 'scruffy', 'personality', 'last', 'play', 'have', 'background', 'information', 'time', 'place', 'fill', 'well', 'describe', 'current', 'events', 'how', 'were', 'influences', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Six', 'Wives']",N/A

Others have mentioned seeing it on PBS, but I clearly remembering it first airing in the U.S. on network TV - I'm fairly sure it was CBS - back in the summer of 1971. Isn't it amazing that in 30 years we went from great historical drama being summer TV fare to schlock like Survivor and Fear Factor?At any rate, this series stars actors and actresses that Americans have probably never seen before since this was entirely a British production. It consists of six episodes - one for each wife - each running 90 minutes in length.  My favorite episodes were those about the second and fifth wives - Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard, respectively. Dorothy Tutin plays the long pursued and then quickly rejected Anne Boleyn, mother of the future Elizabeth I. She is executed on trumped up charges merely because she had failed to produce a male heir and Henry could never come up with an excuse for another divorce just a few years after the first one to Catherine of Aragon. How ironic that it was Anne's daughter Elizabeth - not Henry's son Edward - that was the strong and able monarch and heir Henry had hoped to produce, and the one to clean up the mess he made of England's treasury when she assumed the throne. Katherine Howard, Henry's fifth wife, is the other wife that is executed, although the charges of adultery against her are true. Mitchell does an outstanding job of playing the heartbroken king when he learns of Howard's treachery. The thing is, Katherine Howard's treachery is not so much that as it is the expected outcome of a young healthy 17 year-old girl married to an old man 30 years her senior who can no longer be a real husband to her. She was truly a tragic figure, but typical of that era - a young girl treated as a commodity by her family and placed in an arranged marriage. It is odd that with all of the intelligent and beautiful wives that Henry had, the one that had his heart until the day he died was the shy and plain Jane Seymour, his third wife, mother of his only son, and the only one of his six wives to die a natural death while still his wife..Through all six episodes Keith Mitchell plays Henry the VIII with all the conceited, bombastic, loving, hating and self-indulging qualities that history describes him as having. This is a must-see for lovers of drama, romance, and English history. If you enjoy this series, you might want to consider watching ""Elizabeth R"", starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I.

327252,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302676185,Deborah Earle,"[4, 5]","&quot; The Six Wives of Herny VIII&quot; is a compelling historical drama in which Keith Mitchell, in the title role, recreates the King's life from his athletic youth to his agonizing death, all the while carrying the viewer on an exciting journey of the political and religious intrigues of the day.Accompanying us on this journey are six actresses and sundry supporting cast members who are all worth their mettle. Annette Crosbie plays Henry's first wife, Catalina D' Aragon, the youngest daughter of Spain's King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who becomes a competent regent in her husband's abscence and a devoted wife and mother despite Henry's infidelities. After 20 years of marriage, she is cruelly betrayed by an obscure verse in the Book of Leviticus because of her previous, but allegedly unconsumated marriage to her husband's late brother, Arthur. Her decline in status is tragically reenacted, redeemed by the way she is eulogized by and official at her death.Dorothy Tutin's Anne Boleyn is a boisterous gossip when she first appears on the scene. Her rise in status begins during the first episode, largely because of her role as Catherine of Aragon's most prominent Lady-in-Waiting. Despite her arrogance, and Henry's desire for her, she fails to give Henry a living son, as did Henry's first wife. Her tale moves in a glittering gallop, and she gives Henry the child who will become the greatest of his successors, Elizabeth. But her tale ends with her discreditation, largely with the help of the unscrupulous, Thomas Cromwell, her arrest at a tournament, her imprisonment, trial, during which she displays extreme gallantry despite the false accusations of adultery and incest leveled against her and her brother, George, and finally, with her execution. My heart went out to Mark Smeaton in this production because as I watched this innocent court musician lay his head on the block, what made an impression was the way his eyes were bruised and blackened by the torture imposed on him by Cromwell.Anne's replacement is Jane Seymour, whose gentleness and piety are marvelously emphasized by Anne Stallybrass. This Lady-in-Waiting to Henry's first two Queens begins to feel guilt about replacing a woman she believed to have been wrongfully executed as the King's wife. When her episode begins, we see the dying Queen attending her infant son's baptizim, and the principals of the court over which she presided in attendance, including Alison Frazer's sweetly portrayed Mary, the prodigal daughter to whom Jane restores to her husband's good graces after years of exile in the wake of the King's divorce from her mother, Catherine.While the career of Thomas Cromwell,(played by an appropriately conniving Wolfe Morris, whose resmblance to the real Cromwell is remarkable) may have advanced because of one Anne (Boleyn), another Queen Anne would prove to be his downfall. Seeking to ease his heartbreak over the loss of a wife he truly loved, as well as to strengthen political ties with a Protestant nation, Henry agrees to marry Anna Von Cleves, played by an enchanting and ebullient, Elvi Hale. But he soon realizes that Holbein's portrait of her was more flattering than factual, and the unsophisticated young bride is soon put aside.-The second Foreign-born Princess to be divorced by Henry VIII. In his anger, Henry turns on the very man who helped increase his power over the years, and the end of Henry's fourth marriage finds the unscrupulous lawyer, Cromwell imprisoned and sending the King letters in which he pleads for mercy, something that Anne Boleyn, over whose execution he presided, didn't do even though she had been married to him.Angela Pleasance is the naive young girl who was Anne Boleyn's cousin and Henry VIII' s fith wife. For a modern viewer, her life invites comparisons to the life of Princess Diana.--A promiscuous blue-eyed blonde(although Catherine was promiscuous before her marriage, and Diana wasn't)railroaded into an unhappy Royal marriage at an early age, who finds comfort in the arms of other men, which eventually cost her her life, and when she went down, she took two guys out with her. In Catherine's case, the two guys were Thomas Culpepper and Francis Dereham. Like her cousin before her, Catherine Howard was executed for adultery, but unlike Anne, the charges against her were not trumped up. Lady Mary Rochester, who had covered for her during her extramarital flings, is condemned with her.Last but not least, is the &quot;survivor&quot;, Catherine Parr, who was twice wed and twice widowed before marrying the King. While she is a very fine actress, Rosilie Crutchley bears little resemblance to the real Catherine Parr, a redhead like himself, and like his first wife. Her own desire to marry Jane Seymour's brother, the Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour must be put on hold because of the King's desire to marry her. She tends to the ailing King in his last years, and befriends each of his three children, but barely saves herself from a charge of heresy. After Henry's death, she vows to marry Thomas Seymour, but, like his sister, Jane, her own life would terminate in childbirth.And so, this odyssey involving three Catherines, two Annes, and one Jane comes to an end. While it occassionally goes out of sequence, it is a meticulously created series, with solemly portrayed events in British history.",5,"Divorced, Beheaded, Died...You Know the Rest",1005264000,"11 9,

327254,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6302676185,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[15, 17]","I first watched THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII 30 years ago when it was first broadcast on American television.  Television was a new phenomena then--most homes having acquired a tv set within the previous 10 years.  Televised drama was excellent during the early 1970s--it was not uncommon to see a full-length Broadway Stage Play via a variety of wonderful &quot;playhouses&quot; sponsored by the major networks.  These days, one is only likely to see this quality of entertainment on PBS. WIVES is the typical Masterpiece Theater series PBS does so well.WIVES is extremely well acted. Major talents of the British stage participated in these dramas. Of the actors playing major roles, probably only Annette Crosbie (Catherine of Aragon-Wife #1) will be recognized by contemporary audiences. I kept thinking as I watched her she could have passed for Sissy Spacek's sister when she was younger.  Fans of British comedy will recognize Crosbie as the long-suffering wife from &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; while fans of 'Mystery' and P.D. James will recogize her as the female sleuth and partner of Cordelia Grey in the series &quot;Unsuitable Job for a Woman.&quot;Many other actors who made minor appearances in this series will be recognized by PBS/BBC fans. Marion Mathie (Mrs. Rumpole or &quot;She who must be obeyed&quot;) plays the Duke of Norfolk's wife. The older saleswoman with the multihued hair and &quot;pussy&quot; from &quot;Are you being served&quot; plays Anna von Cleves (wife #4) German attendent. There are many other familiar faces including the actor who plays Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, and it's fun to see who you can identify.The plays themselves--there are six of them, each written by a different playwright--are well dramatized and relatively accurate. Having read Alison Weir's book on the same subject (the six wives), I know Anne Boylyn (wife #2) was badly treated, and I am not sure Jane Seymour (wife #3) was quite as innocent as this BBC play made her. She may have been haunted by the ghost of Anne--or not. The wives are played with sympathy.No matter what your religious background, you will probably find yourself sympathizing with the Catholics--until Catherine Howard and her relatives appear (wife #5). I think an understanding of the background of of the religious wars enhances the viewing of these plays, but it is not necessary, and in my own case was the beginning of a life long interest in the subject.I see another reviewer says his DVD transfer was less than satisfactory. Perhaps it's the original films that are at fault--not the transfer. I actually thought the DVD versions were excellent.

327261,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,6302676185,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[4, 4]","The precursor to another fantastic BBC production (Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson), ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" chronicles the life of the volatile and controversial Tudor monarch. 6 series, written by 6 authors, showcase Henry VIII from a young boy of around 8, to the disease-riddled, corpulent and (rather) pitiful king of 55 (almost 56) upon his death.Keith Michell plays the titular character to astounding perfection. Highlighting his extreme moodiness (when he was up, he was way UP, when he was down, he liked to BEHEAD), limitless power in his own kingdom, Michell's Henry VIII was a veritable enigma of a man and monarch. The casting choice of Michell was spot on, and the costuming/makeup departments must be commended for their close attention to detail. The aging process of Michell's King Hal is fantastic (I especially enjoyed the quite hefty Henry-in his later years-being hoisted onto his horse by a pulley system).The women playing his wives are an especial treat. Annette Crosbie (Katherine of Aragon) and Dorothy Tutin (Anne Boleyn) may have been too mature looking to play a 15 and 19 year old respectively, but both are pitch perfect as they play these powerful women in their later years. Tutin's lightly accented English (which Anne Boleyn was noted for, due to her years spent in the courts of Austria and France) was quite a nice touch for the production and research teams.Anne Stallybrass (Jane Seymour) truly captured Henry's 3rd queen's quiet and meek spirit. Speaking barely above a whisper, and averting her gaze constantly, she transforms herself into the plainest of Henry's consorts (although, supposedly, his most ""beloved""-although that may have been due to the fact that her son, Edward VI, survived). Elvi Hale (Anne of Cleves) provides the most comic relief during her entire screen time. Utilizing a (ridiculous) German accent, her facial expressions belie her every emotion. I had a laughing fit when she views Henry in his ""courtier's"" garb for the first time and says ""oh!!"" Absolute hilarity.Wife number five, Angela Pleasance (Catherine Howard), exhibits a bit of a mean streak against her housemates, and lies to her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, about her virtue. The only wife of Henry VIII to actually ""stray,"" Pleasance shows a fine maturity for such a young actress. Finally, Rosalie Crutchley (Catherine Parr) is a paragon of virtue, learning, and family life. The queen responsible for bringing Elizabeth I back into Henry's good graces, does not want to marry him, but does her duty, and finds herself extremely fond of her husband, and devastated (in her own way) upon his passing.The BBC probably spared no expense (in 1973 currency) during the filming of ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII,"" but the film does show the wear of time. Restoration would enhance the color and sound quality, but this is still a 4.5 star effort because of the extremely talented cast and the lovely detailed touches of the crew.",4,A Life in Six Acts..,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2961,"['precursor', 'fantastic', 'BBC', 'production', 'Elizabeth', 'R.', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'life', 'volatile', 'controversial', 'Tudor', 'monarch', '6', 'series', 'written', '6', 'authors', 'showcase', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'young', 'boy', '8', 'disease-riddled', 'corpulent', 'rather', 'pitiful', 'king', '55', 'almost', '56', 'death.Keith', 'Michell', 'titular', 'character', 'astounding', 'perfection', 'Highlighting', 'extreme', 'moodiness', 'when', 'was', 'up', 'was', 'way', 'UP', 'when', 'was', 'down', 'liked', 'BEHEAD', 'limitless', 'power', 'own', 'kingdom', 'Michell', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'veritable', 'enigma', 'man', 'monarch', 'casting', 'choice', 'Michell', 'was', 'spot', 'costuming/makeup', 'departments', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'aging', 'process', 'Michell', 'King', 'Hal', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'hefty', 'Henry-in', 'later', 'years-being', 'hoisted', 'horse', 'pulley', 'system', 'women', 'playing', 'wives', 'are', 'especial', 'treat', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Dorothy', 'Tutin', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'mature', 'looking', 'play', '15', '19', 'year', 'old', 'respectively', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'play', 'powerful', 'women', 'later', 'years', 'Tutin', 'lightly', 'accented', 'English', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'was', 'noted', 'due', 'years', 'spent', 'courts', 'Austria', 'France', 'was', 'quite', 'nice', 'touch', 'production', 'research', 'teams.Anne', 'Stallybrass', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'truly', 'captured', 'Henry', '3rd', 'queen', 'quiet', 'meek', 'spirit', 'Speaking', 'barely', 'whisper', 'averting', 'gaze', 'constantly', 'plainest', 'Henry', 'consorts', 'supposedly', 'most', 'beloved', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'fact', 'son', 'Edward', 'VI', 'survived', 'Elvi', 'Hale', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'most', 'comic', 'relief', 'entire', 'screen', 'time', 'Utilizing', 'ridiculous', 'German', 'accent', 'facial', 'expressions', 'belie', 'emotion', 'had', 'laughing', 'fit', 'when', 'Henry', 'courtier', 'garb', 'first', 'time', 'oh', 'Absolute', 'hilarity.Wife', 'number', 'five', 'Angela', 'Pleasance', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'bit', 'mean', 'streak', 'housemates', 'uncle', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', 'virtue', 'only', 'wife', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'actually', 'stray', 'Pleasance', 'fine', 'maturity', 'young', 'actress', 'Finally', 'Rosalie', 'Crutchley', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'paragon', 'virtue', 'learning', 'family', 'life', 'queen', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'Elizabeth', 'back', 'Henry', 'good', 'graces', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'duty', 'extremely', 'fond', 'husband', 'devastated', 'own', 'way', 'passing.The', 'BBC', 'probably', 'spared', 'expense', '1973', 'currency', 'filming', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'film', 'show', 'wear', 'time', 'Restoration', 'would', 'enhance', 'color', 'sound', 'quality', 'still', '4.5', 'star', 'effort', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'lovely', 'detailed', 'touches', 'crew']",N/A

327264,AK17ELWV8SMJM,6302676185,"felicitaz ""felicitaz""","[8, 9]","I saw this series as a child, and it profoundly influenced my life, making me an eager historian and costumer ever after. Just a year or so ago, my brother gave this series to me as a gift, and it is even better than I remembered it.The reign of the Tudors followed the War of the Roses, a bloody, chaotic part of British history, characterized by civil war and royal asassinations. The two little princes in the Tower, murdered by order of Richard III, were Henry VIII's uncles. His father, Henry VII, ended the strife by defeating Richard III, and marrying the Yorkist heir, Elizabeth. Their union brought stability to England.You have to keep these events in mind when watching this series, because they make Henry VIII's actions understandable. His seemingly monomaniacal need for a son was his effort to ensure that nothing like the War of the Roses would happen again.This series is for the serious Tudor buff. It comes from the era of BBC productions that were richly intellectual, subtly acted and true to the original material. Also, looking at it again after so many years, I realize what a parade of first class British actors participated: Annette Crosbie, Dame Dorothy Tutin, Patrick (""Dr. Who"") Troughton, Bernard Hepton, and even Mollie (""Are You Being Served"") Sugden.Keith Michell delivers a Henry VIII whom you can hate and yet sympathize with--very human, sometimes weak, sometimes funny. He is a scholar, musician, knight, statesman, victim, tyrant, penitent, cuckold, and philosopher, as events dictate. His Henry is very complex; and one of the pleasures of this production is that you find yourself watching to see which Henry is going to emerge. One can imagine that his wives and courtiers also walked on eggshells, not knowing which facet of his personality might turn itself in them at any given time.Of the six episodes:CATHERINE OF ARAGON: Though Catherine is my favorite of the wives, I don't think this is the best episode, because it has to cover over 25  years of history in a few hours. Annette Crosbie does a fine job of portraying the proud, honorable Catherine. She even resembles portraits of the amber-haired princess. This should really have been 2 episodes. What is there is excellent. What's missing is more of Catherine's large part in the govenment of the realm, a more thorough characterization of Wolsey, of Catherine's father Ferdinand's duplicity, and how both of them in their different ways helped undermine her relationship with Henry. It's a pity Catherine was short-changed in this series, because she's the most interesting of the wives--the only woman Henry VIII really feared, and the only one who could have taken his throne away from him, had she chosen.ANNE BOLEYN: Dorothy Tutin does an excellent job of portraying the historical Anne--not the romance-novel heroine, but the bitch-siren-victim who comes through from contemporary documents and accounts. Without ignoring the ruthless side of her character, she is able to also show a sympathetic Anne as she realizes that her star is on the descendant, and that she is following in the footsteps of Catherine, her deposed predecessor. Anne's notorious rages and hysterical fits are brilliantly done by Ms. Tutin--the terror of a woman who realizes that she's caught in a trap of her own making.JANE SEYMOUR: This is the episode that won an award. It is sensitively done. Very little is known about Jane Seymour, beyond the fact that she was basically a pawn for her powerful family, and that she bore Henry the son he longed for. However, Anne Stallybrass renders a deeply-felt portrait of the kind woman who made peace between Henry and his daugther Mary, and somehow left an unforgettable impression on Henry himself. In this episode, too, we get an interesting view of the cryptic character of Thomas Cromwell (as portrayed by Wolfe Morris) --an urbane, nervous little man with an unsettling habit of suddenly turning lethal.ANNA OF CLEVES: So little is known about this wife that I can't justly complain over the liberties the script writer took with her story and character. I think this is the weakest of the series, because it tries too hard to turn Anna into a modern woman. It seems that they were inspired by ""The Private Life of Henry VIII""--the wedding night scene owes some of its comedy to Elsa Lancaster and Charles Laughton. That said, it's thoroughly enjoyable. I also enjoy the final dinner scene between the happily to-be-divorced couple. In historical fact, once they were divorced, they became good friends. A nice sideline is Mollie Sugden's turn as Anna's maid Lotte. There are one or two scenes where you can see that Mrs. Slocom look on her face, and I quite long to hear her tell Henry to ""Shut your cake hole!""CATHERINE HOWARD: This was the sleeper for me. I'd fogotten how good Angela Pleasance was in the role of the teenaged girl who is made the pawn of the Howard family, and married to the aged Henry VIII. Her monologues are intensely felt and thrilling--reminiscent of her dad's account of first meeting Michael Meyers in ""Halloween"". Patrick Troughton as the hard-edged Duke of Norfolk is brilliant, too. And the broken-down Henry, thoroughly pathetic.CATHERINE PARR: Henry finally acts his age, and marries a widow, the covertly Protestant Catherine Parr. She is portrayed by the classically beautiful Rosalie Crutchley, who is convincing as the stable, kind woman who brought Henry's family all together again, and won the love of his children. One of the best dialogues is at the very beginnng of this episode, between Henry, who is trying to ask Catherine to marry him, and Catherine, who is trying to dodge the question. It's so well-written and funny, that after 10 viewings, it still makes me laugh.This is a long review, but the gist of it is this--somehow, get a hold of this monumental production, and watch it. You'll learn something, not the least of which is-- What makes great drama.",5,"Intelligent, unforgettable, unmatched",1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,5942,"['saw', 'series', 'child', 'profoundly',

327265,A1G9FX1KV45N41,6302676185,Gary Selikow,"[2, 4]","The pageantry, magnificent costumes, background music, background setting was gloriously done and made this series far more engaging to view.The first episode on Catherine of Aragon (played with great pathos and dignity by Annette Crosbie), was sympathetic portrayal and was certainly the best in the series with intelligent dialogue and a real feel for the age. The film certainly captures a sympathy for the dignified stubbornness and total piousness of Henry's first queen, as it does a great performance of the stingy and scheming Henry VII (John Woodnutt). the way the couple grow from being young and attractive into Catherine's older worn character and Henry developing into an overweight scheming tyrant is well portrayed too.But the scriptwriters in the next few episodes seem to suffer from a rather bigoted and archaic view of women judging with out most sympathy the sexually virtuous and staid such as Catherine of Aragon and Jane Seymour (Anne Stallybrass) and total villification of the two queens who were branded 'whores' and murdered on Henry's orders. i.e the puritnaical old portrayal as women as either vrtuous saints or despicable whores.I though The Other Boleyn Girl both the book by Philipa Gregory and the movie starring Natalie Portman was unecessarily unsympathetic to Ann Boleyn , going back over 30 years , it has nothing on this series. It is completely sympathetic to Henry , presents Anne as self-serving, scheming and malicious and all but tries to present the case that she deserved to be executed. The truth must have been different.Katherine Howard played by Angela Pleasance) who was in reality simple and perhaps promiscuous but certainly good hearted and whose cruel fate was perhaps the most callous and detestable of Henry's crimes is here depicted as wanton, scheming, shrewish and everything bad-once again seemingly trying to present the case for Henry and implying she deserved, a victim of power if ever there was one.Although this series was done in 1970 during the height of the sexual revolution, the writers of these pieces still were coloured by a very dour view.Anne of Cleeves (Elvi Hale) is presented in top form as witty and clever.

I recall watching this wonderful series on our little 19"" black and white TV in 1971  and have raved about it to people ever since whenever anything Tudor-related is brought up. The acting was so good, and the history of the times was respected.One reviewer mentioned that the DVD needed freshening. Hers was a 2000 release, while this is a 2006 release, btw.It got me hooked on Tudor history. Since then in my opinion, its hard to find anything in film or historical non-fiction books that don't make me want to wince...or worse.Phillipa Gregory should be ashamed of herself, I think anyway.  The only good thing about her books being best-sellers is perhaps some people will go on to read better written, more accurate Tudor history or historical fiction.As for other older films:  ""Man of All Seasons"" feels dated, as does ""Anne of a Thousand Days"" but they're at least good entries into the field, and were well made. Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth I"" sold as a package with the ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" was excellent, though I read in reviews it appears more dated than the Henry VIII films do. Its's nevertheless a great acting experience to watch.I found the two Elizabeth movies starring Cate Blanchett released in the last few years to be discouraging. Many things were correct historically: the lovely clothes, the feel of the great icy cold castles, the constant fear of being ""out of favor"" and risking death thereby; but others were so far off, it felt like a ""just miss"" to me.....Of course, wondering how serious Elizabeth's relationship with Robert Dudley was is one of those popular and never-to-be-known historical questions. That movie, however, with its' silly concept that Elizabeth I decided to recreate herself as the ""VIRGIN QUEEN"" for all time; a sort of symbol for...something..is ludicrous. She certainly spent a lot of time considering marriage for someone determined to be remembered as the ""Virgin Queen"".The movie made from the Phillipa Gregory book....much was historically based but SO MUCH was based on rumor and theory---some from the time of the Tudors themselves.  Its' too distressing. Makes me feel how I felt when I first read the ""DaVinci Code"". History for the lowest common denominator, and wild theories presented as facts...!In this ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" series, at last we have available good acting, good story telling, honest history, (so far as it is known) and a story that really holds you. Henry's tragedy, his desire for a son and heir, changed all of English history and perhaps even that of W.Europe, as he threw over Catholicism to allow him to marry a younger woman who might give him a son. The tragedies build up, as each queen has some flaw, major or minor, that he cannot abide. THEY of course, were even more tragic figures, losing one's head is after all a bigger tragedy than someone's longing for a male heir. But the women are seen as minor creatures in the big play of history while Henry VIII remains important, a major factor in events of his time and even down to ours, due to his decision to remake the entire religion (and in some ways the culture) of his lands.A well written, well acted piece of film craft that anyone who is interested in that era should own.",5,Best Viewing of the Life of Henry VIII and his Queens/ The standard to which all others should be compared!,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,3295,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'hear', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'recall', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'series', 'little', '19', 'black', 'white', 'TV', '1971', 'have', 'raved', 'people', 'ever', 'whenever', 'anything', 'Tudor-related', 'brought', 'up', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'history', 'times', 'was', 'respected.One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'needed', 'freshening', 'Hers', 'was', '2000', 'release', '2006', 'release', 'btw.It', 'got', 'hooked', 'Tudor', 'history', 'then', 'opinion', 'hard', 'find', 'anything', 'film', 'historical', 'non-fiction', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'wince', 'worse.Phillipa', 'Gregory', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'think', 'anyway', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'books', 'being', 'best-sellers', 'perhaps', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'read', 'better', 'written', 'more', 'accurate', 'Tudor', 'history', 'historical', 'fiction.As', 'other', 'older', 'films', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'feels', 'dated', 'Anne', 'Thousand', 'Days', ""'re"", 'least', 'good', 'entries', 'field', 'were', 'well', 'made', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Elizabeth', 'sold', 'package', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'excellent', 'read', 'reviews', 'more', 'dated', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'films', 'do', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'acting', 'experience', 'watch.I', 'found', 'two', 'Elizabeth', 'movies', 'starring', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'released', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'be', 'discouraging', 'Many', 'things', 'were', 'correct', 'historically', 'lovely', 'clothes', 'feel', 'great', 'icy', 'cold', 'castles', 'constant', 'fear', 'being', 'favor', 'risking', 'death', 'thereby', 'others', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'felt', 'just', 'miss', '..Of', 'course', 'wondering', 'how', 'serious', 'Elizabeth', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'was', 'one', 'popular', 'never-to-be-known', 'historical', 'questions', 'movie', 'however', 'silly', 'concept', 'Elizabeth', 'decided', 'recreate', 'VIRGIN', 'QUEEN', 'time', 'sort', 'symbol', 'something..is', 'ludicrous', 'certainly', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'considering', 'marriage', 'someone', 'determined', 'be', 'remembered', 'Virgin', 'Queen', '.The', 'movie', 'made', 'Phillipa', 'Gregory', 'book', '.much', 'was', 'historically', 'based', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'was', 'based', 'rumor', 'theory', 'time', 'Tudors', 'too', 'distressing', 'Makes', 'feel', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'History', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'wild', 'theories', 'presented', 'facts', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'series', 'last', 'have', 'available', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'honest', 'history', 'so', 'far', 'known', 'story', 'really', 'Henry', 'tragedy', 'desire', 'son', 'heir', 'changed', 'English', 'history', 'perhaps', 'even', 'W.Europe', 'threw', 'over', 'Catholicism', 'allow', 'marry', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'might', 'give', 'son', 'tragedies', 'build', 'up', 'queen', 'flaw', 'major', 'minor', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'THEY', 'course', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'figures', 'losing', 'one', 'head', 'bigger', 'tragedy', 'someone', 'longing', 'male', 'heir', 'women', 'are', 'seen', 'minor', 'creatures', 'big', 'play', 'history', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'important', 'major', 'factor', 'events', 'time', 'even', 'down', 'ours', 'due', 'decision', 'remake', 'entire', 'religion', 'ways', 'culture', 'lands.A', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'piece', 'film', 'craft', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'era', 'should', 'own']",N/A

I prefer the later episodes where there is more court intrigue, politics and fights over the future of the Church of England.(2) I found the writers didn't really know what to make of Anne Boleyn. At first she seems to be an ambitious, scheming woman who does everything possible to push Catherine of Aragon aside, including supporting the executions of Fisher and Thomas More. Later she becomes something of a shrew, publicly berating her husband for taking mistresses, even though her brother warned her to accept things they way they were and to keep her mouth shut.At the end, when apparently falsely accused of treason and adultery she becomes a saintly martyr figure who denounces those who conduct the farcical trial and she faces death bravely and with much religious faith.(3) Thomas Cromwell is a key figure in the reign of Henry VIII. He was a commoner who reached the highest positions of power in the court. Yet, in the Anne of Cleves episode, he seems to turn against his master and accuses him of being a monster, after doing so much to help him in his struggles to break church ties with Rome and to confiscating Church property, in addition to working very hard to remove those prominent people who stood in his way. It is not made clear exactly how the King decided to have Cromwell executed other than we see that the King was angry at Cromwell's pushing Anne of Cleves on him and the fact that Cromwell had many powerful enemies at court. It is said that the King later regretted having him executed.Having said this, I still find it a real pleasure to watch the series, and I particularly love seeing the costumes which are taken from famous portraits made at the time of the characters.

True, I could pick nits in chronology and other areas but that would spoil the fun. So I watch them, or read them, and just plain enjoy most of them.This one is a standout. Although it is impossible to show an entire reign in 90-minute segments, each of these six dramas does a great job of showing significant areas in the lives of Henry and his six wives. We see Henry grow from youth (but with an unfortunate wig) to old age -- his intellectual prowess in theology, languages, music; his physicality and athletic feats. In spite of his genuine intellectual gifts, however, he was erratic, temperamental, inconsistent, vain. Given the scope of events during Henry's reign, it is often difficult to realize how short his life was. He became king at 17, married Catherine of Aragon at 18, and died at 56.I am always amazed at how well the British do these historical dramas, especially their ability to find excellent actors who can be made to look very much like the people they portray, down to details of clothing and jewelry seen in portraits.Keith Michell is superb as Henry VIII -- but over the top? Well, it's an accurate portayal. Henry himself was over the top in everything he did, whether debating theology, coping with ambitious couriers, eating and drinking, in dress, chasing women, you name it -- a true loose cannon in every sense. The six wives are very good too, with Annette Crosbie a standout as Catherine of Aragon. The casts are full of wonderful character actors. The late Patrick Troughton, who played the scarily cold and ambitious Duke of Norfolk, is a favorite of mine. I first saw him as the scatty Second Doctor and didn't realize how good an actor he was until I saw him in other roles.The stories themselves are well written, although I thought the one about Anne Boleyn dwelt too long on grisly torture scenes and her imprisonment and execution. It was probably also a little difficult to write about Catherine Howard, since we don't know enough about her to know whether she was motivated by lust or fear of not producing an heir or simply not being well enough educated to hold her own in Henry's court. She was also very young, probably not 21 yet when she was executed. It would have been interesting to show that Anne of Cleves survived Henry, living happily and peacefully in England for the rest of her life, long enough to see his daughter Mary crowned Queen.The reason I didn't give this DVD set a 5-star rating is that it includes as an extra the soap opera-like episode about Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne, apparently filmed later.

327273,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,6302676185,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[78, 81]","""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" is the original BBC series of six 90 minute plays chronicling the reign and marriages of England's King Henry VIII. Each of the six plays or segments,  ""Katherine Aragon"", ""Anne Boleyn"", ""Jane Seymour"", ""Anne Of Cleves"", ""Catherine Howard"" and ""Catherine Parr,"" is written by a different author. The series was released to great popular and critical acclaim in 1971 and televised on PBS' Masterpiece Theater. This is a three-disc DVD boxed set, with two 90-minute teleplays per disc (one per spouse). Keith Michell is outstanding as the multiple-married monarch. From a boisterous, athletic, handsome Hal, at the time of his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, (Annette Crosbie), the superb Michell, and make-up, transform the king before our eyes to a porcine, tyrannical, and sickly ruler. Although each drama is limited in scope due to time restrictions, the monarch's personal and political reasons for selecting and/or rejecting, (or beheading), his spouses are depicted to some extent.""My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He was a blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.""  Thus Mark Twain describes our protagonist in ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" As this series demonstrates, Henry was not quite the womanizer he is reputed to be. He was married to Katharine of Aragon for over twenty years and had just a few mistresses before this - unusual for a prince.  He waited years to physically consummate his relationship with Anne Boleyn, and remained faithful to her until marriage.Each of the actresses who play Henry's wives was able to find the core of her historical character, her queen, and lend the woman an air of dignity and individuality. Annette Crosbie is magnificent as Katherine of Aragon, the first wife. Her role is the largest as her relationship with Henry VIII was the longest. Dorothy Tutin is a most credible Anne Boleyn, but little time is spent on her very romantic courtship by the king. Most of Anne's story is focused on the role her marriage played in Henry's divorce and the split with the Catholic Church, which sets the stage for the English Reformation. Anne Stallybrass is Jane Seymour, who is extremely important in Tudor history because she is the only wife who gives Henry a male heir. He always said he loved Jane the best and was buried beside her. I wonder if she was so favored because she played such a small part in her husband's life, not only time-wise - she died from puerperal fever after only seventeen months of marriage - but because she was a sort of ""homebody."" After some minor political meddling, Jane was warned by the king to stay away from politics, and reminded of her predecessor's fate. She learned her lesson and no longer interfered in the monarch's affairs. Elvie Hale is Anne of Cleves, the most politically astute of Henry's wives, and certainly the one with the best survival skills. She was glad, ultimately, to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head. Catherine Howard, Henry's ""blushing rose without a thorn,"" is played to the hilt by Angela Pleasence, and her's is a terribly tragic tale. And Rosalie Cruthley plays the part of the brilliant and intellectual Catherine Parr extremely well. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, especially Bernard Hepton as Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, Wolfe Morris as Thomas Cromwell, and Verina Greenlaw as Princess Mary.I think, overall, that this is an excellent production, although not perfect. There are some silly errors that could have been prevented with more attention to detail, like visible microphones. It is also evident the quality of technology we take for granted today was not available in the early 1970's. Thus, the DVDs are not very good. In fact, I would recommend that you purchase the VHS edition, if you have a DVD/VHS player. The DVD set is much more expensive and the options one usually expects with DVD, like the scene index, are not offered.JANA",3,"An Excellent Production, But DVD Quality Is Sorely Lacking",1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,4175,"['Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'original', 'BBC', 'series', 'six', '90', 'minute', 'plays', 'chronicling', 'reign', 'marriages', 'England', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'six', 'plays', 'segments', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'written', 'different', 'author', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'great', 'popular', 'critical', 'acclaim', '1971', 'televised', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'three-disc', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'two', '90-minute', 'teleplays', 'disc', 'one', 'spouse', 'Keith', 'Michell', 'outstanding', 'multiple-married', 'monarch', 'boisterous', 'athletic', 'handsome', 'Hal', 'time', 'marriage', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'superb', 'Michell', 'make-up', 'transform', 'king', 'eyes', 'porcine', 'tyrannical', 'sickly', 'ruler', 'drama', 'limited', 'scope', 'due', 'time', 'restrictions', 'monarch', 'personal', 'political', 'reasons', 'selecting', 'and/or', 'rejecting', 'beheading', 'spouses', 'are', 'depicted', 'extent', 'My', 'ought', 'seen', 'old', 'Henry', 'Eight', 'when', 'was', 'bloom', 'was', 'blossom', 'used', 'marry', 'new', 'wife', 'day', 'chop', 'off', 'head', 'morning', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'indifferent', 'was', 'ordering', 'up', 'eggs', 'Thus', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'protagonist', 'Adventures', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'series', 'Henry', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'womanizer', 'reputed', 'be', 'was', 'married', 'Katharine', 'Aragon', 'twenty', 'years', 'had', 'just', 'few', 'mistresses', 'unusual', 'prince', 'waited', 'years', 'physically', 'consummate', 'relationship', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'remained', 'faithful', 'marriage.Each', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Henry', 'wives', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'core', 'historical', 'character', 'queen', 'lend', 'woman', 'air', 'dignity', 'individuality', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'magnificent', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'first', 'wife', 'role', 'largest', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'longest', 'Dorothy', 'Tutin', 'most', 'credible', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'very', 'romantic', 'courtship', 'king', 'Most', 'Anne', 'story', 'focused', 'role', 'marriage', 'played', 'Henry', 'divorce', 'split', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'stage', 'English', 'Reformation', 'Anne', 'Stallybrass', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'extremely', 'important', 'Tudor', 'history', 'only', 'wife', 'who', 'Henry', 'male', 'heir', 'always', 'said', 'loved', 'Jane', 'best', 'was', 'buried', 'wonder', 'was', 'so', 'favored', 'played', 'small', 'part', 'husband', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'time-wise', 'died', 'puerperal', 'fever', 'only', 'seventeen', 'months', 'marriage', 'was', 'sort', 'homebody', 'minor', 'political', 'meddling', 'Jane', 'was', 'warned', 'king', 'stay', 'away', 'politics', 'reminded', 'predecessor', 'fate', 'learned', 'lesson', 'longer', 'interfered', 'monarch', 'affairs', 'Elvie', 'Hale', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'most', 'politically', 'astute', 'Henry', 'wives', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'survival', 'skills', 'was', 'glad', 'ultimately', 'be', 'cast-off', 'allowed', 'keep', 'head', 'Catherine', 'Howard', 'Henry', 'blushing', 'rose', 'thorn', 'played', 'hilt', 'Angela', 'Pleasence', ""'s"", 'terribly', 'tragic', 'tale', 'Rosalie', 'Cruthley', 'part', 'brilliant', 'intellectual', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'fortunate', 'become', 'aware', 'plot', 'met', 'same', 'end', 'Queens', 'Anne', 'Katherine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'especially', 'Bernard', 'Hepton', 'Archbishop', 'Thomas', 'Cranmer', 'Wolfe', 'Morris', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'Verina', 'Greenlaw', 'Princess', 'Mary.I', 'think', 'overall', 'excellent', 'production', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'silly', 'errors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'prevented', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'visible', 'microphones', 'also', 'evident', 'quality', 'technology', 'take', 'granted', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'early', '1970', 'Thus', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'VHS', 'edition', 'have', 'DVD/VHS', 'player', 'DVD', 'set', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', 'options', 'one', 'usually', 'DVD', 'scene', 'index', 'are', 'not', 'offered.JANA']",N/A

There's no more perfect Henry VIII than Keith Michell, who flawlessly portrays the monarch from a slender, idealistic 18-year-old youth to a grossly fat, paranoid, and diseased old man of 55.  The actresses who portray his six wives - Annette Crosbie, Dorothy Tutin, Anne Stallybrass, Elvi Hale, Angela Pleasence, and Rosalie Crutchley - give dazzling, deeply nuanced performances as six queens of differing appearances, ages, backgrounds and personalities, with Henry VIII as the link that connects them all together.

327275,A1W98Q4MZK80VA,6302676185,Joseph P. Tevington,"[3, 7]","History's most famous case of spousal abandonment took place nearly 500 years ago. Henry VIII of England was married to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella (Yup, the same Ferdinand and Isabella who sent Columbus on his supposed 'round the world trip.).  The world and the Church were torn apart (and remain so) by the unbridled selfishness and lusts of Henry VIII, who tried to coerce the Church into giving him an invalid annulment. While Bishop John Fisher andSir Thomas Moreare now recognized as saints for their courageous stands for Truth,part one of this fabulous BBC productionhighlights the saintliness of the victim of that abandonment, herself.On ""K[C]atherine of Aragon: the Official Website for Her Cause,"" there is a position paper on* ""the central figure of the English Reformation....[who] - for her nearly 36 years in England - embraced the power and comfort of prayer....After nearly twenty years of wedlock, Katharine sat there - stunned - listening to this man whom she adored tell her their marriage was sinful, asking her to go away while the matter was sorted out....She was fearless before men who easily could have done her harm....On 7 January 1536 at age 50 Katharine of Aragon - Queen of England - died. That same day she wrote her final letter to the man who had betrayed her, but whom she still loved. Even with its mild rebukes, it is a letter of love and forgiveness....* ""easily could she have accepted the title of Dowager Princess of Wales and lived a rich, royal life or retired to a convent. Yet she refused these things because had she not, she would have been untrue to herself, her child, her country, her heritage, her faith, and her God. She was the rightful queen....By taking this course, she trusted to the will of God whatever that course was or where it would take her....It is her cause and her faith that inspired every person who died at the hands of both Henry and later, Elizabeth, to go to their deaths bravely....* ""Katharine's defense of the sacrament of marriage is perhaps her tie and relevance to the modern world. In an age where the sanctity of marriage is all but disregarded, she stands - 475 years later - as the model defender of the sacrament of marriage....in the last moments of her life she held fast to her faith - forgiving the one person who had betrayed her above all others - yet whom she loved still. This is the essence of holiness - the essence of Jesus's message in the Gospels; the message of love and forgiveness.""This past March, the Catholic News Agency published an article, which inadvertently reminds us of the relevance of Catherine's heroism and saintliness:*""There is abundant research to affirm the dire consequences of divorce for children....As Catholics who believe in the sanctity and permanence of the marriage vow, we can understand why things go drastically wrong when that vow is breached....What we may not know is that most divorces are situations in which one person wants to end the marriage while the other is fighting to save it....*""We must fight our tendency to look the other way in the name of discretion or a false sense of charity....As Catholics, we have moral obligations when we know someone who has abandoned his or her family in order to seek a divorce. We have a duty to stand in solidarity with the spouse who has been left behind, and with any children who might be involved....*""The message to the abandoner must be this: 'What you have done is contrary to God's plan for you and your family. We are praying you will return home and seek the counseling needed to heal your marriage. Once you decide to return to your family, you will have our full support. Until then, please do not expect us to condone your action by pretending it hasn't happened'....*""We need a renewed effort on the part of bishops and priests to recognize that spousal abandonment is a crisis in our Church. Church leaders need to acknowledge this -- and they need to encourage new, more effective responses in our parishes and chanceries....In a world that would have us believe that divorce is just an opportunity for a new start, the Church's message must be loud and clear: We will hold fast to our ancient teachings on marriage - for the sake of our souls, our families, and our civilization"" (Hillary Towers, PhD, It is time for the Church to face up to the crisis of spousal abandonment, 3/4/01).",5,Catherine of Aragon - History's Most Famous Victim of Spousal Abandonment,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,4411,"['History', 'most', 'famous', 'case', 'spousal', 'abandonment', 'took', 'place', 'nearly', '500', 'years', 'ago', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'England', 'was', 'married', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'daughter', 'Ferdinand', 'Isabella', 'Yup', 'same', 'Ferdinand', 'Isabella', 'who', 'sent', 'Columbus', 'supposed', 'world', 'trip.', 'world', 'Church', 'were', 'torn', 'apart', 'remain', 'so', 'unbridled', 'selfishness', 'lusts', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'who', 'tried', 'coerce', 'Church', 'giving', 'invalid', 'annulment', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Fisher', 'Thomas', 'Moreare', 'now', 'recognized', 'saints', 'courageous', 'stands', 'Truth', 'part', 'one', 'fabulous', 'BBC', 'saintliness', 'victim', 'abandonment', 'herself.On', 'K', '[', 'C', ']', 'atherine', 'Aragon', 'Official', 'Website', 'Her', 'Cause', 'position', 'paper', 'central', 'figure', 'English', 'Reformation', '[', 'who', ']', 'nearly', '36', 'years', 'England', 'embraced', 'power', 'comfort', 'prayer', '.After', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'wedlock', 'Katharine', 'sat', 'stunned', 'listening', 'man', 'whom', 'adored', 'tell', 'marriage', 'was', 'sinful', 'asking', 'go', 'away', 'matter', 'was', 'sorted', 'out', '.She', 'was', 'fearless', 'men', 'who', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'harm', '7', 'January', '1536', 'age', '50', 'Katharine', 'Aragon', 'Queen', 'England', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'wrote', 'final', 'letter', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'betrayed', 'whom', 'still', 'loved', 'Even', 'mild', 'rebukes', 'letter', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'accepted', 'title', 'Dowager', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'lived', 'rich', 'royal', 'life', 'retired', 'convent', 'refused', 'things', 'because', 'had', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'untrue', 'herself', 'child', 'country', 'heritage', 'faith', 'God', 'was', 'rightful', 'queen', '.By', 'taking', 'course', 'trusted', 'will', 'God', 'course', 'was', 'where', 'would', 'take', '.It', 'cause', 'faith', 'inspired', 'person', 'who', 'died', 'hands', 'Henry', 'later', 'Elizabeth', 'go', 'deaths', 'bravely', 'Katharine', 'defense', 'sacrament', 'marriage', 'perhaps', 'tie', 'relevance', 'modern', 'world', 'age', 'where', 'sanctity', 'marriage', 'disregarded', '475', 'years', 'later', 'model', 'defender', 'sacrament', 'marriage', 'last', 'moments', 'life', 'held', 'fast', 'faith', 'forgiving', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'betrayed', 'others', 'yet', 'whom', 'loved', 'still', 'essence', 'holiness', 'essence', 'Jesus', 'message', 'Gospels', 'message', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'past', 'March', 'Catholic', 'News', 'Agency', 'published', 'article', 'inadvertently', 'relevance', 'Catherine', 'heroism', 'saintliness', '*', 'abundant', 'research', 'affirm', 'dire', 'consequences', 'divorce', 'children', '.As', 'Catholics', 'who', 'believe', 'sanctity', 'permanence', 'marriage', 'vow', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'things', 'go', 'drastically', 'wrong', 'when', 'vow', 'breached', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'most', 'divorces', 'are', 'situations', 'one', 'person', 'end', 'marriage', 'other', 'fighting', 'save', 'must', 'fight', 'tendency', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'name', 'discretion', 'false', 'sense', 'charity', '.As', 'Catholics', 'have', 'moral', 'obligations', 'when', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'abandoned', 'family', 'order', 'seek', 'divorce', 'have', 'duty', 'stand', 'solidarity', 'spouse', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'children', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'involved', 'message', 'abandoner', 'must', 'be', ""'What"", 'have', 'done', 'contrary', 'God', 'plan', 'family', 'are', 'praying', 'will', 'return', 'home', 'seek', 'counseling', 'needed', 'heal', 'marriage', 'decide', 'return', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'full', 'support', 'then', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'condone', 'action', 'pretending', ""n't"", 'happened', '.*', 'need', 'renewed', 'effort', 'part', 'bishops', 'priests', 'recognize', 'spousal', 'abandonment', 'crisis', 'Church', 'Church', 'leaders', 'need', 'acknowledge', 'need', 'encourage', 'new', 'more', 'effective', 'responses', 'parishes', 'chanceries', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'divorce', 'just', 'opportunity', 'new', 'start', 'Church', 'message', 'must', 'be', 'loud', 'clear', 'will', 'hold', 'fast', 'ancient', 'teachings', 'marriage', 'sake', 'souls', 'families', 'civilization', 'Hillary', 'Towers', 'PhD', 'time', 'Church', 'face', 'up', 'crisis', 'spousal', 'abandonment', '3/4/01']",N/A

Keith Michell is probably the best Henry VIII, changing from a slim, soft-spoken but virile youth, deeply in love with his first wife, to a prematurely bald, white-haired ""stinking hill of guts,"" with his temperament changing to match his appearance.  He's mostly an unlikable character (as the real Henry was), yet he's never boring because he's never completely sucked in by his courtiers' phoniness and hidden agendas.  Henry isn't the real villain of the piece, since the villainy is parceled out to his unscrupulous flunkies like Thomas Cromwell and Bishop Gardiner, whose plotting and backstabbing ought to convince that dirty politics is nothing new.  Part of the pleasure in watching is that these sharks end up being eaten themselves, so people who plot others' downfall usually experience the same fate.The six actresses who play the wives are all superb, especially the late Dorothy Tutin as ill-fated Anne Boleyn, the quintessential ""home-wrecker"" who pays the ultimate price for her scheming.  Anne is hardly a likable character, but Tutin manages to tug on the audience's heart-strings as she meets her end.  Also fine is the very young Angela Pleasance (daughter of Donald Pleasance) as fifth wife Katherine Howard, pretty but also manipulative and scheming and amazingly quick at learning how useful it is in the court to be a convincing liar.  In one scene she soothingly consoles the impotent Henry following their wedding night, but in the next scene breaks down in tears as she tells her maid how disgusted she was at the sight of Henry's aged carcass, so that we almost forgive her for rushing into a very foolish affair with one of Henry's aides, plus we sympathize with her as she is manipulated by her devious uncle the Duke of Norfolk.  The 4th episode, Anne of Cleves, goes off the rails historically, for the real Anne was what we would call an airhead, and she could barely communicate in English, but the episode is interesting as historical fiction, showing the cast-off wife flattering Henry to preserve her own head.Acting is superb, so are the costumes.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the sets are quite blah, with nary a portrait or a tapestry to be seen anywhere.  But if you focus on the dialogue and the nuances of these fine actors' faces, you'll have a wonderful time.  One reason I don't give this 5 stars is that, alas, there are no subtitles, so someone not well-read in English history is bound to miss a word here and there.  But for the most part the story is easy to follow, and it's an enjoyable way to absorb some fascinating history about a larger-than-life yet very human king and his corrupt court.",4,"Focus on the acting, not the technicals",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,3035,"['Let', 'admit', 'right', 'off', 'mini-series', '1970', 'not', 'LOOK', 'as', 'good', 'recent', 'productions', 'Tudors', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'two', 'Elizabeth', 'movies', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'sets', 'are', 'minimal', 'lighting', 'bit', 'flat', 'sound', 'not', 'highest', 'quality', 'Still', 'truly', 'memorable', 'acting', 'working', 'very', 'literate', 'scripts', 'peer', 'Keith', 'Michell', 'probably', 'best', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'changing', 'slim', 'soft-spoken', 'virile', 'youth', 'deeply', 'love', 'first', 'wife', 'prematurely', 'bald', 'white-haired', 'stinking', 'hill', 'guts', 'temperament', 'changing', 'match', 'appearance', 'mostly', 'unlikable', 'character', 'real', 'Henry', 'was', 'yet', 'never', 'boring', 'never', 'completely', 'sucked', 'courtiers', 'phoniness', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'real', 'villain', 'piece', 'villainy', 'parceled', 'out', 'unscrupulous', 'flunkies', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'Bishop', 'Gardiner', 'plotting', 'backstabbing', 'ought', 'convince', 'dirty', 'politics', 'nothing', 'new', 'Part', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'sharks', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'eaten', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'plot', 'others', 'downfall', 'usually', 'experience', 'same', 'fate.The', 'six', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'wives', 'are', 'superb', 'especially', 'late', 'Dorothy', 'Tutin', 'ill-fated', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'quintessential', 'home-wrecker', 'who', 'ultimate', 'price', 'scheming', 'Anne', 'hardly', 'likable', 'character', 'Tutin', 'tug', 'audience', 'heart-strings', 'end', 'Also', 'fine', 'very', 'young', 'Angela', 'Pleasance', 'daughter', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'fifth', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Howard', 'pretty', 'also', 'manipulative', 'scheming', 'amazingly', 'quick', 'learning', 'how', 'useful', 'court', 'be', 'convincing', 'liar', 'one', 'scene', 'soothingly', 'impotent', 'Henry', 'following', 'wedding', 'night', 'next', 'scene', 'breaks', 'down', 'tears', 'maid', 'how', 'disgusted', 'was', 'sight', 'Henry', 'aged', 'carcass', 'almost', 'forgive', 'rushing', 'very', 'foolish', 'affair', 'one', 'Henry', 'aides', 'sympathize', 'manipulated', 'devious', 'uncle', 'Duke', 'Norfolk', '4th', 'episode', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'rails', 'historically', 'real', 'Anne', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'airhead', 'could', 'barely', 'communicate', 'English', 'episode', 'interesting', 'historical', 'fiction', 'showing', 'cast-off', 'wife', 'flattering', 'Henry', 'preserve', 'own', 'head.Acting', 'superb', 'so', 'are', 'costumes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'sets', 'are', 'quite', 'blah', 'portrait', 'tapestry', 'be', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'focus', 'dialogue', 'nuances', 'fine', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wonderful', 'time', 'One', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'alas', 'are', 'subtitles', 'so', 'someone', 'not', 'well-read', 'English', 'history', 'bound', 'miss', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'absorb', 'fascinating', 'history', 'larger-than-life', 'yet', 'very', 'human', 'king', 'corrupt', 'court']",N/A

Written by six different playwrights, they are uniformly excellent. While the production values are not high, that is because these plays were part of a televised series for which there were budgetary constraints. Although the makeup is noticable, the sets are uninspired, and the lighting is harsh, the costumes, however, are gorgeous. More important, the acting is superb.King Henry VIII is played to perfection by Keith Mitchell. He has set the standard by which all others in the part will be judged, and he is the linchpin around whom the entire series revolves. He plays the young, athletic, erudite, golden king in the first tape, and the viewer watches him age and deteriorate throughout the entire series, until he finally becomes the sore riddled, morbidly obese, self absorbed, tyrannical hulk of his later years.Each one of the six wives has her own unique story. The plays tell that story, each a first rate drama unto itself that segues into the next one seamlessly. All the queens are portrayed by very talented thespians, and the supporting cast is superlative. All in all, this series provides a fully absorbing historical drama that should not be missed. It is through the story of each of the wives that one is able to see England transform itself from a catholic country to a protestant one.

327283,A25KKXUQQ0OLWB,6302676185,"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher""","[0, 1]","This is just a great production of The Six Wives of Henry VIII.  It was sensational in 1970 (in the US, 1972) and is sensational now.  The restoration is very good and I appreciate the work that went into it.  Some people may be put off by the videotape and stark lighting and contrasts but the BBC didn't have much money.  You can still see a bit of problem today with production values.  They just don't have as much money.What the BBC does have is dedication to quality shows, acting, writing and direction.  This show is beautifully written and acted at every turn.  The direction is fine also.  It is difficult to create a 90 minute production out of every wife Henry had.  All the wives get equal time here.  Catherine was Henry's wife for many years.  Instead of only showing the end of their marriage, the show also brings out what she went through before she married him.  He made her wait 7 years before he finally committed himself to marry her and she lived off of the dowry she was supposed to give him.  She couldn't leave because of the disgrace of being rejected.  Catherine was married to Henry's brother but he died shortly after at age 15.  Anne, the most pivotal marriage is picked up after the wedding.  The marriage ultimately lasted only two and a half years.  Jane lasted a year and the episode about her is very poignant since she died giving birth to a son for him.  Anne of Cleves was a washout.  He married her for only 5 months and she was lucky to escape with her head and volunteered to take care of his children.  Catherine got her head chopped off, her cousin was Anne Boleyn, didn't she think?  Catherine Parr could have got her head chopped for conflicts with religion.  She was lucky.

My favorite episode, perhaps surprisingly, is the Anne of Cleves story.  Anne of Cleves is probably the wife about whom the least is known, but in her episode she is depicted as tart, resillient, politically astute, caring and generous, and perhaps surprisingly, as more than a match for the by then bloated, arrogant and thoroughly spoiled Henry VIII.  Anne gets her happy ending, in that the monster divorces her, makes a good financial settlement with her, and remains on cordial terms with her as he careens through life with subsequent wives.

Keith Mitchell has Henry down to a tee!  Moody, spoiled, indulgent, and RUTHLESS!  If you were a woman back then, even the Queen, you were expendable!  The first two plays &quot;Catherine of Aragon&quot; and &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; are heartbreaking!  Both women were used and disposed of very cruelly, and while Anne was certainly no saint, she was beheaded due to totally false charges.  All of the plays are marvelous and so accurate, it's like reading a history text, only much more exciting!  &quot;Jane Seymour&quot; is also wonderfully done.  Jane obeyed and pretty much did what she was told, but it is obvious in the play, and also in history, that she may have been the woman that Henry truly did love. That is, if he was capable of the emotion.  Still, Mr. Mitchell has some very hilarious moments throughout these six tapes, huffing and blustering around and throwing tantrums.

Keith Michell's portrayal of Henry Tudor from a young man to an aging monarch is astounding.I first saw this production on TV as part of Masterpiece Theatre, and the images I saw were produced by 1970s technology. So I'm not going to complain about not seeing what I never saw anyway. (I actually own the DVD set, but our player died, so I haven't seen it yet. But the picture HAS to be better than the one on my parents' TV set.)As for the production values, *I* thought they were good.

But I HAVE recently viewed *that* series, and didn't find the production ""stagey""-looking at all, then or now, so I really don't know that the fuss is about. But then, I'm a boomer; I grew up without CGI and don't feel I'm the worse for it. I'm just grateful that the recording is available.Like ""I, Claudius"", the segments (one to each wife) are cleverly written and well acted. To me, Michell is the definitive Henry. All of the episodes are marvellous, but the episode closest to my heart is that devoted to Henry and Anne of Cleves, Wife Number 4.This is not ""The Tudors,"" currently showing on cable TV(is it me, or anyone else here confused about which actor is supposed to be Henry?
