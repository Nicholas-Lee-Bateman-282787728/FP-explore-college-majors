Anderson's performance, in particular, was poignant and unforgettable.  I wish HBO would bring the show back, preferably for four more seasons to give Daniel Knauf the chance to bring his story to completion, but at least for one movie - with the same actors - to try to bring some sort of conclusion to the story.

That is what has happened to Carnivale. The show seemed to drop out of the sky fully formed and blow away those ready to immerse themselves in the show's considerable depths. Sometimes this seems less like a TV show and more like a very, very long movie. The acting by Nick Stahl, Clea DuVall, Clancy Brown, Amy Madigan as well as the rest of the absolutely stellar cast is flawless and you are drawn into their world so completely you can smell the pitch and feel the dust in your throat.Religiously themed shows generally don't do well on TV, especially when they challenge the smug self-satisfaction of the religious establishment. watching Carnivale you can't help but think of current events especially as the demonic Brother Justin builds his own politically-driven megachurch in the California desert. Carnivale shows us what the headlines are finally revealing to the sleep-walking American public- that our media, politicians and religious leaders are corrupt and self-serving and manipulative. Perhaps America wasn't yet ready to hear that message that all of today's prosecutions and scandals are forcing us to confront.The life of the ""carnies"" is only a backdrop to the spiritual struggles taking place between those like Justin who use their supernatural power for death and destruction and the accumulation of power and those like Ben Hawkins who resist the lure of worldly power and wealth if it means sacrificing their souls. The scenes where Ben shows his power are so stunningly beautiful and poetic they will leave you breathless. If you are a fan of shows like Lost, the X Files or Twin Peaks, Carnivale is a must for you. If you were a fan of Stephen King's the Stand but were disappointed by the mini-series, give Carnivale a try. It touches on many of the same themes and adds an exotic (and erotic) flair that you won't find in that novel.The only problem with this set is that it's the only one out there- HBO has yet to release the second season. Buy this amazing series- plainly some of the best popular entertainment of our lifetime - and write to HBO and demand they release season two immediately. Sadly, we won't see a third season of this masterpiece, but season two ended on a tantalizingly ambiguous note that will leave viewers pondering possible outcomes for years to come.",5,TOO GOOD FOR TELEVISION?

One quickly gets the feeling that they started running out of things to say by this track judging by the lengthy lulls between comments.The final disc has a Making Of featurette. Knauf felt that the inner workings of a carnival had never been dramatized before. The cast and crew talk about their characters and the themes of the show.Ultimately, Carnivale poses a lot of questions. How did Ben and Justin get their powers and why them? How does Ben's fevered dreams of a man fighting in the bloody, dirty trenches of World War I figure in his past and that of the mysterious owner of the carnival whom we never see (and might not even be human)? By the end of the season there are precious few answers but some tantalizing clues that will hopefully be explored in more detail in the upcoming season.",4,"An atmospheric, moody struggle of good vs. evil",1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,1674,"['Carnivale', 'TV', 'show', 'seemingly', 'came', 'nowhere', 'debuted', 'HBO', '2003', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'light', 'vs.', 'darkness', 'how', 'are', 'forever', 'intertwined', 'battle', 'place', 'Depression', 'focus', 'inner', 'workings', 'traveling', 'carnival.Disc', 'One', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Milfay', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'series', 'creator', 'Daniel', 'Knauf', 'executive', 'producer', 'Howard', 'Klein', 'very', 'informative', 'track', 'participants', 'making', 'good', 'observations.There', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ball', 'director', 'Jeremy', 'Podeswa', 'Klein', 'Knauf', 'talk', 'casting', 'certain', 'characters', 'people', 'who', 'looked', 'came', 'time', 'period.Disc', 'Five', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Hot', 'Bothered', 'Podeswa', 'Klein', 'Knauf', 'talk', 'look', 'show', 'One', 'quickly', 'feeling', 'started', 'running', 'out', 'things', 'say', 'track', 'judging', 'lengthy', 'lulls', 'comments.The', 'final', 'disc', 'Making', 'featurette', 'Knauf', 'felt', 'inner', 'workings', 'carnival', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'dramatized', 'before', 'cast', 'crew', 'talk', 'characters', 'themes', 'show.Ultimately', 'Carnivale', 'lot', 'questions', 'How', 'did', 'Ben', 'Justin', 'get', 'powers', 'why', 'How', 'Ben', 'fevered', 'dreams', 'man', 'fighting', 'bloody', 'dirty', 'trenches', 'World', 'War', 'figure', 'past', 'mysterious', 'owner', 'carnival', 'whom', 'never', 'see', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'human', 'end', 'season', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'answers', 'tantalizing', 'clues', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'explored', 'more', 'detail', 'upcoming', 'season']",Carnivale: Season 1

850982,ABTYRDOKNGKFS,B0002YLC1U,"David R ""dtr19""","[2, 2]","There are no simple words for what this show is about or how amazing it truly is.  It is remarkable in its complexity of plot, dialogue, and scenery.  They recreated the 1920s dustbowl for this show, and did an incredible job at it.  The overall storyline starts out simple enough, and honestly seemed like it could have been ended in one season.  Seemed until they started to show you the bigger picture.  The opening lines from the carnivals second in command, and public face, Samson, gives you the set up for the overall plot.  Each twist and turn of said plot makes you want to know more.  It is an unending search for truth, and the end to the war between light and dark.  Its like Samson says, ""To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of dark.""  The two creatures are two people who you would never expect to be which one they are.  The first season is about the two trying to find their way, and understand what it is they are meant for and accepting that.  The second season is more about the build to the battle.  So the first season can seem a tad slow at times, but it will keep your interest.  The second season, however, is where the show hits its real stride and gets right into the sense of urgency and action that a truly well written drama can give.  Of course it isn't a ton of action, this is not a show that is supposed to be action packed.  The show is supposed to be a drama with a lot of dialogue and mystery, and that is what it is.  Even the most action filled scene of the two seasons is fairly tame compared to some other shows and movies.  But the way it is played out, and the build to it, makes it feel like a lot more.  The build up to the final scene of the first season is insane.  Trust me when I say that if you intend to watch this show, be prepared to devote an entire day to it.  After maybe the third episode, you'll be hooked.  This show grabs you and keeps a hold of you.  I still don't understand why HBO would ever cancel such an amazing show, and give a show like The Sopranos, that had clearly lost something to it by the last season, so many seasons when it obviously should have been finished before that.  I like The Sopranos, don't get me wrong, I just feel that it had come to its height long before the last season, and maybe should have been ended a bit sooner.  But here we have a show like Carnivale, that had two seasons, and clearly could have gone on at least another season and been well worth it.  The acting is superb, the writing is some of the best on TV, and the sets look like they are in the 1920s or 1930s dustbowl in the midwest.  There is a sense of dirt and poorness everywhere in this show, and makes you feel like the actors are really there.  So remember, if you intend to watch this show, buy both seasons, do yourself a favor, because you will want both after you watch the first season.  But be prepared for the second season to leave you hanging and wishing HBO wasn't so stupid as to cancel such a wonderful show.",5,This show will suck you in,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,3013,"['are', 'simple', 'words', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'how', 'amazing', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'complexity', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'scenery', 'recreated', '1920s', 'dustbowl', 'show', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'overall', 'storyline', 'out', 'simple', 'enough', 'honestly', 'seemed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ended', 'one', 'season', 'Seemed', 'started', 'show', 'bigger', 'picture', 'opening', 'lines', 'carnivals', 'second', 'command', 'public', 'face', 'Samson', 'set', 'up', 'overall', 'plot', 'twist', 'turn', 'said', 'plot', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'unending', 'search', 'truth', 'end', 'war', 'light', 'dark', 'Samson', 'generation', 'born', 'creature', 'light', 'creature', 'dark', 'two', 'creatures', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'be', 'one', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'meant', 'accepting', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'build', 'battle', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'seem', 'tad', 'slow', 'times', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'second', 'season', 'however', 'where', 'show', 'real', 'stride', 'right', 'sense', 'urgency', 'action', 'truly', 'well', 'written', 'drama', 'can', 'give', 'course', ""n't"", 'ton', 'action', 'not', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'action', 'packed', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'drama', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'mystery', 'what', 'Even', 'most', 'action', 'filled', 'scene', 'two', 'seasons', 'fairly', 'tame', 'compared', 'other', 'shows', 'movies', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'build', 'feel', 'lot', 'more', 'build', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'first', 'season', 'insane', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'intend', 'watch', 'show', 'be', 'prepared', 'devote', 'entire', 'day', 'maybe', 'third', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'show', 'keeps', 'hold', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'HBO', 'would', 'ever', 'cancel', 'such', 'amazing', 'show', 'give', 'show', 'Sopranos', 'had', 'clearly', 'lost', 'something', 'last', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'seasons', 'when', 'obviously', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finished', 'Sopranos', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'just', 'feel', 'had', 'come', 'height', 'long', 'last', 'season', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ended', 'bit', 'sooner', 'here', 'have', 'show', 'Carnivale', 'had', 'two', 'seasons', 'clearly', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'least', 'season', 'been', 'well', 'acting', 'superb', 'writing', 'best', 'TV', 'sets', 'look', 'are', '1920s', '1930s', 'dustbowl', 'midwest', 'sense', 'dirt', 'poorness', 'everywhere', 'show', 'feel', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'there', 'So', 'remember', 'intend', 'watch', 'show', 'buy', 'seasons', 'do', 'favor', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'prepared', 'second', 'season', 'leave', 'hanging', 'wishing', 'HBO', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'stupid', 'cancel', 'wonderful', 'show']",Carnivale: Season 1

850995,A2G39KAEO73GVC,B0002YLC1U,echoes999,"[14, 14]","If one were to look back on HBO's track record for TV shows, they would see an incredible mix of superior shows that are almost perfect in every way. From the prison drama Oz to mafia life in The Sopranos, to new shows like the phenomenal Deadwood and the great show Carnivale, which I'm reviewing here.Carnivale takes place in 1934, in the dustbowl of America during a sad period of history, the depression. ""To each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness."" So says Samson(Michael J. Anderson) at the very start of the first episode. Samson is the head of a particular Carnivale that comes across Ben Hawkins(Nick Stahl), an escaped convict that has just lost his mother. Ben is the creature of light that Samson and the other carnies except into their fold, and soon Ben finds himself traveling through the dustbowl of America with this Carnivale. What Samson and his right hand man Jonesy(Tim DeKay) don't know is that Ben has the power to heal, but at a price.Back in California is the creature of darkness, Brother Justin Crowe(Clancy Brown) a minister who can cause people to have troubling visions about their worst sins. Brother Justin is bringing about the Apocalypse even though he doesn't realize it. Brother Justin doesn't even believe he's evil, nor does his sister Iris Crowe(Amy Madigan) who has what one can only call an 'odd' realationship with her brother.Along the way we meet plenty of strange and intersting characters. There's Sophie(Clea DuVall) who is a Tarot card reader, even though it's her catatonic mother who is the real fortune teller. There's also Professor Lodz(Patrick Bauchau) a blind man with a cane who can touch people or items and read them. Lodz has a strange relationship with the bearded lady of the carnivale, Lila(Debra Christofferson) who is most times conniving and outspoken. There's also the Dreifuss family who run the Kooch show at the carnivale, with an intersting mother and daughters act. There's Ruthie(Adrienne Barbeau), an older woman who is a hypnotic snake charmer and the mother of the strongman and who also takes quite an interest in Ben, as well as Sophie in the beginning. And then there's management, who's only a voice from behind a curtain. Management is a person you never see who makes all of the decisions about the carnivale and seems to have a hand at knowing everything that's going on. Only Samson and Lodz are even allowed to talk to management.Throughout the season all of the characters go through many trials and mishaps. Brother Justin and Ben each wander the road to self discovery, as well as many of the other characters. There's plenty of droughy, incredible dust storms, murder and death as well as the classic X-files element of who do you trust, as Ben comes to find out from the very beginning. We see Carnival life as it was back then. The hardships, the money problems, the different ways the carnies would rip off ""Rubes,"" or customers. We get a perfect view of carnie life, in all of its beautiful and ugly glory. You see the different stages of the carnivale being put up and ripped back down.Everything in this show is authentic, from the cars to the carnivale rides. The people who made this show actually bought original stuff to make the viewer feel like they are there, in the story, which brings me to another point. Pretty much everything that is shown in the show is real. Rarely is CGI ever used because the makers never wanted to bring the viewer out of frame of mind that this show was actually taking place in the 30's.Another strong point of this show is that it's not something you can half-watch. As a viewer you have to watch everything that happens or you'll miss something important along the way. This is a show that makes the viewer think. You have to piece together this slowly unraveling mystery that twists and turns at every corner. A big part of this show is showing, not telling. There's not a whole lot of dialogue. Most of the points and feelings are made through strong imagery and emotion emitted from the wonderful actors and actresses in this series.  The title sequence is incredibly artful and the cinemtography is wonderful, with full mountain ranges and miles of desert surrounding most of the carnivale locations.This is a show filled with wonder and mysticism. It's ground in very believible reality and then there's moments of magic and enchantment that fuels the story and leaves you craving more, without ever taking you out of the reality part of the story. They filmakers have crafted such a wonderful universe here that the viewer can believe when magic takes place, without doubting the reality behind it. Another strong point of the show is that it moves along and builds slowly. Some people might not enjoy this, but that's part of the reason it's a thinking show, but with the slow build occuring, moments of violence, magic or visions jump out at you that much more and are more vivid and emotional.This is an incredible show and I hope HBO keeps making dramas as good as all of their others. My only real complaint is that I don't have HBO and therefore can't watch season two that is on right now. I guess I'll just have to wait until it comes out to DVD too.",5,Almost no need for network TV when we have HBO,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,5229,"['one', 'were', 'look', 'back', 'HBO', 'track',

I do not understand why great shows such as this one never gets the recognitions it deserves. Deadwood is excellent but Canivale is darker and the twist and turns have the most brilliant sleuths guessing to the end. It is unfortunate that the series will end after series two. For those of you who have not seen series two it leaves the viewers unfulfilled and this is frustrating.

Two of them, Carnivale and Firefly unfortunately didn't get the chance to fulfill their entire vision. The one show that did, The Wire, did have a full five seasons to tell the entire story. Another show, Lost, although very good, didn't quite measure up to greatness in the end.I just finished watching both seasons of Carnivale and I can definitely say that the experience was like reading a deep, involved, mysterious novel where the story enfolds at a perfect pace and builds to a satisfying end place. The development of characters is one of the highlights of this show. The characters appear genuine despite the supernatural elements, they are numerous enough and fully developed over the series to keep you interested in all of them, and their interactions are complex and critical to the story. The look and feel of this show is also genuine for the time period with dust storms, dirty fingernails and carnival creepies. Underlying this is a story of epic proportions; the historic battle of good and evil, supernatural powers and mystical beings (avatars). Put it all together and this is one excellent show.Despite the fact that this series was cut short (it was planned for six seasons), the conclusion is still meaningful and satisfying. Yes. It leaves you wanting more because by the end of season 2, you get it. You understand how awesome this show really is. Oh what could have been!!

851003,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B0002YLC1U,Get Serious,"[1, 5]","This show is about eight years old now and was released on HBO. This is the primary reason they say it didn't make the ratings, in that it had too small a viewing group. I don't believe this is the reason people lost interest in it. Shows like this attract the same audience that like the cr*p Steven King writes. Some people are lost in their own psychoses, depression and misery and so gravitate to something that feeds this. These screenplays utilize this same premise based upon the following:*the misery of the Depression Era in people being unemployed and totally destitute*desperation in turning to an inattentive God for solace*loss of morality in desperation*'creepiness' defined by a traveling carnival, which in turn defines 'abnormal'*people who are 'lost' i.e. undefined in purpose and are directionlessSimilar to horror genre, this show was relatively easy to write. If it were a musical, it would be defined as 'dissonant!' So the writing is based upon chaos, desperation and loss of morality; coupled with spooky music for effect; the supernatural and the questionable power-of-God.In other words, the writers can write any kind of crap they want, because basically there are no rules. Viewers are basically lost because the screenplay has no real story line, timeline or purpose. Choosing a carnival as the infrastructure works, because old-time carnivals were the definition of decadence: con artists working customer greed, no morality, sexual exploitation,and a touch of the 'wild side.' In the depression, people could always come up with a dime! HBO's primary attraction to American audiences is based upon their ability to do things 'rated' TV cannot (putting it on line with regular TV in other countries) i.e. showing boobs, profanity, 'soft porn' sexual antics, adult situation and psychoses...and this is primarily why people watch HBO. The US television and cinema and rating systems are thirty years behind those of other countries, so this is of what HBO takes advantage.

Kikkert ""HKikkert""","[3, 3]","Unlike most series, this one doesn't start out slow and boring, it catches your attention beginning with the very first episode. I had to do a project for a college class where we watched a show without the sound on, to try and figure out what was occurring via the nonverbal communication used. Then we were to view it again, but with the sound, to see how well we caught on to what was happening. I wanted to use something I had never seen before, and had been meaning to watch the series for over a year. I can't believe I put it off for as long as I did... Of course, I used episode one of season one for the project, and after watching it, I had to finish season one off within the week, then immediately moved on to season two. If I wasn't working full time, going to school, and watching my kids on my days off, I would have just plunked myself down in front of the tv right then and there, and watched them all straight through without budging for anything. Now that says a lot for me. I have a very large genre spread for what I like viewing, but the only other series I have ever liked enough to sit down and watch back to back are Firefly and Wonderfalls. Unfortunately, HBO cut Carnivale off before it was truly finished. They answered many questions with what they did in the two seasons that were produced, but there is still enough to go on that they could make an awesome movie to wrap up all the loose ends and not end up beating a dead horse like so many series go on to doing. I totally understand the fact that they wanted to end on a high note and not run the series into the ground by dragging it out when they have run out of new content ideas, so lets hope they decide to hit the big screen with the final moments of Clayton Jones, Sofie, Ben Hawkins, and all the other unique souls that make up the Carnivale.

851018,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0002YLC1U,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","Carniv&agrave;le is an American television series, produced by HBO and set in the United States against the backdrop of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. Carniv&agrave;le follows the comings and goings of a surreal traveling carnival, (&#34;Carniv&agrave;le&#34;). The series addresses such issues as religion, magic, free will and destiny. Carniv&agrave;le's ambitious storyline attempts to depict the mythological battle between Good and Evil - between Heaven and Hell. &#34;To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.&#34; Thus the pilot episode begins.Some have compared this series, its characters and ambiance, to a combination of John Steinbeck's novel &#34;Grapes of Wrath,&#34; with the surreal TV cult series, &#34;Twin Peaks,&#34; created by Mark Frost and David Lynch, and the wonderful horror film, &#34;Freaks,&#34; produced by Tod Browning. I think the description is apt.The first season of Carniv&agrave;le takes place between 1934 and 1935, and consists of two primary plotlines that slowly meet and intersect. The first involves a very depressed young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins, (Nick Stahl). He is a young Oklahoma farmer and a fugitive from a chain gang. (No wonder he is depressed)! Ben is picked up by a traveling carnival when his mother dies. Like so many others, the Hawkins' family farm, in Milfay, Oklahoma, has failed, eaten alive by the dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the US and Canadian prairies during this period. Soon after joining the carnival, Ben begins to have violent, inexplicable dreams and visions of people and places he has never seen or heard of him. These dreams lead him to search for a man named Henry Scudder who, perhaps, is his father. He had heard his mother mention the name once before, when she died. Apparently Scudder is a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival a long time ago. He apparently possesses supernatural abilities similar to Ben's. Stahl is extremely effective in conveying the anti-hero's moods and yearnings. He has a boyish face, but a grim expression and always looks worn down...a real loner. (I wish he'd take a bath. He always looks like he has just survived a major dust storm, covered in dirt and sweat. It may be just a quirk of mine, but all the other carnie members seem to have found the shower).The second plotline revolves around Brother Justin Crowe, (Clancy Brown), a Methodist preacher who lives in the small town of Mintern, California, with his sister Iris, (Amy Madigan), a devoted supporter of his ministry duties. He also has prophetic, violent dreams, and begins to discover that he has his own otherworldly powers. Certain that he is doing God's work, Brother Justin fanatically devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that he has a nemesis, Ben Hawkins, and that their time of meeting is drawing near.Carniv&agrave;le has a large cast, amounting to eighteen primary actors over its two-season run. There are several &#34;freaks,&#34; used as carnival attractions in the series. To give the illusion of being freaks, the appearance of many actors was modified by make-up elements. Steve Altman, head of the makeup artist team, does an extraordinary job, as do his co-workers. Real &#34;freaks&#34; of the 1930s were able to find their place in the world, a future, with the carnival, where they tended to be celebrities. Their lives on the road are like those of a traveling family. They have bonded and appear loyal to each other, as many families are.Michael J. Anderson plays Samson, the dwarf who runs the carnival and answers to the mysterious &#34;management.&#34; &#34;Management&#34; is never seen but the voice of &#34;Management&#34; is the voice of actor Linda Hunt. Tim DeKay portrays Clayton &#34;Jonesy&#34; Jones, the crippled head roustabout. He is Samson's right-hand man, operator of the ferris wheel, and the leader of the roustabouts.  Patrick Bauchau acts as the carnival's blind mentalist Lodz, and Debra Christofferson plays his lover, Lila the Bearded Lady, and the carnival's dressmaker. Diane Salinger portrays the catatonic fortune teller Apollonia, and Sophie, Clea DuVall, is her tarot-card-reading daughter. Both mother and daughter can communicate telepathically. Adrienne Barbeau is the snake charmer Ruthie, who is also the barker for the strongman acts of her son Gabriel, played by Brian Turk. Gecko the Lizard Man is played by John Fleck, and Karyne and Sarah Steben appears as the conjoined twins Alexandria and Caladonia.  Felix &#34;Stumpy&#34; Dreifuss, portrayed by Toby Huss, is the manager of the cootch (striptease) show. This show is really outragous, but entertaining, in a pornagraphic kinda way. Stumpy is married to Rita Sue, Cynthia Ettinger. The couple have two daughters: Their eldest, Libby Dreifuss is played by Carla Gallo, and Dora Mae Dreifuss, Amanda Aday, is their other daughter. John Savage plays the mysterious Henry Scudder in several episodes.Carniv&agrave;le  was created by Daniel Knauf, who also served as executive producer with Ronald D. Moore and Howard Klein. The instrumental music -appropriately weird - was composed by Jeff Beal. Carniv&agrave;le also features many popular songs from the 1920s and 1930s, the time when Carniv&agrave;le's story takes place.The pilot episode is directed by Rodrigo Garcia.I really enjoy this very original series and am so sorry it was cut short after Season Two.JANA",4,"Carnavale - ""To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.""",1391472000,"02 4,

I now look at movies as 'short stories' and TV show sets as novels.

851025,A1V9J0CDSUC6RS,B0002YLC1U,John F.,"[0, 0]","This product arrived quickly and undamaged.As for the series itself.  It is a vey good series that makes you feel for the characters.  Furthermore, you can relate to many of these characters and the way they act just on the bases of time period the story alone.  There is strong religious aspects that are significantly twisted and thus anyone who might be offended by such should avoid this series.  In addition, there is ""a lot"" of nudity, sexually content/terminology, and occasional swearing which is unfortunate&#8230;but again, a bit realistic for the time and situations the characters exist in.  We understand why nudity was added, but feel it could have been cleaned up a bit, thus the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  Those aspects were most likely dirtied up just for HBO's purposes.  However, the story is interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Especially without commercials on this DVD set. This is the first of only two seasons released.  The second second is just as good on every level.  It is a shame HBO cancelled the series.  However, it is easy to goggle this topic and you can find Daniel Knauf's (series creator) vision of how he wanted to end the series and discover what characters should have developed into.  We are not sure if the website we are listing will ever change, but as of now the website presenting this concluding information is: [...]As mentioned, this series does have nudity, sexually content/terminology, and swearing, so we do not recommend it to anyone that can be offended by such.  However, if you can look past all of that, the story does present an interesting chain of events that dwells into the historically accurate struggle of humanity during the times of the dust bowl and mythical aspects of how there is always a battle between good (the light) and evil (the dark).We hope this review helped.

851027,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0002YLC1U,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[10, 10]","Carnivale caught my interest two years ago when I saw a billboard for the show on the side of a bus. I had no idea what it was about, but the image (which appears on the cover) was intriguing to me. I've never had HBO and I'd never watched any shows from HBO, but a buddy of mine got me into Deadwood...I suddenly remembered this show and set out to check out the first season. I'm in awe. This is one of the most elaborate, entertaining, and great looking TV shows I've seen in a while; And the cast is amazing too. The show has already been compared to another one of my favorite shows Twin Peaks...That's not just because Michael J. Anderson (the backwards-talker from that show) is in this show. This show is very much like something by David Lynch. It's slow moving, elaborate, doesn't always make sense (although, in this case you have to wait for it all to pan out), has lots of naked women of course, and it's weird. It kind of makes me wonder what Twin Peaks would've been like, had it aired on something like HBO rather than basic cable stations. This show followed directly in the footsteps of Twin Peaks; It grew a legion of fans and was cancelled after it's second season. The amazing cast includes Clea Duvall ('21 Grams'), Carla Gallo ('Spanking the Monkey'), Patrick Bauchau (who plays the sinister mentalist/absinthe drinker Lodz), Debra Chrisofferson (Lila, The Bearded Lady), Robert Knepper (T-Bag on ""Prison Break"") and many more. Most of the characters combine to make interesting sub-plots, some that surpass the excitement of the Brother Justin-Ben Hawkins debacle. Anyway, to get to the story behind Carnivale.In the Pilot episode Millfay, we meet Samson (Anderson) who tells us ""To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness""and so the show begins. Samson's carnival rolling through the town of Milfay when they stumble on Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl, 'Sin City') a boy who has recently escaped from prison and is now burying his dead mother. As his house is demolished, he joins the carnival as a helper to get away. Needless to say, Ben Hawkins is the ""creature of light."" Waiting for him in California (which, since the show ended after the 2nd season; I doubt they reached it)is the ""creature of darkness"" Brother Justin (Clancy Brown, who played the menacing prison guard in ""The Shawshank Redemption""), a preacher with a crazy look in his eye who begins having visions that he believes are from God instructing him to preach to Migrant workers. While Justin is the main bad guy, his sister Iris (Amy Madigan) turns out to be a bit more sinister than you'd think  As one reviewer pointed out, even without the Ben Hawkins-Brother Justin story-line; This show is very interesting, just for the carnie-folk alone. For me to explain every plot detail and outline every character for you, would be pointless. You should go watch the show for yourself; I will give an overview of all the episodes and some non-revealing comments about them:1. Milfay-A very cool pilot episode. The opening with Michael J. Anderson from Twin Peaks is great. The episode is interesting and opens a lot of doors for the following episodes. The episode is directed by Rodrigo Garcia ('Nine Lives')2. After the Ball is Over-Better than the pilot and totally cool. The cinematography here is great; Really terrific. In this episode, Ben finds an important puzzle piece in his life. A lot more twists are added to an already complicated show.3. Tipton-Another episode directed by Garcia, this one has the troupe setting up ina town called Tipton. When they're asked to leave, they refashion the show as a religious revival with Ben headlining. It's a cool episode.4. Black Blizzard-A blizzard hits the carnivale; Samson visits a hooker; Lodz tests Ben's powers; Brother Justin gets mad. A lot of things happen in this 45 minute episode; But it's all pretty good.5. Babylon-The carnivale rolls into a town filled with some strange characters; A main character dies...One of my favorite episodes.6. Pick a Number-This episode involves the characters getting revenge for what happened in the previous episode. Robert Knepper of Prison Break shows up in this episode.7. The River-I found the Russian children creepy for some reason. The cinematography in this episode is a lot more colorful, but this isn't my favorite.8. Lonnigan, Texas-In this episode (among other things, this is probably the longest episode at 57 minutes) Management is finally given a voice. I didn't think the voice of a female (I've known for a while that it's Linda Hunt) would live up to the expectations, because Management is very creepy as a silent presence. But the single line she says is very creepy. This is a marvelous episode.9. Insomnia-This episode is, for the most part, just a way to stretch the season out. A couple important events occur, but it could've been scattered in another episode. I like it though.10. Hot and Bothered-There's a whole lotta sex in this episode. But, besides that...This is one of my favorite episodes; The final shot is skillfully done.11. Day of the Dead-Another main character dies. Sofia hears some stuff about Jonesy. The relationship between Justin and Iris gets weird...It's a damn good.12. The Day That was the Day-A climactic end of the season. This is an awesome episode...Makes you not want to wait for the 2nd season.There you have it. One of the most interesting shows I've seen in a while, if you're a fan of HBO (The Sopranos, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, Big Love)you're not going to wanna miss this.GRADE:

This remains to be seen, but though the plot does develop slowly, the strength of the ensemble cast is so strong, that even rather non-momentus moments in this series are facinating...the first season concerns the slow spiritual awakening for the main protagoninst Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) and the rather rapid spiritual decline of Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) both of whom share similiar dreams and powers..Hawkins however is rather reluctant to accept his gifts to the frustrating point that you want to slap some sense into the daft boy. By season's end, Brother Justin was beginning to get a measure of what he is capable of, and for added depth, you have ambivilent feelings towards the Preacher because he does show moments of kindness, only to be thwarted by his fellow man. You cannot help but pity him as you learn more of his past. He is not portrayed as a stereotypical villian.....Because Carnivale, as with THE WIRE, and LOST (when it's out on DVD), have so many layers of plot, these DVD's will not grow mold on your bookcase, for you will always go back to these type of brilliant shows and  discover something new....Enthusiastically Recommended!",5,Uh-Oh!

With each subsequent episode we were drawn into the characters, the stories, the gritty-ness of carnival life.

The stories are riveting.We're only half-way through Season One, but I can tell you we'll buy Season Two when it's released. Then we'll suffer from carnivalous interruptus thanks to some crack-pipe lackey at HBO who didn't think a show this intelligent, well-crafted, and captivating deserved to live.I hope people promptly cancelled their HBO subscriptions the day they discovered HBO cancelled Carnivale.My recommendation is that you buy Carnivale Season One.

851038,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002YLC1U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[327, 347]","""Carniv&agrave;le"" is part of small but growing number of quality television shows that are committed to the sort of lengthy and complex story arc that was once the province of the mini-series.  But shows like ""Wiseguy"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in the past and current offerings such as ""24"" and ""Lost"" have paved the way for television shows that emphasize the big picture rather than the more traditional episodic approach.  As such, ""Carniv&agrave;le"" is most similar to ""Lost,"" in that we are pretty sure we know what will happen at the end of the journey, but we have no idea how many seasons down the road that end game will be played out.  Does creator Daniel Knauf (""Wolf Lake"") have an ambitious five-year plan similar to what J. Michael Straczynski had in mind from the start for ""Babylon 5""?  We will have to wait and see.With a show like ""Carniv&agrave;le"" it is easy (and fun) to play with various antecedents that explain the series in simple but readily understood terms.  From the start I was thinking of the show as a cross between John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" Tod Browning's ""Freaks,"" and Stephen King's ""The Stand,"" all of which I consider to be classics in their respective genres.  But there are other options as well (with Michael J. Anderson in the cast ""Twin Peaks"" becomes an obvious choice), which simply speaks to the potential of ""Carniv&agrave;le"" to resonate with its viewers.The premise of the show is provided as the opening narration: ""Before the beginning, after the great war between Heaven and Hell, God created the Earth and gave dominion over it to the crafty ape he called man. And to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness. And great armies clashed by night in the ancient war between good and evil. There was magic then, nobility, and unimaginable cruelty. And so it was until the day that a false sun exploded over Trinity, and man forever traded away wonder for reason."" The words are spoken by Samson (Anderson), who runs the traveling circus called Carniv&agrave;le, but answers to the unseen ""Management"" figure (voiced by an uncredited Linda Hunt).While traveling across the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in 1934, the Carniv&agrave;le comes across Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who has escaped from prison and returned home in time to watch his mother (Lucinda Jenney) die and bury here before the tractors level their shack.  Management wants Ben to join the caravan and given his predicament with the law, he agrees.  As the Carniv&agrave;le travels down to Texas we learn that Ben is plagued by strange visions of the trenches in the Great War and that he has the power to heal.  Meanwhile, in the California town of Mintern a minister named Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) believes that God is telling him what to minister to the growing number of Okies and other migrant workers streaming west, fleeing the Dust Bowl.  Those who oppose Brother Justin's plans find themselves punished for standing in the way.Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin are the creatures of light and darkness foretold, and while their visions contain glimpses of each other, they are not going to meet during this first season of ""Carniv&agrave;le.""  Their meeting is inevitable and clearly will constitute the apocalyptic conclusion of this series, but at this point they are still coming to terms with their places in this strange universe.  Each man is trying to find out about their mysterious past, where they came from, and what they can do with their powers.  Eventually they will have to decide what they should do with those powers and at the end of the first season they face what will certainly be the first of several escelating crucibles.While the focus is primarily on Ben Hawkins getting used to his power and Brother Justin doing his work with his older sister, Iris (Amy Madigan), there is also life in the travelling circus during the Great Depression.  Ben is of interest to Lodz (Patrick Bachauh), a mentalist who takes an active interest in the young man's powers and who is involved with Lila (Debra Christofferson), the bearded lady.  Meanwhile, Ben has taken an interest in Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), the snake charmer who is also the mother of the strong man, Gabriel (Brian Turk).  The person interested in Ben romantically appears to be Sophie (Clea DuVall), the tarot card reader who is also the medium for her comatose mother, Apollonia (Diane Salinger), who is pyschic.  Jonesy (Tim Dekay), the manger of the rousties, is in love with Sophie, but he gets involved with the Dreifuss family that runs the Cootch Show, Stumpy (Toby Huss), the father who is the emcee, mother Rita Sue (Cynthia Ettinger), and daughters Dora Mae (Amanda Aday) and Libby (Carla Gallo).One of the strengths of ""Carniv&agrave;le"" is that what is going on in that travelling circus is fairly interesting even without throwing young Ben Hawkins into the mix.  There is something intrinsically fascinating about how carny folk milk the marks for money, and there is a sense of personal pride in their professionalism that gives them a certain level of dignity.  In the short term, I do not know if I like the idea that not all of them are going to be alive next season.  Then, of course, there is the whole look of the show.  Suffice it to say ""Carniv&agrave;le"" won Emmys for Outstanding Art Direction and Cinematography for a One-Camera Series, along with those for Costumes, Hairstyling, and Main Title Design (you could do a pretty good master's thesis just decoding that last one).The DVD series for the first season comes with three audio commentaries, a really short featurette on the making of the series, and a giant group discussion with the cast.  The commentary for ""Milfay,"" the pilot episode, is the most important one, and twice as good as the other two put together.  It has Knauf, director Rodrigo Garcia, and executive producer Howard Klein on it, with the creator/writer and director doing most of the talking, who focus on how they cast the show and how the first episode evolved.  We also get the ""Previously On"" and ""Next On"" bits that HBO created for each episode.I recognize that ""Carniv&agrave;le"" is going to be a very maddening show to those who want things to move along at a brisk pace, and there will be those who will abandon the show long before it gets to the promised land (when the circus gets to California, probably in a couple of seasons).  But for those of us who remember how ""Twin Peaks"" fell apart when the hook of ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" became the line and (literal) sinker, or who felt ""The X-Files"" was adding to its mythology without getting any closer to a big finish, the idea that ""Carniv&agrave;le"" has been created with a definitive end point in mind provide some measure of comfort.  This first season provides an initial level of confidence and the potential for more, but in the end how good this series is with come down to the quality of the final ""blow off.""  Given that the origin of ""carnival"" goes back to the Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Lupercalia where there was a temporary subversion of civil order and that the term now refers to the holiday period of the two weeks before Lent, it could be something pretty good.  Besides, it is not on television: it is on HBO.",5,The first steps to trading away wonder for reason,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,7300,"['Carniv', 'agrave', 'le', 'part', 'small', 'growing',

I had heard of the show-- but thought nothing of it. Then one hot summer night, I popped the disk one-- and now I'm captivated.On a limb, I would say that if you liked 'Firefly' because it did NOT follow the formula normally seen-- you will be enthralled by 'Carnivale' for the same reasons-- But I am not equating the two. They are too, too different. But they are similar in that Carnivale does not follow the normally expected script. It is uncomfortable, and embarrassingly 'naked' at times. At other times, you want to laugh, but the scene was ANYTHING but funny.Gothic, gritty, dark and turbid. The scenes and the people are so rumpled and sweatstained and threadbare, you begin to truly understand the pain the word 'Depression' meant. There's no parade of beautiful model-wanna-be actors mouthing lines to the usual formulaic 'Carnie/Outsider' horror/thriller script. The plain, dusty desperation of that era makes you ache. And that's masterpeice in and of itself.Something apocalyptic is biulding between the Preacher's ordeals and the multiply scarred people of Carnivale-- but the threads are so deeply woven they are hard to discern because of the invisible powers that seem to be walking alongside everyone.The sense of something mystical and mysterious is just a deft touch at the edge of your awareness, never in front of you. Always tantalizing. ANd when you expect to be wowed with special effects and ala-kazam-- instead you are floored by a powerful script and electric acting.Even more intriguing is the fact that Both the Preacher and Ben have good intent. One wants to do good--and the other wants to be left alone. But one will be turned down a bad road and when it happens, even the the viewer will be squirming.Carnivale is great viewing for a hot, hot summer night. Have your Iced Tea ready.

I won't go into detail about each character and episode, but suffice to say that, if you're someone who enjoys the WRITING of Stephen King (not many of the awful films based on his books) this series is for you.  While Stephen King is in no way associated with this series, the pacing, the characters, the ambience, the detail, and the plain bizzare nature of his brand of story telling are perfectly represented by Carnivale Season 1.  In fact, I have never seen a TV series or film that so accurately re-creates the pacing and detail of a great novel. However, if you are someone who is easily disturbed or just doesn't like tales of the mysterious and bizzare, this may not be for you.  If you are someone who hates loose ends and enjoys the plot being laid neatly before you, Carnivale is definately not for you; many, many questions are raised in Season 1 and very, very few are answered.

851050,A25LM23UM50GD,B0002YLC1U,"Mark ""Sorokahdeen""","[7, 7]","Set during the Great Depression, Carnivale is an enormously ambitious work of the imagination integrating a detailed and meticulously-realized vision of life in rural, dust-bowl depression America with a mythos that is in some ways as ambitious as Tolkien's. It won five Emmy awards and was nominated for a further ten.A fusion of history and mystery, Carnivale's themes and action derive from a struggle between good and evil personified by the story's protagonist, Ben, and antagonist, Brother Justin, that is reflected in the world at large; a world which, as the story begins, we are told sees mankind on the verge of substituting wonder for reason and it is here that the story's ambition can be said to have gone one step too far.Had Carnivale been a novel, it might have survived and prospered. Readers become committed to seeing books through to the end, while television series depend on audience numbers for a story to be produced to its conclusion and this is the reason Carnivale lasted only two seasons out its planned six-season run: audiences in television drag writing down towards a lowest common denominator that mires us in shows like '24' and `The Mentalist'.Carnivale was a show for the rest of us that featured ideas and events that broke new ground in imaginative  television writing; creating a comprehensive mythology where ghost towns swallow the living and add them to their ranks; where blind sorcerers swill absinthe and foretell the future; and where one woman's life is so mystically woven into the fabric of the world that her orgasms bring on the rain.This and many other things make Carnivale's writing brilliantly imaginative but causing one Amazon reviewer to make an unfavorable comparison to the BBC's production of Robert Grave's wonderful novel, ""I, Claudius."" That comparison doesn't take into account I, Claudius's life as a television series being midwifed by the work of a supremely-talented novelist who had classical histories as source material; while the the writers of Carnivale flew solo as they wove historical research into a sweeping, savage architecture of the plausible and the fantastic. In a sense, this could be said to have been Carnivale's downfall: it was too good for its own good.Despite award-winning vision, the writers of Carnivale, trusted too much in the Audience; depending on them to sift an intricate unfolding of events, some of which were tied to other events that took place decades in the past, and it was simply too much to absorb and too subtle for an audience whose members could grab the remote and drool over the chaotic implausibility of Lost.Carnivale like its sister show, Deadwood, was brilliant, beautifully-shot, innovative television where writers fused history with mythology to create a show that was like nothing else that had come before it and if, unlike many members of today's television audience, you have the attention span necessary to follow a comic book, you may love it as much as its fans do.",5,A Series Marred Only By The Audience,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,2993,"['Set', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Carnivale', 'enormously', 'ambitious', 'work', 'imagination', 'integrating', 'detailed', 'meticulously-realized', 'vision', 'life', 'rural', 'dust-bowl', 'depression', 'America', 'mythos', 'ways', 'as', 'ambitious', 'Tolkien', 'won', 'five', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'further', 'ten.A', 'fusion', 'history', 'mystery', 'Carnivale', 'themes', 'action', 'derive', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'personified', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Ben', 'antagonist', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'reflected', 'world', 'large', 'world', 'story', 'are', 'told', 'sees', 'mankind', 'verge', 'substituting', 'wonder', 'reason', 'here', 'story', 'ambition', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far.Had', 'Carnivale', 'been', 'novel', 'might', 'have', 'survived', 'prospered', 'Readers', 'become', 'committed', 'seeing', 'books', 'end', 'television', 'series', 'depend', 'audience', 'numbers', 'story', 'be', 'produced', 'conclusion', 'reason', 'Carnivale', 'lasted', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'planned', 'six-season', 'run', 'audiences', 'television', 'drag', 'writing', 'down', 'towards', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'shows', ""'24"", ""Mentalist'.Carnivale"", 'was', 'show', 'rest', 'featured', 'ideas', 'events', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'imaginative', 'television', 'writing', 'creating', 'comprehensive', 'mythology', 'where', 'ghost', 'towns', 'swallow', 'living', 'add', 'ranks', 'where', 'blind', 'sorcerers', 'swill', 'absinthe', 'foretell', 'future', 'where', 'one', 'woman', 'life', 'so', 'mystically', 'woven', 'fabric', 'world', 'orgasms', 'bring', 'rain.This', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'Carnivale', 'writing', 'brilliantly', 'imaginative', 'causing', 'one', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'make', 'unfavorable', 'comparison', 'BBC', 'production', 'Robert', 'Grave', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Claudius', 'comparison', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'Claudius', 'life', 'television', 'series', 'being', 'midwifed', 'work', 'supremely-talented', 'novelist', 'who', 'had', 'classical', 'histories', 'source', 'material', 'writers', 'Carnivale', 'flew', 'solo', 'wove', 'historical', 'research', 'sweeping', 'savage', 'architecture', 'plausible', 'fantastic', 'sense', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'Carnivale', 'downfall', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'own', 'good.Despite', 'award-winning', 'vision', 'writers', 'Carnivale', 'trusted', 'too', 'much', 'Audience', 'depending', 'sift', 'intricate', 'unfolding', 'events', 'were', 'tied', 'other', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'decades', 'past', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'absorb', 'too', 'subtle', 'audience', 'members', 'could', 'grab', 'remote', 'drool', 'chaotic', 'implausibility', 'Lost.Carnivale', 'sister', 'show', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'brilliant', 'beautifully-shot', 'innovative', 'television', 'where', 'writers', 'fused', 'history', 'mythology', 'create', 'show', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'had', 'come', 'many', 'members', 'today', 'television', 'audience', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'necessary', 'follow', 'comic', 'book', 'may', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'fans', 'do']",Carnivale: Season 1

851061,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B0002YLC1U,Michael Crane,"[31, 35]","""Carnivale"" has now become my favorite show.  I didn't know much about it when I got the first season on DVD for Christmas.  I just knew that it looked like something that I'd really like.  It seemed to have that strangeness and darkness that I find so fascinating at times.  I think it only took two episodes, and I was hooked.  I finished the 12 episodes in less than two weeks.  Never has a show grab my attention like ""Carnivale.""  It is one of the most unique, beautiful and disturbing shows I have ever seen.The year is 1934, a pretty dark and depressing time in history.  A traveling carnival finds Ben Hawkins, a restless kid that has a lot of mystery to him.  He turns out to have a rather remarkable gift of healing, but he has yet to learn the true power of it... or the consequences.  States and states away is Brother Justin Crowe, a man of God.  He has always tried to serve the Lord to the best of his abilities, until he starts finding out strange things about himself.  A darkness within that reveals itself little by little until it is all clear what his real purpose is.  This sets the stage for the ultimate battle between good and evil.  Even though Ben and Justin have not met each other, they know their paths will meet eventually.The first season is really a set-up of things to come, but boy does it ever hook you in.  The show is so well-written and well-acted.  At first, you're not entirely sure what's happening, but with each episode you learn a little more.  It doesn't cheat, either.  Everything is in there for a reason, even if it's not very clear at the beginning.  Out of the 12 episodes in this first season, I did not find a single episode that I didn't like.  All of the episodes are intense and mesmerizing.  Nick Stahl is terrific as ""Ben Hawkins"" and you really buy into his role right from the word, ""Go.""  The showstopper, in my opinion, is Clancy Brown, who plays ""Brother Justin.""  He is absolutely amazing in this show.  One of the best characters from a series in recent years.If you plan to check out ""Carnivale,"" then you really have to give it a chance.  You have to let it soak into you.  It'll take at least two episodes to really pull you in.  It is a very complex show, so if you're looking for something simplistic, stay clear from this.  Also, the show can be extremely violent at times.  While it's not gratuitous, there are more than a few uneasy and disturbing scenes that will get to you, so be prepared for that.  The show looks BEAUTIFUL and the sound is superb.  There aren't many extras, except for three commentary tracks and a making-of featurette.  I really enjoyed the making-of featurette, but I suggest you watch that last.""Carnivale"" is a phenomenal show.  It's really set my standards high when it comes to new shows, now.  After seeing this, it's hard for any other show to really grab me.  As soon as you finish the first season, you'll immediately want to watch the next season... hopefully that'll come out soon (if you thought this season was wild, you haven't seen nothin' yet!)  If you're looking for a creative and challenging show, this is the one for you.  Just be careful.  There's no turning back once you cross that road.

851064,A1MOGEXNCBZE3U,B0002YLC1U,"M. Packham ""Stuart""","[7, 8]","It's a comforting thing to see that HBO is continually adding to its impressive ouevre of television drama and comedy. They have literally raised the bar from the 'its-all-over-in-an-episode' drama of the mid-90's (Murder One excepted), to something more of a character study in which plot takes a back seat. The same is true of Carnivale. The most interesting part of the show is the interactions between and the development of the characters, and their reactions to various crises. Bad guys aren't all bad, good guys aren't all good. There's shades of grey. It makes for a continually surprising viewing experience.Basically, the show begins with the Carnivale picking up the taciturn and mysterious Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl). On the other side of America, Brother Justin (Clancy Brown) is being spoken to by God, ""like he spoke to Moses"" he says. Both of these men dream about the other, despite never having met. Both seem to have some kind of special power they deny. To say any more would be to spoil it, except that we meet everyone involved in the lives of the two men. On Hawkins' side we meet the Carny folks and on Justin's side we meet his sister, his mentor, his congregation and the ghosts of his past.These two stories travel concurrently and sweep you along for the ride. If there is any criticism to be levelled at the show, it's that Ben Hawkins takes a back seat for much of the series. There's only a very slight development of his character and what he's capable of. Also, the most interesting character, that of Brother Justin, suffers from this same lack of airtime. Clancy Brown shines in every scene that he's in. He's given the juiciest lines and a healthy dose of inner conflict. It's a shame that perhaps we only get to see him about 10% of the time in each episode. Most of the time is therefore reserved for the characters in the Carnivale, mostly Sophie, the fortune teller with a telekinetic, comatose mother.The show moves slowly and anybody looking for plot driven action should probably avoid it. This is most certainly a character piece. The technicalities of the show are infallible, and period setting is totally convincing and the performances are excellent.

The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Oz, and recently Deadwood and the Wire have received plenty of critical acclaim and viewer accolades, while this series hasn't received as much fanfare as one would hope.  Taking place in 1934 in the Oklahoma dustbowl, Carnivale introduces us to Ben Hawkins (Terminator 3's Nick Stahl), a lonely young man who finds himself a job at a traveling carnival run by Samson (Michael J. Anderson).  At the same time in California, there is Brother Justin Crowe (Highlander and Shawshank Redemption's Clancy Brown, perfectly cast), a mysterious preacher who isn't what he seems, and as we the viewers discover, he and Ben have plenty in common.  With the foreshadowing of an apocalyptic confrontation, and a superbly chosen cast (which includes Amy Madigan as Crowe's sister, as well as Clea DuVall and Adrienne Barbeau as fellow carnival members), Carnivale shows loads of promise, even if it's premise does begin to wear thin before the season finale.

For dark fantasy video that began on the small screen within the last ten years (at least!), this is the mother lode. It has been a long time since anything this original and ambitious was made for television.There is so much good dark fantasy in books and so little of it on the screen. Video fantasy tends to be simplified and dumbed down. This isn't.One of the reasons networks are reluctant to try anything this rich and complicated is that so many viewers, accustomed to story arcs measured in double-digit minutes, bore easily. See some of the reviews of people who didn't care for the program. (Sesame Street, for all its virtues, has a lot to answer for in terms of what it has done to American attention spans.)Yes, it does take a while to figure out what the heck is going on. Yes, it isn't instantly obvious who the good and bad guys are. And, yes, even after you do, it turns out that even angels, fallen or otherwise, have personal agendas that blur that nice, sharp dichotomy of Good and Evil.  Life, and good stories, are often messy and complicated and morally ambiguous.If this were a very long dark fantasy novel or a series of novels -- with the last chapters ripped out by the publishing house version of the network idiots who cancelled the series after the second season-- it would read like a re-write of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath done by a collaboration between Ray Bradbury (Something Wicked This Way Comes) and Stephen King (The Stand) -- with more development of the female characters than either writer usually does.

851078,ADE852UR9121C,B0002YLC1U,perfecto,"[3, 4]","HBO publicizes their dramas as powerful, compelling and groundbreaking...and I can say this, they sure as hell weren't joking. What amazes me is that HBO continues to stun us, to show that TV doesn't have to be boring or shallow. And Carnivale continues that tradition very well. First, I'll give a quick run-through of the story.The story is set in the 30's, in the first episode...we see a boy, Ben Hawkins....his mother just passed away in a desolate area. A passing Carnival stops and they offer the boy a place to stay in return for help around the Carnival. Was picking him up there just a coincidence?  The Carnival is run by Samson, a little man who claims to take orders from ""Management"". Who is Management? We don't know and he is never shown. Samson's right hand man is Jonesy, who is very loyal and trustworthy to Samson because of something Samson helped him with, but what? We don't know. We then find that Ben Hawkins has a gift. He can heal people, but we then find out that's just icing on the cake. He is apparently meant for greater things, but what? Meanwhile, Lodz, a blind entertainer in the Carnival is increasingly interested in Ben. He knows about the gift and seems to be pestering Ben to let him help...but Ben already in a confused state, refuses time and again. There are many other interesting characters in Carnivale. In another place, we are given glimpses of the life of Brother Justin, a preacher who also has certain gifts. The lifes of both Ben and Brother Justin seem destined to collide, but how? Carnivale is filled with mysteries like this.I think the opening credits of this show describes it the best. We are shown tarot cards, and the camera zooms in different cards to reveal different events in human history, most seem to reveal the degradation of humans. Like that, the story for Carnivale has many layers, some seem to interweave with others. What fascinates me is how it is written. There seem to be bits and pieces of information in every episode, it seems that the writers tease us by leaving clues for the audience to figure out the story. But let me tell you, no matter how much you think you know, the events that occur will stun you, right up to it's amazing season finale. To be honest, after watching the 1st episode, the show did not immediately appeal to me...I found it very slow paced but give it time, it will definitely leave a lasting impression.The cast are nothing short of impressive. Because there is less dialogue, they have to be able to ""act"" out their feelings and thoughts. They do a more than commendable job, especially Nick Stahl who plays Ben Hawkins. But really, everyone else around him provides the backbone for this show as well. Other things that left me in wonder is the set, and the costumes. It creates a very real-like atmosphere of the 30's and a time of suffering and stunted development.In short, this show continues to prove why HBO is the best channel out there. It breaks the norm of TV programming, it is actually like a long movie broken up to episodes, a show about good and evil, filled with hidden meanings and mystical powers. It's the kind of show that gets better with repeated viewings. Whatever reasons HBO had to end the show at Season 2, I'm sure it was a creative decision rather than a financial one.

851081,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B0002YLC1U,Phillip Frangules,"[3, 3]","There have been many shows that I have loved that have been cancelled prematurely, but the one that hurts the most is Carnivale. With only two seasons of a planned six finished, I feel Carnivale had the most promise and most wasted potential. There's a real interesting story and mythology set up here that, had it been allowed to finish, could have been something special.Should you still check out the series? Definitely. But you'll be cursing the executives once its over.Admittedly, it's not too hard to see why people didn't flock to the show. For one thing, it's almost impossible to sell. How does one describe it in the least amount of words? ""A tale of good and evil set in the backdrop of the Great Depression"" is the best I can come up with, but that's pretty vague. And even if you get them to watch it, the show is pretty slow at first and esoteric. This is really a show that requires patience, but it pays back in spades.What's the show about? It's about two different people in different parts of America. One is Ben Hawkins, a chain gang refugee who is picked up by a traveling carnival. The other is Brother Justin Crowe, a Methodist preacher. Both men exhibit strange supernatural abilities; Ben is able to heal others, whereas Justin is able to bend people to his will and force them to confront their greatest sins. One of them is the Child of Light, the other the Child of Darkness, and the fate of the world will ultimately be decided by them. Even that description doesn't do it justice. There's a lot going on here with both storylines with numerous characters and interweaving subplots. Everyone here gives a great performance, but the one that steals the show is Clancy Brown as Brother Justin. He's easily one of the most charismatic and fascinating characters on television, and his arc is at times more satisfying than the 'a-plot'.One thing that makes the show stand out is that it's clear a lot of thought was put beforehand into preparing the show's mythology. There's a dream sequence that takes place in a diner in the second episode, for example, that will likely have you scratching your head the first time you see it. On rewatching the series, you'll know the exact significance of what's going on. There are a lot of series that make stuff up as they go along and by the end of the series they're tripping over themselves trying to put everything together, so Carnivale is impressive in that its main arc is clearly planned out.I really can't say enough--the directing, writing, performances and overall production values are perfect.The DVDs themselves are pretty good. I'd love to see the show in high definition at one point, but the picture and sound are both perfect given the format's limitations. Each disc is given two episodes so you know they're not skimping out on the quality. The features, on the other hand, are a bit sparse. We have three commentaries--the first two are for the first two episodes, the last one is for the tenth. The first one is actually quite interesting as we learn about the genesis of the show (it was originally planned to be a movie but got too big). The other two commentaries are a bit 'meh', in part because I feel that they could have picked more eventful episodes. In particular, it would have been nice to have one for the finale. The featurette is standard EPK fluff but it works well enough.Despite its cancellation, the show is a must-see and worth your time.",5,An Unheralded Classic,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3447,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'shows', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'one', 'most', 'Carnivale', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'planned', 'six', 'finished', 'feel', 'Carnivale', 'had', 'most', 'promise', 'most', 'wasted', 'potential', 'real', 'interesting', 'story', 'mythology', 'set', 'up', 'here', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'finish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'special.Should', 'still', 'check', 'out', 'series', 'Definitely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cursing', 'executives', 'once', 'over.Admittedly', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'flock', 'show', 'one', 'thing', 'almost', 'impossible', 'sell', 'How', 'one', 'describe', 'least', 'amount', 'words', 'tale', 'good', 'evil', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Great', 'Depression', 'best', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'pretty', 'vague', 'even', 'get', 'watch', 'show', 'pretty', 'slow', 'first', 'esoteric', 'really', 'show', 'patience', 'back', 'spades.What', 'show', 'about', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'parts', 'America', 'One', 'Ben', 'Hawkins', 'chain', 'gang', 'refugee', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'other', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'Crowe', 'Methodist', 'preacher', 'men', 'exhibit', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'Ben', 'able', 'heal', 'others', 'whereas', 'Justin', 'able', 'bend', 'people', 'will', 'force', 'confront', 'greatest', 'sins', 'One', 'Child', 'Light', 'other', 'Child', 'Darkness', 'fate', 'world', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'decided', 'Even', 'description', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'storylines', 'numerous', 'characters', 'interweaving', 'subplots', 'Everyone', 'here', 'great', 'performance', 'one', 'show', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'charismatic', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'television', 'arc', 'times', 'more', 'satisfying', ""a-plot'.One"", 'thing', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'clear', 'lot', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'beforehand', 'preparing', 'show', 'mythology', 'dream', 'sequence', 'place', 'diner', 'second', 'episode', 'example', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'scratching', 'head', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'rewatching', 'series', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exact', 'significance', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'lot', 'series', 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'end', 'series', ""'re"", 'tripping', 'over', 'trying', 'put', 'everything', 'together', 'Carnivale', 'impressive', 'main', 'arc', 'clearly', 'planned', 'out.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'directing', 'writing', 'performances', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'perfect.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'show', 'high', 'definition', 'one', 'point', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'perfect', 'given', 'format', 'limitations', 'disc', 'given', 'two', 'episodes', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'skimping', 'out', 'quality', 'features', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'bit', 'sparse', 'have', 'three', 'commentaries', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'tenth', 'first', 'one', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'learn', 'genesis', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'be', 'movie', 'got', 'too', 'big', 'other', 'two', 'commentaries', 'are', 'bit', 'part', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'more', 'eventful', 'episodes', 'particular', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'one', 'finale', 'featurette', 'standard', 'EPK', 'fluff', 'well', 'enough.Despite', 'cancellation', 'show', 'must-see', 'time']",Carnivale: Season 1

Structured like a dense, epic novel, the production values are sumptuous, the acting uniformly ingenious, and the central mysteries complex and involving. The series, ostensibly about the final battle between good and evil, as wonder gives way to reason, is so firmly rooted in a three-dimensional, realistic world with three-dimensional realistic characters that I would classify it as more magical realism than science-fiction or fantasy. The characters drive the plot, rather than the other way around, which is a difficult feat to accomplish in such a complex narrative that includes shadowy symbolism and prophetic dreams. There have been complaints that the first season did not wrap up any loose ends, but why should it? Season 1 is but the prologue to this novel-for-television, and narratives are never concluded in the prologue. Be forewarned, though, if you are looking for a television show that does not tax your intellectual muscles and does not ask you to do some work to understand it, this is not the show for you. If, on the the other hand, you are looking for a show that is fascinating, multi-layered (the symbolism alone could be discussed for hours), and intellectually stimulating, with fantastical situations that still manages to maintain a strong verisimilitude of character and the time period in which it occurs (1934, the Great Depression, in the Dust Bowl), I would urge you to watch this DVD set immediately, so you can be caught up for the second season, which premieres January 9th.

Anderson) is like a father to his ""family"" of fringe dwelling freaks and other side show professionals -- some of whom appear to have otherworldly powers, including one Hawkins reveals about himself.This period drama dabbles in supernatural, spiritual, and fate-tempting conflicts that are not always clearly resolved, but certainly not unsatisfying if you surrender to the mystical journey that binds them in a time and place they cannot escape.Fabulous production design and cinematography heighten all facets of this drama that is much more about the process of revealed destiny than resolution of conflict.Like life, there are always loose ends, but it is the moments of mystery and wonder that catch our attention.

Tremendously restrained, the series takes its time to tell its tale, but that only gives the viewer more time to fall in love or hate with the many varied and sordid souls whose paths intertwine.Set in the glorious misery that was the Great Depression, ""Carnivale"" spins two distinct storylines that promise to meet one day in a furious clash.  The major storyline is of young Ben, an escaped convict who returns to his dust bowl home just in time for his mother to die and for his house to be demolished by bulldozer in a scene askew but derived from ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  Ben gets taken in by the Carnivale, a traveling circus of freaks, misfits, prostitutes, and rogues . . . not to mention the mysterious ""Management"" who is never seen but seems to know all.Along the way, Ben must deal with a strange gift of healing . . . but each act of healing comes with a hefty price tag.  He meets various and sundry characters of the Carnivale, some of whom wish him good and others who wish him ill, and it's never really clear whose agenda is clear and whose is hidden.  Ben must also confront his past, his parentage, and the twisting hellish nightmares that plague his sleep.The second story involves Brother Justin, a promising young Protestant minister.  At first, Brother Justin appears to be a paragon of what is good and noble in a churchman, but soon Justin becomes endowed with fantastic powers.  He tries to use them for good, but there is something . . . unsettling . . . about Brother Justin, and he finds himself sliding closer and closer to a version of himself that he does not recognize.Building to a horrifying climax, Season One promises that the clash of good and evil is not yet imminent, but it is looming on the horizon.  Along the way, ""Carnivale"" introduces us to one of the most well-realized cast of individual characters ever seen in a single season of a TV show.This is a voluptuous production, for all its dusty, windblown vistas.  Look for lots and lots of sex and quite a bit of blood and some very, very dark images.

Other times you see something and its a miracle in the works. The only thing with miracles is that sometimes, when you close enough, you notice they have a price. and the miracles in this show seem to have a really steep one.Carnivale begins in the middle of the Dust Bowl, with an old home about to be torn down. A son sits with his mother and says he can ease her pain but, strangely, she calls him the spawn of the Devil and says she'd rather die. She does, too, and after the son sees her buried he also sees something that he can't quite make out - in some ways it seems like an opprotunity and in others it seems like another way to find his time wasted. Regardless, he knows he has nothing to lose and gears up for what becomes a weird and wild ride through the middle of the nothing, encountering blackened miracles and false prophets on his way to something more.Its really an interesting story.As far as everything goes, the story does develop slowly and, sometimes, you feel as though you are bbeing left out of something. There are other times when that same piece comes back and brings you into the fold, noting exactly why something happened and exactly how it fits in. The thing that keeps this from hurting the story is good acting and little oddities that seem to plague this place, from a girl who tells fortunes through the voice of a mother only she can hear to even strange variations of odd.That's what drew me in - the places they stop, the ways things move; everything revolves and evolves until it it becomes the thing you want and more.for the cost of the product, you really have nothing to lose. You also have another season to go through as well and, when the two meet, all sorts of visions seem to mnaifest.

I never saw it new on HBO, but I have both seasons on DVD and I'm almos done with seson 2.  Season 1 is a bit like a big jigsaw puzzle.  You have an idea what the picture is, but you're never quite sure how one piece of information fits with the rest...But it makes it much more interesting because you can play along rather than have eveything handed to you.This is a period piece during the 1930's depression period.  This has the look and feel like it was shot on location during those times....Right down to how most everyone looks really grubby because of the extreme drought in the midwest during he ""Dust Bowl"" period.The cast basically look like every day people (Well except for the Freak Show characters).  You'll not find too many Bay Watch wanna bees here.  In fact most characters really appear like they really are just ordinary folk of that time.  HBO has had a great standard with so many of their series to create cass that look more like what you'd actually find rather than the model looking characters you find in soaps and many of the weekly series on commercial tv.If you never seen it and like good writing, acting, and directing along with a very strange format, then this is something you'll want to see....As for strange...Well here's an example of ""Family Values.""  You meet a mother. father and two daughters who seem like any well adjusted family you might meet most anyplace.  They seem to care deeply for one and other and act basically like any other family....Except their business is the ""Hoochie"" show where Mom and the girls strip and dad is the barker who gets the guys in and uses keen salesmanship to get them to spend the little money they have.  He's also in charge of pimping mom and the girls out.  They all seem to pretty much look at it as a business like they were just an acting troupe or something.  The dynamics of that family relationship towards each other and their business is stranger than anything I've ever seen around the subject of prostitution.....And that's just one of the strange aspects of this series.....It's a damn shame it only went for two seasons....One thing about getting to the end of season one....You have more than just a cliff hanger....You have many questions you want answered so you're pretty much compelled to get season 2.....And then the story really starts weave together.",5,JIGSAW,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2467,"['many', 'others', 'too', 'feel', 'messed', 'up', 'not', 'continuing', 'series', 'try', 'promote', 'bit', 'more', 'never', 'saw', 'new', 'HBO', 'have', 'seasons', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'almos', 'done', 'seson', '2', 'Season', '1', 'bit', 'big', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'picture', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'one', 'piece', 'information', 'fits', 'rest', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'can', 'play', 'along', 'rather', 'have', 'eveything', 'handed', 'you.This', 'period', 'piece', '1930', 'depression', 'period', 'look', 'feel', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'times', '.Right', 'down', 'how', 'most', 'everyone', 'really', 'grubby', 'extreme', 'drought', 'midwest', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'period.The', 'cast', 'basically', 'look', 'day', 'people', 'Well', 'Freak', 'Show', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'not', 'find', 'too', 'many', 'Bay', 'Watch', 'wan', 'na', 'bees', 'here', 'fact', 'most', 'characters', 'really', 'appear', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'time', 'HBO', 'had', 'great', 'standard', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'create', 'cass', 'look', 'more', 'what', ""'d"", 'actually', 'find', 'rather', 'model', 'looking', 'characters', 'find', 'soaps', 'many', 'weekly', 'series', 'commercial', 'tv.If', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'along', 'very', 'strange', 'format', 'then', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', '.As', 'strange', 'Well', 'here', 'example', 'Family', 'Values', 'meet', 'mother', 'father', 'two', 'daughters', 'who', 'seem', 'well', 'adjusted', 'family', 'might', 'meet', 'most', 'anyplace', 'seem', 'care', 'deeply', 'one', 'other', 'act', 'basically', 'other', 'family', 'business', 'Hoochie', 'show', 'where', 'Mom', 'girls', 'strip', 'dad', 'barker', 'who', 'guys', 'uses', 'keen', 'salesmanship', 'get', 'spend', 'little', 'money', 'have', 'also', 'charge', 'pimping', 'mom', 'girls', 'out', 'seem', 'pretty', 'much', 'look', 'business', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'troupe', 'something', 'dynamics', 'family', 'relationship', 'other', 'business', 'stranger', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'subject', 'prostitution', 'just', 'one', 'strange', 'aspects', 'series', '..It', 'damn', 'shame', 'only', 'went', 'two', 'seasons', '.One', 'thing', 'getting', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'more', 'just', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'have', 'many', 'questions', 'want', 'answered', 'so', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'compelled', 'get', 'season', '2', '..And', 'then', 'story', 'really', 'weave', 'together']",Carnivale: Season 1
