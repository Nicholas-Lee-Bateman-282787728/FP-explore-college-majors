Luster ""The Rook""","[1, 1]","Although this may be considered a B Movie and not the very best effects by todays standards, it still is a good deal of fun for most families. As a child I saw this with my family and we found it entertaining. Since I am still entertained by most fantasy and science fiction movies I enjoyed as a child, I think most will agree there certainly is a niche for this type movie for families today. If for no other reason it is family friendly, and lots of fantasy and scifi today are not. The movie is loosely based on some of the fairytales told by the Grimm brothers.

640075,A21L4MMBEN7TIW,B00005JOD1,"Joseph P. Durham, Jr.","[0, 0]","I was a fan of Cinerama from the very first time I walked into the theater and saw the size of the screen. In fact, I remember saying something about it at the time (10-years-old or thereabouts)around 1956. I had already seen CinemaScope, Todd-AO and Vista-Vision, but Cinerama really enthralled me. I went to the theater to see Cinerama every chance I got, which wasn't that often. Then, came the bad news. The Cinerama theater in downtown Minneapolis would no longer show Cinerama. They would revert to the old 70 mm. projections. Then, a year or so later, came the good news. Cinerama would be building a brand new theater for nothing but Cinerama out on Wayzata Boulevard. I couldn't wait to see it, and was impressed with the completely round building. Again, I was impressed with Cinerama, although this time I was considerably older. I still enjoyed the first movie shown there, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. Not knowing Cinerama was in its demise, only one more movie would be made using the three-strip process, I still was impressed with Cinerama at the new theater. In fact, the program notes for both Brothers Grimm and the subsequent picture How the West Was Won said this would be only the start of continuous Cinerama movies for years to come. HTW3 was the last in the three-strip process, however. Cinerama's name would continue to be used for another seven or eight years, but it was not the same. You did not have the same feeling of participation in the picture as you did with the old Cinerama. WWBG made full use of the process, especially in the fairy stories the Dancing Princess and the Singing Bone. The ride down the mountain in the old carriage was as good as any Cinerama thrill shot before, bringing back memories of the rollar coaster ride and the bobsled ride from earlier productions. HTW3 continued with several exciting action sequences built into the story. No other movie even came close. It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, the first movie without the three-strip still to be called Cinerama, tried hard, but failed miserably. Grand Prix, the racing picture, probably gave the best effort at it, and in fact was considered to be ahead of its time with the special effects photography.I was therefore especially deligted when Flicker Alley decided to release the first Cinerama This is Cinerama and Windjammer to coincide with Cineram's 60th anniversary last year. While Windjammer wasn't exactly Cinerama, it was done in a similar process called Cinemiracle and it still had the quality of Cinerama. Both TIC and W were released on dvd in what they call the smilebox process which simulates the curved Cinerama screen and gives you some idea of how the process worked.The 5.1 stereo sound gives a pretty good idea of the seven-channel stereo sound, the first ever to be successful.  One would hope the other four pictures including WWBG would be released in this manner. I understand HTW3 is in smilebox on dvd, but I haven't seen it as yet. So, here's hoping we see more of these releases on dvd, especially including WWBG.",4,At long last Cinerama tells a story,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,3071,"['was', 'fan', 'Cinerama', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'walked', 'theater', 'saw', 'size', 'screen', 'fact', 'remember', 'saying', 'something', 'time', '10-years-old', 'thereabouts', '1956', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'CinemaScope', 'Todd-AO', 'Vista-Vision', 'Cinerama', 'really', 'enthralled', 'went', 'theater', 'see', 'Cinerama', 'chance', 'got', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'often', 'Then', 'came', 'bad', 'news', 'Cinerama', 'theater', 'downtown', 'Minneapolis', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'show', 'Cinerama', 'would', 'revert', 'old', '70', 'mm', 'projections', 'Then', 'year', 'so', 'later', 'came', 'good', 'news', 'Cinerama', 'would', 'be', 'building', 'brand', 'new', 'theater', 'nothing', 'Cinerama', 'out', 'Wayzata', 'Boulevard', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'was', 'impressed', 'completely', 'round', 'building', 'Again', 'was', 'impressed', 'Cinerama', 'time', 'was', 'considerably', 'older', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'shown', 'there', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'Not', 'knowing', 'Cinerama', 'was', 'demise', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'using', 'three-strip', 'process', 'still', 'was', 'impressed', 'Cinerama', 'new', 'theater', 'fact', 'program', 'notes', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'subsequent', 'picture', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'start', 'continuous', 'Cinerama', 'movies', 'years', 'come', 'HTW3', 'was', 'last', 'three-strip', 'process', 'however', 'Cinerama', 'name', 'would', 'continue', 'be', 'used', 'seven', 'eight', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'feeling', 'participation', 'picture', 'did', 'old', 'Cinerama', 'WWBG', 'made', 'full', 'use', 'process', 'especially', 'fairy', 'Dancing', 'Princess', 'Singing', 'Bone', 'ride', 'mountain', 'old', 'carriage', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Cinerama', 'thrill', 'shot', 'bringing', 'back', 'memories', 'rollar', 'coaster', 'ride', 'bobsled', 'ride', 'earlier', 'productions', 'HTW3', 'continued', 'several', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'built', 'story', 'other', 'movie', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'first', 'movie', 'three-strip', 'still', 'be', 'called', 'Cinerama', 'tried', 'hard', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'racing', 'picture', 'probably', 'gave', 'best', 'effort', 'fact', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'ahead', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'photography.I', 'was', 'therefore', 'especially', 'deligted', 'when', 'Flicker', 'Alley', 'decided', 'release', 'first', 'Cinerama', 'Cinerama', 'Windjammer', 'coincide', 'Cineram', '60th', 'anniversary', 'last', 'year', 'Windjammer', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Cinerama', 'was', 'done', 'similar', 'process', 'called', 'Cinemiracle', 'still', 'had', 'quality', 'Cinerama', 'Both', 'TIC', 'W', 'were', 'released', 'dvd', 'what', 'call', 'smilebox', 'process', 'curved', 'Cinerama', 'screen', 'idea', 'how', 'process', 'worked.The', '5.1', 'stereo', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'seven-channel', 'stereo', 'sound', 'first', 'ever', 'be', 'successful', 'One', 'would', 'hope', 'other', 'four', 'pictures', 'including', 'WWBG', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'manner', 'understand', 'HTW3', 'smilebox', 'dvd', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'So', 'here', 'hoping', 'see', 'more', 'releases', 'dvd', 'especially', 'including', 'WWBG']",The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm

640077,AARUYE130LY8W,B00005JOD1,"Paul D. Race ""Writer, Teacher, Songwriter, Ra...","[7, 7]","The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm was filmed in Cinerama, with three cameras to provide a true panoramic view of the world.  The only important Cinerama film to have survived in a watchable version is How The West Was Won.  Unfortunately there are NO cinemas anywhere equipped to project Cinerama properly.  One of the last ones standing was the Dabel Cinema in Dayton, Ohio, which was closed decades ago.  :-( That said, you CAN watch How the West Was Won on a ""widescreen"" TV and enjoy it thoroughly. Too bad, the same can't be said of this treasure.I saw this as a child, and still remember the Terry Thomas/Buddy Hackett sequence (The Singing Bone) as my favorite movie segment of my entire youth.  The Dancing Princess segment is noteworthy as well.  Unfortunately, I saw it, not in true Cinerama, but in a 35mm print that was made so the movie could be shown in smaller movie houses.  About a third of the material captured by each of the outside cameras was sacrificed.  Then, as a result of years of careless storage on the part of the owners, the only surviving 70 mm print of the entire three-camera version was damaged beyond repair.The 35mm versions weren't treated much better.  When VHS came out, there was enough left to patch together one reasonably watchable print for transfer to video.Many comments here complain about the shabby 35mm-to-vhs conversion, but the problem is that the remaining 35mm versions are actually THAT BAD.We've seen other movies that were restored by computer to like-new condition, or in some cases, better-than-new.  I would love to see whoever owns the rights to this now cough up $10 million or whatever it takes to have someone reconstruct EITHER the 35mm version or what's left of the true Cinerama version frame by frame.In the meantime, if a DVD of this that's even REASONABLY watchable is ever produced, you owe it to your family to get it just for the fantasy sequences.  Special effects fans love to point out that those sequences pushed the state-of-the art in every direction back then. But I'll add that, because of the quality of the acting and direction, they are just as charming today.Five stars for the original content.
