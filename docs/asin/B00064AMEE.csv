Samantha Parkington (AnnaSophia Robb) is an eight-year-old girl who is sent to live with her grandmother (Mia Farrow) after the tragic death of her parents. While grandmother takes it upon herself to teach Samantha how to behave like a lady, the girl finds she misses her best friend Nellie (Kelsey Lewis), a servant girl who became her closest companion. A visit to the bustling city of New York, however, holds both excitement and welcome surprises for SamanthaThis movie is one that  you will enjoy  over and over again because it is made in  such  a way  that  it just  holds your attention during the hour and 26 minutes it runs.if you want  to  have an enjoyable time and,  shed a tear or 2, then this  is just  the movie for you!",5,A WONDERFUL  MOVIE FOR ALL!!,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,904,"['characters', 'popular', 'American', 'Girls', 'series', 'books', 'come', 'life', 'made-for-television', 'drama', 'set', 'dawning', 'years', '20th', 'Century', 'Samantha', 'Parkington', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'eight-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'sent', 'live', 'grandmother', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'tragic', 'death', 'parents', 'grandmother', 'teach', 'Samantha', 'how', 'behave', 'lady', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'Nellie', 'Kelsey', 'Lewis', 'servant', 'girl', 'who', 'became', 'closest', 'companion', 'visit', 'bustling', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'however', 'excitement', 'welcome', 'surprises', 'SamanthaThis', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again', 'made', 'such', 'way', 'just', 'attention', 'hour', '26', 'minutes', 'runs.if', 'want', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'shed', 'tear', '2', 'then', 'just', 'movie']",Samantha - An American Girl Holiday

This movie was sweet and enjoyable as well as well-cast (although Mia Farrow's Grandmary was a bit younger and less stern than the Grandmary in the books). A few changes have been made to the plot; for example, Aunt Cornelia's younger sisters Agnes and Agatha, who are Samantha's age, have been left out (probably the biggest and most disappointing change to the story); Jenny, Nellie's sister, is now mute; and Samantha's speaking out against child labor in a speaking contest gets her disqualified from the contest, unlike in the book, where she wins the contest. However, the movie's plot still has many scenes Samantha fans will recognize from the books, and Samantha fans will enjoy seeing actress AnnaSophia Robb (Samantha) dressed in all of the clothes girls can buy for their Samantha doll. If you have not read the Samantha books, I recommend reading them before seeing this movie.

859731,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00064AMEE,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 3]","Girls who search for American Girl stories in book stores and parents who purchase them all the time for them will both enjoy this warm holiday treat based on the very popular Samantha. The books about young Samantha are among the most popular in the sought after series. Authors Valerie Tripp, Susan S. Adler, and Maxine Rose Schur have all contributed to the character wonderfully brought to life by director Nadia Tass in this most enjoyable holiday film for the family.Set during the turn of the century in Bedford, New York, Samantha finds three friends in Nelly (Kelsey Lewis), Jennie (Olivia Ballantyne), and Bridget O'Malley (Hannah Endicott-Douglas), three young girls without the luxuries afforded Samantha with her Grandmary (Mia Farrow) who have come to work next door. Nellie is Samantha's age and soon they are best friends. Annasophia Robb was the perfect choice for Samantha and  is also excellent as her best pal Nellie.Samantha's Uncle Gard (Jordan Bridges), her last real tie to her deceased mother, has come to visit and brought with him an independent woman named Cornelia (Rebecca Maddy) he is engaged to marry. Worried she will be forgotten at first, Samantha soon warms to her and offers her mother's bridal veil when hers is damaged by fire. She is separated from Nellie and her friends, however, when she must go to New York City with the newly married couple while her grandmary vacations.Set in 1904, it is nice to see through Samantha's eyes the changing times as she writes to Nellie about her adventures in the big city. When Nellie's father dies, however, the three girls are sent to an orphanage where they are mistreated. Samantha's school paper on factories will change drastically when she sees firsthand the dangerous child labor used in them while searching for her friend. Samantha hides the girls in her home after helping them escape but must reveal the truth when little Bridget becomes ill.While it may be a predictable solution the viewer can see coming from the very beginning, there is a real warmth here and a special Christmas for everyone's favorite American Girl, Samantha. This is a very nice film for the holidays families will delight in, especially those with girls Samantha's age and younger. Those who enjoy the books or hear about them all the time from their kids will not be disappointed by this nicely filmed movie set during Christmas.

Samantha is a kind, young girl, who occupies herself when she can by reading, and doing needlepoint like her Grandmary wants, but when a young servant girl named Nellie O'Malley (Kelsey Lewis) moves in next-door, all that changes. Soon Samantha and Nellie are experiencing all kinds of adventures together. That is, until Samantha's beloved Uncle Gard (Jordan Bridges), and his new wife, Cornelia (Rebecca Mader), decide to take Samantha to New York to live with them.

This movie tells the story of Samantha's developing friendship with Nellie O' Malley, the daughter of an Irish domestic servant.  As the film progresses, the viewer enjoys the breakdown of distinctions between social classes, first among the children, then among the adults.From an historical perspective, it shows the life of the wealthy, their servants and the suffragette movement.The movie is Pollyannaish, to be sure, but still delightful.

The story revolves around Samantha who is an orphan living with her GrandMary in 1904 Mt. Bedford, New York. Samantha is being raised by her grandmother as her parents died in a boat accident while she was an infant. As the movie begins Samantha is playing with Eddie Rylan, her neighbor. Samantha's grandmother is raising her to take her place in society, however Samantha likes to run, jump and climb trees, quite the contrast to what her GrandMary has in mind. The Rylan's have recently hired an Irish immigrant family from New York City to serve as their live in servants. The family is comprised of a widower,Mr. O'Malley and his three daughters, Nellie, Bridget and Jenny. The family had lived in New York City where the girls worked in a thread factory to support their family. After meeting the O'Malley's Samantha's Uncle Gardner comes to visit with his fiancee' Corneila. Samantha is not pleased with their engagement, but over time accepts Corneila as part of their family and even gives Corneila her mother's wedding veil after hers is destroyed by fire. Samantha moves to New York City to live with Uncle Garnder and Aunt Cornelia while GrandMary leaves to visit relatives out of state. While living in New York Samantha discovers that the O'Malley sisters have lost their father and are living at Cold Rock Orphange which is controlled by the nasty Mrs. Frouchy. Samantha also discovers that Mrs. Frouchy is embellzing money from the orphange and has plans to split up the O'Malley sisters by sending Nellie on the orphan train. Samantha and Nellie plan for the girls escape, which leads them to Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila's attic. All is going well until Bridget becomes sick, leaving Samantha to confess to her Aunt and Uncle what she has done. In the meantime Gardner and Cornelia learn of what really goes on at Cold Rock Orphange and through Mrs. Vandergelds assistance bring an end to the reign of Mrs. Frouchy. In the end Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila ask Samantha to stay with them permanently as GrandMary is getting married. On Christmas morning there is a surprise for everyone, Gardner and Corneila are planning to adopt the O'Malley girls so Samantha will have sisters and they will be a family.This movie was faithful to the original books, the screenplay, casting, directing and musical score are brillant!This movie is one you will want to watch again and again with your family.",5,Beautiful Adaptation of the Book!,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2498,"['movie', 'beautiful', 'adaptation', 'American', 'Girl', 'book', 'series', 'Samantha', 'story', 'Samantha', 'who', 'orphan', 'living', 'GrandMary', '1904', 'Mt', 'Bedford', 'New', 'York', 'Samantha', 'being', 'raised', 'grandmother', 'parents', 'died', 'boat', 'accident', 'was', 'infant', 'movie', 'Samantha', 'playing', 'Eddie', 'Rylan', 'neighbor', 'Samantha', 'grandmother', 'raising', 'take', 'place', 'society', 'however', 'Samantha', 'run', 'jump', 'climb', 'trees', 'quite', 'contrast', 'what', 'GrandMary', 'mind', 'Rylan', 'have', 'recently', 'hired', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'serve', 'live', 'servants', 'family', 'comprised', 'widower', 'Mr', ""O'Malley"", 'three', 'daughters', 'Nellie', 'Bridget', 'Jenny', 'family', 'had', 'lived', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'girls', 'worked', 'thread', 'factory', 'support', 'family', 'meeting', ""O'Malley"", 'Samantha', 'Uncle', 'Gardner', 'visit', 'fiancee', 'Corneila', 'Samantha', 'not', 'pleased', 'engagement', 'time', 'accepts', 'Corneila', 'part', 'family', 'even', 'Corneila', 'mother', 'wedding', 'veil', 'hers', 'destroyed', 'fire', 'Samantha', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'live', 'Uncle', 'Garnder', 'Aunt', 'Cornelia', 'GrandMary', 'visit', 'relatives', 'state', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'Samantha', ""O'Malley"", 'sisters', 'have', 'lost', 'father', 'are', 'living', 'Cold', 'Rock', 'Orphange', 'controlled', 'nasty', 'Mrs.', 'Frouchy', 'Samantha', 'also', 'Mrs.', 'Frouchy', 'embellzing', 'money', 'orphange', 'plans', 'split', 'up', ""O'Malley"", 'sisters', 'sending', 'Nellie', 'orphan', 'train', 'Samantha', 'Nellie', 'plan', 'girls', 'escape', 'Uncle', 'Gardner', 'Aunt', 'Corneila', 'attic', 'going', 'well', 'Bridget', 'sick', 'leaving', 'Samantha', 'confess', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'what', 'done', 'meantime', 'Gardner', 'Cornelia', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'Cold', 'Rock', 'Orphange', 'Mrs.', 'Vandergelds', 'assistance', 'bring', 'end', 'reign', 'Mrs.', 'Frouchy', 'end', 'Uncle', 'Gardner', 'Aunt', 'Corneila', 'ask', 'Samantha', 'stay', 'permanently', 'GrandMary', 'getting', 'married', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'Gardner', 'Corneila', 'are', 'planning', 'adopt', ""O'Malley"", 'girls', 'so', 'Samantha', 'will', 'have', 'sisters', 'will', 'be', 'family.This', 'movie', 'was', 'faithful', 'original', 'books', 'screenplay', 'casting', 'directing', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'brillant', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'family']",Samantha - An American Girl Holiday

Hart,"[45, 49]","I was probably Samantha's age when I got into the American Girls books, and now I'm closer to Aunt Cornelia's age, which is a little mind-boggling to me.  I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I really liked it, and my husband did too.  Some of the actors are better than others, but AnnaSophia Robb really carries her role.  If her hair color were as convincing as her acting, it would be easy to get lost in the moment.  Mia Farrow, Jordan Bridges, and Rebecca Mader all do a great job, as well.I did notice some odd little plot changes and wonder why they were there.  Was Jessie's storyline cut because of time restrictions?  Was it impossible to include non-Nellie-related adventures?  Did we really see, in the movie, how important Lydia (the doll) was to Samantha and how significant it was to give her away?  And wasn't the jar stolen from Eddie Ryland originally full of bugs rather than coins?Most of my issues with the movie are based on my having read the books rather than on the movie itself (although I do wonder why the girls can't pronounce ""da""!), and the movie can stand on its own--it's that good.  The whole family can enjoy a movie like this together; although the DVD extras do seem to be aimed at the younger portion of the family audience, they are interesting for even adults to watch once.

She is desperate for a friend her own age so when Nellie O'Malley and her family move in next door to become the Ryland family servants, Samantha is giddy with excitement. Finally somebody to play with!Soon after she begins to hang out with Nellie, Samantha makes an uncomfortable realization that not every child is able to enjoy the leisure activities which she has taken for granted. Instead, Nellie has to work for her own survival. Because work is a new concept for Samantha, she did not recognize that Mrs. Ryland would have been offended by the impromptu sleepover held in the boathouse after Samantha thought she was unwanted by Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia.When Samantha attempts to track Nellie down after Bridget becomes sick, she discovers what factories are really like. In an indictment which (unfortunately remains relevant) Nellie tells Samantha that people do not like to think about where the clothes they buy come from. Samantha was visibly horrified to learn her fine and elegant clothes came from a dirty factory which hurt other children who were not much older than herself.Samantha did not win the speaking contest at school in this version of the tale, but she did impress Aunt Cornelia--who promptly asked Samantha to give the anti-child labor speech for her women's group. Uncle Gard's good natured teasing indicated that he actually likes independent women who are not afraid to stand up for their rights.In addition to the classist analysis, I also appreciated Aunt Cornelia's suffragist friends reminding Samantha that it was important for young women to become involved in efforts to win the vote (and presumably other rights). Inter-generational mentoring ensures the causes we care about are not time sensitive.The movie takes some liberties with the series (the 'birthday story' and the 'summer story' are eliminated altogether), characters (Gertrude is too nice, and Nellie's father never appeared in the books...etc) but I was generally pleased with the casting decisions. I also liked the transitions between time----which really could have been botched since covering most of a book series is very difficult in an hour.This movie is recommended to anybody who likes family fare without excessive sugar mixed in.",5,A new holiday classic,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2531,"['had', 'also', 'grown', 'up', 'American', 'Girls', 'remembering', 'when', 'were', 'only', 'three', 'dolls', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'delighted', 'learn', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'television.Samantha', 'Parkington', 'wealthy', 'Grandmary', 'Mount', 'Bedford', 'New', 'York', 'desperate', 'friend', 'own', 'age', 'so', 'when', 'Nellie', ""O'Malley"", 'family', 'move', 'next', 'door', 'become', 'Ryland', 'family', 'servants', 'Samantha', 'giddy', 'excitement', 'Finally', 'somebody', 'play', 'Soon', 'hang', 'out', 'Nellie', 'Samantha', 'uncomfortable', 'realization', 'not', 'child', 'able', 'enjoy', 'leisure', 'activities', 'taken', 'granted', 'Instead', 'Nellie', 'work', 'own', 'survival', 'work', 'new', 'concept', 'Samantha', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'Mrs.', 'Ryland', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'impromptu', 'sleepover', 'held', 'boathouse', 'Samantha', 'thought', 'was', 'unwanted', 'Uncle', 'Gard', 'Aunt', 'Cornelia.When', 'Samantha', 'attempts', 'track', 'Nellie', 'down', 'Bridget', 'sick', 'what', 'factories', 'are', 'really', 'like', 'indictment', 'unfortunately', 'relevant', 'Nellie', 'Samantha', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'where', 'clothes', 'buy', 'come', 'Samantha', 'was', 'visibly', 'horrified', 'learn', 'fine', 'elegant', 'clothes', 'came', 'dirty', 'factory', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'much', 'older', 'herself.Samantha', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'speaking', 'contest', 'school', 'version', 'tale', 'did', 'impress', 'Aunt', 'Cornelia', 'who', 'promptly', 'asked', 'Samantha', 'give', 'anti-child', 'labor', 'speech', 'women', 'group', 'Uncle', 'Gard', 'good', 'natured', 'teasing', 'indicated', 'actually', 'independent', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'rights.In', 'addition', 'classist', 'analysis', 'also', 'appreciated', 'Aunt', 'Cornelia', 'suffragist', 'friends', 'reminding', 'Samantha', 'was', 'important', 'young', 'women', 'become', 'involved', 'efforts', 'win', 'vote', 'presumably', 'other', 'rights', 'Inter-generational', 'mentoring', 'causes', 'care', 'are', 'not', 'time', 'sensitive.The', 'movie', 'liberties', 'series', ""'birthday"", 'story', ""'summer"", 'story', 'are', 'eliminated', 'altogether', 'characters', 'Gertrude', 'too', 'nice', 'Nellie', 'father', 'never', 'appeared', 'books', 'etc', 'was', 'generally', 'pleased', 'casting', 'decisions', 'also', 'liked', 'transitions', 'time', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'botched', 'covering', 'most', 'book', 'series', 'very', 'difficult', 'hour.This', 'movie', 'recommended', 'anybody', 'who', 'family', 'fare', 'excessive', 'sugar', 'mixed']",Samantha - An American Girl Holiday

859762,A6FIAB28IS79,B00064AMEE,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","I'd never heard of ""American Girl Dolls"" until accompanying two grand-daughters aged 5 and 6 to the ""doll house"" in Water Tower Place (Chicago), where I was greeted by two floors of the latest ""must-have"" toy (personally, I prefer Barbie).  Brunettes, blondes, dolls with and without glasses, dolls in wheel-chairs, injured cheerleader dolls with broken legs in splints--they're all here.  And of course there's a doll hospital (glancing at the rates was enough to make me wonder about Medicare or a similar back-up plan for dolls) and hair stylist (charging three times more than my barber).  Soon the color pink began to overwhelm all other colors, making it difficult not only to distinguish among dolls but to separate the doll's diner from the doll's dressing room (though expect to break the monotony of pink with a generous amount of green when it comes time to pay up).I was about to purchase the video ""Samantha"" as a gift to grand-daughter Samantha and her doll Samantha--perhaps a way to intensify and prolong the experience.  I'm glad I waited.  Amazon's price for the video is half the sticker price at American Girl Store. [I said ""was."" Suddenly Amazon's price is only 10-15% lower than the store's.]  But it's also a fairly impressive movie--just under 90 minutes, decent production values (recreating the two main classes of late Victorian society), an exceptional print (Blu Ray, richly saturated deep colors, carefully composed shots), exceptional performances (the child actress playing Samantha is a natural and even Mia Farrow is no less attractive for finally looking her age).The plot is simple, raising more questions than it answers, but the sentiment works, thanks to the Dickensian tone, which distances us enough from the subject to avoid blatant, patronizing melodrama.  Still, an attempt to criticize employers who will stop at nothing (including the unconscionable exploitation of children in factories operating on the backs of orphans) misses the mark.  Far more effective is the representation of a romantic couple not so preoccupied with their infatuation for each other and personal plans for creation of their own nuclear family to open not merely their pocketbooks but their hearts and home to three orphaned children.  No matter that the orphanage is still not lacking for residents: the magnanimous gesture of the newly-married couple is an act of love that remains with the viewer because it goes ""all the way,"" serving as a reminder that every child deserves a loving family.The ties that bind the human family go beyond mere blood, religious (or political) affiliations, ethnicity, race, and even social status and wealth (though it's clear that the adopting, newly-married couple of the movie are sufficiently financed to start out as a quintet rather than a couple). No one likes abortion, but a story as simple as this makes the point that human selfishness that ""kills"" the spirit of living children is even more despicable.",4,"Better than expected, but this is the copy to purchase.",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,2972,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'American', 'Girl', 'Dolls', 'accompanying', 'two', 'grand-daughters', 'aged', '5', '6', 'doll', 'house', 'Water', 'Tower', 'Place', 'Chicago', 'where', 'was', 'greeted', 'two', 'floors', 'latest', 'must-have', 'toy', 'personally', 'prefer', 'Barbie', 'Brunettes', 'blondes', 'dolls', 'glasses', 'dolls', 'wheel-chairs', 'injured', 'cheerleader', 'dolls', 'broken', 'legs', 'splints', ""'re"", 'here', 'course', 'doll', 'hospital', 'glancing', 'rates', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'wonder', 'Medicare', 'similar', 'back-up', 'plan', 'dolls', 'hair', 'stylist', 'charging', 'three', 'times', 'more', 'barber', 'color', 'pink', 'began', 'overwhelm', 'other', 'colors', 'making', 'difficult', 'not', 'only', 'distinguish', 'dolls', 'separate', 'doll', 'diner', 'doll', 'dressing', 'room', 'expect', 'break', 'monotony', 'pink', 'generous', 'amount', 'green', 'when', 'time', 'pay', 'up', '.I', 'was', 'purchase', 'video', 'Samantha', 'gift', 'grand-daughter', 'Samantha', 'doll', 'Samantha', 'perhaps', 'way', 'intensify', 'prolong', 'experience', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'Amazon', 'price', 'video', 'sticker', 'price', 'American', 'Girl', 'Store', '[', 'said', 'was', 'Suddenly', 'Amazon', 'price', 'only', '10-15', '%', 'lower', 'store', ']', 'also', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'movie', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'recreating', 'two', 'main', 'classes', 'late', 'Victorian', 'society', 'exceptional', 'print', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'richly', 'saturated', 'deep', 'colors', 'carefully', 'composed', 'shots', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'child', 'actress', 'playing', 'Samantha', 'natural', 'even', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'less', 'attractive', 'finally', 'looking', 'age', '.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'raising', 'more', 'questions', 'sentiment', 'thanks', 'Dickensian', 'tone', 'enough', 'subject', 'avoid', 'blatant', 'patronizing', 'melodrama', 'Still', 'attempt', 'criticize', 'employers', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'including', 'unconscionable', 'exploitation', 'children', 'factories', 'operating', 'backs', 'orphans', 'mark', 'Far', 'more', 'effective', 'representation', 'romantic', 'couple', 'not', 'so', 'preoccupied', 'infatuation', 'other', 'personal', 'plans', 'creation', 'own', 'nuclear', 'family', 'open', 'not', 'merely', 'pocketbooks', 'hearts', 'home', 'three', 'orphaned', 'children', 'matter', 'orphanage', 'still', 'not', 'lacking', 'residents', 'magnanimous', 'gesture', 'newly-married', 'couple', 'act', 'love', 'viewer', 'way', 'serving', 'reminder', 'child', 'loving', 'family.The', 'ties', 'bind', 'human', 'family', 'go', 'mere', 'blood', 'religious', 'political', 'affiliations', 'ethnicity', 'race', 'even', 'social', 'status', 'wealth', 'clear', 'adopting', 'newly-married', 'couple', 'movie', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'financed', 'start', 'out', 'quintet', 'rather', 'couple', 'one', 'abortion', 'story', 'as', 'simple', 'point', 'human', 'selfishness', 'kills', 'spirit', 'living', 'children', 'even', 'more', 'despicable']",Samantha - An American Girl Holiday
