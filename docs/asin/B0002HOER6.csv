Gammill,"[8, 10]","Fans of Alfred Hitchcock's more popular films like Vertigo, Rear Window and North By Northwest may be at first a bit put-off by the serious nature of this film.  To be sure, the film is well-directed and generates some real tension.  But that suspense comes not from breath-taking chases or fabulous set pieces, but from the investment the viewer puts into the characters.I admit I'm a huge fan of the Hitchcock colloborations with James Stewart, so I wasn't sure how well I would like Henry Fonda.  But he is excellent as Manny...very believable and sympathetic.  Even more impressive is Vera Miles as Manny's wife, who goes from adoring partner to a closed shell of psychosis by the film's end.  In fact, I for one forgave the script's last-act change of focus (from Manny to his wife) because I was so caught up in Miles' performance.  In all of Hitchcock's impressive body of work, only Vertigo has a more downbeat resolution.Although it's certainly not as technically brilliant as many of the director's better-known works, THE WRONG MAN is worth seeing for the excellent casting, and the fact that it's really unlike any other Hitchcock film.",3,Atypical thriller helped by terrific performances,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1148,"['Fans', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'more', 'popular', 'films', 'Vertigo', 'Rear', 'Window', 'North', 'Northwest', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'bit', 'put-off', 'serious', 'nature', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'well-directed', 'real', 'tension', 'suspense', 'not', 'breath-taking', 'chases', 'fabulous', 'set', 'pieces', 'investment', 'viewer', 'characters.I', 'admit', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Hitchcock', 'colloborations', 'James', 'Stewart', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'like', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'excellent', 'Manny', 'very', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Manny', 'wife', 'who', 'adoring', 'partner', 'closed', 'shell', 'psychosis', 'film', 'end', 'fact', 'one', 'forgave', 'script', 'last-act', 'change', 'focus', 'Manny', 'wife', 'was', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'Miles', 'performance', 'Hitchcock', 'impressive', 'body', 'work', 'only', 'Vertigo', 'more', 'downbeat', 'certainly', 'not', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'many', 'director', 'better-known', 'works', 'THE', 'WRONG', 'MAN', 'worth', 'seeing', 'excellent', 'casting', 'fact', 'really', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'film']",N/A
833749,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0002HOER6,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 4]","Yah, they, the they here meaning the New York City cops, the fuzz, New York's finest, the big bad blue line, the line that keeps eight million stories from totally being  about guys croaking each other (and gals too) back to Adam and Eve time, got the wrong guy on that Associated robbery (armed from what I heard, Christ, armed for nickels and dimes, a couple of hundred bucks max, which might have been some dough back then but is strictly walking daddy money now), some square gee from over in Jackson Heights, a guy named Manny. Yah, a square named Manny (played by Henry Fonda) who kept nine to five hours, except he worked in some two- bit house band playing some sad ass bass, no be-bop Dizzie or hothouse Coltrane rip stuff just trip over your partner, your drunk partner, dance plug music, for the Mayfair swells over at the Stork Club so his nine to five was night time. And except that he was a gee that was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he tried borrow a little dough off of his wife's insurance policy for coffee and cakes (okay, okay some wife's serious dental work) from Associated over in some sleaze back alley office building filled with failed dentists, fledgling lawyers, repo men, and claims adjusters. And surprise, surprise since Associated had dough on the premises right in the cash drawer they got knocked over a couple of times by some desperate junkie looking for some next fix dough. Strictly low-rent stuff.But here is where the wrong time and place come in. The clerks, the female clerks, swore on seven, hell, seventy bibles, that Manny was the guy, the right guy, and told the cops the story that way. And the cops bought it. Bought it number one because no right gee like Manny could be that right, although with all the up front and personal shots of him sweating things out he could have been the guy for a while even in my jaded book, and number two bought it because, well, because it cleared up about a half dozen unsolved armed robberies in the neighborhood with one hand. So they, the cops, showed our boy Manny what justice New York- style looked like (although any amateur or even a fledgling lawyer from that sleaze- ball office building could have had him habe'd out in about fifteen minutes with no third degree, and no heavy lifting) walking him down the line from the third degree room to the police jail to felony court to the big house to bail all in a day's work. And they were feeling pretty good because they had their man solid.Of course square gees like Manny are from jump street about the penal system so it looks like curtains for Manny until a little luck comes his way. But that luck, actually some wrong gee that anybody could tell was a wrong gee, needing fix or whatever, went back on the prowl and got nabbed. And those clerks, female clerks, who swore on those seventy bibles that Manny was the one saw the error of their identifications. But here is the really interesting, and sad, big sad, part of this film ((hell, even I knew Henry, oops, Manny was going to walk), Manny`s ever-loving wife (and mother of his two boys), Rosa (played by Vera Miles), flipped out over the Manny going to the big house scene. I mean really flipped out. See she in her tried and true 1950s golden dreams perfect housewife and companion though she was to blame for Manny's downfall and nothing could break her from that belief after she worked herself into a lather over her trivialness and such, her bad wife-ness, jesus, well, nothing except a couple of years at a sanatorium to work thing s out.So New York's finest got the wrong guy, not for the first and not for the last time.  And the Rosas of this world paid the price, not for the first or last time either.

Watching them makes me anxious and there is nothing I hate more than that feeling of total frustration.  &#8216;The Wrong Man&#8217; successfully gave me that, and the more I saw of the shoddy and unjust way the police force handled this case, the more I wanted to reach through the screen and start slapping people.I guess I should say &#8220;job well done&#8221; to the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.Released the same year as Hitchcock&#8217;s undervalued masterpiece, &#8220;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#8217;, &#8216;The Wrong Man&#8217; casts a very humble Henry Fonda as Manny Balestrero, a real life man who was falsely accused of assault and robbery.  With a face that no one would dare accuse of anything cruel (but then again, when you see his doppelganger you completely understand), it almost seems ridiculous when the police arrest Manny and accuse him of armed robbery.  Singled out and identified by multiple witnesses to the crimes, and unable to secure an alibi despite having a few, things look bleak for Balestrero despite attaining a confident lawyer and having a large body of support behind him.Hitchcock did his best to stick to the facts of the case and create a film that gave due respect to everything the Balestrero family had to endure, and both Henry Fonda and Vera Miles do a fantastic job of bringing this story to life, especially Miles who has some juicy scenes towards the end and elevates this from a mere &#8216;suffering wife&#8217; role to a full-fledged masterclass in acting.One of the littler known films by Hitchcock, I can&#8217;t recommend enough that you get your hands on this one!",4,Hitchcock doesn&#8217;t disappoint&#8230;,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,1683,"['Real', 'life', 'stories', 'injustice', 'give', 'heartburn', 'Watching', 'anxious', 'nothing', 'hate', 'more', 'feeling', 'total', 'frustration', '8216', 'Wrong', 'Man', '8217', 'successfully', 'gave', 'more', 'saw', 'shoddy', 'unjust', 'way', 'police', 'force', 'handled', 'case', 'more', 'wanted', 'reach', 'screen', 'start', 'slapping', 'people.I', 'guess', 'should', 'say', '8220', 'job', 'well', 'done', '8221', 'master', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock.Released', 'same', 'year', 'Hitchcock', '8217', 'undervalued', 'masterpiece', '8220', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', '8217', '8216', 'Wrong', 'Man', '8217', 'very', 'humble', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Manny', 'Balestrero', 'real', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'falsely', 'accused', 'assault', 'robbery', 'face', 'one', 'would', 'dare', 'accuse', 'anything', 'cruel', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'see', 'doppelganger', 'completely', 'understand', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'police', 'arrest', 'Manny', 'accuse', 'armed', 'robbery', 'Singled', 'out', 'identified', 'multiple', 'witnesses', 'crimes', 'unable', 'secure', 'alibi', 'having', 'few', 'things', 'look', 'bleak', 'Balestrero', 'attaining', 'confident', 'lawyer', 'having', 'large', 'body', 'support', 'him.Hitchcock', 'did', 'best', 'stick', 'facts', 'case', 'create', 'film', 'gave', 'due', 'respect', 'everything', 'Balestrero', 'family', 'had', 'endure', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'especially', 'Miles', 'who', 'juicy', 'scenes', 'end', 'mere', '8216', 'suffering', 'wife', '8217', 'role', 'full-fledged', 'masterclass', 'acting.One', 'littler', 'known', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'can', '8217', 'recommend', 'enough', 'get', 'hands', 'one']",N/A

It is a true story, told in a stark, realistic style. And frankly, that's not what people want when they go to the movies.It is the story of a man (Henry Fonda) who is accused of a crime he did not commit for no reason but that he looks rather like the hold-up man. And he goes into the insurance office which was held up in order to see about borrowing money on his wife's policy. The clerks there imagine he is the one who robbed them several months earlier. They are very sure.The line-up procedures, and several other aspects of the investigation, are not the way it would be done today. But mistaken identity does happen, and I'm sure it still happens today. The story is really about what it does to the people involved in something they cannot control. His wife begins to doubt him, then suffers a mental collapse from guilt when she realizes she has doubted her husband when he needed her most.All in all, it's a depressing little tragedy, and not up to Hitchcock's standard, nor Henry Fonda's.

833753,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0002HOER6,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 5]","Alfred Hitchcock was the consummate Hollywood director, in that his films had high production values, big name stars, were immaculately composed and scored- usually by Bernard Herrmann, as in this film, yet they also tended to lack heart, or real human emotion. They were all basically plot-driven vehicles that usually had twist endings, that stretched the bounds of the reasonable. In a way he was the M. Night Shyamalan of his day, except that he was a far superior filmmaker in every way. Every so often, however, he would try his hand at a different style of film, like Mr. And Mrs. Smith, Jamaica Inn, and Under Capricorn.Perhaps his most successful such `oddball' film was 1956's black and white social realism film The Wrong Man, starring Henry Fonda, which was manifestly influenced by the spate of European films that indulged in the Neo-Realistic style of such masters as Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Roberto Rossellini, and based upon a real life case of mistaken identity in 1953 which nearly put an innocent man in prison. This film's veracity was so important to Hitchcock that he did not dare make one of his comic cameo appearances within the film, rather we only see him opening the film on a dark soundstage, and in shadow, as he intones the setup. Yet, in a sense, the film is more of a classic film noir, based in reality, than a Neo-Realistic film, based in Hollywood, even as it is shorn of the usual Hitchcockian plot twists and MacGuffins. The film was penned by Angus MacPhail and playwright Maxwell Anderson, and was based upon Anderson's non-fiction novel called The True Story Of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero, which preceded Truman Capote's non-fiction novel In Cold Blood by a decade. It is a very good film, yet it never quite soars into greatness, for a number of manifest reasons.For a film that has been called Hitchcock's stab at Neo-Realism, a bit less artifice would have been more suited. The Wrong Man, however, is a very good film, even if it is clearly a flawed and second tier film of Hitchcock's, despite its noble attempts at more. It's not a thriller, but a character study- of Manny, Rose, and even the mores of mid-Twentieth Century New York City, with images that do not rhapsodize the city as in Woody Allen's Manhattan does, but show the city as a sort of indifferent beast. Despite its flaws, The Wrong Man has good performances, technical kudos, and great touches that stick in the viewer's mind long after it ends; such as the rote and unwavering way the female witnesses identify the real robber, then are ashamed to look at Manny as they leave, an early shot of Manny leaving The Stork Club, bracketed between two cops as he walks away, or his recalling the cop car in front of his house when he is let out on bail and sees an empty spot in the street. These are the things that show that a great artist, even when not at his best, is still better than most non-great artists at their best. And that's the sort of claim for which no twist ending is needed.",3,Good,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,3025,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'consummate', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'films', 'had', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'were', 'immaculately', 'composed', 'scored-', 'usually', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'film', 'yet', 'also', 'tended', 'lack', 'heart', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'were', 'basically', 'plot-driven', 'vehicles', 'usually', 'had', 'twist', 'endings', 'stretched', 'bounds', 'reasonable', 'way', 'was', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'day', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'however', 'would', 'try', 'hand', 'different', 'style', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Jamaica', 'Inn', 'Capricorn.Perhaps', 'most', 'successful', 'such', 'oddball', 'film', 'was', '1956', 'black', 'white', 'social', 'realism', 'film', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'starring', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'was', 'manifestly', 'influenced', 'spate', 'European', 'films', 'indulged', 'Neo-Realistic', 'style', 'such', 'masters', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'Roberto', 'Rossellini', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', '1953', 'nearly', 'put', 'innocent', 'man', 'prison', 'film', 'veracity', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'not', 'dare', 'make', 'one', 'comic', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film', 'rather', 'only', 'see', 'opening', 'film', 'dark', 'soundstage', 'shadow', 'setup', 'sense', 'film', 'more', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'based', 'reality', 'Neo-Realistic', 'film', 'based', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'shorn', 'usual', 'Hitchcockian', 'plot', 'twists', 'MacGuffins', 'film', 'was', 'penned', 'Angus', 'MacPhail', 'playwright', 'Maxwell', 'Anderson', 'was', 'based', 'Anderson', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'called', 'True', 'Story', 'Christopher', 'Emmanuel', 'Balestrero', 'preceded', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'decade', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'greatness', 'number', 'manifest', 'reasons.For', 'film', 'been', 'called', 'Hitchcock', 'stab', 'Neo-Realism', 'bit', 'less', 'artifice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'clearly', 'flawed', 'second', 'tier', 'film', 'Hitchcock', 'noble', 'attempts', 'more', 'not', 'thriller', 'character', 'study-', 'Manny', 'Rose', 'even', 'mores', 'mid-Twentieth', 'Century', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'images', 'do', 'not', 'rhapsodize', 'city', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Manhattan', 'show', 'city', 'sort', 'indifferent', 'beast', 'flaws', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'good', 'performances', 'technical', 'kudos', 'great', 'touches', 'stick', 'viewer', 'mind', 'long', 'such', 'rote', 'unwavering', 'way', 'female', 'witnesses', 'identify', 'real', 'robber', 'then', 'are', 'ashamed', 'look', 'Manny', 'leave', 'early', 'shot', 'Manny', 'leaving', 'Stork', 'Club', 'bracketed', 'two', 'cops', 'away', 'recalling', 'cop', 'car', 'front', 'house', 'when', 'let', 'out', 'bail', 'empty', 'spot', 'street', 'are', 'things', 'show', 'great', 'artist', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'best', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'non-great', 'artists', 'best', 'sort', 'claim', 'twist', 'ending', 'needed']",N/A

Manny's arrest, imprisonment, and trial leaves a huge emotional impact on his family and friends, especially his wife Rose (Vera Miles). Tragically, Rose is gradually driven to madness by the entire sequence of events.The film is not Hitchcock's normal style. It is really a ducodrama that uses the director's well-known fear of the police to the fullest extent. The acting is very good, especially Vera Miles. It is a dark and sad film. There is one part in Manny's jail cell where the camera revolves around his head in a clockwise direction that is symbolic of the emotional turmoil he is going through. That is brilliant!  I liked that Hitchcock also put some Christian themes into it as well.The film's music is the third of seven (not including the unused one from Torn Curtain) musical scores written for Hitchcock by Bernard Herrmann. It has a jazz-influenced sound that can become very creepy.

I remember being about 10 and staying up ""late"" one night and watching this film.  It terrified me.  I remembered this film until seven years later when I saw a movie called ""Psycho"" and began to investigate the director--since then I have been hooked.The film follows the innocent and seemingly normal life of a man mistaken for a crime.  As we continue on our journey through the justice system with Manny, we see how his entire life and family are affected by this accident.  His wife, played by Vera Miles, slowly descends into madness (and she does so beautifully).  This film is so well done and perfectly acted that you truly feel for the characters (and then you realized this is based on true events and the terror really begins!).It is still one of my favorites, and it still terrifies me even now.  What could be scarier than being innocent and having so little to prove so; especially when there are witnesses against you!

833756,A315K47GRB024C,B0002HOER6,Daniel C. Markel,"[3, 4]","This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.This movie is in effect a real life documentary of man being arrested and tried for crimes he did not commit.  Henry Fonda stars as Manny Balestrero, a New York nightclub bass player who is arrested for a series of armed robberies.  Balestrero has a wife named Rose (Vera Miles) and two sons, so his surprise arrest puts a huge financial and emotional burden on this family.  The movie is very detailed as it goes through the entire legal process of his interrogation, arrest, arraignment, legal counseling and finally his trial.This is a very serious movie and it's a clear departure from other mid-50's Hitchcock American films.  The movie is shot in full-screen black and white, and has a very noir-type look.  The soundtrack also doesn't sound like it's from a studio orchestra but rather a jazz band with it's very prominent score as opposed to being just background music.  I liked the movie, but didn't love it.  It seemed like Hitchcock went through the motions on this one but it does have a very strong ending.  Overall, the film is emotionally draining and uses very little artistic creativity, but it's obvious that Hitchcock did not intend to entertain his audience but rather send a sobering message regarding how fragile life is.  To it's credit, the film also reveals a message of divine intervention when we turn to God in our time of deepest pain.The DVD transfer very sharp but some tiny deterioration was noticeable periodically throughout the film.  The sound is excellent as the music soundtrack sets an important tone to the movie.

Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: ""Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.""Is he that, really? The French Nouvelle Vague directors - The Wrong Man provoked the longest piece of criticism written by Jean-Luc Godard - which I adore, adored him, so all the more reason that I should also see IT, that unique Hitchcock touch - but I don't. If ever anything was old fashioned, stuffy British, and of constantly doubtful humour, H was it right from the beginning, and his work with undisguised studio settings, especially in outdoor scenes, is still mostly bad taste, as are his sadistic undertones and sexual innuendoes.The wrong man stars Henry Fonda and Vera Miles. The film is based on a true story (another nono argument to me) of an innocent man charged for a crime he did not commit. The story was based on the book The True Story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero by Maxwell Anderson and the article ""A Case of Identity"" (Life magazine, June 29, 1953) by Herbert Brean. It was one of the few Hitchcock films based on a true story, and unusually for Hitchcock, the facts of the story were not changed much, and it was essentially a court drama.

Hitchcock introduces the film and explains that it is based on real people and a real situation. I believe THE WRONG MAN is Hitchock's only fact-based film and it shows.THE WRONG MAN lacks the suspense and thrills of a typical Hitchcock film. It is a very straight foward story of honest, hard-working family man Manny Ballestero who is arrested for two robberies. A very sedate Henry Fonda stars as Ballestero. His speaks few words and his pain and fear are seen in his eyes. Witnesses place him at the scene of the crimes as his protests his innocence. There is not much suspense here. Is he ""the wrong man"" or have financial difficulties led him to commit the robberies?Fonda always does a fine job but I am not sure his heart was into the part. I was surprised at how old Fonda looks with a wrinkled and worn face. His plays a character who is 38 and Fonda in reality is in his mid-40's during the filming. His looks even older. The beautiful Vera Miles stars as his suffering wife who begins to have a mental breakdown over the stress of her husband's situation. I always think of Miles as an attractive middle-aged actress and here she is as a beautiful young lady in her mid-20's. She does a fine job and we see her a few years later in Hitchcock's PSYCHO.Apparently, Hitchcock made an effort to recreate the story with authenticity yet the the film lacks his trademark suspense.

833763,AT04V4H3AO3T5,B0002HOER6,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[19, 20]","Apparently the innocent man has plenty to fear, and that is the subject of this curious film by Alfred Hitchcock. Although the theme of false accusation is one that Hitchcock would use repeatedly throughout his career, THE WRONG MAN is a different kind of a Hitchcock film in many ways.This film claims to be--and in fact is--a true story (it was based upon a 1952 LIFE magazine article ""The True Story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero"") and Hitchcock went to great lengths in minimizing the fictionalization of any part of this narrative. The result is quite a serious film. Henry Fonda plays Manny Balestrero, a devoted family man who plays bass at night for local nightclub band. Based on faulty eyewitness identification, he is accused of committing a string of armed hold-ups that have been plaguing his neighborhood.Now, in the usual Hitchcock film, the hero of the story would go on the lam, meet up with a beautiful blonde, and set about solving the mystery and clearing his own name. That does not happen here. We follow Balestrero through the tedious but very real process of being accused, processed, and jailed while his wife Rose (Vera Miles) slowly suffers a complete mental breakdown. So serious is this film, in fact, that Hitchcock forgoes his usual cameo role and instead appears during a prologue to the film explaining the film's basis in fact.THE WRONG MAN has a documentary feel to it reflecting the considerable efforts by Hitchcock to be true to the real story. In many cases, in fact, the picture was filmed in the actual locations where the true to life events took place, including The Stork Club in Manhattan, the police precinct house in Queens, and the actual insurance office where one of the original armed robberies took place. Hitchcock even filmed in the psychiatric ward where Rose Balestrero was committed with the real doctors playing themselves!THE WRONG MAN is not an exciting film and it lacks the usual humor of a Hitchcock outing, but it was never intended to be exciting or funny. This film is pure drama and realism, and one gets the feeling that this film was made because Hitchcock felt that it was immensely important to make.

Williams,"[1, 1]","This Hitchcock docudrama features Henry Fonda as Emmanuel Christopher ""Manny"" Balestrero, an average victim of circumstance at the mercy of the justice system. It is interesting to see Fonda in THE WRONG MAN role reversal of12 ANGRY MEN. As a juror in the latter, he pleads for reasonable doubt. In the former, he hopes for legal triumph as the defendant.I have purchased 13 and viewed 17 (some numerous times) Hitchcock films. Most intertwine witty dialog with a spellbinding conclusion. THE WRONG MAN diverges from the norm by adhering closely to factual events. Hence, the dialog doesn't reveal the director. ""Terror"" in this film involves the fear of being behind bars -- Hitchcock's own phobia after spending five minutes there as a child. There is suspense but no real terror. However, there is a rather shocking emotional twist with an effectively portrayed sad conclusion.Cinematography and sets are realistic and sometimes creative. There are some nice transitional fades into new scenes that give the audience a feeling for emotion or time-lapse events. Fonda's entrance through his front door, shutting it in the face of the audience while still visible to them is more complex than it looks and is well explained in the DVD extras. For Hitchcock collectors, this is one well worth having -- even worthy of at least two viewings. The commentary bonus adds to the value.Movie quote: ""An innocent man has nothing to fear.

His pithy and grounded performance really gave this film a realistic and poignant feel.

833771,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002HOER6,mirasreviews,"[6, 6]","""The Wrong Man"" was written by playwright Maxwell Anderson and directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on the true story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero, a man wrongly accused of a series of armed robberies in New York City in 1953, only a couple of years before the film was made. ""Manny"" Balestrero (Henry Fonda) was a family man and a musician at New York's Stork Club. One day he visits the office of his life insurance company to find out how much his wife Rose (Vera Miles) can borrow against her insurance policy to finance some badly needed dental surgery. The insurance company has been held up a couple of times by a man claiming to have a gun, and the teller is convinced that Manny looks like the culprit. Charged with armed robbery and misidentified by witnesses, Manny hopes to find people to corroborate his alibis. When that fails, the situation takes a toll on Rose's mental state.""The Wrong Man""'s primary objective is to give the impression of a loss of control. The most disturbing aspect of Manny's predicament is that he is at the mercy of an impersonal system that doesn't know or care about him and from which he cannot escape. Manny is an easy-going guy who is bewildered by the unjust turn of events but always optimistic. His wife Rose is less nave and more proactive at first, but more emotionally fragile, ultimately tormented by feelings of guilt and persecution. Manny's helplessness and distress are expressed graphically in his scenes of confinement in the jail. Alfred Hitchcock excels at communicating the horror of being caged, though I could have done without the camera moving in circles. That conveyed a feeling of nausea more than confinement. ""The Wrong Man"" has some nice scenes of New York City circa 1956, including some filmed inside the Stork Club. The style of cinematography vacillates between documentary-like realism and more stylized Hitchcockian camera work.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2004): ""Guilt Trip: Hitchcock and The Wrong Man"" (20 minutes) is part commentary and part making-of documentary featuring interviews with Peter Bogdanovich, film historians Robert Osborne and Richard Schickel, the film's art director Paul Sylbert, and Christopher Husted, the manager of composer Bernard Herrmann's estate. They talk about the film's themes and the cast. Sylbert recalls filming and technical details. And Husted talks about the film's score. There is also a theatrical trailer (2  min).

It is her performance in my mind that actually steals the show. As the real villain finally shows himself the wife is so withdrawn she remains in the institution for two more years. She makes you feel her utter self imposed guilt which is false and therefore you also feel the despair her husband feels at that point that he has lost her maybe forever.For the life of me why Vera Miles didnt win an academy award for this performance is beyond my comprehension.This is not like any other hitchcock movie I know of , no cameo , he just walks out and talks before the movie in this one.

Henry Fonda is Manny Balestrero, a struggling musician who is wrongfully accused of being a robber when he attempts to cash in his wife, Rose's (Vera Miles) insurance policy. The trail of accusations leads to a meticulous examination of police procedure in which the pressure of labeling the victim and hunting down the accused eventually culminate in desperation and a complete - if coerced - confession.  Hitchcock's own ingrained fear of authority and the law is the real star of this rather mundane and not terribly prepossessing melodrama.Warner's DVD transfer is fairly accurate. A very nicely balanced gray scale with deep, solid blacks and reasonably clean whites is impressively mastered. Dirt, scratches and other age related artifacts are present but do not terribly distract.

His father had the local police chief lock him in a cell for 5 minutes as a warning. This experience certainly resonates in this film.""The Wrong Man"" along with ""I Confess"" contains Hitchcock's most blatant use of religious, particulary Catholic symbols.Hitchcock's visual inventiveness is in full gear throughout the film. There are many close ups and high angle shots to give us the feeling of being trapped as well as several other bravura efforts - the ""dissolve"" on the entrance of the real perpetrator, the shot where we move throught the eyehole of the cell, and the whirling camera when Fonda is in his cell.""The Master"" makes his cameo in a short prologue to the film - he didn't want it to distract viewers during the film given the ""serious"" subject matter.There is a tacked on coda, obviously imposed by the studio, which attempts to provide a ""happy ending"" after the depressing nature of the rest of the film.On its own level this film is not entirely successful but it is certainly fascinating for Hitchcock buffs.",4,"Fascinating but not entirely successful ""realist"" film from ""The Master""",1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,1527,"['Wrong', 'Man', 'set', 'then', 'contemporary', '1950s', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'family', 'man', 'played', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'identified', 'perpetrator', 'series', 'robberies', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'strange', 'mixture', 'gritty', 'realism', 'Hitchcockian', 'sensibilities', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'gel', 'particulary', 'second', 'half', 'film.Hitchcock', 'had', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'experience', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'left', 'life', 'long', 'phobia', 'police', 'authority', 'figures', 'general', 'father', 'had', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'lock', 'cell', '5', 'minutes', 'warning', 'experience', 'certainly', 'film', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'Confess', 'Hitchcock', 'most', 'blatant', 'use', 'religious', 'particulary', 'Catholic', 'symbols.Hitchcock', 'visual', 'inventiveness', 'full', 'gear', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'close', 'ups', 'high', 'angle', 'shots', 'give', 'feeling', 'being', 'trapped', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'other', 'bravura', 'efforts', 'dissolve', 'entrance', 'real', 'perpetrator', 'shot', 'where', 'move', 'throught', 'eyehole', 'cell', 'whirling', 'camera', 'when', 'Fonda', 'cell', 'Master', 'cameo', 'short', 'prologue', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'distract', 'viewers', 'film', 'given', 'serious', 'subject', 'tacked', 'coda', 'obviously', 'imposed', 'studio', 'provide', 'happy', 'ending', 'depressing', 'nature', 'rest', 'film.On', 'own', 'level', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'Hitchcock', 'buffs']",N/A

Theres no Hollywood action and very little of his trademark suspense in this movie. Its almost a procedural Police movie with a bit of court room drama thrown in for good measure. Above all this though is how the relationship between a man and wife is stretched beyond the limit by a simple misidentification.Henry Fonda looks suitably haunted and Vera Miles as his wife Rose perhaps even more so. What Hitchcock portrays so well in this movie is the reality of an innocent person being prosecuted for a crime he did not commit.This is also part of an excellent boxed set which I strongly recommend.

his suffering as a result of a crime committed by someone else.What makes it worse is that when he protests his innocence,people just say ,""yes,of course!"".All the circumstantial evidence is working against him.Everything was minutely constructed with people that were involved in the drama.Using some of them e.g. witnesses,unknown actors as well as real locations,where events really took place.A real prison is used,Fonda placed in a real cell,following the prison routines.Also the same psychiatric rest home where the wife was sent, using the actual doctors.The real guilty party is captured while he's trying to hold up a delicatessen,through the courage of the lady owner,holding a knife,banging the floor with her foot,standing with sang-froid,holding the knife against his stomach.The woman's husband grabs the thief by the shoulders,reprimanding him until the police come.This is dramatised by superimposing the criminal's image over Fonda while he is praying.When Fonda is taken away in a car by policeman,everything in the outside world is taking place normally,yet he himself is a prisoner inside the car.His se nse of shame is conveyed by him looking down and shots of feet, floor and handcuffed wrists are shown.The weaknesses of the film are the long interruption in the man's story in order to show how the wife(Vera Miles) was gradually losing her mind.By the time we got to the trial,it had become anti-climactic.The trial ended abruptly as it had in real life.Dramatic license is lost in the pursuit of veracity.Dramatisation-to do with stylisation-detracts from their reality.Henry Fonda is as authentic as any man in the street.The walls however are shown spinning in his cell,rather than him simply sitting on a stool in his cell,which would have been more authentic.However the best scenes are those in the lawyer's office:in the 1st scene Fonda appeared to be very disheartened,while Vera Miles is so lively and talkative she so annoyed the lawyer.In the 2nd scene Fonda is more confident and eloquent and the lawyer seems to be more optimistic too,but Vera Miles is now completely apathetic, hardly listening to what they are saying.The lawyer is surprised and disturbed,he believes his client's wife is losing her mind,his face shows what he's thinking.This however is purer Hitchcock,a pure cinematic scene,departing from the faithful

This time, however, Hitchcock follows a different formula by tackling a true story about a wrongly accused man.For a basic plot summary, ""The Wrong Man"" tells the story of Emanuel Balestrero (Henry Fonda), who is falsely accused of committing numerous crimes around the neighborhood in which he lives.  The film shows the process that ""Manny"" must go through in order to clear his name, as well as the physical and psychological toll it takes on his children and wife (Vera Miles).At its core, this is actually a very simple film.  There are no jaw-dropping revelations or contrived dramatic situations.  I have read that Hitch tried to be as close to the actual truth of the situation as possible with this film, and the product surely represents that philosophy.That being said, Hitchcock still manages to turn the experience into an entertaining one through his use of tension and unique camera techniques.  As Manny's unbelievable story unwinds before the viewers, we can't helped be sucked in by asking ourselves ""what would I do in his situation?"".Thus, though not a traditional Hitchcock thriller/mystery by any means, ""The Wrong Man"" is a solid effort based on factual events, even further proving Hitchcock's extraordinary range of directing talents (the ability to turn a true story into gripping film).",4,Hitchcock Tells The Truth (But Still Entertains),1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1467,"['Traditionally', 'tales', 'spun', 'master', 'director', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'concocted', 'recesses', 'own', 'mind', 'being', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'time', 'however', 'Hitchcock', 'different', 'formula', 'tackling', 'true', 'story', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'man.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'story', 'Emanuel', 'Balestrero', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'who', 'falsely', 'accused', 'committing', 'numerous', 'crimes', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'process', 'Manny', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'clear', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'psychological', 'toll', 'children', 'wife', 'Vera', 'Miles', '.At', 'core', 'actually', 'very', 'simple', 'film', 'are', 'jaw-dropping', 'revelations', 'contrived', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'have', 'read', 'Hitch', 'tried', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'actual', 'truth', 'situation', 'possible', 'film', 'product', 'surely', 'philosophy.That', 'being', 'said', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'turn', 'experience', 'entertaining', 'one', 'use', 'tension', 'unique', 'camera', 'techniques', 'Manny', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'unwinds', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'helped', 'be', 'sucked', 'asking', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', '.Thus', 'not', 'traditional', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller/mystery', 'means', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'solid', 'effort', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'even', 'further', 'proving', 'Hitchcock', 'extraordinary', 'range', 'directing', 'talents', 'ability', 'turn', 'true', 'story', 'gripping', 'film']",N/A
