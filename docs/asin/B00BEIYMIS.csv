What the Conjuring does remarkably well is allow time to develop not only a story, but atmosphere and horror.  These are crucial details when it comes to horror films.  You can't just throw a bunch of children and teenage daughters together (5 of them to be exact) with a mom/dad and assume we'll all instantly attach/care about them.  You have to allow these characters to develop an identity which is what makes the Conjuring one of the better horror movies out there.  Certainly one of the best released in recent years.  Every one of the family members is given time to shine.Actually what this movie does that the Amityville Horror does not (at least the original) is include moments of mystery in the storytelling.  It's not always 100% horror and scares.  Eventually the tone shifts in another direction which, in my opinion, is comparable to a mystery film.  With that said, the movie is most certainly a horror movie. The tone just sometimes goes in another direction perhaps unintentionally so to give viewers time to catch their breath.Anyway the scares begin on a subtle and somewhat harmless note- the family experiences the occasional creeps of closet doors opening and crawling sounds/noises throughout the house, but soon other more serious things begin to happen.  Pictures slam off the walls, birds crash through the windows, visions of a hanging take place outside by a tree branch, bed sheets fly off the clothesline and form a human figure before oddly landing flat against the upstairs window playing with our imaginations since we're not entirely sure a thunderstorm is causing this to happen (one of my personal favorite moments), a young daughter wakes up crying because she believes someone is standing by her bedroom doorway which causes her sister to wake up and question her (second favorite moment) and well, the list goes on and on.No, the Conjuring isn't as scary as the Amityville Horror.  It comes close on a few occasions, however.  It's absolutely delightful to watch and hear this movie on a DVD player with powerful speakers too.  Yes the film relies heavily on jump scares, but it also includes a remarkable amount of suspense and atmosphere.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie 5 stars is for a couple reasons.  One, the Exorcist portion of the film, though awesome and atmospheric, is somewhat generically written.  And well, the storyline overall is somewhat predictable of a haunted house with typical tendencies and the occasional cliches coming in now and then.  Otherwise, worth watching.I do think there's one storyline flaw.  The mom/dad tell a visiting paranormal group that the entire family has to live downstairs in the living room because it's their only safe spot, however eventually the daughters go back to their bedrooms which is when the situation gets much worse.  I have a feeling the parents regret allowing their kids to return to their own rooms.  I think the basement and for that matter the entire house (due to the peeled brown wallpaper which was popular in the 70's I know) look believably creepy as well.  Great movie.",4,just don't go in the basement... especially at 3:07,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3226,"['Conjuring', '*still*', 'freaking', 'film', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'bound', 'win', 'over', 'HUGE', 'way', 'What', 'Conjuring', 'remarkably', 'well', 'allow', 'time', 'develop', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'horror', 'are', 'crucial', 'details', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'bunch', 'children', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'together', '5', 'be', 'exact', 'mom/dad', 'assume', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'attach/care', 'have', 'allow', 'characters', 'develop', 'identity', 'what', 'Conjuring', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'Certainly', 'one', 'best', 'released', 'recent', 'years', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'given', 'time', 'shine.Actually', 'what', 'movie', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'not', 'least', 'original', 'include', 'moments', 'mystery', 'storytelling', 'not', 'always', '100', '%', 'horror', 'scares', 'Eventually', 'tone', 'shifts', 'direction', 'opinion', 'comparable', 'mystery', 'film', 'said', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'horror', 'movie', 'tone', 'just', 'sometimes', 'direction', 'perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'so', 'give', 'viewers', 'time', 'catch', 'breath.Anyway', 'scares', 'begin', 'subtle', 'somewhat', 'harmless', 'note-', 'family', 'occasional', 'creeps', 'closet', 'doors', 'opening', 'crawling', 'sounds/noises', 'house', 'soon', 'other', 'more', 'serious', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'Pictures', 'slam', 'off', 'walls', 'birds', 'crash', 'windows', 'visions', 'hanging', 'take', 'place', 'tree', 'branch', 'bed', 'sheets', 'fly', 'clothesline', 'form', 'human', 'figure', 'oddly', 'landing', 'flat', 'upstairs', 'window', 'playing', 'imaginations', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'thunderstorm', 'causing', 'happen', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'moments', 'young', 'daughter', 'up', 'crying', 'someone', 'standing', 'bedroom', 'doorway', 'sister', 'wake', 'up', 'question', 'second', 'favorite', 'moment', 'well', 'list', 'on.No', 'Conjuring', ""n't"", 'as', 'scary', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'close', 'few', 'occasions', 'however', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'watch', 'hear', 'movie', 'DVD', 'player', 'powerful', 'speakers', 'too', 'Yes', 'film', 'heavily', 'jump', 'scares', 'also', 'remarkable', 'amount', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'couple', 'reasons', 'One', 'Exorcist', 'portion', 'film', 'awesome', 'atmospheric', 'somewhat', 'generically', 'written', 'well', 'storyline', 'overall', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'haunted', 'house', 'typical', 'tendencies', 'occasional', 'cliches', 'coming', 'now', 'then', 'Otherwise', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'storyline', 'flaw', 'mom/dad', 'tell', 'visiting', 'paranormal', 'group', 'entire', 'family', 'live', 'downstairs', 'living', 'room', 'only', 'safe', 'spot', 'however', 'eventually', 'daughters', 'go', 'back', 'bedrooms', 'when', 'situation', 'much', 'worse', 'have', 'feeling', 'parents', 'regret', 'allowing', 'kids', 'return', 'own', 'rooms', 'think', 'basement', 'matter', 'entire', 'house', 'due', 'peeled', 'brown', 'wallpaper', 'was', 'popular', '70', 'know', 'look', 'believably', 'creepy', 'as', 'well', 'Great', 'movie']",N/A

Well, they pack up their stuff, move out, and drop off the keys at the bank of course.  And stop paying their mortgages.  Well, that's at least what people did during the housing downturn in the mid-late 2000s.  If it was OK to do it then, why wasn't it OK in the early 1970s?I've seen the Warrens on quite a few television shows over the years, and I always found them interesting.  I believe that they were on &#34;The Haunted,&#34; which wasn't too bad of a show.  Sure, I didn't always believe the stories -- or the people on the show itself -- but who cares?  It was always interesting to watch other people go through hell while I could just sit back, eat popcorn, and watch.Which leads me to an interesting review that I partially read the other day about this film.  In that review, someone said that he didn't like this film because it &#34;wasn't real.&#34;  He used different words than that but I can't repeat them on a family site.  Now, if I were to use his logic, I could make the same claims about movies such as &#34;Superman.&#34;  &#34;Superman doesn't exist and therefore you shouldn't watch the film because it's garbage.  And you'd be stupid as well,&#34; might be my argument.  Well, why do you exactly have to believe in anything to like it, anyways?  Naturally, you don't.  Which is why that review was ridiculous.What isn't exactly ridiculous:  &#34;The Conjuring&#34; itself.  I got a few good frights out of it, and I had a few jump-out-of-my-seat moments, which is really all you should expect from a horror film, isn't it?  Why is &#34;real&#34; any good anyways?  The last housing downturn was certainly &#34;real,&#34; but I surely wouldn't call it very much fun or entertaining.

I remember that within the first half hour I knew I was going to add this to my Blu ray collection once it came out in the format. The theater was packed and I don't think a horror film works as effectively when you're seeing it with hundreds of people ( at least for me ). The crowd was well behaved, don't get me wrong. Except for a group of teenage girls who walked out of the theater while giggling to themselves. Perhaps the movie was too much for them? Ha!Viewing this film in the dark, home alone at 2 a.m. is a better experience in my opinion. It's not a huge film. It's a small scale story that is done with the kind of technical expertise and ingenuity that comes from filmmakers who were raised on this genre. The cinematography and editing can't be faulted.As for the narrative, I haven't seen this many horror movie tropes and cliches in one film, maybe ever. That doesn't make the film bad. It just goes to show you that these old tricks of the trade still work after being utilized for decades. The set up of the film is the same basic thing we've all seen countless times before, even from this very director, ( he seems to never tire of paranormal investigators ). A family moves into a country house with a long history. Things go bump in the night, then accelerate in intensity until the family seeks the help of these investigators.It's incredible that the filmmakers can get away with a story that has been done to death hundreds of times. But remember, most people under the age of 18 aren't familiar with the 1970s horror cinema this movie rips off from, ( is inspired by, to be more forgiving). And those movies are too old and crusty for kids to go back to. This is exactly that kind of 70s horror film but with a modern sheen and polish. That speaks to the power of the horror genre that a film with no originality, that could have been conceived 40 years ago, is a big hit with a modern audience.Audiences over the age of 25 might be bored with The Conjuring. But older people just need to put this film in the right context and enjoy all the chills and thrills this genre has to offer. The biggest disappointment for me was... ( SPOILER WARNING ), that the movie morphs from a ghost story to an exorcist thriller in the third act. That annoyed me greatly, because I love ghost stories, I can even tolerate stories about demons, but possession and exorcism bores me to no end. We're going back to The Exorcist again. Yawn. But within the aesthetic that The Conjuring is operating in, ( 1970s era horror thriller ), an exorcist angle is just the next natural progression. People who like exorcist stories will enjoy this third act much more than I did. I love ghost stories and prefer that angle.Technical notes about the Blu ray. The film looks terrific. It was shot on the Arri Alexa, a digital cinema camera, but one can be fooled that it was shot on 35mm film. The transfer is fantastic, the sound is of high quality. I also like the lenticular slipcover that this came with. I bought my copy at that major electronics store with the yellow/blue logo. I don't know if the Amazon Blu ray comes with a lenticular slipcover or not. Someone make a comment about that.If you liked this movie, I would like to recommend &#34;The Haunted&#34;. It's a made for TV movie from 1991 and it has a very similar tone to The Conjuring. The Haunted was made on a far smaller budget but I think the atmosphere in that movie is rather more effective than the easy, cheap scares that The Conjuring loves. You can find The Haunted on that popular video sharing website that starts with you and ends with tube.

Not The Conjuring.Despite quite a few of the startling moments being released in trailers, the viewers aren't robbed at all, as the quality of the script, eerie score, and premise for the content set them up so well that even knowing they are coming doesn't make them less scary! Also, the trailer clips don't contain the downright creepiest moments in the film, which are the ones containing the haunted doll: Annabelle. As a veteran horrow guy, I am rarely entertained by most of what is issued as &#34;horror&#34;, but this film is in a class not seen since the 60's/70's. Even Exorcist III wasn't nearly as good as this film. That is not an exaggeration.One detraction I observed was that the film, at times, had a &#34;documentary&#34; feel to it, which is fine, but it wasn't consistent. I will need to watch it again to see if it only took place when the Warrens were part of the action. As you know, some films take that approach, especially to convey a sense of reality and validity to aspects of a film, but the deliniation wasn't clear in this film.Despite the claims of some that film was scarier than most because of the attributed claim that it is based on true events, well, I think that's not true. While I do believe that aspects of the film may have been true, I think it was a frightening group of scenes, regardless!

We've seen this everywhere from 13 Ghosts to The Amityville Horror.  The thing that makes this film so interesting is that is is based on truth: this is the worst case investigated by real-life &#34;demonologists&#34; Ed and Lorraine Warren.  The fact that this is based on truth automatically puts it a head above most other films of this type.  Also the direction by James Wan starts slowly and builds up the tension gradually until the last 30 or 40 minutes when  the film shifts into high gear and all hell breaks loose.  I really liked Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmuga as the real-life Warrens.  (Farmuga is also outstanding as the legendary Mrs. Bates on the cable series &#34;Bates Motel.&#34;)The blu-ray features 3 short special features including interviews with the real Perron family, the family terrorized in this film.

It didn't feature anything you haven't seen in a dozen other films in this genre (supernatural horror). The scares ranged between a mix of telegraphed ""boo!"" moments you saw coming ten miles away (hence ""telegraphed"") and the unfair (and cheap) tactic of having something suddenly appear out of the corner of the frame accompanied by a loud spike in the music. Come on--does that even count? My neighbor pulls the same crap every Halloween when he hides in the bushes and leaps out at trick-or-treaters. Of COURSE you're going to jump when something appears out of nowhere, we're human beings and it's in our physiology. Scaring people this way in a horror film is low brow.The performances were fine, no complaints there. The dialogue could have used some polishing, though. ""Something awful happened here, Ed."" Sometimes the trite and corny lines feel like they came out of a Lifetime movie on the subject.The supernatural presence isn't terribly menacing once you realize this is a by-the-numbers horror flick and no one you care about is in any danger of dying. What you're left with is ""shocking"" footage of the entity dragging people around the house like rag dolls with no subtlety whatsoever. If you like your horror in-your-face and over-the-top, you'll love it.Make no mistake, this is a modern ghost story and it suffers every pitfall all modern horror films suffer from.

This horrible clich&eacute; has been overabundant in many so-called &#34;horror&#34; movies for a good while now and I my expectations were low.Thankfully, there are no stingers. Yes, there are scares and jumps, but the score is completely unobtrusive and there are no cats jumping out of closets or phones suddenly ringing. James Wan knows that atmosphere, cinematography, suggestion, and the unknown can build suspense and horror, and the Conjuring has plenty.Apparently based on a true story (which I am extremely doubtful of, but not completely disbelieving) a happy family of mom and dad and five young girls move into a large farmhouse bought at a low price from a bank auction. As soon as they cross the threshold things are not quite right and the property reeks of pure, menacing evil. Eventually they call in the help of a local ghost-hunting couple to document the case and research its history.It was the early 70s, the real Ghostbusters (pun intended) were still in college.About 80% of The Conjuring works. The dread, the suspense, and the inability to comprehend what is really lurking in the darkness of the house makes for great horror. The girls see...something, but we don't. It's a lot like Robert Wise's The Haunting, which is kind of ironic since Lily Taylor, who plays the mother, was in the 1999 remake of that movie, which was full of all the worst horror clich&eacute;s and set-ups, as well as excessive CGI. It's like Taylor wanted to set the balance straight by doing a movie that took the opposite, and more intelligent, approach.John R. Leonetti's photography is very slick, with lots of slow, creeping shots, but I couldn't help but think that a rawer edge, with exploitation lighting, would have helped it look a bit more authentic. There are a bit too many slamming doors scares too, and towards the end it goes off on a completely pointless tangent with the Annabelle doll and does absolutely nothing with it. For the bulk of the running time The Conjuring seems original and groundbreaking, though in the last act it's a jumble of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and What Lies Beneath.The positives still far outweigh the negatives, and I still recommend the film to horror fans. If only we had a version of The Amityville Horror that was made this way instead of that horrendous 2005 movie. No doubt there will be numerous sequels.The Blu-ray looks great in 2.40:1 1080p with brilliant DTS HD-MA sound.

1630307,ACVCDIUEX1YSQ,B00BEIYMIS,James Nemeth,"[1, 2]","Have to say that ultimately I was disappointed with this film. I had built up quite an anticipation to viewing this film once available on DVD due to the hype, buzz, and promotion when released to theaters. But having just viewed it last night, I came away scratching my head, wondering what all the fuss was about.The Conjuring is just another film in the Amityville Horror vein, with nothing new brought to the table and nothing to make it really stand out of said genre. True, genuine scares are few and far between, and the film suffers from a very slow beginning.However, after about the first 1/2 hour, things do pick up. A bigger budget than usual for films of this ilk does allow for some impressive special effects. Lili Palmer, Vera Farmiga, and Patrick Wilson do a good job in their respective roles.Overall, The Conjuring was a mixed experience - I don't regret the two hours spent with this film, but I guess I let myself get caught up in the hype surrounding this movie. It's certainly not one of the scariest movies of all time nor an original story (again, its title could have been The Amityville Horror - 2013), but its fine cast and occasional creepy moments make it worth a viewing.",3,"Has some good moments, but don't feel it lived up to its hype.",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1202,"['Have', 'say', 'ultimately', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'quite', 'anticipation', 'viewing', 'film', 'once', 'available', 'DVD', 'due', 'hype', 'buzz', 'promotion', 'when', 'released', 'theaters', 'having', 'just', 'viewed', 'last', 'night', 'came', 'away', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.The', 'Conjuring', 'just', 'film', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'vein', 'nothing', 'new', 'brought', 'table', 'nothing', 'make', 'really', 'stand', 'said', 'genre', 'True', 'genuine', 'scares', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'film', 'suffers', 'very', 'slow', 'beginning.However', 'first', '1/2', 'hour', 'things', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'A', 'bigger', 'budget', 'usual', 'films', 'ilk', 'allow', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'Lili', 'Palmer', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'respective', 'roles.Overall', 'Conjuring', 'was', 'mixed', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'film', 'guess', 'let', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'scariest', 'movies', 'time', 'original', 'story', 'again', 'title', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '2013', 'fine', 'cast', 'occasional', 'creepy', 'moments', 'make', 'viewing']",N/A

1630309,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00BEIYMIS,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","Set in 1971, the story is said to have been inspired by the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a husband-and-wife team of paranormal investigators. &#34;The Conjuring&#34; introduces us quickly to the Warrens, (played by Patrick Wilson as Ed and Vera Farmiga as Lorraine). The couple believe in the occult, but understand that most events are easily explained hoaxes. They lecture at colleges, show film of inexplicable supernatural events and try to determine, with all the false alarms, if there is a credible case to investigate. Lorraine is clairvoyant, which means she sees what most people cannot, i.e., the apparitions which go &#34;bump in the night.&#34;  Ed may be a believer, but he&#8217;s also the pragmatist - applying pre-digital technology, (meters to locate and quantify electromagnetic hot & cold spots, motion sensors, monitor-like geiger counters), etc.. in his search for &#8220;proof&#8221; of what they&#8217;re dealing with. Since the film and the actual event take place in 1971, you will find no state-of-the-art ghost detection technology here.The story centers around the Perron family, (with Lili Taylor as Carolyn and Ron Livingston as  Roger Perron). The couple, along with their five boisterous  daughters, have the misfortune of moving into their dream house, a rickety 150-year-old Rhode Island farm house, which, they quickly discover, is infested by malevolent, vengeful spirits intent on tormenting and/or killing them. The family dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house, which should have clued the Perrones in that something weird was going on. They ultimately call upon the aid of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who agree to lend their expertise once the haunting appears to be legitimate. Soon they are moving in with the couple and their daughters.The Warren's discover, through research, that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba, who tried to sacrifice her children to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land.Well, what a challenge this turns out to be! I was truly scared during several scenes...and I am not easily frightened. This is definitely NOT a blood and gore film. However, &#8220;The Conjuring,&#8221; does have some very terrifying moments. &#8220;With its minimal use of digital effects, director James Wan uses his expertise with the camera work. It is active, erratic and enhances the dread. Often, he&#8217;ll switch perspective in the middle of the scenes, where it will cast doubt as to whose eyes we&#8217;re looking through, and in other moments it will shift from one person to the next, so the viewer doesn't know if the &#34;point of view&#34; is human or otherwise!There are moments when the story does lose credibility. Its climax, for instance, involves an amateur Catholic exorcism that makes &#8220;The Exorcist,&#8221;  seem like a chronicled event. But the scares that the film delivers, are deeply, deeply creepy, and consistently satisfying. You want &#34;Horror,&#34; well, this is &#34;Horror!&#34; &#34;The Conjuring&#34; is much more than a run--of-the-mill scary-tale.The most important measure of a horror movie is to disgust, disturb, shock and/or terrify. &#34;The Conjuring&#34; does all this, and it is a well acted, well made, fascinating tale to boot.

1630335,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BEIYMIS,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 5]","Poltergeist (1982) meets The Exorcist (1973) in this modern horror classic that only fails to meet perfection because its predecessors already claimed the title by pioneering the scenes and atmosphere that form modern horror filmmaking dogma as we know it today.  But James Wan kicks up the competition and demonstrates his mastery of storytelling and character development in a genre that normally relies entirely on atmosphere and gore-slathered effects to fill seats.Let's just start by saying that this wasn't just a great horror movie.  This was a solid film and a horror movie based on a true account of Ed and Lorraine Warren's case with the Perron family in the 1970s.  There were loads of scares and--while, yes, they were often ""jump scares""--the creepy tension-building on the approach was finely crafted.  You would know that ""something"" was about to happen and it was going to be scary, but it would still manage to catch you off guard, and you wouldn't feel that the scare was ""cheap.""  Already this film has rightly stepped away from the last several dozen theatrical horror releases by engaging viewers with more than just funny satirical demons and loud noises masquerading as scary things.Director James Wan's (Insidious, Saw) film is consistent and smart, feeding viewers a steady and even diet of story and character development for both our haunted family and the paranormal investigators.  Instead of taking the first twenty minutes to introduce us to the characters and hope that we invest ourselves enough to care when their lives are threatened, Wan piece by piece reveals the nature of the Perron family, their house and the paranormalists who come to their aid.Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor) have just moved their five daughters into a secluded house in Rhode Island and, as we've come to expect in horror movies, all horror movie houses come with a dark past.  Upon realizing that their troubles eclipsed the simplicity of a sleepwalking daughter and the stress of adapting to a new home, the Perrons seek help from Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), two married paranormal researchers with an impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;  when it comes to purging evil.The big success in storytelling and direction here is that because Wan presented the Warrens to us in the opening scenes--to set the tone and show us how these paranormal investigators work--and fairly alternated between their college lecture circuit and the escalating situation in the Perron house before the two couples had met.  We weren't force fed some ghost hunters halfway through the movie (or later) who we are ""supposed to like.""  Instead, we've already met them and learned that they're not some spirit hunting hacks who ""hope"" to find ghosts and get evidence so they can be taken seriously.  They hope there ""aren't"" ghosts, they're not in it for the money or fame, and they just want to help people (with an understandably fearful reluctance) utilizing their strange gifts.Score one for character development and great direction in a horror film, James Wan!Following in the obvious footsteps of Poltergeist (1982) and The Exorcist (1973), we are met with some very familiar scenes.  However, I felt this was a respectful nod executed with a succinct sense of urgency rather than simply riding coattails and milking past horror axioms for all they're worth.  The Conjuring skips most of the ""are they just nuts"" skepticism that would normally dominate the first half of a movie like this and gets right to dealing with the problem in a surprisingly practical manner.  As a result, most horror moviegoers' maddening frustrations are avoided in this film; no one does anything dumb or too perfectly right, the characters develop to protect their own and don't turn into sudden superhero evil-slaying experts over night, they don't walk into any traps when they should've known better, there are no ridiculous ""Antichrist baby-Hell on Earth-chosen one-omen-gypsy curse-ancient relic-house built over sacred burial ground and angering the spirits"" reasons justifying the spirit or what it wants or why it chose them, and they even address why the Perron family doesn't leave the house and if it would make a difference at all if they did.  All of this is done with simple explanation and for good reasons.Score for the writers!  By the way, the same writers (the Hayes brothers) will be doing the already announced sequel The Conjuring 2!!!  However I have not found anything indicating Wan's involvement.As we slowly relax our muscles between creepy tension, scares, ""wait is there more?"" and then the next creepy tension, we wade through some shocking imagery, disturbing shots, a little bit of brief gross stuff (but nothing truly gastro-intestinally gruesome and gore-slathered as we find in Tucker and Dale vs Evil, The Cabin in the Woods, Drag Me to Hell or Evil Dead) and eerie sounds.  Then there's the perfect--PERFECT--atmosphere that Wan spins.  Only with this paramount atmosphere could a small child staring into her dark bedroom corner (as we view nothing but out of focus ""black"") be as terrifying as the most horrible monster leaping from behind a corner drooling all manner of evil yuck.As most horror is rushed and features a slapped together story-and-victims-sandwich as a vehicle to shock us with cringing brutality, creature make-up and buckets of rubber guts, Wan demonstrates a mature and tactful restraint which, contrary to most horror filmmakers' training, is wildly successful and eclipses most horror of the last two decades!  Even Wan's shot transitions were thoughtfully discomforting and artistic.The Conjuring is rated R rating but actually seems less scary and intense than Poltergeist (1982)--of course, Poltergeist was WAY scary and I'd keep the kids over 14 to watch it!  I mean, it is scary--very scary.  But the gore is by no means a highlight and I didn't even notice the profanity (whatever there was).  All I noticed was that I was never bored or ""waiting"" for something cool to happen.  I was immersed and loved every minute of this modern classic horror.",5,Poltergeist (1982) meets The Exorcist (1973) in this nearly perfect modern horror classic featuring solid characters &

Wright,"[0, 0]","I should preface this little review by stating that I have seen a great many movies which use the same setup and scare tactics that The Conjuring did. Therefore it wasn't very scary to me at all. However, if you do not watch this sort of thing very often then it may be quite effective and you should enjoy it more than I did. I did like the opening of the movie which tells a little story of a haunted doll.

We kept hearing how scary it was and I was interested to see what made it so.  That being said.  I did not think this movie was scary at all.  I believe that is because it was not a movie that was made with the purpose if scaring you.  It was in fact made to show you the story of what happened to these people.  A husband and wife with 5 kids move into a new house.  Things start to happen.  You will find out the thing that holds the evil and why it is doing what it is doing.  As far as blood and guys go, I do not believe there was much of either.  There was blood at points.  But nothing like horror movies now a days.  With blood flying out of people heads and what not.  Everything in this movie had a purpose.  That is because it was real life.  I was glued to the screen.  It is all very interesting to imagine something so unexplainable happens.  People believe in things they can see and touch.  This thing is something else.  Something pure evil.  It is basically a modern day exorcist.  But unlike The Exorcist, it really does not show you much of the person or persons who are possessed.  You may see them for a bit, but the movie is really about a GROWING evil within a location towards a group of people.  You find out who and why and see the outcome.  If you are interested in the unexplained or paranormal stuff, I believe you will enjoy this movie.

As with all adaptations based on true stories, of course some artistic license is going to be taken, but in this case it doesn't take away from the horrors this family went through. There were some fantastic &#34;jump&#34; scenes, especially when Lili Taylor is alone in the dark in the cellar, and is asked if she wants to play &#34;hide-and-clap&#34;. I DID jump. And here I was watching the film alone in the house at night, all lights off, volume on the TV up pretty high. The Annabelle story at the beginning was also quite freaky. As far as the casting goes, Vera Farmiga deserves top honors for her portrayal of Lorraine Warren, her fears not only for the Perrons but for her own family, her unwavering faith, her belief in everything she and her husband were doing, she was great, I think she really did the real Lorraine Warren a good deal of justice in her portrayal of her. The young actresses who play the terrified children were also great...they were believable, they were so naturalistic it was almost as if no acting was actually required. And Lili Taylor was fantastic as the brutalized, terrified family matriarch.

The reason for this is because of the so-called horror movies that have come out in recent years, namely The Haunting in Connecticut.Well I was WRONG when I saw this movie!  And I'm glad I was.  Not only is The Conjuring incredibly creepy (and a true story), but it's not scary because of special effects; there were barely any used.  The actors were incredible.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren were spot on.  I really also liked that this movie was basically told from their perspective of what they did for people living in haunted houses.  I was reminded of The Amityville Horror (the original, not the remake) because the events in The Conjuring took place in the 1970s and the director thankfully didn't try to modernize that like they did with Haunting in Connecticut.The other actors, Lili Taylor especially were very convincing!  I have always liked her as an actress and I'm glad that she finally got to play a different type of character than she usually does in movies/TV.What I especially enjoyed about this movies was the music.  It was just creepy.  And when you expected something to appear or happen because of music cues...it didn't.  That just made it even scarier.  There were times when I was sure something was going to happen...and then we move to the next scene.

1630375,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B00BEIYMIS,MacheteJason,"[1, 1]","The Conjuring is about two paranormal investigators (Ed & Lorraine Warren) who help the Perron family that has moved into a haunted house. It is partly based on a true story. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research and opened the The Warren's Occult Museum. They claimed to have investigated over 10,000 hauntings during their career. The Warrens were among the very first investigators in the controversial Amityville haunting. Though Ed passed in 2006 (in real life), Lorraine is still involved as a clairvoyant and trance medium. Automatically the film will be compared to Poltergeist, Amityville Horror and Paranormal Activity. It stands up quite well for modern audiences. As the supernatural turns their lives upside down the film provides shades of ""Poltergeist"" where the family, investigators and a local cop try to gather evidence and suppress the evil. Plenty of jump scares. While it isn't perfect I give The Conjuring some credit for being a fairly good horror movie (Hollywood seemingly hasn't been able to do much of that since the 1980s). The performances are good and the story works but it can be predictable in parts. I wouldn't say it is absolutely terrifying but it does have some good moments. It seems moviegoers can't stomach the old R-Rated horror films anymore so The Conjuring manages to bring some of the old magic back. I am happy it grossed over $100 million in the US and even more worldwide. Hopefully more R-Rated horror movies will be made. Director James Wan also did the original Saw but this film isn't quite as shocking as that one. There isn't much in the way of gore at all compared to Saw but the film works well as a supernatural suspense story.Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 | Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Portuguese, SpanishSupplements: Conjuring: Face-To-Face With Terror, A Life In Demonology, Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of YouBuy this Blu-ray.

Compare old classic horror films like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th to their respective reboots and you'll instantly notice that new horror film directors don't actually know what ""horror"" means and try to fill the screen time with gore, gratuitous nudity, silly jump scares and/or annoying shaky-cam.That's why I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  Not only it avoids those pitfalls (it does have a few jump scares, but they're not cheap or unnecessary), it manages to actually tell a good story that can actually scare you.  It might not make you jump from your seat or hide under the covers (it depends on what kind of person you are, really), but it will at the very least creep you out and leave you with an uneasy feeling several times.The first thing you want to do is ignore the ""Based on a true story"" sign.  That's either purposefully misleading or an outright lie, for obvious reasons.  Furthermore, it doesn't matter, since it doesn't add or take from your enjoyment of the story.The plot is, quite frankly, nothing new.  A family moves to a secluded house in the woods and it turns out to be haunted, so they contact a somewhat famous paranormal-investigators couple to help them with their problem before they're driven insane.  The plot bringing nothing new to the table isn't really a bad thing, since it's all about the execution.For starters, the movie counts with an amazing cast.  No superfamous stars or silly Disney TV rejects here.  Everyone, from the youngest to the oldest does a great job with their role.  The visual style of the movie is also very appealing.  The visuals on the movie and the make-up job are excellent, and the little CGI there is does a great job, and it's only used when necessary.Second, the characters here are well represented.  While they're kind of a clich&eacute; (specially the family), they're actually interesting and likable people.  They're clich&eacute;, but they're not one-note.  This is very important, since it marks one of the reasons this movie is not like the awful horror films of later years: you actually care about these characters.  For instance, the paranormal investigators are actually shown to be people who thoroughly investigate the cases to make sure there actually IS something paranormal occuring.  Most movies will just claim these guys are always right and rational people are always wrong, but here, the couple recognizes that most cases of ghosts, spirits or haunting are actually tricks played on people by their own minds.  This marks an important distinction, since in most ""horror"" films these days you hate the main characters so much that you end up rooting for the villain.Third, I can't state this enough: this movie is REALLY creepy.  There are some parts that will give you goosebumps and make you see things that aren't there.  The end shows up pictures of the actual people this film is based on.  Those old-time pictures are usually quite creepy by themselves, more so here.  There are small bits of the story that are left unexplained, which actually adds to the overall mysterious feel of the films, unlike other films, that leave you thinking ""What the hell?"" here the lack of specific details only adds to the film's appeal.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say there are some times when the movie makes you think it's going to do one of those groan-inducing bad-horror-flick clich&eacute;s, but it turns out to be something different.So, again, I think it's a pretty sweet film.  As a last note, the quality of the Blu Ray picture and audio is great.  I haven't checked the extras yet, so I don't know how good they are, but they seem to be a sizable chunk.  If you have a Blu Ray player, that's the way to watch it.",5,A surprisingly good entry in the genre,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,3877,"['Horror', 'movies', 'lately', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'parody', 'films', 'one', 'how', 'properly', 'do', 'anymore', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Compare', 'old', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', 'respective', 'reboots', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'notice', 'new', 'horror', 'film', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'horror', 'means', 'try', 'fill', 'screen', 'time', 'gore', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'silly', 'jump', 'scares', 'and/or', 'annoying', 'shaky-cam.That', 'why', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'pitfalls', 'have', 'few', 'jump', 'scares', ""'re"", 'not', 'cheap', 'unnecessary', 'actually', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'actually', 'scare', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'hide', 'covers', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'really', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'creep', 'out', 'leave', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'several', 'times.The', 'first', 'thing', 'want', 'do', 'ignore', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'sign', 'purposefully', 'misleading', 'outright', 'lie', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Furthermore', ""n't"", 'matter', ""n't"", 'add', 'take', 'enjoyment', 'story.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'frankly', 'nothing', 'new', 'family', 'secluded', 'house', 'woods', 'out', 'be', 'haunted', 'contact', 'somewhat', 'famous', 'paranormal-investigators', 'couple', 'help', 'problem', ""'re"", 'driven', 'insane', 'plot', 'bringing', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'execution.For', 'starters', 'movie', 'amazing', 'cast', 'superfamous', 'stars', 'silly', 'Disney', 'TV', 'rejects', 'here', 'Everyone', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'visual', 'style', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'appealing', 'visuals', 'movie', 'make-up', 'job', 'are', 'excellent', 'little', 'CGI', 'great', 'job', 'only', 'used', 'when', 'necessary.Second', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'well', 'represented', ""'re"", 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', 'specially', 'family', ""'re"", 'actually', 'interesting', 'likable', 'people', ""'re"", 'clich', 'eacute', ""'re"", 'not', 'one-note', 'very', 'important', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'not', 'awful', 'horror', 'films', 'later', 'years', 'actually', 'care', 'characters', 'instance', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'are', 'actually', 'shown', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'investigate', 'cases', 'make', 'sure', 'actually', 'something', 'paranormal', 'occuring', 'Most', 'movies', 'will', 'just', 'claim', 'guys', 'are', 'always', 'right', 'rational', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'wrong', 'here', 'couple', 'most', 'cases', 'ghosts', 'spirits', 'haunting', 'are', 'actually', 'tricks', 'played', 'people', 'own', 'minds', 'important', 'distinction', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'hate', 'main', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'end', 'up', 'rooting', 'villain.Third', 'ca', ""n't"", 'state', 'enough', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'creepy', 'are', 'parts', 'will', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'make', 'see', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'end', 'up', 'pictures', 'actual', 'people', 'film', 'based', 'old-time', 'pictures', 'are', 'usually', 'quite', 'creepy', 'more', 'so', 'here', 'are', 'small', 'bits', 'story', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'actually', 'overall', 'mysterious', 'feel', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'leave', 'thinking', 'What', 'hell', 'here', 'lack', 'specific', 'details', 'only', 'film', 'appeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'think', 'going', 'do', 'one', 'groan-inducing', 'bad-horror-flick', 'clich', 'eacute', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'different.So', 'again', 'think', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'film', 'last', 'note', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'picture', 'audio', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'extras', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'seem', 'be', 'sizable', 'chunk', 'have', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'way', 'watch']",N/A

A family move into a new form and are terrorised by a malevolent spirit. A man and a wife who have dedicated  their lives to investigating and where needed removing evil spirits.While the story might not be anything new it is told well, the level of presentation is very high. The characters are all well played (I'm a big fan of the mother from Bates Motel and she does a good job here as well) and balance the experiences of the film with suitably different perspectives.The effects and camera work are also strong, so while it might not be new it is very watchable.

Roger was a salesman and always away from home, carolyn was home with the children- and she was not mentally stable from what I'm told by a couple of neighbors who have lived here the past 50 years. Roger liked his booze- and his wife a dramatic person- the whole family was unstable. I've actually met the contractor who renovated the house and personally know the family who owned all the land next to the perrons land (which is now mostly owned by Rosenfeld concrete- and I bought my land off of tom Schwartz- who owns all the forest on our block (up to the perrons property) and who's ex-wife Pam used to live in the perron house just after they left. Schwartz bought the property off of the Perron family-The movie is 100% pure BS and not based on a single piece of documented evidence-at all! The Perron's are simply tale tellers and the warrens simply live for the fame and never accommodate skeptics. There's so many holes and inconsistancies in every single one of the warren's ""cases""- I've read them all. This entire movie is based on nothing but rumor and second hand story tales. There hasn't been a single reported incident in this house since Schwartz bought it and since resold it (hmmmm,wonder why?) This movie is actually pissing all of the neighbors off because of all the people who come and take photos and actually knock on everyone's door to get info about the house- even had the burrillville PD keep people away because it's out of control.It's amazing how eager people are to believe and accept any premise that hint's to an afterlife.that being said- it is somewhat of a scary movie; but unlike real terror movies like the exorcist, the conjuring gets you with the typical new-age horror movie scare tactics with use of loud noises in dark rooms - I enjoyed watching it but there were some pretty big holes in the story, for example- why would a man move his 7 member family into a new-england house in the fall without knowing if the furnace was working? According to the movie- the furnace was located in the ""secrete room"" that was accidentally found when the girls were playing ""clap & seek"" in the closet; roger went down into the secrete basement where there was a piano and old furniture, and then found the furnace in the same room, and then told his wife he'd be up in a few minutes, he wanted to try to get the furnace working....??? which means he moved his family into a new-england house just before winter and never thought to ask the sellers where the furnace was- since it was in the ""secrete basement?"" pretty stupid lapse of logic in the story. Too bad I can't post pics- because I have a few of me riding my bike over that bridge you see in the special features section of the dvd ""face to face with terror"" that bridge is less then 1000' from my house just through the woods.watch the movie- just take Hollywood's version (and perron's tales) with a huge, HUGE grain of salt and don't believe everything you see on the big screen- even the ""based on true events"" which is all total bullschlt.I drive past the house every day on the way to / from work- it's a nice house since it was renovated- plenty of new cars in the driveway- certainly doesn't look like anyone is being tortured by demons or ghosts in that house...",3,these are my neighbors- sorry people- hate to tell you this...,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,3496,"['kinda', 'cool', 'actually', 'live', 'just', 'house', 'real', 'house', 'harrisville', 'ri', 'powerline', 'grid-my', 'neighbors', 'who', 'own', 'farm', 'just', 'knew', 'Roger', 'Carolyn', 'personally-', 'little', 'girls', 'Roger', 'was', 'salesman', 'always', 'away', 'home', 'carolyn', 'was', 'home', 'children-', 'was', 'not', 'mentally', 'stable', 'what', ""'m"", 'told', 'couple', 'neighbors', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'here', 'past', '50', 'years', 'Roger', 'liked', 'booze-', 'wife', 'dramatic', 'person-', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'unstable', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'met', 'contractor', 'who', 'renovated', 'house', 'personally', 'know', 'family', 'who', 'owned', 'land', 'perrons', 'land', 'now', 'mostly', 'owned', 'Rosenfeld', 'concrete-', 'bought', 'land', 'tom', 'Schwartz-', 'who', 'forest', 'block', 'perrons', 'property', 'who', 'ex-wife', 'Pam', 'used', 'live', 'perron', 'house', 'just', 'left', 'Schwartz', 'bought', 'property', 'Perron', 'family-The', 'movie', '100', '%', 'pure', 'BS', 'not', 'based', 'single', 'piece', 'documented', 'evidence-at', 'Perron', 'are', 'simply', 'tale', 'tellers', 'warrens', 'simply', 'live', 'fame', 'never', 'accommodate', 'skeptics', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'inconsistancies', 'single', 'one', 'warren', 'cases', ""'ve"", 'read', 'entire', 'movie', 'based', 'nothing', 'rumor', 'second', 'hand', 'story', 'tales', ""n't"", 'been', 'single', 'reported', 'incident', 'house', 'Schwartz', 'bought', 'resold', 'hmmmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'actually', 'pissing', 'neighbors', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'take', 'photos', 'actually', 'knock', 'everyone', 'door', 'get', 'info', 'house-', 'even', 'had', 'burrillville', 'PD', 'keep', 'people', 'away', 'control.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'eager', 'people', 'are', 'believe', 'accept', 'premise', 'hint', 'being', 'said-', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'movie', 'real', 'terror', 'movies', 'exorcist', 'conjuring', 'typical', 'new-age', 'horror', 'movie', 'scare', 'tactics', 'use', 'loud', 'noises', 'dark', 'rooms', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'were', 'pretty', 'big', 'holes', 'story', 'example-', 'why', 'would', 'man', 'move', '7', 'member', 'family', 'new-england', 'house', 'fall', 'knowing', 'furnace', 'was', 'working', 'According', 'movie-', 'furnace', 'was', 'located', 'secrete', 'room', 'was', 'accidentally', 'found', 'when', 'girls', 'were', 'playing', 'clap', 'seek', 'closet', 'went', 'down', 'secrete', 'basement', 'where', 'was', 'piano', 'old', 'furniture', 'then', 'found', 'furnace', 'same', 'room', 'then', 'told', 'wife', ""'d"", 'be', 'up', 'few', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'try', 'get', 'furnace', 'working', 'moved', 'family', 'new-england', 'house', 'just', 'winter', 'never', 'thought', 'ask', 'sellers', 'where', 'furnace', 'was-', 'was', 'secrete', 'basement', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'lapse', 'logic', 'story', 'Too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'post', 'pics-', 'have', 'few', 'riding', 'bike', 'bridge', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'dvd', 'face', 'face', 'terror', 'bridge', 'less', 'then', '1000', 'house', 'just', 'woods.watch', 'movie-', 'just', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'perron', 'tales', 'huge', 'HUGE', 'grain', 'salt', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'everything', 'see', 'big', 'screen-', 'even', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'total', 'bullschlt.I', 'drive', 'house', 'day', 'way', '/', 'work-', 'nice', 'house', 'was', 'renovated-', 'plenty', 'new', 'cars', 'driveway-', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'look', 'anyone', 'being', 'tortured', 'demons', 'ghosts', 'house']",N/A

""The Conjuring"" is based on the case files of husband and wife ghost hunters, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson).  When Carolyn and Roger Perron, along with their five children, move into their new home strange things begin to happen...The youngest daughter starts seeing an imaginary friend, another daughter begins sleep walking and banging her face into a wall, mom wakes up every morning with bruises appearing all over her body, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07 am, and then the really bad things begin to happen.  Enter Lorraine and Ed Warren to evaluate the house to see what is going on.  After a brief tour of the house, Lorraine has visions of death and quickly realizes the evil in this house is trying to attach itself to the family members.  Without going further into the plot, I'll say that the terror in the house escalates fast, leading to a truly scary, and satisfying conclusion.  James Wan, director of ""Saw"", has done a fantastic job of creating a scary and creepy horror movie with enough jolts, jumps, and gore to keep genre fans happy.  With all the garbage remakes, torture horror, or ridiculous PG-13 rated horror movies that have flooded the theaters over the years it's good to see a true scary movie come along.

No effort is made to connect these scenes with an actual, coherent story. So in honor of that, my review will be a random collection of my thoughts on the film. No effort will be made to turn it into an actual, coherent review.I get the distinct feeling that the filmmakers made a cynical bet among themselves that they could make the most derivative, stupid, self-contradictory piece of crap, and as long as it looked nice and could make you jump a little, then they would have a hit. Judging from other reviews of this film, they seem to have been correct.The movie is called ""The Conjuring"" even though there is no actual conjuring that happens.The first ten minutes are about a doll. It's too bad the doll has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie because that was the best part.The movie has something to do with a nice family that moves into a nice house in nice 1971 and is terrorized by something supernatural. It might be ghosts of dead children, or ghosts of people that committed suicide, or witches, or demons, or all of them. Since the screenwriters just stole ideas from other movies and threw them into this script, they clearly didn't worry that the movie makes no sense.This movie even copies ""Paranormal Activity"" (which was itself a copy of other movies). Is it a coincidence that the guy that directed ""The Conjuring"" had previously made ""Insidious"" as a partnership with the ""Paranormal Activity"" team?  Basically, ""The Conjuring"" is really just ""Paranormal Activity 1971"".The movie is partly about Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are real people that used to hunt ghosts and demons. They are most famous for being involved in the Amityville Horror, which was discovered to be a hoax (although this movie doesn't tell you that). There is a melodramatic subplot about how they want to retire, but they love each other too much and are too committed to their mission from God, so they can't quit. And they do get to explain the supernatural events to the family with lines like, ""Sometimes when you get haunted, it's like steppin' in gum--you take it with you.""I learned two things from this ""true story"" - First, the women in the Salem Witch trials were actually witches, and they worshipped Satan. Second, the Pope has to approve all exorcisms, and he doesn't like to help possessed people if they aren't Catholic.While watching the movie, I was trying to keep a mental list of stupid things that happened. But there were too many - I literally lost track of them. I even started laughing towards the end, because the characters seemed to have lost any contact with real life and were just running around making the dumbest decisions they possibly could.There are a couple of jump scares that still worked, and the cinematography was nifty. The groovy 1971 fashion is fun.So it doesn't fail 100% of the time.Just 97% of the time.",1,"boring, inconsistent, and funny",1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2940,"['movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'boring', 'random', 'collection', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'effort', 'made', 'connect', 'scenes', 'actual', 'coherent', 'story', 'So', 'honor', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'random', 'collection', 'thoughts', 'film', 'effort', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'turn', 'actual', 'coherent', 'review.I', 'get', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'cynical', 'bet', 'could', 'make', 'most', 'derivative', 'stupid', 'self-contradictory', 'piece', 'crap', 'as', 'long', 'looked', 'nice', 'could', 'make', 'jump', 'little', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'Judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'correct.The', 'movie', 'called', 'Conjuring', 'even', 'actual', 'conjuring', 'happens.The', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'doll', 'too', 'bad', 'doll', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'part.The', 'movie', 'something', 'do', 'nice', 'family', 'nice', 'house', 'nice', '1971', 'terrorized', 'something', 'supernatural', 'might', 'be', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'children', 'ghosts', 'people', 'committed', 'suicide', 'witches', 'demons', 'screenwriters', 'just', 'stole', 'ideas', 'other', 'movies', 'threw', 'script', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', 'sense.This', 'movie', 'even', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'was', 'copy', 'other', 'movies', 'coincidence', 'guy', 'directed', 'Conjuring', 'had', 'previously', 'made', 'Insidious', 'partnership', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'team', 'Basically', 'Conjuring', 'really', 'just', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '1971', '.The', 'movie', 'partly', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'used', 'hunt', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'are', 'most', 'famous', 'being', 'involved', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'discovered', 'be', 'hoax', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'melodramatic', 'subplot', 'how', 'want', 'retire', 'love', 'other', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'too', 'committed', 'mission', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quit', 'do', 'get', 'explain', 'supernatural', 'events', 'family', 'lines', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'get', 'haunted', 'steppin', 'gum', 'take', 'learned', 'two', 'things', 'true', 'story', 'First', 'women', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'trials', 'were', 'actually', 'witches', 'worshipped', 'Satan', 'Second', 'Pope', 'approve', 'exorcisms', ""n't"", 'like', 'help', 'possessed', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'Catholic.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'keep', 'mental', 'list', 'stupid', 'things', 'happened', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'literally', 'lost', 'track', 'even', 'started', 'laughing', 'end', 'characters', 'seemed', 'have', 'lost', 'contact', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'just', 'running', 'around', 'making', 'dumbest', 'decisions', 'possibly', 'are', 'couple', 'jump', 'scares', 'still', 'worked', 'cinematography', 'was', 'nifty', 'groovy', '1971', 'fashion', 'fun.So', ""n't"", 'fail', '100', '%', 'time.Just', '97', '%', 'time']",N/A

Director James Wan truly is a master at the genre. Insidious revived the genre of horror that had become stale and predictable over the last 20 years. With the arrival of Insidious audiences had a reason to be scared for the first time in many years. It's something of a horror classic. In fact it might well be one of the best horror films ever made. It's filled with fresh new ideas, fantastic production values, great unpredictable moments, and some truly scary sequences. The Conjuring may very well be an even better horror movie. Wan manages to fill the film with many memorable and scary moments, while making it completely different in form and style from Insidious. As I watched it I kept asking myself ""Might this be a new modern day horror masterpiece?"" Well not quite, but it comes very close. There are few moments in the film that let's the audience off the hook, it's filled with plenty of genuine scares, and lots of good old fashioned horror.How many horror movies has there been made that are better than The Conjuring? That is an important question. In my opinion maybe about 10 or 15. Maybe a few more. I've seen everything under the sun, from the most taboo gore films to the most atmospheric of the genre. Despite that this movie made me truly feel horrified several times. It also managed to creep me out big time. The film has some weaker moments, but even those are done to perfection, such as an exorcism sequence near the end. James Wan is clearly a director who knows how to scare the crap out of audiences, or at least jaded horror fanatics like me. Up till near the end I was convinced James Wan's new film is a new modern horror masterpiece. I'm still trying to  decide if that is fitting or not. One thing is for sure, this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in quite some time.I'm eager to see what Mr. Wan does next. Of Wan's work I've only seen Insidious and this one, and both are truly excellent horror movies, done with style, and class. I'm in awe of Wan and the magic he's managed to create within both of these films. Not since The Exorcist and a few other classics like it have I been genuinely horrified by and felt like I've had the bejesus scared out of me like both these Wan films have managed to do.

Out of all the paranormal (type) of movies out there, this one got it right and it will scare the (s***) out of you as it did me. A family buys a house and does not realize that its haunted until its almost too late. This movie is perfectly produced. Every square inch of(time)in this movie was managed very well. There are no (dry or boring) areas, the movie keeps you on edge every minute. The first (5) minutes will scare the hell out you. The next (36) minutes will practically give you a heart attack. But the rest of the movie will certainly put you in a state of full shock. My hats off to the producers, they got this one right! The acting is spot on. Period props, sets, period wardrobe, and make-up are amazing. The special effects are (spot on) with top quality CGI.  This is the perfect ghost/exorcist movie ever, without saying too much. This movie actually makes the original (Exorcist) look like child's play.

1630458,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,B00BEIYMIS,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[2, 6]","when I initially heard of this film and primarily its association with Ed and Lorraine Warren, I had a lot of major expectations. Since I had seen them appear as guests on the Don Lane show in the late 70s, on Australian TV, they made a very strong impression; they spoke of their work more in the sense of a vocation and it was very evident that their strong and positive characters/personalities came through right to the forefront. On the show I saw them on, they played some audio tapes which may have come from the UK or may have been from the US, I don't recall, anyway these tapes were spooky, chilling, and if they ever sold them or provided them as an extra on a new version of this film of some of the documentaries about them, I would buy them at the drop of a hat. The essential point I'm trying to convey is that the character of Ed and Lorraine Go to the heart of the story in the conjuring, and I think you cannot divorce Ed and Lorraine as central and credible real-life characters without changing the story.Right from the start of the film the quality of tension underlies the entire film. James Wan makes the light and shade, as well as a couple of jokes, work immensely well for this film. Although I understand that this was scripted, it was supposed to be scripted from real-life, but thanks to the fact that there is no commentary of any kind, we simply don't know. I think it would be appropriate for the filmmakers to either get Lorraine Warren (if she wants to) do a commentary, or maybe have the writers do a joint commentary saying what is adapted real-life, and what is out and out fiction. Overall, at least from my point of view, I would classify this film as the scariest I've ever seen. I have been shut down about this, and told that MAMA, INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, and some other films are scarier, but given what I know about Ed and Lorraine, and that I like supernatural, ghost house type stories (however, this is so much more than just a ghost house story), I still maintain that this is a James Wan masterpiece that takes you on a tour of the dark side.When I received the DVD Blu-ray combo was happy to find that the cover was the hologram of one particular scene, and it's pretty cool. I still don't like the ultraviolet option since you have to sign up for two accounts (and they ask you for too much personal material), the file you can stream is only available for a limited time, and the so-called digital download presupposes you've passed over all the personal information before you can get the digital file. Anyway, I really wish the Studios would just can it with the UV garbage and provide a digital download. The Three extras are really great, since you get an interview with the original family, as well as the clearly terrified mother; there is also a special on Lorraine Warren, who takes her work very seriously, and the special feature is a very powerful bonus. The feature with James Wan, is a pleasure to watch, since he is obviously done his research on Ed and Lorraine, and it is clear James enjoys his work, and he knows what scares you...; Which makes his later claim, which he gave in a separate interview that I saw on the BBC, that he is leaving horror all the more devastating: there is simply no one of the caliber of James Wan that I am aware of. I for one, certainly hope he goes back on his statement that he is leaving horror, since I'll be lining up for tickets at the theater, and preorders for combo packs.***Amazon's Fulfillment services in Lexington KY is getting to be very bothersome; I had two orders thrown together in one BAG, and it looked like no care was taken with the orders at all.TAKEN 2 had the cover damaged, and the CD ""NEW"" had an obvious bend in the cover; only the CONJURING combo miraculously survived anything except a few minor dings; most of my orders in the last few months have been packed in the same careless manner, and some damage has been above and beyond normal shipping issues, since the el-cheapo packing is used a de-facto send method.",5,"Spooky, chilling, and most of all...

1630469,A34EB4Z1TCWKAB,B00BEIYMIS,Sluggo,"[2, 5]","I love supernatural horror stories and really hoped this one would live up to it's hype.  And, it did - but only marginally.  I got goosebumps and responded to most of the predictable jump out of your seat frights and there was a pleasant eerieness throughout the film, but as many other reviewers have commented, the film was very cliched and was really more a compilation of scenes and story lines from countless other films.And, the appearance of the witch and ghosts was pretty lame - blackened eyes and cracking white makeup.  The Grudge did exponentially better with plain old white and black makeup.  The creaking doors, tossed balls and banging were considerably scarier than the poorly made up ghosts and witch.  Unlike many other films today which overuse CGI, I wish the creators of this film had incorporated some CGI, but all of their special effects and makeup looked like first year quality film student work.  And what was up with the seeming foot fetishes of the ghosts - couldn't the writers have had the ghosts do more than play footsie and pull hair?Aside from those awkward points, I was pulled out of the film by the recurrent and pushy religious assertions of the Warren characters.  Whether the real Warrens really believed it or not, the seemingly constant rambling about missions from god and exortations to baptise the children as well as the hokey insertion of crosses seemed forced and hollow.  This cheesy incorporation of religious aspects was in stark contrast to The Exorcist where it seemed completely natural and essential to the plot.Another weak element was that overall, the acting was pretty sketchy, for instance, I really like Ron Livingston, but in this film, he seemed more like a set piece - a wooden mannequin - than a contributing lead - I don't think his facial expression changed once throughout.  And, while young Joey King was exceptional at conveying terror in her scene with the unseen ghost lurking in the dark corner behind the door, sadly, Lilli Taylor conveyed more a sense of soap opera melo-drama than terror in  many of her scenes.  And Vera Farmiga just seemed glassy eyed and dreary, except for the very brief scene where the possessed Canadian grabbed her arm eliciting horror from her character.And, as many others have pointed out, the ending was way too corny.  I give this movie 3 stars as it gave me a few good jumps and chills, but I kept being pulled out of the film by poor dialogue, poor effects and poor acting.",3,"Liked, but didn't love",1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2483,"['love', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'stories', 'really', 'hoped', 'one', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'did', 'only', 'marginally', 'got', 'goosebumps', 'responded', 'most', 'predictable', 'jump', 'seat', 'frights', 'was', 'pleasant', 'eerieness', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'cliched', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'compilation', 'scenes', 'story', 'lines', 'countless', 'other', 'films.And', 'appearance', 'witch', 'ghosts', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'blackened', 'eyes', 'cracking', 'white', 'makeup', 'Grudge', 'did', 'exponentially', 'better', 'plain', 'old', 'white', 'black', 'makeup', 'creaking', 'doors', 'tossed', 'balls', 'banging', 'were', 'considerably', 'scarier', 'poorly', 'made', 'up', 'ghosts', 'witch', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'today', 'overuse', 'CGI', 'wish', 'creators', 'film', 'had', 'incorporated', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'looked', 'first', 'year', 'quality', 'film', 'student', 'work', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'seeming', 'foot', 'fetishes', 'ghosts', 'could', ""n't"", 'writers', 'have', 'had', 'ghosts', 'do', 'more', 'play', 'footsie', 'pull', 'hair', 'Aside', 'awkward', 'points', 'was', 'pulled', 'film', 'recurrent', 'pushy', 'religious', 'assertions', 'Warren', 'characters', 'real', 'Warrens', 'really', 'believed', 'not', 'seemingly', 'constant', 'rambling', 'missions', 'god', 'exortations', 'baptise', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'hokey', 'insertion', 'crosses', 'seemed', 'forced', 'hollow', 'cheesy', 'incorporation', 'religious', 'aspects', 'was', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Exorcist', 'where', 'seemed', 'completely', 'natural', 'essential', 'plot.Another', 'weak', 'element', 'was', 'overall', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'sketchy', 'instance', 'really', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'film', 'seemed', 'more', 'set', 'piece', 'wooden', 'mannequin', 'contributing', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'facial', 'expression', 'changed', 'once', 'young', 'Joey', 'King', 'was', 'exceptional', 'conveying', 'terror', 'scene', 'unseen', 'ghost', 'lurking', 'dark', 'corner', 'door', 'sadly', 'Lilli', 'Taylor', 'conveyed', 'more', 'sense', 'soap', 'melo-drama', 'terror', 'many', 'scenes', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'just', 'seemed', 'glassy', 'eyed', 'dreary', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'possessed', 'Canadian', 'grabbed', 'arm', 'eliciting', 'horror', 'character.And', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'ending', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'corny', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'gave', 'few', 'good', 'jumps', 'chills', 'kept', 'being', 'pulled', 'film', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'effects', 'poor', 'acting']",N/A

There were a lot of details and subtle sound effects that we missed at the theater that we could hear at home on disc. The video transfer is great. They didn't overdo it on the black levels, so even in the dark parts of the film, you can still see everything you're intended to see without any artifacting or distortion. We could also see bits of the picture that we did not see at the theater. It's a little light on extras, and the ones you do get are nothing more than studio fluff, which is terribly disappointing. There is a feature about the special effects, which I was interested in seeing, but the &#34;feature&#34; they had on it had very little info about the practical effects. There's a ton more to see online, but not included in this Blu-Ray edition. You just need to look for it on YouTube if you want to see it (which I think is silly, being they have PLENTY of room to put that kind of extra stuff on there).As for the story itself, it's a very effective and memorable ghost story. It's said that this movie is rated R due to the sheer scariness of it, and while it didn't give me nightmares, it was right up there with some of the best tension and terror inducing films I've seen. It's not really gory. The best part is that it shows enough to scare you but also lets your mind do most of the scares.

1630494,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00BEIYMIS,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","""The Conjuring"" is based on a true story, specifically a case investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga), parapsychologists who made a career of examining and finding reasons for otherwise unexplainable occurrences. They have also participated in exorcisms.Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston) have just moved into a new house with their five daughters. Initially thrilled with their large home, they gradually discover that all is not right with it. Creepy noises abound, a series of bruises appear on Carolyn with no apparent cause, one of the daughters has conversations with a new, unseen ""friend,"" and birds dive, kamikaze-like, into the windows and walls. Concerned for the safety of their family, the Perrons seek out the Warrens, pleading with them to visit the house and see for themselves what is happening.The Warrens sense an evil presence and agree to help Carolyn and Roger clean house. With their assistant, Drew (Shannon Kook), and loads of cameras, microphones, tape recorders, and movement-sensors, they stake out the numerous rooms of the house. It doesn't take long for ever more dramatic incidents to transpire.If the plot so far sounds suspiciously like ""Poltergeist,"" you're right. The film is essentially a haunted house tale given an interesting spin by its basis in fact.The tendency of a viewer -- even a fan of horror -- is to be skeptical until a movie establishes suspension of disbelief. This never quite happens in ""The Conjuring,"" but director James Wan definitely knows how to build suspense and take his time developing tension. The Perrons are a normal family -- no wife beaters, ax murderers, or telekinetic kids among them -- so we identify fairly quickly as Wan unfolds the beginning of what turns out to be an unforeseeable living nightmare. The fact that there are so many children in the household amps the stakes. Is the house possessed or are dark forces targeting this family in particular?Often, a haunted house film is greeted with the apt criticism, ""Why don't they just leave?""  This question is addressed in one exchange of dialogue. Roger tells the Warrens that the family doesn't have the financial resources to go to a hotel and, when asked if they could stay with friends, asks, ""Who's going to take in a family of seven indefinitely?""The two female leads provide standout performances. Ms. Taylor's Carolyn is a caring mother with a great relationship with her kids and husband. As incidents and danger within the home escalate, she seems to be especially singled out by whatever is tormenting the house and family.  She morphs from protector to victim and vividly projects the abject terror she feels.Ms. Farmiga, so excellent as the crazed mother on TV's ""Bates Motel,"" turns in the kind of nuanced performance seldom seen in horror movies. Her Lorraine is intelligent, devout, and dedicated to helping others.  Her clairvoyant ability makes her a valuable colleague for Ed, but the work has taken its toll in the past and the current case promises to be one of the most dangerous of their careers.As horror films go, ""The Conjuring"" depends more on psychological terror and growing tension than monsters, gore, and gross-out images. It commands your full attention and envelops you in its carefully woven web of eeriness, the other worldly, and human vulnerability as it builds to a climax, at which point director Wan pulls out the stops to shock us with startling images and the characters' reactions. Despite a climactic scene that contradicts rules established earlier, the movie is a powerful exploration of the supernatural.Rated R for some violent scenes, ""The Conjuring""  is the latest in the creepy old house sub-genre of horror films. Only many of the cliches are absent -- no ominous stranger warning the family away, nothing trapping the family within the house, no monsters, no last-minute natural explanation of seemingly supernatural events. Instead, we have a thoughtful picture with solid characters who act intelligently despite encroaching terror.",5,Creepy House Attracts Paranormal Experts,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,4069,"['Conjuring', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'specifically', 'case', 'investigated', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'parapsychologists', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'examining', 'finding', 'reasons', 'otherwise', 'unexplainable', 'occurrences', 'have', 'also', 'participated', 'exorcisms.Carolyn', 'Roger', 'Perron', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'house', 'five', 'daughters', 'Initially', 'thrilled', 'large', 'home', 'gradually', 'discover', 'not', 'right', 'Creepy', 'abound', 'series', 'bruises', 'appear', 'Carolyn', 'apparent', 'cause', 'one', 'daughters', 'conversations', 'new', 'unseen', 'friend', 'birds', 'dive', 'kamikaze-like', 'windows', 'walls', 'Concerned', 'safety', 'family', 'Perrons', 'seek', 'out', 'Warrens', 'pleading', 'visit', 'house', 'see', 'what', 'happening.The', 'Warrens', 'sense', 'evil', 'presence', 'agree', 'help', 'Carolyn', 'Roger', 'clean', 'house', 'assistant', 'Drew', 'Shannon', 'Kook', 'loads', 'cameras', 'microphones', 'tape', 'recorders', 'movement-sensors', 'stake', 'numerous', 'rooms', 'house', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'ever', 'more', 'dramatic', 'incidents', 'transpire.If', 'plot', 'so', 'far', 'suspiciously', 'Poltergeist', ""'re"", 'right', 'film', 'essentially', 'haunted', 'house', 'tale', 'given', 'interesting', 'spin', 'basis', 'fact.The', 'tendency', 'viewer', 'even', 'fan', 'horror', 'be', 'skeptical', 'movie', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'never', 'quite', 'Conjuring', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'definitely', 'how', 'build', 'suspense', 'take', 'time', 'developing', 'tension', 'Perrons', 'are', 'normal', 'family', 'wife', 'beaters', 'ax', 'murderers', 'telekinetic', 'kids', 'identify', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'Wan', 'beginning', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'unforeseeable', 'living', 'nightmare', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'household', 'stakes', 'house', 'possessed', 'are', 'dark', 'forces', 'targeting', 'family', 'particular', 'Often', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'greeted', 'apt', 'criticism', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'question', 'addressed', 'one', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'Roger', 'Warrens', 'family', ""n't"", 'have', 'financial', 'resources', 'go', 'hotel', 'when', 'asked', 'could', 'stay', 'friends', 'asks', 'Who', 'going', 'take', 'family', 'seven', 'indefinitely', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'provide', 'standout', 'performances', 'Ms.', 'Taylor', 'Carolyn', 'caring', 'mother', 'great', 'relationship', 'kids', 'husband', 'incidents', 'danger', 'home', 'escalate', 'be', 'especially', 'singled', 'out', 'tormenting', 'house', 'family', 'morphs', 'protector', 'victim', 'vividly', 'projects', 'abject', 'terror', 'Farmiga', 'so', 'excellent', 'crazed', 'mother', 'TV', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'kind', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'seldom', 'seen', 'horror', 'movies', 'Lorraine', 'intelligent', 'devout', 'dedicated', 'helping', 'others', 'clairvoyant', 'ability', 'valuable', 'colleague', 'Ed', 'work', 'taken', 'toll', 'past', 'current', 'case', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'careers.As', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'Conjuring', 'more', 'psychological', 'terror', 'growing', 'tension', 'monsters', 'gore', 'gross-out', 'images', 'full', 'attention', 'envelops', 'carefully', 'woven', 'web', 'eeriness', 'other', 'worldly', 'human', 'vulnerability', 'climax', 'point', 'director', 'Wan', 'out', 'stops', 'shock', 'startling', 'images', 'characters', 'reactions', 'climactic', 'scene', 'rules', 'established', 'earlier', 'movie', 'powerful', 'exploration', 'supernatural.Rated', 'R', 'violent', 'scenes', 'Conjuring', 'latest', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'sub-genre', 'horror', 'films', 'Only', 'many', 'cliches', 'are', 'absent', 'ominous', 'stranger', 'warning', 'family', 'away', 'nothing', 'trapping', 'family', 'house', 'monsters', 'last-minute', 'natural', 'explanation', 'seemingly', 'supernatural', 'events', 'Instead', 'have', 'thoughtful', 'picture', 'solid', 'characters', 'who', 'act', 'intelligently', 'encroaching', 'terror']",N/A

A lingering question after watching The Conjuring, a film by James Wan.The age of Scary Movie-esque franchises has turned seeing dead people and being haunted by and evil spirits into mundanely comic events. Sexy vampires, farcical zombies, and ridiculous inside jokes about the world&#8217;s end begone! The Conjuring is a big horror film that is actually good and scary. Finally!Still, Director Wan uses all the old horror tricks to build up the suspense: creeping suggestive crescendos in the score, brief uncertain glimpses of unknown beings, and of course, lots of loud and unexpected jolts.The film opens as the Perron family arrives at their new home, a large fixer-upper in the Rhode Island countryside. As the family starts their life in the new house the haunting becomes apparent. Clocks stop, doors slam, people scream. Terror drives the family to huddle up in the living room where they spend their nights sleeping together. It makes the spirits calmer, they say.A little too conveniently, famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren just so happen to be speaking nearby. Mrs. Perron persuades the Warrens to come inspect the house. Lorrain Warren, a kind of clairvoyant, senses real trouble in the Perron house immediately. Using cameras, Holy magic, and Latin scriptures, the fight begins to save not only the house from destruction, but the people inside it as well.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",4,"Finally, a good horror film",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1506,"['Big', 'Question-', 'Christianity', 'Latin', 'existed', 'how', 'did', 'exorcists', 'exorcise', 'lingering', 'question', 'watching', 'Conjuring', 'film', 'James', 'Wan.The', 'age', 'Scary', 'Movie-esque', 'turned', 'seeing', 'dead', 'people', 'being', 'haunted', 'evil', 'spirits', 'mundanely', 'comic', 'events', 'Sexy', 'vampires', 'farcical', 'zombies', 'ridiculous', 'jokes', 'world', '8217', 's', 'end', 'begone', 'Conjuring', 'big', 'horror', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'scary', 'Finally', 'Still', 'Director', 'Wan', 'old', 'horror', 'tricks', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'creeping', 'suggestive', 'crescendos', 'score', 'brief', 'uncertain', 'glimpses', 'unknown', 'beings', 'course', 'lots', 'loud', 'unexpected', 'jolts.The', 'film', 'Perron', 'family', 'new', 'home', 'large', 'fixer-upper', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'countryside', 'family', 'life', 'new', 'house', 'haunting', 'apparent', 'Clocks', 'stop', 'doors', 'slam', 'people', 'scream', 'Terror', 'family', 'huddle', 'up', 'living', 'room', 'where', 'spend', 'nights', 'sleeping', 'together', 'spirits', 'calmer', 'say.A', 'little', 'too', 'conveniently', 'famous', 'demonologists', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'be', 'speaking', 'nearby', 'Mrs.', 'Perron', 'Warrens', 'come', 'inspect', 'house', 'Lorrain', 'Warren', 'kind', 'clairvoyant', 'real', 'trouble', 'Perron', 'house', 'immediately', 'Using', 'cameras', 'Holy', 'magic', 'Latin', 'scriptures', 'fight', 'save', 'not', 'only', 'house', 'destruction', 'people', 'inside', 'well.More', 'reviews', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

She commits suicide after trying to offer her own child as a sacrifice in her practice. Her 200 acre cursed farm house is acquired by different people over a period of time but the witch still hangs around in the cellar of the large house driving away whoever occupies the same. The witch possesses Carolyn and tries to kill her children..This is when Warren and his wife Lorraine (experts in demonology and un-official exorcists) are approached by Perron to exorcise the witch from the house. After employing different techniques Warren and Lorraine finally exorcise the demon from the possessed Carolyn as well as the house successfully, in the nick of the moment when she the later was just about to kill Christine and solve another complicated case.Director of Photography and Sound Effects should be congratulated for their exemplary special effects and real horror experience. Even the bravest of hearts would pound at least once while watching this film. The director has given the film an ethnic look by fitting everything so well that one gets a feeling that he/she is transported to the times in 1970s and enjoy the horror thrill.

1630498,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00BEIYMIS,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","The Conjuring is the fourth film that is based upon alleged real-life events that were investigated by the husband and wife team of paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren.  The others were the 1991 made-for-TV movie The Haunting, 2009&#8217;s The Haunting in Connecticut, and of course, 1979&#8217;s and 2005&#8217;s The Amityville Horror.  Controversy has long surrounded the Warrens with many people firmly believing that these events were hoaxes.  The Conjuring is based on the 1971 case of the Perron family in Rhode Island. The film stars Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as Carolyn and Roger Perron who, along with their five daughters, move into an old farmhouse.Within days of moving in the entire family begins to experience various supernatural disturbances.  Carolyn wakes with mysterious bruises that she cannot explain, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07AM, picture frames fly off walls, and the oldest daughter Andrea is attacked by the gruesome spirit of an old woman.  The couple contacts the Warrens who arrive to investigate the house and determine that the home is haunted by a demonic spirit and will require an Exorcism.  They discover the house was once home to a witch who hung herself from a nearby tree and cursed anyone who came onto the land.While the Warren&#8217;s seek approval from the Catholic Church to have an exorcism done, they setup their equipment inside the house to record the ever-more terrifying events.  When the home becomes to dangerous, the Warrens try to evacuate the house but Carolyn becomes possessed by the demon forcing the Warren&#8217;s to perform the exorcism on their own.  Before long the evil spirit begins to threaten the Warren&#8217;s daughter as well.The Conjuring earns points mainly due to its simplicity.  While so many modern supernatural horror films rely on abundant and increasingly distracting CGI for special effects, The Conjuring is more old school relying on suspense and things that go bump in the night.  Its actors behave the way a real person would behave.  There&#8217;s not a lot of histrionics such as the usual man of the family who is always too willing to come up with a rational explanation for the events.But The Conjuring pays for its lack of originality by being far too similar to films like Poltergeist, The Exorcism, and The Amityville Horror.  While it does what it does well with a fair amount of shock moments, there is an undeniable been there-done that tone to the action.  Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are refreshing and likable as the Warrens although the film doesn&#8217;t help their reputation among some as charlatans by showing them with a room in their house filled with dozens of cursed or formerly possessed items that they have confiscated from previous cases.  While the Conjuring doesn&#8217;t re-invent the haunted house film it definitely is one of the better entries we&#8217;ve seen in recent years.Tim Janson, Mania Entertainment",4,Effective Horror film,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2960,"['Conjuring', 'fourth', 'film', 'based', 'alleged', 'real-life', 'events', 'were', 'investigated', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'others', 'were', '1991', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Haunting', '2009', '8217', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'course', '1979', '8217', 's', '2005', '8217', 's', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Controversy', 'long', 'surrounded', 'Warrens', 'many', 'people', 'firmly', 'believing', 'events', 'were', 'hoaxes', 'Conjuring', 'based', '1971', 'case', 'Perron', 'family', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'film', 'stars', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Carolyn', 'Roger', 'Perron', 'who', 'five', 'daughters', 'move', 'old', 'farmhouse.Within', 'days', 'moving', 'entire', 'family', 'experience', 'various', 'supernatural', 'disturbances', 'Carolyn', 'mysterious', 'bruises', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'clocks', 'house', 'stop', '3:07AM', 'picture', 'frames', 'fly', 'walls', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Andrea', 'attacked', 'gruesome', 'spirit', 'old', 'woman', 'couple', 'Warrens', 'who', 'arrive', 'investigate', 'house', 'determine', 'home', 'haunted', 'demonic', 'spirit', 'will', 'require', 'Exorcism', 'discover', 'house', 'was', 'once', 'home', 'witch', 'who', 'hung', 'nearby', 'tree', 'cursed', 'anyone', 'who', 'came', 'land.While', 'Warren', '8217', 'seek', 'approval', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'have', 'exorcism', 'done', 'setup', 'equipment', 'house', 'record', 'ever-more', 'terrifying', 'events', 'When', 'home', 'dangerous', 'Warrens', 'try', 'evacuate', 'house', 'Carolyn', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'demon', 'forcing', 'Warren', '8217', 's', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'own', 'long', 'evil', 'spirit', 'threaten', 'Warren', '8217', 's', 'daughter', 'well.The', 'Conjuring', 'points', 'mainly', 'due', 'simplicity', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'films', 'rely', 'abundant', 'increasingly', 'distracting', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'Conjuring', 'more', 'old', 'school', 'relying', 'suspense', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'actors', 'behave', 'way', 'real', 'person', 'would', 'behave', '8217', 'not', 'lot', 'histrionics', 'such', 'usual', 'man', 'family', 'who', 'always', 'too', 'willing', 'come', 'up', 'rational', 'explanation', 'events.But', 'Conjuring', 'lack', 'originality', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'similar', 'films', 'Poltergeist', 'Exorcism', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'what', 'well', 'fair', 'amount', 'shock', 'moments', 'undeniable', 'been', 'there-done', 'tone', 'action', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'are', 'refreshing', 'likable', 'Warrens', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'help', 'reputation', 'charlatans', 'showing', 'room', 'house', 'filled', 'dozens', 'cursed', 'formerly', 'possessed', 'items', 'have', 'confiscated', 'previous', 'cases', 'Conjuring', 'doesn', '8217', 're-invent', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'entries', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'recent', 'years.Tim', 'Janson', 'Mania', 'Entertainment']",N/A
1630499,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B00BEIYMIS,titania86,"[6, 16]","In 1971, Roger, Carolyn, and their daughters move to an old farmhouse in Rhode Island. Everything is fine and dandy on the first day, but the next day brings odd events. Carolyn wakes up with weird bruises and the family dog is found dead outside. The weird happenings increase and Carolyn is attacked in the middle of the night and locked in the cellar. The family contacts paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren,who ascertain that an exorcism might be needed. They need to collect proof to send to the Catholic Church before anything can be done. It looks as if the church won't respond in time to save the family, so the Warrens and the family are on their own to save themselves.The Conjuring is set in the 70's and a throwback to 70's horror films. It doesn't bring anything new to horror and relies to much on cheap jump scares for my taste. Parts of the film are very atmospheric and scary. My favorite part is where Carolyn is awoken in the middle of the night and lured into the basement by disembodied clapping only to be attacked. The scene was used as an extended trailer and made me excited to watch the film. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the only part of the film I really liked. The film was quite predictable and wasn't surprising in any positive way.The film was surprising in a number of negative ways. First of all, the writers of the film, Chad and Carey Hayes, wrote this film as religious propaganda and it definitely shows. Faith is brought up in extremely obvious dialog multiple times and the entire film just boils down to a very simple good vs. evil story where faith triumphs over evil. The treatment of women is painfully apparent that the lens of the film is one of conservatism and religion. The evil spirit only directly attacks women. Women have been known in the Bible to be weaker then men and more susceptible to evil, causing original sin and things of that nature. On the night the evil starts, Carolyn initiates sex with her husband and we all know how well the Bible treats seductresses. This act basically ushers the evil in to her and of course the husband is merely an innocent bystander in the situation. Watching the misogyny on the screen was infuriating.The villain of the film is Bathsheba, an evil witch who sacrifices children to Satan. Even after her death, she has been possessing women and manipulating them into killing their children and/or themselves. It's fun to look at the biblical Bathsheba. King David spied her in her bath, fell in love with her, and seduced her. Then he tried to cover up his sin by ordering the death of her husband. I find it particularly ironic that this evil, child-murdering female is named after a woman who was objectified and victimized by a powerful man and probably raped.The last offensive thing about the film is the treatment of the Salem witch trials. The film puts forth that real witches were killed for the greater good. Not one little comment was made to say that innocent people died at all. Bathsheba could have committed suicide to save herself from a much more agonizing death being burned at the stake. I understand making history fit a story, but justifying the deaths of innocent people is pretty disgusting.The Conjuring is a misogynistic and offensive film. Even without reading anything into the story, it's merely derivative of so many other things out there and doesn't do anything new or interesting. I don't understand why so many people seem to love this flat propagandist film.",1,Offensive and infuriating religious propaganda,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,3500,"['1971', 'Roger', 'Carolyn', 'daughters', 'move', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Everything', 'fine', 'dandy', 'first', 'day', 'next', 'day', 'odd', 'events', 'Carolyn', 'up', 'weird', 'bruises', 'family', 'dog', 'found', 'dead', 'outside', 'weird', 'happenings', 'increase', 'Carolyn', 'attacked', 'middle', 'night', 'locked', 'cellar', 'family', 'paranormal', 'experts', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'who', 'ascertain', 'exorcism', 'might', 'be', 'needed', 'need', 'collect', 'proof', 'send', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'church', 'wo', ""n't"", 'respond', 'time', 'save', 'family', 'Warrens', 'family', 'are', 'own', 'save', 'themselves.The', 'Conjuring', 'set', '70', 'throwback', '70', 'horror', 'films', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'horror', 'relies', 'much', 'cheap', 'jump', 'scares', 'taste', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'scary', 'favorite', 'part', 'where', 'Carolyn', 'awoken', 'middle', 'night', 'lured', 'basement', 'disembodied', 'clapping', 'only', 'be', 'attacked', 'scene', 'was', 'used', 'extended', 'trailer', 'made', 'excited', 'watch', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'predictable', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'positive', 'way.The', 'film', 'was', 'surprising', 'number', 'negative', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'writers', 'film', 'Chad', 'Carey', 'Hayes', 'wrote', 'film', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'definitely', 'Faith', 'brought', 'up', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'dialog', 'multiple', 'times', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'boils', 'down', 'very', 'simple', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'story', 'where', 'faith', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'treatment', 'women', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'lens', 'film', 'one', 'conservatism', 'religion', 'evil', 'spirit', 'only', 'directly', 'women', 'Women', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'Bible', 'be', 'weaker', 'then', 'men', 'more', 'susceptible', 'evil', 'causing', 'original', 'sin', 'things', 'nature', 'night', 'evil', 'Carolyn', 'sex', 'husband', 'know', 'how', 'well', 'Bible', 'treats', 'seductresses', 'act', 'basically', 'evil', 'course', 'husband', 'merely', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'situation', 'Watching', 'misogyny', 'screen', 'was', 'infuriating.The', 'villain', 'film', 'Bathsheba', 'evil', 'witch', 'who', 'children', 'Satan', 'Even', 'death', 'been', 'possessing', 'women', 'manipulating', 'killing', 'children', 'and/or', 'fun', 'look', 'biblical', 'Bathsheba', 'King', 'David', 'spied', 'bath', 'fell', 'love', 'seduced', 'Then', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'sin', 'ordering', 'death', 'husband', 'find', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'evil', 'child-murdering', 'female', 'named', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'objectified', 'victimized', 'powerful', 'man', 'probably', 'raped.The', 'last', 'offensive', 'thing', 'film', 'treatment', 'Salem', 'witch', 'trials', 'film', 'forth', 'real', 'witches', 'were', 'killed', 'greater', 'good', 'Not', 'one', 'little', 'comment', 'was', 'made', 'say', 'innocent', 'people', 'died', 'Bathsheba', 'could', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide', 'save', 'much', 'more', 'agonizing', 'death', 'being', 'burned', 'stake', 'understand', 'making', 'history', 'fit', 'story', 'justifying', 'deaths', 'innocent', 'people', 'pretty', 'disgusting.The', 'Conjuring', 'misogynistic', 'offensive', 'film', 'Even', 'reading', 'anything', 'story', 'merely', 'derivative', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'there', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'love', 'flat', 'propagandist', 'film']",N/A

For any era.The Conjuring is somewhat scary. I didn't jump, flinch, or feel that 'look-over-my-shoulder,' way, once the movie ended.What I felt was cheated. A waste of 15.00.'Based on true events.'Obviously there are stories, yes, even horror, based on true events. Of course many scenes are fictitious. Normally, people don't keep tabs on their lives, 24/7, so fiction is necessary.I'd bet 85-90% of The Conjuring is fiction.Based on true events is also a lie. One example is Blair Witch Project. They said it was a true story. We went to the theater, paid a small fortune to see it. TRUE, my a$$!. Not only was it untrue, it was terrible.I do not consider movies, with a 'shaky camera,' well-made.I purchased BWP book..the cover reads. FICTION.The Warrens: The couple who vowed the house is in Amityville was haunted..demons lurked in every corner. Those who believe Amityville Horror is a true story are, well, naive. LOL.The scene that irked me in The Conjuring was their discussion about the exorcist.Before an exorcism, the alleged 'possessed' person must see doctors, psychiatrists and an authorized Bishop and/or Vatican need be notified, NOT any Catholic Church. An Exorcist MUST be given permission which can take months to years to be granted. IF granted.I haven't seen The Exorcist in ages, but I think there's a part where Chris McNeil/Ellen Burstyn asks Father Damien Karras how to go about getting an exorcism. He replies, 'you have to go back in a time machine,' or some such phrase then explains all that's required..The amount of work involved.In other words, a person has a better chance winning Lotto than finding an actual exorcist and being granted permission.The Warrens make it sound simple like they did in the movie, Amityville. Research should be done before making an alleged non-fiction movie.All in all, I do not feel The Conjuring deserved all the hype or 5-stars. I might have given a higher rating if it wasn't labeled true. I don't like liars.The story is actually about the Warrens..What a job!!! Lots of $ talking, writing, making movies about ghosts..",3,No comparison to The Exorcist!,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2418,"['Where', 'begin', 'had', 'feeling', 'should', 'have', 'rented', 'Conjuring', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'instead', 'listened', 'friends', 'read', '4', '5-star', 'reviews.My', 'own', 'fault', 'one', 'broke', 'arm.How', 'can', 'anyone', 'compare', 'Conjuring', 'Exorcist', 'comparison', 'Exorcist', 'terrifying', 'excellently', 'acted', 'well-made', 'movie', 'era.The', 'Conjuring', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'flinch', 'feel', ""'look-over-my-shoulder"", 'way', 'once', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'cheated', 'waste', '15.00', ""'Based"", 'true', 'events', ""'Obviously"", 'are', 'stories', 'yes', 'even', 'horror', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'course', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'fictitious', 'Normally', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'tabs', 'lives', '24/7', 'fiction', 'necessary.I', ""'d"", 'bet', '85-90', '%', 'Conjuring', 'fiction.Based', 'true', 'events', 'also', 'lie', 'One', 'example', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'said', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'went', 'theater', 'paid', 'small', 'fortune', 'see', 'TRUE', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'untrue', 'was', 'terrible.I', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'movies', ""'shaky"", 'camera', 'well-made.I', 'purchased', 'BWP', 'book..the', 'cover', 'FICTION.The', 'Warrens', 'couple', 'who', 'vowed', 'house', 'Amityville', 'was', 'haunted..demons', 'lurked', 'corner', 'who', 'believe', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'well', 'naive', 'LOL.The', 'scene', 'irked', 'Conjuring', 'was', 'discussion', 'exorcist.Before', 'exorcism', 'alleged', ""'possessed"", 'person', 'must', 'see', 'doctors', 'psychiatrists', 'authorized', 'Bishop', 'and/or', 'Vatican', 'need', 'be', 'notified', 'NOT', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Exorcist', 'MUST', 'be', 'given', 'permission', 'can', 'take', 'months', 'years', 'be', 'granted', 'IF', 'granted.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Exorcist', 'ages', 'think', 'part', 'where', 'Chris', 'McNeil/Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Father', 'Damien', 'Karras', 'how', 'go', 'getting', 'exorcism', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'machine', 'such', 'phrase', 'then', 'required..The', 'amount', 'work', 'involved.In', 'other', 'words', 'person', 'better', 'chance', 'winning', 'Lotto', 'finding', 'actual', 'exorcist', 'being', 'granted', 'permission.The', 'Warrens', 'make', 'sound', 'simple', 'did', 'movie', 'Amityville', 'Research', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'making', 'alleged', 'non-fiction', 'movie.All', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'Conjuring', 'deserved', 'hype', '5-stars', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'higher', 'rating', 'was', ""n't"", 'labeled', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'liars.The', 'story', 'actually', 'Warrens..What', 'job', 'Lots', 'talking', 'writing', 'making', 'movies', 'ghosts..']",N/A

When the Perron family moves into a new house they begin to notice strange events and images happening. When the kids refuse to be alone the family contacts paranormal investigators Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to help them figure out what is going on. What they find is something that none of them could have imagined and could destroy the lives of everyone involved. I have said over and over that I am not a huge horror movie fan mainly because I'm not a fan of the ""let's chop people up"" aspect. The ones that scare me are the subdued and psychological thrillers like Insidious and The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. This one can be added to the list. To me being alone in a house and seeing an empty baby roller chair moving on its own while you hear the music from a jack-in-the-box playing is way more terrifying then being chased by a man with a chainsaw. While this didn't scare me like the other two I mentioned it came close and this along with The Purge are the best horror movies to come out in a while.

Then she comes back and possesses some other mommies that move into the house. Then she makes those mommies kill their kids. The house is like a big hotel for killer mommy spirits. WOW. True story, bro. But, needs more dragons.A new mommy moves into the suicidal Satanist's house and creaky doors start opening and all the clocks stop at 3:07 AM. That's eerie as hell... Not really, but it must have sounded good on paper. The new mommy gets crazy Ed and Lorraine Warren to save her family because the Warrens believe in God. The new mommy is not religious but she still gets possessed by the witchy woman. And, she wants to kill her kids really bad. And that's just wrong. If you were a Satanic spirit, why would you want to possess someone that wasn't a threat to your religion? I would only possess believers. But, that's just me. And why doesn't anyone ever get possessed by Jesus and start working miracles? Why is it always the Devil? And why doesn't Jesus ever actually show up at an exorcism? I think he should at least make an appearance once in a while.SPOILER ALERT: In an amazing plot twist at the end, the Warrens DO save the family because Eddy Warren has a Bible and he reads it out loud. (Although, not very well.) But, for some reason the Warrens can't stop the birds from killing themselves. Why couldn't the Warrens save the birds? What kind of Christians are these people? Is there a special exorcism bird Bible for suicidal pigeons? If not, there should be.After watching this, I'm absolutely convinced that Andrea Yates didn't drown her children. She was possessed by a demon. Andrea Yates should have hired the Warrens to testify at her trial that the devil made her do it. She could be out of jail right now and baking apple pies for a brand new set of kids. But apparently, God works in mysterious ways. And, the Warrens are hucksters. This is just another one of their hoaxes.SPOILER ALERT: At first I was frightened because they said that this was a TRUE STORY. But at the end, Ed Warren says that God and the Devil are REAL. So...

Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) live in such a house where manvelant spirits are threatening their family. Unfortunately the spirits have latched on to the family so no matter where they go, it'll follow them. Carolyn reaches out to Ed and Lorraine hoping that they can help drive the creatures from their home.A nice blend of the new and old ""The Conjuring"" touches on everything from ""The Amnityville Horror"" to ""The Exorcist"" with a touch of ""The Birds"" thrown in for good measure. Wan skillful merges these different elements and, with terrific performances from his cast, creates a refreshingly old fasioned scare fest that is a nice change of pace from the ""found footage"" flicks.I did feel that the film lost some of its momentum by the conclusion but, otherwise, it was a fun ride.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray edition looks marvelous. This is the type of film that has long sequences in darkness. The blu-ray transfer has nice detail and the subdued color scheme is largely faithful to the theatrical showing of the film.The audio is immersive putting us into the house with the family.The special features seem a bit on the lite side to me but what we do get is pretty good. ""The Conjuring: Face To Face With Terror"" allows the family (and Lorraine Warren, Ed is deceased) portrayed in the film to share their experience.We also get a featurette ""A Life In Demonology"" focusing on the cases that the Warrens worked on. We also get a glimpse inside the New England Paranormal Museum. Other paranormal investigators also chime in with information about Ed and Lorraine Warren.The final special feature is an eight minute featurette entitled ""Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You"". Producer Peter Sanfran, Veriga and Wan discuss the making of the film and what brought them to the project.The packaging also includes a DVD (with all the special features) and a code for a digital download.A entertaining horror movie with plenty of thrills, ""The Conjuring"" reminds us that you don't need buckets of blood, sex or outrageous violence to scare your audience. As someone points out in the ""Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You"" Wan wanted to avoid ""cheap scares"" and use his skills as a film director (the writers point out that the original script had MORE scares but Wan elected to pull some of them out so that he could build suspense)to pull the audience in before pulling the rug out from under them.",4,Boo!

1630524,AP3B615GM191G,B00BEIYMIS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","Horror films admittedly are not my favorite genre of film, but when I'm watching a good one it is usually a pretty engrossing experience for me.  All too often, horror flicks are just full of &#34;cheap scares&#34; that are good for getting the boys to wrap their arms a little tighter around their girlfriends.  While &#34;The Conjuring&#34; does provide those moments, it also tells a pretty good demonic possession story along the way.For a basic plot summary, &#34;The Conjuring&#34; tells the story of Roger (Ron Livingstone), Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters who move into a new house that they quickly discover is infested by demonic forces.  As such, demonologists Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are called in to try and subdue the hauntings.Obviously, the first criteria any horror movie is judged by is quite simple: is it scary?  &#34;The Conjuring&#34; easily passes that test, as not only does it have some of the requisite &#34;jump moments&#34;, but also some psychological terror as well.  It pretty much single-handedly brought the kids game of &#34;hide-and-clap&#34; back into national consciousness.Beyond the scares, though, the movie tells a pretty intriguing story revolving around demonic possession.  In fact, I actually thought the film could have focused even more on those areas (adding more of a &#34;God vs. Devil&#34; aspect) in order to gain the five-star ranking, but it is still interesting nonetheless.  Clearly, director James Wan (also director of the first few &#34;Saw&#34; movies) knows how to weave a compelling story into a scary narrative.Overall, I enjoyed the experience of &#34;The Conjuring&#34;.  It isn't in my top echelon of scary movies (Halloween, Saw, The Ring), but it is far better than most slashers or gore-fests.",4,"A Film With ""Jumps""...But Also A Good Story",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1802,"['Horror', 'films', 'admittedly', 'are', 'not', 'favorite', 'genre', 'film', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'good', 'one', 'usually', 'pretty', 'engrossing', 'experience', 'too', 'often', 'horror', 'flicks', 'are', 'just', 'full', '34', 'cheap', 'scares', '34', 'are', 'good', 'getting', 'boys', 'wrap', 'arms', 'little', 'tighter', 'girlfriends', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'provide', 'moments', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'demonic', 'possession', 'story', 'way.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'story', 'Roger', 'Ron', 'Livingstone', 'Carolyn', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'five', 'daughters', 'who', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'quickly', 'discover', 'infested', 'demonic', 'forces', 'such', 'demonologists', 'Ed', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Lorraine', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'are', 'called', 'try', 'subdue', 'hauntings.Obviously', 'first', 'criteria', 'horror', 'movie', 'judged', 'quite', 'simple', 'scary', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', 'easily', 'test', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'requisite', '34', 'jump', 'moments', '34', 'also', 'psychological', 'terror', 'as', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'single-handedly', 'brought', 'kids', 'game', '34', 'hide-and-clap', '34', 'back', 'national', 'consciousness.Beyond', 'scares', 'though', 'movie', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'story', 'revolving', 'demonic', 'possession', 'fact', 'actually', 'thought', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'even', 'more', 'areas', 'adding', 'more', '34', 'God', 'Devil', '34', 'aspect', 'order', 'gain', 'five-star', 'ranking', 'still', 'interesting', 'nonetheless', 'Clearly', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'also', 'director', 'first', 'few', '34', 'Saw', '34', 'movies', 'how', 'weave', 'compelling', 'story', 'scary', 'narrative.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'experience', '34', 'Conjuring', '34', ""n't"", 'top', 'echelon', 'scary', 'movies', 'Halloween', 'Saw', 'Ring', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'slashers', 'gore-fests']",N/A
