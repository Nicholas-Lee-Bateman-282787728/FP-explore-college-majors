I was skeptical when my wife brought this video home for &quot;us&quot; to watch, but I decided to give it an honest try.  Once the  movie got underway, and the character development started to take place, I  became interested.  There was more to Grant than a womanizing cad (thought  it took a while for him to shake that image in the movie), and Kerr came  across as a world-wise, yet innocent (in a sense), former night club  singer.While they are both committed to other people, Grant and Kerr  meet and fall in love on a ship cruising from Europe to America.Some  of the dialogue and situations appear to be somewhat contrived, but the  acting and story line development stirs true emotion.This is probably  not a movie for the bump and grind Monday Night Football crowd, but it is  both watchable and enjoyable.  Maybe I was primed to watch it by seeing  &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; recently, a movie that my wife and I both  enjoy.Anyway, give this movie a chance...it's somewhat dated, but it's  still got something to offer.",4,Better than I anticipated....,949622400,"02 4, 2000",2000,1126,"['quot', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'quot', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'lot', 'offer', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'wife', 'brought', 'video', 'home', 'quot', 'quot', 'watch', 'decided', 'give', 'honest', 'try', 'movie', 'got', 'underway', 'character', 'development', 'started', 'take', 'place', 'became', 'interested', 'was', 'more', 'Grant', 'womanizing', 'cad', 'thought', 'took', 'while', 'shake', 'image', 'movie', 'Kerr', 'came', 'world-wise', 'innocent', 'sense', 'former', 'night', 'club', 'singer.While', 'are', 'committed', 'other', 'people', 'Grant', 'Kerr', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'ship', 'cruising', 'Europe', 'America.Some', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'appear', 'be', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'development', 'stirs', 'true', 'emotion.This', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'bump', 'grind', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Football', 'crowd', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'Maybe', 'was', 'primed', 'watch', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'quot', 'recently', 'movie', 'wife', 'enjoy.Anyway', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'still', 'got', 'something', 'offer']",An Affair to Remember VHS

256354,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301586026,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","With Cary Grant's dapper charm and Deborah Kerr's elegance, one would have to be blind not to fall in love with this film's surface good looks, but what makes `An Affair to Remember' so unforgettable is that it reaches far below that surface to deliver a believable love story that embellishes the star's undeniable charisma.In a word, `An Affair to Remember' is...memorable.The film tells of playboy Nickie Ferrante who just so happens to be settling down.  On a cruise he happens to meet Terry McKay, a charming woman who also happens to be settling down.  The two are instantly attracted to one another, but Nickie's reputation has Terry attempting to avoid him.  His charm is too much and before long they are spending a lot of time together, innocently at first, but it doesn't take long for genuine feelings to creep up within both parties.  They try and separate themselves in order to remain true to their significant others, but their desire runs too deep and before the cruise has ended they have fallen in love.  Wanting to be sure that this is the real thing, they decide to separate for six months (giving Nickie the opportunity to actually work for his catch in more ways than one) only to reunite on the Empire State Building.But will they ever meet again?The first half of the film is brilliantly fleshed out.  This isn't your average `boy meets girl, falls in love, believe it or not' type story.  The screenwriters (McCarey, Daves & Stewart) worked really hard to make the love affair between Nickie and Terry authentic and believable.  You can see them falling in love, slowly but genuinely.  The second half is not nearly as good as the first, but it is still good (don't think I'm putting it down any).  With the two stars separated it lacks some of the first half's undeniable charm and appeal.Grant, much like George Clooney, Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, is often seen for his looks and charm before his acting talent, but here he is a brilliant mixture of elegance and human emotional complexity.  He really understands how to reign in his charming demeanor for the films climax and portray a man scorned by something he doesn't quite understand.  The coldness he demonstrates is without flaw.  Deborah Kerr is marvelous here as well, matching Grant step for step in the films first half and then completely capturing her character's emotional dilemma in the films second half.  Without her dedicated performance the finale would not have worked.Oozing with sensual lavishness (is it just me or was that off screen kiss on the cruise ship one of the most beautifully captured displays of affection in all of cinematic history), `An Affair to Remember' gets it all right, and then some.  It's charming, witty, alluring and touching; a film that will make you laugh, make you cry and make you fall in love.",5,Timeless indeed...,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2831,"['Cary', 'Grant', 'dapper', 'charm', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'elegance', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'blind', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'surface', 'good', 'looks', 'what', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'far', 'surface', 'deliver', 'believable', 'love', 'story', 'star', 'undeniable', 'charisma.In', 'word', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'memorable.The', 'film', 'tells', 'playboy', 'Nickie', 'Ferrante', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'cruise', 'meet', 'Terry', 'McKay', 'charming', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'two', 'are', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'one', 'Nickie', 'reputation', 'Terry', 'attempting', 'avoid', 'charm', 'too', 'much', 'long', 'are', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'innocently', 'first', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'creep', 'up', 'parties', 'try', 'separate', 'order', 'remain', 'true', 'significant', 'others', 'desire', 'too', 'deep', 'cruise', 'ended', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'Wanting', 'be', 'sure', 'real', 'thing', 'decide', 'separate', 'six', 'months', 'giving', 'Nickie', 'opportunity', 'actually', 'work', 'catch', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'only', 'reunite', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building.But', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'again', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'fleshed', 'out', ""n't"", 'average', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'love', 'believe', 'not', 'type', 'story', 'screenwriters', 'McCarey', 'Daves', 'Stewart', 'worked', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'love', 'affair', 'Nickie', 'Terry', 'authentic', 'believable', 'can', 'see', 'falling', 'love', 'slowly', 'genuinely', 'second', 'half', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'still', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'putting', 'down', 'two', 'stars', 'separated', 'first', 'half', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'appeal.Grant', 'much', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'often', 'seen', 'looks', 'charm', 'acting', 'talent', 'here', 'brilliant', 'mixture', 'elegance', 'human', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'really', 'how', 'reign', 'charming', 'demeanor', 'films', 'climax', 'portray', 'man', 'scorned', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'coldness', 'flaw', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'marvelous', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'matching', 'Grant', 'step', 'step', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'completely', 'capturing', 'character', 'emotional', 'dilemma', 'films', 'second', 'half', 'dedicated', 'performance', 'finale', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked.Oozing', 'sensual', 'lavishness', 'just', 'was', 'off', 'screen', 'kiss', 'cruise', 'ship', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'displays', 'affection', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Affair', 'Remember', 'right', 'then', 'charming', 'witty', 'alluring', 'touching', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'make', 'cry', 'make', 'fall', 'love']",An Affair to Remember VHS

Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are perfection as the two people who meet on a ship and fall in love.  Because they are each engaged to other people, they decide to put their feelings to the test of time.  They agree to meet atop the Empire State Building in six months if they feel the same.  One shows up, one doesn't because of tragic circumstances. When they accidentally meet months later at a ballet, it is awkward, yet the chemistry cannot be denied. A sentimental painting, an art dealer's story of a lady in a wheelchair, and Cary Grant's dramatic opening of a door lead to an ending that requires a full box of tissues but is one of Hollywood's most memorable scenes.  In addition, this movie is enhanced by a delighful choir of orphans, a grandmother with an idyllic villa, and Richard Denning in a superb supporting role.

256356,A2EL3990HXOMZB,6301586026,Antonio Robert,"[0, 0]","I am trying to get into the shoes of director Leo McCarey... Why would he repeat practically the same film after the 1939 &#34;A Love Affair?&#34; of his? Maybe he counted on the ongoing popularity of Cary Grant in the 1950's to revive his own directorial career. He partly succeeded with the approach - &#34;An Affair to Remember&#34; is a much-better known film than its predecessor, starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. That's what you call marketing / public relations.Still, the 1939 version has at least three things better than this one. First, it is some 25 minutes shorter (Deborah Kerr's 1957 singing exercises with her pupils are very tedious).Second, there is a greater chemistry between Boyer and Dunne (subjectively, of course) - without taking any merit away from artistry of Grant or Kerr. And there are other things. For example, I do not have to wait to be moved until the final scene. My eyes are already wet when Terry comes back to hug Michel's grandmother goodbye in her home at Madeira.And third... the 1939 film just has that real (although hard to define) class and rings with more genuine emotion.&#34;An Affair to Remember&#34; is one of the films, which reputation is in actuality better than the movie itself. I know this is a notorious tearjerker and a sentimental favorite for many and the template for Sleepless in Seattle (which in my opinion is not even best Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan collaboration). But still - if you like this one, you may well find &#34;A Love Affair&#34; even better. No wonder, really - it was produced in 1939, alongside such great movies as &#34;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&#34;, &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;, &#34;Ninotchka&#34; or the French gem &#34;Rules of the Game&#34;.And as for directorial class of Leo McCarey, check &#34;A Night at the Opera&#34; with Marx Brothers, &#34;The Awful Truth&#34; combining Cary Grant and Irene Dunne (that's chemistry!) and even &#34;Going My Way&#34; / &#34;The Bells of St Mary's&#34;  with Bing Crosby.",3,Not Better Than the Original,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2002,"['am', 'trying', 'get', 'shoes', 'director', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'Why', 'would', 'repeat', 'practically', 'same', 'film', '1939', '34', 'A', 'Love', 'Affair', '34', 'Maybe', 'counted', 'ongoing', 'popularity', 'Cary', 'Grant', '1950', 'revive', 'own', 'directorial', 'career', 'partly', 'succeeded', 'approach', '34', 'Affair', 'Remember', '34', 'much-better', 'known', 'film', 'predecessor', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'what', 'call', 'marketing', '/', 'public', 'relations.Still', '1939', 'version', 'least', 'three', 'things', 'better', 'one', 'First', '25', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', '1957', 'singing', 'exercises', 'pupils', 'are', 'very', 'tedious', '.Second', 'greater', 'chemistry', 'Boyer', 'Dunne', 'subjectively', 'course', 'taking', 'merit', 'away', 'artistry', 'Grant', 'Kerr', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'example', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'wait', 'be', 'moved', 'final', 'scene', 'eyes', 'are', 'already', 'wet', 'when', 'Terry', 'back', 'hug', 'Michel', 'grandmother', 'goodbye', 'home', 'Madeira.And', 'third', '1939', 'film', 'just', 'real', 'hard', 'define', 'class', 'rings', 'more', 'genuine', 'emotion.', '34', 'Affair', 'Remember', '34', 'one', 'films', 'reputation', 'actuality', 'better', 'movie', 'know', 'notorious', 'tearjerker', 'sentimental', 'favorite', 'many', 'template', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'opinion', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'Tom', 'Hanks/Meg', 'Ryan', 'collaboration', 'still', 'like', 'one', 'may', 'well', 'find', '34', 'A', 'Love', 'Affair', '34', 'even', 'better', 'wonder', 'really', 'was', 'produced', '1939', 'alongside', 'such', 'great', 'movies', '34', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', '34', '34', 'Gone', 'Wind', '34', '34', 'Ninotchka', '34', 'French', 'gem', '34', 'Rules', 'Game', '34', 'directorial', 'class', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'check', '34', 'Night', 'Opera', '34', 'Marx', 'Brothers', '34', 'Awful', 'Truth', '34', 'combining', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'chemistry', 'even', '34', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', '34', '/', '34', 'Bells', 'St', 'Mary', '34', 'Bing', 'Crosby']",An Affair to Remember VHS

If she really loved him, how could she stay away?  Through that whole last part of this movie I kept asking my wife to explain it.  If it pride it was pretty stupid.

I already own the original starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, and love it, so this remake was acquired mainly out of curiosity. Distinct disappointment! Woefully wooden acting, especially on the part of the marvelous Cary Grant, who usually performs masterfully in any role. Deborah Kerr wholly lacking in Irene Dunne's warmth, charm and spontaniety, looking very lackluster throughout but giving a bit more to her role than her flat co-star.The sets and costumes monochrome, utilitarian in feel and lacking glamour. More specifically, I find myself wondering why he likes her, and why she likes him, and above all why I am sitting through this film. The production team is virtually the same, but alas, the times have changed. The collie dog outside the chapel door (if I'm not mistaken, actually the film star, Lassie) does give a superior performance to its counterpart's in the 1939 version... but how I miss Maria Ouspenskaya and 'Plaisir d'Amour' as sung by the talented Dunne!  Can but shake my head over all the good reviews on here.  This film for me is flawed and flat and slow-moving, lacking sparkle, lacking warmth. Almost as if nobody involved with it really took an interest.

Harmon ""animal lover""","[11, 11]","Since Deborah Kerr passed away last week, I feel compelled to write a review of this wonderful motion picture which, after more viewings than I can even count, remains in my top five alltime favorites.  Yes, the movie is corny.  Yes, it's mostly unbelievable.  What two people, so in love as Terry and Nicky, would promise to meet in six months and have absoloutely no contact with each other during the six months?  I like to think of it as a test of their love.  After all, they gained some depth of character while on the ship together.  I like to think that they wanted to see if the changes in themselves would last.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Nicky would not try to find Terry when she didn't show up atop the Empire State Building.  Yes, it's unbelievable that Terry would not tell Nicky why she wasn't there.  But, It's a movie, for goodness sakes.  And movies, at least for me, are about escapism.  They're not about the ""real world.""  They are a place I go to fantasize, to dream, to cry tears of happiness.  This classic love story gives me all of these 'places.' And it gives me so much more.  I only wish that those days were not long gone from the hills of Hollywood.Deborah kerr was 86 years old when she passed away last week.  But, to me, she will always be Terry McKay who, once upon a time on a cruise ship, fell in love with Nicky Ferrante and who, after going through hell, found her way back into his arms sitting on a couch beside a warm fireplace at Christmas time.",5,one of my top five,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,1491,"['Deborah', 'Kerr', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'week', 'feel', 'compelled', 'write', 'review', 'wonderful', 'motion', 'picture', 'more', 'viewings', 'can', 'even', 'count', 'top', 'five', 'alltime', 'favorites', 'Yes', 'movie', 'corny', 'Yes', 'mostly', 'unbelievable', 'What', 'two', 'people', 'so', 'love', 'Terry', 'Nicky', 'would', 'promise', 'meet', 'six', 'months', 'have', 'absoloutely', 'contact', 'other', 'six', 'months', 'like', 'think', 'test', 'love', 'gained', 'depth', 'character', 'ship', 'together', 'like', 'think', 'wanted', 'see', 'changes', 'would', 'last', 'Yes', 'unbelievable', 'Nicky', 'would', 'not', 'try', 'find', 'Terry', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'Yes', 'unbelievable', 'Terry', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'Nicky', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'movie', 'goodness', 'sakes', 'movies', 'least', 'are', 'escapism', ""'re"", 'not', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'place', 'go', 'fantasize', 'dream', 'cry', 'tears', 'happiness', 'classic', 'love', 'story', ""'places"", 'so', 'much', 'more', 'only', 'wish', 'days', 'were', 'not', 'long', 'gone', 'hills', 'Hollywood.Deborah', 'kerr', 'was', '86', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'week', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Terry', 'McKay', 'who', 'once', 'time', 'cruise', 'ship', 'fell', 'love', 'Nicky', 'Ferrante', 'who', 'going', 'hell', 'found', 'way', 'back', 'arms', 'sitting', 'couch', 'beside', 'warm', 'fireplace', 'Christmas', 'time']",An Affair to Remember VHS
256373,A142W8NH9SRXS0,6301586026,"Chay Chay Walker ""DVD and book reviewer""","[0, 0]","""An Affair to Remember"" is a classic love story between playboy Nickie Ferrante and singer Terry McKay. Nickie is engaged to an American heiress and Terry is the girlfriend of a tycoon. Because of their commitments to other people, they refuse to fall in love. After a visit to Nickie's grandmother and secret photographs of the couple are sold on the ship where they meet, Nickie and Terry finally accept that they are in love. However, they still have their past romantic companions to think of.They decide to break off the past romances, get jobs and meet at the Empire State Building in six months. Nickie tries to become a painter and Terry is continuing her singing career. Breaking up with their significant other is difficult for Nickie and Terry, but they manage to do it within the time limit. They both rush to the Empire State Building, trying to get to the 102nd floor. However, an accident prevents Terry from seeing her beloved again. Nickie does not hear about the accident and so feels angry and betrayed that he did not see Terry where they were supposed to meet.Six more months pass slowly for our pair of lovebirds. Terry cannot walk anymore, but a helpful priest gets her a job as a teacher for a children's choir. Nickie is continuing his painting career while trying to deal with the anger and hurt he feels because he didn't see Terry at the Empire State Building. On Christmas Day, he finds her address in the phone book and comes to visit her.Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant are a wonderful pair. I have seen many of Cary Grant's movies, but I have only seen Deborah Kerr in ""The King and I"" and that was when I was younger. It is so nice to see a redhead on the screen in either a classic or modern film.There are two singing numbers with the children. The kids are cute, especially the younger ones, but I question the point of the singing numbers. The first number might have been to tell us what Terry was doing, so then was the point of the second? Personally, my favorite scene was when Terry and Nickie were visiting Nickie's French grandmother. The old woman was such a delight and the scene mattered a lot to Nickie and Terry's romance.As both the title and this review can easily say, this movie is not for those who scoff at romance, because that's practically all that's in the story.

256377,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,6301586026,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[2, 2]","""An Affair to Remember"" is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic. And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera -- that person would be very, very wrong.Yes, the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream; her pert, pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fianc&eacute; on shore alone is worth the price of admission.Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection.Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened, that nothing was ever at stake, that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are.Kerr's amazing dresses -- how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front? -- Grant's suavity, and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera.All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work -- to tell a less than beautiful story.And, no, this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene -- you just have to be paying attention, and you just have to be mature enough, or have your antenna up high enough, to catch the subtle messages the film is sending, and to feel in your own solar plexus, the resonances of loves, dreams, and selves risked and gained, or lost.Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor; they speak in arch codes, even as their hearts are bleeding, or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams.Grant's character, Nicki Ferrante, is a lazy gigolo. ""Gigolo"" is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist, but he knows that he can market something else he does -- seduce women -- far more easily, and for a higher price, than he can get for his paintings.Kerr's character, Terry McKay, as she says, had to grow up very fast, and fight off a boss who -- well -- she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady, but less than thrilling, man offered to set her up, she, no fool, took the offer.These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money.And, then, completely by chance, on shipboard, they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears, and become their best selves.I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love, never mind soul mates, but this movie carries it all off so well, it makes me believe.Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest, and subtlest, of exchanges. they say things to each other -- example: ""I'd be surprised if you were surprised"" -- that, if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life -- would just go over your head.Slowly but surely their effervescent, and yet irresistible, attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou (Cathleen Nesbit) is amazing for all it says, without actually saying anything.I could see a naive film-goer taking in that scene and then asking, ""What was the point of that scene?"" You really have to have your eyes on the screen, and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom; whose face is suddenly hidden and why; who is saying what without actually saying it; and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears -- you have to be willing to pay attention, and to have a sense of life and human relationships, and, yes, an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene.Here you have a man and a woman who have, basically, sold themselves to the highest bidder, and who, at that point, are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff.""We changed our course today."" Truer words were never spoken.I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey, who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning ""Going My Way."" He so wonderfully brings the best, and most complex, aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages -- French, Italian -- and it also is friendly to this kind of romance -- a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous, redemptive, overwhelming, fated love that demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie, or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry.

256378,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6301586026,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[9, 10]","I have read a previous review on here bemoaning the quality of the image on this Blu-ray; guaging the period in which this film was released and the instability of the film stock (3 strip Technicolor was long gone), the High-Def version on this disc is probably the best this movie is going to look. There is also quite a bit of process photography going on in this film, which also does very little for a high-quality detailed image. Mixed all together, it is somewhat unfair to expect a movie from 1957 to look as good as a current movie or even an older movie that hails its source from a Technicolor negative. That  being said...I am personally very happy with the way the movie appeared on my home theater system. The sound is not extremely dynamic or jarring, but the lush orchestration and witty dialogue is clean and crisp and makes for a more than pleasant experience.The story will tear at your heart strings; although not necessarily the most innovative premise, it succeeds because of the perfect chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Their subtle comedic timing and ways with a line keep the movie from getting overly sentimental or trite. There is the perfect mix of comedy and pathos. Their characters meet aboard a luxury liner, and both are in loveless relationships that have allowed them to live a complacent (you could substitute the word ""kept"") lifestyle. Reawakening their passions not only about each other but their lives and artistic talents, the two part from their cruise vowing to make it possible to be reunited in 6 months once they sort their lives out. That is as far as I'll go on the plot line.The highlights of the film include a visit to Grant's character's grandmother's home. She is a wise woman  nearing the end of her life, and expertly played by Cathleen Nesbitt. It is her wisdom and desire for Grant and Kerr to be together that helps the two see what a vibrant life they could have together. The low points are few, but they do exist, particularly in the musical numbers towards the end where Kerr's character is a music teacher for children. These scenes are really dated and somewhat stereotypical. They slow the pace of the movie down somewhat.This blu-ray set comes in a Digibook case with a beautifully illustrated 26 page book with background info on the movie and the stars. The extras are wonderful, too:* Commentary by Singer Marni Nixon and Film Historian Joseph McBride: The commentary is mainly from McBride, but there are a number of times where Nixon jumps in to discuss her relationship with Deborah Kerr and how she prepared herself to dub Kerr's singing voice for the movie, as well as dubbing Kerr for the foreign versions. McBride's comments are very informative and interesting as well. Worth listening to.* Featurette: Affairs to Remember - Deborah Kerr (5:32 480i): Details Kerr's unhappy marriage that she was suffering through while making this movie and the love she found with her next husband.* Featurette: Affairs to Remember - Cary Grant (9:47 480i): This one discusses Grant's love for Sophia Loren after they had an affair during the previous movie they made together. Grant was already married, but that didn't deter him from pursuing Loren, even though she went back to Carlo Ponti after they completed the movie.Both star's unfulfilled romances most likely added to the poignancy of the story they were playing out for the cameras.* Featurette: Directed by Leo McCarey (22:33 480i): Not necessarily a name remembered today, the man was responsible for some of the most beloved comedies by Laurel & Hardy and the Marx Brothers. This is a short look back at his career and how important it was for him to make a comeback with this particular movie.* Featurette: A Producer to Remember: Jerry Wald (15:59 480i): One of the hardest working men in the biz, his family fondly remembers how would alternate between making ""money"" movies and ""arty"" (or more redeeming) pictures. A master of publicity, he knew how to pick movies with great stories and scripts.* Featurette: The Look of Affair to Remember (8:53 480i): Discussing the colors (such as the orange palette of Kerr's clothing), settings, and processes used to make this film to give it the dreamy and artificial look that it has.* AMC Backstory Episode: ""An Affair to Remember"" ( 24:27 480i ): A look back at the production of the movie, with some duplication of info from the other featurettes shown here. Still very enjoyable. Interesting that Cary Grant was initially upset about 2 things on this movie: the New York Empire State Building being swapped out for San Francisco for the climactic ending and also the fact that the movie was being filmed on a soundstage and not overseas on location. Grant won out on 1 out of the two gripes!* Movietone Newsreel (Shipboard Premiere) ( :56 480i )* Trailer (2:53 480i)You'd have to be a total Scrooge not to enjoy this film today. The extras enhance the experience, making this a must-have set for film buffs!",5,Perfect chemistry & a classy set,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,4997,"['have', 'read', 'previous', 'review', 'here',

I looked all over the internet for an answer as to why this was not displayed in this movie, but I could not find the answer. It really was very unnatural, especially at the end of the movie, when these two characters, who are so in love with each other, and finally are committed to each other for life, are filled with emotion of love, do not kiss lip to lip.Also, it was very obvious and also awkward to not show their kiss on the boat, on the stairs.

The pair soon become acquainted and their friendship blooms into romance.They agree to meet at the top of the Empire State Building six months from then, provided they still feel the same way about each other. However, through a tragic series of events, their romance seems doomed forever.The film boasts stellar performances from Grant as a lovable playboy finally wishing to settle down with his ideal woman; Kerr is particularly engaging in the second half of the film regarding what has happened to their relationship.The film glides by seemlessly and without a moment of boredom as the viewer hopes for a happy ending. It is not however, the thought that everything could go wrong for the couple; but rather the way in which this is presented in terms of character, plot and narrative.

256385,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301586026,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","Directed by Leo McCarey (The Awful Truth), this overly revered 1957 romantic tearjerker has always felt bloated at 115 minutes given the slight story presented and repackaged by McCarey and co-scenarists Mildred Cram, Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart. The fact remains that the veteran director told the same tale in just 87 minutes back in1939, and the extra half-hour feels like pure padding in the update. Moreover, the sentimental wash of the love story feels even more contrived on the grander scale of a full-color CinemaScope production. You certainly couldn't ask for stars more luminous than Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr at this point in Hollywood history, but their charms can only go so far in sustaining interest in their characters' burgeoning romance.The familiar story goes like this. Traveling alone on a transatlantic ocean liner, playboy bon vivant Nickie Ferrante is trying to avoid public glare over his recent engagement to a prominent New York socialite. Onboard, he meets comely nightclub singer Terry McKay, who is also engaged and also traveling alone. The pair strikes sparks quickly, but a combination of guilt and gossipmongers keeps the would-be lovers apart. Things change considerably when they visit Nickie's kindly grandmother at one of the ports-o-call, and Terry sees his more sensitive side under the elderly woman's becalming influence. Needing to attend to their impending marriages, Nickie and Terry vow to reunite on top of the Empire State Building in six months' time. As anyone who has seenSleepless in Seattleknows, fate intervenes, and their lives take a different route than either expected.Grant is on cruise control as Nickie, exhibiting his debonair manner with easy assurance. His big moment of revelation in the final scene is the only time Grant shows something deeper in the character than a suave lover and a frustrated artist. As Terry, Kerr stands in the considerable shadow of Irene Dunne, whose natural &eacute;lan and sparkling wit elevated the original to classic status. Another key difference is that while Dunne exhibited her own impressive singing talents, Kerr's voice is dubbed by Marni Nixon on Terry's two nightclub numbers. Still, Kerr manages to convey enough of her character's sharp sensibilities and romantic vulnerability, and the chemistry with Grant is very much in evidence here. Cathleen Nesbitt plays the Maria Ouspenskaya role of Grandmother Janou with twinkly, wizened charm, the same valedictory role Katharine Hepburn played in Warren Beatty's inferior1994 remake. The rest of the supporting cast is purely incidental with special mention going to the avuncular Charles Watts playing an obnoxious passenger who follows the illicit pair without remorse.The 2008 two-disc 50th Anniversary Edition DVD package seems excessive for anyone but the film's most devout fans. Disc One contains a pristine print of the film along with a perfunctory commentary track from film historian Joseph McBride with additional comments from Nixon, who shares her personal memories of the production. Disc Two has a number of featurettes starting with a pair of retrospective featurettes, one on Kerr, the other on Grant. Just before his death, screenwriter Peter Viertel reminisces about his wife Kerr, while Grant's widow Barbara does the same. The featurette on McCarey is more interesting in that it shows colleagues and film critics contributing their insight to his impressive body of work. Other shorts focus on producer Jerry Wald and the film's cinematography courtesy of Milton R. Krasner. The best extra is an AMC Backstory documentary on the film's production and legacy. Completing the package is vintage newsreel footage as well as a couple of photo galleries.

256386,A2TV6SBCWT7P8S,6301586026,ehakus,"[9, 21]","I can't quite figure out why so many people absolutely adore this movie. Perhaps it is simply because I am not a fan of tearjerkers at all - instead of making me cry, they make me just want to turn them off. But, if you are a fan of that type of film, this would be the ultimate film to watch. No other romance can quite equal the charm of this movie, and even though it is not my style of movie, I can recognize that it is the best of its kind.Essentially, An Affair to Remember is about an irresponsible ladies man (Cary Grant, at his most charming) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful, sincere woman (Deborah Kerr) on a boat. It describes their subsequent romance, complete with many shipboard scenes, the famous Empire State scene, and &quot;heartbreaking&quot; events. The last scene is famous for making people cry - although I personally didn't - it is a very emotional scene.Anyhow, even though as a rule I detest tearjerkers, the fact that I tolerate this movie, and even think it is somewhat good in parts, shows that it is really a good movie for people who enjoy romances/tearjerkers. Mainly, this is because of the fantastic stars, the glamorous and handsome Cary Grant (so talented he makes it all look so easy) and beautiful Deborah Kerr. This movie is also very innocent and has no inappropriate material, unlike some similar movies that are made now. So, I would say that if you enjoy what I consider &quot;sappy&quot; romances or tearjerkers, this would surely be the movie for you.

256389,A308X3FITWLF7W,6301586026,"Elvin Ortiz ""CurlyAl34""","[1, 1]","Although directed by McCarey, this film can't compare to his original Love Affair. Grant and Kerr, albeit their good acting, seem to be trying to imitate the gestures of the actors in the original film. It seems that McCarey wanted to repeat the film in the exact manner as in the original.Secondly, the scene where the leading lady prays to the virgin has a better effect in the first film. The Virgin looks quite impressive, and the light shining upon the woman lends her a powerful image of redemption for the millionaire playboy. The room and the light both give that scene a mystical quality that explains why the playboy would change. The light also shines on Irene Dunne which connects her to the mystical qualities of Michel's religion, the devotion of his mother, and his cultural background. The use of light and shadow (perhaps a quality of German Expressionism) in this scene can explain a change of heart in Michel.  In the Grant/Kerr picture this scene loses that power. It seems as if the color version steals the emotional depth of this scene. In this film, the room looks too ordinary and the virgin is only a small image on a table. The use of color also takes away the color effects of the earlier scene. Other scenes where Affair to Remember have a weaker effect on the audience are: the part when the lady looks at the Empire State Building (it looks so much smaller); the part where the leading lady is singing in the restaurant (Kerr couldn't match the dynamism of the original actress); and the picture painted in this latter film was less impressive than the original one where the woman's shroud was stressed.I think that the Grant/Kerr presence made them, the stars, the major attraction, making everything else less important in this film. It was as if McCarey repeated this film for the sake of having these two great stars working in this romantic tale.

256395,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6301586026,Haunted Flower,"[3, 3]","""An Affair to Remember"" is said to be number 5 out of the top 100 romantic movies of all time by AFI. That's a pretty big claim and having never seen this film before, I really was curious if it would live up to the hype. This film has been referenced in the movie ""Sleepless in Seattle"" where Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan eventually met at the top of the Empire State Building and more recently in the TV Show, ""How I Met Your Mother"" where a tactic out of Barney Stinson's playbook is to go up to women at the top of the Empire State Building and say, ""He's not coming."" It's worth dusting this one off in your memory and watching it again and I dare say I might have a little old school crush on 1957 Cary Grant.The Blu-ray disc is housed in a collectible book format, a very thin case, great if you need the storage space in your collection. Built into the case is 24 pages of images and stories from the film and behind the scenes of the film and personal lives of the actors, director, and producer. It is easy to see when the actors are on a sound stage versus a location, but the lighting and costumes are fantastic and the performances are so engrossing that those tiny details won't matter so much. The Blu-ray keeps the picture clean and crisp with the focus always on faces.The premise is that two people have a chance meeting on a ship and have an instant attraction to each other. Nickie, played by Cary Grant, is a world traveling playboy engaged to a wealthy heiress and can't stop looking at other women, but is particularly intrigued by this woman who doesn't fall immediately to his charms and turns him down. Terry, played by Deborah Kerr, is an uptown English woman raised in Boston, a former night club singer, and has been groomed to be a good wife to her nice guy husband-to-be who wanted to take her away from her former life and put her in a penthouse. Nickie and Terry keep bumping into each other and when others on the ship begin to notice, they eventually give up the charade of indifference and spend some precious few moments together. They agree that if they are meant to be together, they should meet in six months on the Empire State building.  I won't spoil the ending (which has already been spoiled if you've seen ""Sleepless in Seattle"") but I'll just say that while I didn't actually cry, my heart did swell up for the both of them.The film itself still holds up amazingly well. Today we might scoff at the creative pursuits both leads attempt to make themselves worthy of each other apart from their rich significant others, but it still doesn't stop it from being endearing. It's unrealistic for Nickie to succeed as a painter under a fake name and Terry as a singer, but through goodwill, hope, and persistence, they make it happen despite bumps in the road. If I had to change one thing about this film, I would nix the kids. Terry's career takes a hit after an unfortunate incident and she decides to ""coach"" a children's singing group and they are a little annoying and could stand to go.Bonus Features:There are featurettes on both lead actors. Deborah Kerr's is from her husband's point of view. He had been previously married and she had been in a relationship when the two met and they eventually married and spent four decades together and he talks about how she was a model wife and mother. Cary Grant's is from his widow's point of view and once again, he and his future wife were both in relationships with other people when they met as well. She put off his advances at first and eventually realized he was interested in her. He was married four times before marrying Barbara Harris who was 47 years younger than him. They only had five years of marriage before he passed away.There's also a feature on director Leo McCarey whose films were nominated for 36 Oscars and won 3. He had an amazing and tumultuous personal life before going into Hollywood. ""An Affair to Remember"" was actually a remake of a previous film he had done called ""Love Affair."" Then there's a featurette on the producer, Jerry Wald, a great storyteller. Last there are several short featurettes on the look of the film with lighting, set pieces, and making a sound stage feel intimate and concentrate on the actors. The AMC backstory talks about the impact this film had a pop culture, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and the background of Cary Grant being in love with Sophia Loren while being married to Betsy Drake and having a short affair she ended and he attempted to continue during the film.All in all, a well-done collector's Blu-ray of a wonderful timeless romance in a thoughtfully thin book case to better fit

256429,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6301586026,Marty Gillis,"[27, 30]","'An Affair to Remember' is a classic film and another great collaboration between Cary Grant and ace director Leo McCarey.  As a huge Cary Grant fan this film on Blu Ray was simply a must for my collection and the film itself has many fans worldwide. With that said, this review will focus mainly on the video and audio quality of the presentation and not the content of the film itself.Is this 1080p presentation with DTS HD Master Audio sound a worthy step up from the DVD and should you really consider double dipping? Read on!Let me start by saying this Blu Ray release is absolutely the BEST version currently available for home video. It easily bests all previous releases, VHS, Laser Disc and various DVD versions. If you are a fan of Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr or the film itself then upgrading is truly a no brainer and I totally recommend that you do so.I personally purchased this film with the Blu Ray Book packaging and it is very nice. The text is more glossy and less informative than I would have liked, but the photos themselves are also glossy and that is a plus.  Slightly different artwork adorns both the front cover and disc image and it feels solid and well worth any price under twenty dollars.  The disc itself sits in a strange cardboard holder within the book which for some may be a slight challenge to remove until you get the hang of it. Replacing it after viewing is much easier. (it is nowhere near as difficult to remove as say the new Star Wars packaging makes things)I have read many online reviews regarding the image quality of this Blu Ray release.  As much as I enjoyed the film on Blu Ray and as good as it looks, I will have to disagree with many reviewers and say this is nowhere near as 'perfect' as I had hoped it would be.My two MAIN complaints have to do with black level/brightness and DNR.  I have read many top reviews that say this title had no DNR applied to it.  I respectfully disagree and can not for the life of me believe that this is anywhere near the detail you would have seen on film. While closeups are at a premium in this movie, you just never truly see much facial detail.  While fine detail seems to be mostly obscured, I will say in the transfers favor that digital noise has been all but obliterated leaving us with a nice slick looking picture.  Don't get me wrong, this is very good effort for the most part, but I am picky and I expected MORE.  During the cleaner scenes in 'Charade' for instance, you will find WAY MORE fine detail in the picture. On the other hand, 'An Affair to Remember' boasts a more even transfer with less distractions from bad looking scenes and obvious print damage or transfer artifacts.After doing a bit of research I have found that most early CinemaScope films suffered from what is called CinemaScope or Anamorphic ""mumps"" (google it) and as such portions of the image will always be distorted, both the focus and geometry. Apparently it took the advent of a competing widescreen process ""Panavision"" in 1958 to force CinemaScope into perfecting their lenses and techniques so that these annoying were minimized. But as things sat in 1957 , CinemaScope produced some very annoying artifacts that upon close inspection just MIGHT drive you nuts.  Check out any parallel lines on either side of the frame, or watch what happens when Cary or another actor movies to the center of the screen. You will soon see why this phenomenon is known as the CinemaScope Mumps.......It is not a transfer error, but an unfortunate by-product of the early widescreen process. Also, SOME of the lack of detail in this transfer can be attributed to the actual CinemaScope process, widely known to not provide the most detailed renderings.Speaking of the print itself, it is for the most part pretty darn pristine.  There are a few instances of telecine wobble/film warping which are most noticeable during the 'Toast"" sequence with Cary's ""grandmother"".  I also detected at least one instances of a couple of missing frames towards the end of the film when Cary is having his final conversation with Miss Kerr in her characters apartment. None of these aberrations are deal breakers and come and go so quickly it is very likely most will never notice them. Unfortunately for me I watch the first time with a critical eye, then afterward for enjoyment. The other thing that bothered me about the video was simply put, a slightly washed out contrast/brightness. Many have written the contrast is spot on, but I have to again respectfully disagree. My display was recently calibrated and what I see is lack of black and a bit too much 'bright' in the transfer overall. A little more care in the mastering process could have easily eliminated this.  Of course this also means you will find NO instances at all of black crush, which is nice, but then again I challenge anyone to find absolute black in this either. Color is fine, by Deluxe so although not as pleasing as Technicolor is (at least to my eyes) it is pretty good. In fact, overall color levels and hues are a very strong point on this disc and unlike 'North by Northwest' on Blu, the colors never never look totally unnatural or out of whack.I have mentioned in a few of my earlier reviews that the films of Cary Grant just don't seem to get much respect as far as their Blu Ray presentations go. I am beginning to suspect that the reason Humphrey Bogart's films are so much better looking has much to do with the care the negatives were shown over the years by Warner Brothers.  Cary just didn't fare as well in regards to the studios he worked for as far as keeping the negatives of his films in tip top shape.STILL, I will say right now that THIS transfer is the overall best for any Cary Grant movie currently in Blu Ray release. I am really keeping my fingers crossed that the upcoming release of 'To Catch a Thief' on Blu next month will make me eat my words and blow me away.(UPDATE 2-18-12  Just watched 'To Catch a Thief' on Blu Ray and it DID totally blow me away which means it now holds the top spot for the best Hi Def Cary Grant transfer available, pushing 'An Affair to Remember' down to #2, at least in my opinion.  My advice it to purchase both and make your own decision)The sound on this disc is quite good actually. YOU get both a DTS HD Master audio 5.1 mix and a Stereo Mix. I was a bit disappointed the original MONO was not included as a lossless option, but was surprised to find the 5.1 mix was very pleasing overall.  Some of the musical numbers were tied to dialogue and could not be separated into stereo, but almost all the score is. The surrounds come in to play for both ambiance and various effects such as birds chirping, etc. Overall the DTS HD Master mix was very good and never took me 'out' of the film with phoney baloney surround activity or odd panning, shrieking musical passages or inaudible dialogue.  I liked it.  A 1957 film with a decent surround track is a pretty good accomplishment I think.Extras are plentiful and many are very good. You get 4 shortish, and 3 Medium length featurettes, the films trailer and a nice AMC Backstory special which I found particularly good.  All of the special features have been ported over from the DVD release and are presented in 480i.Cary Grant is at the very top of my short list of favorite movie stars. To me, he was and always will remain the King. I have enjoyed purchasing and watching all his films as they have been released and no more so than when they have appeared in high definition on Blu Ray. This film is no exception. With all my complaints, OCD observations and niggles, it is truly a very good overall presentation and one that is guaranteed to please most every fan of this film or the actors within it.

His acting is timeless, the last scene when he discovers who owns his ""best"" painting is classic, no actor today can match this response, he says volumes as he stands in the open door, his face registering a thousand unspoken words, then turns to return to Kerr with the answer to all the questions she refused to address.  He moves like a dancer with a fluid grace that is amazing to watch, he glides rather than walks and has an confident eloquence few actors can achieve.  Cary Grant movies lack the ""face sucking"", open-mouth, jaws-like kisses movie makers and lesser actors need today to translate ""romance"" into a movie but Grant exudes more sexual attraction and heart-warming romance than them all.  He and Kerr play well off each other in this movie, it doesn't come up to the electrified chemistry with Ingrid Bergman in Notorious--but that's a movie in a class by itself.

Of course, those who know Sleepless In Seattle realise that a lot of its story comes straight out of An Affair To Remember! Although I like both stories, An Affair to Remember has more depth than Sleepless. The sophistication of Cary Grant with the devil-may-care attitude makes a lot of the movie and the twist with the love of a woman who never turns up for their date, months after they have met. It is a good story!The disc itself is great too. The picture quality on Blu-Ray is very good and majority is very sharp.

256448,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6301586026,Nix Pix,"[4, 4]","Director, Leo McCarey's remake of his own ""Love Affair"" is a masterful attempt to update a classic for the post war generation.  Yet, regardless of whether you see the original or its remake, this ""An Affair To Remember"", the net result of your cinematic experience is ultimately slated to turn out the same - bring Kleenex!Cary Grant is Nicky Ferranti, a big time 'dame' hunter who is all set to marry an heiress when he falls, but hard, for Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr), the park avenue play-thing of a wealthy New York financier.  As in the original, McKay and Ferranti discover that love may not be enough to keep their dreams alive, particularly after one of them suffers a tragic accident that alters the course for both their futures.This is the sort of grand romantic melodramatic canvas on which such broad, yet stirring, brush strokes have been painted,  that one can not help but become emotionally involved.  Yes, there are several musical numbers (a shame since they're neither visually appealing, nor do they advance the story) and yes, the material is heavily dated.  But there must be something to this movie - still a tear jerker forty-five years later.When Fox Home Video first issued this movie on DVD it was widescreen but not enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  There was a considerable amount of film and digital grit and colors, though dated throughout, seemed excessively garish. There was also some slight edge enhancement and aliasing detected.I am happy to say that most of these anomolies have been corrected, providing us with a much smoother looking, color consistant transfer that is a marked improvement over the previous DVD.  This one is also anamorphic.While fine film grain and dirt and scratches in the original print are still present, this time around, they are not obtrusive to the eye.The soundtrack on this disc is virtually identical to the previously released DVD.  At times it has a nice spread. But this is the very same, dumbed down, Dolby Surround mix that was imported from Fox's original laserdisc, instead of being  rematrixed to a 5.1 track.

The 50th Anniversary of this film will remind us all of the innocent times of yesteryear.  Romantic and cute, the first part played on an ocean liner. Playboy, Nicki Ferrante, meets the woman he is fated to fall in love with, Terry McKay. They meet, discover they like each other and this turns to love. They visit Nicki's grandmother in France, and this scene is the one we remember. An overly romantic day filled with memories of a loved one and the sweet times ahead.Finally realizing that they love each other, but have other people in their lives, they make a decision. They decide to meet each other at the Empire State Building in 6 months. Nicki needs to find a job, he has never had a full time job to support himself, never mind a wife.  Nicki starts painting and Terry goes back to singing. The day arrives and...""The hook comes almost exactly at the halfway point, and while that's the thing most people remember about the film, it also marks the start of its downhill slide."" says Peter Harris. Terry has an accident and is transported to the hospital. Nicki waits at the Empire State Building until midnight. Why didn't they communicate? Is this a case of not knowing each other well? And for six months they lived on faith, but at this crucial moment, no one calls the other?  Far fetched, yes.  But we know that true lovers will find each other and, of course, that does occur.Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are two of the actors of old Hollywood. The romantic and innocent era of love. This is the 50th anniversary of the film, and it comes at a time when romance and innocence are at a low ebb.Lovely music sung by Vic Damone.

What we have here is a shipboard romance that both Holland America and Carnival Lines know better than to promise prospective passengers. Cary Grant stars as a pre-Jet Set playboy on the verge of a marriage of convenience. Deborah Kerr stars as a former lounge singer who's met &quot;Mr. Right&quot; in the form of a patron where she used to sing. It's a bit unsubtle the way we know that both upcoming marriages are &quot;the right thing to do&quot; very early on. That is, until Grant and Kerr meet on the ship. Grant plays the debonair role we came to expect of him over the years, while Kerr's earnest performance and wholesome beauty remind us that Meryl Streep did not invent character acting. Robert Q Lewis is forgettable in a cameo as a previous-generation Robin Leach type, but Cathleen Nesbitt shines as Grant's subtly-matchmaking French grandmother, a role pleasantly similar to her later role in the '60s TV series &quot;The Farmer's Daughter&quot;. Neva Patterson is predictable as Grant's too-glamorous fiancee, but Richard Denning is impressive as Kerr's--a standup guy who may have lost her hand, but he evidently believes in Robert Heinlein's definition of love--when another person's well-being is essential to your own.

256472,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6301586026,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[0, 0]","Leo McCarey's 1957 remake of his 1939Love Affairstars Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr as two completely different people who end up falling in love on a transatlantic cruise. Nickie Ferrante (Grant) is a smooth-talking playboy who has a new girl every night, but his free reign as a bachelor is coming to an end as he's about to marry millionaire Lois Clark. Terry McKay is a nightclub singer in Boston and is in a long-term relationship. Nickie pursues Terry, who at first refuses, but the two fall deeply in love aboard the SS Constitution and try to hide their blossoming romance from curious onlookers and the ship's photographer. Nickie takes Terry to meet his octogenarian grandmother during a shore leave, and Terry is deeply attracted to the peaceful haven overlooking the Mediterranean.When they arrive in New York, they agree that they'll meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building; this will give Nickie time to save up money for a wedding, and for Terry to break the news to her fianc&eacute;. But on their six-month anniversary, fate intervenes and all does not go as planned.An Affair to Remember is practically a carbon copy of Love Affair, with the addition of Technicolor and the theme song sung by Vic Damone. Grant and Kerr have a crackling energy and sparkling repartee that make them a joy to root for (both actors did their share of ad libbing). Some of the scenes, particularly those of Terry teaching a children's choir, felt like unabashed filler (and some modern viewers find the tap dance scene by the only two African-American kids in the choir to be racially offensive). Bonus features include an audio commentary by film critic Joseph McBride and Marni Nixon, the singing voice of Terry McKay, profiles of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, bios of director McCarey and producer Jerry Wald, a featurette on the look of An Affair to Remember, and a 25-minute AMC backstory of the filming. There's also a poster and stills gallery to peruse.

Short answer: a resounding NO!  What they (whoever they are) did was take a movie classic that millions love and that, as Deborah Kerr says,  ""people watch every six months to have a good cry,"" and bury it in blather.Here's what's on disc two: 1. A few minutes of  the Widow Grant talking about her love affair with Cary in the most  unrevealing way imaginable.  2. A few minutes of screenwriter Peter Viertel, Kerr's second husband, talking about how their love affair broke up Kerr's first marriage, then inferring that he played around during their 30 years together and she put up with it because ""she was a saint."" 3. Endless minutes of  Peter Bogdanovich and an all male bunch of  academic talking heads blathering on about the life and works of  director Leo McCarey, who also played around and was an alcoholic and  whose suavity was said to be the inspiration for  Cary Grant's screen personna.  4.  Jerry Wald's brother and sons with a  bio of  the  producer.  5. The return of the blathering academics  to dissect the look of the movie. 6. Newsreel clips from the premiere and  TA DA!...7. the only interesting and professional-looking  piece on the entire bonus  disc: an AMC ""Backstory"" feature which you may well have already seen on TV and which dishes some interesting dirt accompanied by decent visuals.Having wasted my ears on disc 2 before trying out the commentary track on disc 1, I was admittedly blathered out and it didn't help that the film historian-commentator early on started  getting some plot points wrong.  But what pushed me to the ""off"" button was his anecdote about meeting Cary Grant after Grant's retirement and introducing himself by saying (oh barf) ""I come to you with a message from the women of America: they want you to return to the screen,"" to which good old Cary replied, ""What did you do, take a poll?""You'll note that they waited to release the 50th anniversary edition of this 1957 movie until 2008. I suspect the reason is they had to wait for all the principals to be dead (Kerr and Viertel died in the fall of '07) before they could get away with producing a tribute that's  so on-the-cheap and unworthy.Ah,  how I would have loved to read Nora Ephron's take on this debacle.As the British radio guy says in his sign-off at the beginning of the movie: ""Well....there you have it.""",4,"4 stars for the movie, 1 star for the ""special edition"" extras",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,2623,"['review', 'already', 'know', 'movie', 'possibly', 'heart', 'now', 'are', 'wondering', 'love', 'affair', 'Affair', 'Remember', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition', 'commentary', 'track', 'mysterious', 'unexplained', 'page', 'least', 'second', 'disc', 'Short', 'answer', 'resounding', 'NO', 'What', 'are', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'movie', 'classic', 'millions', 'love', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'people', 'watch', 'six', 'months', 'have', 'good', 'cry', 'bury', 'blather.Here', 'what', 'disc', 'two', '1', 'few', 'minutes', 'Widow', 'Grant', 'talking', 'love', 'affair', 'Cary', 'most', 'unrevealing', 'way', 'imaginable', '2', 'few', 'minutes', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Viertel', 'Kerr', 'second', 'husband', 'talking', 'how', 'love', 'affair', 'broke', 'up', 'Kerr', 'first', 'marriage', 'then', 'inferring', 'played', 'around', '30', 'years', 'together', 'put', 'up', 'was', 'saint', '3', 'Endless', 'minutes', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'male', 'bunch', 'academic', 'talking', 'heads', 'blathering', 'life', 'works', 'director', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'suavity', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'screen', 'personna', '4', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'brother', 'sons', 'bio', 'producer', '5', 'return', 'blathering', 'academics', 'dissect', 'look', 'movie', '6', 'Newsreel', 'clips', 'premiere', 'TA', 'DA', '7', 'only', 'interesting', 'professional-looking', 'piece', 'entire', 'bonus', 'disc', 'AMC', 'Backstory', 'feature', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'TV', 'interesting', 'dirt', 'accompanied', 'decent', 'visuals.Having', 'wasted', 'ears', 'disc', '2', 'trying', 'out', 'commentary', 'track', 'disc', '1', 'was', 'admittedly', 'blathered', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'historian-commentator', 'early', 'started', 'getting', 'plot', 'points', 'wrong', 'what', 'pushed', 'button', 'was', 'anecdote', 'meeting', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Grant', 'retirement', 'introducing', 'saying', 'oh', 'barf', 'come', 'message', 'women', 'America', 'want', 'return', 'screen', 'good', 'old', 'Cary', 'replied', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'take', 'poll', ""'ll"", 'note', 'waited', 'release', '50th', 'anniversary', 'edition', '1957', 'movie', '2008', 'suspect', 'reason', 'had', 'wait', 'principals', 'be', 'dead', 'Kerr', 'Viertel', 'died', 'fall', ""'07"", 'could', 'get', 'away', 'producing', 'tribute', 'so', 'on-the-cheap', 'unworthy.Ah', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'read', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'take', 'British', 'radio', 'guy', 'sign-off', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Well', '.there', 'have']",An Affair to Remember VHS
