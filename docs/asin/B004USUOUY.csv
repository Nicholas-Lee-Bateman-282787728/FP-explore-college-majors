1428519,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B004USUOUY,Carter,"[0, 0]","Here's a wonderful film involving small incidents but really about big things. Based on Athol Fugard's play set in 1950s apartheid South Africa, the film focuses on the relationship between a middle class white family, especially the young son Hally, and two life-long black servants, Sam and Willie. Against the backdrop of a racism-based feudal system, ordinary individuals like Mom and Dad succumb to the lewd social conventions of a corrupt system while a select few, like Hally, dream of a better world. But when generations of the system's social conditioning threaten to corrupt even Hally's innate sense of right and wrong, he must make a momentous choice--a task a bit unfair for his young age--between allegiance to his enlightened sense of social justice (as well as to Sam and Willie) and the psychological temptations of the repressive and condescending attitudes of the morally bankrupt society around him. Fugard explores nothing less than human nature and the institutions humans create and the question of whether it is individuals or institutions that are evil. But rather than a scholarly tome on larger political and social ideas, ""Master Harold"" introduces us to anonymous characters and their ordinary day-to-day interactions to show us the insidious ways that generational and institutional racism, backed by the state and with an iron fist, reinforces and preserves itself by perverting the values of people, young and old, living within the institution. Fugard, at one time persecuted by his own South African Government, wants nevertheless to tell us that he's not given up on human nature, and that it is through the triumph of personal decency, learning, and self-respect that individuals begin to break the shackles of an immoral system. The theory though doesn't become a reality unless people believe in it, and Fugard's challenge is to make the viewer believe. This he does masterfully with Sam and the power of personal example. Though he's spent a lifetime in a system encouraging whites to unload their personal frustrations and resentments on unsuspecting and innocent blacks, it's Sam's commanding demeanor--forceful, eloquent, self-respecting, and forgiving--which convinces us that long-held attitudes and animosities can be changed IF an individual wants to change them. As for institutions, individuals create them. When individuals aspire to decency, their institutions follow--first comes personal growth, then social growth, then institutional reform. All wide-spread social reform starts as personal choice in our own backyard.  Agent changes structure. As Sam says, ""Without the dream we won't know what we're going for.""  When you see evil, you have to ""stand up and walk away from it.""  It's important to be reminded of that, especially in a modern world where leviathans dominate and individuals feel increasingly powerless.

Although Apartheid is dismantledin the country of South Africa, episodes in this DVD shall enhance appreciation forthe end of Apartheid.  However, there is another theme in this DVD which is worthy of equalattention which is the hardships of a young white lad coming of age with a dysfunctionalparent - a father who is a chronic alcoholic.  Freddie Highmore, like other films, displaysthe epitome of a superb actor who can adjust to any role, and, it is a heartbreaking one asMaster Harold. Despite berating incidents by his peers who use the excuse of an alcoholicFather as a cloak for their jealousies of his exceptional achievements in school, Master Haroldcontinues to excel. The tragic ending is clear: In the Movie, there is one incident after anotherin which an alcoholic Father publicly embarrassed Master Harold over the years. The Mother ofMaster Harold repeatedly attempts to make the best of each incident.  At the ending of theMovie, Master Harold vents his frustrations improperly on the Black employees. At the conclusion,the viewer is left to wonder how present matters will be resolved as Master Harold rides away on hisbicycle to go home.

1428521,A3ANW2FJ7SZQ95,B004USUOUY,"Jim Ross ""JimboJim""","[3, 4]","I recently saw the stage play in San Francisco in an intimate 50-seat theatre, the perfect venue for the powerful 3-actor play.  The movie stays faithful to the play throughout, adding only some minimal scenes that fill in some of the back story contained in the play's dialogue.  Filming it on location in Cape Town was therefore a good idea to lend an air of authenticity.  The actors in this movie filling the play's roles of Hallie, Sam, and Willie are top-knotch, playing their roles with the required sensitivity. The movie lacks the power & punch of the stage play, which I think can only be properly conveyed from the stage, but it got as close as can be expected.  If you can't see the play, this movie is a reasonably good alternative.",4,"Not quite as good as the play, but likely about as good as a movie version can get",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,745,"['recently', 'saw', 'stage', 'play', 'San', 'Francisco', 'intimate', '50-seat', 'theatre', 'perfect', 'venue', 'powerful', '3-actor', 'play', 'movie', 'faithful', 'play', 'adding', 'only', 'minimal', 'scenes', 'fill', 'back', 'story', 'contained', 'play', 'dialogue', 'Filming', 'location', 'Cape', 'Town', 'was', 'therefore', 'good', 'idea', 'lend', 'air', 'authenticity', 'actors', 'movie', 'filling', 'play', 'roles', 'Hallie', 'Sam', 'Willie', 'are', 'top-knotch', 'playing', 'roles', 'required', 'sensitivity', 'movie', 'power', 'punch', 'stage', 'play', 'think', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'properly', 'conveyed', 'stage', 'got', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'play', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'good', 'alternative']",Master Harold... and the Boys
1428522,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004USUOUY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 13]","Having seen several versions of Anthol Fugard's Tony winning play ""Master Harold...and the Boys"" since its debut in 1982, I was curious to see how it might be expanded for a genuine film adaptation.  A presentation from 1985 starring Matthew Broderick was televised, but it was simply a recording of a live stage production.  Director Lonny Price (who starred in the original Broadway cast) keeps the integrity of the piece alive even as he releases the drama from its single setting environment.  Of course, I wouldn't want too much variation because what is so striking, understated, and powerful about the work is its intimacy.  Originally a three character drama, the expansion here introduces several other principles and locations but keeps the heart of Fugard's world intact.  Set in apartheid era South Africa, ""Master Harold"" tackles broad themes and complex relationships in a surprisingly effective and personal way.Freddie Highmore plays the title role, a conflicted teenager struggling with a difficult home life and an alcoholic father.  For many of his years, he has turned to the family's black servant (Ving Rhames playing Sam) for friendship and understanding.  As he has started to realize that the world is filled with hatred and casual racism, his relationship with Sam and Willie (another servant) has begun to evolve in new ways.  The bulk of the movie has these three characters confined in a roadhouse diner owned by Highmore's mother.  It's a stormy day and the three are left to their own devices which includes some play, some arguments, some ballroom dancing, and some reminiscences.  The dialogue veers between sparring and genuine fondness as Highmore continues to redefine their roles.  When his father decides to come home from the hospital ahead of schedule, Highmore is scared that the same fighting, drinking and abusive patterns will reemerge.  But as he can't take out his frustrations on the person who deserves them, he unleashes his anger on his two friends.In many ways, ""Master Harold"" uses its simplicity to great advantage.  There is so much conflict at work in Highmore's character as he struggles to find his place in an ugly world.  It's written across his face and in his words--and, at times, he seems incapable of escaping the bad choices that seem to have no alternative.  Highmore, best known for ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" although I prefer his work in ""Finding Neverland"" is an incredibly intuitive performer.  This is a great role and he handles it astutely.  Rhames is also very strong, very dignified.  The final segment of the film, largely stripped to these two going head-to-head, have a real urgency.  Even though the film deals with overt racism and could easily veer into preachy territory, it never does.  The characters are a product of their time and I appreciate that Price does not instantly update everything with modern sensibilities (a fatal flaw in many film updates).  The power and passion is conveyed in the struggle and knowing what is right is often different than doing what is right.  Highmore, here, must learn to be a man--but what kind of man will he choose to be given the circumstances of his environment?  A complex conundrum executed by a great cast.

The 1934 movie called No Greater Glory was only 73 minutes and was a little more complete than this one. I think that this movie should have been over 100 minutes in length just to tie up some loose ends. For instance I would of liked to have seen a little more of the father in this movie. There could of been a good prologue of the boys youth to introduce the rest of the movie. In all I think a fifty cent movie has been inflated to an amount of over Twenty dollars. Don't even buy this movie until you have at least rented this movie and judged for yourself whether it is worth the purchase.
