326176,A9LJRWNQTUOR1,6302658527,Alex,"[1, 14]","Muddled, superficial satire of high school politics feels dated already. Nick Nolte (who is OK here) is a yet another Hollywood educator who feels he can make a difference in the school as well as in one boy's life, who graduated as an illiterate. As a comedy is can pass. But as a drama it just falls apart, too often taking the easy way out and leaving mixed feelings at the end. Quite harmless, though Mulligan has a funny role as an escapee from a mental home who is mistaken for a teacher!",2,Just doesn't ring true,985996800,"03 31, 2001",2001,494,"['Muddled', 'superficial', 'satire', 'high', 'school', 'politics', 'feels', 'dated', 'already', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'OK', 'here', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'educator', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'boy', 'life', 'who', 'graduated', 'illiterate', 'comedy', 'can', 'pass', 'drama', 'just', 'apart', 'too', 'often', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'leaving', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'end', 'Quite', 'harmless', 'Mulligan', 'funny', 'role', 'escapee', 'mental', 'home', 'who', 'mistaken', 'teacher']",N/A

As many reviewers have stated, the movie still seems relevant nowadays even though the setting is almost 30 years ago. To begin with some of the less positive aspects of the film, I would say that the movie falls somewhat short of really closing the deal on some of the themes it seems to be hinting at. Obviously the main point of the movie is to examine the quality of education at a typical large city high school, namely the learning situation and working conditions. However, in spite of a couple of potentially interesting student and teacher situations, there is less emotional payoff or story resolution than could have been possible. You don't find out what happened in the end to most of the students or teachers, other than the suggestion of a possibly-happy ending. Additionally, there seem to be a number of gratuitous 1980s-type scenes that really were not central to the plot, such as the main female character running down the hallway naked. In spite of these shortcomings, the movie has some strong performances by some of the main characters, especially Nick Nolte as the central teacher character and Judd Hirsch as the Assistant Principal. There are some funny scenes that will make you chuckle and some interesting scenes that will make you think or will stick in your mind after seeing the movie, even if the movie as a whole ends up seeming somewhat inconsequential. I would recommend this movie as an interesting 1980s movie that still has some relevance today.",4,"Falls short, but still engaging",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1600,"['actually', 'attended', 'high', 'school', 'same', 'year', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'somehow', 'managed', 'not', 'see', 'originally', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'movie', 'still', 'relevant', 'nowadays', 'even', 'setting', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'begin', 'less', 'positive', 'aspects', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'short', 'really', 'closing', 'deal', 'themes', 'be', 'hinting', 'Obviously', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'examine', 'quality', 'education', 'typical', 'large', 'city', 'high', 'school', 'namely', 'learning', 'situation', 'working', 'conditions', 'However', 'spite', 'couple', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'student', 'teacher', 'situations', 'less', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'story', 'resolution', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'most', 'students', 'teachers', 'other', 'suggestion', 'possibly-happy', 'ending', 'Additionally', 'seem', 'be', 'number', 'gratuitous', '1980s-type', 'scenes', 'really', 'were', 'not', 'central', 'plot', 'such', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'running', 'down', 'hallway', 'naked', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'central', 'teacher', 'character', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Assistant', 'Principal', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'chuckle', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'will', 'stick', 'mind', 'seeing', 'movie', 'even', 'movie', 'whole', 'up', 'seeming', 'somewhat', 'inconsequential', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'interesting', '1980s', 'movie', 'still', 'relevance', 'today']",N/A

I would have only been 3 years old!) but whatever the case, the number one reason I enjoy Teachers is NOT because of the storytelling- it's because this film is absolutely loaded with top-notch actors and actresses that would go on to become major stars in future films.I'm really amazed just how many of these movie stars I was able to recognize while watching Teachers last night.  I recognize at least 90% of the actors from SOME movie I watched many years ago.  Definitely a trip down memory lane.Anyway, the storyline is pretty decent.  It's about a teacher who has to fight for what he believes in, that being helping a certain kid be able to read before he can honestly and accurately be passed.  The kid doesn't want to admit he has a reading problem of course, and then his parents enter the picture in one scene (and we find out what his dad is like- NOT a nice guy!).The storyline focuses mainly on the teachers having discussions and meetings throughout the school about how to handle the situations they're in, and while this is happening, a few of the kids have their own storylines for us to follow as well (such as one girl getting an abortion, a teenage boy getting shot while in school by police officers, etc).It's enough to keep my interest.

Unfortunatly, it jumps from drama to comedy so much that you feel that the producers-writers-directors have long gave up on the film or at least can't make up their minds.  Don't get me wrong, there is a messege to be heard here, but the writers can't seem to hit it on the head, just what they want to say. A quick example would be when the school is raided by the police, and they conduct a search of all the lockers.  A clearly mentally disturbed student (played wonderfully by Crispen Glover) is shot for trying to remove a gun from his locker.  Instead of going with this impact for a while and trying to get into the other character's head, the film quickly jumps to comedy by the next scene. And that's the end of that.  The school is being sued by an ex-student who graduated without learning to read.  It is an honest and hard look at our education sysytem, and again, the politics that get in the way.

She wants to bring suit against the school system in a misguided effortto help out the students, and when an out-of-court settlement robs her (and Nolte) of thechance to right wrongs, she shows she is willing to be ""naked"" before the system bystripping down in the school hallway?

Here's a learning institution that is always two steps away from going off the rails and where Murphy's Law has become a permanent fixture.  If something bad can happen, it will.  And it does, several times.Currently, the school is being sued for graduating a student who is functionally illiterate and that sets the tone for chaos to come.  In rapid succession the drivers education vehicle is stolen,  one teacher is bitten by a student while another teacher dies in the middle of his class, the promiscuous gym teacher gets a student pregnant, and the substitute down the hall is really an outpatient from a mental hospital.  Is that all, you say?  How about the school psychologist losing her composure (and her mind practically) in the front office while a student nearby bleeds from a stab wound followed by a teacher in the lounge checking her pistol to make sure it's fully loaded before going to her class.  Monday mornings are a killer at JFK high school, no doubt about that.Amidst all the great moments of humor and drama going on, a morality tale is tucked away in there somewhere.  Is the lawsuit about education or is it about money?  Can the lawyer for the plaintiff (JoBeth Williams) and a former student of Mr. Jurel's really make a difference for the better to save a failing system?  It's a bumpy road to the end but one with a lot of laughs, a decent plot, and a fine cast of characters.It's nice to finally see this movie out on DVD as it took forever for the studio to put it on the market.  Sadly, it is about as bare as you can get.  There aren't any special features to speak of and the sound is only two channel stereo which is unfortunate because it has some great 80`s music in the soundtrack.

He had never seen the movieTeachersso I bought him a copy and had it shipped to his home in northern Pennsylvania.It arrived in pieces.  It may have had something to do with the extremely cold weather at that time of the year as the DVD appeared to have shattered like glass.Regardless, I contacted the seller and had a replacement DVD in hand within 5 days.  No questions asked.  This was a great transaction in my mind along with a great movie. The seller is happy, I'm happy and my brother enjoyed the movie so he's happy.A well-meaning but burned-out high school teacher - Nick Nolte - tries to maintain order against the backdrop of a pending lawsuit against his school district when it comes to light they gave a diploma to an illiterate student.  As he attempts to educate his students, his attempts to help them get him into trouble with the school board, which only adds to his problems. With the support of his students he beats the school board and his frustration.This movie is well worth the price for two main reasons.  1.  The Jobeth Williams hallway scene and 2. The acting of Richard Mulligan.  Mulligan plays a mentally disturbed character that takes over a class when the teacher dies.  The school doesn't know he is not a teacher nor do they know he is not playing with a full deck.  Anyway, you'll have to watch the movie to see what transpires.

The teachers are tense, the students need a lot of help, and the principal has no clue on what's going on. He says the same comment, ""Really I didn't know that."" There's even a NARC in the school posing as a student.This is a great movie (love the 80's flicks). It's interesting to note that most of the movie takes place in one day; Monday. Besides Nick Nolte's Alex Jurel, the popular teacher was Richard Mulligan as Herbert Gower. Unfortunately he's taken by 2 guys in white jackets. It seems like Mr. Gower is an escapee. It wasn't until the end of the movie that the secretary catches up with Mr. Gower and questions him if he is a teacher which he smirks and replies,""No"".When a lawsuit shows up at the school, the vice principal sifts through the teacher folders to see who would be a problem. Apparently they aren't concerned that the student who filed the lawsuit was passed on to the next grade even though the student can't read or write. Morgan Freeman; the shcool's lawyer is trying to save the school from the million dollar lawsuit. All eyes become focused on Nick Nolte who had been teaching for many years and is showing the signs of being a burned out teacher. He believes in his students as well as the school as a whole but everytime he fights for the students he always seems to be stopped by the administration (Hirsch- the vice principal and Lee Grant- the superintendant). He goes as far as showing his AP class how to fix the radiator in the classroom. Jobeth Williams plays the lawyer who is representing the former student witht he lawsuit. She was also a former student of Mr. Jarels. She begins to see the red tape in the school and tries to reignite Alex Jurel's passion for teaching.Great soundtrack, great movie and Im not saying this because JoBeth Williams goes streaking in the hallways at the end of the movie. After 20 years this movie still makes me laugh. The laughs, the zaniness, and the cast as well as the students make this a great movie. It highlights the bureaucratic  red tape and an administration that doesn't meet the needs of its students but just wants warm bodies in the classroom. The movie is over 20 years old however, it's a comedic take on an old profesion; and it succedes. Teaching for almost 9 years in the NYC school system, many of my collegues bring up this movie as well. By the way, what you read in the papers or have any perceptions in the NYC school system, it's not as bad as you think. They are terrific kids.Finally, I only wish Boston Public is the next to be released.",5,"""Did you know he's bleeding? Well?

This realization didn't take place until the early 1980s and TEACHERS was made and released just as the debate over unequal education was starting to rage.The movie stars Nick Nolte as Alex Jurel. Alex is a good and dedicated teacher. He was an idealist when he first entered the profession and he thought he could change the world, but over the years the system chipped away at his ideals. When the film opens we find that he's still a teacher who is dedicated to his students, but also one who has problems with alcohol and who is a womanizer that's ashamed to tell people where he works. Alex closest friend is the school's Assistant Principal, Roger Rubell (Judd Hirsch). Roger used to share the same ideals as Alex, but he too become disillusioned and ended up giving up teaching to try administration instead. The background of these two characters is very realistic and describes what happens to many teachers after they have been in the profession for an extended period. It's a good thing that these two characters are the ones that ground the film because much else of what happens is a dystopian fantasy.The principal at the school is not only hopelessly inept and incompetent, but one has serious doubts that he could actually fulfill all the educational requirements he would have to in order to be a high school principal. The school secretary makes a mistake and calls a man who is literally clinically insane man to find out if he wants to work as a full-time substitute history teacher and this buy becomes the best and most popular teacher in the school until he is dragged away by the men in white coats. The high school gym teacher regularly has sex with female students and has been moved around from one school to another in the district to hide his indiscretions. One of the teachers is a very old man who doesn't actually teach in class, but has his students fill out dittos (for those who don't know, before there were copy machines there were ditto machines) all day while he sits at the back of the class reading a newspaper and sleeping; he's won the award for Most Orderly Classroom multiple times. The school has a psychologist who ends up getting in a fight right in front of the students over the ditto machine. One of the schools students bites the hand of an insecure, but dedicated teacher and doesn't receive any discipline for his actions at all. Oh, and the school is being sued by a parent because she says they just kept passing on her son even though he can't read.This is all very gritty dramatic material and some of it makes for good comedy, but hardly any of it is very realistic. I've worked at high schools and I know. For instance, in most states a substitute teacher has to go through an FBI background checks before they can even take a subbing assignment and many states and school districts are even more thorough than that (think more of the lines along a CIA background check).Despite the unrealistic portrayal, TEACHERS is a solid drama. The acting is top notch. The writing is better than expected. The film moves along at a decent pace, neither dragging along or moving too fast, and is only hampered by the film's over-the-top ending (can you say blatant and totally unnecessary nudity). Despite not having a realistic plot, the films setting helps ground the film, too, which really isn't all that surprising since the movie was actually filmed at a real high school: Central High School in Columbus, Ohio.Even though TEACHERS is not a realistic portrayal of the life of a high school teacher, it is a good drama that fosters serious questions that should be asked about education. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good drama, especially those who have worked in the education profession.",4,Once Upon a Time,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3950,"['Even', 'most', 'high', 'schools', 'country', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'resemblance', 'high', 'school', 'TEACHERS', 'savage', 'inequality', 'how', 'schools', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'funded', 'realization', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'early', '1980s', 'TEACHERS', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'just', 'debate', 'unequal', 'education', 'was', 'starting', 'rage.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Alex', 'Jurel', 'Alex', 'good', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'was', 'idealist', 'when', 'first', 'entered', 'profession', 'thought', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'years', 'system', 'chipped', 'away', 'ideals', 'When', 'film', 'find', 'still', 'teacher', 'who', 'dedicated', 'students', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'who', 'womanizer', 'ashamed', 'tell', 'people', 'where', 'Alex', 'closest', 'friend', 'school', 'Assistant', 'Principal', 'Roger', 'Rubell', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Roger', 'used', 'share', 'same', 'ideals', 'Alex', 'too', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'up', 'teaching', 'try', 'administration', 'instead', 'background', 'two', 'characters', 'very', 'realistic', 'what', 'many', 'teachers', 'have', 'been', 'profession', 'extended', 'period', 'good', 'thing', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'ones', 'ground', 'film', 'much', 'else', 'what', 'dystopian', 'fantasy.The', 'principal', 'school', 'not', 'only', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'incompetent', 'one', 'serious', 'doubts', 'could', 'actually', 'fulfill', 'educational', 'requirements', 'would', 'have', 'order', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'school', 'secretary', 'mistake', 'man', 'who', 'literally', 'clinically', 'insane', 'man', 'find', 'out', 'work', 'full-time', 'substitute', 'history', 'teacher', 'buy', 'best', 'most', 'popular', 'teacher', 'school', 'dragged', 'away', 'men', 'white', 'coats', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'teacher', 'regularly', 'sex', 'female', 'students', 'been', 'moved', 'one', 'school', 'district', 'hide', 'indiscretions', 'One', 'teachers', 'very', 'old', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'actually', 'teach', 'class', 'students', 'fill', 'out', 'dittos', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'copy', 'machines', 'were', 'ditto', 'machines', 'day', 'back', 'class', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'sleeping', 'won', 'award', 'Most', 'Orderly', 'Classroom', 'multiple', 'times', 'school', 'psychologist', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'fight', 'right', 'front', 'students', 'ditto', 'machine', 'One', 'schools', 'students', 'hand', 'insecure', 'dedicated', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'receive', 'discipline', 'actions', 'Oh', 'school', 'being', 'sued', 'parent', 'just', 'kept', 'passing', 'son', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read.This', 'very', 'gritty', 'dramatic', 'material', 'good', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'very', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'high', 'schools', 'know', 'instance', 'most', 'states', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'go', 'FBI', 'background', 'checks', 'can', 'even', 'take', 'subbing', 'assignment', 'many', 'states', 'school', 'districts', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'thorough', 'think', 'more', 'lines', 'CIA', 'background', 'check', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'TEACHERS', 'solid', 'drama', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'writing', 'better', 'expected', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'decent', 'pace', 'dragging', 'along', 'moving', 'too', 'fast', 'only', 'hampered', 'film', 'over-the-top', 'ending', 'can', 'say', 'blatant', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'nudity', 'not', 'having', 'realistic', 'plot', 'films', 'setting', 'ground', 'film', 'too', 'really', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'Central', 'High', 'School', 'Columbus', 'Ohio.Even', 'TEACHERS', 'not', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'good', 'drama', 'serious', 'questions', 'should', 'be', 'asked', 'education', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'drama', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'education', 'profession']",N/A
