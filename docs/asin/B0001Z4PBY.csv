817986,A3673NBQVA4J2M,B0001Z4PBY,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[2, 4]","This has the makings of a decent crime thriller, but it gets overdone in the storyline. Cash shows he's an actor in this as the sociopathic Johnny Talon. I also feel Vic(Mel Sharples)Tayback did a great performance in this as Fred his partner. This is an odd couple indeed, but there's nothing to laugh at here. Fred hires Johnny to hold up a bank, and the catch is they take the vice president's wife which Johnny does, and Fred does the hold-up. There's one catch though, and that's the vice-president doesn't care as he's about ready to run off with his mistress. Cash not only does a impressive acting job, but he actually shows off his guitar abilities here, and he's actually good. Unfortunately, this had some moments that were overdone like where the woman Priscilla keeps calling the vice-president's house to speak to his wife, and then there was little Ronnie Howard as thier little boy who makes it home just in time bringing the police with him. I found the ending too predictable not like in ""Jeopardy"" where Barbara Stanwyck convinces an bank robber to help her husband as he's caught under a fishing pier, and when he frees her husband she lets him escape. I feel the soundtrack was good, Cash was good, and so was Tayback, but the storyline was overdone by about 15 minutes. Wait till Walmart sells this for a buck.",2,"There's no ""Hello I'm Johnny Cash"" here",1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,1332,"['makings', 'decent', 'crime', 'thriller', 'overdone', 'storyline', 'Cash', 'actor', 'sociopathic', 'Johnny', 'Talon', 'also', 'feel', 'Vic', 'Mel', 'Sharples', 'Tayback', 'did', 'great', 'performance', 'Fred', 'partner', 'odd', 'couple', 'indeed', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'here', 'Fred', 'Johnny', 'hold', 'up', 'bank', 'catch', 'take', 'vice', 'president', 'wife', 'Johnny', 'Fred', 'hold-up', 'one', 'catch', 'vice-president', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'ready', 'run', 'off', 'mistress', 'Cash', 'not', 'only', 'impressive', 'acting', 'job', 'actually', 'guitar', 'abilities', 'here', 'actually', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'overdone', 'like', 'where', 'woman', 'Priscilla', 'calling', 'vice-president', 'house', 'speak', 'wife', 'then', 'was', 'little', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'thier', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'home', 'just', 'time', 'bringing', 'police', 'found', 'ending', 'too', 'predictable', 'not', 'Jeopardy', 'where', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'bank', 'robber', 'help', 'husband', 'caught', 'fishing', 'pier', 'when', 'husband', 'escape', 'feel', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'good', 'Cash', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'Tayback', 'storyline', 'was', 'overdone', '15', 'minutes', 'Wait', 'Walmart', 'buck']",Five Minutes to Live

He plays a kind of derranged villian who hasn't a problem killing another person (except children). It's a decent, low-budget  film, the kind of film you'll see on a Saturday afternoon on television--nothing remarkable. His acting is a bit stiff. He sings the song, ""Five Minutes to Live.""

817989,A2CX9NZ346HY7T,B0001Z4PBY,Richard J. Oravitz,"[5, 6]","Both of Sun Records Rockabilly sensations were grinding out films in the early 1960's. However, while Elvis was appearing in Technicolor extravagances and singing of Blue Hawaiis and Kissin Cousins, Johnny Cash was appearing in this b&w no-budget gem as a psycho looser holding a housewife hostage while crooning to her that she's got ""FIVE MINUTES TO LIVE""!...weird, it's kind of like Johnny Cash comes to Mayberry to rob the bank, flips out and ends up using Opie as a shield as he attempts a backyard escape through the neighborhood. Actually, that's pretty much what happens. Vic Tayback co-stars as Cash's partner in the bank robbery gone wrong and there are unpredictable jolts of violence and mayhem from Johnny to keep things interesting. Offbeat and strange and a little unsettling at times. Cash is quite good as are most of the other actors in this bare bones production. And Opie is...well, Opie. So even if you buy this one for the novelty, you won't be disappointed because it's really a pretty good movie, and the Alpha dvd print is quite acceptible too.",4,CLASSIC CASH CHEAPIE!!!,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1069,"['Sun', 'Records', 'Rockabilly', 'sensations', 'were', 'grinding', 'out', 'films', 'early', '1960', 'However', 'Elvis', 'was', 'appearing', 'Technicolor', 'extravagances', 'singing', 'Blue', 'Hawaiis', 'Kissin', 'Cousins', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'appearing', 'b', 'w', 'no-budget', 'gem', 'psycho', 'looser', 'holding', 'housewife', 'hostage', 'crooning', 'got', 'FIVE', 'MINUTES', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'weird', 'kind', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Mayberry', 'rob', 'bank', 'out', 'up', 'using', 'Opie', 'shield', 'backyard', 'escape', 'neighborhood', 'Actually', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'co-stars', 'Cash', 'partner', 'bank', 'robbery', 'gone', 'wrong', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'jolts', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'Johnny', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Offbeat', 'strange', 'little', 'unsettling', 'times', 'Cash', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'bare', 'production', 'Opie', 'well', 'Opie', 'So', 'even', 'buy', 'one', 'novelty', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Alpha', 'dvd', 'print', 'quite', 'acceptible', 'too']",Five Minutes to Live
