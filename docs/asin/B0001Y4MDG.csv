Freeman,"[51, 54]","While I loved this DVD as far as the history and application of this material is concerned it does NOT delve into technique, which is why I purchased it to begin with. Like others here I was hoping for specific techniques that would explain how to clear the energy field but came away very disappointed. Villoldo builds slowly over the course of 72 minutes about the history and origins of this fascinating topic, explains how we are all affected by different types of energy, gives the symptomology of energy 'contamination', but leaves out the all-important part: How do you clear the energy field? Lets hope he answers this question in forthcoming DVD's.",4,Fascinating But Misleading,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,657,"['loved', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'history', 'application', 'material', 'concerned', 'NOT', 'delve', 'technique', 'why', 'purchased', 'begin', 'others', 'here', 'was', 'hoping', 'specific', 'techniques', 'would', 'explain', 'how', 'clear', 'energy', 'field', 'came', 'away', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Villoldo', 'slowly', 'course', '72', 'minutes', 'history', 'origins', 'fascinating', 'topic', 'how', 'are', 'affected', 'different', 'types', 'energy', 'symptomology', 'energy', ""'contamination"", 'out', 'all-important', 'part', 'How', 'do', 'clear', 'energy', 'field', 'hope', 'question', 'forthcoming', 'DVD']",N/A

This DVD is Villoldo's clear, concise articulation of the energy field, the Luminous Body, which surrounds and informs the physical body.  Incorporating Alex Grey's paintings of energy, of Spirit surrounding and embodied in the physical, Villoldo explains that the Luminous Body is the software which informs the hardware of the physical body, that dis-ease first appears in the Luminous Body and can be healed there through the energy work of the Shamans.

817007,AYFM7WH9YAQA,B0001Y4MDG,Paul b,"[88, 96]",Overall this dvd was well done. It is basically a talk given by Alberto describing his healing practices and the energy body. This is a great intro to a great mans work. I really enjoyed Villoldos books and believe that he is a great teacher. I would have liked to have seen a demonstration in this video. Maybe a live healing/ cleansing or some guided meditation. Perhaps his technique on balancing the chakras.Thank You Alberto...Paul,4,Great intro to Villoldo's work,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,436,"['Overall', 'dvd', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'basically', 'talk', 'given', 'Alberto', 'describing', 'healing', 'practices', 'energy', 'body', 'great', 'intro', 'great', 'mans', 'work', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Villoldos', 'books', 'believe', 'great', 'teacher', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'demonstration', 'video', 'Maybe', 'live', 'healing/', 'cleansing', 'guided', 'meditation', 'Perhaps', 'technique', 'balancing', 'chakras.Thank', 'Alberto', 'Paul']",N/A

There are a few cut away scenes of him in various environments, also some very arresting paintings by Alex Grey.  But just so you know, this is more of an interview.  I loved it.
