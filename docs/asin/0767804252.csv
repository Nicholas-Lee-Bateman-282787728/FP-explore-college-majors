Then there's Mickey Rourke, who probably just did this for a paycheck. He doesn't even have a whole lot of screen time. The movie is a complete mess.

Steven Seagal and Ja Rule? Oh nevermind.This movie marked the end of Van Damme's run as a box-office champion and thankfully stopped Rodman's acting career before it even started. All in all, this movie is actually pretty good. Well, at least the action sequences courtesy of Hong Kong director Tsui Hark are.

7577,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,0767804252,D. Allen,"[0, 0]","Every movie Van Damme stars in has the same plot: someone is holding his family and he's trying to get them back. Besides the same plot setting, Double Team marks the second movie Van Damme made with the word ""Double"" in it (aka Double Impact) but entirely different storyline. As the word suggest, it's double the disaster.Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, an ex-CIA agent who gets thrown into stopping world domination but it gets personal when an old nemesis captures his pregnant wife. The movie has many cheesy lines where Van Damme argues that he doesn't want to fight - like most of his movie - yet he goes on some sort of rampage beating everyone up and shooting people. Unlike his other movies, I think Double Team lacked consistency and flow. Although I have no idea, I think because of the fact that the movie is only 1 hour and 30 minutes, they had to cut out a lot of content just to fit that time frame. As a result, the movie had horrible flow. From one scene to another without any sort of sense to tie it together. I think just adding in about 5-10 minutes of content would have helped this movie out greatly to tie everything together.Rodman stars in this movie as a smart R&D; weapon expert in the likes of Dr Q. However, I think Rodman is considered anything but smart, especially with weapons and complex gadgets. Looking at similar career of basketball player, I can think of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who starred in the movie Airplane. In that movie, Kareem at least had a interesting and funny plot line as a co-pilot while using his basketball career as a funny story. Rodman in Double Team is clearly used as a draw in for people to watch the movie. If I remember right, about the time Double Team come about, Rodman was in the media at full blast and was the hottest story. The part that gave it away was when Rodman made this basketball like parachute, but it wasn't anything like a parachute, just a cocoon in the shape of a basketball. Rodman also picked up a USP pistol and said it was completely automatic, which it isn't. Also, Rodman used a skull in the catacombs as a free throw joke when he was trying to hit the detonator on some C4.Rodman and Van Damme are teamed up to stop a madman named Stavos (Mickey Rourke) who is a very dangerous ex-agent. Apparently, Stavos used to work for the US, yet for reasons unknown, he decides to turn against the world - yet he wants to live in Rome and can travel the world freely. He lives in Rome and walks the streets freely. You'd think that with such a dangerous, worldwide wanted man, he would want to stay in hiding. Yet he has a home in the city and nobody gives a second look or anything; also he can fly worldwide to gather people yet no body at the airport noticed him. He also has a Glock with a red dot on it and is able to make precision aim with it to where he can hit someone through the scope of a rifle from more than a 100 yards, yet he's unable to hit someone standing right in front of him. At the end of the movie, Stavos makes up this clever, complex and insane mine field where he wants to fight Van Damme in a final showdown instead of just shooting him when he had a chance.Overall the movie is a disaster. Like I said above, the basic of the story is Van Damme trying to get his wife back. In between it, throw in random snipers, some crazy Chinese ninja guy capable hold a knife with his toes to stab someone instead of just stabbing them using his hands, and you got Double Team. The movie lacked any sort of flow and consistency, but it's still overall funny and good. Van Damme has made some good movies using the same basic plot line - trying to get home - but I think after doing it so many times, you just can't think of anything better so you make something ridiculous and silly like Double Team.",3,"Same ole plot, just worse",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3795,"['movie', 'Van', 'Damme', 'stars', 'same', 'plot', 'someone', 'holding', 'family', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'same', 'plot', 'setting', 'Double', 'Team', 'second', 'movie', 'Van', 'Damme', 'made', 'word', 'Double', 'aka', 'Double', 'Impact', 'entirely', 'different', 'storyline', 'word', 'suggest', 'double', 'disaster.Van', 'Damme', 'Jack', 'Quinn', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'thrown', 'stopping', 'world', 'domination', 'personal', 'when', 'old', 'nemesis', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'movie', 'many', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'where', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'most', 'movie', 'yet', 'sort', 'rampage', 'beating', 'everyone', 'up', 'shooting', 'people', 'other', 'movies', 'think', 'Double', 'Team', 'lacked', 'consistency', 'flow', 'have', 'idea', 'think', 'fact', 'movie', 'only', '1', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'lot', 'content', 'just', 'fit', 'time', 'frame', 'result', 'movie', 'had', 'horrible', 'flow', 'one', 'scene', 'sort', 'sense', 'tie', 'together', 'think', 'just', 'adding', '5-10', 'minutes', 'content', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'out', 'greatly', 'tie', 'everything', 'together.Rodman', 'movie', 'smart', 'R', 'D', 'weapon', 'expert', 'likes', 'Dr', 'Q', 'However', 'think', 'Rodman', 'considered', 'anything', 'smart', 'especially', 'weapons', 'complex', 'gadgets', 'Looking', 'similar', 'career', 'basketball', 'player', 'can', 'think', 'Kareem', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'who', 'starred', 'movie', 'Airplane', 'movie', 'Kareem', 'least', 'had', 'interesting', 'funny', 'plot', 'line', 'co-pilot', 'using', 'basketball', 'career', 'funny', 'story', 'Rodman', 'Double', 'Team', 'clearly', 'used', 'draw', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'remember', 'right', 'time', 'Double', 'Team', 'come', 'about', 'Rodman', 'was', 'media', 'full', 'blast', 'was', 'hottest', 'story', 'part', 'gave', 'away', 'was', 'when', 'Rodman', 'made', 'basketball', 'parachute', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'parachute', 'just', 'cocoon', 'shape', 'basketball', 'Rodman', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'USP', 'pistol', 'said', 'was', 'completely', 'automatic', ""n't"", 'Also', 'Rodman', 'used', 'skull', 'catacombs', 'free', 'throw', 'joke', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'hit', 'detonator', 'C4.Rodman', 'Van', 'Damme', 'are', 'teamed', 'stop', 'madman', 'named', 'Stavos', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'very', 'dangerous', 'ex-agent', 'Apparently', 'Stavos', 'used', 'work', 'US', 'yet', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'turn', 'world', 'yet', 'live', 'Rome', 'can', 'travel', 'world', 'freely', 'Rome', 'walks', 'streets', 'freely', ""'d"", 'think', 'dangerous', 'worldwide', 'wanted', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'stay', 'hiding', 'home', 'city', 'nobody', 'second', 'look', 'anything', 'also', 'can', 'fly', 'worldwide', 'gather', 'people', 'yet', 'body', 'airport', 'noticed', 'also', 'Glock', 'red', 'dot', 'able', 'make', 'precision', 'aim', 'where', 'can', 'hit', 'someone', 'scope', 'rifle', 'more', '100', 'yards', 'unable', 'hit', 'someone', 'standing', 'right', 'front', 'end', 'movie', 'Stavos', 'up', 'clever', 'complex', 'insane', 'mine', 'field', 'where', 'fight', 'Van', 'Damme', 'final', 'showdown', 'instead', 'just', 'shooting', 'when', 'had', 'chance.Overall', 'movie', 'disaster', 'said', 'basic', 'story', 'Van', 'Damme', 'trying', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'throw', 'random', 'snipers', 'crazy', 'Chinese', 'ninja', 'guy', 'capable', 'hold', 'knife', 'toes', 'stab', 'someone', 'instead', 'just', 'stabbing', 'using', 'hands', 'got', 'Double', 'Team', 'movie', 'lacked', 'sort', 'flow', 'consistency', 'still', 'overall', 'funny', 'good', 'Van', 'Damme', 'made', 'good', 'movies', 'using', 'same', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'think', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'better', 'so', 'make', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'silly', 'Double', 'Team']",N/A

7583,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0767804252,Jason,"[9, 10]","The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1. Who is he? Jack Quinn, anti-terrorism expert2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? His kidnapped wife, his unborn son3. Does he take his shirt off? His opening scene is straight out of the shower, and into the swimming pool4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? How do you think his wife got pregnant?5. Is there a tournament? No, but Dennis Rodman thinks there is6. Is training needed for this tournament?  No, but Dennis Rodman should have taken some acting classes beforehand7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? Constantly.  This might be the most splitastic of all his movies.8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  As if JCVD was attempting to sabotage this movie, he leaves out one of his classic moves.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? So much so that in a deleted scene he gets dizzy and pukes10. Is his enemy unbeatable? For the role, Mickey Rourke looks buff, not tough11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Just Rodman's acting12. Does he win? As lamely as possibleCoaxed out of retirement to capture his arch-nemesis Stavros (Rourke), it's up to Quinn to ensure he is prepared with the latest weaponry.  Quinn makes his way to the local source of all sexual and social deviation in Antwerp.  Bikers, hippies, extreme tattoo artists and piercing specialists, trannies, hookers, body modification oddities, freaks and geeks.  Naturally, he'd run into Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in a place like this.  And, of course, Rodman is an exotic arms dealer, an extraterrestrial version of James Bond's trusty Q.Now supplied with a weapon that can, ""shoot the d*@k off a hummingbird"", Quinn sets up Stavros in the first ever carnival sting.  When the plan goes awry - not to mention the best fight ever in a hospital nursery - Quinn is sent to The Colony, a top secret, pseudo-retirement home for special agents who still monitor world events.Ironically directed by Tsui Hard, the reason this film fails is that it tries too hard.  Some nice slow-motion, Matrix-esque bullet dodging scenes, and the JCVD kicks are always classic, but there's just too much to truly enjoy.  From an ATV in southern France to plutonium stolen in Croatia, from a plane shot down by the North Koreans, and on to Rome, Antwerp, etc...it's pointless for the film's progression, as if the director simply wanted to collect frequent flyer mileage.  The dialogue between JCVD and Rodman is atrocious.  Delivered in a completely unpleasant hiccup staccato style, it's difficult to ascertain who speaks worse English.  Made worse by the insistence of inserting basketball jargon into every possible sentence, it's simply painful.  And I'll only briefly mention the pathetic attempts to insert the burgeoning internet into the mix, the fact that JCVD kicks a tiger, and the insulting Coca Cola product placement at the end.I recommend this for only the JCVD zealot.",3,Personal Foul - Dennis Rodman,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,2941,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'Jack', 'Quinn', 'anti-terrorism', 'expert2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'kidnapped', 'wife', 'unborn', 'son3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'opening', 'scene', 'straight', 'shower', 'swimming', 'pool4', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'How', 'do', 'think', 'wife', 'got', 'pregnant', '5', 'there', 'tournament', 'No', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'is6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'No', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'acting', 'classes', 'beforehand7', 'Does', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'Constantly', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'splitastic', 'movies.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'JCVD', 'was', 'attempting', 'sabotage', 'movie', 'out', 'one', 'classic', 'moves.9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'So', 'much', 'deleted', 'scene', 'dizzy', 'pukes10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'role', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'buff', 'not', 'tough11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'Just', 'Rodman', 'acting12', 'win', 'As', 'lamely', 'possibleCoaxed', 'retirement', 'capture', 'arch-nemesis', 'Stavros', 'Rourke', 'up', 'Quinn', 'ensure', 'prepared', 'latest', 'weaponry', 'Quinn', 'way', 'local', 'source', 'sexual', 'social', 'deviation', 'Antwerp', 'Bikers', 'hippies', 'extreme', 'tattoo', 'artists', 'piercing', 'specialists', 'trannies', 'hookers', 'body', 'modification', 'oddities', 'freaks', 'geeks', 'Naturally', ""'d"", 'run', 'Yaz', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'place', 'course', 'Rodman', 'exotic', 'arms', 'dealer', 'extraterrestrial', 'version', 'James', 'Bond', 'trusty', 'Q.Now', 'supplied', 'weapon', 'can', 'shoot', 'd*', '@', 'k', 'off', 'hummingbird', 'Quinn', 'up', 'Stavros', 'first', 'ever', 'carnival', 'sting', 'When', 'plan', 'awry', 'not', 'mention', 'best', 'fight', 'ever', 'hospital', 'nursery', 'Quinn', 'sent', 'Colony', 'top', 'secret', 'pseudo-retirement', 'home', 'special', 'agents', 'who', 'still', 'monitor', 'world', 'events.Ironically', 'directed', 'Tsui', 'Hard', 'reason', 'film', 'too', 'hard', 'nice', 'slow-motion', 'Matrix-esque', 'bullet', 'dodging', 'scenes', 'JCVD', 'kicks', 'are', 'always', 'classic', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'ATV', 'southern', 'France', 'plutonium', 'stolen', 'Croatia', 'plane', 'shot', 'down', 'North', 'Koreans', 'Rome', 'Antwerp', 'etc', 'pointless', 'film', 'progression', 'director', 'simply', 'wanted', 'collect', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'mileage', 'dialogue', 'JCVD', 'Rodman', 'atrocious', 'Delivered', 'completely', 'unpleasant', 'hiccup', 'staccato', 'style', 'difficult', 'ascertain', 'who', 'worse', 'English', 'Made', 'worse', 'insistence', 'inserting', 'basketball', 'jargon', 'possible', 'sentence', 'simply', 'painful', ""'ll"", 'only', 'briefly', 'mention', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'insert', 'burgeoning', 'internet', 'mix', 'fact', 'JCVD', 'tiger', 'insulting', 'Coca', 'Cola', 'product', 'placement', 'end.I', 'recommend', 'only', 'JCVD', 'zealot']",N/A

It appears that the negative customer reviews are coming from people who viewed this one on VHS.  If you don't like action films, so be it.  I gave up on going to theaters with the prices they charge, the people who like to gab a lot and make candy and popcorn noises.  Watching films like this on DVD, letterboxed, on a screen three feet wide, complete with digital surround can make a lot of difference.  Granted, not everyone has room for or even wants a lot of audio/video equipment, but it's the closest you can get to the &quot;director's product&quot; without going to a theater.  I've seen this film twice at home, and today I am ordering a copy for my collection.

A curious mixture, designed to introduce Tsui to international audiences following the director's long - and successful - career in SE Asia (where he produced and/or directed a number of iconic entries, including the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""A Better Tomorrow"" series).Narrative and characterization are minimal at best, and the visual effects are surprisingly poor for a late 1990's action pic, but die-hard fans will doubtless embrace the film's outrageous set-pieces, including a final showdown between Van Damme and Rourke in a crumbling Roman arena which recalls the Colosseum battle between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris in THE WAY OF THE DRAGON (1972). Voyeurs will also appreciate the attention lavished on Van Damme's physical splendor: Watch out for a brief - but memorable - sequence in which the almost-naked actor uses a weighted bathtub as training apparatus, which is played and edited like a hot 'n' heavy sex scene, complete with orgasmic sound effects!

7594,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0767804252,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","At this point in time, NBA superstar Dennis Rodman had the world on a silver platter: not only was he getting away with conduct and eccentricities that would have gotten others banned, but he was getting cheered for it in the media. In addition to TV shows and pro wrestling appearances, he was hooked up with Jean-Claude Van Damme in order to boost the martial arts hero's slowly-descending movie career. Completing this strange package was action legend Tsui Hark (Once Upon a Time in China) making his directorial debut in Hollywood, adding himself to the growing list of Hong Kong filmmakers who broke into America by using the gamely Van Damme as a vehicle. The resulting movie was a refreshing change as far as Van Damme's career goes, but not enough to save him from his eventual DTV detour and definitely not as awesome as it could have been.The story: CIA agent Jack Quinn (Van Damme) returns from retirement to track down his nemesis, the terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke,Iron Man 2), but is debilitated and left dead to the world at the end of the mission. Awakening in the clutches of an ex-agent organization called the Colony, he must first retrain himself and then find a way to resume pursuing his target, along with the help of an eccentric arms dealer (Rodman.)While Van Damme would never make a true Hong Kong action movie, ""Double Team"" (along with his following Hark collaboration,Knock Off) comes reasonably close with its flashy presentation, strange plot devices, and spiffed-up martial arts content. That last aspect is what made me want to see the movie: to see Van Damme's moves wrangled by legends like Xin Xin Xiong (Time and Tide) and - the biggest brother of all - Sammo Hung (Ip Man). Sadly, this stuff isn't at all as amazing as it ought to be. Van Damme has about four solid fights while Rodman has one, but while the basketball player gets point for having his bout come across decent in regard to his lack of experience, the karate champion gets a booing for not really doing anything out of the ordinary. His initial fight with Rourke was pretty good and featured minimal doubling, but their climatic rematch featured stretches which were clearly shot without having both performers on the set at the same time. The only true Hong Kong-style battle occurs when choreographer Xin Xin takes to the screen himself and fights Van Damme while holding a switchblade twixt his toes; that was awesome, but it was the exception. Oh, and Van Damme also fights a real tiger, but believe it, this too isn't entirely memorable.Two things I was surprised by: Mickey Rourke really isn't in the movie a lot and Dennis Rodman doesn't do too badly as an actor. Yes, I know Rodman received several Razzis for this movie, but hey, if you're up to listening to Van Damme accent his way through a film, then Rodman will come across just fine. Rourke's character starts off great with his vendetta against Jack for accidentally killing his son, but then becomes enigmatic with only a handful of scenes to himself. This is a shame, seeing as he's the best performer in the show, but that was pretty much a given. I remain fuzzy on the story, which should've been simple enough but becomes overly convoluted with the introduction of the Colony and Jack needing to escape via airlift; straight arrow would've been better. Also, the Van Damme/Rodman pairing wasn't taken advantage of properly: they jabber and make fun of the other's quirks, but there's no real sense of either camaraderie or rivalry between them and a promised fight between the two is cut short. Shame.In the end, ""Double Team"" is neither as bad as the critics blasted it as nor as good as I was hoping it to be. It's just another Van Damme movie: a bit more exotic than his usual big budget work, but still just another vehicle.

dealer called Yaz,and Mickey Rourke as their nemesis,a terrorist named Stavros.Rodman was the one colourful member of the Chicago Bulls three-star unbeatable scoring line,along with Scotty Pippen and the legendary Michael Jordan.Rodman was frequently in the news for his bad boy behaviour and flamboyant dress,the latter much in view in this movie.During his recent dedication into the Basketball Hall of Fame,Rodman,tearfully looking back on his career,said that his outside persona was,for the most part,only a front.This movie has many,many references to his ball playing days and were much more relevant to viewing audiences back when this film was released,but they haven't worn well with age,especially to a newer generation that may not be as familiar with The Bulls and Rodman as others may be.And unfortunately his lines,along with Rodman's stiffness in the acting department,doesn't enhance the movie along one bit.Rourke pulls in a good,dark and moody performance as Stavros and works well off of Van Damme.The opening finds Jack Quinn,a member of a secretive counter terrorist outfit,having to steal a shipment of plutonium bound for Iraq from some Romanians.Three years later he is living the good life with his wife in a beautiful villa when the organization,that he apparently had walked away from three years prior,comes a-calling again.This time it is personal as his old nemesis Stavros is back and they have the perfect plan to take him down,for the perfect man to do it.Quinn reluctantly agrees to the job which is to ambush Stavros at a carnival.Before the take down Quinn visits an arms dealer in Antwerp by the name of Yaz,who fulfills his need for some serious weaponry.The situation at the carnival turns south fairly quickly and in the melee' Stavros' only son is accidentally shot.Well now it is extra personal between Stavros and Quinn.Stavros gets away and Quinn,seriously injured including a broken leg,loses his man.Next day Quinn wakes up on an island.It seems the organization he works for does not take to failure too kindly and all who do end up there either work for them as consultants,or dead if they do not agree to stay.While there Quinn meets both friend and foe from his past,all supposed to be dead,and almost from the get go he is determined to escape no matter what the consequences.He trains for months in secret,building his strength and endurance back up,and finally the day comes of his escape and he still has to get past the tight security and the tightly timed lasers set up in the water into which he must dive into.There are no room for errors as he just barely manages to grab onto a skid of material being picked up from the water by plane.Into the air he goes and through perseverance manages to board the plane and hi-jack it.His first stop is Antwerp and Yaz agrees to help Quinn get to Stavros and his wife,who is pregnant and a captive of Stavros.He tracks Stavros down to an old amphitheater in Rome whose field has been laid with mines.Before he confronts Stavros,Quinn must escape from a roaming tiger which he does by leading said cat to one of Stavros's men.Meanwhile Yaz has Quinns baby and he stashes it in a safe place and heads into the field to help Quinn.Stavros and Quinn are duking and kicking it out as he flies into the situation on a bike.All three consequently end up stepping onto trip mines,with Yaz being able to disarm his.Quinn soon finds he has stepped on nothing and it is Stavros who is on the real mine.It seems Yaz had been there previously and uprooted and replanted some stakes designating where the mines actually were.Yaz and Quinn flee the area as the tiger enters the arena and confronts Stavros,who now is resigned to his death.As the cat pounces he releases his foot setting off a huge explosion.Outside Quinn is confronted by a member of the organization from the island.Each member had a guardian assigned to them,and if one strayed or tried to escape the guardian,they would pursue to kill.However Yaz intervenes with a toss of his lucky coin,which produces an instant cloud whose cover Quinn uses to escape with his son.This movie really moves but it practically races over the little nuances that tie many meaningful parts of the plot together.That is why on first viewing one may lose track of why Quinn is doing a certain thing at a certain time and why he is at where he is.It is only with repeated viewings that I able to pick things up that I had missed the first time.It's major failing,when all is said and done,is it tries hard to do too much,and not very well.The script is also second rate stuff,with,as noted above,Rodman looking a little out of his league.Van Damme and Rourke play well off of each other and both really worked hard to get into shape for this film.Director Hark Tsui must have thought he was smart interjecting the tiger into the film twice in key parts.The first time it was the tiger that swiped Stavros`s wife into the path of the bullets which ultimately killed her and their son.The second time was the chase through the amphitheater.The reason for its`appearances may have had more to do with just impressing the films makers Mandalay films,whose logo is the tiger(seen in the pre-credits),than an actual plot device.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and generally looks clear and crisp,but at times is slightly grainy and could use a good remastering.It is also in 5.1 Dolby stereo and surround sound.The only extra is the trailer.In conclusion,just an average Van Damme entry,hampered by a poor script,too fast a pace in crucial moments and basketball star Dennis Rodman`s stiff thespian skills.The latter`s appearance was a blatant move to cash in on his then substantial fame and to boost the film`s cred;it did neither.",3,An average slam dunk for Van Damme,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,5928,"['Double', 'Team', 'released', 'April/97', 'Jean', 'Claude',

All of the stunts are done well as it's essentially a hong kong movie in europe.-Dennis Rodman does surprisingly well as Van Damme's partner in action; his acting is not too good, but he's definitely charismatic, and hams up his role with various basketball references, which are funny despite falling flat mostly, because  of the very fact that they fall so flat haha. Lots of voice over acting which makes for a comedic atmosphere clash.-van damme garners much sympathy for his character as he serves as the quiet but deadly protagonist, who seeks to save his wife and child-The plot is absolutely brilliant insanity - you just need to watch it to believe it.  The funniest bits were me were the beginning with van damme's boss carrying on about Van Damme completing his mission of securing weapons grade plutonium in order to retire, as if it were a gameshow.  There is far more ridiculous stuff that goes on however-The direction by Hark Tsui is slyly brilliant. The editing is very kinetic and often confusing, but flows surprisingly well. The mix of the shots and the score produce quite a peculiar feel, that only hong kong autures seem capable of presenting.  Van Damme is treated like a complete bad a**, and all of the actors seem to have much room to express themselves.  Also mind that much of the acting is done via Voice Over, with little foley sound, and much of the soundtrack being overlain with a score. It reminds me of being a real-life version of the syphon-filter video gameAll and all it's a 10/10 movie for me.

7601,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,0767804252,Thor,"[0, 0]","Double Team is one of those films that had more bashing than there are actual viewers of the film.The film, starring actionstar Jean-Claude van Damme and basketbal pro Dennis Rodman, is directed by Hong Kong FilmLegend Tsui Hark. Even though the film has had so many negative words, it is stil a pretty fun ride to experience. I myself also had mixed feelings when seeying it for the first time, but that changed with a second viewing.The first things that comes to mind when watching the film is that it stars two men who aren't known for topnotch acting. Van Damme is good on action but is most of the time considered average with his acting skills. In Double Team this is no difference: his acting is ok but not great. But when it comes to action, he is on the right spot.Then there is Dennis Rodman, a probasketball player next to Van Damme. Now he is clearly not a born actor and this shows. Still, his attitide and one-liners are enjoyable and him teaming up with Van Damme is all part of the fun. Seeying them annoy each other and both (Yes, also Rodman) kicking around bad guys is, admit it, an ok way to kill some time. Rodman also plays around with his reallife basketball image, all good fun.Then we have the story: Easy and pretty Cheesy.But hey, there are hunderds of films with this kind of plot. But even though it is cliche sometimes, who cares, it works and entertains fine doesn't it? The same is with this film: just put your mind and zero and simply enjoy.Tsui Hark is known for his actionpacked Hong Kong films and shows his talent with this American film. The way the action is filmed and edited is sometimes true Hong Kong action cinema style. The action is therefor well shot and on a good level. Some good fighting, big explosions and running around.So, don't think to hard when watching this film, sit back and just let it entertain you. Cause even though the characters haven't got that much backround written for them, the story isn't difficult or highly original, it still has some fun aspects that actionfans can enjoy.",3,"Not Topnotch, but still Fun",1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2049,"['Double', 'Team', 'one', 'films', 'had', 'more', 'bashing', 'are', 'actual', 'viewers', 'film.The', 'film', 'starring', 'actionstar', 'Jean-Claude', 'van', 'Damme', 'basketbal', 'pro', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'directed', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'FilmLegend', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'Even', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'words', 'stil', 'pretty', 'fun', 'ride', 'experience', 'also', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'when', 'seeying', 'first', 'time', 'changed', 'second', 'viewing.The', 'first', 'things', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'known', 'topnotch', 'acting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'good', 'action', 'most', 'time', 'considered', 'average', 'acting', 'skills', 'Double', 'Team', 'difference', 'acting', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'when', 'action', 'right', 'spot.Then', 'Dennis', 'Rodman', 'probasketball', 'player', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Now', 'clearly', 'not', 'born', 'actor', 'shows', 'Still', 'attitide', 'one-liners', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'teaming', 'up', 'Van', 'Damme', 'part', 'fun', 'Seeying', 'annoy', 'other', 'Yes', 'also', 'Rodman', 'kicking', 'around', 'bad', 'guys', 'admit', 'ok', 'way', 'kill', 'time', 'Rodman', 'also', 'around', 'reallife', 'basketball', 'image', 'good', 'fun.Then', 'have', 'story', 'Easy', 'pretty', 'Cheesy.But', 'hey', 'are', 'hunderds', 'films', 'kind', 'plot', 'even', 'cliche', 'sometimes', 'who', 'fine', ""n't"", 'same', 'film', 'just', 'put', 'mind', 'zero', 'simply', 'enjoy.Tsui', 'Hark', 'known', 'actionpacked', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'films', 'talent', 'American', 'film', 'way', 'action', 'filmed', 'edited', 'sometimes', 'true', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'cinema', 'style', 'action', 'therefor', 'well', 'shot', 'good', 'level', 'good', 'fighting', 'big', 'explosions', 'running', 'around.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'hard', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'sit', 'back', 'just', 'let', 'entertain', 'Cause', 'even', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'much', 'backround', 'written', 'story', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'highly', 'original', 'still', 'fun', 'aspects', 'actionfans', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A
