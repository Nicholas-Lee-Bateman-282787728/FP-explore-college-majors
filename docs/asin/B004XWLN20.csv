I stuck with it to see what would happen. I would have liked Tom Welling as Clark Kent if he had been better able to portray the good hearted person that the character was supposed to be. Maybe that was the intent of the creators of the show. Tom Welling's eyes were so cold in this show, vacant and very vain. I didn't believe that this Clark Kent was a very good person his eyes were completely vacant. To me, Clark Kent was supposed to be modest and even though he is Superman, he is not supposed to think he is a Super Man. I prefer Dean Cain as Superman, he actually fit the part. I am really not sure if the fault lays with the creators maybe they were trying to make him more human, or the actor. Otherwise I would have liked this show once it got past the first few seasons and once Lois came around.

1432830,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B004XWLN20,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[3, 6]","AUTHOR'S NOTE:  I will highlight and examine pivotal and/or great episodes from all ten seasons in this review.  Spoilers will follow.REVIEW""Smallville"" is a phenomenal series, never losing overall creative steam through ten years producing in excess of 200 episodes.  Starring Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, Annette O'Toole, John Schneider, John Glover and Allison Mack, it expertly tells the story of a youthful Clark Kent, growing up in the titular rural town.  It is arguably the most ambitious, well-executed TV series of its kind.The first season picks up with a superlative pilot episode, as Clark's spaceship lands during a catastrophic meteor shower.  A red-haired boy named Lex Luthor gets his hair singed off by a meteor but escapes with his life.  The pilot also introduces a man by the name of Lionel Luthor.  Played superbly by John Glover, Lionel is a monstrously manipulative father for Lex.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Johnathan and Martha Kent find the baby whose ship was the reason for the meteor shower.  John Schneider and Annette O'Toole are a very youthful-looking Johnathan and Martha Kent, and play the parts so naturally it's easy to forget the image of older Eddie Jones and K Callan from ""Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman"" and Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter from ""Superman:  The Movie.""  Mr. Schneider and Ms. O'Toole pair with Tom Welling to form the best long-running representation of DC Comics' Kent Family I've ever seen.The pilot, simply called ""Pilot,"" also puts forth that kryptonite invades Smallville with the meteors and creates genetically altered teenagers.  Admittedly, the first of the bunch, a guy named Jeremy Creek, isn't necessarily the strongest villain.  But, his story presentation sets up iconic imagery for the series.  As Smallville High's first Scarecrow, Jeremy is a harbinger for the brand of torture that eventually befalls Clark himself.  An equally important story theme is the premise that the meteors that Clark rides in with kill Lana Lang's natural parents.  This gives Clark and Lana an intriguing set of issues that keep them apart.  Lana also ignorantly wears a kryptonite necklace as a keepsake that keeps Clark at a distance.First season episode highlights are ""Pilot,"" ""Hourglass,"" ""X-Ray,"" ""Leech,"" ""Jitters,"" ""Zero,"" and ""Stray.""  Guest stars in the first season include Amy Adams, Eric Christian Olsen, and Shawn Ashmore.The second season of ""Smallville"" is also very solid.  Beginning with ""Vortex,"" it presents a new set of challenges for both Clark and Lex and deepens the overall storyline considerably.  Lex becomes more obsessed with Clark and more distrustful and hostile toward his hateful father.  This season sows seeds that the series expands upon for years.  In ""Skinwalker,"" Clark discovers a cave system that connects brilliantly to his own life story, and he also develops an infatuation with a beautiful Native American activist.  Here is one of the series' first sustained myth-building devices, as the Kawatche Caves are revisited substantially over the next two years.  The series also takes a leap toward its future with ""Rosetta,"" a very well-conceived way for Clark to first learn about Krypton.  Widely-respected ""Superman"" film actor Christopher Reeve makes the first of two appearances as Dr. Virgil Swann, a reclusive billionaire scientist interested in Clark's life and powers.Second season episode highlights are ""Vortex,"" ""Skinwalker,"" ""Rosetta,"" ""Calling,"" ""Ryan,""  ""Suspect,"" and ""Insurgence"".  Notable guest stars for the second season are Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Paul Wesley(billed as 'Paul Wasilewski'), Emmanuelle Vaugier, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.The third season is very, very strong as the series matures into a meaty yarn with epic ambitions.  An expansion of a pronounced father-son theme evident from the pilot means deeper storylines for John Schneider as well as John Glover.  The extreme differences between the show's fathers come to the forefront in the third season premiere.  John Schneider's Johnathan Kent is in anguish and desperate for Clark's safe return in ""Exile,"" whereas John Glover's Lionel Luthor is nonchalant about Lex's own disappearance.  ""Exile"" also features Rutger Hauer as Morgan Edge, a top crime boss in Metropolis who slyly takes advantage of Clark's red kryptonite-affected superpowers for his own gain.  The follow-up show ""Phoenix"" is a perfect continuation of the premiere, as Edge and members of his gang trail a safely restored Clark back to Smallville.The third season is so strong that I could legitimately list eighteen or nineteen of it's twenty-two episodes as highlights.  Nevertheless, episode highlights are ""Exile,"" ""Legacy,"" ""Perry,"" ""Relic,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Memoria,"" and ""Covenant.""  Notable guest stars are Rutger Hauer, Patrick Bergin, and Michael McKean.The fourth season introduces Lois Lane, at first a recurring character on the show played by Erica Durance.  The season touches briefly on the Lane Family by bringing in guest star Michael Ironside for two episodes as Gen. Sam Lane, Lois' father.  Also, Peyton List appears for one episode as Lois' sister Lucy Lane.  Unfortunately, the season soon turns primarily to Lana Lang and her new boyfriend for the season, Jason Teague.  Played by Jensen Ackles of TV's ""Supernatural,"" Jason Teague is a thin character who is upstaged by his mother Genevieve.  Genevieve Teague is deliciously played by Jane Seymour.  The Teagues connect to an ill-conceived witch plotline for Lana Lang that bogs down most of the season.Episode highlights for the fourth season are ""Crusade,"" ""Unsafe,"" ""Pariah,"" ""Run,"" and ""Commencement.""  Notable guest stars are Michael Ironside, Jane Seymour, and Margot Kidder.The fifth season is terrific, continuing to embellish toward the ""Superman"" legend, with arguably the series' boldest character push in that direction to that point.  The season introduces Brainiac in the form of a humanoid college professor played by James Marsters.  Mr. Marsters does a very nice job of playing the character, and he and Tom Welling have a very good season-long story arc together.  Brainiac plays off of Clark and Lex in different ways, and the character becomes both a menace on his own terms and a harbinger of Zod.Fifth season episode highlights are ""Arrival,"" ""Mortal,"" ""Solitude,"" ""Splinter,"" ""Cyborg,"" ""Lexmas,"" and ""Oracle"".  Notable guest stars are Carrie Fisher, James Marsters, Alan Ritchson, and Lee Thompson Young.The sixth season continues to bring other ""Superman"" locales and themes into play.  The season premiere ""Zod"" debuts an awesomely executed, fully believable Phantom Zone and an intriguing new female character named Raya.  The premiere also introduces Jimmy Olsen for the first time in the series, played to great effect by Aaron Ashmore.  Oliver Queen is introduced in the season's second episode ""Sneeze,"" and debuts his full Green Arrow persona two shows later in the aptly titled ""Arrow.""  Oliver is played by Justin Hartley, and has a prep school history with Lex, explored in the episode ""Reunion.""  Clark is busy battling Phantom Zone escapees, and heartbreakingly watching a very frustrated Lana agree to marry an increasingly nasty Lex Luthor.Sixth season episode highlights are ""Zod,"" ""Arrow,"" ""Nemesis,"" ""Promise,"" and ""Justice.""  Notable guest stars are Justin Hartley and Phil Morris.The seventh season introduces the series' version of Kara Zor-El/Supergirl, played by Laura Vandervoort.  It's an up-and-down season that is strongest when it focuses almost exclusively on Clark, as in the excellent ""Traveler.""  Big changes come to the cast in general this year.  Notable guest stars are Marc McClure and Helen Slater.Episode highlights are ""Bizarro,"" ""Traveler,"" and ""Persona.""The eighth season brings on both Davis Bloome and Tess Mercer, played respectively by Sam Witwer and Cassidy Freeman.  The season also finally makes Justin Hartley a regular.  Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan takes a dark turn in an unhealthy relationship with Davis.  Clark must contend with the morally slippery Tess Mercer, and the progressively dangerous Davis Bloome.  Episode highlights are ""Odyssey,"" ""Bride,"" ""Legion,"" and ""Beast.""The ninth season brings Zod on in corporeal form, played very solidly by Callum Blue.  The season does a good job of giving Zod weight, by giving him a true army and a good backstory.  Episode highlights are ""Savior,"" ""Metallo,"" and ""Kandor.""  Guest stars are Brian Austin Green and Julian Sands.The tenth season ends the series wonderfully, bringing back veteran ""Smallville"" actors in meaningful roles and giving Clark his biggest challenges ever in Darkseid and his minions.  Guest stars are John Schneider, John Glover, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O'Toole, James Marsters, Christine Willes, and Lucas Grabeel, among many others.  Episode highlights are ""Kent,"" ""Luthor,"" ""Abandoned,"" ""Dominion,"" and ""Finale.""I probably will not buy this set, as it will mostly be repeating what I already own or plan to own with individual season sets.  ""Smallville"" is a truly great television series, though.",5,"The series as a whole: ""Smallville"" is outstanding as a genre show and a television series",1306713600,"05 30,

When smallville first started in 2001 during it's first season run it had clark on krypton as a baby for a brief moment then leave for earth as krypton was being destroyed, thus this show begins clark meets his adopted parents, goes to high school, learns about his powers that was all well and good for it's first 2 seasons but then the 3rd season came out and WTH was that this show managed to culminate into some pile of trash put together in a funnel.Smallville the tv show is an abomination it's not the DC universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this awful tv show, i don't know why smallville is so stupid but it is and i'll explain why. My first annoyance with this show is that there's so many fictional characters who are not at all part of clark's real social circle that a lot of ignorant smallville fans out there believe to be real in the story of superman, the reason i say this is because when you read a lot of smallville blogs written with comments from the fans you'll see a lot of false facts backed up by fans of the show i.e chloe sullivan, whitney, dr. swan and lots more, i could go on and on and not to mention the stupid made up blue and black kryptonite which clearly does not exist in the superman world.Smallville to me was always a messed up version superman's morals and character. As a fan of superman i don't mind certain changes in the story and clark does make mistakes but those mistakes are not that extreme to the point where Clark tried to elope with a pregnant Lana when she was to marry lex. Clark abandoned lois in season 8. He kept pushing lex away constantly when clark always looks for what is best in people. Clark was always depressed and obsessing over lana&#65279; and all that love soap opera jazz garbage that later became this obscenity of a twisted perversion of superman, it felt like i was watching the o.c. or dawson's creek and the irony is that they all came out at the same time all in all i'd say this garbage was not designed for real superman fans at all - horrible main actor, and show all round, Avoid.",1,Smallville's Abomination,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2405,"['beginning', 'had', 'superheroes', 'stood', 'something', 'made', 'impact', 'comics', 'film', 'then', 'suddenly', 'somewhere', 'lines', 'awful', 'garbage', 'excuse', 'show', 'came', 'destroyed', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'best', 'iconic', 'superheroes', 'time', 'be', 'put', 'sliver', 'screens', 'When', 'smallville', 'first', 'started', '2001', 'first', 'season', 'run', 'had', 'clark', 'krypton', 'baby', 'brief', 'moment', 'then', 'leave', 'earth', 'krypton', 'was', 'being', 'destroyed', 'thus', 'show', 'clark', 'meets', 'adopted', 'parents', 'high', 'school', 'powers', 'was', 'well', 'good', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'then', '3rd', 'season', 'came', 'out', 'WTH', 'was', 'show', 'managed', 'culminate', 'pile', 'trash', 'put', 'together', 'funnel.Smallville', 'tv', 'show', 'abomination', 'not', 'DC', 'universe', 'matter', 'have', 'true', 'superman', 'mythology', 'implicated', 'awful', 'tv', 'show', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'smallville', 'so', 'stupid', 'i', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'why', 'first', 'annoyance', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'fictional', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'clark', 'real', 'social', 'circle', 'lot', 'ignorant', 'smallville', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'believe', 'be', 'real', 'story', 'superman', 'reason', 'i', 'say', 'when', 'read', 'lot', 'smallville', 'blogs', 'written', 'comments', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lot', 'false', 'facts', 'backed', 'up', 'fans', 'show', 'i.e', 'chloe', 'sullivan', 'whitney', 'dr.', 'swan', 'lots', 'more', 'i', 'could', 'go', 'not', 'mention', 'stupid', 'made', 'up', 'blue', 'black', 'kryptonite', 'clearly', 'not', 'exist', 'superman', 'world.Smallville', 'was', 'always', 'messed', 'up', 'version', 'superman', 'morals', 'character', 'fan', 'superman', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'certain', 'changes', 'story', 'clark', 'make', 'mistakes', 'mistakes', 'are', 'not', 'extreme', 'point', 'where', 'Clark', 'tried', 'elope', 'pregnant', 'Lana', 'when', 'was', 'marry', 'lex', 'Clark', 'abandoned', 'lois', 'season', '8', 'kept', 'pushing', 'lex', 'away', 'constantly', 'when', 'clark', 'always', 'what', 'best', 'people', 'Clark', 'was', 'always', 'depressed', 'obsessing', 'lana', '65279', 'love', 'soap', 'opera', 'jazz', 'garbage', 'later', 'became', 'obscenity', 'twisted', 'perversion', 'superman', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'o.c', 'dawson', 'creek', 'irony', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'garbage', 'was', 'not', 'designed', 'real', 'superman', 'fans', 'horrible', 'main', 'actor', 'show', 'round', 'Avoid']",Smallville: The Complete Series

1432833,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B004XWLN20,iMike,"[4, 6]","I have read positive and negative reviews of this item.  First I want to address the lack of Blu Ray for this set.  Many fans have expressed disappointment, and the studio has given their reasons (or excuses, depending on your take) for sticking to DVD.  For me, DVD is okay because the Blu Ray player within my PS3 upconverts very well.  The quality is amazing.  Also, I can only imagine how much more this set would cost if it were on Blu Ray.The second thing I want to address is the quality of this package.  It is absolutely astounding.  The set weighs just over nine pounds.  As previously stated the beautiful blue box comes with two beautiful hardcover books within.  Seasons one through five in the first volume and seasons six through ten in volume two.  The discs are redesigned and the pages that hold the discs are full of vibrant scenes from the series.  Additionally there's a beautiful envelope that includes an awesomely detailed episode guide full of color photos as well as a fully produced copy of The Daily Planet.  It actually smells like a newspaper.Many reviewers have expressed dismay at how the discs are held.  This was not really a problem for me because another boxed set I recently purchased from Amazon (the newer Sex And The City Complete Series set, the white set that includes the movies) has its discs held in the same fashion.  I have a recommendation.  Use a Kleenex (to prevent smudging) to remove your discs the first few times you play them. Also, a use a couple of sprays of compressed air to loosen the paper/cardboard sleeves a bit.  This may sound like a bit of a hassle, but you have to consider why you are buying this set and who you are buying it for.  This is not a set for teenagers or children.  This is a set for collectors - adults or teenagers who actually know how to take care of things.  I just received the set today but I have pulled out every disc; there are some minor scratches on four discs but I have a disc repair kit and the scratches aren't deep - so I'm not worried.I am thoroughly impressed with the amount of care the studio put into this set.  Few series get this treatment.  'Sex and the City' received this treatment twice; as previously noted I own the newer white boxed set with the same cardboard disc holders.  'Charmed' is another series that received this treatment, although that set did have problems with its discs (I was one of the lucky ones who did not).  I highly recommend this purchase.  Amazon sells it for $199.00.  I saw it in Target for $249.99.

1432834,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B004XWLN20,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[2, 4]","I do not own this actual product, as I never could have waited 10 years to own the entire Smallville! I of course have purchased them one per year since 2001. But I wanted to review the series as a whole. And this does look like a really nice set. I saw it in the store, and the books and pictures looked really great. I wanted it! Of course, complete series are kind of pointless unless you become a fan in the last season, or are behind on your wish list. On the bright side, I have the Special Edition of Season 8: the limited edition ""steel"" case from Best Buy!Anyway, SMALLVILLE is pretty much my most favorite TV show ever. (It kind of ties with The Golden Girls, I Love Lucy, and All in the Family, but those are comedies, so you can't really compare.) Never have I spent 10 years - a third of my life - devoted to making sure I saw my show every week! Wow, I can't believe it was that long. Smallville drew me in from Season 1 and never let go. I'd watch it another 10 years, now that he's finally Superman, and has all those new adventures at his doorstep! The finale, incidentally, had to be just about the greatest series finale in all of TV history.I started watching Smallville because I was such a huge fan ofLois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Seasons 1-4, which had ended 3 or so years earlier. It is so hard to choose whether Dean Cain or Tom Welling makes a better Clark Kent. They are both just amazing. But SMALLVILLE is definitely my favorite show!!Now, I might make some people mad, but to those of you who are complaining that you already own the individual seasons and will not shell out money for a complete set unless they release it on blu-ray: stop being so spoiled. Yes, blu-ray is a very nice picture. But Smallville on DVD is hardly horrible quality, despite being filmed a ""whole decade ago."" It's filmed beautifully, with amazing acting and more special effects than most TV shows, and even a lot of movies. Even the ONE season that is currently as old as a decade is very high quality.",5,"SMALLVILLE, pretty much the best show ever!",1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2044,"['do', 'not', 'own', 'actual', 'product', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'waited', '10', 'years', 'own', 'entire', 'Smallville', 'course', 'have', 'purchased', 'one', 'year', '2001', 'wanted', 'review', 'series', 'whole', 'look', 'really', 'nice', 'set', 'saw', 'store', 'books', 'pictures', 'looked', 'really', 'great', 'wanted', 'course', 'complete', 'series', 'are', 'kind', 'pointless', 'become', 'fan', 'last', 'season', 'are', 'wish', 'list', 'bright', 'side', 'have', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Season', '8', 'limited', 'edition', 'steel', 'case', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Anyway', 'SMALLVILLE', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'kind', 'ties', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Family', 'are', 'comedies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'Never', 'have', 'spent', '10', 'years', 'third', 'life', 'devoted', 'making', 'sure', 'saw', 'show', 'week', 'Wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'long', 'Smallville', 'drew', 'Season', '1', 'never', 'let', 'go', ""'d"", 'watch', '10', 'years', 'now', 'finally', 'Superman', 'new', 'adventures', 'doorstep', 'finale', 'incidentally', 'had', 'be', 'just', 'greatest', 'series', 'finale', 'TV', 'history.I', 'started', 'watching', 'Smallville', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'fan', 'ofLois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'Complete', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'had', 'ended', '3', 'so', 'years', 'earlier', 'so', 'hard', 'choose', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'better', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'SMALLVILLE', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'show', 'Now', 'might', 'make', 'people', 'mad', 'who', 'are', 'complaining', 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'complete', 'set', 'release', 'blu-ray', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'spoiled', 'Yes', 'blu-ray', 'very', 'nice', 'picture', 'Smallville', 'DVD', 'hardly', 'horrible', 'quality', 'being', 'filmed', 'whole', 'decade', 'ago', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'amazing', 'acting', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'even', 'lot', 'movies', 'Even', 'ONE', 'season', 'currently', 'as', 'old', 'decade', 'very', 'high', 'quality']",Smallville: The Complete Series
1432835,A2ZRP050WD6Q08,B004XWLN20,"JAC ""JAC""","[1, 3]",I won't review the show to me it's a great show and my favorite show but if your reading this then you pretty much know the show Smallville!!!!! This Review is for this release!!!!!I love how they made this with the added exclusive bonus features!!!!!! Inside the box the two book style cases have a lot of pictures from the series and there very good quality pictures!!!!!!!! The Episode guide gives you a complete description of each episode and special features!!!!! The Daily Planet newspaper is also great!!!!! I think the Aquaman Pilot on here was really good I believe it would have made a great series the 1961 Pilot of Superboy was good too shows it on like one of those classic floor model tvs like my grandma used to have!!!!!!Now for the issue I have is with how the DVD's are packaged they are in those book style cases and are in there very tight and it's not easy to get them out if your careful pulling them out the disc won't get damaged but the more you take it out and put it back in you will most certainly scratch the disc!!!!! So I reccomend buying a DVD Binder which doesn't cost very much to put the discs in that way you won't have to worry about the discs getting scratched then just put the box on the shelf as it is !!!!!!! Especially for how much you pay for this box set!!!!!! Now what I did is since the discs are the exact same as the individual releases just they no longer have pictures on the they have the Kryponian images on them but when u load disc it's the exact same!!!!!!! I own all the individual releases but I wanted this box set for extras and exclusive bonus features included!!!!!!!! So what I did was just left my individual relases in their cases butchanged a couple of the cases to be able to fit 7 Discs in the case so that i could put the 2 bonus Discs in there!!!!  I then took the rest of the DVD's out of this box set put them in a DVD binder took the little books out of the individual releases and sold it to a buddy of mine!!!!!!!So if you have the individual releases but u still want this do something like I did!!!!!!

1432836,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B004XWLN20,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[12, 83]","Smallville killed Superman, the creators obviously hated the character and that's why they stay away from him for so many years. And when they finally bring in Superman, he is animated poorly, has just three close up shots, and the scenes with him are incredibly poor renditions of classic Superman events. This is due to the fact that the creators clearly read maybe ten issues of the Superman and hated them so they decided to reboot him as winey teenager who becomes a winey adult and only one time is referred to as Superman. Most of the time he's given a really stupid name called the Blur or he saves people as just Clark. Problem with that is Clark never wears glasses and isn't nerdy to hide his identity. So when Superman arrives everyone knows its Clark.For about half of the series the show is teen drama with small amounts of Superman events, but most of it is just kids wining about their lives and messing up their chances to hook up with each other. The other half of the show delivers a bit more Superman events but ends up giving all the action to Green Arrow. And that doesn't make any sense, everything Green Arrow does is what Clark should have done as Superman. But because Clark doesn't become Superman until the last ten minutes of the last episode, Green Arrow does all the action Clark should have been doing.Or during the season Supergirl shows up, she does all the action Clark should do, but since he's not Superman, Clark doesn't get to do the action.The creators also took it upon themselves to ruin Doomsday. They basically turn his character into a poor version of the Hulk. Doomsday spends most of the time as human who turns into a monster when he gets angry or jealous. And then he kills Jimmy Olson, what kind of Superman world would it be without Jimmy Olson? A stupid one created by people who hated the world of Superman and decided to change it poorly.There is one good episode of the series and that is when the Justice League raid a plant owned by Lex. But that doesn't occur until about halfway through the series. Reason why that episode is good is because they characters finally perform Superman actions and are given a story which is ripped from the comics. And that is interesting story telling, but there are barely any episodes like that in this show. Small amounts of action occur in the last fifteen minutes of a episode and the rest of it is just talking about feelings and have the characters feeling sorry for themselves. Boring, and not Superman at all.Now for those that want to watch good films of Superman and other comic book heroes, check out the animated films from DC Films Animated Studios. The films are done by fans of the comics and they stay true to the characters. Films are released about every six months, they're just under an hour and a half, and end up getting PG-13 ratings because of all the action. You get more action in 80 minutes than in an entire season of Smallville.",1,A Pathetic Version of Superman,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2949,"['Smallville', 'killed', 'Superman', 'creators', 'obviously', 'hated', 'character', 'why', 'stay', 'away', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'finally', 'bring', 'Superman', 'animated', 'poorly', 'just', 'three', 'close', 'shots', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'renditions', 'classic', 'Superman', 'events', 'due', 'fact', 'creators', 'clearly', 'read', 'maybe', 'ten', 'issues', 'Superman', 'hated', 'decided', 'reboot', 'winey', 'teenager', 'who', 'winey', 'adult', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'referred', 'Superman', 'Most', 'time', 'given', 'really', 'stupid', 'name', 'called', 'Blur', 'people', 'just', 'Clark', 'Problem', 'Clark', 'never', 'glasses', ""n't"", 'nerdy', 'hide', 'identity', 'So', 'when', 'Superman', 'everyone', 'Clark.For', 'half', 'series', 'show', 'teen', 'drama', 'small', 'amounts', 'Superman', 'events', 'most', 'just', 'kids', 'wining', 'lives', 'messing', 'up', 'chances', 'hook', 'up', 'other', 'other', 'half', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'Superman', 'events', 'up', 'giving', 'action', 'Green', 'Arrow', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'everything', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'what', 'Clark', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'Superman', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'become', 'Superman', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'action', 'Clark', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'doing.Or', 'season', 'Supergirl', 'up', 'action', 'Clark', 'should', 'do', 'not', 'Superman', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'action.The', 'creators', 'also', 'took', 'ruin', 'Doomsday', 'basically', 'turn', 'character', 'poor', 'version', 'Hulk', 'Doomsday', 'most', 'time', 'human', 'who', 'monster', 'when', 'angry', 'jealous', 'then', 'Jimmy', 'Olson', 'what', 'kind', 'Superman', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'Jimmy', 'Olson', 'stupid', 'one', 'created', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'world', 'Superman', 'decided', 'change', 'poorly.There', 'one', 'good', 'episode', 'series', 'when', 'Justice', 'League', 'raid', 'plant', 'owned', 'Lex', ""n't"", 'occur', 'halfway', 'series', 'Reason', 'why', 'episode', 'good', 'characters', 'finally', 'perform', 'Superman', 'actions', 'are', 'given', 'story', 'ripped', 'comics', 'interesting', 'story', 'telling', 'are', 'barely', 'episodes', 'show', 'Small', 'amounts', 'action', 'occur', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'episode', 'rest', 'just', 'talking', 'feelings', 'have', 'characters', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Boring', 'not', 'Superman', 'all.Now', 'want', 'watch', 'good', 'films', 'Superman', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'check', 'out', 'animated', 'films', 'DC', 'Films', 'Animated', 'Studios', 'films', 'are', 'done', 'fans', 'comics', 'stay', 'true', 'characters', 'Films', 'are', 'released', 'six', 'months', ""'re"", 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'PG-13', 'ratings', 'action', 'get', 'more', 'action', '80', 'minutes', 'entire', 'season', 'Smallville']",Smallville: The Complete Series

1432839,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B004XWLN20,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 4]","Superman has had a tough history leaping off the page onto the big screen and onto the small screen. On top of that small screen adaptations of comic book characters, as well as attempts to create shows in comic book molds, haven't been very successful in recent years. Shows like Birds of Prey, Heroes, The Cape, Aquaman, No Ordinary Family, and Wonder Woman all suffered a grisly fate by the ax of the networks. The fact that Smallville lasted for ten seasons in an era of failing television comic book adaptations is quite surprising.It's even more surprising considering most filmmakers working on the previous Superman movie wanted to shut down production on Smallville. This would have been the fate of Smallville if Tim Burton or McG had their way, and even JJ Abrams was working on a screenplay that rebooted the series and Tom Welling was one of the top choices to take the big screen role. In the end, though, Bryan Singer was cast and allowed the show to remain on the air.This is one of those shows that I remember the first episode I watched. I originally wasn't going to watch the show. The WB, as it was at that time before changing to the CW, was full of preteen and teen melodrama. I didn't expect this to be any different, as a matter of fact I thought it was going to irreverent to the source, so I never tuned in. Then one day when nothing else was on I caught a season 3 episode called ""Velocity"". It was with that episode that my perception of Smallville changed.While it has its moments of teen angst (""Velocity"" itself deals with teenage rebellion) and romance, it does try to remain faithful to the comics. It's even become revered by comic's artists who have added a few of the characters created for the show to the comic's lexicon, and a few writers have even shown up to pen episodes such as Geoff Johns. Even when hitting the moments of teen angst and romance the choice of using a young Clark coming to grips with who he is makes since.What really caught me with Smallville, though, was the handling of the mythology; in this aspect the 2nd and 3rd seasons remain my favorites. The show delicately handled the growth and development of Clark's powers (in an interesting use of metaphor, ""Heat"" sees Clark developing his legendary heat vision at the sight of a beautiful woman). It was the handling of Clark and Lex Luthor's relationship that I found really interesting though.They're relationship starts in the show when Lex drives his Porsche over the edge of a bridge narrowly missing Clark. Clark dives in after him, rips the car open, and saves Lex from drowning. What comes of that is an uneasy friendship. Lex suspects Clark of being more than a farm boy from Kansas and Clark constantly has to cover up his powers. Eventually this turns into a game of suspicions and betrayal before finally diving headlong into abject hatred.All of this worked because the casting was impeccable. Tom Welling grew as an actor throughout the series, taking the helm to direct a few episodes. He also had that quality that embodies the qualities of the character we've grown to affectionately call ""the big blue boy scout."" Michael Rosenbaum oozes duplicity as Lex, making you question his every move and motive. In my opinion, even over Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey, Rosenbaum has portrayed the best version of Lex Luthor to hit the small or big screen.Unfortunately, after the third season, the producers felt things had gotten too dark and felt the show needed to lighten up a bit. The result was that the fourth season became easily the weakest season in the series taking more cues from Charmed than the Superman canon. Luckily, they bounced back in the fifth season and the show remained strong for the rest of its run (although I'm sure I won't get any arguments when I say that the season 8 finale was quite anticlimactic).5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",5,Smallville: The Complete Series,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,3927,"['Superman', 'had', 'tough', 'history', 'leaping', 'off', 'page', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'screen', 'top', 'small', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'attempts', 'create', 'shows', 'comic', 'book', 'molds', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'recent', 'years', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'Heroes', 'Cape', 'Aquaman', 'No', 'Ordinary', 'Family', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'all', 'suffered', 'grisly', 'fate', 'ax', 'networks', 'fact', 'Smallville', 'lasted', 'ten', 'seasons', 'era', 'failing', 'television', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'quite', 'surprising.It', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'considering', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'working', 'previous', 'Superman', 'movie', 'wanted', 'shut', 'down', 'production', 'Smallville', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fate', 'Smallville', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'McG', 'had', 'way', 'even', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'was', 'working', 'screenplay', 'rebooted', 'series', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'choices', 'take', 'big', 'screen', 'role', 'end', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'was', 'cast', 'allowed', 'show', 'remain', 'air.This', 'one', 'shows', 'remember', 'first', 'episode', 'watched', 'originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'watch', 'show', 'WB', 'was', 'time', 'changing', 'CW', 'was', 'full', 'preteen', 'teen', 'melodrama', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'different', 'matter', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'irreverent', 'source', 'never', 'tuned', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'caught', 'season', '3', 'episode', 'called', 'Velocity', 'was', 'episode', 'perception', 'Smallville', 'changed.While', 'moments', 'teen', 'angst', 'Velocity', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'romance', 'try', 'remain', 'faithful', 'comics', 'even', 'become', 'revered', 'comic', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'added', 'few', 'characters', 'created', 'show', 'comic', 'lexicon', 'few', 'writers', 'have', 'even', 'shown', 'up', 'pen', 'episodes', 'such', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Even', 'when', 'hitting', 'moments', 'teen', 'angst', 'romance', 'choice', 'using', 'young', 'Clark', 'coming', 'grips', 'who', 'since.What', 'really', 'caught', 'Smallville', 'though', 'was', 'handling', 'mythology', 'aspect', '2nd', '3rd', 'seasons', 'remain', 'favorites', 'show', 'delicately', 'handled', 'growth', 'development', 'Clark', 'powers', 'interesting', 'use', 'metaphor', 'Heat', 'sees', 'Clark', 'developing', 'legendary', 'heat', 'vision', 'sight', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'was', 'handling', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'relationship', 'found', 'really', 'interesting', 'though.They', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'starts', 'show', 'when', 'Lex', 'Porsche', 'edge', 'bridge', 'narrowly', 'missing', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'car', 'open', 'saves', 'Lex', 'drowning', 'What', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'being', 'more', 'farm', 'boy', 'Kansas', 'Clark', 'constantly', 'cover', 'up', 'powers', 'Eventually', 'game', 'suspicions', 'betrayal', 'finally', 'diving', 'headlong', 'abject', 'hatred.All', 'worked', 'casting', 'was', 'impeccable', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'grew', 'actor', 'series', 'taking', 'helm', 'direct', 'few', 'episodes', 'also', 'had', 'quality', 'qualities', 'character', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'affectionately', 'call', 'big', 'blue', 'boy', 'scout', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'duplicity', 'Lex', 'making', 'question', 'move', 'motive', 'opinion', 'even', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Rosenbaum', 'portrayed', 'best', 'version', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'hit', 'small', 'big', 'screen.Unfortunately', 'third', 'season', 'producers', 'felt', 'things', 'had', 'gotten', 'too', 'dark', 'felt', 'show', 'needed', 'lighten', 'up', 'bit', 'result', 'was', 'fourth', 'season', 'became', 'easily', 'weakest', 'season', 'series', 'taking', 'more', 'cues', 'Charmed', 'Superman', 'canon', 'Luckily', 'bounced', 'back', 'fifth', 'season', 'show', 'remained', 'strong', 'rest', 'run', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'arguments', 'when', 'say', 'season', '8', 'finale', 'was', 'quite', 'anticlimactic', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",Smallville: The Complete Series

For over two hundred dollars, there shouldn't be a single scratch on any disc surface.  Sadly, this is not the case.  About half the discs in my set have scratches, from minor to moderate.  Fortunately they all play, but I spent over FOUR hours hand buffing said scratches.  Luckily, I know what I'm doing.  Warner Brothers should have done a recall on this set.  One of my pet peeves is how poorly manufacturers treat the all important disc surface.  I have yet to encounter a nick on the label side of any disc from any purchase, but far too often disc surfaces look like they've been used for roller skating.  This could have been a nice set, but the packaging is sadly deficient.  And I am concerned that the label side with the disc numbers are imprinted on the discs in such a way that you can actually see the numbers on the reverse side by holding them up to the light.  I hope this ""bleed over"" does not cause playback problems in the future.  Manufacturers, quit trying to be so fancy.  Just give us unscratched discs in simple packing that's easy to access.

1432841,AIBSC3DOO3UHR,B004XWLN20,"John B. Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[9, 18]","As this is a review of the show, and not a DVD vs Blu-Ray rant, be warned that spoilers will be present.The feel and format of Smallville transformed over the years.The first seasons' plots focused on Clark learning how to deal with his developing powers, learning about his origins, and dealing with the ""freak of the week"" (title unofficially given the latest ""meteor rock"" infected local) and the other effects caused by the massive amounts of kryptonite in the area.The show then switches focus to prophesy. There are Native American prophesies about the coming of Superman, occult proficies about him, secret societies looking for his arrival and the means to control him, etc.The last few seasons did away with the ""freak of week"" and the prophesies in exchange for story arcs based on actual comic book villians such as Doomsday, Zod, and Darkseid.The series also started out with a lighter feel in the beginning and slowly got darker and darker as the series progressed.What worked:- Clark learning to cope with and control each new power as it developed- The relationship between Clark and Lex. It many ways, it was more interesting to see Lex's decent from friend and ally to villian.- Introduction/guest shots of variouos other super heroes and villians.- The moral grounding that Jonathon Kent gave to the program. (Both Clark's character and the show suffered from the loss of Jonathon Kent).- The help Clark received from the small circle of friends who knew about his powers. (I am mostly referring to Pete and Chloe in the earlier seasons. Then it worked as friends who had his back. As that circle got larger and larger, it felt as if there were less and less meaning behind it.)What did NOT work:- Lana. She was fine in the beginning as the girl young Clark has a crush on, but it was drawn out far too long. Her character became a cruch for the writers who kept going back to the ""will they/won't they"" scenerio, even as late into the program as season 8, after Clark had already started a relationship with Lois. She should have been regulated to ""just friends"" status back around season 4. Season 5's ""Reckoning"" was a perfect time to cement the fact that Lana was not ""the One"". After Clark proposed, the writer's should have had her unable to be able to deal with the fact that he is an alien. Instead, they went with the tired ""let's change things with time travel"" nonsense.- Clark does not fly. This was fine when he was still in highschool, but it became rediculous when Supergirl was added, and could fly. When Zod could fly within moments of getting his powers. And when other Kryptonians are flying within seconds of getting their powers. Ten years of Clark not being able to figure it out is far too long. (I know that the creaters had a ""no tights/no flights"" policy, but the the show outgrew at least the flights part of that policy by the 6th season.)- Replacing Lex with Tess.- Clark is too wishy washy throughout the series with the inability to make decisions.- The show became far too dark, both in feel and film. Superman is supposed to be bright and uplifting stories about good triumphing over evil. By the end, ""good"" feels like its been wallowing about in the muck right beside evil as the character interaction between the good guys devolved into a ""who is sleeping with who"" senerio.- The final payoff, the ""birth"" of Superman, felt weak as well. Almost nothing was seen of Superman and he did not dispell the darkness by the ""light"" of his example, but by simply pushing the planet away. There were other loose strings that it seemed that the writers noticed at the last minute and just rushed to tie up, like Lex needing to be Clark's greatest enemy.In conclusion, this is a series that had a tremendous amount of potential, but much of that potential is squandered.",2,Drawn out over too many seasons,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,3813,"['review', 'show', 'not', 'DVD', 'vs', 'Blu-Ray', 'rant', 'be', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'will', 'be', 'present.The', 'feel', 'format', 'Smallville', 'transformed', 'years.The', 'first', 'seasons', 'plots', 'focused', 'Clark', 'learning', 'how', 'deal', 'developing', 'powers', 'learning', 'origins', 'dealing', 'freak', 'week', 'title', 'unofficially', 'given', 'latest', 'meteor', 'rock', 'infected', 'local', 'other', 'effects', 'caused', 'massive', 'amounts', 'kryptonite', 'area.The', 'show', 'then', 'focus', 'prophesy', 'are', 'Native', 'American', 'prophesies', 'coming', 'Superman', 'occult', 'proficies', 'secret', 'societies', 'looking', 'arrival', 'means', 'control', 'etc.The', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'did', 'away', 'freak', 'week', 'prophesies', 'exchange', 'story', 'arcs', 'based', 'actual', 'comic', 'book', 'villians', 'such', 'Doomsday', 'Zod', 'Darkseid.The', 'series', 'also', 'started', 'out', 'lighter', 'feel', 'beginning', 'slowly', 'got', 'darker', 'darker', 'series', 'progressed.What', 'worked', 'Clark', 'learning', 'cope', 'control', 'new', 'power', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'Lex', 'decent', 'friend', 'ally', 'villian.-', 'Introduction/guest', 'shots', 'variouos', 'other', 'super', 'heroes', 'villians.-', 'moral', 'grounding', 'Jonathon', 'Kent', 'gave', 'program', 'Clark', 'character', 'show', 'suffered', 'loss', 'Jonathon', 'Kent', '.-', 'help', 'Clark', 'received', 'small', 'circle', 'friends', 'who', 'knew', 'powers', 'am', 'mostly', 'referring', 'Pete', 'Chloe', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Then', 'worked', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'back', 'circle', 'got', 'larger', 'larger', 'felt', 'were', 'less', 'less', 'meaning', 'What', 'did', 'NOT', 'work', 'Lana', 'was', 'fine', 'beginning', 'girl', 'young', 'Clark', 'crush', 'was', 'drawn', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'character', 'became', 'cruch', 'writers', 'who', 'kept', 'going', 'back', 'will', 'they/wo', ""n't"", 'scenerio', 'even', 'late', 'program', 'season', '8', 'Clark', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'regulated', 'just', 'friends', 'status', 'back', 'season', '4', 'Season', '5', 'Reckoning', 'was', 'perfect', 'time', 'cement', 'fact', 'Lana', 'was', 'not', 'One', 'Clark', 'proposed', 'writer', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'unable', 'be', 'able', 'deal', 'fact', 'alien', 'Instead', 'went', 'tired', 'let', 'change', 'things', 'time', 'travel', 'nonsense.-', 'Clark', 'not', 'fly', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'highschool', 'became', 'rediculous', 'when', 'Supergirl', 'was', 'added', 'could', 'fly', 'When', 'Zod', 'could', 'fly', 'moments', 'getting', 'powers', 'when', 'other', 'Kryptonians', 'are', 'flying', 'seconds', 'getting', 'powers', 'Ten', 'years', 'Clark', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'know', 'creaters', 'had', 'tights/no', 'flights', 'policy', 'show', 'outgrew', 'least', 'flights', 'part', 'policy', '6th', 'season', 'Replacing', 'Lex', 'Tess.-', 'Clark', 'too', 'wishy', 'washy', 'series', 'inability', 'make', 'decisions.-', 'show', 'became', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'feel', 'film', 'Superman', 'supposed', 'be', 'bright', 'uplifting', 'stories', 'good', 'triumphing', 'evil', 'end', 'good', 'feels', 'been', 'wallowing', 'about', 'muck', 'right', 'beside', 'evil', 'character', 'interaction', 'good', 'guys', 'devolved', 'who', 'sleeping', 'who', 'senerio.-', 'final', 'payoff', 'birth', 'Superman', 'felt', 'weak', 'well', 'Almost', 'nothing', 'was', 'seen', 'Superman', 'did', 'not', 'dispell', 'darkness', 'light', 'example', 'simply', 'pushing', 'planet', 'away', 'were', 'other', 'loose', 'strings', 'seemed', 'writers', 'noticed', 'last', 'minute', 'just', 'rushed', 'tie', 'up', 'Lex', 'needing', 'be', 'Clark', 'greatest', 'enemy.In', 'conclusion', 'series', 'had', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'potential', 'much', 'potential', 'squandered']",Smallville: The Complete Series

Most TV series now a days, barely make it through their first seasons and the lucky ones last 2 or 3 seasons tops. Back on October 16th 2001, no one was prepared for ""Smallville"".

As soon as those meteors swept across the screen and took Smallville by storm, we knew we were in store for one hell of a series! Throughout it's 10 seasons, Smallville has had some truly incredible moments within some iconic, amazing episodes as well as some no so incredible moments will some of the most awful, embarrassing and plot stalling episodes. But despite all the ups and downs throughout the series' 10 year run, Smallville has become the longest running sci-fi/comic book superhero series in history, so it was obviously doing something right....right? Well, here is the Smallville: The Complete Series Boxset.

1432850,AUDGV1OWJMOYD,B004XWLN20,"Linda ""Linda Cameron""","[20, 25]","There are very few movies or TV shows I watch more than once but now that I am almost finished with the 218 episodes of Smallville, I do plan on watching them all again, maybe next summer, if I can wait that long.As a kid and teenager, I used to buy all the Superman/Superboy/Supergirl/Batman, etc. comic books I could get my hands on, so I am pretty familiar with the story of Superboy and Superman. The comics are a bit different than what Smallville has come up with, but I love the way this was handled.It is exciting and fun to watch Clark Kent discovering his powers one by one and becoming the highly moral, selfless hero that Superman is. I like that he has his parents and friends all there to support and help him when he isn't saving them. It is also quite funny to see all the inside jokes and references to other Superman TV shows or comics. I find it funny also that Clark Kent is afraid to fly even now that I am halfway into season 10.I approve of the way Clark Kent dresses now that he is practicing as being a hero. I always cringed to see Superman wearing those tights and briefs with the cape. That red, blue and yellow costume looks ridiculous. Clark dresses in darker colors with the big S on his chest. So far I have not actually understood what the S is supposed to stand for. It is his family symbol from Krypton, but why an S?I have found many things I can criticize over the 10 seasons, but not enough to make me stop watching this show. I don't like that the genres are always getting mixed together. In one episode, Lana Lang becomes a vampire. That was almost enough to make me say ""forget it!"" but luckily, that didn't last. I also think it is a bit strange that Clark is always being told how he is supposed to be the greatest savior this world has ever known. That seems to be putting him on an equal footing with spiritual masters and it doesn't make any sense because there are so many other people in this series with super powers including a bunch of Kryptonians at some point. For a guy who is supposedly almost invulnerable, he is constantly getting the (bleep) kicked out of him. I also didn't care for the season where Lana Lang moves in with Lex Luther and then marries him. It made me not like her although she wasn't evil, she was protecting Clark.Tom Welling is about the perfect actor to play Clark Kent/Superman. He has the looks and the build. Besides being good looking, he can be the good boy, Clark and the bad boy, Dark Clark (when he is affected by Red Kryptonite). He does a convincing job either way.The funny thing is that I never watched this show the whole time it was running, but as soon as it ended, I got hooked! I am glad I waited until it was on DVD because it is such a pleasure to watch all of the episodes without any commercials or TV icons on the screen as we see with TV shows all the time now. Also, it would have driven me nuts to have to wait from the season cliffhangers to the next season.",5,I am going to watch them all again,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,2964,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'now', 'am', 'almost', 'finished', '218', 'episodes', 'Smallville', 'do', 'plan', 'watching', 'again', 'maybe', 'next', 'summer', 'can', 'wait', 'kid', 'teenager', 'used', 'buy', 'Superman/Superboy/Supergirl/Batman', 'etc', 'comic', 'books', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'am', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'story', 'Superboy', 'Superman', 'comics', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'Smallville', 'come', 'up', 'love', 'way', 'was', 'handled.It', 'exciting', 'fun', 'watch', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'discovering', 'powers', 'one', 'one', 'becoming', 'highly', 'moral', 'selfless', 'hero', 'Superman', 'like', 'parents', 'there', 'support', 'help', 'when', ""n't"", 'saving', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'see', 'inside', 'jokes', 'references', 'other', 'Superman', 'TV', 'shows', 'comics', 'find', 'also', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'afraid', 'fly', 'even', 'now', 'am', 'halfway', 'season', '10.I', 'approve', 'way', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'now', 'practicing', 'being', 'hero', 'always', 'cringed', 'see', 'Superman', 'wearing', 'tights', 'briefs', 'cape', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'costume', 'ridiculous', 'Clark', 'darker', 'colors', 'big', 'S', 'chest', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'actually', 'understood', 'what', 'S', 'supposed', 'stand', 'family', 'symbol', 'Krypton', 'why', 'S', 'have', 'found', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'criticize', '10', 'seasons', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'stop', 'watching', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'genres', 'are', 'always', 'getting', 'mixed', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'vampire', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'say', 'forget', 'luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'also', 'think', 'bit', 'strange', 'Clark', 'always', 'being', 'told', 'how', 'supposed', 'be', 'greatest', 'savior', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'be', 'putting', 'equal', 'footing', 'spiritual', 'masters', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'series', 'super', 'powers', 'including', 'bunch', 'Kryptonians', 'point', 'guy', 'who', 'supposedly', 'almost', 'invulnerable', 'constantly', 'getting', 'bleep', 'kicked', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'season', 'where', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'then', 'made', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'evil', 'was', 'protecting', 'Clark.Tom', 'Welling', 'perfect', 'actor', 'play', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'looks', 'build', 'being', 'good', 'looking', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'boy', 'Clark', 'bad', 'boy', 'Dark', 'Clark', 'when', 'affected', 'Red', 'Kryptonite', 'convincing', 'job', 'way.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'running', 'as', 'soon', 'ended', 'got', 'hooked', 'am', 'glad', 'waited', 'was', 'DVD', 'such', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'episodes', 'commercials', 'TV', 'icons', 'screen', 'see', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'now', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'nuts', 'have', 'wait', 'season', 'cliffhangers', 'next', 'season']",Smallville: The Complete Series
1432851,AFPR2BY85DFAD,B004XWLN20,Long Time Home Theater Guy,"[58, 75]","Given that HD versions of Seasons 1-4 episodes already exist for purchase or rental on Amazon Video on Demand (as well as Netflix, etc.), Warner's claim that the special effects during these seasons were produced in standard definition only and not up to Blu-ray full capabilities, doesn't really hold water.  The HD versions have already been produced and exist to master the Blu-rays from limiting Warner's additional production costs.My system includes the latest Panasonic 65"" 3D plasma display (Pioneer SC-37 7.1 AV Receiver; JBL L-880's) and video collection features Blu-ray & HD-DVD copies of seasons 5-9 (10's on order).  I have also viewed seasons 1 through 4 on DVD (along with several HD episodes using VOD) and once beyond about the start of season two, the video reproduction is actually quite good.  Not Blu-ray resolution and color depth, but better than I have seen in many other DVD's of TV programs I own.  In regards to the visual special effects, even on the latest season Blu-rays, Smallville's TV sized production budget shows in most shots.  In fact, some of the effects shots being used in the later seasons date back to the very earliest episodes (i.e. night shot of the Daily Planet building with the helicopter flying down and then existing screen left) so I am not sure why Warner is concerned we would be disappointed in the Blu-ray results now.The Blu-rays would also offer the benefits of lossless audio which with some of the very impressive sound tracks this series has produced would really be missed on the DVD's.  If Warner were to invest the extra money now to make this package available in Blu-ray in today's dollars, I suspect the potential exists for this series to be a very long term profit center with little future costs.  I understand that there will be a difference in the quality as the seasons progress if they were to produce seasons 1-4 in HD to go along with their existing HD masters available for seasons 5-10 but considering how poor other series (i.e. Six Million Dollar Man) vary in quality not only from season to season on DVD, but from episode to episode as well in the same year, I'm not sure Warner can use the excuse of low resolution visual effects as an excuse in this case.Please include on the packaging (external & internal) noting the fact as many prior disc issues have already done and I suspect the vast majority of the buyers will understand the limitation you had to work from.  The reduced number of Blu-ray discs and their smaller number of masters needed (instead of 62 DVD's) for a complete collection should also help to offset the higher Blu-ray production costs.Warner, there's still time and from the studio that has produced some really memorial Blu-rays (i.e. Blade Runner) for my collection, I hope that you will produce what your customers are wanting to buy.  The price is certainly high enough to justify the effort and in the end, isn't that how a business model succeeds.QUICK FIRST VIEWING IMPRESSION UPDATE:  November 29, 2011Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release ofSmallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray] in addition to or in lieu of purchasingSmallville: The Complete Series.  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode ""Finale"" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.Smallville: The Complete Seriesultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode ""Homecoming""), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either theSmallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the SD seasons included in the complete series were double dipped as the extras on theSmallville: The Complete Seriesappear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.",5,"Blu-rays should be highly feasble/1st DVD Viewing Impressions Nov 29, 2011",1303948800,"04 28,

This show obviously never followed the original Superman mythology and took liberties with various events and characters in Clark Kent's life. I for one, never cared about that fact. Unlike many others I saw this show as a means for entertainment, I never expected a biopic of Clark Kent or Superman's life. Another positive aspect of this show is that it was able to help bridge the distance between everyone regardless of whether they were a follower of the Superman/DC universe or not. Normally I never buy a DVD, especially of a television show. However, I actually purchased both a digital and the DVD set's from all 10 seasons.

1432866,A2HRY9WK9T3RUX,B004XWLN20,P. Gilbert,"[1, 2]","First, about the packaging. So many reviewers complained that I was worried this would be an issue. Although the packaging is atypical, its design does not damage the disks. I actually tore the package when extracting the first disk because of the cautions raised by reviewers. However, I learned how to extract and replace the disks easily with no damage. I pull the disk up 1/4 to 1/2 inch until it seems to get stuck. Then, using tissue between by fingers for a good grip and to avoid leaving skin oils on the disk, I pull firmly straight up and the disk pops right out with no visible damage. In the end, the packaging design works just fine but an insert with some pointers might have been helpful to those of us so familiar with regular DVD packaging.Second, the media quality. Using a PS3 into a 55-inch Bravia, with digital audio from the PS3 to the sound system provides amazing video and audio quality considering how old Season 1 is. Most shows that old are not released on DVD in widescreen. The PS3 upscaling has this 11+ year old episode looking almost as good as Blu-Ray.Third, the story. Season 1 is an outstanding treatment of the classic Superboy saga, and has great backing music. I recall my frustration as the seasons advanced that the story really didn't, and finally quit watching the show. A couple years ago, I learned that it was still on -- in its 10th and last season! And that there was going to be a 10-season release. I decided to buy the set because I haven't seen that last 5 seasons, and because I'm running out of good TV to buy.So far, just into Season 2, everything about it gets 5 stars. July 13, 2012Well, it's Oct 22, 2012, and I finished the series yesterday. Baseball season, ya know.I had to subtract one star for the decline in writing, mostly in the last season.He doesn't ""put on the suit and fly"" until the very very end, which I guess was the intention -- to show the 10-year evolution of how horned-rimmed-glasses-wearing-mild-mannered reporter versus ""up in the sky"" SuperMan situation came to be.It could be titled ""The Long and Untold Story of SuperBoy"", or as I felt in many of the episodes, ""Clueless Clark"".HOWEVER -- I was impressed through many of the episodes in the middle seasons how well the stories, dialogue, imagery, etc could have been so easily transferred to an actual comic book. This was very well-done and I even thought of looking for a 200-set of Smallville in comic book form.The exception(s), as another reviewer points out, is all the teenage whining dialogue in the early episodes, and then again toward the end, all the drawn out sappy dialogue -- much of it romantic -- which lost that ""comic book"" feel which pervaded the series so well for so long.And kudos to Allison Mack for being Clark's brains -- as Chloe -- most of the time. The voice of reason in almost every story.Overall, I enjoyed the series more than I thought I would, given that I quit watching it on-air when the Jane Seymour sequence seemed to diverge from the story too much.Media: The video and audio quality throughout all the seasons was impeccable for a TV show.

And I wanted this awesome-looking collector's set so badly that I sold my seasons one through nine, some textbooks, etc. just to have money for it.In the long run, I kind of regret doing that.Here's the short version: If you already own seasons one through nine, do yourself a favor and just buy season ten. This big set, unfortunately, is not worth it.Here's the long version: While the set looks beautiful, it's not practical. Each DVD is tightly (and I mean TIGHTLY) held in place by cardboard dividers. You literally have to pry out some of the DVDs from between two slats of cardboard. Obviously, this leaves some pretty heavy scratches. One of my DVDs looks like I set it on the floor, put my foot on top of it, and did the hokey pokey. The fronts of the DVDs look great, each season represented by a different Kryptonian symbol that die-hard fans will recognize. However, the DVDs are packed SO TIGHTLY that, sometimes, the symbols (and even the big shiny silver disc numbers) are rubbed off. This only happened to a couple of my discs, but it was sad to see.Another thing I'm disappointed by: Despite the cool new look of these DVDs, they are the SAME DVDs from the previous sets. Same menu layout, same opening montage, everything. I thought we'd get something a little more fresh, but I was wrong.The big books which hold the DVDs are neat, but their coolness only lasts as long as it takes for you to look at each panel. Same goes for the production notes and newspaper. They're really nice, but they don't make up for the horrible disc storage. I decided to store my Smallville DVDs in a DVD binder so that I never have to subject them to cardboard ever again.And the special features... leave much to be desired. I was really looking forward to some insights and information that I had never heard before. What was it like making the show? What were some of the biggest challenges? What kinds of things did DC prevent the producers from doing? Audition tapes, script changes, etc.At first, it seems the retrospective might go in that direction. But the more you watch it, the more you realize that this is really a look back on the different plot points in the show. The actors really say very little. Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson basically run down memory lane, discussing almost every plot element season by season, except (of course) the really bad ones (Super Lana, anyone?).To summarize, it's nice to have these special features and the really cool box set, but the best features are actually packaged with the seasons themselves. In the long run, you're spending two hundred bucks for a set of cardboard boxes, a cheesy newspaper, and documentaries with about as much information as those CW web videos.Sadly, Smallville: The Complete Series is not so super after all.",3,Review of the ACTUAL box set,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,2843,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'SV', 'fan', 'Been', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'wanted', 'awesome-looking', 'collector', 'set', 'so', 'badly', 'sold', 'seasons', 'one', 'nine', 'textbooks', 'etc', 'just', 'have', 'money', 'it.In', 'long', 'run', 'kind', 'regret', 'doing', 'short', 'version', 'already', 'own', 'seasons', 'one', 'nine', 'do', 'favor', 'just', 'buy', 'season', 'ten', 'big', 'set', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'worth', 'it.Here', 'long', 'version', 'set', 'beautiful', 'not', 'practical', 'DVD', 'tightly', 'mean', 'TIGHTLY', 'held', 'place', 'cardboard', 'dividers', 'literally', 'have', 'pry', 'out', 'DVDs', 'two', 'slats', 'cardboard', 'Obviously', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'scratches', 'One', 'DVDs', 'set', 'floor', 'put', 'foot', 'top', 'did', 'hokey', 'pokey', 'fronts', 'DVDs', 'look', 'great', 'season', 'represented', 'different', 'Kryptonian', 'symbol', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'However', 'DVDs', 'are', 'packed', 'SO', 'TIGHTLY', 'sometimes', 'symbols', 'even', 'big', 'shiny', 'silver', 'disc', 'numbers', 'are', 'rubbed', 'off', 'only', 'happened', 'couple', 'discs', 'was', 'sad', 'see.Another', 'thing', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'cool', 'new', 'look', 'DVDs', 'are', 'SAME', 'DVDs', 'previous', 'sets', 'Same', 'menu', 'layout', 'same', 'opening', 'montage', 'everything', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'fresh', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'big', 'books', 'hold', 'DVDs', 'are', 'neat', 'coolness', 'only', 'as', 'long', 'look', 'panel', 'Same', 'production', 'notes', 'newspaper', ""'re"", 'really', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'disc', 'storage', 'decided', 'store', 'Smallville', 'DVDs', 'DVD', 'binder', 'never', 'have', 'subject', 'cardboard', 'ever', 'special', 'features', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'insights', 'information', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'What', 'was', 'making', 'show', 'What', 'were', 'biggest', 'challenges', 'What', 'things', 'did', 'DC', 'prevent', 'producers', 'doing', 'Audition', 'tapes', 'script', 'changes', 'etc.At', 'first', 'retrospective', 'might', 'go', 'direction', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'realize', 'really', 'look', 'back', 'different', 'plot', 'points', 'show', 'actors', 'really', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'Kelly', 'Souders', 'Brian', 'Peterson', 'basically', 'run', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'discussing', 'almost', 'plot', 'element', 'season', 'season', 'course', 'really', 'bad', 'ones', 'Super', 'Lana', 'anyone', '.To', 'summarize', 'nice', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'cool', 'box', 'set', 'best', 'features', 'are', 'actually', 'packaged', 'seasons', 'long', 'run', ""'re"", 'spending', 'two', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'set', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'cheesy', 'newspaper', 'documentaries', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'CW', 'web', 'videos.Sadly', 'Smallville', 'Complete', 'Series', 'not', 'so', 'super']",Smallville: The Complete Series

It has been an incredible journey spanning 10 wonderful years, and I am honored to have been a part of it all. I'm proud to have seen every single episode and to have shared in the iconic moments big and small. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.Sadly, those of you who are waiting and hoping for a Blu-ray release will more than likely be disappointed. It does not appear they have plans to release the series in that format. Some people (like myself) feel that the Blu-ray format will eventually go the way of HD DVD's. Some people feel Blu-ray technology is here to stay. Regardless of your opinion, I don't think DC will go through the trouble (or expense) to convert Seasons 1-4, which were only released in standard def, or Season 5, which was presented in HD-DVD format during it's short time on this earth.I think this standard disc set will be fabulous no matter what. Aside from good transfer quality, I feel that features are what matter most, and this is filled with hours upon hours of exclusive features. And to those of you who have never watched the standard DVD's, let me tell you -they look amazing! I did have a PS3 at one time, so I've seen them in Blu-ray as well as standard, and with an upconverting standard DVD player, the quality isn't too terribly different.All that being said, however, I do wish the box was a little more creative (in the shape of the Fortress of Solitude would have been nice, or maybe even Kal El's ship). I am willing to put that aside to enjoy all the great features that we are being given. This collection will live happily on my DVD shelf between Smallville, Season 10 and The Adventures of Superman - Season 1.Any person who considers themselves a serious fan of Smallville should add this set to their collection, no matter what format it's in.

1432879,A3EIEJU7PBB8A2,B004XWLN20,The House of El,"[6, 7]","Having been a big fan of Superman since the age of 5 I was very happy when the announced that they would be making a TV series detailing Clark Kents life before becoming Superman. It was never thoroughly addressed in the comics other than he discovered his powers at a young age so getting to see it all in action was amazing. The series had its ups and downs (the negatives were absolutely horrendous and almost caused me to stop watching about 5 weeks into season 9)but I stuck with it and was overall pleased with the series as a whole and the way it ended. I know some people complain that it was too ""modern"" and made Superman too human but that is what I liked about it, they showed that he's not just some omnipotent ruler but that he actually understands why humans are the way they are. Adding that human compassionate side (granted he was always considerate of humans) really added some depth to the character.Enough about my thoughts on the show though, you all want to know about the box, is it worth the money? While that answer is a bit complicated...all 10 seasons with 2 bonus discs totaling around 10,000 minutes of TV. A lot of bonus features, some that were not included with the individual releases, providing some interesting facts about the series. Let's get right down to it though, as far as complete boxes go this one is awesome BUT is mainly for avid fans of Superman or just Smallville in general; casual fans should avoid this and I will explain why in a moment. Upon first opening the box I was ecstatic to see images from the series plastering each ""page"" of the DVD books. The episode guide and especially the full issue of the Daily Planet (yup, a miniature replica Daily Planet news paper) were a very nice tough but this is where the box leaves me pretty disappointed; as with everyone else I too have noticed the discs are jammed a bit too tightly in the wedges of the book pages. If you do not remove the discs very carefully (I mean VERY carefully and slowly) you risk peeling the disc labels, scratching the disc, or both. That is the particular reason I say casual fans should avoid. A big fan such as myself may be able to overlook this problem but for someone who just wants to watch the series will probably not want to struggle and risk damaging the discs especially when they paid so much ($170 when I ordered). The easiest way to avoid this problem, besides downloading the series somewhere, is to have extra case(s) on hand. When you pull out a disc to watch, rather than slipping it back in the big box, stick it in a standard DVD case till you're done and repeat the process for all the discs. This way hear you are not pulling out or putting back the discs as frequently and you lessen the chance of damaging them.Bottom Line:Awesome show, every comic fan needs to watch this at least once. In my opinion (that of a huge Superman fan for 20yrs now) I can't recommend this to anyone but the other diehards out there who are obsessive about their collections. The problem of the discs being damaged rather easily (quite a few of mine have some pretty noticeable scratches after being removed only once...I always make sure to check any and all DVDs/Blu-Rays I buy for disc defects before doing anything else) is just too frustrating and will leave many people wishing they had just bought the single season sets instead. I'm now left with the task of checking each disc, episode by episode and feature by feature, for any errors caused by these scratches and scuffs. A task I will enjoy so long as no issues arise...if I do have an issue it may be too late to return it to Amazon and that would be an absolute shame.I hope this review has proven useful.",4,Lengthy but informative review.,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3700,"['Having', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Superman', 'age', '5', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'announced', 'would', 'be', 'making', 'TV', 'series', 'detailing', 'Clark', 'Kents', 'life', 'becoming', 'Superman', 'was', 'never', 'thoroughly', 'addressed', 'comics', 'other', 'discovered', 'powers', 'young', 'age', 'so', 'getting', 'see', 'action', 'was', 'amazing', 'series', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'negatives', 'were', 'absolutely', 'horrendous', 'almost', 'caused', 'stop', 'watching', '5', 'weeks', 'season', '9', 'stuck', 'was', 'overall', 'pleased', 'series', 'whole', 'way', 'ended', 'know', 'people', 'complain', 'was', 'too', 'modern', 'made', 'Superman', 'too', 'human', 'what', 'liked', 'showed', 'not', 'just', 'omnipotent', 'ruler', 'actually', 'why', 'humans', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'Adding', 'human', 'compassionate', 'side', 'granted', 'was', 'always', 'considerate', 'humans', 'really', 'added', 'depth', 'character.Enough', 'thoughts', 'show', 'want', 'know', 'box', 'money', 'answer', 'bit', 'complicated', '10', 'seasons', '2', 'bonus', 'discs', 'totaling', 'around', '10,000', 'minutes', 'TV', 'lot', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'individual', 'releases', 'providing', 'interesting', 'facts', 'series', 'Let', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'though', 'as', 'far', 'complete', 'boxes', 'go', 'one', 'awesome', 'BUT', 'mainly', 'avid', 'fans', 'Superman', 'just', 'Smallville', 'general', 'casual', 'fans', 'should', 'avoid', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'moment', 'first', 'opening', 'box', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'images', 'series', 'plastering', 'page', 'DVD', 'books', 'episode', 'guide', 'especially', 'full', 'issue', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'yup', 'miniature', 'replica', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'news', 'paper', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'tough', 'where', 'box', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'everyone', 'else', 'too', 'have', 'noticed', 'discs', 'are', 'jammed', 'bit', 'too', 'tightly', 'wedges', 'book', 'pages', 'do', 'not', 'remove', 'discs', 'very', 'carefully', 'mean', 'VERY', 'carefully', 'slowly', 'risk', 'peeling', 'disc', 'labels', 'scratching', 'disc', 'particular', 'reason', 'say', 'casual', 'fans', 'should', 'avoid', 'big', 'fan', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'overlook', 'problem', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'want', 'struggle', 'risk', 'damaging', 'discs', 'especially', 'when', 'paid', 'so', 'much', '170', 'when', 'ordered', 'easiest', 'way', 'avoid', 'problem', 'downloading', 'series', 'somewhere', 'have', 'extra', 'case', 'hand', 'When', 'pull', 'out', 'disc', 'watch', 'rather', 'slipping', 'back', 'big', 'box', 'stick', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'till', ""'re"", 'done', 'repeat', 'process', 'discs', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'pulling', 'out', 'putting', 'back', 'discs', 'frequently', 'lessen', 'chance', 'damaging', 'them.Bottom', 'Line', 'Awesome', 'show', 'comic', 'fan', 'needs', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'opinion', 'huge', 'Superman', 'fan', '20yrs', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'other', 'diehards', 'who', 'are', 'obsessive', 'collections', 'problem', 'discs', 'being', 'damaged', 'rather', 'easily', 'quite', 'few', 'mine', 'have', 'pretty', 'noticeable', 'scratches', 'being', 'removed', 'only', 'once', 'always', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'DVDs/Blu-Rays', 'buy', 'disc', 'defects', 'doing', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'too', 'frustrating', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'people', 'wishing', 'had', 'just', 'bought', 'single', 'season', 'sets', 'instead', ""'m"", 'now', 'left', 'task', 'checking', 'disc', 'episode', 'episode', 'feature', 'feature', 'errors', 'caused', 'scratches', 'scuffs', 'task', 'will', 'enjoy', 'so', 'long', 'issues', 'arise', 'do', 'have', 'issue', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'return', 'Amazon', 'would', 'be', 'absolute', 'shame.I', 'hope', 'review', 'proven', 'useful']",Smallville: The Complete Series

I have all the seasons in my collection from their first release date. So, when I finally decided to go ahead and pick up the Complete Series, I was alittle worried that I was wasting my money by buying the seasons agian. But, when the box set came in by UPS yeasterday. I was blown away by the sight, wieght and very high quality of the item. It's has two book like dvd holders that are split by 1st to 5th seasons and 6th to 10th seasons. It's made of highly compressed board and will stay togather for a very long time. WB pulled out all the stops on this great set. It also comes with a very detailed Daily Planet news paper and a high gloss 24 page epoisode quide.Not only is it the best set I've ever seen. It's has over 24 hours (two dvd's) of new features that will not be on the regular Season Ten set. I am a blu-ray owner and I can tell you the DVD's qaulity are great (plus any player will up sample the discs to almost 1080 dpi) So, this set only being released in DVD is not a problem for me. The set is so well put to gather I know if you decide to pick it up.

Now the start of this series was not so good. It took until about season three to actually get good. And it took til about season seven for it to become more familiar to the way we know Clark and how he was with everyone like Lex and Louis. Overall it was great!

1432885,AP3B615GM191G,B004XWLN20,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 5]","When I first began watching Smallville, I was hooked from the ""Pilot"" episode.  I mean, blown-away, put-in-the-next-DVD-RIGHT NOW! hooked.  As a fan of the Superman character from childhood (running around the living room in my red velcro cape Supes pajamas) into early adulthood (buying the Superman II: Donner Cut just to see those few different scenes!), I was 100% sure that this show would be the new torch to carry the Superman mythology.  I couldn't get enough of the subtle hints at farmboy Clark Kent's coming destiny, his innocent high school crushes/antics, or the bevy of villains (from both movie and comic cannon) that he runs into as a youngster.  Having not yet stumbled into LOST, Smallville was my favorite TV show of all-time.But then, a funny (but ultimately very sad) thing happened: In season five, an incredible episode entitled ""Reckoning"" airs and, once again, takes my breath away.  However, from that point on, a slow bleed begins to take place.  I won't go into details for fear of spoiling certain plotlines, but for the next five seasons of the show, it becomes a shell of its earlier self.  Gone is the tight writing, well-developed characters, and epic Clark Kent journey, replaced instead by predictable plots, shallow characters (most of the main figures are not even around by the last few seasons), and a wishy-washy path for Clark to become the Man of Steel.Thus, while I recommend the first five (MAYBE seven) seasons of Smallville as high as I possibly can, the final 3-5 seasons are no better than 2-3 stars.  As such, the incredible quality of those early seasons allows me to give this set 4-stars, but I would recommend going on a season-to-season basis, allowing you to choose when to drop out.  I ""stayed the course"", but suffered through 2-3 atrocious seasons as a result.
