Although I was never a fan of the Bulls, I enjoyed seeing this Bulls team right at the edge of breaking thru. I also enjoyed watching the Magic/Kareem Lakers even though they were nearing the end. A couple of the ECF games were broadcast by TBS.This is an 11 disc set that contains the 6 Eastern Coference Finals games along with the 4 NBA Finals games from the 88-89 season. Additionally, disc 11 contains the 88-89 season recap. A few more things I enjoyed were harder fouls not being whistled as a flagrant. Players getting T's instead of thrown out after a scuffle. Also, sometimes opposing players would give a hand for a fallen opponent(don't see that nowadays). Great set.

1018981,A1XMJ3CJWAPZDN,B000I2JDFS,Chris,"[1, 2]","I love Dennis Rodman and the Badboys of 1989 and this disc set shows some of their best moments.  You also get to see how awesome Michael Jordan and the Bulls were at that time along with the fierce competiveness that these teams brought to each game. Dennis Rodman was simply amazing back then; the rebounding, the quickness, the defensive prowess (of course I am bias because I am a Rodman fan) but nonetheless; he is arguably the greatest rebounder/defender of our time. Isiah Thoms was at another level of performance, even outplaying Michael Jordan to win the series.  You get to see a young Scottie Pippen who was still developing his skills as well as other key players for the Bulls and Pistons that really highlighted the team concept which won championships.
