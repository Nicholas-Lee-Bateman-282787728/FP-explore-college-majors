I had no reasonable concept of how the younger Morse would play, but was surprised at that he is so deeply reflective and withdrawn.  It was interesting to learn how Morse developed his desire for classical music and the initial emotional trauma it brought him.  Morse earned his reputation early by being a 'good detective, but  inoculated with high energy, unrealistic explosions and obligatory steamy sex of American mysteries.

1696668,A28YDMI499J1X9,B00JJRLFTU,J. Janssen,"[22, 25]","Endeavour returns with four new episodes featuring Morse' early days with the Oxford City Police. The initial  film opens with the young detective returning to duty after recovering from injuries sustained at the close of series 1, thereby continuing the semi-serialized format.  One of his initial tasks is preparing a report on the amalgamation of several police departments into the Thames Valley Police Constabulary which would become his place of employment twenty years in the future. The episodes have a different tone from the Inspector Morse films and this set continues in that vein. Essentially the Inspector Morse series was gothic, but modern and often melancholy while Endeavour is pragmatically plot driven with an occasional foray into film noire atmospherics.After the first season I had reservations about how the character was being portrayed with a specific concern that each episode would only be resolved by stumbling across some arcane clue that only Endeavour could properly interpret. One of the most difficult tasks a writer faces is letting their characters mature and develop and I'm pleased to see that the Morse writers have successfully accomplished that task with this set. Initially young Morse is off his game and set back by the extent of his injuries, but through the course of the four episodes he clearly becomes more confident and independent. Correspondingly his relationship with his co-workers seems to have improved as both Superintendent Bright and DS Jakes have moderated their demonstrated disdain towards him which was prominent in the initial season.  Additionally the writers have worked in more touchstones to the Thaw series such as when DI Thursday, briefly considering retirement, tries to reassure Morse that he would be fine and could work for DI McNutt, a character from ""Masonic Mysteries"", who actually was a mentor to Morse later in his career. Likewise, Colin Dexter is very briefly in a couple scenes as an homage to the writer's eponymous novels. As with the premier and initial series, the production values, cinematography, time period authenticity, and casting are superb and equal to anything on television. However, I feel the series has not reached it's full potential due to an overarching attempt by PBS to influence the parameters of the production. While this may or may not resonate with every viewer it does diminish the films in ways that potential purchasers should at least consider.First off; PBS has trimmed an additional 3 to 4 minutes off the run time for each episode so, in effect, what you get with a disc purchase is essentially the same video as was shown on the PBS broadcasts.  In the past the episodes ran approximately an hour and 33 minutes which PBS would then edit out 4 minutes to fit the television time slot.  Sometimes the deleted material was inconsequential, but more often it was germane to the narrative.  While one might think 3 minutes wouldn't amount to much over the course of a 90 minute presentation, it often was a scene where much of the Morse character was being revealed to an audience that might not have familiarity with the source material on which the series is based.  Those who first met Morse in the initial John Thaw series will recall those films were produced for the UK home market as 2 hour commercial features which equated to an hour and 44 minutes of actual run time.  When the series was picked up by PBS they were broadcast intact on the hosted venue ""PBS Mystery!""  which ran either one or two hours based on the syndicated material being broadcast.  But when PBS created Masterpiece Mystery as a production entity as well as a broadcast venue they adopted a fixed 90 minute time slot that continues to draw criticism whenever they try to force fit certain properties onto the platform.  The whole purpose of the Masterpiece production entterprise seems to be centered on controlling the format and content of the material being broadcast which, in my opinion, is not in the best interests of the viewing audience.  Increasingly PBS seems to be more interested in the packaging, branding, and demographic potential of it's dramatic lineup rather than it is with underlying quality. Ultimately certain stylistic characteristics become common among various properties thereby feeding a larger, but perhaps less discriminating audience homogenous programming. What was once an eclectic network devolves into another TNT where every decision is formula tested to appeal to the largest possible demographic; which is the opposite of the mission statement adopted by public television members when the decision to create the Public Broadcasting System was  realized.Secondly, the discs include the same image advertising for a fashion designer and cruise ship line that was included on the television broadcasts.  This has become a pattern with PBS in recent years and is ironic for a network whose member stations still widely trumpet themselves as ""commercial free"".  I have no problem with PBS adopting advertising as a revenue source, but to include it on home video products you're asked to pay for seems particularly egregious, or, at the very least, in poor taste. Including trailers of other shows in a distributer's catalog is fairly widespread and generally considered harmless, but actual paid advertising for third party commercial interests?  If you purchased a season of another network's prime time series and got toothpaste and insurance commercials most people would be rightfully upset. I don't see why PBS shouldn't be held to the same standard.Finally, I'm not going to give away any plot information, BUT the series takes a particularly jarring turn at the end of the final episode.  Rather than a dramatic cliff hanger, it comes across as a cheap and tawdry trick aimed at nothing more than hype.  It's the sort of thing one might find in prime time soap operas made infamous by the iconic ""Who shot JR?"" episode from ""Dallas"".  Both PBS and the BBC fall into this pit of mediocrity upon occasion thinking that they're being original and clever.  My singular criticism of the season 2 screenwriting is this  parroting of ""Gently in the Cathedral"", the finale of George Gently Season 5.  A much more satisfying approach would have been to create the story as a two part episode contained within a single season rather than leaving the viewers with this sort of cheap emotional ploy to ponder over the off season.  It's totally out of character for the Morse franchise and reeks of prime time commercial network thinking.Somewhere along the line PBS has confused a demonstrated ability to recognize and acquire quality drama with the talent necessary to create it. Masterpiece has had a fairly checkered history as a production entity and may have to reassess whether they would be better off simply investing in properties brought to fruition by independent producers rather than attempting to micro manage the creative process. If they would just let the Endeavour writers, cast and production crew run with the project rather than mucking it up with hokey cliff hanger endings and politically correct romantic threads this could be a classic in the making.  But unless PBS reverses course and keeps their hands off the production values I fear it's more likely to devolve into another ""Inspector Lewis""; a Morse sequel of once great promise and initial enthusiasm that limped to the finish with lackluster episodes.",3,Endeavour in the Cathedral?,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,7461,"['Endeavour', 'returns', 'four', 'new', 'episodes', 'featuring',

1696670,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00JJRLFTU,L. M. Keefer,"[2, 2]","If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 - who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years - you probably know that the show has been revived in the form of a prequel. The first season was outstanding, and now the second is maintaining the outstanding same unrelenting excellent quality, which isn't easy to do.John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the inspector's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?But now we have the new younger Morse played by Shaun Evans in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. According to the Morse mystery novels, Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. The real story is that the author, Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.Is this new endeavor in its second season worthy of the old series? Definitely yes. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is in evidence. The production values are superior to the old series, although the same wonderful iconic music remains. The sets for example - the police station, Morse's new rental, museums, boarding school, pubs - are full of period detail from the time period in England in the 1960's so Anglophiles will be delighted. The cinematography is original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera, perspectives or looking through a dirty car window as Morse steps out of a building. You feel the texture of England. I watch it as much for the scenery as for the plots and actors.The actors are stand-outs: Endeavor's boss Thursday (Roger Allam) and the chief of police (Anton Lesser), the other police colleagues, and Morse's new possible love interest are splendid. Fun to watch Morse and Thursday's relationship develop. Since Morse doesn't have Lewis as a sidekick yet, Thursday fills in as the person to which he is closest and their relationship gives the series warmth. It is an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor - you can see a bit of her father's face in hers.The crimes are appropriately complex with original plots. So, even though we still miss Mr. Thaw, the actor Shaun Evans is maturing comfortably into the role of Morse. We hope the series will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series. If the quality continues, it certainly has the potential to last a long time for Inspector Morse's old and new delighted devotees.",5,The Mystery Deepens,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,3402,"['are', 'fan', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'mourned', 'passing', 'John', 'Thaw', 'young', 'age', '60', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'voted', 'British', 'viewers', '3', 'best', '50', 'actors', 'past', '50', 'years', 'probably', 'know', 'show', 'been', 'revived', 'form', 'prequel', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'outstanding', 'now', 'second', 'maintaining', 'outstanding', 'same', 'unrelenting', 'excellent', 'quality', ""n't"", 'easy', 'do.John', 'Thaw', 'older', 'Morse', 'clearly', 'irreplaceable', 'brooding', 'melancholy', 'curmudgeonly', 'Morse', 'captured', 'inspector', 'essence', 'Thaw', 'own', 'life', 'paralleled', 'Morse', 'own', 'loss', 'mother', 'constant', 'presence', 'life', 'early', 'age', 'when', 'left', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'was', '19', 'character', 'Morse', 'parents', 'divorced', 'when', 'was', '12', 'mother', 'died', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Did', 'life', 'experience', 'help', 'Thaw', 'capture', 'depth', 'underlying', 'strain', 'unresolved', 'grief', 'Morse', 'why', 'Morse', 'constantly', 'women', 'investigations', 'even', 'when', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'culprit', 'now', 'have', 'new', 'younger', 'Morse', 'played', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'series', 'Endeavour', 'prequel', 'iconic', 'series', 'According', 'Morse', 'mystery', 'novels', 'Morse', 'mother', 'was', 'Quaker', 'origin', 'name', 'Endeavour', 'real', 'story', 'author', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'supposedly', 'found', 'name', 'building', 'boats', 'were', 'housed', 'river', 'Thames', 'Oxford', 'where', 'liked', 'walk', 'names', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'actually', 'came', 'arch-rival', 'cross-word', 'puzzle', 'clue', 'writers', 'whom', 'Dexter', 'knew.Is', 'new', 'endeavor', 'second', 'season', 'worthy', 'old', 'series', 'Definitely', 'yes', 'younger', 'Morse', 'tad', 'gawky', 'imagine', 'Morse', 'probably', 'was', 'early', 'days', 'enjoyment', 'fine', 'cars', 'classical', 'music', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'literature', 'classics', 'stubbornness', 'tenacity', 'evidence', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'superior', 'old', 'series', 'same', 'wonderful', 'iconic', 'music', 'sets', 'example', 'police', 'station', 'Morse', 'new', 'rental', 'museums', 'boarding', 'school', 'pubs', 'are', 'full', 'period', 'detail', 'time', 'period', 'England', '1960', 'so', 'Anglophiles', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'cinematography', 'original', 'unusual', 'flashbacks', 'angles', 'camera', 'looking', 'dirty', 'car', 'window', 'Morse', 'building', 'feel', 'texture', 'England', 'watch', 'much', 'scenery', 'plots', 'actors.The', 'actors', 'are', 'stand-outs', 'Endeavor', 'boss', 'Thursday', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'chief', 'police', 'Anton', 'Lesser', 'other', 'police', 'colleagues', 'Morse', 'new', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'splendid', 'Fun', 'watch', 'Morse', 'Thursday', 'relationship', 'develop', 'Morse', ""n't"", 'have', 'Lewis', 'sidekick', 'yet', 'Thursday', 'person', 'closest', 'relationship', 'series', 'warmth', 'inspired', 'choice', 'use', 'John', 'Thaw', 'daughter', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'can', 'see', 'bit', 'father', 'face', 'hers.The', 'crimes', 'are', 'appropriately', 'complex', 'original', 'plots', 'So', 'even', 'still', 'miss', 'Mr.', 'Thaw', 'actor', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'maturing', 'comfortably', 'role', 'Morse', 'hope', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'longer', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'great', 'books', 'probably', 'favorite', 'mystery', 'series', 'quality', 'certainly', 'potential', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'old', 'new', 'delighted', 'devotees']",Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour Series 2

I was amazed at the artistry, care and skill that went into the composition of each and every shot. Last night I watched the third installment of series 2 on my PBS network. Toward the beginning this episode, we are treated to a view of a double decker bus in the fog, at night, which lasts all of two or three seconds. The absolutely superb quality of this snippet of film is very instructive and  representative. The dramatic lighting of the headlights piercing the shroud of fog, the composition, the sound, the sheer magnificence of that brief shot epitomize the lofty standards of this series. It took time to put that together; it would have been much, much easier, faster and cheaper to slap something together and move on.

We feel we are actually there with him, amid the clutter, the wood desks and drawers, the papers, the dully painted walls and shadowy corners of a sixties-era city ""nick"". All of the interiors of the series have a warm and distinct look to them, as if the sets and black-suited actors had all been dusted with a magic compound which yields an authentic vintage look. The stately spires, ancient cloisters and towers of the beautiful colleges which grace the town are breathtaking in their beauty, and we are given ample opportunity to view them.I am a fan of the Colin Dexter novels, and, though the Endeavor stories are not, to my knowledge, penned by Dexter, they certainly reflect his sensibility and touch. As we know, the middle-aged Morse was an irascible, impetuous, impatient, cerebral, Wagner-loving, hard-drinking, acrostic-addicted loner who had a talent for catching bad guys. It's especially enjoyable to see some of these traits already there, and emerging, in the twenty-something Morse.The stories appeal to those of us who prefer not to have everything explained to us with crystal clarity. We don't want to see simplistic, hard-hitting heroes acting bravely. We yearn for real, breathing, struggling, imperfect human beings and not cardboard cutouts. In the third episode it is wonderfully gratifying to learn a great deal more about Morse's boss, CDI Thursday, played so ably and effectively by Roger Allam. Without divulging too much detail, a WWII lover of Thursday's, who he believed had died in the war, turns up working behind the counter in the hosiery department of a large Oxford department store. Allam's work here is incredible as his face registers, in turn, the shock, the yearning, the heartbreak of his one great love.I am so grateful that the creators of this show have been smart enough to spare us the plethora of gigantic closeups, shaking cameras and frenetic cuts that are characteristic of so many TV programs these days. The only current series which compare, visually, to this one are Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife.I recently watched what I believe is the very first Morse mystery, called The Dead of Jericho, from 1987, of course starring the late, great John Thaw. Young Lewis (Kevin Whately) had not even officially met Morse in that first go-round, knew of him only by reputation. Morse is ever the hopeless romantic who's head is easily turned by attractive women of any age, and he is drawn to a fellow chorus singer, played by Gemma Jones (Sense and Sensability, Duchess of Duke Street). It is a wonder to see the differences between the first Morse mysteries and these new Endeavor films. It's like night and day in terms of photography and composition....not to mention sharpness.",5,Masterpiece?

This series is based on Colin Dexter's character, Morse, which Masterpiece Mystery did a bang up job in translating the the television screen.  I loved/love Morse; I love gaining insight into how DCI Morse was formed and grew from a rank Constable to an amazing sleuth.  The writers stick little clues in each episode - why DCI Morse walked with a limp; why Morse ended up with the Jaguar; Morse and Strange's early relationship...it's all there and filmed as beautifully as any Masterpiece Mystery has ever been done.

1696675,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00JJRLFTU,Richard B. Schwartz,"[98, 102]","The second series of Endeavour will begin on Masterpiece in a few weeks.  Do not miss it.  Better still: buy an all-regions dvd player so that you can get these kinds of shows in advance from amazon.co.uk.  You can also comparison shop, because the prices vary between the U.S. and the UK.Season 2 consists of four episodes, each approximately 90 minutes in length.  Russell Lewis, the author of the season one episodes remains at the helm and he is at the top of his game.The production values are spectacular.  The period details--material culture items, the color palette, signage, clothing--are absolutely perfect.  You never sense that the characters are wearing costumes.  The plotting is a bit more complex than in season one.  They are more reminiscent of Morse plots, with long explanations coming at the end.  This is not a failing, just a change.  The acting is heart-breakingly good.  I was surprised to see (in an interview) that Shaun Evans actually has a natural Irish accent, which is completely suppressed when he plays Morse.  He and Roger Allam carry the show with beautiful chemistry but the supporting actors are all rock-solid, particularly Anton Lesser as Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright.In season two we learn some of Fred Thursday's backstory and we see Morse enter into a romantic relationship.  While the stories are not interlocked and rigidly sequential we are promised retribution by one of the villains in the first episode.  Thus, there is a cloud over both Morse and Thursday throughout the season, as we wait for the second shoe to land.  Episode four ends the season with a series of cliffhangers, thus promising us, one hopes (along with the big UK numbers), a third season.On a five point scale I would give one of the episodes four and a half stars, two of the episodes five stars and the season ending episode six stars.  It's just that good--comparable, e.g., to the Foyle's War series eight final episode, ""Sunflower.""Bottom line: if you loved series one you'll love series two.  This remains one of the top British mysteries and, yes, Colin Dexter continues to appear in each episode.Very highly recommended.",5,Truly Exceptional Television Drama,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2155,"['second', 'series', 'Endeavour', 'will', 'begin', 'Masterpiece', 'few', 'weeks', 'Do', 'not', 'miss', 'Better', 'still', 'buy', 'all-regions', 'dvd', 'player', 'can', 'get', 'kinds', 'shows', 'advance', 'amazon.co.uk', 'can', 'also', 'comparison', 'shop', 'prices', 'vary', 'U.S.', 'UK.Season', '2', 'consists', 'four', 'episodes', 'approximately', '90', 'minutes', 'length', 'Russell', 'Lewis', 'author', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'helm', 'top', 'game.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'spectacular', 'period', 'details', 'material', 'culture', 'items', 'color', 'palette', 'signage', 'clothing', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'never', 'sense', 'characters', 'are', 'wearing', 'costumes', 'plotting', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Morse', 'plots', 'long', 'explanations', 'coming', 'end', 'not', 'failing', 'just', 'change', 'acting', 'heart-breakingly', 'good', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'interview', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'actually', 'natural', 'Irish', 'accent', 'completely', 'suppressed', 'when', 'Morse', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'carry', 'show', 'beautiful', 'chemistry', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'rock-solid', 'particularly', 'Anton', 'Lesser', 'Chief', 'Superintendent', 'Reginald', 'Bright.In', 'season', 'two', 'learn', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'backstory', 'see', 'Morse', 'enter', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'interlocked', 'rigidly', 'sequential', 'are', 'promised', 'retribution', 'one', 'villains', 'first', 'episode', 'Thus', 'cloud', 'Morse', 'Thursday', 'season', 'wait', 'second', 'shoe', 'land', 'Episode', 'four', 'season', 'series', 'cliffhangers', 'thus', 'promising', 'one', 'hopes', 'big', 'UK', 'numbers', 'third', 'season.On', 'five', 'point', 'scale', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'episodes', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'two', 'episodes', 'five', 'stars', 'season', 'ending', 'episode', 'six', 'stars', 'just', 'good', 'comparable', 'e.g.', 'Foyle', 'War', 'series', 'eight', 'final', 'episode', 'Sunflower', 'Bottom', 'line', 'loved', 'series', 'one', ""'ll"", 'love', 'series', 'two', 'one', 'top', 'British', 'mysteries', 'yes', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'appear', 'episode.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour Series 2
