774185,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000C9JFO,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 18]","A French film set in Barcelona, Spain; sounds beautifully intoxicating, right?  That's that I thought but sadly I was sorely mistaken.`L'Auberge Espagnole' (`The Spanish Apartment' / `Euro Pudding' depending on how you want to translate it) has the makings of an intricately woven coming of age story but it manages to be nothing more than a boring and tepid waste of time.  I remember when the opening credits for the film began to run and I thought to myself that this looked to be an extremely steamy sitcom, and I was put off a bit because I wanted to watch a `movie' and not a `sitcom' but I thought that if done right then it could prove to be a good time at least.  Instead I got something that doesn't even qualify as a `Dawson's Creek' style romp; a film that merely skims across the surface of stimulation and barely comes off as entertaining.  Even it's `film about nothing yet about so much more' approach is staggering and winds up being a film about nothing that is ultimately about nothing.I know I am in the minority here, but honestly, I can't bring myself to lie.I will say first and foremost that I adore films that seem to have no point but in the end touch us so deeply.  I'm all for that, but `L'Auberge Espagnole' is not that kind of film, at least not for me.  I gathered nothing from this experience, except shattered hopes and aspirations since the film wound up being so much less than I anticipated.  After seeing Audrey Tautou sizzle and score with the beautifully constructed `Amelie' I was dying to see her in action once again, so I picked up this film.  Sadly, Tautou is barely in this film, and even though she is decent in her small role she is still stunted by the scripts poor construction.The film follows Xavier, a French college student who decides to travel to Barcelona for a year to study economics and learn the Spanish culture in order to help secure himself a well paying job.  He leaves behind his difficult girlfriend and overbearing mother and winds up bunking with quite a few roommates all of different ethnic backgrounds (British, Italian, German, Danish, Spanish).  His girlfriend comes to visit, leaves upset, breaks up with him.  He falls for his lesbian roommate, then his friend's wife.  His roommate's brother comes to visit and turns everyone off (the only slightly entertaining segment in the film) and yet none of this seems remotely relevant since none of it is delivered in a way that makes us feel it is of the slightest importance.One good thing I can say about the film is that the entire cast handles their respective roles very well.  Their acting can't really elevate this film into the importance it is so actively seeking, but it does at least give me a singular avenue in which to praise.  Romain Duris is wonderful as Xavier, taking his characters shelter naivety and allowing him to blossom as the film lurches forward.  It's within the supporting characters that I found the most joy though.  Judith Godreche is especially stunning as Anne-Sophie, the married woman whom Xavier takes a liking to.  Cecile De France is also mesmerizing as Isabelle, Xavier's off-limits roommate, and Kelly Reilly makes her mark as the loud and outspoken Wendy.  I also really loved the inclusion of Kevin Bishop and his character William, for he actually held my interest for the brief moments he was on the screen.Sadly, they can't save this movie nor can they convince me to every watch it again or even suggest you give it a try.  I'd stay away from this film, but then again so many others here have praised it and recommended it and obviously seen something within its running time that I fail to see.To each his own, I always say; to each his own.",1,Pass on the pudding...,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3710,"['French', 'film', 'set', 'Barcelona', 'Spain', 'beautifully', 'intoxicating', 'right', 'thought', 'sadly', 'was', 'sorely', 'mistaken.', ""L'Auberge"", 'Espagnole', 'Spanish', 'Apartment', '/', 'Euro', 'Pudding', 'depending', 'how', 'want', 'translate', 'makings', 'intricately', 'woven', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'boring', 'tepid', 'waste', 'time', 'remember', 'when', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'began', 'run', 'thought', 'myself', 'looked', 'be', 'extremely', 'steamy', 'sitcom', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'bit', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'sitcom', 'thought', 'done', 'right', 'then', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'least', 'Instead', 'got', 'something', ""n't"", 'even', 'qualify', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'style', 'romp', 'film', 'merely', 'surface', 'stimulation', 'barely', 'off', 'entertaining', 'Even', 'film', 'nothing', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""'"", 'approach', 'staggering', 'up', 'being', 'film', 'nothing', 'ultimately', 'nothing.I', 'know', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'lie.I', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'foremost', 'adore', 'films', 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'end', 'touch', 'so', 'deeply', ""'m"", ""L'Auberge"", 'Espagnole', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'gathered', 'nothing', 'experience', 'shattered', 'hopes', 'aspirations', 'film', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'anticipated', 'seeing', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'sizzle', 'score', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'Amelie', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'action', 'once', 'again', 'picked', 'up', 'film', 'Sadly', 'Tautou', 'barely', 'film', 'even', 'decent', 'small', 'role', 'still', 'stunted', 'scripts', 'poor', 'construction.The', 'film', 'Xavier', 'French', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'travel', 'Barcelona', 'year', 'study', 'economics', 'learn', 'Spanish', 'culture', 'order', 'help', 'secure', 'well', 'paying', 'job', 'difficult', 'girlfriend', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'up', 'bunking', 'few', 'roommates', 'different', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'British', 'Italian', 'German', 'Danish', 'Spanish', 'girlfriend', 'visit', 'upset', 'up', 'lesbian', 'roommate', 'then', 'friend', 'wife', 'roommate', 'brother', 'visit', 'turns', 'everyone', 'only', 'slightly', 'entertaining', 'segment', 'film', 'yet', 'none', 'remotely', 'relevant', 'none', 'delivered', 'way', 'feel', 'slightest', 'importance.One', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'handles', 'respective', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'elevate', 'film', 'importance', 'so', 'actively', 'seeking', 'least', 'give', 'singular', 'avenue', 'praise', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'wonderful', 'Xavier', 'taking', 'characters', 'shelter', 'naivety', 'allowing', 'blossom', 'film', 'forward', 'supporting', 'characters', 'found', 'most', 'joy', 'Judith', 'Godreche', 'especially', 'stunning', 'Anne-Sophie', 'married', 'woman', 'whom', 'Xavier', 'liking', 'Cecile', 'De', 'France', 'also', 'mesmerizing', 'Isabelle', 'Xavier', 'off-limits', 'roommate', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'mark', 'loud', 'outspoken', 'Wendy', 'also', 'really', 'loved', 'inclusion', 'Kevin', 'Bishop', 'character', 'William', 'actually', 'held', 'interest', 'brief', 'moments', 'was', 'screen.Sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'can', 'convince', 'watch', 'again', 'even', 'suggest', 'give', 'try', ""'d"", 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'praised', 'recommended', 'obviously', 'seen', 'something', 'running', 'time', 'fail', 'see.To', 'own', 'always', 'say', 'own']",N/A

""ccjello""","[8, 8]","This film took me back to college days, to traveling overseas, to being thrown into situations with folks from other cultures, doing things I would never dream of doing now.  I found it to be perfectly delightful, and the funniest film (in a laugh-out-loud way) I've seen in a long time.  Xavier, the lead character, is a French student who is advised to learn Spanish in order for his father's friend to place him in a plum economics job in Paris.  So, gullible &amp; a little happless, Xavier grabs his backpack &amp; dons his Levis, and marches off to Barcelona to study abroad in the Erasmus program.  The first scenes in which Xavier is trying to navigate his way around Barcelona, struggling under the load of his luggage and his inability to speak Spanish, reminded me of the challenges of being a stranger in a strange land.  Xavier eventually finds himself being interviewed for a space in a chaotic apartment shared by a Brit, an Italian, a Dane, a German and a Spaniard.  More than anything, he wants to be accepted into this apartment, and ultimately, he is.  During the course of the year, he takes seduction lessons from a lesbian woman in one of his courses, seduces a French physician's wife, seemingly forgets about his girlfriend Martine back home (Audrey Tautou), and then tries to reclaim her after she's broken up with him.  The year abroad is so full of promise, excitement, learning (and he does, in fact, learn Spanish).  After Xavier returns home to Paris from his year abroad, the film shows him eating a steak dinner with his hippie mother at their kitchen table -- underscoring the fact that the vacation is over.  No more twelve different bottles of beer &amp; various international sauces and a million different langage being shouted across the crowded table in the Spanish apartment -- this is back to real, DULL life.  It perfectly depicted the let down one feels (or at least I feel) after a fascinating trip abroad.I disagree with the reviewer who found the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.  This is a coming of age film that perfectly explains the decision, and when the protagonist runs away from bureaucracy in the end to pursue his goals of being a writer, I found myself cheering.  Had Xavier accepted the suit job analyzing markets, with the only excitement idle gossip with fellow suits over the water cooler, I don't think the viewer would think that Xavier learned anything from his time abroad.  The film capitalizes on stereotypess of Europeans (the German is very organized, the Italian carefree, the Brit responsible . . . ) in an entertaining way.  The filmmaking is also very interesting and well-done.

774192,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B0000C9JFO,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","Cedric Klapisch's 2002 film L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE (""The Spanish Apartment"") is the story of Xavier (Roman Duris), a French student studying in Barcelona for a year, and his wacky adventures with his international flatmates. As this reviewer himself has lived in similar international settings from the last several years, including a stint with a couple of crazy Frenchman in Spain, I found this film a generally authentic and entertaining portrayal of European student exchange life.These young people are brought together by the European Union's ERASMUS programme, which has moved EU students around for university education since the mid-1970s (it's therefore curious that such a film took so long to appear). Beyond its simple story of a young man discovering himself in foreign surroundings, there is also a strong commentary on the benefits -- and risks -- of the movement towards a common European identity. The French title literally means ""The Spanish Inn"", but it also has the idiomatic meaning of ""potluck"". Each of the residents of Xavier's flat contributes a very different side of Western Europe. Wendy (Kelly Reilly) is from England, Lars from Denmark, Isabelle (Cecile de France) from Belgium, Alessando (Federico D'Anna) from Italy, and Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat) from Germany. The only native Spaniard is Soledad (Cristina Brondo), who gets perhaps less attention than she should have.Generally the film is positive towards European integration. When Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) comes to visit, he embarasses her with his puerile national sterotypes -- e.g. ""Germans are Nazis"", ""Italians are slovenly"" -- suggesting that those who live in an international milieu are more enlightened. Hints at the dangers of common approaches towards integration arise when some students claim that Catalans should give up their language and speak a larger one just for the sake of European unity. It is notable that all foreigners in the film learn Spanish, never Catalan.Beyond the larger issues of world politics, the film explores the difficulties of maintaining long-distance relationships, as Xavier can't make it work with his Parisian girlfriend Martine. His is also unsure of how to relate with women in this expat world of free love, seducing a married woman entrusted to him to show around the city. Martine's is only a background role in the film, but as she is played by Audrey Tatou, hot on the heels of the hit AMELIE, Tatou featured heavily in the film's publicity.Why four stars? This is a thought-provoking film that I would recommend for anyone interested in the issue of European integration, but it just doesn't feel like any sort of unequivocal masterpiece. One notable problem is the age of the protagonist. Xavier is going to Barcelona for postgraduate studies and is already 24-25 years old at this point. However, his actions and his naivete are that of someone four or so years younger. Some scenes also seem insufficiently linked to the film's themes, as that showed while Xavier's roommate recounts how her flamenco teacher tried to seduce her.The 2005 sequel to the film, LES POUPEES RUSEES (""Russian Dolls"") is better still.

Oh, well.I find it hard to describe what this movie is about, so I'll leave it to others who have no doubt done a fine job of detailing its quirky, thin-yet-rich plot.

Hamlow,"[14, 17]","The future is in the stock market, says French executive Jean-Charles Perrin to young Xavier, and that with a MA in economics, he can get Xavier a job in his company, as Perrin is a friend of Xavier's father.  To that end, the young man enrolls in the Erasmus, named after Reformation-era scholar Desiderius Erasmus, foreign student programme and goes to Barcelona to finish his degree.Once there, he finds a flat with a group of students from other countries, including Isabelle from Belgium, Lars from Denmark, the clean freak Wendy from Britain, and Alessandro from Italy, a chronic mess-maker whom I tried to find a picture of Oscar from The Odd Couple, but it was probably buried under his mess.  Yes, six, later seven students living together in a cramped apartment does make quite a monkey cage.  He is also befriended by a French couple, the brain specialist Jean-Michel and his wife Anne-Sophie, who put him up for a while pending new living arrangements.The title apartment, with the various students represents a miniaturized European Union, represented by Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and France.  The students are here to mold their future into careers, and their encounters with several students from other parts of the world symbolizes the globalization that's become ever more apparent in the 1990's and the naughts.  Yet one of the effects of that is a meshing of cultures to the point that one goes from being French to being European, soaking in the culture and psyche of his/her fellow students.  One thus learns what it's like to be a foreigner and also to show proper respect to people from other cultures.  The importance of this is demonstrated by Isabelle and some other students, who have learned Castilian, to soberly discover that one professor teaches his courses speaking Catalan, the dominant language in Barcelona.  Another is when Wendy's visiting brother William, who apart from being a nuisance to the students trying to study, unwittingly offends some of them with his ignorance.  Call him the British version of a redneck, someone unaware of the cultural melding taking place.Compare that to Martine, Xavier's girlfriend, played by Amelie's Audrey Tautou.  Despite having less than a combined ten minutes screen-time, there is a scene where we learn she was named after the character in a children's book who fed the farm animals.  She thinks it's sexist that the women had to do all the work, yet Martine also represents a simpler, rural life that's in danger of vanishing in today's globalized world.  Think of the careers post-industrial women have today.  With Xavier gone to Barcelona and his miniature EC, the strain between them represents traditional simplicity versus globalization.Xavier's studies is also a journey to find himself in this multicultural environment, but it becomes an adventure.  He becomes more attuned to his surroundings, and his taking out the slightly shy, un-hip Anne-Sophie on outings, sanctioned by her absentee husband, leads to an affair.Historically, it's interesting and apropos that this story takes place in Spain, which spearheaded the first post-Roman empire in Western Civilization, empires leading to globalism.  Ditto for the name of the student programme, as Erasmus left Paris, like Xavier, and found an affinity towards humanist scholars such as Thomas More in England.The students are well-cast, as they are like any bunch of university students I met in my time at NMSU, with Kelly Reilly (Wendy) and Cecile De France (Isabelle) pulling standout and very likeable performances.  And the location shooting, be it the streets or the coloured frameworks of buildings under construction, brings in a fresh ambience.

Though her role is small, she has one of the biggest movie impact.  Romain Duris, another big movie impact actor, plays Xavier beautifully.

""L'Auberge Espagnole"" (""The Spanish Apartment"") seems to be one of those places, in a charming little comedy about a rather clueless French exchange student who finds out about life from his peculiar neighbors.Xavier (Romain Duris) is a naive, uncertain young Frenchman with a promising future, even though he's still living with his hippie-dippy mother. He secretly longs to be a writer, but is buried up to his nose in the French bureaucracy. To get the job he wants in the European Commission, however, he has to spend a year in Spain. So he leaves his unhappy girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou), moves to Barcelona, and rapidly discovers that the people who live in the building are quite, quite loco.The apartment building has a gaggle of strange people from all different countries, including Belgian lesbian Isabelle (C&eacute;cile De France) who teaches him how to seduce women, skills he soon uses on frustrated doctor's wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godreche). With a bunch of offbeat tenants from all over Europe, and his own problems back home, will Xavier figure out what he really wants?Coming-of-age youths surrounded by loons aren't anything new; last year's ""All I Want"" has a similar theme. What sets ""L'Auberge"" apart is the sort of gleeful goofy irresponsibility of the characters. Okay, the theme of the movie is as thin as a Disney cartoon's (be true to yourself and discover your inner artist! In Barcelona!). There are no pretensions of grandeur or depth in this film; the Fawlty Towers homage is proof enough of that. You can see the ending coming a mile away, but it doesn't really matter. The ride is what matters.The overal directing style of this movie can be summed up: ""cute."" That's about all. The pitter-patter of feet as the characters fast-forward through the building is cute the first time, but doesn't really wear well.  The humor is cute (the seduction instruction is priceless), with plenty of fluffily goofy moments. And the camera lingers both on the gritty and picturesque parts of Barcelona, giving a good feel for what it might be like to live there.The supporting characters tend to be rather stereotypical, such as the uptight Brit or the talkative Italian. I liked the weirdos anyway. Duris has a certain naive charm that makes Xavier seem even younger than he is, although sometimes he needs a slap on the... well, the butt. Tautou, unfortunately, is wasted in her small role, but is noteworthy even though she has little screen time.""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a charming, unrealistic, slightly goofy comedy film, a little like a multi-lingual sitcom.

Amazingly enough the husband does not find out but eventually he suspects something is up between them when Xavier begins to have visions of Erasmus (the Renaissance man after whom the college student exchange program is named). Xavier explains his hallucinations to the neurologist who does various tests and by chance discovers Xavier has some impure thoughts about his wife. This is a frolicking, funny ""coming of age"" story where Xavier discovers his true self and along the way, comes to some serious realizations about life. He also manages to enjoy himself on a wild and crazy ride with his international friends during his last year of college. This is a highly recommended entertaining and amusing escape-from-reality type film.

Tautou has a relatively minor role, but the film didn't even need her. I didn't know what to expect, but I found it to be one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. It sucked me right in from the beginning. The main character is Xavier, a French student who goes to Barcelona Spain to study. There he stays in an apartment with about six other people all from different European countries. He's studying economics, but he finds that he learns more from his roommates than he ever may in school.This is a bright, dazzling, lovely film. The cast is excellent with many interesting characters. Several different languages are spoken (mostly French, English and Spanish) and the differences between them provide much of the subject matter. Of course there are many romantic entanglements, both serious and humorous, and subplots and side stories which take us deeper into the lives of the characters. By the end of the film, I really felt like I knew these characters and wanted to spend more time with them. It's a two-hour film, but I didn't want it to end. I could have easily sat through another hour of it. At the end, however, I really felt fulfilled, and much like Xavier in the film, felt that I had learned a little about life and how valuable our experiences are.L'Auberge Espagnole is a wonderful, thoroughly enjoyable film about human relationships and experience that is both comic and poignant.

The inception of the film is artful with extraordinary camera effects, gradually introducing all the characters we will encounter by means of clever frames within frames and woven words with images.  The story is straightforward: Xavier is a bright Parisian boy (Romain Duris, who truly holds this film together), living with his hippie vegetarian mother, and under the influence of the 'adults' who counsel him to learn Spanish, get his MA in Barcelona, then return to Paris as an Economist versed in the Spanish  market (remember the 'Graduate' and plastics?).With much anxiety over leaving his Paris, his  native language, and his girlfriend (the always lovely Audrey Tautou), he flies to Barcelona.  There he is befriended by a Neurologist (whose new wife is to become his paramour), and finally finds an apartment shared by 5 of the most refreshing youths ever gathered under one roof - German, Italian, British, Danish, Spanish, and now French.  It is the intermingling of these lives that is the joy of the story and we are witness to their foibles, idiosyncrasies, national traits, bonding, affairs, and finally their influence on the refreshed Xavier's world view.  After a year of social and intellectual and emotional learning, Xavier flies back to Paris to accept his &quot;new life&quot; as a boring economics executive, only to wake up and return to the city of joy - Barcelona, Spain.Each of this large cast is excellent, drawing portraits of people we know so well by the end of the that WE could (or could wish to) have as roommates. The photography captures the beauty of Barcelona with lingering glimpses of Gaudi architecture, the ocean, and the vistas.

The root of the comedy, which mostly takes place in a group apartment, centers on both universal commonalities and cultural differences in an increasingly ethnically integrated Barcelona. Don't let this introduction make you think that the movie is an overtly political statement on cultural integration, as it is a simple celebration of how funny or annoying different cultures can be to those who don't really understand the subtle or sometimes huge differences that is engrained in all of us. The beauty if that it pokes fun at every culture in a loving fashion while letting us in of the lives of some very colorful people. It even suggests that we not only have much to learn from others, but that it may be so much more interesting and fulfilling to be around people who can push your buttons and that ultimately community is about people coming together because they chose to.The movie opens with a hyperkinetic pace and editing tricks that lets you know that it's not going to be your stereotypical run of the mill foreign film. You could call it a coming of age film, but it's one that is not targeted at solely kids as it feels very universal and timeless. The movie is acted with zest and every single character is well-tended to by the writer. Even though all the characters are not immediately likable, you wind up loving the group and wanting their time together not to end and maybe for you to have the opportunity of living with them if only for a while.Even if you are not generally a fan of foreign films, you may want to gives this one a chance as it is intoxicating and certainly made me want to go back in time for a few years and have the opportunity to have been exposed to such diversity instead of the homogeneity that surrounds/surrounded most of us. I recommend this movie to almost anyone and especially to those in college who may only see the serious side of living in another country. The ending, which I won't give away, seems to have gotten the Hollywood treatment, but it's not a deal-breaker. The movie easily earns 4 stars and I would not be surprised if the director and many of the secondary characters find as much professional success as Audrey Tautou of Amelie has found. Warning: If you are only going to see the movie to Audrey, you may be disappointed as her role is important yet very small. The movie's marketing team has put her in the middle of all advertising campaigns and right smack in the center of the DVD box, so you may think that the movie centers around her and it just is not the case.

If you go abroad for a long period of time, you're gonna end up having affairs with other people?With a promise of a lucrative job related to Spanish economics, Xavier takes advantage of an Erasmus program which allows students to study abroad.  It's sort of like a foreign exchange program.  Xavier leaves behind his hippie mother and girlfriend (Audrey Tautou) in France for a year in Barcelona.After 2 brief stays with a family friend and strangers, Xavier finally lands an apartment with international roommates.  All seems to be fine and dandy.  They get to know each other and talk about each other.  However, some of the roommates start to have affairs behind their boyfriends and girlfriends that they've left behind in their homeland.  Xavier is no different.  He falls for the lonely wife of the stranger that he first met at the airport when he landed in Barcelona.There's no real story plot.  There's no story on Xavier's schooling or for any of the roommates.  There's no stories among the roommates other than feeling the temptation to cheat on their significant others.  There is a variety of conversation among the roommmates.

He closes the film with a sort of epiphanies.So, I wasn't impressed with this movie.  I've seen better foreign films than this.  It was slow paced and directionless.

Thus, he applies to the Erasmus programme, in order to study in Barcelona (Spain) for a year.Xavier leaves his parents and his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou) behind, but he meets lots of new people and survives to cultural shock. He also starts an affair with the lonely wife of another Frenchman, and goes to Economy classes at the university. But what will charm the viewer is the chaotic life Xavier will have in the apartment he will share with other foreign students. In a way, the apartment is a little piece of the European Union, with people from Italy, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Spain and France. Of course, there are lots of linguistic misunderstandings, but also an enormous amount of amusing situations and good-natured fun.I specially appreciated the fact that the scriptwriter and the director (Cedric Klapisch) managed to convey many of the phases a foreign student goes through. For example, when Xavier says that ""When you first arrive in a new city, nothing makes sense"", but ""After you've lived here, walked these streets, you'll know them inside out. You'll know these people. Once you've lived here, crossed this street 10, 20, 1000 times... it'll belong to you because you've lived there"".At the end, Xavier learns Spanish, but also about friendships, relationships and himself. In a way, watching this movie will allow you to be ""there"" with him throughout the whole process. And truth to be told, that is many things but never boring.

The plot seems simple enough: Xavier a young French student (played wonderfully by Roman Duris)is preparing his future life and career in the EU commision thanks to his father's connections, provided that he acquires a masters degrees in Spanish economics. He goes to Barcelona,leaving his girlfriend behind (Amelie's Audrey Tatou),and after staying with a French couple he meets at the airport, he finally gets a room in a flat he shares with others European students,from Italy, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and England.He is estatic about his new lodgings and the good vibes he gets from it, little does he know that his life is about to change forever from that moment on.His plans for a secure career, and his mundane and sheltered life comes gradually under attack from his experiences with his roommates in a foreign city he comes to love: An affair with the wife of a French doctor (the excellent Judith Godreche)the same couple he stayed with on his arrival,his lesson of seduction by a lesbian (the gorgeous Cecile de France),who becomes his best friend, a friendship first sealed by their common love of the music of Ali Fakre Toure (I thought what an original way to seal a friendship!),and the love of life in all its colours he soon discovers.The core of the film is not about some Europeans getting together in the spirit of a new Europe, with all their cultural differences and habits, it is rather about a young man who finally discovers who he really is and what he wants from life! Barcelona could be London or Paris or anywhere else for that matter, and the students could have been from any nationality, it does not matter as much as the fact that it is about a journey of self discovery and change, this is what makes the film a masterpiece.I first thought that there were too many characters in the film which could have easily done without, especially that some students, like the Italian, German and Danish characters are more than extras and not quite developped, but by the end of the film, you do understand why Klapish wrote them all.Apart from Duris's charater, I thought the English characters were well written and provide most of the humour in the film (brilliantly played by Kelly Reilly and Kevin Bishop).It is always interesting to see how the English are seen and portrayed in French films, and vice versa-The love/hate relationship of the two countries is legendary ever since William the Conqueror woke up one morning and decided to have Fish'n'Chips for lunch-but Klapish,although falling slightly in the cliche of the heavily drunk who can't take his drink, he has a sympathetic eye for the 'neighbors across the channel'.Klapish's aversion of bureaucracy is very well emphasized: the fast camera shots of the EU corridors, the endless forms he has to fill, the men in grey suits who think they can tell a joke, a world that Xavier realizes he does not belong to.So L'Auberge Espagnole is a movie about friendships, about self discovery and it is about rebirth, a film that should on no account be missed.",5,Rebirth Under The Spanish Sun,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,3419,"['tradition', 'many', 'French', 'films', ""L'Auberge"", 'Espagnole', 'warm', 'well', 'written', 'coming', 'age', 'semi', 'autobiographical', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'stay', 'long', 'watch', 'it.Cedric', 'Klapish', 'wonderful', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'first', 'look', 'not', 'seem', 'say', 'much', 'many', 'realizations', 'viewer', 'will', 'subtley', 'unravel', 'one', 'one', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Xavier', 'young', 'French', 'student', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Roman', 'Duris', 'preparing', 'future', 'life', 'career', 'EU', 'commision', 'thanks', 'father', 'connections', 'provided', 'masters', 'degrees', 'Spanish', 'economics', 'Barcelona', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'Amelie', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'staying', 'French', 'couple', 'airport', 'finally', 'room', 'flat', 'shares', 'others', 'European', 'students', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'Denmark', 'Spain', 'Belgium', 'England.He', 'estatic', 'new', 'lodgings', 'good', 'vibes', 'little', 'know', 'life', 'change', 'forever', 'moment', 'on.His', 'secure', 'career', 'mundane', 'sheltered', 'life', 'gradually', 'attack', 'experiences', 'roommates', 'foreign', 'city', 'love', 'affair', 'wife', 'French', 'doctor', 'excellent', 'Judith', 'Godreche', 'same', 'couple', 'stayed', 'arrival', 'lesson', 'seduction', 'lesbian', 'gorgeous', 'Cecile', 'de', 'France', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'friendship', 'first', 'sealed', 'common', 'love', 'music', 'Ali', 'Fakre', 'Toure', 'thought', 'what', 'original', 'way', 'seal', 'friendship', 'love', 'life', 'colours', 'soon', 'discovers.The', 'core', 'film', 'not', 'Europeans', 'getting', 'together', 'spirit', 'new', 'Europe', 'cultural', 'differences', 'habits', 'rather', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'discovers', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'life', 'Barcelona', 'could', 'be', 'London', 'Paris', 'anywhere', 'else', 'matter', 'students', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nationality', 'not', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'change', 'film', 'masterpiece.I', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'especially', 'students', 'Italian', 'German', 'Danish', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'extras', 'not', 'quite', 'developped', 'end', 'film', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'Klapish', 'wrote', 'all.Apart', 'Duris', 'charater', 'thought', 'English', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'provide', 'most', 'humour', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'Kevin', 'Bishop', '.It', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'English', 'are', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'French', 'films', 'vice', 'versa-The', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'two', 'countries', 'legendary', 'ever', 'William', 'Conqueror', 'woke', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'decided', 'have', 'Fish', ""n'Chips"", 'lunch-but', 'Klapish', 'falling', 'slightly', 'cliche', 'heavily', 'drunk', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'drink', 'sympathetic', 'eye', ""'neighbors"", ""channel'.Klapish"", 'aversion', 'bureaucracy', 'very', 'well', 'emphasized', 'fast', 'camera', 'shots', 'EU', 'corridors', 'endless', 'forms', 'fill', 'men', 'grey', 'suits', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'joke', 'world', 'not', 'belong', 'to.So', ""L'Auberge"", 'Espagnole', 'movie', 'friendships', 'self', 'discovery', 'rebirth', 'film', 'should', 'account', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Nothing that occurred would give you any reason why--or show why he was so deeply affected by his crude misconduct in Barcelona.Another major flaw--our hero is basically despicable. Yet, this movie not only does not care, but makes great fun of it. If this is the epitome of the new, forward thinking Euro generation, please, oh please, let's go back in time. Our hero, for instance, is befriended by a French couple in the airport. They help him. They open their home to him. He returns the favor by taking seduction lessons from a lesbian, and seducing the wife of his benefactor.This remarkable misconduct merits NO particular self-examination or regret. NO apologies. In fact, it's such a minor incident to the filmmaker that the French couple comes to our hero's going away party without recrimination. Ludicrous.Oh, at the same time, our hero is cheating on his girlfriend back home, and flirting with others, too. This ALSO merits no particular thought. So, the great revelations our hero supposedly had in Barcelona that cause abandonment of his life's dream couldn't be too great---since he is overly shallow and wastes no time thinking twice about anything.This mish-mash of a movie succeeds on no level, in short. The characters are not real, the scenarios are ludicrous. The supposed charm does not exist. It's often tedious and boring. You wonder why you should care at all.Oh, and Tautou is wasted in a minor role.P.s. I see few people think this helpful. I guess in the world of true fanatics, a word of criticism or does of reality is not acceptable.

Both of these meanings link to the movie very well.The movie follows a post-graduate exchange student, Xavier (Romain Duris) , on his trip to Barcelona, and the extraordinary moments he there witnesses. The title refers to the apartment he is staying, packed with students from all over Europe, and the chaos in which these weird, but lovable people live. All these people are very different and well played by the multinational cast. Throw in the equation Xavier's jealous ex-girlfriend Martine (foolishly first-billed, but lovely Audrey Tautou), his new crush, the beautiful lesbian Soledad (Cristina Brondo) and his third love interest, the painfully shy Anne-Sophie (Judith Godr&egrave;che), and you've got an amazingly entertaining, at times depressing, but always very meditative movie, ""L'Auberge Espagnole"".

It was probably only released in the U.S. because of Audrey Tautou's small part in it: don't be tricked by the fact she occupies the central position on the DVD cover!  (Audrey Tautou is the lead actress in ""Amelie"", which I also highly recommend)I think you can only truly appreciate this movie if you have spent a year studying abroad.  I am not saying that Americans do not do that, but it is just much more common on the other side of the Atlantic, since credits can easily be transfered from one European university to another.I was an exchange student myself, and this movie clearly reminded me of my own experience.  Yes, finding yourself in a new town you know nothing about, with no one you know can be daunting at first!  In the movie, after Xavier gets to meet new people, Barcelona feels more and more like a second home to him.  At the end of the school year, this city has become part of him, and it is heart-breaking for him to leave what has become his true home, because he knows that he will probably never see any of these people again.  Yet, his life is changed forever as this experience helps him figure out what he truly wants to do with his life...While the end made me nostalgic, I thought the rest of the movie was very upbeat and many of the multilingual dialogues, cultural misunderstandings and situations were just hilarious.  Imagine a Frenchman, an English girl, a German, a Swedish, an Italian and a Belgian all living together in the same apartment! You soon get attached to each of them, as they each have their own distinct personality.  Imagine the orderly German and the messy Italian sharing the same bedroom, or even the same fridge!  Those are not just stereotypes: having lived in Europe most of my life, there is some truth behind those cliches!What is interesting about this movie is that the main character, Xavier, also has the least ""interesting"" personality.  Why is that?  You just absorbe what he sees through his eyes and at the end, it feels like you are the one leaving a group of friends behind in Barcelona, which truly is the main protagonist of the movie!P.S.: If you are afraid of reading subtitles, bear in mind that a good portion of the movie (30%) is actually in English, which is the lingua franca students use inside the apartment.",5,Vive l'Europe!,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,2359,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'Europe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'released', 'U.S.', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'small', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'tricked', 'fact', 'central', 'position', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'lead', 'actress', 'Amelie', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'think', 'can', 'only', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'have', 'spent', 'year', 'studying', 'abroad', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'other', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'credits', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'transfered', 'one', 'European', 'university', 'another.I', 'was', 'exchange', 'student', 'movie', 'clearly', 'reminded', 'own', 'experience', 'Yes', 'finding', 'new', 'town', 'know', 'nothing', 'one', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'daunting', 'first', 'movie', 'Xavier', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'Barcelona', 'more', 'more', 'second', 'home', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'city', 'become', 'part', 'heart-breaking', 'leave', 'what', 'become', 'true', 'home', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'people', 'again', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'experience', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'truly', 'do', 'life', 'end', 'made', 'nostalgic', 'thought', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'upbeat', 'many', 'multilingual', 'dialogues', 'cultural', 'misunderstandings', 'situations', 'were', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Imagine', 'Frenchman', 'English', 'girl', 'German', 'Swedish', 'Italian', 'Belgian', 'living', 'together', 'same', 'apartment', 'soon', 'get', 'attached', 'have', 'own', 'distinct', 'personality', 'Imagine', 'orderly', 'German', 'messy', 'Italian', 'sharing', 'same', 'bedroom', 'even', 'same', 'fridge', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'stereotypes', 'having', 'lived', 'Europe', 'most', 'life', 'truth', 'cliches', 'What', 'interesting', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Xavier', 'also', 'least', 'interesting', 'personality', 'Why', 'just', 'absorbe', 'what', 'eyes', 'end', 'are', 'one', 'leaving', 'group', 'friends', 'Barcelona', 'truly', 'main', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'P.S', 'are', 'afraid', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'bear', 'mind', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', '30', '%', 'actually', 'English', 'lingua', 'franca', 'students', 'use', 'apartment']",N/A

Even though Xavier will miss his girlfriend Martine, he jumps at the opportunity, and through the European exchange program called Erasmus, Xavier goes to Barcelona for a post-graduate degree in economics. After initially relying on the good graces and hospitality of a French couple he meets on the plane, Xavier ends up in an apartment with 6 other students from Europe. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, upon its release in Europe in 2002, this movie became a box office smash (eventually leading to a successful release in the US in 2003), and it's easy to see why: we can completely relate to these experiences on one level or another, and of course even more so if you are familiar with things in Europe. Second, the group making up the Spanish apartment is a veritable United Nations (or at least European Union) Security Council-like gathering, but writer-director C&eacute;dric Klapisch smartly avoids the easy stereotyping (most of the time), and gives these characters true depth. Third, the acting performances are ace throughout, none more so than Romain Duris as our lead character Xavier, but check out the almost under-the-radar role of Kelly Reilly as Wendy, who would of course play a much bigger role in the next installment. Fourth, in my humble opinion the Erasmus university study-abroad program is one of the best EU programs initiated ever, as it opens/deepens young people's understanding of other countries in Europe. Sadly the Erasmus program was not yet around when I attended university in my native Belgium (late 70s/early 80s). Last but not least, there is the very effective music placement of Radiohead's &#34;No Surprises&#34;, which plays on 3 or 4 occasions in the movie, perfectly capturing the bittersweet (but mostly sweet) tone of the movie. As Xavier notes at one time: &#34;L'auberge espagnole is a French expression which basically means that you get out of it what you put in&#34;, and these characters put in their all, much to our enjoyment.Bottom line: this is one great movie, sure to please most viewers. It's been over 10 years since I first saw it and I am pleasantly surprised how well the movie has held up. Next up is 2005's &#34;Les poup&eacute;es russes&#34; (&#34;Russian Dolls&#34;) before we end up with the most recent &#34;Casse-tte chinois&#34; (&#34;Chinese Puzzle)&#34;.

His look is of unadulterated love and appreciation of their diversity, their quirks, their secrets - and that's exactly, I believe, the look my husband and I had on our faces as we watched this movie last night. Yeah, it was New Year's Eve, but we never go to parties; we stay home and watch movies and do our own thing. L'Augerge Espagnole was wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. The BEST way to bring in the new year.I guess you'd call this a coming-of-age piece. It captures vignettes in the interrelated lives of these young people and a couple of others on the fringe, notably a neurosurgeon and his new shy wife, whom Xavier met on the plane. One of the best scenes is when his lesbian housemate instructs him about the seduction of women - graphically - so he can go about making his move on the shy wife. It works, and it's wonderfully done. Another great scene is when ALL the students mobilize to prevent Wendy's boyfriend (she's the Brit) from discovering that she's having herself a fling with an American; her doofus kid brother is the one who comes thru by shoving Wendy under the bed and, bare-chested, taking her place in bed beside the very confused American - well, you have to see it to appreciate it fully. Audrey Tautou is here, too (remember? The girl from Amelie?), as his unhappy girlfriend left behind in Paris. He describes her perfectly: She's a mess. Then he uses the same words to describe himself - and of course, both are correct. But who cares?

Then the joys of bonding with students from all over Europe.  My years abroad was life-changing and so I really identified with the adventure of the French student in Barcelona, whose story is so charmingly told here.This is a small story, but it's told with such attention to detail and so realistically, that it's very satisfying.  The events of the student's life...his affair with the wife of the man who took him in, his lessons in love from the lesbian, his own disappointment in love, as well as his discovery of the joys of the city, are so real that one has to be charmed by them.There are some terrific scenes--I particularly enjoyed two with the obnoxious William, the English fellow visiting his sister, Wendy.  He manages to insult everyone within minutes of his arrival, but there's something about him that is wonderful inspite of his limitations.  This is a very well written character!  His fruit-fly imitation was hilarious and his willingness to embarass himself to protect his sister really endeared him to the group and to the audience.Audry Tatou plays only a small, rather unsympathetic role, so the advertising on the DVD cover is misleading.  Not to worry, though, the rest of the cast is so good that she will not be missed.

His world is very boring. In France a huge part of the population works for the government. To get a ministry job, he must learn Spanish, so he leaves home for the first time and arrives in swinging Barcelona.  (See my review of ""Barcelona"") A newlywed couple, a young surgeon and his shy, but beautiful wife befriend him.  He lives with them briefly, but then takes up residence with students from all over Europe in a small apartment where they are practically crawling over each other when they are not drunk or high.  This is a metaphor for the youth of Europe working together in study and fun.  There's some stereotyping here, but it's very mild.  To the director's credit, the cultural traits are handled by viable vignettes.  There's the lesbian girl story, the handsome Dutchman discovers he's a father, the English girl is not as anal as her roommates thought when a young American beds her. The proud Spanish girl, the funny Italian, and the straight-laced German know how to party.But Xavier is thrown together with Anna-Sophia, the doctor's wife.  From his friend the Belgian lesbian, he learns the secret of making love to a woman.  Naturally Anna is so taken by Xavier's attentions, she falls for him passionately and they have an affair under her husband's nose.  Meanwhile, Xavier's whining French gal breaks with him.These are classic tribulations of youth.  How wonderful to find a place where one can go native at least once in a lifetime, whether Barcelona, Key West, or Tango Tango.  Can it be a permanent state of mind, the whirlwind of youth and sexuality?

774234,A1R7RSAMR1ST5M,B0000C9JFO,R.M.,"[3, 4]","In the movie, L'auberge espagnol (The Spanish Apartment) is translated as ""European pudding"" - an apt description of the movie it titles.  The plot?  Xavier, 24, out of school and unsure of his prospects spends a year in Barcelona.  Why? He's studying economics and learning Spanish so he can get a job in stocks back in his native Paris.  After three weeks of living on the couch of an acquaintance he met at the airport, our man finds a place with a group of European students in the same exchange program, and the eurpoean mixing commences.  The players?  Spanish, Belgian, English, Swedish, Italian, French, and German.  All are equally chill in a generic, college aged, exchange student way.  The story follows everyone as they work, study, play, fall in and out of love, and generally amuse us with their mistakes and foibles.  Though fitting seven strangers in one small apartment seems like a Real World setup (with arguments and sex to follow) the players all seem extremely mellow.  If there are fights, they're about the obnoxious houseguests...but even this can be either appreciated or ignored.  Perhaps it's all the pot smoking they're doing, but the roommates really did get along, and while they were at it they made me believe that anyone could live and play in Spain, even neurotic old me.L'auberge espagnol is a coming-of-age fable set in modern day Barcelona, where the players are hip and the Bohemian rules.  The movie is like a piece of cake (or pudding?): fluffy, sweet, and makes you feel good without weighing you down.  It's on the edge of being a chick-flick but doesn't have the happy ending you might expect.  It's a good film...and even better if you're going on an exchange program and want a morale boost.

Now, more than a year later after returning home, this charming film made me realize how much I enjoyed my experiences studying in Spain, cherished my friendships with other Erasmus students, and relived the embarrassing ""fish out of water"" moments that made my stay so memorable.Directed by C&eacute;dric Klapisch, ""L'auberge espagnole"" tells the tale of Xavier (Romain Duris), a twentysomething Parisian studying economics. Xavier decides to spend a year at the Universitat de Barcelona as an Erasmus student (a university exchange between EU member countries), and along the way he meets an assortment of other European students, locals, and transplanted French (a local at a bar offers to teach him ""puta madre"" Spanish, which made me laugh out loud.)Xavier arrives in Barcelona disoriented and brokenhearted at having to leave his girlfriend and the comfort of familiarity behind. Weighted down by a myriad of bags (which brought back plenty of memories of my arriving in Spain similarly loaded down), he wanders the unfamiliar streets, alone and friendless, not speaking either language fluently (Castillano, the official language of Spain, and Catal&aacute;n, the official language of Catalunya and Barcelona). After ditching the morose boarding accommodations provided by a friend of his hippie mother's, Xavier begins the grueling and expensive task of finding a flat.His search lands him in a flat with six other Erasmus students: Londoner Wendy (a noted clean freak), Aragonese Soledad, the gorgeous Italian Alessandro, Tobias from Germany, the Dane Lars, and latecomer Isabelle from Belgium. Slowly, Xavier adjusts to his new life: an utter lack of privacy, homesickness for his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou from Am&eacute;lie), studying, balanced with the occasional joint and night out clubbing. The seven flatmates generally get along, speaking with each other in English and Spanish. A wrench is thrown into the mix when Wendy's obnoxious brother William (Kevin Bishop) comes to spend two weeks with them and ends up offending everyone.Xavier also becomes infatuated with the wife of a French doctor working in Barcelona and the two begin an affair. Although he believes himself to be an adequate lover, Xavier is coached by the lesbian Isabelle on how to truly please a woman, and the result, as Xavier says, is ""like something from the movies.""The film is beautiful to look at, showcasing the architecture of Gaud&iacute; (Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell), the swaying palm trees, blue water and sandy beaches of Barcelona, and Paris at intervals as well.  The film's humor is reflected in the editing, ""you are here"" labels, and special effects. The music is an upbeat mix of new and old that perfectly reflects modern Europe, including contributions by Radiohead, Ali Farka Toure, Vicente Amigo, Kouz-1, Daft Punk and the late Arthur Rubinstein.My only complaints would be the lack of extras (there was a made-for-TV documentary of the making of (or ""making off"" as you'll see in France and Spain) the film, European Confusion, not included here), and the rather high price. The DVD contains both the widescreen and fullscreen versions.Overall, a gem of a film that brought back many happy memories of living in Spain (Burgos, in my case) and made me homesick for the many wonderful people and experiences I had while living there (I hope to teach in Barcelona in the near future). &iexcl;Viva Espa&ntilde;a!",5,A joyous mosaic of life in the European Union,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,3550,"[""L'auberge"", 'espagnole', 'was', 'playing', 'time', 'lived', 'Spain', 'fall', '2002', 'somehow', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'Now', 'more', 'year', 'later', 'returning', 'home', 'charming', 'film', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'experiences', 'studying', 'Spain', 'cherished', 'friendships', 'other', 'Erasmus', 'students', 'relived', 'embarrassing', 'fish', 'water', 'moments', 'made', 'stay', 'so', 'memorable.Directed', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'Klapisch', ""L'auberge"", 'espagnole', 'tale', 'Xavier', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'twentysomething', 'Parisian', 'studying', 'economics', 'Xavier', 'decides', 'spend', 'year', 'Universitat', 'de', 'Barcelona', 'Erasmus', 'student', 'university', 'exchange', 'EU', 'member', 'countries', 'way', 'assortment', 'other', 'European', 'students', 'locals', 'transplanted', 'French', 'local', 'bar', 'offers', 'teach', 'puta', 'madre', 'Spanish', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'Xavier', 'arrives', 'Barcelona', 'disoriented', 'brokenhearted', 'having', 'leave', 'girlfriend', 'comfort', 'familiarity', 'Weighted', 'down', 'myriad', 'bags', 'brought', 'back', 'plenty', 'memories', 'arriving', 'Spain', 'similarly', 'loaded', 'down', 'unfamiliar', 'streets', 'alone', 'friendless', 'not', 'speaking', 'language', 'fluently', 'Castillano', 'official', 'language', 'Spain', 'Catal', 'aacute', 'official', 'language', 'Catalunya', 'Barcelona', 'ditching', 'morose', 'boarding', 'accommodations', 'provided', 'friend', 'hippie', 'mother', 'Xavier', 'grueling', 'expensive', 'task', 'finding', 'flat.His', 'search', 'flat', 'six', 'other', 'Erasmus', 'students', 'Londoner', 'Wendy', 'noted', 'clean', 'freak', 'Aragonese', 'Soledad', 'gorgeous', 'Italian', 'Alessandro', 'Tobias', 'Germany', 'Dane', 'Lars', 'latecomer', 'Isabelle', 'Belgium', 'Slowly', 'Xavier', 'new', 'life', 'utter', 'lack', 'privacy', 'homesickness', 'girlfriend', 'Martine', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Am', 'eacute', 'studying', 'balanced', 'occasional', 'joint', 'night', 'out', 'clubbing', 'seven', 'flatmates', 'generally', 'get', 'along', 'speaking', 'other', 'English', 'Spanish', 'A', 'wrench', 'thrown', 'mix', 'when', 'Wendy', 'obnoxious', 'brother', 'William', 'Kevin', 'Bishop', 'spend', 'two', 'weeks', 'up', 'offending', 'everyone.Xavier', 'also', 'infatuated', 'wife', 'French', 'doctor', 'working', 'Barcelona', 'two', 'begin', 'affair', 'be', 'adequate', 'lover', 'Xavier', 'coached', 'lesbian', 'Isabelle', 'how', 'truly', 'please', 'woman', 'result', 'Xavier', 'something', 'movies', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'showcasing', 'architecture', 'Gaud', 'iacute', 'Sagrada', 'Familia', 'Parc', 'Guell', 'swaying', 'palm', 'trees', 'blue', 'water', 'sandy', 'beaches', 'Barcelona', 'Paris', 'intervals', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'humor', 'reflected', 'editing', 'are', 'here', 'labels', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'upbeat', 'mix', 'new', 'old', 'perfectly', 'modern', 'Europe', 'including', 'contributions', 'Radiohead', 'Ali', 'Farka', 'Toure', 'Vicente', 'Amigo', 'Kouz-1', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'late', 'Arthur', 'Rubinstein.My', 'only', 'complaints', 'would', 'be', 'lack', 'extras', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'documentary', 'making', 'making', 'off', ""'ll"", 'see', 'France', 'Spain', 'film', 'European', 'Confusion', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'rather', 'high', 'price', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions.Overall', 'gem', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'happy', 'memories', 'living', 'Spain', 'Burgos', 'case', 'made', 'homesick', 'many', 'wonderful', 'people', 'experiences', 'had', 'living', 'hope', 'teach', 'Barcelona', 'near', 'future', 'iexcl', 'Viva', 'Espa', 'ntilde']",N/A

Ms. Tautou was cast in this film before the international hit of &quot;Amelie,&quot; so her role here is a comparatively small one.  And her character as the girl-friend of the protagonist does NOT live in the apartment, and that means she stayys onut of the screen for a long time.Roman Duris stars in this lightweight comedy-drama as Zavier, 25 year-old French student, who decides to study abroad (in Spain) simply because he wants secure a good job.  In the title apartment in Barcelona, however, he learns something much more important during the eventful one year in absolute freedom.That is a rough sketch of the story, and this apartment plays the role of so-called &quot;melting pot&quot; of European people.  (Incidentally, its UK title is &quot;Potluck.&quot;)  In this not-so-clean but still magical place, you see students from France, UK, Germany. Denmark, Italy, and Belgium.  These colorful nationalities of EU represent the unbrindled energy of the youth, and if you have spent young days as they do, in a foreign land with friends, you wil easily relate to the agnst of Zavier, the portrait of average young boy.Director Cedric Klapisch repeats his light touch found in &quot;When the Cat's Away,&quot; and the script was written in 12 day.  The film itself was shot in only 4 months ... well, so he says.  The film, as a consequence, shows little surprise -- there is a love-triangle which is too predictable, just another case of uninterested husband and unhappy wife, which is tradtional since the days of Madame Bovery.  And the silly hubby is a doctor again.  The characters lack the depth -- only the students from Britain show some -- and the commentary on the cultural difference doesn't bite.But the film (shot in digital camera) captures the truth of youth, and the care-free community depicted here has an undeniable charm that would be most appealing to the young people, with its frank descriptions of being really young.

A coed group of students from different countries share an apartment in Barcelona where they come of age and hit the books (learning a few hard lessons not in them.) That's a large order which the young cast accomplishes admirably.We meet them through a French kid (Romain Duris) enrolled to soak up Spanish culture in order to land a corporate job, much to the dismay of his girlfriend in Paris (Audrey Tatou). He shares a bedroom with a lesbian who teaches him how to seduce the wife of a neurologist. The brother (Kevin Bishop in a nifty performance) of another roommate shows up unexpectedly and saves his sister's reputation. Out of the chaos and camaraderie of their salad days emerges a reality-based hope for the future.

Then ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is your kind of movie! Why our hero Xavier does this is never explained, but of course women go wild over him anyway in this movie, a rustic haze of exchange-student wish-fulfillment. His gf back in Paris makes up with him even though he stands her up on her birthday, and a feminine, modelesque lesbian gives him hands-on seduction tips, which he soon puts to work on the young wife of a neurologist (who has a more traditional comb-over).Xavier is an upper-middle class metrosexual who talks like he grew up listening to NPR. He takes ""stupid American"" to mean ""stupid white American man,"" he takes ""Europe"" to mean ""Western Europe,"" he displays his backside (the opposite sex does not reciprocate) - you get the idea. So - after this grueling year at the Real World Barcelona - learning about stock options, trying rudimentary salsa dancing, and keeping his unnecessary comb-over in place, can Xavier graduate and rise to the challenge of accepting a cushy job in the French bureaucracy? (I'm not making this up.) If you can stand the suspense, watch this movie.Sharing a funky little Catalan flat with Xavier are other EU scholars. Some of them don't get much screen time, but they're all photogenic and I'm sure they're absolutely cool people - at one point their mugs are flashed on screen in a montage so we know they were important to Xavier and they changed his life. Do I hear sequel?This movie has dialogue in English, French, Spanish and Catalan - it must have been tough for the subtitlers, who make one obvious blooper - ""hair-brained.""

774247,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B0000C9JFO,Young Kim,"[5, 9]","L'Auberge Espagnole has a double meaning.  The literal translation, ""the Spanish Apartment"" can be interpreted as the place where Xavier, the protagonist played by the Frenchman Romain Duris, finds himself during his stay in Barcelona.  The other meaning refers to a type of pudding whereby people bring their own ingredients and mix them together to form the main dish, which is particularly applicable in this movie, which details the lives of international students living in Spain for a year.Xavier is the son of divorced parents, his father is a person with connects with French bureaucracy, and his mother is a hippie.  Xavier is dating Martine, played by the luminous Audrey Tautou of Amelie and Dirty Pretty Things.  Contrary to the DVD cover, Ms. Tautou only plays a minor role, with less than 15 minutes total screen time.  Xavier feels trapped by his current condition, his love for Martine slowly fading away and without many prospects for a career after school.  His father pulls some strings and finds a job for Xavier in the bureaucracy, but they require that he study Spanish and economy.  Xavier decides to enroll in the Erasmus program, which is a foreign student exchange system whereby students in the European Union  can go to member countries and learn the local language and take classes as well.He finds himself in Barcelona, temporarily living with a young French doctor and his wife, whom he met on the trip.  After some mishaps, Xavier moves to the titular Spanish apartment, where he rooms with an eclectic mix of students, British, German, Dutch, and Italian.  With these fellow strangers in a strange land, Xavier will learn much about life, love, and himself.L'Auberge Espagnole is hard to categorize, and much like its title, it has layers of meaning.  On one hand it is a comedy, with many funny situations taking place, including fun with words, situational comedy and even broad slapstick; particularly memorable is a desperate dash that occurs when the boyfriend of the one of the roommates decides to make an unannounced visit at the precise moment that she is occupied with another man.  On the other, it is a drama, touching on issues of meaning, the pursuit of happiness and the crossroads that we all find ourselves as we finish college and must embark on ""adult"" pursuits of job and family.  It seems surprisingly real in many levels, especially in relation to the feeling of alienation that we all feel when we find ourselves in a new environment.  The acting is natural and unforced; the characters themselves have layers of personality; no one is simply the hero or the antagonist, the characters have conflicts and flaws within themselves, and that makes them that much more real.  As a matter of fact, possibly because I'm not familiar with this particular cast, I was drawn into their lives that much more, so much so that when Ms. Tautou is onscreen, it jarred me a bit, seeing her famous face in this mundane environment, taking me out for brief moments from the immersion of the movie.The movie starts mainly in French, but switches over to English, French and Spanish in Barcelona, as Xavier gains fluency in the local language.
