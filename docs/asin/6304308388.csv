414096,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304308388,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 15]","I would first like to make the comment that this is no comedy.  For those that consider this film a valuable part of Hollywood cinema due to the comedic aspects need to get their eyes examined along with their minds.  I do not think that I laughed at all during this film, but I would like to mention that I do not think that is a bad thing.  Not laughing at this film means that it hit you at a different level.  I witnessed a beautiful film with some highly intelligent actors painting a dark and disturbing picture of a sexual world circa 1960.  I suppose I was thinking that this was going to be a ""screwball"" comedy, which completely threw me off balance when the events of this film occurred.  Never have I witnessed such a bold attack on the sexual revolution of the 60s and its effect on the business world.  It was a slap in the face to see the way that Billy Wilder represented corporate America and honestly, it felt really good.  To see this lonely man turned away from his apartment at all hours of the night because his boss needed a place to take their mistresses was sad, not funny, yet in The Apartment it worked beautifully.To begin, this film revolved around the actors.  If you would not have had such strong actors like Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray honestly conquering their roles than this film would not have succeeded as it did.  It won Oscars for a reason, and even watched by today's standard of Hollywood I think that everyone involved should be very proud.  Their work was the best Hollywood had to offer.  Lemmon successfully portrayed this hurt every-man that you could easily find yourself engulfed within.  MacLaine, beautiful in her young age, was an emotional powerhouse. Her eyes could have told the story without any words.  You could feel her emotions through her eyes, and it was outstanding.  I must say that my favorite actor in this entire film was Fred MacMurray.  His portrayal of the typical ""boss"" who seems to use his powers to control instead of help, was perfect.  In fact, even if you watch the film today, you may still be able to see your boss in MacMurray's portrayal.  For once, it was a solid cast.  It had a structured story that was heightened by sublime actors that knew exactly what they needed to do.  I would have to say that this is one of the greatest pairings in cinema history, these three together could have taken Hollywood by storm, and it is evident in The Apartment.As I stated before, the characters are exceptional, but coupled with their performances is a rich story that seems developed well before its time.  I was not expecting to see such a sexual driven film released from the 60s.  Films of this nature typically hint towards sex, but never quite spell it out, but in The Apartment it is in your face throughout the course of the film.  From the opening sequence until the end, sex seems to be the biggest underlying theme of this film.  In the world of C.C. Baxter, all he seems to know is sex, business, and the occasional conversation with the elevator girl.  You can't help but wonder if that wasn't what was going through the minds of our fathers as they headed to the corporate world on a daily basis.  It was such a slap to the face of the day to day America.  To think that in this nation portrayed with family values and moral uprising that The Apartment would emerge as the breakout film of 1960.  It shocked me.  I think the reason that it did so was because of the strong writing, the powerful story, and the emergence of such innocent ""characters"" (as mentioned above).  There were moments during this film that I honestly wanted to walk into the television, tell everyone to stop, and explain what was happening because I didn't want anyone to get hurt in the end.  Isn't that a sign of a long-lasting powerful film?  To me it is.Overall, I must say that The Apartment left my jaw on the floor.  While my wife will disagree with me, I thought that it was a brilliant moment in cinematic history.  Jack Lemmon could not have been handed a greater roll, nor could he have pulled it off with such beauty and pizzazz.  The story will shock and amaze you for nearly two hours.  We are taken into a world in which we feel comfortable in, we feel as if we have been there before, and we can only thank the imaginative mind of Billy Wilder for that.  He takes those moments in our lives that we wholeheartedly want to forget and places them in the window for all to see.  His mockery of corporations, of the small man working his way to the top, and the disasters that follow are nothing short of classic.  I have never witnessed a film quite like this and I hope I never do again.  The Apartment was a once in a lifetime enjoyment, and I cannot wait to revisit it soon to see what I may have missed!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,...and then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were.,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,4830,"['would', 'first', 'like', 'make', 'comment', 'comedy', 'consider', 'film', 'valuable', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'due', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'need', 'get', 'eyes', 'examined', 'minds', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'laughed', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'Not', 'laughing', 'film', 'hit', 'different', 'level', 'witnessed', 'beautiful', 'film', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'actors', 'painting', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'sexual', 'world', 'circa', '1960', 'suppose', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'completely', 'threw', 'off', 'balance', 'when', 'events', 'film', 'occurred', 'Never', 'have', 'witnessed', 'bold', 'attack', 'sexual', 'revolution', '60s', 'effect', 'business', 'world', 'was', 'slap', 'face', 'see', 'way', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'represented', 'corporate', 'America', 'honestly', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'see', 'lonely', 'man', 'turned', 'away', 'apartment', 'hours', 'night', 'boss', 'needed', 'place', 'take', 'mistresses', 'was', 'sad', 'not', 'funny', 'yet', 'Apartment', 'worked', 'beautifully.To', 'begin', 'film', 'revolved', 'actors', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'strong', 'actors', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'honestly', 'conquering', 'roles', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'succeeded', 'did', 'won', 'Oscars', 'reason', 'even', 'watched', 'today', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'everyone', 'involved', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'work', 'was', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'offer', 'Lemmon', 'successfully', 'portrayed', 'hurt', 'every-man', 'could', 'easily', 'find', 'engulfed', 'MacLaine', 'beautiful', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'emotional', 'powerhouse', 'eyes', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'story', 'words', 'could', 'feel', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'was', 'outstanding', 'must', 'say', 'favorite', 'actor', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'portrayal', 'typical', 'boss', 'who', 'use', 'powers', 'control', 'instead', 'help', 'was', 'perfect', 'fact', 'even', 'watch', 'film', 'today', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'boss', 'MacMurray', 'portrayal', 'once', 'was', 'solid', 'cast', 'had', 'structured', 'story', 'was', 'heightened', 'sublime', 'actors', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'greatest', 'pairings', 'cinema', 'history', 'three', 'together', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'Hollywood', 'storm', 'evident', 'Apartment.As', 'stated', 'characters', 'are', 'exceptional', 'coupled', 'performances', 'rich', 'story', 'developed', 'well', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'see', 'such', 'sexual', 'driven', 'film', 'released', '60s', 'Films', 'nature', 'typically', 'hint', 'towards', 'sex', 'never', 'quite', 'spell', 'out', 'Apartment', 'face', 'course', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'end', 'sex', 'be', 'biggest', 'underlying', 'theme', 'film', 'world', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'all', 'know', 'sex', 'business', 'occasional', 'conversation', 'elevator', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'going', 'minds', 'fathers', 'headed', 'corporate', 'world', 'daily', 'basis', 'was', 'such', 'slap', 'face', 'day', 'day', 'America', 'think', 'nation', 'portrayed', 'family', 'values', 'moral', 'uprising', 'Apartment', 'would', 'emerge', 'breakout', 'film', '1960', 'shocked', 'think', 'reason', 'did', 'so', 'was', 'strong', 'writing', 'powerful', 'story', 'emergence', 'such', 'innocent', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'walk', 'television', 'tell', 'everyone', 'stop', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'get', 'hurt', 'end', ""n't"", 'sign', 'long-lasting', 'powerful', 'film', 'is.Overall', 'must', 'say', 'Apartment', 'left', 'jaw', 'floor', 'wife', 'will', 'disagree', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'greater', 'roll', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'beauty', 'pizzazz', 'story', 'will', 'shock', 'amaze', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'taken', 'world', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'only', 'thank', 'imaginative', 'mind', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'moments', 'lives', 'wholeheartedly', 'want', 'forget', 'places', 'window', 'see', 'mockery', 'corporations', 'small', 'man', 'working', 'way', 'top', 'disasters', 'follow', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'classic', 'have', 'never', 'witnessed', 'film', 'quite', 'hope', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'Apartment', 'was', 'once', 'lifetime', 'enjoyment', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'revisit', 'soon', 'see', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

414100,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304308388,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","When watching `The Apartment' I expected something completely different.  I expected something outlandish and slapstick and more in the vein of `The Odd Couple' and I think that because I really had no idea what this movie was about.  I didn't bother reading the back of the DVD case because I knew I wanted to see it based on its reputation alone.  Why spoil the surprise, and so I brought it home and popped it in and here I am now, writing my review of one of the best comedies I've ever seen.The reason `The Apartment' is so great is because it is extremely smart.  It's funny, sure, but in an honest and believable manner.  It's witty and original and the chemistry between the stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine is effortless.The story is not a simple one to explain without giving too much away, and I hate giving too much away so I will attempt this the best I can.  Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a junior accountant for a New York City firm, who found an interesting way of climbing the corporate ladder.  Baxter (of `Buddy Boy' as he is called by his workmates) lends out his apartment to the married men he works with who want to entertain their extramarital flings without their wives knowledge.  This act leads to some confusion among those living in Baxter's building, garners him a bad reputation and proves to be quite the inconvenience to him, but professionally he is `moving on up'.  Then he meets the beautiful Fran Kubelik and things look as though they might move in the right direction socially for him as well; but there are still a few roadblocks he must maneuver through before he's home free.Jack Lemmon is irresistibly charming here.  His `loser' Baxter is endearing to the viewer.  When Fran asks why she can't fall in love with a man like him you are just jumping at the bit to convince her that he is the man for her.  Shirley MacLaine is also great as Fran, truly mysterious but in a compelling way.  She's sweet and charming and naturally and genuinely relatable.  Fred MacMurray is fantastic as Sheldrake, Baxter's boss.  He's got this genuine charm that aids to his manipulative nature and gives him a sense of reality.  He is so real.  Jack Kruschen is also great as Dr. Dreyfuss, but I would have nominated MacMurray over him if it were up to me.`The Apartment' is a charming movie that is funny but one cannot overlook its dramatic air.  There is a lot in this film that is `no laughing matter' so-to-speak, for it deals with some very serious subjects such as infidelity and suicide.  Thankfully writer/director Billy Wilder approaches this with candor and grace, delivering a serious film that, while not making light of the subject, manages to infuse enough honest humor to make it utterly enjoyable.",5,It's not your average comedy; it's `above' average...,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2746,"['When', 'watching', 'Apartment', 'expected', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'expected', 'something', 'outlandish', 'slapstick', 'more', 'vein', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'think', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'reading', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'knew', 'wanted', 'see', 'based', 'reputation', 'alone', 'Why', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'so', 'brought', 'home', 'popped', 'here', 'am', 'now', 'writing', 'review', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'reason', 'Apartment', 'so', 'great', 'extremely', 'smart', 'funny', 'sure', 'honest', 'believable', 'manner', 'witty', 'original', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'effortless.The', 'story', 'not', 'simple', 'one', 'explain', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'hate', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'attempt', 'best', 'can', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'junior', 'accountant', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'firm', 'who', 'found', 'interesting', 'way', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'Baxter', 'Buddy', 'Boy', 'called', 'workmates', 'out', 'apartment', 'married', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'entertain', 'extramarital', 'flings', 'wives', 'knowledge', 'act', 'confusion', 'living', 'Baxter', 'building', 'garners', 'bad', 'reputation', 'be', 'quite', 'inconvenience', 'professionally', 'moving', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'things', 'look', 'might', 'move', 'right', 'direction', 'socially', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'roadblocks', 'must', 'maneuver', 'home', 'free.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'irresistibly', 'charming', 'here', 'loser', 'Baxter', 'endearing', 'viewer', 'When', 'Fran', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'are', 'just', 'jumping', 'bit', 'convince', 'man', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'also', 'great', 'Fran', 'truly', 'mysterious', 'compelling', 'way', 'sweet', 'charming', 'naturally', 'genuinely', 'relatable', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'fantastic', 'Sheldrake', 'Baxter', 'boss', 'got', 'genuine', 'charm', 'manipulative', 'nature', 'sense', 'reality', 'so', 'real', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'also', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Dreyfuss', 'would', 'have', 'nominated', 'MacMurray', 'were', 'up', 'me.', 'Apartment', 'charming', 'movie', 'funny', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'overlook', 'dramatic', 'air', 'lot', 'film', 'no', 'laughing', 'matter', 'so-to-speak', 'very', 'serious', 'subjects', 'such', 'infidelity', 'suicide', 'Thankfully', 'writer/director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'candor', 'grace', 'delivering', 'serious', 'film', 'not', 'making', 'light', 'subject', 'infuse', 'enough', 'honest', 'humor', 'make', 'utterly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

This is a terrific movie, and lots of other reviewers have already ticked off all of the things that make it terrific. It's smart and sophisticated, with plenty of witty dialogue. Although some of the details are dated, such as the interminable rows of pencil pushers at desks with adding machines, the underlying office politics are just as real and just as nasty today as ever. The acting is great. Not only are Lemmon and MacLaine wonderful together, the rest of the cast is also excellent.The only thing I have to add is that, despite clever lines, funny scenes and an acceptably happy ending, THE APARTMENT is as much a drama as it is a comedy. The seamy undercurrent of office politics and the way people ruthlessly use each in their personal relationships gives this little tale a grim, almost vicious, feel at times. Much of what you see in THE APARTMENT is not the least bit funny.Not to be repetitive, but this is an outstanding movie. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's not really a family movie, though. True to the period in which it was made, there's no overt sexual content, but there are definitely adult themes and kids probably wouldn't fully ""get"" what's going on, anyway.

414107,A2EL3990HXOMZB,6304308388,Antonio Robert,"[0, 1]","As a lover of old Hollywood films, I consider Billy Wilder one of the most gifted filmmakers. Interestingly, ""The Apartment"" is at least the eleventh film I've seen from him, while some of them are still hard to come by for me (still waiting to come across ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""Double Indemnity""). In the past few months, a local MGM channel showed ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"", ""Love In the Afternoon"", ""The Fortune Cookie"" and the dud ""Irma La Douce"". That said, I was waiting with high anticipation for ""The Apartment"" and......well, as a movie full of cleverly put-together plot, with all Wilderian ingredients added and excellent performances throughout, ""The Apartment"" still left something to be desired with so high a profile (recently it ranked #80 in the latest AFI 100 American Films). One word occurs to me... this film is DATED, and more than a bit.The truth is that the mercilessly honest look at shallow life of American corporate officials could ring unpleasantly true in the 1960, when the film got its important three Oscars. Since then, however, the times have changed and I think the passing time hurt the film considerably more than, for instance, the lighter ""Some Like It Hot"". Still, hats off to Wilder for one of his most poignant social commentaries ever put on the screen. Nowadays, filmmakers would not get away with depicting women as so naive creatures as this film somehow indicates they are.Anyway, as you will see, I still rank ""The Apartment"" quite high in my personal chart of Wilder's films and I certainly won't throw ""The Apartment"" out of my collection. Just for the lovely Shirley MacLaine and spot-on Jack Lemmon and Fred MacMurray. And did I mention the laughs, too?1. Sunset Boulevard, 2. Some Like It Hot, 3. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 4.

414108,A1SSA0MF161794,6304308388,Ava Barbi,"[1, 1]","To avoid redundancy, I will not provide a comprehensive analysis ofThe Apartment (Collector's Edition). A great many reviewers here on Amazon.com already have written such excellent critiques of Billy Wilder's entertaining farce.  My two cents, then, mostly will deal with the movie's portrayal of working women and its exploration of their inner lives.The Apartment was released in 1960, and in nearly half a century some things remain the same when it comes to matters of the heart.  Well, when the four chambers belong to the female of the species, that is.  Although we chicks have made head-turning advancements in the workplace, now and then smashing through the glass ceiling like the underpaid stuntwomen that we are, some broads (present company excepted) still fall for the tricky quick steps of boardroom merengue.  Instead of acting as if they have two left feet, these sisters should be kneeing the bossman's twins and asking for a raise while he hits the highest note in his career.  Forty-nine years after The Apartment: same dance, same aria.Thus, every time I watch the scenes of awkward intimacy between Shirley MacLaine's Miss Kubelik and Fred MacMurray's Mr. Sheldrake, I get onion eyes.  And every time I listen to Edie Adams warn MacLaine -- secretary to elevator operator -- about those ""ringydingdings,"" I get a lump in my throat as wide as a boulder blocking love's highway.  Now, I have watched The Apartment more than 15 times since my first viewing on cable's TCM channel and subsequently on video, so those are a lot of lumps.  But then something wonderful happens:  Lovable, lonely loser C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon in impeccable form) lightens the mood with a spasmodic facial mannerism, piercing the air with his trademark cackle curtailed by his own hyperstressed pronouncements.  Only then can I swallow, breathe and chuckle the hurt away.Such is the power of great acting and masterful direction, anchored by a superb script.  Through Wilder's film lens, viewers get to study the contours of hearts that have been broken, barely mended, only to be fissured again.  However, considering all of the impersonal technology in homes and offices today, who's to say that the alienation as personified by Fran Kubelik's and C.C. Baxter's circumstances is more profound?  Suited saber-toothed tigers in fedoras carrying little black books have evolved into savvy Bluetoothed cybercats with mobile phones that have roaming charges and unlimited space for all those ""purrsonal"" contacts.Just as anti-corporate cynicism has endured into the 21st century, so has The Apartment -- easily one of Billy Wilder's finest satires.  The movie should be required viewing at hedonistic office parties to remind everyone, especially the male of the species, about the tragic consequences of shredding business ethics for the purpose of getting down to business on a desktop or in a restroom stall.  Or, could it be that the working stiff's lustful goals have turned so absurd that an accidentally flushed BlackBerry is considered more serious than a few *lodged* staples and paper clips?  Oh my.Sexual pathos aside, the comedy of C.C. Baxter's apartment situation is first-rate.  He's a lucky so-and-so to pay less than market rate (even for 1960!) for his immense square footage.  Nevertheless, he has what we urbanites today call a revolving-door apartment.  Only, he's the one who keeps leaving!  As attached as I am to my apartment, I sense his misery each time he's forced to walk those posh Upper West Side streets.  Poor old bast--er, Baxter.  Well, that's how the luck turns, keywise.  (That's an inside joke; only viewers of The Apartment would get it.)  Yet another wild circumstance that this dark comedy-drama presents for viewers' critique and voyeuristic pleasure.Speaking of pleasure, the adulterous fantasies played out in the film are darkly Wilder.  Back in 1960, I wasn't yet a gleam in my father's eye.  Come to think of it, with all the illicit fun folks seemed to be having back in the 1960s, perhaps I wasn't meant to be a gleam in my mother's eye, either.I couldn't more strongly recommend that you purchaseThe Apartment (Collector's Edition).  After you have, please sit back and let Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's story unreel in black-and-white before your eyes.  You'll see why The Apartment earned five Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.",5,"Love's for Rent, Desire's for Hire, in Wilder Satire",1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,4421,"['avoid', 'redundancy', 'will', 'not', 'provide', 'comprehensive', 'analysis', 'ofThe', 'Apartment', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'great', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'already', 'have', 'written', 'such', 'excellent', 'critiques', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'entertaining', 'farce', 'two', 'cents', 'then', 'mostly', 'will', 'deal', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'working', 'women', 'exploration', 'inner', 'lives.The', 'Apartment', 'was', 'released', '1960', 'nearly', 'century', 'things', 'remain', 'same', 'when', 'matters', 'heart', 'Well', 'when', 'four', 'chambers', 'belong', 'female', 'species', 'chicks', 'have', 'made', 'head-turning', 'advancements', 'workplace', 'now', 'then', 'smashing', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'underpaid', 'stuntwomen', 'are', 'broads', 'present', 'company', 'excepted', 'still', 'fall', 'tricky', 'quick', 'steps', 'boardroom', 'merengue', 'Instead', 'acting', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'sisters', 'should', 'be', 'kneeing', 'bossman', 'twins', 'asking', 'raise', 'highest', 'note', 'career', 'Forty-nine', 'years', 'Apartment', 'same', 'dance', 'same', 'aria.Thus', 'time', 'watch', 'scenes', 'awkward', 'intimacy', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Miss', 'Kubelik', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Mr.', 'Sheldrake', 'get', 'onion', 'eyes', 'time', 'listen', 'Edie', 'Adams', 'warn', 'MacLaine', 'secretary', 'elevator', 'operator', 'ringydingdings', 'get', 'lump', 'throat', 'as', 'wide', 'boulder', 'blocking', 'love', 'highway', 'Now', 'have', 'watched', 'Apartment', 'more', '15', 'times', 'first', 'viewing', 'cable', 'TCM', 'channel', 'subsequently', 'video', 'are', 'lot', 'lumps', 'then', 'something', 'wonderful', 'happens', 'Lovable', 'lonely', 'loser', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'impeccable', 'form', 'mood', 'spasmodic', 'facial', 'mannerism', 'piercing', 'air', 'trademark', 'cackle', 'curtailed', 'own', 'hyperstressed', 'pronouncements', 'Only', 'then', 'can', 'swallow', 'breathe', 'chuckle', 'hurt', 'away.Such', 'power', 'great', 'acting', 'masterful', 'direction', 'anchored', 'superb', 'script', 'Wilder', 'film', 'lens', 'viewers', 'get', 'study', 'contours', 'hearts', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'barely', 'mended', 'only', 'be', 'fissured', 'again', 'However', 'considering', 'impersonal', 'technology', 'homes', 'offices', 'today', 'who', 'say', 'alienation', 'personified', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'circumstances', 'more', 'profound', 'Suited', 'saber-toothed', 'tigers', 'fedoras', 'carrying', 'little', 'black', 'books', 'have', 'evolved', 'savvy', 'Bluetoothed', 'cybercats', 'mobile', 'phones', 'have', 'roaming', 'charges', 'unlimited', 'space', 'purrsonal', 'contacts.Just', 'anti-corporate', 'cynicism', 'endured', '21st', 'century', 'so', 'Apartment', 'easily', 'one', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'finest', 'satires', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'hedonistic', 'office', 'parties', 'remind', 'everyone', 'especially', 'male', 'species', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'shredding', 'business', 'ethics', 'purpose', 'getting', 'down', 'business', 'desktop', 'restroom', 'stall', 'could', 'be', 'working', 'stiff', 'lustful', 'goals', 'have', 'turned', 'so', 'absurd', 'accidentally', 'flushed', 'BlackBerry', 'considered', 'more', 'serious', 'few', '*lodged*', 'staples', 'paper', 'clips', 'Oh', 'my.Sexual', 'pathos', 'aside', 'comedy', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'apartment', 'situation', 'first-rate', 'lucky', 'so-and-so', 'pay', 'less', 'market', 'rate', 'even', '1960', 'immense', 'square', 'footage', 'Nevertheless', 'what', 'urbanites', 'today', 'call', 'revolving-door', 'apartment', 'Only', 'one', 'who', 'leaving', 'As', 'attached', 'am', 'apartment', 'sense', 'misery', 'time', 'forced', 'walk', 'posh', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'streets', 'Poor', 'old', 'bast', 'er', 'Baxter', 'Well', 'how', 'luck', 'keywise', 'inside', 'joke', 'only', 'viewers', 'Apartment', 'would', 'get', 'Yet', 'wild', 'circumstance', 'dark', 'comedy-drama', 'presents', 'viewers', 'critique', 'voyeuristic', 'pleasure.Speaking', 'pleasure', 'adulterous', 'fantasies', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'are', 'darkly', 'Wilder', 'Back', '1960', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'gleam', 'father', 'eye', 'Come', 'think', 'illicit', 'fun', 'folks', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'back', '1960s', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'gleam', 'mother', 'eye', 'either.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'more', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'purchaseThe', 'Apartment', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'have', 'please', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'Wilder', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'story', 'unreel', 'black-and-white', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'Apartment', 'earned', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Picture']",N/A

414116,A2LN2AK7HNBI8N,6304308388,Bruce Varner,"[3, 3]","I bought this DVD for research purposes.  I will be performing in ""Promises, Promises"" the musical based on ""The Apartment"".  I am so glad I bought this DVD, as this is a great film.  That's not just my opinion.  ""The Apartment"" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won 5, including Best Picture and Best Director in 1960.This film will speak to you on many levels.  On one level, it is an indictment of corporate politics and a condemnation of philandering executives.  On another level, it is an examination of extramarital affairs, and the sometimes dire consequences.  On another level, it is a love story where a damsel in distress literally meets her white knight.  Then again, it is about people who fall into the abyss, only to find redemption and the happiness they deserve.  It is about knowing what is right, and finally finding the courage to do what is right.The cinematography is great, as is the lighting.  The setup is perfect.  We are shown the enormity of a life insurance company, with its 31,000 employees in the Manhattan headquarters.  The shots of the teeming, faceless humanity are fantastic.  The long shots of the endless office are fabulous, and will make you appreciate black and white.  Out of this morass, we are asked to get to know 3 people; C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine) and J.D. Sheldrake (Fred Macmurray).  They are embroiled in a love triangle that will change all of their lives.The late, great, Jack Lemmon is a wonderful C.C. (Chuck) Baxter.  Lemmon was a dapper 35 years of age when this film was made.  He wants to get ahead, and he does so by selling himself out.  He loans his apartment to senior executives for their extramarital assignations.  They in turn promise to move him up the corporate ladder.  There is humor in this, as Baxter trys to juggle ""appointments"" with 4 different execs.  But, as in the rest of this film, there is a pathos to it.Chuck has quite a thing for cute elevator operator Fran, played by a 26 year old Shirley Maclaine.  She returns his innocent flirtations, but for some reason keeps her distance.  Maclaine is all sweetness and vulnerability.  So, why won't she go out with Chuck?As it turns out, Fran has a boyfriend.  That boyfriend is the Director of Personnel, J.D. Sheldrake.  Sheldrake is quite married, and has slept with many women in the office, including his Secretary Peggy Olsen.  Macmurray plays a wonderful cad.  He is not sleazy or oily.  He is able to continue stringing Fran along until one fateful Christmas Eve.I won't continue discussing the plot, as you need to experience it as it unfolds.  While ""what happens next"" is not a huge leap of the imagination, the skill of the actors and the sensitive direction make for fascinating viewing.  There are some great scenes in this film.  The pivotal Christmas Eve scene with Sheldrake and Fran will get you at a visceral level.  Macmurray and Maclaine shine here; her with vulnerability and his meeting her vulnerability with incredible insensitivity.  Brilliant.  Lemmon shines in the ""discovery"" scene when he figures out that Fran is involved with Sheldrake.  Sheldrake had borrowed the apartment for a rendezvous with Fran, and Fran left her compact behind.  The compact had a broken mirror. Chuck, not knowing who it belonged to, returned it to Sheldrake.  Later, at a Christmas Eve party, Fran loans her mirror to Chuck, who recognizes it.  Lemmon communicated so many emotions with his face, his voice, and his body.  He was such an actor.This movie is listed among the Top 100 movies of all time, and it deserves a place on your shelf.Highly recommended.",5,Superb Movie,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,3637,"['bought', 'DVD', 'research', 'purposes', 'will', 'be', 'performing', 'Promises', 'Promises', 'musical', 'based', 'Apartment', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'opinion', 'Apartment', 'was', 'nominated', '10', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'won', '5', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', '1960.This', 'film', 'will', 'speak', 'many', 'levels', 'one', 'level', 'indictment', 'corporate', 'politics', 'condemnation', 'philandering', 'executives', 'level', 'examination', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'sometimes', 'dire', 'consequences', 'level', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'damsel', 'distress', 'literally', 'white', 'knight', 'Then', 'again', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'abyss', 'only', 'find', 'redemption', 'happiness', 'deserve', 'knowing', 'what', 'right', 'finally', 'finding', 'courage', 'do', 'what', 'right.The', 'cinematography', 'great', 'lighting', 'setup', 'perfect', 'are', 'shown', 'enormity', 'life', 'insurance', 'company', '31,000', 'employees', 'Manhattan', 'headquarters', 'shots', 'teeming', 'faceless', 'humanity', 'are', 'fantastic', 'long', 'shots', 'endless', 'office', 'are', 'fabulous', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'black', 'white', 'morass', 'are', 'asked', 'get', 'know', '3', 'people', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'Fred', 'Macmurray', 'are', 'embroiled', 'love', 'triangle', 'will', 'change', 'lives.The', 'late', 'great', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'wonderful', 'C.C', 'Chuck', 'Baxter', 'Lemmon', 'was', 'dapper', '35', 'years', 'age', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'get', 'ahead', 'so', 'selling', 'loans', 'apartment', 'senior', 'executives', 'extramarital', 'assignations', 'turn', 'promise', 'move', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'humor', 'Baxter', 'trys', 'juggle', 'appointments', '4', 'different', 'execs', 'rest', 'film', 'pathos', 'it.Chuck', 'quite', 'thing', 'cute', 'elevator', 'operator', 'Fran', 'played', '26', 'year', 'old', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'innocent', 'flirtations', 'reason', 'distance', 'Maclaine', 'sweetness', 'vulnerability', 'So', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'Chuck', 'out', 'Fran', 'boyfriend', 'boyfriend', 'Director', 'Personnel', 'J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'Sheldrake', 'quite', 'married', 'slept', 'many', 'women', 'office', 'including', 'Secretary', 'Peggy', 'Olsen', 'Macmurray', 'wonderful', 'cad', 'not', 'sleazy', 'oily', 'able', 'continue', 'stringing', 'Fran', 'one', 'fateful', 'Christmas', 'Eve.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'continue', 'discussing', 'plot', 'need', 'experience', 'what', 'next', 'not', 'huge', 'leap', 'imagination', 'skill', 'actors', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'make', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'pivotal', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'scene', 'Sheldrake', 'Fran', 'will', 'get', 'visceral', 'level', 'Macmurray', 'Maclaine', 'shine', 'here', 'vulnerability', 'meeting', 'vulnerability', 'incredible', 'insensitivity', 'Brilliant', 'Lemmon', 'shines', 'discovery', 'scene', 'when', 'out', 'Fran', 'involved', 'Sheldrake', 'Sheldrake', 'had', 'borrowed', 'apartment', 'rendezvous', 'Fran', 'Fran', 'left', 'compact', 'compact', 'had', 'broken', 'mirror', 'Chuck', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'belonged', 'returned', 'Sheldrake', 'Later', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'party', 'Fran', 'loans', 'mirror', 'Chuck', 'who', 'Lemmon', 'communicated', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'face', 'voice', 'body', 'was', 'such', 'actor.This', 'movie', 'listed', 'Top', '100', 'movies', 'time', 'place', 'shelf.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

So what state was he in when he and Diamond wrote this masterpiece; not necessarily a comedy and not necessarily a drama - just like life, which is truly Wilder's greatest gift as a filmmaker.Perhaps at the top of his game when he made this, Wilder handles every scene with the deft perfection that only a handful of directors could do. I saw this film back in '98 when Curtis Hanson (of L.A. Confidental and Wonder Boys) screened a glorious print at UCLA, and Wilder's command of the widescreen image for a &quot;contained&quot; film is beyond brilliant. It's almost a shame to see this film on a TV (widescreen or not). The snappy writing and honest performances from Lemmon and McClaine easily belong as part of the hi-lites of their careers. Seeing Fred McMurray play the role of the scandalous cad is another masterstroke (remember Wilder first worked with McMurray in Double Indemnity), and the supporting work by Ray Walston rounds out a perfect-pitch picture the likes we'll never again.Astoundingly based on true life events of Hollywood during the 50s.",5,When is Wilder better than this?,988588800,"04 30, 2001",2001,1194,"['Billy', 'once', 'said', 'when', 'sad', 'meloncholic', 'comedies', 'when', 'joyous', 'exuberant', 'dramas', 'what', 'state', 'was', 'when', 'Diamond', 'wrote', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'necessarily', 'comedy', 'not', 'necessarily', 'drama', 'just', 'life', 'truly', 'Wilder', 'greatest', 'gift', 'filmmaker.Perhaps', 'top', 'game', 'when', 'made', 'Wilder', 'scene', 'deft', 'perfection', 'only', 'handful', 'directors', 'could', 'do', 'saw', 'film', 'back', ""'98"", 'when', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'L.A.', 'Confidental', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'screened', 'glorious', 'print', 'UCLA', 'Wilder', 'command', 'widescreen', 'image', 'quot', 'contained', 'quot', 'film', 'brilliant', 'almost', 'shame', 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'widescreen', 'not', 'snappy', 'writing', 'honest', 'performances', 'Lemmon', 'McClaine', 'easily', 'belong', 'part', 'hi-lites', 'careers', 'Seeing', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'play', 'role', 'scandalous', 'cad', 'masterstroke', 'remember', 'Wilder', 'first', 'worked', 'McMurray', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'supporting', 'work', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'out', 'perfect-pitch', 'picture', 'likes', ""'ll"", 'never', 'again.Astoundingly', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'events', 'Hollywood', '50s']",N/A

Understand- I liked the central characters, but didn't like what was happening to them (or the fact that they allowed it to happen over and over again). I figured out the trick to watching and really enjoying &quot;The Apartment:&quot; you need the patience of Job. The pace and order with which the events happen is so gradual (rather than slow) that it can easily frustrate the viewer who wants everything in a movie to be resolved in five minutes. If you don't have 2+ hours to really sit, watch, and be absorbed, you may not appreciate this one. At first glance, you want to ring the collective necks of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine- two characters who both seem much too smart and civil to allow the things that happen to them to keep happening. MacLaine, of course, excelled in this cheery-but-abused character in the dawn of her career, and Lemmon- who was still fairly new in 1960- was showing a kaleidescope of emotions in a character who's alternately a loner, a doormat, a kook, and something of a genius in ways of smooching the corporate bosses. Once he and MacLaine actually start their own interaction (the card games are a marvelous form of silent courtship- even in the event of squashing an attempted suicide), everything's all right with the film- and the world.

Lemmon, in a role that laid the groundwork for his future portrayal of Felix Unger in The Odd Couple, plays C.C. Baxter an accountant and tiny cog in the huge corporate wheels of a mammoth insurance company.  Lemmon discovers that his key to advancement within the corporate hierarchy involves his lending out his apartment for illicit trysts by philandering corporate executives.Insensitve Director of personnel Mr Sheldrake played by Fred MacMurray gets wind of Lemmons arrangment and takes him to task.  He is actually angling toward borrowing the apartment for a rendez-vous with attractive elevator operator Fran Kubelik played by MacLaine, with whom he has been having an affair.  Things get dicey because Lemmon has developed a crush on MacLaine and is devastated when he learns the truth.In an aborted meeting at Lemmons apartment, MacLaine depressed over MacMurrays reluctance to divorce his wife, swallows a bottle full of sleeping pills.  Lemmon discovers her and with the aid of his neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss played nicely by Jack Kruschen nurse her back to health.  Lemmon again playing the lonely sensitive do gooder, a role he handles so well, eventually wins the heart of MacLaine.The acting performances shine under Wilders direction who also manages to convey the enormity of the insurance corporation in his well conceived sets.

It gave me some perspective on the life that exists within the walls of the workplace.  In the words of the Shirley MacClaine character, ""Some people are givers, and some people are takers"".  We find both types in the workplace and in life.  How often have you known someone, maybe even us who've been used by a ""taker"".This movie tells the price you pay, when you sacrifice your morals for selfish reasons. Jack Lemmon plays a young accountant, who has found a unique way to advance his career up the corporate ladder.  He loans out his apartment in the city, for [dates] by executives in his company.  He actually receives little real help, most of them are just using their position, to shine him on, and get what they want.When one of the bigger bosses in the company finds out about the arrangement, and decides he wants exclusive rights, the young accountant must decide what is more important. The good news is:  this big boss really can help him advance his career.  Is it worth selling his morality, for higher position within the company?Of course he gets a little help making up his mind. Depressed from finding out a girl he likes is just another, ""businessman's special"", who uses his apartment. ....Like many Billy Wilder films, this movie has the power to touch our emotions.

414135,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304308388,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","The 1960 comedy/drama written and directed by Billy Wilder (""Sunset Blvd."", ""Sabrina"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""Kiss Me Stupid"") and co-written with I.A.L. Diamond (""Some Like It Hot"", ""Kiss Me, Stupid"", ""The Fortune Cookie"") was an incredible success in the box office grossing $25 million and nominated for ten Academy Awards and winning five including ""Best Picture"".  In fact, ""The Apartment"" was the last black and white to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.The film received many awards from BAFTA and the Golden Globes and is often featured in various cinema magazines in polls for ""Greatest Films"".  The film has been part of American Film Institute's top 100 polls and also was deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.But the film had its fair share of criticism.  Because of the film's nature of infidelity and adultery, where films at the time were typically promoted as wholesome entertainment, the film although regarded as a classic and received positive reviews also received its fair share of detractors because of the film's content.""The Apartment"" was released on DVD back in 2001.  followed by a Collector's Edition in 2008.  It was then released as part of ""The Billy Wilder DVD Collection"" which contains nine DVD's back in 2003 and then another Billy Wilder DVD Film Collection featuring four DVD's in 2008.  The version of ""The Apartment"" that I am reviewing is the version that came with the 2003 DVD box set and is the same release that came out in 2001.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Apartment"" is featured in 16:9 Widescreen (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  For the most part, the film looks very good on DVD.  I am told that the 2008 ""Collector's Edition"" release is much better and I can only hope that Fox releases a Blu-ray version of the film in 1080p High Definition.  But for this release, there are dust particles that can be seen throughout the film.  It's not distracting unless you are focusing on it but for the most part, the film looks very good for a film 50-years-old.As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Spanish Mono.  I know that the 2008 DVD release features both a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and stereo version of the film.  But you do get the original monaural soundtrack and for those with newer home theater receivers, can definitely enjoy this film with setting the audio to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack if needed.Subtitles are in French and Spanish.  English is only via closed caption.SPECIAL FEATURES:This version of ""The Apartment"" on DVD only comes with the original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Apartment"" is a fantastic film!""The Apartment"" is well-written, acting is fantastic and for the most part, editing and pacing is well-done.  There is nothing I can fault about the film.  At first, I felt that a romantic comedy film being over 2 hrs. long could be a bit too much but in the sake of this film, each and every minute was well-utilized.  Jack Lemmon gave a commanding performance and Shirley MacLaine was fantastic as well.  But shocking was Fred MacMurray's adulterous role as the actor who has appeared in many kindhearted, fatherly roles was playing such a character.Billy Wilder does an incredible job by working with the talent, especially with Jack Lemmon when it came to the script but also the small improvisation details, from him having a cold, gags such as shooting his nose drop across the office, making spaghetti and singing.  It's also important to note that the scene where Lemmon was hit in the film, he was hit in real life and Wilder chose to use the scene.Because of its content dealing with adultery, also suicide and the fact the film stars Fred MacMurray, I could imagine how controversial this film was back in 1960.  Especially reading how MacMurray even received an older woman hitting him with her purse when she saw him.Although a classic film, for me wanting to see ""The Apartment"" came from watching the UK film ""Brief Encounter"" directed by David Lean.  I've read that in that film which featured one of the main characters wanting to use his friend's apartment gave Billy Wilder the idea for the film but also a real life Hollywood scandal involving agent Jennings Lang and producer Walter Wanger (husband of actress Joan Bennett) in which the affair took place in an employee's apartment and a suicide attempt came from an actual incident involving a friend of writer I.A.L. Diamond.""The Apartment"" has instantly become one of my top films that I have seen in my lifetime.  A good balance of comedy but also drama that takes on topics that probably made people uneasy during that time.I definitely would recommend the 2008 Collector's Edition of ""The Apartment"" mainly because its a new transfer and the DVD contains many special features.  But it's so easy to be a fan of Billy Wilder's work that you probably will want to purchase his box sets.  If you can find the nine DVD box set for cheap (I paid $29 which is remarkably cheap for the DVD set over the Christmas holiday week), then definitely get that version.  Otherwise, there is a four DVD box set available as well and since it was released in 2008, includes the collector's edition of ""The Apartment"".""The Apartment"" is highly recommended!",5,"Featuring a wonderful performance by Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.

To them women such as Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine) are mere commodities, to be picked up and put down at will, rather like the files that adorn Baxter's office.  Despite numerous indignities, Baxter retains a basic goodness of heart, and is rewarded at the end when Fran leaves her boyfriend Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) at a New Year's Eve party and runs across town to be with Baxter.  A lot might have changed since 1960, especially in terms of gender equality, but Wilder's film still shows how 'success' often depends on prostituting one's talents, both literally and metaphorically.  The three principals are just brilliant in their roles: Lemmon's Baxter a bundle of nervous energy, contrasted with MacMurray's more laid-back acting, and Maclaine in the middle, both waif-like and knowledgeable at the same time.

414138,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,6304308388,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[5, 6]","Billy Wilder's iconoclastic style of filmmaking is at its best in the APARTMENT, a film that is almost an anti-romantic comedy that watches like a classic suspense thriller.  At times it is indeed very funny, but at the same time its tragic, melodramatic and makes you think deeply about human relationships... Its also interesting because it takes place in the generation of ""Mad Men"" and ""How To Succeed In Business"" -- reflecting some of the cynical views of the vain and sexist corporate culture that are now norms in mainstream thought, but digs a little deeper, walking a fine line.  Shirley MacLaine's character, through much of the film is sad and tragic, MacMurray plays a self centered, vile hypocritical jerk -- Lemmon is a likable, if not pitiful schlemiel type... but the screenplay balances out the story so that the any extreme's of the character's behavior fall into the story as a whole and don't steal the show making it any one actor's vehicle.  -- MacMurray's awkwardly heartless and jerky character as a result, is not a scene stealing villian, MacClaine's tragic sadness doesn't steal the film so as to make it her vehicle... nor does Lemmon's comic acting does not turn the film into a silly dainty rompy comedy although all of the cast are at the top of their form... The acting styles of the characters are all so different, yet fall into place, and this is the GENIUS of the film... that such very different characters can fit into a story with such perfect coherence.  (NOTE -- I'm being vague so as not to spoil the story.)In addition to the incredible screenplay and well utilized ensemble, the editing and cinematography are so well done, time is suspended... over 2 hours, the film unfolds more like a thriller as we truly are pulled into the world of Wilder's dysfunctional love triangles.  The (then) contemporary setting of the story leaves the modern viewer with an added breathtaking and engaging view of cool, hip, swinging  NY circa 1959 and 1960), definitely making then film even stronger watched 50 years later.As another reviewer points out; however, in many ways the film is poorly marketed.  To describe the film as a ""comedy"" is somewhat deceptive.  A tragi-comedy perhaps... but then again, even that could be argued about.  In the end, what it is is a masterpiece that simply transcends all genres and effectively tells a powerfully engaging story. To this extent, I'd have to rank it as an all time favorite and would definitely recommend buying it (not renting it) as a keeper!",5,A Film that Transcends all Genres...,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2526,"['Billy', 'Wilder', 'iconoclastic', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'APARTMENT', 'film', 'almost', 'anti-romantic', 'comedy', 'watches', 'classic', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'times', 'indeed', 'very', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'tragic', 'melodramatic', 'think', 'deeply', 'human', 'relationships', 'also', 'interesting', 'place', 'generation', 'Mad', 'Men', 'How', 'Succeed', 'Business', 'reflecting', 'cynical', 'views', 'vain', 'sexist', 'corporate', 'culture', 'are', 'now', 'norms', 'mainstream', 'thought', 'little', 'deeper', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'character', 'much', 'film', 'sad', 'tragic', 'MacMurray', 'self', 'centered', 'vile', 'hypocritical', 'jerk', 'Lemmon', 'likable', 'not', 'pitiful', 'schlemiel', 'type', 'screenplay', 'out', 'story', 'so', 'extreme', 'character', 'behavior', 'fall', 'story', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'show', 'making', 'one', 'actor', 'vehicle', 'MacMurray', 'awkwardly', 'heartless', 'jerky', 'character', 'result', 'not', 'scene', 'stealing', 'villian', 'MacClaine', 'tragic', 'sadness', ""n't"", 'steal', 'film', 'so', 'make', 'vehicle', 'Lemmon', 'comic', 'acting', 'not', 'turn', 'film', 'silly', 'dainty', 'rompy', 'comedy', 'cast', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'acting', 'styles', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'yet', 'fall', 'place', 'GENIUS', 'film', 'such', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'can', 'fit', 'story', 'such', 'perfect', 'coherence', 'NOTE', ""'m"", 'being', 'vague', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'story', 'addition', 'incredible', 'screenplay', 'well', 'utilized', 'ensemble', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'suspended', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'more', 'thriller', 'truly', 'are', 'pulled', 'world', 'Wilder', 'dysfunctional', 'love', 'triangles', 'then', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'story', 'modern', 'viewer', 'added', 'breathtaking', 'engaging', 'view', 'cool', 'hip', 'swinging', 'NY', 'circa', '1959', '1960', 'definitely', 'making', 'then', 'film', 'even', 'stronger', 'watched', '50', 'years', 'later.As', 'reviewer', 'out', 'however', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'poorly', 'marketed', 'describe', 'film', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'deceptive', 'tragi-comedy', 'perhaps', 'then', 'again', 'even', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'end', 'what', 'masterpiece', 'simply', 'genres', 'effectively', 'powerfully', 'engaging', 'story', 'extent', ""'d"", 'have', 'rank', 'time', 'favorite', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'not', 'renting', 'keeper']",N/A
414139,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304308388,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Even though filmmaker Billy Wilder has made a number of masterpieces in different genres in a long career (e.g., ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Some Like It Hot""), 1960's ""The Apartment"" still ranks as one of my favorites in his canon. The film has his trademark cynical humor (Wilder co-scripted with his longtime partner, I.A.L. Diamond), but it seems to have a deeper conscience and a more open heart than many of his other films. Even as a period piece, it is brimming with subtle observations about social mores and corporate culture in the early sixties. Very little has changed since then, which is why the movie doesn't seem as dated as others. In fact, the film seems to resonate even more today as a social commentary than the intended comedy it was supposed to be at the time. A very young and energetic Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an ambitious insurance company desk jockey looking for his rung on the ladder. Toward that end, Baxter loans his apartment to sleazy, married executives at his office in need of a place to frolic with their mistresses. His novel way of networking does yield a promotion from the head of the company, J.D. Sheldrake (initials were big as ""first"" names back then), played to smarmy, hypocritical perfection by none other than Fred MacMurray, who was then mired in wholesome Disney films and soon ""My Three Sons"". He was a last-minute replacement for the great curmudgeon of a character actor, Paul Douglas, who died suddenly before production. Wilder wisely hired MacMurray, who had not tapped into his dark side since being duped by Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity"".The complicating factor in Baxter's upward mobility is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, the office elevator girl with whom Baxter is already smitten. Since Shirley MacLaine is still quite active in movies today, it's often hard to remember what a charming, effervescent gamine she was before she starred in her own elephantine movies in the sixties. As MacLaine still is, she can be a wonderful actress, and she plays Fran effectively as a beaten victim of unwise love with a palpable depth of self-loathing. It's a lovely, unassuming performance, and the first conversation between Baxter and Fran in the elevator is quite sweet. But it is Lemmon, who dominates the picture with his affable demeanor and ironic sincerity. In anybody else's hands, Baxter would have been a put-upon schnook who deserves being punished for facilitating extramarital affairs in his apartment. Instead, Lemmon injects so much of his innate humanism into Baxter that the slow recovery of his conscience in the face of Fran's suicide attempt makes you happy with the inevitable ending.  He also gives the first indication of the fine dramatic actor he was to become in his subsequent heavier films, ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and ""Save the Tiger"". Comparatively speaking, it's a modest addition to the Wilder filmography but one that does pierce the heart unexpectedly while making you laugh.",5,Surprisingly Poignant Dramedy Done in Classic Wilder Style,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,3005,"['Even', 'filmmaker', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'made', 'number', 'masterpieces', 'different', 'genres', 'long', 'career', 'e.g.', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Hot', '1960', 'Apartment', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'canon', 'film', 'trademark', 'cynical', 'humor', 'Wilder', 'co-scripted', 'longtime', 'partner', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'have', 'deeper', 'conscience', 'more', 'open', 'heart', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Even', 'period', 'piece', 'brimming', 'subtle', 'observations', 'social', 'mores', 'corporate', 'culture', 'early', 'sixties', 'Very', 'little', 'changed', 'then', 'why', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'dated', 'others', 'fact', 'film', 'resonate', 'even', 'more', 'today', 'social', 'commentary', 'intended', 'comedy', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'very', 'young', 'energetic', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'ambitious', 'insurance', 'company', 'desk', 'jockey', 'looking', 'rung', 'ladder', 'Toward', 'end', 'Baxter', 'loans', 'apartment', 'sleazy', 'married', 'executives', 'office', 'need', 'place', 'frolic', 'mistresses', 'novel', 'way', 'networking', 'yield', 'promotion', 'head', 'company', 'J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'initials', 'were', 'big', 'first', 'names', 'back', 'then', 'played', 'smarmy', 'hypocritical', 'perfection', 'none', 'other', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'mired', 'wholesome', 'Disney', 'films', 'soon', 'Three', 'Sons', 'was', 'last-minute', 'replacement', 'great', 'curmudgeon', 'character', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'who', 'died', 'suddenly', 'production', 'Wilder', 'wisely', 'hired', 'MacMurray', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'tapped', 'dark', 'side', 'being', 'duped', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'complicating', 'factor', 'Baxter', 'upward', 'mobility', 'Sheldrake', 'mistress', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'office', 'elevator', 'girl', 'whom', 'Baxter', 'already', 'smitten', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'still', 'quite', 'active', 'movies', 'today', 'often', 'hard', 'remember', 'what', 'charming', 'effervescent', 'gamine', 'was', 'starred', 'own', 'elephantine', 'movies', 'sixties', 'MacLaine', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Fran', 'effectively', 'beaten', 'victim', 'unwise', 'love', 'palpable', 'depth', 'self-loathing', 'lovely', 'unassuming', 'performance', 'first', 'conversation', 'Baxter', 'Fran', 'elevator', 'quite', 'sweet', 'Lemmon', 'who', 'picture', 'affable', 'demeanor', 'ironic', 'sincerity', 'anybody', 'else', 'hands', 'Baxter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'put-upon', 'schnook', 'who', 'being', 'punished', 'facilitating', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'apartment', 'Instead', 'Lemmon', 'so', 'much', 'innate', 'humanism', 'Baxter', 'slow', 'recovery', 'conscience', 'face', 'Fran', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'happy', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'also', 'first', 'indication', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'was', 'become', 'subsequent', 'heavier', 'films', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Save', 'Tiger', 'Comparatively', 'speaking', 'modest', 'addition', 'Wilder', 'filmography', 'one', 'pierce', 'heart', 'unexpectedly', 'making']",N/A
414140,A2TV6SBCWT7P8S,6304308388,ehakus,"[3, 3]","This movie, directed by the legendary Billy Wilder, is one of my all-time favorites. It features a funny script, great acting, and an interesting and original plot. The Apartment is a perfect example of what is missing in Hollywood today: it is a witty, entertaining movie that relies on the script and on the acting to keep the viewer's attention and consequently does not need to use obscene language or inappropriate scenes to be amusing!Essentially, The Apartment is about a young insurance company worker (played by Jack Lemmon in an excellent performance) who is forced to allow his philandering bosses to use his apartment on dates. In exchange for allowing his bosses to use the apartment, Lemmon is recommended to recieve promotions. Things get more complicated, however, when the bigger boss, Sheldrake (played by Fred McMurray) gets involved in the apartment renting. This would seem like a good thing for Lemmon - but there is one problem: McMurray (who is married and has no plans of divorcing) is dating Lemmon's dream girl, the beautiful elevator operator at the company (played by Shirley MacLaine). To say any more would be to give too much away...In addition to having an intertaining plot and a funny, sarcastic script (like most Billy Wilder movies), The Apartment features amazing performances by all of its actors, especially Lemmon and MacLaine.So I don't know how else to recommend this movie - get it soon and enjoy!",5,&quot;Shut up and deal...&quot;,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,1441,"['movie', 'directed', 'legendary', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'funny', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'interesting', 'original', 'plot', 'Apartment', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'missing', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'script', 'acting', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'consequently', 'not', 'need', 'use', 'obscene', 'language', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'be', 'amusing', 'Essentially', 'Apartment', 'young', 'insurance', 'company', 'worker', 'played', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'excellent', 'performance', 'who', 'forced', 'allow', 'philandering', 'bosses', 'use', 'apartment', 'dates', 'exchange', 'allowing', 'bosses', 'use', 'apartment', 'Lemmon', 'recommended', 'recieve', 'promotions', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'however', 'when', 'bigger', 'boss', 'Sheldrake', 'played', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'involved', 'apartment', 'renting', 'would', 'seem', 'good', 'thing', 'Lemmon', 'one', 'problem', 'McMurray', 'who', 'married', 'plans', 'divorcing', 'dating', 'Lemmon', 'dream', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'elevator', 'operator', 'company', 'played', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'addition', 'having', 'intertaining', 'plot', 'funny', 'sarcastic', 'script', 'most', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'movies', 'Apartment', 'features', 'amazing', 'performances', 'actors', 'especially', 'Lemmon', 'MacLaine.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'recommend', 'movie', 'get', 'soon', 'enjoy']",N/A
414141,A742NFYPDU2P,6304308388,Evan E. Richards,"[1, 1]","This film was so close to being awesome and yet I didn't quite like the ending as much as I could have. What I don''t like about this film is how films are so insistent on giving us a happy ending regardless of how much reality has to be suspended. For the entire film the main character is taken advantage of, used, stood up and beaten down time and time again. And yet at the end of the movie, somehow his love interest sees the error of her ways and comes running back to him. I completely disapprove of that. If this were real life, after she had drained every drop of anything good she could possibly get from him, she would come back and steal his kidney(s) and then run off with his boss to live unhappily for the rest of her life and wonder why she is so unhappy. That is what would happen if this were real life.That being said, I did like this movie. A lot.Jack Lemmon is a likeable character named Baxter; he loans his apartment out to people in his office so that they can pursue their romantic intentions away from the prying eyes of their wives. This of course leads to complications when he loans the apartment out to the director of his company Mr. Sheldrake (Fred McMurray) and his mistress (what Baxter does not realize is that Mr. Sheldrake's mistress is in fact his own love interest Miss Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine)).The characters in this film are very real. Miss Kubelik is a woman who has been taken advantage of by Mr. Sheldrake many times before, and yet she keeps making the same mistake over and over. Mr. Sheldrake is a conniving man who cheats on his wife, has so many mistresses that he can't even keep them straight, and gives his lady friend a $100 bill for her Christmas present; yet he is the man who is the director of the company. Then there is Baxter who falls in love with a girl that stands him up and treats him, by all accounts, very poorly; yet he can't help but fall in love with her.

Still, this film is very poignant and touching and really came to life for me towards the middle and end when it addresses the cruelty inflicted on women by men who just wanna have fun with no regard to the consequences.Women are treated like chattel although you find some difficulty in finding sympathy for them when you realise that in some way, they brought it upon themselves.  If women only respected other women and played on the same team, ""men"" like those portrayed here wouldn't even have a chance to use them so easily.  If you don't want a homewrecker to come destroy your marriage just don't be one yourself!  Imagine if all women stuck to this credo...Anyways, both Lemmon and MacClaine put in very good performances here as the sympathetic man who realises just how bad his involvement in aiding and abetting his colleagues in cheating on their wives truly is after seeing the results on his victim MacClaine whom he really loves makes a selfless sacrifice of his own with regards his career to do the right thing and MacClaine as the ""victim"" who realises what true love is about.  I thought I couldn't hate Fred MacMurray any more than when he was Neff in ""Double Indemnity"" but his acting is so good here that I actually found myself hating his character even more here although it goes without saying that ""Double Indemnity"" is the far, far better film.This is a very good film except that this DVD version is very poor.  The film hasn't been restored in any way and so the picture quality is poor with imperfections galore and the sound quality in Mono is also very poor.  There are also no special features worth mentioning at all.  Here's hoping that a Blu-ray version with full high quality restoration work on both picture and sound quality is on the horizon.  Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or better options would be nice as well as a frame-by-frame picture cleanup to do justice to a deserving best film Oscar winner.Recommended but wait for a better restored version to surface.",2,Very Poignant and Touching!

However, in order to keep his desk job, he is forced to let the macho executives use his apartment for their own pleasure with their dates and marital affairs.

The Apartment is a good Holiday Season film with both Christmas and New Years scenes.  The story is Romance, Adultery, Big Business Horseplay, and Soulful Renewal.  I started watching it every New Years since it became available on videotape, then laser disc and DVD, and now, finally, on blu-ray.  Except for the sound -- the original soundtrack was never very good -- the blu-ray with good special features is well worth buying, even if you have the DVD.  In the big insurance company accountants' bullpen, the overhead lights would produce a standing-wave effect on laser disc and DVD.  The blu-ray has cured this.The only thing missing for me is a special feature discussing the camerawork within the apartment.  The camerawork is typical of the finest Panavision (2.35:1) of the period.  The simple apartment itself had everything: two fireplaces, a pull-down bed, plus a separate bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.

414170,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6304308388,K. Boullosa,"[2, 2]","If Billy Wilder had only directed Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot, and The Apartment, he would be entitled to a high seat in the Hollywood Hall of Legends.  Although very different in character and atmosphere, all three films bear Wilder's unmistakable stamp and showcase his mastery of his art. As with Some Like It Hot, Wilder's co-writer here was I.A.L. Diamond.It's hard to believe today that The Apartment was viewed as alarmingly racy becuase of its casual treatment of marital infidelity and an undeniable form of, well, executive procurement - today these issues, by themselves, wouldn't raise a yawn.  It's a tribute to the Wilder way of presenting the foibles of humanity that you watch with a grin.  Jack Lemmon plays ambitious clerk and lonely bachelor C.C. Baxter - a small cog in the big wheel of the American Insurance Company - he works on the 19th floor but wants badly to work his way up to the 27th (the ""Executive Floor"").  He's found a quick stepping-stone: the key to his apartment on West 67th St., a walk-up in one of those ancient brownstones just off Central Park West that probably looks exactly the same today as it did in 1960.  His married superiors on the 27th floor, a group of aging mid-level executives bored with their jobs, wives, and homes in the suburbs, amuse themselves by picking up girls and taking them to Baxter's little flat after work.  Baxter has quite a job keeping their schedules tidy and carving out time for himself in his own home.News of this convenient love-nest has reached the Big Cheese on the 27th floor, Jeff Sheldrake, a serial philanderer who has cut a large swath through the company's young, single employees.  Sheldrake's current amusement is pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) who has fallen hopelessly in love with Sheldrake even though she knows that he will never leave his wife, two children, and nice home in White Plains for her.  As it happens, the attractive Kubelik has caught the eye of most of the men at the company, including Baxter, although his interest in her is more than merely physical.  When Sheldrake demands the key to Baxter's apartment, in return for promoting Baxter up to his own office on the 27th floor, Baxter has no idea that it is Fran that Sheldrake will be entertaining.Until, that is, Baxter comes home on Christmas Eve to find Fran passed out in his bedroom, having taken the sleeping pills she found in Baxter's medicine cabinet after her evening with Sheldrake, during which Sheldrake made his intentions (or rather, the lack thereof) toward her clear.From then on, Baxter's ambition struggles with his better nature and his developing love for Fran, as Fran's obsession with Sheldrake begins to crumble under her growing contempt for him and her dawning realization that life just might hold something better for her, after all. Along the way, the viewer is treated to views of corporate life in the early 1960s,peopled by a host of entertaining supporting characters, by turns hilariously and viciously played by stars such as Ray Walston, David White, Jack Kruschen, and David Lewis.  Edie Adams makes the most of a small but sharply etched portrayal of Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's secretary and one of his past flings, who gets the shaft but manages to send it back to its owner in fine style before she flounces out the door in her faux-leopard hat and pointy glasses.Jack Lemmon is wonderful as the schnook who turns out to have more backbone than his contemptuous superiors supposed; Shirely MacLaine is enchanting as Fran; and Fred MacMurray makes a smooth, cold-hearted cad - his best scene is the one in which he makes it clear to Baxter that if Baxter wants to move up at American Insurance, he has to hand over that key.  MacMurray wasn't happy with the public response he got for playing Sheldrake - by 1960, Double Indemnity was well in MacMurray's past and his screen persona had moved into kinder, gentler material like ""My Three Sons"".  After The Apartment, MacMurray forsook negative roles for the rest of his acting life.The Apartment, released in 1960, offers bittersweet charm, plenty of the Wilder brand of cynicism, a witty script, a flawless cast, and a sophisticated, nostalgic score by Adolph Deutsch whose primary theme went on to be a hit for the Ferrante & Teicher orchestra.  The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The Apartment is a classic by a master, and a mark of its quality is that while the styles of dress and the look of corporate America may have have changed, the film's observations about human relationships have not dated at all.",5,"Sly & Tender, the Billy Wilder Way",1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,4631,"['Billy', 'Wilder', 'had', 'only', 'directed', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Hot', 'Apartment', 'would', 'be', 'entitled', 'high', 'seat', 'Hollywood', 'Hall', 'Legends', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'atmosphere', 'three', 'films', 'Wilder', 'unmistakable', 'stamp', 'showcase', 'mastery', 'art', 'Hot', 'Wilder', 'co-writer', 'here', 'was', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'today', 'Apartment', 'was', 'viewed', 'alarmingly', 'racy', 'becuase', 'casual', 'treatment', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'undeniable', 'form', 'well', 'executive', 'procurement', 'today', 'issues', 'would', ""n't"", 'raise', 'yawn', 'tribute', 'Wilder', 'way', 'presenting', 'foibles', 'humanity', 'watch', 'grin', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'ambitious', 'clerk', 'lonely', 'bachelor', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'small', 'cog', 'big', 'wheel', 'American', 'Insurance', 'Company', '19th', 'floor', 'badly', 'work', 'way', '27th', 'Executive', 'Floor', 'found', 'quick', 'stepping-stone', 'key', 'apartment', 'West', '67th', 'St.', 'walk-up', 'one', 'ancient', 'brownstones', 'just', 'Central', 'Park', 'West', 'probably', 'exactly', 'same', 'today', 'did', '1960', 'married', 'superiors', '27th', 'floor', 'group', 'aging', 'mid-level', 'executives', 'bored', 'jobs', 'wives', 'homes', 'suburbs', 'amuse', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'taking', 'Baxter', 'little', 'flat', 'work', 'Baxter', 'quite', 'job', 'keeping', 'schedules', 'tidy', 'carving', 'out', 'time', 'own', 'home.News', 'convenient', 'love-nest', 'reached', 'Big', 'Cheese', '27th', 'floor', 'Jeff', 'Sheldrake', 'serial', 'philanderer', 'who', 'cut', 'large', 'swath', 'company', 'young', 'single', 'employees', 'Sheldrake', 'current', 'amusement', 'pretty', 'elevator', 'girl', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'fallen', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'Sheldrake', 'even', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'nice', 'home', 'White', 'Plains', 'attractive', 'Kubelik', 'caught', 'eye', 'most', 'men', 'company', 'including', 'Baxter', 'interest', 'more', 'merely', 'physical', 'When', 'Sheldrake', 'key', 'Baxter', 'apartment', 'return', 'promoting', 'Baxter', 'up', 'own', 'office', '27th', 'floor', 'Baxter', 'idea', 'Fran', 'Sheldrake', 'will', 'be', 'entertaining.Until', 'Baxter', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'find', 'Fran', 'passed', 'out', 'bedroom', 'having', 'taken', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'found', 'Baxter', 'medicine', 'cabinet', 'evening', 'Sheldrake', 'Sheldrake', 'made', 'intentions', 'rather', 'lack', 'thereof', 'clear.From', 'then', 'Baxter', 'ambition', 'better', 'nature', 'developing', 'love', 'Fran', 'Fran', 'obsession', 'Sheldrake', 'begins', 'crumble', 'growing', 'contempt', 'dawning', 'realization', 'life', 'just', 'might', 'hold', 'something', 'better', 'way', 'viewer', 'treated', 'views', 'corporate', 'life', 'early', '1960s', 'peopled', 'host', 'entertaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'turns', 'hilariously', 'viciously', 'played', 'stars', 'such', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'David', 'White', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'David', 'Lewis', 'Edie', 'Adams', 'most', 'small', 'sharply', 'etched', 'portrayal', 'Miss', 'Olsen', 'Sheldrake', 'secretary', 'one', 'past', 'flings', 'who', 'shaft', 'send', 'back', 'owner', 'fine', 'style', 'out', 'door', 'faux-leopard', 'hat', 'pointy', 'glasses.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'wonderful', 'schnook', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'more', 'backbone', 'contemptuous', 'superiors', 'supposed', 'Shirely', 'MacLaine', 'enchanting', 'Fran', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'smooth', 'cold-hearted', 'cad', 'best', 'scene', 'one', 'clear', 'Baxter', 'Baxter', 'move', 'up', 'American', 'Insurance', 'hand', 'over', 'key', 'MacMurray', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'public', 'response', 'got', 'playing', 'Sheldrake', '1960', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'was', 'well', 'MacMurray', 'past', 'screen', 'persona', 'had', 'moved', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'material', 'Three', 'Sons', 'Apartment', 'MacMurray', 'forsook', 'negative', 'roles', 'rest', 'acting', 'life.The', 'Apartment', 'released', '1960', 'bittersweet', 'charm', 'plenty', 'Wilder', 'brand', 'cynicism', 'witty', 'script', 'flawless', 'cast', 'sophisticated', 'nostalgic', 'score', 'Adolph', 'Deutsch', 'primary', 'theme', 'went', 'be', 'hit', 'Ferrante', 'Teicher', 'orchestra', 'film', 'won', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Apartment', 'classic', 'master', 'mark', 'quality', 'styles', 'dress', 'look', 'corporate', 'America', 'may', 'have', 'have', 'changed', 'film', 'observations', 'human', 'relationships', 'have', 'not', 'dated']",N/A
414171,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6304308388,Kenji Fujishima,"[3, 4]","After enjoying the screwball hijinks of Billy Wilder's classic SOME LIKE IT HOT, I went into his Oscar-winning THE APARTMENT expecting something similar. I was delighted when I realized that this movie turned out to be perhaps an even better film than SOME LIKE IT HOT. If that 1959 film was a slice of comic heaven, THE APARTMENT aims for something a little deeper. At times, it feels less like a comedy, more like a poignant drama, and Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond are able to shift moods with consummate ease.It helps that the performances are all highly effective, and sometimes, in the case of those of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, kinda touching. This was the first role for MacLaine that really showed off her range, since her character, elevator door-woman Fran Kubelik, runs the gamut of emotions from cheeriness to self-pity. MacLaine pulls them all off handsomely, and I liked watching her throughout. As for Lemmon---well, I must say that some of his physical and speech mannerisms distracted me on occasion (esp. during one scene in which he tries to deal with his bosses by phone over scheduling conflicts regarding his apartment---his physical gestures seeming a little too overdone for my taste), but at least he gets the gist of C.C. Baxter spot-on, and we truly feel for this lonely man whose eagerness to please (and move up in the business ladder) gets him into emotional (and some physical) trouble. I don't think I've ever seen him carry a movie all by himself the way he does here, and this must surely rank as one of his best performances. (I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the performance of Jack Kruschen as Baxter's next-door neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss, who is an uncanny delight whenever he appears onscreen.)I found the premise itself delightfully imaginative. A man who rents his apartment to bosses so they can cheat on their wives with secretaries: I'd have to rack my brain to think of another movie that used such an original idea for a movie. Of course, a good premise doesn't necessarily add up to anything if the execution isn't there, and in the case of THE APARTMENT, the execution is near-flawless. Wilder and Diamond uses the premise to slyly and savagely satirize corrupt office politics---because of his willingness to give up his apartment for his bosses, Baxter shoots right up the corporate ladder in a matter of days (instead of months or years), and it is only towards the end that he realizes how sour his rise really is. As for the central relationship between Baxter and Kubelik, Wilder manages to mine more touching drama than laugh-out-loud comedy out of it---and the drama always manages to be involving and wonderfully perceptive about human nature. And the dialogue is, of course, wonderfully witty and revealing---though once again the film's final line of dialogue is the script's highpoint.All of these elements make THE APARTMENT a truly great film. Its Academy Award for Best Picture was richly deserved in 1960, and its status as one of the great American films (No. 93 on the AFI's &quot;100 Years...100 Movies&quot; list) is a testament to its lasting power as both funny, satirical comedy and touching, uncompromising human drama.",5,Maybe even better than Wilder's SOME LIKE IT HOT,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,3218,"['enjoying', 'screwball', 'hijinks', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'classic', 'SOME', 'LIKE', 'IT', 'HOT', 'went', 'Oscar-winning', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'expecting', 'something', 'similar', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'realized', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'SOME', 'IT', 'HOT', '1959', 'film', 'was', 'slice', 'comic', 'heaven', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'aims', 'something', 'little', 'deeper', 'times', 'less', 'comedy', 'more', 'poignant', 'drama', 'Wilder', 'co-screenwriter', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'are', 'able', 'shift', 'moods', 'consummate', 'ease.It', 'performances', 'are', 'highly', 'effective', 'sometimes', 'case', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'kinda', 'touching', 'was', 'first', 'role', 'MacLaine', 'really', 'showed', 'range', 'character', 'elevator', 'door-woman', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'cheeriness', 'self-pity', 'MacLaine', 'off', 'handsomely', 'liked', 'watching', 'Lemmon', '-well', 'must', 'say', 'physical', 'speech', 'mannerisms', 'distracted', 'occasion', 'esp', 'one', 'scene', 'deal', 'bosses', 'phone', 'scheduling', 'conflicts', 'regarding', 'apartment', '-his', 'physical', 'gestures', 'seeming', 'little', 'too', 'overdone', 'taste', 'least', 'gist', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'spot-on', 'truly', 'feel', 'lonely', 'man', 'eagerness', 'please', 'move', 'up', 'business', 'ladder', 'emotional', 'physical', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'carry', 'movie', 'way', 'here', 'must', 'surely', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'Baxter', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Dr.', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'uncanny', 'delight', 'whenever', 'onscreen', 'found', 'premise', 'delightfully', 'imaginative', 'man', 'who', 'apartment', 'bosses', 'can', 'cheat', 'wives', 'secretaries', ""'d"", 'have', 'rack', 'brain', 'think', 'movie', 'used', 'original', 'idea', 'movie', 'course', 'good', 'premise', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'add', 'up', 'anything', 'execution', ""n't"", 'there', 'case', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'execution', 'near-flawless', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'premise', 'slyly', 'savagely', 'satirize', 'corrupt', 'office', 'politics', '-because', 'willingness', 'give', 'up', 'apartment', 'bosses', 'Baxter', 'shoots', 'right', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'matter', 'days', 'instead', 'months', 'years', 'only', 'end', 'how', 'sour', 'rise', 'really', 'central', 'relationship', 'Baxter', 'Kubelik', 'Wilder', 'mine', 'more', 'touching', 'drama', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', '-and', 'drama', 'always', 'be', 'involving', 'wonderfully', 'perceptive', 'human', 'nature', 'dialogue', 'course', 'wonderfully', 'witty', 'revealing', '-though', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'final', 'line', 'dialogue', 'script', 'highpoint.All', 'elements', 'make', 'APARTMENT', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'richly', 'deserved', '1960', 'status', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'films', 'No', '93', 'AFI', 'quot', '100', 'Years', '100', 'Movies', 'quot', 'list', 'testament', 'lasting', 'power', 'funny', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'touching', 'uncompromising', 'human', 'drama']",N/A

I must disagree, because I feel the film, &quot;The Apartment&quot;, is his masterpiece. In fact all three principles in the making of this film (Billy Wilder, Shirley Maclaine, and Lemon himself) are at the top of their game.This is the story of a mild mannered, white collar, office worker, who is trying to get ahead at a large IBM like corporation, by loaning out the key to his apartment to various married, corporate executives, for an array of infidilties.Along the way he falls in love and must decide,what is more important,love or getting ahead at the office? This is a very touching film that mixes it's humor with pathos. It is also a bit of a time capsule, which shows us what the 1950s, button down, corporate life must have been like, before the days of feminism and casual Fridays. Also, special mention should be made of the wonderful supporting characters played by Fred MacMurray and Ray Walston.

However, Bud has found the quick way for professional success and progress as he lends out his apartment to his superiors.  The apartment functions as a love nest for his bosses as they can continue their secret love affairs unhindered .  Regularly Bud has to return late at night as his superiors are leaving his apartment after a rendezvous with a mistress.  This is wearing out Bud both emotionally and physically as he must clean up the mess and deal with the neighbors gossip.  When the head of the company wants to borrow his key to his apartment he does not only advance his career, he also discovers the woman of his life.  But it comes with a price as he must chose between his career and love.Billy Wilder is canny as he crafts this story about Bud and the escapades around his apartment.  There are two factors that Wilder uses that make the film readily available for a large audience.  First Wilder tells a story which people can relate to and second he makes it a comedy, which makes people laugh.  These two simple steps are fundamental for a successful film.  In addition, Wilder displays his remarkable storytelling skills as he creates this comedy with serious undertones similar to some of William Shakespeare's comedies and this offers depth and makes this film also a good one.

414183,A129YBX5BVNW2,6304308388,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","It's November 1959 - and sat at Desk 861 in the towering New York City Central Office of Consolidated Life (the 5th biggest insurance company in the USA) - sits lowly worker C.C. Baxter. Clifford Charles (nicknamed Bud) is up on the 19th floor every day at 08:50 a.m. precisely - monotonously tapping away on his Priden calculating machine like all the other 31,259 employees sat in long lines of square desks behind him. But Bud has a more pressing 'problem' than working out in his brain how far eight million New Yorkers will stretch if laid out side-by-side - access to his Manhattan apartment situated a short distance away from Central Park and near the office...You see Apartment 2A in 51 West 67th Street has become rumpy-pumpy central for a group of managerial types at Consolidated Life. There's Mr. Eichelberger from Mortgage and Loans booked in on Friday, Mr. Kirkeby from Accounts going at it on Thursday and Mr. Vanderhoff from Public Relations having an extra-martial swing on Wednesday. Bluntly there's barely enough room for Mr. Dobisch from Admin come the weekend - nor even space for Switchboard Sylvia partnered with the cheap but suavely dressed Mr. Lieberman on Tuesday.You wouldn't mind if they were gentlemen about it either. &#34;You mean you bring other dames up here! Certainly not! I'm a happily married man!&#34; Lieberman complains as Sylvia asks for cab fare back to the Bronx. Bud has to wait outside his apartment in the cold night air for the two lovebirds to clear off. They said they'd be out by eight - but it's already quarter before nine. &#34;These things don't run to a clock!&#34; he explains to Bud when he has to go back to get Sylvia's galoshes. It's a wonder Bud finds time for a TV dinner, a classic movie on his black and white TV that never seems to arrive because of craftily placed advert breaks (&#34;A word from our sponsors...a word from our alternate sponsors!&#34;) or to clear away the Vermouth bottles and empty Cheese Cracker packets.Worse - on hearing the noises emanating from his bachelor pad - his impressionable Jewish neighbours Dr. and Mrs. Dreyfuss think Bud's a massive playboy - &#34;Mildred! He's at it again!&#34; the Doctor cries out to his wife. So why does Bud put up with it all? Because he's really hoping that all those corporate promises made by randy execs back in the office will help him climb the promotion ladder to maybe 2nd Administrative Assistant. But when he gets locked out of 2A until 4 a.m. one night and develops a fever from sleeping on a Central Park bench - he slowly twigs that his 'loyal, resourceful and co-operative' nature as described in their internal reports is being taken advantage of (dialogue above) - and for $95 a week - it's all starting to become a bit much.The only other human joy Bud gets is from his daily close-proximity meets with the pretty Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) - a nice respectable girl who operates one of the 16 elevators in the office skyscraper. Bud takes off his hat for her (the only one who does - which she likes) - and on occasion exchanges nervous schmuck talk with her. Fran seems smart and wears a flower in the lapel of her immaculate uniform while fending off the roving hands of managers patting her buttocks as they exit on Floor 27. Then one night Bud musters up the courage to ask Fran out - but she has other plans - a date with Jeff Sheldrake from Personnel (Fred McMurray) - whom his secretary Miss Olsen (Evie Adams) knows is a notorious womanizer and is very, very good at it.And on it goes to a hopeful Christmas party, a disastrous date with two tickets for the comedy show &#34;The Music Man&#34; where she doesn't show and an unintentional personality reveal on her part with a broken vanity mirror that he recognizes to his horror. Will the hapless couple see the error of their ways - will they end up playing gin rummy together in 'their' apartment - in love and free from manipulation and takers...Much like the racy and adventurous &#34;Pillow Talk&#34; from the year previous - &#34;The Apartment&#34; was a staggeringly grown-up movie for 1960. It offered up probing dialogue, genuine wit on the battle of the sexes and awkward truths on relationships in the workplace. It also featured believable yet likeable characters - five womanizing schmucks, a gullible but worthy leading lady and one bungling but sincere klutz who learns the hard way how to be a stand-up guy.The script came to Director Billy Wilder via two places - a viewing of Britain's &#34;Brief Encounter&#34; in the Forties where a married couple use someone else's home in London for an affair - and a notorious Hollywood scandal where it transpired that the mogul charged had been using the apartment of an employee. Wilder then brought in the genius of I.A.L. Diamond to give the harsh script a warmer touch (legend has it that IAL stands for Interscholastic Algebra League which Izzy Diamond won in 1937).They began by toning down everything - the apartment isn't Central Park West lushness colourful with money - it's dowdy and filled with used records, curling art prints on the wall, a lone lamp, an old gas oven and the everyman of Jack Lemmon. Shot in Widescreen Black and White - the tones made the November evenings feel chillier and the massive long office floor look like a monochrome factory where life is not lived but wasted away on paperwork. Even the famous suicide scene where Fran (Shirley MacLaine) tries to off herself with sleeping pills sees the doctor next door (a fantastic Jack Kruschen) violently slap her face, make her walk and force cups of coffee down her throat to stop the stupor from killing her. And the four Office Managers are all ordinary-looking middle-aged men who really should know better - they're not sexy - they're just high on power and kicks. It's not pretty and quite dark in its undertones in places. So - how do you get affection and redemption out of this saucy stew?The answer is the acting talent of Lemmon and MacLaine and a multi-layered script imbibed with pathos and humour to soften the underbelly of seediness. Coming off the huge public and critical acclaim given to &#34;Some Like It Hot&#34; - Jack Lemmon showed what he could do in that classic. But &#34;The Apartment&#34; let him shine - doing comedy, romance and drama - all in the one movie. The leading actress needed to be sexy, ballsy, vulnerable and likeable enough to not be perceived as a sappy victim - and Shirley MacLaine delivered on every front. Their slow dance towards each other is beautifully and realistically handled - while Fred McMurray goes completely against nice-guy type by being a cruel man dressed up in groomed civility - doling out smiling condolences from the other end of a phone where he doesn't haven't to get his actual hands dirty.The picture quality is excellent - and on occasion - gorgeous. The Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1 Widescreen so there are bars top and bottom - but even stretched to Full Screen - it looks great. From the moment the opening credits appear - it's obvious too there's been extensive cleaning and restoration. There is however a very fine shimmer of natural grain throughout that rarely disappears. But when it does - the picture suddenly becomes exceptional - almost noir in its lighting and shades. The scene between McMurray and MacLaine in the Chinese restaurant The Rickshaw where he once again promises to leave his wife for a woman is one such moment - a side profile shot as they talk - and it's just beautiful to look at.The Extras are pleasingly deep. A discussion on the film that includes Nineties interviews with Evie Adams, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Lemmon's son Paul and film experts on Wilder and Diamond. There's also a fabulous commentary by BRUCE BLOCK for the duration of the movie where he gives real details on the actors, the sets and even quotes from Wilder's screenplay to show the accuracy of how scenes were depicted (his description of &#34;The Apartment&#34; itself is filled with exact items he wanted).  It's exemplary stuff. Audio is English 5.1 TS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Mono. Subtitles are English for the Hearing Impaired, Spanish and French.&#34;I love you...so completely...&#34; Jack Lemmon says to Shirley MacLaine. Finally contented that she's picked the right guy this time - Fran smiles wryly at Bud - and with that old confidence back in her voice once again says with affection - &#34;Shut up and deal...&#34;A

414185,A1LJZQ14T4CY1X,6304308388,Marley,"[4, 5]","Few Hollywood film-makers have been nominated for Oscars more times than Billy Wilder. In his stellar career Wilder recieved a total of twenty one nominations. He walked home with the coveted statue six times. And he's one of a very select group to have pulled off a ""hat trick"", by winning Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenwriter Oscars, all for the same film. The year was 1960 and the motion picture was The Apartment. In fact The Apartment was nomiated for ten awards and won a total of five Oscars.Much has been made of the film being dated today. Of course, the corporate workplace of 1960 seems antiquated when compared to today's automated, computerized technology. But the same holds true of hospitals, colleges & universities and even your modern supermarket. If anything, there's a quaint charm in revisiting corporate America circa 1960. But have office politics changed in almost fifty years? Just because typewriters have been replaced by desk-top computers, has human nature changed? Is the skirt chasing executive, who goes home to wife and kids in the suburbs, a different breed today than he was back then? You know the answer.Billy Wilder's greatest asset as a film-maker was his keen understanding of human nature. Wilder, the director knew the characters up on the screen inside out...Why?...Because, as co-screenwriter, along with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, he not only put the words in their mouths, but also had an innate knowledge of what made people tick. Wilder could size up situations and knew instinctively how to play them with the utmost dramatic effect. Yet he never overstates and in almost all situations he never looses his masterful comic touch.What makes this film so delightful for me is watching C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) make the transformation from ""nebbish"" to ""mensch"". For those who don't know, a nebbish is one who has no backbone. He will readily compromise his principles, in order to please those in a position of authority. A mensch, on the other hand will always stand up for what he believes in. He has deep convictions and a moral compass to boot. A mensch will never alter his sense of right and wrong. So when C.C. Baxter hands over the key to the executive wash room to the philandering, J.D. Sheldrake (Fred McMurry), he makes that miraculous transformation from nebbish to mensch.It's hard not to love this movie. It really has it all...The classic love triangle, corporate back-stabbing, near tragedy and loads and loads of Wilder's unique brand of subtle, understated humor. True, times have changed. There may not be anymore elevator operators, typists or junior executives....But a nebbish is still a nebbish and a mensch is a guy named Billy Wilder!",5,A Mensch Is A Guy Named Billy Wilder,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,2733,"['Few', 'Hollywood', 'film-makers', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'more', 'times', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'stellar', 'career', 'Wilder', 'recieved', 'total', 'twenty', 'one', 'nominations', 'walked', 'home', 'coveted', 'statue', 'six', 'times', 'one', 'very', 'select', 'group', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'hat', 'trick', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Screenwriter', 'Oscars', 'same', 'film', 'year', 'was', '1960', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'Apartment', 'fact', 'Apartment', 'was', 'nomiated', 'ten', 'awards', 'won', 'total', 'five', 'Oscars.Much', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'being', 'dated', 'today', 'course', 'corporate', 'workplace', '1960', 'antiquated', 'when', 'compared', 'today', 'automated', 'computerized', 'technology', 'same', 'true', 'hospitals', 'colleges', 'universities', 'even', 'modern', 'supermarket', 'anything', 'quaint', 'charm', 'revisiting', 'corporate', 'America', 'circa', '1960', 'have', 'office', 'politics', 'changed', 'almost', 'fifty', 'years', 'Just', 'typewriters', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'desk-top', 'computers', 'human', 'nature', 'changed', 'skirt', 'chasing', 'executive', 'who', 'home', 'wife', 'kids', 'suburbs', 'different', 'breed', 'today', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'know', 'answer.Billy', 'Wilder', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film-maker', 'was', 'keen', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'Wilder', 'director', 'knew', 'characters', 'up', 'screen', 'Why', 'co-screenwriter', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'not', 'only', 'put', 'words', 'mouths', 'also', 'had', 'innate', 'knowledge', 'what', 'made', 'people', 'tick', 'Wilder', 'could', 'size', 'up', 'situations', 'knew', 'instinctively', 'how', 'play', 'utmost', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'never', 'almost', 'situations', 'never', 'masterful', 'comic', 'touch.What', 'film', 'so', 'delightful', 'watching', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'make', 'transformation', 'nebbish', 'mensch', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'nebbish', 'one', 'who', 'backbone', 'will', 'readily', 'compromise', 'principles', 'order', 'please', 'position', 'authority', 'mensch', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'always', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'deep', 'convictions', 'moral', 'compass', 'boot', 'mensch', 'will', 'never', 'alter', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'So', 'when', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'key', 'executive', 'wash', 'room', 'philandering', 'J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'Fred', 'McMurry', 'miraculous', 'transformation', 'nebbish', 'mensch.It', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'movie', 'really', 'classic', 'love', 'triangle', 'corporate', 'back-stabbing', 'tragedy', 'loads', 'loads', 'Wilder', 'unique', 'brand', 'subtle', 'understated', 'humor', 'True', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anymore', 'elevator', 'operators', 'typists', 'junior', 'executives', 'nebbish', 'still', 'nebbish', 'mensch', 'guy', 'named', 'Billy', 'Wilder']",N/A
414186,AAW58LG72PG7I,6304308388,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[5, 8]","There is no question that THE APARTMENT was a worthy winner as best picture in 1960.  A question that does come to mind is whether it should have won as best drama rather than best comedy. More than a few viewers have asked whether it is a comedy with darkly dramatic overtones or simply the reverse. The answer is a function of how one sees it today and how audiences saw it back in 1960.  When it was released, American corporate culture was marked by dehumanized masses of workers endlessly crushed together in football-sized fields of offices.  To rise in the pecking order, one had to leapfrog over the shoulders of one's co-workers often using any means necessary.  Director Billy Wilder took this as the film's basic subtext to create a flashpoint around which America could revolve to examine whether this kind of lifestyle had any lasting endurance.  By the film's end, as Shirley MacLaine quipped ""Deal the cards,"" she indicates that this culture of death was powerful indeed, but if one were willing to abandon it in favor of seeking the company of like minded individuals, then those like her and Jack Lemmon could survive and thrive in a much smaller world of human touch and feeling.  The thrust of the film then was one of dark comedy leavened slightly by the over the top comic reactions of sexual predators who were predators more in their minds than in reality.  Today, as we view THE APARTMENT, we do not have the same cultural blinders of a deadening sense of corporate dehumanization that was then relevant.  We see the huge offices of worker drones and think no more of them than we do of similar cinematic subtexts from THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Instead we see more clearly the comic end.  We laugh at the foolish sexual excesses of Lemmon's key borrowing friends who find out too late that the women whom they take to the apartment go there with eyes wide open and see these pathetic losers as one step upward on the ladder of corporate success.  Further, we today find a strange mixture of amusement and anger in some of the film's less noted scenes. Remember when Lemmon tells MacLaine early on that he knows her address, her social security number, and other private data?  She acts bemused, but now we call that sort of knowledge gathering as perilously close to stalking.  Remember when MacMurray has his shoes shined by a black shoe shine man?  That black man was very nearly the only Afro-American in the entire film and he was a shoe shine boy.  It is quite clear that both scenes encapsulate cinematic subtexts that unconsciously mark the 60s as a given but today ring painfully clear that what passes for comedy or drama or race relations depends heavily on the mindset of the audience far more so than on that of the director or cast.  We see THE APARTMENT as a brilliant expose of corporate America, we marvel at the superb acting of the entire cast, but for the definitive analysis we must ultimately look inward to see what we bring to the cinematic table.",5,The Apartment:  Uplifting Rather than Funny,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,2988,"['question', 'APARTMENT', 'was', 'worthy', 'winner', 'best', 'picture', '1960', 'question', 'come', 'mind', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'drama', 'rather', 'best', 'comedy', 'More', 'few', 'viewers', 'have', 'asked', 'comedy', 'darkly', 'dramatic', 'overtones', 'simply', 'reverse', 'answer', 'function', 'how', 'one', 'today', 'how', 'audiences', 'saw', 'back', '1960', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'American', 'corporate', 'culture', 'was', 'marked', 'dehumanized', 'masses', 'workers', 'endlessly', 'crushed', 'together', 'football-sized', 'fields', 'offices', 'rise', 'pecking', 'order', 'one', 'had', 'leapfrog', 'shoulders', 'one', 'co-workers', 'often', 'using', 'means', 'necessary', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'took', 'film', 'basic', 'subtext', 'create', 'flashpoint', 'around', 'America', 'could', 'revolve', 'examine', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'had', 'lasting', 'endurance', 'film', 'end', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'quipped', 'Deal', 'cards', 'culture', 'death', 'was', 'powerful', 'indeed', 'one', 'were', 'willing', 'abandon', 'favor', 'seeking', 'company', 'minded', 'individuals', 'then', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'could', 'survive', 'thrive', 'much', 'smaller', 'world', 'human', 'touch', 'feeling', 'thrust', 'film', 'then', 'was', 'one', 'dark', 'comedy', 'leavened', 'slightly', 'top', 'comic', 'reactions', 'sexual', 'predators', 'who', 'were', 'predators', 'more', 'minds', 'reality', 'Today', 'view', 'APARTMENT', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'cultural', 'blinders', 'deadening', 'sense', 'corporate', 'dehumanization', 'was', 'then', 'relevant', 'see', 'huge', 'offices', 'worker', 'drones', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'similar', 'cinematic', 'subtexts', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'Instead', 'see', 'more', 'clearly', 'comic', 'end', 'laugh', 'foolish', 'sexual', 'excesses', 'Lemmon', 'key', 'borrowing', 'friends', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'too', 'late', 'women', 'whom', 'take', 'apartment', 'go', 'there', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'see', 'pathetic', 'losers', 'one', 'step', 'upward', 'ladder', 'corporate', 'success', 'Further', 'today', 'find', 'strange', 'mixture', 'amusement', 'anger', 'film', 'less', 'noted', 'scenes', 'Remember', 'when', 'Lemmon', 'MacLaine', 'early', 'address', 'social', 'security', 'number', 'other', 'private', 'data', 'bemused', 'now', 'call', 'sort', 'knowledge', 'gathering', 'perilously', 'close', 'stalking', 'Remember', 'when', 'MacMurray', 'shoes', 'shined', 'black', 'shoe', 'shine', 'man', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'nearly', 'only', 'Afro-American', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shoe', 'shine', 'boy', 'quite', 'clear', 'scenes', 'encapsulate', 'cinematic', 'subtexts', 'unconsciously', '60s', 'given', 'today', 'ring', 'painfully', 'clear', 'what', 'comedy', 'drama', 'race', 'relations', 'heavily', 'mindset', 'audience', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'director', 'cast', 'see', 'APARTMENT', 'brilliant', 'expose', 'corporate', 'America', 'marvel', 'superb', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'definitive', 'analysis', 'must', 'ultimately', 'look', 'inward', 'see', 'what', 'bring', 'cinematic', 'table']",N/A

The plot revolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethical attempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment to members from his management chain to entertain their 'women on the side'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly could even hit home in the current office environment. Although the office party and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the power and attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) is certainly symbolic.

Her whimsical charm usually goes over my head, and is interpreted more often  than not as flakiness (an unspeakable crime).  That being said, I loved  them both in this movie.Jack's shnookness works beautifully here.  He is  a loser; that is apparent.  But he is not only a loser.  He is actually  quite human.  He's a very lonely man who has an enormous romanticism about  him, but also a streak of the capitalistic swine too.  He knows what he is  doing all along (even though he protests that the situation is beyond his  control, don't believe it), and yet he is willing to get punched in the eye  over a situation that is not entirely his fault.  This is what makes him  human in my eyes: an equal mix of good and evil, where the good and evil  aren't necessarily absolutes.Shirley MacLaine's charm here is that she  is... well... charming.  The key for me in any romantic comedy (and I know that  this is more than a romantic comedy, but the term serves my purposes here)  is that I have to - along with the male lead - fall in love with the woman  too.  And I did.  Miss Kubelik is witty and adorable, and obviously quite  vulnerable.  And she is human too.  Even with all her brains and street  smarts, she still manages to get hooked by a married man.  And hurt, too.  I can easily see why a (self-proclaimed) upstanding man like Baxter would  fall in love with her, warts and all.  He so wants to be her knight in  shining army that it hurts.For a movie that contains so many dark  moments (adultery, drunkenness, an attempted suicide, and, worst of all,  insurance), it is a surprisingly uplifting movie.  What would happen if two  fundamentally flawed people, caught up in a situation that is larger and  than both of them and quite destructive, fell in love?  Could they  overcome?

414197,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,6304308388,Mr Peter G George,"[5, 6]","The Apartment is my favourite Billy Wilder film. It is a perfect marriage of drama and comedy. The story at times is quite dark and shows the sordid side of office life. The main themes of the film are infidelity and despair, but Wilder is able to inject humour into these themes so that the film becomes paradoxically warm and full of emotion. Shirley MacLaine was never better than in her role as Fran Kubelik the `elevator girl' trapped in a hopeless affair. Jack Lemmon likewise gives one of his best performances as `Bud' Baxter trying to get ahead in the office, but a man with principles also and finally a man willing to stand up and be counted. Fred MacMurray did all his best work with Wilder and is wonderfully slimy as J.D. Sheldrake the treacherous boss after only one thing. The film is helped immeasurably by a superb score by Adolph Deutsch, particularly the main theme which I find quite heartbreaking.The MGM DVD is good. It is presented in anamorphic widescreen which shows off the original Panavision print very well. I found the quality of this print to be fine. The images are clear and sharp and the print hardly shows its age at all. The sound quality on this DVD is also good with very little background noise. The dialogue is always audible and the music sounds great. Of course the film neither looks nor sounds like a film released this year, but as a presentation of a film made more than forty years ago this DVD is more than acceptable. The only extra on this DVD is a theatrical trailer which unfortunately is not presented in its correct aspect ratio.

It?s the tale of an overworked office jockey, C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) who wants so desperately to gain access to the executive suite that he starts renting out his apartment to company executives that are having affairs with their secretaries. Baxter?s shy repartee with elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) seems promising enough for an office romance of his own. That is, until Baxter learns that Fran is in love with his boss, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). However, when Fran accepts that her affair with Jeff can go nowhere because he refuses to divorce his wife, she begins to realize her night in shining armor might not come with a key to the executive washroom, but is genuine and good for her nevertheless.MGM DVD has done a below average job of remastering this DVD.

Baxter (Jack Lemmon), a young bachelor who works for a large insurance company in New York City. He enjoys a meteoric rise to a junior executive position after allowing several of his bosses to use his apartment for their clandestine love affairs with female employees of the company. The only trouble is that Baxter falls in love with one of the girls (Shirley MacLaine) who is spending time in his apartment with his boss (Fred MacMurray).Lemmon and MacLaine make a thoroughly loveable duo - two characters who capture your heart early in the film. Fred MacMurray plays the part of a hypocritical rascal, somewhat reminiscent of his role in THE CAINE MUTINY.THE APARTMENT won Academy Awards in 1960 for Best Picture, Best Director (Billy Wilder), Best Original Story and Screenplay, Best B &amp; W Art Direction and Best Editing.

Baxter, a lowly office clerk in a huge corporation who is just another faceless working bee in an endless row of desks.  When Baxter starts lending his apartment to executives in his firm so they can take their mistresses there, he finds himself moving up the corporate ladder.  Although the constant loaning of his apartment starts to be an inconvenience, he keeps doing it as makes sense business wise.  In meantime, he meets Fran, an elevator operator in his building, who is involved in affair with the big man in corporation, J.D. Sheldrake, played by Fred MacMurray.  Mr. MacMurray is outstanding  playing against type as the lascivious lowlife boss and philanderer (although is played another unscrupulous character quite well in The Caine Mutiny).  Ms. MacLaine is excellent as the morose Fran who brings the situation between Baxter, Sheldrake and herself to head when she tries to commit suicide.  Baxter must decide between his integrity and his career.  Mr. Wilder masterfully fills the film with laughs and heart and his look at corporate politics is sharp and incisive.  For his efforts, he yet again had a triple win at the Oscars, taking the 1960 Best Director, Screenwriting & Picture awards.

Baxter  (Jack Lemmon) has himself in a pickle in both a practical and moral sense.  He often can't get to his NYC apartment until late at night because he's lent it to married, upper-level personnel from work.  They want a place to take girlfriends.  Baxter doesn't seem to know how to say no to these higher-ups; besides, he's hoping his largesse will lead to a promotion. The demand for his apartment becomes a real burden on him.  And it gets worse.  In a superbly delivered twist of plot, a really big cheese, Mr Sheldrake of Personnel (on the 27th floor), asks for the apartment key--offering Baxter two Broadway tickets in exchange.  Baxter reluctantly agrees but then seeks to turn the situation in his favor by asking an attractive elevator girl out to the play. But she also happens to be the girl Sheldrake was hoping to bring to the apartment. Baxter's moral dilemma arises from these circumstances.There is great acting all around: Lemmon does one of his very best nervously funny characters; watch him make spaghetti. Shirley McClaine is sweet and vulnerable; Fred MacMurray is a real cad--with irresistible charm. The characters of Dr. and Mrs. Dreyfus (Baxter's neighbors) are funny yet wise.  Ray Walston is great too.I'm not a big Jack Lemmon fan but it's hard not to like this film; it's done so well in every respect.",5,"Mr Hopeful: ""I gotsm paper towels.""

Oh sure, today's tactical pursuit of illicit workplace liasons have adapted to the advent of pagers, cell phones, the Internet, not to mention a ginger dance around the legal land mines of sexual harrasment lawsuits, but viewing the cosmopolitan office scene of times gone by as defined by ""The Apartment"" is a worthy study in love and lust amid the corporate arena. C.C.Baxter, (Jack Lemmon) climbs the corporate ladder by making his apartment available to key personnel within his company for quickie liasons. Somewhat naive about the ways of the world, he develops a romantic attraction for the nubile elevator operator, Miss Kubelik, (Shirley MacLaine). She is however, preoccupied with the ongoing affair she is secretly involved in with the married big boss J.D.Sheldrake, (Fred MacMurray) who demands the key to Baxter's apartment from time to time in return for corporate favors. Why this wonderfully written and superbly acted film is sometimes defined as comedy escapes me. Sure this movie has many great moments of biting satire but at its heart is pathos on parade.

Sheldrake,Ray Walston as Joe Dobisch and Jack Kruschen as Dr. Dreyfuss.These oldies but goodies don't cross my desk too much anymore(the shame),but when they do I dive in for all it's worth.This""oldie but goodie"" was nominated for five OSCARS and caught two for best picture and best director.And director Wilder is in top form here throughout,as is his two main stars MacLaine and Lemmon.The story finds Lemmon working as an accounting clerk in a high rise New York City office building.Lemmon is your everyman,working  nine to five,or in this case 8:50 to 4:20.Lemmon is the go-to guy for four of his bosses who have regular on-going trysts.That is,when the bosses need some alone time with their women,Lemmon,a bachelor himself,loans out his place to whoever asks first.It is a long standing thing with Lemmon going back before he even joined the company.It is not above the pale for his temporary guests to ask for a stocked liquor cabinet and food,when needed.Lemmon has even gone so far as to cover up these trysts at his place to his fellow tenants and landlady.Lemmon makes it seem like HE is the Casanova to end all Casanova's.Now Lemmon may be a soft touch,but he has hopes his""generosity"" with his bosses will someday be rewarded.And that day eventually comes.His four bosses` recommendations get the attention of the big boss,played by Fred MacMurray.Now Fred isn't a slouch either,and he knows what is behind all those glowing recommendations by Lemmon's bosses.Just when Lemmon thinks he is in for that promotion,Fred throws Lemmon a curve.If Lemmon plays ball with him he will get that promotion.All Lemmon has to do is let Fred use his apartment from time to time.Ever faithful and discreet,Lemmon of course goes along with the big boss.As all these events have progressed we have been privy to Lemmon's crush for MacLaine who operates one of the elevators.Fred asks Lemmon for his apartment key for a particular night so he may bring his girlfriend there,in exchange he has given Lemmon two tickets for the Music Man on Brodway.Lemmon of course asks MacLaine to join him,who says she will meet him there at 8:30.The night goes on and Lemmon is still standing outside the theater as the play begins....stood up.Next day Lemmon returns a compact back to Fred telling him the mirror is cracked inside,and it wasn't his fault.Xmas eve comes and Lemmon is at work enjoying the office party.He and MacLaine are in his office and when Lemmon asks MacLaine how his new derby looks on him,she hands him her compact.When he opens it up he sees the broken mirror and realizes who Fred's girlfriend is.Lemmon is crushed,but says nothing.Later that night Fred and MacLaine are at Lemmons apartment and MacLaine is upset at some facts about Fred she heard from his secretary about the number of women he has had.Fred leaves and MacLaine stays behind,and tries to commit suicide with some sleeping pills she finds in Lemmon's bathroom cabinet.Lemmon arrives home with someone he has picked up at the bar but finds MacLaine prostrate on his bed.In short order he realizes what has happened,sends the girl from the bar packing and gets the doctor from next door.It is a close call but MacLaine comes out of it.When MacLaine finally comes to enough to know where she is and whose apartment she is in she is mortified.Lemmon,like always,tries to make it look like this all happened because of him,with his fellow tenants and landlord and contacts his boss to get him to talk with MacLaine.Two days later Fred is back at work and fires his secretary who tattled on him.And he calls in Lemmon who he promotes with an office right next door to his.Lemmon and Fred have a confrontation when Lemmon at first refuses any more use of his apartment.(He has truly fallen for MacLaine).Lemmon eventually caves when Fred makes it clear his job will be in jeopardy,but he has had enough and quits.On New Years eve Lemmon is at home packing up his things in his apartment as he plans to move,while MacLaine and Fred are out at a party.Fred`s ex secretary also tattled on his wife,and now Fred is staying at the `Y`.It is here,at midnight,that Maclaine finally comes to the realization that she is now in love with Lemmon.She rushes out and over to Lemmons apartment and the film fades as two happy people sit playing gin rummy as the new year rings in.The movie has everything you could want,great direction,editing,acting,writing and a broad range of emotions covered throughout from comedy to pathos and everything in between.Wilder starts the proceedings as if this was a comedy.Slowly but surely though we come to realize that Lemmon's loaning out of his apartment is going to have some unforeseen consequences.And eventually it does,but not quite in the way one would expect,and that's what is really fine about this film.The little almost puppy love thing between Lemmon and MacLaine is something to watch. Lemmon is giving out with all the doting,while little of it is returned in kind,as we come to find out MacLaine has someone else on the line;and of all people his own big boss.Then we see Lemmon`s heart literally crushed before our eyes when he realizes the compact belongs to MacLaine and who it is in her life.Does Lemmon become bitter at MacLaine??No,he becomes her white knight when she tries to kill herself and supports her all the way back to health,even covering up for her.MacLaine,who has complained she`s always fallen in love with the wrong men,much to our delight,finally realizes that her true love has been staring her in the face all this time.Wilder brings it all home and it leaves you with a warm feeling.Watch for Mrs.Ernie Kovacs,Edie Adams,playing MacMurray`s secretary.Funny,but when I first saw this film back in the day,I remember thinking,`God,does every executive in an office,and who are married,all have affairs like this??`.While the film certainly has that element in it,I`m a little older now(and maybe a little wiser...just a little)and realize there`s much more going on than just that.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is generally clear and crisp.This edition`s extras include two featurettes and commentary.All in all a wonderful film directed by veteran Wilder.Everyone involved is on game here.A great movie with a great cast.Highly recommended.",5,"A now classic,returns in a special edition",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,6445,"['Apartment', 'released', 'June/60', 'stars', 'others', 'Jack', 'Lemmon',

414218,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304308388,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","The Apartment (Billy Wilder, 1960)When the subject of the greatest director in American history comes up, the usual suspects come out of their holes with the usual assertions. When you look at thousand-best-movie lists and narrow them down to movies made in America, the same two names pop up over and over again: Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen. While Hitch, obviously, was British, most of his films were made in America, and so I hope I can be forgiven for calling him American when it comes to his movies. As with Hitch, then, obviously, with the German director Billy Wilder. Wilder, despite having made some of the best-loved films in American history, always seems to get overlooked when this debate comes up. I have no idea why; pretty much everything that the man did is a classic. I have yet to see the Wilder film that isn't brilliant, and The Apartment is no exception.C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a hack at an insurance agency, a bachelor who works long hours simply because he has nothing better to do. One evening, he allows a work colleague to use his apartment for a tryst with a woman who is not his wife. Word gets out, and soon Baxter's apartment is the place of choice for colleagues in the same situation. Things get a bit complicated when his boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out about the arrangement and starts using the apartment as well. Meanwhile, Baxter has struck up a friendship with attractive elevator girl Fran (Shirley MacLaine), and he hopes to take it farther. Then he finds out that his boss' girlfriend is none other than Fran. How many more ways can his job be in jeopardy?It's a nasty topic, and in 1960 it was positively scandalous. Wilder offsets the outrage of the thing by turning the material into a comedy, and a very funny one it is. When, of course, it's not playing your heartstrings. Baxter, as the film begins, is a truly pathetic individual, and Wilder and his longtime collaborator, screenwriter IAL Diamond, initially play this for all the comedic value they can. But as Baxter runs into conflict after conflict, basically forcing him to grow a spine, his character's pathos is played more and more seriously. After all, such a tenuous situation is bound to induce some serious incidents. When they occur, they never feel forced, and more impressively they never feel out of place. Everything here grows organically out of what's come before. Nothing is too convenient or too precious; it all hangs together perfectly.And then there is the acting. Wilder was a genius at taking the A-list actors of his day and managing to coax them into giving performances that were just that little bit better than they'd ever managed to come up with before. MacLaine was still, relatively, the new kid on the block, and no one really knew what to expect from her, especially when put up against such heavyweights as Lemmon and MacMurray (both of whom had teamed successfully with Wilder in the past, Lemmon the year before in Some Like it Hot and MacMurray, of course, in Double Indemnity). To say she held her own would be quite the understatement; she was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Elizabeth Taylor. (The movie did take home five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1960; it was nominated for ten.) As well, aside from the three leads was a wealth of talent in the supporting roles, including Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, and Edie Adams, among others, all of whom turn in performances as impressive as one would expect in a Billy Wilder movie.As with every Billy Wilder movie I've seen (save The Lost Weekend), I simply can't say enough good things about this movie. Want a romantic comedy with real bite? Skip whatever's playing at your local cinemaplex and rent The Apartment instead. It is a superlative example of the genre, arguably the best romantic comedy ever made in America. **** ",5,Jack Lemmon's best work.,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3839,"['Apartment', 'Billy', 'Wilder', '1960', 'When', 'subject', 'greatest', 'director', 'American', 'history', 'up', 'usual', 'come', 'holes', 'usual', 'assertions', 'When', 'look', 'thousand-best-movie', 'lists', 'narrow', 'down', 'movies', 'made', 'America', 'same', 'two', 'names', 'pop', 'up', 'over', 'again', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Hitch', 'obviously', 'was', 'British', 'most', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'America', 'so', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'calling', 'American', 'when', 'movies', 'Hitch', 'then', 'obviously', 'German', 'director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Wilder', 'having', 'made', 'best-loved', 'films', 'American', 'history', 'always', 'get', 'overlooked', 'when', 'debate', 'up', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'man', 'did', 'classic', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Wilder', 'film', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'Apartment', 'exception.C.C', 'Baxter', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'hack', 'insurance', 'agency', 'bachelor', 'who', 'long', 'hours', 'simply', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'One', 'evening', 'work', 'colleague', 'use', 'apartment', 'tryst', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'wife', 'Word', 'out', 'soon', 'Baxter', 'apartment', 'place', 'choice', 'colleagues', 'same', 'situation', 'Things', 'get', 'bit', 'complicated', 'when', 'boss', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'out', 'arrangement', 'using', 'apartment', 'as', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'Baxter', 'struck', 'up', 'friendship', 'attractive', 'elevator', 'girl', 'Fran', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'take', 'farther', 'Then', 'out', 'boss', 'girlfriend', 'none', 'other', 'Fran', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'ways', 'can', 'job', 'be', 'jeopardy', 'nasty', 'topic', '1960', 'was', 'positively', 'scandalous', 'Wilder', 'outrage', 'thing', 'turning', 'material', 'comedy', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'When', 'course', 'not', 'playing', 'heartstrings', 'Baxter', 'film', 'truly', 'pathetic', 'individual', 'Wilder', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'screenwriter', 'IAL', 'Diamond', 'initially', 'play', 'comedic', 'value', 'can', 'Baxter', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'basically', 'forcing', 'grow', 'spine', 'character', 'pathos', 'played', 'more', 'more', 'seriously', 'tenuous', 'situation', 'bound', 'induce', 'serious', 'incidents', 'When', 'occur', 'never', 'feel', 'forced', 'more', 'impressively', 'never', 'feel', 'place', 'Everything', 'here', 'organically', 'what', 'come', 'Nothing', 'too', 'convenient', 'too', 'precious', 'together', 'perfectly.And', 'then', 'acting', 'Wilder', 'was', 'genius', 'taking', 'A-list', 'actors', 'day', 'managing', 'coax', 'giving', 'performances', 'were', 'just', 'that', 'little', 'bit', 'better', ""'d"", 'ever', 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'before', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'one', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'especially', 'when', 'put', 'up', 'such', 'heavyweights', 'Lemmon', 'MacMurray', 'whom', 'had', 'teamed', 'successfully', 'Wilder', 'past', 'Lemmon', 'year', 'Hot', 'MacMurray', 'course', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'say', 'held', 'own', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'understatement', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'losing', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'movie', 'did', 'take', 'home', 'five', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', '1960', 'was', 'nominated', 'ten', 'well', 'aside', 'three', 'leads', 'was', 'wealth', 'talent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'including', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'Edie', 'Adams', 'others', 'whom', 'turn', 'performances', 'as', 'impressive', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'movie.As', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'save', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'Want', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'real', 'bite', 'Skip', 'playing', 'local', 'cinemaplex', 'rent', 'Apartment', 'instead', 'superlative', 'example', 'genre', 'arguably', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ever', 'made', 'America', '****']",N/A

Few movies have managed to blend together so many tragic, humorous, and romantic elements so completely and so well.Over the years I had managed to see THE APARTMENT five or six times.  Each time I had seen it either as a TV broadcast film or on VHS.  Therefore, I had never seen it in widescreen format.  Seeing it for the first time in its widescreen version brought the film home with greater power than ever.  What a great movie!The acting in this movie is utterly beyond reproach.  In my opinion, this was Jack Lemmon's finest role.  It is impossible to imagine anyone else playing C. C. Baxter.  Cast anyone else in that role, and you have a lesser film.  Although Fred MacMurray today is primarily remembered for his role on MY THREE SONS, he was also a highly capable villain, and he was never nastier than he was here.  Shirley MacLaine was never more adorable than as Fran Kubelik.  Unbelievably, she lost the Oscar that year to Elizabeth Taylor (for BUTTERFIELD 8.  Although no one today would compare either Taylor's performance to MacLaine's in THE APARTMENT, at the time of the voting Taylor was seriously ill and appeared to be in danger of dying.  Unfortunately, from time to time Oscars are awarded less on merit of performance, but for other reasons.  For instance, in 1940, Jimmy Stewart won the Oscar for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY primarily because voters felt bad that he hadn't won the previous year for MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.  But Stewart's winning meant that one of the greatest performances in the history of American cinema, Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, was not recognized with an Oscar.  (Far from being cutthroat competitors, Fonda and Stewart were best friends.)  In the spring of 1961, Elizabeth Taylor's health apparently was a greater factor than Shirley MacLaine's much stronger performance.Having seen this movie several times, what strikes me is how many memorable though apparently everyday moments remain vivid over time:  Jack Lemmon using a tennis racket as a spaghetti strainer; the way that Lemmon quickly rifles through cards on his desk; the game of cards that Baxter and Kubelik play in his apartment while she recovers; the toothpicks and olives arranged in a circle in a bar; the quirks and mannerisms of each of Baxter's immediate superiors; Lemmon starting to shave only to realize that he had earlier removed and hidden the blades in his razor.I don't buy many DVDs or videos, but I bought this one the second that I saw that it was available in widescreen.",5,A Very Nearly Perfect Film,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,2748,"['Most', 'people', 'consider', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'best', 'film', 'be', 'SOME', 'IT', 'HOT', 'love', 'movie', 'APARTMENT', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'favorite', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'film', 'ever', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'period', 'Few', 'movies', 'have', 'managed', 'blend', 'together', 'so', 'many', 'tragic', 'humorous', 'romantic', 'elements', 'so', 'completely', 'so', 'years', 'had', 'managed', 'see', 'APARTMENT', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'either', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'film', 'VHS', 'Therefore', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'widescreen', 'format', 'Seeing', 'first', 'time', 'widescreen', 'version', 'brought', 'film', 'home', 'greater', 'power', 'ever', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'utterly', 'reproach', 'opinion', 'was', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'finest', 'role', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'C.', 'C.', 'Baxter', 'Cast', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'have', 'lesser', 'film', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'today', 'primarily', 'remembered', 'role', 'MY', 'THREE', 'SONS', 'was', 'also', 'highly', 'capable', 'villain', 'was', 'never', 'nastier', 'was', 'here', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'adorable', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'Unbelievably', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'BUTTERFIELD', '8', 'one', 'today', 'would', 'compare', 'Taylor', 'performance', 'MacLaine', 'THE', 'APARTMENT', 'time', 'voting', 'Taylor', 'was', 'seriously', 'ill', 'appeared', 'be', 'danger', 'dying', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'time', 'Oscars', 'are', 'awarded', 'less', 'merit', 'performance', 'other', 'reasons', 'instance', '1940', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'won', 'Oscar', 'THE', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'STORY', 'primarily', 'voters', 'felt', 'bad', 'had', ""n't"", 'won', 'previous', 'year', 'MR.', 'SMITH', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WASHINGTON', 'Stewart', 'winning', 'meant', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'history', 'American', 'cinema', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'portrayal', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'THE', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'was', 'not', 'recognized', 'Oscar', 'Far', 'being', 'cutthroat', 'competitors', 'Fonda', 'Stewart', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'spring', '1961', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'health', 'apparently', 'was', 'greater', 'factor', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'much', 'stronger', 'performance.Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'what', 'strikes', 'how', 'many', 'memorable', 'apparently', 'everyday', 'moments', 'remain', 'vivid', 'time', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'using', 'tennis', 'racket', 'spaghetti', 'strainer', 'way', 'Lemmon', 'quickly', 'cards', 'desk', 'game', 'cards', 'Baxter', 'Kubelik', 'play', 'apartment', 'toothpicks', 'olives', 'arranged', 'circle', 'bar', 'quirks', 'mannerisms', 'Baxter', 'immediate', 'superiors', 'Lemmon', 'starting', 'shave', 'only', 'realize', 'had', 'earlier', 'removed', 'hidden', 'blades', 'razor.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'many', 'DVDs', 'videos', 'bought', 'one', 'second', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'widescreen']",N/A

For example, The Lost Weekend (1945), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Stalag 17 (1953), Sabrina (1954), and Love in the Afternoon (1957). I had already seen them and only years later fully appreciated their significance as well as The Apartment's in terms of Wilder's use of social satire. I am reminded of the fact that the original meaning of sarcasm is ""ripping of flesh."" Over the years, I have seen The Apartment again several times and am now convinced that -- despite its comic moments -- it offers one of Wilder's most cynical commentaries on human nature.J.D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) uses and abuses Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) to satisfy his lust; moreover, he exploits the naked ambition of C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemon) so that he (Sheldrake) and other senior-level executives can use Baxter's small apartment for their sexual dalliances. Baxter exchanges his ""cooperation"" and ""discretion"" for a series of corporate promotions. He is also attracted to Kubelik (obviously the film's most sympathetic character) and only much later realizes the nature and extent of Sheldrake's callous exploitation of her vulnerabilities. His ""deal with the devil"" upsets him only when he becomes aware of its human implications (i.e. Kubelik) and its impact on his own self-respect. Baxter's process of enlightenment is comparable with that of another character played by Lemon, Joe Clay, in Days of Wine and Roses (1962). Of special interest to me is Wilder's use of the Dr. Dreyfuss character (Jack Kruschen). He functions somewhat as a Greek chorus as the narrative progresses, sharing his opinions, but also becomes actively involved when his professional assistance is needed. I was also intrigued by MacMurray's performance in a role unlike almost all of the others he has played in films and television programs. Perhaps only a director with Wilder's talents could elicit such a performance. He received and deserved Academy Awards for direction and for co-authorship (with I.A.L. Diamond) for best original screenplay. The Apartment was selected for an Academy Award as best film, also well-deserved. Although the corporate machinations it examines may now seem dated, Wilder's guarded affirmation of human decency does not.",5,&quot;In the midnight of the soul....&quot;,1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,2442,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', '1960', 'missed', 'almost', 'darker', 'themes', 'serious', 'implications', 'then', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'had', 'written', 'directed', 'number', 'other', 'films', 'also', 'such', 'themes', 'example', 'Lost', 'Weekend', '1945', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', '1950', 'Stalag', '17', '1953', 'Sabrina', '1954', 'Love', 'Afternoon', '1957', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'only', 'years', 'later', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'significance', 'as', 'well', 'Apartment', 'terms', 'Wilder', 'use', 'social', 'satire', 'am', 'reminded', 'fact', 'original', 'meaning', 'sarcasm', 'ripping', 'flesh', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'Apartment', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'am', 'now', 'convinced', 'comic', 'moments', 'one', 'Wilder', 'most', 'cynical', 'commentaries', 'human', 'nature.J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'satisfy', 'lust', 'moreover', 'naked', 'ambition', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'so', 'Sheldrake', 'other', 'senior-level', 'executives', 'can', 'use', 'Baxter', 'small', 'apartment', 'sexual', 'dalliances', 'Baxter', 'exchanges', 'cooperation', 'discretion', 'series', 'corporate', 'promotions', 'also', 'attracted', 'Kubelik', 'obviously', 'film', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'only', 'much', 'later', 'nature', 'extent', 'Sheldrake', 'callous', 'exploitation', 'vulnerabilities', 'deal', 'devil', 'upsets', 'only', 'when', 'aware', 'human', 'implications', 'i.e', 'Kubelik', 'impact', 'own', 'self-respect', 'Baxter', 'process', 'enlightenment', 'comparable', 'character', 'played', 'Lemon', 'Joe', 'Clay', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', '1962', 'special', 'interest', 'Wilder', 'use', 'Dr.', 'Dreyfuss', 'character', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'somewhat', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'narrative', 'progresses', 'sharing', 'opinions', 'also', 'actively', 'involved', 'when', 'professional', 'assistance', 'needed', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'MacMurray', 'performance', 'role', 'almost', 'others', 'played', 'films', 'television', 'programs', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'director', 'Wilder', 'talents', 'could', 'elicit', 'such', 'performance', 'received', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'direction', 'co-authorship', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Apartment', 'was', 'selected', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'film', 'also', 'well-deserved', 'corporate', 'machinations', 'may', 'now', 'seem', 'dated', 'Wilder', 'guarded', 'affirmation', 'human', 'decency', 'not']",N/A

Because of this, I neglected to watch &quot;The Apartment&quot; for years.  All I can say  about that now is, &quot;Pardon me, Shirl, my mistake.&quot;  This movie is  a Wilder masterpiece and an absolute delight.  One of the best things about  it is that it shouldn't be funny; nearly everyone in it is a lying,  abusive, double-crossing lecher with a heart of solid tin.  There's  adultery, alcoholism, and a suicide attempt, too.  None of this would be  remotely funny in lesser hands than Wilder's, let alone heart-warming, but  the director manages this impossible feat handily.  It helps that the  central character, C.C. Baxter, is brought to life by Jack Lemmon; Lemmon's  performance is one of the rare times in film you forget you're watching a  star and genuinely believe in the character.  Fred McMurray plays against  type- amazingly well- as the slimy boss C.C. Baxter must please.  Shirley  MacLaine is, for once, the heartbreaking gamine she's cracked up to be.  The supporting cast is terrific- Jack Kruschen is great as C.C. Baxter's  next-door neighbor, a doctor.  Joan Shawlee is her usual howlingly funny  self as a floozy telephone operator, and Edie Adams gives herself over  completely to an unsparing portrait of a scheming secretary.  For my money,  the best bit in the film is when C.C. Baxter, who has a cold, has been  summoned to the boss' office for a talk that takes a VERY surprising turn.  The sniffling, sneezing Baxter forgets he's holding his nose spray, and  reflexively squeezes a six-foot stream of the stuff across the office.  The  film is richly detailled, with sets that blend seamlessly with the real New  York City locations used.  I spotted one inside joke in the movie- C.C.  Baxter gets his first real promotion and, therefore, his first real office  at the company.  Of course, Baxter's name is on his door; the door of the  next office says that T.W. Plews is the occupant.  The name is actually  that of Tom &quot;Limey&quot; Plews, prop master for this movie and  hundreds more.  This is one of the greats, and I can guarantee you won't be  disappointed.  There is one glitch in the video transfer you should know  about; the original theatrical trailer is included on it, and the print of  the trailer is absolutely terrible.

In this Oscar-winning offbeat tale we find out that stepping up isn't so much fun when it's someone you care about that you're stepping on.In the apartment, the late Jack Lemmon plays C.C.Baxter, a guy trying to move up at his job. His trick is that he lets his managers use his Manhattan apartment to entertain their mistresses. He's the man to go to; a lot of executives want to use his place to. Even though Baxter would like to get some sleep, things are going smoothly so smoothly that he decided to make a copy of the key to his apartment so J.D. Sheldrake the director of HR can have exclusive use of his apartment. On the same day, C.C. tries to make a move on Fran Kublelick, an elevator operator. The same woman J.D Sheldrake the Director of Human Resources. is cheating with. C.C. enjoys his big promotion on the day of the Christmas party. However, on the night of the party he finds out how hollow his victory is when Fran tries to take her life because Sheldrake dumped her in his apartment. Realizing what he did to someone he cared about, C.C. Baxter really has to think about his arrangement over the course of a long weekend. I won't give away any more, the movie is too good to spoil. You have to see it for yourself.The late Billy Wilder knows how to write a story, even though the movie is almost 45 years old, the comments he makes about business and ethics are still relevant to 2005. Anyone coming out of college and going into the workworld needs to see this movie at least twice.The late Jack Lemmon is great here as C.C the employee struggling with his ethics and identity in the working world. He's one of the all time great actors; Every time I watch one of his movies I see a character telling a story and not him. It's a pleasure to watch him act. Shirley Maclaine gives one of her best performances here as Fran Kubelick. I really felt sorry for the character of Fran Kubelick because Maclaine made her so real. The late Fred McMurray and Ray Walston (the dad on My Three Sons and My Favorite Martian for you people who remember that far back) are amazing in this movie playing the exact polar opposites of the nice characters they play on TV. These two especially McMurray are so unethical you can feel the smarminess coming off them.The Apartment is an all around great movie and a Shawn James Five Star essential Video.

414231,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,6304308388,Stephen Reginald,"[74, 83]","The Apartment is an insightful movie made by one of cinema's most talented directors.  The plot is fairly simple, but C.C. Baxter's (Jack Lemmon) is anything but.  By innocently lending out his apartment to a coworker, Baxter's residence becomes the love nest for his philandering colleagues.  Along the way, Baxter develops a friendship with Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine), one of several attractive female elevator operators.  Baxter is rewarded for his generosity by getting promoted by Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).  Little does he realize that Fran is Sheldrake's latest plaything.  The Apartment has all that you expect from the best of Wilder:  great performances, witty dialogue, and a plot that holds to this day, even if most of the depiction of the corporate office environment has changed dramatically (When was the last time you saw an elevator operator?).  The three stars provide great characterizations, with MacMurray the real surprise here playing against type.  This film is also notable for solidifying the Wilder/Lemmon team.  With The Apartment, Lemmon was no longer playing second male leads or supporting roles.  A worthwhile film that is still enjoyable today, but the DVD version leaves much to be desired.

414234,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,6304308388,Thomas Glebe,"[1, 2]","I have seen many great films during my days on this planet, by many great directors, writers, and/or producers.  And I really can't remember when I first saw this 1960 ""best picture"" winner, since I was only five or six years old when it first came out.  But over time, upon repeated viewings, I've come back to it with so much enjoyment and a warm feeling that this was (and is), truly one of my top ten Hollywood movies of all time.  My ""top ten"" includes many great films (Close Encounters, the original Apocalypse Now, Titanic, 2001, Wizard of Oz, et al present day), but this will, I think, always remain very special.  It's just so good.  And all of it still rings true today.  ""The Apartment"" offered and still does, a view of corporate America and the eventual evil of ""greed"" versus the good of self-integrity and love, boiled down to a few individuals, with both essential romantic and comedic aspects powerfully intact.  In other words, this movie is still as timely and great today as it ever was.Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray turn in absolutely wonderful performances as the three main characters in this very believable, ""love triangle,"" but this movie is just full of great efforts by so many others including Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, Naomi Stevens, and Edie Adams.  And legendary Billy Wilder, one of the greatest filmmakers ever, contributes here, writing and directing, cookie-wise, a second to none effort throughout.  In retrospect, it's no wonder this film won best picture in its day, and I have loved it for several decades now, and always will.  It's one of those movies that if you first see it and like it and understand it early on, upon further screenings, will only engender even more appreciation and love for it.  This works from moment one to the classic final scene, as BOTH a comedy and a drama, and even as a seasonal Christmas/New Year's movie in some ways, and mixes all within a film without any serious or even minor flaws.Personally, I have been, can, and guess will always be able to identify with Jack Lemmon's character  (""Bud or Buddy-Boy""), from beginning to end, which is that of the basic corporate/personal ""nice guy"" who has always struggled to only finish near the bottom, company-wise, and girl-wise, because of basic morals and ethics concerning both.  Spoilers aside, this is really a movie with one of the most satisfying, albeit brief ""happy endings"" where the nice guy actually finishes gloriously first eventually, at least with the girl.  Because while he does not get the higher pay scale corporate position he wants, he does eventually get what he REALLY wants, which of course is, the girl.  And what else really matters?  While lots of other cinematic efforts have tried to do what this movie does, none have ever really come close, and maybe none ever will.Jack Lemmon has always been and will always remain, one of my favorite actors.  Around this time, he had already proven himself as a great actor with earlier Wilder and other comedic/dramatic efforts, especially with his genius performance in virtually the same year, in the brilliant ""Days of Wine and Roses.""  Here he plays C.C. Baxter (corporate ladder-climbing, good-hearted nerd/stooge) in a lighter semi-dramatic/comedic role, in a film which still triumphs from start to finish within its central written cores and still resonates, to this day. with eternal, relevant characters and never-ending, compelling filmic themes.With a wonderful musical score by Adolph Deutsch (along with various other melodies scattered about, music-wise), this is, in my opinion, a virtually ""perfect movie.""  In an early off-screen narrative at the beginning, written nearly half a century ago, our hero (Lemmon) states, ""On November 1st, 1959, the population of New York City was 8,042,783.  If you laid all these people end to end, figuring an average height of five feet six and a half inches, they would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan. I know facts like this because I work for an insurance company - Consolidated Life of New York.  We're one of the top five companies in the country. Our home office has 31,259 employees, which is more than the entire population of uhh... Natchez, Mississippi. I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861...""In the beginning, while more or less satisfied with his lot in life, C.C. Baxter had problems.  One, his seemingly but not really comfy, average Manhattan west Central Park APARTMENT (circa-1960, which nobody but the ultra-rich could afford these days), and two, how he had rented the same off and on to a bunch of higher-up corporate co-workers of dubious moral fiber to fool around in, all in hopes of climbing the corporate ladder.  When ""Fran"" (Shirley MacLaine, in her most adorable role ever, imho), the girl/woman he personally loves and wants, somehow, strangely enters the situation, it complicates everything.  Because, ""Mister Sheldrake"" (Fred MacMurray as the main bad guy), who Fran seems to be having had a long-time affair with, is the very big ""boss"" which Baxter has to impress, corporate-wise.  This whole triangle arrangement begins to fall through however, early on, within, and throughout the movie, where ""business"" morals eventually clash with our hero's personal feelings and his real life, outside ""the office and the desire to get ahead in the business world.""I really can't say that any other film I've ever seen deals so right-on with the undefined lines and eventual conflicts oftentimes inherent within conflicting corporate and real-life environments as far as business and personal romance/love possibilities go except perhaps for ""Wall Street"" by Oliver Stone (another of my favorite movies, but not a top ten).  ""The Apartment,"" released more than two and a half decades earlier, still packs a more powerful punch however, and probably always will, along the same general lines, and every shot, every scene, every line, every individual actor's performance, every situation, is a winner, with no filler.  This is Billy Wilder at his best, and `nuff said...",5,One of my top ten films of all time...,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,6164,"['have', 'seen', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'days', 'planet', 'many',

414235,A4JHEO7H330AF,6304308388,Tom Brody,"[5, 7]","THE APARTMENT stars Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray.  THE APARTMENT also includes Edie Adams, who played the part of the devil in DAMNED YANKEES.THE APARTMENT concerns a love triangle between an older top executive (Fred MacMurray), a twenty-something elevator operator, and a young and intelligent accountant (Jack Lemmon).FRED MACMURRAY.  Fred MacMurray is a married man with a couple of young sons, but his interests have gone seriously wayward, and he has been spending several months courting the elevator girl.  Fred MacMurray's acting in many of his movies, in my opinion, is somewhat wooden and he seems to be a robot, where somebody else is putting words into his mouth.  But in THE APARTMENT, Mr.MacMurray's acting is more genuine.  Throughout the story, he plays a sleazy dilly-dallier.  The narrative is made especially spicey by the snooping and gossiping of Mr.MacMurray's executive secretary, who eavesdrops on Mr.MacMurray's telephone calls.JACK LEMMON.  Mr.Lemmon plays a highly articulate batchelor, with the mannerism of making quick gestures.  These rapid gestures make him appear more intelligent.  He lives along in his ""batchelor pad"" and he dabbles in Italian cooking.  Mr.Lemmon also operates a tryst-house.  For reasons not explained in this story, Mr.Lemmon schedules trysts involving various male employees from his company, and their girlfriends.  During these trysts, Mr.Lemmon strolls about the neighborhood, often late at night, and lurks out of sight to the side of the stairsteps of his apartment building.  During the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Mr.Lemmon's behavior in supplying a tryst-house to his colleagues at work (including to Fred MacMurray), plays a major part in his advancement up the corporate food chain.  The fact that the Jack Lemmon operates a tryst-house seems highly unlikely, but it does make for a very interesting story, and it constitutes only a slight exaggeration from what sometimes happens in real life.SHIRLEY MACLAINE.  Shirley MacLaine plays a twenty-something elevator girl who is pretty, but not particularly skilled in anything.  About half-way through the movie, we learn that she is not good at spelling words.  And we also learn that she is not skilled at choosing boyfriends.  For example, in addition to falling for the Fred MacMurray character (a married man), one of her boyfriends was sent to prison for corporate fraud.  It is not really clear what makes Ms.MacLaine attractive to men, but THE APARTMENT is a dramatic piece, and there is no requirement in dramas that everything is made logical.SHAKESPEARIAN TWISTS.  Various things make this movie interesting.  First of all, many viewers of THE APARTMENT are likely familiar with Fred MacMurray's roles in children's Disney movies, such as ABSENT MINDED PROFESSOR and SHAGGY DOG.  What is intriguing is watching him play a contrasting role, namely, a corporate sleaze.The film invites repeated viewings, because it contains many little clever nuances.  For example, the first time that Mr.Lemmon meets with Fred MacMurray, Mr.Lemmon has a bad cold and is administering a squirting nose solution to his nostrils.  But at the same moment that Fred MacMurray proclaims, ""We don't want any leaks about this situation,"" Mr.Lemmon's squirt solution accidently leaks and sends a jet of nose solution through the air.Another very clever nuance occurs near the end of the story.  In Fred MacMurray's office, a black shoeshine man is busy shining Mr.MacMurray's shoes.  When the shine is done, Mr.MacMurray tosses a shiney coin to the shoeshine man.  The act of payment by way of tossing a coin symbolizes the fact that Mr.MacMurray, a white executive, is superior to a mere shoe-shine man.  Ordinarily, this would appear to be a reflection of the occasional overt racism that is depicted in movies before the 1960s.  But wait.  There was a distinct reason for the shoeshine episode.  What happens a minute later is that Jack Lemmon tosses a shiney key into Fred MacMurray's hands.  This act symbolizes the fact that Jack Lemmon is morally superior to Fred MacMurray.  In the case of the coin, the shoeshine man is kneeling on the floor, and is physically located below Fred MacMurray.  In the case of the key, Mr.MacMurray is sitting in a chair, and is physically located below Jack Lemmon, who is standing.  The symbolism of the coin-tossing/key-tossing scene could not be more clear.  It was an act of script-writing genius.What also makes the movie intersting are the many Shakespearian twists and misunderstandings.  For example, Mr.Lemmon's neighbors have been rightly convinced that it is Mr.Lemmon himself who has many girlfriends (when in fact, it is his colleagues at work who are visiting at night with their girlfriends).  Another interesting twist concerns flip-flops in keys, that is, the key to Mr.Lemmon's apartment and the key to the corporate washroom.  Throughout the entire movie, the viewer is faced with the ambiguity of whether Shirley MacLaine is going to stay with Mr.Lemmon, or whether she is going to stay with Fred MacMurray.The intrigue and twists continue until the very last minute of THE APARTMENT.  Just to note one of the many clever features of the movie, is Mr.Lemmon's use of a tennis racket as a spaghetti strainer.  The spaghetti strainer scene is a little work of art. By the way, ther are no swear words in the entire movie, and there are no steamy scenes.  Therefore, this is an excellent movie for children.  The story provides an honest slice-of-life picture of humanity and, in my opinion, could be used to supplement Sunday school teachings in morality.

414237,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304308388,trebe,"[2, 3]","After working with Jack Lemon in the highly successful Some Like It Hot (1959), writer/director Billy Wilder and writer I.A.L. Diamond were anxious to work with Lemon on another project.  The result was The Apartment (1960), co-written by Wilder and Diamond, and directed and produced by Wilder.  The film was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and won best picture with Wilder winning best director, and Wilder and Diamond winning for best screenplay.  In addition, Jack Lemon and co-star Shirley MacLaine were nominated for best actor and actress respectively, but each did not win.The Apartment, may have caught the fancy of audiences at the time, because of the rather risqu&eacute; theme involving an apartment that is used as a ""love nest"", by employees of an insurance company.  Back then, when living together, premarital sex, and divorce, were generally frowned upon, this concept was somewhat racy.  While the film has some wonderful performances, and still has great charm and warmth, some of its impact has probably been lost due to the evolution of morals.Jack Lemon plays Bud Baxter a low level clerk in an insurance company, who through a series of circumstances, finds his apartment being used as a rendezvous for some of his superiors in the company, who take turns using his pad to entertain their dates for the evening.His neighbors mistakenly believe that he is a playboy, but Baxter actually has no love life, although he is attracted to Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), an elevator operator in his building.  Baxter is called in to see Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), a top executive in the company, who it turns out would also like to use the apartment for some hanky panky, in return for future favors.The relationship then becomes a triangle, as Ms. Kubelik is Sheldrake's mistress (the latest of many).  While alone at Baxter's apartment, a despondent Fran swallows some sleeping pills.  Fortunately, Baxter arrives in time to save her life, calling his neighbor (Jack Kruschen) who is a doctor.  Baxter hides his feelings, while trying to be a both a friend to Fran, and loyal to Sheldrake.  Sheldrake's past comes back to bite him, but just when it appears that he may have won Fran back, he's left to celebrate the new year alone.The screenplay is well written, with few wasted scenes.  Tailored to Jack Lemon's shaky and slightly neurotic acting style, playing the trampled on and conflicted Bud Baxter, is a predictably nice fit.  Lemon and Shirley MacLaine work very well together, and have some great dialog, in an understated MacLaine performance.  Fred MacMurray (My Three Sons) is also excellent, playing a man with a long history of using people.Very much of its time, The Apartment has the quaint charm and innocence from an era that has long since faded into the past.  Those seeing it for the first time now, might even wonder why it was selected as Best Picture, some fifty years ago.  While some films easily translate through the years, with the vast changes in personal morality, The Apartment may not be one of them.  Time may have put some tarnish on its luster, but it's clear even today why The Apartment has retained its appeal.",4,an interesting variation of corporate politics...,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,3174,"['working', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'highly', 'successful', 'Hot', '1959', 'writer/director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'writer', 'I.A.L', 'Diamond', 'were', 'anxious', 'work', 'Lemon', 'project', 'result', 'was', 'Apartment', '1960', 'co-written', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'directed', 'produced', 'Wilder', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'multiple', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'Wilder', 'winning', 'best', 'director', 'Wilder', 'Diamond', 'winning', 'best', 'screenplay', 'addition', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'co-star', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'were', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'actress', 'respectively', 'did', 'not', 'win.The', 'Apartment', 'may', 'have', 'caught', 'fancy', 'audiences', 'time', 'rather', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'theme', 'involving', 'apartment', 'used', 'love', 'nest', 'employees', 'insurance', 'company', 'Back', 'then', 'when', 'living', 'together', 'premarital', 'sex', 'divorce', 'were', 'generally', 'frowned', 'concept', 'was', 'somewhat', 'racy', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'still', 'great', 'charm', 'warmth', 'impact', 'probably', 'been', 'lost', 'due', 'evolution', 'morals.Jack', 'Lemon', 'Bud', 'Baxter', 'low', 'level', 'clerk', 'insurance', 'company', 'who', 'series', 'circumstances', 'apartment', 'being', 'used', 'rendezvous', 'superiors', 'company', 'who', 'take', 'turns', 'using', 'pad', 'entertain', 'dates', 'evening.His', 'neighbors', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'playboy', 'Baxter', 'actually', 'love', 'life', 'attracted', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'MacLaine', 'elevator', 'operator', 'building', 'Baxter', 'called', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Sheldrake', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'top', 'executive', 'company', 'who', 'out', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'use', 'apartment', 'hanky', 'panky', 'return', 'future', 'favors.The', 'relationship', 'then', 'triangle', 'Ms.', 'Kubelik', 'Sheldrake', 'mistress', 'latest', 'many', 'alone', 'Baxter', 'apartment', 'despondent', 'Fran', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'Fortunately', 'Baxter', 'time', 'save', 'life', 'calling', 'neighbor', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'who', 'doctor', 'Baxter', 'feelings', 'trying', 'be', 'friend', 'Fran', 'loyal', 'Sheldrake', 'Sheldrake', 'past', 'back', 'bite', 'just', 'when', 'may', 'have', 'won', 'Fran', 'back', 'left', 'celebrate', 'new', 'year', 'alone.The', 'screenplay', 'well', 'written', 'few', 'wasted', 'scenes', 'Tailored', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'shaky', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'acting', 'style', 'playing', 'trampled', 'conflicted', 'Bud', 'Baxter', 'predictably', 'nice', 'fit', 'Lemon', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'have', 'great', 'dialog', 'understated', 'MacLaine', 'performance', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'My', 'Three', 'Sons', 'also', 'excellent', 'playing', 'man', 'long', 'history', 'using', 'people.Very', 'much', 'time', 'Apartment', 'quaint', 'charm', 'innocence', 'era', 'long', 'faded', 'past', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'now', 'might', 'even', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'selected', 'Best', 'Picture', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'films', 'easily', 'translate', 'years', 'vast', 'changes', 'personal', 'morality', 'Apartment', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'Time', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'tarnish', 'luster', 'clear', 'even', 'today', 'why', 'Apartment', 'retained', 'appeal']",N/A

No doubt, over the passing days, weeks, months and years, there will be some discussion about him and of his work. There will also be biographies, documentaries and other tributes to him. I believe, however, that he should be left to rest in peace and that the only true monument to him is in the great movies he left to us. One of these is 1960's ""The Apartment"". Some might disagree with this film's Best Picture win (Considering that it was the same year as ""Psycho"", ""Elmer Gantry"" and ""Spartacus""), but it's a great movie nonetheless.Jack Lemmon, In a memorable role, portrays C.C Baxter, an insurance man for Consolidated Insurance in New York. Baxter has a secret: He has been lending the key to his apartment to various executives so they could have extra-martial affairs. In exchange, Baxter's career advances so far that by the movie's end, he is the boss's executive. Shirley MacLaine is elevator girl Fran Kubelik, who has had a romance with Baxter's boss. Even though the boss is a real weasel (More on him and the actor in the next paragraph), Kubelik thinks she still loves him at the end. However, she doesn't realize that she actually has fallen for Baxter.Fred MacMurray will probably be most remembered for his role on ""My Three Sons"". His early film career also involved largely comedic roles. Ironically, his most memorable film roles, like ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Caine Mutiny"", had him adapt to villainous roles, which he did real well. Here, he portrays J.D Sheldrake, the personal manger at the Insurance company. He is a real liar, using people to get to the top (Where he is at) and having flings with others at the building. With his looks and smile, however, you would think that he could have easily played a good guy. Shows just how good of an actor he was (Or was the part just a good fit?). Unfortunately, he joined the ranks of actors who never won Oscars.Wilder's films had a common theme of people willing to do anything for happiness, even if it means breaking the law. Here, the story is about someone willing to give up his bachelor flat for a higher position at his job. In expense, he loses the trust of those around him. The main character here, like Walter Neff in ""Double Indemnity"" also have a similar flaw: They don't know what to do until it's too late and they never take a stand on something. Wilder's films also had great endings, often with dialogue. The final line in this film (""Shut up and deal!"") has become nearly as famous as 'Nobody's Perfect'. Now that's movie making!References to previous Wilder films made in this one:Mr. Dobisch (Ray Walston), one of the executives, remarks that he picked up a girl that looked like Marilyn Monroe, who was in ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Some Like It Hot"". During the filming of those movies, Wilder had grown to despise Monroe's demands for star treatment and her poor work ethic. Thus, he also included the party-girl Monroe-esque character in this film.Another of the executives, Mr. Kirkeby (David Lewis), saw Baxter with Kubelik at his apartment and remarks that they had a ""Lost Weekend"", a possible reference to the 1945 film that won Wilder Best Director and Best Picture academy awards.The character name Sheldrake was also used in Sunset Blvd. (1950).",5,"""Be a mensch!""",1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,3348,"['March', '27', '2002', 'world', 'sadly', 'learned', 'filmmaker', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'passed', 'away', 'doubt', 'passing', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'discussion', 'work', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'biographies', 'documentaries', 'other', 'tributes', 'believe', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'rest', 'peace', 'only', 'true', 'monument', 'great', 'movies', 'left', 'One', '1960', 'Apartment', 'might', 'disagree', 'film', 'Best', 'Picture', 'win', 'Considering', 'was', 'same', 'year', 'Psycho', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Spartacus', 'great', 'movie', 'nonetheless.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'memorable', 'role', 'C.C', 'Baxter', 'insurance', 'man', 'Consolidated', 'Insurance', 'New', 'York', 'Baxter', 'secret', 'been', 'lending', 'key', 'apartment', 'various', 'executives', 'could', 'have', 'extra-martial', 'affairs', 'exchange', 'Baxter', 'career', 'advances', 'so', 'far', 'movie', 'end', 'boss', 'executive', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'elevator', 'girl', 'Fran', 'Kubelik', 'who', 'had', 'romance', 'Baxter', 'boss', 'Even', 'boss', 'real', 'weasel', 'More', 'actor', 'next', 'paragraph', 'Kubelik', 'still', 'end', 'However', ""n't"", 'realize', 'actually', 'fallen', 'Baxter.Fred', 'MacMurray', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'remembered', 'role', 'Three', 'Sons', 'early', 'film', 'career', 'also', 'involved', 'largely', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Ironically', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'roles', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'had', 'adapt', 'villainous', 'roles', 'did', 'real', 'well', 'Here', 'J.D', 'Sheldrake', 'personal', 'manger', 'Insurance', 'company', 'real', 'liar', 'using', 'people', 'get', 'top', 'Where', 'having', 'flings', 'others', 'building', 'looks', 'smile', 'however', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'played', 'good', 'guy', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'was', 'part', 'just', 'good', 'fit', 'Unfortunately', 'joined', 'ranks', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'won', 'Oscars.Wilder', 'films', 'had', 'common', 'theme', 'people', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'happiness', 'even', 'breaking', 'law', 'Here', 'story', 'someone', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'bachelor', 'flat', 'higher', 'position', 'job', 'expense', 'trust', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'Walter', 'Neff', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'also', 'have', 'similar', 'flaw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'too', 'late', 'never', 'take', 'stand', 'something', 'Wilder', 'films', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'endings', 'often', 'dialogue', 'final', 'line', 'film', 'Shut', 'up', 'deal', 'become', 'nearly', 'as', 'famous', ""'Nobody"", 'Perfect', 'Now', 'movie', 'making', 'References', 'previous', 'Wilder', 'films', 'made', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Dobisch', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'one', 'executives', 'remarks', 'picked', 'up', 'girl', 'looked', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'who', 'was', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'Hot', 'filming', 'movies', 'Wilder', 'had', 'grown', 'despise', 'Monroe', 'demands', 'star', 'treatment', 'poor', 'work', 'ethic', 'Thus', 'also', 'included', 'party-girl', 'Monroe-esque', 'character', 'film.Another', 'executives', 'Mr.', 'Kirkeby', 'David', 'Lewis', 'saw', 'Baxter', 'Kubelik', 'apartment', 'remarks', 'had', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'possible', 'reference', '1945', 'film', 'won', 'Wilder', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Picture', 'awards.The', 'character', 'name', 'Sheldrake', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'Sunset', 'Blvd', '1950']",N/A

Though working in a variety of genres, including war (""Five Graves to Cairo""), romantic comedy (""Sabrina""), melodrama (""Witness for the Prosecution""), drama (""The Lost Weekend""), farce (""Some Like It Hot""), biography (""The Spirit of St. Louis""), and film noir (""Double Indemnity"" -- arguably the ur-bach of that genre), he's best remembered for his cynical, nearly black, view of humanity.In films such as ""Ace in the Hole"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Stalag 17"", ""Kiss Me, Stupid"", and ""Sunset Blvd."", he paints a bleak picture of human beings and human ""values"". People are shallow, self-centered, and (most of all) greedy. As the tag line for ""The Fortune Cookie"" goes...  ""There are two kinds of people -- those who'll do anything for money, and those who'll do /almost/ anything.""As a life-long cynic, I've always most-enjoyed Wilder's ""black"" side, especially its implicit condemnation of American society, one of the most shallow and materialistic in history. Wilder left Europe to escape the Nazis, and luckily for us, found a gold mine of material for social criticism and satire in America. Unfortunately for both Wilder and his fans, ""The Apartment"" was the last of his ""good"" films, as he slid into sentimentality (""The Fortune Cookie"" being particularly obnoxious).As for ""The Apartment""...There is no fundamental difference between good drama and good comedy. Both are character-driven, and in both we see recognizable humans with plausible motivations make choices, and the results -- good or bad -- of those choices.There are problems when mixing comedy and drama. * Because a comedy must necessarily have a ""happy"" ending (or at least a not-unhappy one), the dramatic elements are likely to be seen as unimportant. C C Baxter's problem -- that he's become a sort of ""pimp"" for his bosses, in expectation of promotion -- doesn't weigh heavily on him -- until he discovers that the woman he worships from afar (Fran Kubelik) is the mistress of one of the company's major executives (J D Sheldrake). ** Given that Baxter -- especially as portrayed by Jack Lemmon, for whom the role was explicitly written -- is a fundamentally decent person, the story's outcome is irreversibly fixed at this point. Dr Dreyfuss needn't have urged Baxter to ""be a mensch"" -- he would have eventually gotten around to it, because that's the kind of person he is. (""The Fortune Cookie"" fails for the same reason. Lemmon's character is so clearly defined at the beginning that the ending is a foregone conclusion.) The only reason we don't lose interest is Wilder and Diamond's writing -- they can find solid humor in almost anything, and do.Wilder and Diamond are /so/ focused on being funny -- and they're /brilliantly/ funny -- that the drama is shortchanged. ""The Apartment"" is ultimately unsatisfying, because it doesn't work /as drama/. Both Baxter and Kubelik are reactive characters -- they've fallen into their situations, rather than having initiated them. Had they been more-complex and morally ambiguous people who were consciously ""on the make"" *** and had created the situations they're in, the untangling of their knotted lives would be more interesting and compelling -- though likely less-comic.Though both eventually ""wake up"" to the truths of their lives, they merely ""step away"" from their problems. As difficult as this is, /they do not change/ -- they simply return to being the persons they ""really"" are. And that doesn't make for interesting drama. Holis Alpert's criticism of the film as ""a dirty fairy tale"" has some truth to it -- the ""fairy tale"" part, anyway. The last 60 seconds are too pat, and suggestive of the decline that Wilder's work would soon enter. Yes, the ending is /somewhat/ ambiguous. But whether Baxter and Kubelik ultimately ""get together"" is beside the point. They've fixed the fundamental problems with their lives, which is rather more important than whether they move in with each other.Don't get me wrong -- ""The Apartment"" is an extremely entertaining film. But it's ill-conceived. It would have worked better as a more-or-less straight drama. It's noteworthy that Wilder got a ""Best Picture"" Oscar for what is ultimately a sentimental film, rather than the far superior ""Sunset Blvd."", one of the nastiest films ever made.I urge readers to look at Roger Ebert's appreciative review, which gives little indication that ""The Apartment"" is basically a comedy. All he sees is the drama, which, for me, is the flawed component.-----I viewed the later ""collector's edition"", with a beautiful (if dark) transfer, two ""shorts"" about the making of the film and Jack Lemmon, and a running commentary. The image quality is outstanding, good enough to justify a Blu-ray transfer (if anyone should care to make one).* Though it seems strange to us, some reviewers couldn't handle the mix, even though Wilder switches effortlessly between the two. It also helped that both Lemmon and MacLaine could be believably serious or silly.** There are Sheldrakes in several Wilder films. His fixation on the name has not been explained.*** It's puzzling as to why Kubelik didn't use her relationship with Sheldrake to advance herself.",4,"How can a witty, brilliantly written comedy with
