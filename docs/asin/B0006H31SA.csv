867775,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B0006H31SA,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","Don't be fooled by the title ""Dance Fitness for Beginners.""  Anyone can do this routine except those with weak joints because there is a lot of hopping going on in this workout.  Even the 10 minute warm-up has several hopping moves as well as some fast neck swings.  After you do that, however, MaDonna leads in several stretches.  The 15 minute routine has a mixture of fast footwork and hops.  The beginner would probably do better to get her other ""Dance Fitness for Beginners"" workout, but I personally prefer this one as a workout.  It is more fun and higher cardio.  The cool-down is really good after all of the high cardio moves you do, and it is about 5 minutes.  There is a bonus 10 minute toning workout that works the legs and abs.  This one works the legs more than the abs as opposed to the toning workout in her other partner video which worked both equally.  It is really short, but I like this workout because it is fun.  The 5 back-up dancers are constantly joking around with each other and MaDonna, and the atmosphere is just one of fun.  There was more of African dance in this workout than there was Latin, and that is a unique workout that you don't see a lot.  This is not the same workout as MaDonna's ""All Star Workouts:Afro-Latino"" which I thought it was until I actually bought this.  Overall, this was a high-intensity, fast workout that was just a little too short in my opinion.",4,Short but sweet!,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,1409,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'title', 'Dance', 'Fitness', 'Beginners', 'Anyone', 'can', 'do', 'routine', 'weak', 'joints', 'lot', 'hopping', 'going', 'workout', 'Even', '10', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'several', 'hopping', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'fast', 'neck', 'swings', 'do', 'however', 'MaDonna', 'several', 'stretches', '15', 'minute', 'routine', 'mixture', 'fast', 'footwork', 'hops', 'beginner', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'better', 'get', 'other', 'Dance', 'Fitness', 'Beginners', 'workout', 'personally', 'prefer', 'one', 'workout', 'more', 'fun', 'higher', 'cardio', 'cool-down', 'really', 'good', 'high', 'cardio', 'moves', 'do', '5', 'minutes', 'bonus', '10', 'minute', 'toning', 'legs', 'abs', 'one', 'legs', 'more', 'abs', 'opposed', 'toning', 'workout', 'other', 'partner', 'video', 'worked', 'equally', 'really', 'short', 'like', 'workout', 'fun', '5', 'back-up', 'dancers', 'are', 'constantly', 'joking', 'other', 'MaDonna', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'one', 'fun', 'was', 'more', 'African', 'dance', 'workout', 'was', 'Latin', 'unique', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'not', 'same', 'workout', 'MaDonna', 'All', 'Star', 'Workouts', 'Afro-Latino', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'bought', 'Overall', 'was', 'high-intensity', 'fast', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'opinion']",N/A

She presents the moves in her workouts with clear instructions and a bit of levity, which makes them fun.  However, this particular workout includes some moves that older people, and people with joint issues, can not do.  Headslinging, for example, is impossible with my arthritic neck.  High-impact dance moves are not good for my knees, but I can easily modify those.  Other than that, I found the workouts easy to follow and fun to do.

867780,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0006H31SA,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[615, 622]","Although I really enjoy dance workouts, I was a little wary of this one, as I had heard that instructor MaDonna Grimes didn't cue very well and that there was a lot of ""take-it-from-the-top"" movements, which I dislike.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I LOVED this video!  The workout basically breaks down into 3 segments:  warm-up, dance routine, and cool-down (these are not chaptered on the DVD).  The 10-minute warm-up gets right into some basic dance steps such as the merengue, getting your heart rate up right away.  MaDonna sometimes fails to fully explain the movements, but my minimal experience with just a few prior dance videos allowed me to follow along with no problems.  There are a few small jumps included in this segment, but they don't appear until about 5 minutes into it, when you're already well warmed up; some basic stretches conclude this section.During the 12-minute dance routine section, MaDonna introduces new moves one at a time, gradually building up to a complete dance routine.  When teaching the moves, she did something I'd never seen before that I really liked:  instead of teaching one segment with 3 different moves, a second segment with 3 different moves, and then stringing the two segments together (I always find it difficult to remember the first segment), she'll teach 3 moves and then introduce 2 new ones, but she combines the last move from the first 3 with the 2 new ones (I hope this makes sense!).  This method makes it very easy to remember the order of the moves, as you're constantly combining the older moves that you've already learned with the new moves.  Even more importantly, the moves are FUN--mambos, hops, hip swings, etc.--and the time just flew by!The workout ends with a brief (4-minute) cool-down.  I liked the neck stretches that were included here, although some people might have to be careful with these.  The DVD also includes a 10-minute bonus workout for the lower body:  MaDonna leads you through 4 different types of squats, performing several sets of each, and she ends with some brief standing and floor abs work.  An additional DVD feature is a music-only workout option.  Some people might complain that this workout is too short (about 26 minutes overall), but MaDonna packs a lot of both exertion and fun into that time period, making this video perfect for anyone who wants to get in some quick, intense, yet extremely enjoybable cardio work.

I could see why it's too difficult for someone who is first exposed to dance. With that said, it's fun and energetic but in in short bursts only and there are some new different moves, but it's simply too short like someone else mentioned, with too much marching between moves. I think she repeats all of the combinations uninterrupted 3 times after they are learned and the workout is over. The first time I did the workout I repeated the whole thing twice in an effort to get an adequate workout, but it doesn't flow when done this way. I guess the length of the video is what makes it be for beginners, but I'd think the moves are too complex for them. Also, there is a dancer performance on the DVD that is fine to look at once, but when you buy a workout video, you want to workout, not observe a performance more than once.

Plus, she's having fun, they're having fun, and it's easy to get caught up in it.The Workout:The workout is not terribly intense (it does raise my heart rate a bit, but not anything like P90X or a Zumba class), but it is fun and I use it for break when I'm bored with my other more intense workouts.I recommend it for people who are beginners in the whole dance-workout scene.",4,Silly and Fun,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,613,"['Why', 'So', 'first', 'MaDonna', 'Grimes', 'so', 'darned', 'likable', 'hard', 'not', 'have', 'fun', ""'m"", 'not', 'strong', 'dancer', 'get', 'little', 'lost', 'moves', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'leading', 'having', 'fun', ""'re"", 'having', 'fun', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'it.The', 'Workout', 'workout', 'not', 'terribly', 'intense', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'bit', 'not', 'anything', 'P90X', 'Zumba', 'class', 'fun', 'use', 'break', 'when', ""'m"", 'bored', 'other', 'more', 'intense', 'workouts.I', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'beginners', 'whole', 'dance-workout', 'scene']",N/A

Some of the footwork in this one is just a little more complicated than her other DVD.  But, like she says, if you don't get it the first time, just do it over again - it's so much fun and it goes by so fast that you'll probably want to do it again, anyway (:",5,Another fun one!,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,353,"['fun', 'dance', 'workout', 'MaDonna', 'Grimes', 'also', 'have', 'Urban', 'Street', 'Heat', 'DVD', 'footwork', 'one', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'other', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'fast', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'do', 'again', 'anyway']",N/A
867800,A207275AVUSNE3,B0006H31SA,"M. M. ""inquisitive designer""","[3, 3]","This workout is an intermediate Latin-/African-inspired dance routine.  It is SO fun and SO intense!  This is the only workout DVD I own that gets me really sweating -- and that's a good thing!You need to know some simple Latin dance steps (merengue, mambo, cha-cha) beforehand, or be able to pick them up quickly, because MaDonna jumps into them first thing.  Granted, the merengue is an easy dance move -- just marching while twisting your hips/legs -- but there was zero instuction, so I could see how someone with no dance experience would feel overwhelmed right off the bat.  The ""jumping right in with no instruction"" caught me a little off guard at first, but luckily I have had some Latin dance training and was able to follow along with no problems.  If MaDonna provided instruction by going through the steps at 1/2 time, I would wholeheartedly recommend this workout to beginners.  As is, it's probably most appropriate and fun for those who can easily pick up most coreography.I'd love to take a dance class with MaDonna Grimes.  Her cueing is great.  She's fun and friendly with her backup dancers, frequently talking to them during the routine (like, ""Next is the mambo -- yes, y'all?"" and they shout back, ""YES!"").  A few times, though, MaDonna shouts ""MERENGUE!"" so loud that there's mic feedback, and sometimes she yells ""AAAHH!"" after finishing a particularly intense combo.  If you're following along with the workout, you won't really notice/mind this (I don't -- it's like being in a live dance class), although some people may find it a bit jarring.  For those who don't like lots of whooping and hollering during their workouts, you do have the option to go through the entire routine with just the music (no talking or cueing).Here's what you get on this DVD:- Warm-up: 10 minutes of light-intensity Latin moves, some shimmying, stretching lunges, neck rolls, torso isolations, a few jumps towards the end.  I'm glad this warm-up is as long as it is; you need it to prepare you for the next part!- Workout routine: 15 minutes of INTENSE Latin & African dance steps.  A wildly effective cardio routine that will really get you sweating!- Cool-down: A 5-minute modified version of the warm-up, with light-intensity Latin moves and stretching.- ""Performance"": A pre-recorded hip hop performance that plays immediately after the cool-down, featuring MaDonna and her backup dancers.  Fun, but kind of random -- I did like watching it.- Bonus Workout: A standard aerobic-style 10-minute routine with TONS of squats, some standing/lying ab work, and some stretching.  Probably good for some people, but I don't use this section at all.I do wish there were a second routine before the cool-down or that the main-feature dance workout were longer.  The front of the DVD says ""Leaves You Sweating for More!"" which is true.  You're having so much fun doing the routine that it's over before you know it.  You're standing there after the cool-down, going, ""Wait, that's all?""  So, I'm taking half a star off my rating because I wish the routine were longer, and half a star off because it needs some 1/2 time step instruction to be truly accessible to beginners (although this wasn't a problem for me personally, it would improve the workout's overall quality).  Compared to MaDonna's Urban Street Heat DVD, which I also own and enjoy, this Latin/African routine contains the same segments (warm-up, routine, cool-down) and is the same length of time (30 min.), but is more fun and more intense (makes me work harder, probably burns more calories).In summary, I'm extremely happy that I bought this DVD because the routine is SO fun and really gets my heart pumping.

867804,A1SWMOHC2S4HB5,B0006H31SA,"Raina Singh ""Mmmarshmallow""","[248, 249]","The first time I tried this workout, I loved it so much that I instantly had to do it again.  On the cover of the DVD it says, 'leaves you sweating for more', and with regards to my experience with it so far, that is exactly what it did.  It left me sweating, and wanting more!Here's what you get:10MIN WARMUP - This combines a few low impact dance moves with a few stretches.  Some of the stretches are a bit 'hmmm...', but you only do them after you're VERY warm.  This is around 10 minutes, which is a good length for a warmup.  Some of the moves you learn in the warmup will be re-used in the dance portion of the workout.15MIN DANCE - Madonna teaches you the moves one by one, building together a longer routine.  One thing that I love about her teaching is that once she's taught you a move, she practices what I like to call 'the transition'.  This is where you practice the move that comes just before the new move, as well as the new move.  If that doesn't make sense, say that she's taught moves 1-3 and is teaching you the 4th move.  Once she's taught the 4th move, she practices moves 3 and 4, before going through the whole routine from the 1st move.  This Latin combination includes hip swings, mambos, cha-chas, and a very tricky samba-travel step.5MIN COOL DOWN - Here, Madonna takes you through some of the stretches that you did in the warmup, as well as some neck stretches - some people will need to be careful with these.10MIN BONUS - This is not a african-latin dance segment, but rather a set of intense toning moves.  She teaches 4 different types of squats, as well as some ab work.Madonna and her group of exercisers - both male and female - exercise in a nice street-dance-studio-esque set.  If that doesn't set the scene, the floors are polished wood, and the walls are dark red brick, with pillars, potplants, and windows scattered throughout.  The windows in the room don't overlook anything, but seem to have a screen of turqoise light outside it; emulating a blue sky.  It kind of reminds of the old Ricki Lake sets (back in the day!).In terms of instructor personality, Madonna is a breath of fresh air.  She is relaxed, laid back, and interacts with the other exercisers in a 'hey-wassup-mate' manner.  In addition, they also interact with her the same way - giving a fun atmosphere; like being in a class, but not an extreme 'whoop-it-up' atmosphere like in Kathy Smith's Timesaver Cardio.For those of you who are absolute beginners to dance, you will find this difficult.  What I suggest you do is ignore the arm movements for the first couple of times that you try the DVD, and focus on the getting your legs right.  Also, ignore the samba-travel step and just shuffle here; thats a very difficult step, and it'll only take practice-practice-and-more-practice to get it right.  Madonna moves through the moves pretty quickly, only giving a couple of opportunities to learn the steps before incorporating them into the routine.  She is good at cueing, but not so good at teaching the moves.A word of warning, the second move that she teaches in the dance portion (which also appears in the warmup) involves you swinging your arms and your head.  Take it easy on this move, since I really got into it, and it was inevitable that I heard a big CRACK from my neck, oops!  It looks like Madonna and one of the other girls are going hard out with this move, but thats because their hair is long, so for your safety, don't try to emulate them.A refreshing, intense, short workout that is LOADS of fun!

She incorporates cute, aerobic movements to increase heart rate, but not something you'd want to be caught dead on the dance floor. She start a new movement does it only 2-3x in normal speed, no slowing down or break-down, then moves on the next, to build a routine.They say you can rewind if you can't get it. I'd be very frustrated by having to keep stopping, grab the remote & rewind to right spot over & over & in slow-mo.... What's wrong with teaching it 1/2 times several times? Once you have mastered the steps, you can just do it normal while the dancers go slow.I like DVDs more where you stick to it more then 1-2x to really get a feel for it before turning it into a whole routine. The music had a nice beat, but it was about one step from elevator music. She does have a nice, upbeat, friendly personality & talks to the other dancer which is nice.The entire workout is ONLY 28 minutes long INCLUDING the warm up & cool down.The bonus workout w/Madonna is 2 min of warm up with basic 80s/90s aerobics fast-paced arm & high kick leg movements, then 3 min of a $*#!load of squats, then 1.5 min of basic plies, then 1 min of standing toning abs/leg pose, then on the floor for 1 min for basic ab crunches w/legs in air, then 3 stretches for legs & spine. She does it in your basic gym aerobics instructor, no dance or flair.The DVD also has a ""performance"" after the cool down of her & the 3 girls & 2 guys dancing in a modern dance & most had moves that looked learned in dance school & some break dancing. There's trailers for her other video & the Havana one & a belly dancing one.Madonna Grimes had made previous simple stage, very complex dance steps videos which she breaks down into 8-count & teaches in 1/2 time at first & assumed this would be broken down as well.You can see a trailer at collagevideo",3,No Breakdown for Non-Dancers,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1917,"['have', 'many', 'dancing', 'DVDs', 'love', 'been', 'doing', '2', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'need', 'breakdown', 'cute', 'aerobic', 'movements', 'increase', 'heart', 'rate', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'dance', 'floor', 'start', 'new', 'movement', 'only', '2-3x', 'normal', 'speed', 'slowing', 'down', 'break-down', 'then', 'next', 'build', 'routine.They', 'say', 'can', 'rewind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'frustrated', 'having', 'keep', 'stopping', 'grab', 'remote', 'rewind', 'right', 'spot', 'slow-mo', 'What', 'wrong', 'teaching', '1/2', 'times', 'several', 'times', 'Once', 'have', 'mastered', 'steps', 'can', 'just', 'do', 'normal', 'dancers', 'go', 'slow.I', 'DVDs', 'more', 'where', 'stick', 'more', 'then', '1-2x', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'turning', 'whole', 'routine', 'music', 'had', 'nice', 'beat', 'was', 'one', 'step', 'elevator', 'music', 'have', 'nice', 'upbeat', 'friendly', 'personality', 'talks', 'other', 'dancer', 'nice.The', 'entire', 'workout', 'ONLY', '28', 'minutes', 'long', 'INCLUDING', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down.The', 'bonus', 'workout', 'w/Madonna', '2', 'min', 'warm', 'up', 'basic', '80s/90s', 'aerobics', 'fast-paced', 'arm', 'high', 'kick', 'leg', 'movements', 'then', '3', 'min', '*', 'load', 'squats', 'then', '1.5', 'min', 'basic', 'plies', 'then', '1', 'min', 'standing', 'toning', 'abs/leg', 'pose', 'then', 'floor', '1', 'min', 'basic', 'ab', 'crunches', 'w/legs', 'air', 'then', '3', 'stretches', 'legs', 'spine', 'basic', 'gym', 'aerobics', 'instructor', 'dance', 'flair.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'performance', 'cool', 'down', '3', 'girls', '2', 'guys', 'dancing', 'modern', 'dance', 'most', 'had', 'moves', 'looked', 'learned', 'dance', 'school', 'break', 'dancing', 'trailers', 'other', 'video', 'Havana', 'one', 'belly', 'dancing', 'Grimes', 'had', 'made', 'previous', 'simple', 'stage', 'very', 'complex', 'dance', 'steps', 'videos', 'down', '8-count', 'teaches', '1/2', 'time', 'first', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'well.You', 'can', 'see', 'trailer', 'collagevideo']",N/A

I've never had official dance training - just did LOTS of dancing out at bars (ha) ""back in the day"".  She is great about doing some moves, adding to it, repeating it, and building on that.  What's better is she is having fun with it and makes you have fun with it too!  The whole class is having fun and they all really make you feel like you're right there with them laughing and saying YEAH - I DID IT!  It's such a great motivator.  I just love it.
