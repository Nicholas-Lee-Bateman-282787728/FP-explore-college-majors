The film's plot isn't believeable if you were to describe it to someone but do that person a favor and lend the film to them. The film transports you into a world where a young artist sketches a portrait of a demure young girl and gains critical fame for his work only to realize that he needs his muse to maitain this new found level of brilliance. He searches for and finds her to only realize how she seems to have grown into an adult in a very short period of time, and he falls in love with this newly matured beauty. Jennifer Jones as Jennie talks about events in her life as if they happened yesterday and to her they have! Just watch the sparkle in Jones' eyes as she talk to Cotten about her parents when they meet for the first time in Central park. Cotten's character Eben Adams is intrigued by her but the events she describes have taken place years not days ago!! Is this woman real? Will their love endure? I won't give a hint more about the plot but the final scenes will have you crying so hard you can't see the action on screen. Jones was made for this role and Selznick knew it! Cotton is also quite believable. The dialogue is sweeter than powered sugar on top of ice cream with sugar sauce on top!

No extras aside from subtitles are included.Now, ""Portrait of Jennie"" is, indeed, something from another world largely due to Jones' excellent performance.  Her ethereal beauty was never more evident than in this picture (including The Song of Bernadette).  There is pure magic between her and Joseph Cotten, the poor, lonely artist who captures the magic on canvas.  The ending shot of the portrait is haunting...as is the picture itself.  Jones was perfect casting for Jennie and unlike many of her other portrayals, her facial expressions and contortions during the overly dramatic scenes are not evident here making this portrayal one of her best.

Erland,"[8, 8]","`Portrait of Jennie' released in '48 is a romantic, mesmerizing, highly evocative tale examining the ill-defined boundaries between time and space, love and obsession, insight and illusion.Storyline: Eben Adams (Joseph Cotton) is a struggling artist who can't seem to make a living at his chosen craft. When a sympathetic art dealer (Ethel Barrymore) kindly agrees to purchase a few of his paintings she encourages him to look deeper into himself for a source of inspiration. Eben discovers that inspiration in the image of Jennie (Jennifer Jones) a beautiful young girl he meets in the park. It is the first of a series of encounters with this enchanting maiden and with each new encounter she appears to have aged appreciably from the previous visit, quickly advancing from girlish teenager to confident young woman. The love struck Eben re-discovers his passion for his art and begins to paint a portrait of Jennie. As the completion of the painting draws ever closer he cannot help but wonder who or what is this hauntingly attractive sprite that now occupies his every waking thought? Is she real or imaginary, living or dead? Poor Eben decides he must discover the truth for himself no matter what the cost.The cinematography is exquiste and the haunting melodies of Claude Debussy, arranged and conducted by Dimitri Tiomkin, make for a truly enjoyable viewing and listening experience.Highly Recommended!",5,"""The Wind Blows, The Sea Flows, Nobody Knows""  ~  Summoning The Muse, Or Conjuring A Spirit?",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,1411,"['Portrait', 'Jennie', 'released', ""'48"", 'romantic', 'mesmerizing', 'highly', 'evocative', 'tale', 'examining', 'ill-defined', 'boundaries', 'time', 'space', 'love', 'obsession', 'insight', 'illusion.Storyline', 'Eben', 'Adams', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'struggling', 'artist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'living', 'chosen', 'craft', 'When', 'sympathetic', 'art', 'dealer', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'kindly', 'purchase', 'few', 'paintings', 'look', 'deeper', 'source', 'inspiration', 'Eben', 'inspiration', 'image', 'Jennie', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'park', 'first', 'series', 'encounters', 'enchanting', 'maiden', 'new', 'encounter', 'have', 'aged', 'appreciably', 'previous', 'visit', 'quickly', 'advancing', 'girlish', 'teenager', 'confident', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'struck', 'Eben', 're-discovers', 'passion', 'art', 'paint', 'portrait', 'Jennie', 'completion', 'painting', 'ever', 'closer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'who', 'what', 'hauntingly', 'attractive', 'sprite', 'now', 'waking', 'thought', 'real', 'imaginary', 'living', 'dead', 'Poor', 'Eben', 'must', 'discover', 'truth', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.The', 'cinematography', 'exquiste', 'haunting', 'melodies', 'Claude', 'Debussy', 'arranged', 'conducted', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'make', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'listening', 'experience.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

503390,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00000ICYG,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","""Portrait of Jennie"" is a story of a man's obsession with the ideal woman, what lends fascination to this subject is that here art is reflecting life.  Just as the fictional Eben Adams (Joseph Cotton), a struggling painter finds his muse in the gossamer Jennie Appleton (Jennifer Jones), so larger than life producer David O. Selznick of ""Gone With the Wind"" fame believed he had found his Galatea in the shy, dark eyed beauty Jennifer Jones.  Selznick had been a known star maker for actresses, having discovered and presented in their American film debuts, Katharine Hepburn, Vivien Leigh and Ingrid Bergman.  Yet, they all managed to elude his orbit, and he became fixated on discovering the fledgling ing&eacute;nue that he could mold and develop into a sublime actress.  The struggling neophyte Phyllis Isley, when screen-tested struck a chord with him, he had already chosen the first name ""Jennifer"",  for his discovery and then the surname followed ""Jones"".  The newly rechristened  ""Jennifer Jones "" shot to stardom in her Oscar winning beatific portrayal of Saint Bernadette of Lourdes in ""The Song of Bernadette.""What Selznick didn't count on was that just as in Greek mythology the sculptor Pygmalion falls desperately in love with his peerless creation Galatea, so did Selznick with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e despite the fact that both were already married each with two young sons.  After a tempestuous courtship, they would finally marry in 1949, the year after ""Portrait of Jennie"" premiered. However Selznick would devote all his considerable energies before and after to find film properties that would present Ms. Jones to best advantage and showcase her versatility.  He had done so successfully with ""Since You Went Away"", ""Love Letters"" and ""Duel in the Sun"", and ""Portrait of Jennie"" was to be Selznick's love poem to the bewitching Ms. Jones who so held him in thrall.  Besides this, Selznick was haunted by the fear he would never surpass ""Gone With the Wind"", and with each film he made afterwards was trying to top himself.  Unfortunately, despite all the lavish care, energy, time and money Selznick poured into it, initially although it had its adherents, the film was a flop, although with time it has achieved cult status.Based on a novelette of the same name by Robert Nathan, ""Portrait of Jennie"" is set in New York City in the winter of 1934.  Impoverished artist Eben Adams (Joseph Cotton) finally has a glimmer of hope one late afternoon, when he makes a small sale of one of his paintings to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore) an art dealer overriding her dubious partner Matthews (Cecil Kellaway).  On his way home he walks through Central Park, it's the ""magic hour"" between sundown and twilight, where he encounters a precocious quaintly dressed little girl (Jennifer Jones) making a snowman.  She introduces herself as Jennie Appleton.  As Adams and she chat he realizes there is something odd about the child, she refers to persons and places of about 20 years before.  Before they part, Jennie wishes that he will wait for her to grow up so they can be together always.  Her unique qualities intrigue Adams, and he does a sketch of Jennie from memory that impresses both Matthews and Spinney with its excellence, and they buy it.  Miss Spinney tells him that he at last has found the inspiration that was lacking in his earlier work, and he should pursue it.  Jennie reappears from time to time to Adams within the next few months, at first usually in Central Park at or close to the bench where they met, but strangely each time she has grown noticeably taller and older.  When Adams notices and remarks on it, she tells him she is growing as fast as she can, so she can catch up with him and they can be together always.  As spring arrives, Jennie has blossomed into a lovely young college girl, and the avuncular fondness Eben has felt for her deepens into love, as he begins to paint her portrait.  She becomes his muse,  the wellspring of his talent is released  through her inspiration.  However he is more than a little puzzled and disturbed, as he tries to find out more about Jennie.  Using the slim facts she has supplied about her life, he talks to older people that knew Jennie, and finds out that the Jennie Appleton they knew, who would seem to be the same person was born around the turn of the century!  Also, no one else seems to see Jennie except for Eben, and his loyal friend Gus O'Toole (David Wayne) and Miss Spinney who has become his mentor are concerned about his mental well-being.  Is Jennie a real flesh and blood woman, or a supernatural visitation?Of necessity, this is a very romantic film, very similar in spirit to the prior year's fantasy ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir""  The film has a very atmospheric, mystical quality that adds immeasurably to the story.  For the film to succeed, it's imperative that Jennie possess a fey air of enchantment, a dreamy aspect, a sense of mystery, an unfulfilled promise.  Ms. Jones brings all this to the role, and so much more.  In her delicate playing, she easily and believably bridges the transition in age, since Jennie appears to be about six or so when Eben first meets her to a young woman in her early twenties at the film's climax.  She is assisted in this by the expert cinematography of Joseph August and Lee Garnes, which gives her a luminous, almost celestial loveliness, and the absolutely perfect costumes  of Lucinda Ballard, ranging from the huge, black cartwheel hat and sailor coat in Jennie's initial appearance to the utterly simple, ruffled white gown she wears in her portrait.Mr. Cotton as Eben Adams matches Ms. Jones excellence, he has to tread a fine line to make the fragile fantasy work, plus he possesses the easy charm and manly handsomeness needed for a romantic hero.  He won the Best Actor award at the 1949 Venice Film Festival.  The strong supporting cast is equally impressive, Ethel Barrymore, Lillian Gish, Cecil Kellaway, Florence Bates, Henry Hull, Felix Bressart and imported directly from the then current Broadway hit ""Finian's Rainbow"" David Wayne and Albert Sharpe.The aforementioned cinematography of Joseph August is superb; Manhattan as presented in the scenes between Jennie and Eben, seems spellbound, a city caught in time.  At times, August captures the city as though it was a painting, shooting through canvas that is very effective.  Another big plus, is the actual location shooting in New York City, it's a treat to see the town in its postwar glory days, we get to visit Central Park with its Wollman skating rink, the Cloisters, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Although most of the film is evocatively black and white, a spectacular hurricane sequence is shot in an eerie sea green, the last scenes in sepia, similar to the ending of another notable fantasy ""The Wizard of Oz""  A final exhilarating touch that fittingly closes the film is the actual portrait of Jennie in vivid, glorious Technicolor!  He was deservedly rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his work. Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score uses theme's from composer Claude Debussy, including his ""Prelude to Afternoon of a Faun"" that adds immeasurably to the film's stylistic aura.  Noted playwright Paul Osborn collaborating with Peter Berneis skillfully adapts Nathan's work for the screen, and a nod of appreciation to veteran director William Dieterle for making all the disparate elements mesh into a quintessential romantic fantasy.  Finally kudos to the artist Robert Brackman who in fact painted the actual elegiac ""Portrait of Jennie"".If you are a dyed in the wool romantic at heart, as I think I am, this is a film you will want

503391,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B00000ICYG,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[0, 0]","For a movie that centers on the relationship between a ghost and a very much alive artist, this is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. The premise of the movie is that struggling artist Eben Adams(played by Joseph Cotton) meets a young girl named Jennie Appleton (Jennifer Jones) late one snowy afternoon in Central Park. There is something charming about this girl that evokes an earlier time and place as both characters are drawn to one another. They continue meeting in the park and each time Jennie reveals more about herself, her friends, her family, and world events. Jennie also appears to be suffering from rapid aging syndrome. She keeps insisting that Eben ""wait"" for her to grow up. While all this is going on, Eben deals with Jennie's obvious charm and inexplicable growth spurts and also questions much of what she says because she seems to be living in a time warp which is rapidly closing. Eben begins to paint Jennie's portrait as they also fall in love. As Jennie's portait progresses, the relationship between the two progresses to a romantic relationship. Whatever Eben's artistic talents are, this portrait begins to have an almost magical element as it picks up on Jennie's ephemeral beauty.I won't give away the ending, but this movie hits all the right notes in regard to the movie's main theme of eternal love. The somewhat improbable story of someone visiting from a different time works because the script is totally believable. Combined with great casting and photography that is truly beautiful visually, this is one extremely intense love story that really does manage to gap its quirky time element and fully support its main theme.

503392,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00000ICYG,Craig Connell,"[7, 7]","""Portrait Of Jennie"" continues to be my all-time favorite romance story, partly because it features time travel, which I usually find fascinating, and two of my most-liked classic actors: Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten.Mainly, this is a haunting story that stays with you....at least, it has stayed with me since I first saw it.Once you get past the stupid beginning narration,  the film is pure charm and who better to exhibit that than Jones? Few women ever looked more wholesome, sounded sweeter and looked more beautiful than this actress, who really projected innocence as she showed in her Academy Award winning debut in ""The Song Of Bernadette"" earlier in the decade.Cotten is a good match for her in this film. An underrated star, he had a great voice and magnetism of his own.However, the more I watch this film the more I am fascinated with Ethel Barrymore, who plays the kindly, spinster art museum owner. She has an extremely knowledgeable countenance and delivery of speech. Cecil Kellaway plays her art museum partner and rounds out this very likable cast.. The are no ""bad guys"" in this film......just good people.The mystical time-space quality in this romance, something akin to 1980''s ""Somewhere In Time,"" fascinates throughout and special effects are pretty darn good, too, considering when it was made.For me, as with others, this movie was a haunting one: a film that moves me each time I see it. I have viewed perhaps 10,000 films in my 60 years and this one still ranks in the Top Ten.Thanks to it being available on DVD - and at a cheap price - more and more people are discovering this gem. This is one of those classic movies that would still appeal to younger people today.....at least, I hope I would.",5,One Of My All-Time Favorite Classics,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,1732,"['Portrait', 'Jennie', 'be', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'romance', 'story', 'partly', 'time', 'travel', 'usually', 'find', 'fascinating', 'two', 'most-liked', 'classic', 'actors', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Joseph', 'Cotten.Mainly', 'haunting', 'story', 'least', 'stayed', 'first', 'saw', 'it.Once', 'get', 'stupid', 'beginning', 'narration', 'film', 'pure', 'charm', 'who', 'better', 'exhibit', 'Jones', 'Few', 'women', 'ever', 'looked', 'more', 'wholesome', 'sounded', 'sweeter', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'who', 'really', 'projected', 'innocence', 'showed', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'debut', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'earlier', 'decade.Cotten', 'good', 'match', 'film', 'underrated', 'star', 'had', 'great', 'voice', 'magnetism', 'own.However', 'more', 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'am', 'fascinated', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'kindly', 'spinster', 'art', 'museum', 'owner', 'extremely', 'knowledgeable', 'countenance', 'delivery', 'speech', 'Cecil', 'Kellaway', 'art', 'museum', 'partner', 'out', 'very', 'likable', 'cast..', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'film', 'just', 'good', 'people.The', 'mystical', 'time-space', 'quality', 'romance', 'something', 'akin', '1980', 's', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'too', 'considering', 'when', 'was', 'made.For', 'others', 'movie', 'was', 'haunting', 'one', 'film', 'time', 'see', 'have', 'viewed', 'perhaps', '10,000', 'films', '60', 'years', 'one', 'still', 'Top', 'Ten.Thanks', 'being', 'available', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'price', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'discovering', 'gem', 'one', 'classic', 'movies', 'would', 'still', 'appeal', 'younger', 'people', 'today', '..at', 'least', 'hope', 'would']",N/A

503394,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00000ICYG,DarthRad,"[3, 50]","I remember reading this story in junior high school - it's a wonderful, haunting tale of the love between a struggling artist and a mysterious girl who ages in fast forward.This was the first time I had ever seen the movie, and right off the bat, I was bothered by Jennifer Jones's appearance.  Jones's features immediately struck me as those of someone who had recently had plastic surgery.  I've seen enough of these to know the subtle signs.For this fantasy storyline to work, one has to accept Jennifer Jones as a sweet, innocent young girl who grows up into a twenty something woman.  And Jones's plastic appearance immediately put the kibosh on any possibility of being believable as sweet and innocentAt the time that this movie was made (filmed at various times from 1947 to 1948), Jennifer Jones was already 28-29 years old.  That's the age at which some fair skinned people start having the beginnings of wrinkles and sagging skin.  No doubt she needed some work to make her face as smooth as a young teenager again.  Unfortunately, whoever did her surgery didn't quite get it right (there are better plastic surgeons these days).The multitude of closeup shots in this movie only emphasize the dissonance in the appearance of Jones's face.  The skin on her cheeks and forehead are taught as a drum, and her cheekbones are emphasized while the cheeks are hollowed out.  In some closeup shots, there are still a few wrinkles in her eyelids, while in other shots the underside of her jaw bulges and sags slightly.  These are areas that a modern surgeon could have taken care of better.The biggest problem in her appearance is that her mouth is widened out unnaturally by this selective (and somewhat overdone) pulling of skin.  That's because the basic facelift involves pulling the skin from the side, and trimming off the excess in an incision right in front of the ears.  Do this to yourself in front of a mirror and you will see the effect - the cheeks get tightened and hollowed out, the cheekbones emphasized, and the mouth is widened laterally by this skin pulling.I couldn't help but focus on Jennifer Jones's odd looking facelift appearance as I watched this movie.  It sure ruined it.Ugh.....",2,"Lovely, haunting story, marred by an unrealistic Jennifer Jones",1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2209,"['remember', 'reading', 'story', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'wonderful', 'haunting', 'tale', 'love', 'struggling', 'artist', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'who', 'fast', 'forward.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'right', 'bat', 'was', 'bothered', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'appearance', 'Jones', 'features', 'immediately', 'struck', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'had', 'plastic', 'surgery', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'know', 'subtle', 'signs.For', 'fantasy', 'storyline', 'work', 'accept', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'twenty', 'something', 'woman', 'Jones', 'plastic', 'appearance', 'immediately', 'put', 'kibosh', 'possibility', 'being', 'believable', 'sweet', 'innocentAt', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'filmed', 'various', 'times', '1947', '1948', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'was', 'already', '28-29', 'years', 'old', 'age', 'fair', 'skinned', 'people', 'start', 'having', 'beginnings', 'wrinkles', 'sagging', 'skin', 'doubt', 'needed', 'work', 'make', 'face', 'as', 'smooth', 'young', 'teenager', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'whoever', 'did', 'surgery', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'right', 'are', 'better', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'days', '.The', 'multitude', 'closeup', 'shots', 'movie', 'only', 'emphasize', 'dissonance', 'appearance', 'Jones', 'face', 'skin', 'cheeks', 'forehead', 'are', 'taught', 'drum', 'cheekbones', 'are', 'emphasized', 'cheeks', 'are', 'hollowed', 'out', 'closeup', 'shots', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'wrinkles', 'eyelids', 'other', 'shots', 'underside', 'jaw', 'bulges', 'sags', 'slightly', 'are', 'areas', 'modern', 'surgeon', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'care', 'better.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'appearance', 'mouth', 'widened', 'out', 'unnaturally', 'selective', 'somewhat', 'overdone', 'pulling', 'skin', 'basic', 'facelift', 'pulling', 'skin', 'side', 'trimming', 'off', 'excess', 'incision', 'right', 'front', 'ears', 'Do', 'yourself', 'front', 'mirror', 'will', 'see', 'effect', 'cheeks', 'get', 'tightened', 'hollowed', 'out', 'cheekbones', 'emphasized', 'mouth', 'widened', 'laterally', 'skin', 'pulling.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'focus', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'odd', 'looking', 'facelift', 'appearance', 'watched', 'movie', 'sure', 'ruined', 'it.Ugh', '..']",N/A

Even in black & white, Jennifer Jones is simply luminous;and any guy who wishes to just once meet a ""Jennie"" in his life, can relate to ""everyman"" lead Joseph Cotten. And to the ""newbie"" who wants to know ""what's so special?"" about Jennifer Jones,you need look no further than this film.Even when I first saw it as a 12 year old, I noticed the ahead-of-it's-time cinematography by the great Joseph August, who died of a heart attack before filming was completed.He was another victim of Jennifer Jones producer husband David O' Selznick's attempt (of too many) to top ""Gone With The Wind"", a ""back-story"" rivaling the size of the production itself, with the meddling Selznick scrapping footage, demanding re-takes, and many more changes to every aspect of the film that ballooned production costs close to ""Gone With the Wind's"" $4 million budget, making it impossible for it to ever make a profit at the box office.It was only as time went by, and all the Selznick PR-Machine hoopla for the film was forgotten, that people were able to see this romantic fantasy for themselves, and take it in without being pushed to do so. And though the ""Selznick touch"" could have made an essentially short story overblown, to his credit, it does help distract viewers not to dwell on the fact the basic premise is actually far-fetched, and enhances the romantic, intimate moments with a magic that's necessary to make the story work as a film.But even with the now-cliche Debussy themes that are used, I never cease to melt every time I watch this film.

Although, it must be said, ""Portrait of Jennie"" is a superior film.There's something with these people-meeting-from-different-times-theme-based films, that have this special, strange & weird effect on me, being this movie (in my opinion) the definite masterpiece of its kind. For those who are interested, besides the mentioned above, you can try both versions of ""Smilin' Through"" (1932 & 1941), ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" (1947), ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980), and although not strictly of the kind, ""Peter Ibbetson"" (1935).Jennifer Jones does a very fine job in the difficult part of the ethereal Jennie, giving credibility at the character's different stages of her life. Joseph Cotten, a very fine actor, is absolutely believable as the obsessed artist, who learns (unknowingly) that until one really loves somebody, one hasn't really lived.Ethel Barrymore, grand dame of the American Theater and an occasional character film actress, gives a great performance in a part worthy of her talent, as the owner of an Art Gallery who befriends Cotten, becoming sort of her mentor. Others in the exceptional supporting cast: Cecil Kellaway (as Barrymore's partner), sweet grand lady of the silent screen, the legendary Lillian Gish (as a Nun) and funny and very human David Wayne (as Cotten's pal).Trust me, if you're a sensitive person, this movie will linger in your mind for several days after watching it, and it won't end there, you will want to ""experience"" it again and again. Since I bought this dvd, and I've got a big video and dvd collection, I have watched it at least four times, not counting all the times I had previously seen it on TV's late night showings.The dvd edition quality is very good and it gives one the special opportunity of watching the film in the original way it was intended to be seen, most of it in black and white, then switching to green shading (for the storm sequence), then to sepia tone and the final shot in full Technicolor, a special treat.The dvd has no bonuses, except for the film's original trailer and, believe me, this picture does not need anything else!!Jennifer Jones & Joseph Cotten starred in three other excellent pictures prior to this final pairing: ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Love Letters"" (1945) and ""Duel in the Sun"", all of them produced by David O.

She in this world, but not of this world, and the entire film is as enchanting to the viewer as Jennie (Jennifer Jones) is to Eben (Cotton).  Ethyl Barrimore, another actress who always had an ""other world"" quality becomes Eben's mentor in the art world, and his mother-figure confidant.  Through her caring eyes we see both how his friends love him and fear for how the world would think he is insane.Beautifully shot in ways that are still astounding, to make the film look like a painter's canvas, and also to make Jennie look somehow far away, even when she is in Eben's arms, the film is mainly in black and white, but as we reach the stormy climax, color comes into the frame, until the final shot in full color is the full realization of the promise of the film.  Rarely has any film so successfully had the filming itself be as magical as the story.  This is the ultimate romantic fantasy, a story and film that love can not only transcend time, it is beyond time.

However it has aged well and is still very watchable even after all this time.  It is a ghost story, a drama, a romance and a mystery all rolled into one neat black and white package.  The plot revolves around a young girl, called Jennie Appleton, the beautiful Jenny Jones, who meets up with a young (but very poor) and aspiring artist when she is just a child.  Eben Adams, the artist, played well by the actor Joseph Cotton is smitten by this confident and fragile little girl who tells him she will grow up quickly so they can be together one day.  Of course he doesn't believe her because she is just a child, but what he doesn't know is that Jennie is a ghost, and she has fallen in love with him.  What follows is a tender love story about loss, love and the redemption of the human soul.  Jennie becomes Eben's muse and his future paintings are suddenly in great demand.  However Eben is quickly finding out that there is more to Jennie than meets the eye, and eventually he has to acknowledge that even though he can hold her in his arms and kiss her beautiful face, Jennie is a ghost and that she is destined to be lost to him very soon by the same quirk of supernatural fate that brought her to him in the first place.  Eben, however is desperate to save Jennie and so he sets out to the island where she so tragically drowned in a violent storm so many years ago and it is here he learns that you cannot always have what you want, and that if you love someone you have to let them go even though it breaks your heart.  A haunting sound track accompanies this delightful tearjerker of a film, and the cast is exemplary from the secret rebel Gus O'Toole (David Wayne) who hires Eben to paint scenes from Irish history on his Tavern walls to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore at her best) who buys one Eben's paintings and becomes first his friend and then his agent.  There's even a very young Brian Keith in a minor role as an ice-skater, though if you blink too quickly you will miss his scene!  Portrait of Jennie is a timeless classic of a film.  It is as good as Now Voyager and Casablanca.

Selznick was so obssessed with Jennifer Jones that his judgement was clouded when it comes to choosing film projects for her. In the case of &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;, this movie ran over budgeted when Selznick decided to add in a pompous &quot;epic finale&quot; with wind, waves and green tint.When it was released, Portrait of Jennie did not set the world on fire, and it wasn't a hit. But years later, it have gone on to become a classic.Joseph Cotten played an artist who ran into a young girl named Jennie in Central Park. The strange part of it is that for each successive time he meets her again, she grew older. With information he got from talking to Jennie, he did some research and found out to his astonishment that the girl he has been talking to could be the ghost of a dead woman. When the anniversary of the death of her parents came, Cotten find her grieving in the park. Pretty soon, as Jennie grew into a beautiful mature woman, Cotten fell in love with her. And when the anniversary of her death approaches, Cotten was determined to change history by rescuing Jennie from her fate. Alas, that was not to be, but the love the two share inspired the portrait of the young woman, hence the name of the movie.Jennifer Jones delivered another high caliber performance. She can actually convincingly played a young little girl and then slowly turning into a mature young woman. It is my belief that if David O. Selznick's obsession with Jennifer caused her to become one of the most underrated actresses from the old Hollywood studio system. Her performance in this movie is absolutely mesmerising.Portrait of Jennie captures Jennifer Jones in all her glory.

Movie after movie he produced as a testament to her beauty and his inflated opinion of her talent.  Back in the day, people scoffed, but looking at the movies now, for the most part, Jones meets or exceeds Selznick's expectations.  She really could do almost anything, and even if she couldn't she gave it her best shot.  We admire her for being game, if nothing else, though this enthusiasm leads sometimes to tastelessness, such as her impersonation of Eurasian Lin Yutang in LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING, or trying to imitate a young teen girl in this film, PORTRAIT OF JENNIE, a sensitive attempt but one doomed to failure, she just comes off as a little nutty and Joseph Cotten's interest in her a little prurient.He's playing Eben Adams, a painter without a subject, evidently a dilemma dreamed up by someone who was never a painter and knows nothing about the way painters work.  And yet the movie makes you believe this, makes you feel Eben's pain, indeed we see it as part of a general postwar malaise, as though Adorno had spoken that there would be no subjects in painting after Auschwitz.  Through the months to come Eben undertakes a course in humility from his art dealer, Peggy Guggenheim-no, no, I mean Ethel Barrymore!  She's the one who advises him that he's all about empty formalism and that he needs soul.Which he gets in spades from the lovely Jennie Appleton.  I wonder if Selznick first became interested in Robert Nathan's novel primarily because of the coincidence of its heroine's name, how closely it resembled his wife's?  Remember that he changed her name already, from Phyllis Isley, the name under which she first acted in her earliest films, and then when she met Selznick he named her Jennifer Jones.  Dieterle's film is a ""portrait of Jennie"" in every sense, from child to old woman, from love object to passionate embodiment of lust, from black and white to Technicolor, from living to dead and back again.

Selznick was obsessed with his second wife Jennifer Jones, and he found a lovely vehicle for her in &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;, an otherworldly romance pairing her once again with  Joseph Cotten. One wonders whether Selznick saw himself somehow in Cotten, since he and Jennifer Jones appeared so often together in his movies.Cotten plays a disgruntled artist, Eben Adams, who can't make a sale because, as gallery owner Ethel Barrymore points out to him, there is no love in his work, and he must learn to love something. Right on cue, he encounters an elfin child in Central Park who tells him her name is Jennie. She too tells him his work is not good, but suggests he draw her before seeming to vanish. Taken with the experience, Adams does draw the child, and is on his way towards better work. The rest of the movie concerns itself with his continued sightings of the bewitching Jennie, who is always older than she was last time, even though only a few weeks have passed. She is at last the muse his artwork has needed, but like so many inspirations, she seems always to elude him. Not until Adams confronts a nun played by Lillian Gish does the secret of Jennie finally burst upon him, and the result is a climax with a standout special effect at Cape Cod.Like this special effect at Cape Cod, there is some really interesting photography in &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;. For one thing, whenever Cotten is about to meet Jones again, the scene is overlaid with something to make it appear like a painted canvas, which is very effective. The lighting on Jennifer Jones when Cotten paints her gives her an unearthly beauty as well.Jennifer Jones does a good job as Jennie: the early characterization reminds one of her Bernadette, while she matures into an alluring woman by the film's conclusion. It was also fun for a New Yorker like me to see how many scenes were filmed in Central Park, and how even the convent school where Jennie went to school turned out to be Fort Tryon's The Cloisters Museum. The last scene, the technicolor debut of the &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; is appropriately enough in the upstairs hall of the uncredited Metropolitan Museum of Art.Drawbacks? Cut out David Wayne and his sham Irish brogue. His scenes are quite unnecessary. Both I and my sister-in-law felt something else was going to happen with the Ethel Barrymore character, since she got such prominent attention. She seems to be on the verge of disclosing a secret, but it comes to naught.However, these are small complaints about a very good picture.

503426,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B00000ICYG,Nix Pix,"[60, 61]","""Portrait of Jennie"" is the embodiment of ethereal supernatural melodrama at its very best. The film stars Joseph Cotton as disgruntled artist, Eben Adams. Disgusted at his inability to make inroads into the artistic community, Adams artistic sensibilities are castrated by gallery owner, Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore) who points out that there is no passion in his work. Disillusioned once more, Adams is all set to toss his fledgling career in the ash can when he suddenly comes in contact with the sprite, Jennie (Jennifer Jones). Though she too doesn't have much to say about Adams work, he suddenly becomes inspired by her and begins to sketch her portrait in Central Park. However, before he can finish, Jennie vanishes into thin air. Taken with the experience, Adams persists to draw Jennie from memory and consequently finds his muse. Throughout the film, Adams will repeatedly come in contact with the ghostly Jennie; each time she grows older than during their previous meetings. Not until Adams confronts an old nun, Mother Mary of Mercy (Lillian Gish) is the secret of Jennie finally revealed.By 1948 David O. Selznick was fighting a losing war on a double front. His dreams of transforming his wife, Jennifer Jones into an actress, the stature of Garbo, had been met with increasing critical disdain. He was also by this point in his professional career well into a period of economic decline from which he and his studio would never recover. That ""Portrait of Jennie"" failed to find its audience at the box office suggests more of a post war cynicism for films with embellished romantic subplots - all of which had been highly successful and in great demand during Selznick's 30s tenure. However, at the time of its release it did nothing to alleviate Selznick's fiscal crisis.MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&W; picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up but pixelization is kept to a minimum. Overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage.

Fortunately, director William Dieterle maintained a light touch throughout, managing just the right mood for each segment of the film.  What could have easily have been hokey instead is eerie and delightful.PORTRAIT OF JENNIE is unique not just for its subject matter, but for being one of the very, very few films of the Hollywood studio era to have been filmed on location in New York.  Almost always in the 1930s and 1940s, a film that was supposedly set in New York or Chicago would in fact be filmed on a Hollywood back lot.  In this case, that would have been a serious blow to the atmosphere of the film, since the numerous scenes shot in Central Park, with the unique skyline framing the park, creates imagery unlike any other film of the time.The cast overall is quite excellent.  Jennifer Jones is not completely believable in her role, but, then, I am not sure many actresses could have been.  She is asked to age too much during the course of the film, and no adult actress is going to be completely believable as small girl and as an adult.  I always love seeing Joseph Cotton in anything, and this was one of his finest romantic roles.  The cast is filled out with a bevy of notable character actresses and actors, such as David Wayne, Lillian Gish, Ethel Barrymore, Florence Bates, Cecil Kellaway, and Henry Hull.The ending is a bit anticlimactic.  The heart of the story is Eben Adams's (Joseph Cotton) meeting Jennie, and the way she changes at each meeting, until he is able to solve her mystery.

503436,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00000ICYG,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 5]","Jennifer Jones (The Song of Bernadette) and Joseph Cotten star in Portrait of Jennie, a 1948 film that revolved around a painter's obsession with a beautiful, mysterious girl who seems to live more in the past than the present. Eben Adams (Cotten) is a washed-up painter on hard times and lacks inspiration until he meets Jennie (Jones) in a New York park. Jennie has an unusual way of speaking about past events as though they are current (referring to Germany's kaiser, and to theaters that had been demolished). Her fresh-faced beauty appeals to Adams, and Jennie makes the wish that he wait for her to grow up so that they can be together.Jennie's sporadic appearances allow time for Eben to work on other commissions, and to research Jennie more carefully by interviewing people who had worked with her parents (famous high-wire circus performers). Inevitably, dark truths are uncovered that disturb Eben's ""painting-perfect"" romance with the soft-spoken, beautiful Jennie. His portrait of her is a testament to his love and brings him artistic fame. Eben is also introduced to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore), a headstrong old maid who deals in paintings and who wants to see Eben produce something more spiritual. Other notable names include Lillian Gish as Mother Mary of Mercy, Cecil Kellaway as Matthews, and a young Nancy Davis Reagan in the art gallery.Joseph Cotten is an engaging narrator, and his growing dependence on Jennie and his depression over Jennie's long absences is utterly believable (if a bit melodramatic). Jennifer Jones has more to work with here than in her first Oscar-winning role as Bernadette, although seeing a well-proportioned twentysomething trying to portray prepubescent innocence was a little bit creepy (see: Judy Garland inThe Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)). Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically, so Jones was able to display a range of emotions, from a childhood crush to deeper musings on the nature of love and faith. Some of the secondary characters suffer from disappearing Irish accents; others shamelessly (sometimes woodenly) overact.The film follows several conventions of its time, and appears dated. The ""special effects"" are pretty standard; several scale models are used and a green tint is used for the final scenes. There are some beautifully dreamy shots of New York City, and the fabulous effect of having shots appear as though they were painted on canvas. The DVD transfer features some artifacts and print flaws. There are no extras to speak of. However, fans of time-travel romancesThe Ghost and Mrs. MuirandSomewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)will enjoy Portrait of Jennie, although the strongest film of this genre is undoubtedly The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Despite its shortcomings, Portrait of Jennie is a pretty decent love story.",4,Fans of Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Somewhere in Time will adore Portrait of Jennie,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2835,"['Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'star', 'Portrait', 'Jennie', '1948', 'film', 'revolved', 'painter', 'obsession', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'who', 'live', 'more', 'past', 'present', 'Eben', 'Adams', 'Cotten', 'washed-up', 'painter', 'hard', 'times', 'inspiration', 'Jennie', 'Jones', 'New', 'York', 'park', 'Jennie', 'unusual', 'way', 'speaking', 'past', 'events', 'are', 'current', 'referring', 'Germany', 'kaiser', 'theaters', 'had', 'been', 'demolished', 'fresh-faced', 'beauty', 'appeals', 'Adams', 'Jennie', 'wish', 'grow', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'together.Jennie', 'sporadic', 'appearances', 'allow', 'time', 'Eben', 'work', 'other', 'commissions', 'research', 'Jennie', 'more', 'carefully', 'interviewing', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'parents', 'famous', 'high-wire', 'circus', 'performers', 'Inevitably', 'dark', 'truths', 'are', 'uncovered', 'disturb', 'Eben', 'painting-perfect', 'romance', 'soft-spoken', 'beautiful', 'Jennie', 'portrait', 'testament', 'love', 'artistic', 'fame', 'Eben', 'also', 'introduced', 'Miss', 'Spinney', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'headstrong', 'old', 'maid', 'who', 'paintings', 'who', 'see', 'Eben', 'produce', 'something', 'more', 'spiritual', 'Other', 'notable', 'names', 'include', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'Mother', 'Mary', 'Mercy', 'Cecil', 'Kellaway', 'Matthews', 'young', 'Nancy', 'Davis', 'Reagan', 'art', 'gallery.Joseph', 'Cotten', 'engaging', 'narrator', 'growing', 'dependence', 'Jennie', 'depression', 'Jennie', 'long', 'absences', 'utterly', 'believable', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'more', 'work', 'here', 'first', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'Bernadette', 'seeing', 'well-proportioned', 'twentysomething', 'trying', 'portray', 'prepubescent', 'innocence', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'creepy', 'see', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'character', 'ages', 'rapidly', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'Jones', 'was', 'able', 'display', 'range', 'emotions', 'childhood', 'crush', 'deeper', 'musings', 'nature', 'love', 'faith', 'secondary', 'characters', 'suffer', 'disappearing', 'Irish', 'accents', 'others', 'shamelessly', 'sometimes', 'woodenly', 'overact.The', 'film', 'several', 'conventions', 'time', 'dated', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'several', 'scale', 'models', 'are', 'used', 'green', 'tint', 'used', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'dreamy', 'shots', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fabulous', 'effect', 'having', 'shots', 'appear', 'were', 'painted', 'canvas', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'artifacts', 'print', 'flaws', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'However', 'fans', 'time-travel', 'romancesThe', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'MuirandSomewhere', 'Time', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Portrait', 'Jennie', 'strongest', 'film', 'genre', 'undoubtedly', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'shortcomings', 'Portrait', 'Jennie', 'pretty', 'decent', 'love', 'story']",N/A
