While the male lead, one of the most impossibly handsome men alive, is naturally (she says with deep sarcasm) too timid to simply ask her out and instead engages in a series of silly machinations to be in her company.All in all a nice distraction for an hour or so, but one who wants to see superb romance onscreen might want to rent Casablanca.",3,Let's Face It Folks - Harlequin Romance DVD's Are Not High Art.,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,619,"['plot', 'ludicrious', 'dialogue', 'far', 'stellar', 'not', 'why', 'one', 'sort', 'thing', 'Naturally', 'dowdy', 'clothes', 'glasses', 'hair', 'bun', 'young', 'assistant', 'revealed', 'be', 'startling', 'beauty', 'figure', 'face', 'die', 'male', 'lead', 'one', 'most', 'impossibly', 'handsome', 'men', 'alive', 'naturally', 'deep', 'sarcasm', 'too', 'timid', 'simply', 'ask', 'out', 'instead', 'engages', 'series', 'silly', 'machinations', 'be', 'company.All', 'nice', 'distraction', 'hour', 'so', 'one', 'who', 'see', 'superb', 'romance', 'onscreen', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'Casablanca']",N/A

Until one day Dennys older brother (tall, dark) Regan appears in the office, determined to oversee the sale of the Montana Napa Hills vineyard. Regan immediately notices the fact that Claire is the driving force of his brothers' law firm, transforms Claire into a welldressed beauty (what some makeup and a new hairstyle can do!) and tells Claire of his plan to bring her and Denny together. For him it is business - he needs Denny distracted from estate agent Margot so he can convince Denny of his own ideas regarding the vineyard deal - but soon Regan is attracted to Claire himself.I really liked this romantic movie. It is based on a Diana Palmer movie, but is actually quite different from the book. I believe some DP-fans were outaged about it, but hey, it is a 1998 movie and the book is an oldfashioned 80's romance novel with the overbearing hero and the little mouse/secretary heroine. I for one am happy they made Claire a paralegal with a mind of her own. She is no little mouse, has humor and I liked the chemistry between Joely Collins (Claire) and Regan (a yummy Jonathan Cake). This is romance as you read it in a romance novel, so I recommend it to all romantics. It is a 'Harlequin presents' movie, and I think this one is the best!",5,Romance as I like it!,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,1421,"['Claire', 'Barnard', 'been', 'working', 'paralegal', 'Denny', 'Montana', 'four', 'years', 'playboy', 'lawyer', 'caters', 'whim', 'just', 'reliable', 'Claire', 'one', 'day', 'Dennys', 'older', 'brother', 'tall', 'dark', 'Regan', 'office', 'determined', 'oversee', 'sale', 'Montana', 'Napa', 'Hills', 'vineyard', 'Regan', 'immediately', 'fact', 'Claire', 'driving', 'force', 'brothers', 'law', 'firm', 'transforms', 'Claire', 'welldressed', 'beauty', 'what', 'makeup', 'new', 'hairstyle', 'can', 'do', 'Claire', 'plan', 'bring', 'Denny', 'together', 'business', 'Denny', 'distracted', 'estate', 'agent', 'Margot', 'can', 'convince', 'Denny', 'own', 'ideas', 'regarding', 'vineyard', 'deal', 'soon', 'Regan', 'attracted', 'Claire', 'himself.I', 'really', 'liked', 'romantic', 'movie', 'based', 'Diana', 'Palmer', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'different', 'book', 'believe', 'DP-fans', 'were', 'outaged', 'hey', '1998', 'movie', 'book', 'oldfashioned', '80', 'romance', 'novel', 'overbearing', 'hero', 'little', 'mouse/secretary', 'heroine', 'one', 'am', 'happy', 'made', 'Claire', 'paralegal', 'mind', 'own', 'little', 'mouse', 'humor', 'liked', 'chemistry', 'Joely', 'Collins', 'Claire', 'Regan', 'yummy', 'Jonathan', 'Cake', 'romance', 'read', 'romance', 'novel', 'recommend', 'romantics', ""'Harlequin"", 'presents', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'best']",N/A

866767,ANOBZWKE25SBY,B0006G0YC2,Tracy Vest,"[4, 6]","Diana Palmer's dismal and dated novel ""Diamond Girl"" is given a new lease on life in a filmed adaptation from Harlequin. About the only thing retained is the first names of a couple characters (the book is set in Atlanta; movie in San Francisco and Napa - but actually filmed in Toronto and South Africa of all places). ""Diamond Girl"" is actually a cute and somewhat romantic movie, but never rises to stellar status.Claire Bernard (Kenna Dean in the book) is the reliable secretary of lazy lawyer Denny Montana (Cole in the book). She is the obvious brains behind the operation, and when older brother Regan returns from London to assist in the sale of the family's Napa Vineyard, sees an ally in Claire, and hopes to hook her up with his brother so he can concentrate on the sale without Denny's sexy realtor girlfriend getting in the way. But first, she needs a makeover. Of course once Claire's makeover is complete, Regan is finding that he can't keep his hands off her. Featuring Dyan Cannon in the worst wig and more make up than a drag queen, the movie has some great one liners and bantering between the co-stars. That is when Regan is not so sanctimonious.",3,Improves on the novel,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1166,"['Diana', 'Palmer', 'dismal', 'dated', 'novel', 'Diamond', 'Girl', 'given', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'Harlequin', 'only', 'thing', 'retained', 'first', 'names', 'couple', 'characters', 'book', 'set', 'Atlanta', 'movie', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Napa', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Toronto', 'South', 'Africa', 'places', 'Diamond', 'Girl', 'actually', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'romantic', 'movie', 'never', 'stellar', 'status.Claire', 'Bernard', 'Kenna', 'Dean', 'book', 'reliable', 'secretary', 'lazy', 'lawyer', 'Denny', 'Montana', 'Cole', 'book', 'obvious', 'brains', 'operation', 'when', 'older', 'brother', 'Regan', 'London', 'assist', 'sale', 'family', 'Napa', 'Vineyard', 'ally', 'Claire', 'hook', 'up', 'brother', 'can', 'concentrate', 'sale', 'Denny', 'sexy', 'realtor', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'way', 'first', 'makeover', 'course', 'Claire', 'makeover', 'complete', 'Regan', 'finding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hands', 'off', 'Featuring', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'worst', 'wig', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'drag', 'queen', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'liners', 'bantering', 'co-stars', 'when', 'Regan', 'not', 'so', 'sanctimonious']",N/A
