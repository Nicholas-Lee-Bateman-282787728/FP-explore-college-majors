167220,AX93URVYM33YI,0962096334,"Arthur Sido ""But who are you, O man, to answe...","[35, 71]","I find it amazing that a church that refers to potential new converts as ""investigators"" insists that people stop investigating as soon as they hit the baptismal water. The children in Primary sing the song ""Search, ponder and pray"" but apparently only about Church approved materials. The details behind the so-called  ""Book of Abraham"" are fundamental in mormon beliefs. When viewed through mormon colored glasses, the ""Book of Abraham"" is yet another example of the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith. When approached from outside the fold, it can be seen as yet another example of a master [cheat]artist getting himself deeper into his lies. The mormon church spends millions on self-promoting videos designed to lure unsuspecting Christians and unchurched folks into their church. Yet dare raise questions about the authenticity of mormon writings and you get labeled with the same broad brush of ""anti-mormon"". If there is nothing to hide, this video should be informative anyway. If there is something to hide (and there certainly is from the mormon hierarchies perspective), anyone who testifies on the first Sunday of the month that they know Joseph Smith was a prophet owes it to themselves to see what sort of ""prophet"" he really was. The video itself lacks some of the slick marketing of mormon published works, but like many books that call mormonism out the material is more important than the package. If you are witnessing to mormons, you are more likely to get them to sit down and watch this video than to read a lengthy book on the topic. Makes an excellent gift for mormon friends and family, or to have handy when missionaries stop by and want to watch a mormon video with you.",4,An excellent documentary on a not so excellent prophet,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,1697,"['find', 'amazing', 'church', 'potential', 'new', 'converts', 'investigators', 'people', 'stop', 'investigating', 'as', 'soon', 'hit', 'baptismal', 'water', 'children', 'Primary', 'sing', 'song', 'Search', 'ponder', 'pray', 'apparently', 'only', 'Church', 'approved', 'materials', 'details', 'so-called', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'are', 'fundamental', 'mormon', 'beliefs', 'When', 'viewed', 'mormon', 'colored', 'glasses', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'yet', 'example', 'prophetic', 'calling', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'When', 'approached', 'fold', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'yet', 'example', 'master', '[', 'cheat', ']', 'artist', 'getting', 'deeper', 'lies', 'mormon', 'church', 'millions', 'self-promoting', 'videos', 'designed', 'lure', 'unsuspecting', 'Christians', 'unchurched', 'folks', 'church', 'dare', 'raise', 'questions', 'authenticity', 'mormon', 'writings', 'get', 'labeled', 'same', 'broad', 'brush', 'anti-mormon', 'nothing', 'hide', 'video', 'should', 'be', 'informative', 'anyway', 'something', 'hide', 'certainly', 'mormon', 'hierarchies', 'perspective', 'anyone', 'who', 'first', 'Sunday', 'month', 'know', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'was', 'prophet', 'see', 'what', 'sort', 'prophet', 'really', 'was', 'video', 'slick', 'marketing', 'mormon', 'published', 'works', 'many', 'books', 'call', 'mormonism', 'material', 'more', 'important', 'package', 'are', 'witnessing', 'mormons', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'get', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'video', 'read', 'lengthy', 'book', 'topic', 'Makes', 'excellent', 'gift', 'mormon', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'handy', 'when', 'missionaries', 'stop', 'want', 'watch', 'mormon', 'video']",N/A
167221,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0962096334,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 14]","This is an excellent documentary that displays a laudable respect for the Mormon faith even as it authoritatively puts the lie to Joseph Smith's translation of ""The Lost Book of Abraham.""  It may appear biased to some, but the relatively one-sided nature of the presentation is largely due to the fact that no Mormon scholars or church leaders would agree to even a mere interview on the subject.  That being the case, the producers went out of their way to ask a number of LDS members their opinions on the Book of Abraham.  That, to my mind, makes this documentary is as fair and balanced as it could possibly be.  While the presented findings raise crucial questions about the very foundations of the church Joseph Smith founded, the presentation never turns into an attack on the LDS faith itself.The more I learn about the Mormons, and Joseph Smith in particular, the more fascinated I become with the whole subject.  As an outside Christian looking in to the facts of the LDS Church, I am continually amazed that this religion survived the assassination of its prophet, Joseph Smith, as it has much in the nature of a cult of personality.  Even today, though, Mormonism is inextricably linked with its controversial founder.  If Smith's claims are untrue, the church has no legs to stand upon.  That is what makes this analysis of Smith's ""The Book of Abraham"" so intriguing.  Smith's ""translation"" of the Book of Mormon, while highly dubious, cannot be tested because the gold plates containing the original text were supposedly returned to the angel Moroni - and thus cannot be tested.  The same cannot be said of the Book of Abraham, as the original source - long thought to have been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 - is extant.  Authorities within the LDS church probably wish otherwise, as the true meaning of those documents greatly undermines Joseph Smith's integrity and has forced the church to backpedal mightily in the face of academic scrutiny.When a traveling salesman came through Kirtland, Ohio peddling several papyri from ancient Egypt (along with several authentic mummies), Joseph Smith could hardly dispute his ability to translate the ancient Egyptian writings (despite the fact that no scholar on the American continent could have done so at that time) - not after having translated the Book of Mormon from the ""Reformed Egyptian"" language.  Scrounging together the $2400 needed to purchase the salesman's ancient wares, he diligently went about said translation.  According to him, these papyri contained a lost book of wisdom written by the very hand of Abraham himself during his time in Egypt.  The Book of Abraham soon became a work of great importance in the Mormon religion and has remained so to this day.Smith's translation, particularly in terms of the copies of three plates included in The Book of Abraham, was called into question as soon as Egyptologists possessed the knowledge necessary for accurately interpreting the ancient hieroglyphics.  Now, numerous experts have had an opportunity to study the ancient fragments, and you'll hear from many of them in this documentary.  Smith's translation appears quite laughable and obviously wrong in just about every way possible according to all these experts.  The papyri contain fairly common funerary odes and have nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.  The truth has compelled some LDS members to leave the church (you'll meet one in this documentary), and no Mormon leader would even agree to appear in this evenhanded presentation of fact.There can be no question that this is an informative, very professional documentary which concentrates on the establishment of truth rather than a de facto attack on the Mormon religion.  The fact that no authority in the LDS Church would agree to defend Smith's translation speaks volumes as to the scholarly import of the transportation.",5,Authoritatively exposes Joseph Smith's The Book of Abraham as a fraud,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,3887,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'laudable', 'respect', 'Mormon', 'faith', 'even', 'authoritatively', 'lie', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'translation', 'Lost', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'may', 'appear', 'biased', 'relatively', 'one-sided', 'nature', 'presentation', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'Mormon', 'scholars', 'church', 'leaders', 'would', 'agree', 'even', 'mere', 'interview', 'subject', 'being', 'case', 'producers', 'went', 'way', 'ask', 'number', 'LDS', 'members', 'opinions', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'mind', 'documentary', 'fair', 'balanced', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'presented', 'findings', 'raise', 'crucial', 'questions', 'very', 'foundations', 'church', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'founded', 'presentation', 'never', 'attack', 'LDS', 'faith', 'itself.The', 'more', 'learn', 'Mormons', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'particular', 'more', 'fascinated', 'become', 'whole', 'subject', 'outside', 'Christian', 'looking', 'facts', 'LDS', 'Church', 'am', 'continually', 'amazed', 'religion', 'survived', 'assassination', 'prophet', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'much', 'nature', 'cult', 'personality', 'Even', 'today', 'though', 'Mormonism', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'controversial', 'founder', 'Smith', 'claims', 'are', 'untrue', 'church', 'legs', 'stand', 'upon', 'what', 'analysis', 'Smith', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'so', 'intriguing', 'Smith', 'translation', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'highly', 'dubious', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tested', 'gold', 'containing', 'original', 'text', 'were', 'supposedly', 'returned', 'angel', 'Moroni', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tested', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'original', 'source', 'long', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Great', 'Chicago', 'Fire', '1871', 'extant', 'Authorities', 'LDS', 'church', 'probably', 'wish', 'otherwise', 'true', 'meaning', 'documents', 'greatly', 'undermines', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'integrity', 'forced', 'church', 'backpedal', 'mightily', 'face', 'academic', 'scrutiny.When', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'came', 'Kirtland', 'Ohio', 'peddling', 'several', 'papyri', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'several', 'authentic', 'mummies', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'could', 'hardly', 'dispute', 'ability', 'translate', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'writings', 'fact', 'scholar', 'American', 'continent', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'time', 'not', 'having', 'translated', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'Reformed', 'Egyptian', 'language', 'Scrounging', 'together', '2400', 'needed', 'purchase', 'salesman', 'ancient', 'wares', 'diligently', 'went', 'said', 'translation', 'According', 'papyri', 'contained', 'lost', 'book', 'wisdom', 'written', 'very', 'hand', 'Abraham', 'time', 'Egypt', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'soon', 'became', 'work', 'great', 'importance', 'Mormon', 'religion', 'remained', 'so', 'day.Smith', 'translation', 'particularly', 'terms', 'copies', 'three', 'plates', 'included', 'Book', 'Abraham', 'was', 'called', 'question', 'as', 'soon', 'Egyptologists', 'possessed', 'knowledge', 'necessary', 'accurately', 'interpreting', 'ancient', 'hieroglyphics', 'Now', 'numerous', 'experts', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'study', 'ancient', 'fragments', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'many', 'documentary', 'Smith', 'translation', 'quite', 'laughable', 'obviously', 'wrong', 'just', 'way', 'possible', 'according', 'experts', 'papyri', 'contain', 'fairly', 'common', 'funerary', 'odes', 'have', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'Abraham', 'truth', 'compelled', 'LDS', 'members', 'leave', 'church', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'one', 'documentary', 'Mormon', 'leader', 'would', 'even', 'agree', 'appear', 'evenhanded', 'presentation', 'fact.There', 'can', 'be', 'question', 'informative', 'very', 'professional', 'documentary', 'establishment', 'truth', 'rather', 'de', 'facto', 'attack', 'Mormon', 'religion', 'fact', 'authority', 'LDS', 'Church', 'would', 'agree', 'defend', 'Smith', 'translation', 'volumes', 'scholarly', 'import', 'transportation']",N/A
167222,A2O1FLF439GX3P,0962096334,E. Johnson,"[72, 117]","Produced in a History Channel format, this video is excellent because it relies on factual history to report the events that led to the publication of the Book of Abraham in the LDS scripture Pearl of Great Price. The question is this: If Joseph Smith was truly a prophet of God, and if he accurately translated the Book of Mormon plates into English, then shouldn't he have had the ability to take the writing of the patriarch Abraham and accurately translate it into English as well? However, as the video points out, the Book of Abraham is nothing more than common funeral papyrii that was sold to Smith by a traveling salesman. With the science of Egyptology in its infancy at that time, Smith was able to convince his people that this papyrus had been produced by Abraham himself. Although the scroll was lost for a century, it was uncovered in the 1960s and given back to the LDS Church. For the first time, this papyrus could be studied in light of the abundance of work that had been done in the field of Egyptology. In effect, the truth about Joseph Smith has been revealed.All in all, this video is interesting to watch and accurate in its analysis. Although it may cause some honest Latter-day Saints some sleepness nights, grabbing ahold of truth is the most important thing anyone can do. I challenge every Latter-day Saint to see this video for him/herself and then weigh the evidence.
