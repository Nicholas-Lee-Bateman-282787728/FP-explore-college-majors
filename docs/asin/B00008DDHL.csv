Spinal Tap's ""Free Form Jazz Odyssey"" sounded better than parts of this DVD. The transitions between the songs are sloppy and fumbling, West keeps fiddling with his settings on his guitar which he seemed to have problems with. This is probably a matter of taste, but I didn't like Richie Scarlett's bass playing on most of the set. The great Mountain comes off like a bar band not the great powerhouse that they once were.That being said, Leslie is in fine voice on the set and he can still scratch out some sparks. I wish he would go back to his signature sound though. He has mucked it up quite a bit.The real crime here is that the group put this thing out. It's a sub par product, that will probably only be watched once by Mountain fans (of which I am one).

I own the LESLIE WEST/MOUNTAIN catalog on vinyl and CD.  I bought this DVD and have watched it only once.  LESLIE WEST AND MOUNTAIN rock the Mystic Club in Petaluma California.  The scrapbook section with the story of MOUNTAIN'S fourth gig at WOODSTOCK, the story of FELIX PAPPALARDI and the story of MISSISSIPPI QUEEN add to the music included on this disc.  The sound is excellent.  The camera work is outstanding. Songs included on the DVD are BLOOD OF THE SUN, FOR YASGUR'S FARM, NEVER IN MY LIFE, THEME FROM AN IMAGINARY WESTERN and NANTUCKET SLEIGHRIDE along with CROSSROADS and some new songs from LESLIE WEST.  CORKY LAING is one of rock's greatest drummers. Bass guitar is provided by RICHIE SCARLET and he is in excellent form.

738303,A3EZ2PLA8AFPIF,B00008DDHL,"""The Woj""","[15, 20]","I really, really wanted to enjoy this dvd; but half way thru the third song I found myself hitting the fast forward button...over & over.  The band looks old and they play old.  There is very little energy in the performance other than bassist Ritchie Scarlett performing a few ""Townshend"" windmills on his bass  (Scarlett really looks out of place in this band).  You really can't blame the band; there is only about 100 people in the audience and they all look like they carry AARP cards.Being a guitar player and a huge  fan of Mountain, I was most disappointed in West's guitar.  He plays thru so many guitar effects, it diminishes his skills and sounds awful. There is no trace whatsoever of his classic 70's tone & vibrato.  I wonder why he's ""hiding"" his guitar playing behind so many electronic pedals (he often comes off sounding like a poor man's Alex Lifeson).  If you close your eyes thru the concert and just listen, the band sounds like a unrehearsed version of Rush.  The instrumental section of ""Nantucket Sleighride"" is almost unlistenable with Laing's aging drum kit barely holding the band together.  The vintage footage is the only section worth a dang.  Great shots of the band (mostly still photos) and a few amusing anecdotes from Corky & Leslie.  When you here the power of the original ""Mississippi Queen"", it makes the concert portion ever more disappointing.  Unfortunately the vintage section only runs about 15 minutes.  All in all a purchase for a die-hard Mountain fan only.
