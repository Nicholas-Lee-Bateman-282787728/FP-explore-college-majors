1637854,A1FMLJYV0WIX55,B00BR7XRYG,"Chris C. ""CCARNI""","[2, 2]","From the director/writer who brought us ""Identity Theft"", James Ward has done it again! Using his ""body-switch"" playbook, he has upted the antie with another winner! Increased production values, more locations, and a larger cast makes Ward's latest indie movie move into the world of theatrical-looking releases. His efforts of writing are never condescending or blatantly crass, going for the ""shock value"" most indie film makers go for these days. Instead, Ward carefully crafts his movie with an obviously eye for flair and comedy without having to stoop to the lowest common demoninator of F-bombs, gratutious sex, or 'dick jokes'. ""The Hit Girl"", although a movie about an assassin, has so little blood that it reminded me of an early John Carpenter and his movies. This is an enjoyable movie that you can easily see that the actors were having as much fun making as was the crew. And best of all, the acting is a cut above the usual smaller indie films which pull acting talent wherever and whenever they can find it. Ward cast many of Ventura County's theater people in his movie for his talent pool and it shows on screen...another feather in his resource cap.

This is a fun romp from beginning to end. The story is engaging, the people (except, of course, the bad guys) likeable, the dialogue funny and surprising and the ending was superb. This was worth my time to watch, and I'll enjoy sitting through it again.

An odd mix of tough guy,teenage,slapstick and a little crude humor this is just one funny ride.acting and sets were good,the sound track seemed too be a bit off had to adjust volume for action scenes and some talking(if was possible id give it 4.5 for this).Warning may have spoilers.The movie in a nutshell -Bill is a hit man ,who takes a job in his old  neighborhood.He decides too visit  his sister and his niece who still live there.His sister's work allows her too bring home museum .pieces,one of which is a statue of a woman holding scales.Bill is talked into babysitting his movie buff niece ,when his sister is called into  work over night. At one point they end up in the same room as the figure.He leans on it and says he'd rather have the problems of a teenage girl as opposed too his own.From going too bed 44 yr old man to waking up 14 yr old girl.Life or is it magic has thrown Bill now dubbed Jessica -quite a large curve .But the job must get done. So begins training ,quite humorously too as those manly heavy dumbbells along with  those big guns,aren't going too cut it anymore.Not when his new smaller body can be pushed around by bigger girls.Its the smaller dumbbells,and guns for this kid.Adding too this is learning new life lessons from other girls,niece and his sister. Can she get the job done? Will she go back too normal?

The Hit Girl is a surprisingly well-rounded effort; the script is fresh and entertaining; the characters are extremely likable; the acting is extremely well done, and the cinematography is pretty darn seamless - - nothing jarring to take you out of the moment while watching.  I hate to sound like a skeptic by using a word like ""surprisingly"", but the quality of this movie is much more ""mature"" than I was anticipating.  I am willing to compare it to Robert Rodriguez' first effort, El Mariachi, which was more low-budget-looking than The Hit Girl, in my opinion.I am the mother of 4, but my kids are all >13+ yrs now, so this movie was appropriate for them all to enjoy.  No gratuitous language, some violence (after all, it is about a hitman, errr, hit girl!), and some fairly tame strip club action, but overall a movie that parents can enjoy with their teens.  There is plenty of humor, subtle humor, not in your face farce humor.  I am a sucker for strong female characters who are forced by circumstances beyond their control to conquer their fear and discomfort in order to defend and protect others (a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and I have to say, the characters of the hit girl and the niece were strongly written to fit that bill.  As the mom of girls, I really appreciate that!  I highly recommend The Hit Girl!",5,Three cheers for The Hit Girl!!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1435,"['love', 'supporting', 'indie-anything', 'endeavor', 'indie', 'film', 'maker', 'James', 'Ward', 'really', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'surprisingly', 'well-rounded', 'effort', 'script', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'likable', 'acting', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'pretty', 'darn', 'seamless', 'nothing', 'jarring', 'take', 'moment', 'watching', 'hate', 'sound', 'skeptic', 'using', 'word', 'surprisingly', 'quality', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'was', 'anticipating', 'am', 'willing', 'compare', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'first', 'effort', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'was', 'more', 'low-budget-looking', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'opinion.I', 'am', 'mother', '4', 'kids', 'are', '13+', 'yrs', 'now', 'movie', 'was', 'appropriate', 'enjoy', 'gratuitous', 'language', 'violence', 'hitman', 'errr', 'hit', 'girl', 'fairly', 'tame', 'strip', 'club', 'action', 'movie', 'parents', 'can', 'enjoy', 'teens', 'plenty', 'humor', 'subtle', 'humor', 'not', 'face', 'farce', 'humor', 'am', 'sucker', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'control', 'conquer', 'fear', 'discomfort', 'order', 'defend', 'protect', 'others', 'la', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'have', 'say', 'characters', 'hit', 'girl', 'niece', 'were', 'strongly', 'written', 'fit', 'bill', 'mom', 'girls', 'really', 'appreciate', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Hit', 'Girl']",The Hit Girl
