It has familiar famous actors, a good script, nice production values, beautiful jungle locations and more. A pilot (Richard Tyson) who specializes in risky repossession jobs of planes, even in other countries, is hired by a bitter enemy to rescue his missionary daughter (Bobbie Phillips) who is serving a rural village in South America. She is a part of the Billy Graham Samaritan program that serves villages with medial and religious needs, when local drug lord kidnap the men of the village for forced labor in their fields. Complicating things in the rescue is the fact that she does not to get rescued, unless all the villagers are rescued as well. And she is the pilots ex-girlfriend.Filmed on location in Puerto Rico. Several cameos including Skip Heizek, who is the past of Calvary Chapel Church in New Mexico.The movie is inspiring.This is part of the Billy Graham Presents DVD series, which so far have been great. Other good films in the series include ""Road to Redemption"" a comedy, ""the Climb"" action movie, ""Something to Sing About"", and an older move called ""The Hiding Place"" about the Holocaust.
