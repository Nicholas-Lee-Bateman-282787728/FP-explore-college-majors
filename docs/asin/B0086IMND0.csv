The American citizenry had every right to be legitimately frightened of Communism after the Soviet Union obtained nuclear technology and a war being conducted in Korea.  That said ""My Son John"" comes off as something of a dated diatribe.  Robert Walker who plays a government official accused of Communist sympathies died during the production of the film.  His passing probably caused a number of rewrites which gives the film something of an unwieldy feel.  In the scenes Walker is in he is mesmerizing giving a reassuring face to a doctrine that threatened so many peoples core belief systems.  The film is somewhat hindered by over the top performances by Dean Jagger and notably Helen Hayes as Walker's god fearing parents.

1547190,A5IPEZBOFCV5Q,B0086IMND0,James R. Morrella,"[0, 0]","This was nominated for Story for an Oscar. McCary wrote and directed this film (Going My Way, etc.). As one can expect Helen Hayes dominates this cast that included Van Heflin, Dean Jagger and Robert Walker Sr. (his last film before his early death). Walker plays the older son of a middle class family. He is brilliant and becomes a famous scholar. His mother (played by Hayes) is a liberal woman, while his father (played by Dean Jagger) is a High School teacher and patriot. His two younger brothers have just shipped out to Korea. While at college Walker becomes enthralled by a communist professor and joins the Party. He then becomes involved in espionage. He lies to his mother about his affiliation, but she eventually discerns his real intentions.The dialogue is outstanding and takes this film to the highest level as Walker character has to fight a personal battle over the view that the end justifies the means. His family are devout Catholics and this enters into the discussion. I will not expose what he chooses, but the ending is really moving. I was very surprised at just how well this film played out. It also brought back memories of the 1950's when I was a young child.",5,MY SON JOHN,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,1190,"['was', 'nominated', 'Story', 'Oscar', 'McCary', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', 'etc.', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'cast', 'included', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'Sr.', 'last', 'film', 'early', 'death', 'Walker', 'older', 'son', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'brilliant', 'famous', 'scholar', 'mother', 'played', 'Hayes', 'liberal', 'woman', 'father', 'played', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'High', 'School', 'teacher', 'patriot', 'two', 'younger', 'brothers', 'have', 'just', 'shipped', 'out', 'Korea', 'college', 'Walker', 'enthralled', 'communist', 'professor', 'Party', 'then', 'involved', 'espionage', 'mother', 'affiliation', 'eventually', 'real', 'intentions.The', 'dialogue', 'outstanding', 'film', 'highest', 'level', 'Walker', 'character', 'fight', 'personal', 'battle', 'view', 'end', 'means', 'family', 'are', 'Catholics', 'enters', 'discussion', 'will', 'not', 'expose', 'what', 'ending', 'really', 'moving', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'also', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', '1950', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'child']",N/A

1547193,A28V2CQXWPXIR0,B0086IMND0,Kert Conrad,"[16, 16]","One of the best things to happen in the world of home video in recent days has been Paramount releasing a virtual explosion of classic titles on both Blu-ray and DVD under the Olive Films label.  The stellar releases continue with MY SON JOHN, an anti-Communist picture from the early fifties that's part political thriller and part family drama, featuring an outstanding cast that includes Helen Hayes, Dean Jagger, Van Heflin and, in his final screen appearance (he died during the film's production), the great Robert Walker.The story concerns some proudly patriotic and religious parents (Hayes and Jagger) who begin to have suspicions that their oldest son (Walker) is a Communist.  Walker gives a fascinating performance, similar to his role in Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN but this time giving his character a kind of scoffing arrogance to go along with his sinister charm.  You get the feeling that this guy is so much smarter than everyone else that he finds their beliefs and traditions rather amusing.Script-wise, the film has some weaknesses.  There seems to be a conscious effort to avoid any specific explanations of what's going on regarding unlawful activities: we never really learn exactly what John has done or get any insight into his political philosophy other than a few vague inferences here and there.  One keeps hoping that John and his father will have a meaningful conversation about the relative merits of communism versus democracy, but it doesn't happen.  This is one case in which some over-the-top patriotism would have added some punch to the story.  Further, the fact that Robert Walker died before the film was completed (the shots of him in the last part of the movie are taken from STRANGERS ON A TRAIN) leads to a somewhat unsatisfying ending.Script problems aside, MY SON JOHN is one of those movies that can be appreciated both as a drama and as a historical document in the sense that it's very much a product of the time in which it was produced.  Admittedly, it's not for the casual viewer - some people would undoubtedly find it too long and overly talky.  It's not as entertaining as THE RED MENACE or as well done as I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE FBI.  However, if you're someone who enjoys watching fine actors and loves films that reflect a particular period in history, MY SON JOHN is a thought-provoking movie that will stay in your memory long after you've seen it.",4,Watch Out For That First Son...,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2416,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'happen', 'world', 'home', 'video', 'recent', 'days', 'been', 'Paramount', 'releasing', 'virtual', 'explosion', 'classic', 'titles', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'Olive', 'Films', 'label', 'stellar', 'releases', 'continue', 'MY', 'SON', 'JOHN', 'anti-Communist', 'picture', 'early', 'fifties', 'part', 'political', 'thriller', 'part', 'family', 'drama', 'featuring', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'final', 'screen', 'appearance', 'died', 'film', 'production', 'great', 'Robert', 'Walker.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'proudly', 'patriotic', 'religious', 'parents', 'Hayes', 'Jagger', 'who', 'begin', 'have', 'suspicions', 'oldest', 'son', 'Walker', 'Communist', 'Walker', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'similar', 'role', 'Hitchcock', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'time', 'giving', 'character', 'kind', 'scoffing', 'arrogance', 'go', 'along', 'sinister', 'charm', 'get', 'feeling', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'else', 'beliefs', 'traditions', 'rather', 'amusing.Script-wise', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'be', 'conscious', 'effort', 'avoid', 'specific', 'explanations', 'what', 'going', 'regarding', 'unlawful', 'activities', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'exactly', 'what', 'John', 'done', 'get', 'insight', 'political', 'philosophy', 'other', 'few', 'vague', 'inferences', 'here', 'there', 'One', 'hoping', 'John', 'father', 'will', 'have', 'meaningful', 'conversation', 'relative', 'merits', 'communism', 'versus', 'democracy', ""n't"", 'happen', 'one', 'case', 'over-the-top', 'patriotism', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'punch', 'story', 'Further', 'fact', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'died', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'shots', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'taken', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'ending.Script', 'problems', 'aside', 'MY', 'SON', 'JOHN', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'drama', 'historical', 'document', 'sense', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'time', 'was', 'produced', 'Admittedly', 'not', 'casual', 'viewer', 'people', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'find', 'too', 'long', 'overly', 'talky', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'THE', 'RED', 'MENACE', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'WAS', 'COMMUNIST', 'THE', 'FBI', 'However', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'watching', 'fine', 'actors', 'loves', 'films', 'reflect', 'particular', 'period', 'history', 'MY', 'SON', 'JOHN', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'memory', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

1547195,A11CYNCILLSRZ8,B0086IMND0,Robert L. Anderson,"[5, 6]","I have just recieved and watched the Blu-ray version of ""My Son John"".. I'de seen it when I was a teen ager in the 50's and I thought it was pretty slow, but interesting. I went to see it because of Robert Walker who had been MGM'S Golden Boy next door. He was such a sweet charming guy in those Golden Age of MGM films. But of course Walker never got a chance to really act until he got from beneath MGM's grasp. Like he did in Hitchcock's ""Strangers On A Train"". And I don't believe that Leo McCarey produced or directed anything quite like this either. Poor Robert Walker had a sad personal life and I believe it showed in his face in this film. And it's a shame that he passed away, because he had just proven what a great actor he really was. But I don't believe they had the help back in the early 50's that they do now. Help that may have saved Robert Walker. Helen Hayes was also very good, but I thought that half her scenes were drawn out too long and very overacted. (excuse me Helen Hayes fans, but that's the way I saw it)I know they probably didn't know really how to deal with communism on film 'back in the day', but some of the scenes were very vague. And like Kurt Corbin said in his review that it was hard to catch onto what Robert Walker's character ""John"" was really up to. And I really couldn't really tell if he was 'all that bad'. Because my open-mind is set in the new millennium, not in the early 50's. What was John really up to?What were the unlawful activities? Yes it was rather vague. But I do remember as a child and teenager the sence of patriotism all around me. I sort of miss that 'long ago feeling'. I'm afraid with all that's going on today people don't know what to believe anymore and that's a damn shame. Dean Jagger was also very stong as a real old fashioned patriot. God bless his character. And I remember many like that. Oh yeah. So I say this is 'a time capsule of the way people thought back in the day. And God bless each and every one of them.
