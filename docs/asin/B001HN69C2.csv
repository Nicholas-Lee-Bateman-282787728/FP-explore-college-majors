This was a hard act to do and the movie did a rather faithful and strong capturing of the spirit of the book if not a play-by-play retelling of it. Having said that, it's also worth commending the filmmakers on the smoothness with which they handled the disappearance and reappearance of the main character and the CGI that was involved with him dissipating into thin air during his time travels. Eric Bana does justice to Henry, whereas Ron Livingston is perfectly cast in the role of Gomez, Henry's friend and Claire's ""protector"" (in the book Gomez is obsessed with Claire and wished to spend the rest of his life with her, whereas in the movie his relationship isn't as clearly defined - he is mostly a concerned friend). It's sad that this movie was shelved for so long and it's very reassuring to see it do well at the box office (so far the movie has grossed about $30 million domestically and the theater I went to tonight was sold out for the 8 pm showing - always a good sign for a film).Disclamer: It's also worth noting that as a huge fan of the book, my opinion about this movie is rather skewed - I tend to fill in the gaps and care about the characters because the book had done a great job of developing the characters. The movie, however, hardly makes the characters relateable, and someone who sees the movie without having the book as the plot background, might find the Claire-Henry relationship a bit offputting.",4,a fitting adaptation of a superb novel,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,1489,"['good', 'adaptation', 'one', 'best', 'books', 'time', 'was', 'hard', 'act', 'do', 'movie', 'did', 'rather', 'faithful', 'strong', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'book', 'not', 'play-by-play', 'retelling', 'Having', 'said', 'also', 'worth', 'commending', 'filmmakers', 'smoothness', 'handled', 'disappearance', 'reappearance', 'main', 'character', 'CGI', 'was', 'involved', 'dissipating', 'thin', 'air', 'time', 'travels', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'justice', 'Henry', 'whereas', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'Gomez', 'Henry', 'friend', 'Claire', 'protector', 'book', 'Gomez', 'obsessed', 'Claire', 'wished', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'whereas', 'movie', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'defined', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'friend', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'shelved', 'so', 'long', 'very', 'reassuring', 'see', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'far', 'movie', 'grossed', '30', 'million', 'domestically', 'theater', 'went', 'tonight', 'was', 'sold', 'out', '8', 'pm', 'showing', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'film', '.Disclamer', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'opinion', 'movie', 'rather', 'skewed', 'tend', 'fill', 'gaps', 'care', 'characters', 'book', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'developing', 'characters', 'movie', 'however', 'hardly', 'characters', 'relateable', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'having', 'book', 'plot', 'background', 'might', 'find', 'Claire-Henry', 'relationship', 'bit', 'offputting']",N/A

Reading it, I was able to suspend my disbelief about the plot and just appreciate the touching love affair at the center of the novel.Unfortunately, the silliness at the heart of the novel was accentuated in the movie and I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Many movies fail to live up to their literary origins but this went a step further -- it made me like the book less than I had before seeing the film.Things that I glossed over in the book -- the way the protagonist loses all his clothes whenever he time travels -- now seemed ludicrous. The creepy nature of the relationship between the two lovers who meet when he's a grown man and she's a little girl, was accentuated by seeing them together on the screen.The film stays pretty true to the book except in its final scene, but the growing, brooding threat that hung over the latter pages of the book is absent here.

1201803,A24PTVSZSM8968,B001HN69C2,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","First of all, I will say that this movie is definitely something different. Obviously it's supposed to be a love story of sorts, but it has such a different background with the time travel premise that it offers something a little different which makes for an interesting viewing experience. As many have pointed out, the time travel aspect is very implausible and not very well explained. You just have to sort of accept it as a premise for the film. The movie begins with great romantic enthusiasm which eventually goes through periods of great frustration and ends with feelings of reluctant acceptance. There were two things that made the movie less than five stars for me. First of all, I think the time travel aspect was quite underdeveloped both in the explanation of it and in the episodes themselves. They seem to happen quickly without much development of what happens during them. Second, I think a number of possibilities go undeveloped such as the potential of changing the future. This is the type of movie in which you expect the happy ending to involve everyone being together in the end through some twist, but it doesn't quite work out that way. In any case, this movie is worth checking out because it's so different.

1201804,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001HN69C2,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","The novel by which `The Time Traveler's Wife' is adapted is a lengthy one.  The film is barely over an hour and a half.  This is a problem.  The problem is that, with such a uniquely engaging prose, `The Time Traveler's Wife' needed that extra time to develop its characters and their relationships in order for us, the audience, to care.  When all was said and done, I simply didn't care enough.The film tells the story of Henry, a man who has a rare genetic disorder that causes him to time travel without warning.  He can't control it, and this causes him to disappear and reappear at different stages of his own life.  The film follows his love affair with Clare, a beautiful young woman who falls in love with Henry at the very moment she meets him, when she is only six years old.  She grows up fantasizing about him (or so we are told) and when she finally has him all to herself she realizes that she has to share him with his disease, waiting for him to reappear in her life at the `right' moments.  They love one another, but there are always strains to those affections.Like I said, the concept here is rather engaging.  I actually LOVE the idea.  I have yet to read the novel, but I gather that it is very good and I am intrigued to read it since if the concept is done justice (and given room to develop) then it should prove itself marvelously entertaining.  But that is the main root of this film's problems.  Some ideas and or stories are not suited for the big-screen.  You simply cannot establish in an hour and half the kind of love needed to sustain this film.  The script is lazy and clich&eacute;d instead of rich and meaningful.  The editing is a problem for it leaves much to be desired, giving us scenarios that don't quite finish themselves.  We are always waiting for the film to come to life.  The dialog becomes stilted; the performances become generalizations as apposed to real, living, breathing people.This film needed to be something more epic in scope.  It becomes hollow because of lack of depth and structure.  While it is, at times, beautiful and even haunting visually, the impact of this film wares off very quickly.Personally I think this film would have been better suited as a mini-series.  Forget the time restraints of a motion picture (although some films transcend those restraints by pushing the envelope), give me six weeks of two-hour segments.  That will flesh out this story.  That will make Henry and Clare real to the viewer.  That will prove their love and cause us to fall head over heals for them as well.  This film just fails to deliver any emotional relevancy, and because of that it fails; period.",2,It feels rather empty...,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2658,"['novel', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'adapted', 'lengthy', 'one', 'film', 'barely', 'hour', 'half', 'problem', 'problem', 'uniquely', 'engaging', 'prose', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'needed', 'extra', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationships', 'order', 'audience', 'care', 'When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough.The', 'film', 'story', 'Henry', 'man', 'who', 'rare', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'time', 'travel', 'warning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'disappear', 'reappear', 'different', 'stages', 'own', 'life', 'film', 'love', 'affair', 'Clare', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'Henry', 'very', 'moment', 'when', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'fantasizing', 'so', 'are', 'told', 'when', 'finally', 'herself', 'share', 'disease', 'waiting', 'reappear', 'life', 'right', 'moments', 'love', 'one', 'are', 'always', 'strains', 'said', 'concept', 'here', 'rather', 'engaging', 'actually', 'LOVE', 'idea', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'gather', 'very', 'good', 'am', 'intrigued', 'read', 'concept', 'done', 'justice', 'given', 'room', 'develop', 'then', 'should', 'prove', 'marvelously', 'entertaining', 'main', 'root', 'film', 'problems', 'ideas', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'suited', 'big-screen', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'establish', 'hour', 'kind', 'love', 'needed', 'sustain', 'film', 'script', 'lazy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'instead', 'rich', 'meaningful', 'editing', 'problem', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'giving', 'scenarios', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'finish', 'are', 'always', 'waiting', 'film', 'come', 'life', 'dialog', 'stilted', 'performances', 'become', 'generalizations', 'apposed', 'real', 'living', 'breathing', 'people.This', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'epic', 'scope', 'hollow', 'lack', 'depth', 'structure', 'times', 'beautiful', 'even', 'haunting', 'visually', 'impact', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'quickly.Personally', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'mini-series', 'Forget', 'time', 'restraints', 'motion', 'picture', 'films', 'transcend', 'restraints', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'give', 'six', 'weeks', 'two-hour', 'segments', 'will', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'Henry', 'Clare', 'real', 'viewer', 'will', 'prove', 'love', 'cause', 'fall', 'head', 'heals', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'deliver', 'emotional', 'relevancy', 'period']",N/A

Oh boy- I'll never forget the experience!Ever wonder what would happen if you had a boyfriend or girlfriend that, for some unexplainable and confusing reason, just disappeared at random?  Let's say from the time you were a little boy or girl you were led to believe that your future girlfriend or boyfriend disappearing and reappearing whenever is totally normal?Wouldn't this actually get *really* annoying after a while?  Wouldn't it start becoming more of an inconvenience as you plan events ahead of time and then they get abruptly cancelled all because your girlfriend or boyfriend simply disappeared without any kind of warning?  It SHOULD get annoying.Apparently however, according to the writers who came up with such a concept, it's actually adorable.  At least, that's what we're led to believe during the first half of the film.  That it's every girls fantasy.Eventually the girlfriend gets fed up with her boyfriends frequent little inconvenient disappearing act when she becomes pregnant.  Then things change a lot.  ""No more disappearing acts for you, Mr. Boyfriend!  It's time to raise a baby together"" cries the girlfriend.  Okay so the events don't unravel *quite* so hilariously, but as a viewer sitting there trying to make any logical sense out of time travelling, well, it only seems normal to find some kind of humor in something so silly and unbelievable.The storyline jumps through numerous events throughout the girlfriend and boyfriends lives, and it even gets insanely confusing whenever you see a grown man talking to his girlfriend when she's still a *child*.  Then throw in numerous events involving the daughter and the disappearing mans own mother and... WOW, haha (hence my title!).What's particularly interesting about the whole thing is how the film doesn't really focus on one specific genre- it's funny at times, filled with drama elements other times, and get THIS- there's even a subtle element of horror!  Yes it's true.  This is because quite often you will actually get to see the boyfriend disappear before your very eyes.  There's a couple other scenes that really DID mess with my head that only the most effective horror storylines are capable of doing.  Weird and shocking.The humor comes in the way of where the boyfriend will turn up next (and naked) whenever he disappears.Overall, you have to be somewhat patient, understanding and perhaps a little bit bonkers to really fall in love with a movie like this.

1201817,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B001HN69C2,Bill Garrison,"[3, 6]","In reviewing the Time Traveler's Wife, you have to address two types of viewers, people who have never read the book, and the passionate, opinionated fans who have read the bestselling novel that the movie is based on. If you have read the book, you definitely will be dissapointed in the movie. The book is so in depth and contains so many layers and different characters that it is impossible to include it all in one normal length movie. But on its own, the movie is pretty good.I have read the book and found the movie quite enjoyable. Eric Bana is perfect as Henry DeTamble, the man suffering from chrono-displacement disorder which causes him to time travel on a whim. The beautiful Rachel McAdams is Clair Abshire, the woman destined to love Henry.There is good chemistry between the pair as the film moves quickly to their marriage and the difficulties they face as they try to live a life when Henry may have knowledge about their future that could be painful. If you haven't read the book, this is a really good movie. I don't think the time travel elements are too confusing, and the movie is filled with great acting and emotional scenes (Alba, Henry and his mom.)One thing the movie misses by skipping over so many parts is the true characterization of Henry and Claire. The movie never really gives us a picture of the two other than their lives revolving around Henry's condition. We don't learn about their careers, or how Henry developed a great relationship with Claire as a child and a teenager.As with all novel adaptations, the film version leaves a lot out.

1201823,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B001HN69C2,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","""The Time Traveler's Wife"" takes a simple approach to a time travel gimmick, and uses it to explore a very unique character study. Essentially, a boy learns that he travels in time when an older version of himself shows up at a traumatic moment to explain to him what is going on. Through his life, he is unable to control the mechanism of his time trips, which happen at random and often inconvenient moments.In the process, as a young man our time traveling hero meets a little girl on a solo picnic. Over the years of her childhood and teenage years he appears several times, and she of course develops a crush on him. When they finally encounter each other as young adults of about the same age, they fall in love and marry. The movie's mechanism has two characters encountering each other almost randomly at various ages of the two people. This is a unique concept and was very interesting.Complexities arise when it turns out that his time traveling curse is of genetic origin, and attempts at having a child result in unexplained miscarriages, and concomitant pressure on their relationship.I found this to be a very sweet story. It promotes the interest of the viewer without the overly dramatic devices that most movies have to resort to. Tension is provided almost solely by the consequences of unexpected time travel incidents, rather than through character conflict. Although there is some character conflict, it is really minimal. There is a very simple story, a very simple romantic relationship, yet a very compelling movie.",4,"Not really much sci fi, but a solid character study romance",1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,1539,"['Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'simple', 'approach', 'time', 'travel', 'gimmick', 'explore', 'very', 'unique', 'character', 'study', 'Essentially', 'boy', 'time', 'when', 'older', 'version', 'up', 'traumatic', 'moment', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'unable', 'control', 'mechanism', 'time', 'trips', 'happen', 'random', 'often', 'inconvenient', 'process', 'young', 'man', 'time', 'traveling', 'hero', 'little', 'girl', 'solo', 'picnic', 'years', 'childhood', 'teenage', 'years', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'crush', 'When', 'finally', 'encounter', 'other', 'young', 'adults', 'same', 'age', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'movie', 'mechanism', 'two', 'characters', 'encountering', 'other', 'almost', 'randomly', 'various', 'ages', 'two', 'people', 'unique', 'concept', 'was', 'very', 'interesting.Complexities', 'arise', 'when', 'out', 'time', 'traveling', 'curse', 'genetic', 'origin', 'attempts', 'having', 'child', 'result', 'unexplained', 'miscarriages', 'concomitant', 'pressure', 'relationship.I', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'sweet', 'story', 'interest', 'viewer', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'devices', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'resort', 'Tension', 'provided', 'almost', 'solely', 'consequences', 'unexpected', 'time', 'travel', 'incidents', 'rather', 'character', 'conflict', 'character', 'conflict', 'really', 'minimal', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'very', 'compelling', 'movie']",N/A

By the time I got around to wanting to see it in theaters, it was already gone. It's really a shame because it's a wonderfully crafted love story, using a touch of sci-fi as a backdrop for the plot. I'm a guy and don't normally go for love stories. Without the sci-fi angle, I probably would not have gone for this film. I like hard science fiction, space battles, and aliens, but most of all, I like an interestingly told story. Here you have a really well told story with likable and implausibly good-looking characters. Your Mrs. might not want to watchBattle: Los Angeleswith you, but chances are she'll like TTTW. For her, there's the bare-butted Eric Bana (Henry), who arrives naked with each jump. For him, there's the gorgeous Rachael McAdams, who sadly, we do not see in extended stretches of undress.The premise is simple. Because of a genetic anomaly, Henry jumps uncontrollably through time, along the timeline of his life. He meets people in his past and sometimes himself, but he can't change the past. Just like other time travel movies, don't think too much about paradoxes, contradictions, and logic bombs. If you do, you'll have a horrible time. Just go with it and concentrate on the love story instead. The chemistry between Bana and McAdams is electric. There are some touching scenes at the end as well, but I won't say more than that.Not twist endings or last-minute gotchas that are so in vogue these days, or anything groundbreaking in terms of cinematography or style. This is just a good ole-fashioned romance done with innocence and charm, much like Forest Gump and Benjamin Button.

I had to stop it about once every fifteen minutes on account of being so dumbstruck by its inanity.It's a time-travel story.  Sure, all time-travel stories have fatal contradictions at their core, but the best ones (e.g., Heinlein's ""The Door into Summer"") can at least get some good mileage out of the premise before things break down, as they inevitably must.But this movie doesn't manage get an inch of mileage.  Instead the viewer is assaulted by the contradictions full on; they're shoved right in his face to the point where it's impossible to think of anything else.  Chiefly this is a result of their having made the script too complicated.I supposed I would be more forgiving if the filmmakers had had enough presence of mind to develop the allegorical aspects of their premise more boldly (say, time-travelling as a metaphor for someone who cannot deal with his problems and when weighed down by life's fardels chooses to live in the past or simply daydream).  But if the authors of this script meant anything like that, the actual execution of the film really dropped the ball with it, as the director instead chose to focus on the quotidian difficulties of time-jumping (e.g., having no clothes) instead of any metaphorical meanings.",1,infuriatingly stupid,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,1340,"['One', 'dumbest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'featuring', 'complicated', 'ultimately', 'stupid', 'plot', 'had', 'stop', 'once', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'account', 'being', 'so', 'dumbstruck', 'inanity.It', 'time-travel', 'story', 'Sure', 'time-travel', 'stories', 'have', 'fatal', 'contradictions', 'core', 'best', 'ones', 'e.g.', 'Heinlein', 'Door', 'Summer', 'can', 'least', 'get', 'good', 'mileage', 'premise', 'things', 'break', 'down', 'inevitably', 'must.But', 'movie', ""n't"", 'manage', 'get', 'inch', 'mileage', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'assaulted', 'contradictions', 'full', ""'re"", 'shoved', 'right', 'face', 'point', 'where', 'impossible', 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'Chiefly', 'result', 'having', 'made', 'script', 'too', 'complicated.I', 'supposed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'forgiving', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'presence', 'mind', 'develop', 'allegorical', 'aspects', 'premise', 'more', 'boldly', 'say', 'time-travelling', 'metaphor', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'deal', 'problems', 'when', 'weighed', 'down', 'life', 'fardels', 'live', 'past', 'simply', 'daydream', 'authors', 'script', 'meant', 'anything', 'actual', 'execution', 'film', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'director', 'instead', 'chose', 'focus', 'quotidian', 'difficulties', 'time-jumping', 'e.g.', 'having', 'clothes', 'instead', 'metaphorical', 'meanings']",N/A

A somewhat disjointed story, it's more about the time traveler than his wife.  I haven't read the book, but the film focuses more on the novelty of its unique circumstance than on the characters plight, forsaking the romance it's billed as for shallow sci-fi fiction, as if the uniqueness of circumstance were more important than the story being told, if there ever was one bigger than its base idea.  We really don't get to know the characters as well as is needed for the kind of connection that is most requisite of the genre.  Rather this story seems to levy it's budget on trying to attract a more masculine audience to the genre, as if men won't enjoy a romance any other way.  It is indeed a novel idea mixing time travel with the romance genre; and the added depth is intriguingly astute in application.  But the trade-off of characterization for the implausible, while fresh, still probably isn't going to be enough to appease male-centric audiences longing for more action in their entertainment.

1201835,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001HN69C2,Chris Pandolfi,"[98, 116]","While the story for ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is not at all interested in plausibility or logic, it is interested in making an emotional connection with the audience, and so it does. Make no mistake--this adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's novel is about as preposterous as it gets, telling the story of a man who can go back and forth through time but lacks the ability to control when he goes and for how long he'll be gone. There's no adequate explanation for his condition, and maybe it's for the best; this a love story, after all, not a supernatural commentary on evolution or expanded consciousness. Besides, if you were to stop for a moment and really think about the idea, the inevitable questions will eventually be so numerous that you'll end up with a headache. For this particular story, you'll be much better off just blindly buying into the premise.Only then will it be possible to appreciate the more engaging aspects of the story, the most obvious being the romance between the time traveler, Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana), and his wife, Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Actually, it would be more accurate to say that sometimes she's his wife--it all depends at what point in time the movie shifts to, and there are many of them. They meet back when she was only six years old and playing alone on her family's vast meadow. From out of nowhere comes a man from the future without any clothes on, and after she gives him his blanket, he tells her that he will officially meet her years later, at which point she will be a college student in a library looking for an art book. You see, during that first encounter, he was older, nearly forty; in the library, he will be younger, say twenty-five or so.Anyway, as time goes on for Clare, Henry will repeatedly come into and shift out of her life, and they will fall deeply in love and get married. Imagine what this must be like for Clare, never knowing when her husband will appear and disappear out of thin air like a ghost. One second, he's there carrying dishes to the table for dinner, and the next second he's gone, leaving Clare behind to sweep up broken pieces of ceramic. A marriage like this really gives new meaning to the vow, ""To have and to hold for all time.""One of the unfortunate side effects of his time travelling is that none of his clothes travel with him, so wherever he goes (whenever, rather), he's forced to steal some by breaking into a store or someone else's home. And at what age will he be when he gets back? One of the film's more clever segments incorporates a fair amount of humor and takes place on their wedding day; a younger version of Henry is getting ready for the ceremony, only to disappear in the bathroom. Fortunately, an older version of Henry arrives just in time, albeit with graying hair. This man disappears after the ceremony, right as Clare's father (Philip Craig) invites them to the dance floor. Fortunately, that's when the younger Henry returns, and even though he was technically there, he apologizes for missing the wedding.I told you this time travel gimmick was better left unquestioned. Attached to it, however, are emotional issues that are genuinely touching, and this definitely includes Henry and Clare's attempts to have a baby. I will refrain from going into detail here, but here are some questions to think about. Is it reasonable to assume that Henry's condition can be passed along to his child? If so, then is it fair for that child to even be born? There comes a point when he seeks the help of David Kendrick (Steven Tobolowsky), a geneticist, and while the results of his various tests do little to shed light on why Henry is the way he is, he does play a pivotal role in helping him and Clare conceive. Henry, by the way, tells Dr. Kendrick that his condition is known as chronoimpairment, a term Kendrick has not yet coined.One other emotional issue that serves the story well is the broken relationship between Henry and his father, Richard (Arliss Howard), who hasn't been himself since his wife's untimely death. Henry was only six at the time, but as a time traveler, he continuously goes back to the days before her death and holds brief conversations with her as a stranger. This naturally begs the question of why he can't simply prevent her from dying. This itself begs the question of why, ""I've tried, but there's nothing I can do,"" is the best explanation he has.Deep human drama runs through this movie, and that's what I found the most compelling. Henry's ability to time travel, however, is conveniently left unexplained. We're only meant to pay attention to the relationship between Henry and Clare, and indeed, we do. The concept is inherently absurd, but the chemistry between the main characters is not; we able to see them up on screen and actually believe that they're in love. That's what's so fascinating about ""The Time Traveler's Wife"": It's an absorbing drama based on a premise that's impossible to take seriously. How did it achieve this? Much like Henry's condition, it's probably better to not question it and just accept it for what it is.",4,Here You Leave Today and Enter a World of Yesterday and Tomorrow,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,5105,"['story', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'not', 'interested', 'plausibility', 'logic', 'interested', 'making', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'so', 'Make', 'mistake', 'adaptation', 'Audrey', 'Niffenegger', 'novel', 'as', 'preposterous', 'telling', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'ability', 'control', 'when', 'how', 'long', ""'ll"", 'be', 'gone', 'adequate', 'explanation', 'condition', 'maybe', 'best', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'supernatural', 'commentary', 'evolution', 'expanded', 'consciousness', 'were', 'stop', 'moment', 'really', 'think', 'idea', 'inevitable', 'questions', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'so', 'numerous', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'headache', 'particular', 'story', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'blindly', 'buying', 'premise.Only', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'possible', 'appreciate', 'more', 'engaging', 'aspects', 'story', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'romance', 'time', 'traveler', 'Henry', 'DeTamble', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'wife', 'Clare', 'Abshire', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Actually', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'sometimes', 'wife', 'what', 'point', 'time', 'movie', 'shifts', 'are', 'many', 'meet', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'playing', 'alone', 'family', 'vast', 'meadow', 'nowhere', 'man', 'future', 'clothes', 'blanket', 'will', 'officially', 'meet', 'years', 'later', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'college', 'student', 'library', 'looking', 'art', 'book', 'see', 'first', 'encounter', 'was', 'older', 'nearly', 'forty', 'library', 'will', 'be', 'younger', 'say', 'twenty-five', 'so.Anyway', 'time', 'Clare', 'Henry', 'will', 'repeatedly', 'come', 'shift', 'out', 'life', 'will', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'Imagine', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'Clare', 'never', 'knowing', 'when', 'husband', 'will', 'appear', 'disappear', 'thin', 'air', 'ghost', 'One', 'second', 'there', 'carrying', 'dishes', 'table', 'dinner', 'next', 'second', 'gone', 'leaving', 'Clare', 'sweep', 'up', 'broken', 'pieces', 'ceramic', 'marriage', 'really', 'new', 'meaning', 'vow', 'have', 'hold', 'time', 'One', 'unfortunate', 'side', 'effects', 'time', 'travelling', 'none', 'clothes', 'travel', 'so', 'whenever', 'rather', 'forced', 'steal', 'breaking', 'store', 'someone', 'else', 'home', 'what', 'age', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'back', 'One', 'film', 'more', 'clever', 'segments', 'fair', 'amount', 'humor', 'place', 'wedding', 'day', 'younger', 'version', 'Henry', 'getting', 'ready', 'ceremony', 'only', 'disappear', 'bathroom', 'Fortunately', 'older', 'version', 'Henry', 'just', 'time', 'graying', 'hair', 'man', 'ceremony', 'right', 'Clare', 'father', 'Philip', 'Craig', 'dance', 'floor', 'Fortunately', 'when', 'younger', 'Henry', 'returns', 'even', 'was', 'technically', 'there', 'missing', 'wedding.I', 'told', 'time', 'travel', 'gimmick', 'was', 'better', 'left', 'unquestioned', 'Attached', 'however', 'are', 'emotional', 'issues', 'are', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'definitely', 'Henry', 'Clare', 'attempts', 'have', 'baby', 'will', 'refrain', 'going', 'detail', 'here', 'here', 'are', 'questions', 'think', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'Henry', 'condition', 'can', 'be', 'passed', 'child', 'so', 'then', 'fair', 'child', 'even', 'be', 'born', 'point', 'when', 'help', 'David', 'Kendrick', 'Steven', 'Tobolowsky', 'geneticist', 'results', 'various', 'tests', 'do', 'little', 'shed', 'light', 'why', 'Henry', 'way', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'helping', 'Clare', 'conceive', 'Henry', 'way', 'tells', 'Dr.', 'Kendrick', 'condition', 'known', 'chronoimpairment', 'term', 'Kendrick', 'not', 'yet', 'coined.One', 'other', 'emotional', 'issue', 'story', 'well', 'broken', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'father', 'Richard', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'wife', 'untimely', 'death', 'Henry', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'time', 'time', 'traveler', 'continuously', 'back', 'days', 'death', 'brief', 'conversations', 'stranger', 'naturally', 'question', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'prevent', 'dying', 'question', 'why', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'best', 'explanation', 'human', 'drama', 'movie', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'compelling', 'Henry', 'ability', 'time', 'travel', 'however', 'conveniently', 'left', 'unexplained', ""'re"", 'only', 'meant', 'pay', 'attention', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'Clare', 'indeed', 'do', 'concept', 'inherently', 'absurd', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'able', 'see', 'up', 'screen', 'actually', 'believe', ""'re"", 'love', 'what', 'so', 'fascinating', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'based', 'premise', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously', 'How', 'did', 'achieve', 'Much', 'Henry', 'condition', 'probably', 'better', 'not', 'question', 'just', 'accept', 'what']",N/A

It stars Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams and was directed by Robert Schwentke.Henry DeTamble, played by Bana, is five years old when he discovers, in a most tragic way, his amazing ability to travel through time. As Henry ages and continues through his life, popping in and out of different times, he meets Clare Abshire, played by McAdams, as a young child. Realizing that he often visits the same location more than once, the two become fast friends, he as a man and she as a child. They continue to meet in a meadow throughout Clare's life. When the two finally meet as adults, Clare already knows the details of Henry's unusual gift and has loved the man her whole life. Together they begin anew and embark on a journey of love and family, all the while seeking some sense of normalcy in their awkward circumstances.The only question that remains is, can love endure the tests of time and time travel? Eric Bana plays a magnificent role as Henry the time traveler and Rachel McAdams is sweet and endearing as Clare. I believe my advantage with watching The Time Traveler's Wife, was that I had not read the novel prior to seeing the DVD, therefore it was easy to view the film and not be biased by any prior knowledge of the book.

Clare first meets Henry when she is six years old and he suddenly appears, naked, in the Meadow near her home: he's thirty-six at the time. On the other hand, Henry first meets Clare in the library where he works, when he's twenty-eight and she's twenty. Henry has a condition called Chrono-Displacement Disorder, which has him disappearing and reappearing into various times in the past and future. This is ultimately a beautiful love story with a time-travel twist, which adds a different dimension to the story: humour in some parts, horror or heartache in others.

1201846,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001HN69C2,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 8]","Hey, its not as if I don't enjoy seeing a good-looking man in the buff, especially when he's as boyishly attractive as Eric Bana.  However, in Robert Schwentke's adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's novel ""The Time Traveler's Wife,""  even this incredible hun(l)k (all bashful and more than a little angst-ridden ) cannot make this combination romance, sci-fi melodrama work without a sense of prevailing doom and a bit of creepy undertones that are more than strange with regard to adult Bana and his relationship to the child that becomes his wife.  But then again, I had a problem with this when I read the book and I confess to a confusion over the bestseller's popularity--at the time it had been one of those Morning Show recommendations.While there are some similarities in tone to the equally somber Pitt/Blanchette vehicle, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Single-Disc Edition),"" at least `Button' forces you to explore the theme of love and dependency--dependency as a child for its mother, as a mature adult desiring affection and then as an elderly person at the end of his/her life needing the love and support of those who love him/her.  Not so with `Traveler.'  Sadly, other than the exploration of the idea that in our universe time and space really do not exist and that perhaps we are able in some way to slip back and forth to various time slots within our lifetime--be it through memory, imagination or on a molecular level--""The Time-Traveler's Wife"" serves no function for me other than to depict the entrapment of love--for surely Clare (Rachel McAdams) from the moment she meets the ill-fated Henry (Bana) is snared as surely as the deer that wanders the woods on her family estate--just waiting for that decisive moment when an arrow or bullet will find its heart.Let me clarify.  Henry has some rare genetic disease that causes him to zip around the space-time continuum in an uncontrollable way that would have baffled an already bemused Einstein.  Not that Einstein would not have laughed or at the very least shook his head to see buff and buffed Bana lurking around meadows, train stations and the like sans clothing (as fabric does not slip through whatever unknown wormhole Henry uses as his time tunnel/portal.)  Claire's life serves as the standard for chronology--she first meets Henry when he materializes behind a clump of bushes in the meadow by her home when she is around seven years old.  However, Henry does not actually meet Claire until he is a librarian and she a student that requires his assistance in finding a book.  Already Claire wins the prize for Miss or Ms Dependence--hooked at such a young age--and collapsing every other probability curve out there while she waits for the Time Traveler to enter her life--or re-enter her life at a point in time when pedophilia would not be an issue.That's not to suggest that there is any of that sort of stuff going on.  Not at all.  Henry's atoms supposedly are attracted to certain locales no matter what the time slot and so, he frequently pops back and forth to places that hold special significance for him.  Claire, no matter her youth or her age, draws him like a magnet.  Nonetheless, a naked man hiding in the bushes while a young girl picnics in a field could presumably raise a few eyebrows.  Obviously, Claire's parents did not teach her not to talk to strangers even though she was born in cautious 1972.  Go figure.  Any other child would have run screaming on the wings of an eagle.  Not our Claire.Bana plays Henry well as a sorrowful boy/man with the frustrated angst of someone with a dark cloud hanging over his head.  McAdams, while undeniably pretty--all big eyes and Madonna (not the rock star) forehead does not generate enough gravitas for me as the besotted, concerned and dependent Claire.  Blanchette in `Button' would have been better in this role of doomed from the start--she exudes maturity that Claire would have needed.  McAdams (The Notebook (New Line Platinum Series)as vulnerable child/woman works well initially--but her older Claire doesn't quite register with any depth and as a mother to Alba--the couple's time-traveling child--she seems more an older distraught sister.Bottom line:  ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" combines science-fiction, romance and melodrama in a two-hour slot that for this reviewer captured the feel of the book with all its somber overtones of the generic woman having to deal with the absence of her man in a world designed to accommodate only him.  Add insult to injury and imagine a man that cannot control when he's bouncing out of town and leaving his wife with all the responsibilities and not even leaving a contact number.  The naked Bana popping randomly around to glimpse the prepubescent and precocious young Claire may be a bit strange, but then again, the whole premise of the film has little meaning other than to suggest that wrapping around one person so intensely will only bring misery and a wistfulness that cannot be accommodated with anything real for long periods of time.  Parents take note that there is some blood in the scenes where Claire miscarriages and that Bana and McAdams both reveal some posterior cheekiness that although lovely and blemish free may offend.  Recommended if you loved the book.  I did not.Postscript: In retrospect, this whole concept of the time-traveler flitting in and out of the events that encompass his life and go beyond his lifespan would make an interesting television series.  The romance between the husband and wife would be both romantic and poignant and like all good episodic shows there could be a one hour resolution to that week's story while the larger story of Henry searching for something that will allow him to control his disappearances would keep the momentum going.  Think ""Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series"" where Vincent and Catherine shared a doomed love andThe Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)where the search for a solution to being green is paramount.  Now if any television writer out there uses this idea--I want my percentage.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc",3,Naked Comes the Time-Traveler to a Television Set Near You,1250208000,"08 14,

A genetic disorder that causes involuntary time travel, whereby the traveler arrives in the past, or future, in his birthday suit, and he has no control over how long he stays?  Plus said traveler must resort to breaking and entering to find clothes for his person, ticking off countless property owners and law enforcement personnel.Like I said, goofy.  Pass the Pepcid.Thus we have the silly mess that is THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  A confused-looking Eric Bana is the time traveler, a mild-mannered Chicago librarian who turns into a WWF brawler when he has to go find something to wear.  His ""disorder"" supposedly is beyond his control--he doesn't know when he'll disappear to travel in time, nor how long he'll be gone--yet at one point he tells his future wife, six at the time, the exact day he'll be back so that she may leave some of her father's clothes in the bushes for him.This thing is more uneven than my latest P&L; statement.At the center of this silliness is a love story--the marriage of the time traveler and his starry-eyed wife (Rachel McAdams).  It goes without saying his popping in and out of her life produces considerable strain on the relationship.  A missed Christmas here, a zany wedding there, an image of him fatally wounded in the hallway for melodramatic effect, and that pretty much sums it up.

WHAT IF you could get to know your wife during different phases of her life?  What if you could talk with her about her hopes & dreams from when she was a little girl?  A teenager?  A young adult?  Also, what if you could actually have a dialouge with yourself from earlier periods of your life?  While most of us would not be able to stay sane during these experiences, it is nonetheless an interesting premise.Eric Bana is a good actor & I've always liked him.  This film showcases his versatility, going from a buffed up Greek warrior inTroy (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)to portraying a man who is cursed with the affliction of spontaneous time travel in the current film.Rachel McAdams is a fabulous actress, and she's the primary reason I picked up this movie.  As always, she delivers a stellar performance.  I first saw her inWedding Crashers (Unrated Widescreen Edition)and I could tell that her talents were wasted in that farce.  Don't get me wrong:  WC was a hilarious movie & it delivered the humor that I wanted it to.  It's just that seeing Rachel in that film was kind of like Sir Lawrence Olivier guest starring onGilligan's Island: The Complete First Season.If you're a fan of time travel movies, chick flicks or date movies, then this one is certainly worth a viewing.

1201854,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001HN69C2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 8]","THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, something of an irritating borefest, is an obligation we had to address sooner or later--fulfilling the promise to review all time travel movies of interest. A bad movie can still be ""of interest"".Firstly, it can be said that this film treats time travel in a rather blas&eacute; fashion: it's a genetic disease here, somehow related to epilepsy. Of course the poor bastard time traveler Henry (Eric Bana, miraculously though not in-every-scene freshly shaved) won't learn this til late in life. That is just one of the bits of tomfoolery this film will throw at you. You are expected to swallow all this, thank you very little, without protest.Well, it can't be all bad, and it isn't. Henry's eternal love Clare (young Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams) seems to be the main focal point of his travels into the past, which we see only in hashed-up bits though it occurs constantly. There is one single fascinating line in this film: that time travel disease is event-related, thus gravity-related. I'd never heard that proposed in any story before. Though Henry travels to the future, we see only a scene or two of that. I will not spoil what he sees. However, it amounts to relatively little.What I have told my students, my wife and my ever-more-quantum-curious little brother about time travel is that one should forget about it, lest one go completely round the twig. If you spend a second applying physics in either the Einsteinian or Heisenbergian modes, you'll miss this snorefest. And...my goodness, who'd want to miss something like a solid 25 minutes total screen time of Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams making love?! (That could have all been cut out, in my opinion.)In case you want some idea of quality: this film was produced by Brad Pitt and directed by a nobody German director, Robert Schwentke. The cinematography such as it is seems rather clever, and based on the work here, I'd expect big things in the future from director Schwentke.All in all, I'd say don't really expect anything from this almost-B-quality film. Use the ""generous"" B-movie mentality if you see it. Otherwise, buy THE TOMORROW MAN (see my review--you'll like that film a lot more).",2,I wish Einstein had watched this with me so I could have gone back and not seen it,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2202,"['TIME', 'TRAVELER', 'WIFE', 'something', 'irritating', 'borefest', 'obligation', 'had', 'address', 'sooner', 'later', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'review', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'interest', 'bad', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'interest', '.Firstly', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'time', 'travel', 'rather', 'blas', 'eacute', 'fashion', 'genetic', 'disease', 'here', 'somehow', 'related', 'epilepsy', 'course', 'poor', 'bastard', 'time', 'traveler', 'Henry', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'miraculously', 'not', 'in-every-scene', 'freshly', 'shaved', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'til', 'late', 'life', 'just', 'one', 'bits', 'tomfoolery', 'film', 'will', 'throw', 'are', 'expected', 'swallow', 'thank', 'very', 'little', 'protest.Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', ""n't"", 'Henry', 'eternal', 'love', 'Clare', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'be', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'travels', 'past', 'see', 'only', 'hashed-up', 'bits', 'constantly', 'one', 'single', 'fascinating', 'line', 'film', 'time', 'travel', 'disease', 'event-related', 'thus', 'gravity-related', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'proposed', 'story', 'Henry', 'travels', 'future', 'see', 'only', 'scene', 'two', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'what', 'However', 'relatively', 'little.What', 'have', 'told', 'students', 'wife', 'ever-more-quantum-curious', 'little', 'brother', 'time', 'travel', 'one', 'should', 'forget', 'lest', 'one', 'go', 'completely', 'twig', 'spend', 'second', 'applying', 'physics', 'Einsteinian', 'Heisenbergian', 'modes', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'snorefest', 'goodness', 'who', ""'d"", 'want', 'miss', 'something', 'solid', '25', 'minutes', 'total', 'screen', 'time', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'making', 'love', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'opinion', 'case', 'want', 'idea', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'directed', 'nobody', 'German', 'director', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'cinematography', 'such', 'rather', 'clever', 'based', 'work', 'here', ""'d"", 'expect', 'big', 'things', 'future', 'director', 'Schwentke.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'anything', 'almost-B-quality', 'film', 'Use', 'generous', 'B-movie', 'mentality', 'see', 'Otherwise', 'buy', 'THE', 'TOMORROW', 'MAN', 'see', 'review', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'lot', 'more']",N/A

I've never read the book, so I can't comment on what was missing or changed. I don't read a ton of books or watch movies using time-travel, but this one was a little hard to grip. I didn't really understand the movie until I went to the trusty IMDb boards. Basically the main thing you need to know is (((((((SPOILER COMING UP)))))))) is that there's a Past Henry, a Present Henry, and a Future Henry. HOWEVER, it is ALWAYS the PRESENT for whoever (Clare, Alba) in whatever timeframe he's in. So for example, when he meets 6 yr old Clare...that's HER present, but he's a FUTURE Henry. When he goes back, he's PRESENT Henry with PRESENT Clare. Also, regardless of everything, ""life"" has already happened or (for 6 yr old Clare) is scheduled to happen.Or something like that. Honestly, my mind still hasn't totally grasped what I watched.The movie was easy enough to watch, and one of the things I found interesting was that Future Henry never tried to influence past events. For example, he ""meets"" his mom on the train (FUTURE Henry meets the mom of 6 yr old Henry--again MOM'S present), but doesn't indicate to her that she's going to die. Also, he doesn't try to influence the outcome of his own tragedy.  However, at the same time, when Clare got the winning lottery ticket, he told her that she was going to win. So for me, it seemed like the movie influenced the events that it wanted to.Again, ""life"" in this movie is going to happen regardless and the knowledge that Henry doesn't alter anything sort of makes for a confusing experience. Sometimes a jumbled mess. So the idea that just by being there Henry alters history is non-existent. Apparently, he's also unable to know where/when he will be when he travels, although he conveniently comes to the rescue (wedding day and the vasectomy day) on a couple of occasions.  One other thing that wasn't clear to me was at the end (((((SPOILER COMING UP))) when Henry travels to the future and sees Alba and Clare and tells Clare not to wait for him. Is this before or after Alba informs him of his death? And does that also mean that eventually he will stop appearing to them...once Present Henry actually dies? I guess I'd just be curious to know if death ends the time travel bc if Alba is 11...he should be dead and in theory, Clare shouldn't be waiting for him. Right?Who knows. When the credits rolled I had tons of questions. The performances were decent, and I especially loved using two sisters to play Alba at ages 4/5 and 9/10.",3,Hmm...I wanted to like it ((may have a spoiler or two)),1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2597,"['like', 'Rachel', 'McA', 'am', 'so-so', 'Eric', 'Bana', ""'Hulk"", 'notwithstanding', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'was', 'missing', 'changed', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'ton', 'books', 'watch', 'movies', 'using', 'time-travel', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'grip', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'movie', 'went', 'trusty', 'IMDb', 'boards', 'Basically', 'main', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'SPOILER', 'COMING', 'UP', 'Past', 'Henry', 'Present', 'Henry', 'Future', 'Henry', 'HOWEVER', 'ALWAYS', 'PRESENT', 'whoever', 'Clare', 'Alba', 'timeframe', 'So', 'example', 'when', '6', 'yr', 'old', 'Clare', 'HER', 'present', 'FUTURE', 'Henry', 'When', 'back', 'PRESENT', 'Henry', 'PRESENT', 'Clare', 'Also', 'regardless', 'everything', 'life', 'already', 'happened', '6', 'yr', 'old', 'Clare', 'scheduled', 'happen.Or', 'something', 'Honestly', 'mind', 'still', ""n't"", 'totally', 'grasped', 'what', 'watched.The', 'movie', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'watch', 'one', 'things', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'Future', 'Henry', 'never', 'tried', 'influence', 'past', 'events', 'example', 'meets', 'mom', 'train', 'FUTURE', 'Henry', 'mom', '6', 'yr', 'old', 'Henry', 'again', 'MOM', 'present', ""n't"", 'indicate', 'going', 'die', 'Also', ""n't"", 'try', 'influence', 'outcome', 'own', 'tragedy', 'However', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'Clare', 'got', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'So', 'seemed', 'movie', 'influenced', 'events', 'wanted', 'to.Again', 'life', 'movie', 'going', 'happen', 'regardless', 'knowledge', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'alter', 'anything', 'sort', 'confusing', 'experience', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'idea', 'just', 'being', 'Henry', 'alters', 'history', 'non-existent', 'Apparently', 'also', 'unable', 'know', 'where/when', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'conveniently', 'rescue', 'wedding', 'day', 'vasectomy', 'day', 'couple', 'occasions', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'was', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'COMING', 'UP', 'when', 'Henry', 'future', 'sees', 'Alba', 'Clare', 'tells', 'Clare', 'not', 'wait', 'Alba', 'death', 'also', 'mean', 'eventually', 'will', 'stop', 'appearing', 'once', 'Present', 'Henry', 'actually', 'guess', ""'d"", 'just', 'be', 'curious', 'know', 'death', 'time', 'travel', 'bc', 'Alba', '11', 'should', 'be', 'dead', 'theory', 'Clare', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'waiting', 'Right', 'Who', 'When', 'credits', 'rolled', 'had', 'tons', 'questions', 'performances', 'were', 'decent', 'especially', 'loved', 'using', 'two', 'sisters', 'play', 'Alba', 'ages', '4/5', '9/10']",N/A

I haven't read the book, which probably worked to my advantage in enjoying the film - I didn't have any preconceived notions on what the film should be about.The movie is a good old-fashioned romance.  The actual time-traveling isn't treated in any depth whatsoever, except to acknowledge that the time traveler has no control over when he travel through time, he's learned to cope with it (mostly), and his clothes are unable to travel with him, so he always arrives naked (which is one of the main challenges of his time travel, he's constantly breaking into places and stealing clothes).  Somewhat surprisingly, everyone in his life that he trusts accepts his time travel as just a ""condition"" (which is what he calls his ability to time travel).His wife is the most understanding of everyone, she just accepts the fact that sometimes, her husband will just disappear, then come back a few weeks later like nothing happened.I think the time-traveling is actually a metaphor for marriage.  Sometimes, spouses just up and leave without warning.  Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.

1201869,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001HN69C2,Grady Harp,"[24, 27]","THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a diversion.  At times what works well in a novel doesn't translate to the screen: the magic of the reader's imagination can be more powerful than the visualization of a screenwriter and director. Such is the case of Audrey Niffenegger's novel - an escape into a world of the unknown (time traveling) that played well on the page largely due to the writing skill of the author. Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay makes a mighty attempt to make visual the imaginary magic of the novel and thanks to CGI it pulls off the rather strange effects of appearing and disappearing of a time traveler.  Robert Schwentke directs with a hefty dose of saccharine though, making what could have been a delicate story somewhat lugubrious.Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has the genetic code that allows him to travel backward and forward in time - a trait that requires a certain degree of acceptance on the part of the audience. We see Henry as a child, as a young man who meets a girl who will on a different 'trip' be a woman Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), and witness a bizarre courtship between a couple whose match seems made in heaven....  Along the way Clare's friends (Jane McLean as Charisse and Ron Livingston as a vastly different Gomez than in the novel) figure into the quasi-normal relationship/marriage that takes place.  The tale can be confusing if the viewer is not willing to enter the realm of 'possible' and the main guide of the film seems to focus on the fact that whenever Henry time travels, he ends up in his new destination naked (there are many scenes of Eric Bana just searching for clothes).  Of course the film can't have a logical ending, but the ending selected, corny though it is, fits the story.  Lots of sugar to swallow here, but if you're in a Valentine mood it is a pleasant diversion.

1201872,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001HN69C2,Haunted Flower,"[7, 17]","""The Time Traveler's Wife"" was directed by Robert Schwentke and the screenplay was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and the novel by Audrey Niffenegger. It stars Eric Bana as Henry, a man with a genetic disorder that makes him unable to stay in one place in time and so he time travels. Rachel McAdams plays his eventual wife, Clare.I found the premise of the book interesting and exciting seeing him pop around in time, never knowing what was going to happen next. But just as awkward as it was in the book, I have a little trouble with him showing up naked places, particularly in front of the 6 year old version of Clare. That being said, I think this script was well adapted and well ordered from the book. Starting with him as a child and covering the most important events in Henry's life made the movie easy to watch and understand, even for someone who hasn't read the book I would think. It never stops you from wondering though, how happy this couple ever truly is. Their lives are plotted out in advance seemingly without choice and one of the main conflicts is that she is always having to sit around and wait for him to come back and can't predict when he will. I think the ending of the movie is better than the ending of the book. If your friend or girlfriend really likes romantic dramas, then they will eat this up. But for me, it has to be something pretty special or I lose patience with it.Eric Bana is always hit or miss for me. Liked him in ""Troy"", didn't like him in ""The Incredible Hulk"". I thought he did well enough in ""Funny People"" and ""Star Trek"", but I'm not a huge fan of ""Munich"". For this movie, he was so busy disappearing and reappearing that when he had scenes with his co-star, I didn't feel like he was THERE connecting with her very well.Poor Rachel McAdams, first ""The Notebook"" and all that drama and now this, even more heartbreak. Do we as film viewers just like seeing her in romantic turmoil? She's very talented, but give the girl a break! I hope she got a good paycheck here. She's very beautiful and has a great smile and I have to admit, when her eyes well up with tears, she almost gets me. But their relationship together was never sold for me, not in the book and not on screen with these two actors.I say avoid unless you are hanging out with your mom and a box of kleenex or something and really ready to get your emo-on.",1,"I can say I read this book, and wow, the movie is just as depressing.",1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2370,"['Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'was', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'novel', 'Audrey', 'Niffenegger', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Henry', 'man', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'unable', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'time', 'so', 'time', 'travels', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'eventual', 'wife', 'Clare.I', 'found', 'premise', 'book', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'seeing', 'pop', 'around', 'time', 'never', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'just', 'as', 'awkward', 'was', 'book', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'showing', 'up', 'naked', 'places', 'particularly', 'front', '6', 'year', 'old', 'version', 'Clare', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'adapted', 'well', 'ordered', 'book', 'Starting', 'child', 'covering', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'Henry', 'life', 'made', 'movie', 'easy', 'watch', 'understand', 'even', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'would', 'think', 'never', 'wondering', 'how', 'happy', 'couple', 'ever', 'truly', 'lives', 'are', 'plotted', 'out', 'advance', 'seemingly', 'choice', 'one', 'main', 'conflicts', 'always', 'having', 'sit', 'around', 'wait', 'come', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'when', 'will', 'think', 'ending', 'movie', 'better', 'ending', 'book', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'likes', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'then', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'be', 'something', 'pretty', 'special', 'lose', 'patience', 'it.Eric', 'Bana', 'always', 'hit', 'miss', 'Liked', 'Troy', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'thought', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'Funny', 'People', 'Star', 'Trek', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Munich', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'busy', 'disappearing', 'reappearing', 'when', 'had', 'scenes', 'co-star', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'THERE', 'connecting', 'very', 'well.Poor', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'first', 'Notebook', 'drama', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'heartbreak', 'Do', 'film', 'viewers', 'just', 'seeing', 'romantic', 'turmoil', 'very', 'talented', 'give', 'girl', 'break', 'hope', 'got', 'good', 'paycheck', 'here', 'very', 'beautiful', 'great', 'smile', 'have', 'admit', 'when', 'eyes', 'well', 'tears', 'almost', 'relationship', 'together', 'was', 'never', 'sold', 'not', 'book', 'not', 'screen', 'two', 'actors.I', 'say', 'avoid', 'are', 'hanging', 'out', 'mom', 'box', 'kleenex', 'something', 'really', 'ready', 'get', 'emo-on']",N/A

Both actors looked a lot like what I pictured the characters to look like in my head. I also think that they had amazing chemistry together. I also LOVED the little girl that played Clare (age 6) when she first meets Henry - she was great.My feelings for this moving are slightly above average - the parts that were included from the book were done very well.

1201883,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B001HN69C2,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[7, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***All romantic movies chronicle the progress of a romantic relationship as it (usually) triumphs over many small obstacles, or one major obstacle. In romantic fantasy movies, the obstacle or obstacles are supernatural. However, regardless of the nature of the obstacle, a romantic movie will succeed in moving us only if the couple portrayed is multifaceted, complex, sympathetic, sensible, and endearing. If the couple is not, they are in danger in being upstaged by the obstacle or obstacles opposing their union. In my opinion, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" suffers from the latter condition.""The Time Traveler's Wife"" chronicles the tortured progress of the romantic relationship between Chicago librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and heiress/aspiring artist Clare (Rachel McAdams). The obstacle that dogs them before and after their marriage is a diabolically tragic doozy: Henry is genetically predisposed to time travel randomly and unwillingly throughout his life (called chrono-displacement in the movie) whenever he is stressed, drunk, or emotionally distraught. Even worse, he must do so stark naked (a la the Terminator) because his clothing is not organic and therefore must find clothes in the time period he lands in (past, present, and even future) before he suffers social embarrassment, arrest for indecent exposure, or sickness like hypothermia. As I said, it's a doozy of a problem, and it detracts from Henry and Clare's relationship, sweet and gentle as it is.Of course, the time travel angle dredges up all the usual paradoxes (e.g. you can't change the past, alternate time-lines, past/present/future versions of yourself). But the movie complicates the paradox even further by having nearly infinite versions of Henry (from five-year old child to middle-age adult) flitting back and forth through time. Sometimes, implausibly, these different versions meet each other (wouldn't they explode on contact, like matter/anti-matter). Furthermore, Henry's appearances and disappearances are unpredictable. Not only does Clare not know when Henry will return from his bare romps, she doesn't even know which Henry will return. But she has the patience of Penelope waiting for Odysseus, and she treats Henry's condition mostly as an inconvenience.Clare's cavalier attitude towards Henry's condition is stupefying, even for a romantic fantasy. Doesn't she realize Henry is subject to a tragic curse? Why haven't the couple tried to find a cure earlier on in the relationship? Why didn't Henry and his father, who knows his son has the condition, try to cure him when he was a boy or a teenager? Life must have been hell growing up. Still, Henry amazingly appears to be a fundamentally well-adjusted and stable person. One would think his condition would have eroded his sanity and made him suicidal.Some posters advise to treat the time-travel angle as a plot device and just enjoy the budding romance and marriage. I couldn't. Without the suspense of knowing when and where Henry would vanish, the romance is actually pretty vapid and pedestrian. Henry and Clare certainly make an attractive, sexy couple, but they seem to be boring, ordinary people leading boring, ordinary lives. Even their creepily precocious daughter Alba is interesting only because she has inherited her father's time-traveling ability and can even control it to some extent. More detrimentally, Clare at times comes across as a slightly whiny, precious princess a bit too focused on her own needs. For example, she gets upset at Henry when he reappears after having missed Christmas and New Years. Honey, the dude can't help it. At that point, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" should have been playing on the soundtrack. Also, she wants a baby so desperately that even though one version of Henry (""the"" version, I guess) gets a vasectomy to avoid having a child who will suffer his curse, she ""cheats"" on that version with a younger, ""fully functional"" version of Henry and conceives Alba in a car in a Chicago parking lot.Not even death can really bring poor Henry release; toward the end of the movie, Henry reappears naked in the meadow where he first met his future bride when she was six. This time, however, it's winter and Clare's boorish hunter father mistakes him for a deer and kills him. No matter, there will always be another version of Henry (young or old) to visit and comfort Clare. So immortal love conquers all! Does it makes your eyes tear up? Oh, please, it made my eyes roll!If you want to see a better constructed and involving romantic fantasy involving the undeniably handsome and magnetic Eric Bana, I'd suggest watching Ang Lee's Hulk. His relationship with Jennifer Connelly's character is more intricate, plangent, and affecting. Besides, he gets to keep his pants on (most of the time) even after he transforms into the Hulk.P.S:  I theorize that Henry's chrono-displacement genes must be recessive, because neither of his parents could time travel.  Therefore, both parents must have been chrono-displacement gene carriers and gave their recessive genes to Henry when he was born.2.5 stars out of 5",2,Time Travel Paradox Traffic Jam Overwhelms

So, me, her and my step sister went to see it.  The movie is about a man.  The man can travel in time.  Though he cannot control when or where he goes.  He will just disappear, and appear in a different place and time.  Did I mention he loses his clothes when he does this?  He has to find a place to get some fast.  One day he travels somewhere and a girl says his name.  As if she knows him.  The man though does not know the girl.  He may have met her when he is older, and she much younger.  She always wants to get married to him.  Maybe it will happen.  Eventually, the man marries someone.  I will not say who.  They try to have a baby.  The lady keeps having miscarriages.  Turns out that the baby may be time traveling as a fetus!  If that makes the movie sound stupid, don't worry.  They don't go crazy with it.  That may not even be what's wrong.  It may be the stress of the mother.  She does all she can to relax and eventually has a baby.  But can the baby grow up to time travel as well?  I guess only time will tell.  Then, one day, the dad sees himself.  Something is wrong though.  He seems to be hurt.  Then he travels away.  The mom and dad try to think if the man is going to die.  If you knew when you were going to die, would you feel relived, or afraid?The movie was great.  It had humor, romance, drama  and sci-fi.  He gets really deep in the middle.  When the father talks to someone who may be important to him.  They told a little about how they may could travel in time.  But they didn't really explain that much.  You still get the feeling that you understand enough to understand the movie.  Also, you kind of wonder, If something were to happen to the man, would another version of himself be able to travel to the time when he was gone, and live his life then?  Sound confusing?  Well, don't worry.  It really wasn't.  This was such a good movie to see on a warm day.  All the actors do a great job.  You really get into it.  They could probably make another movie about this.  I won't say why.  I even think they could have a TV show about it.  Guess I am thinking Quantum leap.  But what if they had a show where they tried to find out how to stop it?  Guess the last thing we all need is another TV show that isn't very good, based on a great movie.  I would say if you like sci - fi or romance movies, than you will probably like this one.

I was afraid that it would be sappy, based on the title, or that the science fiction tenets of time travel would be horribly abused, but neither is true.

I was very pleasantly surprised.The problem is that I can't really tell you much about the story of THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE without giving chunks of it away. Let's just say that his life is not linear. He fades out uncontrollably, leaving his clothing behind, and reappears in random times and locations, naked. Madcap mayhem ensues - not. It is mostly a quiet, romantic film, with things unfolding as they need to. I struggle to tell you more, but I can't think of anything that wouldn't reveal a secret.The acting is solid, the plot twists are amusing, sad, delightful, and romantic, and the overall concept is unique.

But I'd heard the title a thousand times and thought it sounded interesting. I tend to multi-task when I watch films at home so this movie viewing session was not an exception. About 20 minutes into the film I asked my husband if folding laundry was keeping me from getting what was going on. He said that the movie was confusing and laundry folding was not the problem.Then after a few more naked guy shots I started to follow the plot. Skin shots? Henry, the time traveler, leaves his clothes behind him, landing naked wherever he's sent. And the odd thing is, that wherever he landed, it seems the whole plot point was to find clothes and hope to get back home. And home would find him landing naked and finding the clothes left for him and sometimes being swept away elsewhere, hoping to survive the whole process again. Survival? It's dangerous? Apparently some folks didn't like naked guys stealing their clothes, suddenly appearing in their homes, or the natural elements weren't necessarily friendly, not once did he land on a nude beach.The time jumping lasted varying bits of time. Sometimes mere minutes passed, other times, weeks. I also struggled with liking the characters enough to suspend disbelief over the fact that Henry was able to hold a job for a portion of the film. Or that his landing, naked, in the woods behind the meadow of his future wife's home, when she was but a wee little lass, was anything less than just creepy-wrong. The marital disputes were a little too frequent and the back and forth future/past/future/present/past visits got tedious.There were some intriguing moments like the scientific parts and pieces. Henry was born with a genetic flaw that whips him back and forth through his life and he is able to visit himself at different points.I'm not recommending the movie, but i could see fans of the book wanting to see this film.

I thought often about purchasing the book, and reading it first. I thought often about seeing the movie. My busy life didn't allow me to get to the movie theater, and the stack of unread books I have kept me from purchasing the book. Besides, I'm growing leery of reading a book prior to a movie. At least right before I know a movie is coming out, and it's in book form. When a book is so fresh in your mind, and the movie makes some major changes, and or leave some amazing parts out, its' hard to take. It's a whole other circumstance when I've read the book, and some time later, usually years; it comes out in movie form. I then HAVE to see it...if the book was good, of course.While at the library the other day, I spotted THE TIME TRAVERL'S WIFE and didn't think twice about grabbing it. That very night I watched it.After seeing the movie, though I know books are ALWAYS better, I'm glad I didn't purchase the book and read it. I believe I would have been thoroughly confused. But more than that I was a little mystified of what the story clearly missed in my eyes.Why was he traveling back in time?The movie was good in that it kept you interested. The acting was great. I even cried, yet I felt I was cheated. Cheated out of knowing the meaning to his travels. Why the author didn't make that know is beyond me. Or maybe it's me. Maybe I missed something. I just feel that if there was a clear reason for his travel, the story could have been hugely powerful; instead it left me wondering what'd it all mean. Why...I'll still rate this movie high, and tell others that it was a good movie...just not great. Not great because the author missed their chance to make it great in my eyes. What a shame.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[2, 2]","I love movies about Time Travel, and I loved the refreshing premise of this movie, namely, what it would be like to be married to someone who time travels involuntarily, sometimes at the most inopportune and important moments. Indeed, what would it be like to be that time traveler?The natural metaphor to real life would be when your loved one is not present in your life, and how would you deal with it. If you take it for what it is without exploring it too much, this could be quite an interesting movie, a time travel story and a love story.If you're like me though, and you do explore, it's a different story. I like that the author breaks the mould of Time Travel stories. For example, in Back to the Future, Marty McFly can travel back in time, and he can see but not meet his previous self, because that would be like matter and anti matter colliding and would be potentially a catastrophic encounter. Also, McFly can do things in the past which alter the reality of now.In TTW, Henry can travel and meet and give his 5 year old self a blanket after his first traumatic time travel experience, yet things he does in the past cannot change the way things are now.Even though he cannot change history, he attempts to do so a hundred times.Henry says he cannot control when he travels or where he goes, yet when he meets the girl in the meadow, he says: 'I will see you next Tuesday at 4,' and he does. How can he do this if he cannot control his TT experiences?When Clare meets him as an adult for the first time in reality, he does not recognise her, yet she has all these memories going back to 6, this makes no sense whatsoever. If he cannot change history by going back into the past, then how can he meet this girl at age 6, and be able to influence her to seek him out as an adult who has not yet met her? Also, this meeting in the meadow business between a middle aged man and a little girl, a wee bit odd.Other than that TTW did sustain my interest to the end and does have some touching moments.TTW stars Rachel McAdams of The Notebook, a top 100 rental on a leading online site for the past several years, andRed Eye (Full Screen Edition), an outstanding thriller which I own. Eric Bana of Munich, plays Henry.

If they watch the featurette they would learn about the decisions which were made in the process of adapting the story for the silver screen. I thought it was great. And I loved that Rachael McAdams was a huge fan of the book and fantasized that she would play Clare's role when/if the movie was ever made.The thing which I liked best about this movie was how the time travel can be seen as a metaphor for so many things that happen in a regular marriage.

1201921,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B001HN69C2,Melissa Niksic,"[38, 65]","I will preface this review by stating that ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger is my favorite book of all time. Coming from someone who reads an average of 60 books per year, that's saying a lot.I eagerly awaited the release of this film for years. Also, I tried to approach the film adaptation with an open mind. Even though the trailer looked very good, I knew that the movie would never be as good as the book, at least not with my ridiculously high expectations. I did hope, however, that the film would take the most touching moments of Clare and Henry's amazing story and turn it into a tender, romantic film. Unfortunately, everything about this movie failed miserably. It is a complete disaster, and I think that goes for fans of the book as well as for people who aren't familiar with the story.The plot revolves around the relationship between Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), which is a bit unorthodox, to say the least. Henry is a time traveler, which means he has the nasty habit of up and disappearing at any time, with no notice and through no fault of his own. He journeys into the future and back in time, which is how he and Clare first meet when she is six and Henry is in his 30's. Theirs is a love story that spans multiple decades and dimensions. Together, Clare and Henry experience deep passion, bitter disappointment, and heartbreaking tragedy, but through it all, their love for each other manages to carry them through.I won't spoil more of the plot for those of you that haven't read the book. I also won't waste a lot of time complaining about all the random things that were changed from the book for no apparent reason. (Lincoln Park Zoo instead of the Art Institute? Temporarily wheelchair-bound instead of amputee? And why isn't Clare's hair red as an adult, for god's sake?! Her hair is such a huge part of the book! But I digress.) However, as an adaptation of a great novel and as a stand-alone romantic drama, this movie fails miserably.First, from the perspective of a fan of the book, I hated the film's screenplay. I knew within the first five minutes that the movie was going to be a disaster. The film attempted to explain Henry's condition in the first three minutes, and that set the tone for everything else. Events happened at an insanely fast pace, never allowing the audience to grasp the full extent of what was happening. Obviously, whenever a book is adapted for the big screen, a lot of material needs to be cut. However, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" clocks in at roughly two hours, so there was definitely room to include some pertinent info that was severely lacking from the movie. I especially thought the scenes that revealed Henry's ultimate fate occurred much too quickly, and often the most tragic events in the characters' lives seemed to be sugarcoated...especially that ridiculous, watered-down ending! It also bothered me that the film made it seem like Clare and Henry spent most of the early years of their marriage fighting, because that wasn't the case at all.Additionally, it was impossible to feel any sort of emotional connection to the characters on screen. I am actually fans of both Bana and McAdams, and I didn't care for either of their performances in this film. I'm not sure that's entirely the fault of the actors, though, considering that they were working with such an awful script.My husband watched this movie with me, and he has not read the book.

I loved Rachel McAdams in this movie, too. I really connected with both of them in this movie. Anyway, I much prefer the movie to the novel because read the book back in 2005 and one part of the book really bugged me (with Gomez) and I thought it ruined the novel, which I had thought was awesome up until that point. I was thrilled to see that they nixed that scene when creating the screenplay used for the movie. And with Brad Pitt as the producer... now that was just too cool! Again, great love story.

The story flashes back and forward (depending on how you track your time) and develops a friendship with her (she of course doesn't know yet this is the man she will marry though she does develop a crush on him).  The main focus of the story, is their relationship, and how they deal with him popping in and out of her life.While I understood the story, I didn't see the point of it.  Normally there's a point to every story, something you leave the movie with.  This one, it seemed like the story was, if you truly love someone, then be prepared if they are a time traveler?  I got a tad confused with the jumping around in time.  I almost felt I needed a flowchart to keep track of it all.  I consider myself a somewhat intelligent person, and it was slight overkill popping back and forth without giving us a title timeline.

1201944,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B001HN69C2,R. Wolfe,"[0, 0]","I just got done watching this movie.  I have been a fan of the novel for years now, and I had put off seeing the film because I was worried it hadn't done one of my favorite stories justice.  The film was met with mixed reviews, and I wasn't ready to see it if it was a trainwreck. Now, having seen it finally, I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with the movie, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to a fan of the novel.  I think it should hang together very well for anyone who hasn't read it, but I honestly can't say that for 100% certain, since I just don't have that perspective as a longtime fan of the novel.  I am a huge sci fi fan, and I love that this story uses a sci fi concept to drive it places very little sci fi ever bothers to go (the pure love story).  It's certainly a love story first with an almost subtle sci fi element.  It's also a story about family, and, as a father, I found it quite emotionally poignant.As a person who knows the story, I found the movie faithful to the original material and the actors cast as perfectly as could be hoped for.  The acting was excellent, and the decisions that had to be made to condense this story into just under a 2-hour movie were the right ones.  Very little is changed from the book, but, most importantly, the main thrust of this basically tragic love story is kept intact.I have to say, where the novel seems to me to have an almost gritty feel in a lot of places, the movie defaults to a much more beautiful, and also somber tone.  Gone are the references to 70's punk rock and the more rough and bizarre nature of some of Henry's travels are not focused on so much.  Even so, it worked.  It still felt like the same story, and it still worked just as well--though slightly differently, on you.  The settings are rich and emotions are sincere.  It is a gorgeous film.I am not sure what someone who hadn't read the book would make of it if they weren't open to a sci fi twist, however some reviews here indicate that it works very well even without having read the book.  I think the film and the novel version are almost complementary.  I do like them both equally well.  I am dumbfounded by some of the extremely uncomplimentary reviews here calling the film ridiculous or too silly to get through.  All one can assume is the sci fi element the story is built around just isn't somewhere some people's brains can go.  It's a classic sci fi movie disconnect with a large chunk of the viewing public, though, and should have been expected.Bottom line: if you have been putting off seeing this movie because of the mixed reviews, forget them and just see it.Basically, the review ends here except for the comment below, which is a possible minor spoiler . . .::: Possible Spoiler Alert - Don't Read Before Seeing Movie ::: There may be some who weren't sure about the way the ending was handled, but readers of the novel are still left with their, or ""the real,"" ending by how/where the movie left things.

1201949,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B001HN69C2,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[2, 3]","Well, I messed up.  I watched The Time Traveler's Wife last night before reading the book.  Guess it seemed fitting since I did a bit of time travel myself for work last week...flying to Detroit and working in Ohio which is an hour ahead of us, and then flying back.At first, I was a bit confused.  It was like walking in on a movie and everyone else but me knows what has happened.  But I watched right from the beginning, so the actors on the screen knew what was happening and it was left up to the audience to just figure it out.  And I think I eventually did.I admit I was utterly confused when Henry (the time traveler) would go back in time and visit his wife-to-be when she was a little girl.  Had he actually done it when in her world that time was the present?  If so, did she remember?  Most of the time it seemed she did so it had actually happened.  The movie begins with a scene where she's caught up to the present time in his own life and he doesn't know who she is or that they are going to marry, but she knows.  But if he'd been visiting her when she was a little girl, shouldn't he know too?Then there are the scenes where he goes in the future and meets his little girl when she is ten, but in his current life she hasn't been born yet, and later is only a baby.  I was a bit intrigued by this and admit it made more sense to me than the earlier travel scenes with the wife.We're not really treated to a reason for Henry's time travel disorder.  He doesn't even know why it happens.  And most of the time we don't know where he's gone.  At one point, he's gone for two weeks.  On his wedding night, he's gone two or three times but seems to have returned each time.  It was almost as if time stood still....or it was a really long honey moon!  Besides the scenes where he's visiting his wife in her past, we also don't know where he goes or why.  But we're not really supposed to know.  The theme is based on the turmoil the traveling causes his wife and how she copes with it.I didn't like this movie though I wanted to.  I can appreciate it, but it's not something I'd probably recommend to a friend or would want to see again.  Yes, I cried in the end, but not because of the way the movie ended.  It was because of the way it made me feel and my own inability to travel back in time and see what I've missed.  We will never be younger than we are right now at this moment.  And we can't change that.  Henry couldn't even change the past in the movie though he tried. And I'm sure I'm not the only one to feel this way.I do appreciate the fact that the movie didn't try to make this out to be magical or any type of fantasy.  Despite the scenes where Henry fades into thin air like the invisible man, leaving behind a pile of clothes.  Or the scenes where he was in the same place twice because he'd gone into the future at some point and then the future became the present but he was already there.  It was all just matter-of-fact, like it was a pretty common thing that could happen to anyone.So yet another book that was probably better than the movie!  I'm sorry Audrey Niffenegger.  I'm sure your book was beautiful and I probably would have enjoyed it more.  But I'm not going to read it.  I do have Her Fearful Symmetry over there on the shelf though.  Dare I wait for the movie? Probably not.  I owe Audrey that.

The story line was intersting, the characters were really well developed and you really care about them. The acting was excellent, and we found ourselves really pulled in throughout the entire movie.Contrary to some of the reviews I read, this movie was easy to follow. I don't understand what the problem was. I had never read the book, yet it was completely clear what was going on. I don't get why anyone would have had a problem. Also, there was nothing strange or wrong about the traveller visiting the younger version of his love interest. It was very innocent.

But I never get a sense of why Clare loves Henry. It's easy enough to understand why Henry would fall for Clare: She is beautiful, intelligent, and she loves him unconditionally, from early childhood, in fact. It's been said that Clare must learn to love what is ""essential"" about Henry, no matter what his age. But I couldn't get any sense of what was essential about Henry. I couldn't even figure out how he managed to work as a librarian, since he can disappear without warning at any moment. In fact, how does he manage to hide his problem from any of the people he knows and works with?Spoilers: In order to introduce some kind of pathos into the story, Clare has a series of miscarriages. Henry's intentions are good, but he stupidly gets a vasectomy so that he and his wife no longer have to go through the anguish. He should have realized that Clare could still get pregnant from his pre-vasectomy self. The movie does not explain why Henry never sees his future daughter until after she is born. Neither does the movie explain why he only seems to go back and forth between being with Clare or being in a back alley or in the snow. Well, one time he shows up in a lion's den at the zoo, but that is the exception.I've heard that the book doesn't get into explaining the mechanics of the time-traveling, and that is fine, but I would hope that it provides more insight into Henry, Clare, and that biggest mystery of all, Love.",2,Book better than movie?,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1577,"['might', 'be', 'case', 'book', 'better', 'movie', 'hope', 'good', 'romances', 'premise', 'one', 'potential', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'why', 'Clare', 'Henry', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'why', 'Henry', 'would', 'fall', 'Clare', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'unconditionally', 'early', 'childhood', 'fact', 'been', 'said', 'Clare', 'must', 'learn', 'love', 'what', 'essential', 'Henry', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'essential', 'Henry', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'managed', 'work', 'librarian', 'can', 'disappear', 'warning', 'moment', 'fact', 'how', 'manage', 'hide', 'problem', 'people', 'Spoilers', 'order', 'introduce', 'kind', 'pathos', 'story', 'Clare', 'series', 'miscarriages', 'Henry', 'intentions', 'are', 'good', 'stupidly', 'vasectomy', 'so', 'wife', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'go', 'anguish', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'Clare', 'could', 'still', 'get', 'pregnant', 'pre-vasectomy', 'self', 'movie', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'Henry', 'never', 'future', 'daughter', 'born', 'movie', 'explain', 'why', 'only', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'being', 'Clare', 'being', 'back', 'alley', 'snow', 'Well', 'one', 'time', 'up', 'lion', 'den', 'zoo', 'exception.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'book', ""n't"", 'get', 'explaining', 'mechanics', 'time-traveling', 'fine', 'would', 'hope', 'more', 'insight', 'Henry', 'Clare', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'Love']",N/A

He arrives and returns from his travels naked, and has no control over when he leaves and returns. His travels find him at various ages, reliving events like the death of his opera-singer mother in a car accident, or experiencing events for the first time, like getting to know a young girl name Clair. When he is in his late twenties, Clair, who is exactly twenty(played by Rachel McAdams),finds him. At this point, he doesn't know her, but she has known him since she was a little girl.The rest of film details a relationship fraught with the unknown. Henry leaves and returns without any warning, takes a few close friend into his confidence regarding his secret, struggles to maintain a romance, then a marriage with Clair, and struggles to start a family and remain hopeful, knowing that the future is uncertain and likely to remain unstable.Bana and McAdams are wonderful in the roles of Henry and Clair. This movie wouldn't work at all unless the characters were perfectly played, had chemistry, and were able to make you focus on the struggle of their relationship rather than the fantasy element of their problem.

1201966,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001HN69C2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Though it has a storyline of a time-traveling theme, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" should best be enjoyed as romantic fantasy. Based on the novel of Audrey Niffenegger, and adapted by Bruce Joel Rubin, Oscar-winning writer of ""Ghost,"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a romance slightly reminiscent of ""Somewhere in Time,"" where familiar sci-fi element serves as backdrop to the film's bitter-sweet romance.The film follows a charming but strange love story between Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and Claire Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Henry is a Chicago librarian and also is the titular ""time traveler."" One day Henry meets Claire. She says to Henry, who looks puzzled, she has known him since she was a little girl. Their complicated love story defies easy summary. In short, they fall in love with each other, but Henry's involuntary time traveling, without which they might not have met each other, can also be a great obstacle in their relationship.For his time traveling is pretty unique and even troublesome. For example, Henry has to be transported back and forth through time, naked. (This turns out a very important part of the story.)""The Time Traveler's Wife"" could have been a much more moving romance. It has beautiful photography and fine performances from the supporting actors Arliss Howard and Ron Livingston. What the film needs is a better director who understands some simple rules of romance: characters. Despite the considerable chemistry between the leads, the two main characters do not come off as interesting as they should be. The concept of Henry's time traveling is original and unique, but the confusing storytelling of director Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"") lacks the emotional depth, preventing us from relating to the characters we really don't know much about.The potential for good romance is always there, buried in the weak script.

1201967,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001HN69C2,Turfseer,"[6, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***While the concept of 'The Time Traveler's Wife' appears pretty clever, the actual execution proves quite inept. Eric Bana is Henry DeTamble, a Chicago librarian, who has some kind of genetic mutation which causes him to skip around in time. The twist is that every time he jumps in time, he loses his clothes. You might think that the image of the naked Henry scrambling around for new duds as he appears in different eras might have the potential for some neat comic possibilities--but humorless director Robert Schwentke opts for a completely heavy-handed, serious approach.The way the time traveling works is that Henry is apparently drawn back to the significant events of his life. Chief among them is a car accident in which 6 year old Henry survives but his mother is killed. Henry still gets the opportunity to see his mother prior to her death as he time jumps into a pre-accident encounter on a train. Later, he visits his father who is now an alcoholic as he never got over his wife's death. The father knows about Henry's time traveling and berates him for not being able to prevent his mother's death. Henry states that he's been to the scene of the accident numerous times and despite his efforts, is never able to alter the events of what occurs (it's interesting that there are no scenes in which Henry does try and prevent his mother from being killed). Nonetheless, despite claiming that he's unable to change history, midway through the story, Henry jumps into the future where he buys a lottery ticket, providing a five million dollar windfall for he and his wife, and guaranteeing the family's financial security for the rest of their lives.One of the givens in this movie is to accept the absurd premise of a genetic mutation that can cause time travel. Since the story is a fantasy, it's a perfectly acceptable conceit. But even within the fantasy concept there has to be some kind of internal logic. It's posited that Henry has no control over his time-traveling forays. He supposedly never knows when he'll be leaving or returning to a particular place and point in time. What's more it's not one Henry who is traveling--there appear to be numerous incarnations of Henry (at different points in his life) who pop up all over the place. So how is it, that these different Henry's conveniently know when to pop back up a critical dramatic moment despite the fact that they supposedly have no control over their time hopping abilities? I'm thinking particularly about the wedding scene where the younger Henry disappears right before he's supposed to get hitched and then is replaced by the older, gray-haired Henry at the altar.In reading various postings on the internet regarding 'The Time Traveler's Wife', a fair number of people are disturbed by the scenes in which Henry visits his future wife, Clare, as a child. To them, the scenes are unsavory as there is perhaps an unhealthy relationship between a child and a grown man suggested. For me, there are no suggestions of an underlying sexual relationship between the characters. Fortunately, the filmmakers did not deal with the problem of the time traveling daughter--wouldn't she have also lost her clothes when hopping around in time? Now that would have been truly disturbing and I can see why the issue was not dealt with at all--despite adding to the entire implausibility of the plot.Speaking of the plot, there is little tension as the story moves along. Part of the problem is that Henry is such a non-heroic sort of character. One wonders how he can hold a job as a librarian with all his time hopping. And then we see that he's not very industrious at all when he takes the easy way out and purchases the lottery ticket (Clare also comes off badly as she goes against her gut instincts and agrees to keep the ticket and cash it in). Henry never develops as a character and we find out little about him. He's too busy losing his clothes and disappearing all the time. There's a bit of tension when Henry's best friend tells Clare not to marry him but then he disappears until the end of the movie. Also completely underdeveloped is Dr. Kendrick who potentially could have developed some kind of cure for Henry's predicament but never does.The central moment of the story occurs when Henry decides to get a vasectomy because he fears that his child might end up with the same genetic abnormality. Clare outwits him by having sex with a pre-vasectomy Henry and gives birth to Alba, who of course also is a time traveler. The dark moment occurs when Henry is shot by Clare's Republican hunter father who mistakes him for a deer out in the woods. But since there are still time hopping Henry's out there, he pays a visit to Clare and Alba after he dies and makes them feel better.The Time Traveler's Wife does have an intriguing premise and holds your interest to the end. Ultimately however, we don't care about these characters precisely because they are not fleshed out as real people. It's a film that failed at the box office as both critics and the public agreed that the fantasy plot had too many implausibilities and none of the characters proved at all compelling. No amount of crocodile tears and whining by the Time Traveler's Wife that her husband never spends enough time at home, can save this flick from devolving into what it is: a predictable soap

The gist of the story is that main character has a genetic defect that allows him to travel in time(kind of like magic, I guess). The entire movie consists of him going and coming back from his travels. It never explained how or why he is able to do that. Poor girl that he falls in love with spends her time waiting for him to come back from his ""travel"" and then they get a daughter who is ..whoops, a ""time traveler"" also. That's the whole movie for you. I love Sci-fi but this is a pretty poor attempt(and a boring one at that). There is a love story in there but frankly I couldn't have cared less.

""The Time Traveler's Wife"" based on the popular novel focuses Henry (Eric Bana) a man permanently unstuck in time--he's born with a genetic defect that causes him to move through time unpredictably. That makes life a problem when it comes to holding a job or falling in love. Early on though he meets Clarie (Rachel McAdams)as a child in a field near her family's home. It seems that while Henry may randomly pass through time he at least goes to places that are somehow important to him acting like gravity's pull giving him a tether regardless of whether he's in the past, present or future. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" tells the story of their difficult love affair, marriage and life.We all often can feel like we drop in and out of our own lives but Henry doesn't have a choice because he can't control his condition. Luckily, he finds someone who can provide him with unconditional love even as he faces hiccups and disagreements with his wife over having a child (that might possibly inherit the defect)or even having a life together.MAJOR SPOILER PARAGRAPH:Directed by Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan""), ""Wife"" begins to fall apart when it isn't consistent to it's own internal logic (how can he travel outside of his own lifetime during the two incidents that he witnesses? The only reason I can surmise is that his daughter who DOES learn to control her ability to move randomly through time somehow wills him to appear outside of his own life (since the two times he moves forward outside his own lifetime are moments exhibit some unusual characteristics it's the only possibility aside from dramatic license that I can think of). Those two points to stretch the film's own internal logic and rules that it establishes but if you're willing to overlook these two missteps you'll enjoy ""The Time Traveler's Wife"".END OF SPOILER PARAGRAPH:Director Schewntke does a good job of creating a warm and comfortable atmosphere for the two unlikely lovers in the film and the screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Last Mimsy"")manages to include the important events/moments from the original novel and stay relatively true to Audrey Niffenegger characters. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a delightful, moving and touching story that will resonante with you. Is it perfectly told or logical? Nope but go with it and you'll enjoy it.Extras include a 25 minute featurette is included as an extra although it's a bit disappointing that we don't get a commentary track on the making. We also get a featurette on the difficulty of adaptating the novel to film.The Blu-ray looks extremely good with nice detail and color reproduction.",4,"Entertaining romantic science fiction film that reminds me of a bit of ""Time After Time""",1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2763,"['many', 'do', 'occupy', 'space', 'special', 'space', 'occupy', 'someone', 'life', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'based', 'popular', 'novel', 'focuses', 'Henry', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'man', 'permanently', 'unstuck', 'time', 'born', 'genetic', 'defect', 'move', 'time', 'unpredictably', 'life', 'problem', 'when', 'holding', 'job', 'falling', 'love', 'Early', 'Clarie', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'child', 'field', 'family', 'home', 'Henry', 'may', 'randomly', 'pass', 'time', 'least', 'places', 'are', 'somehow', 'important', 'acting', 'gravity', 'pull', 'giving', 'tether', 'regardless', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'story', 'difficult', 'love', 'affair', 'marriage', 'life.We', 'often', 'can', 'feel', 'drop', 'own', 'lives', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'condition', 'Luckily', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'unconditional', 'love', 'even', 'hiccups', 'disagreements', 'wife', 'having', 'child', 'might', 'possibly', 'inherit', 'defect', 'even', 'having', 'life', 'together.MAJOR', 'SPOILER', 'PARAGRAPH', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'Flightplan', 'Wife', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'how', 'can', 'travel', 'own', 'lifetime', 'two', 'incidents', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'surmise', 'daughter', 'who', 'learn', 'control', 'ability', 'move', 'randomly', 'time', 'somehow', 'appear', 'own', 'life', 'two', 'times', 'forward', 'own', 'lifetime', 'are', 'moments', 'exhibit', 'unusual', 'characteristics', 'only', 'possibility', 'aside', 'dramatic', 'license', 'can', 'think', 'two', 'points', 'stretch', 'film', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'rules', ""'re"", 'willing', 'overlook', 'two', 'missteps', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', '.END', 'OF', 'SPOILER', 'PARAGRAPH', 'Director', 'Schewntke', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'warm', 'comfortable', 'atmosphere', 'two', 'unlikely', 'lovers', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'Ghost', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'Last', 'Mimsy', 'include', 'important', 'events/moments', 'original', 'novel', 'stay', 'relatively', 'true', 'Audrey', 'Niffenegger', 'characters', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'delightful', 'moving', 'touching', 'story', 'will', 'resonante', 'perfectly', 'told', 'logical', 'Nope', 'go', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.Extras', 'include', '25', 'minute', 'featurette', 'included', 'extra', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'making', 'also', 'get', 'featurette', 'difficulty', 'adaptating', 'novel', 'film.The', 'Blu-ray', 'extremely', 'good', 'nice', 'detail', 'color', 'reproduction']",N/A
