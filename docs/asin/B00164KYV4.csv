1151924,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B00164KYV4,A. Boston,"[4, 9]","I really wanted to see this movie. I did briefly peruse the book, though I personally never needed someone to slap me and say ""He's just not that into you!"". The pessimist in me always assumed the worst anyway. But none the less, the book was definitely funny.  I had seen the preview for this and like a lot of people in it. I was not disappointed! It seems people either liked or hated this movie, I fall into the like category. It kept my attention from beginning to end, which is very hard to do, I inevitably will be reaching for my computer to browse around online 8 times out of 10.Some people find too many characters confusing, but these ones all were very distinct and no one over shadowed the other. Some of the relationships are fun and flirty, others seem destined to end. People have compared it to 'love,actually', though I personally didn't see any similarities besides the multiple 'relationships'. 'He's just not that into you' centered more around late 20's and 30's age people, I think 'love, actually' spanned a larger age range and not only were dating and married, but deaths, divorce and families. No one in this flick had families with their partner yet.I think it's definitely worth checking it out, especially if you've dated and gotten mixed signals. You'll find lots of ""oh god, that's just like me!"" moments, both embarrassing and just plain true to life. Gigi, the narrator, is constantly reading too much into the actions of her dates and always convinced, sure maybe they like her but they're just getting side tracked from calling her. This story line alone was very cute and funny, on the other end of the spectrum there's a married couple having issues as well as a couple who has been together for 7 years and the girl is wondering ""why won't he marry me??""Great, fun movies to check out with the girls.

A girlfriend of mine forced me to sit through this the first time by withholding popcorn and kettle chips. Smart girl.I've watched this several times since, by choice, on my own. It's just an honestly funny movie about dating and relationships. It spans all through first dates to marriage, from hot, artsy chicks to girls next door, suave guys to pricks. There are sketches during random parts of the film of impromptu moments of regular people (and famous people) commenting on a particular theme- &#34;when she won't sleep with you...&#34; and things like that. Genius. It's a great way to make the film even more tangible on a realistic level.I'm not the biggest fan of some of the actors in this, but the writing and directing of this far surpass any issues I have with actors. So even if you hate the color pink, or refuse to drop your metallica collection from your ipod, just take a night and watch this, even if it's in private.

1151934,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00164KYV4,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","First the good. This movie has some interesting characters that you end up caring about by the end. It's a watchable movie that has some engaging dialog and even some lighthearted scenes. It's supposed to center around signals people give off and the difficulties in relationships. It's done in a somewhat unique way by having narration that pokes fun of dating and relationship stereotypes between scenes. The story itself revolves around an ensemble of characters, many of whom are friends, relatives or colleagues of each other. There are a number of relationship story lines, some of which end up happy and some that don't. All in all this is a fairly well-acted movie that has basically no scenes that make you cringe.All of this being said, there were a couple of things I didn't like so much about the movie. First of all, the initial scenes were a bit confusing because the characters and their relationships were not well-introduced. It took a while to sort out who was who. Second, with such a large cast, some of the story-lines and characters seemed almost peripheral and excessive. There was a whole subplot with a sister of one of the main characters that was not very well-developed or meaningful to the main plot. As with many movies like this, you wonder if maybe a few less subplots might have allowed the remaining ones to be a little better-developed. Finally, while this is par for the course in a romantic-type movie, you could see the results of a few of the story lines coming a mile a way. Probably the most engaging relationship is the one between the girl who has most of the issues and the bartender who is supposed to be not at all interested but becomes a good friend. It's fairly obvious in their first scene that they will end up together in the end and they do.This movie is worth checking out if you like romantic movies. You will probably end up feeling like it was very similar to other movies you've seen, but it's still quite well-done and enjoyable.",3,Watchable but not great,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,1988,"['First', 'good', 'movie', 'interesting', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'end', 'watchable', 'movie', 'engaging', 'dialog', 'even', 'lighthearted', 'scenes', 'supposed', 'center', 'around', 'signals', 'people', 'give', 'difficulties', 'relationships', 'done', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'way', 'having', 'narration', 'fun', 'dating', 'relationship', 'stereotypes', 'scenes', 'story', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'friends', 'relatives', 'colleagues', 'other', 'are', 'number', 'relationship', 'story', 'lines', 'end', 'up', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'All', 'fairly', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'basically', 'scenes', 'make', 'cringe.All', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'First', 'all', 'initial', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'confusing', 'characters', 'relationships', 'were', 'not', 'well-introduced', 'took', 'while', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'Second', 'large', 'cast', 'story-lines', 'characters', 'seemed', 'almost', 'peripheral', 'excessive', 'was', 'whole', 'subplot', 'sister', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well-developed', 'meaningful', 'main', 'plot', 'many', 'movies', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'few', 'less', 'subplots', 'might', 'have', 'allowed', 'remaining', 'ones', 'be', 'little', 'better-developed', 'Finally', 'par', 'course', 'romantic-type', 'movie', 'could', 'see', 'results', 'few', 'story', 'lines', 'coming', 'mile', 'way', 'Probably', 'most', 'engaging', 'relationship', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'most', 'issues', 'bartender', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'not', 'all', 'interested', 'good', 'friend', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'first', 'scene', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'do.This', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'like', 'romantic', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'quite', 'well-done', 'enjoyable']",He's Just Not That Into You

1151939,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00164KYV4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`He's Just Not That Into You' is proof positive that it takes more than good looks and star power to make a good movie.  It takes even more than talent, which all of these actresses actually have, to make a good movie.  It takes chemistry (haven't I said this before) and it takes at least a certain level of intelligence.  `He's Just Not That Into You' lacks a lot of chemistry, which is surprising considering the cast, and it also plays things rather ignorant, which creates a very stupefied film that fails to live up to what it promised to deliver.It's funny, because the film thinks it's really smart; but it's not.Instead of attempting to flesh out the real drama of finding that special someone, the film pretty much throws everything at us with reckless abandonment and hopes that something, anything, is going to stick.  You have the cheating husband, the `just friends', the desperately single leech, the `living together but never getting married' and then you have the men and women who filter in and out of their lives.  Some actresses (and or actors) grab a hold of their roles better than other, but overall the experience is far too sporadic and unorganized to make any real impact.If you are looking at this film for any other purpose other than brainless entertainment then you should look elsewhere.I didn't expect this movie to be genius, for it is a romantic comedy, but I did expect it to have some sort of guidance.  It just seemed rather haphazard the way they just through scenario after scenario at us and then claimed to resolve it all with the wise words of a womanizer (since when is Justin Long a womanizer?).  It just makes no sense.And yet it was still, in some ways, enjoyable.A whose-who of talented actresses line the cast; from the ever-so-lovely Scarlett Johansson to the underrated and totally lovable Ginnifer Goodwin to Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston and even Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, not to mention Ben Affleck, Kevin Connelly and new heartthrob Bradley Cooper.  Even Kris Kristofferson shows up here!  Of the cast, Aniston and Connelly take the acting cake for me; especially Connelly who understands how to infuse the right amount of humor into her despair to make her frustrated wife believable.  I really wish that Scarlett Johansson would stop getting typecast as the flirtatious man-eater.  Yes, she is the most beautiful woman on the planet and every man wants to `get' with her, me included, but she has so much talent that it is being wasted on roles beneath her.  Goodwin, I just adore, but here she is just annoying.  I think it is more her character, but she really could have made her character at least relatable.  She's just messy here.  Barrymore is underused (she is such a luminous presence I wish she were in everything) here, and the film almost seems uninterested in her.If you want a brainless comedy that has some laughs, some tears and some entertainment value, or if you are a die-hard fan of any of the ladies in the cast, then by all means did in; but if you want something with a little more meat then you should look elsewhere.",3,"Despite the impressive cast, I'm just not that `into' this movie...",1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,3130,"['Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'proof', 'positive', 'more', 'good', 'looks', 'star', 'power', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'talent', 'actresses', 'actually', 'have', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'have', ""n't"", 'said', 'before', 'least', 'certain', 'level', 'intelligence', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'surprising', 'considering', 'cast', 'also', 'things', 'rather', 'ignorant', 'very', 'stupefied', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'promised', 'deliver.It', 'funny', 'film', 'really', 'smart', 'not.Instead', 'attempting', 'flesh', 'out', 'real', 'drama', 'finding', 'special', 'someone', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'throws', 'everything', 'reckless', 'abandonment', 'something', 'anything', 'going', 'stick', 'have', 'cheating', 'husband', 'just', 'friends', 'desperately', 'single', 'leech', 'living', 'together', 'never', 'getting', 'married', 'then', 'have', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'filter', 'lives', 'actresses', 'actors', 'grab', 'hold', 'roles', 'better', 'other', 'experience', 'far', 'too', 'sporadic', 'unorganized', 'make', 'real', 'impact.If', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'other', 'purpose', 'other', 'brainless', 'entertainment', 'then', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'genius', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'did', 'expect', 'have', 'sort', 'guidance', 'just', 'seemed', 'rather', 'haphazard', 'way', 'just', 'scenario', 'scenario', 'then', 'claimed', 'resolve', 'wise', 'words', 'womanizer', 'when', 'Justin', 'Long', 'womanizer', 'just', 'sense.And', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'ways', 'enjoyable.A', 'whose-who', 'talented', 'actresses', 'line', 'cast', 'ever-so-lovely', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'underrated', 'totally', 'lovable', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Hollywood', 'A-listers', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'even', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'not', 'mention', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Kevin', 'Connelly', 'new', 'heartthrob', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Even', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'up', 'here', 'cast', 'Aniston', 'Connelly', 'take', 'acting', 'cake', 'especially', 'Connelly', 'who', 'how', 'infuse', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'despair', 'make', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'believable', 'really', 'wish', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'would', 'stop', 'getting', 'typecast', 'flirtatious', 'man-eater', 'Yes', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'planet', 'man', 'get', 'included', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'being', 'wasted', 'roles', 'Goodwin', 'just', 'adore', 'here', 'just', 'annoying', 'think', 'more', 'character', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'least', 'relatable', 'just', 'messy', 'here', 'Barrymore', 'underused', 'such', 'luminous', 'presence', 'wish', 'were', 'everything', 'here', 'film', 'almost', 'uninterested', 'her.If', 'want', 'brainless', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'tears', 'entertainment', 'value', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'ladies', 'cast', 'then', 'means', 'did', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'meat', 'then', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere']",He's Just Not That Into You

But sometimes they're kinda tricky, many great actor and a good director but suddenly it's way overrated (which I don't understand how come they waste all that talents) but not in this one. People kinda harsh to this movie, I guess that they expect a simple feel good chick flick, or romantic comedy, as usual. This one is more of a serious romantic drama with a little bit humor like in real life, so I found it amazing. Real life opinion (not the ones they put on purpose between each written explanation, ex : ""if he never calls you"" then some guy or girl talks.. no .. not that one), the story itself is telling us about relationship, how to find and maintain one, in a great storytelling style, it's kinda slow at the beginning but it's all worthied to be watched and learned from. Some little real life comedy here and there, but overall it's a great drama about realtionships. All the actors, actresses and the director are doing a great job.If you are trying to find or in a relationship, this movie is totally worthwatching. Trust me. If you are a chick flick regular, probably you won;t find this one as fun as other chick flick or romantic comedy (because  this is more of a drama). I like it a lot.

They are broken up for the majority of the film, and no one, including the actors played by Aniston and Affleck, are quite sure why.

1151942,AC4XV78EJG1QB,B00164KYV4,Anne,"[3, 4]","It's interesting to me that there were so many bad reviews for this movie and that people thought it was so horrible.  It is one of the first Romantic Comedy movies in a long time that I just smiled at the end.  There was a realness for me to the stories in the movie.  I think that so often people want to deny how many (not all) men and women are wired and what they do.  I've heard stories like the ones in this movie.  In fact, although my husband and I didn't live together before we got married and we met and married in 6 months, there is a scene in the movie that reminded me of just how my husband proposed to me.  A few weeks ago he was telling me about how he'd shared our story with someone and it sounded so romantic.  But, it was a long time ago and I hadn't thought of it that way in a long time.  But, this movie reminded me of why it was romantic.  The scene in this movie was romantic.And I loved the ending.  A lot of people seemed to not like Gigi's character, but I've known a lot of women like her and when I was single, I know I wanted to call guys who didn't call.  I even got stood up twice by a guy once.  I genuinely thought he had just forgotten the first time.  I didn't really think he'd show up the second time.  It happens to everyone.  And I went on a lot of dates when I was single--I wasn't desperate or chasing any guys, but it does happen that you get stood up or misled.I think one of the greatest strengths of this movie is that most romantic movies and books make it seem as if being married and in a relationship is the answer to everything.  The ending to this movie makes it clear in a good way that it's not.  My mom always told me that it's better not to be married, than to be married to the wrong person--she didn't mean that you should just leave someone if you're unhappy, but that just wanting to get married isn't a good reason to get married--if it isn't the right person.  She also gave me another piece of advice--that when you're on your own, you can't run away from yourself--you have to face who you are.All that said, I did fast forward a few of the sex scenes because I just didn't want to watch them.  I just didn't enjoy watching Scarlett Johanssen's character and her storyline--I'm glad they deleted the scenes that they did.Give this movie a chance, it's a lot better than the title sounds.",5,Surprisingly good...,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2354,"['interesting', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'one', 'first', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'just', 'smiled', 'end', 'was', 'realness', 'stories', 'movie', 'think', 'so', 'often', 'people', 'want', 'deny', 'how', 'many', 'not', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'wired', 'what', 'do', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'stories', 'ones', 'movie', 'fact', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'together', 'got', 'married', 'met', 'married', '6', 'months', 'scene', 'movie', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'husband', 'proposed', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'telling', 'how', ""'d"", 'shared', 'story', 'someone', 'sounded', 'so', 'romantic', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'way', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'reminded', 'why', 'was', 'romantic', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'romantic.And', 'loved', 'ending', 'lot', 'people', 'seemed', 'not', 'Gigi', 'character', ""'ve"", 'known', 'lot', 'women', 'when', 'was', 'single', 'know', 'wanted', 'call', 'guys', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'even', 'got', 'stood', 'up', 'twice', 'guy', 'once', 'genuinely', 'thought', 'had', 'just', 'forgotten', 'first', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', ""'d"", 'show', 'up', 'second', 'time', 'everyone', 'went', 'lot', 'dates', 'when', 'was', 'single', 'was', ""n't"", 'desperate', 'chasing', 'guys', 'happen', 'get', 'stood', 'up', 'misled.I', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'movie', 'most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'books', 'make', 'seem', 'being', 'married', 'relationship', 'answer', 'everything', 'ending', 'movie', 'clear', 'good', 'way', 'not', 'mom', 'always', 'told', 'better', 'not', 'be', 'married', 'be', 'married', 'wrong', 'person', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'just', 'leave', 'someone', ""'re"", 'unhappy', 'just', 'wanting', 'get', 'married', ""n't"", 'good', 'reason', 'get', 'married', ""n't"", 'right', 'person', 'also', 'gave', 'piece', 'advice', 'when', ""'re"", 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'have', 'face', 'who', 'are.All', 'said', 'did', 'fast', 'forward', 'few', 'sex', 'scenes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'character', 'storyline', ""'m"", 'glad', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'did.Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'lot', 'better', 'title']",He's Just Not That Into You

1151946,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00164KYV4,barry,"[1, 2]","I love this film.  I saw it first as a rental and immediately purchased it.  I have viewed it an additional 3 times since.  Peope try to label this film but that is something you can't do.  It is a film that while following the lives of many people educates the viewer on why guys do what they do when dating.  Many say this is definitely not a date movie.  I totally disagree.  Unless you have tried some of the antics in the film on the date you are with you will share many laughs at what people go through when dating.The first thing I did find I had to adjust to was not only all the characters lives intersecting in some way but also the fact that every character was a big name star.  After getting over that and then seeing the characters for who they were it was smooth sailing.  I thought the film did an amazing job of making six separate storylines intertwine and be believable, not forced or over the top.  The main story that all flows from is the storyline between Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long.  They both shine and keep the film anchored.  I also found the storyline between Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck very touching.  It was a very real situation that many couples face.  Jennifer Aniston brought an amazing depth to her role and made me scream for her to finally get the ideal role that would show all her potential.Viewers will have their favorite storylines and favorite characters based on which stars they like and also which situations they may have faced in their own lives.  I thought each actor was given great moments to shine both dramatically and comicly.  Jennifer Connelly is a hoot with her obsession over cigarettes and Drew Barrymore is charming.  Bottom line for me, this film is a very witty intelligent story that educates on dating in the current age.  The writing and direction is superb and provides the actors firm ground to soar.  This movie made me laugh.  This movie made me tear up as well and I am a 46 year old guy.  Could this be a date movie?  You bet.And the blu ray version is a feast for the eyes.  The 1080p high def picture is so crystal clear and vibrant.  Colors are crisp and flesh tones perfection.  There is no grain and the picture is just as detailed in the day and night scenes.  As for the audio, this is a dialogue driven film and the audio presentation works perfectly.This movie is a treat.  It is so nice to see an intelligent comedy for a change and you will love seeing your favorite stars have a ball with the script.  You will also discover some new favorite stars.  For me I had no idea who Bradley Cooper was.  I was thinking this guy was great with nice comedic timing and then he is suddenly out there with THE HANGOVER and becoming a true star.

1151950,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B00164KYV4,Brandon Cozart,"[0, 0]","Dating is, perhaps, the oldest game there is.  We all play it at some point, devoting countless hours and resources to it, only to fail a majority of the time.  We enlist the help of others--friends, books, websites, seminars, etc.--but even with such help we still end up utterly lost.  There doesn't seem to be a fixed set of rules, and when we think we've found a set, countless exceptions pop up and throw said ""rules"" out the window.  Aiding and abetting our frustrated attempts are well-meaning friends who encourage us through assurances of our likeability, our attractiveness, the other person's stupidity, etc.  So why do we continue to play this game?  We play in hopes of finding that ever-elusive thing called love.It is into this eternal fracas that the filmmakers of He's Just Not That Into You cast their audience.  This is the story of nine intertwining lives, each person's tale adding another layer to the complexity of relationships that we all encounter day to day.  This film boasts an all-star cast and, for the most part, does not disappoint.  It is charming, funny, dramatic, shocking, and incredibly honest.  A rare find in a ""romantic comedy"" genre so often riddled with puerile vapidity.Though a story of nine lives, the central story guiding the film is that of Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a hopeless romantic who spends much of her time pining by a phone hoping her latest date will call.  As tends to happen in such circumstances, Gigi is patronized and coddled by her girlfriends who attempt to assuage her fears of being rejected and alone.  Then Gigi meets Alex (Justin Long), a straight-shooting bar manager who opens Gigi's eyes to the difference between what men tell her and what they really mean.  This includes the shocking reality that sometimes guys just aren't into the girls they go on dates with.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this as everyone can't be ""the One,"" it's just a fact that needs to be accepted and dealt with.The rest of the film deals primarily with stereotypes:  the obsessive compulsive wife, the pompous jackass who finds it hard to believe that marriage means he can only sleep with one person for the rest of his life, the sultry libertine who lures him away, the guy who ""doesn't believe in marriage,"" the woman who's been with him for nearly a decade hoping he'll change his mind, and of course those who are looking for love in all the wrong places/faces/online profiles.  But even though these characters are stereotypes, they are believable and done very well.  All of us know people exactly like the ones portrayed on screen and so we are able to connect with, and probably even empathize, with what is transpiring before our eyes.All in all, this film is quite enjoyable and I appreciate the honest way in which relationships are portrayed by the filmmakers.  It's refreshing to see a ""chick flick"" which actually has some basis in reality and does not fit the typical ""girl meets guy, they fall in love, fight and break up, get back together, and live happily ever after"" formula that typifies the genre.  Inevitably, some will not like what they see on screen and will claim it's too harsh on certain types of people.  My only response to that would be:  the truth sometimes hurts.Video/AudioThe Blu-ray disc is presented in full 1080p in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent and really brings out the vibrant colors used throughout the film.  The audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is very crisp.  This is mostly a talking movie, so it's hard to really evaluate the sound, but I had absolutely no complaints about the quality.Special FeaturesThere are a number of special features included on the Blu-ray disc.  These include deleted scenes with commentary by the director, a featurette on translating the book into the film, and an interesting look into how film directors stage such seemingly extemporaneous scenes as phone calls.  The most interesting special feature for me personally are six mini-interviews with the characters of the film showing how their lives have changed since the conclusion of the film.  Very interesting way to continue the story and brings a further sense of realness to the lives of the characters.",4,"A refreshingly honest look into dating, relationships, and what people really mean by ""I'll call you""",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,4217,"['Dating', 'perhaps', 'oldest', 'game', 'play', 'point', 'devoting', 'countless', 'hours', 'resources', 'only', 'fail', 'majority', 'time', 'enlist', 'help', 'others', 'friends', 'books', 'websites', 'seminars', 'etc.', 'even', 'such', 'help', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'utterly', 'lost', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'fixed', 'set', 'rules', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'found', 'set', 'countless', 'exceptions', 'pop', 'up', 'throw', 'said', 'rules', 'window', 'Aiding', 'abetting', 'frustrated', 'attempts', 'are', 'well-meaning', 'friends', 'who', 'encourage', 'assurances', 'likeability', 'attractiveness', 'other', 'person', 'stupidity', 'etc', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'continue', 'play', 'game', 'play', 'hopes', 'finding', 'ever-elusive', 'thing', 'called', 'love.It', 'eternal', 'fracas', 'filmmakers', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'cast', 'audience', 'story', 'nine', 'intertwining', 'lives', 'person', 'tale', 'adding', 'layer', 'complexity', 'relationships', 'encounter', 'day', 'day', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'disappoint', 'charming', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'shocking', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'rare', 'find', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'so', 'often', 'riddled', 'puerile', 'story', 'nine', 'lives', 'central', 'story', 'guiding', 'film', 'Gigi', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'pining', 'phone', 'hoping', 'latest', 'date', 'will', 'call', 'tends', 'happen', 'such', 'circumstances', 'Gigi', 'patronized', 'coddled', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'attempt', 'assuage', 'fears', 'being', 'rejected', 'alone', 'Then', 'Gigi', 'meets', 'Alex', 'Justin', 'Long', 'straight-shooting', 'bar', 'manager', 'who', 'Gigi', 'eyes', 'difference', 'what', 'men', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'mean', 'shocking', 'reality', 'sometimes', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'girls', 'go', 'dates', 'nothing', 'necessarily', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'One', 'just', 'fact', 'be', 'accepted', 'dealt', 'with.The', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'primarily', 'stereotypes', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'wife', 'pompous', 'jackass', 'who', 'hard', 'believe', 'marriage', 'can', 'only', 'sleep', 'one', 'person', 'rest', 'life', 'sultry', 'libertine', 'who', 'away', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'marriage', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'nearly', 'decade', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind', 'course', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places/faces/online', 'profiles', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'believable', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'know', 'people', 'exactly', 'ones', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'are', 'able', 'connect', 'probably', 'even', 'empathize', 'what', 'transpiring', 'eyes.All', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'appreciate', 'honest', 'way', 'relationships', 'are', 'portrayed', 'filmmakers', 'refreshing', 'see', 'chick', 'flick', 'actually', 'basis', 'reality', 'not', 'fit', 'typical', 'girl', 'meets', 'guy', 'fall', 'love', 'fight', 'break', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'formula', 'genre', 'Inevitably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'will', 'claim', 'too', 'harsh', 'certain', 'types', 'people', 'only', 'response', 'would', 'be', 'truth', 'sometimes', 'hurts.Video/AudioThe', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'presented', 'full', '1080p', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'picture', 'excellent', 'really', 'out', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'used', 'film', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'very', 'crisp', 'mostly', 'talking', 'movie', 'hard', 'really', 'evaluate', 'sound', 'had', 'absolutely', 'complaints', 'quality.Special', 'FeaturesThere', 'are', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'director', 'featurette', 'translating', 'book', 'film', 'interesting', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'directors', 'stage', 'such', 'seemingly', 'extemporaneous', 'scenes', 'phone', 'calls', 'most', 'interesting', 'special', 'feature', 'personally', 'are', 'six', 'mini-interviews', 'characters', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Very', 'interesting', 'way', 'continue', 'story', 'further', 'sense', 'realness', 'lives', 'characters']",He's Just Not That Into You

It's got charm, wit, sweetness, enough embarrassing moments to make you fall in love twice!  Yeah, it has some (just a tiny bit) educational value if you want to go there but it's a chick flick first.  Just to comment on that note, I've only heard of the book and skimmed through it at the bookstore but from what I can see, the movie covers the basic truths in the book.  The movie centers around the dating life of Gigi (played absolutely adorably by Ginnifer Goodwin) and then through the couples that surround Gigi.  The relationships covered in the movie include: desperately dating, married, almost married, kind of dating, secretly dating and cluelessly dating.  That's covered'em all, right?  I'd like to comment on all the beautiful casts like the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, rigid and hilarious (yes, she's hilarious!)  Jennifer Connelly and countless others but my heart must go out to Ginnifer Goodwin and I'm woman enough to admit that I have at one time or another went through what she goes through in the movie - which, of course, made me root for her even more (Watch the movie ladies and you'll know what I'm talking about).  This girl makes all the right mistakes but here's the big catch - it all ends well.

1151956,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00164KYV4,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[3, 4]","This is an ensemble piece with three different couplings-uncouplings at its core.  The two which were quite good and enjoyable are those with Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly).  The one I didn't like or believe was Beth (Jennifer Aniston).I don't get the popularity of Jennifer Aniston in the movies.  I find her completely unconvincing both in this movie and her other movies.  It has gotten so bad for me with her that I now skip any movie she is in.  The only thing more tiresome than her movie romances are her real world romances.  Because I like Goodwin and Connelly a lot though, I couldn't skip this movie. Aniston is why this film lost a star for me.  I found her romance with Affleck totally unbelievable and I couldn't picture these two getting married.......ever.Otherwise, the moral of the movie is, ""If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you"".  There is so much truth in this statement and also in the accompanying statement that we woman do not want to hear this truth.  We also don't want our gal pals to hear it so lie to them about how ""he must really be into her"".  Ha!At the opposite end of the spectrum is the movie's heart, Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin).  I've been watching Goodwin on  BIG LOVE on HBO and she has been quite good in that series as a polygamous Mormon wife. Gigi is the one who wears her heart on her sleeve and usually scares the guys off.  Making things worse, her best friends, Aniston and Connelly, always convince her that the guy must really be into her and that he will call.  They should instead be telling her to wear her heart less on her sleeve and not to be so optimistic.  You worry though that if they did tell her this that she might lose a good deal of her charm and appeal. A street wise bar owner (Justin Long) sets her straight on why and when she will not hear back from certain men.It is easy to believe that Jennifer Connelly is the one with an Oscar for her acting as she has the toughest role in the movie.

1151978,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00164KYV4,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","I think director Ken Kwapis and co-screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein are trying to make a comic Shakespearean roundelay out of the best-selling2004 self-help bookby Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, but this soapish 2009 comedy never quite takes flight because of the predictable nature of the multiple storylines. At 129 minutes, it also runs way too long given its singular focus on the romantic predicaments of the nine principals in the cast. Not too surprisingly, the whole venture feels like an extended episode ofSex and the Citywith well-known actors who appear to have divergent takes on what the movie is really about. There are four separate storylines to track, and they're all tethered to Gigi, an emotionally insecure twenty-something who takes her shallow bar conversations with men so seriously that she constantly waits for them to follow up. She had high hopes for Conor, a real estate agent who never calls her back, but she then finds an unexpected dating coach in his best friend Alex, a promiscuous bar owner who cynically teaches her how to read the signs of non-interest.Meanwhile, Janine, one of Gigi's co-workers, feels something is going awry in her marriage to Ben as she busies herself renovating their home. He accidentally meets comely yoga instructor and aspiring singer Anna at the local supermarket, and they embark on a clandestine affair against their better judgment. Gigi's other co-worker Beth has been living monogamously with Neil, a photographer, for seven years, and marriage doesn't appear in the cards. They break up due to his lack of desire to get married, but a near-tragedy at Beth's younger sister's wedding makes them reconsider their relationship. Providing a full circle to the film's structure, the fourth plot has Anna rebuffing the serious overtures of an enamored Conor as she considers her situation with Ben, while her friend Mary, a newspaper editor who faces a similar predicament as Gigi, finds a connection with Conor when he starts advertising his business in her paper.It's really the pat treatment of the intertwining characters that trivializes the movie into something just a little deeper than a TV commercial. Had there been more focus on one of the stories, say Gigi and Alex's, with the rest relegated to minor subplots, then the movie could have possibly resonated more. The cast is certainly attractive enough, but I wouldn't say they are ideally compatible as an ensemble. Ginnifer Goodwin (the youngest wife on HBO'sBig Love) has to play up Gigi's eager nervousness at such an excitable level that her neediness starts to feel too one-note. As lothario-in-love Alex, Justin Long (yes, the Apple guy) seems miscast in a swinger role that would have been a better fit for Bradley Cooper (The Hangover), who plays Ben. Even more, the friends-to-lovers relationship between him and Goodwin never feels quite authentic enough to sustain the story arc it needs to support. Initially, it was nice to see Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) in a lighter role than her usual sturm und drang, but as Janine recognizes her husband's adultery, she bears the burden of the film's most dramatic episode.As Ben, Cooper is merely called upon to look guilty for most of his screen time, that is, when he is not being seduced by the sultry charms of Scarlett Johansson as Anna. After her work for Woody Allen, she seems particularly on automatic pilot here and not very challenged by the role. Kevin Connolly (HBO'sEntourage) plays Conor in a way that forces him to waver between boyish and selfish. Perhaps due to their tabloid overexposure, Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck at first don't seem to mesh well with the others, but as the story progresses, both turn in surprisingly sympathetic work as Beth and Neil. Rounding out the cast is executive producer Drew Barrymore, who plays Mary as a comic wallflower confused by the complicated impact of communications technology on dating. The 2009 DVD is fairly bare-bones containing both the widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. There is a handful of deleted scenes with optional commentary from Kwapis, although it seems like a surprising omission not to have his insights included on an optional commentary track for the film itself.",3,By-the-Numbers Ensemble Piece Focusing on Foibles in Dating and Longer Lasting Relationships,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,4265,"['think', 'director', 'Ken', 'Kwapis', 'co-screenwriters', 'Abby', 'Kohn', 'Marc', 'Silverstein', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'comic', 'Shakespearean', 'roundelay', 'best-selling2004', 'self-help', 'bookby', 'Greg', 'Behrendt', 'Liz', 'Tuccillo', 'soapish', '2009', 'comedy', 'never', 'quite', 'flight', 'predictable', 'nature', 'multiple', 'storylines', '129', 'minutes', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'given', 'singular', 'focus', 'romantic', 'predicaments', 'nine', 'principals', 'cast', 'Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'whole', 'venture', 'feels', 'extended', 'episode', 'ofSex', 'Citywith', 'well-known', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'have', 'divergent', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'are', 'four', 'separate', 'storylines', 'track', ""'re"", 'tethered', 'Gigi', 'emotionally', 'insecure', 'twenty-something', 'who', 'shallow', 'bar', 'conversations', 'men', 'so', 'seriously', 'constantly', 'follow', 'up', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Conor', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'never', 'back', 'then', 'unexpected', 'dating', 'coach', 'best', 'friend', 'Alex', 'promiscuous', 'bar', 'owner', 'who', 'cynically', 'how', 'read', 'signs', 'non-interest.Meanwhile', 'Janine', 'one', 'Gigi', 'co-workers', 'feels', 'something', 'going', 'awry', 'marriage', 'Ben', 'renovating', 'home', 'accidentally', 'comely', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Anna', 'local', 'supermarket', 'embark', 'clandestine', 'affair', 'better', 'judgment', 'Gigi', 'other', 'co-worker', 'Beth', 'been', 'living', 'monogamously', 'Neil', 'photographer', 'seven', 'years', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'appear', 'cards', 'break', 'up', 'due', 'lack', 'desire', 'get', 'married', 'near-tragedy', 'Beth', 'younger', 'sister', 'wedding', 'reconsider', 'relationship', 'Providing', 'full', 'circle', 'film', 'structure', 'fourth', 'plot', 'Anna', 'rebuffing', 'serious', 'overtures', 'enamored', 'Conor', 'situation', 'Ben', 'friend', 'Mary', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'who', 'similar', 'predicament', 'Gigi', 'connection', 'Conor', 'when', 'advertising', 'business', 'paper.It', 'really', 'pat', 'treatment', 'intertwining', 'characters', 'movie', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'deeper', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Had', 'been', 'more', 'focus', 'one', 'stories', 'say', 'Gigi', 'Alex', 'rest', 'relegated', 'minor', 'subplots', 'then', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'resonated', 'more', 'cast', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'enough', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'ideally', 'compatible', 'ensemble', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'youngest', 'wife', ""HBO'sBig"", 'Love', 'play', 'up', 'Gigi', 'eager', 'nervousness', 'excitable', 'level', 'neediness', 'feel', 'too', 'one-note', 'lothario-in-love', 'Alex', 'Justin', 'Long', 'yes', 'Apple', 'guy', 'miscast', 'swinger', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fit', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Hangover', 'who', 'Ben', 'Even', 'more', 'friends-to-lovers', 'relationship', 'Goodwin', 'never', 'quite', 'authentic', 'enough', 'sustain', 'story', 'support', 'Initially', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'lighter', 'role', 'usual', 'sturm', 'und', 'drang', 'Janine', 'husband', 'adultery', 'burden', 'film', 'most', 'dramatic', 'episode.As', 'Ben', 'Cooper', 'merely', 'called', 'upon', 'look', 'guilty', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'not', 'being', 'seduced', 'sultry', 'charms', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Anna', 'work', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'particularly', 'automatic', 'pilot', 'here', 'not', 'very', 'challenged', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', ""HBO'sEntourage"", 'Conor', 'way', 'waver', 'boyish', 'selfish', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'tabloid', 'overexposure', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mesh', 'well', 'others', 'story', 'turn', 'surprisingly', 'sympathetic', 'work', 'Beth', 'Neil', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'executive', 'producer', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'Mary', 'comic', 'wallflower', 'confused', 'complicated', 'impact', 'communications', 'technology', 'dating', '2009', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'bare-bones', 'containing', 'widescreen', 'full-screen', 'versions', 'film', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Kwapis', 'surprising', 'omission', 'not', 'have', 'insights', 'included', 'optional', 'commentary', 'track', 'film']",He's Just Not That Into You

The message is that if a guy isn't interested in you (even if that guy is your husband), it's best to accept that and move on.  If you press on trying to get him to like you (which is what the women and one man did in this movie), you end up looking pathetic to your love interest and to yourself.Justin Long plays kind of an informant to women everywhere what a guy really means when he says he's going to call, he gives you his card, he tells you he's going out of town, etc...  Although I think it's good for women to know this info, I also think it lets men off the hook.  A better message might be to tell men if they're not interested in a woman, then have the courage and decency to tell her in a tactful, but also clear, way so she doesn't get any mixed messages.  Leading a woman on that you're not interested in, just so you can feel like a good guy, is cruel.I would've preferred a better leading actress for this movie.  It's not like she was terrible, but her emotions did come across as fake and forced.  I also thought I was supposed to feel a certain way about certain characters, but I didn't.For example, I got the feeling I was supposed to think Ben Affleck's character was a jerk for not wanting to marry Jennifer Aniston's character, but I didn't.  Instead I saw him as someone who was scared and needing to question things out.  With such a high divorce rate, it makes sense to question the institution.  It would be one thing if this guy was just a player stringing her along, but he wasn't.  It seemed like he really did love her.I also felt like I was supposed to sympathize with Scarlett Johansen's character, but I didn't.  She plays a mistress (this is the 3rd time I've seen her play a mistress in a movie) and she knew from the beginning that he was married, but pursued him with a vengeance anyway...showing zero concern for his wife's feelings and only thinking of her happiness.  She scoffs when he makes her witness something that his wife is also going through, but why didn't she scoff when he did the same thing to his wife?  I thought she was a hypocrite.Overall, I thought this was an entertaining and sometimes funny movie.  The message is not that NO guy will ever be into you, but just not THIS guy.

Chick flicks will occasionally get a chuckle or good feeling from me, but they're just generally so...you know what I'm going to say.This movie shares some attributes with one movie I do like, ""When Harry Met Sally"", the interviews in between segments, but done slightly differently.OK. I loved this movie.I almost cheered when Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) and Justin Long (Alex) got together. It was sooo cute.Scarlett Johansson, who I always thought was pretty is positively thick for this movie. Really smokin' hot. She's a great actress, too. I've always liked Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston and they didn't disappoint. I didn't care for Jennifer Connelly's character and felt like stomping on her foot by the end of the movie, but they can't all be winners, can they? I like Drew Barrymore too and her character was cute in a Drew Barrymore way, but she was swallowed up by the other sizable actors around her in her seemingly small role. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where Drew Barrymore was dwarfed before. Even in ""Donnie Darko"", her supporting role spotlighted her between the Gyllenhals. Kris Kristofferson as Jennifer Aniston's dad and Luis Guzman as a typecast Mexican worker role: two great actors which were sadly almost were non-existent in this movie...disappointing. I was just waiting to see what happened with Long and Goodwin! Really.Goodwin, Long and Johansson stole this movie, they emitted vibrant waves dragging me into the story. I was helpless.

That being said it did have some truly funny parts that blended into the movie perfectly.The actors were all great, none more so than Ginnifer Goodwin. She is a lovable gal, who unfortunately lives in the dark when it comes to guys. And shock of all shocks, my favorite guy in this movie is Ben Affleck.

The movie is populated with the pathetic women who just talk and talk about their relationships or the lack of them, and are needy, desperate, and super-annoying. Infantile men, scary of commitments or those who are in the relationship but could not remember why they actually wanted to be in one. Plus, it has nothing to do with the comedies. It is totally not funny and anti-romantic. Just imagine Sex and the City with no sex, Love, actually with NO Love at all, actually, and When Harry Met Sally with the main characters absolutely unlikable and lifeless. I finished watching the whole thing hoping that it would improve and give me something to like in it. The only story that I found a notch better than the rest was that of Neil and Beth (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck), who have been together for seven years, love each other but are not married because Neil does not believe in marriage. Both actors were convincing in the story that was not as annoying as the rest of them.But for the most of the time, I was not into the movie's characters at all. I read the plot of the movie in Wiki and in writing it does not look as irritating and boring as the film. Then I found out that the film was based on the bestselling book by two Sex and the City scribes (that explains the similarities between two), Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. I read some of it and liked it a lot.  So, what went wrong with the movie?  Were the actors trying too much) or 2+ hours running time was way too long?

I guess it was supposed to be a romantic comedy, but if it was there weren't many laughs. The movie was set up such that it supposedly offered advice to single women regarding single men. Personally, I thought the movie was insulting to single people, in general, and especially to single women. I can say this because I was a single person for over 50 years beyond puberty until I finally got married. Believe me, I know what the single life is like. I actually felt sorry for the very attractive single women depicted in this movie and I felt embarrassment at the depiction of the men. A comedy? Maybe a laugh track was needed so that the audience could tell when it was supposed to be funny.The production values of the film were fairly high. The photography was good. The sound track was okay. The acting of most of the characters was actually fairly good to excellent in a lot of places. Unfortunately, the cast was burdened with a pathetic story line. Almost every cliche of single life was dwelled upon at length. The movie was boring and embarrassing at the same time. I longed for the end. This DVD will go into the trash.

Rather than follow a single story it is a series of vignettes of several people who are loosely connected to one another.The main plot is nicely clueless  Gennifer Goodwin as the girl who inextricably can't land a second date with a guy and starts to get advice on men from a bar owner who takes her under his wing after seeing she doesn't realize she's been dumped by a guy.The supporting stories are Jennifer Anniston, considering old-maid-dom after breaking up with her uncommital boyfriend of 7 years and a neurotic Jennifer Connelly who drives her formerly faithful husband into the...arms, of selfish Scarlet Johansen who doesn't care if he's married if he might be the one for her, married men leave their wives right? She justifies.Other characters and plots are worked in but these are the main deals. After showing up in a lot of the TV commercials, Drew Barrymore has a surprisingly small role in the film. Pleasantly the people, male and female are looking for relationships not just a hook up, but most plots devolve into A wants B but B is looking at D so A settles for C who really wanted someone else. The scenes move quickly and easily with good performances. If there's a plot line you don't like, don't worry it moves along quickly and if there's one you do like, don't worry it will be up shortly.The problem with the film, beyond wondering why the attractive and friendly Goodwin can't get a second date, is that it moves too easily. You enjoy the scenes but don't really develop enough of an attachment to any character to care what happens after they're off the screen. Even potential home wrecker Johansen comes across as vapid but likeable.Happily married maybe I'm the wrong demographic for this film. I think it appeals to people in the dating scene who can either see themselves in the sad sacks on the screen or feel superior to them. In the final run, He's Just Not That into You is a pleasant distraction but little else. There are no memorable characters or quotes or scenes.

Anna is friends-with-benefits with Conor (Kevin Connelly) who had one date with Gigi and is not that into her. Rounding out the cast is ad salesgirl Mary (Drew Barrymore) and wise bartender Alex (Justin Long), who counsels Gigi to behave more like a guy and not take it all so personally.  Apart from observing that Long is nowhere near as appealing here as he is as Mac in the Mac/PC commercials, he and Barrymore grated on my nerves the least.  Then, Barrymore is barely in the movie.  I think I counted three scenes that made it into the film.  The rest is all very angsty, Thirtysomethingesque, except that all of these people are too self-involved to have children.  One wonders how a nonfiction self-help book evolved into a 'romantic comedy' (in quotes, because there's not much that's either romantic or funny here) with all these different storylines.  A bit more entertaining than I was expecting it to be, which is faint praise, maybe, but that's all I got.  Women can take away the one salient lesson they need to learn, though:  When he's just not that into you, the signs are clear.

The plot is weak and flickers half-heartedly, with little surges at a heart-touching moment ending up ruined. I felt like the director and the writers and everybody had a great idea, but it just got bogged down with weird plot twists and dull dialog.I sat down to watch this movie, expecting something much more light and, well, romantic. It looks and sounds like a cute movie. Yet the humor they stab just ends up making us cringe, and the ""truths"" they sift in their about men and women are all, frankly, stupid and unrealistic.The movie makes men look like disgusting dogs, and women look like lousy Bambi-eyed stupidheads, in a third grader's words. It had a heart, trust me, but it's just very bizarre. Like, let's watch a man fall in love with a not-so-innocent blond, or a hopeless girl fall in love several times, only to learn from a male friend that each one isn't interested, and gives her dating tips (which seems weird on its own). I mean, I feel like there's too many characters in an overly-complicated, weird plot that just doesn't click with me.So if this is such a horrible movie, why did I rate it more than one star? Because it's honestly not a horrible movie. It started out good, but kinda degraded (it really lost me with the man-leaving-his-wife-for-the-younger-girl part). It has a few touching parts, granted, and though a nontraditional ending, it's still predictable and feels kinda hollow. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can watch it if you like, but don't buy it.

If I don't expect too much from a film, and if there is a cast of exceptional actors, then I will probably really enjoy it.Some of the reviews of this movie complained about the huge cast, but to me, it was kind of like a slice of real life--albeit singles life in the New Millennium--with a group of interconnected characters.  It was more than a series of vignettes, like you might have found in the old Robert Altman films, since the characters were all connected in some way (via a kind of six-degrees-of-separation fashion); furthermore, the same characters kept popping up often enough that you could actually follow their adventures, as they attempt to figure out the ""rules"" for singles life.Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Ben Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore are some of the major stars you'll find here.  They are fun to watch and bring out some interesting points about how men and women view relationships in very different ways.

However, as the film unfolded I found myself drawn in, like a puppy to a bowl of 'forbidden' food. The movie follows several different characters as they search for true love. One couple is married (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper). One couple doesn't necessarily believe in marriage (Ben Afleck and Jennifer Anniston). Two girls just want to be a couple (Gennifer Goodwin and Drew Barrymore). Two guys also want to be couples, though they don't know it yet (Kevin Connolly and Justin Long). And then there's one girl (Scarlett Johansson) that's just disgusting in her actions. And that's not all of the stars that are in the movie, but you get the point.Anyway, the film is basically a mosaic at first, presenting the viewer with a quote that happens to set the scene for what's coming up. This mosaic introduces you to the many, many different characters that are all indirectly inter-related. People start to date or fall apart or whatever. And then the second half of the movie throws the ""quote"" thing out the window and follows the choices the people have made.My problem with this movie was that there were too many characters, or too many connections. I can handle that when it's presented over a long bout of time (like in Lost), but when it's crammed into a 2-hour spot it's too much. It's like A and B are together, but B falls for C, who happens to be with D, who is best friends with E. F and G are in a relationship, and G is B's best friend. H is looking for a relationship and gets help and advice from her co-workers, A and F. And that's not even half of it. I'm sure the creators used some sort of flow chart or matrix to work everything out. Overall, the plot was semi-interesting, but I only really cared about a few of the characters.

After seeing many negative reviews, I hoped for at least something good, but got something dreadful. I kept trying to find something to like about this movie as I normally love Jen Anniston, but even she could'nt save this clunker. Her character, along with Affleck's, were the best out of the bunch. Theirs was the most genuine and realistic out of all the ""love"" situations. I found Goodwin's character absolutely obnoxious. Who in real life would be that insecure and needy? Any man in his right mind would run from that. Especially a womanizer who had his share of beautiful women and then he unknowingly falls for her afer she attacks him on the sofa? Gag me. As for the love triangle between Scarlett's character and two men, how cliche. Of course the femme fatalle would be played by a busty blonde. Then there is Connelly's portrayal of a pathetic wife who only snared her husband by giving him an ultimatum and then refusing to sleep with him. Upon finding out about is infidelity she accepts it quite calmly until she further discovers he is sneaking cigarettes. Sneaking sex is acceptable, but he could get lung cancer!!  Then there is Drew Barrymore's air-headed character of a modern day woman who can't figure out how to communicate with all the different technologies in today's world. I had to roll my eyes throughout much of this film as these women were a bunch of one dimensional, pathetic whiners made to look weak, needy and less than. Real women are not like this, at least the ones I know. Thank goodness.  What surprises me most is that all these A-list actors signed up for this vapid drivel in the first place. Musta have been a heck of a paycheck. I guess the moral of this film is that as a society we, as women, are programmed to believe that a man likes us if he treats us badly.

But most of the relationships seemed either excessively superficial and more than a little whiny. But what devastates the rating was the Jennifer Aniston storyline. Spoiler alert, but it's important to understanding why this movie is not good. That relationship has been going on for years and is fine, except that she wants to get married at some point, and he doesn't see the point in marriage. This turns into a big conflict and they break up over it. Here's the part that gets me: Jennifer Aniston's character comes back telling herself that she's actually okay with staying with the guy and not getting married even though it's what she wants. She gives up the thing that she wants for this guy. Yes, it's true that afterward he proposes, but it doesn't change the how incredibly selfish he is.

""He's Just Not That Into You"" has been yet another dating training film, and while we laugh at the mildly amusing we are supposed to see ourselves in these situations and change our behaviors.  It is a shame that we put ourselves in these situations, but not that funny that we really do delude ourselves into thinking that something will come of a man who is, simply, not that into us.The funniest, and most pathetic, is that of GiGi, who shows up at a bar wanting to return some guy's pen in the hopes of seeing him again.  In a not so ironic twist, the bar owner, Justin Long, becomes her romantic interest even though she talks to him as if he is her therapist before he too rejects her and he inevitably realizes that he likes her as well.  Drew Barrymore is guided through her minor trials and tribulations by her army of gays, her funniest scene is when they listen to her botched voice mails from her MySpace antics.  Jennifer Aniston has been living with her boyfriend for the last seven years and he's simply ""not into marriage"", causing her much stress.  And Scarlette Johansen is having an affair with a married man, believing within that he will leave his wife for her while his wife, Jennifer Connelly, is at home suffering.

1152052,A12GK5JUYAV0HM,B00164KYV4,"M. Spencer ""Kitty""","[5, 9]","This is the part (once I really get into the meat of the review) where the desperate to wed or clingy, why isn't he calling me types are going to string me up by my over 30 and beat the bs statistic married shoestrings. First of all the actors/actresses they picked for this movie were fantastic, and the title literally explains a perfectly logical point that He (or even she) Is Not That Into You. When I caught it on Sex & he City, it was genius. Of course! It makes sense....we all have had people in our lives that we liked, but didn't have that kind of chemistry with. They usually fell into friend zone. I think society puts too much emphasis that people of the opposite sex can not be friends and can only date. What's wrong with just hanging out and getting to know someone? Given my experience, I think we should be friends first and foremost. At least than either something blossoms from it or doesn't, but can if it's going to happen without the ridiculous presser people put on themselves to be with someone (anyone). And this movie certainly sells the same heaping spoonful that everyone has to have someone, even if they settle. I'll give a brief bio of the characters as part of my review as the movie itself is hard to describe otherwise.Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) who we know from Big Love, is a delightful person you just want to layer in bubble wrap in hopes to keep her hopeless puppy heart from being broken. She clings to the phone in dire almost painful neediness, and eventually grows frustrated with the language and games people play.Scarlett Johansson....oh the lovely married to Ryan Reynolds in real life Scarlett...her character Anna is one we all want to hate. I myself wanted to run into this character in real life and slap her in her pretty face, tether her to my rear bumper by her lengthy blond locks, and drag her a few miles across uneven terrain. Without ruining it for you, in case you are going to watch this regardless of the reviews, I'll just say this....she's a beautiful manipulative, pouty siren who, in her own twisted logic way, is looking for love in all the completely wrong places.Drew Barrymore plays a wonderful little part; always quirky and with a little comic relief. But you only get bits and pieces of her. Eventually, in a round about way, she gets what she's looking for and we're happy for her.Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck play a couple that have been together for years (over 5), living together in a great apartment, building a life until one day Beth (Anniston) has gotten it in her head that they need to be married. I'll tell you right now the long, pointless dance they play out was utterly predicable. I annoyed my girl friend sitting next to me (as I wasn't going to drag my fianc&eacute; at the time to this piece of chickflick), bursting out with each accurate prediction.Tiring drama.Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper play another couple whom have been married for a little while, having undertaken the arduous ordeal of renovating an old house. I won't even begin to elucidate the complicated, disturbed, deep-rooted psychological/other issues between this couple other than go Janine! (Jennifer Connelly) towards the end of the movie.Overall the movie should be seen more as a dark comedy or drama rather than a romantic one. My friend and I left (she's married and I engaged at the time and both having dated in the past obviously) with this horribly somber feeling that we were unable to express in words until days later. I was depressed and pitying, upset, and felt the characters in general were sad and utterly, self destructively unhappy.

I understand the idea of using female characters to relay the messages. However, I found the implementation of that, sort of a let down.  A lot of the lessons were lost.  I wasn't drawn in to the characters and their lives.  They seemed uninteresting, sort of wishy washy, and they did not truly evolve as chracters, which is the whole point of the story.The one woman, who wants to get married, breaks up with her bfriend of seven years because he hasn't made the move towards marriage, ends up letting go of her marriage dream and gets back together with him.  So where is the lesson or real growth from her character?  Because I was confused.  Is it that she was too hung up on being married?  I don't know.

As a sum total, it was a moderately enjoyable movie, yet oddly I found it to be poorly cast/acted, and full of clich&eacute;s.HJNTIY follows various relationships among people who all either know each other, or are separated by only a degree or two at most.  We see people falling IN love, people falling OUT of love.  Some couples do both.  Some characters seem to do neither.  And naturally, most things wrap up in a satisfactory manner at the end.  It's told in loosely interwoven scenes.  The easiest comparison I can come up with is to say it's like a NYC version of LOVE, ACTUALLY.  Although I enjoyed LOVE, ACTUALLY a whole lot more...mostly because many of the performers gave energetic, committed performances, including the drop-dead funny Bill Nighy, the droll Hugh Grant and the exceedingly witty and down-to-earth Emma Thompson.If I had to pick a ""star"" of HJNTIY, it would probably be Ginnifer Goodwin (who is fabulous on TV's BIG LOVE).  She gets the most screen time.  Her character is a young woman whose very eagerness to land a man causes her to drive them away.  She is also utterly unable to decipher the signals men are sending her, and is really the character for whom the title is meant.  She forges a friendship with bar owner Justin Long, who guides her through the ""code"" of understanding text messages, voice mail,  pick-up lines and brush-off lines.  Goodwin throws all her energy into the part, and the result is an annoying character...it's easy to see why men run from her.  Yet I had to give her credit for her efforts.  At least she was trying.On the other end of the scale was poor Jennifer Connelly.  It's now been a scarily long time since she's had a good part or really turned in a memorable performance.  I had high hopes a couple of years ago for her appearance in LITTLE CHILDREN, and though she acquitted herself okay, the nature of her role didn't help her and then Kate Winslet just flat-out out-performed her.  She is not a natural for comedy, and she mostly looked worn out and disinterested.  Justin Long was right there as well...he looked 10 years older than the last time I saw him...frankly, he looked a little unhealthy, and he certainly appeared to be uninterested in building a relatable character.In between we had Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck as a couple that's been together happily for years, but Affleck just won't pull the trigger on the marriage thing.  Gee, a man who's ""against"" marriage??!?!  I've NEVER seen that in a movie before.  All their scenes were charming, because these two actors are endlessly affable...but there was no real sizzle.Scarlett Johannssen reaffirmed her limited range. Obviously she's a stunning young lady, but with each passing role, she becomes more and more affectless and listless.  She's frequently paired with Bradley Cooper, who I am HUGELY tired of seeing in any way, shape or form.  I just don't get the appeal...he seems utterly incapable of being likeable.  He convincingly plays a cad in this film, but really never makes us sympathize with him.Also, the film underutilizes Drew Barrymore...but I suspect that her character, had she been given more screentime, would have been unlikeable too...a rare feat for the always breezy and fun Barrymore.Again, the awkward tapestry all these characters wove was mildly entertaining throughout, and when we left the theatre, I was pleased enough to chalk it up as a ""win.""  But with merely 5 minutes reflection, I realized that there was very little work in the movie that was worthwhile, and I believe that HJNTIY will soon fade from memory.The film MIGHT be a good ""date night"" rental...but why not watch WHEN HARRY MET SALLY again?

Zwick,"[4, 5]","An all-star cast - Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long and Kris Kristofferson  - hits the skids in  ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" a supposedly insightful and epic look into the complex dynamics of man/woman relationships that could single-handedly turn members of both sexes off romance forever.In this misguided endeavor (the only thing really clever about it is the title), it's hard to tell which gender comes off worse - the women, who are all portrayed as needy, insecure, controlling, man-hungry whiners, or the men, who are all inconsiderate, self-centered louts.  And this battle-of-the-sexes face-off goes on for a grueling two hours and nine minutes.The specific details of the romantic roundelay the characters put us through doesn't really bear repeating here.  Suffice it to say that the actors do what they can with the material - the movie was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (based on the novel by Greg Berhrendt and Liz Tuccillo) and directed by Ken Kwapis - and that most of the characters manage to see the errors of their ways in time for the obligatory happy ending (could that possibly qualify as a plot ""spoiler""?  Only if you have never seen a romantic comedy before, I suppose).  Barrymore does get off a few choice lines about how hard it is to date in a world dominated by email, cell phones, text messaging, voicemail, and a whole host of other technological gadgets that actually make communication MORE difficult rather than less so, but that's pretty much it in the laughs department.And a couple of other points:  why is it that, in a movie that takes place in a modern urban setting, the producers couldn`t cast even one person of color in a major role (there are plenty of them in the background appearing as waiters, however)?  And what's with all the gay guys, with their limp-wristed affectations and ""You go, girl!"" theatrics?  Frankly, I thought we'd gotten past all that by this point.  It isn't even a matter of being politically correct; it`s a matter of creating a credible environment for the movie to tell its story in.If you're interested in watching a genuinely great romantic comedy, skip ""He's Just Not That Into You"" and check out the 1967 classic ""Two For the Road,"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, and see how truly insightful and thoughtful a movie romance can be!",2,a clunker despite all its star-power,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2452,"['all-star', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'skids', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'supposedly', 'insightful', 'epic', 'look', 'complex', 'dynamics', 'man/woman', 'relationships', 'could', 'single-handedly', 'turn', 'members', 'sexes', 'off', 'romance', 'forever.In', 'misguided', 'endeavor', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'clever', 'title', 'hard', 'tell', 'gender', 'off', 'worse', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'needy', 'insecure', 'controlling', 'man-hungry', 'whiners', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'inconsiderate', 'self-centered', 'louts', 'battle-of-the-sexes', 'face-off', 'grueling', 'two', 'hours', 'nine', 'minutes.The', 'specific', 'details', 'romantic', 'roundelay', 'characters', 'put', ""n't"", 'really', 'bear', 'repeating', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Abby', 'Kohn', 'Marc', 'Silverstein', 'based', 'novel', 'Greg', 'Berhrendt', 'Liz', 'Tuccillo', 'directed', 'Ken', 'Kwapis', 'most', 'characters', 'manage', 'see', 'errors', 'ways', 'time', 'obligatory', 'happy', 'ending', 'could', 'possibly', 'qualify', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'Only', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'Barrymore', 'get', 'off', 'few', 'choice', 'lines', 'how', 'hard', 'date', 'world', 'dominated', 'email', 'cell', 'phones', 'text', 'messaging', 'voicemail', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'technological', 'gadgets', 'actually', 'make', 'communication', 'MORE', 'difficult', 'rather', 'less', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'laughs', 'department.And', 'couple', 'other', 'points', 'why', 'movie', 'place', 'modern', 'urban', 'setting', 'producers', 'couldn', 't', 'cast', 'even', 'one', 'person', 'color', 'major', 'role', 'are', 'plenty', 'background', 'appearing', 'waiters', 'however', 'what', 'gay', 'guys', 'limp-wristed', 'affectations', 'go', 'girl', 'theatrics', 'Frankly', 'thought', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'point', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 's', 'matter', 'creating', 'credible', 'environment', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'in.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'watching', 'genuinely', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'skip', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'check', '1967', 'classic', 'Two', 'Road', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'see', 'how', 'truly', 'insightful', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'romance', 'can', 'be']",He's Just Not That Into You
1152071,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,B00164KYV4,Rons Reviews,"[1, 2]","Yes, Hollywood can still make successful character driven films with smart dialog. No Animation, no special effects, no explosions, just a good story told well.""He's Just Not That Into You"", written by Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein based on the book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo hit theatres on February 6th, 2009, and was the surprise of the Post Oscars/Pre-Summer Junk Dump Season.  Since you may have missed it as few venture out into that barren cinematic wasteland that is February, now is the time to catch this fun flick as New Line Home Video sends it to the shelves on Tuesday June 2nd, 2009.This one hundred and twenty-nine minute romp includes a talented ensemble cast including: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Scarlett, Johansson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Justin Long.  Though slightly skewed too far to one side, ""He's Just Not That Into You"", takes an in depth look into relationships and respective success and failure.  We want different things, with different people, and no one knows what the other is thinking.  Should relationships be this hard?  Should watching others struggle through them be this enjoyable?  It is simply because, though we may not relate to all these people, we do relate to the situations.  That is a reflection of good writing, and one might have to go back as far as ""The Big Chill"" to find people we enjoy this much who are talking about things we care about.From a young woman out to find love being mentored by the all knowing bar manager, to the puppy dog clinging to the hottie who really wants the married guy who thinks he may have made a mistake, to the guy who just doesn't want to get married to the woman he loves, to the women in relationships they just can't figure out due to a myriad of reasons including the growing relationship reliance on technology, this film has it all.  Someone should write a book.  Oh, wait, they did.  Inspired by an episode and based on a book written by two writers of ""Sex in the City"", this film reaches levels of enjoyment that Carrie and her clan only wish they could bring to the big screen.Yes, not all the performances are on the same level.  Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly give performances that are limited in dimension through most of the film, and the transition made by Justin long as he goes from the cool dating mentor, to frantic heart sick puppy may be beyond his young capabilities, but the majority of the cast give fine performances in what are all essentially supporting roles.  In most cases we end up wanting more of the people we saw the least of, and less of those we saw the majority of.Though there is little offered as Special features in this new release; the additional scenes are surprisingly enlightening and entertaining.  In most cases we can usually see why scenes are indeed left out of a film, and with ""He's Just Not That Into You"" boasting a running time of over two hours, an argument can certainly be made for the cuts made, but the insights on parental influence found in these scenes were entertaining and well acted. Adding commentary by Director Ken Kwapis, who did a fine job of utilizing his stacked cast within a well paced tale, makes sitting through the extra scenes again well worth the investment.Recommendation: This is a great film to watch with friends and a surprisingly pleasant addition to any collection. The story and the dialog are the stars here, and well worth your time.",4,"It's easy to get into ""He's Just Not That Into You"".",1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,3481,"['Yes', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'successful', 'character', 'driven', 'films', 'smart', 'dialog', 'Animation', 'special', 'effects', 'explosions', 'just', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'written', 'Abby', 'Kohn', 'Marc', 'Silverstein', 'based', 'book', 'Greg', 'Behrendt', 'Liz', 'Tuccillo', 'hit', 'theatres', 'February', '6th', '2009', 'was', 'surprise', 'Post', 'Oscars/Pre-Summer', 'Junk', 'Dump', 'Season', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'few', 'venture', 'out', 'cinematic', 'wasteland', 'February', 'now', 'time', 'catch', 'fun', 'flick', 'New', 'Line', 'Home', 'Video', 'shelves', 'Tuesday', 'June', '2nd', '2009.This', 'one', 'hundred', 'twenty-nine', 'minute', 'romp', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Though', 'slightly', 'skewed', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'side', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'depth', 'look', 'relationships', 'respective', 'success', 'failure', 'want', 'different', 'things', 'different', 'people', 'one', 'what', 'other', 'thinking', 'Should', 'relationships', 'be', 'hard', 'Should', 'watching', 'others', 'struggle', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'simply', 'may', 'not', 'relate', 'people', 'do', 'relate', 'situations', 'reflection', 'good', 'writing', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'Big', 'Chill', 'find', 'people', 'enjoy', 'much', 'who', 'are', 'talking', 'things', 'care', 'young', 'woman', 'find', 'love', 'being', 'mentored', 'knowing', 'bar', 'manager', 'puppy', 'dog', 'clinging', 'hottie', 'who', 'really', 'married', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'guy', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'married', 'woman', 'women', 'relationships', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'due', 'myriad', 'reasons', 'including', 'growing', 'relationship', 'reliance', 'technology', 'film', 'Someone', 'should', 'write', 'book', 'Oh', 'wait', 'did', 'Inspired', 'episode', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'two', 'writers', 'Sex', 'City', 'film', 'levels', 'enjoyment', 'Carrie', 'clan', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'bring', 'big', 'screen.Yes', 'not', 'performances', 'are', 'same', 'level', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'give', 'performances', 'are', 'limited', 'dimension', 'most', 'film', 'transition', 'made', 'Justin', 'long', 'cool', 'dating', 'mentor', 'frantic', 'heart', 'sick', 'puppy', 'may', 'be', 'young', 'capabilities', 'majority', 'cast', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'are', 'essentially', 'supporting', 'roles', 'most', 'cases', 'end', 'up', 'wanting', 'more', 'people', 'saw', 'least', 'less', 'saw', 'majority', 'little', 'offered', 'Special', 'features', 'new', 'release', 'additional', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'enlightening', 'entertaining', 'most', 'cases', 'can', 'usually', 'see', 'why', 'scenes', 'are', 'indeed', 'left', 'out', 'film', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'boasting', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'argument', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'made', 'cuts', 'made', 'insights', 'parental', 'influence', 'found', 'scenes', 'were', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'Adding', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Ken', 'Kwapis', 'who', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'utilizing', 'stacked', 'cast', 'well', 'paced', 'tale', 'sitting', 'extra', 'scenes', 'again', 'well', 'investment.Recommendation', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'friends', 'surprisingly', 'pleasant', 'addition', 'collection', 'story', 'dialog', 'are', 'stars', 'here', 'well', 'time']",He's Just Not That Into You

1152078,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B00164KYV4,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[16, 19]","Several reviewers have identified this film as being for the dating and coupling scene of youth.  I disagree.  We have many older folks out in the dating arena, these days, going through some of the same angst of the younger generations.  Will they call?  Do they care?  Are they married and hiding it?  And, for many older women who have become accomplished, they have to wonder; are they after me, or my hard-earned, success.  So searching for Mr. Right, over the course of our lifespans, doesn't change that much; in fact, it can get more complicated. So, in essence, this movie can provide some thoughts to ponder across the age spectrum. A very good thing, since even seniors, can turn into gushy teens, again, when shot by Cupid's arrow.(SPOILER) Some felt that the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Aniston's characters was a tad unbelievable; that they would live together for 7 years without marriage and that ultimately Ben's character would cave. I disagree, again; their relationship rang the truest. They had a very loving, faithful relationship, that had endured time.  When Aniston's character removed the obstacle of marriage, Ben's character no longer felt he was being forced into conformity.  It was then HIS decision; one conceived in freedom-of-choice. This was textbook Psych 101, 'you can take the horse to water, but can't make him drink,' until he darn well pleases.The idea of 'marriage' was the area I found unsettling, because how many of us ladies were the one to drop the, less than subliminal, idea of 'marriage' first?  If so, it makes you wonder if your partner really wanted the same thing, or if they just 'settled.'  This was very well, and sadly, depicted in the Connelly relationship.  And, for many who did push the commitment proposal, first, I suspect it will have them staring into their partner's eyeballs with some jaded contempt, wondering why they didn't have the storybook proposal, while strongly empathizing with Connelly.The cast was stellar, with a few reservations. Drew Barrymore's character was irresistibly charming, as always. Johannsen's husband-stealing seduction was very well played out, and, is guaranteed to make you bring out the cat-claws.  You've seen the type too many times before, but then, she wasn't the problem, just a symptom of a much deeper one, which is generally the case.  The character I found most annoying was J. Goodwin. Yeah, she was cute, but too ditsy and trying too darn hard to connect with Mr. Right. Her behaviors were the most immature of the bunch, but we've all known friends like her; ones that we are always telling 'you can't find anyone if you're trying too hard---it will happen when you least expect it.' This philosophy even rang true for her.I thought this film could have been better developed, and the messages deepened. It had a 'flaky' factor I did not embrace.  I'd rate it a B+ accomplishment. However, I will still recommend it to all my friends that remain on the prowl; even for those that believe they've found their soul-mate, because it reminds us that things aren't always as they appear; that denial can exist in what is believed to be the perfect union, leading to lost years and promises---and life is too darn short.Have a girl's night, watch it, and cherry-pick the scenes of wisdom, and/or the behaviors that apply to you.  I can almost guarantee that you'll find some.",4,"PAIN of dating dynamics, not JUST for the young audience",1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3399,"['Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'identified', 'film', 'being', 'dating', 'coupling', 'scene', 'youth', 'disagree', 'have', 'many', 'older', 'folks', 'out', 'dating', 'arena', 'days', 'going', 'same', 'angst', 'younger', 'generations', 'Will', 'call', 'Do', 'care', 'Are', 'married', 'hiding', 'many', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'accomplished', 'have', 'wonder', 'are', 'hard-earned', 'success', 'So', 'searching', 'Mr', 'Right', 'course', 'lifespans', ""n't"", 'change', 'that', 'much', 'fact', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'So', 'essence', 'movie', 'can', 'provide', 'thoughts', 'ponder', 'age', 'spectrum', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'seniors', 'can', 'turn', 'gushy', 'teens', 'again', 'when', 'shot', 'Cupid', 'arrow', 'SPOILER', 'felt', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Jeniffer', 'Aniston', 'characters', 'was', 'tad', 'unbelievable', 'would', 'live', 'together', '7', 'years', 'marriage', 'ultimately', 'Ben', 'character', 'would', 'cave', 'disagree', 'again', 'relationship', 'truest', 'had', 'very', 'loving', 'faithful', 'relationship', 'had', 'endured', 'time', 'When', 'Aniston', 'character', 'removed', 'obstacle', 'marriage', 'Ben', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'forced', 'conformity', 'was', 'then', 'HIS', 'decision', 'one', 'conceived', 'freedom-of-choice', 'was', 'textbook', 'Psych', '101', 'can', 'take', 'horse', 'water', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'drink', 'well', 'pleases.The', 'idea', ""'marriage"", 'was', 'area', 'found', 'unsettling', 'how', 'many', 'ladies', 'were', 'one', 'drop', 'less', 'subliminal', 'idea', ""'marriage"", 'first', 'so', 'wonder', 'partner', 'really', 'wanted', 'same', 'thing', 'just', ""'settled"", 'was', 'very', 'well', 'sadly', 'depicted', 'Connelly', 'relationship', 'many', 'who', 'did', 'push', 'commitment', 'proposal', 'first', 'suspect', 'will', 'have', 'staring', 'partner', 'eyeballs', 'jaded', 'contempt', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'storybook', 'proposal', 'strongly', 'empathizing', 'Connelly.The', 'cast', 'was', 'stellar', 'few', 'reservations', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'was', 'irresistibly', 'charming', 'always', 'Johannsen', 'husband-stealing', 'seduction', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'bring', 'out', 'cat-claws', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'just', 'symptom', 'much', 'deeper', 'one', 'generally', 'case', 'character', 'found', 'most', 'annoying', 'was', 'J.', 'Goodwin', 'Yeah', 'was', 'cute', 'too', 'ditsy', 'trying', 'too', 'darn', 'hard', 'connect', 'Mr', 'Right', 'behaviors', 'were', 'most', 'immature', 'bunch', ""'ve"", 'known', 'friends', 'ones', 'are', 'always', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'trying', 'too', 'hard', '-it', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'philosophy', 'even', 'true', 'her.I', 'thought', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'messages', 'deepened', 'had', ""'flaky"", 'factor', 'did', 'not', 'embrace', ""'d"", 'rate', 'B+', 'accomplishment', 'However', 'will', 'still', 'recommend', 'friends', 'remain', 'prowl', 'even', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'found', 'soul-mate', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'appear', 'denial', 'can', 'exist', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'perfect', 'union', 'leading', 'lost', 'years', 'promises', '-and', 'life', 'too', 'darn', 'short.Have', 'girl', 'night', 'watch', 'cherry-pick', 'scenes', 'wisdom', 'and/or', 'behaviors', 'apply', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'find']",He's Just Not That Into You

The movie demonstrates (very well) many different types of relationships, both good and bad, and gives us some insight into what we might be doing wrong, or where we need to draw boundaries.  Also, pay attention to the in between scenes in the movie, where they cut away to people who are not in the movie -- those scenes are hilarious, but oh so true!  I suggest following up with the book.  It has a lot of little quips in it that really open your eyes to what's really going on.

The colors, depth and scenery variety make for an adequate representation, including the sailing, the dark indoors, room decors, and Scarlett. The sound is uneventful but you do have the choice between TrueHD or normal 5.1. And if even just to hear Kristofferson's voice say anything in TrueHD, albeit only two scenes.The special features are definitely...unique. If you liked the premise of that invisible wall being removed during the film - the ""interviews"" of the random people on the street - then you you will dig the main feature here.* A ""newspaper"" format of the six couples/storylines that when selected, allows you to delve deeper into the characters' lives. Actually, brief excerpts can be seen during the credit sequence. Each one totals three minutes and admittedly, it peaked every single customer's interest when they saw it, because it seems real. Several people thought they were watching Hollywood couples being interviewed about their relationships. Bradley Cooper's ""interview"" gathered the biggest crowd, but irritated most of the guys watching.* If one ever has interest into how much a phone conversation scene in a movie can be micromanaged, look no further. This four minute feature has the director dissect in detail how they made one of the phone call scenes have relevance that even the trained eye might miss. If anything, several people now wanted to watch the film again to see what the heck he was talking about.* The inspiration and history of the film are covered in an eleven minute documentary, catered to the die hard fans.* The deleted scenes total 13:45 and would have been much better left in - especially since we had already endured two+ hours of this. The commentary gives no credibility as to why Scarlet's actual singing was removed from the film. Coupled with Teresa Russel's entire role being cut, it just showcased the weakness in the writing people complain about in this film.Big fans of the film will want this as a purchase, but since 90% of my Blu customers are guys, I foresee this as mostly a rental.",4,A Blu Review,1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,2333,"['Obviously', 'movie', 'hit', 'nerve', 'large', 'volume', 'people', 'hate', 'love', 'Blu', 'managed', 'make', 'nice', 'product.The', '129', 'minutes', 'seem', 'long', 'variety', 'color', 'tests', 'hidef', 'clarity', 'showcasing', 'awesome', 'cast', 'watchable', 'Blu', 'colors', 'depth', 'scenery', 'variety', 'make', 'adequate', 'representation', 'including', 'sailing', 'dark', 'indoors', 'room', 'decors', 'Scarlett', 'sound', 'uneventful', 'do', 'have', 'choice', 'TrueHD', 'normal', '5.1', 'even', 'just', 'hear', 'Kristofferson', 'voice', 'say', 'anything', 'TrueHD', 'only', 'two', 'scenes.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'definitely', 'unique', 'liked', 'premise', 'invisible', 'wall', 'being', 'removed', 'film', 'interviews', 'random', 'people', 'street', 'then', 'will', 'dig', 'main', 'feature', 'here', '*', 'A', 'newspaper', 'format', 'six', 'couples/storylines', 'when', 'selected', 'delve', 'deeper', 'characters', 'lives', 'Actually', 'brief', 'excerpts', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'credit', 'sequence', 'one', 'totals', 'three', 'minutes', 'admittedly', 'peaked', 'single', 'customer', 'interest', 'when', 'saw', 'real', 'Several', 'people', 'thought', 'were', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'couples', 'being', 'interviewed', 'relationships', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'interview', 'gathered', 'biggest', 'crowd', 'irritated', 'most', 'guys', 'watching', '*', 'one', 'ever', 'interest', 'how', 'much', 'phone', 'conversation', 'scene', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'micromanaged', 'look', 'further', 'four', 'minute', 'feature', 'director', 'dissect', 'detail', 'how', 'made', 'one', 'phone', 'call', 'scenes', 'have', 'relevance', 'even', 'trained', 'eye', 'might', 'miss', 'anything', 'several', 'people', 'now', 'wanted', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'talking', '*', 'inspiration', 'history', 'film', 'are', 'covered', 'eleven', 'minute', 'documentary', 'catered', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', '*', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', '13:45', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'left', 'especially', 'had', 'already', 'endured', 'two+', 'hours', 'commentary', 'credibility', 'why', 'Scarlet', 'actual', 'singing', 'was', 'removed', 'film', 'Coupled', 'Teresa', 'Russel', 'entire', 'role', 'being', 'cut', 'just', 'showcased', 'weakness', 'writing', 'people', 'complain', 'film.Big', 'fans', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'purchase', '90', '%', 'Blu', 'customers', 'are', 'guys', 'foresee', 'mostly', 'rental']",He's Just Not That Into You

Although it's disguised as a Valentine's Day chick flick, and the advertising tries to convince guys that it isn't filled exclusively with mushy stuff, it's certainly not fun-loving. Exposing, analyzing and patronizing complex relationships, He's Just Not That Into You is a startlingly relatable film that alternates between reasonably entertaining and ""drudging up bad memories."" It's more sophisticated than you might think and the humor, which is fairly consistent, doesn't resort to raunchiness. The dating crowd will want to take note, however, that this isn't the type of movie you want to watch with your significant other, as you'll both probably leave feeling guilty, paranoid, overly inquisitive, or all three.The film follows several relationships, each one originally independent of the other, until they all seem to collide at the conclusion. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) assumes the stereotype of the pathetic, desperate girl, who obsessively waits for her many dates to call her back. She resorts to begging, stalking, and other degrading acts to win the attentions of multiple guys, each one shrugging her off. Alex (Justin Long), a friendly and experienced bar manager, steps in to give Gigi a few pointers on her depressing failure with the opposite sex. Relying too heavily on his advice and his playful concern, she starts to think Alex is interested in her, leading to even more angst. Their story is the most interesting, considering Alex's often eye-opening advice and the humor in Gigi's failings.Ben (Bradley Cooper) was rushed into marriage with his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and resultantly falls for the sensual flirtations of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). After a quick seduction, Ben realizes he's destroying the relationship with his wife, but Anna is fixed on the idea that Ben could be her true love. Meanwhile, Conor (Kevin Connolly) is wondering why Anna, who is his current girlfriend, won't sleep with him. This section of the film is the most serious, with tragic and emotional twists at every turn.Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been happily in love for seven years, but when her younger sister announces wedding plans, Beth begins to question why she hasn't been proposed to. Neil doesn't believe in marriage, but Beth feels it's a necessity - leading to doubts, heartbreak and the most unlikely segment of the film.There are an additional few love stories thrown in, each involving several of the characters from the major three plot lines. Perhaps the most inspiring piece of He's Just Not That Into You is the storytelling approach, which carefully intertwines almost every single character - by the end of the film, it's really just one complex story. The problem is that a series of serious relationships that are falling apart, getting glued back together, or never having a chance to develop, is occasionally not varied enough to keep audiences amused.The large and recognizable cast is delightful to see, introducing a new familiar face every ten minutes, and the humor is universal and doesn't resort to cheap yucks. The film puts on display every single stereotype, mold, rule, exception, and dilemma of relationships; some are predictable while others are surprising, but the whole spectrum is present. Told chiefly from a woman's perspective (guys are terrible and dishonest most of the time, although at certain points the men get their more unbiased viewpoint portrayed) He's Just Not That Into You is likely to rub a great many people the wrong way. It's not a date movie by any means, but it's also not as unintelligent as it appears.- Mike Massie",3,He's Just Not That Into You Review from The Massie Twins,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,3661,"['feel-bad', 'movie', 'year', 'disguised', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'chick', 'flick', 'advertising', 'tries', 'convince', 'guys', ""n't"", 'filled', 'exclusively', 'mushy', 'stuff', 'certainly', 'not', 'fun-loving', 'Exposing', 'analyzing', 'patronizing', 'complex', 'relationships', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'startlingly', 'relatable', 'film', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'drudging', 'up', 'bad', 'memories', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'might', 'think', 'humor', 'fairly', 'consistent', ""n't"", 'resort', 'raunchiness', 'dating', 'crowd', 'will', 'want', 'take', 'note', 'however', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'significant', 'other', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'leave', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'paranoid', 'overly', 'inquisitive', 'three.The', 'film', 'several', 'relationships', 'one', 'originally', 'independent', 'other', 'seem', 'collide', 'conclusion', 'Gigi', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'stereotype', 'pathetic', 'desperate', 'girl', 'who', 'obsessively', 'many', 'dates', 'call', 'back', 'begging', 'stalking', 'other', 'degrading', 'acts', 'win', 'attentions', 'multiple', 'guys', 'one', 'shrugging', 'off', 'Alex', 'Justin', 'Long', 'friendly', 'experienced', 'bar', 'manager', 'steps', 'give', 'Gigi', 'few', 'pointers', 'depressing', 'failure', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'advice', 'playful', 'concern', 'think', 'Alex', 'interested', 'leading', 'even', 'more', 'angst', 'story', 'most', 'interesting', 'considering', 'Alex', 'often', 'eye-opening', 'advice', 'humor', 'Gigi', 'failings.Ben', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'was', 'rushed', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Janine', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'resultantly', 'sensual', 'flirtations', 'Anna', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'quick', 'seduction', 'Ben', 'destroying', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Anna', 'fixed', 'idea', 'Ben', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'love', 'Meanwhile', 'Conor', 'Kevin', 'Connolly', 'wondering', 'why', 'Anna', 'who', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'section', 'film', 'most', 'serious', 'tragic', 'emotional', 'twists', 'turn.Neil', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Beth', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'been', 'happily', 'love', 'seven', 'years', 'when', 'younger', 'sister', 'announces', 'wedding', 'plans', 'Beth', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'been', 'proposed', 'Neil', ""n't"", 'believe', 'marriage', 'Beth', 'necessity', 'leading', 'doubts', 'heartbreak', 'most', 'unlikely', 'segment', 'are', 'additional', 'few', 'love', 'stories', 'thrown', 'involving', 'several', 'characters', 'major', 'three', 'plot', 'lines', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'inspiring', 'piece', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'storytelling', 'approach', 'carefully', 'almost', 'single', 'character', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'one', 'complex', 'story', 'problem', 'series', 'serious', 'relationships', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'getting', 'glued', 'back', 'together', 'never', 'having', 'chance', 'develop', 'occasionally', 'not', 'varied', 'enough', 'keep', 'audiences', 'amused.The', 'large', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'delightful', 'see', 'introducing', 'new', 'familiar', 'face', 'ten', 'minutes', 'humor', 'universal', ""n't"", 'resort', 'cheap', 'yucks', 'film', 'display', 'single', 'stereotype', 'mold', 'rule', 'exception', 'dilemma', 'relationships', 'are', 'predictable', 'others', 'are', 'surprising', 'whole', 'spectrum', 'present', 'Told', 'chiefly', 'woman', 'perspective', 'guys', 'are', 'terrible', 'dishonest', 'most', 'time', 'certain', 'points', 'men', 'get', 'more', 'unbiased', 'viewpoint', 'portrayed', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'likely', 'rub', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'not', 'date', 'movie', 'means', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'unintelligent', 'Mike', 'Massie']",He's Just Not That Into You
1152090,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00164KYV4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","Five very likable couples that have some connection to one another traverse the choppy waters of romance in Baltimore. That's the short of the new romantic comedy - drama ""He's Just Not That Into You"". And it is an interesting, if entirely unoriginal idea. But the filmmakers take some good, interesting elements and make the story funnier and more enjoyable than it has a right to be.In a film like this, with so many characters, a film attempting to make light of and dramatize the many aspects of romance, you know that every character is going to have one aspect of a personality. There are simply too many people for the writers and director to be able to delve into any of the characters in any depth. When the writers and directors have the skill to create more than a few real life, fully rounded, believable characters, you know you are in the hands of people with real talent. Usually, the end result is something magical. ""He's Just Not..."" is not magical, but it has a few funny moments. And these moments are made all the more enjoyable by the likable cast.Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) are very much in love and have been together for seven years. But Beth wants to get married and Neil doesn't believe in it. Can Beth accept the status of their relationship and continue on, or will she jeopardize the relationship by insisting on marriage? Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly) are married, but aren't particularly happy. Janine seems to be more interested in renovating their house. When Ben meets Anna (Scarlett Johannson), a yoga teacher who wants to be a singer, he finds an undeniable attraction to her. But he doesn't want to jeopardize his marriage. But what if Anna is the love of his life? Mary (Drew Barrymore) works at ad sales for Baltimore's gay weekly and gets most of her dating advice from her gay co-workers. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), the film's guide, goes on a blind date with Conor (Kevin Connolly), a realtor. She is sure he will call back, but he is more interested in going out with Anna, a girl he is clearly infatuated with. Distraught, Gigi decides to visit a spot Conor told her he hangs out at, a restaurant owned by Alex (Justin Long), a womanizer who is also Conor's friend. He likes Gigi and decides to become her romantic guide.So, it's all very predictable. But director Ken Kwapis (who has recently been directing episodes of ""The Office"") and writers Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein manage to generate a few laughs and make most of the characters at least interesting.But all of this good will begins to evaporate. And evaporate very quickly. With five different 'couples', we have five different and distinct story lines. Yes, they overlap, but not a lot. So the film sets up a Round Robin-type of exposition. First we meet all five couples and learn why they are in this Rom Com Dram. The very broad strokes. Then, we start to explore their lives with them, delving deeper into the problems. Then we revisit them. Unfortunately, a lot of these 'visits' start to become very repetitive. A couple has an argument and then breaks up. We see the male living out of the apartment. We see the female unhappy. Will they get back together? Of course. But we have to sit through a number of scenes of each of them unhappy. What about Janine's discovery that Ben might be smoking. First, she accuses Ben. When he denies it, she turns to their foreman (Luis Guzman). She seems to accept the mystery of the cigarettes, but every time we see her, she either mentions them or looks at them or talks about them. This is used to illustrate the state of their relationship, but it really just illustrates the state of our fatigue at sitting in the theater for so long. Conor pursues Anna and wants to have a committed relationship with her. But she is attracted to Ben. And he can't sleep with her because it would affect his marriage. These three circle each other, engaging in various conversations. Soon, it really seems like some scenes are being repeated, almost verboten. And it becomes a chore to sit through the film.A big part of the problem is the film is too long. Way too long, by like 30 or 40 minutes. At 129 minutes (it seems longer), this romantic comedy/ drama has too much time on its hands giving it the luxury to rehash stories and ideas we have already seen. If the film were, say, 90 minutes, a lot of this repetition would be impossible and the film would seem funnier (because the laughs would be more closely spaced together) and overall better (because everything would move at a faster pace.Producer Drew Barrymore and her business partner Nancy Juvonen are smart producers. Adapting a 'self-help' book in to a fictional romantic comedy/ drama seems like an iffy proposition at best. But they clearly saw that it could work and adapting the former mega bestseller into a movie has now created a hugely popular movie going experience. Barrymore and Juvonen are also behind the ""Charlie's Angels"" films. So, they clearly recognize material that will draw people to the multiplex. It's too bad they can't recognize quality material and bring better films to the same legions of people so willing to drop $10 for a movie ticket.Throughout the film, there are a number of moments when the screen flashes a line, presumably a bon mote of self-help gleamed from the bestseller. Then, we watch as a random person tells a quick story about their romantic life meant to illustrate this statement. Why are random people talking to us? Some of these moments are funny, but wouldn't it be a better idea to use the well-known actors you already have in the film for these moments? It would also help to make us more familiar with these same characters as we would get another little glimpse into their characters. Too bad. A wasted opportunity. As they stand, these moments only serve to make the film seem even longer.""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a good date movie. But I would really recommend renting it on DVD and forcing your boyfriend to watch it with you at home. He will quickly become so bored he will agree to do anything for you. You could probably get him to clean the house, bake a pie, run the vacuum. Because it will quickly become apparent that He's Just Not That Into This Film.",3,Very Long Rom Com Dram,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,6277,"['Five', 'very', 'likable', 'couples', 'have',

1152091,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00164KYV4,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[8, 15]","There are a lot ofLove Actually (Widescreen Edition)haters in the world. One can see their point since that's a movie that isn't content with one desperate love story and instead goes along to follow half a dozen of those things leading to a nicely packaged happy ending and some material about airplanes. But that's actually an enjoyable and charming movie.This thing on the other hand is awful. And it's awful for one very important reason. No one talks about ANYTHING but their stupid relationships. Do these people have jobs? Hobbies? House pets? Books? And by books I mean books that aren't Self-Help books? Apparently not because they can only talk about their relationships with Justin Long being the voice of the stand up comedian who wrote that stupid book in the first place. And with all that talking about relationships, you'd think they'd figure this stuff out already. Yet when Ginnifer Goodwin advances the wisdom of that self-help book (like when a guy doesn't call for a week it means that he's not going to call) they all act surprised. As if this is some kind of revelation and not the stuff we all learned in college.The movie follows five or six or a billion relationships in various stages including the just dating, the married but miserable, the extramarital affair, the...something...internet...I'm sorry. I'm just too bored to care. And everyone talks about their relationships. They can only talk about the relationship. You know how you call your friend up after he or she has gotten dumped or just been on a good date and you can't get your friend to change the subject because it's all just right there and that's the only thing he or she wants to talk about. Imagine that all of your friends suddenly got dumped or hooked up with ""could be the one"" at the same exact second - and then imagine that instead of your friends, you are talking to a dozen people who you don't know but treat you like you should care as if you are bestest friends in the whole world. And then imagine it going on for two or three or 15 hours (but feels like forever). And you have some inkling of how terrible this movie is for you.And there are 4 gay friends. And like all gay friends in Rom Coms, their sole function is to primp, preen, flame and tell the fat girl that she's pretty. And the fat girl is Drew Barrymore so does she really need that kind of emotional support? Sure, she is sharing the movie with highly gorgeous women like Jennifer Connelly and Scarlett Johansson but that doesn't mean that she needs an army of queens giving her support. Can't she just work on her own issues alone and cut those gay dudes loose so they can date. I know that gay men don't get any action in Rom Comms, but they could do it off camera at least.Worst of all, this movie made me respectThe Way We Were (Special Edition). Sure it's a screechy movie in which Barbara Streissand is a Commie Rat (and her character in the movie is pretty extreme and leftwing too) but at least Robert Redford and Streissand have ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS about real life things like politics and real estate and jobs and NOT just about their relationship. It's still a bad movie but at least it's not as wretched as this thing.",1,Never again.

I kind of knew what to expect, but at the same time I also didn't. After having seen it now, I'd have to say that it was a pretty good movie. I hesitate to say that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen because it didn't quite have that quality that I look for when I think of a movie as truly great. It was most definitely a lot different than some of those typical, run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. This was in my opinion one of the better if not the best romantic comedies that I've ever seen, and that's saying something. I'm not saying that I've seen every single Rom-Com out there, but I've seen my fair share of them. The movie called Definitely Maybe is pretty much the only other one that I consider to be a really good Rom-Com. Well, maybe not but it's the first one that comes to mind. I like it when a movie's plot isn't super complicated and you're trying to figure out what on earth is going on while still paying attention to the movie. This movie was very easy to follow. At first, I was going to say that one of the relationships that takes place in the movie seemed a bit much or something like that, but as I continued to write my review, I realized that it kind of drove the point home a little more by having that relationship there in the movie.

1152096,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B00164KYV4,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[2, 2]","This is one of my favorite romantic movies.  I think Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White,ONCE UPON A TIME) is amazing here, Ben Affleck too, everyone in top form, including Bradley Cooper, though playing an unlikable character, and charming Justin Long as Ginnifer Goodwin's love interest (Long played the nerdy teen advising Tim Allen & Sigourney Weaver via communicator-""Just push the blue button!""- inGalaxy Quest). Though there are multiple stories told, the characters are well-developed, in relation to each other, in many pithy, seminal scenes.  Great, natural dialogue.  Personally, I think this movie superior to LOVE, ACTUALLY- more natural, less contrived.  Note, for example, the great subtlety and yet significance of the scene in which Bradley Cooper declines Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette.  Another reason I love this is the strong chemistry between all the characters, friends as well as lovers.  And the ending- where all the loose ends are tied up- not just one happy ending but several- perfectly punctuated by Keane's marvelous ""Somewhere Only We Know"", followed by the Cure, wonderful.  And be SURE to stay tuned for the credits, because the movie continues for a few minutes after they begin to roll.I read a few of the negative reviews and on reflection, I must say that I didn't find this movie funny either- honest, charming and moving, yes- funny, no.I enjoyed the deleted scenes, hearing the director's rationale for deleting them.  They would've detracted from the flow, true, but provide great backstory so watch them if you like the film (btw, the one with Scarlett Johannson singing in the cocktail lounge appears to have been filmed in the Observation Bar on the Queen Mary).  Only one small quibble do I have, and that involves being taken aback by some of the awful hair styles sported by the women (Goodwin and Johansson in particular), and in some cases, poor makeup (and/or lighting).  Granted, everybody doesn't have to look perfect all the time, but it's quite a feat to make these beautiful women look haggard, as they do in several scenes (not Goodwin, she's radiant, though WHAT is up with her hair?).  But don't let this distract you- this movie has romance, heart, charm, and wisdom, in my humble opinion.  Granted, it's no feminist manifesto, but even so, it makes some sharp observations about relations between the sexes.  I dare say a large percentage of people in this world spend an inordinate amount of time looking for someone to love and love them, the central theme of the film.There was a mis-step perhaps in that Johannson storms out of Ben's office without bothering to put her dress back on, that might have raised a few eyebrows.  Lastly, I would have found it satisfying had Jennifer Connolly ended up with Javier, but that didn't happen, darn it.  I think you'll find this well worth your time, and you won't soon forget the characters and what happens to them.",5,One of the BEST romantic movies ever...,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2920,"['one', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'movies', 'think', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Snow', 'White', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'amazing', 'here', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'too', 'everyone', 'top', 'form', 'including', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'playing', 'unlikable', 'character', 'charming', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'love', 'interest', 'Long', 'played', 'nerdy', 'teen', 'advising', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'communicator-', 'Just', 'push', 'blue', 'button', 'inGalaxy', 'Quest', 'are', 'multiple', 'stories', 'told', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'relation', 'other', 'many', 'pithy', 'seminal', 'scenes', 'Great', 'natural', 'dialogue', 'Personally', 'think', 'movie', 'LOVE', 'ACTUALLY-', 'more', 'natural', 'less', 'contrived', 'Note', 'example', 'great', 'subtlety', 'yet', 'significance', 'scene', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'offer', 'cigarette', 'reason', 'love', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'lovers', 'ending-', 'where', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up-', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'happy', 'ending', 'several-', 'perfectly', 'punctuated', 'Keane', 'marvelous', 'Somewhere', 'Only', 'Know', 'followed', 'Cure', 'wonderful', 'be', 'SURE', 'stay', 'tuned', 'credits', 'movie', 'few', 'minutes', 'begin', 'roll.I', 'read', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', 'reflection', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'funny', 'either-', 'honest', 'charming', 'moving', 'yes-', 'funny', 'no.I', 'enjoyed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hearing', 'director', 'rationale', 'deleting', 'would', ""'ve"", 'detracted', 'flow', 'true', 'provide', 'great', 'backstory', 'so', 'watch', 'like', 'film', 'btw', 'one', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'singing', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'Observation', 'Bar', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Only', 'one', 'small', 'quibble', 'do', 'have', 'being', 'taken', 'aback', 'awful', 'hair', 'styles', 'sported', 'women', 'Goodwin', 'Johansson', 'particular', 'cases', 'poor', 'makeup', 'lighting', 'Granted', 'everybody', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'perfect', 'time', 'quite', 'feat', 'make', 'beautiful', 'women', 'look', 'haggard', 'do', 'several', 'scenes', 'not', 'Goodwin', 'radiant', 'WHAT', 'up', 'hair', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'distract', 'you-', 'movie', 'romance', 'heart', 'charm', 'wisdom', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Granted', 'feminist', 'manifesto', 'even', 'so', 'sharp', 'observations', 'relations', 'sexes', 'dare', 'say', 'large', 'percentage', 'people', 'world', 'spend', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'looking', 'someone', 'love', 'love', 'central', 'theme', 'film.There', 'was', 'mis-step', 'perhaps', 'Johannson', 'Ben', 'office', 'bothering', 'put', 'dress', 'back', 'might', 'have', 'raised', 'few', 'eyebrows', 'Lastly', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'satisfying', 'had', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'ended', 'up', 'Javier', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'darn', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'well', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'characters', 'what']",He's Just Not That Into You

Her character is a complete afterthought and it's almost as if the production went on and then 3/4 of the way through shooting the thing the Assistant Director had to remind everyone, ""Hey, we've had Drew Barrymore over there in her trailer for the first 45 days of the shoot...do you want to use her at all? ""It's just two hours of people whining about relationships and I suppose it's all supposed to be poignant, but it's nothing you haven't seen on 'The Young & The Restless'.This movie is just an elongated soap opera, really.If you want to know the secret to a great relationship, then watch my movie when it comes out.

1152099,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00164KYV4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","In ""He's Just Not That Into You"" you will see five women in Baltimore area - Anna (Scarlett Johansson), Beth (Jennifer Aniston), Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Mary (Drew Barrymore) - seeking for true love in the intertwined tales of love and romance. The male stars include Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and Justin Long. The cast is impressive. Unfortunately, the characters they are playing are not.All the characters in the film are stereotyped and underdeveloped, commonplace, almost a banality itself. What surprised me is, talented players like Drew Barrymore are so boring in most of the scenes, never being allowed to shine. Actually, most of the characters, males or females alike, come across as flat and simplistic. OK, but maybe that is the point of the film. There are lots of talks about love and relationship, but few of them are really funny or insightful. Maybe that's only me.What really surprised me is that despite (or because of) the best efforts from the actors, some of the characters are annoying beyond belief. Take self-deluded Gigi, for example. She constantly ""misreads"" the signs of men and she is seen waiting for phone call we know she will never receive. Gigi's life consists of only one action, which is presented in an exaggerated, unfunny way, and is often painful to see. But suddenly, all her problems are solved so easily. Why don't they give her a chance, just for once, to act like a real person?I think an ensemble story is the hardest kind of story to handle in film. Just casting Hollywood's A-list actors is not enough. Every character and his/her episodes must be equally engaging and you need special cinematic narrative skills. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is directed by Ken Kwapis who did a good job in his ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" but still he is no Robert Altman.

1152100,A27XZS1UKWJY7F,B00164KYV4,"William Hermann ""Willy""","[13, 28]","I am going to do my best to write a proper review for this flick BECAUSE I HATE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. And I want to share that hate with you.We open with giant bubble of perkiness Gennifer Goodwin as Gigi as a child, with her older self giving a voice-over. She is a young girl on a playground, and a boy comes over to her and shoves her to the ground. She runs crying to her mother, and her mother says the boy did it because he likes her. Gigi then speculates that this is what screws with so many women's heads and messes with them later in life, because they come to associate bad behavior by men with affection. We then join Gigi as an adult at the end of a date with Conor, this totally bland yuppie. He says he'll give her a call and she gets excited when she sees him taking his cell phone out, but he calls Scarlett Johansson as Anna. She tells him she doesn't want to get together just then, and gets ridiculously excited over this cooler she won [it's depressing to see Scarlett Johansson have to act so stupid], and flirts with the guy behind her in line, Ben. He's a music producer and she's an aspiring singer, but he tells her he can't hear from her, because he's married... to Jennifer Connelly as Janine, who works in the same office as Gigi and Jennifer Aniston as Betsy, at some magazine [this is the Cosmopolitan magazine version of life, in which everyone works at a magazine or is a yoga instructor or a music producer]. Betsy has been living with Ben Affleck as Neil for seven years, but he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't believe in marriage. Which, in this movie, is less preferable to being a Satanist, say, or a leper. Oh, and by the way, all of this is supposedly happening in Baltimore. Have you ever BEEN to Baltimore?So Gigi starts obsessing over Conor calling, although we have no evidence that they had any particular chemistry or connection. She waits for him to call, staring at her phone at work! In the shower! At her yoga class! Janine advises her on when to call and for how long. Soon she's planning on just ""stopping by"" a place he said he sometimes frequents in order to engineer a run-in with him. The majority of the first half-hour here is made up of Gigi growing more obsessive about whether Conor, who you will recall she met once, will call, with her entire sense of self-worth apparently hanging in the balance. It gets to the point where she really does seem to be the badly-damaged shell of what once was a human being. She does go to the restaurant he said he frequents, where she ends up meeting his friend, Alex, played by Justin Long, who apparently runs the place. He came out to help at the bar, as they were super busy, but apparently has time to just sit around and talk to Gigi all night. He tells her flat-out that Conor will never call, because--can you guess?--He's Just Not That Into Her. Alex will be the one to deliver the major bullet points of the self-help book this is adapted from for the remainder of the movie. He also tells her that too many women hear what amounts to urban legends about women who didn't give up on a guy, and finally he relented and they got married. He says too many women think that they'll be ""the exception"" when in fact they are ""the rule."" Gigi seems over Conor the next day at work--where apparently their jobs consist of sitting around and obsessing over relationships.SPOILERS > > > Meanwhile, Ben has decided that there's no harm in flirting with Anna, and calls her. This involves him smoking cigarettes on the sly, which he tries, through several scenes and numerous lies, to keep from his wife, Janine. The issue slowly starts to gnaw at her sanity, as she knows something is wrong, but Ben won't admit it. There is a bizarre scene in which she accuses Luis Guzman's contractors of smoking while they work on renovating their house. Once it's revealed that Ben actually is smoking, she says ""What part of `my father died of lung cancer' is so hard for you to understand?"" as though her personal trauma gives her license to completely control his life. Eventually he comes clean that he had an affair, expecting her to simply dump him, then surprised that she wants to talk about it and work it out. Janine blames herself. It must be said that this is the only thread of the movie that feel in any way genuine, as Jennifer Connelly is able to bring some real, grounded emotion to it.Meanwhile Betsy grows more and more upset that Neil won't marry her, despite his repeated assurances that he loves her, and doesn't believe in marriage on ideological grounds. Idi-a-whatdicalogical grounds? Janine says. When Alex gives Gigi the advice that if a guy hasn't married you after two years, he isn't going to marry you, Betsy goes home and tells Neil that ""she needs him to not be nice to her if he isn't going to marry her."" This is the sort of ""kooky"" statement that some women apparently think is adorable [this movie made me really glad not to be straight]. Anyway, despite the fact that their relationship is going swimmingly, Betsy ""Can't do this"" and breaks up with Neil for not marrying her. In here we briefly see Drew Barrymore in a tiny part that has no relation to anything. Nevertheless, Drew produced the film, so special scorn must be heaped on her.So some of the corollary advice to ""if a man hasn't married you... he's not going to marry you"" that Alex gives Gigi is that ""If a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."" This casts the whole situation as that all women are desperate for men to call, and are delighted to hear from and date any man, while men are completely in control of the situation, and can choose to call the woman back or not, as they like. If they want to see a woman, the woman WILL see them. I'm sure several men out there would be quite surprised to find out that this is the case. Anyway, Gigi shows that she has actually not grown beyond her desperate yearning for a boyfriend above all else, only altered the context of her delusions, as she starts to believe that Alex is secretly in love with her, and has been telling her this in code all along. She accepts his invitation to a party as the fruition of their secret passion, and finally makes an ill-advised move on him.He tells her that no, he is actually not secretly in love with her, causing her to deliver a withering character assessment about how he just uses people and never really connects to anyone, concluding ""You have not won. You're alone, Alex."" We'll leave until later discussion of WHAT Gigi could possibly mean by classifying the entire issue into ""winning"" and ""losing,"" with finding companionship [regardless of with who?] definitively posed as ""winning.""Okay, time to arbitrarily stop the movie and wrap everything up! Time's up, folks! Betsy and Neil get back together! And guess what? He proposes in a cute, TV-movie way, and they get married! Mary [that's Drew] and Conor get together! Anna has a singing gig [i.e. she hasn't found a relationship, but she's on her way to pursuing her dream]! Janine and Ben, surprise, break up, and she moves out! And Gigi's harsh character assessment was exactly what Alex needed to realize that goll-darn it, she's right! And in fact, she is the very woman he must spend the rest of his life with! They've WON. &lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDThe primary emotion this movie evokes is sadness for people who view relationships this way, and the people who will watch this movie and feel that they must adopt to these standards in order to find a relationship, and hence to ""win."" Gigi is a character clearly in need of several years of reparative therapy for her wildly distorted view of her own value and human relationships, yet the movie tries to coast on a ""We're all like this, deep inside!"" vibe. The pathetic obsession she develops over whether Conor will call her is embarrassing and sad, not adorable. Her lack of insight developed through the film--she simply switches fantasy-based obsession with Conor for fantasy-based obsession with Alex--is also disheartening. Yet the film has no criticism of her, it holds her up as a model for the winning strategy of being sincere and open to people, which apparently trumps all other characteristics--like, say, wisdom or intelligence. By the time she indicates that for her, being partnered is ""winning"" and being alone ""losing,"" one pities her distorted view of relationships, but the point of the view of the movie is that this is pretty much the way things are.Betsy is blind to the attributes of her relationship, and only the public validation of a wedding can make it real to her. At which point she can begin looking forward to the next milestone, having a baby [as Janine wishes to do], with an option to also achieve wonderful completions of self such as renovating one's fabulous loft! Really, you should receive two free issues of Cosmopolitan with your ticket purchase, which will convert to a full subscription unless you cancel.The movie really is disconcerting and uncomfortable in the way that it suggests that all women are wholly mentally preoccupied with guys, whether a guy will call, whether they'll have a relationship [they'll WIN!], and then get married, then renovate the loft, then have a baby! After that, I suppose life ends? Or I think perhaps you flip into being the bitter wife whose husband likes younger women but its okay because you have the credit card to acquire shoes and redo the house again? While watching the movie I kept wondering at the mindset--and set-up for disappointment--that people who share this film's worldview must have. I mean, WHAT is going to happen after you've finally scored that relationship? After you've ""won?"" And most of all, after one has married, that ultimate milestone and validation of all that is you! Most films end with marriage and don't bother to show what comes after, but this one really egregiously sets that up as the ultimate prize, to the point where one begins to worry about the people that might be taken in by this viewpoint. We all know that one person who just keeps talking about having a relationship, and their new strategy for getting a relationship, and how their main focus is on finding a relationship, and after a while you want to say ""Um, what do you think is going to HAPPEN when you find this mythical relationship? You're going to be delivered into some blissful state of endless nirvana and never have any other concerns or problems again?"" Because like those people, this movie just kind of makes you WORRY for those people that have this distorted viewpoint, and wish that somehow they could just undergo a complete, ground-up change of mind.Let's again underscore this film's view of women as vacuous bundles of emotional need who seem unable or unwilling to process anything that doesn't have to do with DATING! And superficial symbols of personal validation such as someone thinking one is cute or calling one back. The irony is that this is positioning itself so heavily as a ""chick flick,"" and to be supportive of women, when in fact it is painting them as neurotic and shallow strivers with significantly warped self-images, lacking any secure sense of self [except that which they think they should SEEM to have in order to be more DATABLE!] and desperate for the validation of any fleeting attention from even the most unsuitable of men. It's just sad, more than anything! Talk about the five-hankie weeper of the year. OH, and by the way, this is apparently supposed to be a ""comedy.""Really, I don't understand why feminists weren't burning theaters down when this was out.The ultimate betrayal this movie is guilty of is devoting two hours to trying to strip women of their delusions about romance and get them to accept that the ""fairy tale"" ending they yearn for is not a reality--then end is such a way that nearly all the characters achieve that magical, surprise fairy tale ending! And like in the fairy tale, it leaves the women in the audience, the ones in supposedly supports, with the old ""they lived happily ever after"" and doesn't bother to include what might happen as these people continue to live their lives. But whatever, they've ""WON!""This is one of those things where one feels that the director, Ken Kwapis, and the screenwriters, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, really need to be exiled to a desert island, where they can inflict no more damage on society. You will need chemical decontamination after this film and women, please do not let your daughters watch this damaging film.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?There really are no circumstances under which that is advisable--except maybe in a college women's studies class.",1,Women deserve more credit...,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,12678,"['am', 'going', 'do', 'best', 'write', 'proper', 'review', 'flick',
