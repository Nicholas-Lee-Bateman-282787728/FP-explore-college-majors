1668646,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00ET2ODM6,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","The bleak and dreary atmosphere in &#34;All is Bright&#34; is regrettably a dead giveaway for the events that are about to transpire. You can see the big turning point in the climax coming a mile away. Dennis and Rene keep talking about this job that went bad; Dennis as the thief and Rene as the safe-cracker. It was a two man job that Rene backed out of at the last minute. Dennis tried to do the job anyway, got caught, and did four years because of it. Everything that happens in the film doesn't live up to imagining these two guys robbing banks, executing heists, and/or stealing from people. Who wouldn't want to see Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd being criminals together on screen while screaming at each other and wisecracking with one another? That sounds like the hilarious and exciting film that &#8220;All is Bright&#8221; tried to con itself off as. You are left with this burning desire to see this failed escapade, but are left mostly with emotional scraps that are both unfunny and illogical.The dramatic comedy juggles the feeble and unpredictable Christmas tree selling business and the love triangle between Dennis, Therese, and Rene; Dennis as the ex who hasn't accepted that he's been forced out of the picture and Rene stepping in as the man of the household. Dennis tries so hard to live a straight life, but is forced to steal just to survive in New York. He bonds with the brutally honest and blunt Olga (Sally Hawkins), who is also their first customer. Dennis tries to educate himself to give people their money's worth while Rene tries to con them with his charm and a fake French accent. Unfortunately for Dennis, Rene is extremely sensitive, incredibly unreliable, noticeably distracted by other women, and disappears for days on end at the drop of a hat.&#34;All is Bright&#34; is the most amusing when Paul Giamatti is pushed to the edge. The scene where he deals with a rival Christmas tree selling vendor is perhaps the film's crowning achievement. Paul Rudd's Nordic martial arts is mildly entertaining but he has this rather spectacular vomiting scene that seems like more of a triumph and the direct way Sally Hawkins speaks to people (&#34;Throw up in tree stand. Not on hard wood floor.&#34;) is also worthy of a chuckle or two. But it seems as though Dennis' innocent desire to get his daughter a wonderful Christmas gift dumbs down the entire film. He's dead set on doing such an unselfish act for his daughter because he promised that to her; not in person but in his head. How Dennis goes about attempting to do that is extremely idiotic and unbelievable. Life kicking you in the groin when you're already down is a common theme in the film, but the way Dennis and Rene try to counter that is completely set on impulse and not something that could realistically occur.&#34;All is Bright&#34; isn't even two hours long, but it feels so elongated because there is literally nothing there to hold your interest. The Blu-ray cover says Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd have chemistry in the film and yet you don't feel it; shouting at one another doesn&#8217;t pass as an emotional investment from both actors. The film is nothing more than empty threats and bottomless desires haphazardly thrown together around a more interesting event that you never get to see. Imagine Indiana Jones solely talking about his adventures in his classroom and you never getting to see him outrun a boulder, escape from the Temple of Doom, or find the Holy Grail. That's what &#34;All is Bright&#34; is; verbal diarrhea centered around nothing of importance.",2,Paul Giamatti's chaotic sideburns will overwhelm you,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,3574,"['bleak', 'dreary', 'atmosphere', '34', 'Bright', '34', 'regrettably', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'events', 'are', 'transpire', 'can', 'see', 'big', 'turning', 'point', 'climax', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Dennis', 'Rene', 'keep', 'talking', 'job', 'went', 'bad', 'Dennis', 'thief', 'Rene', 'safe-cracker', 'was', 'two', 'man', 'job', 'Rene', 'backed', 'last', 'minute', 'Dennis', 'tried', 'do', 'job', 'anyway', 'got', 'caught', 'did', 'four', 'years', 'Everything', 'film', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'imagining', 'two', 'guys', 'robbing', 'banks', 'executing', 'heists', 'and/or', 'stealing', 'people', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'being', 'criminals', 'together', 'screen', 'screaming', 'other', 'wisecracking', 'one', 'hilarious', 'exciting', 'film', '8220', 'Bright', '8221', 'tried', 'con', 'off', 'as', 'are', 'left', 'burning', 'desire', 'see', 'failed', 'escapade', 'are', 'left', 'mostly', 'emotional', 'scraps', 'are', 'unfunny', 'illogical.The', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'feeble', 'unpredictable', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'selling', 'business', 'love', 'triangle', 'Dennis', 'Therese', 'Rene', 'Dennis', 'ex', 'who', ""n't"", 'accepted', 'been', 'forced', 'picture', 'Rene', 'stepping', 'man', 'household', 'Dennis', 'so', 'hard', 'live', 'straight', 'life', 'forced', 'steal', 'just', 'survive', 'New', 'York', 'bonds', 'brutally', 'honest', 'blunt', 'Olga', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'who', 'also', 'first', 'customer', 'Dennis', 'educate', 'give', 'people', 'money', 'worth', 'Rene', 'tries', 'con', 'charm', 'fake', 'French', 'accent', 'Unfortunately', 'Dennis', 'Rene', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'incredibly', 'unreliable', 'noticeably', 'distracted', 'other', 'women', 'disappears', 'days', 'end', 'drop', 'hat.', '34', 'Bright', '34', 'most', 'amusing', 'when', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'pushed', 'edge', 'scene', 'where', 'rival', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'selling', 'vendor', 'perhaps', 'film', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Nordic', 'martial', 'arts', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'vomiting', 'scene', 'more', 'triumph', 'direct', 'way', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'people', '34', 'Throw', 'up', 'tree', 'stand', 'Not', 'hard', 'wood', 'floor.', '34', 'also', 'worthy', 'chuckle', 'two', 'Dennis', 'innocent', 'desire', 'get', 'daughter', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'down', 'entire', 'film', 'dead', 'set', 'doing', 'such', 'unselfish', 'act', 'daughter', 'promised', 'not', 'person', 'head', 'How', 'Dennis', 'about', 'attempting', 'do', 'extremely', 'idiotic', 'unbelievable', 'Life', 'kicking', 'groin', 'when', ""'re"", 'already', 'down', 'common', 'theme', 'film', 'way', 'Dennis', 'Rene', 'try', 'counter', 'completely', 'set', 'impulse', 'not', 'something', 'could', 'realistically', 'occur.', '34', 'Bright', '34', ""n't"", 'even', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'so', 'elongated', 'literally', 'nothing', 'there', 'hold', 'interest', 'Blu-ray', 'cover', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'have', 'chemistry', 'film', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'shouting', 'one', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'pass', 'emotional', 'investment', 'actors', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'empty', 'threats', 'bottomless', 'desires', 'haphazardly', 'together', 'more', 'interesting', 'event', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Imagine', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'solely', 'talking', 'adventures', 'classroom', 'never', 'getting', 'see', 'outrun', 'boulder', 'escape', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'find', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'what', '34', 'Bright', '34', 'verbal', 'diarrhea', 'centered', 'nothing', 'importance']",N/A

Rene just wants to earn enough money to buy his girlfriend Therese (Amy Landecker) an engagement ring.  Therese also happens to be Dennis' ex-wife so there is an obvious friction between the two business partners.  Along the way they meet a sundry  assortment of characters including a  Russian dental assistant, Olga (Sally Hawkins), who sympathizes with sad sack Dennis.  ""All Is Bright"" is at turns funny and poignant.  Giamatti plays Dennis with a degree of sullen pathos and Rudd's Rene is affable.  The chemistry between these two underrated veteran actors sparkles.  Director Phil Morrison establishes a melancholic mood which is punctuated by a terrific soft jazz score of holiday standards.

1668649,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00ET2ODM6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","ALL IS BRIGHT (Prod. Paul and Elizabeth Giamatti, Dir. Phil Morrisson, 2013, 109 minutes) ~Just having seen this sleeper gem on the STARZ Channel, I think I disagree with those who bash this for not being a ""Christmas movie"". It is clearly not intended to be a ""Christmas movie"", or Giamatti and Company would have rendered it fit for Hallmark. But I will readily slap Giamatti's wrist if he tried cashing in on the season and led people to think it was a Christmas film.Which in any case it is, like it or not: it takes place around Christmas and has Christmas tradition at its core.This is a deep, emotional and hilarious anti-confection (what would that be, exactly, Brussels sprouts, which I love?). Paroled 'Quebecoise' burglar Denis Gerard (a most brilliant Paul Giamatti) finds his beloved wife has told their beloved little daughter that her father has died of cancer. Even worse, he discovers from his wife that his partner-in-crime and best friend Rene (a most capable Paul Rudd) has asked the wife to marry HIM when his own divorce comes through.After relieving his pain by smashing in Rene's face, Denis asks for work--and Rene, reluctant as ever, agrees. He has gone straight and Denis intends to do the same. So ... the job?---selling Christmas trees in New York City. That was a new one I still ain't sure I can buy: are we to believe pee-poor Canadians creep into New York to make money?! Do not take the names of Aykroyd or Shatner in vain!Anyway, this is a brilliant, slightly dark comedy (more dark realism than cinematic darkness). It smacks totally true-to-life (I'm still on the fence about poor Canadians coming to work here). Both Rudd and Giamatti perform excellent Canadian accents, which is no mean feat since they are French Canadians and that accent is tougher than Cajun to perform. In its entirety, I cannot fathom the R-rating, which in my view is unfair.The music is delightful and nonintrusive; the cinematography, which could easily have been the stupid running-from-a-volcano stuff, is good, steady work. The wit in the dialogue is such that I doubt anyone will catch it all on the first viewing. As an official dum-dum, I had to--and indeed was dying to--watch it again and again to drink in the whole experience.I have to mention the Russian house sitter, Olga--this lady steals the show and you would do well to study the level of her acting here. I will spoil one tiny hilarious line, when she is explaining where the homeowners are vacationing: ""They will be returning to palace [that's what she calls the house she is sitting] soon from Hole of Jackson,"" she whines urgently in her drop-dead funny accent.This was filmed on location in New York. The love and care going into this project are evident in every second. The performances are solid and there is absolutely none of the film-flam (my term, don't steal it, it's 'flim-flam' of the film world, get it?) of typical arthouse or indie garbage, which oddly enough, is all I can think to compare to this masterpiece because those rancid films WISH they were of this caliber.The only things that came to my mind that could compare to this were some of those dreary, humorless Russian Bolshevik socialist-themed plays from the early 20th century. Then again, it seems Western film does tend to turn a bit Bolshie-socialist at the holidays.There is, in fact, a very tiny list of films with which to compare it and I will not insult your intellect by listing them. As to the story, be patient, enjoy this as it should be: a modern blend of Twain, Dickens and Shakespeare. It takes its time because all of it is the story--though the ending will make you laugh aloud while you are hurting inside. It did that for me.ALL IS BRIGHT is meant to touch various portions of the soul, the brain and whatever the devil else resides between those two--all in all, a damned good Christmas movie if you ask me, and a superior film for all time.",5,"Giamatti deserved an Oscar, the film deserved an Oscar ... so how many dozen people ever saw it?",1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,3923,"['IS', 'BRIGHT', 'Prod', 'Paul', 'Elizabeth', 'Giamatti', 'Dir', 'Phil', 'Morrisson', '2013', '109', 'minutes', '~Just', 'having', 'seen', 'sleeper', 'gem', 'STARZ', 'Channel', 'think', 'disagree', 'who', 'bash', 'not', 'being', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'clearly', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Giamatti', 'Company', 'would', 'have', 'rendered', 'fit', 'Hallmark', 'will', 'readily', 'slap', 'Giamatti', 'wrist', 'tried', 'cashing', 'season', 'led', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'Christmas', 'film.Which', 'case', 'not', 'place', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'tradition', 'core.This', 'deep', 'emotional', 'hilarious', 'anti-confection', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'exactly', 'Brussels', 'sprouts', 'love', 'Paroled', ""'Quebecoise"", 'burglar', 'Denis', 'Gerard', 'most', 'brilliant', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'beloved', 'wife', 'told', 'beloved', 'little', 'daughter', 'father', 'died', 'cancer', 'Even', 'worse', 'wife', 'partner-in-crime', 'best', 'friend', 'Rene', 'most', 'capable', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'asked', 'wife', 'marry', 'HIM', 'when', 'own', 'divorce', 'through.After', 'relieving', 'pain', 'smashing', 'Rene', 'face', 'Denis', 'work', 'Rene', 'reluctant', 'ever', 'gone', 'straight', 'Denis', 'do', 'same', 'So', 'job', '-selling', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'new', 'one', 'still', 'ai', ""n't"", 'sure', 'can', 'buy', 'are', 'believe', 'pee-poor', 'Canadians', 'creep', 'New', 'York', 'make', 'money', 'not', 'take', 'names', 'Aykroyd', 'Shatner', 'vain', 'Anyway', 'brilliant', 'slightly', 'dark', 'comedy', 'more', 'dark', 'realism', 'cinematic', 'darkness', 'totally', 'true-to-life', ""'m"", 'still', 'fence', 'poor', 'Canadians', 'coming', 'work', 'here', 'Rudd', 'Giamatti', 'perform', 'excellent', 'Canadian', 'accents', 'mean', 'feat', 'are', 'French', 'Canadians', 'accent', 'tougher', 'Cajun', 'perform', 'entirety', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'R-rating', 'view', 'unfair.The', 'music', 'delightful', 'nonintrusive', 'cinematography', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'stupid', 'running-from-a-volcano', 'stuff', 'good', 'steady', 'work', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'such', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'catch', 'first', 'viewing', 'official', 'dum-dum', 'had', 'indeed', 'was', 'dying', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'drink', 'whole', 'experience.I', 'have', 'mention', 'Russian', 'house', 'sitter', 'Olga', 'lady', 'show', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'study', 'level', 'acting', 'here', 'will', 'spoil', 'one', 'tiny', 'hilarious', 'line', 'when', 'explaining', 'where', 'homeowners', 'are', 'vacationing', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'palace', '[', 'what', 'house', 'sitting', ']', 'soon', 'Hole', 'Jackson', 'urgently', 'drop-dead', 'funny', 'accent.This', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'love', 'care', 'going', 'project', 'are', 'evident', 'second', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'absolutely', 'none', 'film-flam', 'term', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', ""'flim-flam"", 'film', 'world', 'get', 'typical', 'arthouse', 'indie', 'garbage', 'oddly', 'enough', 'can', 'think', 'compare', 'masterpiece', 'rancid', 'films', 'were', 'caliber.The', 'only', 'things', 'came', 'mind', 'could', 'compare', 'were', 'dreary', 'humorless', 'Russian', 'Bolshevik', 'socialist-themed', 'plays', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Then', 'again', 'Western', 'film', 'tend', 'turn', 'bit', 'Bolshie-socialist', 'holidays.There', 'fact', 'very', 'tiny', 'list', 'films', 'compare', 'will', 'not', 'insult', 'intellect', 'listing', 'story', 'be', 'patient', 'enjoy', 'should', 'be', 'modern', 'blend', 'Twain', 'Dickens', 'Shakespeare', 'time', 'story', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'aloud', 'are', 'hurting', 'did', 'me.ALL', 'IS', 'BRIGHT', 'meant', 'touch', 'various', 'portions', 'soul', 'brain', 'whatever', 'devil', 'else', 'two', 'damned', 'good', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'ask', 'superior', 'film', 'time']",N/A
1668650,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00ET2ODM6,FNDNreview,"[4, 7]","Phil Morrison (Junebug) directs the holiday comedy drama, All is Bright - starring Paul Giamatti as Dennis and Paul Rudd as Rene.  Dennis has just been released for a four year stint in jail, only to return to his home and find that his wife, Therese (Amy Landecker), is now ready to marry his friend and former thief partner, Rene.  Not only has Therese moved on from Dennis with his friend, but she's also told their daughter, Michi (Tatyana Richaud), that he died from cancer - painfully.  Without a job, Dennis turns to Rene for assistance - and it just so happens Rene is about to leave for New York City to sell Christmas trees.  Dennis accompanies Rene to the Big Apple where he must contend with the idea that he's lost his wife to his friend, while attempting to resist the urge to fall back into a lifestyle of thievery.  Sally Hawkins, Coman Domingo, and Gordon Joseph Weiss also star in supporting roles.There's actually very little that's ""bright"" about this film (formally called Almost Christmas), often featuring a damp mood, surrounded by complete and utter uncertainty.  There might be a major dose of realism in this flick - since it depicts the consequences of a man's life after doing hard time in jail, but that's not the typical mood the average Christmas movie lover wants during the holidays. Ultimately, this seasonal film suffers from a massive lack of direction and more often than not struggles to find a driving point.  This isn't a story about redemption or righting past misdoings, it's strictly about one man's struggle to cope with the outcome of his previous choices in life.  There are no ghosts of Christmas past, present, or future, in this particular story.  The damage has been done, and it's basically a doomsday scenario for Paul Giamotti's character, Dennis - forced to wonder about and wallow in his current predicament of no job, no family, and an untrustworthy friend.One of the few reasons I've even bothered to give this film any attention is solely based on my appreciation for the contributions of Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd to the film industry.  There's not much you can possibly say about the previous and impressive roles of Paul Giamatti that hasn't been said already.  He is an actor that will never give a poor performance, regardless of the writing or storytelling.  Without a doubt, Giamatti belongs in the conversation of elite Hollywood actors and is by far and away one of the most talented individuals in the business.  His co-star, Paul Rudd, is a different story - and that shouldn't be taken in a negative context. It just so happens he has taken a different career path than Giamatti, often taking the role of the ""stoner"" or degenerate.  Surprisingly, Paul Rudd shines in this film, also displaying his own impressive charismatic qualities.  He provides brief moments of comedy, and mainly thrives in this mostly serious role as Giamatti's ""partner in crime.""Overall, there's not a whole lot of quality being offered by All is Bright.  It can be considered a theme-driven film, depicting characters that refuse to give in to the poor ""hands"" of life that they've been dealt.  Sadly, there are very few points during this film at feature memorable exchanges or scenes that stick out more than others.  This is a slow-progressing film with a predictable climax and uneventful conclusion.  Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd both do their best to maintain viewing interest, but even their chemistry struggles due to uninteresting writing and lackluster direction.  The tell-tale sign that this film lags from beginning to end is the fact that it's a straight-to-video production, not to mention it's a holiday film that wasn't even delegated for a holiday-timed release.  Unless you're like me and enjoy the presence of Giamatti and Rudd, you should come to a quick conclusion that this film will serve no other purpose other than to bore you into submission.  Feel free to pass on this flick and seek your holiday amusement in some other fashion.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",2,Giamatti & Rudd shine in lackluster 'All is Bright',1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,4030,"['Phil', 'Morrison', 'Junebug', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Bright', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Dennis', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Rene', 'Dennis', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'four', 'year', 'stint', 'jail', 'only', 'return', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'Therese', 'Amy', 'Landecker', 'now', 'ready', 'marry', 'friend', 'former', 'thief', 'partner', 'Rene', 'Not', 'only', 'Therese', 'moved', 'Dennis', 'friend', 'also', 'told', 'daughter', 'Michi', 'Tatyana', 'Richaud', 'died', 'cancer', 'painfully', 'job', 'Dennis', 'Rene', 'assistance', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'Rene', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'sell', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'Dennis', 'Rene', 'Big', 'Apple', 'where', 'must', 'contend', 'idea', 'lost', 'wife', 'friend', 'attempting', 'resist', 'urge', 'fall', 'back', 'lifestyle', 'thievery', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Coman', 'Domingo', 'Gordon', 'Joseph', 'Weiss', 'also', 'supporting', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'bright', 'film', 'formally', 'called', 'Almost', 'Christmas', 'often', 'featuring', 'damp', 'mood', 'surrounded', 'complete', 'utter', 'uncertainty', 'might', 'be', 'major', 'dose', 'realism', 'flick', 'consequences', 'man', 'life', 'doing', 'hard', 'time', 'jail', 'not', 'typical', 'mood', 'average', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'lover', 'holidays', 'Ultimately', 'seasonal', 'film', 'suffers', 'massive', 'lack', 'direction', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'struggles', 'find', 'driving', 'point', ""n't"", 'story', 'redemption', 'righting', 'past', 'misdoings', 'strictly', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'cope', 'outcome', 'previous', 'choices', 'life', 'are', 'ghosts', 'Christmas', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'particular', 'story', 'damage', 'been', 'done', 'basically', 'doomsday', 'scenario', 'Paul', 'Giamotti', 'character', 'Dennis', 'forced', 'wonder', 'wallow', 'current', 'predicament', 'job', 'family', 'untrustworthy', 'friend.One', 'few', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'even', 'bothered', 'give', 'film', 'attention', 'solely', 'based', 'appreciation', 'contributions', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'film', 'industry', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'possibly', 'say', 'previous', 'impressive', 'roles', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'already', 'actor', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'poor', 'performance', 'regardless', 'writing', 'storytelling', 'doubt', 'Giamatti', 'conversation', 'elite', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'individuals', 'business', 'co-star', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'different', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'negative', 'context', 'just', 'so', 'taken', 'different', 'career', 'path', 'Giamatti', 'often', 'taking', 'role', 'stoner', 'degenerate', 'Surprisingly', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'shines', 'film', 'also', 'displaying', 'own', 'impressive', 'charismatic', 'qualities', 'brief', 'moments', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'thrives', 'mostly', 'serious', 'role', 'Giamatti', 'partner', 'crime', 'Overall', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'quality', 'being', 'offered', 'Bright', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'theme-driven', 'film', 'depicting', 'characters', 'refuse', 'give', 'poor', 'hands', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'Sadly', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'points', 'film', 'feature', 'memorable', 'exchanges', 'scenes', 'stick', 'out', 'more', 'others', 'slow-progressing', 'film', 'predictable', 'climax', 'uneventful', 'conclusion', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'do', 'best', 'maintain', 'viewing', 'interest', 'even', 'chemistry', 'struggles', 'due', 'uninteresting', 'writing', 'lackluster', 'direction', 'tell-tale', 'sign', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'fact', 'straight-to-video', 'production', 'not', 'mention', 'holiday', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'delegated', 'holiday-timed', 'release', ""'re"", 'enjoy', 'presence', 'Giamatti', 'Rudd', 'should', 'come', 'quick', 'conclusion', 'film', 'will', 'serve', 'other', 'purpose', 'other', 'bore', 'submission', 'Feel', 'free', 'pass', 'flick', 'seek', 'holiday', 'amusement', 'other', 'fashion.GRADE', 'D+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

Not a cookie cutter, simple minded trip through the Yuletide experience, a bit of cold reality, some unsavory characters attempt to get their act together by scoring big with Christmas tree sales in December.  A bit of their own medicine leaves them completely broke setting up the unusual ending as they try to at least make Christmas joy and magic for a sweet little child.Paul Giamatti (Dennis) is one Bassett Hound faced, dissatisfied mutt throughout the entire story and Rudd (Rene) is not an ideal partner as he tries to steal Giamatti's character's family away.  One character, Olga, is likable and probably the only redeeming body in the whole story other than the little girl.  She helps Dennis make his first sale (to her) and then invites him in for food and a much needed bath.This feature had one quality that I adore in movie making.  It is unique.  Not many, if any viewers will say that this one reminds them of any other film.  That's a virtue.  And it entertains from beginning to end.  Just don't go in thinking that this is your typical feel good Christmas story with a lollipop ending.  That's just not what this movie is.The theme song ""JOY"" is ear candy..
