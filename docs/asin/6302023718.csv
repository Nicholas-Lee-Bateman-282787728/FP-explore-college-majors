291119,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302023718,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the reviewPerhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights.  Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.""The Rose Tattoo"" is a little different look at the dysfunctional family. Although the geography of the play is still the American South this play is not peopled with Williams' usually WASPy characters but rather a little conclave of immigrant Italians who have somehow made a beachhead in the Gulf Coast area. The central character is a previously abandoned but now widowed Italian seamstress trying to survive, mainly through her hopes for her daughter, on her wits, her memories of youth, her integrity and her fierce instinct to survive in alien territory. A philandering husband, the obsessive subject of her adoration, a daughter trying to learn to fly on her own in the love game, and an incidental encounter with a fellow, younger Italian truck driver come together to give her the sign she needs to start over. Maybe. This play, more than most of Williams' efforts, depends on the strength of the dialogue and not the plotline. That is what gives its dramatic edge as Williams explores yet another tangled up dream gone awry story.In the movie version, the role of the young Italian truck driver as played by Burt Lancaster and the seamstress as played by the fabulous Anna Magnani is more central to the unfolding story from the beginning. The dramatic tensions between this pair and the `waiting for a sign' by the seamstress are still fairly similar. It is however Lancaster's enhanced role that really makes this a visual treat and gives one hope that this new family `aborning' can survive.",5,Waiting For  A Sign,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3227,"['first', 'couple', 'paragraphs', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'introduction', 'other', 'plays', 'written', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'reviewed', 'space', 'review', 'both', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'versions', 'differences', 'noted', 'part', 'reviewPerhaps', 'case', 'reviewer', 'have', 'come', 'works', 'excellent', 'American', 'playwright', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'adaptations', 'plays', 'commercially', 'distributed', 'film', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'more', 'controversial', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'plays', 'had', 'placed', 'time', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'America', 'finest', 'serious', 'playwrights', 'films', 'have', 'own', 'charms', 'want', 'address', 'written', 'plays', 'entry', 'first', 'when', 'appropriate', 'commentary', 'Williams', 'extensive', 'detailed', 'directing', 'instructions', 'said', 'are', 'certain', 'limitations', 'political', 'commentator', 'reviewer', 'works', 'Williams', 'plays', 'least', 'best', 'most', 'well-known', 'ones', 'take', 'place', 'steamy', 'South', 'environs', 'virtually', 'acknowledgement', 'race', 'question', 'dominated', 'Southern', 'life', 'period', 'plays', 'matter', 'was', 'beginning', 'dominate', 'national', 'life', 'Thus', 'possible', 'pay', 'homage', 'work', 'artistic', 'merits', 'am', 'very', 'very', 'tentative', 'giving', 'fulsome', 'praise', 'work', 'political', 'merits', 'proviso', 'Williams', 'nevertheless', 'created', 'very', 'modern', 'stage', 'address', 'social', 'questions', 'personal', 'level', 'homosexuality', 'incest', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'only', 'began', 'get', 'addressed', 'widely', 'well', 'ground-breaking', 'work', 'hit', 'stage', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'little', 'different', 'look', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'geography', 'play', 'still', 'American', 'South', 'play', 'not', 'peopled', 'Williams', 'usually', 'WASPy', 'characters', 'rather', 'little', 'conclave', 'immigrant', 'Italians', 'who', 'have', 'somehow', 'made', 'beachhead', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'area', 'central', 'character', 'previously', 'abandoned', 'now', 'widowed', 'Italian', 'seamstress', 'trying', 'survive', 'mainly', 'hopes', 'daughter', 'wits', 'memories', 'youth', 'integrity', 'fierce', 'instinct', 'survive', 'alien', 'territory', 'philandering', 'husband', 'obsessive', 'subject', 'adoration', 'daughter', 'trying', 'learn', 'fly', 'own', 'love', 'game', 'incidental', 'encounter', 'fellow', 'younger', 'Italian', 'truck', 'driver', 'come', 'together', 'give', 'sign', 'start', 'Maybe', 'play', 'more', 'most', 'Williams', 'efforts', 'strength', 'dialogue', 'not', 'plotline', 'what', 'dramatic', 'edge', 'Williams', 'yet', 'tangled', 'up', 'dream', 'gone', 'awry', 'story.In', 'movie', 'version', 'role', 'young', 'Italian', 'truck', 'driver', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'seamstress', 'played', 'fabulous', 'Anna', 'Magnani', 'more', 'central', 'unfolding', 'story', 'beginning', 'dramatic', 'tensions', 'pair', 'waiting', 'sign', 'seamstress', 'are', 'still', 'fairly', 'similar', 'however', 'Lancaster', 'enhanced', 'role', 'really', 'visual', 'treat', 'one', 'hope', 'new', 'family', 'aborning', 'can', 'survive']",N/A

291122,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6302023718,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[11, 15]","The great Tennessee Williams has given us many, many timeless works.  ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Night Of the Iguana,"" ""Suddenly Last Summer,"" ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""The Glass Menagerie,"" etc.  His plays usually deal with the extremes of the emotional human condition, and ""The Rose Tattoo,"" while not as well known as the above, is no exception; however, due to some problems with casting and direction, it is definitely not timeless.  It's shocking to find that it was nominated for the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for that year.Italian actress Anna Magnani made her English-speaking film debut in the role of Serafina Della Rosa, and she won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.  To be sure, her performance is one that runs the gamut; she opens the film vividly displaying the devotion of a woman who believes her husband hung the moon.  She is equally believable as the seamstress dealing with demanding customers, the wife mourning her husband's untimely death, the recluse who can't face the world without him, the overprotective mother who will barely let her daughter out of her sight, the furious Sicilian widow seeking revenge on the woman who soiled her marriage in adultery, and as the joyous middle-aged lady who is ready to live again.  Few roles have as much range as this one, and Signora Magnani handles every nuance beautifully.Obviously I have other problems with the film, which is directed in an often quite pedestrian manner, with characters wrongly out of focus and shots framed with a stationary camera so that the actors have to walk into the static shot.  The story often shoots off in so many directions at the same time that one cannot follow the narrative, simply because the narrative is badly confused and in terrible need of being tightened up.  ""The Rose Tattoo"" won another Oscar for Best B&W; Cinematography, which mainly tells me that there must have been few B&W; films released in 1955.But worst of all is Burt Lancaster, horribly miscast as a Sicilian immigrant.  He doesn't look the part, sound the part, or act the part.  He is comic relief, played most broadly, and his attempts to steal the scenes are most unwelcome.  Bouncing off the walls in his undershirt, laughing so loudly and with such physical overplay that one could mistake him for a schizophrenic, Lancaster's performance is ridiculous and distracting in the extreme.  I love his work in films like ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"" and, much later, in ""Local Hero,"" but this is just plain ugly.  I think the intent was to lighten up the oppressive tone set by Serafina's extreme mourning, but the film would have been helped immensely by using someone with a lighter touch...and perhaps someone who vaguely resembles a Sicilian.",3,Wildly uneven but oddly intriguing,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2723,"['great', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'given', 'many', 'many', 'timeless', 'works', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Night', 'Iguana', 'Suddenly', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Glass', 'Menagerie', 'etc', 'plays', 'usually', 'deal', 'extremes', 'emotional', 'human', 'condition', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'above', 'exception', 'however', 'due', 'problems', 'casting', 'direction', 'definitely', 'not', 'timeless', 'shocking', 'find', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'year.Italian', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Magnani', 'made', 'English-speaking', 'film', 'debut', 'role', 'Serafina', 'Della', 'Rosa', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'work', 'be', 'sure', 'performance', 'one', 'gamut', 'film', 'vividly', 'displaying', 'devotion', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'hung', 'moon', 'equally', 'believable', 'seamstress', 'dealing', 'demanding', 'customers', 'wife', 'mourning', 'husband', 'untimely', 'death', 'recluse', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'face', 'world', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'barely', 'let', 'daughter', 'sight', 'furious', 'Sicilian', 'widow', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'woman', 'who', 'soiled', 'marriage', 'adultery', 'joyous', 'middle-aged', 'lady', 'who', 'ready', 'live', 'again', 'Few', 'roles', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'range', 'one', 'Signora', 'Magnani', 'nuance', 'beautifully.Obviously', 'have', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'directed', 'often', 'quite', 'pedestrian', 'manner', 'characters', 'wrongly', 'focus', 'shots', 'framed', 'stationary', 'camera', 'actors', 'have', 'walk', 'static', 'shot', 'story', 'often', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'directions', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'narrative', 'simply', 'narrative', 'badly', 'confused', 'terrible', 'need', 'being', 'tightened', 'up', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'B', 'W', 'Cinematography', 'mainly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'B', 'W', 'films', 'released', '1955.But', 'worst', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'Sicilian', 'immigrant', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'sound', 'part', 'act', 'part', 'comic', 'relief', 'played', 'most', 'broadly', 'attempts', 'steal', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'unwelcome', 'Bouncing', 'off', 'walls', 'undershirt', 'laughing', 'so', 'loudly', 'such', 'physical', 'overplay', 'one', 'could', 'mistake', 'schizophrenic', 'Lancaster', 'performance', 'ridiculous', 'distracting', 'extreme', 'love', 'work', 'films', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'much', 'later', 'Local', 'Hero', 'just', 'plain', 'ugly', 'think', 'intent', 'was', 'lighten', 'up', 'oppressive', 'tone', 'set', 'Serafina', 'extreme', 'mourning', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helped', 'immensely', 'using', 'someone', 'lighter', 'touch', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'vaguely', 'Sicilian']",N/A
291123,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6302023718,Char,"[0, 0]","This amazing story focusing upon the motif of a Rose tattoo takes place in a mid-20th-century American community of Sicilian immigrants.  The community's livelihood centers around a fruit-growing industry.  The set features palm and banana trees, and modest, frame houses with shutters.  A note of interest:  The main action of the story takes place in a house that was apparently Tennessee Williams' house in Key West.  The ""historical"" setting of the action seems to be somewhere in Southern Louisiana, not far from New Orleans, where a number of Sicilians did actually settle.The main character is a passionate lady, a ""baronessa,"" with the very common Sicilian given-name of Serafina, and the very significant surname (considering the title of the story) of Delle Rose.  She is, in other words, an ""Angel of the Rose."" Several characters in the story have ""Rose"" names, and several characters in the story have Rose tattoos.  Serafina is notably a woman of strict Catholic moral values, with a devotion to the Virgin Mary.  The mother of an attractive teenage daughter, Serafina finds herself pregnant again in middle age.  Passionately in love with a husband that she adores, she's happy about the new son that she is sure will be arriving.  Suddenly, however, Serafina is devastated by monstrous new circumstances:  The death of her husband, the shock of which causes her to lose the baby; the unbearable knowledge of her husband's unfaithfulness to her; and her daughter's growing love for a young man who Serafina fears will violate the girl.The ins and outs of the story moving around the Love/Passion symbol of the Rose, a common symbol also of the Virgin Mother, devolve out of these circumstances.  The central theme of the tale is Passion--the passion of human romantic love--and Serafina, while she fiercely tries to hold onto chaste values outside marriage and insists upon them for her daughter, is an embodiment of this passion.Two love stories are interwoven and fraught with temptations throughout the film.  Serafina places her daughter's love story under the dominance of the Virgin Mary, as shown in the scene where she requires the young suitor to swear before the Virgin's statue that he will not take advantage of the daughter.  Then, when she's alone with the Virgin Mother, Serafina asks her for a sign regarding her own love! Both love stories aim ultimately at the traditional bonds of marriage as the container for their passion.A new love relationship, both welcome and unwelcome, enters Serafina's life with the loud and riotous pianorole strains of ""The Sheik of Araby.""  Burt Lancaster does a fairly good job of making believable the extraordinary sort of fellow he plays.  This character, whose surname in translation means ""Eat a Horse,"" is so lowborn he seems to have sprung accidentally from a rock!  Uninhibited and impetuous, he is, a ""wild gypsy of a man.""  Nevertheless, he is very capable of compassion and gentleness.  He's a direct, upfront, clown of a lover, dancing around his lady, bouncing carefree between earth and sky, where, waving his arms like a bird from a perch upon a cross-shaped boat's mast, he sings over and over, ""I'm a happy fellow!""I didn't ""see"" it at first, but Anna Magnani's acting is precious.  She has created a real jewel of a character in Serafina.  What a beautiful lady.Despite the picture's having won three Academy Awards, my impression has been that ""The Rose Tattoo"" was one of Tennessee Williams' less popular works.  I admit that I viewed the movie twice before I got to like it.  My advice to viewers, therefore, would be to watch the movie several times before making the mistake of writing it off.  In sum, in the end, the movie is a merry comedy of happy resolution.I think if descendants of some of America's Sicilian immigrants had realized that this movie was very much a mirror of their culture and identity as early Sicilian immigrants, there'd have been an eagerness on their part to see and enjoy the movie.  Perhaps there was, and I didn't know about it.",5,"Rose Tattoo, Sicilian Mirror",1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,4047,"['amazing', 'story', 'focusing', 'motif', 'Rose', 'tattoo', 'place', 'mid-20th-century', 'American', 'community', 'Sicilian', 'immigrants', 'community', 'livelihood', 'centers', 'fruit-growing', 'industry', 'set', 'palm', 'banana', 'trees', 'modest', 'frame', 'houses', 'shutters', 'note', 'interest', 'main', 'action', 'story', 'place', 'house', 'was', 'apparently', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'house', 'Key', 'West', 'historical', 'setting', 'action', 'be', 'somewhere', 'Southern', 'Louisiana', 'not', 'far', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'number', 'Sicilians', 'did', 'actually', 'settle.The', 'main', 'character', 'passionate', 'lady', 'baronessa', 'very', 'common', 'Sicilian', 'given-name', 'Serafina', 'very', 'significant', 'surname', 'considering', 'title', 'story', 'Delle', 'Rose', 'other', 'words', 'Angel', 'Rose', 'Several', 'characters', 'story', 'have', 'Rose', 'names', 'several', 'characters', 'story', 'have', 'Rose', 'tattoos', 'Serafina', 'notably', 'woman', 'strict', 'Catholic', 'moral', 'values', 'devotion', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'mother', 'attractive', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Serafina', 'pregnant', 'again', 'middle', 'age', 'Passionately', 'love', 'husband', 'happy', 'new', 'son', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'arriving', 'Suddenly', 'however', 'Serafina', 'devastated', 'monstrous', 'new', 'circumstances', 'death', 'husband', 'shock', 'lose', 'baby', 'unbearable', 'knowledge', 'husband', 'unfaithfulness', 'daughter', 'growing', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Serafina', 'fears', 'will', 'violate', 'girl.The', 'ins', 'outs', 'story', 'moving', 'Love/Passion', 'symbol', 'Rose', 'common', 'symbol', 'also', 'Virgin', 'Mother', 'circumstances', 'central', 'theme', 'tale', 'Passion', 'passion', 'human', 'romantic', 'love', 'Serafina', 'fiercely', 'hold', 'chaste', 'values', 'outside', 'marriage', 'upon', 'daughter', 'embodiment', 'passion.Two', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'interwoven', 'fraught', 'temptations', 'film', 'Serafina', 'daughter', 'love', 'story', 'dominance', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'shown', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'suitor', 'swear', 'Virgin', 'statue', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'daughter', 'Then', 'when', 'alone', 'Virgin', 'Mother', 'Serafina', 'sign', 'regarding', 'own', 'love', 'stories', 'aim', 'ultimately', 'traditional', 'bonds', 'marriage', 'container', 'passion.A', 'new', 'love', 'relationship', 'welcome', 'unwelcome', 'enters', 'Serafina', 'life', 'loud', 'riotous', 'pianorole', 'strains', 'Sheik', 'Araby', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'believable', 'extraordinary', 'sort', 'fellow', 'character', 'surname', 'translation', 'Eat', 'Horse', 'so', 'lowborn', 'have', 'sprung', 'accidentally', 'rock', 'Uninhibited', 'impetuous', 'wild', 'gypsy', 'man', 'Nevertheless', 'very', 'capable', 'compassion', 'gentleness', 'direct', 'upfront', 'clown', 'lover', 'dancing', 'lady', 'bouncing', 'carefree', 'earth', 'sky', 'where', 'waving', 'arms', 'bird', 'perch', 'cross-shaped', 'boat', 'mast', ""'m"", 'happy', 'fellow', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'first', 'Anna', 'Magnani', 'acting', 'precious', 'created', 'real', 'jewel', 'character', 'Serafina', 'What', 'beautiful', 'lady.Despite', 'picture', 'having', 'won', 'three', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'impression', 'been', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'was', 'one', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'less', 'popular', 'works', 'admit', 'viewed', 'movie', 'twice', 'got', 'My', 'advice', 'viewers', 'therefore', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'making', 'mistake', 'writing', 'off', 'sum', 'end', 'movie', 'merry', 'comedy', 'happy', 'resolution.I', 'think', 'descendants', 'America', 'Sicilian', 'immigrants', 'had', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'mirror', 'culture', 'identity', 'early', 'Sicilian', 'immigrants', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'eagerness', 'part', 'see', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know']",N/A
291124,ACBFF25XJC2T7,6302023718,Choice Critic,"[17, 19]","Burt Lancaster is one of my all-time favorite actors.  But it is painful to watch him in this movie.  His terrible accent jumps between Sicily and the Bronx.  He is ""Elmer Gantry"" without the proper role or dialogue to match his performance or ability.  He is terribly miscast and unconvincing as Alvaro to Anna Magnani's Serafina.It is no coincidence that for a movie that won three Oscars and received an additional five nominations Lancaster received no recogniton whatsoever from the Academy.  He is as convincing an Italian as Donald Trump would be if he tried to act like a modest man.Magnani won the academy award as Best Actress for her performance in a very bad year for movies (1955). In ""The Rose Tattoo"" she merely bounces from one emotional outburst to the next, screaming and yelling in each scene. She brings no nuance or subtlety to the character. Marisa Pavan, who plays her daughter, does. Her character's struggle to find love while dealing with an irrational, raging mother brings out a genuine sweetness in her performance.Magnani's performance with Marlon Brando in ""The Fugitive Kind"" (1959) is far superior to this one. In that movie, as the long suffering wife, she is sublime and sensual. Her character's strong emotional longings are barely concealed beneath the surface until Brando walks into her life and ignites them.Either the writing, direction, or both in ""The Rose Tatoo"" prevent  Magnani from exhibiting the dynamic acting ability displayed in the later movie.

I recently shared this film with a very accomplished actor friend who had never seen it, and his reaction was &quot;wow.&quot; This is one of my all-time favorite films, and I consider Magnani's performance, for which she rightfully won the Academy Award as best actress, to be one of the most beautiful ever filmed. She says more with her eyes then most actors could ever convey in a whole script.Filmed on location in old Key West, it is steeped in the sleepy, humid atmosphere of that wonderful place. Watch for the bar-fight scene, where Magnani walks in to confront her dead husbands mistress. You will spot the mustachioed Tennessee Williams at the bar. His long-time lover, Frank Merlo, to whom he dedicated the book version of this play, &quot;To Frankie, In Return For Sicily&quot;, is also in the fight scene.You can still visit Tennessee's little house in Key West,though it is not on any tour nor open to the public, just ask the locals. You may see the little plaque &quot;the Rose Tattoo&quot;, on the gate.If you haven't seen this film (or even if you have), sit on the floor with a glass of red wine &amp; someone you love, and watch the beautiful Anna Magnani create magic from Tennessee Williams equally magical &quot;love play to the world&quot;, as he called it.",5,Magnifica!,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,1465,"['Anna', 'Magnani', 'perfectly', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'quot', 'Serafina', 'DellaRosa', 'quot', 'love', 'lost', 'heroine', 'beautiful', 'play.Her', 'portrayal', 'completely', 'touching', 'awe-inspiring', 'recently', 'shared', 'film', 'very', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'reaction', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'consider', 'Magnani', 'performance', 'rightfully', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actress', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'filmed', 'more', 'eyes', 'then', 'most', 'actors', 'could', 'ever', 'convey', 'whole', 'script.Filmed', 'location', 'old', 'Key', 'West', 'steeped', 'sleepy', 'humid', 'atmosphere', 'wonderful', 'place', 'Watch', 'bar-fight', 'scene', 'where', 'Magnani', 'confront', 'dead', 'husbands', 'mistress', 'will', 'spot', 'mustachioed', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'bar', 'long-time', 'lover', 'Frank', 'Merlo', 'whom', 'dedicated', 'book', 'version', 'play', 'quot', 'Frankie', 'Return', 'Sicily', 'quot', 'also', 'fight', 'scene.You', 'can', 'still', 'visit', 'Tennessee', 'little', 'house', 'Key', 'West', 'not', 'tour', 'open', 'public', 'just', 'ask', 'locals', 'may', 'see', 'little', 'plaque', 'quot', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'quot', 'gate.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'even', 'have', 'sit', 'floor', 'glass', 'red', 'wine', 'amp', 'someone', 'love', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'Anna', 'Magnani', 'create', 'magic', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'equally', 'magical', 'quot', 'play', 'world', 'quot', 'called']",N/A

Though this film is not THE best adaptation of a Tennessee Williams' play it is a very good and a very different one. It's about a grieving widow(Anna Magnani) who is woed by a boisterous truck driver(Burt Lancaster) who she says looks like her dead husband, only he's more wacky! The highlight of this film is the wonderful performance given by the great italian star Anna Magnani. Evidently she really impressed Hollywood because she was given the Academy Award for best actress for this film, something that rarely happens to a foreign actress and she was the first. The only other foreign actresses to recieve this honor have been Sophia Loren and Simone Signoret and Ingrid Bergman if you count her as a foreigner and many British actresses but i want to get back on subject. The first hour of the film belongs to Magnani and while she does manage to hold our interest it begins to feel a bit boring after one hour. But then finally Burt Lancaster shows up and he manages to lend her great support and their chemistry together is comically romantic.The movie is well done if a bit stagey at times but Anna and Burt help make us forgive that.

The year was 1973 and it was a Saturday Night at the US Merchant Marine Training Center (Lundenberg School of Seamanship) at Piney Point,MD. I was a 19 year old Seaman going through training. A movie was shown on Saturday night in the Rec Hall. This night I was lucky enough to be able to attend the show and view real Hollywood history.""The Rose Tattoo""...what a movie. Being a vintage movie buff even at the young age of 19 I did not know what a great treat that I was in for.My God when that movie started playing I thought I was in Little Italy back in Baltimore City. Burt Lancaster was over the top...but when Sarafina DelleRosa took the stage she was untouchable!!!Her acting and motions were like nothing ever seen on the Silver Screen before. What a performance (note how she goes through the motions and grief when she explains about her husband and the Rose Tattoo on his chest to Lancaster).When her daughter Rosa brings the young Seaman Jack Hunter home and they tell Sarafina that they want to be married she had them kneel down in front of a statue of the Blessed Virgin and pray. At that scene I remember one of the guys shouted out ""Who in the hell orders these damn movies - he should be shot!"". You must remember this was '73 and all those hippies and heads with their mops and faces shaved wearing a USMM uniform were not all happy campers and they found excuses to complain about anything...even a five star vintage movie - enough said.This is a great movie that really holds you to your seat and takes you down an ethnic road into the lives of several old world Italian Gems.This is one movie that will ever be hard to beat. After watching it 35 years ago on that Saturday night in the Rec Hall I was sold for life.In no way does this flick make any fun of the Italian People but project them as a proud and proper group as they really are!""Enjoy"" Joe Kopeck - Parkville,MD by way of the Merchant Marine!!!",5,Man...What a Show !!!,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,1992,"['Let', 'set', 'scene', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1955', 'Masterpiece', 'year', 'was', '1973', 'was', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'US', 'Merchant', 'Marine', 'Training', 'Center', 'Lundenberg', 'School', 'Seamanship', 'Piney', 'Point', 'MD', 'was', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Seaman', 'going', 'training', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Rec', 'Hall', 'night', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'attend', 'show', 'view', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'what', 'movie', 'Being', 'vintage', 'movie', 'buff', 'even', 'young', 'age', '19', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'great', 'treat', 'was', 'for.My', 'God', 'when', 'movie', 'started', 'playing', 'thought', 'was', 'Little', 'Italy', 'back', 'Baltimore', 'City', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'top', 'when', 'Sarafina', 'DelleRosa', 'took', 'stage', 'was', 'untouchable', 'acting', 'motions', 'were', 'nothing', 'ever', 'seen', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'before', 'What', 'performance', 'note', 'how', 'motions', 'grief', 'when', 'husband', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'chest', 'Lancaster', '.When', 'daughter', 'Rosa', 'young', 'Seaman', 'Jack', 'Hunter', 'home', 'tell', 'Sarafina', 'want', 'be', 'married', 'had', 'kneel', 'down', 'front', 'statue', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'pray', 'scene', 'remember', 'one', 'guys', 'shouted', 'Who', 'hell', 'orders', 'damn', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'must', 'remember', 'was', ""'73"", 'hippies', 'heads', 'mops', 'shaved', 'wearing', 'USMM', 'uniform', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'campers', 'found', 'excuses', 'complain', 'anything', 'even', 'five', 'star', 'vintage', 'movie', 'enough', 'said.This', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'seat', 'down', 'ethnic', 'road', 'lives', 'several', 'old', 'world', 'Italian', 'Gems.This', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'hard', 'beat', 'watching', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Rec', 'Hall', 'was', 'sold', 'life.In', 'way', 'flick', 'make', 'fun', 'Italian', 'People', 'project', 'proud', 'proper', 'group', 'really', 'are', 'Enjoy', 'Joe', 'Kopeck', 'Parkville', 'MD', 'way', 'Merchant', 'Marine']",N/A

Half the time it's her real voice, the rest of the time I guess she spoke so harshly test audiences couldn't understand her, probably Marni Nixon took over.  Tennessee Williams wanted to tell the story of how love, once betrayed, can bloom again like a phoennix shot down in flames, if the right man comes along with his hair smelling like roses.  I agree with this so watching this movie was like preaching to the converted.  Magnani is out of this world, though she looks appalled throughout, as though this was her first glimpse of America and she didn't like what she was seeing, and Burt Lancaster, well, he certainly showed none of the finesse of THE LEOPARD in this role.  And yet they say Visconti picked him to be THE LEOPARD based on a hasty screening of this film.  He must have seen something in Alvaro's goofiness and sunniness that he thought might be interesting if completely turned around, like the negative to a photograph.However film fans feast your eyes on the young sailor with whom Marisa Pavan is in love.  ""Jack Hunter"" indeed--notice how Williams inserted the sly sexual pun right in the very heart of his name.  Anyhow, Jack is played by the angelic one and only Ben Cooper--be still my heart!  Cooper played lots of roles in the 1950s, mostly cowboys and renegades, soldiers, this and that, riffraff parts, sort of a sub-Sterling Hayden kind of guy, but young.  Indeed he played ""Turkey"" alongside Sterling Hayden in the unbelievably Freudian Western JOHNNY GUITAR for Nicholas Ray.  Imagine being nicknamed ""Turkey,"" it could only happen in a Nick Ray film.  As Jack Hunter, he wears his heart on his sleeve and is the only actor in the film capable of sharing the screen with Magnani without getting his ass kicked.  He is totally in possession of the role, that of a red blooded American man who promises not to try to have sex with Marisa Pavan on Magnani's say-so.  And yet we still respect him, because he is Ben Cooper.  Cooper makes the most of this plum part, probably his best role until his masterwork as the country bumpkin in CHARTROOSE CABOOSE, the country musical with Molly Bee, Edgar Buchanan and Slim Pickens.  In that film Ben Cooper and Molly Bee make country music as exciting as tango.  He is red hot and The ROSE TATTOO is as good a place as any to make his acquaintance.

291135,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6302023718,magellan,"[8, 24]","Anna Magnani stars as a grieving and overwrought Italian widow in this movie based on the Tennessee Williams play. Magnani is truly great in the role, and she is only 1 of 4 foreign actresses to have ever won an Academy Award for a performance. I do give her credit there, but still, after an hour of almost nothing but her emoting and carrying on about the loss of her husband, it really gets to be almost too much of a good thing. Finally, when I was about to give up on the film, Burt Lancaster comes into the picture and things do pick up from there.It's entertaining to see Lancaster play a goofy, stumbling, truck driver who's as lonely as Magnani and watch his bumbling attempts to bring her out of her shell. Eventually, he succeeds but not after she loses her Sicilian temper at him a couple of times and smacks him around like a nerfball despite the fact that all he did was stumble half-drunk and half-naked into her teenage daughter's bedroom in the middle of the night looking for Magnani and tries to snuggle up to her daughter by mistake in the dark. Oops. Despite this little misadventure and the beating he receives from Magnani, Lancaster is only briefly deterred by this. By sheer dogged persistance he manages to get back in Magnani's good graces by the end of the movie, and everything ends more or less on a happy note. Well, I guess that's Sicilian courtship for you.The movie does have its moments, and I do give Hal Kantor credit for making a valiant attempt to adapt this Tennessee Williams play to the silver screen. But overall, it just doesn't make for a particularly strong movie, and I'm sure it was probably better as a play. It drags too often in places, and some of the scenes are really a little silly or overly melodramatic. Maybe I'm a cultural barbarian, but I thought it was more interesting watching Burt Lancaster playing a bumbling simpleton (which he does well) than Magnani's award-winning performance, which is just too maudlin. Okay, she's lost her husband, but on that account, she gets abusive or at least hyper-neurotic with her friends, her priest, her daughter, her daughter's boyfriend, and just about everybody else in her life, not to mention Lancaster, who really does seem to care for her, and who comes off as a basically decent, well-meaning, and fun-loving guy even though he is pretty goofy and wacked-out himself. And as I said, it's sort of entertaining watching Lancaster, who usually portrays more studly, leading-man roles, playing an inept, lonely, Sicilian banana-truck driver who spends much of his time stumbling half-drunk through people's backyards and bedrooms and getting their dogs (or Magnani herself) sicced on him. (I guess all those bananas aren't much comfort on those balmy and moonlit Florida nights). But I preferred his character to the high-strung, overwrought Magnani, who's wrapped tighter than a pig in a blanket.The movie was filmed in old Florida Keys, so I give it points for overall ambience, but all in all I can't give it more than 2 or 3 stars--unless the move counts as a primer on Sicilian dating and courtship rituals.",3,Okay,1027900800,"07 29, 2002",2002,3115,"['Anna', 'Magnani', 'grieving', 'overwrought', 'Italian', 'widow', 'movie', 'based', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'Magnani', 'truly', 'great', 'role', 'only', '1', '4', 'foreign', 'actresses', 'have', 'ever', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'there', 'still', 'hour', 'almost', 'nothing', 'emoting', 'carrying', 'loss', 'husband', 'really', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'Finally', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'give', 'up', 'film', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'picture', 'things', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'there.It', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Lancaster', 'play', 'goofy', 'stumbling', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'as', 'lonely', 'Magnani', 'watch', 'bumbling', 'attempts', 'bring', 'shell', 'Eventually', 'not', 'Sicilian', 'temper', 'couple', 'times', 'smacks', 'around', 'nerfball', 'fact', 'did', 'was', 'stumble', 'half-drunk', 'half-naked', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'bedroom', 'middle', 'night', 'looking', 'Magnani', 'tries', 'snuggle', 'up', 'daughter', 'mistake', 'dark', 'Oops', 'little', 'misadventure', 'beating', 'Magnani', 'Lancaster', 'only', 'briefly', 'deterred', 'sheer', 'dogged', 'persistance', 'get', 'back', 'Magnani', 'good', 'graces', 'end', 'movie', 'everything', 'more', 'less', 'happy', 'note', 'Well', 'guess', 'Sicilian', 'courtship', 'you.The', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'do', 'give', 'Hal', 'Kantor', 'credit', 'making', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'adapt', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'silver', 'screen', 'overall', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'particularly', 'strong', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'play', 'too', 'often', 'places', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'little', 'silly', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'cultural', 'barbarian', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'watching', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'playing', 'bumbling', 'simpleton', 'well', 'Magnani', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'just', 'too', 'maudlin', 'Okay', 'lost', 'husband', 'account', 'abusive', 'least', 'hyper-neurotic', 'friends', 'priest', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'life', 'not', 'mention', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'who', 'off', 'basically', 'decent', 'well-meaning', 'fun-loving', 'guy', 'even', 'pretty', 'goofy', 'wacked-out', 'said', 'sort', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'usually', 'more', 'studly', 'leading-man', 'roles', 'playing', 'inept', 'lonely', 'Sicilian', 'banana-truck', 'driver', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'stumbling', 'half-drunk', 'people', 'backyards', 'bedrooms', 'getting', 'dogs', 'Magnani', 'sicced', 'guess', 'bananas', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'comfort', 'balmy', 'moonlit', 'Florida', 'nights', 'preferred', 'character', 'high-strung', 'overwrought', 'Magnani', 'who', 'wrapped', 'tighter', 'pig', 'blanket.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'old', 'Florida', 'Keys', 'give', 'overall', 'ambience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '2', '3', 'stars', 'move', 'primer', 'Sicilian', 'dating', 'courtship', 'rituals']",N/A

Anna Magnani is nothing short of magnificent, and while Lancaster does get a hair hammy in spots, his character is so buffoonish and likeable, he ends up being almost as endearing as Serafina.The best way to enjoy it to the fullest?

She is courted by the village clown (Burt Lancaster) who tries to help her let go of her memories. The rose tattoo is significant because the deceased had one on his body.Magnani is superb as the grieving Serafina Delle Rose. Lancaster manages to pull off his role as Alvaro Mongiacavallo mainly because of his enormous energy. However, it is difficult for me to take his impersonation of an idiosyncratic Italian American seriously.The movie won Academy Awards in 1955 for Best Actress (Anna Magnani), Black and White Cinematography and Black and White Art Direction. Nominations were received for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Marisa Pavan), Black and White Costume Design and Editing and Scoring of a Dramatic Picture. The Oscar for Best Picture in that same year was given to MARTY.THE ROSE TATTOO was adapted for the screen from a play by Tennessee Williams who served as the screenwriter for the film.

Her performance in THE FUGITIVE KIND was powerful, and her unconventional non-Hollywood look really appealed to me.  I chose THE ROSE TATTOO, based on several good reviews I had read and also because I have enjoyed so many of Burt Lancaster's performances.  However, I found this movie to be very disappointing.In THE FUGITIVE KIND, Anna Magnani is damaged, mourning the loss of a father and a lover many years prior.  With her racist husband, she displays a calm resignation, under which is an undeniable dread.  With Brando she exudes a quiet, simmering passion that is astounding to watch.  What's missing in THE ROSE TATTOO are the quiet moments where you see characters transform before your eyes.  In THE ROSE TATTOO, Magnani just screams and screams.  There is little insight into her inner agony. Instead, she breaks things or slams doors.Lancaster's performance is also bad.  He is not convincing as an Italian, nor is he convincing as the ""fool"" who tries to steal Magnani's heart.I wanted to like this movie.  Not only are two of the actors my favorites, but I also love Tennessee Williams's plays and screenplays.
