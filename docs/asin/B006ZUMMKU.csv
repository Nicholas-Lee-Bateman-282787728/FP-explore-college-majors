He, on the other hand, has the human wisdom necessary to help some of the kids -- and he is punished by the bureaucracy, in part for the good he does.Second, in a very complete way,  the film shows the ""good"" side of bureaucracy as well:  Bashir the teacher is squished by the school rules, but he obtains refugee status in Canada thanks to other government procedures that, in the end,  operate with justice.Third, the North American French-speaking kids, bright and likeable as they may be, are less ""French"" in their culture than their North African, Algerian, ""foreign,"" arabophone teacher.

1523763,A167K0YA96FD56,B006ZUMMKU,Ian Gordon Malcomson,"[3, 3]","I have never been so thoroughly engaged in watching a movie as this one. Bravo to this Quebec filmmaker Philip Falardeau for touching the heart of a retired teacher in a very special way. This film has a number of things going for it: one, it effectively addresses a package of interconnecting issues within the framework of a very believable story; two, the acting is terrific in that it plays to the emotional tempo of the plot - no overacting or histrionics here; three, its open-ended conclusion speaks to a realism not found in many North American films these days; and, four, the film is very down-to-earth in how it handles the many challenges facing administrators, teachers, parents, janitors, and most importantly students in a school year hit hard by tragedy. On the first count, there is plenty to mull over in terms of understanding some of life's big questions: how and why children grieve; how does the public perceive teachers; how are immigrants received in a very closed society like Quebec; how do children relate to children during a sudden crisis; and how people cope with the loss of a loved one. Within this context, all the acting is appropriately focused on trying to clarify and resolve the problems that emerge when people sometimes feel alienated, are misunderstood, are lied to, become uncertain of the future, or are just plain overwhelmed by a personal loss. As the movie finishes, the audience is left with an incomplete feeling that though people can come together to achieve a better understanding of each other's needs, the problems never really go away; we just learn how to handle them better and move on with our lives. To that end, Bachir Lazhar has to be one of those winsome characters who because of personal adversities is able to act compassionately when dealing with others in similar straits. While there is copious amounts of pain here, there is more than enough real love to offset it. Be prepared for a couple of well-timed surprises as you become absorbed in this most poignant of human tragedies.

Due to the suicide of a teacher in a primary school in Montreal, M. Lazhar manages to secure a job as an emergency replacement.  He tells the principal that he has many years of experience teaching in Algeria and that he is now a Canadian citizen, neither of which is true.  As we learn more of his background we find out that his wife and daughter were killed in a fire in their apartment building that he believes was set deliberately by his enemines. He is trying desperately to secure permanent status in Canada while he is trying equallly desperately to adjust to the task of teaching in this somewhat progessive school where the kids sit in a semicircle and speak back to the teacher.  He remedies that by changing the seats to straight lines, insisting on discipline, even to the point of cuffing a boy on the head when he speaks up.He doesn't sleep much as night, we see him in conference with his lawyer and doing his laundry alone in his small, spare apartment.  His deeply lined face betrays the deep grief that he is hiding in his soul.  Echoing that grief is that of the children who adored their last teacher and who have not come to terms with their feelings.  Two children, especially, the ones who saw the teacher hanging from the pipe in the schoolroom, are the most traumatized.  We see him making adjustments from the teaching methods that he undoubtably grew up with, a dictation from Balzac.  He watches a lively warm young drama teacher whose room is filled with color.  She takes an interest in him, has him over for dinner, gives him an African violet plant.The cast is first rate, starring Mohammed Fellag, as Bashir Lazhar.  ""Bashir"" means ""bringer of good news"" he tells the class.  And he does, in the midst of his own grief and ackwardness, manage to bring goodness and healing to the children.  Besides Fellag, the two actors who play the most troubled children give extraordinary performances.  Emilion Neron brought tears and chills to me in his major scene.The story opens in the midst of winter in Montreal, with snow piled high and ends at the spring thaw.  There is an ongoing theme of a chrysalis waiting for its time to open up running through the story.  There is warmth, goodness and humor in the film as well as sorrow, frustration and injustice.  It's all calibrated just right.  Without succombing to banal sentimentalism we see deep feeling.  I highly recomment this film.

1523783,A28TSZUILM00N4,B006ZUMMKU,schumann_bg,"[1, 3]","Monsieur Lazhar is certainly a worthy film, but in the end it is a typical product of modern ""thought-provoking"" cinema i.e. it ticks off a number of boxes and covers issues of migration, extremism, personal tragedy, education, suicide, and hysteria around paedophilia while never quite coalescing into a cinematic vision of life. The whole thing remains a bit superficial and dry, as if the filmmaker were trying to make a film that could be discussed by sixth-formers. It seems to me a shortcoming that a man who has lost everything in quite such a terrible way as Monsieur Lazhar should not really be shown in terms of how he feels confronting a new world in these circumstances - we hardly see him out of the classroom at all, except for a few exchanges with colleagues which are also superficial and added in the service of advancing one or other of the arguments. You may say that his isolation is the key, but we get no sense really of his state of mind - he's as two-dimensional as Mr Benn.To the extent that the focus is on the pupils, it also seems too distant from how they are, and somehow too politicised. This is because the film has a lot to get through. To put it like this does underplay the sensitivity of the direction, perhaps, but it doesn't quite add up to a portrait of childhood like Les 400 Coups or Au Revoir Les Enfants. There's so much less life in it. It seems to me that we need to get back to filmmaking of vision rather than point-making - in other words, a view of film as art rather than a tract, more or less. If you are told the story of Monsieur Lazhar, there is really no need to see the film, the visual interest is so minimal, and there is so little of aesthetic value. To some extent the film issues a challenge to authority and obsessive box-ticking, in the form of Monsieur Lazhar himself who is an excellent teacher who would not be allowed to teach in the system. He also plays a much more useful role than the psychologist who is brought in to deal with the children, even if his actions have such consequences for himself and others. This certainly seems to ring true. But in other ways the film is a product of that same soulless society where we can only deal with things by making an issue out of them and putting them into a box. Only in the last few minutes does it start to work cinematically, in my view, and even then it is based in large part on something written. (This, and one other key scene involving the boy we see in the first scene are actually very moving.) After watching it I turned to Rohmer's La Femme de l'aviateur, and the difference was so palpable - Rohmer takes the everyday and the banal and reveals it to be something else, and something wonderful happens.

Though the acting is generally excellent -- This movie features exceptional performances by the child actors who seem to be wise beyond their years.  The lead role of Bachir Lazhar (Mohamed Sad Fellag) appears to be almost nave in his approach to his new life in Montreal as a teacher.  But one soon discovers that he is merely wearing a mask.  Considering what he has been through, Monsieur Lazhar becomes an exemplary replacement for his predecessor.  He ends up being somewhat more outspoken than is ideal for a person in his (tentative) position.  Yet his sincerity ultimately helps him to win over his students as he helps them to cope with their trauma.  The understated approach of the director (Philippe Falardeau) works well in this context.  The d&eacute;nouement of the film in particular elucidates what can happen to an individualistic professional within the bureaucracy of the North American public education system.  This movie also says much about the perception of an unexplainable / mysterious death -- As seen from a child's point of view.

1523787,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B006ZUMMKU,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[6, 6]","""Monsieur Lazhar"" is a highly acclaimed Canadian French-language film set in contemporary Montr&eacute;al, written and directed by Philippe Falardeau, adapted from Evelyne de la Cheneliere's original stage play.  It is one of those gentle films that delivers a powerful punch, with everything beautifully understated throughout, with its events firmly rooted in reality. The acting is everywhere superb and delightfully natural, with some of the most powerful performances delivered by the children around whose lives the film really revolves.  The theme of unexplained and seemingly meaningless death, the working out of grief and of guilt for the survivors is explored at many levels in subtle and sensitive ways and with no small amount of (appropriate) humour and pathos. The film also serves as something of a commentary on our times, and the paradoxically dehumanising consequences of overly rigid legislation driven by fear of litigation and in the name of human rights.While by no means delivering very much by way of a feel good factor (and especially eschewing the altogether too obvious happy ending) the film nevertheless comes across as uplifting and enormously satisfying.

One of the boys Simon, discovers the body and raises the alarm. With the ensuing scandal it becomes nigh on impossible to get a replacement teacher and the kids are clearly traumatised by the whole experience.Enter Monsieur Lazhar (Mohammed Fellag) he is from Algeria where he claims he was a teacher and he would like to step in and help. So faced with a decision of no teacher or a very keen one indeed, he gets the gig. The thing is that he is a man with a past and a tragic one too. Algeria has suffered years of terror and he and his family are one of its victims. He is also an asylum seeker and could face deportation at any time as his case is pending. This side of his life he keeps from everybody. He throws himself into connecting with the children and in doing so manages to unravel the truth of the past and the hostilities that the children have been harbouring amongst themselves.This was an utterly absorbing film with performances from all involved that were brilliant. Emilien Neron who plays Simon is excellent but the real star is Mohammed Fellag who brings a warmth and humanity that is as touching as it is revealing about the human condition and possibly cultural attitudes.This was taken from the play by Evelyne de la Cheneliere but has transferred to the screen with no hitches, there is a bit of love interest, no bedroom naughtiness and no real action. Yet this just shines through as a testament to great film making.

Though he has experience of teaching in Algeria for nineteen years, Monsieur Lazhar, now in Montreal, finds it a little difficult to adapt to the school's system. But what torments Monsieur Lazhar more than anything is his painful past that still haunts him.Though the story involves some serious themes, ""Monsieur Lazhar"" is nothing dismal or depressing. Mohamed Sad Fellag (credited as Fellag) turns in a fine performance, bringing dignity and low-key humor to the role of Monsieur Lazhar, who, despite several missteps - dictating Balzac is too much for elementary school students - helps the shocked young students face reality and move on in their life. No wonder Monsieur Lazhar is loved and respected by the children.Some part of the motives of characters, or the causes of incidents, is left to our imagination. Why did Monsieur Lazhar have to leave Algeria? Why did his predecessor commit suicide? Why did the class's student Alice suddenly become hostile to another student Simon? Knowing the characters and their past is part of the strength of the film, where the story unravels like a first-rate mystery.The Canadian film is also about the modern educational system seen from an outsider's point of view. None of the characters, adults and children alike, is ""bad."" Teachers and the school's principal are all decent people. Still, the film suggests there is something not quite right about what is going on in school. It is not an indictment, but a suggestion or analysis, which is all the more effective in making us think.The Oscar-nominated film in 2012 (for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to ""A Separation"") is based on a play by &Eacute;velyne de la Cheneli&egrave;re (who appears in the film as Alice's mother).
