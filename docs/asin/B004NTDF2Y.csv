I thought the acting was very good and the location filming was outstanding.  The sets, the props and the wardrobes were perfect for the time they portrayed.  The Wyatt Earp movie is okay, Tombstone is better as we all know.  But I like western movies and I will watch it from time to time.",5,good entertainment,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,399,"['Jesse', 'James', 'movie', 'best', 'two', 'Very', 'underrated', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'location', 'filming', 'was', 'outstanding', 'sets', 'props', 'wardrobes', 'were', 'perfect', 'time', 'portrayed', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'movie', 'okay', 'Tombstone', 'better', 'know', 'like', 'western', 'movies', 'will', 'watch', 'time', 'time']",Wyatt Earp / The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford

1422488,A1ESUYMIG3TZT0,B004NTDF2Y,Bobby  W.,"[8, 9]","I bought this set primarily for the 'Jesse James' movie, which is dark, slow paced and cerebral, and features fine acting by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. This film may bore you if you are looking for action or plot twists, and you'll know if  it's right for you after about the first 15 or so minutes. If you can stick with it, Casey Affleck's smoldering performance is a revelation.I had not seen ""Wyatt Earp"" before and it proved to be quite a pleasant surprise. It came out a year after ""Tombstone"" and wasn't as successful I guess, but this film strikes a good balance between being too violent or too fawning/watered down.  It pretty much follows the same main storyline as ""Tombstone"" with the addition of showing events that mold the younger Wyatt into the man he becomes  by the time he arrives at Tombstone.Dennis Quaid does a good job with the Doc Holliday role, but Val Kilmer's performance will always be more memorable.The movie clocks in at a bit over three hours, however it never dragged for me.The cinematography in ""Wyatt Earp"" is beautiful, and the Blu-ray transfer is excellent - there are many dark/shadowy scenes that are rich in detail and have very little or no noise.  The frequent daytime panoramas are gorgeous. Warner did a wonderful job here.If you want to add two very different,  good westerns to your Blue-ray collection, this combo set is a steal.",5,"Two very different,  good westerns at a bargain price",1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1380,"['bought', 'set', 'primarily', ""'Jesse"", 'James', 'movie', 'dark', 'slow', 'paced', 'cerebral', 'features', 'fine', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'film', 'may', 'bore', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'plot', 'twists', ""'ll"", 'know', 'right', 'first', '15', 'so', 'minutes', 'can', 'stick', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'smoldering', 'performance', 'revelation.I', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'proved', 'be', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Tombstone', 'was', ""n't"", 'successful', 'guess', 'film', 'good', 'balance', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'too', 'fawning/watered', 'down', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'main', 'storyline', 'Tombstone', 'addition', 'showing', 'events', 'mold', 'younger', 'Wyatt', 'man', 'time', 'Tombstone.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'good', 'job', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'role', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'more', 'memorable.The', 'movie', 'clocks', 'bit', 'three', 'hours', 'however', 'never', 'dragged', 'me.The', 'cinematography', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'beautiful', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'are', 'many', 'dark/shadowy', 'scenes', 'are', 'rich', 'detail', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'noise', 'frequent', 'daytime', 'panoramas', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Warner', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'here.If', 'want', 'add', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'good', 'westerns', 'Blue-ray', 'collection', 'combo', 'set', 'steal']",Wyatt Earp / The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
