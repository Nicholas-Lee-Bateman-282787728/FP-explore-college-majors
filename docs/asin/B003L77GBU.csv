Damon is one of the better guest stars who has been on 30 Rock.  I am enjoying him as much as Liz's boyfriend as I did Jon Hamm as the inept doctor.  But it is Baldwin as Jack who outdoes the rest of the cast as usual in this episode.  There is one must-see scene where he goes into feigned seduction mode over the gay interior decorator so that he can get his choice in redecorating. This might as well be an older Baldwin doing a satire of his younger self.

Bullions,"[18, 22]","I've followed 30 Rock for its five years, and I've pretty much loved every show they've ever done, because it's always been ridiculous and funny, and enjoyable. Season 4 lacked a certain something, maybe it wasn't as funny as it usually is, maybe it wasn't as over the top as usual, both of these things were true.However, season five brings in enough standalone episodes to make the season memorable. Season five included the live show, which went extremely well, and I hope they decide to do another live show next season. It felt like you were watching a sketch on Saturday Night Live, which Tina Fey worked on for nine years. It was a huge success, in my opinion.Also, the 100th episode, ""Double-Edged Sword"", ""Queen of Jordan"", ""TGS Hates Women"", and ""Regeaning"" were the best shows of the season. They each incorporated new and bold ideas, such as ""Queen of Jordan"" acting as a pilot of a reality show given to Tracy's character's wife. This episode is simply making fun of the ridiculousness attached to reality programming, but it also serves as one of 30 Rock's best shows.I can't wait to buy this season.

Barnes,"[7, 10]","I'm fairly sure that if you're reading this, you've already seen some of the earlier seasons, so I won't discuss plot-- just the relative merits of Season 5.While30 Rock: Season Fourwas somewhat lacking, the fifth was excellent; in fact, it was nearly as good as the show in its prime. This resurgence could be attributed to several factors- a lessened focus on Kenneth, for one- but the main difference between 4 and 5 is that Season 5 was funny. Really funny, as only 30 Rock can be-- but the show did feel different than Seasons 1-3. Perhaps it was more of a focus on cramming as many jokes in as possible (not necessarily a bad thing, mind), but the show is slightly down from the giddy heights of ""Sandwich Day"" and ""Episode 210"".That being said, it's still one of the six best comedies on television and definitely worth your time/money. Episodes such as ""Reaganing"", ""Queen of Jordan"", ""Christmas Attack Zone"", ""When It Rains, It Pours"" and the 100th episode spectacular ""100"" all proved that while the show was different than the 'glory days', it's still an exuberant and manic free-for-all of a sitcom bursting at the seams with hilarity.Grade: 4.75/5",5,A Return to Form,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,1160,"[""'m"", 'fairly', 'sure', ""'re"", 'reading', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'plot', 'just', 'relative', 'merits', 'Season', '5.While30', 'Rock', 'Season', 'Fourwas', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'fifth', 'was', 'excellent', 'fact', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'show', 'prime', 'resurgence', 'could', 'be', 'attributed', 'several', 'factors-', 'lessened', 'focus', 'Kenneth', 'one-', 'main', 'difference', '4', '5', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'funny', 'Really', 'funny', 'only', '30', 'Rock', 'can', 'be', 'show', 'did', 'feel', 'different', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'more', 'focus', 'cramming', 'many', 'jokes', 'possible', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'mind', 'show', 'slightly', 'down', 'giddy', 'heights', 'Sandwich', 'Day', 'Episode', '210', '.That', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'one', 'six', 'best', 'comedies', 'television', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time/money', 'Episodes', 'such', 'Reaganing', 'Queen', 'Jordan', 'Christmas', 'Attack', 'Zone', 'When', 'Pours', '100th', 'episode', 'spectacular', '100', 'proved', 'show', 'was', 'different', ""'glory"", 'days', 'still', 'exuberant', 'manic', 'free-for-all', 'sitcom', 'bursting', 'seams', 'hilarity.Grade', '4.75/5']",30 Rock: Season 5
