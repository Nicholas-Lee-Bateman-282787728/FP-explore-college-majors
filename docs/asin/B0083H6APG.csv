And we appreciate the measured pace of how he scans a scene, slowly chewing his gum. Notice his gray hairs, Capt. Healy's haggard face; even Reggie is showing the passage of time. Pace will not be any faster than previous.After the opening scene, all of us ask: why?? Repeated several times is the phrase: ""A cop deserves the benefit of the doubt"". Watch for the funny exchange with Hasty Hathaway regarding the whereabouts of Rose Gammon. It echoes the old 'Who's on first' schtick. But seriously, Jesse cannot find her or get anyone to staff the department. The town council has not encouraged personnel loyalty. So, aside from rebuilding the department, and catching a bomber, everything is great.Prime suspect: Gino Fish.Two things changed: talking to Jen, his ex-wife, and Councilman Hanson needs Jesse's help.",5,Series Achieves Critical Mass,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,892,"['already', 'mentioned', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'fans', 'mystery', 'more', 'last', 'appreciate', 'measured', 'pace', 'how', 'scene', 'slowly', 'chewing', 'gum', 'Notice', 'gray', 'hairs', 'Capt', 'Healy', 'haggard', 'face', 'even', 'Reggie', 'showing', 'passage', 'time', 'Pace', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'faster', 'previous.After', 'opening', 'scene', 'ask', 'why', 'Repeated', 'several', 'times', 'phrase', 'cop', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Watch', 'funny', 'exchange', 'Hasty', 'Hathaway', 'regarding', 'whereabouts', 'Rose', 'Gammon', 'old', ""'Who"", 'first', 'schtick', 'seriously', 'Jesse', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'get', 'anyone', 'staff', 'department', 'town', 'council', 'not', 'encouraged', 'personnel', 'loyalty', 'So', 'aside', 'rebuilding', 'department', 'catching', 'bomber', 'everything', 'great.Prime', 'suspect', 'Gino', 'Fish.Two', 'things', 'changed', 'talking', 'Jen', 'ex-wife', 'Councilman', 'Hanson', 'Jesse', 'help']",N/A

The script keeps the series alive and opens the door for future episodes. The ending was a little weak and is the reason for giving it 4.7 stars instead of a full five. It wasn't real clear of what was going on and failed to fully explain what happened (I won't give any spoilers in order to explain).Understanding the past episodes is needed to fully appreciate this installment.

I would be thrilled to see future Selleck-Stone movies but I suspect &#34;Benefit of the Doubt&#34; is &#34;The Last Harrah.&#34;  This finale of the Selleck-Stone series is strong, artistic and stand-up-able.  As a fan, you will be able to see all of the previous Selleck-Stone movie characters back to play their extremely charismatic roles.  How much fun to see Captain Healy (Stephen McHattie), Gino Fish (William Sadler), Hasty Hathaway (Saul Rubinek and Dr. Dix (William Devane) back on the screene together and placed in an outstanding, action-packed 90-minute TV movie.  The show is great ! Believe me! I am just a little disappointed that I didn't get to see more face-time with Suitcase (Kohl Sudduth).  I think Suitcase was the most aspiring character in all of the Jesse Stone movies.  I also missed Emily Bishop (Mae Whitman).  Even though she was only in two Jesse Stone movies, &#34;Death in Paradise&#34; and &#34;No Remorse,&#34; I did enjoy her on screen. The only real fluff in this show was the Paradise Motel scene with the motel owner (who was that guy?) and Rose's X (who cares).  Regardless, I like the strong, enthusiastic strength Selleck put into &#34;Benefit of the Doubt.&#34;  He believed and I believed.  Their repetition of lines are always fun and twisty.  Gotta &#34;stir things up&#34; is part of my phraseology now.  It is FUN ! If you are hoping to find Benefit of the Doubt anywhere but on a DVD.  Good Luck.

1545009,AQ0IOZ4K35T4W,B0083H6APG,Diva52,"[1, 2]","I thought about how to review this new made-for-TV movie for anyone who isn't already in love with Tom Selleck and the Jesse Stone series (and a fan of the late, great master crime writer, Robert B. Parker)and whether this would be an interesting movie for that first time viewer.  I think it would.  I think all the Jesse Stone movies are great stand-alone films.  If anything, they would make the viewer want to see the previous movies (there have been 8, I believe).Jesse Stone is a police chief in a small town on the East Coast.  In this movie, a new viewer might not understand all the relationships of the characters, but you'll know enough to not be confused. However, I want to comment on some of those characters:  first and foremost, I, personally, LOVED, LOVED, LOVED seeing ""Suitcase"" as a fisherman (he used to be a police officer in Paradise).  He suddenly turned very sexy for me!!  Wow.  Seeing him stand on the boat, his arm muscles straining against his fisherman shirt.  Sigh.  Sorry, Mr. Selleck--I didn't think anyone could ever affect me the way you always have!! :)And that might be what is lacking lately in these films.  Jesse still has the women, but I'm not feeling him like I used to.  A lot has happened to his character, but it is developing so slowly that it seems to just stand still now.  I like that Jen is no long a voice-over telephone call.  Jesse decided to stop talking to his ex-wife (Jen) because he realized talking to her was not helpful and made him feel bad.  But in this movie, he admits that he is still in love with her.  So......that's still there.  He still drinks......He still is moody and uncommunicative.  His current bed partner, or as he puts it, his ""pal who has sex with him"" works only because she is more afraid of commitment than he is and she doesn't ask any questions about his job or how he works.  But that's not a real relationship.  If he is spending $180/hr to talk to his shrink, Dix, he's not getting his money's worth, in my opinion and I'd like to see more development of Jesse.  He's just too, too sad and withdrawn lately.  Nothing seems to make him smile, even a little bit anymore.  And I miss him straigtening the frame of his picture of the shortstop he admires so much.  That at least showed the viewer that there was once something that he used to love with all his heart.Joe, as Reggie, is great.  He is the dog that Jesse picked up on a case long ago.  Reggie has great expressions as he looks at Jesse, but surely by now, Jesse could have something more to say to him than, ""What are you looking at??""  Reggie, a faithful and patient companion has begun to sleep on the bed with Jesse and sit next to him on the sofa.  Go, Reggie!  Maybe you can draw him out and bring that ol' Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck twinkle back to his eye!  I miss that.  Either that, or for goodness sakes, bring back Rita Fiore (Mimi Rogers).  That could do it too!  It might even let us see that famous dimple one more time (please???).  I digress, sorry--different character, different series. But still, it would be nice.The story was interesting and not as complicated and multi-layered as previous story-lines.  I didn't get as ""lost"" in this movie as I have others.  The evidence didn't seem to add up and it didn't feel as much of an investigation as just a story wrap up.  For instance, why was the sniper at the boat in the end?  I suppose the answer is obvious, but it didn't seem to fit--either as a surprise or as a scary/thrilling chase.  It was just there, sort of ho-hum.I gave this movie 5 stars because I did truly love it.  When it came in the mail, I grinned, knowing I could watch it after dinner and I was happy to have to have it to look forward to.  The reason this review seems less than a 5 star-er is only because I DO love the series so much and that as a viewer, I want certain things to happen now, especially this far into the series.  I want to know more than I did 8 movies ago and I don't.  And that's frustrating to me.  I want Jesse to be the ultimate hero in each movie and the gum chewing, coffee drinking, mono-syllable dialog is disappointing to me. I want to shake him up!  But, again, that's because I am an old-timey fan of everyone connected to the series.  That said, I would still definitely rate this particular movie high on the list.

Jesse sets out to solve the mystery, working somewhat at odds with the state homicide squad and an inquisitive town councilman.Like previous installments of the Jesse Stone franchise, Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone spends a lot of time drinking coffee and contemplating the beautiful seascape of Paradise with his aging dog, when he's not breaking into his own office, stepping on official toes, romancing the secretary at the local car dealership, or reaching out to former employees.  Most of the recurring cast of the Jesse Stone movies make appearences, including Kathy Baker, William Devane, and William Sadler.  However, this story is mostly about Jesse's refusal to accept the easy answer about the death of the previous chief.  His dogged pursuit of justice and his considerable detecting skills lead him down a thin trail of clues to a surprising discovery, and a suspenseful final confrontation aboard a derelict ship.""Benefit of the Doubt"" is an improvement over the last movie, with a plot that moves right along and another opportunity to watch a gifted veteran actor work a role he seems a natural for.

""Benefit of the Doubt"" is much better than the previous two despite the almost complete absence of two of the best assets of the series: Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth. Both make brief appearances in this film but the story lacks the warmth of their characters as Jessie Stone's supportive colleagues. I regard Tom Selleck as an actor who improves as he gets older. The Jessie Stone movies are not designed for those with short attention spans. The plots are strong and there is a strong emphasis on character and ambience. They are to be enjoyed in the same way as a fine wine or a well brewed lager. The prospect of Kohl Sudduth returning as a full-time character in later stories is very good news. The only quibble I have with these stories is the insistence on coupling Jessie Stone, as played by Tom Selleck, romantically with women who are young enough to be his daughters.

1545080,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0083H6APG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[352, 360]","Tom Selleck is back in the role he was born to play for this eighth outing in the popular Jesse Stone series. Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out. I don't know who author Robert B. Parker might have envisioned inhabiting his iconic small town police chief, but Selleck has certainly owned and perfected the role over the course of these last seven years of TV movies. Starting in 2005, these movies have proven that there is still an adult audience looking for thoughtful drama. I do think each chapter thus far has enough to recommend it on its own merits. You'll appreciate the films to varying degrees as with any serialization--some you may love, some just like. Here's a run down before I comment of ""Benefit of the Doubt.""2005: Stone Cold2006: Night Passage2006: Death In Paradise2007: Sea Change2009: Thin Ice2010: No Remorse2011: Innocents lost2012: Benefit Of The Doubt""Benefit of the Doubt"" starts out with a literal bang. An explosion rocks the Paradise police force and Jesse come out of his forced retirement to piece together what happened. Is it corruption? Drugs? Jesse, even more than usual, is a one man show (although he shares jurisdiction with state agencies). His former friends and co-workers (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth) have abandoned the department, so Jesse's primary allies are his bottomless cup of coffee and faithful dog (not to mention a tryst with a local chanteuse, Gloria Rueben). This case affects Paradise in a major way, so the local bigwigs (including the reliable Saul Rubinek reprising Hastings Hathaway) are under much pressure to get things squared away. With quiet and precision, Jesse sees through what things were meant to look like to find the more nefarious truths underneath. While not the most compelling mystery of the series, it fits comfortably into the increasingly aloof vibe. In truth, the screenplay (Selleck shares a writing credit) may be a little too open-ended and laconic for some but that's progressively become the world that Jesse lives in. In the end, almost everything is left hanging and very little explanation is given for the rather large plot twists. In fact, for my taste, the vague resolution and lack of answers that fit into the context of the series left me wanting (and I'd rate this chapter at 3 1/2 stars for that reason).For me, the Stone sereis has been more defined by its subtle characterizations than by its independent mysteries. Selleck is so world weary and introspective. I don't know that there has ever been a serialized crime drama that is so reliant on quiet moments and character contemplation. And, in truth, it is this moody thoughtfulness that has really made this series of movies strikingly unique in the modern television landscape. Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects. And, as always, the icing on the cake is the pitch perfect Tom Selleck who paints Jesse as both lovable and excruciatingly frustrating. I, personally, think that Stone is Selleck's best role--it is no wonder that he has revived him eight times.

Unfortunately what works a few times doesn't always continue to do so as is evident here.The film opens with the death by explosion of the town Police Chief who replaced Stone a movie or two back. With no one on hand to replace him, the town comes to Stone to take back his old job. There are no other police officers on hand since all of them quit once the newest Chief took over Stone's position. It was a political move and had nothing to do with the job. They knew it and took off for greener pastures.As Stone begins digging into the case he uncovers all sorts of clues that lead in numerous directions. But one of these clues must be leading somewhere as a hit man makes an attempt on Jesse's life. As if the murder of the police Chief wasn't enough to raise suspicions this certainly makes it so.To say there is a deeper storyline going on here is to give the movie more credit than it deserves. Of course there is the continuing development of the character of Stone who deals with depression and the feeling that his job was his life and he is little without it. But the film moves at such a slow pace, something that worked before, that you find yourself thinking come on get on with it finally.The mystery at the center of the film feels like there are no clues that would lead the viewer to the answer. It's one of those movies where the end feels too contrived and done just to finish things off rather than a methodical police story where clues are worked out to get from point A to point Z.I enjoy watching Selleck in almost everything I've seen him in. I've even enjoyed several of the other movies in this series. But this time around I just felt like it was being done just to make another one.
