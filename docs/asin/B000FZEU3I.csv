997709,A2Q05I3W8HAROC,B000FZEU3I,"Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava""","[1, 1]","Reviewed by Amanda Volovik ""Chava"": I am giving it two stars instead of one because the cinematography is done well, and there is some good acting. This movie doesn't provide the variety in what seems to be a 'Hostel' inspired movie (The title 'H6' and the telling cover art). To be fair, this is a Spanish movie with subtitles and is unrated, so it's already going to be different than American horror.The fellow who is the lead character kills his girlfriend, is incarcerated for his crime, and after he is let out, inherits a guesthouse (yes, it's similar to a hostel, okay, I got it). He uses this dank and empty hotel to play out his new 'life's work' based on the life's work of a true life obscure serial killer. He is doing the 'Saw' movie morality play, and has a corny voice over narrative (the subtitles didn't help) on the poetic causes of evil in these deserving victims, and it is funny because look what HE'S been planning AND doing! So the script can get silly. And if you come in with the expectation of a Hostel type movie, conversely, you get a lack of variety in the victims' stories and methods of horror.The torture and killing scenes are terrible, yes, but let's face it, a lot of us have seen all the Hostels, Human Centipedes, Faces of Death and maybe even A Serbian Film...I can't recommend this as very interesting for seasoned horror fans. Now, if you've never seen a horror film and this is your first, you would be shocked and disturbed.**Possible Spoiler: On one part the leading actor tells a pimp, 'You shouldn't hit and abuse women, ever!' over and over. However, in the last three days or so the lead actor has tortured and murdered a number of women. As I mentioned before, that hypocritical morality speech he does regarding his victims becomes comical, and I don't think that was the producer/director's intent.",2,Not to be a Jaded Horror Fan - But a Little More Variety Please,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,1849,"['Reviewed', 'Amanda', 'Volovik', 'Chava', 'am', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'cinematography', 'done', 'well', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'provide', 'variety', 'what', 'be', ""'Hostel"", 'inspired', 'movie', 'title', 'telling', 'cover', 'art', 'be', 'fair', 'Spanish', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'unrated', 'already', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'American', 'horror.The', 'fellow', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'incarcerated', 'crime', 'let', 'out', 'guesthouse', 'yes', 'similar', 'hostel', 'okay', 'got', 'dank', 'empty', 'hotel', 'play', 'out', 'new', ""'life"", 'work', 'based', 'life', 'work', 'true', 'life', 'obscure', 'serial', 'killer', 'doing', ""'Saw"", 'movie', 'morality', 'play', 'corny', 'voice', 'narrative', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'poetic', 'causes', 'evil', 'deserving', 'victims', 'funny', 'look', 'what', 'HE', 'been', 'planning', 'doing', 'script', 'can', 'get', 'silly', 'come', 'expectation', 'Hostel', 'type', 'movie', 'conversely', 'get', 'lack', 'variety', 'victims', 'stories', 'methods', 'horror.The', 'torture', 'killing', 'scenes', 'are', 'terrible', 'yes', 'let', 'face', 'lot', 'have', 'seen', 'Hostels', 'Human', 'Centipedes', 'Faces', 'Death', 'maybe', 'even', 'A', 'Serbian', 'Film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'very', 'interesting', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'fans', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'first', 'would', 'be', 'shocked', 'disturbed', '**Possible', 'Spoiler', 'one', 'part', 'leading', 'actor', 'pimp', 'should', ""n't"", 'hit', 'abuse', 'women', 'ever', 'However', 'last', 'three', 'days', 'so', 'lead', 'actor', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'number', 'women', 'mentioned', 'before', 'hypocritical', 'morality', 'speech', 'regarding', 'victims', 'becomes', 'comical', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'producer/director', 'intent']",N/A

997715,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B000FZEU3I,Nick Schwartz,"[1, 1]","[MINOR SPOILERS]The DVD artwork for this film features a blurb from a review of the movie that compares it to Eli Roth's 'Hostel,' which is likely where many of the comparisons have come from.  This is a totally different film, in almost every way, shape and form.  While Roth's effort suffered from an inability to decide whether it wanted to be psychologically disturbing (horror through suggestion, as well as the unsettling nature of the subject matter) or in-your-face with its gore, 'H6' knows exactly what it is from the outset: a serial killer thriller that builds slowly, keeps its gore mostly off-screen and merely suggested, but loses steam in its second half when nothing new seems to be happening.Antonio Frau is imprisoned after violently murdering his girlfriend during an argument.  Released many years later, he finds he has inherited an old brothel from his aunt.  He decides it is his purpose to 'cleanse' the streets of 'unclean' citizens, by utilizing his newly inherited estate to lure in prostitutes and murder them.  Inspired by a similar case, he also decides to document - in great detail - all of his exploits in a diary.  He gets married so as to have someone to vouch for his innocence in case of trouble, and persuades his wife to work night shifts in a hospital, so he can deal with his victims.Though not explicitly mentioned in any reviews on this site, other reviews have mentioned the misogynistic nature of this film.  Whether or not that was the filmmaker's intent, the fact the killer only kills prostitutes is telling; surely there are just as many evil or corrupt men for him to dispatch?  (In fact, he does murder the abusive pimp of one of his potential victims; still, the amount of screen time given to this death is a fraction of what is given to the torture of the women).  Adding to the misogynistic nature of the narrative is the fact that Antonio is never really punished in the end for his actions.Now, back to 'Hostel,' briefly.  The reason this film drew comparisons to Eli Roth's picture is no doubt because of the torture scenes in this movie.  Antonio's victims are tied to a metal table in a locked room and made to suffer before he kills them.  That's where any similarities end.  Unlike Eli Roth's film, the torture in 'H6' is deeply disturbing because it is entirely psychological, and will haunt you longer because of it.  Antonio's victims are aware they are going to die, yet are made to wait for days as Antonio scrutinizes them for his diary, probing them with questions about just what in their pasts led them to drugs and prostitution.  He feeds them nothing, and rapes them constantly as their conditions deteriorate.  And then finally, when they are weak enough to accept their deaths as an inevitability he brutally kills them with a chainsaw.  And when he does kill them, director Martin Garrido Baron wisely pans his camera away, aware that the extent of the psychological  torture the audience has witnessed leading up to each death is far more gruesome than any make-up effect could ever hope to achieve.The first problem with the film is that the second half drags a lot.  Once Antonio begins his rampage, very little new information is presented, and his character does not seem to develop.  Unfortunately, since the film is basically a character study of Antonio (his diary after all) this detracts largely from the overall experience.The cinematography in the film is generally very strong; inventive and effective in creating an atmosphere of helplessness and despair.  Yet the editing is erratic and sometimes counterproductive to the mood of the narrative.  During slow scenes (there are a lot, since the film takes its time getting started, and the second half drags) it almost appears as if the editor increases the pace of each cut just to artificially add intensity, cutting to new shots when there is no new information to be gained from doing so, and then quickly cutting back.  During conversations this just looks downright silly.Overall, while 'H6' has some things working in its favor, there is ultimately too much going against it for me to give it a sincere recommendation.",2,"Two and a Half Stars - Deeply Disturbing, But Flawed",1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,4165,"['[', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'film', 'blurb', 'review', 'movie', 'Eli', 'Roth', ""'Hostel"", 'likely', 'where', 'many', 'comparisons', 'have', 'come', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'almost', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Roth', 'effort', 'suffered', 'inability', 'decide', 'wanted', 'be', 'psychologically', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'suggestion', 'as', 'well', 'unsettling', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'in-your-face', 'gore', 'knows', 'exactly', 'what', 'outset', 'serial', 'killer', 'thriller', 'slowly', 'gore', 'mostly', 'off-screen', 'merely', 'suggested', 'steam', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'nothing', 'new', 'be', 'happening.Antonio', 'Frau', 'imprisoned', 'violently', 'murdering', 'girlfriend', 'argument', 'Released', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'inherited', 'old', 'brothel', 'aunt', 'purpose', ""'cleanse"", 'streets', ""'unclean"", 'citizens', 'utilizing', 'newly', 'inherited', 'estate', 'lure', 'prostitutes', 'murder', 'Inspired', 'similar', 'case', 'also', 'document', 'great', 'detail', 'exploits', 'diary', 'married', 'so', 'have', 'someone', 'vouch', 'innocence', 'case', 'trouble', 'wife', 'work', 'night', 'shifts', 'hospital', 'can', 'deal', 'victims.Though', 'not', 'explicitly', 'mentioned', 'reviews', 'site', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'misogynistic', 'nature', 'film', 'not', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'intent', 'fact', 'killer', 'only', 'prostitutes', 'telling', 'surely', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'evil', 'corrupt', 'men', 'dispatch', 'fact', 'murder', 'abusive', 'pimp', 'one', 'potential', 'victims', 'still', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'death', 'fraction', 'what', 'given', 'torture', 'women', 'Adding', 'misogynistic', 'nature', 'narrative', 'fact', 'Antonio', 'never', 'really', 'punished', 'end', 'actions.Now', 'back', ""'Hostel"", 'briefly', 'reason', 'film', 'drew', 'comparisons', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'picture', 'doubt', 'torture', 'movie', 'Antonio', 'victims', 'are', 'tied', 'metal', 'table', 'locked', 'room', 'made', 'suffer', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'film', 'torture', ""'H6"", 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'entirely', 'psychological', 'will', 'haunt', 'longer', 'Antonio', 'victims', 'are', 'aware', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'are', 'made', 'wait', 'days', 'Antonio', 'diary', 'probing', 'questions', 'just', 'what', 'pasts', 'led', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'nothing', 'constantly', 'conditions', 'deteriorate', 'then', 'finally', 'when', 'are', 'weak', 'enough', 'accept', 'deaths', 'inevitability', 'brutally', 'chainsaw', 'when', 'kill', 'director', 'Martin', 'Garrido', 'Baron', 'wisely', 'camera', 'away', 'aware', 'extent', 'psychological', 'torture', 'audience', 'witnessed', 'leading', 'up', 'death', 'far', 'more', 'gruesome', 'make-up', 'effect', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'achieve.The', 'first', 'problem', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'lot', 'Once', 'Antonio', 'rampage', 'very', 'little', 'new', 'information', 'presented', 'character', 'not', 'seem', 'develop', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'basically', 'character', 'study', 'Antonio', 'diary', 'largely', 'overall', 'experience.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'generally', 'very', 'strong', 'inventive', 'effective', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'helplessness', 'despair', 'editing', 'erratic', 'sometimes', 'counterproductive', 'mood', 'narrative', 'slow', 'scenes', 'are', 'lot', 'film', 'time', 'getting', 'started', 'second', 'half', 'drags', 'almost', 'editor', 'pace', 'cut', 'just', 'artificially', 'add', 'intensity', 'cutting', 'new', 'shots', 'when', 'new', 'information', 'be', 'gained', 'doing', 'so', 'then', 'quickly', 'cutting', 'back', 'conversations', 'just', 'downright', 'silly.Overall', 'things', 'working', 'favor', 'ultimately', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'give', 'sincere', 'recommendation']",N/A
997716,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FZEU3I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","H6: Diary of a Serial Killer (Martin Garrido Baron, 2005)Have you seen any of the recent rash of low-rent serial-killer biopics? I'm not talking about the big, gaudy, theatrically-released flicks like Chopper here. I'm talking about, say, David Jacobson's Dahmer (starring a young Jeremy Renner) from 2002, or Chuck Parello's 2000 Ed Gein (with Steve Railsback in the title role)--movies that have a lot more in common with Deranged than they do with Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer. (Or, for that matter, even such fictional classics as M.) Did you ever wonder to yourself whether, or why, someone would want to create one of these low-budget biopics for a completely fictional serial killer? Neither did I. But then I saw H6, and that's exactly what it is.Antonio Frau (TV actor Fernando Acaso, doing his best Javier Bardem impersonation) and his wife Francesca (Maria Jose Bausa, in her first, and to date last, screen appearance), seem to be happy orbiting in their own separate places. Frau has recently been released from prison, always proclaiming his innocence. While he was up the river, Maria started an affair with the doctor she works for, and that's still going on. It'snever explicitly stated that Antonio knows, but I always got the feeling he did. It doesn't dim his ardor for her one bit, but like Francesca, Antonio is pretty much insatiable. The difference is that his urges come with a darker twist; instead of having affairs, he prefers rape, torture, and murder, and the bulk of the film goes back and forth between him abducting and killing young woman, usually prostitutes, and darkly comic scenes of his trying to hide what's going on in room H6 of the boarding-house they're fixing up from Francesca.So you tell me. Are director Martin Garrido Baron and writer/actor Martin Garrido the same guy? I can't tell, and IMDB seems to believe they're different, but I'm having a hard time believing it (Barron has only two credits, both of them working on Garrido flicks). Depending, This is either Baron's first or fifth film, and that really does make a difference in how I would rate this shindig; some of its problems are generally forgivable from first-time directors (like the stuttering pace of the thing, especially during its first half-hour), but not so much in someone who's been directing for more than two decades, albeit rarely. Don't get me wrong it's not a terrible film; the acting is good for the most part, the lighting is spectacular (especially in H6 itself), the script isn't bad. But this is a movie that could have been so, so much more than it is. The DVD box blazons, ""Europe's answer to Hostel!"".
