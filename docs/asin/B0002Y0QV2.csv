849965,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B0002Y0QV2,AbeStreet,"[2, 4]","In general there are no glaring changes to the show.  Remembering that this is a show based on a comic book icon and that the storylines and character reactions to life changing events just don't have the impact they might if similar events happened in the ""real world"", I'd have to say Smallville is still a show with good writing.  However, I'm beginning to see some fatigue.  How much longer can the writers drag out the tension between Lana and Clark?  Well, considering the show is now going into season five, I guess the writers feel as though it can go on indefinitely.  Personally I think it's getting old.If I lived in Smallville I wouldn't trust anyone.  Someone is always coming under some kind of evil influence, having someone else take over his or her body or having their mind altered.  Still at the end of the show these characters just shrug off these types of assaults and carry on as though nothing has happened.  The same goes for routine explosions, weird mutations and powers.  Nobody in Smallville seems to think such events or mutations are that big of a deal.  Most of us would need therapy for quite awhile if we ever experienced what goes on in Smallville.Low point for season three.  I didn't care for the ending cliffhanger that bridged seasons two and three together.  A sixteen-year-old kid that runs away to the big city and lives a life of crime until he's brought home to resume his normal life as a sixteen-year-old kid seemed to be more unrealistic than a kid that can lift tractors.Highpoint for season three.  I thought the episode that involved Clark falling for another teenage girl with hidden super powers was a step in the right direction towards developing the character of Clark Kent.  I was glad to see that story continue into season four.As for the DVD, it's a great buy.  Plenty of extra features, widescreen transfer and priced just right.  Why Smallville, a successful show currently in production can be priced around the forty-dollar mark and other hit shows currently in production, like C.S.I., sell for almost twice what Smallville does is a mystery to me.  I suspect greed is the answer and I'm glad the producers of the Smallville DVD's have a little more respect for their fan base than other franchises do.",3,"Still a good show, but begining to show script fatigue.",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2266,"['general', 'are', 'glaring', 'changes', 'show', 'Remembering', 'show', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'icon', 'storylines', 'character', 'reactions', 'life', 'changing', 'events', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'impact', 'might', 'similar', 'events', 'happened', 'real', 'world', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Smallville', 'still', 'show', 'good', 'writing', 'However', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'see', 'fatigue', 'How', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'writers', 'drag', 'tension', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'Well', 'considering', 'show', 'now', 'going', 'season', 'five', 'guess', 'writers', 'feel', 'can', 'go', 'indefinitely', 'Personally', 'think', 'getting', 'old.If', 'lived', 'Smallville', 'would', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', 'Someone', 'always', 'coming', 'kind', 'evil', 'influence', 'having', 'someone', 'else', 'take', 'over', 'body', 'having', 'mind', 'altered', 'Still', 'end', 'show', 'characters', 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'types', 'assaults', 'carry', 'nothing', 'happened', 'same', 'routine', 'explosions', 'weird', 'mutations', 'powers', 'Nobody', 'Smallville', 'think', 'such', 'events', 'mutations', 'are', 'big', 'deal', 'Most', 'would', 'need', 'therapy', 'quite', 'awhile', 'ever', 'experienced', 'what', 'Smallville.Low', 'point', 'season', 'three', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'ending', 'cliffhanger', 'bridged', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'together', 'sixteen-year-old', 'kid', 'away', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'crime', 'brought', 'home', 'resume', 'normal', 'life', 'sixteen-year-old', 'kid', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'kid', 'can', 'lift', 'tractors.Highpoint', 'season', 'three', 'thought', 'episode', 'involved', 'Clark', 'falling', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hidden', 'super', 'powers', 'was', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'towards', 'developing', 'character', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'story', 'continue', 'season', 'four.As', 'DVD', 'great', 'buy', 'Plenty', 'extra', 'features', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'priced', 'just', 'right', 'Why', 'Smallville', 'successful', 'show', 'currently', 'production', 'can', 'be', 'priced', 'forty-dollar', 'mark', 'other', 'hit', 'shows', 'currently', 'production', 'C.S.I.', 'sell', 'almost', 'twice', 'what', 'Smallville', 'mystery', 'suspect', 'greed', 'answer', ""'m"", 'glad', 'producers', 'Smallville', 'DVD', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'fan', 'base', 'other', 'franchises', 'do']",N/A
849966,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002Y0QV2,A. Burchfield,"[1, 1]","Following pretty much the same set up as the first two DVD sets, Season three has a lot of interesting stuff. Clark still can't fly (except for a bit in #22 Covenant) but you get a lot if the things that made seasons 1& 2 so interesting.I thought the most of #1 Exile, #3 Extinction brought up the idea of Kryptonite bullets (why'd it take almost 70 years for that one to come up?),#5 Perry had it's moments,#6 Relic introduced us to Jor-El, who visited Smallville before Jonathan Kent was born (nice guy, then). Obsession, #14, was interesting, so was #16 Crisis. Chistopher Reeve's last actual appearance on the series in #17 Legacy had a lot to it, too bad he died before that storyline could be fully developed. Talisman, #20 hinted at the evil future of one or both Luthors but still didn't explain Kryptons link with Earth. My brother pointed out something interesting about this episode- In the University museum the Indian Professor takes Clark on a tour of all of the Indian artifacts are from the Northwest (such as Canada, where the show is filmed) yet this is supposed to be in Kansas. I sort of liked #22 Covenant with Kara and the flight scene but it's a complete turn around for Jor'El's character in #6. I'd really like that to be explained soon.You get a selection of deleted scenes on some episodes (we didn't usually miss much by their not being left in the episode), a few commentaries (I haven't tried them), a gag reel (not too funny), a mini documentary on the people behind the camera (that is interesting)and the Chloe Chronicles Vol. II. This last one apparently first ran on the web and features Allison Mack in Character as Chloe continuing her investigations, this time with Sam Jones III, as Pete, playing her camera man. I think it's actually an improvement over Vol.I, one chapter was in comic book form (from an actual print edition?)evidently it had too much material for a low budget minifeature.I think the show Smallville is pretty good TV, better than most of what The WB has on these days.",3,"pretty good TV, the best the WB has on",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2028,"['Following', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Season', 'three', 'lot', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'Clark', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'bit', '22', 'Covenant', 'get', 'lot', 'things', 'made', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'so', 'interesting.I', 'thought', 'most', '1', 'Exile', '3', 'Extinction', 'brought', 'up', 'idea', 'Kryptonite', 'bullets', 'why', ""'d"", 'take', 'almost', '70', 'years', 'one', 'come', 'up', '5', 'Perry', 'had', 'moments', '6', 'Relic', 'introduced', 'Jor-El', 'who', 'visited', 'Smallville', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'was', 'born', 'nice', 'guy', 'then', 'Obsession', '14', 'was', 'interesting', 'so', 'was', '16', 'Crisis', 'Chistopher', 'Reeve', 'last', 'actual', 'appearance', 'series', '17', 'Legacy', 'had', 'lot', 'too', 'bad', 'died', 'storyline', 'could', 'be', 'fully', 'developed', 'Talisman', '20', 'hinted', 'evil', 'future', 'one', 'Luthors', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Kryptons', 'link', 'Earth', 'brother', 'pointed', 'out', 'something', 'interesting', 'episode-', 'University', 'museum', 'Indian', 'Professor', 'Clark', 'tour', 'Indian', 'artifacts', 'are', 'Northwest', 'such', 'Canada', 'where', 'show', 'filmed', 'yet', 'supposed', 'be', 'Kansas', 'sort', 'liked', '22', 'Covenant', 'Kara', 'flight', 'scene', 'complete', 'turn', 'around', ""Jor'El"", 'character', '6', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'be', 'explained', 'soon.You', 'get', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'usually', 'miss', 'much', 'not', 'being', 'left', 'episode', 'few', 'commentaries', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'gag', 'reel', 'not', 'too', 'funny', 'mini', 'documentary', 'people', 'camera', 'interesting', 'Chloe', 'Chronicles', 'Vol', 'II', 'last', 'one', 'apparently', 'first', 'ran', 'web', 'features', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Character', 'Chloe', 'continuing', 'investigations', 'time', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'Pete', 'playing', 'camera', 'man', 'think', 'actually', 'improvement', 'Vol.I', 'one', 'chapter', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'form', 'actual', 'print', 'edition', 'evidently', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'low', 'budget', 'minifeature.I', 'think', 'show', 'Smallville', 'pretty', 'good', 'TV', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'WB', 'days']",N/A

With the scheduling conflict (they could've kept it on Tuesdays!), we were unable to watch a lot of Season Three on TV, so I'm glad that I bought this DVD set.This set was the most compelling out of all the seasons I've seen thus far because the main storyline was a lot about Clark's destiny--and how long he'll fight his biological father, Jor-el, and with the Luthors--especially Lionel--staying on the Kent's heels.What I missed on TV were a lot of surprises and plot twists that still remain throughout the rest of the series.  There's the fact that Pete's leaving, Lana and Clark are getting on each other's nerves, Chloe's turned into Lionel's puppet, and Lex has a psychological break, and scrambles to retrieve lost memories, while finding some that he probably didn't want to remember in the first place.  No need to put any more spoilers here, because if you're reading this review, you've probably seen them already on TV (or have them on DVD by now).Getting this season on DVD made a lot of connections that I missed.

I related to Clark quite a lot during his time on the road: the struggle, the pain, the loss--definitely made me relive some memories I wasn't too keen on reliving ever again.This season also showed how evil Lionel Luthor really was and how he stopped at nothing--utterly nothing--to create his empire and, eventually, receive power that most definitely, in this case, fell into the wrong hands.Clark got a new superpower, this time his super hearing, which was done way cool and not just some fire-drill-like noise ringing in his ears.I loved this season despite how bleak it was and was thrilled to death when Christopher Reeve reprised his role as Dr. Virgil Swann.

849972,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002Y0QV2,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[11, 18]","I don't know why it is, but for the shows that I truly love and collect, the third seasons for all of them always seem to be the best or one of the top best. Season three of this hit WB series follows in that tradition. The third season of Smallville is explosive. Things change throughout the entire season, and some relationships and interactions will never be the same. Season three busts open a door that will never be able to be closed when the series resumes in the fall. The premiere, ""Exile"", is the best premiere of the season. Clark, under the impression of red kryptonite, has gone to Metropolis, and runs afoul of crim lord Morgan Edge(the fantastic Rutger Hauer). And Lex is stranded on an island, slowly going insane. What a season premiere!. The second part, ""Phoenix"", is just as good, with Papa Kent(John Schneider) going to the limit in order to save his son and bring him home. An explosive two part opener. There are many highs here. The show is always at it's best and most interesting when fooling around with Superman mythology. One here is ""Perry"", which introduces future Daily Planet editor Perry White, played by Michael McKean(husband of Annette 'O' Toole). A great episode with a fine turn by McKean. ""Relic"" is a doozy that has Clark thinking his father was in town long ago and may of been involved in a murder. The ep features flashbacks to that time, and it's an outstanding episode. So is ""Legacy"", which has the eventful showdown between Jonathan, and the evil Lionel Luthor, who is continuing to find out the secrets of the cave and the mystery that is Clark Kent. Christopher Reeve also returns in this episode as Dr. Virgil Swann. The Luthor dynasty gets a real workout this year, and ""Memoria"" is the best ep that showcases that story. It's a beautiful, surprising, and brilliantly executed episode. Lex's sanity is in question during much of the season. ""Shattered"" and ""Asylum"" are both cold and interesting episodes. The latter featuring three returning villains from Clark's past as well. You will have to watch to see who they are. The finale, ""Covenant"", is spectacular. The end climax is shocking, haunting, and tragic all at once. The best finale of the series. With any show, there are some slumps. The ones here are ""Velocity"", ""Magnetic"", and a few others. There are some twists and turns this season, and the writers did a good job of shaking things up and setting exciting new things in motion for season 4. The cast continues to shine, but poor Sam Jones III still gets short changed. Tom Welling continues to evolve as a fine actor and leading man, and no one can play slimy evil like John Glover. If only Kristin Kreuk has writers who wrote something better for her and her character. The effects continue to be breathtaking and creative and eye catching. Some of the niftiest looking effects currently on TV.

849975,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002Y0QV2,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 4]","Leaping onto the television landscape in Fall 2001, Smallville follows the exploits of a young Clark Kent in the years leading up to his emergence as the beloved Superman. Following a slew of TV renditions of the character's life since the comic book first appeared, Smallville sets itself apart by focusing on the lesser discussed niche of Clark's earliest developmental days. Superb casting and consistent writing have combined to make Smallville one of the more popular shows on television (especially in international markets), making the show one of the WB network's most successful creations to date...Tom Welling stars in the imminent role of teenager Clark Kent, a refugee from the dying planet of Krypton. His ship having landed in the rural American town of Smallville, Clark is raised by locals Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan Kent (John Schneider - of Dukes of Hazzard fame) as their own son. Unlike some of the film and TV spin-offs, Smallville attributes powers to other individuals in the area as a result of some of the debris associated with Krypton's destruction. As a result, Clark is forced to keep his own powers a secret while battling against other individuals who are more powerful than traditional human criminal elements. The show also provides a glimpse into the early friendship experienced between Clark and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) as well as Clark's romance with two high school classmates, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Part sci-fi fantasy and part teenage soap, Smallville is an instant television classic...The Smallville (Season 3) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Exile"" in which Clark Kent engages in a massive crime spree in the Metropolis (having been transformed by the effects of red kryptonite). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor must grapple with his own conscience while secluded on an island, and Jonathan Kent frantically searches for Clark, going to great lengths to obtain the power necessary to end the ill effects of the red kryptonite... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Magnetic"" in which a mysterious newcomer to Clark's school exhibits special magnetic powers (including the ability to attract Lana), and ""Hereafter"" in which Clark's discovers that his classmate Jordan can see into the future, prompting a prediction that Lana will die in the next few days...Below is a list of episodes included on the Smallville (Season 3) DVD:Episode 45 (Exile)Episode 46 (Phoenix)Episode 47 (Extinction)Episode 48 (Slumber)Episode 49 (Perry)Episode 50 (Relic)Episode 51 (Magnetic)Episode 52 (Shattered)Episode 53 (Asylum)Episode 54 (Whisper)Episode 55 (Delete)Episode 56 (Hereafter)Episode 57 (Velocity)Episode 58 (Obsession)Episode 59 (Resurrection)Episode 60 (Crisis)Episode 61 (Legacy)Episode 62 (Truth)Episode 63 (Memoria)Episode 64 (Talisman)Episode 65 (Forsaken)Episode 66 (Covenant)The DVD Report",5,See Clark Kent in his teenage years...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2928,"['Leaping', 'television', 'landscape', 'Fall', '2001', 'Smallville', 'exploits', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'emergence', 'beloved', 'Superman', 'Following', 'slew', 'TV', 'renditions', 'character', 'life', 'comic', 'book', 'first', 'appeared', 'Smallville', 'apart', 'focusing', 'lesser', 'discussed', 'niche', 'Clark', 'earliest', 'developmental', 'days', 'Superb', 'casting', 'consistent', 'writing', 'have', 'combined', 'make', 'Smallville', 'one', 'more', 'popular', 'shows', 'television', 'especially', 'international', 'markets', 'making', 'show', 'one', 'WB', 'network', 'most', 'successful', 'creations', 'date', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'stars', 'imminent', 'role', 'teenager', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'refugee', 'dying', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'ship', 'having', 'landed', 'rural', 'American', 'town', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'raised', 'locals', 'Martha', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'fame', 'own', 'son', 'film', 'TV', 'spin-offs', 'Smallville', 'powers', 'other', 'individuals', 'area', 'result', 'debris', 'associated', 'Krypton', 'destruction', 'result', 'Clark', 'forced', 'keep', 'own', 'powers', 'secret', 'battling', 'other', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'traditional', 'human', 'criminal', 'elements', 'show', 'also', 'glimpse', 'early', 'friendship', 'experienced', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'as', 'well', 'Clark', 'romance', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Part', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'part', 'teenage', 'soap', 'Smallville', 'instant', 'television', 'classic', 'Smallville', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Exile', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'massive', 'crime', 'spree', 'Metropolis', 'having', 'been', 'transformed', 'effects', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'Meanwhile', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'must', 'grapple', 'own', 'conscience', 'secluded', 'island', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'frantically', 'Clark', 'going', 'great', 'lengths', 'obtain', 'power', 'necessary', 'end', 'ill', 'effects', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Magnetic', 'mysterious', 'newcomer', 'Clark', 'school', 'special', 'magnetic', 'powers', 'including', 'ability', 'attract', 'Lana', 'Hereafter', 'Clark', 'discovers', 'classmate', 'Jordan', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'prompting', 'prediction', 'Lana', 'will', 'die', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Smallville', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '45', 'Exile', 'Episode', '46', 'Phoenix', 'Episode', '47', 'Extinction', 'Episode', '48', 'Slumber', 'Episode', '49', 'Perry', 'Episode', '50', 'Relic', 'Episode', '51', 'Magnetic', 'Episode', '52', 'Shattered', 'Episode', '53', 'Asylum', 'Episode', '54', 'Whisper', 'Episode', '55', 'Delete', 'Episode', '56', 'Hereafter', 'Episode', '57', 'Velocity', 'Episode', '58', 'Obsession', 'Episode', '59', 'Resurrection', 'Episode', '60', 'Crisis', 'Episode', '61', 'Legacy', 'Episode', '62', 'Truth', 'Episode', '63', 'Memoria', 'Episode', '64', 'Talisman', 'Episode', '65', 'Forsaken', 'Episode', '66', 'Covenant', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

There was some cool stuff in season three, but I was about to give up on the series by the end.  The Clark/Lana/Chloe story line wore itself out a long time ago, and the show needed something new to keep me coming back.

I also don't find many episodes from the first three seasons, other than the pilot, that are worth watching more than a couple times.

Good thing since these 2 shows are still developing some great episodes with the occasional ""meh"" episode.Season 1 of Smallville was really about ""who is Clark Kent?"" Season 2 is ""where did he come from?"" Season 3 to me seems like a cross between the consequences of being Clark Kent and other times ""does he even want to be Clark Kent?""The season kicks off with the premiere Exile, which is the continuation of the last one Exodus(I think) where Clark did something quite damaging, donned a red kryptonite ring and ran to Metropolis. We start 3 months later on his family and friends fighting to bring him back home and a new villain Morgan Edge.The rest of the season is quite nice. Jonathan vs. Clark in the 2nd episode Phoenix, the introduction of Clark's future boss Perry White, some backstory on Jor-El, Lex's descent into madness, Clark's new power, a nice catfight between Lana and Chloe and the return of Christopher Reeve.There is still some clunkers though. ""Velocity"" is about Pete using kryptonite powered boosters for his car and basically being arrogant until he needs help then it's like Clark has to save him despite his warnings. ""Magnetic"" is about a kid who has the hots for Lana(like the rest of them) only he can control their behavior based on magnetism.

Watching the entire season all the way through at least manages to provide for an honest viewing experience and a decent mode of comparison.Overall, it is still Smallville, the freaky little Kansas town we all know and love.  The third season starts out with a great bang, a dizzingly heartbreaking first two episodes picking up three months after Season 2 ends.  It's intense, it's bad-boy, and heck, it fits perfectly in the Superman worldview.  Also set are a few events that will reach seasons into the future in some well-written and expandable plots.  There is an occasional tint of darkness along with a smidge of camp.  I give it a nod and a smile--it's all enjoyable!  Darkness is taken well, as well is the witty humor touched with those subtle Superman foreshadowings.Mostly.As there many notable benefits to this season there were also some flaws that left me thinking that some things could have been done better.  A fascinating plot twist is drudged from an episode boring itself deep into the realm of cheesy.  Emotion is attempted--and needed--for several storylines, but for whatever reason do not break through nearly as fully as they are needed.

Back in its first three glorious seasons it had some excellent stories, character progression & more importantly it was god damn entertaining.Hell even Lana was watchable. This was because back then the Clark/Lana relationship was organically fleshed out between its first three seasons, with season 1 being they get to know each other, Season 2 they fall in love & Season 3 they try & stay together but ultimately (or seemingly fail). Now had Lana stayed in Paris (which she should have) then this would have made the Clark/Lana story indeed tragic but from Season 4 onwards Lana would become a mascot for the creators & cease to be a character but more on that in my season 4 review.Anyway this season has some excellent episodes especially the episode Perry where Clark helps out a down & out Perry White wow those were the days, Clark was actuallt the star of his own show!!The season ends with the sensational Covenant where Chloe seemingly dies & Lionel goes to jail for the death of his parents & Lex is left in charge of his Father's empire. Now had Season 4 started and continued with Chloe dead, Lionel in jail, Lana in Paris then the show would have been having the same forward momentum it was gaining for the previous three seasons & would actually had been considered one of the best shows of its time but sadly the creators wouldn't take more risks as far as characters were concerned, Lana would return, Chloe lived, Lionel somehow escapes prision & takes charge of LuthorCorp again although he was bankcrupt?This is as good as Smallville would get sadly as after this the show would be much of the same but like any copy it would prove to be far inferior to its original predicessor.P.S.Please comment & I will respond as soon as possible.Thank you!",5,Ahhh the good old days.,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1853,"['strange', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'Smallville', 'when', 'think', 'rubbish', 'become', 'Back', 'first', 'three', 'glorious', 'seasons', 'had', 'excellent', 'stories', 'character', 'progression', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'god', 'damn', 'entertaining.Hell', 'even', 'Lana', 'was', 'watchable', 'was', 'because', 'back', 'then', 'Clark/Lana', 'relationship', 'was', 'organically', 'fleshed', 'out', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'season', '1', 'being', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'Season', '2', 'fall', 'love', 'Season', '3', 'try', 'stay', 'together', 'ultimately', 'seemingly', 'fail', 'Now', 'had', 'Lana', 'stayed', 'Paris', 'should', 'have', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Clark/Lana', 'story', 'indeed', 'tragic', 'Season', '4', 'onwards', 'Lana', 'would', 'become', 'mascot', 'creators', 'cease', 'be', 'character', 'more', 'season', '4', 'review.Anyway', 'season', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'especially', 'episode', 'Perry', 'where', 'Clark', 'out', 'down', 'Perry', 'White', 'wow', 'were', 'days', 'Clark', 'was', 'star', 'own', 'show', 'season', 'sensational', 'Covenant', 'where', 'Chloe', 'seemingly', 'Lionel', 'jail', 'death', 'parents', 'Lex', 'left', 'charge', 'Father', 'empire', 'Now', 'had', 'Season', '4', 'started', 'continued', 'Chloe', 'dead', 'Lionel', 'jail', 'Lana', 'Paris', 'then', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'same', 'forward', 'momentum', 'was', 'gaining', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'would', 'actually', 'had', 'been', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'time', 'sadly', 'creators', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'risks', 'as', 'far', 'characters', 'were', 'concerned', 'Lana', 'would', 'return', 'Chloe', 'lived', 'Lionel', 'somehow', 'prision', 'charge', 'LuthorCorp', 'again', 'was', 'bankcrupt', 'as', 'good', 'Smallville', 'would', 'get', 'sadly', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'same', 'copy', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'far', 'inferior', 'original', 'predicessor.P.S.Please', 'comment', 'will', 'respond', 'as', 'soon', 'possible.Thank']",N/A

849997,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B0002Y0QV2,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[2, 2]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe third season of ""Smallville"" captures a new tone for the show, moving more definitively into darker waters creatively than it had previously dared.  The end result is so compelling that the majority of the episodes from this season are among the best in the series.The season premiere ""Exile"" finds Clark on a prolonged exposure to red kryptonite and on a criminal binge in Metropolis.  Tom Welling's portrayal goes beyond the expected cool bad boy cliche, and delivers a truly dangerous Clark Kent, cold and uncaring.  His superpowers only enhance his criminal ability, and a shaken Metropolis police force can only watch as Clark explodes their cruisers with heat vision as their bullets bounce off of his skin.  All of this brings Clark to the attention of Morgan Edge, Metropolis' top crime boss eager to secure Clark's services.  Meanwhile, Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor is stranded on an island after a climactic plane crash which ended the second season.  The writing for this storyline is suspenseful and razor-sharp, setting up an arc for Lex which twines through most of the season and demonstrates why the Lex Luthor of ""Smallville"" is the most versatile iteration of the character in any medium.The show's other cast members receive ample opportunity to shine, particularly Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang in an arc wherein Ms. Lang's head is turned by a young, mysterious patient at Smallville Medical Center, where Lana is recuperating from a horse trampling.  Adam Knight is played very well by Ian Somerhalder, subsequently of ""Lost.""  Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan begins to smooth out, just barely, her quirky edges from the first and second seasons and to mature into the unique form that the character has assumed in Superman canon.  Two episodes from this season which give her a spotlight are ""Exile,"" which foreshadows a later role for her in the series in an ironic way and ""Truth,"" in which the journalist is infected with a serum and discovers the multifaceted, sometimes cutting nature of truth.  Allison Mack is also memorable in ""Perry,"" which introduces an alcoholic Perry White to the show, played wonderfully by Michael McKean.  Mr. McKean is scheduled to return to the series in the 21st episode of the current(ninth) season.The Luthors are taking off their kid gloves, as Lex is more vocal than ever regarding his hatred for his father and the svengali Lionel smoothly lands Lex in a fictional scientific research lab called The Summerholt Institute.  The storyline gives birth to arguably the best episode in the show's run.  ""Memoria"" is a beautiful episode highlighting in different ways the pain and loss of both Lex and Clark's early life.  Underlining the emotional differences between the characters, and heartbreakingly foreshadowing the failure of their friendship, the episode features telltale conversations at its conclusion between Lionel and Lex as well as Martha and Clark that reach to the core of the art of parenting.Also featuring a characteristically solid performance by John Schneider as Johnathan Kent and an eye-catching season-ending appearance by Adrianne Palicki(the television series ""Friday Night Lights""), the third season of ""Smallville"" marks the show's elevation into mature drama.",5,"The third season of ""Smallville"" is the show's very best of its earlier years",1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,3262,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'third', 'season', 'Smallville', 'new', 'tone', 'show', 'moving', 'more', 'definitively', 'darker', 'waters', 'creatively', 'had', 'previously', 'dared', 'end', 'result', 'so', 'compelling', 'majority', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'best', 'series.The', 'season', 'Exile', 'Clark', 'prolonged', 'exposure', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'criminal', 'binge', 'Metropolis', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'portrayal', 'expected', 'cool', 'bad', 'boy', 'cliche', 'truly', 'dangerous', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'superpowers', 'only', 'enhance', 'criminal', 'ability', 'shaken', 'Metropolis', 'police', 'force', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'Clark', 'cruisers', 'heat', 'vision', 'bullets', 'bounce', 'skin', 'Clark', 'attention', 'Morgan', 'Edge', 'Metropolis', 'top', 'crime', 'boss', 'eager', 'secure', 'Clark', 'services', 'Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'stranded', 'island', 'climactic', 'plane', 'crash', 'ended', 'second', 'season', 'writing', 'storyline', 'suspenseful', 'razor-sharp', 'setting', 'up', 'arc', 'Lex', 'most', 'season', 'why', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Smallville', 'most', 'versatile', 'iteration', 'character', 'medium.The', 'show', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'receive', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'particularly', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'arc', 'wherein', 'Ms.', 'Lang', 'head', 'turned', 'young', 'mysterious', 'patient', 'Smallville', 'Medical', 'Center', 'where', 'Lana', 'recuperating', 'horse', 'trampling', 'Adam', 'Knight', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'subsequently', 'Lost', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'smooth', 'out', 'just', 'barely', 'quirky', 'edges', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'mature', 'unique', 'form', 'character', 'assumed', 'Superman', 'canon', 'Two', 'episodes', 'season', 'give', 'spotlight', 'are', 'Exile', 'later', 'role', 'series', 'ironic', 'way', 'Truth', 'journalist', 'infected', 'serum', 'multifaceted', 'sometimes', 'cutting', 'nature', 'truth', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'also', 'memorable', 'Perry', 'alcoholic', 'Perry', 'White', 'show', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Mr.', 'McKean', 'scheduled', 'return', 'series', '21st', 'episode', 'current', 'ninth', 'season.The', 'Luthors', 'are', 'taking', 'off', 'kid', 'gloves', 'Lex', 'more', 'vocal', 'ever', 'regarding', 'hatred', 'father', 'svengali', 'Lionel', 'smoothly', 'Lex', 'fictional', 'scientific', 'research', 'lab', 'called', 'Summerholt', 'Institute', 'storyline', 'birth', 'arguably', 'best', 'episode', 'show', 'run', 'Memoria', 'beautiful', 'episode', 'highlighting', 'different', 'ways', 'pain', 'loss', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'early', 'life', 'Underlining', 'emotional', 'differences', 'characters', 'heartbreakingly', 'foreshadowing', 'failure', 'friendship', 'episode', 'telltale', 'conversations', 'conclusion', 'Lionel', 'Lex', 'as', 'well', 'Martha', 'Clark', 'reach', 'core', 'art', 'parenting.Also', 'featuring', 'characteristically', 'solid', 'performance', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Johnathan', 'Kent', 'eye-catching', 'season-ending', 'appearance', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'television', 'series', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'third', 'season', 'Smallville', 'show', 'elevation', 'mature', 'drama']",N/A

I believe he or she needs to get a life and stop their petty snotty childish opinions who ever wrote that is in need some serious mental help, as for the show, its just entertainment, to some its really good entertainment to others, well lets just say that you have a remote and I assume more than just one channel to watch so do us all a favor and watch something else... maybe you are an ex WB employee with a childish grudge... whatever it is you probably need to get over yourself and seek life elsewhere instead of  smudging the acting talents of a show you don't like, so leave it alone and find a teletubby show to watch since its right along your line of intelligence and is just the right show for you to enjoy... now as for my critique of the show lets just say that for the first couple seasons of the show we never would watch it because we just weren't interested in it, then one day not so long ago we watched it out of boredom and lo and behold we actually liked the show, the same thing happened with Buffy and Angel (which were also WB productions) so the only thing the WB is actually guilty of is making bad judgments about when to take shows off TV well I will admit that Buffy had a good run of 7 years and it was just about time it went into the shadows.. as far as Angel hell they could have gotten another couple years out of that show and we were sorely disappointed to see it go, we just hope that they don't get rid of SmallVille too... now as for our take on the show well it has come to be a show that we greatly enjoy watching we actually bought the first two seasons to catch up on what we missed of the first couple seasons  ( and we have season 3 pre-ordered) and there were a total of 1 or maybe 2 shows we didn't care for as much of the others... but we did enjoy them needless to say. The show has put a new spin on the whole Superman thing which is actually refreshing.. And the actors do a very good job of portraying the characters .. The show is a nice change from some of the other shows on television today, its very wholesome and clean entertainment with just the right amount of action and suspense with the occasional cliffhanger of old. All in all we love watching the show now and will continue to watch the show as long as they continue to produce it thanks WB for another quality and entertaining show to keep our minds  off some of life's other distressing things.... so if you have nothing good to say then keep your mouth shut and don't show you immaturity by defiling a good and entertaining show and one other thing I have to add is that opinions are like ass*oles... everybody has one and some of them just plain stink so don't go away mad just go awayBill & Holly",5,A KIDS REVIEW SEEMS LIKE HES A BIT OFF HIS ROCKER,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2832,"['well', 'first', 'guess', 'KIDS', 'REVIEW', 'seemed', 'little', 'childish', 'lacking', 'real', 'intelligence', 'whatsoever', 'believe', 'get', 'life', 'stop', 'petty', 'snotty', 'childish', 'opinions', 'who', 'ever', 'wrote', 'serious', 'mental', 'help', 'show', 'just', 'entertainment', 'really', 'good', 'entertainment', 'others', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'remote', 'assume', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'channel', 'watch', 'so', 'do', 'all', 'favor', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'maybe', 'are', 'ex', 'WB', 'employee', 'childish', 'grudge', 'probably', 'need', 'get', 'seek', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'instead', 'smudging', 'acting', 'talents', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'leave', 'alone', 'find', 'teletubby', 'show', 'watch', 'right', 'line', 'intelligence', 'just', 'right', 'show', 'enjoy', 'now', 'critique', 'show', 'just', 'say', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'show', 'never', 'would', 'watch', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'interested', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'watched', 'boredom', 'lo', 'behold', 'actually', 'liked', 'show', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'were', 'also', 'WB', 'productions', 'only', 'thing', 'WB', 'actually', 'guilty', 'making', 'bad', 'judgments', 'when', 'take', 'shows', 'off', 'TV', 'well', 'will', 'admit', 'Buffy', 'had', 'good', 'run', '7', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'time', 'went', 'shadows..', 'as', 'far', 'Angel', 'hell', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'couple', 'years', 'show', 'were', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'see', 'go', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'SmallVille', 'too', 'now', 'take', 'show', 'well', 'come', 'be', 'show', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'actually', 'bought', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'have', 'season', '3', 'pre-ordered', 'were', 'total', '1', 'maybe', '2', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'did', 'enjoy', 'needless', 'say', 'show', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'whole', 'Superman', 'thing', 'actually', 'refreshing..', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', '..', 'show', 'nice', 'change', 'other', 'shows', 'television', 'today', 'very', 'wholesome', 'clean', 'entertainment', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'suspense', 'occasional', 'cliffhanger', 'old', 'love', 'watching', 'show', 'now', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'continue', 'produce', 'WB', 'quality', 'entertaining', 'show', 'keep', 'minds', 'life', 'other', 'distressing', 'things', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'say', 'then', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'immaturity', 'defiling', 'good', 'entertaining', 'show', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'have', 'add', 'opinions', 'are', 'ass*oles', 'everybody', 'one', 'just', 'plain', 'stink', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'mad', 'just', 'go', 'awayBill', 'Holly']",N/A

SO GLAD I DID!! I've become completely addicted to this show!! The cast is awesome and they work off each other so well.  Season three ends with a bang and I'm waiting impatiently for four to arrive on my doorstep.  I just cant wait to see how they pick it up.  Tom Welling is just perfect as Clark Kent.

Michael Rosenbloom brings something to the character that I never expected. Being a fan of the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman movies, its just amazing to see what is percieved as the 'beginning' of their friendship. Through out all of the seasons we're treated to little comments that foretell the future: Lex: ""Clark, our friendship is the stuff of legend.""

When this Smallville first came out, I was working at the WB and didn't really care for the shows that we played, so I didn't even give Smallville a chance. Fast forward 2 seasons later and I'm at home with nothing to do, and nothing's on TV, I'm watching ""That 70's Show"" on the WB and I saw a preview for the episode where Clark lets the car run into him to save Lex and Lex finds out his secret, but goes to the Psych ward after the incident.From that moment on I was hooked. I watched it at any point I could, I bought the first season. I'm still catching up on what I missed, but I definitely would have to say that this season is the best. One of the things that really makes this show is the conflict between Clark and Lex and Lionel. Of course Lex and Clark are friends, but we really start to see the strains of their friendship in this season as they will end up bitter enemies later on in life. We also get the opportunity to see where Lex comes from by seeing his ego-maniacal father.The actors in this are brilliant. Tom Welling wasn't the best actor when this first started, but he's definitely gotten a lot better since the Red Kryptonite episodes in the second season. Michael Rosenbaum is awesome, and definitely deserves a lot more respect. He does a great job of demonstrating the ambiguity of Lex Luther as he stays Clark's friend but yet investigates him behind his back. Kristin Kreuk does a great job as the tormented girl who loves Clark but feels betrayed by the his secrets as she hides her pain from him.Everyone should check this out, borrow it from your friend if you have to but it definitely rocks. Even if you don't like comic books you might find this show interesting, trust me.",5,One of the best shows on TV today!!!,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,1772,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'episode', 'names', 'so', 'please', 'forgive', 'When', 'Smallville', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'working', 'WB', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'shows', 'played', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'Smallville', 'chance', 'Fast', 'forward', '2', 'seasons', 'later', ""'m"", 'home', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'TV', ""'m"", 'watching', '70', 'Show', 'WB', 'saw', 'preview', 'episode', 'where', 'Clark', 'car', 'run', 'save', 'Lex', 'Lex', 'out', 'secret', 'Psych', 'ward', 'incident.From', 'moment', 'was', 'hooked', 'watched', 'point', 'could', 'bought', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'still', 'catching', 'up', 'what', 'missed', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'best', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'show', 'conflict', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'course', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'are', 'friends', 'really', 'start', 'see', 'strains', 'friendship', 'season', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'later', 'life', 'also', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'where', 'Lex', 'seeing', 'ego-maniacal', 'father.The', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'actor', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'definitely', 'gotten', 'lot', 'better', 'Red', 'Kryptonite', 'second', 'season', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'awesome', 'definitely', 'lot', 'more', 'respect', 'great', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'ambiguity', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Clark', 'friend', 'yet', 'back', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'great', 'job', 'tormented', 'girl', 'who', 'Clark', 'feels', 'betrayed', 'secrets', 'pain', 'him.Everyone', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'borrow', 'friend', 'have', 'definitely', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comic', 'books', 'might', 'find', 'show', 'interesting', 'trust']",N/A

That being said, the third season of ""Smallville"" is my absolute favorite. The acting was stupendous, the main story arcs were complete and enthralling, and the vast majority of the episodes were either excellent or superior. The three actors who give the best performances this season are Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, and John Glover as Lionel Luthor. These three actors really drive the emotional arcs of the season. Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk,) Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack,) Pete Ross (Sam Jones III,) Martha (Annette O'Toole,) and Johnathan Kent (John Schneider) perform admirably as well. This season also contains my favorite episode of ""Smallville"": ""Memoria."" This is a truly excellent episode that features superior performances from Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, John Glover, and Annette O'Toole. This is flat-out the best episode of the series. Other memorable episodes include: ""Exile,"" ""Phoenix,"" ""Extinction,"" ""Slumber,"" ""Perry,"" ""Relic,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Asylum,"" ""Delete,"" ""Obsession,"" ""Crisis,"" ""Truth,"" and ""Covenant."" (6/5)Video: The third season of ""Smallville"" sports a fantastic 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. Simply put, the transfer is amazing. Color, sharpness, and detail are all excellent. (5/5)Audio: The Dolby 2.0 Surround track is excellent. In Pro Logic II, it sounds exactly like a full 5.1 mix. Its that good. (4/5)Extras: ""Exile"" features a commentary by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. ""Memoria"" has a commentary by Michael Rosenbaum and the series producers. ""Truth"" features a commentary by Allison Mack, John Glover, and the producers. All three commentaries are excellent and fun to listen to.There is also a fun gag reel, ""The Chloe Chronicles"" web-isodes, deleted scenes, and an excellent 25-minute documentary ""Producing Smallville: The Heroes Behind The Camera.""All in all these extras are fun and definately worth a look. (4/5)Overall: Warner Brothers has released another excellent season set of ""Smallville."" Warner Brothers definately sets the DVD benchmark very high, and proves once again why they are the best DVD studio around. Superior show, excellent DVD. Don't hesitate to buy this.

850005,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0002Y0QV2,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[14, 18]","Season 3 I think is the best one actually. The most happens I think, so much that it's hard to go through it all. First it starts off where season 3 left off. Clarke is in Metropolis and is causing havoc because he's wearing a red Kryptonite ring. Which of course makes him selfish and not care about other people. Jonathon Kent makes a deal with Jor-El and is given powers for a limited time so he can get Clarke back. Clarke and his mom don't actually find out what that deal was until towards the end of this season.Also Lex returns after being left for dead by his new wife on a deserted island. He starts going insane though due to his dad drugging him. Lex uncovered that Lionel had his parents killed so Lionel wants Lex's memories erased. Lex uncovers Clarke's secret.  Erasing his memory could leave Lex in vegatable state. Clarke doesn't want that although his secret is on the line and can he trust Lex to keep it anyway ? Also Lana makes the mistake of becoming friends with a dangerous man named Adam who she even let move in at her coffee house. Chloe also has to figure out how to get out of her mistake of ever deciding to work with Lionel Luther. Pete is getting hurt due to knowing Clarke's secret and has to figure out if he can handle it anymore. On top of things Clarke may lose Lana because she wants to move away from Smallville.This season gets away from the villain of the week thing just a little like season 2 did.  Although is an episode where a bunch of villains of the week from season 1, 2 and 3 decide to team up at the mental hospital and get revenge on Clarke. That episode is pretty cool though. Also is one where Clarke is being hunted by a guy who kills meteor shower freaks  and thinks Clarke is one of them. So he hunts him down with Kryptonite bullets. Also is an episode where Clarke is stalked by a dangerous hotty with teleporter powers. Is one where Clarke gets blinded and has to l learn how to just focus on hearing everything around him.

850007,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0002Y0QV2,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[1, 1]","Since the start of the show, Smallville has been one of my favorite shows on television. The teenage adventures of a pre-Superman Clark Kent, as he learns of his abilities, his origins and how they affect those people whom he loves, make for great stories. Season three was another top-notch season from the cast and crew and they got a great DVD release to back that up.Season three begins with Clark, high on red kryptonite, living and causing mayhem in Metropolis. He gets mixed up with crime boss Morgan Edge and it takes a deal with Clark's biological father Jor-El, for Jonathan Kent to bring him back to Smallville and those who love him.From that starting point, the season takes a great number of twists and turns, with every character seeing his or her life change throughout the course of the 22 episodes.Tom Welling is fantastic as Clark Kent. He plays the perfect farm boy very well, but it is in the scenes where the red kryptonite takes over his body, that Welling truly gets to shine. In this season he contemplates telling the love of his life, Lana Lang, about his secret, has to save all those who are closest to him and eventually, as the season closes, gives in to his destiny and heads to Jor-El's calling.As Lana Lang, Kristin Kreuk shines. She knows Clark is hiding something from her, and that keeps the potential that is there for a relationship between the two, on the back burner. She truly loves Clark, and he has the same feelings to her, but with the secrets he is hiding, the risk is too great. She finally decides to leave Smallville to study art in Paris.In my mind, the star of the show is Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor. Nowhere does that star shine brighter than in season three. As season two ended, Lex was supposedly plummeting to his death in an aircraft. After months on a desert island, he returns home and is quickly labeled as a nutcase. His ramblings throughout the season get him put in a mental institution by his own father, and force him to try drastic measures to try and get back the memories that his father erased during his institutional stay. Rosenbaum does a great job making this character someone who, though we know will eventually turn to evil, at this point is still a friend to Clark and Lana.As Lionel Luthor, John Glover also is great. He completely reaks of evil from every ounce of his body, but at the same time, you know that he loves his son. Unfortunately for Lionel, his love of money and power sometimes, or oftentimes takes precadent over everything. He uses everything and everybody to try to exact out his revenge and plays a key role in the season finale.Sam Jones III stars as Clark's best friend Pete Ross. This season marked the end of Pete's run on the show, as he grew tired of carrying the burden of Clark's secret and moved with his mom to Wichita. In this season, he went through a lot, as he was illegal streetracing, got kidnapped and beat up by FBI agents.Allison Mack portrays budding journalist Chloe Sullivan, a friend of Clark, Lana and Pete. Her nose for news often takes charge in situations, making for tough friendships. She is secretly (or somewhat not secretly) in love with Clark, but doesn't let those feelings show. She particularly shines in the episode where she gives off a truth telling pheremone.Annette O'Toole and John Schneider are great as Martha and Jonathan Kent, Clark's steadying hand in the life that he is living. They constantly provide wisdom and advice and Jonathan even saves the life of his son a couple of times thanks to his deal with Jor-El.This season was a great one for Smallville. The DVD release features three commentary tracks, a behind-the-scenes look at the producers and crew, a gag reel, many deleted scenes and the second chapter of Chloe's Chronicles, a web series starring Allison Mack.The season finale for season three was one of the best I have seen in my many years of watching television, It left the viewer with so many questions, and even though I know how those questions got answered in the start of season four, I was still mesmerized by the powerful ending.Plus, in Mack and Kreuk, this show features two of the most beautiful women on television.",5,Somebody save me. . .,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,4197,"['start', 'show', 'Smallville', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'television', 'teenage', 'adventures', 'pre-Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'abilities', 'origins', 'how', 'affect', 'people', 'whom', 'make', 'great', 'stories', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'top-notch', 'season', 'cast', 'crew', 'got', 'great', 'DVD', 'release', 'back', 'up.Season', 'three', 'begins', 'Clark', 'high', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'living', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'Metropolis', 'mixed', 'up', 'crime', 'boss', 'Morgan', 'Edge', 'deal', 'Clark', 'biological', 'father', 'Jor-El', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'bring', 'back', 'Smallville', 'who', 'love', 'him.From', 'starting', 'point', 'season', 'great', 'number', 'twists', 'turns', 'character', 'seeing', 'life', 'change', 'course', '22', 'episodes.Tom', 'Welling', 'fantastic', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'perfect', 'farm', 'boy', 'very', 'well', 'scenes', 'where', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'body', 'Welling', 'truly', 'shine', 'season', 'telling', 'love', 'life', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'secret', 'save', 'who', 'are', 'closest', 'eventually', 'season', 'destiny', 'heads', 'Jor-El', 'calling.As', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'shines', 'Clark', 'hiding', 'something', 'potential', 'there', 'relationship', 'two', 'back', 'burner', 'truly', 'loves', 'Clark', 'same', 'feelings', 'secrets', 'hiding', 'risk', 'too', 'great', 'finally', 'leave', 'Smallville', 'study', 'art', 'Paris.In', 'mind', 'star', 'show', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Nowhere', 'star', 'shine', 'brighter', 'season', 'three', 'season', 'two', 'ended', 'Lex', 'was', 'supposedly', 'plummeting', 'death', 'aircraft', 'months', 'desert', 'island', 'home', 'quickly', 'labeled', 'nutcase', 'ramblings', 'season', 'get', 'put', 'mental', 'institution', 'own', 'father', 'force', 'try', 'drastic', 'measures', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'memories', 'father', 'erased', 'institutional', 'stay', 'Rosenbaum', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'turn', 'evil', 'point', 'still', 'friend', 'Clark', 'Lana.As', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'John', 'Glover', 'also', 'great', 'completely', 'evil', 'ounce', 'body', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'son', 'Unfortunately', 'Lionel', 'love', 'money', 'power', 'sometimes', 'oftentimes', 'precadent', 'everything', 'everything', 'everybody', 'try', 'exact', 'out', 'revenge', 'key', 'role', 'season', 'finale.Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'Clark', 'best', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'season', 'marked', 'end', 'Pete', 'run', 'show', 'grew', 'tired', 'carrying', 'burden', 'Clark', 'secret', 'moved', 'mom', 'Wichita', 'season', 'went', 'lot', 'was', 'illegal', 'streetracing', 'got', 'kidnapped', 'beat', 'up', 'FBI', 'agents.Allison', 'Mack', 'budding', 'journalist', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'friend', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'Pete', 'nose', 'news', 'often', 'charge', 'situations', 'making', 'tough', 'friendships', 'secretly', 'somewhat', 'not', 'secretly', 'love', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'let', 'feelings', 'show', 'particularly', 'shines', 'episode', 'where', 'truth', 'telling', 'pheremone.Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'John', 'Schneider', 'are', 'great', 'Martha', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'Clark', 'steadying', 'hand', 'life', 'living', 'constantly', 'provide', 'wisdom', 'advice', 'Jonathan', 'even', 'life', 'son', 'couple', 'times', 'thanks', 'deal', 'Jor-El.This', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'Smallville', 'DVD', 'release', 'features', 'three', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'producers', 'crew', 'gag', 'reel', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'second', 'chapter', 'Chloe', 'Chronicles', 'web', 'series', 'starring', 'Allison', 'Mack.The', 'season', 'finale', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'watching', 'television', 'left', 'viewer', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'questions', 'got', 'answered', 'start', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'still', 'mesmerized', 'powerful', 'ending.Plus', 'Mack', 'Kreuk', 'show', 'two', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'television']",N/A

As season 3 opens all of this is answered mostly within the first 2 episodes.  There are a few of the cliffhangers that are left dangling for half of the season, but eventually get resolved.

Clark gets a new power this season, super-hearing, while not one of his more impressive powers the writers handled this power's emergence in an interesting way, and seeing Clark practice how to hone his new ability was really cool to see.  Clark's time with Red K has left him with a slight edge that is shown throughout the season where we see that Clark is a little darker than he used to be, a trait which he really needs to become Superman, whenever someone close to him is threatened you see this darker, more aggressive side emerge, and still remained controlled, which is very nice.  This season the rift begins between Clark and Lex, and carries over into season 4, no longer are these two friends going to just accept bold-faced lies without challenging, now a majority of their scenes are slightly tense and antagonistic.  Lionel is as devious and evil as ever, but every action does have repercussions which Lionel will learn from Lex.  We see one of the regular cast members leave the show, though this member though a regular was rarely featured.  A special guest appearance by Perry White, makes for an interesting episode.  Jor-El tries harder and harder to bring Clark to his side, and who is it that has made a pact with Jor-El in order to facilitate Clark joining him.  Those are just some of the events from season 3 to look forward to.The acting in this show as I've said in my reviews for seasons 1-2, just keeps getting better and better.  This season Michael Rosenbaum really shines in two excellent episodes in the middle of the season.  The entire cast is getting better and better with each episode that passes.Overall, this season was very good, it was darker than the previous seasons which was a nice direction to take and the mythology was explored deeper.  The set-up for season 4 is amazing with a nice homage to the Godfather.  Enjoy this new season of 'Smallville'.",5,"The Hero Returns, But Is He the Same...",1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,3151,"['are', 'even', 'looking', 'review', 'then', 'are', 'familiar', 'show', 'transpired', 'past', '2', 'seasons', 'may', 'have', 'watched', 'season', 'live', 'WB', 'are', 'just', 'buying', 'bought', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'figured', 'one', ""n't"", 'big', 'gamble', 'watched', 'season', 'unfold', 'tv', 'already', 'can', 'bypass', 'next', '2', 'paragraphs', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'stick', 'around', 'little', 'head', 'up', 'what', 'expect', 'Smallville', 'Season', '3', '.When', 'season', '2', 'ended', 'were', 'several', 'plot', 'lines', 'left', 'open', 'what', 'will', 'Clark', 'do', 'Metropolis', 'influence', 'Red', 'K', 'will', 'Lana', 'chase', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Lex', 'know', 'Lex', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'series', 'due', 'being', 'Superman', 'most', 'popular', 'villain', 'suspense', 'still', 'palpable', 'course', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'Chloe', 'deal', 'proverbial', 'Devil', 'known', 'Lionel', 'go', 'season', '3', 'answered', 'mostly', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'few', 'cliffhangers', 'are', 'left', 'dangling', 'half', 'season', 'eventually', 'get', 'resolved', 'always', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'detail', 'ruin', 'potential', 'surprises', 'new', 'season', 'will', 'however', 'tell', 'highlights', 'look', 'forward', 'Clark', 'new', 'power', 'season', 'super-hearing', 'not', 'one', 'more', 'impressive', 'powers', 'writers', 'handled', 'power', 'emergence', 'interesting', 'way', 'seeing', 'Clark', 'practice', 'how', 'hone', 'new', 'ability', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'Clark', 'time', 'Red', 'K', 'left', 'slight', 'edge', 'shown', 'season', 'where', 'see', 'Clark', 'little', 'darker', 'used', 'be', 'trait', 'really', 'become', 'Superman', 'whenever', 'someone', 'close', 'threatened', 'see', 'darker', 'more', 'aggressive', 'side', 'emerge', 'still', 'remained', 'controlled', 'very', 'nice', 'season', 'rift', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'over', 'season', '4', 'no', 'longer', 'are', 'two', 'friends', 'going', 'just', 'accept', 'bold-faced', 'lies', 'challenging', 'now', 'majority', 'scenes', 'are', 'slightly', 'tense', 'antagonistic', 'Lionel', 'as', 'devious', 'evil', 'ever', 'action', 'have', 'repercussions', 'Lionel', 'will', 'learn', 'Lex', 'see', 'one', 'regular', 'cast', 'members', 'leave', 'show', 'member', 'regular', 'was', 'rarely', 'featured', 'special', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Perry', 'White', 'interesting', 'episode', 'Jor-El', 'tries', 'harder', 'harder', 'bring', 'Clark', 'side', 'who', 'made', 'pact', 'Jor-El', 'order', 'facilitate', 'Clark', 'joining', 'are', 'just', 'events', 'season', '3', 'look', 'forward', 'to.The', 'acting', 'show', ""'ve"", 'said', 'reviews', 'seasons', '1-2', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'really', 'two', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'middle', 'season', 'entire', 'cast', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'episode', 'passes.Overall', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'darker', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'nice', 'direction', 'take', 'mythology', 'was', 'explored', 'deeper', 'set-up', 'season', '4', 'amazing', 'nice', 'homage', 'Godfather', 'Enjoy', 'new', 'season', ""'Smallville""]",N/A

I recorded all the episodes on TIVO, but have to have the DVD collection, too so I can hear the commentaries and special features.  I especially loved hearing about the director's commentaries in this DVD for 2 episodes.  You also get to hear the colorful commentaries from Michael Rosenblum (who plays Lex) and Allison Mack (who plays Chloe).  There are a lot more deleted scenes to see in this DVD than in Season 2 and 1.  Disappointing to not hear from Tom Welling or Kristin Kreuk (my absolutely favorite actor) in this DVD.  But, and I say, but, there are a lot of commentary by Michael, Allison, and the directors about Tom and Kristin, especially wonderful things to hear about Kristin.  There is a particularly long segment on the Chloe Chronicles, which had a particularly long and confusing (almost boring) sequence completely in silence and as a comic book.  This part did not make sense at all, and seemed corny.  Not as well-done as in Season 2 (with the segment on special effects a real treat), but if you're a Smallville fan, this is a must-have in your personal library.",4,Smallville Junkie,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,1215,"['Smallville', '3rd', 'Season', 'full', 'ups', 'downs', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'terms', 'emotional', 'challenges', 'recorded', 'episodes', 'TIVO', 'have', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'too', 'so', 'can', 'hear', 'commentaries', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'loved', 'hearing', 'director', 'commentaries', 'DVD', '2', 'episodes', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'colorful', 'commentaries', 'Michael', 'Rosenblum', 'who', 'Lex', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'who', 'Chloe', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'see', 'DVD', 'Season', '2', '1', 'Disappointing', 'not', 'hear', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'actor', 'DVD', 'say', 'are', 'lot', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Allison', 'directors', 'Tom', 'Kristin', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'things', 'hear', 'Kristin', 'particularly', 'long', 'segment', 'Chloe', 'Chronicles', 'had', 'particularly', 'long', 'confusing', 'almost', 'boring', 'sequence', 'completely', 'silence', 'comic', 'book', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'seemed', 'corny', 'Not', 'as', 'well-done', 'Season', '2', 'segment', 'special', 'effects', 'real', 'treat', ""'re"", 'Smallville', 'fan', 'must-have', 'personal', 'library']",N/A
850013,A2S9P70216QC2H,B0002Y0QV2,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[2, 2]","Season Review-3 months later...Clark still own on the influence of red kryptonite and is wrecking havoc in Metropolis as Kal, Lex has pronounced dead, and The Kents are worried sick about Clark's whereabouts as well as his friends. These are the events that jump starts Smallville's electrifying third season. Beginning with probably it's best premiere to date, ""Exile"" is an emotional, action-packed episode that sets up the season perfectly as character make some desperate decisions to bring Clark home, the most dramatic being Jonathan Kent's. Unlike the glimmer of hope theme of the first 2 seasons, Season 3 is significantly darker, or should I say, the darkest season of the series. After all, Season 3 was about the harsh reality of Clark dealing with the consequences of his actions after ""Exodus"" and ""Exile"", which you could obviously see it wouldn't be easy for the character. Tom Welling matures so well as Clark Kent himself matures throughout the season learning from his mistakes. Kristin Kreuk is good as usual as Lana Lang, especially as Lana has to deal with the fallout of her first (of many!) break-up with Clark. The two try to remain friends, but it's obvious that their romantic feelings will get in the way. Allison Mack as Chloe is also good as she continues her minor storyline from Season 2 as Lionel's own personal investigative reporter with he wants to know the secret of Clark Kent. Sam Jones III's Pete Ross is once again underused, underwritten, and unnecessary for the whole season. It's no wonder that the character was finally written out of the series by season end. Annette 'O Toole remains an amazing asset as Martha Kent but it's Schneider's Jonathan Kent that has to deal with the mysterious deal he made with Jor-El at the beginning of the season, one that with cost his family...and even his life in the near future.Now we all know Smallville is about Clark's journey toward becoming Superman, it's also about Lex Luthor's journey toward becoming Superman's greatest villain. The first 2 seasons we saw very little hints of Lex's dark side, but Season 3 is where the writers begin to explore the dark world of Luthor family, as well as getting into the psyche of Lex Luthor. The writers really outdid themselves with the storyline of Lex's descent into madness. Not only that, but it gives a chance to show just how immensely talent Michael Rosenbaum is. ""Shattered"" is one of the most gripping hours from Smallville that involves Lex slowly loses his mind and Micheal Rosenbaum's performance is truly stunning. John Glover is also a tremendous talent portraying Lionel as his cruelest yet when Lionel puts Lex through some harsh situation throughout this season. Another classic episode involving the Luthors is ""Memoria"", as we see how Lionel and Lex's rivalry began as well as other revelations about Clark's origins.Other Season 3 highlights are ""Phoenix"" an explosive conclusion to the premiere, Perry White aka Clark's future boss makes a unforgettable, hilarious appearance in ""Perry"", ""Relic"" reveals the reason why Clark was sent to the Kents, ""Asylum"" is possibly the darkest episode of the series and ""Covenant"" is one of Smallville's most ambitious finales when a young blonde girl named Kara arrives at Clark's doorstep. Could she truly be the one and only Supergirl? You'll have to find out! Lana also gets a disturbing storyline when she meets Adam Knight, a handsome young man whose mysterious past seems similar to a certain caped crusader! Ending the season off with a powerful sequence of shocking cliffhangers, Season 3 is easily the finest season of the series as storyline go far beyond the mythos of Superman and gives the series a wonderful edge. Even the season's weakest efforts like ""Magnetic"", ""Velocity"" and the surprisingly disappointing return of Christopher Reeves in ""Legacy"", can't take away from the fact that the character development, acting, storylines and overall quality of the series peaked here which is a shame since it would never regain its focus after this season.Season Rating: 9.5/10Video and Audio Review-I have to say while watching the first episode of the season; I could tell that the show looked a hell of a lot nicer than the first 2 seasons. The colors seemed clearer and more vivid. The audio is also much more toned and fuller.Video and Audio Rating: 8.5/10Extras:With each season box set, the extras just seem to get better. There 3 commentaries for ""Exile"", ""Memoria"" and ""Truth"". Part 2 of the Chloe Chronicles are featured and are fun. There are over a dozen deleted scenes from individual episodes, a gag reel, and a DVD rom. But the best of the bunch is the Hero behind the Cameras which is a great behind the scenes look of the cast and crew working on the show. I even hear there's a hidden Easter egg extra with Michael Rosenbaum, wonder if I'll ever find it!Extras Rating: 8/10Overall Score: 8.5/10",5,The Insanity of Lex Luthor-Smallville's Complete Third

850018,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B0002Y0QV2,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[5, 6]","A well-produced box set. Much has been written about the details of what is on these shows.I'd like to add that the characters of Clark and Chloe particularly continue to mature, and the relationship between Lex and Luther have been extremely well written and acted. This show has a depth of scripting that has remained really interesting.There is unfortunately little chemistry between Clark and Lana (in fact Lex looks warmer to Lana!) and the romance drifts between Clark and females generally after some interesting teases. When Clark goes feral wearing with his red kryptonite he shows he can interact with women with a lot more warmth and passion so it's definitely in there.Tom is growing into an even more striking man (very well cast) and is now looking too mature and older much of the time to be the same age as some of the co-stars. They may have to move him out of school soon as it may soon push credulity. Having said that, we hope this series continues for some time to come as it is both more engaging and imaginative than so many other series available.There are more excursions to the caves with interesting stories that allow for the special effects that can make this show magic.The duller moments come from the usual excesses of kryptonite which seem to lie deep around Smallville creating a certain repetitiousness of plots. We lose a regular character in this series (I wont do a spoiler in case you havent seen it!) but the presence of this character wasn't very engaging so perhaps that's why they reconsidered.The appearance of Christopher Reeves in several episodes is a wonderful touch and he acts well even from the confines of his wheel chair. With his death since this will make this an important series for keen fans to have as it weaves the movie and series through his presence (and the voice of Terrence Stamp who played a nasty in one of the Movies).They have some extras included. The one that you may have to think about watching is the gag real. We had a huge amount of respect for Michael Rosenbaum (Lex) as an actor as he does an incredibly good job consistently. His clowning and attention- seeking in the gag real was quite off-putting (perhaps that shows he really is good at acting). He sort of popped the illusion and we are now going to have to work hard to forget that side of him and suspend reality by the time we see the next series (not shown in our country yet or available)",4,Enduring interest and entertainment,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2428,"['well-produced', 'box', 'set', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'details', 'what', 'shows.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'characters', 'Clark', 'Chloe', 'particularly', 'continue', 'mature', 'relationship', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'show', 'depth', 'scripting', 'remained', 'really', 'interesting.There', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'fact', 'Lex', 'warmer', 'Lana', 'romance', 'drifts', 'Clark', 'females', 'generally', 'interesting', 'teases', 'When', 'Clark', 'feral', 'wearing', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'can', 'interact', 'women', 'lot', 'more', 'warmth', 'passion', 'definitely', 'there.Tom', 'growing', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'man', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'now', 'looking', 'too', 'mature', 'older', 'much', 'time', 'be', 'same', 'age', 'co-stars', 'may', 'have', 'move', 'school', 'soon', 'may', 'soon', 'push', 'credulity', 'Having', 'said', 'hope', 'series', 'time', 'come', 'more', 'engaging', 'imaginative', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'are', 'more', 'excursions', 'caves', 'interesting', 'stories', 'allow', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'make', 'show', 'duller', 'moments', 'come', 'usual', 'excesses', 'kryptonite', 'seem', 'lie', 'deep', 'Smallville', 'creating', 'certain', 'repetitiousness', 'plots', 'lose', 'regular', 'character', 'series', 'wont', 'do', 'spoiler', 'case', 'havent', 'seen', 'presence', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'engaging', 'so', 'perhaps', 'why', 'reconsidered.The', 'appearance', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'several', 'episodes', 'wonderful', 'touch', 'well', 'even', 'confines', 'wheel', 'chair', 'death', 'will', 'make', 'important', 'series', 'keen', 'fans', 'have', 'movie', 'series', 'presence', 'voice', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'played', 'nasty', 'one', 'Movies', 'have', 'extras', 'included', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'think', 'watching', 'gag', 'real', 'had', 'huge', 'amount', 'respect', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'actor', 'incredibly', 'good', 'job', 'consistently', 'clowning', 'attention-', 'seeking', 'gag', 'real', 'was', 'quite', 'off-putting', 'perhaps', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'sort', 'popped', 'illusion', 'are', 'now', 'going', 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'forget', 'side', 'suspend', 'reality', 'time', 'see', 'next', 'series', 'not', 'shown', 'country', 'yet', 'available']",N/A

There are even darker and more violent scenarios, as Lionel and Clark continue to play an increasingly dangerous game of cat and mouse. Lex's life also takes several dangerous turns, and Lionel finally gets his comeuppance in a sense, although the season ends before we see if justice will prevail in the end or not.

The episodes areExilePhoenixExpansionSlumberPerry1961MagneticShatteredAsylumWhisperDeleteHereafterVelocityObsessionRessurectionCrisisLegacyTruthMemoriaTalismanForsakenCovenantThere were a lot of new ideas brought in on this Season. Clark gets some new powers like his super hearing ability after he goes deaf for a short time. His secret becomes knowledge to a couple of new bad guys this season. A girl with the ability to teleport finds out his secret and goes Fatal Attraction on him. He is shot by a Kryptonite bullet. He fights a couple of villians from season 1,2, and 3 who team up against Clark.His relationship with Lana isn't that great throughout the whole season. She is hurt in an accident where is leg is broken and she tells Clark to leave her alone because all she does is hurt him. Another guy comes into the picture named Adam. Lana wants to be with Clark as does him with her, but the two don't trust each other and they end up growing apart by the end of the year.Life with Chloe isn't to great either. She is stuck with Lionel investigating Clark and wants out, but wants the answer to his secrets. She gains the ability to make people tell her the truth and Lionel goes to war against her.Clark also finds out more about his father in a great flashback episode in 1961. He learns a lot more about his biological father Jor-El throught the whole season including fantastic Godfather like finale in the last episode.They mess with Lex Luthor a lot. He returns home from the attempted murder from his ex fiance. He goes to a mental institution and his dad fries some of his memories. He finally gets to see Clark and action, but loses the memories. They twist the character real well and we get to see Lex slip further and further into becoming the evil man that he will eventually become.I liked this season a lot.

850027,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0002Y0QV2,Mitch Weaver,"[19, 19]","Before I watched Smallville, I assumed there was no way for a WB made show to compete with the other aspects of the Superman franchise. Doubting Smallville was probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. In my opinion, it is the best show on TV right now, and one of the best that I have ever seen. The reason the show works, is because it takes an interesting look at the legend of Superman. You bare witness to the human side of the character - Clark Kent, growing up as a teenager in Smallville Kansas. Clark must adjust to his different powers, the relationship between Lex Luthor and Clark develops, and you see the classic relationship ensue between Clark and Lana Lang, who are destined to be just friends.The thing that has impressed me the most about the show, is that has gotten better with each passing season. Going into season three, I had no idea how good it would turn out to be, but by the end of the season I was blown away. Now for some reason, a lot of the fans thought that season three was the worst one so far. I don't understand why this season was not appreciated more. In my opinion, it is without a doubt the best season of the entire show. Season three was also the darkest season as well, which is what gave the season such appeal in my opinion. Season three had everything from Clark robbing a bank, Lex ending up in a looney bin, and Lionel ending up on death row, to Chloe being supposedly dead and Pete leaving Smallville for good. The episodes in season three were compelling, as well as the storylines. Perhaps the most suprising turn of events to come out of season three was the fact that Clark declared his friendship with Lex over. The show is finally starting to get closer to the true destinies of the characters.The entire season was great from start to finish, and there were only two episodes that I did not care for. I thought I would take the time to mention some of the great episodes from season three. My favorite episode of season three and of the entire show is ""Covenant"" in which a girl named Kara comes to Smallville and she claims to be from Krypton. The last ten minutes will blow you away. ""Exile"" has Clark in Metropolis under the influence of Red Kryptonite comitting crimes and acting out. ""Shattered"" is a brilliant mystery episode that has Lex, and everyone around him questioning his mental health. ""Asylum"" is the thrilling conclusion to Shattered in which we are shown what life is like for Lex inside the mental institution, and three former ""freaks of the week"" return who want to gain revenge on Clark. ""Memoria"" which is probably one of the most beautiful episodes I have ever seen has Lex turning to radical techniques to regain the memories that were stolen from him in Shattered. The episode shows flashbacks into Lex's life, and we also see Clark's first childhood memory involving his real parents on Krypton. ""Legacy"" marks the return of Christopher Reeve to the show. ""Truth"" has Chloe inhale a Kryptonite induced truth syrum, that gives her the ability to make everyone around her tell the truth. ""Perry"" marks the introduction of future Daily Planet editor Perry White when he is brought to Smallville to investigate the effects of the meteor shower. His interests soon turn towards Clark Kent and what he can do. ""Whisper"" is the power episode of season three in which Clark temporarily loses his sight and develops super hearing.As you can see, season three was an incredible season. However, the episodes are not the only reason for buying this set. The extras are great. You get commentary on ""Exile"", ""Memoria"", and ""Truth"", as well as deleted scenes, a gag reel, and the second installment of the Chloe Chronicles.A solid 5 stars...",5,The best season of the show,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,3726,"['watched', 'Smallville', 'assumed', 'was', 'way', 'WB', 'made', 'show', 'compete', 'other', 'aspects', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'Doubting', 'Smallville', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'opinion', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'reason', 'show', 'interesting', 'look', 'legend', 'Superman', 'bare', 'witness', 'human', 'side', 'character', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'growing', 'up', 'teenager', 'Smallville', 'Kansas', 'Clark', 'must', 'adjust', 'different', 'powers', 'relationship', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Clark', 'develops', 'see', 'classic', 'relationship', 'ensue', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'just', 'friends.The', 'thing', 'impressed', 'most', 'show', 'gotten', 'better', 'passing', 'season', 'Going', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'good', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Now', 'reason', 'lot', 'fans', 'thought', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'worst', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'appreciated', 'more', 'opinion', 'doubt', 'best', 'season', 'entire', 'show', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'also', 'darkest', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'gave', 'season', 'such', 'appeal', 'opinion', 'Season', 'three', 'had', 'everything', 'Clark', 'robbing', 'bank', 'Lex', 'ending', 'up', 'looney', 'bin', 'Lionel', 'ending', 'up', 'death', 'row', 'Chloe', 'being', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'Pete', 'leaving', 'Smallville', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'were', 'compelling', 'as', 'well', 'storylines', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'suprising', 'turn', 'events', 'come', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'fact', 'Clark', 'declared', 'friendship', 'Lex', 'show', 'finally', 'starting', 'get', 'closer', 'true', 'destinies', 'characters.The', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'start', 'finish', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'mention', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'three', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'three', 'entire', 'show', 'Covenant', 'girl', 'named', 'Kara', 'Smallville', 'be', 'Krypton', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Exile', 'Clark', 'Metropolis', 'influence', 'Red', 'Kryptonite', 'comitting', 'crimes', 'acting', 'out', 'Shattered', 'brilliant', 'mystery', 'episode', 'Lex', 'everyone', 'questioning', 'mental', 'health', 'Asylum', 'thrilling', 'conclusion', 'Shattered', 'are', 'shown', 'what', 'life', 'Lex', 'mental', 'institution', 'three', 'former', 'freaks', 'week', 'return', 'who', 'want', 'gain', 'revenge', 'Clark', 'Memoria', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'episodes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Lex', 'turning', 'radical', 'techniques', 'regain', 'memories', 'were', 'stolen', 'Shattered', 'episode', 'flashbacks', 'Lex', 'life', 'also', 'see', 'Clark', 'first', 'childhood', 'memory', 'involving', 'real', 'parents', 'Krypton', 'Legacy', 'return', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'show', 'Truth', 'Chloe', 'inhale', 'Kryptonite', 'induced', 'truth', 'syrum', 'ability', 'make', 'everyone', 'tell', 'truth', 'Perry', 'introduction', 'future', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'editor', 'Perry', 'White', 'when', 'brought', 'Smallville', 'investigate', 'effects', 'meteor', 'shower', 'interests', 'soon', 'turn', 'towards', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Whisper', 'power', 'episode', 'season', 'three', 'Clark', 'temporarily', 'sight', 'super', 'hearing.As', 'can', 'see', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'incredible', 'season', 'However', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'buying', 'set', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'get', 'commentary', 'Exile', 'Memoria', 'Truth', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'second', 'installment', 'Chloe', 'Chronicles.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

The storyline came together in a very intense and obviously well thought out manner, reminiscent of 24 Season 1 just because it was intricately planned out from the beginning.There were some humorous stand-alone episodes (""Perry"" for example) but the bulk of the show's worth came from sequential story-arcs that progressed throughout the season.  The biggest downfall of this season, in my opinion, is by far the fact that for viewers new to the show, if they missed Seasons 1 and 2, they would be extremely lost in the events that transpired during this season.  Also, if you missed this season, then the current season 4 is probably crazy as hell!

850030,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0002Y0QV2,Newton Ooi,"[1, 1]","For those who say there is nothing good on TV, I suggest they watch this show.  Starting in the fall 2001, this show has lasted to an upcoming 7th season, one of the longest lasting shows in a decade of reality TV.  This third season consists of 18 episodes, most of which are part of multiple-episode arcs.  These arcs consist the following.1. The sparring between Lex and Lionel becomes lethal that ends with the latter going to jail and the former being poisoned.2. The relationship between Clark and Lana ends as Lana gets admitted to a Parisian art school and leaves in the final episode.3. Clark's relationship with Pete goes through highs and lows and finally ends as Pete moves to Wichita with his mother.4. Lex grows more involved with research on meteor-infected humans and allows his curiousity to cloud his moral judgement.5. Clark accepts his fate and the mentorship of Jor-El and is taken by him in the final episode.Thrown into these 3 central themes are several stand-alone episodes that progress the training of Superman.  My favorite one was when Clark meets a meteor-infected guy who can see how people die.  When he touches Clark, he sees Superman flying through space and sky in his trademark cape of red and blue.  Surprised, he tells Clark that he sees no end to his life.

850034,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0002Y0QV2,P. Hardy,"[5, 11]","Being someone who's grown up watching ""Superman: The animated series"" and other superman related shows with my second big brother and my father, I'd like to think I know a decent amount about Superman and his life, whether it be in Metropolis or Smallville. That said, I started watching Smallville for the sake of learning more about Clark Kent and his life before Metropolis, plus TV wasn't the same any more without ""Toonami"" or ""Xena: Warrior princess"" coming on anymore.So I watched bits and pieces of it when I was bored and to make a long story short ""Smallville"" is the complete opposite of anything to with Superman or Clark Kent's life in Smallville. Basically, the show lacks a strong plot, depth, and personality in the characters in this show; the constant focus on Lana and Clark's inability to have a relationship (based on nothing) and then the focus on Lana rather than Clark Kent is downright boring and intolerable. This show feels more like ""Buffy: The vampire slayer"" with less sexual content and a gender switch (Clark takes the place of Buffy, and Lana takes the place of Buffy's failed relationships with the many men in her life), the parents; Martha and Jonathan Kent seem to be disjointed with their roles as parents, Martha does nothing but gape when something bad happens, making me wonder what her purpouse is in the show and Jonathan plays the role of ""mother and father"" telling Clark what's wrong and what's right while at the same time acting no better than his son would. Clark's friends Chloe Sullivan (Lois Lane's cousin made up just for Smallville) and Pete Ross just seem to be fillers when Lana isn't around Clark, and they just seem to get the in the way when danger is afoot.The story is a touch-and-go sort of thing; sometimes it revolves around Clark's origins or his father Jor-El, then sometimes it revolves around Lana's painstakingly boring and unoriginal past: not exactly exciting or interesting. The acting in the show could be better in everyone's case; Tom Welling can act but instead he ""under-acts"" when playing Clark Kent, making the character more thickheaded and ignorant, always the innocent one blaming himself for everything; basically out of character, Kirsten Kurk's acting is very bland and makes Lana Lang a most annoying character, who expects you to tell her everything there is to know about yourself because she did,  Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover play their roles as Lex and Lionel Luthor in a manner I suppose would be the way any Luthor would act, however, the portrayal characters are one-sided and predictable at times.Allison Mack and Sam Jones III acting could be better when it comes to their undeveloped characters, and lastly, John Schneider & Annette O'tolle's acting ... is not bad although it could be better. Basically, nothing is as it should be and Smallville is, sadly, more like Dawsons Creek, the O.C., Everwood, and One tree-hill;  meaning the show is made especially for the ""Superman"" deficient crowd and the hormonal teenagers, who like sex and suck-face (kissing all the time), break-up type shows around the world. There is so much antimosity and negitvity towards the characters in this show, it makes it hard to even watch at times. Lana's constant pushing Clark to tell the truth is rude and does nothing their one-sided reationship. Clark's constant quarreling with his best friends Pete and Chloe is uncomfortable to watch as well. Now, this show is not all bad, it has its redeeming points; like1): Clark actually wears a pair of glasses in one episode and one episode only (much to my dismay).2): There are some decent bullet time scenes in this seires, that would put even the two ""Matrix"" sequels to shame and the man who created or rather put it on sceen.3): There are some ""Dukes of Hazzard"" scenes in this show (I've only heard of this show mind you from my parents, I am a teenager), car desctruction is the best!4): Jonathan Kent has a Shotgun! Most excellent!5): Christopher Reeve made several appearances in some of the episodes (Superman movie BGM can be heard sometimes).6): They manage to have ""some"" Superman and Indian myths-o in the show. And there are some decent action scenes, no matter how short lived they are.IN conclusion: Smallville would've been much better if they stuck to the line that is ""Superman"" and not ""Ronchy Teenager's TV show"" with supernatrual hints to them.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[0, 0]","The third season of ""Smallville"" continues to revamp the Superman saga with reinvention of familiar characters and scenarios as well as the introduction of new foes for the future ""Man of Steel."" The set starts with the two-part punch of ""Exile"" and ""Phoenix"" wherein Clark (star Tom Welling) is still under the effects of red kryptonite, rendering him morally corrupt and succumbing to indulgences that he would never normally do. Fortunately, an agreement made between his father, Jonathan (John Schneider) and the long-dead Jor-el (voice of Terrence Stamp) restores young Kent to his former self, thus setting the stage for the rest of the season.And what a season it is!Not only does Clark deal with his own conflicting feelings for love Lana Lang (the beautiful Kristen Kreuk), he must contend with the widening gulf between himself and friend Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). Along the way, Clark battles returning enemies, love-obsessed ""super-freaks,"" and has to cope with burgeoning new powers that will serve him well as he emerges as the superhero that has enthralled fans for decades.While the show itself has the look of a feature film, especially with its impressive special effects, musical score by Mark Snow, and stunning cinematography, it is its ensemble cast and the writers attention to story and dialog that makes this show one of the best on television.The marvelous banter between Lex Luthor's Rosenbaum and his father Lionel, played by award-winning actor John Glover, is priceless. Episodes that highlight that father/son dynamic are ""Shattered,"" ""Asylum,"" and the superb ""Memoria.""Additionally, cast mate Allison Mack continues to steal scenes as the energetic Chloe Sullivan, intrepid high school reporter who herself frequently runs afoul of the Luthors.Schneider and Annette O'Toole as Clark's parents are superb as they must provide parental guidance and occasional rescue of the Kryptonian. Sam Jones as Clark's friend Pete Ross gets to stand center stage in ""Velocity"" and gets a fitting send-off in ""Forsaken.""Also, inspired casting of actors that rarely appear on television is one of the show's strength.  Rutger Hauer, Patrick Bergin, Michael McKean, and the late Christopher Reeve find themselves as pivotal contributors to the mythos that is Superman.  Future ""Lost"" cast member Ian Somerhaulder, the X-Men's Shawn Ashmore, and ""Home Improvement's"" Jonathan Taylor-Thomas are featured in recurring roles, lasting from two to six episodes.Warner Brothers really knows how to do a compilation right and this set is one of its best. The clarity of both picture and sound are top notch and the extras are worthy of the seasons.

After a kryptonite-induced romp in Metropolis, young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) returns to Smallville but new revelations involving his biological father Jor-El (voiced by Terrance Stamp) will direct him closer to his true destiny on Earth. The rivalry between Lex Luthor (Michael Rosembaum) and his father Lionel (John Glover) heats up as both Lex and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) pay high prices for investigating Lionel Luthor's crooked dealings. Lana Lang (Kristen Kreuk) falls for a mysterious stranger (Ian Somerhalder) who's hiding something dangerous about his past. Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, ""Smallville"" is the successful live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a teenage Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The third season features some stirring episodes, an entertaining season-long storyline, cool visual effects and guest stars like Rutger Hauer, Michael McKean and Christopher Reeve in his final acting role. It also includes such highlight episodes like ""Exile"", ""Phoenix"", ""Relic"", ""Asylum"", ""Memoria"" and ""Covenant"".If you already own the previous box sets, then feel free to pick up your copy of ""Smallville: The Complete Third Season"" at your local video store.

Characters were put into some bad situations which, when gotten out of, had consequences that were far reaching.  This was the darkness season for all the main characters-Lana, Pete, Chloe, Lex and especially Clark, where they all had to face some morally ambiguous sides of themselves and their friends and somehow find a way to move beyond the bad to find the good.  Unfortunately this also meant the continuation of the does he/doesn't she follies of Lana and Clark as they continued to do their respective relationship dances around each other, the root of which lays Clark's unwillingness to share his secret with her.  But once you get past this bit of redundant unpleasantvilleness, you can enjoy the many things going on this season.  First we get to see gangsta Clark on red kryptonite over a period of months.  Then we learn of Lex's fate after the airplane crash--this is the beginning of a truly unsettling storyline.  We learn about these stones of power that will have a prominent role in the fourth season.  There are many many highlights this season:  Lex's shock treatment in ""Asylum"" was one of the creepier moments of the season; ""Perry""-Michael McKean's performance of the future Daily Planet editor in chief was priceless; ""Hereafter""-that moment when Jordan glimpses Clark's future; ""Truth""-there is one truly chilling moment in the otherwise lighthearted episode when Chloe confronts Lionel about some important information; ""Crisis""-may be Smallville's version of the Dead Zone, but I've always been partial to the episodes that philosophize about free will versus fate; and the season closer, ""Covenant"" which hits the ground running, just gets better from there and ends on one of the most glorious cliff-hangers.

850045,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002Y0QV2,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Season Three of SMALLVILLE is yet another strong effort by all involved.  I retain a preference for Season Two-I think the writing was a bit sharper, and the dilemmas facing Clark more poignant-but I was never less than fully entertained as Clark's story continues.  The central theme of SMALLVILLE has been the host of issues that arise with secrecy and dishonesty, even if secrecy and lying is justified.  Not to get too highbrow, but one of the most fascinating essays in theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer's ETHICS was about telling the truth, and was written in a Nazi prison camp when he was undergoing constant interrogation for his involvement in a plot to assassinate Adolph Hitler.  He was constantly lying to protect his co-conspirators, and in the end he had to conclude that in this instance ""telling the truth"" in fact meant lying.  Clark faces the same dilemma as the balances the need to keep the truth from others and his desire to be honest and open.  As much as he loves Lana, their relationship is destroyed by his unwillingness to burden her with the knowledge of his secret.Not merely Lana, but all of Clark's friends understand that he is hiding a great deal from them, so much so that it is explicitly acknowledged on both sides.  His friendship with Chloe and Lex suffer nearly as much as his relationship with Lana, and it doesn't help that the only friend who is in on his secret, Pete, admits to him how much a burden knowing and keeping his secret has been.  And of course Clark isn't the only one withholding secrets; Lex and his father Lionel do so on an even grander scale, as Lionel plots against his son to remove much of his memory after Lex learns that Lionel had arranged to have his parents killed as a young man so that the could collect the insurance money.But the show started developing structural problems, problems that persisted into Season Four.  These are largely created by external problems.  If SMALLVILLE is to any degree to stay true to the Superman legend, we know that certain things can't happen:  Clark and Lana can't end up together (after all, there is a lady named Lois Lane who is destined to be romantically linked with the Man of Steel).  Clark is destined to move to Metropolis.  Clark and Lex will eventually become enemies, unless they do a revision in which they are instead involved in complex and conflicted relationship.  In other words, there are serious limitations on the directions they can take things with Clark in Smallville.  I personally would like to see them end SMALLVILLE after Season Five, and create a new show to be entitled METROPOLIS.  Some of the characters we've seen in SMALLVILLE could survive-Season Four's Lois Lane, obviously, as well as Lex and perhaps Lionel, and perhaps even Chloe (who does aspire to moving to Metropolis and working on the Daily Planet, perhaps with Clark, Lois, and Jimmy Olsen, with whom Chloe apparently had a fling during her internship there).  I like a lot of what they do with the Superman story on the show, but starting with Season Three and definitely with Season Four, it has just seemed like it might be for the show to transform itself into something completely different.  I think the characters, the actors, the writers, and producers could all use a new challenge.Still, I applaud the folks involved on the show for continuing to do a first rate job in treating with respect one of America's most iconic superheroes.",4,Another strong season for the Boy of Steel,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,3444,"['Season', 'Three', 'SMALLVILLE', 'yet', 'strong', 'effort', 'involved', 'retain', 'preference', 'Season', 'Two-I', 'think', 'writing', 'was', 'bit', 'sharper', 'dilemmas', 'facing', 'Clark', 'more', 'poignant-but', 'was', 'never', 'less', 'fully', 'entertained', 'Clark', 'story', 'central', 'theme', 'SMALLVILLE', 'been', 'host', 'issues', 'arise', 'secrecy', 'dishonesty', 'even', 'secrecy', 'lying', 'justified', 'Not', 'get', 'too', 'highbrow', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'essays', 'theologian', 'Dietrich', 'Bonhoeffer', 'ETHICS', 'was', 'telling', 'truth', 'was', 'written', 'Nazi', 'prison', 'camp', 'when', 'was', 'undergoing', 'constant', 'interrogation', 'involvement', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'was', 'constantly', 'lying', 'protect', 'co-conspirators', 'end', 'had', 'conclude', 'instance', 'telling', 'truth', 'fact', 'meant', 'lying', 'Clark', 'same', 'dilemma', 'balances', 'need', 'keep', 'truth', 'others', 'desire', 'be', 'honest', 'open', 'As', 'much', 'Lana', 'relationship', 'destroyed', 'unwillingness', 'burden', 'knowledge', 'secret.Not', 'merely', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'friends', 'understand', 'hiding', 'great', 'deal', 'so', 'much', 'explicitly', 'acknowledged', 'sides', 'friendship', 'Chloe', 'Lex', 'suffer', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'relationship', 'Lana', ""n't"", 'help', 'only', 'friend', 'who', 'secret', 'Pete', 'how', 'much', 'burden', 'knowing', 'keeping', 'secret', 'been', 'course', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'withholding', 'secrets', 'Lex', 'father', 'Lionel', 'do', 'so', 'even', 'grander', 'scale', 'Lionel', 'plots', 'son', 'remove', 'much', 'memory', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'had', 'arranged', 'have', 'parents', 'killed', 'young', 'man', 'could', 'collect', 'insurance', 'money.But', 'show', 'started', 'developing', 'structural', 'problems', 'problems', 'persisted', 'Season', 'Four', 'are', 'largely', 'created', 'external', 'problems', 'SMALLVILLE', 'degree', 'stay', 'true', 'Superman', 'legend', 'know', 'certain', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'together', 'lady', 'named', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'who', 'destined', 'be', 'romantically', 'linked', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Clark', 'destined', 'move', 'Metropolis', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'enemies', 'do', 'revision', 'are', 'instead', 'involved', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'relationship', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'serious', 'limitations', 'directions', 'can', 'take', 'things', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'personally', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'end', 'SMALLVILLE', 'Season', 'Five', 'create', 'new', 'show', 'be', 'entitled', 'METROPOLIS', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'SMALLVILLE', 'could', 'survive-Season', 'Four', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'obviously', 'as', 'well', 'Lex', 'perhaps', 'Lionel', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Chloe', 'who', 'aspire', 'moving', 'Metropolis', 'working', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'perhaps', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'whom', 'Chloe', 'apparently', 'had', 'fling', 'internship', 'like', 'lot', 'what', 'do', 'Superman', 'story', 'show', 'starting', 'Season', 'Three', 'definitely', 'Season', 'Four', 'just', 'seemed', 'might', 'be', 'show', 'transform', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'think', 'characters', 'actors', 'writers', 'producers', 'could', 'use', 'new', 'challenge.Still', 'applaud', 'folks', 'involved', 'show', 'continuing', 'do', 'first', 'rate', 'job', 'treating', 'respect', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'iconic', 'superheroes']",N/A

However, this presents another interesting question as we watch Lex.  If Lionel is this bad, just how much more cruel will Lex become?  We don't yet see how Lex transforms into the evil Luthor who ultimately becomes the arch-enemy of Clark Kent/Superman.Season three largely deals with the main characters and their battles with their ""dark sides.""  This makes for some very good stories as we see Clark using the red kryptonite ring to avoid the guilt he feels for the explosion on the farm and the death of his baby brother/sister.There is an episode where Lana goes ""bad.""  Chloe can't seem to get out from under the influence of Lionel and the deal she made in Season 2.

There are still the meteorite-infected teens, but there are more stories in this season that don't use them as much as in the first two seasons.We also see a shift in the Clark/Lana relationship as Lana is left to try and figure out what caused the separation, and how she is now trying to reconcile her feelings toward him.Christopher Reeve makes another appearance and a very intriguing one at that.Fans of the first two seasons will not be disappointed in Season 3, and a nice big cliffhanger will leave you salivating for Season 4.",5,Smallville still going strong in third season,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,1771,"['one', 'actor', 'responsible', 'really', 'keeping', 'intrigue', 'Smallville', 'third', 'season', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'John', 'Glover', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', '.We', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'sadistic', 'manipulative', 'almost', 'untouchable', 'Lionel', 'However', 'interesting', 'question', 'watch', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'bad', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'cruel', 'will', 'Lex', 'become', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'see', 'how', 'Lex', 'transforms', 'evil', 'Luthor', 'who', 'ultimately', 'arch-enemy', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman.Season', 'three', 'largely', 'deals', 'main', 'characters', 'battles', 'dark', 'sides', 'very', 'good', 'stories', 'see', 'Clark', 'using', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'ring', 'avoid', 'guilt', 'explosion', 'farm', 'death', 'baby', 'episode', 'where', 'Lana', 'bad', 'Chloe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'out', 'influence', 'Lionel', 'deal', 'made', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'Pete', 'deal', 'consequences', 'using', 'Clark', 'secret', 'own', 'advantage.Finally', 'also', 'see', 'beginning', 'decline', 'friendship', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'know', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'out.The', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'first-rate', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'still', 'meteorite-infected', 'teens', 'are', 'more', 'stories', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.We', 'also', 'see', 'shift', 'Clark/Lana', 'relationship', 'Lana', 'left', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'caused', 'separation', 'how', 'now', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'feelings', 'Reeve', 'appearance', 'very', 'intriguing', 'one', 'that.Fans', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Season', '3', 'nice', 'big', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'leave', 'salivating', 'Season', '4']",N/A

850051,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B0002Y0QV2,Simon,"[6, 8]","The hit series Smallville continues in this third season collection of 22 episodes. The intensity gets cranked up as Lex's mental health is called into question, Lionel Luthor begins bringing people back from the dead, Jonathan suffers the consequences of his deal with Jor-El, and Clark gains a new power as well as new revelations on his past and future. There's a lot to be excited about this season as Smallville puts its characters through the grinder.However, for every step Smallville takes during its third year, it also seems to take a step back. Story arcs still don't connect as well as they should; characters like Adam Knight are introduced, then reduced to minor cameos until they're needed again. Potentially interesting characters like Alicia Carter are written off as meteor freaks, and established characters like Pete are given nothing to do (Sam Jones III leaves at the end of this season). Clark and Lana's relationship goes nowhere and even begins to get annoying. And in perhaps the most frustrating moment of all, the show is pretty much reset to zero after the startling events of last season's finale. The writers still can't seem to logically expand on established plot points, and the show  often flounders because of it.However, even with all the flaws Smallville is a guilty pleasure. The acting is still superb, with John Glover and Michael Rosenbaum again stealing the show. And the story threads, for all their convoluted twists, are still worth following. If Smallville seasons 1 and 2 were good melodrama, then season 3 is pure soap opera. And for better or for worse, everything that makes TV worth watching (read: sex and violence) is present in spades. The episode ""Obsession"" gets high marks for the Clark/Alicia bedroom scene alone.So we get 22 episodes with great audio and video, 3 commentaries, a featurette, gag reel, vol. 2 of the Chloe Chronicles, and lots of deleted scenes.

Lex is missing after a plane crash while Clark's dark side--Kalel--is fully in charge at the opening of the season creating a lot of tension as we wait to see how much destruction Kalel will bring upon the world, and on Clark's relationships. This appears to be the start of an on-going theme in this series.  Clark knows that he will have an enemy, and the viewer understands the enemy is within Clark though he does not realize it yet.Other interesting themes in Season Three are: understanding levels of intimacy and truth in friendship, how much of yourself do you share with others, what is a lie vs what is protecting your own privacy, and the ravages of holding a secret. Pete's best friend states in one scene that it has been a privilege to hold Clark's secret because no-one has ever trusted him that much, and in a different scene in the same episode Pete discusses how hard it has been for him due to his fear of betraying Clark.  Smallville explores if it is possible to be close to someone without knowing everything about them.All of this interesting interpersonal development occurs in a matrix of fun and exciting action based upon the superhero fantasy.

I thought it was way to modern to be a success and always watched it rarely from times to times. The last few weeks I have been watching season four from the beginning and as soon as the third came into dvd I watched it whole in 4 days!! Having lost a lot of episodes from the earlier seasons 2 and 3 I cannot really compare the third with the previous.Yet this show is fantastic. There are some iconic elements of Superman in some of the episodes that mean a lot. For example the guy who sees the future from whoever touches - the scene where he touches Clark and then we see the red cape brings a lot of chills!!!- is fantastic. From my point of view the third season must be better than the fourth -I have seen half the fourh season- as there is great continuity among the episodes and the characters move on and mature.Of course there are some minor issues that may not make sense in general like the fact that something is going on with Clark, the many times that the main characters get save, the amount of Cryptonite that can be bought in the supermarket etc but for the sake of movies you get passed them!This series don't like like a cheap weekly show. The production is highbudgeted, the directors of the episodes, really talented, the effects will satisfy everyone with a great deal of realism in the most important of all the stories.

850059,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0002Y0QV2,Tom Benton,"[2, 2]","I absolutely adored the first season of SMALLVILLE, and I loved the second as well.  The third season is somewhat like ice cream: you know it's not healthy, but it's just so good.  You're probably thinking, ""What the hell's this guy talking about?""  Well, what I'm trying to say is that the third season of SMALLVILLE is a fair step from brilliant - but it's so much fun to watch, you hardly mind.The main issues that our characters deal with throughout this season are trust, loyalty, and lies.  The season picks up a few months after where the previous one left off.  Kal-El - a.k.a. Clark Kent (Tom Welling) - is on a crime-filled rampage through Metropolis, controlled by his red kryptonite ring.  While on this crime spree, Kal-El attracts the attention of Morgan Edge (Rutger Hauer), a crime boss who ranks just beside Lionel Luthor (John Glover) in the list of Metropolis' most deadly citizens.  Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) finds himself stranded on a desert island after his airplane crashes.  As you may have guessed, the season gets off to a fantastic start.  The season opener, ""Exile"", is one of the series' finest episodes.  In ""Perry"", we're introduced to Perry White (Michael McKean), the future editor of The Daily Planet.  The following episode, ""Relic"", is a personal favorite of mine; in the episode, Clark experiences visions showing him his biological father, Jor-El (also played by Welling), during his time on Earth in 1955.  ""Crisis"" is a clever episode, in which Clark receives a phone call from the future which may help him prevent a murder of one of his loved ones.  The late Christopher Reeve makes his final acting appearance in ""Legacy"".  Lex recovers suppressed childhood memories in the moving ""Memoria"".  And in the season finale, titled ""Covenant"", Clark meets a girl who may be the last surviving Kryptonian woman.Throughout the season, we're treated to excellent acting (John Glover is just wonderful) and intriguing storylines - not to mention a great soundtrack.  But this season's major problem is the relationship between Clark and Lana.  As Pete (Sam Jones III) points out in ""Forsaken"", they have a kind of yo-yo relationship.  Clark wants to go out with Lana, but Lana doesn't feel like Clark's telling the truth.  Lana wants to go out with Clark, but Clark's afraid that it's too dangerous for Lana to be around him.  It's clear that creators Al Gough and Miles Millar were trying to keep the show's fans on the edge of their seats, waiting to see those crazy kids get together, but by the end of the season you find yourself wondering just what's keeping them apart.While Clark and Lana's on-again/off-again relationship has become tiresome by the end of the season, and there's a slight lack of originality showing as far as the episodes themselves, Season Three boasts great storylines, terrific acting, and some very memorable scenes (the reference to THE GODFATHER from ""Covenant"" comes to mind).

850064,A2S2QOH5JERUV7,B0002Y0QV2,William,"[1, 1]","The suprising thing about Smallville when you first start watching it is:  It's a compelling drama...about a young Superman!  Father-son relationships, teenage romance, and supernatural storylines all blend together to create a richness that the more comic-book inspired versions of Superman have lacked.  But even if you are a comic book fan, you'll be won over by it because it is faithful to what really matters about Superman: the character's struggle to fit in among humanity while secretly desiring to be one of us...and being with the girl of his dreams.The actors are all incredibly good-looking (not a bad thing) but they can also act and they are given some really great material.  In these early seasons the relationship between Lex and Lionel (played by Michal Rosenbaum and John Glover) was most fascinating to me.  But Clark (Tom Welling) is the heart of the show.  Lana is the hot girl of his dreams and she is often left to look longingly at him while he pulls away...but Kristen Kruek who plays her does it well and I think the producers have been smart to spread out the ""relationship"" episodes with different adventures.  All the characters get to shine in different episodes and there are some great nods to the Christopher Reeve movies.Addendum:  Smallville seemed to have gained a different following in it's last few seasons, after Kristen Kruek, Michael Rosenbaum, and others left the show.  I honestly lost interest at about that time but many people feel like the show got better.  Obviously Smallville had a big impact on Superman mythology.  I think it ranks among the better Superman TV shows, and for people who want a modern take on the character beyond the classic Adventures of Superman or the animated series of the 90s, it might be the Superman show for them.",5,Better than most superhero movies.

850065,AP3B615GM191G,B0002Y0QV2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 4]","There comes a point in every TV show when the viewer needs to feel invigorated and fresh about watching the show. No matter how much a person likes a certain show, it is nice to keep having milestone moments to keep the passion alive. For me, this happened during the Third Season of Smallville. Now, don't get me wrong, I would have watched the Third Season if it would have been terrible, but nothing of the sort happened. In Season Three, Smallville cements its reputation as one of the greatest shows of our time. It takes all the plot threads of the previous two seasons and builds them into a crescendo that covers almost the entire Third Season! The highlights:-Under the influence of red kryptonite, Clark runs away from home and heads to Metropolis.-Lex is pushed to the brink (or over?) of insanity.-Metropolis crime boss Morgan Edge takes an interest in the Luthors and the Kents.-Perry White of the Daily Planet is introduced.-The return of Christopher Reeves and what side is he really on?-Will Lex ever regain his mind?-A Krypton girl (Kara) claims to have all the answers Clark is looking for.-Lionel Luthor shows his true allegiances.-A surreal season finale, in which the bedrock of the Smallville community is shaken to the core.Through all those great plot threads, the strength of Smallville is still its character development. My favorite single episode of Smallville, Relic, airs in Season Three. In Relic, actors Tom Welling (Clark) and Kristin Kreuk (Lana) play characters from Smallville of the 1960s. Though the characters of ""Lana"" and ""Clark"" do not apply in that time period, it is still fascinating to see Welling and Kreuk interacting with one another portraying different characters.In conclusion, Season Three of Smallville really expanded the show in new and better directions. I am anxiously waiting the Season Four DVD set through the mail, where I have no doubts the show will continue to expand its horizons.",5,It Just Keeps Getting Better,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1946,"['point', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'viewer', 'feel', 'invigorated', 'fresh', 'watching', 'show', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'person', 'certain', 'show', 'nice', 'keep', 'having', 'milestone', 'moments', 'keep', 'passion', 'alive', 'happened', 'Third', 'Season', 'Smallville', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'Third', 'Season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'nothing', 'sort', 'happened', 'Season', 'Three', 'Smallville', 'reputation', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'time', 'plot', 'threads', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'builds', 'crescendo', 'almost', 'entire', 'Third', 'Season', 'highlights', '-Under', 'influence', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'Clark', 'away', 'home', 'heads', 'Metropolis.-Lex', 'pushed', 'brink', 'insanity.-Metropolis', 'crime', 'boss', 'Morgan', 'Edge', 'interest', 'Luthors', 'Kents.-Perry', 'White', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'introduced.-The', 'return', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'what', 'side', 'really', '-Will', 'Lex', 'ever', 'regain', 'mind', '-A', 'Krypton', 'girl', 'Kara', 'claims', 'have', 'answers', 'Clark', 'looking', 'for.-Lionel', 'Luthor', 'true', 'allegiances.-A', 'surreal', 'season', 'finale', 'bedrock', 'Smallville', 'community', 'shaken', 'core.Through', 'great', 'plot', 'threads', 'strength', 'Smallville', 'still', 'character', 'development', 'favorite', 'single', 'episode', 'Smallville', 'Relic', 'Season', 'Three', 'Relic', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'play', 'characters', 'Smallville', '1960s', 'characters', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'time', 'period', 'still', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Welling', 'Kreuk', 'interacting', 'one', 'portraying', 'different', 'characters.In', 'conclusion', 'Season', 'Three', 'Smallville', 'really', 'expanded', 'show', 'new', 'better', 'directions', 'am', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'Season', 'Four', 'DVD', 'set', 'mail', 'where', 'have', 'doubts', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'expand', 'horizons']",N/A
