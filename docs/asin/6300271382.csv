Jack Webb plays Kelly, a 1920s cornet player in Kansas City who runs into trouble with a gangster who demands ""protection."" He goes along with it for a while, but then decides to stand up for himself and comes out a winner (no surprise there). Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and an excellent jazz combo add immeasurably to what's lacking in the story. Dick Cathcart did the trumpet dubs. Another plus is the wisecracking script - there are more sarcasms and smart-alecky quips per frame than just about anyplace else in moviedom, and most are real zingers. On the negative side, Webb is as stiff as a board (a style all his: think DRAGNET, only here he's even stiffer) and the shootout at the empty nightclub is on the far side of reality.

I had been hearing the rumors that it was fullscreen, but when I saw it advertised on TCM they showed a widescreen clip, so I took a chance.Rest assured, it is indeed widescreen. It sounds great, and it looks great with a couple of numbers by Ella Fitzgerald. However, this is not anything close to a musical. Rather it is a 20's gangster tale that involves Pete Kelly (Jack Webb) and his band. For those of you who remember Dragnet, Webb's narration might have you thinking of Dragnet just a little too much. Webb also directed this film, and he did a great job of giving it a real 20's feel. You don't feel like you're looking at a bunch of people from the 50's dressed up for a 20's costume party.The only thing bad I can say about it is I had a hard time figuring out Pete Kelly's motivation. A person close to him is killed, and he is ready to give in to the gangster responsible and forget the whole thing ever happened. He finds out another person he barely knows has been killed by the same gangster and he's ready for war. He tosses an eager and beautiful Janet Leigh out of his room in one scene, and in the next scene he's overjoyed to see her to the point of wanting to marry her. The clinical acting style that worked so well for Webb in Dragnet just left me a little confused here.

He is Pete Kelly, a lKansas City trumpeter who heads up a small jazz band that is suddenly forced into paying protection to a local gangster, Fran McCarg, played by Edmond O'Brien.  There are some up and comers in the film including Janet Leigh, as Ivy a party loving rich girl, Lee Marvin, as Al, a superb clarinet player who leaves the band because of McCarg, Martin Milner as Joey, a drummer who pays the ultimate price for not keeping his mouth shut about McCarg, Andy Devine, as George Tennel, in a serious role as a detective who wants McCarg out of commission and Jayne Mansfield, as the dark haired Cigarette Girl. Even Harry Morgan* is seen but uncredited in the film. Thanks to Jack Webb, himself a great jazz fan, a few great musicians, uncredited and credited, like Ella Fitzgerald, have small roles but the stand-out performance, as McCarg's world weary and fragile moll, belongs to Peggy Lee, in her role as Rose Hopkins, a troubled singer who had been brought down by her affinity for booze. Not long after drying out, with McCarg pushing her all the way, Rose attempts a come-back with Pete Kelly's band. She knows exactly what McCarg is and fears him but all seemingly goes well until Rose begins to drink again. After finding her intoxicated one night and forcing her to perform, McCarg beats her so severely that she ends up hospitalized...in a mental asylum.  After Pete sees Rose at the hospital he decides he has had enough of Fran McCarg and with the help of a former gang member, tries to set McCarg up for a show down.*Morgan appeared as Webb's partner on the &#34;Dragnet&#34; TV series after Ben Alexander ended his run on the show.

Well, that doesn't give the right impression, though one commentator on IMDB titled his review ""If you can only see one existential noir gangster musical... ""This isn't a major film, but I found it to be a very enjoyable one.  The music was splendid from beginning to end---a lot of jazz standards are played here, performed full or in part, and also there's plenty of great music heard in the background.Of course, I suppose it's a given that I'd enjoy a film that features both Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald, who can each be seen here in extremely rare big-screen performances.  And both do a splendid job and sing a few excellent songs, though Peggy had the larger role (she got an Oscar nomination for her work in this picture).The only weak link, really, is Jack Webb's performance.  To say he's a bit wooden and stiff is an understatement.  I think the part called for a considerably more dynamic star.  With a more energetic and charismatic performance the film would have been much improved.  However----this picture really is Jack Webb's baby (he also directed)---he loved this sort of music and put a lot of himself into it.  And so I'm not going to grouse too much about him.The film looks fantastic---this was an early Cinemascope picture, with a four-track stereo soundtrack, and it holds up very well both visually and aurally.

Speakeasies and flappers, colorfully splayed over the then new wide, wide screen.  And Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald singing in their prime.  Well directed by Jack Webb, but the film is hurt immeasurably by having him in the lead role. He is wooden, and awkward with every line. It is Joe Friday from DRAGNET, transported by some lunatic time machine into  the roaring twenties. At 1955 Warner Bros, Paul Newman was making his debut in the wretched THE SILVER CHALICE. Consider, how much more effective this would be if he was the lead, here, rather wearing a toga.  Webb believed in the film, and did a great job with its production, but his vanity assured him that he was a romantic lead. He was wrong.  I had the laser disc of this and always admired it, with that, rather large, reservation. This dvd is an improvement , visually and aurally, and a  welcome part of my collection... at a great price.",3,Atmospheric jazz age gangster film,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,978,"['Very', 'interesting', 'film', 'Very', 'typical', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'mid', 'fifties', 'Speakeasies', 'flappers', 'colorfully', 'splayed', 'then', 'new', 'wide', 'wide', 'screen', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'singing', 'prime', 'Well', 'directed', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'film', 'hurt', 'immeasurably', 'having', 'lead', 'role', 'wooden', 'awkward', 'line', 'Joe', 'Friday', 'DRAGNET', 'transported', 'lunatic', 'time', 'machine', 'roaring', 'twenties', '1955', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'making', 'debut', 'wretched', 'THE', 'SILVER', 'CHALICE', 'Consider', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'lead', 'here', 'rather', 'wearing', 'toga', 'Webb', 'believed', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'production', 'vanity', 'assured', 'was', 'romantic', 'lead', 'was', 'wrong', 'had', 'laser', 'disc', 'always', 'admired', 'rather', 'large', 'reservation', 'dvd', 'improvement', 'visually', 'aurally', 'welcome', 'part', 'collection', 'great', 'price']",N/A
237859,ADVLRJS633OTD,6300271382,"Susanna Hutcheson ""Copywriting for the Discri...","[6, 7]","Pete Kelly's Blues was a radio show that Jack Webb starred in way back in the late forties or early fifties. The show was short lived as the network wanted Webb to do Dragnet.But Webb was an avid jazz fan. He had a tremendous jazz collection of some 6000 recordings. This movie was very special to him. While Webb was not a great actor, he surrounded himself with a marvelous group of actors for this movie. And the music is without equal.The plot, like all Webb plots, was simple. A gangster was hassling Kelly and Kelly took him out. The movie was written by Richard Breen, who wrote a lot of scripts for Webb both on radio and later on television. Breen knew how to write for Webb and the script worked.Peggy Lee and Janet Leigh both did fantastic work and Lee sang wonderfully well in her unique style. Her acting was lovely.The soundtrack to the film is a must-have for any Webb fan and, for that matter, for any jazz fan. Be sure and get the true original as there are many versions. I own the vinyl and the original and prize it. They're expensive but worth the price.Webb was not a good actor. He was stiff and limited. But his greatness came in his desire to try new things and to give whatever he did 100 percent. The result was always unique. Moreover, his greatness came in his attention to detail while, at the same time, quickly running through a very simple script and making it very good. Few people can do that in any profession but especially the arts.Webb was passionate about his work. And he was especially passionate about this rather dark movie that took place in 1929 Kansas City. Having an intimate knowledge of KC and the great jazz houses, I was very keen on the movie. Of course, I wasn't around in 1929. But if I had been, I would have hung out in the road houses and listened to the jazz. So this movie is the next best thing to having been there.Highly recommended.",5,A real collector's movie,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1896,"['Pete', 'Kelly', 'Blues', 'was', 'radio', 'show', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'starred', 'way', 'back', 'late', 'forties', 'early', 'fifties', 'show', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'network', 'wanted', 'Webb', 'do', 'Dragnet.But', 'Webb', 'was', 'avid', 'jazz', 'fan', 'had', 'tremendous', 'jazz', 'collection', '6000', 'recordings', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'Webb', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'surrounded', 'marvelous', 'group', 'actors', 'movie', 'music', 'equal.The', 'plot', 'Webb', 'plots', 'was', 'simple', 'gangster', 'was', 'hassling', 'Kelly', 'Kelly', 'took', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Richard', 'Breen', 'who', 'wrote', 'lot', 'scripts', 'Webb', 'radio', 'later', 'television', 'Breen', 'knew', 'how', 'write', 'Webb', 'script', 'worked.Peggy', 'Lee', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'did', 'fantastic', 'work', 'Lee', 'sang', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'unique', 'style', 'acting', 'was', 'lovely.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'must-have', 'Webb', 'fan', 'matter', 'jazz', 'fan', 'Be', 'sure', 'get', 'true', 'original', 'are', 'many', 'versions', 'own', 'vinyl', 'original', 'prize', ""'re"", 'expensive', 'price.Webb', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'stiff', 'limited', 'greatness', 'came', 'desire', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'give', 'whatever', 'did', '100', 'percent', 'result', 'was', 'always', 'unique', 'Moreover', 'greatness', 'came', 'attention', 'detail', 'same', 'time', 'quickly', 'running', 'very', 'simple', 'script', 'making', 'very', 'good', 'Few', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'profession', 'especially', 'arts.Webb', 'was', 'passionate', 'work', 'was', 'especially', 'passionate', 'rather', 'dark', 'movie', 'took', 'place', '1929', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Having', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'KC', 'great', 'jazz', 'houses', 'was', 'very', 'keen', 'movie', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', '1929', 'had', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'hung', 'out', 'road', 'houses', 'listened', 'jazz', 'movie', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'having', 'been', 'there.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

237861,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300271382,Trevor Willsmer,"[7, 8]","Pete Kelly's Blues is everything people used to go to the movies for - a great cast speaking great dialogue in a good story imaginatively told and well paced without a single dull moment (this is one of the few films where the screenplay is credited above the title, and it certainly earns it). Great music, too.Pete Kelly (Jack Webb) is a hard-bitten jazzman in the Bogart mode, albeit with the added and very visually striking ability to walk without moving his arms. We know that there's a heart of gold under his stone-face because he keeps a bird in his apartment, but he's having none of it: ""I'm nice to him because I may get hungry some day and have to eat him. In the meantime, he can hit G above C so I keep him around.""Set in the Prohibition era when musicians were thrown out of hotels because they had an instrument case (""If it had been a machine gun it would have been alright""), Kelly's Big Seven soon find themselves the latest clients of Edmond O'Brien at his meanest (""They say you got rubber pockets so you can steal soup""), a violent racketeer who is moving into the agent business. His first act as their representative is to kill one of the band and add a singer to the lineup - an Oscar-nominated Peggy Lee as his alcoholic girlfriend who ends up in the asylum - making Joe Esterhaus' infamous complaints about Michael Ovitz pale into insignificance.And that's all without his difficult romance with society dame Janet Leigh - she wants to be married before she's so old that the rice knocks her down, but he thinks they're incompatible because he doesn't know where his next meal's coming from and she doesn't know where her next country's coming from. Add endlessly quotable dialogue (""Rudy's a puny little guy - sew an extra button on his vest he'd fall down.""), some great faces in the supporting cast (Lee Marvin, Andy Devine, even Jayne Mansfield) and a terrific and very credible gunfight finale in a deserted ballroom with a killer of a last line from O'Brien's bodyguard and they don't come much better than this.Beautifully designed for the CinemaScope screen in the days when CinemaScope was CINEMAScope - this really is one of the great 50s Scope films - and with a great stereo soundtrack, don't let the cult movie tag put you off - this is solid mainstream entertainment at its best and terrific with it. If you love movies, you'll probably love Pete Kelly's Blues. And thankfully Warner's Region 1 US NTSC DVD is absolutely stunning, with great sound and incredible picture quality that puts many modern films to shame and which really showcases Harold Rossen's superb colour cinematography and Harper Goff's impressive design. The only extras are a comic Robert Youngson short about early automobiles, Gadgets Galore, and cartoon The Hole Idea, which isn't one of Robert McKimson's best but has a great punchline, though it's a pity they couldn't have dug up a trailer or, better still, an episode or two of the radio show that preceded it or the short-lived TV series that followed.",5,"Just the sax, ma'am, just the sax.",1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,3023,"['Pete', 'Kelly', 'Blues', 'everything', 'people', 'used', 'go', 'movies', 'great', 'cast', 'speaking', 'great', 'dialogue', 'good', 'story', 'imaginatively', 'told', 'well', 'paced', 'single', 'dull', 'moment', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'where', 'screenplay', 'credited', 'title', 'certainly', 'Great', 'music', 'too.Pete', 'Kelly', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'hard-bitten', 'jazzman', 'Bogart', 'mode', 'added', 'very', 'visually', 'striking', 'ability', 'walk', 'moving', 'arms', 'know', 'heart', 'gold', 'stone-face', 'bird', 'apartment', 'having', 'none', ""'m"", 'nice', 'may', 'get', 'hungry', 'day', 'have', 'eat', 'meantime', 'can', 'hit', 'G', 'C', 'keep', 'around', 'Set', 'Prohibition', 'era', 'when', 'musicians', 'were', 'thrown', 'hotels', 'had', 'instrument', 'case', 'had', 'been', 'machine', 'gun', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'alright', 'Kelly', 'Big', 'Seven', 'soon', 'find', 'latest', 'clients', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'meanest', 'say', 'got', 'rubber', 'pockets', 'can', 'steal', 'soup', 'violent', 'racketeer', 'who', 'moving', 'agent', 'business', 'first', 'act', 'representative', 'kill', 'one', 'band', 'add', 'singer', 'lineup', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'alcoholic', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'up', 'asylum', 'making', 'Joe', 'Esterhaus', 'infamous', 'complaints', 'Michael', 'Ovitz', 'pale', 'insignificance.And', 'difficult', 'romance', 'society', 'dame', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'be', 'married', 'so', 'old', 'rice', 'down', ""'re"", 'incompatible', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'next', 'meal', 'coming', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'next', 'country', 'coming', 'Add', 'endlessly', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'Rudy', 'puny', 'little', 'guy', 'sew', 'extra', 'button', 'vest', ""'d"", 'fall', 'down', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'even', 'Jayne', 'Mansfield', 'terrific', 'very', 'credible', 'gunfight', 'finale', 'deserted', 'ballroom', 'killer', 'last', 'line', ""O'Brien"", 'bodyguard', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'better', 'this.Beautifully', 'designed', 'CinemaScope', 'screen', 'days', 'when', 'CinemaScope', 'was', 'CINEMAScope', 'really', 'one', 'great', '50s', 'Scope', 'films', 'great', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'cult', 'movie', 'tag', 'put', 'off', 'solid', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'best', 'terrific', 'love', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'Pete', 'Kelly', 'Blues', 'thankfully', 'Warner', 'Region', '1', 'US', 'NTSC', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'great', 'sound', 'incredible', 'picture', 'quality', 'many', 'modern', 'films', 'shame', 'really', 'Harold', 'Rossen', 'superb', 'colour', 'cinematography', 'Harper', 'Goff', 'impressive', 'design', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'comic', 'Robert', 'Youngson', 'short', 'early', 'automobiles', 'Gadgets', 'Galore', 'cartoon', 'Hole', 'Idea', ""n't"", 'one', 'Robert', 'McKimson', 'best', 'great', 'punchline', 'pity', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'dug', 'up', 'trailer', 'better', 'still', 'episode', 'two', 'radio', 'show', 'preceded', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'followed']",N/A
