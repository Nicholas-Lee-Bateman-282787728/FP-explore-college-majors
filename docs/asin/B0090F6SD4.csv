I had already bought the original DVD release about ten years ago and was saddened that they hadn't included the pilot or done something daring and incorporated the various TV scenes for a fuller, more robust theatrical release version. Sadly, Universal is like Warner in regards to ignoring their fans' interest in the oldies. Warner has its Archives Collection and Universal has its Franchise Collections, but neither seem willing to invest in better releases. Buck Rogers should have interviews with Gil Gerard, Erin Gray, Thom Christopher, Pamela Hensley and even Glen Larson; we should have TV spots, a movie trailer, a making of...feature, a retrospective that includes the comic strip, 1938 serial, 1950's TV series, comic books, TSR role playing game and the webisodes and of Buck's son. But as is Universal's respect for its own commodity goes it's bare bones.The second season isn't as fun as the first, true, but, in toto, the 37 episodes and the original theatrical release fired up my imagination immensely.Why five stars?

1579148,A2DDBYKXF1N0D5,B0090F6SD4,Jero Briggs,"[5, 5]","The first copy I got did not include the TV pilot! It said it included the TV pilot and that it had four discs. When I got it, it did not include the pilot, and it only had two discs - the same two discs that were included in ""The Complete Epic Series"". They were even listed as Discs 4 & 5. Be careful what you buy. I bought mine online. If you are looking for the TV pilot, try maybe buying it new at a store rather than online. And make sure it says it includes the pilot on cover before buying. After I got a bad one online, I decided to look for it new in stores. The one I bought at the store actually included four discs and the TV pilot as a bonus episode on the final disc.The first DVD release of the show was ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series"" which included both seasons one & two in one box set. But it only had the theatrical edit of the pilot. They made two edits of the pilot, a movie edit that was released in theaters nearly six months before the TV series was released, and a television edit which they aired as part of the television series. Now they have re-released the series on DVD in seasons. Season One still only includes the theatrical pilot, but Season Two includes the TV pilot as a bonus episode. I already had ""The Complete Epic Series"" DVD box set, but being a fan of the show, I still wanted the TV pilot as well. So I bought the season two set as well.Although I do prefer the theatrical edit, I still wanted the TV edit too. Mainly because of four scenes they added in the TV version (1. The scene where Twiki and Theo show Buck his new apartment, 2. Buck's inquiry about Anarkia - which is the 25th century name for old Chicago, 3. The part where Wilma thanks Buck for helping her fight the pirates but then tells him that since the Princess denied Buck's story that she would have to place him under arrest and Buck tells her that it would be pointless due to the fact that he has nowhere to go that the only home he had is 500 years in the past, 4. The added epilogue scene at the end that features Buck decorating his new place when he is interrupted by Wilma and Dr. Huer who try to get him to join Earth's Defense Directorate.) All of those scenes make the TV version worth buying. However, on the down side, the scene with Buck fighting Tigerman is trimmed and badly edited, King Draco no longer appears in the story, they cut out Kane's last line about getting revenge on Buck Rogers, and a boom mike can also be seen in one scene (the scene was also featured in the movie, but the boom mike does not appear in the movie version). That's why I like the movie edit better, but those four added scenes in the TV version still got me to re-buy a season I already have just so I could watch them.As for the season itself, season two was a big departure from the first. Although the series was doing good during its first season, the network went ahead and cut the show's budget for its second, the show was reformatted to have a more ""Star Trek"" type of feel to it, they got rid of several characters from the first season, the show didn't have as much action in it, the special effects weren't as good, and Wilma's character was changed from an heroic colonel to the damsel in distress. It's not surprising the show didn't do as well after that. I could see changing a show and cutting its budget if it's not doing well, but if something works, why the hell do they think they need to tamper with it?! But even though the second season wasn't as good as the first, I still found it enjoyable. Most of the stories were still good, and most of them were even taken more seriously apart from the episode ""Shgoratchx!"". And I really liked the new character Hawk played by Tom Christopher. So even though the first season was better, I still recommend Season Two because it was still a good sci-fi show. And even if you're a fan and don't like this season, I still recommend buying it mainly for the TV pilot. Just make sure you're buying a copy that actually has the pilot.",3,"Great to have the TV pilot, but I do NOT recommend buying online!",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,4035,"['first', 'copy', 'got', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'TV', 'pilot', 'said', 'included', 'TV', 'pilot', 'had', 'four', 'discs', 'When', 'got', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'pilot', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'discs', 'same', 'two', 'discs', 'were', 'included', 'Complete', 'Epic', 'Series', 'were', 'even', 'listed', 'Discs', '4', '5', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'buy', 'bought', 'mine', 'online', 'are', 'looking', 'TV', 'pilot', 'try', 'maybe', 'buying', 'new', 'store', 'rather', 'online', 'make', 'sure', 'pilot', 'cover', 'buying', 'got', 'bad', 'one', 'online', 'decided', 'look', 'new', 'stores', 'one', 'bought', 'store', 'actually', 'included', 'four', 'discs', 'TV', 'pilot', 'bonus', 'episode', 'final', 'disc.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'show', 'was', 'Buck', 'Rogers', '25th', 'Century', 'Complete', 'Epic', 'Series', 'included', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'only', 'had', 'theatrical', 'edit', 'pilot', 'made', 'two', 'edits', 'pilot', 'movie', 'edit', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'nearly', 'six', 'months', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'television', 'edit', 'aired', 'part', 'television', 'series', 'Now', 'have', 're-released', 'series', 'DVD', 'seasons', 'Season', 'One', 'still', 'only', 'theatrical', 'pilot', 'Season', 'Two', 'TV', 'pilot', 'bonus', 'episode', 'already', 'had', 'Complete', 'Epic', 'Series', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'being', 'fan', 'show', 'still', 'wanted', 'TV', 'pilot', 'well', 'bought', 'season', 'two', 'set', 'well.Although', 'do', 'prefer', 'theatrical', 'edit', 'still', 'wanted', 'TV', 'edit', 'too', 'Mainly', 'four', 'scenes', 'added', 'TV', 'version', '1', 'scene', 'where', 'Twiki', 'Theo', 'show', 'Buck', 'new', 'apartment', '2', 'Buck', 'inquiry', 'Anarkia', '25th', 'century', 'name', 'old', 'Chicago', '3', 'part', 'where', 'Wilma', 'Buck', 'helping', 'fight', 'pirates', 'then', 'Princess', 'denied', 'Buck', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'place', 'arrest', 'Buck', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'due', 'fact', 'nowhere', 'go', 'only', 'home', 'had', '500', 'years', 'past', '4', 'added', 'epilogue', 'scene', 'end', 'Buck', 'decorating', 'new', 'place', 'when', 'interrupted', 'Wilma', 'Dr.', 'Huer', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'join', 'Earth', 'Defense', 'Directorate', 'scenes', 'make', 'TV', 'version', 'buying', 'However', 'down', 'side', 'scene', 'Buck', 'fighting', 'Tigerman', 'trimmed', 'badly', 'edited', 'King', 'Draco', 'no', 'longer', 'story', 'cut', 'out', 'Kane', 'last', 'line', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'boom', 'mike', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'scene', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'featured', 'movie', 'boom', 'mike', 'not', 'appear', 'movie', 'version', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'edit', 'better', 'four', 'added', 'scenes', 'TV', 'version', 'still', 'got', 're-buy', 'season', 'already', 'have', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'watch', 'them.As', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'big', 'departure', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'doing', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'network', 'went', 'ahead', 'cut', 'show', 'budget', 'second', 'show', 'was', 'reformatted', 'have', 'more', 'Star', 'Trek', 'type', 'feel', 'got', 'rid', 'several', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Wilma', 'character', 'was', 'changed', 'heroic', 'colonel', 'damsel', 'distress', 'not', 'surprising', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'see', 'changing', 'show', 'cutting', 'budget', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'something', 'works', 'why', 'hell', 'do', 'think', 'need', 'tamper', 'even', 'second', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'Most', 'stories', 'were', 'still', 'good', 'most', 'were', 'even', 'taken', 'more', 'seriously', 'apart', 'episode', 'Shgoratchx', 'really', 'liked', 'new', 'character', 'Hawk', 'played', 'Tom', 'Christopher', 'So', 'even', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'recommend', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'even', ""'re"", 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'still', 'recommend', 'buying', 'mainly', 'TV', 'pilot', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'buying', 'copy', 'actually', 'pilot']",Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: Season Two
