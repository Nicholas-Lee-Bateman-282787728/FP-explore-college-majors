It even has the lead of ""Shaft"" make Shaft jokes(!!!) that aren't funny. O'Neal stars as a soldier whose buddy turns evil (Judd Nelson),and injures his friend Sparky (Sigourney Weaver lookalike Annabeth Gish) in the process. Unlike most superheroes, Steel doesn't become one until waaay late in the film. Luckily, Sparky gets a cool action sequence in which she blasts the bad guys with her weaponized wheel chair. That is an awesome scene. Steel blunders his way through it. This movie certainly heralded the end of comic book movies for a good long time,and for a good reason. It certainly wasn't comic.

101183,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,0790733269,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[2, 2]","Back in 2004, I found this at the bargain bin at K-Mart for a mere dollar and thought ""This might be a 'so bad it's good' romp to laugh at"" and boy was I wrong.  Steel was one of the most torturous cinematic experiences of my life.  I want my dollar back (I'm not kidding).For those of you too young to remember the 90's well enough, here's some history for you.  Back in the early 90's, Shaquille O' Neal was a rising star in the NBA, so much so, he got record deals to record several rap albums, have his own fighting-themed video game called Shaq Fu, and star in his own movies called Kazaam and Steel; all of which are blights to their respective categories.  His rap albums made rap fans scream in agony, Shaq Fu is the rightful whipping boy of video game enthusiasts, and his films are heavily (and rightfully) lambasted by film critics and forgotten by the public.  You know how in some vintage cartoons there would be a witch that would touch a plant and it would die on contact?  It seems like when Shaq touches anything not relating to basketball, it dies on contact.  Given how this cinematic dud still hasn't been released on DVD to this day, I'm certain that it never will since nobody old enough to remember it even remembers it that much.Now to the movie, it's absolutely awful.  The plot is okay, I guess, but given that no one really puts in any effort into their roles, it just makes you want to bash your head on your office desk.  For one, Shaq can't act if his life depended on it.  Of course, he's monotone 95% of the time but when he really does try to put emotion into his lines, it's unbelievably forced.  For example, the scene were army reject Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson) fires that soundwave cannon towards the beginning and when John Henry Irons (Shaq) screams out ""Nathaniel No!!"" is a joke.  Shaq also has the stiffest face in film, when his cop friend gets hurt in the line of duty and when Irons chases down one of the bank robbers armed with one of his high-tech weapons, he supposedly gets ""mad"" and says ""It's on"" but you can only tell by his lines and not his face.  Steel is also the most unimpressive superhero ever.  While good superheroes have flaws, Steel is nothing but flaws.  All he does is get shot at and fall like a corpse, not to mention that he's unbelievably slow when he moves.  The other characters aren't impressive at all, either.  For one, the gang members that Burke armed with Steel's weapons are rock stupid.  They break into a giant bank but instead of doing something bearing some semblance to realism by being quiet, they yell like Lil' Jon as they steal the money.While I'm not that hung up on imagery, the Steel costume is atrocious.  When he's threatening that thug  for stealing some stuff from that old, wealthy couple, you can tell when he's talking that his suit is made of rubber.  You'd think they'd at least put some effort in designing a decent costume.While I know that this is a superhero movie and not intended to be 100% realistic, I was quite annoyed by some severely illogical events in the movie.  When Steel confronts one of the bank robbers about where he got that shiny laser gun, the head gang member shoots him in the back with the same type of gun.  That same gun was able to shoot down a helicopter yet when Steel gets shot with it, he doesn't die from the blast, he doesn't even get severe burns from it!!  There's a scene towards the end that contains the worst ""Shaq can't make free throws"" joke in the movie (more on that later) where Steel and his nephew are trapped with a live grenade but they were able to perform a whole comedy routine before the grenade explodes.  If this had any shred of realism, the grenade would have exploded when Steel shouts ""I never make these!!""The humor is awful, just like everything else in this movie.  There's a constant barrage of hammy in-jokes about how Shaq can't shoot free throws that'll have you pulling your hair and groaning in agony.  Of course, the cherry on the s*** sundae has to be when Steel and his nephew get locked in that warehouse and are trapped with an armed grenade and the kid tells him to throw it through a small hole several feet above them, Steel utters ""I never make these!!""  Most of the ""humorous"" lines are blatantly stolen from other people.  Steel's assistant, Susan Sparks, steals ""It's not easy being green"" from the Muppets and the worst offense has to be when Steel activates his Electro Hammer and blurts out ""It's Hammer Time!!""  That right there shows desperation and creative bankruptcy because even back in 1997, MC Hammer was out of style and for this cinematic joke to steal from a horribly outdated musician will surely leave the serious film fan doing the ""face palm.""  When Steel's Uncle Joe (played by Richard Roundtree) says ""I particularly like the shaft"" about Steel's hammer, you'll be screaming to yourself ""Is this the best they can do?!!""Notice how I rated this 4% and not a 0%, that means there is SOME good in it, right?  Well, yes.  You're about to read my only ""glass is half-full"" take on this turkey.  The only remotely good parts in this movie were when Sparks attacks some bad guys with some weapons installed on her wheelchair and when Steel successfully makes a free throw with a grenade in that warehouse, one of Burke's henchman makes a pretty funny face as he sees the grenade and screams ""No!!,"" squeezed a little laughter out of me.I hope that there isn't some apologetic, new-found appreciation for this dreck because that's what happened to Howard the Duck and that rotten egg was released on DVD recently.  I hope Steel will NEVER be released on DVD because there's absolutely nothing remarkable about it and worth the waste of plastic to manufacture copies of a movie that NOBODY wants.  Okay, maybe if there was a Riff Trax version of Steel, then it MIGHT be worth having on DVD.You may be wondering what happened to my tape of Steel.  I didn't bother selling it on eBay since I know no one wants this movie, so I did the next best thing, I blew it up with a Furby on the Fourth of July.",1,A cinematic abomination of epic proportions.

Actually, it's so bad it's funny. The film stars Shaq. There are so many things wrong with that last sentence, mostly the part about Shaq being in a movie. Shaq is not a good actor. Heck, he isn't even decent. The movie's script doesn't help him much. He plays John Henry Irons, a retired soldier who learns of a madman's plot to sell high-powered weapons to other evil people. The madman is Judd Nelson. There are also so many things wrong with that sentence. Nelson is completely miscast here, and his performance is so weak, it wouldn't surprise me if the filmmakers tried to find someone who they knew would make Shaq look good. It doesn't matter. They both come out looking pretty ridiculous. The movie's only saving grace (except its unintentional humor) is Richard Roundtree. Roundtree steals the show and every scene he's in by just smiling and dealing with the fact that he's the only first-rate actor in a movie of second-rates. Sure, he's also unintentionally funny, but he's the only one in the cast who I think wanted to be. If you like cheesy movies with dumb plots and terrible acting, ""Steel"" is the place to go.

Though the album cover says, ""Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture"", it definitely lives up to the other various artists soundtracks that has been released in recent years. The only two songs that were actually played in the movie were Tevin Campbell's peace anthem, ""No More Fighting"", Shaquille O'Neal and Peter Gunz on the DJ Quik-produced ""Strait Playin' (Superman Remix)"" and S.H.E. (Shaquille O'Neal's girl group) with the moving, ""We Got Heart"". A few other tracks that should've made it in the movie are Mobb Deep's ""Mobb of Steel"" (the bad guys theme song), the ensemble rappers (Ice Cube, Shaquille O'Neal, B-Real of Cypress Hill, Peter Gunz and KRS-One) on the Trackmasters-produced hit tune, ""Men of Steel"" (ending credits song) and Spice 1's ""Mind on My Money"". Most of the other songs are decent too. It would've been great if they could've included Mervyn Warren's score on here, but beggers can't be choosers, can we?

101187,A1B9ISLYYCHIVE,0790733269,"The Curmudgeon ""Your life lacks purpose - my ...","[7, 11]","First of all, I apologise for reviewing a... gnnn, can't bring myself to even write it but.. must... a VHS version of this film. Ughh. Video - what WERE we thinking?  But I have to - because Steel has never been released on DVD (I collect comic book movies and TV shows on DVD, so I had to buy a copy of this on DVD). And you know what? I would bet my entire Spider-Man collection that it'll never see the light on DVD either. Whoever owns the rights to this is probably keeping it quiet through sheer embarrassment.Steel, then. Due to my collecting, I have seen some of the worst movies ever made - Batman and Robin. Popeye. Spawn. And now this, easily one of the very worst films of all time. Based on the DC comics character, the only mention of Superman (which this character originates from - Man Of Steel, geddit?) is from the tattoo on Shaquille O Neals arm. Which he already had in the first place.It's never actually explained WHY Shaq makes an outfit in the first place. I mean, if he wanted to tackle crime he could have done it just fine on his own. He was a seven foot mammoth guy, brave, able to smash phone boxes and windows just by touching them, so why he felt the need to design a costume that made him look like he was dressing up as Robocop for Halloween is anyone's guess.Ah yes - the costume. Let's talk about that for a minute. I can buy a lot of things in comic book movies (like the comics themselves, they need a certain degree of plausibility tolerance). A guy wants to dress up for no real reason to fight crime? Fair enough. Guy wants to dress in solid steel? (How does he move around?) Uh.. OK, usual level of DC rubbish I suppose. But the believability went right out the window when I saw the outfit. It might as well just have ""PLASTIC"" stamped all over it. It's PATHETIC. Quite easily the worst superhero costume of all time.Special mention must go to Shaq's sidekick, Uncle Joe (there are black people in this film, you see. So we need the cackling, wisecracking uncle, the ""mmmmm-hmmmmm!"" aunt who fusses and cooks, the ""don't be playa hatin'"" jive talking nephew.. all your black stereotypes in one horrendous movie).  Anyway, Uncle Joe is played by Richard Rowndtree, who played Shaft. Just in case you didn't know that, for some reason Uncle Joe is looking at Steels hammer and says ""I particularly like the shaft"" followed by a knowing silence. I think we're supposed to laugh, but it just sounds like old Uncle Joe was coming on to our hero.Subtle humour isn't exactly this films strong point. Throughout the movie, there are numerous attempts from Steel to throw certain things into or through other things - and always misses. Ha ha ha ha, isn't that really funny, that a professional basketball player would be so bad at things like that? Stop me laughing by killing me.There are absolutely no redeemable features in this movie. With a lot of comic book films, no matter how bad they are, I can always find one or two things to appreciate. With Man-Thing, they mentioned the Nexus Of Realities and Man-Thing himself looks pretty good. Supergirl - had at least a sense of continuity with the Superman films and, well, she looked pretty good in her costume too. With Steel?  Nothing. Plot wrong, characters wrong, script TERRIBLE, acting atrocious, costume laughable.. Just another 7 foot nail in the comic book movie coffin.I think I'll leave you with some sage advice from the movie, and an example of the writing quality that is present throughout.""Eat the hotdog.
