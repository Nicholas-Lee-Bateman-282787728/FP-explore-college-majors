Varied personalities and interactions kept it interesting.  Fleming and Raven are endearing and refreshing youngsters who act as foils for their senseless, violent elders.

I think this movie is relatable to many people, even if its characters and their tragic circumstances are exaggerated.  At least I hope they are!  Story of survival despite having all the cards stacked against you set against abject failure.

1430506,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B004W7D2A2,CGScammell,"[2, 3]","I was first intrigued with this movie because of the all-star cast, but quickly lost interest in this convoluted plot.  The first convolusion is using Kris Kristopherson as the leading man.  It's not about Kris K's character, it's about his grandson Fleming, a young man who dropped out of high school but who has a passion for writing.  Fleming spends most scenes in the beginning writing stories based on his short, dysfunctional life.  His grandfather had walked out on his grandmother 40 years ago to make his career in Nashville, leaving the wife to raise three sons.  These three sons, Brady, Boyd and Warren (Val Kilmer) are now three disgruntled men who sit around and drink, use women and curse somewhere in the backwoods of the piney woods.  Two of the sons seethe with anger and hate over their father.  The only son who seems to be the most like the dad is Warren.  The abandoned wife sits in the background with a vacuuous stare during most of the entire movie, saying only a few lines to Fleming  near the hour mark to fill in the blanks as to why her husband took off on her so many years ago.Cinematography  and scenery are nice (it was filmed in North Carolina), and so is the accompanying music, but the short and varied storyline seems to want to go everywhere too fast.  There's a disgruntled postalman, a flirtatious young woman, several mysterious townfolk and lots of old, run-down wooden homes.  Everyone isn't just flawed, they are seriously flawed and it's impossible to have any sympathy with any of the characters except for Fleming, who remains the only person who seems to have passion, sympathy and drive to get out of the life he's led sofar.The second convolusion is trying to understand why Kris' character would want to come back to this family that has been so inbred in these backwoods.  He gives the reason in a letter he sends his oldest son before his arrival, but somehow his reason doesn't come across as believable. There are too many redneck stereotypes in this plot that are an embarrassment to hillfolk of Tennessee.There are a few too many predictable scenes in this short movie, especially toward the end.  The only good thing out of this movie is that Fleming manages to get out of his miserable existence.  What is meant to be a bitter-sweet movie turns out to be a badly-written country flick.If you like country music or the music of Kris Kristopherson, you may enjoy this movie.",3,"Good Acting, Bad plot",1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,2431,"['was', 'first', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast', 'quickly', 'lost', 'interest', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'first', 'convolusion', 'using', 'Kris', 'Kristopherson', 'leading', 'man', 'not', 'Kris', 'K', 'character', 'grandson', 'Fleming', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dropped', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'passion', 'writing', 'Fleming', 'most', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'writing', 'stories', 'based', 'short', 'dysfunctional', 'life', 'grandfather', 'had', 'walked', 'out', 'grandmother', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'make', 'career', 'Nashville', 'leaving', 'wife', 'raise', 'three', 'sons', 'three', 'sons', 'Brady', 'Boyd', 'Warren', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'are', 'now', 'three', 'disgruntled', 'men', 'who', 'sit', 'drink', 'use', 'women', 'curse', 'somewhere', 'backwoods', 'piney', 'woods', 'Two', 'sons', 'seethe', 'anger', 'hate', 'father', 'only', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'most', 'dad', 'Warren', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'sits', 'background', 'vacuuous', 'stare', 'most', 'entire', 'movie', 'saying', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'Fleming', 'hour', 'mark', 'fill', 'blanks', 'why', 'husband', 'took', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago.Cinematography', 'scenery', 'are', 'nice', 'was', 'filmed', 'North', 'Carolina', 'so', 'accompanying', 'music', 'short', 'varied', 'storyline', 'want', 'go', 'everywhere', 'too', 'fast', 'disgruntled', 'postalman', 'flirtatious', 'young', 'woman', 'several', 'mysterious', 'townfolk', 'lots', 'old', 'run-down', 'wooden', 'homes', 'Everyone', ""n't"", 'just', 'flawed', 'are', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'impossible', 'have', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'Fleming', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'have', 'passion', 'sympathy', 'drive', 'get', 'life', 'led', 'sofar.The', 'second', 'convolusion', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'Kris', 'character', 'would', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'family', 'been', 'so', 'inbred', 'backwoods', 'reason', 'letter', 'oldest', 'son', 'arrival', 'somehow', 'reason', ""n't"", 'come', 'believable', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'redneck', 'stereotypes', 'plot', 'are', 'embarrassment', 'hillfolk', 'Tennessee.There', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'short', 'movie', 'especially', 'end', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'Fleming', 'manages', 'get', 'miserable', 'existence', 'What', 'meant', 'be', 'bitter-sweet', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'badly-written', 'country', 'flick.If', 'country', 'music', 'music', 'Kris', 'Kristopherson', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Bloodworth

There were some good actors too. The main problem is that none of the characters were allowed to develop enough to allow the viewer to be intrigued, or even interested. With better character development and clarity of purpose this would have been a tense, epic-like movie. It felt like much of the film was left on the cutting room floor -leaving big plot development gaps. I believe the novel, Provinces of Night, that this movie is based on is probably real good.

It gives the top billing to either Kris Kristofferson or Val Kilmer but they're more supporting cast than main characters of this film. The journey really centers on Fleming Bloodworth portrayed aptly by Reece Thompson. Not a spectacular performance, but not one that gets in the way of the story. Hilary Duff plays a captivating role as his love interest. W. Earl Brown (formerly of Deadwood) gives an electric performance in a not-so-nice role. Kilmer manages to wear a cowboy hat and talk in an accent and not remind us of his role of Doc Holiday in Tombstone (which was amazing). Dwight Yoakam continues to amaze me with his ability to give incredible ""reality"" to his performances. I think he may be one of the most under-rated actors ever (see Slingblade and tell me otherwise!).This film is, at its core, a coming of age picture. The problem is that it's set amidst a family tragedy that I don't ever feel is solved. When cut deeper, we're left with a lead character who really for no logical reason or reason we can see and experience comes of age and moves on.
