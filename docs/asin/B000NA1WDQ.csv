However, when you try to watch them, it says they are on the B side of the DVD. The only thing on the B side of the DVD is Michael. I suspect they took the A side from the regular wide screen edition of City of Angels, and instead of that B side just threw on Michael.I like both movies, and for both movies the price is pretty good.

My husband and I just finished watching both movies and we liked it.City of Angel's is a touching movie. Seth being an angel goes to the hospital to take a soul back with him. That is when he meets Maggy, who is a doctor. Seth falls in love with Maggy. He shows him self to her and becomes part of her life. Seth also hangs around Mr. Messenger because he is one of Maggy's patients. Seth finds out Mr. Messenger use to be an angel, but he jumped off a building to become human. Because he also fall in love with a human, who is his wife. Maggy finds out Seth is an angel at the same time Maggy's doctor boy friend propose to her. She tells Seth, who she is in love with, that she can't deal with him not being able to feel her touch but she is able to feel his. She tells him she was proposed to and is leaving to Tahoe to get married. Seth doesn't take the news very well and decided to jump off a building to become human. Once he is human who goes far to find Maggy alone in a cabin in Tahoe. They share a romantic night together. The next day Maggy rides her bike to a little local story for groceries. Maggy get's distracted with the fresh air. A truck caring wood longs crosses her path. Maggy hits the truck and dies in Seth's arms. It is very sad that Seth gave up being an angel for the love of his life and looses her the next day. Very touching movie that you must see.Michael isn't an ordinary angel. He smokes, drinks, sleeps with woman, and is a total crack up. Three news paper reporters, go to a small town where Michael is living with an old lady. The old lady dies and Michael sets off with the three people to Chicago. Michael requested to stop to see some crazy stuff on the way. He even get's in a fight at a bar and everyone has to sleep in jail. Michael purpose is to help two people fall in love with each other. The ending was a little boring.
