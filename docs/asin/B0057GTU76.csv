This is a brilliant little film in my estimation: it manipulates all of our expectations about who these characters are and what ""normal"" is. Indeed, ""normal"" doesn't really fit in anywhere, with a sexual serial killer on the loose, a goofy but well-intentioned new neighbor and a heroine who will shock your socks off.Spencer is charming, smooth and outrageously handsome, but there is something incredibly menacing in his smile and his playful cruelty from the start. (The scene where he ""romances"" Louise's co-worker from the Chinese restaurant is blood-curdling.) Victor, a nerdy and sweet newcomer to the apartment building, is clumsily gallant and lives in  his delusional desire; Louise is quirky yet deadpan and afectless except when it comes to loving felines, but cold-blooded and willing to go a long, long way to get what she wants. And then there's the awful and hilarious alcoholic neighbor who hates all people and cats and who spouts obscenities non-stop, two cops tracking the serial killer, and two kindly middle-aged women who haven't got a clue about what's going on.The normal and the abnormal are so seamlessly woven together in this movie that I was somewhat left with my jaw dropping: I really loved the way it creates a hero and a heroine while at the same time it tends to blur the line between what makes a sexually sadistic serial killer different from...everyone else...

It's a tight, nifty package of a movie.Set in Quebec during the holidays, and while a vote is taking place on whether or not they should secede from Canada, a few residents of an apartment building are nervous over the fact a serial killer is on the loose in their neighborhood. Scott Speedman as Spencer is in a wheelchair due to a car accident. Jay Baruchel as Victor, is an elementary school teacher just back from China and new to the building. Emily Hampshire as Loise waits tables at the local Chinese restaurant and owns two way cool cats. Their lives intersect in a quirky way as they grapple with the varying things going on around them.This is a darkly funny movie. It's laced with good characters. The two cats have an enormous amount of personality and the story turns in some unexpected ways. I was fairly certain on the killer's identity but that turns out not to be as important as the way things play out. You find out who he is pretty early on in the third act so there is nearly another half hour for other things to happen. Speedman is good. He walks a fine line between being glib and being just plain nasty. I liked Emily Hamshire in ""Snow Cake"" and she's equally good here. Her relationship with her cats really adds quirk to the story. Jay Barushel might be playing the schlub card a bit too strongly but he's still good.I found this to be written well, directed well, acted well and sporting a good music score.

The exception is not because of any horrific scenes, of which they were all implied, but for the lack of an alternate ending amongst which I would have preferred one particular ending.So, here is my thought on ending the movie. Since semen was on the cat hating (actually hating everything and one) person's body the police should have, but didn't (in their customary dumb ass movie portrayal) collect and compare amongst all the victims. Having done so they would have found two killers and not one. That would have left only the latest killer to pursue her cat loving ways.

But it is just attempting to establish character, at least the character we normally see without secrets. The ""action"" takes place in an apartment building with 3 English speaking people living in French Canada. Louise (Emily Hampshire) lives alone with 2 cats with which she has bonded. The rest of her neighbors loathe her cats. She works at a local Chinese restaurant within walking distance.Spencer (Scott Speedman) is a large blond confined to a wheel chair. We later find out he was married and his wife died in the same wreak that confined him to said chair. He is considered a hunk by the older women in the building and they suspect that he and Louise would one day get together. He loves fish (live or cooked). He has anger management issues which sometimes slip out. While he is in a wheel chair, his legs are normal as there appears to be no reason for him to be in the wheel chair.Victor (Jay Baruchel) is the new guy in the building. He is a bit spastic and is irritating with his constant chatter. He develops a love for Emily which is not returned.There is a serial killer in the city and Louise is obsessed with the thought as her friend at the cafe was a recent victim. The victim had a date that night with a large blond guy named ""Roland."" A large guy named ""Roland"" is also conducting the investigation. The French Canadian woman who lives in the building is shown in a bad light and provides some inner conflict.As events unfolded and made the characters more interesting and improbable, I found myself still waiting for things to happen. Magnolia generally does the feel good Indie films with a fitting lame acoustical sound track. In this film they were clueless about a decent sound track, something that would have added to the film. I would not call this a ""noir"" film or a ""thriller"" as does the DVD hype. It is an indie with typical quirky characters, a movie heavy on building characters and light on action. Might make for a rental if you really love Indie films and cats.F-bomb, sex, nudity. The rating claims ""strong violence and graphic nudity"" which are perhaps over statements.

It sounded like the perfect movie for me and I couldn't wait to see it! Good Neighbors is about an apartment building in Canada that is getting a new tenant named Victor (Jay Baruchel). Victor immediately sees that something isn't right about the new place and soon learns that everyone is on edge because of a serial killer on the loose. A serial killer that I was able to identify ten minutes into the movie. How in the world can anyone, much less a movie fan, call this a thriller with a twist in the end? The killer was obvious from the very beginning and I'm willing to bet the average fourth grader would agree. As for the notion that this is a thriller? Come on, a thriller is supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, not falling asleep in it! The story was slow, sloppy, and predictable, but what about the acting. I generally like Jay Baruchel, but he is a mess in this film. Baruchel is way out of his element here and would probably do best sticking to Apatow comedies. The only bright spot in the film is Emily Hampshire, she's been around a while, but has never been in anything big. Hampshire was terrific and is really the only interesting character in this film. Good Neighbors is a huge disappointment and anyone who tells you otherwise can't be as big a movie fan as they proclaim to be.

It's a film where from the start it is not very clear, what kind of story is being told, and when it concludes, some key questions remain unanswered.  Set in Montreal in 1995, the story is centered on three people who live in an apartment building, and are each a bit strange in their own particular ways.  Major spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Louise (Emmy Hampshire,Snow Cake) a waitress at a Chinese restaurant, spends her spare time caring for her cats, and following the exploits of a serial killer, who's victims come to include one of her coworkers.  Louise, who lives on the third floor, is feuding with her bitchy French speaking neighbor Valerie (Anne-Marie Cadieux,Far Side of the Moon), because of the activities of her cats.  Affable and quick witted, wheelchair bound Spencer (Scott Speedman,Underworld (2003)) is Louise's friend.  He lives on the second floor of a building, which apparently has no elevator.  When schoolteacher Victor (Jay Baruchel,She's Out of My League) moves into an apartment on the fourth floor, he begins to alter the existing dynamic, attempting to start a relationship with Louise.  Although it isn't true, a delusional Victor tells those close to him, that she is his fianc&eacute;e.The situation changes drastically, when Louise's cats are found dead.  Believing that Valerie is responsible, Louise brutally kills her neighbor, in a very messy, nasty, and realistic fashion.  This is followed by a sexual assault on the corpse, as her plan is to blame the murder on the notorious serial killer.  This unlikely ploy is complicated by both Spencer and Victor, who each have quite different takes on the situation.  This leads to a dramatic and somewhat unsetting resolution.The actions of the warped characters, makes for a tale where the pieces don't fit together very nicely.  Victor is kind of a nut case who does odd things, like attempting to install a wheelchair lift on the staircase, as a ""surprise"" gift to Spencer.  A cold calculating killer, Louise is a strange creature, whose selfish actions and cunning, drive much of what happens.  Spencer has his own dark secrets, living some farfetched double life.  How the serial killer really figures in isn't clear, as things end rather conveniently, which may leave some confused, or perhaps frustrated.Despite any issues with the story, the acting performances are very solid, drawing you into a world with assorted odd characters.  Standing out is Emmy Hampshire's wide ranging and dynamic performance, as a woman capable of great ruthlessness, who seems to relate best to cats rather than people.",3,"a strange little movie, that leaves much unanswered...",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2741,"['like', 'things', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neatly', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'quirky', 'suspense/comedy', 'Good', 'Neighbours', '2010', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'film', 'where', 'start', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'when', 'key', 'questions', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'Set', 'Montreal', '1995', 'story', 'centered', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'apartment', 'building', 'are', 'bit', 'strange', 'own', 'particular', 'ways', 'Major', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.Louise', 'Emmy', 'Hampshire', 'Snow', 'Cake', 'waitress', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'spare', 'time', 'caring', 'cats', 'following', 'exploits', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'come', 'include', 'one', 'coworkers', 'Louise', 'who', 'third', 'floor', 'feuding', 'bitchy', 'French', 'speaking', 'neighbor', 'Valerie', 'Anne-Marie', 'Cadieux', 'Far', 'Side', 'Moon', 'activities', 'cats', 'Affable', 'quick', 'witted', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'Spencer', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Underworld', '2003', 'Louise', 'friend', 'second', 'floor', 'building', 'apparently', 'elevator', 'When', 'schoolteacher', 'Victor', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'My', 'League', 'apartment', 'fourth', 'floor', 'alter', 'existing', 'dynamic', 'attempting', 'start', 'relationship', 'Louise', ""n't"", 'true', 'delusional', 'Victor', 'tells', 'close', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'situation', 'changes', 'drastically', 'when', 'Louise', 'cats', 'are', 'found', 'dead', 'Believing', 'Valerie', 'responsible', 'Louise', 'brutally', 'neighbor', 'very', 'messy', 'nasty', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'followed', 'sexual', 'assault', 'corpse', 'plan', 'blame', 'murder', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'unlikely', 'ploy', 'complicated', 'Spencer', 'Victor', 'who', 'have', 'quite', 'different', 'situation', 'dramatic', 'somewhat', 'unsetting', 'resolution.The', 'actions', 'warped', 'characters', 'tale', 'where', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'very', 'nicely', 'Victor', 'kind', 'nut', 'case', 'who', 'odd', 'things', 'attempting', 'install', 'wheelchair', 'lift', 'staircase', 'surprise', 'gift', 'Spencer', 'A', 'cold', 'calculating', 'killer', 'Louise', 'strange', 'creature', 'selfish', 'actions', 'cunning', 'drive', 'much', 'what', 'Spencer', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets', 'living', 'farfetched', 'double', 'life', 'How', 'serial', 'killer', 'really', 'figures', ""n't"", 'clear', 'things', 'end', 'rather', 'conveniently', 'may', 'leave', 'confused', 'perhaps', 'frustrated.Despite', 'issues', 'story', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'drawing', 'world', 'assorted', 'odd', 'characters', 'Standing', 'out', 'Emmy', 'Hampshire', 'wide', 'ranging', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'woman', 'capable', 'great', 'ruthlessness', 'who', 'relate', 'best', 'cats', 'rather', 'people']",N/A

Although the story also takes place in Montreal, and writer/director Jacob Tierney is working with some of the same actors, this story is much darker and its view of human nature is a lot less upbeat -- Jay Baruchel and Emily Hampshire are playing very different characters this time around. Let's face it ... the resident cats are the nicest creatures you encounter in the main setting, a run-down apartment building in the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grce, or NDG. As in his previous work, Tierney's unapologetic about the Canadian setting, and doesn't try to pass it off as some generic US city. There are numerous references to the English-French cultural conflicts, in the months during and after the Quebec referendum in 1995. The dreary cold winter helps accentuate the isolation that the building's occupants are experiencing. On the surface, the story would appear to be about the friendships that new arrival Victor (Jay Baruchel) makes when he moves in. But the key characters are all flawed in some way -- hostile, delusional, passive-aggressive -- and inevitably the tense situation deteriorates. I don't want to give away too much, but people who are really turned off by onscreen violence, to the point of having nightmares if things get too graphic, may want to skip the last half of the film. Aside from that, it's a fascinating character study about the interactions of a group of troubled people. Some of them seem to be textbook examples of what psychologists like Robert Hare have been trying to warn us about. There is some comedy, but it's appropriately dark and disturbed. There's an extended nude scene, but given what leads up to it, people may find it more ominous than titillating. Really, by the end of the film I was just grateful that I don't live in that building!",4,"Offbeat psychological thriller, more than a bit twisted",1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1891,"['people', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Trotsky', 'be', 'warned', 'story', 'also', 'place', 'Montreal', 'writer/director', 'Jacob', 'Tierney', 'working', 'same', 'actors', 'story', 'much', 'darker', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'lot', 'less', 'upbeat', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Emily', 'Hampshire', 'are', 'playing', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'time', 'around', 'Let', 'face', 'resident', 'cats', 'are', 'nicest', 'creatures', 'encounter', 'main', 'setting', 'run-down', 'apartment', 'building', 'neighbourhood', 'Notre-Dame-de-Grce', 'NDG', 'previous', 'work', 'Tierney', 'unapologetic', 'Canadian', 'setting', ""n't"", 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'generic', 'US', 'city', 'are', 'numerous', 'references', 'English-French', 'cultural', 'conflicts', 'months', 'Quebec', 'referendum', '1995', 'dreary', 'cold', 'winter', 'accentuate', 'isolation', 'building', 'occupants', 'are', 'experiencing', 'surface', 'story', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'friendships', 'new', 'arrival', 'Victor', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'when', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'way', 'hostile', 'delusional', 'passive-aggressive', 'inevitably', 'tense', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'turned', 'off', 'onscreen', 'violence', 'point', 'having', 'nightmares', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'graphic', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Aside', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'interactions', 'group', 'troubled', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'textbook', 'examples', 'what', 'psychologists', 'Robert', 'Hare', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'warn', 'about', 'comedy', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'disturbed', 'extended', 'nude', 'scene', 'given', 'what', 'up', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'ominous', 'titillating', 'Really', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'grateful', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'building']",N/A

Good Neighbors is a really entertaining movie.  It's a bit off-beat and quirky but great characters, well acted and very interesting. I thought the dialogue was fun and the relationship between the three main characters engrossing.
