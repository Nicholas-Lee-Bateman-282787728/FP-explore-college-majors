Black,"[0, 0]","Almost no one associated with ""The Paradine Case"" was pleased by the result: not Selznick, who produced it as the last of a what turned out to be a three-picture deal with Hitchcock for his studio (the others being ""Rebecca"" and ""Spellbound""); not the director, whose motives for accepting the project seemed fuzzy even to him in hindsight; not Gregory Peck, who claimed to have liked it least of all his films. ""Paradine"" is no Hitchcock classic; yet neither is it a dud. Though dated, it is a handsomely mounted, interesting study of obsession that ""Vertigo"" would deliver in spades a decade later. This film also features Charles Laughton, stealing the show in a supporting role, and Louis Jordan in his film debut. (Note: Because this film is currently so hard to find on DVD, I took a chance on a Chinese import and was not disappointed.)",3,An Interesting Misfire,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,843,"['Almost', 'one', 'associated', 'Paradine', 'Case', 'was', 'pleased', 'result', 'not', 'Selznick', 'who', 'produced', 'last', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'three-picture', 'deal', 'Hitchcock', 'studio', 'others', 'being', 'Rebecca', 'Spellbound', 'not', 'director', 'motives', 'accepting', 'project', 'seemed', 'fuzzy', 'even', 'hindsight', 'not', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'claimed', 'have', 'liked', 'least', 'films', 'Paradine', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'dud', 'dated', 'handsomely', 'mounted', 'interesting', 'study', 'obsession', 'Vertigo', 'would', 'deliver', 'spades', 'decade', 'later', 'film', 'also', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'stealing', 'show', 'supporting', 'role', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'film', 'debut', 'Note', 'film', 'currently', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'DVD', 'took', 'chance', 'Chinese', 'import', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed']",Alfred Hitchcock - The Paradine Case
935610,A20JYIHL1W1U54,B000AZ6H6Q,"hille2000 ""hille2000""","[8, 8]","Misinterpreted and forgotten, THE PARADINE CASE is an opulent production concerning the elegant and strikingly sculptured and inscrutable Mrs. Paradine placed on trial for the murder of her husband. Mrs. Paradine is played with delicate radiance by Alida Valli who embodies the alluring vision of pulchritude that barrister Gregory Peck has created and fallen under the spell of. Gregory Peck's obsessive character is a forerunner to James Stewart's role in Hitchcock's VERTIGO. Obsessive behavior can be destructive as is seen in the relationship that Peck has with his loyal wife portrayed by Ann Todd. However, the greatest role and performance in this film is in the form of Louis Jourdan. Jourdan is an unwavering curiosity in his quixotic role as Mr. Paradine's manservant. His relationship with Mrs. Paradine and her late husband remains a conundrum. Jourdan's performance as a man of steadfast loyalty to both duty and passion is one of brilliance. Alfred Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE is a film that is by some means misinterpreted and thus forgotten.",5,Misinterpreted and Forgotten,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,1060,"['Misinterpreted', 'forgotten', 'PARADINE', 'CASE', 'opulent', 'production', 'concerning', 'elegant', 'strikingly', 'sculptured', 'inscrutable', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'placed', 'trial', 'murder', 'husband', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'played', 'delicate', 'radiance', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'who', 'alluring', 'vision', 'pulchritude', 'barrister', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'created', 'fallen', 'spell', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'obsessive', 'character', 'forerunner', 'James', 'Stewart', 'role', 'Hitchcock', 'VERTIGO', 'Obsessive', 'behavior', 'can', 'be', 'destructive', 'seen', 'relationship', 'Peck', 'loyal', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'However', 'greatest', 'role', 'performance', 'film', 'form', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'Jourdan', 'unwavering', 'curiosity', 'quixotic', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Paradine', 'manservant', 'relationship', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'late', 'husband', 'conundrum', 'Jourdan', 'performance', 'man', 'steadfast', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'passion', 'one', 'brilliance', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'THE', 'PARADINE', 'CASE', 'film', 'means', 'misinterpreted', 'thus', 'forgotten']",Alfred Hitchcock - The Paradine Case

935612,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,B000AZ6H6Q,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[1, 1]","Like the other reviewers here, I agree that this truly adult and enigmatic Hitchcock film has never gotten the attention it deserves. Tony Keane's fixation with the accused murderer Mrs. Paradine looks ahead to Scottie Fergusson's equally obsessed one with Madeleine in Vertigo. In a way, marriage and femininity are also on trial in this film. Mrs. Paradine marries a man she doesn't love for his money and ends going on trial for murder. Keane's wife Gay is loving, but she's also an enabler, endlessly making excuses for Tony's poor behavior as a husband (and lack of professionalism as a barrister). She stands by her man . . . but why? Gay's friend Judy is an unmarried woman who, denied a chance to be a lawyer because of her gender, provides Gay (and us) with her shrewd commentary on Tony's courtroom behavior. But will any man ever want to marry such an outspoken young woman? Maybe the most pathetic female character is the judge's wife, who passively puts up with his crude misogyny. Only when Mrs. Paradine is threatened with the gallows does she begin to confront the emotional deadness of her own marriage. None of the women (not to mention all the dour female courtroom attendants that Hitchcock's camera lingers over) are at real peace with themselves.The two main male characters, (Tony  and Andre) are, in a sense, contaminated by the women's malaise. Tony is accused by the judge of creating an ""overly emotional"" atmosphere in the courtroom. And the sexually ambiguous Andr&eacute;'s acts are driven solely by love. In the end, Keane's drained and vulnerable character foreshadows the equally drained Fergusson we see at the end of Vertigo. Neither man knows what hit them. But have they learned anything from their experience? And will they ever have the capacity to relate to women who haven't been through what Judy astutely calls ""the mud""? The verdict's still out.",5,Obession On Trial,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,1889,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'agree', 'truly', 'adult', 'enigmatic', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'never', 'gotten', 'attention', 'Tony', 'Keane', 'fixation', 'accused', 'murderer', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'ahead', 'Scottie', 'Fergusson', 'equally', 'obsessed', 'one', 'Madeleine', 'Vertigo', 'way', 'marriage', 'femininity', 'are', 'also', 'trial', 'film', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'man', ""n't"", 'love', 'money', 'going', 'trial', 'murder', 'Keane', 'wife', 'Gay', 'loving', 'also', 'enabler', 'endlessly', 'making', 'excuses', 'Tony', 'poor', 'behavior', 'husband', 'lack', 'professionalism', 'barrister', 'man', 'why', 'Gay', 'friend', 'Judy', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'who', 'denied', 'chance', 'be', 'lawyer', 'gender', 'Gay', 'shrewd', 'commentary', 'Tony', 'courtroom', 'behavior', 'will', 'man', 'ever', 'want', 'marry', 'outspoken', 'young', 'woman', 'Maybe', 'most', 'pathetic', 'female', 'character', 'judge', 'wife', 'who', 'passively', 'up', 'crude', 'misogyny', 'Only', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Paradine', 'threatened', 'gallows', 'begin', 'confront', 'emotional', 'deadness', 'own', 'marriage', 'None', 'women', 'not', 'mention', 'dour', 'female', 'courtroom', 'attendants', 'Hitchcock', 'camera', 'are', 'real', 'peace', 'themselves.The', 'two', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'Tony', 'Andre', 'are', 'sense', 'contaminated', 'women', 'malaise', 'Tony', 'accused', 'judge', 'creating', 'overly', 'emotional', 'atmosphere', 'courtroom', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'acts', 'are', 'driven', 'solely', 'love', 'end', 'Keane', 'drained', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'equally', 'drained', 'Fergusson', 'see', 'end', 'Vertigo', 'man', 'what', 'hit', 'have', 'learned', 'anything', 'experience', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'capacity', 'relate', 'women', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'what', 'Judy', 'astutely', 'mud', 'verdict', 'still', 'out']",Alfred Hitchcock - The Paradine Case

Not as well known as many of his, this movie is more subtle than ""The Birds"" or ""Witness for the Prosecution"", but all the more wonderful for that.  A study in personality and relationships rather than blood, gore and destruction make it more satisfying (in my opinion).
