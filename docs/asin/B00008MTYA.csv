Very enjoyable and pretty well written/scripted, and the historical side of the story is educational too. Basically, a fairly solid and more than satisfactory documentary as one would expect from National Geographic. If you plan to choose an Everest DVD for family viewing then this is, in my opinion, the one to get.

745362,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00008MTYA,Randy Keehn,"[70, 71]","Ever since I read the fascinating book ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer, I have maintained an interest in Mt. Everest.  I read several more books on the subject (and the tragedy that Krakauer wrote of).  I also saw a few documentaries and a terrible ""made-for-TV"" movie on the tragedy.  I saw the I-Max movie and still, I always looked forward reading or watching anything else I could find.  ""Everest-50 Years on the Mountain"" is as good a visual presentation as any I've seen (the I-Max movie aside).  It tells of the attempt by the sons of Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary to climb Mt. Everest together.  I didn't really find their story all that compelling but it was as good an excuse as any other to put this National Geographic special together.  What I did enjoy was the background information, especially about the Sherpas, and how they were able to include a lot of historical film into the story.  Most of all, I enjoyed the film of the mountain and the climb that was documented.  The photography was fantastic as well as instructive.  It helped me retrace the steps that Krakauer and company took in ""Into Thin Air"" by showing what he wrote of.  The climb to the Hillary Step was very instructive by showing just how much exertion and rest was required to take three or four steps.  The crowds that Krakauer commented on were there as well as the bored millionaire looking for something different to do.  However, we were not burdened by having to follow the millionaire, we were able to focus on a group of men who made the story all the more interesting.  We saw them at their best and sometimes at their not so best.I have looked more and more these days for the sort of National Gepgraphic specials that I used to covet seeing when I was growing up.  The Society has expanded more into history these days (or so I judge from the available DVD's on Amazon.com).  Maybe that's because the wilderness has been tamed too much to compell us like it used to.  However, I found ""Everest-50 Years on the Mountain"" to be the quality of special that I was looking for.  I'll be watching this one again and again.",5,"Good Visuals, Good Background Information",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2123,"['Ever', 'read', 'fascinating', 'book', 'Into', 'Thin', 'Air', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'have', 'maintained', 'interest', 'Mt', 'Everest', 'read', 'several', 'more', 'books', 'subject', 'tragedy', 'Krakauer', 'wrote', 'also', 'saw', 'few', 'documentaries', 'terrible', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'saw', 'I-Max', 'movie', 'still', 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'reading', 'watching', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'find', 'Everest-50', 'Years', 'Mountain', 'as', 'good', 'visual', 'presentation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'I-Max', 'movie', 'aside', 'attempt', 'sons', 'Tenzing', 'Norgay', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'climb', 'Mt', 'Everest', 'together', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'story', 'compelling', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'excuse', 'other', 'put', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'together', 'What', 'did', 'enjoy', 'was', 'background', 'information', 'especially', 'Sherpas', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'include', 'lot', 'historical', 'film', 'story', 'Most', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'mountain', 'climb', 'was', 'documented', 'photography', 'was', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'instructive', 'helped', 'retrace', 'steps', 'Krakauer', 'company', 'took', 'Into', 'Thin', 'Air', 'showing', 'what', 'wrote', 'climb', 'Hillary', 'Step', 'was', 'very', 'instructive', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'exertion', 'rest', 'was', 'required', 'take', 'three', 'four', 'steps', 'crowds', 'Krakauer', 'commented', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'bored', 'millionaire', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'do', 'However', 'were', 'not', 'burdened', 'having', 'follow', 'millionaire', 'were', 'able', 'focus', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'saw', 'best', 'sometimes', 'not', 'so', 'best.I', 'have', 'looked', 'more', 'more', 'days', 'sort', 'National', 'Gepgraphic', 'specials', 'used', 'covet', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Society', 'expanded', 'more', 'history', 'days', 'so', 'judge', 'available', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com', 'wilderness', 'been', 'tamed', 'too', 'much', 'compell', 'used', 'However', 'found', 'Everest-50', 'Years', 'Mountain', 'be', 'quality', 'special', 'was', 'looking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'again', 'again']",N/A

745364,A3K0S346DLN9JM,B00008MTYA,terrylynn,"[1, 1]","After reading a couple of books written about events/tragedies that occurred on Everest, I was anxious to order this DVD from Amazon and learn more about it's awe inspiring history. But this DVD was not exactly what I was expecting. NG followed an expedition to Everest that included the sons of past climbers, including the famous Sir Edmund Hillary who was the first to breach the summit in 1953.  His son Peter makes the journey this time with anecdotes about his father's journey and all it entailed. There is some interesting footage from his father's trip and a little family history thrown in to help describe their relationship to the mountain and the Sherpa Village they are very involved with.  Also highlighted in the video is the son of the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay who was with Hilliary when they made those historic first steps. A large portion of the film is spent on the Sherpa village and the history of its people and their complicated relationship with the mountain.  Although this was interesting, I felt that too much time and emphasis was placed on this particular aspect to the detriment of the history of Everest itself.  Brent Bishop, the son of the first American to summit Everest is also on the trip and offers some poignant insight into his feelings about his father's accomplishment and how much he has missed him since his death. This is especially sad for him since Brent is there to witness Peter Hillary's jubilant call to his father, Sir Edmund as he sits on the Summit.Mount Everest is a fascinating topic for many reasons, not the least of which is the skill, strength and fortitude it takes to climb it, and the incredible risks faced by anyone who undertakes the challenge. Everest's history is full of the tragedy and triumph, the exacting weather and what it demands of its climbers, mentally, physically and even spiritually and this is what I found to be lacking in this presentation.  Any documentary entitled Everest - 50 years on the Mountain, is incomplete and even misleading if it doesn't mention in greater detail the history of the expeditions that make the legends of Everest what it is.  The 15 deaths in 1996 are barely given a mention, although it remains a huge part of the mountain's history and lore. This is not to take anything away from Sir Edmund Hillary's historic breach of the Summit.  It was and always will be one of the most extraordinary challenges ever accomplished by man against his environment.  But this film missed an opportunity to tell us what has happened and continues to happen on Everest since that historic day in 1953 and there are many tales worth the telling.",3,"Ok, But Not Really A Balanced View of Everest's History....",1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,2641,"['reading', 'couple', 'books', 'written', 'events/tragedies', 'occurred', 'Everest', 'was', 'anxious', 'order', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'learn', 'more', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'history', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'NG', 'followed', 'expedition', 'Everest', 'included', 'sons', 'past', 'climbers', 'including', 'famous', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'breach', 'summit', '1953', 'son', 'Peter', 'journey', 'time', 'anecdotes', 'father', 'journey', 'entailed', 'interesting', 'footage', 'father', 'trip', 'little', 'family', 'history', 'thrown', 'help', 'describe', 'relationship', 'mountain', 'Sherpa', 'Village', 'are', 'very', 'involved', 'Also', 'highlighted', 'video', 'son', 'Sherpa', 'Tenzing', 'Norgay', 'who', 'was', 'Hilliary', 'when', 'made', 'historic', 'first', 'steps', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'spent', 'Sherpa', 'village', 'history', 'people', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'mountain', 'was', 'interesting', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'emphasis', 'was', 'placed', 'particular', 'aspect', 'detriment', 'history', 'Everest', 'Brent', 'Bishop', 'son', 'first', 'American', 'summit', 'Everest', 'also', 'trip', 'poignant', 'insight', 'feelings', 'father', 'accomplishment', 'how', 'much', 'missed', 'death', 'especially', 'sad', 'Brent', 'there', 'witness', 'Peter', 'Hillary', 'jubilant', 'call', 'father', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'Summit.Mount', 'Everest', 'fascinating', 'topic', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'skill', 'strength', 'fortitude', 'climb', 'incredible', 'risks', 'faced', 'anyone', 'who', 'challenge', 'Everest', 'history', 'full', 'tragedy', 'triumph', 'exacting', 'weather', 'what', 'climbers', 'mentally', 'physically', 'even', 'spiritually', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'lacking', 'presentation', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Everest', '50', 'years', 'Mountain', 'incomplete', 'even', 'misleading', ""n't"", 'mention', 'greater', 'detail', 'history', 'expeditions', 'make', 'legends', 'Everest', 'what', '15', 'deaths', '1996', 'are', 'barely', 'given', 'mention', 'huge', 'part', 'mountain', 'history', 'lore', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'historic', 'breach', 'Summit', 'was', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'challenges', 'ever', 'accomplished', 'man', 'environment', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'happened', 'happen', 'Everest', 'historic', 'day', '1953', 'are', 'many', 'tales', 'telling']",N/A
