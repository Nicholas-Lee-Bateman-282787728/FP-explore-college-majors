And not having known previous portrayals of the merceny spy I liked Val Kilmer's turn as I happen to like just about anything he does. Plus I liked Elisabeth Shue. The plot is kinda weak, lacking in logic in the tradition of fantasy action films. Sometimes, for one reason or another, that is annoying and sometimes it isn't. It would be nice if the world had an energy source like cold fusion right now which is what Kilmer's thief is after. Buy it? Can't say I would, but if ya dig spy/thief movies or think Val Kilmer is a talented cat it's at least rental worthy.",3,"Val Kilmer, Elisabeth Shue have fusion",1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,719,"['Freed', 'knowledge', 'popular', 'character', 'left', 'enjoy', 'THE', 'SAINT', 'own', 'merits', 'enjoyed', 'light', 'escapist', 'spy', 'flick', 'back', '90s', 'not', 'having', 'known', 'previous', 'portrayals', 'merceny', 'spy', 'liked', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'turn', 'happen', 'like', 'just', 'anything', 'liked', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'plot', 'kinda', 'weak', 'lacking', 'logic', 'tradition', 'fantasy', 'action', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'reason', 'annoying', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'world', 'had', 'energy', 'source', 'cold', 'fusion', 'right', 'now', 'what', 'Kilmer', 'thief', 'Buy', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'ya', 'dig', 'spy/thief', 'movies', 'think', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'talented', 'cat', 'least', 'rental', 'worthy']",The Saint VHS

427700,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,6304535570,Adam,"[0, 0]","This film attempts to remake and update Leslie Charteris' character of Simon Templar (aka: The Saint.) In this modern setting, the Saint is still a criminal who hasn't gone straight and finds himself entangled in issues in post-Soviet Russia where control of energy is vital to the future and evil Communist turned evil Billionaire is planning to topple the government by obtaining the secret to cold fusion. The Saint must obtain the secret from Doctor Emma Russell (played by Elizabeth Shue).Positives: The film does a great job with its location work, bringing to life Russia in Winter with all its cold and grittiness. Elizabeth Shue's character is pretty well-crafted, cutting against the grain of stereotypical scientists who are cold and lifeless and she's longing for something deeper and heart hungry for philosophy, truth, and beauty.Kudos to whoever did Val Kilmer's make up. In this version, Simon Templar is a master of disguise and it seems plausible that he could pull it off with how different he looks in each disguise and Kilmer's dialects are masterful.Negatives: We can start with spending the first six minutes of the movie gratuitously showing Simon being beaten by a stereotypically overbearing priest for refusing to accept the name chosen for him as he was left at the orphanage as a nameless orphan. Will Hollywood decide this cliche is ever overdone?In the film's second and third acts, the best it can really manage is typical action slock which is not bad but not really good either. Plus the ending drags out through senseless decompression after the resolution.I also have to say that the film's understanding of science is dumbfounding. The formula obtained for cold fusion is incomplete, but all our heroine needs is two hours in a room without computers or anything to wrap it up. But hey, it's an action film.The film's biggest flaw goes back to Templar. The character just isn't likable. In fact, we rarely understand why he does anything. He wants to get $50 million in his bank account to retire...why? Why $50 million? And why does he want to quit? Is he wanting to stay out of jails? Does he not like what he does and feels on some level its wrong?  It's never explained.Part of this is Kilmer who lacks any charm or charisma that actors like George Sanders or Roger Moore brought to the role. There's no swagger in Kilmer's Saint until the end by which point its toolater. There's no sense of fun. It's just a guy doing a job and wanting to make money.The other thing is the way the film was written makes the character hard to like and it's the way he seduces vulnerable women and uses them for his own ends. First, it's a passenger on the plane who just found out her husband is cheating on her and then Doctor Russell, a lonely eccentric romantic longing for something deeper.  This is contrary to the original Saint films and TV shows, that while roguish, always fought on the side of angels, and left you with the impression that no innocent person had been hurt.It would have taken magnificent performance to make such a character likable and Kilmer's mediocre performance just doesn't do it.",2,Not Your Grandfather's Saint,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,3139,"['film', 'remake', 'update', 'Leslie', 'Charteris', 'character', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'aka', 'Saint', 'modern', 'setting', 'Saint', 'still', 'criminal', 'who', ""n't"", 'gone', 'straight', 'entangled', 'issues', 'post-Soviet', 'Russia', 'where', 'control', 'energy', 'vital', 'future', 'evil', 'Communist', 'turned', 'evil', 'Billionaire', 'planning', 'topple', 'government', 'obtaining', 'secret', 'cold', 'fusion', 'Saint', 'must', 'obtain', 'secret', 'Doctor', 'Emma', 'Russell', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'location', 'work', 'bringing', 'life', 'Russia', 'Winter', 'cold', 'grittiness', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'character', 'pretty', 'well-crafted', 'cutting', 'grain', 'stereotypical', 'scientists', 'who', 'are', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'longing', 'something', 'deeper', 'heart', 'hungry', 'philosophy', 'truth', 'beauty.Kudos', 'whoever', 'did', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'make', 'up', 'version', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'master', 'disguise', 'plausible', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'how', 'different', 'disguise', 'Kilmer', 'dialects', 'are', 'masterful.Negatives', 'can', 'start', 'spending', 'first', 'six', 'minutes', 'movie', 'gratuitously', 'showing', 'Simon', 'being', 'beaten', 'stereotypically', 'overbearing', 'priest', 'refusing', 'accept', 'name', 'chosen', 'was', 'left', 'orphanage', 'nameless', 'orphan', 'Will', 'Hollywood', 'decide', 'cliche', 'ever', 'overdone', 'film', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'best', 'can', 'really', 'manage', 'typical', 'action', 'slock', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'either', 'ending', 'drags', 'out', 'senseless', 'decompression', 'resolution.I', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'understanding', 'science', 'dumbfounding', 'formula', 'obtained', 'cold', 'fusion', 'incomplete', 'heroine', 'two', 'hours', 'room', 'computers', 'anything', 'wrap', 'up', 'action', 'film.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'back', 'Templar', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'likable', 'fact', 'rarely', 'understand', 'why', 'anything', 'get', '50', 'million', 'bank', 'account', 'retire', 'why', 'Why', '50', 'million', 'why', 'want', 'quit', 'wanting', 'stay', 'jails', 'not', 'what', 'feels', 'level', 'wrong', 'never', 'explained.Part', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'charm', 'charisma', 'actors', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'brought', 'role', 'swagger', 'Kilmer', 'Saint', 'end', 'point', 'toolater', 'sense', 'fun', 'just', 'guy', 'doing', 'job', 'wanting', 'make', 'money.The', 'other', 'thing', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'character', 'hard', 'like', 'way', 'vulnerable', 'women', 'own', 'ends', 'First', 'passenger', 'plane', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'husband', 'cheating', 'then', 'Doctor', 'Russell', 'lonely', 'eccentric', 'romantic', 'longing', 'something', 'deeper', 'contrary', 'original', 'Saint', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'roguish', 'always', 'fought', 'side', 'angels', 'left', 'impression', 'innocent', 'person', 'had', 'been', 'hurt.It', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'make', 'such', 'character', 'likable', 'Kilmer', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'just', ""n't"", 'do']",The Saint VHS

427703,A24PTVSZSM8968,6304535570,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","This movie shares a cinematic heritage with many other movies about international intrigue and characters who are masters of disguise or espionage. This one is interesting because it comes from a unique time when there were a lot of changes going on in the world. The setting is in post-communist Russia and involves energy tycoons engaging in shady behavior. There is also a story line involving cold fusion that can only be viewed as somewhat silly in retrospect. In any case, the setting and details are not necessarily all that important for a movie like this. The main character, played by Val Kilmer, is an orphan who has mastered the art of disguises and trickery and works as a sort of freelance espionage specialist. His eventual romantic interest and side kick is played by Elizabeth Shue who is as charming as ever, albeit completely unbelievable as a renown scientist. Kilmer and Shue seem to develop some chemistry in the film and Kilmer turns in another unique and engaging performance. The action sequences are just low-key enough to be somewhat different than many of these types of movies but still fast-paced enough keep the viewer interested. There is something about this movie that makes it memorable. Perhaps it is the fact that the main character is more of a one-man-show and his main supporting cast is not a team of gadget-laden colleagues, but a helpless woman who becomes a love interest. In any case, even though the setting and scientific premise seems a bit quaint and dated, the movie still delivers.",4,Interesting movie from an interesting time.,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1532,"['movie', 'shares', 'cinematic', 'heritage', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'international', 'intrigue', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'masters', 'disguise', 'espionage', 'one', 'interesting', 'unique', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'lot', 'changes', 'going', 'world', 'setting', 'post-communist', 'Russia', 'energy', 'tycoons', 'engaging', 'shady', 'behavior', 'also', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'cold', 'fusion', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'retrospect', 'case', 'setting', 'details', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'important', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'orphan', 'who', 'mastered', 'art', 'disguises', 'trickery', 'sort', 'freelance', 'espionage', 'specialist', 'eventual', 'romantic', 'interest', 'side', 'kick', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'who', 'as', 'charming', 'ever', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'renown', 'scientist', 'Kilmer', 'Shue', 'seem', 'develop', 'chemistry', 'film', 'Kilmer', 'unique', 'engaging', 'performance', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'just', 'low-key', 'enough', 'be', 'somewhat', 'different', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'still', 'fast-paced', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'something', 'movie', 'memorable', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'one-man-show', 'main', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'team', 'gadget-laden', 'colleagues', 'helpless', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'case', 'even', 'setting', 'scientific', 'premise', 'bit', 'quaint', 'dated', 'movie', 'still']",The Saint VHS

I note that the reviews here so far seem to fall into two camps: people who never saw the series, and loved the film, and people who loved the series, and just can't get over their disappointment that their beloved character wasn't faithfully portrayed on the big screen.No, Val Kilmer's Simon Templar is not the same as Roger Moore's. but this isn't really such a bad thing.  The movie is a really nice, underrated spy thriller.  It's got action, romance, exotic locals, love-to-hate-em villains, a likeable hero, and a plot that doesn't strain suspension of disbelief too far.  What more do you want in a popcorn movie?I'll admit, if you're a real fan of the series or the books it might have been nice to have a movie that reflects the original a little more faithfully.  But it might be well to recognize that the series was not without its faults as well.  For one thing, it always bothered my about the series that Simon Templar is an unadulterated good guy, who never, ever does anything really criminal or base or rotten, yet everywhere he goes, the local authorities are watching him like hawks, as though he is some kind of arch criminal.I'm also rather thrown for a loop that some of the reviewers here blast the movie for being unbelievable, and then decry Val Kilmer's Simon Templar because he's not like the ""real"" Saint.  True, this version is not all that faithful to the spirit of Leslie Charteris' character, but that Saint was a freelance, adventuring do-gooder, a man who read the papers eager to find a cause to involve himself in.  His moral code was strong, and his motives were also pure: he would never hurt, steal from, or kill anyone who doesn't completely deserve it. In short, the Saint was the Robin Hood of the twentieth century.  Folks, let's face it, this is not the most believable character in fiction.  I grant you, it's certainly fun, and it might have played well in the pulp era of the 1920s in which the character orignated (or even the early to mid 60s when the series was made), but the producers of the film probably felt (and perhaps not wrongly, let's grant) that this sort of thing was just too much for audiences to swallow in today's more cynical era.If you can get over the fact that this is not really Leslie Charteris' Saint, then you will find this movie to be a really fun, entertaining spy thriller.

427706,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304535570,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","My ex-girlfriend was in love with Val Kilmer.  She was his Brad Pitt.  We watched like every Kilmer movie together, and her favorite was `The Saint'.  I probably saw this movie fifty times in the two years that we dated; seriously.  Now, this was YEARS ago (god, I feel old now) and so I wasn't even half the cinephile I am today.  My taste in film generally consisted of explosions, sex and fight scenes and so I was more than fine with watching `The Saint', since it has all three to a degree.  A few months ago I happened to catch this film on television and it brought back memories of my teenage years and `the one that got away' (we're both married with children now and keep in touch, albeit sparsely).I have never seen the original television series, and I never read any of the novels, so my opinion is based solely on my feelings on the film itself.  Watching it now and pulling it from the context of `yesteryear memories' was a different experience.  The 90's were a big time for spy films and `The Saint' was then and is still considered one of the shallower attempts at the genre.I blame a lot of that on Kilmer.I am personally a fan of his work.  I used to really like him as an actor, but even now in my newfound view of film I see greatness in a lot of his work, namely his 90's turns.  He should have been up for an Oscar for his flawless performance in `The Doors', which was just uncanny and still haunts.  He has a great knack for comedic timing, as he's shown as recent as 2005's `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  It's sad to me that his star persona has diminished and he's basically become a washed up joke of an actor.  His performance here is too calculated for its own good.  He just cannot get the persona of a spy down without feeling, well, like a guy trying to pretend to be a spy.  I understand that the character of Simon Templar is far different than that of James Bond, and so you can't expect the same suaveness about them, but Kilmer just can't convey anything outside of cold calculation.You have to suspend disbelief with a film like this because rarely do spy movies remain logical throughout.  With the amount of `cool gadgets' and `improbably action sequences', this genre is corroded with aspects that can be deemed `stupid' by the literal mind.  I have no problem suspending disbelief and even forgiving preposterousness if it is handled in a way that makes me wish that it were possible.  `The Saint' never gets there though.

He deceives her, she tracks him down, there's a lot of chases, and oh yeah, there's a revolution going on around them. The fun part: The thief is noble at heart, a master of quick-changes and impersonations, and always picks for his personae the names of Catholic saints (a rather telling calling-card, if you ask me, but the movie asks us to ""forget"" that any criminal profiler would catch that within 30 seconds).It's a romp of a movie. There's definite chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, the leads, and it's delightful to see Kilmer's various personae, how different they all really are. The movie drags a bit in the middle (and honestly, the entire beginning sequence could have been left out safely), but it picks up again. There are some fascinating characters in here, most particularly the greedy ""art dealer"" Frankie, who steals every scene she's in. Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't among the fascinating -- both are two-dimensional and stereotypical. But there's plenty to compensate for the movie's shortcomings. A chase scene involving Shue trying to reach the American embassy is among my favorites in movie history. The sets are very cool. The acting is fairly solid, bad guys aside.

Arguably the best thief in the world is working his way towards retirement  when he gets caught up in a plot, led by a Russian oil tychoon names  Tretiak, to take over the USSR.Shue plays Doctor Russell who is working  on the formula for cold fusion that Templar is tasked to steal. She becomes  a partner of sorts to Templar in a quest to thwart the plans of  Tretiak.Every aspect of The Saint comes together to make it a modern day  classic that can challenge the likes of Goldeneye and other great spy  movies.Not only an action film, The Saint has the nice subplot of a love  story between Templar and Dr. Russell, that plays a larger role in the  ladder half of the movie as the two characters fall for each other.Why  this movie didn't break out as a hit I think I may never know. At least you  now have the change to make up for what you missed in the theaters.

It misses the tongue in cheek charm of the James Bond movies. As Russian I have to admit I was annoyed about the fact that Russia was pictured so one-dimensionally. It portrayed as an awful place populated by murderers and money-grabbing morons. But the mercenary spy named Simon Templar saved the place. The Saint is driven by pure monetary reasons, but also by crusading spirit (one of the first scenes shows him as a boy reading a book about Knights Templar). Just passing by he manages to liberate the people of Russia from the grip of the monstrous, crazy and power-craving oil magnate. On the way he meets one very nice girl and falls in love. The movie is so bad that it is kind of a satire on itself. At places it reminds me the moronic anti-American propaganda of the Soviet times but in reverse.

Beautiful London and Moscow scenery and a rocking soundtrack enhance the chases.Val Kilmer delivers his best performance as the Saint and proves that he can hold a movie on his own.

But as a stand-alone spy movie, the Saint is excellent.  Kilmer has a very different look as a spy and Simon Templar's character throughout the movie is very interesting.  He is cold at times and yet unbelievably warm.  Throw the very attractive and sensitive Elizabeth Shue into the mix and you have a great romance brewing.

""The Saint"" was originally a television series in the 1960's featuring Roger Moore as the Saint. But as most cases are, this 1997 new movie version of the character of the Saint is only remotely close to the original. And again as most cases are, it isn't really such a bad thing. My suggestion is that if you have seen the original series and you are about to watch this movie, keep an open mind in that the character and the feel of Simon Templar is a bit different.Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the man of many faces and names. Though none other than a mercenary spy and a thief, he is always in the right as he thwarts enemies while giving British authorities a merry chase. The country of Russia is in chaos as there is a severe oil shortage. The people are rising in a revolution, the leader being Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) who is in actuality cheating and lying to all his 'fellow countrymen'. In fact he and his son, Ilya (Valeri Nikolayev) are your average power-hungry bad guys, in fact the ones who started a fake oil shortage! Their plan is to steal Dr. Emma Russell's (Elisabeth Shue) fusion power theory with the help of Simon Templar, thus getting more support from the people of Russia. But as Simon falls in love with the beautiful doctor (and she with him), he changes plans and helps her escape the Tretiak's while saving the Russian people dying from the cold.Val Kilmer does a marvelous job in his character, all of his disguises and fake accents completely well-done. His many disguises change from a long-haired artist, a peppered gray mustache for a Russian, thinning hair and dorky face and glasses for a reporter, and more. His accents are the most well-done and range from a thick Russian accent, bright Australian accent, soft South African accent, and more! And Elizabeth Shue for me has certainly grown up, since I've only seen her as a teenager in ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Adventures in Babysitting"". Her acting is pretty good but I didn't really like her that much as I like most other heroines in other movies.The story line is averagely good, and as some people have mentioned, at times the movie was a bit tedious and long-drawn. In my opinion, I think they could have cut out more of the romantic scenes and included more espionage, action, escapes, fights... you get the idea. I just felt that just when it was getting exciting, it was either suddenly cut short or the suspense was taken out. What action there was though was fantastic! Very exciting, the best scenes include the Saint stealing a microchip in the beginning and all the escapes from Tretiak's henchmen.I feel that all action movies should always have a bit of humor instilled and ""The Saint"" does have its funny moments. I love the part in the beginning where Simon is just about to break into a building, discovers that the door isn't locked then remarks, ""I love this country!"" The ending is pretty funny also as he has a run in with some inspectors from Scotland Yard. Simon Templar's car horn is pretty cool!Put it all together, ""The Saint"" is pretty fantastic if you have a free 2 hours to spare. As I said, if you've been a fan of ""The Saint"" and you're about to watch this movie, keep an open mind if you hope to enjoy it! The PG-13 rating is for adult situations and the action.A bit of trivia: In the end of the movie, Simon turns on the radio and listens to an announcer. I wasn't sure but I was able to confirm that the radio announcer's voice is none other than Roger Moore, the man who played The Saint in the television series!",4,Val Kilmer is 'the Saint'...,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3655,"['Saint', 'action', 'romance', 'packed', 'movie', 'featuring', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'Saint', 'was', 'originally', 'television', 'series', '1960', 'featuring', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Saint', 'most', 'cases', 'are', '1997', 'new', 'movie', 'version', 'character', 'Saint', 'only', 'remotely', 'close', 'original', 'again', 'most', 'cases', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'suggestion', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'watch', 'movie', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'character', 'feel', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'bit', 'different.Val', 'Kilmer', 'plays', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'man', 'many', 'names', 'none', 'other', 'mercenary', 'spy', 'thief', 'always', 'right', 'enemies', 'giving', 'British', 'authorities', 'merry', 'chase', 'country', 'Russia', 'chaos', 'severe', 'oil', 'shortage', 'people', 'are', 'rising', 'revolution', 'leader', 'being', 'Ivan', 'Tretiak', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'who', 'actuality', 'cheating', 'lying', ""'fellow"", 'countrymen', 'fact', 'son', 'Ilya', 'Valeri', 'Nikolayev', 'are', 'average', 'power-hungry', 'bad', 'guys', 'fact', 'ones', 'who', 'started', 'fake', 'oil', 'shortage', 'plan', 'steal', 'Dr.', 'Emma', 'Russell', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'fusion', 'power', 'theory', 'help', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'thus', 'getting', 'more', 'support', 'people', 'Russia', 'Simon', 'love', 'beautiful', 'doctor', 'plans', 'escape', 'Tretiak', 'saving', 'Russian', 'people', 'dying', 'cold.Val', 'Kilmer', 'marvelous', 'job', 'character', 'disguises', 'fake', 'accents', 'completely', 'well-done', 'many', 'disguises', 'change', 'long-haired', 'artist', 'peppered', 'gray', 'mustache', 'Russian', 'thinning', 'hair', 'dorky', 'face', 'glasses', 'reporter', 'more', 'accents', 'are', 'most', 'well-done', 'range', 'thick', 'Russian', 'accent', 'bright', 'Australian', 'accent', 'soft', 'South', 'African', 'accent', 'more', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'certainly', 'grown', 'up', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'teenager', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'that', 'much', 'like', 'most', 'other', 'heroines', 'other', 'movies.The', 'story', 'line', 'averagely', 'good', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'tedious', 'long-drawn', 'opinion', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'more', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'included', 'more', 'espionage', 'action', 'escapes', 'fights', 'get', 'idea', 'just', 'felt', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'exciting', 'was', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'short', 'suspense', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'What', 'action', 'was', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Very', 'exciting', 'best', 'scenes', 'include', 'Saint', 'stealing', 'microchip', 'beginning', 'escapes', 'Tretiak', 'henchmen.I', 'feel', 'action', 'movies', 'should', 'always', 'have', 'bit', 'humor', 'instilled', 'Saint', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'love', 'part', 'beginning', 'where', 'Simon', 'just', 'about', 'break', 'building', 'discovers', 'door', ""n't"", 'locked', 'then', 'remarks', 'love', 'country', 'ending', 'pretty', 'funny', 'also', 'run', 'inspectors', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'car', 'horn', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Put', 'together', 'Saint', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'have', 'free', '2', 'hours', 'spare', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Saint', ""'re"", 'watch', 'movie', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'adult', 'situations', 'action.A', 'bit', 'trivia', 'end', 'movie', 'Simon', 'radio', 'announcer', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'able', 'confirm', 'radio', 'announcer', 'voice', 'none', 'other', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Saint', 'television', 'series']",The Saint VHS

I cannot stop thinking about this movie and cannot stand the critics who seem to have had it in for Val Kilmer throughout his entire career.

Many of the bad reviews for this movie come from folks who seem to think it's an action flick.  Er, no.It's a romance, people.  That may not be what the director/scripters originally intended, but that's the way it ended up.  A wonderful, stirring romantic origin-story that asks and answers the questions, ""Why would someone become a professional thief?"", and ""Why would he change radically to become a ""Saint"", using his former talents for good?""The answer, of coure, being love of a good woman.

He knows he can fool Emma - he HAS fooled her, completely - but then, is he ""pretending"" to fall in love with her or is it real?  What is real?
