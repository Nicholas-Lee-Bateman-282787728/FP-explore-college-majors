872787,A2DE3JG7M20CUA,B0006SGYLA,"AKA ""authorknows""","[9, 9]","Who has peeked inside Czech Republic since the Oscar winning Kolya? This weekend we rented the movie a recent Czech film, Zelary (rhymes with celery).  The Czech Republic is the star; this film really shows her off: the mountains, wildflowers, colors of changing seasons, snow.Zelary looks back, with nostalgia, on the transition between WW II Gestapo control of the country and the Russian takeover.  A short period of time existed between the two regimes. I can only imagine the impetus to make this film was for it to be a cultural reminder to the people of Czech Republic. It asks the big questions:  Who are we? Were did we come from? Where might we be going?Short synopsis from metaphor point-of-view: Female sexuality holds center stage and works as a metaphor for the Czech Republic itself. Within the feminine element the film plays out bigger themes of birth and death, oppression and freedom, tenderness and brutality, fidelity and betrayal, and most provocatively, the urban and rural.The film begins with an ""urban"" sex scene set in a modern apartment with streamline furniture, lots of books, records and record player, leather chairs, satin sheets. Eliska, an OR nurse, and Richard, a surgeon, are active in the resistance movement.  Both are  well educated, well-groomed, wealthy, have attractive bodies lovely undergarments, and all of their teeth.  They make love to a jazz recording.Cut to an hour later when Eliska has sex with a country man, Joza. To save her own life and to hide from the Nazi Gestapo, Eliska marries Joza but consummation takes weeks--or maybe months. Eliska must embrace the countryside and with it her man.  Though Eliska softens up, Joza still smell bad to her. If he wants her, he has to take a bath in the new wooden tub and use soap.The rural lovemaking happens in a bed, as in the first scene. The mountain coupling is very tender and long-awaited rather than impulsive and without a clear understanding of the relationship between the  man and woman.  Eliska and salt-of-the-earth Joza  snuggle down in an overstuffed feather bed with a rough frame and flannel sheets. Their cabin has a dirt floor, no electricity, a few pots and pans, and a midget-sized door they have to stoop under to enter.After she falls deeply in love with Joza, Eliska is raped in a sauna by a local drunk who threatens to expose her past political activities to the Gestapo and therefore jeopardize everyone in the village who might have helped her hide.  There are more brutal rapes: a mountain woman is dragged off by a troop of German Gestapo who have just killed her family because they supported partisans. When the Russians arrive after  the Germans are defeated, they go on a rape rampage.In Zelary, men are the protectors of the culture, the country, the women.  Men also threaten the safety and dignity of the women.  They are surgeons, priests, farmers, soldiers, foreigners, and countrymen.  At the film's beginning, when the resistance leaders send Eliska off with the saw mill man, they tell her: ""Joza is a good man. He will die for you.""Die he does. When the Russians are on their rape and pillage rampage, Joza risks his life to gather the lost and stranded members of his village and shepherd them to a safe spot. By accident, he is shot by his own villager.  His death frees the woman.Off screen Eliska returns to the city, completes her medical training, and becomes a doctor.The last moments of Zelary are profoundly touching. Four or five years later, together with Richard (the surgeon from the first sex scene), Eliska returns to what remains of the mountain village. The only person still living in the hills, it the old `witch doctor'  who wears a babushka and traditional country clothes. She is the woman who birthed babies, gathered herbs, and prepared the dead.  The old and new women embrace.",5,Czech Republic  is the Star of this Film,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,3845,"['Who', 'peeked', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Kolya', 'weekend', 'rented', 'movie', 'recent', 'Czech', 'film', 'Zelary', 'rhymes', 'celery', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'star', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'mountains', 'wildflowers', 'colors', 'changing', 'seasons', 'snow.Zelary', 'looks', 'back', 'nostalgia', 'transition', 'WW', 'II', 'Gestapo', 'control', 'country', 'Russian', 'takeover', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'existed', 'two', 'regimes', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'impetus', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'cultural', 'reminder', 'people', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'big', 'questions', 'Who', 'are', 'Were', 'did', 'come', 'Where', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'Short', 'synopsis', 'metaphor', 'point-of-view', 'Female', 'sexuality', 'center', 'stage', 'metaphor', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'feminine', 'element', 'film', 'out', 'bigger', 'themes', 'birth', 'death', 'oppression', 'freedom', 'tenderness', 'brutality', 'fidelity', 'betrayal', 'most', 'provocatively', 'urban', 'rural.The', 'film', 'urban', 'sex', 'scene', 'set', 'modern', 'apartment', 'streamline', 'furniture', 'lots', 'books', 'records', 'record', 'player', 'leather', 'chairs', 'satin', 'sheets', 'Eliska', 'OR', 'nurse', 'Richard', 'surgeon', 'are', 'active', 'resistance', 'movement', 'are', 'well', 'educated', 'well-groomed', 'wealthy', 'have', 'attractive', 'bodies', 'lovely', 'undergarments', 'teeth', 'make', 'love', 'jazz', 'recording.Cut', 'hour', 'later', 'when', 'Eliska', 'sex', 'country', 'man', 'Joza', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'hide', 'Nazi', 'Gestapo', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 'consummation', 'weeks', 'maybe', 'months', 'Eliska', 'must', 'embrace', 'countryside', 'man', 'Eliska', 'up', 'Joza', 'still', 'smell', 'bad', 'take', 'bath', 'new', 'wooden', 'tub', 'use', 'soap.The', 'rural', 'lovemaking', 'bed', 'first', 'scene', 'mountain', 'coupling', 'very', 'tender', 'long-awaited', 'rather', 'impulsive', 'clear', 'understanding', 'relationship', 'man', 'woman', 'Eliska', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'Joza', 'snuggle', 'down', 'overstuffed', 'feather', 'bed', 'rough', 'frame', 'flannel', 'sheets', 'cabin', 'dirt', 'floor', 'electricity', 'few', 'pots', 'pans', 'midget-sized', 'door', 'have', 'stoop', 'enter.After', 'deeply', 'love', 'Joza', 'Eliska', 'raped', 'sauna', 'local', 'drunk', 'who', 'expose', 'past', 'political', 'activities', 'Gestapo', 'therefore', 'jeopardize', 'everyone', 'village', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'hide', 'are', 'more', 'brutal', 'rapes', 'mountain', 'woman', 'dragged', 'off', 'troop', 'German', 'Gestapo', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'killed', 'family', 'supported', 'partisans', 'When', 'Russians', 'arrive', 'Germans', 'are', 'defeated', 'go', 'rape', 'rampage.In', 'Zelary', 'men', 'are', 'protectors', 'culture', 'country', 'women', 'Men', 'also', 'threaten', 'safety', 'dignity', 'women', 'are', 'surgeons', 'priests', 'farmers', 'soldiers', 'foreigners', 'countrymen', 'film', 'beginning', 'when', 'resistance', 'leaders', 'send', 'Eliska', 'saw', 'mill', 'man', 'tell', 'Joza', 'good', 'man', 'will', 'die', 'Die', 'When', 'Russians', 'are', 'rape', 'pillage', 'rampage', 'Joza', 'life', 'gather', 'lost', 'stranded', 'members', 'village', 'shepherd', 'safe', 'spot', 'accident', 'shot', 'own', 'villager', 'death', 'woman.Off', 'screen', 'Eliska', 'city', 'medical', 'training', 'doctor.The', 'last', 'moments', 'Zelary', 'are', 'profoundly', 'touching', 'Four', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'together', 'Richard', 'surgeon', 'first', 'sex', 'scene', 'Eliska', 'what', 'mountain', 'village', 'only', 'person', 'still', 'living', 'hills', 'old', 'witch', 'doctor', 'who', 'babushka', 'traditional', 'country', 'clothes', 'woman', 'who', 'birthed', 'babies', 'gathered', 'herbs', 'prepared', 'dead', 'old', 'new', 'women', 'embrace']",N/A
872788,ARA48345JZPZR,B0006SGYLA,Archmaker,"[11, 11]","I think several previous reviewers have nailed what is so good about this film.  I just wanted to add my voice to theirs.  A quiet, deliberately paced story of a young female medical student involved in the WWII Prague resistance who must go into hiding from the Gestapo in a rural village.  Her protector is a simple, older peasant man who had been a patient in her hospital. To insure her ""cover"" and to help protect the villagers from Nazi reprisals she must wed this man.  The story of how this sophisticated young city woman adapts, adjusts to and what she learns from this very different life then unfolds.Beautifully filmed, this story illuminates the dislocation the heroine feels, the danger surrounding both her and the villagers who exhibit all the normal human traits of honesty and dishonesty, treachery and loyalty, wisdom and foolishness.  And finally, there is love and the human heart and the never-ending surprises to be found there.Ah, the human heart and love, throughout  history and a thousand stories already told, we still find it inexplicable and unpredictable.  There will be another thousand stories yet to charm and bewilder us, if they're done well.

872789,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B0006SGYLA,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[0, 0]","A sophisticated city girl`s dream of attending medical school is cut short by the Nazi takeover of the Czech lands.  She bides her time helping the Czech resistance in Prague.  Suddenly, her comfortable, if directionless life is thrown helter-skelter.  In order to save herself from the pursuing Gestapo, she must flee Prague, assume a new identity in a faraway mountain village, and even marry a stranger, with whom she shares nothing in common.Such is the premise of `Zelary,` a remarkable tale about the sacrifices and rewards of a seemingly impossible love.  When Eliska (played by Czech beauty, Ana Geislerova) is ripped from all that is familiar, she balks and throws tantrums like a spoiled child.  Her displeasure is understandable as she must adapt to a radically altered existence. The simple peasants and their draconian customs alienate her, while her protector, whom she must wed, is her complete opposite.`Zelary`s` beauty lies in how it elegantly maps Eliska`s iourney from outright refusal to gradual acceptance and even embrace of her new life and surroundings.  Her peasant cover/husband-to-be, Joza (played by one of the masters of Hungarian cinema, Gyorgy Cserhalmi) is as roughhewn and coarse as the pine boards he cuts in the local sawmill.  Laconic and clumsy, Joza soon shows his affection for Eliska in a variety of tiny ways.  He calls her `miss` (much to her annoyance), waits to consummate their `arranged' marriage, and even floors in their simple mountain hut for her comfort.  Under his strong and constant observation, Eliska begins to feel safe again.  Gradually, Eliska makes peace with her new life.  She begins to cook and clean for him, makes a new friend in the village and even helps the local midwife with medical emergencies.As Eliska opens to her new environment, the village itself comes alive; its cast of unique denizens surrounds Eliska with love and acceptance.  Director Ondrej Trojan does a remarkable job at giving these support characters a full existence.  Each of them adds their story to that of Eliska and Joza giving the film a Tolstoyian scope.  One standout is Helenka, the foul-mouthed elfin goatherdess who manages to both enrapture and annoy all who stumble across her path.  Her `milk brother' (weaned, but not born of the same mother), Lipka, is another charming character.  Village scapegoat,  beaten at home and blamed at school, Lipka endures the village`s wrath and contempt. Yet, with almost folktale justice, it is he who saves the villagers in their time of greatest need.  Eliska`s new life brims with memorable characters, each deftly defined:  the beneficent priest, the troubled schoolmaster, the wizened midwife `babicka,` and even a local ne`er do well who threatens Eliska`s life and well-being.Placed within the scope of such vivid characters, Eliska and Joza are but part of the sea that engulfs them.  Their story is but one of many, a patch in the living fabric that surrounds and nurtures them.  This I believe is what makes `Zelary` a unique and wonderful film.  Part of the downplaying of the Eliska/Joza relationship must have originated from the massive language barriers involved in this ambitious project.  Not knowing each others` language, Geislerova and Cserhalmi express much through gesture, facial expression and `atmosphere.`  This lends the film added credibility as it underscores the real communication barriers that an unlikely relationship such as Eliska and Joza`s would have encountered.Trojan`s film works on another level as well.  Its cinematography is simply breathtaking.  Shot in the Mala Fatra Mountains of northern Slovakia, the scenery adds an additional weight to the film.  Anybody who has travelled this area will feel nostalgia for the verdant lushness of the Slovakian highlands.  Trojan takes advantage of the region`s colorfulness.  Surrounded by the vibrant peasant attire and the mountains` seasonal palate, it is easy to empathize with Eliska`s awe at her new surroundings.When the Russian `liberators' arrive at the end, tragedy comes unexpectedly.  The village is woefully unprepared for the ensuing rape and murder that descends.  Eliska , like the village itself, suffers painful loss, yet  must move on and adapt to yet another threat.A sweeping narrative that is both subtle and moving, `Zelary` is not a film for everybody.  It starts off as a mere trickle and over two hours swells into an epic flow, travelling through a deeply human panorama.  For those with patience and openness, `Zelary`s` rewards are many and splendid.",5,Seemingly impossible love,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,4554,"['sophisticated', 'city', 'girl', 's', 'dream', 'attending', 'medical', 'school', 'cut', 'short', 'Nazi', 'takeover', 'Czech', 'time', 'helping', 'Czech', 'resistance', 'Prague', 'Suddenly', 'comfortable', 'directionless', 'life', 'thrown', 'helter-skelter', 'order', 'save', 'pursuing', 'Gestapo', 'must', 'flee', 'Prague', 'assume', 'new', 'identity', 'faraway', 'mountain', 'village', 'even', 'marry', 'stranger', 'whom', 'shares', 'nothing', 'common.Such', 'premise', 'Zelary', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'sacrifices', 'rewards', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'love', 'When', 'Eliska', 'played', 'Czech', 'beauty', 'Ana', 'Geislerova', 'ripped', 'familiar', 'tantrums', 'spoiled', 'child', 'displeasure', 'understandable', 'must', 'adapt', 'radically', 'altered', 'existence', 'simple', 'peasants', 'draconian', 'customs', 'alienate', 'protector', 'whom', 'must', 'wed', 'complete', 'opposite.', 'Zelary', 's', 'beauty', 'how', 'elegantly', 'Eliska', 's', 'iourney', 'outright', 'refusal', 'gradual', 'acceptance', 'even', 'embrace', 'new', 'life', 'surroundings', 'peasant', 'cover/husband-to-be', 'Joza', 'played', 'one', 'masters', 'Hungarian', 'cinema', 'Gyorgy', 'Cserhalmi', 'roughhewn', 'coarse', 'pine', 'boards', 'local', 'sawmill', 'Laconic', 'clumsy', 'Joza', 'soon', 'affection', 'Eliska', 'variety', 'tiny', 'ways', 'miss', 'much', 'annoyance', 'consummate', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'even', 'floors', 'simple', 'mountain', 'hut', 'comfort', 'strong', 'constant', 'observation', 'Eliska', 'feel', 'safe', 'again', 'Gradually', 'Eliska', 'peace', 'new', 'life', 'cook', 'clean', 'new', 'friend', 'village', 'even', 'local', 'midwife', 'medical', 'emergencies.As', 'Eliska', 'new', 'environment', 'village', 'alive', 'cast', 'unique', 'denizens', 'Eliska', 'love', 'acceptance', 'Director', 'Ondrej', 'Trojan', 'remarkable', 'job', 'giving', 'support', 'characters', 'full', 'existence', 'story', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 'giving', 'film', 'Tolstoyian', 'scope', 'One', 'standout', 'Helenka', 'foul-mouthed', 'elfin', 'goatherdess', 'who', 'enrapture', 'annoy', 'who', 'stumble', 'path', 'milk', 'brother', 'weaned', 'not', 'born', 'same', 'mother', 'Lipka', 'charming', 'character', 'Village', 'scapegoat', 'beaten', 'home', 'blamed', 'school', 'Lipka', 'village', 's', 'wrath', 'contempt', 'almost', 'folktale', 'justice', 'who', 'villagers', 'time', 'greatest', 'need', 'Eliska', 's', 'new', 'life', 'brims', 'memorable', 'characters', 'deftly', 'defined', 'beneficent', 'priest', 'troubled', 'schoolmaster', 'wizened', 'midwife', 'babicka', 'even', 'local', 'ne', 'er', 'do', 'well', 'who', 'Eliska', 's', 'life', 'well-being.Placed', 'scope', 'such', 'vivid', 'characters', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 'are', 'part', 'sea', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'patch', 'living', 'fabric', 'believe', 'what', 'Zelary', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Part', 'downplaying', 'Eliska/Joza', 'relationship', 'must', 'have', 'originated', 'massive', 'language', 'barriers', 'involved', 'ambitious', 'project', 'Not', 'knowing', 'others', 'language', 'Geislerova', 'Cserhalmi', 'express', 'much', 'gesture', 'facial', 'expression', 'atmosphere.', 'film', 'added', 'credibility', 'real', 'communication', 'barriers', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'such', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 's', 'would', 'have', 'encountered.Trojan', 's', 'film', 'works', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'Shot', 'Mala', 'Fatra', 'Mountains', 'northern', 'Slovakia', 'scenery', 'additional', 'weight', 'film', 'Anybody', 'who', 'travelled', 'area', 'will', 'feel', 'nostalgia', 'verdant', 'lushness', 'Slovakian', 'highlands', 'Trojan', 'advantage', 'region', 's', 'colorfulness', 'Surrounded', 'vibrant', 'peasant', 'attire', 'mountains', 'seasonal', 'palate', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Eliska', 's', 'awe', 'new', 'surroundings.When', 'Russian', 'liberators', 'arrive', 'end', 'tragedy', 'unexpectedly', 'village', 'woefully', 'unprepared', 'ensuing', 'rape', 'murder', 'Eliska', 'village', 'suffers', 'painful', 'loss', 'yet', 'must', 'move', 'adapt', 'yet', 'threat.A', 'sweeping', 'narrative', 'subtle', 'moving', 'Zelary', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'off', 'mere', 'trickle', 'two', 'hours', 'epic', 'flow', 'travelling', 'deeply', 'human', 'panorama', 'patience', 'openness', 'Zelary', 's', 'rewards', 'are', 'many', 'splendid']",N/A

To it I can now add Ondrej Trojan's moving, visually stunning film.I have to admit, I didn't quite get why this woman had to go stay in a remote mountain village. Maybe I was too engrossed in seizing up the pacing, camera angles, scoring, etc. I try to appraise the formal elements, to be conscious of a film as a product from the first viewing. If one is able to maintain critical distance over the entire length of a film either one has supernatural powers of abstraction (and low empathic capacity) or the film is a failure for not breaking down those barriers and drawing one into the conflicts being suffered by the characters.I'm happy to report that ""Zelary"" sneaked past my censor and into my heart rather easily. Anna Geislerov&aacute; and Gy&ouml;rgy Cserhalmi are ""fine specimens"" and have what it takes to draw one in as actors. Cserhalmi is a massive, even fearsome presence as Joza, while Geislerov&aacute;'s Eliska, delicate and almost elfin beside him, knows how to withhold herself in a tantalizing way. Unlikely as the potential couple seemed (there is an almost 30 year difference between the actors), I found myself wishing something deep would develop between them. When it does it feels like the proverbial 'coincidence of opposites'.I hesitate to use ""epic"" to describe ""Zelary"", as epic usually indicates a film that goes on too long and skimps on the intimacy that character development requires. Though the film can be acquitted of the latter charge, there does come a point in the film where the story seems sprawl just a bit, attenuating the dramatic/thematic unity. The scene at the end in which Joza (spoilers ahead!) is shot amidst all the turmoil does not pack the dramatic punch it could have, being somewhat heavy-handed. A small blot on an otherwise engrossing, beautiful and at times harrowing film.Though maybe not quite on par with August's ""Pelle the Conqueror"" or Lelouch's ""Les Miserables"", ""Zelary"" definitely belongs in the company of such historical epics.",5,How many great Czech films are on your list?,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,2103,"['only', 'ones', 'had', 'watching', 'Zelary', 'were', 'Closely', 'Watched', 'Trains', 'Shop', 'Main', 'Street', 'can', 'now', 'add', 'Ondrej', 'Trojan', 'moving', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film.I', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'why', 'woman', 'had', 'go', 'stay', 'remote', 'mountain', 'village', 'Maybe', 'was', 'too', 'engrossed', 'seizing', 'up', 'pacing', 'camera', 'angles', 'scoring', 'etc', 'try', 'appraise', 'formal', 'elements', 'be', 'conscious', 'film', 'product', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', 'able', 'maintain', 'critical', 'distance', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'one', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'abstraction', 'low', 'empathic', 'capacity', 'film', 'failure', 'not', 'breaking', 'down', 'barriers', 'drawing', 'one', 'conflicts', 'being', 'suffered', 'characters.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'Zelary', 'sneaked', 'censor', 'heart', 'rather', 'easily', 'Anna', 'Geislerov', 'aacute', 'Gy', 'ouml', 'Cserhalmi', 'are', 'fine', 'specimens', 'have', 'what', 'draw', 'one', 'actors', 'Cserhalmi', 'massive', 'even', 'fearsome', 'presence', 'Joza', 'Geislerov', 'aacute', 'Eliska', 'delicate', 'almost', 'elfin', 'how', 'withhold', 'tantalizing', 'way', 'Unlikely', 'potential', 'couple', 'seemed', 'almost', '30', 'year', 'difference', 'actors', 'found', 'wishing', 'something', 'deep', 'would', 'develop', 'When', 'proverbial', ""'coincidence"", ""opposites'.I"", 'hesitate', 'use', 'epic', 'describe', 'Zelary', 'epic', 'usually', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'skimps', 'intimacy', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'acquitted', 'latter', 'charge', 'come', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'story', 'sprawl', 'just', 'bit', 'attenuating', 'dramatic/thematic', 'unity', 'scene', 'end', 'Joza', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'shot', 'amidst', 'turmoil', 'not', 'pack', 'dramatic', 'punch', 'could', 'have', 'being', 'somewhat', 'heavy-handed', 'small', 'blot', 'otherwise', 'engrossing', 'beautiful', 'times', 'harrowing', 'film.Though', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'August', 'Pelle', 'Conqueror', 'Lelouch', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'Zelary', 'definitely', 'company', 'such', 'historical', 'epics']",N/A

There Eliska changes--which is the point of the movie. She sees Joza, not as an uncouth peasant, but for the fine gentelman hiding under his rough exterior. Gradually, she falls in love with him, and makes love to him, and two might have headed for a happy life together, had it not been for the war, which the movie never allows us to forget. There are jealous people among the villagers, and though Eliska uses her medical expertise to help some of them, it is a harzardous life for her, expecially when the partisants come in to liberate the country. This is worth seeing, not only for the splendid, humane story, but for the gorgeous photography, the haunting music, and fine acting of all involved. The tragic elements are well balanced with a few bucolic scenes of country life, and, on balance, this is a story of optimism and faith in the human heart--despite its ugly urges. Excellent work, expecially to those who like slow-paced, but worthy European movies.

872795,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0006SGYLA,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[7, 25]","WARNING THIS REVIEW WILL REVEAL THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE. PLEASE STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW ""ZELARY"" ENDS.""Zelary"" is a very picturesque movie that offers a glimpse into peasant life in Czechoslovakia during World War II.It's a bit boring, though, and disappointing, because the filmmaker can't conceive of women or peasants as having any interesting internal life worth devoting film stock to.So, in this film that centers around a woman and a village full of peasants, the narrative drive is all but absent, and the movie consists of unconnected vignettes, rather than a powerful, coherent plot that powers the film from first frame to last.The viewer feels that he does not have to pay attention, and he doesn't.  Peasants singing, peasants picking berries, peasants getting drunk, attempting to rape their neighbors, attending mass -- it's just one big diorama.There is a character with some internal life. He is male, and he is white collar and educated. He's the town school teacher. It's clear: director Ondrej Trojan can do scenes with some complexity; he just doesn't want to do those scenes for female or peasant characters.I missed ""Zelary"" when it played in local theaters. I had really wanted to catch this tale of a city girl forced to hide out in the hut of a crude villager, as my mother is from Czechoslovkia, and some of the best years of my life have been spent in villages like Zelary -- high, impoverished, and remote. And I've had a relationship similar to the one depicted in the movie.Unbeknownst to director Trojan, real life, exciting life, life and plots as driven and demanding as in any city, *do* take place in small villages. In the same way that an urban character, or a man, can be the rewarding and relentless focus of a carefully unreeling plot, women and peasants can, as well.Problem: many former Soviet bloc men felt emasculated by Nazi, and then Communist, invasions and imperiums, and dealt with this by dehumanizing women -- they established a heirarchy in which they could find someone to feel superior to.That's what happens here. The female lead is made to pose without clothing in the movie's very first, and utterly gratuitous, scene.  Hana, the woman the entire movie revolves around is, in that scene, reduced to nothing more than the object that rewards pathetic viewers in a peep show.  It's hard to identify with such a debased and cheapened character / actress.Hana's never given a chance to redeem herself. She is shown aiding the resistance, but only at the directive of men, who operate her as if she were a marionette.Nazis close in; she is sent, again, by men, to a remote village, where she is forced, again, by men, to marry Joza, a local villager.That this villager is unmarried defies credulity. In any case ... this is not the last time this peasant is manipulated to serve ""Zelary'""s plot, such as it is.Hana is resistant to consummation of this forced marriage, until Joza, the much older peasant, lays, for her, wooden planks over his dirt floor, and then bathes. This is enough for her to consummate the forced marriage.""Zelary"" opened by exploiting its female lead -- both the character and the actress playing her -- as if she were a prostitute; in the marriage consummation scene, it utterly betrays her.This character, we have been told, is a resistance fighter, and a medical student. Would she really have relations with a man she otherwise can't stand for such poorly motivated reasons?  What a low view of women Ondrej Trojan, the filmmaker, has. The connotation of Trojan's last name in American slang is all too appropriate.And that's as much development as the central story gets. The film becomes a series of disconnected, soul-less tableaux of village life.One can't help but think of Peter Weir's far superior film on a similar theme, ""Witness."" In that movie, Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis play an urban cop and an Amish widow who must share a farmhouse in a remote, rural scene. ""Witness"" works slowly, carefully, to reveal their characters, and their growing love.For a movie like ""Witness"" to work so hard to reveal human character, and to drive a plot with that revelation, the director has to believe that his characters have inner life.Trojan has no such belief. He treats his characters as superficial dolls. They are worthwhile as wearers of colorful peasant costumes; they are worthwhile, if female, when not wearing anything at all, and in one of the movie's many, many, rape scenes.In the cheapest move of all, Trojan sacrifices one of his characters for sheer convenience's sake, to eliminate the need to plumb the depths of the two people who've been onscreen for more than two hours.The war ends. The Nazis are defeated. Hana is released. She can leave the hamlet she once hated, Zelary. She can leave the older, crude peasant man. He says as much to her: ""You can go now. If not today, then tomorrow, or next week.""She says nothing. And, then, Joza is shot dead. How convenient!Joza managed to survive years of Nazi occupation, in spite of hiding a wanted resistance fighter, living in his house in plain sight, and the day she can leave him, the day that demands that the filmmaker give his despised female character and lowly peasant character some complexity, some inner life, the filmmaker makes it easy on himself, eliminates the need for any probing exploration of the humanity of his characters, and shoots one of them dead.Cheap. And disappointing.Women, and peasants, deserve better.",4,Picturesque; Disappointing; Women and Peasants Cheated by Director,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,5510,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'WILL',

872796,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B0006SGYLA,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[24, 24]","The love story about two utterly different individuals speaks volumes about the human condition.  Eliska is a well educated woman who under normal circumstances would have little to do with Joza, a mere sawmill worker who lives in a small house with a dirt floor and no indoor plumbing.  The man does not own a single book nor reading material of any kind.  It is doubtful if he can even read at the level expected of a grade school graduate.  Alas, this is wartime and the Nazis are searching for Eliska because of her involvement in the resistance.  Hiding in the Czech boondocks and marrying the socially inferior Joza is her only viable alternative.  She eventually learns to love him and make the best of a less than ideal situation.  The term culture shock most appropriately describes Eliska's challenge to be accepted by those who perceive her to both be an outsider and a risk to their own safety.  Nazi soldiers, as expected, don't hesitate to kill those who hide enemies of the Third Reich.  Will Eliska be betrayed?  Can her relationship with the villagers ever become warm and intense?  We observe the process unfold over a period of a few years.  Anyone who enjoys romantic stories must see Zelary.  It may very well be ranked among your favorites of all time.  Yes, it is that good of a movie.  You should not be disappointed.One wonders why it is so difficult to find a copy of Zelary's music score.  It is among the best I've heard in years.  Could it be due to the fact that few Czech films are imported to the United States?

872798,A2Q5D42J42V5ZP,B0006SGYLA,E. Holmes,"[64, 65]","This is a film that I would heartly recommend to anyone.  It's a perfect film for a Saturday night viewing with friends, at whoever's house has the biggest screen and the best speakers. The cinematography is sweeping and rich, and the score is moving. The story is epic, compelling and romantic (without getting sappy).  Other films of this genre that come to mind are 'Cold Mountain' and 'Witness'.Zelary is also chance to enjoy the work of prolific actresses/actors, most of whose work hardly makes it out of Eastern Europe.  Ana Geislerova is currently one of the most popular actresses in the Czech Republic.  Geislerova plays Eliska, a the young woman who must hide herself in a small village and to fit in must marry Joza, a sawmill worker whose life she saved with a blood transfusion. She received her 2nd Czech Lion, the Czech Oscar, for this perfomance.  Her co-lead, Gy&ouml;rgy Cserhalmi (who looks a little like a cross between Harrison Ford and John Wayne), puts in a charismatic perfomance as Joza, the strong, taciturn, mid-50s sawmill worker. Cserhalmi has been one the leading actors in Hungary since the 1980s, performing in over 70 films.  He was nominated for a Czech Lion (his 2nd, I think) for his performance in Zelary.  As you will know after reading the DVD cover,  Eliska and Joza fall in love eventually. The actors' performances are nuanced and *completely* believeable as their relationship changes from awkward and reserved to intimate.Other reviews capably discuss the plot.  Instead I'll review other production aspects and give some other background.Review of the subtitles and translationThe English subtitles are well-done and accurate. But there were a couple scenes where the Czech meaning was noticeably lost because of differences in the structure of English versus Czech.  In the beginning on the train, they are speaking using formal noun and verb endings, which are used for people who are not friends or family.  Then Eliska says ""We shouldn't be so formal"" (meaning they are supposed to be pretending to not be strangers), but it's poorly translated as ""We needn't be so formal"".  Joza then proceeds to use the formal structure again and Eliska, somewhat irritatingly, corrects him and makes him repeat after her with informal endings.  If you don't understand what's being said, it's confusing why Eliska seems to be trying to teach him how to talk. Later right after they get off the train, Joza uses the formal structure (again) to tell her to be careful about the mud, and her sarcastic response (in Czech) is ""Are you capable of being of speaking informally?"" to which he responds, tersely, ""I am"" (meaning ""I am capable of that"").  However, in the film the translation of this dialogue is ""Must you be so formal?"" to which he responds, ""No"". This does not capture the sarcastic tone of Eliska's actual phrasing in Czech.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is difficult to get outside the Czech Republic. You can find it at eshop.evropa2.cz, but the site is in Czech. You'll need to search for Zelary. Look for the box marked 'hledej' (means 'search') and type in zelary. This should bring up the soundtrack where you can listen to clips at least.  The soundtrack is available on the PAL version of the film that was released in the Czech Republic.  You'll find it here: cdmusic.cz (the site is in English, and is by the way a good source for Czech films, most subtitled).  Warning the soundtrack seems to be at least partially taken from the movie and has some dialogue.  The NTSC version of the DVD comes with English and French subtitles.  The PAL version has Czech, English, and German subtitles.Other stuff on the DVDThere is a short film on ""The making of Zelary"".  This is good.  Make sure to check this out.  There is also a short film on ""Going to the Oscars"".  This is ho-hum.  The PAL version has the soundtrack and a photo-gallery of shots from the filming and from the film.  The photogallery and soundtrack are NOT on the NTSC version.Trivia* There is a 28-year difference between the 2 leads.  Geislerova was born in 1976 and Cserhalmi in 1948.* The 2 leads did not talk at all off the set.  Geislerova: ""We knew each other only as characters in the film.""  There was a language barrier between the leads since Cserhalmi is Hungarian and Geislerova is Czech.* Cserhalmi delivered many of his lines in Hungarian and Czech was dubbed over later.  Geislerova wanted him to do this, since his Czech was breaking her concentration.  Geislerova said in an interview: ""I didn't understand a word he was saying.""* The doctor, Richard, was played by the director's brother.* The actor, Miroslav Donutil, who played the priest is famous as a comic actor and comedian in the Czech Republic.* Zene, the mother of Helenka in the film, is played by a famous Czech singer.* The script is based on the autobiographical novella, 'Jozova Hanule' (Joe's Annie), by Kv&#283;ta Leg&aacute;tov&aacute;.  It has been translated into Croatian, German (under the title Der Mann aus Zelery) and Spanish (under the title La Transformacion).

872799,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006SGYLA,Grady Harp,"[12, 14]","ZELARY is a brilliantly written (adapted from a novel by Kveta Legatura), grandly and sensitively directed (by Ondrej Trojan) epic from the Czech Republic that deserves the attention of a wide audience.  It ranks in the realm of 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The English Patient', 'Charlotte Grey', and other big films about the struggles of love and living in the time of WW II.Eliska (the delicately, radiantly beautiful Anna Geislerova) is a well-to-do medical student in 1940, in love with a doctor but also committed to the Czech Resistance Movement against the Nazis. The war closes in on her and her friends and she is forced to abruptly leave the life and status she has loved to avoid capture by the Gestapo.  Reluctantly she agrees to leave with a humble sawmill worker Joza (Gyorgy Cserhalmi) from a remote town called Zelary.  Joza is recuperating from war wounds and was tended by Eliska in the hospital.  The plan is to have Eliska 'marry' Joza as cover and hide in Zelary until it is safe to return.At first Eliska is appalled by the barebones existence she finds in Zelary and is repulsed by the idea of blending in, an idea which extends to marrying Joza.  But gradually Eliska (now under the pseudonym Hana) grows to appreciate the simplicity of life in Zelary and even falls in love with Joza.  She lives in the beautiful hills of Slovakia in a simple paradise, becoming an intricate member of this tiny town.  The Nazis discover the hiding place but Joza and her townspeople successfully hide her.  At last the war is ending and Russian soldiers come to free the fears of the townsfolk of Zelary.  Situations occur that make the 'liberators' seem no different than the oppressors, and the film ends with Eliska/Hana's life forever changed.The acting from the large cast is uniformly excellent, from the children to the old folk.  The settings are brilliantly photographed and the lighting, costumes, music, and direction are of the highest order.  While this is an unabashedly romantic film, it never forgets to pause for moments of universal truths about mankind's interactions and dreams and the survival of love against horrendous odds.  This is a superb film, over two and a half hours in length, which never loses your urgent interest for a moment.  Highly Recommended. In Czech, Russian, and German with subtitles.

872800,A10F5LMYPXQYDF,B0006SGYLA,grerp,"[19, 31]","Zelary was on many reviewers' Best of 2005 lists, but what these people saw, I guess I'm missing.  It is beautifully filmed, and the story maintains a certain tension throughout as you wait to see whether Eliska/Hana will be found by the Nazis, but it fails on at least on major level and ends on a note of pointless bloodshed and tragedy.The first clue that this might not be for me was right in the opening scene: Eliska comes home with her doctor boyfriend and the two of them have sex.  Now, at this point, you know nothing about either of them, except that they are well dressed and live in apparent comfort.  Since nothing about the characters or the relationship has been established, watching them get it on really adds nothing to the experience.  Perhaps this is the director's way of telegraphing that Eliska is a modern girl - she has sex! In 1943! - but since you don't know if they are married or not, that revelation is saved for later.And then - poof - within just a few minutes, Eliska's life in Prague and with her lover is over anyway, and she has to go into hiding for her work with the resistance.  Joza, man she has nursed back to health from a sawmill accident is persuaded to take her back to his little mountain town and marry her.  There she can live relatively freely.  Eliska goes, but she's not happy about it or gracious.  She grieves for her former life and is contemptuous of Joza and the villagers.The rest of the movie is more or less a series of not-very-interconnected village stories that involve Eliska and Joza in some respect.  Village life is hard; poverty is ever-present.  Some neighbors are kind, but the village is also filled with the usual domestic malice: abuse, rape, alcoholism, intolerance.  One man hounds Eliska for sex, even as she is falling for her new husband.  It's a hard place to be a woman, a place with the constant threat of victimization hanging overhead.  Eliska, for all of her education and modern ways, only survives it; it's unclear whether she grows from her interaction with the villagers or not.  Those relationships go largely unexplored, with the exception of the one she makes with the local midwife/healer.The central conflict of the movie - will she learn to value Joza and village life over her former life - is never satisfactorily resolved because in the final moments of the movie, tragedy happens and Eliska doesn't have to decide.  Which makes the what precedes this - all of those more-or-less interconnected stories - seem rather pointless.Eliska's relationship with Joza is never delved into either.  In the beginning she is repulsed by him, but after a few quickly managed modifications - his bathing and his putting in a new floor for her - she finds him good enough to bed.  Their relationship develops over time to become tender and supportive, but the basis of their love, why exactly they connect outside of pure proximity, never gets explained.Finally, anyone looking for a remotely happy ending should be forewarned.  The last twenty minutes are a splash of unexpected violence and several sympathetic characters die and pointlessly.Points must be given for the unusual choice of making the village priest a good and holy, though human, individual, but overall this a flawed piece.",3,Ultimately irritating and unsatisfying,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,3274,"['Zelary', 'was', 'many', 'reviewers', 'Best', '2005', 'lists', 'what', 'people', 'saw', 'guess', ""'m"", 'missing', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'certain', 'tension', 'wait', 'see', 'Eliska/Hana', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'Nazis', 'least', 'major', 'level', 'note', 'pointless', 'bloodshed', 'tragedy.The', 'first', 'clue', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'was', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', 'Eliska', 'home', 'doctor', 'boyfriend', 'two', 'have', 'sex', 'Now', 'point', 'know', 'nothing', 'are', 'well', 'dressed', 'live', 'apparent', 'comfort', 'nothing', 'characters', 'relationship', 'been', 'established', 'watching', 'get', 'really', 'nothing', 'experience', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'way', 'telegraphing', 'Eliska', 'modern', 'girl', 'sex', '1943', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'married', 'not', 'revelation', 'saved', 'later.And', 'then', 'poof', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'Eliska', 'life', 'Prague', 'lover', 'anyway', 'go', 'hiding', 'work', 'resistance', 'Joza', 'man', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'sawmill', 'accident', 'persuaded', 'take', 'back', 'little', 'mountain', 'town', 'marry', 'can', 'live', 'relatively', 'freely', 'Eliska', 'not', 'happy', 'gracious', 'former', 'life', 'contemptuous', 'Joza', 'villagers.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'series', 'not-very-interconnected', 'village', 'stories', 'involve', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 'respect', 'Village', 'life', 'hard', 'poverty', 'ever-present', 'neighbors', 'are', 'kind', 'village', 'also', 'filled', 'usual', 'domestic', 'malice', 'abuse', 'rape', 'alcoholism', 'intolerance', 'One', 'man', 'Eliska', 'sex', 'even', 'falling', 'new', 'husband', 'hard', 'place', 'be', 'woman', 'place', 'constant', 'threat', 'victimization', 'hanging', 'overhead', 'Eliska', 'education', 'modern', 'ways', 'only', 'unclear', 'interaction', 'villagers', 'not', 'relationships', 'go', 'largely', 'unexplored', 'exception', 'one', 'local', 'midwife/healer.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'movie', 'will', 'learn', 'value', 'Joza', 'village', 'life', 'former', 'life', 'never', 'satisfactorily', 'resolved', 'because', 'final', 'moments', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'happens', 'Eliska', ""n't"", 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'more-or-less', 'interconnected', 'stories', 'seem', 'rather', 'pointless.Eliska', 'relationship', 'Joza', 'never', 'delved', 'beginning', 'repulsed', 'few', 'quickly', 'managed', 'modifications', 'bathing', 'putting', 'new', 'floor', 'good', 'enough', 'bed', 'relationship', 'time', 'become', 'tender', 'supportive', 'basis', 'love', 'why', 'exactly', 'connect', 'pure', 'proximity', 'never', 'explained.Finally', 'anyone', 'looking', 'remotely', 'happy', 'ending', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'splash', 'unexpected', 'violence', 'several', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'die', 'pointlessly.Points', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'unusual', 'choice', 'making', 'village', 'priest', 'good', 'holy', 'human', 'individual', 'overall', 'flawed', 'piece']",N/A

ZELARY is the most recent, following on SHALL WE DANCE. I should schedule an appointment with my Family Practice witchdoctor to have my hormone levels checked. I'll know I'm in dire straits if I become addicted to the Home and Garden TV channel.It's Nazi-occupied Prague in 1943. Young Eliska (Anna Geislerov&aacute;) is a nurse in one of the city's hospitals and lover to one of its staff surgeons. In her spare time, she's a courier for the local Resistance. When one of the network is captured by the Gestapo, it's decided to evacuate Eliska to the mountain hamlet of Zelary accompanied by one of its residents, Joza (Gy&ouml;rgy Cserhalmi), a much older man that Eliska recently nursed back to health after his injury in a sawmill accident. So that her sanctuary in the village seems natural, and in order that she be accepted by the other inhabitants, Eliska and Joza wed. For the city-bred and sophisticated Eliska, her marriage in this rustic place is hardly an act of love. While Jozy is a good and kind man, he's also a rural bumpkin, who lives in a dirt-floor cabin without electricity, running water, or an indoor loo; he doesn't even take regular baths.As you would correctly infer from the title of this review, this alliance of necessity turns into a love affair. The charm of this beautifully photographed film is that the story unfolds without the saccharine sweetness of a fairy tale romance. Indeed, after two years in the mountains, by which time the area is, um, ""liberated"" by advancing Soviet troops, Eliska experiences both the sublime and sordid facets of human communal existence anywhere. An ending perhaps more tragic than the true romantic would prefer doesn't negate the fact that the story illustrates the old saw that ""love is where you find it"", and that in anyone's past there may be a time span and experiences that add to his/her character depths that are unplumbable to current friends and lovers.All of the acting performances in ZELARY were excellent, and that of Cserhalmi as the simple, salt-of-the-earth Joza was especially engaging. ZELARY was a viewing pleasure that I didn't want to end. And if that doesn't indicate a five-star film, then I don't know what does.",5,Love is where you find it,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2302,"['Recently', ""'ve"", 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'couple', 'films', ""'d"", 'characterize', 'chick', 'flicks', 'ZELARY', 'most', 'recent', 'following', 'SHALL', 'WE', 'DANCE', 'should', 'schedule', 'appointment', 'Family', 'Practice', 'witchdoctor', 'have', 'hormone', 'levels', 'checked', ""'ll"", 'know', ""'m"", 'dire', 'straits', 'become', 'addicted', 'Home', 'Garden', 'TV', 'channel.It', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Prague', '1943', 'Young', 'Eliska', 'Anna', 'Geislerov', 'aacute', 'nurse', 'one', 'city', 'hospitals', 'lover', 'one', 'staff', 'surgeons', 'spare', 'time', 'courier', 'local', 'Resistance', 'When', 'one', 'network', 'captured', 'Gestapo', 'decided', 'evacuate', 'Eliska', 'mountain', 'hamlet', 'Zelary', 'accompanied', 'one', 'residents', 'Joza', 'Gy', 'ouml', 'Cserhalmi', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'Eliska', 'recently', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'injury', 'sawmill', 'accident', 'sanctuary', 'village', 'natural', 'order', 'be', 'accepted', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'Eliska', 'Joza', 'wed.', 'city-bred', 'sophisticated', 'Eliska', 'marriage', 'rustic', 'place', 'hardly', 'act', 'love', 'Jozy', 'good', 'kind', 'man', 'also', 'rural', 'bumpkin', 'who', 'dirt-floor', 'cabin', 'electricity', 'running', 'water', 'indoor', 'loo', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'regular', 'baths.As', 'would', 'correctly', 'infer', 'title', 'review', 'alliance', 'necessity', 'love', 'affair', 'charm', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'film', 'story', 'saccharine', 'sweetness', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance', 'Indeed', 'two', 'years', 'mountains', 'time', 'area', 'um', 'liberated', 'advancing', 'Soviet', 'troops', 'Eliska', 'sublime', 'sordid', 'facets', 'human', 'communal', 'existence', 'anywhere', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'more', 'tragic', 'true', 'romantic', 'would', 'prefer', ""n't"", 'negate', 'fact', 'story', 'old', 'saw', 'love', 'where', 'find', 'anyone', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'span', 'experiences', 'add', 'his/her', 'character', 'depths', 'are', 'unplumbable', 'current', 'friends', 'lovers.All', 'acting', 'performances', 'ZELARY', 'were', 'excellent', 'Cserhalmi', 'simple', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'Joza', 'was', 'especially', 'engaging', 'ZELARY', 'was', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', ""n't"", 'indicate', 'five-star', 'film', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what']",N/A

The story of a privileged beauty who is transformed by war and sacrifice into a paragon of resilience keeps popping up in film: Catherine Deneuve in Indochine (1992), Sandrine Bonnaire in East-West (1999), Nicole Kidman in last year's Cold Mountain.Zelary is the Czech version, an old-fashioned character-driven domestic epic which was adapted from an novel by Kveta Legatova. Set in the Second World War against the background of the German occupation, the film was selected as the Czech Republic's Oscar nomination last year. A return to directing for Ondrej Trojan (Let's All Sing Around) after more than a decade as a producer, Zelary is a trite but sturdy offering, a showcase for popular young Czech actress Anna Geislerova, as well as the beautiful Moravian countryside, shot in glowing earthy tones.Geislerova plays Eliska, a medical student who has been denied a chance to finish her degree because of the German occupation. She works as a nurse, but is also involved in the resistance movement with her lover, a surgeon named Richard (Ivan Trojan). One night a sawmill worker, Joseph (Hungarian actor Gyorgy Cserhalmi), from a rural community is brought into the hospital badly injured. Eliska provides the blood he needs for a transfusion. Shortly after, the Gestapo uncovers the resistance group that Eliska belongs to and she is forced to escape. Joseph, or Jova for short, agrees to take her back to his rural village of Zelary.Initially the conditions, a dirt floor and no running water, shock her but she has no choice but to stay. She takes on an assumed identity, as Hana, and goes through a marriage ceremony to avoid suspicion from the local villagers.Hana becomes acclimatized to her new housewifely life surprisingly quickly as she discovers, as women so often do in romance novels, that a hulking, taciturn man can meet nearly all her needs. Jova proves himself both a font of compassion and pillar of strength, providing Hana with a wooden floor and defending her from a rapist before they eventually become lovers.While Hana bonds with her woodcutter, the script provides some welcome additional village texture. There's that Czech cinema staple, the precocious child (Anna Vertelarova) and her pragmatic widowed mother, as well as a bureaucratic school principal and his friend, a compassionate priest. There's also an ancient midwife (Jaroslava Adamova) who teaches Hana folk medicine. The most trenchant subplot concerns the local drunk who beats his wife and son: Their imprisonment serves as a contrast to the caring imprisonment that Hana faces.The German army, lurking in the nearby hills, pops up periodically to add a jolt of suspense. Unfortunately, Zelary doesn't end with the war.Soon the ruthless Germans are replaced by the loutish, drunken, raping soldiers of the Soviet army and Zelary is in for a whole new round of problems. By this point -- well past the two-hour mark -- the endlessly episodic nature of Eliska/Hana's trials begins to provoke fatigue more than sympathy. ""Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart,"" wrote the poet William Butler Yeats. And too much history can make any long-suffering heroine overstay her welcome.

I had guessed that it was a Serbian film but I'm guessing it is a Slovakian (Czech?) film and that we were looking at rural life in the Carpathian Mountains during WWII.  We discover early on that our heroine is knowingly involved in the underground/resistance in Prague.  However, she didn't seem to have counted the cost because when something goes wrong, she's wisked away to safety off into the mountains.  This was not her idea and she did what she could to reverse her fortune until it was finally spelled out for her.  To be able to blend in to the tight mountain community, it is necessary for her to marry an older man she met in a hospital in Prague.  That's as far as I dare go into the plot.  The events and personalities that emerge from this 2 1/2 hour film make for a very engrossing movie.  Naturally the concept of Nazi occupation (these folks are not Germans as they are quick to point out) adds a degree of suspense.  The idea that our young heroine is in hiding expands on that suspense.  However, there are other sources of suspense, excitement, humor, love, understanding etc.  The relationship between the newlyweds naturally takes the forefront of the film.  However, the supporting cast is very good and their roles and escapades make for a well-rounded movie.The ending builds to a crescendo that leaves us rather emotionally drained (we're pretty involved with these folks by that point in the movie).  The final scene was interesting.  Maybe it was the fact that my surround sound was working well last night but I was captivated by the background music.  It certainly enhanced the moods the film emoted.  I also couldn't get over my impression that the leading man looked like a middle-aged Hugh Hefner on a moderate diet of steroids.  There are a few times when I might have been as bewildered as our runaway bride but everything eventually comes together.  If there was an overall message to be gained from ""Zalary"", I would guess it was, ""You never know who your heros or villans will end up being"".

To escape certain death, she is hidden in the rural area of the country where no one knows her true identity.  To make sure she blends well with the locals, local priest, schoolmaster and her protector decide that the best thing to do in this situation is to marry her off to a local peasant.

I had a little problem with the way their relationship ends (a little bit too convenient for the purposes of the story closure, in my opinion).

872814,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0006SGYLA,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[1, 1]","The length and complexity of this ambitious Czech film (exteriors were shot in Slovakia) reveal its literary origins as a novel about a young woman with connections to the Resistance who is whisked away into hiding during the Nazi occupation of Prague. She quickly must adjust to life in a mountain village far from the urbane milieu she has been used to. And she must also adjust to the villager whom she must marry in order to preserve her new identity. It's a romantic film (in the scale of David Lean) with sweeping vistas of mountain scenery in all seasons of the year, a large cast of supporting characters, and frequent reminders of the perilous state in which they all live, as the Nazi occupiers are continually searching out partisans and their sympathizers.A smaller film would no doubt have focused more on the evolving relationship between the educated and thoroughly modern young woman and her much older sawmill worker of a husband, whose tentativeness with her (and need for a bath) account in part for the fact that he is still a bachelor in mid-life. The two leads provide some nuanced scenes marking the evolution of their relationship, but in an effort to portray more of the village life that's the context of their story, there is a host of other characters and subplots, many of them written in a kind of shorthand that verges on stereotype. So a viewer can often feel a step ahead of the film, anticipating what we've been set up to expect, and its 2.5 hour length can seem rather more than that.Winner of many awards, it was not surprisingly nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film in 2003 (the winner was Pedro Almodovar's ""Talk To Her""). And it definitely rewards the viewing, particularly as it attempts to portray a way of life that the modern world in 1943 had left behind - and in the performances of its two leads, who make an improbable love affair confidently plausible.
