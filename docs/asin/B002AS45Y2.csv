These two films are confusing beyond belief and make no real sense at all. The characters appear to exist only to be tortured and killed. This is really nothing but an attempt by filmmakers with no clue about the horror genre to jump on the torture porn bandwagon.,2,Annoying Beyond Belief,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,362,"['Rest', 'Stop', 'film', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'pointless', 'annoying', 'ones', 'too', 'be', 'released', 'ages', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'confusing', 'belief', 'make', 'real', 'sense', 'characters', 'appear', 'exist', 'only', 'be', 'tortured', 'killed', 'really', 'nothing', 'attempt', 'filmmakers', 'clue', 'horror', 'genre', 'jump', 'torture', 'porn', 'bandwagon']",Rest Stop

1259016,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B002AS45Y2,Einsatz,"[2, 2]","Dead Ahead & Don't Look Back.  Yes, it was nice having them both contained in one neat package.  But, saving on shelving space aside, not that great as movies go.  Both were riddled with stupidity and cliches (as advertisements for cell phones; not a good deal, they never work in horror movies).  And I still say, hiking out was the best option since the area the ghosts roam wasn't that expansive.  Instead, the victims stubbornly stayed close to home, one getting drunk in the bargain!The first movie didn't work because the two main characters were annoying creeps, I was waiting for them to be dispatched as quickly as possible, unfortunately, they didn't go quickly.  Making me suffer.  (If I had to witness one more quick change emotion from that lousy actress I was going to scream!  She was literally all over the place.)  It also didn't help that the music was too loud and just as obnoxious.  Low budget all the way, surprising because of the claim that the writer/executive producer of the TV show Supernatural had control of both films.  Not a good recommendation for the TV show.  (One presumes he did these movies because they allowed him to use nudity.)Okay, yes, there were a couple of BOO moments that made me jump.  That does not a good horror film make, there's more to it than that.I will say liked the second film slightly more, mostly because of the new cast.  Everything didn't rest on one person in the second.  As for the motorhome family...character types no one bothered to flesh out.  Tedious, but brief; I couldn't take a whole movie of just them.  Their appearence in both films, while necessary to the plots, was jarring to say the least.  Base comedy tends to detract rather than aid a story; it not only slows things down, it diverts the action causing the movie to stall.Needless to say, not keepers (didn't mind seeing them, but I wouldn't want to see them again).",2,"Cheap, but I think they meant inexpensive",1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1900,"['Dead', 'Ahead', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'Yes', 'was', 'nice', 'having', 'contained', 'one', 'neat', 'package', 'saving', 'shelving', 'space', 'aside', 'not', 'that', 'great', 'movies', 'go', 'were', 'riddled', 'stupidity', 'cliches', 'advertisements', 'cell', 'phones', 'not', 'good', 'deal', 'never', 'work', 'horror', 'movies', 'still', 'say', 'hiking', 'out', 'was', 'best', 'option', 'area', 'ghosts', 'roam', 'was', ""n't"", 'expansive', 'Instead', 'victims', 'stubbornly', 'stayed', 'close', 'home', 'one', 'getting', 'drunk', 'bargain', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'annoying', 'creeps', 'was', 'waiting', 'be', 'dispatched', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'quickly', 'Making', 'suffer', 'had', 'witness', 'one', 'more', 'quick', 'change', 'emotion', 'lousy', 'actress', 'was', 'going', 'scream', 'was', 'literally', 'place', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'just', 'obnoxious', 'Low', 'budget', 'way', 'surprising', 'claim', 'writer/executive', 'producer', 'TV', 'show', 'Supernatural', 'had', 'control', 'films', 'Not', 'good', 'recommendation', 'TV', 'show', 'One', 'did', 'movies', 'allowed', 'use', 'nudity', 'Okay', 'yes', 'were', 'couple', 'BOO', 'moments', 'made', 'jump', 'not', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'that.I', 'will', 'say', 'liked', 'second', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'mostly', 'new', 'cast', 'Everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'rest', 'one', 'person', 'second', 'motorhome', 'family', 'character', 'one', 'bothered', 'flesh', 'out', 'Tedious', 'brief', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'appearence', 'films', 'necessary', 'plots', 'was', 'jarring', 'say', 'least', 'Base', 'comedy', 'detract', 'rather', 'aid', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'down', 'action', 'causing', 'movie', 'stall.Needless', 'say', 'not', 'keepers', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again']",Rest Stop
1259017,A2AL6L3FHI3RHL,B002AS45Y2,Hotmuscleman,"[4, 4]","I thought Rest stop and rest stop 2 were both good horror movies. but not great. the first rest stop starts with a young couple going to California to be movie stars. when the girl stops at a rest stop her boyfriend disappears and a mystery truck appears bothering her throughout the movie, along with a crazy traveling family in a van who are religious fanatics.the couple in the winnabago van have crazy twin sons and a son that's a deformed dwarf that keeps taking pictures of people with a 1970's poloroid camera!. I think this crazy religious family is a great add on in the movie. they torment the girl like the guy in the yellow truck do. the second rest stop movie centers on the older brother of the  first boy that was killed trying to look for his brother with his girlfriend and  dorky friend-who has the hots for the girl in the first rest stop.

1259022,A2V4XS5R9ZLBBH,B002AS45Y2,"Rocket Man 1001 ""Truth seeker""","[0, 0]","My first reaction to these DVDs is that the story line was very thin--a girl and her boyfriend run away from their homes in Texas and head for Hollywood, but why? The girl seemed to have a decent home life and good parents, from what little was shown of them. On their journey they get on some back road near the California line called the &#34;Old Highway,&#34; and they pull into an old rest stop that's grungy and dirty. The girl uses the bathroom, and when she comes out her boyfriend and his car are gone.  The movie then progresses from there to mindless gore and torment. Avoid this trash like the plague, unless you enjoy seeing someone get their body drilled full of holes (yes, literally with a power drill) and having their tongue and eyes cut out. Just too gross to watch! I fast forwarded through the gore just to see how it ended, but that was a disappointment, too.  The girl throws a Molotov cocktail at the psycho in the pick-up truck that was tormenting her and her boyfriend, the truck explodes in a big fire ball, but when the flames die down enough for the girl to look into the truck to view her tormentor, he is gone. That pretty much ends the first episode, unless you view some of the alternate endings (like where the girl finally arrives home via a taxi--how did she find a taxi out on the Old Highway--and the tormentor with his truck restored follows her home).The sequel is even worse as the tormentor turns out not to be real, but some kind of spirit that won't die (according to an Indian legend) but yet the pain and wounds he inflicts on others is real.  Too hard to follow as to who is real and who is not. A lot of flashbacks/appearances of past victims makes for a very disjointed story line, and it just doesn't end with any real closure. Was the tormented spirit finally sent to heaven/hell when the eyeballs are burned? Who knows? Who cares?
