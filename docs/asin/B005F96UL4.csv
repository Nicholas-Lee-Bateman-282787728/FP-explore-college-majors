1457725,A1KQ6Z445AGKQL,B005F96UL4,Curtis A. Cecil,"[3, 5]","SnowmenSo I recieved this DVD free to review and have to say other then one 5 min section this was a great film for all ages..(From Dove.org)Synopsis:Limited Theatrical Release - SNOWMEN is a humorous and heartfelt coming-of-age story about three unlikely heroes and the winter that changed their lives forever. After a surprising discovery in the snow catapults three small-town boys into the spotlight, the best friends hatch a plan to be remembered forever by setting a Guinness World Records title. Along the way, the trio battles schoolyard bullies, unites their community and discovers that - while fame may be fleeting - true friendship lasts forever. The film stars Bobby Coleman (Last Song), Ray Liotta (Wild Hogs), Bobbie J. Thompson (Role Models), Josh Flitter (Ace Ventura Jr.) and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future).Dove Worldview:One young boy wants to leave behind a legacy, something for everyone to remember him by. Eventually he learns that ""it's not what we do that's important, so much as how we do it."" That is the gift that this truth gives. This film has heart and is very compelling to watch. Children have an amazing way in looking at things differently from adults and these three boys see the world in a much simpler way. As the three young boys work together for one common cause, they also find out what motivates a school yard bully. They reach out to him to help, and for his help too. Along the way they learn a few lessons about life, friendship and how to treat others. This is a charming story for the family and even has a few subtle faith moments. Although there are a few scenes that may be frightening for younger children, we are pleased to award this movie our Dove ""Family Approved"" Seal for ages 12 and over.The 5 min issue is that there is a scary scene where the boys are playing in a snow drift, almost burried by the plow and then a frozen body is uncovered.  My children were watching this with me and my youngest daughter was scared that night when going to bed.Other then tha moment it was great for the ENTIRE family and I would recommend it.For Christian Element I will say that there are a couple chances for this film to take a VERY Christian aproach and it unfortunatly does not.  Just talkes about being good etc...So Recommended for ages 10 and older or all ages after the scary scene.",3,Funny but not for the younger age.,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,2346,"['SnowmenSo', 'recieved', 'DVD', 'free', 'review', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'then', 'one', '5', 'min', 'section', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'ages..', 'Dove.org', 'Synopsis', 'Limited', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'SNOWMEN', 'humorous', 'heartfelt', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'three', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'winter', 'changed', 'lives', 'forever', 'surprising', 'discovery', 'snow', 'catapults', 'three', 'small-town', 'boys', 'spotlight', 'best', 'friends', 'hatch', 'plan', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever', 'setting', 'Guinness', 'World', 'Records', 'title', 'way', 'trio', 'schoolyard', 'bullies', 'community', 'discovers', 'fame', 'may', 'be', 'fleeting', 'true', 'friendship', 'forever', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Coleman', 'Last', 'Song', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'Bobbie', 'J.', 'Thompson', 'Role', 'Models', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Jr.', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Back', 'Future', '.Dove', 'Worldview', 'One', 'young', 'boy', 'leave', 'legacy', 'something', 'everyone', 'remember', 'Eventually', 'not', 'what', 'do', 'important', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'do', 'gift', 'truth', 'film', 'heart', 'very', 'compelling', 'watch', 'Children', 'have', 'amazing', 'way', 'looking', 'things', 'differently', 'adults', 'three', 'boys', 'see', 'world', 'much', 'simpler', 'way', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'common', 'cause', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'school', 'yard', 'bully', 'reach', 'out', 'help', 'help', 'too', 'way', 'learn', 'few', 'lessons', 'life', 'friendship', 'how', 'treat', 'others', 'charming', 'story', 'family', 'even', 'few', 'subtle', 'faith', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'frightening', 'younger', 'children', 'are', 'pleased', 'award', 'movie', 'Dove', 'Family', 'Approved', 'Seal', 'ages', '12', '5', 'min', 'issue', 'scary', 'scene', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'playing', 'snow', 'drift', 'almost', 'burried', 'plow', 'then', 'frozen', 'body', 'uncovered', 'children', 'were', 'watching', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'was', 'scared', 'night', 'when', 'going', 'bed.Other', 'then', 'tha', 'moment', 'was', 'great', 'ENTIRE', 'family', 'would', 'recommend', 'it.For', 'Christian', 'Element', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'couple', 'chances', 'film', 'take', 'VERY', 'Christian', 'aproach', 'unfortunatly', 'not', 'Just', 'talkes', 'being', 'good', 'etc', 'So', 'Recommended', 'ages', '10', 'older', 'ages', 'scary', 'scene']",Snowmen
