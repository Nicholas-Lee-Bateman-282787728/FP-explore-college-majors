It was refreshing to watch one that is the complete opposite. This documentary is about Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the founders of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream (and I've never had a flavor of that Ice Cream that I didn't like). There is an overview of them as kids and their growing up and how they met. You get to see how they went about starting their business.Like many successful people, there were trials and tribulations along the way and they overcame them to form a highly successful company. This is not all. The pair were and still are highly civic minded. Their efforts on the corporate side always reflected their civic thinking. They wanted to make a difference in the world and their business was a way to do that. It is nice to see, even though they have sold their company, that Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are still pushing for a better world.

The movie provides biographical information on Ben and Jerry and their formative years through college, how they came to start Ben & Jerry's and the growth of the company.  I did not actually know much about the company or how it operated and it was interesting to learn the story behind the company's good reputation.I found the biographical information interesting and Ben and Jerry contributed a lot to this film through photos and interviews.  For those interested in small business entrepreneurship, and what I found really interesting about this film, the documentary also covers the growth of the company, the many growing pains a small business can encounter, and how solutions to problems slowly but surely led them to ultimately sell control of the company to Unilever.",5,From Pint-Size to Giant - Ben & Jerry's,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,885,"['film', 'documentary', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'famous', 'ice', 'cream', 'company', 'names', 'movie', 'biographical', 'information', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'formative', 'years', 'college', 'how', 'came', 'start', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'growth', 'company', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'know', 'much', 'company', 'how', 'operated', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'story', 'company', 'good', 'reputation.I', 'found', 'biographical', 'information', 'interesting', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'contributed', 'lot', 'film', 'photos', 'interviews', 'interested', 'small', 'business', 'entrepreneurship', 'what', 'found', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'documentary', 'also', 'growth', 'company', 'many', 'growing', 'pains', 'small', 'business', 'can', 'encounter', 'how', 'solutions', 'problems', 'slowly', 'surely', 'led', 'ultimately', 'sell', 'control', 'company', 'Unilever']",Biography - Ben & Jerry's

To me Ben & Jerry's Ice cream is one of the best ice cream snacks out there.  This program follows Ben & Jerry through the good and bad times.  I just couldn't stop watching from the first minute to the last.  The most shocking thing about the whole program is that Ben & Jerry were brought out and done even own the company that has their name on it.  Both were paid well for their company, but they can't get back all the time and life's work that went behind it.Great program!",4,Biography - Ben & Jerry's,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,586,"['documentary', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'famous', 'ice', 'cream', 'company', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'program', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'Ice', 'cream', 'one', 'best', 'ice', 'cream', 'out', 'there', 'program', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'first', 'minute', 'last', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'whole', 'program', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'were', 'brought', 'out', 'done', 'even', 'own', 'company', 'name', 'were', 'paid', 'well', 'company', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'time', 'life', 'work', 'went', 'it.Great', 'program']",Biography - Ben & Jerry's
1088226,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000T28PHO,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 5]","I'm so used to successful corporations being heartless and progressive activists being penniless that it was thrilling to hear of businesspersons who could excel in these often discrepant areas.Sometimes PC causes can get one punished.  Remember when the Oscar crowd booed Michael Moore and even Steve Martin chastised him for his weight?  I loved Deee-Lite's CD ""Infinity Within"" and yet it bombed due to its saturation of causes.  Ben and Jerry impress me in that regard too.The work sets both men in the classic times of the 1960s.  If you get nostalgic over tie-dyed shirts and large protests, then you'll like seeing that.  If you like hairy, burly men (in one community, they are called ""bears""), then you will love seeing Ben and Jerry who are even seen shirtless here.  One B&J; former CEO named F. Lager has a deep, sexy chin dimple too!The narrator states that both business partners grew up in the same area and even have close birth dates.  I wondered if they shared the same religion.  The work does not discuss that, but a famous encyclopedia says they do.  The work doesn't touch upon something, but personally I am very surprised at how the business partners are not afraid to take photos that some would deem of a rainbow-flag nature.This work helped me to expand my thinking about men who work in partnerships.  I wonder if a college student could compare this disc with ones on They Might Be Giants or the Pet Shop Boys and analyze that issue for a paper.",4,The Best of Both Worlds,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,1474,"[""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'successful', 'corporations', 'being', 'heartless', 'progressive', 'activists', 'being', 'penniless', 'was', 'thrilling', 'hear', 'businesspersons', 'who', 'could', 'excel', 'often', 'discrepant', 'areas.Sometimes', 'PC', 'causes', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'punished', 'Remember', 'when', 'Oscar', 'crowd', 'booed', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'even', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'chastised', 'weight', 'loved', 'Deee-Lite', 'CD', 'Infinity', 'Within', 'yet', 'bombed', 'due', 'saturation', 'causes', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'impress', 'regard', 'too.The', 'work', 'men', 'classic', 'times', '1960s', 'get', 'nostalgic', 'tie-dyed', 'shirts', 'large', 'protests', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'seeing', 'like', 'hairy', 'burly', 'men', 'one', 'community', 'are', 'called', 'bears', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'seeing', 'Ben', 'Jerry', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'seen', 'shirtless', 'here', 'One', 'B', 'J', 'former', 'CEO', 'named', 'F.', 'Lager', 'deep', 'sexy', 'chin', 'dimple', 'too', 'narrator', 'business', 'partners', 'grew', 'up', 'same', 'area', 'even', 'have', 'close', 'birth', 'dates', 'wondered', 'shared', 'same', 'religion', 'work', 'not', 'discuss', 'famous', 'encyclopedia', 'do', 'work', ""n't"", 'touch', 'something', 'personally', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'business', 'partners', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'photos', 'would', 'deem', 'rainbow-flag', 'nature.This', 'work', 'helped', 'expand', 'thinking', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'partnerships', 'wonder', 'college', 'student', 'could', 'compare', 'disc', 'ones', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'analyze', 'issue', 'paper']",Biography - Ben & Jerry's

I really enjoyed watching it, although I would have loved for them to get more descriptive on the ice cream aspect of things along with all the business and social consciousness they showed for the company.Ben & Jerry were born within days of each other, and during school became fast friends over not being fast enough to run a mile in normal time.  After having lackluster experiences in college and their love lives, they decided to open a restaurant business.  But they weren't sure what they were going to do until they finally hit on ice cream.  And they made it a success.  Teaching themselves to make ice cream they made a plan for not only producing a good product, but also giving back and making their business not only profitable for themselves, but also for the community as well.  The documentary details their becoming a publicly traded company and the eventual buyout they couldn't control as well.Ben & Jerry are fantastic guys.  It takes a very imaginative mind to take some incredibly good ice cream and do good with it as well.  They were visionaries.  And they just seem really nice too.  What they are doing is genuine and they really believe in their work.  I just am very impressed with them.  I was greatly surprised by the buyout.  I didn't realize that had happened but was happy that both are still active in the company and making sure it's still socially responsible.From a visual aspect this was much like other documentaries.  There were interviews with people, shots of the different factories, etc.  But it was done in an easy way.  They seemed well thought out and everything they said was interesting and important.  As said before I would have liked to hear more about the ice cream itself.  They touched on it a little bit with the milk coming from Vermont cows and where some of the other ingredients came from.  But I would have loved to hear some about the inspiration behind the different flavors.A very good documentary about some of the best ice cream out there.  If you didn't like Ben & Jerry before, you will after watching this documentary.Review by M.
