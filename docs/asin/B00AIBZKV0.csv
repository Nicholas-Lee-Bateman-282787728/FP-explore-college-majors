This is one of them. There isn't much to even compare to the original movie. We have the main character and we pick up with what happens to her from the end of the first movie. The rest just falls flat. There isn't anything scary about this movie other than a few shadows jumping out in a feeble attempt to startle the viewer. Even that didn't work. All in all, this movie was a serious let down and I can't recommend it. If you want to watch a scary/supernatural movie, just rewatch the first 'The Last Exoticism'.",2,Typical Sequel,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,639,"['whole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'sequel', 'capture', 'feeling', 'first', 'one', 'gave', 'Most', 'time', 'sequels', 'fail', 'one', ""n't"", 'much', 'even', 'compare', 'original', 'movie', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'rest', 'just', 'flat', ""n't"", 'anything', 'scary', 'movie', 'other', 'few', 'shadows', 'jumping', 'out', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'startle', 'viewer', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'was', 'serious', 'let', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'want', 'watch', 'scary/supernatural', 'movie', 'just', 'rewatch', 'first', 'Last', 'Exoticism']",N/A

1611426,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00AIBZKV0,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","Awhile ago, I watched ""The Last Exorcism.""  Today, I watched ""The Last, Last Exorcism,"" or was that ""The Last Exorcism Part 2""?  But I really think they're lying; without giving anything away, the ending in this follow up strongly suggests ""The Last, Last, Last Exorcism, and I Really, Really Mean it This Time!""  Don't know how they're going to fit that title on the Marguee, though.This film is actually fairly original, if you wave your hands a bit on the films that it stole, err, ""borrowed"" from:  ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Exorcist 2:  The Heretic"" (and you'd have to be a heretic to like that dog), ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" (this one's a little hazy to me since I saw it so long ago though), ""The Believers"" (once again, hazy), and, believe it or not, and yes last but not least -- and I really mean it this time -- ""Carrie.""  Well, maybe it's not exactly completely original I guess.This film is set in New Orleans, which I thought was a good idea.  After all, there's lots of witchcraft there, and there's lots of Voodoo there as well.  We all know that Voodoo is bad now, mmkay?  'Cause Voodoo means that you really dislike somebody and want to do bad things to him or her.  And that's just not right.  But Ashley Bell, who returns as Nell -- she was quite terrific in the first movie and is quite good here as well -- doesn't want to do bad things to other people; she really doesn't.  But she just can't quite help herself.  Why?  Well, I think that that question leads us to a possible theme. . . .""A tiger never changes her stripes.""  Oh, and perhaps, ""The past will come back to haunt you whether you like it or not.""  That latter idea seems to be the major theme, while the former could be a minor theme.  But they seem to stick with these themes for the entirety of the film, and I think that that was a smart move; a film with a strong theme is always a good idea.But unfortunately, I can't quite say that this is exactly a strong film.  I did like it a bit, and I did jump out of my seat quite a few times.  It's probably really a 3.5, but I decided to round down today -- not because I want to do bad things to this film, cause that just wouldn't be right -- but rather because I think that it ""borrowed"" from a few too many other films and therefore lost some originality.",3,"It's the Last One, I Swear!",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2293,"['Awhile', 'ago', 'watched', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Today', 'watched', 'Last', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'was', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Part', '2', 'really', 'think', ""'re"", 'lying', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'ending', 'follow', 'up', 'strongly', 'Last', 'Last', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Really', 'Really', 'Mean', 'Time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'fit', 'title', 'Marguee', 'though.This', 'film', 'actually', 'fairly', 'original', 'wave', 'hands', 'bit', 'films', 'stole', 'err', 'borrowed', 'Exorcist', 'Exorcist', '2', 'Heretic', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'heretic', 'like', 'dog', 'Serpent', 'Rainbow', 'one', 'little', 'hazy', 'saw', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Believers', 'once', 'again', 'hazy', 'believe', 'not', 'yes', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'really', 'mean', 'time', 'Carrie', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'completely', 'original', 'guess.This', 'film', 'set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'lots', 'witchcraft', 'there', 'lots', 'Voodoo', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'Voodoo', 'bad', 'now', 'mmkay', 'Voodoo', 'really', 'dislike', 'somebody', 'want', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'who', 'as', 'Nell', 'was', 'quite', 'terrific', 'first', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'really', ""n't"", 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'help', 'Why', 'Well', 'think', 'question', 'possible', 'theme', 'A', 'tiger', 'never', 'stripes', 'Oh', 'perhaps', 'past', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'not', 'latter', 'idea', 'be', 'major', 'theme', 'former', 'could', 'be', 'minor', 'theme', 'seem', 'stick', 'themes', 'entirety', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'film', 'strong', 'theme', 'always', 'good', 'idea.But', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'say', 'exactly', 'strong', 'film', 'did', 'like', 'bit', 'did', 'jump', 'seat', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'probably', 'really', '3.5', 'decided', 'round', 'down', 'today', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'cause', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'rather', 'think', 'borrowed', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'therefore', 'lost', 'originality']",N/A

For all its posturing, shadows, ghosties, ad nauseum, it NEVER paid off.  The viewer never really sees ANYTHING--no demon, no blood, no nudity--zip.  Supposedly a sequel to ""The Last Exorcism"" (released about 4-5 years ago?), this mind-numbingly boring sequel takes place with the demon Abalam's love interest showing up in someone's home, scratching the man and scaring the woman, then being hospitalized and taken to a girl's home.  At first, things seem normal enough for her, but as time marches on, she realizes that NOTHING is normal in her life...and never will be.  You might think that would make for interesting watching, but you'd be DEAD wrong.One of the biggest problems I had with this movie was the (mis-)casting of its principle character.  If she was 17, then I'm 25 and did all of Channing Tatum's dancing in ""Magic Mike.""  Problem with that is I'll turn 60 tomorrow, and I could only wish on my best day that I looked like Mr. Tatum.  Everyone else in the school for wayward girlies looked their age, but not our main character.  And there were way too many closeups of her.  Perhaps if they'd kept that camera away from her, she might have passed muster, but no such luck.  And the script was just all over the place and did not make one iota of sense.  Another question that popped out for me was why was the version I watched unrated?  There was absolutely NOTHING in it to deserve the rating, but I guess the distributors of the film needed some way to make back a little of their money.  Oh, and if the writers thought being a contortionist is scary, they were also wrong.Another complete waste of time.  As stated above, I watched the unrated version.

1611437,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00AIBZKV0,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has generously released ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" on Blu-ray and DVD for those smart enough to have avoided it in theaters, but brave (or stupid?) enough to give it a chance at home. I know it's too late for some. Hopefully, my review can still save thousands of others from making the same mistake I did.Eli Roth's ""The Last Exorcism"" was a ""found footage"" movie I really wanted to like. Against my better judgment, I went to see it in the theater and weathered through the first 70 minutes fighting off motion sickness the entire time. I was pleased with it until it unraveled in the last 5 minutes into a disappointing blend of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Rosemary's Baby.""""The Last Exorcism Part II"" picks up with Nell Sweetzer going to live in a girl's home after the tragic events of the first movie. Things seem to be going well as she settles in to her new life by making friends, getting a job, and experiencing her first romantic relationship. Unfortunately, the demon Abalam has followed her to New Orleans and is jealous of her newfound friends and love life. He wants Nell for himself and will stop at nothing to re-take her soul.How I thought a follow-up with the ridiculous title ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" would undo any of the damage done by the first film's pedestrian conclusion remains to be seen. It's my own fault for having ANY expectations going into this completely unnecessary sequel. To say there's no reason for this to exist would be foolish, as the box office take proves otherwise. Good or bad, it paid for itself and made enough money to justify its existence financially.There are a couple positive aspects I can talk about in regards to ""The Last Exorcism Part II."" Ashley Bell's performance as demon-oppressed Nell Sweetzer is so captivating and heartfelt that it gives the movie an emotional depth it doesn't deserve. She's been rightfully compared to Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie."" Bell is destined to shine in much better films in the future.The second thing that makes this movie easier to stomach than the first is its lack of shaky-cam cinematography. What you see on screen might be mediocre and dull, but at least your eyes can focus on it. You'll have no need for an airplane barf bag when watching this.Everything else found in ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" is recycled filler at best. We're supposed to believe the demon is in love with Nell. This is displayed in an awkward scene where she is levitated off her bed ""Exorcist"" style and then sexually manhandled by the invisible Abalam. All this is happening right next to her sleeping roommate.The physical embodiment of Abalam is laughable at best. Basically, it's a person in regular street clothing and hoodie wearing a mask for a masquerade ball. This is the best idea Co-writer Damien Chazelle and Director / Co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly could come up with?Although the rest of the movie is nothing to get excited over, the climax and ending of the film is where it completely falls apart. Once again, a horror movie about demon possession finds the ""good guys"" seeking out a solution to the problem through other avenues besides the obvious. It's convenient that in every one of these movies there's never a priest or pastor around who truly has strong enough faith to exorcise the demon from the victim.This time, a secret organization known as the Order of the Right Hand who use Haitian voodoo rituals and the conjuring of Baron Samedi is called upon to lure the demon out of Nell's body. Use the powers of a Haitian Voodoo spirit known for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and his love of tobacco and rum to battle a demon intent on possessing a girl? If it doesn't sound like this strategy makes a lot of sense, it's because it DOESN'T!Extra features for the DVD release of ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" are more entertaining than the movie itself. A featurette entitled ""Hair Salon Scare"" shows people getting groomed in front of a two-way mirror. The image of a freaky girl resembling Nell appears through the glass and scares the customers.

I hate writing bad reviews because I actually had the chance to see Ashley Bell in person (I had the lucky chance of attending the movie premiere with her in attendance). She's a really genuine sweetheart who loves her fans, but this movie franchise doesn't really offer much of her talents.Essentially this is the same role from last movie with no real big differences.Ashley's character of &#34;Nell&#34; is rescued or found from the last movie. She gets sets up in a boarding house with other girls who have lost their way in life.The man in charge of the place is Frank Merle (Muse Watson). Muse puts in a very good performance. It's just too bad that like Ashley it's wasted on a really terrible film.Anyways, it doesn't take too long before Nell's demon comes back to stalk her.Like I said the movie is just &#34;The Last Exorcism 1 and 1/2&#34; except it throws away all the things that made the first one a bit of cult hit: The documentary/ found footage format, the serious tone, some interesting twists.The only minor differences is that you see Nell briefly enjoy a normal life. She even gets a boyfriend in the movie. Also, there's the introduction of some new Exorcism experts who are part of a group that are brought in to &#34;cure&#34;.Instead the movie plays like your normal junk horror movie of the week. A lot of the scenes are played for laughs, so it's hard to say if the director even took the movie seriously at all, or he thought it was joke. I mean take a look at the end scene alone, and if that doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will!!!The jump scares you can see coming a mile away, and they aren't scary at all.The &#34;possession&#34; scenes are what you come to expect. It's pretty mundane here too, there's no gore, no effects here, other than Ashley shaking herself wildly here.The 1st movie did leave a few things open, so I kind of expected a follow-up. I didn't expect it to be this bad though.This is one of those movies that will be on the &#34;it's so bad it's good list&#34; sad to say.Just disappointing.

1611439,AO17SEHBONZS,B00AIBZKV0,Gregory R. Snyder,"[2, 2]","I saw the first film, and liked it.  But this film was awful.  Do not waste your time.Gone is the campy and enjoyable Mockumentary format.Gone is the funny, entertaining-to-watch ex priest who, at least in my opinion, pretty much made the first film.Gone is the tense ambiguity as to whether Nell's problems are psychological or real (the first film answered this question).What do we have instead? A series of incredibly generic scares and Nell wandering around alone getting spooked.There is a painful pattern in this film, and if you've seen other horror films (bad ones), you will know what I'm talking about.A)  Main protagonist (Nell) is alone, wandering around, investigating something suspicious (noise, phone ringing, etc).B)  Sudden scare occurs, startling her.C)  Another character in the film soon shows up.  Protagonist tries to explain, but the 'scary' event has conveniently passed just in time, making the protagonist seem 'crazy' to the other character.If you are even a casual viewer of the horror genre, then there is likely absolutely nothing in this film that you haven't seen before.  The vast majority of the content is dominated by the above mentioned formula.  Its clich&eacute; and requires no effort, just like how no effort was obviously put into this film.The plot itself was straightforward, simple, and slow moving, leaving little to stimulate you.  People say there is a 'twist', but frankly I do not see how the ending qualifies as such.  Its recycled to say the least, but I can't say more without spoiling it.The acting...is, ok, I guess; but when literally the film has nothing else going for it, even the best acting is not going to save it.  The best performance is probably by the girl playing Nell herself; expect very much the same kind of act from her that you saw in the first film.  She's wide eyed, confused, disoriented, unsure whether or not she's crazy (which is tedious; again the first film answered this), and generally panicky.  Not the most entertaining character to watch, and sadly, she is as best as it gets.To give the film makers some credit, I think they had a tall order.  The first film ended on a pretty intense and unforgiving note.  There just wasn't much writing room to maneuver in a believable sequel to the finale of the previous movie.  Maybe that answers the question though; as entertaining as the first film was, it should have been left solo.Regardless of the reasons, a bad and unoriginal movie is a bad and unoriginal movie.

Part II starts out intriguingly with a thoughtful storyline involving Bell seeking mental treatment and trying to reintegrate into society. This includes a cute little story in which Bell experiences her first crush with a co-worker (Clark). Things start out creepy enough with Bell being stalked, but after awhile the film settles in for one false scare after another. Some of these false scares work, some don&#8217;t, but none of them really help to move forward the story.Fans of the original looking for Bell to bend and mold her body into a variety of shapes like she did in the original will be disappointed. There&#8217;s not much of that going on this time around, though it gives Bell a nice opportunity to turn in a solid dramatic performance that recalls Sissy Spacek in Carrie.As for the promised exorcism, it barely registers this time around, though in a smart move, voodoo now takes the place of Christianity. Like the original, there is yet another twist ending, but it feels completely out of tone with the rest of the film. The Last Exorcism Part II, like the main character, suffers from its own dilemma. In one instance, it tries to bring substance and something more considered to the genre, but too often it sabotages itself to try and be a popcorn flick with some cheap scares.

There was barely enough to carry the first film.  Going into a sequel with almost nothing from the first to help it along, I knew it was going to be a rough ride.  And, I was right.Characters were introduced just to be cannon fodder.  You barely get a feel for who they are and why they are there.  Most, I just didn't care about or even understand why they are involved in the story.  The main character, while better developed, never made a connection.  If you knew the story, you understood her position, but she was so poorly written that I could not develop any feeling for her fate besides mild indifference.The attempt to blend religious influences came off awkward.  It was if whoever was behind the script was guessing, that they did not make an honest attempt to understand why the locals believe in certain protective rituals or traditions.  It reminded me of that line from Jurassic Park, where they were talking about the plants in the lobby.  They said the owner didn't know anything about the plants, but picked them because they were pretty.  That is how I see this film's approach to the religious aspects.  They didn't understand a thing really, they just added them because they looked pretty and catchy.And then, we have the cliche ending with no resolution.  I understand it.  They wrote themselves into a corner with this script.  But, THAT was the best they could do?  THAT was it?  It was the topper on a short, mismatch film of random thoughts and under-developed concepts.Rent?  Sure.  Netflix?  Sure.  Buy?

I was hoping for the same juxtaposition between humor and horror, and instead watched a very oddly paced, sorta disjointed drama.

1611446,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00AIBZKV0,J from NY,"[2, 3]","Though the title is a bit oxymoronic and I was at first convinced, along with everyone else, that this was an unnecessary addition to what was a truly great horror filmThe Last Exorcism. I was wrong.  Ashley Bell is one hell of an actress (no pun intended) and she comes across more than convincingly in this macabre little film, which makes the consequences of Cotton Marcus' fraudulence all that much more poignant.Basically, Nell, the girl who he seemed dead?  at the end of the original film escaped the depraved scene of her upbringing and relocates to a home for troubled youth, where she's kinda normal again.  Except when you're looking directly in her eyes, of course.in classic horror film style, things start to very wrong and it becomes quite clear that Nell has not transcended her inner demon.  After nearly being kicked out of the girl's home because of some significant internal struggles and after her friends (this is a sort of subtextual commentary on what happens when we exploit the ritual of exorcism for entertainment) discover her exorcism on the internet--which is plausible, since it was filmed with a camera--she is being devoured psychically and physically by this unresolved spiritual evil.  She is approached by a voodoo priestess (kind of an odd choice) who brings in two very odd characters (did the director call the man from EVP studies who lives on the fifth floor of an abandoned building for the role of Exorcist technician?) and things don't go so well, without spoiling anything for anybody.My only criticism of the movie is that while I found all this horrifyingly believable, the last three minutes are just corny.  What's it supposed to be--Nell goes GTA?  Other than that, I think this was viscerally terrifying and a great sequel.  Recommended for the horror buff.",4,Excellent.

1611447,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00AIBZKV0,John's Horror Corner,"[4, 7]","Let's start by addressing the obvious&#8230;the &#34;last&#34; exorcism &#34;part 2.&#34;  No.  You know what?  This is just going to upset me. That's enough.Abandoning part 1's director and the found footage, shaky video camera POV for a more traditional approach, part 2 picks up right where The Last Exorcism left off.  The day after Cotton and his cameraman bit the dust at the cult rally during Abalam's &#34;birth&#34;, 17 year old Nell (the possessed farm girl from part 1, Ashley Bell; The Last Exorcism) is found in a neighbor's house under severe psychological shock.Nell is taken to a transitional home (sort of a juvenile halfway house) for troubled girls after being diagnosed as the victim of cult abuse.  Eventually she starts acclimating to a less simple, superstitious, God-fearing world to which she'd never been exposed; a world with boys, jobs, YouTube, catty roommates, alternative music and iPods.During Nell's social rehabilitation she begins to have visions and strange things start happening.  The delusions are a mix of warnings about the demon Abalam and others of some force (presumably Abalam) coming to claim her.  Her caretaker thinks she's unstable, but Nell eventually finds members of some kind of good cult who wish to help by dispatching her demon--resulting in a ritual which is similar to an exorcism.Attempts to set a creepy mood with eerie special effects largely fail.  There is almost no action outside of Nell's vision-induced hysteria and, worse, I never felt any suspense or shock.  This movie wasn't scary, hardly even seeming to try to be scary, nor was it interesting.  The justification of this movie was limited to one repeated notion: that Abalam wouldn't be complete with her.  Yet I never felt nervous/worried about Abalam at any point in the movie.So&#8230;lame plot, ineffective effects, no suspense, and no story-based reason to really make this movie.  On top of that, this felt in no way like a possession/exorcism movie!  It was more like some scared, fragile girl being stalked by an evil force/cult/whatever.  The one upside is that this movie can stand alone for any viewer who missed part 1.A lot of sequels don't need to be made and, really, aren't even wanted by the fans.  In this case, part 1 told a whole story ending with a twist and was presented as a satirical documentary in first person POV narrated by the exorcist star.  Part 2 is traditional third person POV and presented as a traditional (non-satirical) horror film.  This isn't the continuation of a story.  This is a re-imagining of The Last Exorcism that happens to take place after The Last Exorcism with a crappy plot.  Sinister (2012) had its sequel announced before it hit blu-ray release!  Again, I'm baffled at how they plan to continue this story.  Insidious (2010), another movie which told a whole story ending with a twist, was loved by many.  As such, I'm nervous about Insidious 2, but at least that movie ended in such a way that I can clearly see how one could extend the story instead of simply reiterating the previous installment.  Whatever, I end up watching all of them anyway.When a sequel comes out and we say to ourselves &#34;they made a sequel to that?&#34;  That's probably a good indication that you should skip it.  For this movie, that's the case.  Skip it.  Don't wait for RedBox or an HBO premiere, just skip it forever.",2,A completely unwarranted sequel that nobody wanted and did nothing for the storyline.

1611463,A2AK7ZFKW08HID,B00AIBZKV0,movielover,"[0, 1]","The one big negative that I have read from alot of the other reviews is the title. How can you make a sequel to a movie called The Last Exorcist? I want to take a minute to clear this up, The Last Exorcist pertained to the preacher in the movie, it was his last exorcism, and since he did meet his demise at the end it was his last exorcism.This one picks up right where the first left off, with the camera on the ground. Now it doesn't clarify if Nell ( Ashley Bell ) escapes from the cult or if she is set free, but either way she ends up at a couples house in the woods. Nell is then sent to a half way house with no memory of the events that occurred in the first movie. She pretty much is starting her life over from scratch. She gets a job cleaning hotel rooms and starts making friends and is on her way to leading a normal life, when weird things start to happen to her.Now this movie does look better visually than the first one. I am glad they decided to take that a different direction. The one big complaint I had was the lack of the demonic presence. This movie could of been played off as a ghost story rather than a exorcist story. The demonic force only shows up towards the end. When I want to watch a exorcist movie I expect some possession. This movie extremely lacks in that department. The ending was also a bit of a let down and was pretty much ripped off of a Stephen King movie, and if you watch it or have watched it you know exactly what movie I am talking about.So if you are really hard pressed to see this movie a definitely recommend that you rent it first. The scares are really not there, the possession scenes aren't there, the acting isn't all that great, and the story is o.k. but it doesn't bring anything new to the table.",2,"Slightly better than the first, which isn't saying a hell of a lot.",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1759,"['one', 'big', 'negative', 'have', 'read', 'alot', 'other', 'reviews', 'title', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'sequel', 'movie', 'called', 'Last', 'Exorcist', 'want', 'take', 'minute', 'clear', 'up', 'Last', 'Exorcist', 'pertained', 'preacher', 'movie', 'was', 'last', 'exorcism', 'did', 'meet', 'demise', 'end', 'was', 'last', 'exorcism.This', 'one', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'camera', 'ground', 'Now', ""n't"", 'clarify', 'Nell', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'cult', 'set', 'free', 'way', 'up', 'couples', 'house', 'woods', 'Nell', 'then', 'sent', 'half', 'way', 'house', 'memory', 'events', 'occurred', 'first', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'starting', 'life', 'scratch', 'job', 'cleaning', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'making', 'friends', 'way', 'leading', 'normal', 'life', 'when', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'her.Now', 'movie', 'look', 'better', 'visually', 'first', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'decided', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'one', 'big', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'lack', 'demonic', 'presence', 'movie', 'could', 'been', 'played', 'off', 'ghost', 'story', 'rather', 'exorcist', 'story', 'demonic', 'force', 'only', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'When', 'want', 'watch', 'exorcist', 'movie', 'expect', 'possession', 'movie', 'extremely', 'department', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'ripped', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'watch', 'have', 'watched', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'am', 'talking', 'about.So', 'are', 'really', 'hard', 'pressed', 'see', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'rent', 'first', 'scares', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'there', 'possession', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'acting', ""n't"", 'great', 'story', 'o.k', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'table']",N/A

But none of the reviewers, at least so far, have commented on how downright insulting it is to the audience. The title of this movie shows Hollywood's utter disregard for us, and that's without taking into account the quality of the movie itself, which is poor. Even Friday the 13th had enough sense to call the sequel of The Final Chapter ""A New Beginning"". Equally idiotic, but at least they tried.The Last Exorcism Part II is not very well acted, which is par for the course for a horror movie, but what is NOT par for the course is exorcism-themed movies which are not scary. This is very dark subject matter, and a good filmmaker can do a lot with it (as in the original Exorcist). The Last Exorcism Part II instead relies on dim lighting and a bunch of cliched shock reveals (punctuated of course by a scream, gasp, roar or some other variety of overused cacophony). Sure, it will startle you because you aren't expecting it, but there is a big difference between being startled and being scared.The filmmakers seemed to have subscribed to the school of thought that the louder the actors scream, the scarier it is. Or that if a possessed human being is making some feral dog-snarling noises, that's scary too. Except it's not, and hasn't been for 40 years.

I must say that with the new director on the set, this movie looks better than the first.I recall giving Part 1 of this movie a 2/5 star rating back in April 2011. The first director must have misjudged what effects that jerky hand-held camera must have had. I was wondering if he was on a ""Blair Witch Project"" instead of a horror movie on ""exorcism"". I'm sure the screen-writers had taken viewers' critiques of Part 1 into consideration before planning this sequel. Good for them. In Part 2 of the story, I'm relieved to know that the cameras are held steady, steady enough to enjoy a decent movie. The special effects have been cleaned up too, making them more realistic and plausible. This is why I'm giving a thumbs up to this sequel. Much on-screen improvements were done.This movie takes off from the first with the female victim surviving her impending death in Part 1 - good to know that, since Part 1 left viewers with too many unanswered questions and no satisfactory conclusion. The victim is being haunted again in Part 2 and this time, really gets possessed. OK, I've been told that I give too many spoilers away, so I'm not going to reveal anything more at this time.... watch this movie if you've seen Part 1 and are curious about the characters from Part 1. You're either going to like the ending of this movie - or you will not. Audiences can expect yet another continuation of this movie! Wait up for Part III 3 years from now! LOL!""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" must have set the tone for horror movies that come after that. If you notice the years of the later movie releases that come after Emily Rose, you would notice that directors now seem to like casting their female actresses in white dresses and try to outdo one another in yet more back bending special effects!If anyone has seen the superior ""Mama (2013)"" and ""The Possession (2012)"", ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" show glimpses of elements from those 2 other horror masterpieces.If you or anyone you know faces what the victim faces in this modern world, go consult a Traditional Catholic priest who knows more about these things.

That would make the first film ""The Next to the Last Exorcism"" a title that wouldn't sell. Since this is Louisiana, it should be ""Far From the Last Exorcism.""First the disclaimer. I disliked the amateur attempt of the first film with the hand held camera. They dropped the hand held camera and opted for better effects.Nell is at a half way house via a medical ward. She has a day job as a maid and suffers from major ""hallucinations."" It seems in order for the demon to get loose, he must impregnate a somewhat pure vessel and Nell is apparently the last Christian virgin on the planet. The plot was rather mundane for demonic possession films. The acting could have been better, but was par for a sequel. The movie opens with a quick, distorted, ineffective flashback that does nothing to help anyone who hasn't seen it.On the plus side of the film was the scare factor. It was able to effectively use sound, shadow, screams, background noises, and disappear/ reappear to create suspense and tense moments that would make most kids in a dark room go nuts.

1611479,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00AIBZKV0,Tony Heck,"[0, 1]","""He's still out there, Abalam, the demon."" After Nell (Bell) the only survivor of the fire is placed in a home to restart her life she is worried that her past will catch up with her. It's no surprise when it does and the demon begins to not only affect her but those around her, and this time it's more powerful. I have to start by saying I thought the first one was lame, so if you liked it keep that in mind with this review. There are few technical problems I had with this movie to start with. First the title...Last Exorcism 2, either it's the last one or not make up your mind. Second the first one was a fake documentary type and this was filmed like a normal movie, why the change in style? That nitpicking out of the way I feel the same about this one as the first one. Very boring and nothing really happens. She pretty much walks around trying to be normal and everyone reminds her of her past...over and over. So if that's what your looking for have fun. There really is nothing else I can say about this, I did not enjoy it. Overall, if you liked the first one you may like this one too. I didn't. I give it a C-",2,A sequal to the LAST excorcism...let that sink in. If you liked the first one you will like this too...maybe.

This change in direction means that the film becomes another standard exorcism story. The music in the film is a clear 'jump' indicator, becoming predictable and losing a few scares. The film lacks in gore and terror, and seems to lose track of being a horror.However Ashley Bell's (Nell) acting, is able to maintain a level of unnerving tension, presenting the suffocation of Abalam's presence in her life. One scene in particular is comparable to the cult classic The Exorcist, yet the scene is so understated it seems to be included solely for this comparison and not to develop the plotAfter one too many J&auml;gerbombs, Nell's friends unceremoniously left her outside the pub.The ending allows for a possible Part III, not surprisingly as most modern horrors stretch an idea for all its (monies) worth. A genre in which squeals and trilogies has become the rule, not the exception. Part II loses the originality of Part I by opting for a change in filming technique. So this time don't expect so much back breaking yoga: that shock tactic has been done.
