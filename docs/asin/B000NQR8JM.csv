With that said, you'll probably laugh when the first episode is over and wonder what'll come next.  While devoid of a real plot except the last 5 episodes, this anime is pretty good.  It has fanservice thanks to the busty Junko and Desert Punk spends his time trying to woo her....and failing miserably (perhaps they get together by the end of the series?).  This anime is the funniest anime I ever watched, but its crude humor....don't watch if you're easily offended by the humor.Desert Punk is known as the ""demon of the desert"" and is a very skilled bounty hunter and merc that goes around doing jobs while trying to survive the savage heat of the desert.  This is set thousands of years in the future after something wiped out the last civilization.  The people of the desert call our time the ""dark ages"".

It's not in a South Park, over the top style, but more in a sarcastic and witty way.There are some great lines in this series, it is almost better watching the English dub first, that way you can get the humor a little easier than reading the subtitles and processing the jokes.  I did like the letter to the enemy gang leader: ""PS: your mother's a whore.""  He also says about 10 euphemisms for breasts in about 45 seconds in once scene.The main reason I am pre-posting this review before finishing the series is to note that this is the same as the new re-release, only in the collectible metal tin.  Currently this is cheaper than the new version.  I bought mine used like new for $12 with Prime shipping.  Better than the $30 re-release.But whether you buy this set or the Viridian collection, it's a zany, wild anime series with a lot of dirty jokes.  Not quite as over the top in the 'poke fun at other anime series' as School Rumble 2 or Excel Saga; but it does poke a lot of fun at action films and action anime.

1059764,AK019BF9HMELY,B000NQR8JM,"Jay F. Grissom ""JF""","[24, 25]","This is a fun item that needs a low-brow sense of humor to appreciate. I enjoyed it quite a bit but I did think the profanity often didn't serve any purpose.The style of entertainment you get from this is comparable to ""Wild Arms"" or ""Those who hunt elves"". Though neither of those are as lewd as this is.Some dialog is so painfully funny (at least from a guys perspective) that I actually had a tear in my eye from laughter.There is a scene very early in the anime where the anti-hero of the show meets another mercenary who is generously endowed with a triple X sized bra cup. He speaks to her, and in about ten seconds he manages to make a statement that both greets her, and at the same time uses every possible slang synonym for ""large breasts"" in the entire english lexicon. It was quite funny.This anime doesn't take it self too seriously. Which is good because it makes the humor believable.A statement ""remember this from episode one"" is actually said by one of the characters. That the characters are aware they are in an animated series, states definitively that this shouldn't be taken too seriously.Also the large bouncy breast thing is over done but it doesn't seem to get tired the way it did in ""Mizuki Chronicles"" (Which I thought was total crap for many reasons but two come to mind that relate to this anime. Not only did the ""Mizuki Chronicles"" take itself WAY too seriously, almost every single female in the entire show had triple D sized overly bouncy mammaries).Thankfully ""Desert Punk"" only has one set of ridiculously sized breasts to work with and it is enough to be fun yet not insulting to ones intelligence.Is it a work of art? Well... you'll have to judge... I would argue no... worth a laugh? Yes.This really isn't appropriate for kids in my mind. I'll let my son watch it when he turns sixteen.It is good for a laugh and the box set quality is comparable to ""Trinity Blood"", ""Basilisk"", or ""Avenger"". The collectors tin is nice too.Over all it was good, and I liked it, but like ""Trinity Blood"" it is a bit pricey for what you get.",4,Juvenile but fun.,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2064,"['fun', 'item', 'low-brow', 'sense', 'humor', 'appreciate', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'did', 'think', 'profanity', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'purpose.The', 'style', 'entertainment', 'get', 'comparable', 'Wild', 'Arms', 'who', 'hunt', 'elves', 'are', 'as', 'lewd', 'is.Some', 'dialog', 'so', 'painfully', 'funny', 'least', 'guys', 'perspective', 'actually', 'had', 'tear', 'eye', 'laughter.There', 'scene', 'very', 'early', 'anime', 'where', 'anti-hero', 'show', 'mercenary', 'who', 'generously', 'endowed', 'triple', 'X', 'sized', 'bra', 'cup', 'about', 'ten', 'seconds', 'make', 'statement', 'greets', 'same', 'time', 'possible', 'slang', 'synonym', 'large', 'breasts', 'entire', 'english', 'lexicon', 'was', 'quite', 'funny.This', 'anime', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Which', 'good', 'humor', 'believable.A', 'statement', 'remember', 'episode', 'one', 'actually', 'said', 'one', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'aware', 'are', 'animated', 'series', 'definitively', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously.Also', 'large', 'bouncy', 'thing', 'done', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'tired', 'way', 'did', 'Mizuki', 'Chronicles', 'Which', 'thought', 'was', 'total', 'crap', 'many', 'reasons', 'two', 'come', 'mind', 'relate', 'anime', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Mizuki', 'Chronicles', 'take', 'WAY', 'too', 'seriously', 'almost', 'single', 'female', 'entire', 'show', 'had', 'triple', 'D', 'sized', 'overly', 'bouncy', 'mammaries', '.Thankfully', 'Desert', 'Punk', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'ridiculously', 'sized', 'breasts', 'work', 'enough', 'be', 'fun', 'yet', 'not', 'insulting', 'ones', 'intelligence.Is', 'work', 'art', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'judge', 'would', 'argue', 'laugh', 'Yes.This', 'really', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'kids', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'let', 'son', 'watch', 'when', 'sixteen.It', 'good', 'laugh', 'box', 'set', 'quality', 'comparable', 'Trinity', 'Blood', 'Basilisk', 'Avenger', 'collectors', 'tin', 'nice', 'too.Over', 'was', 'good', 'liked', 'Trinity', 'Blood', 'bit', 'pricey', 'what', 'get']",Desert Punk
