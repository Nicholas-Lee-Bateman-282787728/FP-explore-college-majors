1434301,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B004Z74X0M,Acute Observer,"[6, 7]","Murder, She Wrote 4 Movie Collection, 2012 filmThe ""Murder, She Wrote"" TV series was on broadcast TV from 1984 to 1996, a very long run for a series. It benefitted from its original time slot (8 pm Sunday) with stories designed for a wide audience appreciation (dramatic murder mysteries that were not frightening). I used to watch it the first couple of years (it followed an investigative news show), but then a change in the producer or stories led to a lower quality. ""Jessica Fletcher"" was a murder mystery writer who also assisted the local Sheriff of ""Cabot Cove"", a small New England rural town. This was different from the classic Private Investigators who dealt with a grittier environment (Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, etc.).  Was the name ""fletcher"" chosen to recall ""archer""?These movies were made after the series ended. I found them of varying quality. The cast always has a lot of extras, a cost avoided in many TV shows. The fans of Jessica may not care about the story as long as Jessica can demonstrate luck and serendipity in solving the murders that break out when she is in the vicinity. (Would you want her as a guest in your home?) One interesting thing about her character is the lack of a partner to comment on or question the events. But this may be needed for novels rather than movies. Jessica also seems to be more passive than a Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot (little involvement in background investigations). But this series' success is proof of its formula.""South by Southwest"" is the best because of its heritage. The story echoes many famous movies. Parts reminded me of ""Foreign Correspondent"", ""North by Northwest"", ""The Lady Vanishes"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" (the train station ""Hannay""). The ending echoes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"". Jessica's involvement in intrigue as she goes about her business was the start of many Eric Ambler's novels. It begins when Jessica meets a ""Stranger on a Train"". The valuable item sought is a memory chip to encrypt (or decrypt) data for US satellites. A lot happens before the chip is recovered. Note the product placement.""A Story to Die For"" occurs when Jessica works as a Motivational Speaker (people pay money to hear famous people make a speech). One of the speakers is a former KGB official who wrote a book. Another is a double for a popular radio talk show host (with a substance abuse problem). There is another novelist ""Warren Pierce"". One of these is found shot dead, the solution requires finding the motive among people who never met before. Jessica does it.""The Last Free Man"" takes place in 1860 Virginia. Men talk about the possibility of war. A newly married man is shot dead at night! Sarah (Jessica's ancestor) investigates. And so does Jessica in modern times. The murderer is discovered, but politics creates a cover-up. Jessica learns the secret about a man who seems to have been buried in two different graves! A man will revise history because of this new evidence. [Note how this skates over controversial subjects.]""The Celtic Riddle"" was adapted from a novel and is set in Ireland. A man is seen on videotape, his will divided his property in an unusual way. Each heir is given a clue to find a valuable treasure. Only by working together will they be able to locate this hidden treasure. The story involves family secrets. The solution requires solving a riddle from these many clues. [Would this happen outside of a novel?] It is needlessly complex, and requires translating English to Gaelic (only a young woman can do this). The motive arose from family history known to only a few. Everyone wants more than what they have, a classic formula for murder.

The series started in the UK back in mid 1985 and quickly became a success. Weekly mysteries involving Jessica Fletcher solving a murder within the 45 minutes of each episode became a winning formula. Some episodes were shown nationally on ITV, some regionally but the show went on to have reruns on ITV, then BBC1 and BBC2 daytime on a seemingly constant loop for most of 2001 - 2010. Various cable channels including Granada Plus and Alibi have also had endless reruns of this classic. It is currently rerunning on ITV at weekend lunchtimes.Murder She Wrote is harmless fun with no violence, no swearing , no sex, no shouting, just good old fashioned fine acting creating decent whodunnits. When the last episode of the last series was screened in America, ""Death by Demographic"", I assumed that Murder She Wrote had finally ended. Well not quite. Angela Lansbury was to return in four movie-length mysteries from the late 1990s until 2003. To this day I've seen them scheduled on ITV1 and ITV3 countless times. ITV must see the charm and reliability of screening Jessica to fill the daytime hours at the weekend.Each mystery is just short of 90 minutes long and is a treat for any fans of the regular series.- South By Southwest- A Story To Die For- The Last Free Man- The Celtic RiddleI doubt there will be any more made as Ms Lansbury is well into her 80s now.

I was a teenager when this show first aired, and remember dreaming of moving to a place like Cabot Cove (and sometimes still do!).Anyway, I was saddened when this stellar show came to an end after many successful seasons. Then I discovered there were four made-for-TV movies made after the show ended. I managed to catch some of these shows on TV when they were aired, and only lately came to discover that they are available on DVD.These are four full-length movies. In South by Southwest, Jessica gets entangled in espionage while traveling to El Paso by train. In A Story to Die For, Jessica attends a speakers' conference where a former director of the KGB is murdered. The prized manuscript which supposedly contains some classified information is missing. Jessica initially tries to stay out of it, but inevitably finds herself embroiled in the case. A Story to Die For is my favorite in this collection because it is the most philosophical of all four movies, dealing with friendship, trust, loyalty, and is also quite emotional.In The Last Free Man, Jessica travels to a university in Virginia and inevitably becomes involved in a case that takes her back to the past, and where she discovers that one of her relatives back during the time of slavery was a progressive Southerner and an excellent sleuth herself (Lansbury plays a dual role here). The Celtic Riddle is set in Ireland and is another riveting mystery. Jessica has to deal with a killer who is determined not to let anyone get a fortune, one where Jessica herself is a beneficiary. Besides the riveting plot, the bonus is the beautiful cinematography.Ardent fans of Murder, She Wrote should definitely watch these four movies, and those who are familiar with the show will enjoy identifying guest stars from TV's golden years. I highly recommend this 4-movie compilation for fans of the show, and just about anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",5,"Four riveting stories featuring my favorite sleuth, Jessica Fletcher",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2149,"['absolutely', 'adore', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'English', 'teacher', 'turned', 'mystery', 'writer/', 'sleuth', 'have', 'watched', 'seasons', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'am', 'still', 'amazed', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'great', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'was', 'teenager', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'remember', 'dreaming', 'moving', 'place', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'sometimes', 'still', 'do', '.Anyway', 'was', 'saddened', 'when', 'stellar', 'show', 'came', 'end', 'many', 'successful', 'seasons', 'Then', 'discovered', 'were', 'four', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'made', 'show', 'ended', 'managed', 'catch', 'shows', 'TV', 'when', 'were', 'aired', 'only', 'lately', 'came', 'discover', 'are', 'available', 'DVD.These', 'are', 'four', 'full-length', 'movies', 'South', 'Southwest', 'Jessica', 'entangled', 'espionage', 'traveling', 'El', 'Paso', 'train', 'A', 'Story', 'Die', 'Jessica', 'speakers', 'conference', 'where', 'former', 'director', 'KGB', 'murdered', 'prized', 'manuscript', 'supposedly', 'classified', 'information', 'missing', 'Jessica', 'initially', 'stay', 'inevitably', 'embroiled', 'case', 'A', 'Story', 'Die', 'favorite', 'collection', 'most', 'philosophical', 'four', 'movies', 'dealing', 'friendship', 'trust', 'loyalty', 'also', 'quite', 'Last', 'Free', 'Man', 'Jessica', 'university', 'Virginia', 'inevitably', 'becomes', 'involved', 'case', 'back', 'past', 'where', 'one', 'relatives', 'back', 'time', 'slavery', 'was', 'progressive', 'Southerner', 'excellent', 'sleuth', 'Lansbury', 'dual', 'role', 'here', 'Celtic', 'Riddle', 'set', 'Ireland', 'riveting', 'mystery', 'Jessica', 'deal', 'killer', 'who', 'determined', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'get', 'fortune', 'one', 'where', 'Jessica', 'beneficiary', 'riveting', 'plot', 'bonus', 'beautiful', 'cinematography.Ardent', 'fans', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', 'four', 'movies', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'identifying', 'guest', 'stars', 'TV', 'golden', 'years', 'highly', 'recommend', '4-movie', 'compilation', 'fans', 'show', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'mystery']","Murder, She Wrote: 4 Movie Collection"
