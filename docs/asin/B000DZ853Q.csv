963541,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000DZ853Q,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Where the Truth Lies is heavy-handed, bombastic, blatant, overwrought, confusing and florid. It's one of those movies that viewers are going together love or hate - I quite liked it - but director Atom Egoyan's homage to the perils of show business is so misguided and semi-sensationalistic that it plays more like a tension-filled tease than it does a scathing commentary on the rigors of fame and its unpredictable frivolity.Where the Truth Lies is also over-produced to an inch of its life, yet it's often exceedingly watchable even as laughably ridiculous moments start piling up. Part melodramatic potboiler, and part pseudo noir, it's mostly a second rate mystery dressed up with tawdry sex scenes, masquerading as high-gloss trash.The story centers on a madcap comedy team that was once the toast of the 1950s club scene. Zany Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) and the more measured Vince Collins (Colin Firth) were sitting on top of the world, only to watch their world come crashing down after a naked young girl is found dead in their hotel suite.Fifteen years later, in 1972 another luscious blond award winning journalist, Karen (Alison Lohman), is determined to get the inside scoop on what happened that night and who murdered the woman. Her unusual technique is to grill her subjects whilst wearing low-cut tops and accepting recreational drugs from them.Veering between the two time periods, the film is a convoluted maze of double - and triple-crosses, betrayed trusts, lustful secrets and sordid lies. Even if told in a linear fashion, the story would probably still be confusing with Mr. Egoyan's insistence on jumping back and forth between the team's '50s heyday and its '70s seclusion makes things even more chaotic.The flashbacks to the '50s, however, are the most effective because they have an intriguing inside-show-business feel and a nonstop energy fueled by Bacon and Firth's manic impressions of a comedy duo. Bacon has the showier role, and he wrings everything he can out of it, creating a character whose layers of complexities embrace all dimensions of behavior while still maintaining a small semblance of humanity. But Firth is equally impressive, as Vince; he initially seems the more relaxed role, but beneath the character's carefully guarded facade is a volcano of dangerous emotions and when those emotions come to the surface, the effect is harrowing.Riddled with sensationalized sex, drug use, mob ties and grim looks at show-biz hypocrisy, Where the Truth Lies is more concerned with perpetuating naughty shock value and vivid period re-creations than it is an absorbing or convincing crime story. I'm surprised that Atom Egoyan, who is usually known for quietly artful films, would be attracted to material such as this; yes, he is able to propel the story along, and it does indeed have some compelling moments, but all to often, the director slips into overheated, melodramatic ruts for this noisy, hard-boiled entertainment and the film ends up unintentionally stumbling towards parody.

Firth had a little charm, but revealed a sleazy dark side that was indeed shocking.The presence of the TOO YOUNG Alison Lohman as K. O'Connor, an ambitious journalist, was a big turnoff. Her scene with the Alice in Wonderland singer was offensive. I had to fast-forward all of it, to get through the movie. Rachel Blanchard as the murder victim was perfect.

963547,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000DZ853Q,Cubist,"[4, 7]","Since the critically acclaimed but commercial failure of Felicia's Journey, Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan has been keeping a low profile. He returned to the spotlight in 2005 with a vengeance with Where the Truth Lies. It captured headlines when the director refused to tone down racy sex scenes for its American release. The film was seen by some as an attempt for the auteur to capture a larger, more mainstream audience as fellow Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg did with A History of Violence. This may be true but this new movie also continues many of the thematic preoccupations that he has explored in several of his other movies.The film cuts back and forth from the `50s to the 1970s with both Lenny and Karen narrating, which tends to get a little confusing at times. The use of narration is fine but it tends to be non-linear like the editing and this takes one out of the movie at the beginning. There is too much of it and it's all over the place which makes it confusing as we are trying to get a handle on what is going on and who everyone is. But once the film hits its stride, finds its own rhythm and we begin to get familiar with all of the characters, it becomes a very absorbing mystery.We see past Lanny and Vince's slick, show biz faade and are exposed to their darker side. Lanny, the bawdy comedian is into kinky sex and Vince, the straight man, has a violent temper (as evident in the way he deals with a rude heckler). Kevin Bacon seems to be almost channeling Al Pacino from Donnie Brasco during the `70s era scenes as Lanny has become a world-weary, washed up has-been. He has gotten tired of acting like the nice guy he never was. Bacon delivers an excellent, textured performance as he peels back the layers of his character to reveal Lanny's true self while still making us wonder if it is just another act for Karen. And the actor conveys this with his sad eyes and perpetually burnt out look. Bacon has only gotten better with age. He is so underrated because he doesn't go for the showier roles.Thematically, Where the Truth Lies fits in with the rest of Egoyan's body of work. He continues his fascination with exploring mysteries, presenting them like jigsaw puzzles that we and the protagonist must piece together. In Exotica, there was the mystery behind why a traumatized man visits the same stripper at the same club every night. In The Sweet Hereafter, Egoyan explored the real reasons behind a tragic crash that killed a bus full of children. And in Felicia's Journey, he examined the disturbing inner life of a mild-mannered chef. All of these movies, including Where the Truth lies, involve a death (or deaths) at the centre of the mystery that lead the revelation of buried secrets within someone and the ripple effect this creates.Included are a collection of deleted scenes that elaborate on Karen's relationship with her father and little bits that flesh out some of the more ambiguous elements.""The Making of `Where the Truth Lies'"" is a montage of behind-the-scenes footage of principal photography. There is no real insight into the origins of the movie, which is a little disappointing.",4,Egoyan's return to form...,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,3143,"['critically', 'acclaimed', 'commercial', 'failure', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'been', 'keeping', 'low', 'profile', 'returned', 'spotlight', '2005', 'vengeance', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'captured', 'headlines', 'when', 'director', 'refused', 'tone', 'down', 'racy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'American', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'seen', 'attempt', 'auteur', 'capture', 'larger', 'more', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'fellow', 'Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'did', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'new', 'movie', 'also', 'many', 'thematic', 'preoccupations', 'explored', 'several', 'other', 'movies.The', 'film', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', '50s', '1970s', 'Lenny', 'Karen', 'narrating', 'get', 'little', 'confusing', 'times', 'use', 'narration', 'fine', 'be', 'non-linear', 'editing', 'one', 'out', 'movie', 'beginning', 'too', 'much', 'place', 'confusing', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'handle', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'everyone', 'once', 'film', 'stride', 'own', 'rhythm', 'begin', 'get', 'familiar', 'characters', 'very', 'absorbing', 'mystery.We', 'see', 'past', 'Lanny', 'Vince', 'slick', 'show', 'biz', 'faade', 'are', 'exposed', 'darker', 'side', 'Lanny', 'bawdy', 'comedian', 'kinky', 'sex', 'Vince', 'straight', 'man', 'violent', 'temper', 'evident', 'way', 'rude', 'heckler', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'be', 'almost', 'channeling', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', '70s', 'era', 'scenes', 'Lanny', 'become', 'world-weary', 'washed', 'up', 'has-been', 'gotten', 'tired', 'acting', 'nice', 'guy', 'never', 'was', 'Bacon', 'excellent', 'textured', 'performance', 'back', 'layers', 'character', 'reveal', 'Lanny', 'true', 'self', 'still', 'making', 'wonder', 'just', 'act', 'Karen', 'actor', 'conveys', 'sad', 'eyes', 'perpetually', 'burnt', 'out', 'look', 'Bacon', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'age', 'so', 'underrated', ""n't"", 'go', 'showier', 'roles.Thematically', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'rest', 'Egoyan', 'body', 'work', 'fascination', 'exploring', 'mysteries', 'presenting', 'jigsaw', 'puzzles', 'protagonist', 'must', 'piece', 'together', 'Exotica', 'was', 'mystery', 'why', 'traumatized', 'man', 'same', 'stripper', 'same', 'club', 'night', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'Egoyan', 'explored', 'real', 'reasons', 'tragic', 'crash', 'killed', 'bus', 'full', 'children', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'examined', 'disturbing', 'inner', 'life', 'mild-mannered', 'chef', 'movies', 'including', 'Where', 'Truth', 'involve', 'death', 'deaths', 'centre', 'mystery', 'lead', 'revelation', 'buried', 'secrets', 'someone', 'ripple', 'effect', 'creates.Included', 'are', 'collection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'elaborate', 'Karen', 'relationship', 'father', 'little', 'bits', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'elements', 'Making', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'montage', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'principal', 'photography', 'real', 'insight', 'origins', 'movie', 'little', 'disappointing']",N/A

Ostensibly the film is about the mysterious appearance of a dead hotel employee in the bathtub of famed fifties comics Lanny Morris(Bacon) and Vince Collins(Firth).  For sure the mystery surrounding the possible murder of the girl is explored.  The film also wants to delve into the nature of the relationship between Morris and Collins.  Onstage Morris is Peck's Bad Boy to Collins' straight man.  Offstage the relationship is a little more complex.  Both Bacon and Firth are excellent but kudos should also go to Alison Lohman as a writer who is trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the girl's death but also the subsequent breakup of Morris and Collins act.

963551,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000DZ853Q,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","We have come to expect from talented director Atom Egoyan films that linger in the mind, parceling out bits and pieces that continue to fit tightly together making the memory of his film linger and grow in impact.  WHERE THE TRUTH LIES remains in the bits and pieces stage, even while actively watching the film, and one can only suppose that what Egoyan intended was a reconstructed parody of the 1940s/50s film noir, works heavily laden with voluptuous femme fatales in plunging satin gowns and suave and dangerous slick-haired male tropes who just happen to be involved in a murder.  Oddly the film succeeds on some levels while crashing and burning on others.Lanny (Kevin Bacon) and Vince (Colin Firth) are comedy duo who make the 1950s club circuits when they are not staging their annual polio telethon: Lanny is the love-em-and-leave-em ladies man and Vince is the somewhat uptight straight man who has a controlling nature.  The two are involved peripherally with organized crime.  All goes well until a nude female body is discovered in their hotel suite bathtub, both men having airtight alibis which proclaim their innocence (though they have had a m&eacute;nage a trois with the young college reporter victim the night before), but the duo split at that point for some dubious reason and haven't talked since.Jumping 20 years forward we meet an inexperienced reporter Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman)(who just happened to have appeared on their telethon 20 years ago as a recuperated polio victim and has been a devoted fan of the due since) who has been paid to interview Vince about his life story on the proviso that she obtain information as to why the duo split.  Through a series of silly circumstances Karen slowly gains her information and does indeed discover the true murderer and the true reason for the demise of the Lanny/Vince duo - but not without a lot of rangy, edgy sidebars that confuse the story line.Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon are both fine actors and do their best to make the most of this shaky script, but the film is so overly burdened with 'atmosphere', obvious story music, and erratic editing and splicing and piecing that after a while we, the audience simply want the fairly obvious ending to just rush to judgment.  If this is a parody and a tongue-in-cheek farce then Egoyan hasn't mastered that genre.  It would seem that once settled into the story, knowing that it is nothing deep or particularly thrilling as a crime buster, there is enough here to entertain, but it takes a bit a patience with the trappings.

Good murder mystery with a nasty little twist at the end. I also thought the sets were very good as well. Especially the live on stage performance scenes. Now, I have not read the book, and I know this is a work of fiction, but while watching this, I kept thinking that this was maybe based on a duo like Jerry and Dean( don't hate me purests, I said I never read the book).

""A New Yorker""","[13, 16]","While not on the same lengths as Cronenberg's latest foray, A History of Violence, Atom Egoyan pulls off a decent Canadian feature with this film, and heightens it with a great acting talent of Colin Firth and the man who knows everyone and one of my personal favorite actors (and pincushions), Kevin Bacon.While the storyline becomes a little convoluted half-way through, the performances and presentation of the film keep up throughout. The dual narration is annoying at first, but becomes acceptable after a few minutes. The presentation of the 1950s settings, and the 1970s settings were done well. While some of the costumes are off in some areas, in others, they are spot-on. It makes you wonder why Oscar skipped over the film (until you watch it all, and then realize why). Alison Lohman is alright here, but she was much better in Matchstick Men, if for only the fact that she looks to young for her own good (and after the things she does, and has done to her in this film, she looks way too young for her own good). For this reason, she has a really hard time carrying the film, and has an even harder time acting against Firth and Bacon. Rachel Blanchard is sadly underused, as is Firth, but the rest of the supporting cast has just enough time needed to stretch.The film's graphic nude and sex scenes are up to par with Cronenberg, and make an interesting comparison. Were they really attempting to compete, or was it just a subtle irony that both of the films came out over a year ago, and had their first screenings at Cannes?  In the end, the whole thing sadly just looks very little in comparison to Violence, and that's the unfortunate thing because they were just destined to be compared.I know that the NC-17 rating of the film made a big scandal and controversy among fans. While most of the time the rating is all a bunch of bull, quite often movies that lack in the story, acting or budget make up for it in explicit sex scenes (which is what got this film its rating), language or gore, and the plot gets lost somewhere in between all these distractions. I suppose it is all personal taste, and different people love or hate this movie for various reasons. To me, it is a combination of reasons. The only ""REALLY"" good thing about it was the cast, and as much as I like the actors, they were not enough to save it. But, the film is done averagely well, and deserves a look.",3,"This director decided to ""Sell Out"" and hide underneath the rating.",1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,2397,"['not', 'same', 'lengths', 'Cronenberg', 'latest', 'foray', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'decent', 'Canadian', 'feature', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'man', 'who', 'everyone', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'actors', 'pincushions', 'Kevin', 'Bacon.While', 'storyline', 'little', 'convoluted', 'half-way', 'performances', 'presentation', 'film', 'keep', 'dual', 'narration', 'annoying', 'first', 'acceptable', 'few', 'minutes', 'presentation', '1950s', 'settings', '1970s', 'settings', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'costumes', 'are', 'off', 'areas', 'others', 'are', 'spot-on', 'wonder', 'why', 'Oscar', 'skipped', 'film', 'watch', 'then', 'realize', 'why', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'alright', 'here', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'only', 'fact', 'young', 'own', 'good', 'things', 'done', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'own', 'good', 'reason', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'carrying', 'film', 'even', 'harder', 'time', 'acting', 'Firth', 'Bacon', 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'sadly', 'underused', 'Firth', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'needed', 'stretch.The', 'film', 'graphic', 'nude', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'up', 'par', 'Cronenberg', 'make', 'interesting', 'comparison', 'Were', 'really', 'attempting', 'compete', 'was', 'just', 'subtle', 'irony', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'ago', 'had', 'first', 'screenings', 'Cannes', 'end', 'whole', 'thing', 'sadly', 'just', 'very', 'little', 'comparison', 'Violence', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'were', 'just', 'destined', 'be', 'compared.I', 'know', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'scandal', 'controversy', 'fans', 'most', 'time', 'rating', 'bunch', 'bull', 'quite', 'often', 'movies', 'lack', 'story', 'acting', 'budget', 'make', 'up', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'what', 'got', 'film', 'rating', 'language', 'gore', 'plot', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'distractions', 'suppose', 'personal', 'taste', 'different', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'various', 'reasons', 'combination', 'reasons', 'only', 'REALLY', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'cast', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'done', 'averagely', 'well', 'look']",N/A

While his bid for mainstream commercial success may have stiffed at the box office, on DVD the movie may have a new life as people start watching a picture that will reward them for their patience.  Anyone adapting Holmes' novel would first off have been challenged by its timeline, for the two main male characters must age dramatically so you have to hire actors who might clean up enough to look sort of young in the earlier scenes, and not too vain to forgo aging makeup for the present-day scenes.  Bacon and Firth do well, though Firth's aging makeup makes him look totally gross, while Kevin Bacon looks more or less the same except with rooster-red Rod Stewart hair, giving him a strange resemblance to Gary Oldman playing Sid Vicious in SID AND NANCY.  But why on earth hire Alison Lohman to play O'Connor?  (We remember in the book how we never find out O'Connor's first name, just her first initial.  Here that game is sacrificed right away in the service of naturalism.)  O'Connor's supposed to be young, but not that young; she's old enough to have established herself as an up and coming name in ""New Journalism,"" while Alison Lohman still looks like she's being passed around from foster family to foster family in WHITE OLEANDER.  She doesn't seem to have the journalistic savvy O'Connor is said to have had before falling for Lanny Morris, so that when she throws away her objectivity it hardly seems shocking any more, she's just doing what any lovestruck teen might do.If you can't figure out who committed the murder within forty-five minutes into the picture, it's because you, poor thing, have never seen any movies.  Here's what you should do, don't start with this one, try RASHOMON or CITIZEN KANE or WINTER LIGHT, but after those chart topper you might try this one again.  Egoyan's trademark suburban acuity, and his mastery of pathos and atmosphere, have rarely been so exercised.

Fifteen years later, a young journalist (Alison Lohman) wants to interview Collins for a book and begins to probe the mysterious death.Bacon and Firth are both fine actors, but they are wasted in this terrible film.  Alison Lohman is the main character and she's completely wrong for the part of a savvy young writer;  she acts like a high school girl and looks so much like Amy Adams I was distracted and wishing Adams had done the part.  She is timid and childish in all of her scenes and just isn't strong enough to carry the film.  Firth tries to play against his charmer-image as a sleezy pill-popper, but I didn't believe him for a minute; he seems to be sleepwalking through the movie.

Atom Egoyan must have had a good staff of libel lawyers on the set. There wasn't anything to hang their hats on. Which was the main problem for me. I couldn't grab on to the movie. There didn't seem to be anything real to engage me.Kevin Bacon is excellent as one 1/2 of the comedy team that made movies, appeared in night clubs from coast to coast, and held telethons, 36 hours of non stop television to raise money for charitable acts, here a fictitious polio drive. Colin Firth is the 'straight' man, tolerating Kevin's oddness and vulgarity. And the two like eachother a great deal. And after tonight, they separate fprever. Or in the lexicon of the late 50's. 'it's splitsville.'The remaining cast, the mobster, the valet, the atractive 'inside' reporter, Colin Firth himself, the party girls disrobing or getting dressed, the girlfriend of the reporter, just seem to float through the movie.The two TV stars have a closing night of their telethon and then have relations with an attractive hotel employee. In the morning she's dead, and her body is found in a different hotel in New Jersey. So that's the whodunit portion of the movie. Why did the girl (Rachel Blanchard) die? Was she murdered? But but by now you're getting so tired of the characters you want to say, whocares?The movie lacked credibility because of the purposelessness of the characters. But also for the numbing effect of the unbelievability of their conduct. Allison Lohman, the 'journalist,' has been criticized for being miscast. She seems to be a quality actor but she does go from one scene to another without any real passion. She's very atractive but quite wooden.If this were a book on tape, it would be as if the entire movie were spoken all in monotone. That she gets authority over a 1 Million dollar contract for The Real Story is unbelievable, incredible and silly. She's just starting out, she has no body of work and she's probably 23 years old.

963559,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000DZ853Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","There is a problem with ""Where the Truth Lies"" that you might not be able to get past, namely the selling point of the story in Hollywood terms.  This would be that a dead woman is found naked in the bathtub of a suite about to be occupied by the comedy team of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the question is whether it was one, the other, or both that killed her.  The names of the comedy team in this 2005 film noir are Vince Collins (Colin Firth) and Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon), but if you do not see the parallels between Collins & Morris and Martin & Lewis before they are hosting a telethon for polio, then you are simply too young to remember Martin & Lewis.Now, the real hook of this film noir is not that the leads are modeled on Martin & Lewis, but that Collins & Morris both have air tight alibis for the murder.  They spent 39 hours doing their telethon in Miami and as soon as it was over were escorted to the airport, flown to New York City, and driven to Atlantic City where the body was discovered.  The only thing is that the dead girl worked at the hotel in Miami, and had wanted to interview the two stars for her school paper.  The official story smells, and whatever the truth might be it cannot be good.  Soon after the telethon and the discovery of the dead girl, Collins & Morris broke up.  There has to be a connection, although clearly it is under so many layers (for one thing, the naked body in the bathtub is completely submerged with its eyes opened, which not only looks freaky, but think about how something like that could actually happen)..Fifteen years later Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman), another young reporter, has wrangled a book deal for Collins, with the understanding that he will have to talk about Morris and the death of Maureen O'Flaherty (Rachel Blanchard, putting her ""7th Heaven"" days well behind her).  O'Connor has just met Morris on a Pan Am flight (nice use of the way they served meals on flights back then to advance the story) as a one-night-stand.  However, she actually knows them from way back: she was one of the children with polio on the fatal telethon.  These men have always been heroes to her, and we do get to see them during their glory days in flashbacks, but the more she learns the harder it looks like they are going to fall.Director Atomy Egoyn (""The Sweet Hereafter""), who did the screenplay from the novel by Rupert Holmes, does not give you enough clues to figure out whodunit in this somewhat different film noir.  This is a mystery where you are along for the ride, because keeping up with the twists and turns in this one is just going to give you a headache.  How this is different from most film noirs is that the sleuth is not Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe, but a young woman who is in way over her head  Additionally, Karen is doing this not for herself or for the dead Maureen, and she is not doing it for the truth.  She is doing it for Maureen's mother, who has been told her daughter committed suicide and has had to deal with her husband going insane.  All of this underscores that O'Connor is not a professional, let alone a seasoned one, which explains some of her youthful mistakes (as a general rule, reporters do not take drugs with their subjects), but she also has the tenacity to find the truth and the youthful idealism to know what to do when she finds it.",4,A film noir murder mystery involving a Martin & Lewis type comedy team,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,3354,"['problem', 'Where', 'Truth', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'past', 'namely', 'selling', 'point', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'terms', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'woman', 'found', 'naked', 'bathtub', 'suite', 'be', 'occupied', 'comedy', 'team', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'question', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'killed', 'names', 'comedy', 'team', '2005', 'film', 'noir', 'are', 'Vince', 'Collins', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Lanny', 'Morris', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'parallels', 'Collins', 'Morris', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'are', 'hosting', 'telethon', 'polio', 'then', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Martin', 'Lewis.Now', 'real', 'hook', 'film', 'noir', 'not', 'leads', 'are', 'modeled', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'Collins', 'Morris', 'have', 'air', 'tight', 'alibis', 'murder', 'spent', '39', 'hours', 'doing', 'telethon', 'Miami', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'were', 'escorted', 'airport', 'flown', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'driven', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'where', 'body', 'was', 'discovered', 'only', 'thing', 'dead', 'girl', 'worked', 'hotel', 'Miami', 'had', 'wanted', 'interview', 'two', 'stars', 'school', 'paper', 'official', 'story', 'smells', 'whatever', 'truth', 'might', 'be', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'Soon', 'telethon', 'discovery', 'dead', 'girl', 'Collins', 'Morris', 'broke', 'up', 'be', 'connection', 'clearly', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'one', 'thing', 'naked', 'body', 'bathtub', 'completely', 'submerged', 'eyes', 'opened', 'not', 'only', 'freaky', 'think', 'how', 'something', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', '..Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'Karen', ""O'Connor"", 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'young', 'reporter', 'wrangled', 'book', 'deal', 'Collins', 'understanding', 'will', 'have', 'talk', 'Morris', 'death', 'Maureen', ""O'Flaherty"", 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'putting', '7th', 'Heaven', 'days', 'well', ""O'Connor"", 'just', 'met', 'Morris', 'Pan', 'Am', 'flight', 'nice', 'use', 'way', 'served', 'meals', 'flights', 'back', 'then', 'advance', 'story', 'one-night-stand', 'However', 'actually', 'way', 'back', 'was', 'one', 'children', 'polio', 'fatal', 'telethon', 'men', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'heroes', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'glory', 'days', 'flashbacks', 'more', 'harder', 'are', 'going', 'fall.Director', 'Atomy', 'Egoyn', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'who', 'did', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'Rupert', 'Holmes', 'not', 'give', 'enough', 'clues', 'figure', 'out', 'whodunit', 'somewhat', 'different', 'film', 'noir', 'mystery', 'where', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'keeping', 'up', 'twists', 'one', 'just', 'going', 'give', 'headache', 'How', 'different', 'most', 'film', 'noirs', 'sleuth', 'not', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'way', 'head', 'Additionally', 'Karen', 'doing', 'not', 'dead', 'Maureen', 'not', 'doing', 'truth', 'doing', 'Maureen', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'daughter', 'committed', 'suicide', 'had', 'deal', 'husband', 'going', 'insane', ""O'Connor"", 'not', 'professional', 'let', 'alone', 'seasoned', 'one', 'youthful', 'mistakes', 'general', 'rule', 'reporters', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'drugs', 'subjects', 'also', 'tenacity', 'find', 'truth', 'youthful', 'idealism', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'when']",N/A

When I read the book, I wasn't too impressed so I wasn't sure how to approach the film version.

We have a comedy team (a la Martin and Lewis) who are merely pillpopping, narcissitic hedonists, and they are implicated in the mysterious death of a young room service girl whom they seduced.  Along comes a gungho writer who wants to write a book on why they split and just what happened with the girl.  Said writer also happens to be the same young girl appearing on one of their yearly telethons in 1957.  The movie is set in 1972, and writer/director Atom Egoyan (THE SWEET HEREAFTER) uses flashback and narrative to tie the two time periods together.  The acting is a disappointment:  Kevin Bacon as the comic, acerbic Lanny Morris goes from lethargy to almost Rod Steigerish outbursts; Colin Firth gives Vince Collins no energy or soul, and seems merely working; Alison Lohman possesses the naivete of the journalist, but not the maturity needed, particularly in a senseless lesbian liaison with an aspiring singer; David Hayman scores better as Ruben, the loyal ""attendant"" to Morris.

963567,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000DZ853Q,mirasreviews,"[7, 11]","""Where the Truth Lies"" is a neo-noir scripted and directed by Atom Egoyan, based on the novel by Rupert Holmes. Egoyan employs classic noir narrative devices -voiceover narration, flashbacks, and unlikely coincidences- very self-consciously to create a hyper-noir style that seems sometimes to be mocking itself. The truth is that I am not sure if the film's self-satire is deliberate or an accidental consequence of intermingling unnaturally bold colors and noir conventions with some heavy doses of sex and drugs. I am tempted to call this ""kitsch noir"". I don't mean that in a bad way. Not entirely anyway. ""Where the Truth Lies"" is entertaining. But it flaunts style where there should be themes or depth of character...or something.In 1972, an ambitious young journalist, Karen O'Conner (Alison Lohman) interviews retired showman Vince Collins (Colin Firth), who was one half of a popular comedy duo in the 1950s. Karen was stricken with polio as a child. Vince and comic partner Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) worked hard for a polio charity at the time, putting in long hours on Polio Telethons. Karen feels a connection to them, and her publisher is paying big bucks for Vince's cooperation on a book. One incident in Vince and Lanny's career intrigues Karen in particular: A woman was found dead in their hotel suite in New Jersey 15 years ago. Neither man was ever suspected of a crime, but the duo broke up shortly afterwards. When Karen seeks Lanny's cooperation on her book, she finds that he is writing an unflattering tell-all of his own.""Where the Truth Lies"" presents 2 storylines simultaneously: Alison's investigation into the events surrounding the woman's death and the events themselves as recounted by Lanny. There are not one, but two, voiceover narrations: Alison's and Lanny's, which give us conflicting accounts. Lanny and Vince are portrayed by 2 superb actors, and there are hints at emotional depth in these characters. Unfortunately, we are not given enough time with these men to catch more than hints. Alison's speech is breathy, child-like, and often accompanied by a melodramatic score. She seems shallow but oddly sentimental. And she looks like a flame-haired dangerous dame from the cover of a hard-boiled novel circa 1930. What am I to make of her? Making this a period film set in the 1950s and 1970s instead of updating it to the present seems strangely awry. Again, ""Where the Truth Lies"" is an entertaining film, although without much payoff. But it is foremost an inscrutable exercise in style.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): There are 8 short deleted scenes (8 min) and one longer deleted sequence (2  min). ""The Making of Where the Truth Lies"" (5  min) is behind-the-scenes footage with no narration. Subtitles are available for the film in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.",3,"Neo-Noir That's Low on Substance, Heavy on Style -Not to Mention Sex & Drugs.",1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,2832,"['Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'neo-noir', 'scripted', 'directed', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'based', 'novel', 'Rupert', 'Holmes', 'Egoyan', 'classic', 'noir', 'narrative', 'devices', 'narration', 'flashbacks', 'unlikely', 'coincidences-', 'very', 'self-consciously', 'create', 'hyper-noir', 'style', 'sometimes', 'be', 'mocking', 'truth', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'self-satire', 'deliberate', 'accidental', 'consequence', 'intermingling', 'unnaturally', 'bold', 'colors', 'noir', 'conventions', 'heavy', 'doses', 'sex', 'drugs', 'am', 'tempted', 'call', 'kitsch', 'noir', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way', 'Not', 'entirely', 'anyway', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'entertaining', 'style', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'themes', 'depth', 'character', 'something.In', '1972', 'ambitious', 'young', 'journalist', 'Karen', ""O'Conner"", 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'interviews', 'retired', 'showman', 'Vince', 'Collins', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'half', 'popular', 'comedy', 'duo', '1950s', 'Karen', 'was', 'stricken', 'polio', 'child', 'Vince', 'comic', 'partner', 'Lanny', 'Morris', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'worked', 'hard', 'polio', 'charity', 'time', 'putting', 'long', 'hours', 'Polio', 'Telethons', 'Karen', 'connection', 'publisher', 'paying', 'big', 'bucks', 'Vince', 'cooperation', 'book', 'One', 'incident', 'Vince', 'Lanny', 'career', 'intrigues', 'Karen', 'particular', 'woman', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'hotel', 'suite', 'New', 'Jersey', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'man', 'was', 'ever', 'suspected', 'crime', 'duo', 'broke', 'up', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'When', 'Karen', 'Lanny', 'cooperation', 'book', 'writing', 'unflattering', 'tell-all', 'own', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', '2', 'storylines', 'simultaneously', 'Alison', 'investigation', 'events', 'surrounding', 'woman', 'death', 'events', 'recounted', 'Lanny', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'voiceover', 'narrations', 'Alison', 'Lanny', 'give', 'conflicting', 'accounts', 'Lanny', 'Vince', 'are', 'portrayed', '2', 'superb', 'actors', 'are', 'hints', 'emotional', 'depth', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'men', 'catch', 'more', 'hints', 'Alison', 'speech', 'breathy', 'child-like', 'often', 'accompanied', 'melodramatic', 'score', 'shallow', 'oddly', 'sentimental', 'flame-haired', 'dangerous', 'dame', 'cover', 'hard-boiled', 'novel', 'circa', '1930', 'What', 'am', 'make', 'Making', 'period', 'film', 'set', '1950s', '1970s', 'instead', 'updating', 'present', 'strangely', 'awry', 'Again', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'entertaining', 'film', 'much', 'payoff', 'foremost', 'inscrutable', 'exercise', 'style.The', 'DVD', 'Sony', 'Pictures', '2006', 'are', '8', 'short', 'deleted', 'scenes', '8', 'min', 'one', 'longer', 'deleted', 'sequence', '2', 'min', 'Making', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', '5', 'min', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'narration', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'film', 'English', 'French', 'Dubbing', 'available', 'French']",N/A

Since seeing it, I find my mind drifting back to it with some consistency; empirically speaking, I know it affected me on some levels that I'm only dimly aware of.  I thought Kevin Bacon's take on a character meant to remind us of the older Jerry Lewis was rich and daring; Colin Firth made an indelible impression as his straight man, the repressed but debonair Brit standing in for Dean Martin's suave Italian-American.  Alison Lohman seems not quite up to her key role, and I found myself wondering if Egoyan might have had someone more cerebral like Sarah Polley (he cast her so perfectly in The Sweet Hereafter) in mind instead.

963569,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000DZ853Q,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","Who should you believe about ""Where the Truth Lies""? Those who hated it because it was yet another strange Atom Egoyan film, those who hated it because it wasn't as strange as other Atom Egoyan films, or those who liked it because it actually is Egoyan's strangest film?A fourth group are those who hated it because the adaptation didn't do justice to Rupert Holmes' 2003 source novel, which was not just affecting but extremely funny. The thing to understand is that none of Egoyan's mainstream films (""Exotica"", ""The Sweet Hereafter"", and now ""Where the Truth Lies"") contain much in the way of humor. That is because Egoyan's interest is allegorical exploration of our internal misery; a topic that just doesn't go very well with humor, despite the fine line between comedy and tragedy. So he stripped the novel's funny stuff out during the adaptation process.As John Ford and Robert Altman kept a regular ensembles of actors, Egoyan keeps an ensemble of themes that permeate his films. So in all three films there is a ""substitution"" theme, a ""free will vs destiny"" theme, a ""looking forward""  theme (parent's who have lost their children), and a ""things and people are not what they appear"" theme.In this regard ""Where the Truth Lies"" is a bit more like ""The Sweet Hereafter"" than ""Exotica"". In both the substitution theme is symbolically shown by the physical similarity between the three young actresses. Alison Lohman (Karen), Rachel Blanchard (Maureen), and Kristen Adams (Alice) take the place of Sarah Polley (Nichole), Caerthan Banks (Zoe), and Stephanie Morgenstern (Allison).All three films also use a non-linear storytelling technique with frequent flashbacks. Egoyan likes to elliptically uncover the story and all three films circle around slowly peeling off layers of their stories.For its film noir background story ""Where the Truth Lies"" flashes back to a 1950s Martin and Lewis comedy team. Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) and Vince Collins (Colin Firth) are a popular song-dance-unfunny repartee duo, hosting telethons, headlining nightclubs, and maintaining an image as doers of good deeds. But behind the faade they are engaging in nonstop Lindsay Lohen style antics.The current story (set 20 years later) is about a young journalist named Karen (Lohman) who is working with Vince on his tell-all autobiography. She becomes focused on a murder mystery involving the duo and a  college student named Maureen. The film is told from Karen's point of view and the viewer learns background details at the same time they are disclosed to Karen. We also learn that Karen has a past association with the duo, a good deed that changed her life and forever made them her heroes. After the death of her father they have become her substitutes for him.Bacon and Firth are excellent in the contemporary scenes but a bit weak in the flashback stuff. This could very well be Egoyan's uncertain direction or his screenplay.Lohman, whose specialty is playing characters 10 years her junior (affectless teenagers in ""Matchstick Men"" and ""White Oleander"" - an overwrought teenager in ""Flicka"") gets to do something different and act her age. Karen is the allegorical element, the character undergoing change, and the narrator. Most of this must be conveyed nonverbally because on the surface she continues to maintain the illusion of the distanced journalist. I think it is an amazing performance although Egoyen's stamp is so strongly on it that he has to get some of the credit, or the blame from those who do not grasp why he wanted the character to look and to be played in this way.Egoyan had an unusually large budget for this film and he put it to good use on the production design. The sets and costumes provide all the right visual cues to keep you oriented as you move between the 50's and the 70's. But some of this stuff, such as an expensive looking recreation of the Newark airport, seem inserted as window dressing rather than for substantive reasons.There are two great surreal ""Alice and Wonderland"" sequences, one of which even incorporates the ""White Rabbit"" song. Karen's emotional journey has a lot of Alice parallels, at least the more unpleasant aspects of Wonderland.The film reminded me a lot of ""The Swimmer"" although the ending is not quite that devastating.Then again, what do I know?

A young woman is assigned to the now debunk duo to write an autobiography on one of their lives. In the process she is determined to get to the heart of the matter and find out exactly what happened to the dead woman so many years before. WTTL is an interesting enough mystery, and the ending did leave me feeling that nothing was overlooked. Nothing silly came out of left field and the clues are presented to the audience within the story. Firth and Bacon are, as always, exceptional aactors. Alison Lohman, however, just didn't do it for me. She is certainly a stunning actress, but I don't believe she quite embodied the tenacity that a journalist of her caliber called for. When she says to Colin Firth: ""Give me the truth... on the record..."" in her most threatening baby doll voice it was all I could do to keep from laughing.

There's a lot to like--some great performances, especially that of Kevin Bacon---some interesting flashbacks to the good old/bad old days of gang owned night clubs in the 50's when the law looked the other way, more often than not.  The story is interesting and holds your attention. There's a lot of sex thrown in, male/female, female/female, threesomes, male/male...something for everyone.It's smart as all of his films are. It is a who dunnit and there are all the necessary details you have to follow--the name change, the complicated negotiations with the publishers, the location of the manuscripts, etc. that I found a little confusing at times.  I would have preferred more of a character study of the show biz couple.  It's an interesting story and the human side of it was far more compelling than the picky details of who mailed the manuscript or moved the note stuff.It was definitely entertaining but I had the feeling that Egoyan bit off more than he could really master.  The sex scenes, for example, seemed a little gratuitous and one has to wonder why he chooses blonds for all his heroines---sort of like Hitchock's pale heroines except these show a lot more skin.Maybe if he had decided to do a traditional Hollywood type film noir he could have stuck with the slick cold-bloodedness.  But he threw in some sentimental stuff with the mother of the murdered girl fondling the tree that grew out of where her ashes were scattered, that just didn't fit with the tone of the rest of the film.  There were a few moments of what seemed like genuine feeling between the Bacon and the Lohman characters but they were eclipsed by all the sensational stuff.  I think  Egoyan was enamored of a lot of the glamor of the subject matter, as well as the pale female bodies and sort of indulged in it.

963574,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B000DZ853Q,Reviews No More,"[11, 20]","Would someone care to explain why Rupert Holmes has subjected this movie featuring two great actors and not much else beside upon us?  I'm more upset than anything over Colin Firth playing a scumbag in this role than I am Kevin Bacon who I never looked at the same after Sleepers.  At least Firth was charming, funny, and sexy as a rogue in Valmont.  In this movie NOBODY is attractive or sympathetic.I guess we were supposed to get the point that our showbiz heroes are often the lowest forms of decrepit life on the planet, but the extent this point is carried to is both excessive and nauseating.  Sometimes we'd rather not know how bad the lives our icons lead are, and we definitely find out more about this Martin and Lewis knockoff than we care to.  Full of sleaze, excess, and decadence to a nearly beyond-R rating, this is not a movie for anyone who likes Colin Firth in far classier and better acted roles.The true turnoff?  That teenage baby-faced Allison Lohman, who is completely unbelievable in every sex scene, especially the one with the Alice in Wonderland singer.  In fact, this girl has the acting scope of an 8th grader in a spring pageant, and it makes you feel uncomfortable--like you're witnessing a child molestation.The story isn't any good anyway, because the girl who was murdered was a nasty little, unsympathetic bee-otch, and her mother is unsympathetic as well, because you can't tell me any parent is that clueless about their child's darker side.

963575,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000DZ853Q,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","Atom Egoyan is a filmmaker who delights in construction narratives that are puzzles.  I haven't seen all his films, but in the devastating THE SWEET HEREAFTER and the powerful EXOTICA, Egoyan (who directs and writes) twists time and perspective in such a way that you genuinely don't always know when something is taking place in the greater scheme of things.  In THE SWEET HEREAFTER, Ian Holm's character has a series of scenes that the viewer thinks are taking place at the end of the narrative, but when it's revealed that they belong at the beginning...well, let's just say the heart stops for a moment.  His movies are twisty and frustrating...but when they are over, you understand that somehow that slippery treatment of time elevates the film and makes it resonate.In WHERE THE TRUTH LIES, Egoyan actually tells a fairly straightforward murder-mystery.  There is some jumping in time, but it's easy to keep track of.  The film jumps from the early `70s, back to the `50s and forward again with regularity, but it's easy to tell the difference.  The story delves into the fateful night when a world-famous comedy team (Kevin Bacon & Colin Firth) ""entertained"" a young woman in their room...and soon thereafter the woman was discovered dead.  The two men's careers were forever tainted.  Fifteen years later, a young report (Alison Lohman) is writing a book about Firth and trying to find out what happened to the young lady.Bacon & Firth are clearly meant to be a bit like Martin & Lewis, with a rat-pack, hanging out with mob figures vibe.  (But they are NOT close enough to them for anyone to take offense.)  Firth is the debonair Brit and Bacon the wacky American.  Their audience loves them.  Behind the scenes, they are sex crazed drug abusers, and behave in totally loathsome ways.  But they don't seem like murderers.  Yet one (or both of them) almost certainly is.Lohman gets to know both men, both professionally and sexually...and we also discover that her quest for the truth has a personal side to it as well.  The movie takes a few twists, but it also takes a few shortcuts, including the convenient discovery of a ""not to be opened until my death"" kind of document that sheds a lot of light.  This sort of clumsy development seems to show that Egoyan really simply wants to use the trappings of an almost noir-ish whodunit to explore other territory.  In THE SWEET HEREAFTER and EXOTICA, we feel as though we've really learned to understand something about deep grief & guilt and how it can burrow into the heart.  There is no such resonance with WHERE THE TRUTH LIES.  It feels like a pretentious murder mystery...but the mystery remains central.  And I don't think that's what Egoyan wanted.  In the end, he would have been better off going with the genre and making a stylish mystery with some fun twists.The casting is a little suspect.  Bacon wouldn't have been my first choice to play wacky, `50s era nightclub comic/singer...but he acquits himself well. He's a sly actor, always pulling off more than you think he should be able to.  Colin Firth is normally such a delight, but here he comes off a bit stiff and removed.  One might suppose that it's supposed to be the affect of the guilt and other secrets he's been carrying...but it comes across as mild disinterest.  He also appears quite uncomfortable during the sex scenes.  As for the usually plucky and fun Alison Lohman (so good in MATCHSTICK MEN or DRAG ME TO HELL)...she's lost as the narrator and moral center of the film.  The script would seem to make her seem much more devious and self-serving, yet her acting suggests she's just a bit empty-headed and easy to manipulate.  It just doesn't work.  I think a strong female lead MIGHT have given this film the kick in the pants it needed to make it something special.  Perhaps a stronger foil for Firth would have energized him.  Her role doesn't call for sweet & plucky...it calls for shrewd and sexy.All that said, I still watched the film with enough interest to keep me going.  Certainly the set and costume design is impeccable, with many great period details.  But ultimately, it's a lesser effort from Egoyan, neither satisfying for his fans nor satisfying for fans of intelligent murder mysteries.",3,"A near miss, but a miss nonetheless from the very interesting Atom Egoyan",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,4245,"['Atom', 'Egoyan', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'construction', 'narratives', 'are', 'puzzles', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'devastating', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'powerful', 'EXOTICA', 'Egoyan', 'who', 'twists', 'time', 'perspective', 'such', 'way', 'genuinely', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'when', 'something', 'taking', 'place', 'greater', 'scheme', 'things', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'character', 'series', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'thinks', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'end', 'narrative', 'when', 'revealed', 'belong', 'beginning', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'heart', 'moment', 'movies', 'are', 'twisty', 'frustrating', 'when', 'are', 'understand', 'somehow', 'slippery', 'treatment', 'time', 'film', 'resonate.In', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'TRUTH', 'LIES', 'Egoyan', 'actually', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'murder-mystery', 'jumping', 'time', 'easy', 'keep', 'track', 'film', 'jumps', 'early', '70s', 'back', '50s', 'forward', 'again', 'regularity', 'easy', 'tell', 'difference', 'story', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'world-famous', 'comedy', 'team', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'entertained', 'young', 'woman', 'room', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'woman', 'was', 'discovered', 'dead', 'two', 'men', 'careers', 'were', 'forever', 'tainted', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'young', 'report', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'writing', 'book', 'Firth', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'lady.Bacon', 'Firth', 'are', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'bit', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'rat-pack', 'hanging', 'out', 'mob', 'figures', 'vibe', 'are', 'NOT', 'close', 'enough', 'anyone', 'take', 'offense', 'Firth', 'debonair', 'Brit', 'Bacon', 'wacky', 'American', 'audience', 'scenes', 'are', 'sex', 'crazed', 'drug', 'abusers', 'behave', 'totally', 'loathsome', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'murderers', 'one', 'almost', 'certainly', 'is.Lohman', 'know', 'men', 'professionally', 'sexually', 'also', 'discover', 'quest', 'truth', 'personal', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'few', 'twists', 'also', 'few', 'shortcuts', 'including', 'convenient', 'discovery', 'not', 'be', 'opened', 'death', 'kind', 'document', 'lot', 'light', 'sort', 'clumsy', 'development', 'show', 'Egoyan', 'really', 'simply', 'use', 'trappings', 'almost', 'noir-ish', 'whodunit', 'explore', 'other', 'territory', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'EXOTICA', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'really', 'learned', 'understand', 'something', 'deep', 'grief', 'guilt', 'how', 'can', 'burrow', 'heart', 'such', 'resonance', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'TRUTH', 'LIES', 'pretentious', 'murder', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'central', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'Egoyan', 'wanted', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'going', 'genre', 'making', 'stylish', 'mystery', 'fun', 'twists.The', 'casting', 'little', 'suspect', 'Bacon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'first', 'choice', 'play', 'wacky', '50s', 'era', 'nightclub', 'comic/singer', 'well', 'sly', 'actor', 'always', 'pulling', 'off', 'more', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'normally', 'such', 'delight', 'here', 'off', 'bit', 'stiff', 'removed', 'One', 'might', 'suppose', 'supposed', 'be', 'affect', 'guilt', 'other', 'secrets', 'been', 'carrying', 'mild', 'disinterest', 'also', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'sex', 'scenes', 'usually', 'plucky', 'fun', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'so', 'good', 'MATCHSTICK', 'MEN', 'DRAG', 'ME', 'TO', 'HELL', 'lost', 'narrator', 'moral', 'center', 'film', 'script', 'would', 'seem', 'make', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'devious', 'self-serving', 'yet', 'acting', 'just', 'bit', 'empty-headed', 'easy', 'manipulate', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'think', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'MIGHT', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'kick', 'pants', 'needed', 'make', 'something', 'special', 'Perhaps', 'stronger', 'foil', 'Firth', 'would', 'have', 'energized', 'role', ""n't"", 'call', 'sweet', 'plucky', 'shrewd', 'sexy.All', 'said', 'still', 'watched', 'film', 'enough', 'interest', 'keep', 'going', 'Certainly', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'impeccable', 'many', 'great', 'period', 'details', 'ultimately', 'lesser', 'effort', 'Egoyan', 'neither', 'satisfying', 'fans', 'satisfying', 'fans', 'intelligent', 'murder', 'mysteries']",N/A

There are mysteries piled upon mysteries that are compounded by doubling of identities, left and right, and a jumping back and forth in time that requires close attention as the full story of what really happened - and the reality behind appearances - is finally revealed. As in just about any mystery, there are two narratives: the story of the crime itself and the story of how it is solved. Writer and director Egoyan makes both of them compelling.The film is also fascinating for its recreation of 1950s America, with its veneer of sunny innocence and the long shadow that it casts in the form of what's hidden from the public eye - the darker, secret lives of adored entertainers and the specter of organized crime that haunts their world, underscored by Bacon's young Sinatra-like impression of a gangly Vegas-style pop star. Though the present-time of the film is circa 1970, the music score is richly evocative of a Douglas Sirk film, a perfect accompaniment for the passage from innocence to experience by the Hollywood-glamorous young writer, played by Alison Lohman, whose self-serving but earnest sleuthing uncovers the mystery.The DVD has no commentary by the director (which would have been a real plus), but there are some deleted scenes and a brief montage of footage shot during the production of the film.

Partly it's the plot -- so much is unbelievable, from Collins' reason for blackmailing O'Connor, to O'Connor's ability to solve the entire mystery after 15 years on the basis of a couple of casual words from Morris.  But mostly it's the fact that none of the main characters is remotely convincing or engaging.  Lohman is entirely out of her depth, and though Bacon and Firth are competent they're uninspiring.

963578,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000DZ853Q,Sarah Bellum,"[5, 7]","This is a fairly complex mystery, wherein a young, pretty journalist (Alison Lohman) attempts to unravel the truth behind a fifteen-year old murder of a young woman while she gathers research for a biography she is writing. Much of the film is told in flashbacks, alternating between the present (1972) and the time of the murder (1957). The journalist, Karen, is obsessed with solving this crime because her life was changed in 1957 upon meeting the two men intrinsically linked to the murder, Vince and Lanny. At the time, she was ten years old and recovering from polio, a disease for which Vince and Lanny had been hosting a fund-raising telethon. The two men, played by Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon, are a fictitious comedy duo not unlike Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. They have never been charged with the crime because there isn't any concrete evidence against them. Karen knows that, unless she cracks the mystery herself, the murder will remain unsolved because it occurred at a time when justice still had 20/20 vision. As I watched the film, I could not extricate it from its novelist, Rupert Holmes, and kept drifting back to ""The Pi&ntilde;a Colada Song"" and ""Him."" To me, the film eventually became the story behind a whimsical Holmes song and, consequently, much less intense. Or perhaps, without the distraction of this song filter, the film really isn't very dramatic, which would be a shame because a murder mystery really should be dramatic and suspenseful. Nonetheless, this film is worth watching because it is at least entertaining throughout and because Alison Lohman is so darn cute; as the saying goes, I would watch her read a phone book and she is worth at least an extra  star here. Kristin Adams and Sonja Bennett provide some added attractions as well. This movie is slightly above average and I recommend it, at least to liberally-minded adults. It is rife with sex, nudity, language and violence, which will likely offend the more conservative viewers.

963580,A342EHO42V2G38,B000DZ853Q,"Terran ""Terran""","[6, 8]","Actually a really good movie, but trying hard to mimic Hitchcock and failing.  The reason for the failure is flipping back and forth between time periods and POVs as well as trying to have too many elements in one viewing; which was never a Hitchcock failing.  You have to watch this one more than once, then even watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, to get the full story, and there's a couple of elements I still find confusing or contradictory and gave up.  The problem is trying to tell too much story, the basic devise of using a period film setting (circa 1970) to have a young journalist investigate the partnership of a famous comedy duo of the 50s and why they broke up, or rather what happened the week before they broke up, which happens to be the same week she met the duo as a child when she was a guest on their annual telethon (you see where this is going?  but don't think too much of martin and lewis but rather how much the screenplay is already working real hard to establish relevance).  The night before said journalist (as a child) met the entertainment stars a young woman died, and this woman was later found in the stars' hotel suite.  No blame accorded; ruled a suicide.  All the journalistic Ws (who, what, when, where, why) basically swept under the rug.  Stylish though the presentation of all this is, the fact is the story of the duo itself is the real film, their relationship and career, and even the butler-assistant who works for one of them.  The dead girl, and the journalist, so much time is spent on them when they're not what holds the film together.  It's really about what happened to that team, and you'd like to see their rise to stardom: more about the ins and outs of the business, especially during a time when entertainers performed in clubs, and those clubs were controlled by mob bosses;, the rise of narcotic use and the acceptance and encouragement of alcohol abuse (peculiar to the 50s).  All of that is what's really interesting, and glimpsed, but unfortunately, the format and the pacing don't leave us much time to enjoy duo's background and the performances of tried-and-true Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth, both of whom age convincingly (about 15 years) but unfortunately they don't bring off the stage appeal and comedy talent/timing required though they try hard.  In fact, they try so hard the internal sweat is visible.  But the screenplay doesn't live up to the duo's legend, let's say.  In sum, a couple of sexy scenes, one for the lesbian lovers, another for providing the hint of a reason why the comedic duo remained unmarried yet broke up, despite all the skirt-chasing.  And the dead girl?  One of their shared beauties; a stunning actress who manages to steal the film in her scenes.",4,Tried and True,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2750,"['Actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'trying', 'hard', 'mimic', 'Hitchcock', 'failing', 'reason', 'failure', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'periods', 'POVs', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'one', 'viewing', 'was', 'never', 'Hitchcock', 'failing', 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'once', 'then', 'even', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'couple', 'elements', 'still', 'find', 'confusing', 'contradictory', 'gave', 'up', 'problem', 'trying', 'tell', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'basic', 'devise', 'using', 'period', 'film', 'setting', 'circa', '1970', 'have', 'young', 'journalist', 'investigate', 'partnership', 'famous', 'comedy', 'duo', '50s', 'why', 'broke', 'up', 'rather', 'what', 'happened', 'week', 'broke', 'up', 'be', 'same', 'week', 'met', 'duo', 'child', 'when', 'was', 'guest', 'annual', 'telethon', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'martin', 'lewis', 'rather', 'how', 'much', 'screenplay', 'already', 'working', 'real', 'hard', 'establish', 'relevance', 'night', 'said', 'journalist', 'child', 'met', 'entertainment', 'young', 'woman', 'died', 'woman', 'was', 'later', 'found', 'stars', 'hotel', 'suite', 'blame', 'accorded', 'ruled', 'suicide', 'journalistic', 'Ws', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'basically', 'swept', 'rug', 'Stylish', 'presentation', 'fact', 'story', 'duo', 'real', 'film', 'relationship', 'career', 'even', 'butler-assistant', 'who', 'one', 'dead', 'girl', 'journalist', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'what', 'film', 'together', 'really', 'what', 'happened', 'team', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'rise', 'stardom', 'more', 'ins', 'outs', 'business', 'especially', 'time', 'when', 'entertainers', 'performed', 'clubs', 'clubs', 'were', 'controlled', 'mob', 'bosses', 'rise', 'narcotic', 'use', 'acceptance', 'encouragement', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'peculiar', '50s', 'what', 'really', 'interesting', 'glimpsed', 'unfortunately', 'format', 'pacing', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'time', 'enjoy', 'duo', 'background', 'performances', 'tried-and-true', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'whom', 'age', 'convincingly', '15', 'years', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'off', 'stage', 'appeal', 'comedy', 'talent/timing', 'required', 'try', 'hard', 'fact', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'internal', 'sweat', 'visible', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'duo', 'legend', 'let', 'say', 'sum', 'couple', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'one', 'lesbian', 'lovers', 'providing', 'hint', 'reason', 'why', 'comedic', 'duo', 'remained', 'unmarried', 'yet', 'broke', 'up', 'skirt-chasing', 'dead', 'girl', 'One', 'shared', 'beauties', 'stunning', 'actress', 'who', 'steal', 'film', 'scenes']",N/A

Though the two were never charged, the death was the downfall of their careers. The murderer was never caught.The film has the usual Egoyan look, and a lot of the dialogue would crackle if the actors seemed to be behind the material.

963582,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000DZ853Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 12]","1957. Vince Collins (Colin Firth) and Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon), one of the most successful comedy teams in America (think Martin and Lewis) have just finished their annual Polio telethon in Miami, Florida. They quickly rush to New York, to appear at the opening of a gangster's new hotel. Upon entering their suite, they find a dead girl in the bathtub. On that fateful night, the team broke up and has moved their separate ways in their careers. Fifteen years later, Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman, ""Matchstick Men"", ""White Oleander"", ""Big Fish"") has been hired by a publisher to ghost write Vince Collin's autobiography. The celebrity is offered $1 million dollars to tell his story, which he takes, because he needs the money. As Karen starts to interview Vince, she receives portions of Lanny Morris' autobiography and realizes there is more to the truth than either man is letting on.""Where the Truth Lies"", written and directed by Atom Egoyan (""Felicia's Journey"", ""The Sweet Hereafter"") is a very well-made film, involving the viewer in the mystery, creating viable drama, portraying interesting characters, and recreating an interesting era in our history.Collins and Morris are clearly patterned after Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Martin and Lewis were at the height of their fame in the mid-50s, they appeared in many nightclubs, lived lavish lifestyles, worked on television, made films, broke up and each went their separate ways. I would find it hard to believe they broke up for the same reason as the two fictional characters in the film, but I guess it is a possibility.Collins and Morris have built an act around their friendship, adlibbing in front of inebriated men and women out to enjoy an evening of martinis and rare steak. They tell a few jokes, some at each other's expense, sing a few lines if the mood strikes and then tell a few more jokes. There show is very loose, very unstructured, very ""Rat Pack"".Both Firth and Bacon do a great job making these two characters `characters' with complicated ideas, feelings, history. They love each other like brothers, sticking up for each other. In one scene, Collins takes great offense when a nightclub patron slings a racial epitaph at his partner. He convinces the patron to walk away from his table, and his girlfriend. As soon as they are out of ear shot, Collins savagely beats the man, and then returns to the act, where Morris notices a spot of blood and realizes what happened. Morris surreptitiously wipes away the blood and the banter continues.As Karen begins to realize the two stories don't match, Egoyan takes us on the journey with her. When she realizes something, we flash back to that moment. Sometimes, we watch a scene unfold, to only find out later that it didn't exactly happen in that way. This is an effective way of letting us in on Karen's journey. We discover things as she discovers them, learning with her. She reads sections of Lanny's autobiography, as Bacon's voice provides the voice over, we watch them enter the hotel suite in New York. As she talks to Vince, we see another version of what happened. As she works through the two stories, we get occasional brief glimpses of what really happened. Because we watch individual scenes, skipping back and forth between the two decades, we become a part of the story.Along the way, these two characters introduce us to a host of other people, all unique and interesting. In Miami, they meet Maureen (Rachel Blanchard), a beautiful young college student working in room service. Lanny takes a shine to her and arranges for her to deliver food to them at the end of her shift. They are associated with Sally (Maury Chaykin), a gangster who wants them to appear at the opening of his new hotel. He doesn't care if they have just come off of a 72 hour telethon. Reuben (David Hayman) is the valet for the two men, but he spends most of his time cleaning up after Lanny, finding him girls, paying them off, etc.The film depicts multiple timelines, flashing back and forth between 1957 and 1972. As Karen is investigating the events in 1972, this becomes `Present Day' for the film and provides an interesting glimpse into the culture of this period. As she gets to know Vince, traveling back and forth to Los Angeles, she arrives at his home in the Hollywood Hills, dominated by a swimming pool and lots of windows. The home is decorated in high-70s chic and Vince has the sideburns and flared pants enjoyed by many swingers during that period.""Truth"" is fairly frank in it's depiction of Lanny and Vince's sexual proclivities. They are stars and spend a lot of time pursuing anonymous sex with their adoring fans. As mentioned, this is the primary function of Reuben, their valet. Later, Vince seduces Karen in a very unusual, strangely erotic fashion. The reason for this act is as twisted as the rest of their values. Drugs are also a heavy influence on their lives.When Karen finally uncovers the truth, the resolution to this is touching and well-done.I have not seen every film made by Atom Egoyan, but the titles I have been exposed to have left me with a very favorable impression. In ""Felicia's Journey"", ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and now ""Where the Truth Lies"", he isn't afraid to create complex characters or to tell a story that may end in a sad way. His characters benefit from the multi-faceted elements of their nature. Not a single character is `Good' or `Bad', they have varying degrees of these characteristics, mixed with strange philosophies, proclivities and feelings. Real people aren't single-minded, why should the characters in a film? In my mind, this makes Egoyam's films more realistic and memorable. Because he manages to create three-dimensional characters; liked, disliked, abhorred, by the viewer, he manages to create stories which tell more, say more, about these same characters. In ""Felicia's Journey"", Bob Hoskins plays a truly despicable man, but below the surface, there are things about him that we understand. We may not necessarily like him, but we can believe he might exist. In ""Where the Truth Lies"", not a single one of the three main characters is completely likable, some to varying degrees, but this makes them seem more real. It also adds a surface to the showbiz persona of Collins and Morris making them more truthful. When the cameras are on, they are smiling, happy, buddies. When the cameras are off, the dark sides begin to emerge.""Where the Truth Lies"" is a very interesting look at two fictional stars and the hell they create for themselves. As I watched, a thought always lurked in the back of my head. What if half of the things they did happened to other stars in real life? I am sure there are celebrities who have gone down this same path, and this makes the film that much more interesting.",4,"Truth, Lies and Stardom",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,6797,"['1957',

963583,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000DZ853Q,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[6, 8]","First of all, I was rather surprised that this film got an NC-17 rating, because it's not very over-the-film for a Hollywood movie, and it's certainly more artsy and sophisticated than those B-movies like John Water's to give an example. A warning for all Colin Firth female fans, do prepare to see a shocking bisexual scene played out later on in the film. This thriller directed by acclaimed Canadian director Atom Egoyan(Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter) is probably the most thought-provacative sexy thriller this year, and it features mesmerizing performances from Colin Firth, Allison Lohman, and Kevin Bacon.The story takes place in late '50s and '70s, and Allison Lohman plays Karen, an ambitious journalist on a mission to investigate the true story behind the death of Maureen O'Flaherty(Rachel Blanchard) that took place in the '50s which involved the legendary duo entertainers Lanny Morris(Kevin Bacon) and Vince Collins(Colin Firth). Vince and Lanny were best friends and showbiz partners until the day  the murder/suicide crime takes place. After fifteen years, Karen is eager to search for the truth behind the mystery. Her vulnerable and curious nature puts her through a taste of drugs, temptations, and lesbian sex for the first time. In order to uncover the truth, she submits herself to the web of deception and lust. She gets involved intimately with Lanny and Vince and soon learns the secrets and lies between them, but there will be consequences if she unveils the truth.....The original score and camera work is brilliant to provide that suspenseful and captivating mood in this film. I must say that the first half of the film is rather slow and less intense, and all the juicy details come in later on. There is plenty of sex and nudity in this film, even Allison Lohman had to go topless. Got to give her the credit for carrying a heavy duty role with a performance that should garner her first best actress nomination if this film was more widely seen. Colin Firth had less material to work with in the first half, but he's got a few great scenes opposite Lohman. He had to go from nice and charming on the surface to becoming dark, twisted, and highly sexualized. I was very surprised that he was willing to jump on Kevin Bacon in what was considered to be the most daring sex scene in the film. Ultimately, this film belongs to Kevin Bacon, who turned in a more striking and multilayered performance that's definitely on my top 10 best of the year. His mannerism and emotional range is brilliantly conveyed throughout this film. It was mesmerizing when he gave the reaction to Colin Firth the minute he learned that he was bisexual. Also when he broke down into massive tears during a live tele-marathon performance as a result of breaking up the so-called ""marriage"" with Firth. Veteran Canadian actors Don McKellar and Arsinee Khanjian made a camero appearance as Lohman's colleques.",5,The Truth Lies in Forbidden Places.,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,2913,"['First', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'film', 'got', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'not', 'very', 'over-the-film', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'certainly', 'more', 'artsy', 'sophisticated', 'B-movies', 'John', 'Water', 'give', 'example', 'warning', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'female', 'fans', 'do', 'prepare', 'see', 'shocking', 'bisexual', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'later', 'film', 'thriller', 'directed', 'acclaimed', 'Canadian', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'Exotica', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'probably', 'most', 'thought-provacative', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'year', 'mesmerizing', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'Kevin', 'Bacon.The', 'story', 'place', 'late', ""'50s"", ""'70s"", 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'Karen', 'ambitious', 'journalist', 'mission', 'investigate', 'true', 'story', 'death', 'Maureen', ""O'Flaherty"", 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'took', 'place', ""'50s"", 'involved', 'legendary', 'duo', 'entertainers', 'Lanny', 'Morris', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Vince', 'Collins', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Vince', 'Lanny', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'showbiz', 'partners', 'day', 'murder/suicide', 'crime', 'place', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Karen', 'eager', 'search', 'truth', 'mystery', 'vulnerable', 'curious', 'nature', 'taste', 'drugs', 'temptations', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'order', 'uncover', 'truth', 'web', 'deception', 'lust', 'involved', 'intimately', 'Lanny', 'Vince', 'soon', 'secrets', 'lies', 'will', 'be', 'consequences', 'truth', 'original', 'score', 'camera', 'work', 'brilliant', 'provide', 'suspenseful', 'captivating', 'mood', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'less', 'intense', 'juicy', 'details', 'come', 'later', 'plenty', 'sex', 'nudity', 'film', 'even', 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'had', 'go', 'topless', 'Got', 'give', 'credit', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'duty', 'role', 'performance', 'should', 'garner', 'first', 'best', 'actress', 'nomination', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'widely', 'seen', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'had', 'less', 'material', 'work', 'first', 'half', 'got', 'few', 'great', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Lohman', 'had', 'go', 'nice', 'charming', 'surface', 'becoming', 'dark', 'twisted', 'highly', 'sexualized', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'was', 'willing', 'jump', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'most', 'daring', 'sex', 'scene', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'turned', 'more', 'striking', 'multilayered', 'performance', 'definitely', 'top', '10', 'best', 'year', 'mannerism', 'emotional', 'range', 'brilliantly', 'conveyed', 'film', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'when', 'gave', 'reaction', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'minute', 'learned', 'was', 'bisexual', 'Also', 'when', 'broke', 'down', 'massive', 'tears', 'live', 'tele-marathon', 'performance', 'result', 'breaking', 'up', 'so-called', 'marriage', 'Firth', 'Veteran', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'Arsinee', 'Khanjian', 'made', 'camero', 'appearance', 'Lohman', 'colleques']",N/A
963584,A35S3VPS50CCX0,B000DZ853Q,W.Kim,"[3, 4]","On the recommendation of a writer I know, I sat down with friends to screen the unrated theatrical cut of Atom Egoyen's 2005 film, ""Where the Truth Lies"" on DVD.Shuttling back and forth between 1957 and 1972-3, ""Where the Truth Lies,"" tells the story of an young reporter, Karen O'Connor, played by Allison Lohman, who has been contracted to ""ghost write"" the biography of Vince Collins (a restrained Colin Firth), a semi-retired entertainer turned talent-manager, who once was partnered up in a wildly successful night act with fellow performer, Lanny Morris (an excellent Kevin Bacon), who by the 70's has carved out a career as a producer. O'Connor's publisher, pushes Lohman to dig up the truth behind a mysterious and unsolved 1957 murder of a college student that precipitated the break up of Morris and Collins partnership (very loosely based on the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis act)  fifteen years earlier.Watching ""Where the Truth Lies,"" (I've seen it twice) I was surprised. This is a film that had been savaged by almost all of the reviewers from the major US news outlets for being too sordid, sex-soaked, and critically hamstrung by the performance of the Lohman' point of view character. Perhaps I'm a bit jaded, but while the film is loaded with sex scenes (five by my count) and the goings on are a bit sordid (we are talking about the excesses of successful performers in the 1950's and the decadent, drug-addled, ""free love"" hangover era, of the pre-disco 1970's) none of the scenes are gratuitous (except possibly a quick throwaway visual gag early in the film) and serve a function in the narrative. Moreover I though Lohman was utterly believable in her role as the ambitious young reporter, who is desperately trying to break into the ""big time"" with a major scoop - though the show really belongs to Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth playing the performers at the height of their fame in the '50's and later on, as respectively a producer and a talent manager in the 70's.  The narrative is well-shot and well-structured (long before films like ""Momento"" Egoyan was apioneer at the practice of using flashbacks and slightly surreal shifts between subjective experience and ""objective"" reality to create emotional resonance in audience, particularly in his earlier films, ""Exotica"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"") and features the clever use of repeating motifs, particularly visual and musical references to ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass,"" references that are entirely appropriate to the movie's rather adult themes.I really don't understand why this film was so throughly panned when it first came out: for what it's worth I recommend it, and it easily bears repeat viewings (i've seen it twice so far). [...] Get the unrated cut. There's no point in seeing a censored version.",5,Unfairly Underrated Noirish Mystery...,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,2808,"['recommendation', 'writer', 'know', 'sat', 'down', 'friends', 'screen', 'unrated', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Atom', 'Egoyen', '2005', 'film', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'DVD.Shuttling', 'back', 'forth', '1957', '1972-3', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', 'story', 'young', 'reporter', 'Karen', ""O'Connor"", 'played', 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'who', 'been', 'contracted', 'ghost', 'write', 'biography', 'Vince', 'Collins', 'restrained', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'semi-retired', 'entertainer', 'turned', 'talent-manager', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'partnered', 'up', 'wildly', 'successful', 'night', 'act', 'fellow', 'performer', 'Lanny', 'Morris', 'excellent', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', '70', 'carved', 'out', 'career', 'producer', ""O'Connor"", 'publisher', 'Lohman', 'dig', 'up', 'truth', 'mysterious', 'unsolved', '1957', 'murder', 'college', 'student', 'precipitated', 'break', 'Morris', 'Collins', 'partnership', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Dean', 'Martin-Jerry', 'Lewis', 'act', 'fifteen', 'years', 'earlier.Watching', 'Where', 'Truth', 'Lies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'savaged', 'almost', 'reviewers', 'major', 'US', 'news', 'outlets', 'being', 'too', 'sordid', 'sex-soaked', 'critically', 'hamstrung', 'performance', 'Lohman', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'bit', 'jaded', 'film', 'loaded', 'sex', 'scenes', 'five', 'count', 'goings', 'are', 'bit', 'sordid', 'are', 'talking', 'excesses', 'successful', 'performers', '1950', 'decadent', 'drug-addled', 'free', 'love', 'hangover', 'era', 'pre-disco', '1970', 'none', 'scenes', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'possibly', 'quick', 'throwaway', 'visual', 'gag', 'early', 'film', 'serve', 'function', 'narrative', 'Moreover', 'Lohman', 'was', 'utterly', 'believable', 'role', 'ambitious', 'young', 'reporter', 'who', 'desperately', 'trying', 'break', 'big', 'time', 'major', 'scoop', 'show', 'really', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'playing', 'performers', 'height', 'fame', ""'50"", 'later', 'respectively', 'producer', 'talent', 'manager', '70', 'narrative', 'well-shot', 'well-structured', 'long', 'before', 'films', 'Momento', 'Egoyan', 'was', 'apioneer', 'practice', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'shifts', 'subjective', 'experience', 'objective', 'reality', 'create', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'audience', 'particularly', 'earlier', 'films', 'Exotica', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'clever', 'use', 'repeating', 'motifs', 'particularly', 'visual', 'musical', 'references', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'are', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'rather', 'adult', 'themes.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'throughly', 'panned', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'what', 'worth', 'recommend', 'easily', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'so', 'far', '[', 'Get', 'unrated', 'cut', 'point', 'seeing', 'censored', 'version']",N/A
