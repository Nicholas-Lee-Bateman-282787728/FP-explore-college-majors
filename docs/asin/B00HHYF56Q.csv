1689574,A118A49ORGNEUM,B00HHYF56Q,D. Barber,"[1, 1]","Clearly, a lot of people were disappointed by this product. I managed to see the first two episodes, but the last was completely unplayable. It crashed at around the 43 minute mark. I'm doubly disappointed because I'm a huge Angela Bettis fan, and it was her segment that was unwatchable. Because I am a Bettis fan, I'm going order a replacement, but I wanted buyers to know that there is more than just artistic issues here.As for the first two episodes, they were not really awful, just not very good. Tom Holland's presence was not too annoying, he's basically playing the Rod Serling bit in The Twilight Zone.Update: It's now May 14th. Amazon sent me my replacement disc and it plays perfectly. I found that there were more segments than I thought. I forgot to count them but there were maybe seven or so. Now that I have seen the whole disc I can say that it is uniformly awful. Bad stories, bad acting (some almost comically bad, as though the actors were trying to be bad for comic effect. They weren't). As usual, Angela Bettis was the only good thing here, and even she couldn't rise above this trash. A bad movie.

1689577,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00HHYF56Q,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","The film contains about 9 or so episodes from as short as 7 minutes, to a final episode that was about a half hour. It had to be divided into episodes at that length. The stories involved various aspect of the horror world, some with new modern twists involving gadgets, but pretty much the same stories we were used to watching aka &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; or &#34;Creep Show.&#34; For seasoned viewers there won't be any twists or surprises. However a younger generation who never grew up watching the &#34;classics&#34; should find a wealth of enjoyment in these tales.The beginning of each tale includes a completely unnecessary mini plot spoiler introduction by Tom Holland. It adds nothing to the episode. It lacks the entertainment value of Creep Show and the insight of a Zone introduction. Its sole purpose is to be a Tom Holland ego fest. I found him to be the biggest negative aspect of the features...like Joe Jackson being in his own videos.Worth a view for even seasoned viewers, just don't expect any new twists to the twisted tales.Parental Guide: F-bombs.
