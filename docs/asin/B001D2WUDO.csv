No offense but you must be a little slow on the uptake, cuz he wasnt all over the place with his jokes, juat pay attention. Katt Williams always drops knowledge in his shows, once again pay attention. Another awesome performance from Katt Williams and its entirely new material from him, unlike Pimp Chronicles and American Hustle which were good performances but basically a re-hash of the material with slight differences that can be found in the Katt Williams Live DVD. I do own all of his stand up DVDs so far as well. Anyways this DVD is definately 5 stars in the perfomance and production.

Anyhow, the more I view it from reading from reviewer's perspective, the more I appreciate it in retrospect. I had seen various portions of it prior to the DVD on YouTube thanks to uploaders from across the 100 city tour. So by the time I purchased my ticket day of the show, I figured I would know the whole show in full. What surprised me seeing the entire routine in full start to finish was not as funny THAT day. But now seeing the promo releases, reading various commentary from all levels of perception, it's funnier than it could ever be.The material is very relevant to what we are experiencing as people. Reading many, many Blogs, Katt is quoted almost on every line, no catch phrase from every DVD he's released. Getting in tune with your ""star player"" is about self esteem which a lot of folks lack - badly. Making sure your team is in tune - make sure those around you have your back as you should have theirs. Check your own house before stepping into someone else's. He even touches on how the Paralympics runner was mistreated. Katt tied all his thoughts together in this just like The Pimp Chronicles which will forever remain #1 in my collection. All topics were seemeless and flowed very well - all in accord with his animatics. He's always been a very animated and hyper individual. This adds to the humor he's bringing forth because you can just laugh at his facial expressions and/or even leap and curl around a stool (and holding on without tilting backwards/forwards) imitating a hungry lion on a wildebeast.GET THE DVD is my final word.",4,From 5th Row,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,1667,"['was', '5th', 'row', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'course', ""'m"", 'still', 'looking', 'very', 'closely', 'EXTRA', 'footage', 'Anyhow', 'more', 'view', 'reading', 'reviewer', 'perspective', 'more', 'appreciate', 'retrospect', 'had', 'seen', 'various', 'portions', 'DVD', 'YouTube', 'thanks', 'uploaders', '100', 'city', 'tour', 'So', 'time', 'purchased', 'ticket', 'day', 'show', 'figured', 'would', 'know', 'whole', 'show', 'full', 'What', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'entire', 'routine', 'full', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'day', 'now', 'seeing', 'promo', 'reading', 'various', 'commentary', 'levels', 'perception', 'funnier', 'could', 'ever', 'be.The', 'material', 'very', 'relevant', 'what', 'are', 'experiencing', 'people', 'Reading', 'many', 'many', 'Blogs', 'Katt', 'quoted', 'almost', 'line', 'catch', 'phrase', 'DVD', 'released', 'Getting', 'tune', 'star', 'player', 'self', 'esteem', 'lot', 'folks', 'lack', 'badly', 'Making', 'sure', 'team', 'tune', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'back', 'should', 'have', 'theirs', 'Check', 'own', 'house', 'stepping', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'how', 'Paralympics', 'runner', 'was', 'mistreated', 'Katt', 'tied', 'thoughts', 'together', 'just', 'Pimp', 'Chronicles', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', '1', 'collection', 'topics', 'were', 'seemeless', 'flowed', 'very', 'well', 'accord', 'animatics', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'animated', 'hyper', 'individual', 'humor', 'bringing', 'forth', 'can', 'just', 'laugh', 'facial', 'expressions', 'and/or', 'even', 'leap', 'curl', 'stool', 'holding', 'tilting', 'backwards/forwards', 'imitating', 'hungry', 'lion', 'wildebeast.GET', 'THE', 'DVD', 'final', 'word']",N/A
