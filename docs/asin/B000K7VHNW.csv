When I found out that Salma Hayek was in one(a campy one, at that) with Penelope Cruz, I decided to get the movie and watch it. Besides, like most of the movies I've found, it was in a bargain bin. It was great!!!Maria Alvarez and Sarah Sandoval are two mexican women who seek to avenge their fathers' deaths by Tyler Jackson. Jackson, who's employed by the Bank of New York, is sent to Mexico to buy land and open banks. Thing is, he shoots down any one who opposes him from doing so. The two ladies join together and start robbing the banks owned by the Bank of New York. So, Quentin Cooke, a forensic criminalogist, goes on the lookout for them...only to be converted to their cause in an effort to bring down Jackson.Directed by Espen Sandberg & Joachim Roenning, the film stars: Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Dwight Yoakam, Sam Shepard, Steve Zahn, and Denis Arndt. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously with a good bit of light humor and, as most of the reviewers here will agree, plenty of sex appeal.Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Salma Hayek or Penelope Cruz.",5,Bandidas.........,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,1198,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Salma', 'Hayek', ""'m"", 'also', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', ""'em"", 'When', 'found', 'out', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'was', 'one', 'campy', 'one', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'decided', 'get', 'movie', 'watch', 'most', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'found', 'was', 'bargain', 'bin', 'was', 'great', 'Maria', 'Alvarez', 'Sarah', 'Sandoval', 'are', 'two', 'mexican', 'women', 'who', 'seek', 'avenge', 'fathers', 'deaths', 'Tyler', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', 'who', 'employed', 'Bank', 'New', 'York', 'sent', 'Mexico', 'buy', 'land', 'open', 'banks', 'Thing', 'shoots', 'down', 'one', 'who', 'doing', 'so', 'two', 'ladies', 'join', 'together', 'start', 'robbing', 'banks', 'owned', 'Bank', 'New', 'York', 'So', 'Quentin', 'Cooke', 'forensic', 'criminalogist', 'lookout', 'only', 'be', 'converted', 'cause', 'effort', 'bring', 'down', 'Jackson.Directed', 'Espen', 'Sandberg', 'Joachim', 'Roenning', 'film', 'stars', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Denis', 'Arndt', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'good', 'bit', 'light', 'humor', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'will', 'agree', 'plenty', 'sex', 'appeal.Definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Penelope', 'Cruz']",Bandidas

Afterwards and bumbling their way through holdups, the ladies attempt to blackmail a Sherlock Holmes wannabe NYPD detective (an extremely miscast Steve Zahn), who is also the fiance of the railroad owner's daughter; however, being at heart nice sweet gals, Sara and Maria instead resort to a much more effective style of 'friendly persuasion' to enlist the dorky-but-crafty New York cop.BANDIDAS has its moments of cliff hangers and hilarious situations, but overall falls flat, leaving an ending which more than hints at an intended sequel.

Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz begin as opposites in a familiar western theme of revenge against the greedy out to murder, steal, and swindle their land. Initially distrustful of each other, fate soon unites the two feminine heroines against the unscrupulous Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam), ultimately prevailing in this swashbuckling action comedy. This film is multiculturalism at its funniest; it's a joint French/Mexican/American production starring the Spanish Cruz, the Mexican Hayek, filmed by two Norwegian directors, shot in Mexico.Initially released only in Europe in 2006, the movie is over the top all the way.  It features bank robbery basic training, pratfalls galore, banjos, ice skates, and even ""Matrix-y"" type slow-mo action. This is the funniest western since Shanghai Noon, but it didn't have catfights. Veteran comedic comrade Steve Zahn is hilarious as the crime scene expert who joins forces with the bad girl robin hoods. Watching his ""seduction ""scene with Cruz and Hayek, I concluded that he must be the luckiest man in the history of motion pictures! As a robbery/action movie, I thought of comparing Bandidas to Oceans 11 and Mission Impossible, but this is sexier and funnier. Cruz and Hayek make a dynamic duo, and true to form in the end, they ride off into the sunset their legend only to increase.I would have linked more special features. The principal actresses are interviewed, detailing that they had wanted to work together for years and that the whole western comedy robbery concept was theirs.

While Salma Hayek is not the box office draw she once was, her co-star Penelope Cruz is red hot right now thanks to an excellent performance in Pedro Almodovar's Volver. Bandidas is essentially a popcorn movie that would be ideal for mainstream, multiplex audiences so what's the deal?Bandidas trots out the usual clich&eacute;s: the ornery horse, the bickering heroes (including the obligatory catfight), the despicable villain dressed in black, a mangy yet lovable dog sidekick and plenty of slapstick that is predictably broad and downright silly in nature.But let's face it, you're not watching Bandidas for thoughtful character development but rather for the lovely leading ladies who have pretty decent chemistry together but are let down by the clich&eacute;-ridden (even by Luc Besson's standards), pedestrian screenplay. Cruz and Hayek provide the requisite eye candy but much to the dismay of their male fans the only nudity is courtesy of Steve Zahn. One wonders what this film would have been like in the capable hands of someone like Robert Rodriguez who has an innate understanding and knowledge of how genre films work but then again, he's already visited this kind of material with his Mariachi trilogy which were essentially modern westerns. That being said, Bandidas is pleasant enough if not an instantly forgettable time waster.There is an audio commentary by Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz. It is pretty obvious from the way they talk to each other - the familiarity and casual shorthand - that they have been good friends for years. Hayek proudly says that they shot the entire movie in Mexico and she even points out the various locations. There are occasional lulls on this track but they aren't too long as the two women recount anecdotes about filming and praise certain cast and crew members. Like the movie itself, this is a pleasant enough track but hardly essential listening.""Burning Up the Set with Salma and Penelope"" is a standard promotional featurette.

As vividly beautiful as the two actresses are, together they are physically and temperamentally too similar to be credible opposites. They are both compelling enough presences onscreen, especially playing such self-sufficient women, but the lack of contrast makes it hard to think they are little more than two halves of the same character. They are guided by first-time filmmakers Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg, which may account for the lack of visual flair that Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino could have brought to the story. Regardless, the pacing is lightning-quick, and the cartoonish touches provide the requisite popcorn entertainment.Set in turn-of-the-last-century Mexico, two women are leading separate lives - Sara Sandoval is the pampered, worldly daughter of a wealthy landowner, and Maria Alvarez is the dirt-poor farm girl who has relied on her horse sense and keen marksmanship. Their paths cross when seedy, bloodthirsty robber baron Tyler Jackson steals from their respective fathers and kills them both. Naturally, Sara and Maria seek revenge but must settle their own class-conflict squabbling first (via the inevitable cat-fighting scene). With the help of grizzled former bank robber Bill Buck, Sara and Maria become ""Las Bandidas"", Mexico's version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Things get complicated when Jackson hires New York criminologist Quentin Cooke to track down the women, but you can probably guess that Quentin succumbs to their ample charms. The script throws in some interesting economic theory discussions, but mostly flimsy excuses are made to insert some silly scenes like having the women dress as saloon prostitutes out of the Moulin Rouge to seduce Quentin.Other than the mandatory gunplay, the elaborate stunts include a Tarzan-like use of a swinging chain, the creative use of ice skates during a heist, a slo-mo action scene that feels stolen fromThe Matrix, and a paean to the famous river-jumping scene inButch Cassidy. There is no doubt that Cruz and Hayek are having a good time, though they are hardly stretched here. Even though they bond in a predicable way, it would have been more interesting to insert some ambiguity along the lines ofThelma & Louise. With his bedraggled Marilyn Manson-like hair bested only by Javier Bardem's pageboy inNo Country for Old Men, Dwight Yoakam is not quite as menacing a presence as Walker. Steve Zahn also seems comparatively passive as Quentin, even though he looks appropriately dazed in the seduction scene. Sam Shepard is barely in the film as Buck, but he makes his brief sequence count with reliable authority. The extras on the 2007 DVD are sparse - a superficial four-minute making-of featurette, the original theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by Hayek and Cruz, has entertainment value but not too much insight into the production itself.",3,"Butch and Sundance Redux as Lovely, Loyal Latinas in Lightweight Escapist Fare",1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,3138,"['Pairing', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'campy', 'comic', 'buddy', 'western', 'out', 'be', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'ploy', 'just', 'wish', '2006', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'true', 'grit', 'sharper', 'sense', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Robert', 'Mark', 'Kamen', 'vividly', 'beautiful', 'two', 'actresses', 'are', 'together', 'are', 'physically', 'temperamentally', 'too', 'similar', 'be', 'credible', 'opposites', 'are', 'compelling', 'enough', 'presences', 'onscreen', 'especially', 'playing', 'such', 'self-sufficient', 'women', 'lack', 'contrast', 'hard', 'think', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'two', 'halves', 'same', 'character', 'are', 'guided', 'first-time', 'filmmakers', 'Joachim', 'Roenning', 'Espen', 'Sandberg', 'may', 'account', 'lack', 'visual', 'flair', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'story', 'Regardless', 'pacing', 'lightning-quick', 'cartoonish', 'touches', 'provide', 'requisite', 'popcorn', 'entertainment.Set', 'turn-of-the-last-century', 'Mexico', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'leading', 'separate', 'lives', 'Sara', 'Sandoval', 'pampered', 'worldly', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'landowner', 'Maria', 'Alvarez', 'dirt-poor', 'farm', 'girl', 'who', 'relied', 'horse', 'sense', 'keen', 'marksmanship', 'paths', 'cross', 'when', 'seedy', 'bloodthirsty', 'robber', 'baron', 'Tyler', 'Jackson', 'steals', 'respective', 'fathers', 'Naturally', 'Sara', 'Maria', 'seek', 'revenge', 'must', 'settle', 'own', 'class-conflict', 'squabbling', 'first', 'inevitable', 'cat-fighting', 'scene', 'help', 'grizzled', 'former', 'bank', 'robber', 'Bill', 'Buck', 'Sara', 'Maria', 'become', 'Las', 'Bandidas', 'Mexico', 'version', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'Jackson', 'New', 'York', 'criminologist', 'Quentin', 'Cooke', 'track', 'down', 'women', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'Quentin', 'succumbs', 'ample', 'charms', 'script', 'interesting', 'economic', 'theory', 'discussions', 'mostly', 'flimsy', 'excuses', 'are', 'made', 'insert', 'silly', 'scenes', 'having', 'women', 'dress', 'saloon', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'seduce', 'Quentin.Other', 'mandatory', 'gunplay', 'elaborate', 'stunts', 'include', 'Tarzan-like', 'use', 'swinging', 'chain', 'creative', 'use', 'ice', 'skates', 'heist', 'slo-mo', 'action', 'scene', 'stolen', 'fromThe', 'Matrix', 'paean', 'famous', 'river-jumping', 'scene', 'inButch', 'Cassidy', 'doubt', 'Cruz', 'Hayek', 'are', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'hardly', 'stretched', 'here', 'Even', 'bond', 'predicable', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'insert', 'ambiguity', 'lines', 'ofThelma', 'Louise', 'bedraggled', 'Marilyn', 'Manson-like', 'hair', 'bested', 'only', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'pageboy', 'inNo', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'not', 'quite', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Walker', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'also', 'comparatively', 'passive', 'Quentin', 'even', 'appropriately', 'dazed', 'seduction', 'scene', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'barely', 'film', 'Buck', 'brief', 'sequence', 'count', 'reliable', 'authority', 'extras', '2007', 'DVD', 'are', 'sparse', 'superficial', 'four-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hayek', 'Cruz', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'insight', 'production']",Bandidas

I thought that the cat-fight scene alone would be good for at least some gratuitous frontal nudity.  Considering the sexy box-cover, I feel that my disappointment is justified.  Afterall, it's clearly what they were attempting to use to sell the movie.Maria (Penelope Cruz) and Sara (Salma Hayek) become improbable bank robbers - with tutelage from an old crook named Buck (Sam Shepard) - when brought together by tragedy.  One rich, Sara, and one poor, Maria, are polar opposites.  Initially they are naturally outwardly opposite of one another, and therefore enemies.  That all changes when each girl suffers through either a fatal or near-fatal family experience - a direct result of an evil railroad construction project planned to go straight through each girl's property; from there on out, they each have the same mission of revenge.The rest of the movie is just a showcase for Hayak and Cruz, a reason to show them both off in attractive clothing and beautiful Mexican scenery, as they fight the apparently evil Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakum) and his bank/railroad enterprise.  But, really, it's just a reason to watch Hayak and Cruz get in a cat fight while wearing revealing clothing.

The plot wasn't the most original, though the fact that the bank robbers were women was a little different since most westerns - or at least the ones I've seen - haven't had women bank robbers.In this film we have Sara and Maria who are two very different women with nothing in common before their fathers were killed in connection to the railroad that was coming to Mexico. Tyler Jackson was going around taking land from poor farmers that was in the path of the railroad. He wouldn't take no for an answer and would resort to anything, including killing, to get the land. Maria and Sara decided to fight back and steal back what Tyler had been taking. They convinced Bill Buck, a retired bank robber, to train them. Quentin was a criminologist that was sent to Mexico to investigate the bank robberies. Things weren't adding up for Quentin in his investigation and he ended up helping Maria and Sara.The case for Bandidas did call the movie a comedy and describe it as hilarious. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but the movie was far from hilarious. I really wouldn't even consider the movie a comedy. It was more of an action adventure type of movie with a small amount of humor added in here and there. I think that more things were intended to be funny that just didn't make me laugh. The funniest things for me involved Quentin and even those scenes weren't that funny. There wasn't that much adventure in the movie either though there was enough going on to keep things interesting. Action turned up in some scenes through some gun fights and an explosion or two. For a movie described as an action adventure, there wasn't enough action. The little violence that was in the movie wasn't graphic. Other than that I ended up enjoying Bandidas for the most part. The movie managed to be entertaining overall even though it did have some problems. The movie can be enjoyed as long expectations aren't too high. People that like the cast might enjoy the movie.",3,"""Always count your bullets, senoritas""",1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,2313,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'westerns', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'years', 'usually', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'type', 'reading', 'case', 'Bandidas', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'overall', 'plot', 'kept', 'interest', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'turned', 'robbing', 'banks', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'fact', 'bank', 'robbers', 'were', 'women', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'most', 'westerns', 'least', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'women', 'bank', 'robbers.In', 'film', 'have', 'Sara', 'Maria', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'nothing', 'common', 'fathers', 'were', 'killed', 'connection', 'railroad', 'was', 'coming', 'Mexico', 'Tyler', 'Jackson', 'was', 'going', 'taking', 'land', 'poor', 'farmers', 'was', 'path', 'railroad', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'would', 'resort', 'anything', 'including', 'killing', 'get', 'land', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'decided', 'fight', 'back', 'steal', 'back', 'what', 'Tyler', 'had', 'been', 'taking', 'convinced', 'Bill', 'Buck', 'retired', 'bank', 'robber', 'train', 'Quentin', 'was', 'criminologist', 'was', 'sent', 'Mexico', 'investigate', 'bank', 'robberies', 'Things', 'were', ""n't"", 'adding', 'up', 'Quentin', 'investigation', 'ended', 'up', 'helping', 'Maria', 'Sara.The', 'case', 'Bandidas', 'did', 'call', 'movie', 'comedy', 'describe', 'hilarious', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'made', 'laugh', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'hilarious', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'movie', 'comedy', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'adventure', 'type', 'movie', 'small', 'amount', 'humor', 'added', 'here', 'there', 'think', 'more', 'things', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'funniest', 'things', 'involved', 'Quentin', 'even', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'adventure', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'going', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Action', 'turned', 'up', 'scenes', 'gun', 'fights', 'explosion', 'two', 'movie', 'described', 'action', 'adventure', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'little', 'violence', 'was', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'Other', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'Bandidas', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'managed', 'be', 'entertaining', 'overall', 'even', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'People', 'cast', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Bandidas

My opinion will have to reside somewhere in the middle.It's really amazing to me that Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, as the stars, were responsible for a movie that's set in Mexico but where nobody ever speaks Spanish. This seems to me to be an unacceptabe denial of their heritage.  Perhaps a Spanish-language version of this movie was also made.  Even if that is the case, the beautiful Spanish language ought to be found in a movie situated in a Spanish-speaking country.My central criticism of this film is that it is too lightweight.  The characters are simpletons and the plot is too trivial to even mention.  However, both Hayek and Cruz are truly very pleasing to watch and it is hard to sneer very forcefully at a movie that features them in all their sultry loveliness.As good as those two actresses are, it must be said that Dwight Yoakam gives the most delightful performance in the film.  He makes a clever and clownish vaudeville villain and the stringy black wig that he wears throughout the movie never ceases to amuse.  This is the best performance that I've seen Yoakam give.  He really is developing well as a comic actor.The very best feature of this film is the natural scenery that you will catch sight of behind the actors.  It is all quite gorgeous and Mexico has never looked more magnificent.

The story is definitely B-grade, but once expectations are properly dialed in, it's a hoot watching Cruz and Hayek chew up the scenery as they play mismatched and hot-tempered Mexican women of the 1880s who are out for revenge.Cruz stars as Maria Alvarez, the daughter of a dirt-poor farmer, while Hayek plays spoiled Sara Sandoval, the daughter of the region's richest man.  When they first meet, neither of them like each other.  But when Maria's father is gunned down and left for dead while their farm is taken from them and Sara's father is murdered in cold blood, they gradually bond for revenge.Country star Dwight Yoakum stars as the bad guy, Tyler Jackson, whose in charge of getting a railroad ran through the heart of Mexico by whatever means it takes.  Sam Shepard plays Bill Buck, a former bank robber who teaches Maria and Sara to rob banks and forge a friendship.  Steve Zahn stars as Quentin Cooke, a forerunner in forensic detection that gets caught up in Maria and Sara's schemes.  The film was produced and co-written by Luc Besson, who has headed up several action pictures such as THE PROFESSIONAL, THE TRANSPORTER, KISS OF THE DRAGON.Seeking revenge, Sara and Maria start robbing all the banks Tyler Jackson has taken over.  Each of them bring skills to their efforts.  Maria has a trick horse that she plays tic-tac-toe with and can talk to.  The horse also tells other horses what to do.  She's also a great pistol shot.  Sara, though she can simper over a manicure, is also a great planner and can be driven to see things through on a large scale.Although this film isn't going to change your life or address any social problems in a meaningful way (although there is a line in the movie that basically says the United States should keep their noses in their own affairs), BANDIDAS is easy on the eyes and fun to watch.  The plot takes predictable turns, but that's made up by the pacing.  You see everything coming, but it happens so quickly that you're already onto the next thing in record time.The predictable cat-fighting that goes on between the two leads doesn't get tiresome because it never takes itself seriously or overstays its welcome.  Likewise with the kissing scene (although Steve Zahn must have loved the retakes) where they competed for Quentin Cooke's attention.Everything comes comfortably together within ninety minutes, and the movie is a romp that involves sexy clothing, girls fighting, some real fighting, feats of derring-do that involve riding horses up ladders, swinging across courtyards, and blowing up buildings.  The dialogue is brisk and fun.BANDIDAS is a great buddy flick, and maybe even one for a light couples night because there's enough comedy and action to satisfy everyone.",4,"""Get Your Hands In The Air!""",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2914,"['Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'screen', 'today', 'serve', 'up', 'double', 'helping', 'South', 'Border', 'sex', 'sizzle', 'BANDIDAS', 'story', 'definitely', 'B-grade', 'once', 'expectations', 'are', 'properly', 'dialed', 'hoot', 'watching', 'Cruz', 'Hayek', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'play', 'mismatched', 'hot-tempered', 'Mexican', 'women', '1880s', 'who', 'are', 'out', 'revenge.Cruz', 'stars', 'Maria', 'Alvarez', 'daughter', 'dirt-poor', 'farmer', 'Hayek', 'spoiled', 'Sara', 'Sandoval', 'daughter', 'region', 'richest', 'man', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'other', 'when', 'Maria', 'father', 'gunned', 'down', 'left', 'dead', 'farm', 'taken', 'Sara', 'father', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'gradually', 'bond', 'revenge.Country', 'star', 'Dwight', 'Yoakum', 'bad', 'guy', 'Tyler', 'Jackson', 'charge', 'getting', 'railroad', 'ran', 'heart', 'Mexico', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Bill', 'Buck', 'former', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'rob', 'banks', 'forge', 'friendship', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Quentin', 'Cooke', 'forerunner', 'forensic', 'detection', 'caught', 'up', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'schemes', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'co-written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'headed', 'up', 'several', 'action', 'pictures', 'such', 'THE', 'PROFESSIONAL', 'THE', 'TRANSPORTER', 'KISS', 'THE', 'DRAGON.Seeking', 'revenge', 'Sara', 'Maria', 'start', 'robbing', 'banks', 'Tyler', 'Jackson', 'taken', 'over', 'bring', 'skills', 'efforts', 'Maria', 'trick', 'horse', 'tic-tac-toe', 'can', 'talk', 'horse', 'also', 'other', 'horses', 'what', 'do', 'also', 'great', 'pistol', 'shot', 'Sara', 'can', 'simper', 'manicure', 'also', 'great', 'planner', 'can', 'be', 'driven', 'see', 'things', 'large', 'scale.Although', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'life', 'address', 'social', 'problems', 'meaningful', 'way', 'line', 'movie', 'basically', 'United', 'States', 'should', 'keep', 'noses', 'own', 'affairs', 'BANDIDAS', 'easy', 'eyes', 'fun', 'watch', 'plot', 'predictable', 'turns', 'made', 'up', 'pacing', 'see', 'everything', 'coming', 'so', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'already', 'next', 'thing', 'record', 'time.The', 'predictable', 'cat-fighting', 'two', 'leads', ""n't"", 'get', 'tiresome', 'never', 'seriously', 'welcome', 'Likewise', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'must', 'have', 'loved', 'retakes', 'where', 'competed', 'Quentin', 'Cooke', 'attention.Everything', 'comfortably', 'together', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'movie', 'romp', 'sexy', 'clothing', 'girls', 'fighting', 'real', 'fighting', 'feats', 'derring-do', 'involve', 'riding', 'horses', 'ladders', 'swinging', 'courtyards', 'blowing', 'up', 'buildings', 'dialogue', 'brisk', 'fun.BANDIDAS', 'great', 'buddy', 'flick', 'maybe', 'even', 'one', 'light', 'couples', 'night', 'enough', 'comedy', 'action', 'satisfy', 'everyone']",Bandidas

Theoretically.  This 2006 film, written and produced in part by French trash-auteur Luc Besson, not one of my favorite filmmakers at all, was a complete flop on release - I'm not sure it even got a theatrical run in the USA - and hasn't exactly gotten great marks from critics.  But, y'know, the ladies...and it was cheap, and I was in the mood for more Pen&eacute;lope after the latest Almod&oacute;var film, so here goes.And...it's not really that bad, though it is somewhat dull and watered-down and juvenile and certainly lacking in originality.  Let's start with the rating; I'm not one to usually complain about such things, but PG-13?  No nudity and very little real violence?  In a western starring the two hottest Latinas around?  What, are we supposed to be so enchanted by their silly, bitchy bantering with each other, and the slapdash storyline of the two empowered women taking back their country that we forgive the lack of bone-crunching, blood-drenched body count and the covered-up nature of the two bodacious bosoms?Well, almost, at least for a moment here and there.  Our story: rich educated Sara (Hayek) teams up with poor farm girl Maria (Cruz) to rob the banks taken over by the evil gringo Jackson (Dwight Yoakam, of course) who is bent on grabbing the whole wealth of Mexico on the pretext that he's the head of some big American bank consortium or some such thing.  That part of the film was just so silly from the get-go that I figured, why care?  What gets the two ladies together is that Jackson has killed Sara's father and wounded Maria's, and there is apparently nobody in all of northern Mexico who can stand up to him and his gang of a couple dozen thugs.And neither can they, until they're led to ex-bank robber Bill Buck (Sam Shepard, fine as always though it could have been anybody) who teaches them everything there is to know about shooting and escaping and such in a couple of weeks.  And when they run into criminologist Quentin (Steve Zahn), hired by Jackson to solve the bank robberies, they quickly convince him - via blackmail in a scene that offers the closest this film ever has to sex - that the mustache-twirling Jackson (a Snidely Whiplash clone if you know what I mean) is a lying thief and the duo becomes a trio from which no bank is safe!The chemistry between the two leading ladies is great, it's obvious they're close friends and had fun shooting this, and everybody seems to be having fun, which goes a long way for me with a stupid flick like this.  The photography by Thierry Arbogast, Besson's regular DP, is all sun-drenched late summer, overlit and golden, which usually irritates me but it works ok in this filmed-on-location Mexican setting; the music by Eric Serra is, not surprisingly, an unmemorable Ennio Morricone pastiche and there are many moments when directors Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg are clearly trying to go for a spaghetti feel, though the film always feels too fluffy and toned-down to ever get there.  The action sequences are pretty so-so, with a lot of slow-mo in the final gunfight, though surprisingly not much otherwise.So, it's not really good or bad - if you're a fan of the two leading ladies, or just in the mood for some harmless dumb fun, you could do a lot worse.  It's certainly better than Salma's previous western WILD WILD WEST.  The audio commentary featuring both actresses just riffing on stuff is plenty of fun, too.",3,Salma and Pen&eacute;lope make this - just - worth a spin,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,3611,"['Just', 'combination', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'enough', 'get', 'see', 'almost', 'anything', 'putting', 'western', 'well', 'just', 'more', 'delicious', 'Theoretically', '2006', 'film', 'written', 'produced', 'part', 'French', 'trash-auteur', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'complete', 'flop', 'release', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'got', 'theatrical', 'run', 'USA', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'gotten', 'great', 'marks', 'critics', ""y'know"", 'ladies', 'was', 'cheap', 'was', 'mood', 'more', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'latest', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'var', 'film', 'so', 'here', 'goes.And', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'watered-down', 'juvenile', 'certainly', 'lacking', 'originality', 'Let', 'start', 'rating', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'usually', 'complain', 'such', 'things', 'PG-13', 'No', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'violence', 'western', 'starring', 'two', 'hottest', 'Latinas', 'around', 'What', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'enchanted', 'silly', 'bitchy', 'bantering', 'other', 'slapdash', 'storyline', 'two', 'empowered', 'women', 'taking', 'back', 'country', 'forgive', 'lack', 'bone-crunching', 'blood-drenched', 'body', 'count', 'covered-up', 'nature', 'two', 'bodacious', 'bosoms', 'Well', 'almost', 'least', 'moment', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'rich', 'educated', 'Sara', 'Hayek', 'up', 'poor', 'farm', 'girl', 'Maria', 'Cruz', 'rob', 'banks', 'taken', 'over', 'evil', 'gringo', 'Jackson', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'course', 'who', 'bent', 'grabbing', 'whole', 'wealth', 'Mexico', 'pretext', 'head', 'big', 'American', 'bank', 'consortium', 'such', 'thing', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'silly', 'get-go', 'figured', 'why', 'care', 'What', 'two', 'ladies', 'together', 'Jackson', 'killed', 'Sara', 'father', 'wounded', 'Maria', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'northern', 'Mexico', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'gang', 'couple', 'dozen', 'can', ""'re"", 'led', 'ex-bank', 'robber', 'Bill', 'Buck', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'fine', 'always', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anybody', 'who', 'everything', 'there', 'know', 'shooting', 'escaping', 'such', 'couple', 'weeks', 'when', 'run', 'criminologist', 'Quentin', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'hired', 'Jackson', 'solve', 'bank', 'robberies', 'quickly', 'convince', 'blackmail', 'scene', 'closest', 'film', 'ever', 'sex', 'mustache-twirling', 'Jackson', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'clone', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'lying', 'thief', 'duo', 'trio', 'bank', 'safe', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'great', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'close', 'friends', 'had', 'fun', 'shooting', 'everybody', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'long', 'way', 'stupid', 'flick', 'photography', 'Thierry', 'Arbogast', 'Besson', 'regular', 'DP', 'sun-drenched', 'late', 'summer', 'overlit', 'golden', 'usually', 'ok', 'filmed-on-location', 'Mexican', 'setting', 'music', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'unmemorable', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'pastiche', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'when', 'directors', 'Joachim', 'Rnning', 'Espen', 'Sandberg', 'are', 'clearly', 'trying', 'go', 'spaghetti', 'feel', 'film', 'always', 'feels', 'too', 'fluffy', 'toned-down', 'ever', 'get', 'there', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'so-so', 'lot', 'slow-mo', 'final', 'gunfight', 'though', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'much', 'otherwise.So', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'bad', ""'re"", 'fan', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'just', 'mood', 'harmless', 'dumb', 'fun', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'certainly', 'better', 'Salma', 'previous', 'western', 'WILD', 'WILD', 'WEST', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'actresses', 'just', 'riffing', 'stuff', 'plenty', 'fun', 'too']",Bandidas
1031723,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000K7VHNW,Newton Ooi,"[0, 3]","Starting from ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", and continuing on through ""The Mexican"" and ""Three Amigos"", Hispanic actors have either taken the role of bad guy, or innocent bystander in Western / cowboy movies.  Hispanic actresses were often absent altogether, or were relegated to non-action roles.  Even the Zorro movies employ the Welsh actress, Caterina Zeta-Jones, to play the lead female role.  This tradition might explain why this movie flopped in the US theaters.  Starring the top two Hispanic actresses in Hollywood, this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable, much more so than is reflected by the viewing it received on the big screen.  The movie is about two daughters from different sides of town who end up forming a team to avenge their losses at the hands of the henchman of the Bank of New York.  Along the way, they pick up the help of an American criminal investigator by the name of Quinten Cooke.  Both women can and do kick butt in the Wild West, each in their own way.  One is a dead shot and the other is a skilled knife-thrower.  Both are also great on horseback and in hand-to-hand combat.This movie is a combination of action, comedy, and Western.  There is some romantic comedy, but no pure romance.  It is great for family viewing, and the only nudity in the movie is shot of Steve Zahn's buttocks.  Maybe shots of the two lead actresses' buttocks might have helped the movie's takes on the big screen.

But oddly this buddy flick works being at the very least entertaining.  Although this asks the question, if the two leads are female, should it instead be called a gal pal flick?

He also did some nefarious deeds to get control of the local banks for us Yankees.  Two of his targets include a farmer and the owner of various properties who both get shot by his hand.

Unfortunately Zahn is responcible for the only nude scene in the movie despite the massive amount of cleavage throughout.  And it's that cleavage that helps them take Zahn a hostage not as if any red blooded male wouldn't willing go with Hayek and Cruz.

Two drop-dead gorgeous young women (played by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek), decide to team-up and rob banks. This is quite a twist, from the usual macho western movie formula. The women commit robberies out of vengeance, in order to save land stolen from the Mexican people, by a villainous land baron.The violence in the film is ubiquitous, as it is in most westerns. However, the violent tone of the movie, is leavened with a jaunty, slap-stick humor. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, play the bank robbing duo more like a squabbling Laverne and Shirley, rather than Butch and Sundance. They have hilarious cat-fights with each other, as they try to learn to work together as a team.There's lots of incredible stunts throughout the film. Some are even performed by the horses, ridden by the characters. This is one of the few westerns I've seen, in which the steeds are as important to the plot, as the humans are. This factor highlights the overall lighted-hearted ambiance, running throughout the course of the film.The serious business of justice and revenge is pursued with gusto, by the beautiful, bank-robbing two-some. But along the way, the viewer is treated to lots of belly-laughs. Watching this film, is a great way to get your funny-bone tickled, while rooting for the good guys (in this case gals), to triumph over evil.",4,"Fun, rollicking western with a twist.",1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1450,"['Bandidas', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'ride', 'place', 'Mexico', 'Mexican', 'revolution', '1800s', 'Two', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'women', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'decide', 'team-up', 'rob', 'banks', 'quite', 'twist', 'usual', 'macho', 'western', 'movie', 'formula', 'women', 'commit', 'robberies', 'vengeance', 'order', 'save', 'land', 'stolen', 'Mexican', 'people', 'villainous', 'land', 'baron.The', 'violence', 'film', 'ubiquitous', 'most', 'westerns', 'However', 'violent', 'tone', 'movie', 'leavened', 'jaunty', 'slap-stick', 'humor', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'play', 'bank', 'robbing', 'duo', 'more', 'squabbling', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'rather', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'have', 'hilarious', 'cat-fights', 'other', 'try', 'learn', 'work', 'together', 'lots', 'incredible', 'stunts', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'performed', 'horses', 'ridden', 'characters', 'one', 'few', 'westerns', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'steeds', 'are', 'important', 'plot', 'humans', 'are', 'factor', 'overall', 'lighted-hearted', 'ambiance', 'running', 'course', 'film.The', 'serious', 'business', 'justice', 'revenge', 'pursued', 'gusto', 'beautiful', 'bank-robbing', 'two-some', 'way', 'viewer', 'treated', 'lots', 'belly-laughs', 'Watching', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'funny-bone', 'tickled', 'rooting', 'good', 'guys', 'case', 'gals', 'triumph', 'over']",Bandidas

1031736,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B000K7VHNW,Thor,"[36, 38]","Bandidas is the film where the two most famous latina stars of Hollywood, Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, team up as a dynamite cowgirl duo fighting evil in Mexico, 1888.There has been a large negative buzz about this film which is a bit unfair. Bandidas is just not to be taken seriously and is just good old entertainment where you have to have your sense of humor switched on. If you are expecting a serious western-drama, you have to look someplace else.The film, which was releashed in cinemas all over Europe in January and March 2006, wasn't a huge hit. The thing with people was that they were expecting something without so much humour but did get that, which dissapointed them. The humour is indeed a bit too much sometimes, but there are some hilarious moments in the film that are absolutely enjoyable.The chemistry between Cruz and Hayek is delicious and you can see in the way they are acting that they had a fun time on the set making the film. Next to Cruz and Hayek there is Steve Zahn. Zahn does what he does best: playing a comedic sidekick. He is funny and plays his part well. Dwight Yoakam feels a bit miscast in the film but he does an okay job as the main villian.There is some drama in the film that feels a bit outnumberd compairing it with the comedic moments which gives the film a kind of messy feeling sometimes. That is too bad, but overall doesn't bother you.The film has been professionally made and looks good. The special effects, the lush Mexican locations and cameramovements are beautifully done which gives great cinematography. Also the music, composed by Eric Serra is very nice and gives some scenes a nice powerboost and a fun western flavour.Still the best reason to buy the film are two elements: Cruz and Hayek. They are sexy, funny and make the film worth to take a look at. Some things are a bit over the top, but who cares: it entertains, and it is nice to kill 1 and a half hours of boredom and replace that with nice popcorn fun.And most importantly: Bandidas leaves you with a smile on your face, and that is what entertainment is all about.",3,Just have your Sense of Humour switched on and you will Enjoy Bandidas,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2092,"['Bandidas', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'latina', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'team', 'up', 'dynamite', 'cowgirl', 'duo', 'fighting', 'evil', 'Mexico', '1888.There', 'been', 'large', 'negative', 'buzz', 'film', 'bit', 'unfair', 'Bandidas', 'just', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'entertainment', 'where', 'have', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'switched', 'are', 'expecting', 'serious', 'western-drama', 'have', 'look', 'someplace', 'else.The', 'film', 'was', 'releashed', 'cinemas', 'Europe', 'January', 'March', '2006', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'hit', 'thing', 'people', 'was', 'were', 'expecting', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'humour', 'did', 'get', 'dissapointed', 'humour', 'indeed', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'sometimes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'enjoyable.The', 'chemistry', 'Cruz', 'Hayek', 'delicious', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'are', 'acting', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'set', 'making', 'film', 'Next', 'Cruz', 'Hayek', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Zahn', 'what', 'best', 'playing', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'funny', 'part', 'well', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'bit', 'miscast', 'film', 'okay', 'job', 'main', 'villian.There', 'drama', 'film', 'bit', 'outnumberd', 'compairing', 'comedic', 'moments', 'film', 'kind', 'messy', 'feeling', 'sometimes', 'too', 'bad', 'overall', ""n't"", 'bother', 'you.The', 'film', 'been', 'professionally', 'made', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'lush', 'Mexican', 'locations', 'cameramovements', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Also', 'music', 'composed', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'very', 'nice', 'scenes', 'nice', 'powerboost', 'fun', 'western', 'best', 'reason', 'buy', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'elements', 'Cruz', 'Hayek', 'are', 'sexy', 'funny', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'take', 'look', 'things', 'are', 'bit', 'top', 'who', 'nice', 'kill', '1', 'half', 'hours', 'boredom', 'replace', 'nice', 'popcorn', 'fun.And', 'most', 'importantly', 'Bandidas', 'smile', 'face', 'what', 'entertainment']",Bandidas

The movie tells the story of Sara, a rich spoiled girl, and Maria, a poor farmhand who lives with her father.  A New York banking company arrives in the area trying to acquire land and bank rights  in hopes of building a railroad through Mexico.  In the process, Sara's father is killed and Maria's is wounded.  The two women from completely different backgrounds team up and begin robbing those banks, Sara for revenge and Maria to give the land and money back to the people.  The plot is pretty simple, but this movie is entertaining throughout.  The main reason most people will pick this up is because Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek in a western doesn't sound too shabby, and they're right.  Both women are incredibly gorgeous and the script gives them several chances to show off their ""talents.""  But even more than that, Bandidas is funny with some pretty well-done action scenes that will keep your attention throughout.  Too few westerns are released nowadays, so don't let this one slip by.Sharing top billing, Cruz and Hayek play Maria and Sara, the two women from opposite sides of the track who team up to rob banks.  As mentioned, these women are gorgeous, but they seem to be having a genuinely good time and it shows in the final product.  The movie also gives them a chance to show off their comedic chops and do some fun action scenes that movie fans might not have seen before.  Steve Zahn, the lucky man that he is, costars as Quentin, a crime scene analyst (think 19th century CSI) who finds himself on the side of the bandidas while they fight over him.  Zahn is very good in the part, and steals some scenes with his facial expressions alone.  Dwight Yoakam plays Jackson, the lowly bank representative trying to hunt down and capture Maria and Sara.  And in a small part, Sam Shepard takes the part of Bill Buck, a grizzled old bank robber himself who teaches Maria and Sara the ""rules"" of robbing a bank.  The DVD offers a good commentary from stars Hayek and Cruz, a 5-minute featurette with interviews from the duo about the making of the movie, and a theatrical trailer.  So overall, don't be scared away that Bandidas is a straight-to-video release.  It has plenty of action, humor, and two gorgeous leading ladies.

1031739,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B000K7VHNW,Wm19,"[22, 27]","If you like action movies with comedy, you'll like this.  I liked Salma Hayek's performance in Ugly Betty, so I picked this up at the video store.  It's basically a cowboy movie set in Mexico, with Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz as the partner cowboys robbing banks to save their people.  I thought the action and comedy were really well done.  Salma Hayek is a rich heiress, newly returned from a European education to her banker father's Mexican home.  Penelope Cruz is a Mexican farm girl with an affinity for horses and guns. Some bad guys come into the story and force the farmers to sell their farms for 1 peso, or be shot (or both).  Salma and Penelope's fathers get murdered/injured by the bad guys and the two ladies go on the road for some revenge.  They rob the bad guy's banks and give the money to support the displaced Mexican people.  Salma and Penelope get training in bank robbing, come up with some hilarious schemes to rob armed banks, and even get the crime scene investigator to help them rob banks.  The story is set in a beautiful Mexican (I think it's actually shot entirely in Mexico) landscape where the people are good and honest, and the bad guys are out to swindle them.  Salma and Penelope, needless to say, are beautiful and hilarious.  Their outfits are particularly attractive and they have some great comedic stunts.  There's one part that's probably not suitable for children though - at one point the two ladies dress up in brothel dance outfits and take scandalous photos with a unclothed bound man (for purely blackmail purposes).  There's a cute dog, a smart horse who can even go up ladders, and lots of beautiful shots of scenery, horses and great music.  The movie has a lot of slapstick comedy, two heart-of-gold heroines who bicker with each other, and enough action (gunfights, explosions and horse riding) to keep my husband happy.
