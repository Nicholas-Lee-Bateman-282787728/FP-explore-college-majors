I was rather pleased about this movie because it couldn't be taken seriously. It's funny because it's silly, not because it was clever comedy, and it wasn't just about topless women.

It speaks to a  time when the point was to come up with a plausible reason for women to  expose their breasts. This film overcomes that particular obstacle by  putting the women in college sororities who then take each other on.  Consequently there is the deep and meaningful message that we should all be  more accepting of each other, and especially of women with large breasts.In other words, this is not a date movie.  This is not really a movie  for people who have a realistic chance of going out on a date.  This is not  a great film, but for this particular genre it is certainly fun and if you  are sober you will get quite a few laughs and not all of them at the  expense of Danny Bonaduce.  It has a warm spot in my heart because this was  the film that introduced me to the skin flick genere on late night HBO.  Not that I can see me telling the grandkids about it someday.Yes, I  remember seeing this movie on &quot;Up All Night&quot; and watched simply  to see what they would do with the film's climax, the strip-touch-football  game.  You have to wonder about the thinking behind the fact that they shot  the final scenes twice, once with tops and once withouts.
