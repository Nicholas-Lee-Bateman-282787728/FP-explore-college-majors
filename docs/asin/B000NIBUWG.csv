Beautiful Angie Dickenson, in her film debut, gives an above average performance. Cast contains several fine character actors familiar to TV audiences of the 50's and 60's. A great baby boomer nostalgia piece.",4,Gun the Man Down,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,318,"['Above', 'average', 'western', 'are', 'James', 'Arness', 'fan', 'am', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Beautiful', 'Angie', 'Dickenson', 'film', 'debut', 'above', 'average', 'performance', 'Cast', 'several', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'familiar', 'TV', 'audiences', '50', '60', 'great', 'baby', 'boomer', 'piece']",Gun the Man Down
1056675,A22U5T9Q0GI5GV,B000NIBUWG,"Bill Bickley ""Brown Dirt Cowboy""","[2, 2]",This role is a departure for James Arness and bears no resemblance to his Matt Dillion Character.  He plays an outlaw in love with Angie Dickinson (who isn't?).  He is shot during a robbery and is deserted by his two partners and Dickinson.  He is caught by the authorities and won't give up the other members of the gang.  He is sent to prison and when he gets out he goes after the other members of the gang who got away with the money.  The story gets really interesting when he arrives in the town where they now run a saloon.  Two of the gang members wind up dead and not by Arness' hand.  He captures the third and turns him over to the local sheriff.  The most interesting part of the film for me is the changes that Arness' character goes through during the film.  He turns out to be a really good guy.  I love James Arness and if you do then this Western is a must have for your collection.  I give this my highest recommendation.,5,Love James Arness,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,939,"['role', 'departure', 'James', 'Arness', 'resemblance', 'Matt', 'Dillion', 'Character', 'outlaw', 'love', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'who', ""n't"", 'shot', 'robbery', 'deserted', 'two', 'partners', 'Dickinson', 'caught', 'authorities', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'other', 'members', 'gang', 'sent', 'prison', 'when', 'out', 'other', 'members', 'gang', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'money', 'story', 'really', 'interesting', 'when', 'town', 'where', 'now', 'run', 'saloon', 'Two', 'gang', 'members', 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'not', 'Arness', 'hand', 'third', 'local', 'sheriff', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'changes', 'Arness', 'character', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'guy', 'love', 'James', 'Arness', 'do', 'then', 'Western', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation']",Gun the Man Down

It stars the great  James Arness, Angie Dickinson(debut role and a great beauty)Robert Wilkie,Don Megowan and Harry Carey,Jr. Arness,Wilke, and Megowan appear again together a few years later in a wonderful GUNSMOKE episode called ""BIG TOM"". This movie's screenplay is by Burt Kennedy. The Director is Andrew Mclaglen. The movie was made by Batjac Productions,which was owned by John Wayne and family. The Executive producer was Robert E. Morrison( Wayne's real last name).Also  there are several character actors in the cast who appeared with John Wayne in RIO BRAVO,1959,(especially Dickinson). With McLaglen's guiding hand,the movie supports Arness' character Rem Anderson in a sympathetic manner his participating in a big bank robbery. Although Arness was playing a bandit and gunslinger, you can see the fine touches of the decency, integrity and fairplay ethics  of Matt Dillon that many of us admire in the character evolve.This story could be an excellent backstory for how Matt Dillon became a lawman and answer questions about how he came to be as he was, the GUNSMOKE Radio Series, not withstanding. The movie debuted in 1956 and GUNSMOKE debuted on television in 1955,with that famous introduction of James Arness by John Wayne. The movie may have been in the can and they may waited until after Gunsmoke had been on for awhile prior to its release, just speculation. In the movie you do see that Rem is riding a similar looking horse to the one  that Matt rides, and during the second half of the movie Rem is dressed like Marshal Dillon,six-gun and all.  Those of us who grew up with James Arness came to believe that he was Matt Dillon and  we love the show because of the stories, scripts,writers,actors,and wonderful directors like Andrew Mclaglen,Harry Harris,Jesse Hibbs,Sam Peckinpah and the producers maintained the continuity of characters for over  20 years.I recently ordered this movie from Amazon and I thoroughly enjoyed it.it is a minor classic.",4,Old Western Worth  Owning,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,2254,"['enjoy', 'old', 'school', 'American', 'values', 'western', 'conflicted', 'justified', 'revenge', 'hunt', 'down', 'greedy', 'self-centered', 'betrayers', 'simple', 'ultimate', 'resolution', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'friend', 'partner', 'then', 'Gun', 'Man', 'Down', '1956', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'James', 'Arness', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'debut', 'role', 'great', 'beauty', 'Robert', 'Wilkie', 'Don', 'Megowan', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'Arness', 'Wilke', 'Megowan', 'appear', 'again', 'together', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'wonderful', 'GUNSMOKE', 'episode', 'called', 'BIG', 'TOM', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Mclaglen', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Batjac', 'Productions', 'was', 'owned', 'John', 'Wayne', 'family', 'Executive', 'producer', 'was', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Morrison', 'Wayne', 'real', 'last', 'name', '.Also', 'are', 'several', 'character', 'actors', 'cast', 'who', 'appeared', 'John', 'Wayne', 'RIO', 'BRAVO,1959', 'especially', 'Dickinson', 'McLaglen', 'guiding', 'hand', 'movie', 'Arness', 'character', 'Rem', 'Anderson', 'sympathetic', 'manner', 'participating', 'big', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Arness', 'was', 'playing', 'bandit', 'gunslinger', 'can', 'see', 'fine', 'touches', 'decency', 'integrity', 'fairplay', 'ethics', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'many', 'admire', 'character', 'evolve.This', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'excellent', 'backstory', 'how', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'became', 'lawman', 'answer', 'questions', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'was', 'GUNSMOKE', 'Radio', 'Series', 'not', 'withstanding', 'movie', 'debuted', '1956', 'GUNSMOKE', 'debuted', 'television', '1955', 'famous', 'introduction', 'James', 'Arness', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'may', 'waited', 'Gunsmoke', 'had', 'been', 'awhile', 'prior', 'release', 'just', 'speculation', 'movie', 'do', 'see', 'Rem', 'riding', 'similar', 'looking', 'horse', 'one', 'Matt', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Rem', 'dressed', 'Marshal', 'Dillon', 'six-gun', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'James', 'Arness', 'came', 'believe', 'was', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'love', 'show', 'stories', 'scripts', 'writers', 'actors', 'wonderful', 'directors', 'Andrew', 'Mclaglen', 'Harry', 'Harris', 'Jesse', 'Hibbs', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'producers', 'maintained', 'continuity', 'characters', '20', 'years.I', 'recently', 'ordered', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'it.it', 'minor', 'classic']",Gun the Man Down

This could have been cut down to 50minutes and played on TV and still would have  been cliche riddled and boring but acceptable.

1056682,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B000NIBUWG,Strawgold,"[1, 1]","The title of this film was so cheesy that I almost skipped by it when I was searching for a worthwhile Western awhile back.  It's in black and white, but for an older western movie, it's better than average, in my opinion.  The dialogue was good and mostly believable, which was one of the things I liked most about it.  James Arness was never much of an actor in my opinion, even though I liked him and watched Gunsmoke often.  But he looked the part and cowpokes weren't very expressive in real life anyway, so that worked for me.A lot of it is the usual:  a good man needing money; signs on for a bank heist deal destined to go bad; then they are on the run, one wounded (Arness) that will slow the others down so they leave him.  He serves his prison time for all of them as he is too hurt to run and despite his best efforts, is caught;  and the rest make their getaway good, taking Arness's girlfriend with them.  (Arness never did say what he did with his shot down girl friend after the showdown in the hills so I guess he buried her, or left her for the buzzards or something.......""But it's the dialogue and the interaction with the other characters of the film that made it interesting and watchable for me.  The laid back sheriff who tries to stay out of the sun in the far away town they all end up in, (Emile Meyer, who played Riker in ""Shane"")  his side kick deputy that doesn't add a thing to the story but has to be there for the sheriff to bounce the one liners off, and that was the best of the whole thing; the dance hall girl, played by Angie Dickinson in her introductory role; Billy the killer strolling around hunting his prey, low and tied down.For me, it was better than most of films about thousands of cavalrymen and indians attacking each other for long minutes at a stretch that was so dear to the heart of western movie directors of that era.
