431594,AGEIT17HENDIS,6304680775,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","...funny, not comic laugh funny, not joke on the street funny, but maybe just plain old ordinary human nature funny, the strangest kind, how lust for revenge, hell, let's call it by its right name, bloodlust for revenge, will twist a man or woman up inside so much they, well, they will not hesitate at the crime of crimes, murder. Take Ben Sheppard , successful California real estate developer, whose family had been in California since practically before those stinking bracero conquistador  Aztec days and he had the land grants to prove it. He had been successful beyond his wildest dreams as he hit the post-war (post- World War II to not confuse anyone on which war) California real estate god gold rush before most people could even identify that august state on a map (and given three chanced to boot).Yes, he was selling dream, California-blessed fading orange sun-sized dream of cozy little sea-side inlet bungalows and other prime new world a-borning valley housing tracts to those eager G.I.s back from the Pacific war and then welded to the California coast that they had noticed when they embarked on those leaky troop transports headed on to ancient island battlefields. To those who had prospered, war prospered, in the great okie/arkie dust bowl migration and eager to shake the dust off, the sod off, and the from hunger off with some little California modern to replace the trailer park digs. And Ben could look forward to selling, once they settled down from the boom-boom pacific coast highway chicken runs and the late night abandoned sex in their hot rods, those very sons and daughters of that eastern migration.(Ben, realistic to the core when it came to real estate, if not in other matters,  knew that he would never capture the serious white trash market, the guys and their mamas who were burning up the highways and scaring the bejesus out of honest citizens on their boom-boom-boom Harleys and Indians. He would leave that market to the stinking braceros. )  So Ben Sheppard, well respected, well- connected Ben Sheppard was on easy street.Oh sure he had had some problems like we all do. A wife, a wife who came from good old Spanish land grant family, and knew senor this and senora that, going back to Cortez and Balboa, who had run off one night with his garbacho stinking  building site foreman, some low mex batos loco as it turned out when he tried to trace  them later. Run off in one of his brand new Hudson coupes, she waving some silky mex-colored  scarf  trailing in the wind as she, half- drunk as usual, kissed him off as he watched them in the driveway of his hacienda, yelling ""Adios, gusano, adios,"" leaving him with his young daughter. His private detectives never did find her (or him) although he had them search the whole west coast and right down into fellaheen Mexico.Of course, as one would expect as that daughter, Vivian,  came of age, he had his problems with her, her and the boys, those hot rod boys who were thrilling all the young coast girls with their dare-devil antics, their golden boy good-looks and their ,ah, bedroom eyes. One incident at a LaJolla road house had cost him plenty to hush up, hush up about her age (under age for drinking) , hush up about what she was caught doing in some tar paper back lot joy shack and with whom, and hush up those guys involved too. She certainly had some of her mother' s spitfire whorish ways in her, for a while anyway, until he sent her away to school in the east. And until Jeff (played by Robert Young), his main dream house and dream California architect, caught her fancy when she came back from the east cured of her wildness. And so things stood until the war came, and Jeff was off to the Pacific.After Jeff got back from the Pacific wars they were to be married. Ben, who had treated  Jeff like a son and had pushed hard for his projects before the banks and other interested parties, was the happiest he had been had been since that whorish wife left him. Then the very night before the wedding, Jeff, Jeff drunk as a skunk had taken one of Ben's Hudson coupes, and taken his Vivian for a coast ride, a fatal, fatal to Vivian, high speed coast ride. Jeff had murdered, there was no other word for it in his mind, none, his only daughter. The cops said accident, everybody else just said it was tragic and moved on. Even Jeff was eaten up by what he done, eaten up to the core and consumed himself in work. But when a man murders, and the more Ben thought about it the more that word really was the only word for it, a man, a father if he was really a father must avenge that death, and avenge it anyway he could. And that is when he began to hatch his nefarious plots.Meanwhile Jeff, starting to have the fog lift a little from his traumatic involvement in Vivian's dead, began to have a very odd string of bad luck. A favored horse came up lame and had to be put away. A favorite dog died under mysterious circumstances, a favored rose bush too. Things, very strange things kept happening and as they did those around him began to sense that Jeff's wheels were coming off. When his house (a very Frank Lloyd Wright-ish house) nettled atop an inlet rock cove burned to the ground he almost went over the edge. And those around him looked twice when he approached them.But see not all Jeff's luck was bad, not by any means, because during this time a niece house guest of a neighbor, Ellen (played  by Betty Drake), came  his way, they fell for each other big, and she, a trained  CPA (Certified Public Accountant, no other meaning for those in steeped in cyberspace lingo) while not cooing with Jeff, stood by her man, big time as well, and helped to find out why Jeff was having some very bad days against all the laws of probability, luck- wise that is. Needless to say no CPA (remember what that means) would fall for a murderer so she/he/they began to unravel the details that led up to those pieces of bad luck. Guess who they zeroed in on. Yes, Ben. And guess what Ben found out to his misfortunate. Well I will leave that to your viewing. But here is a hint. Vivian had a little more of her mother's laughing brown eyes whore still left in her that old Ben realized. Still that revenge thing, that bloodlust revenge thing, well it was pretty strong. And has been part of the human condition for a while.",4,Gothic Modern Noir,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,6330,"['funny', 'not', 'comic', 'laugh', 'funny', 'not', 'joke', 'street', 'funny', 'maybe',

431595,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6304680775,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","This atmospheric mystery plays out like a gothic drama, the stark black and white photography of Hal Mohr and Tschaikousky's music creating a sustained mood until its satisfying conclusion. Produced by Mort Briskin and Robert Smith, who also wrote the story, it gradually pulls the viewer in deeper and deeper until we are completely immersed in the happenings.A mysterious mood is set from the very beginning with shots of the California coast and a house built on a cliff overlooking the sea called Hilltop. Betsy Drake's voice relates her fear regarding a knock on the door, then flashes back to the events leading up to it. Robert Young is an architect named Jeff who meets and charms Betsy Drake's Ellen Foster on a train bound for Pine Cliff. It is where he built Hilltop for a bride we discover died in a tragic car accident the day before their marriage. He has not been the same since, Dr. Hartley (Morris Carnovsky) stating his concern for his intermittent bouts of depression.Ellen is a sweet girl who falls for Jeff during his charming moments, sympathetic to his darker moods. He remains close to his former fiancee's father, Ben Shepard (Henry O'Neill). Keith (John Sutton) is the slimy playboy hoping to get control of old man Shepard's money while at the same time lusting after Jeff's newfound love. There is a moody atmosphere of some impending doom hanging over their romance, and as one instance of bad luck after another begins to pile up on Jeff, Ellen begins to suspect he is being given the gaslight treatment. Dr. Hartley believes however, that Jeff is displaying classic symptoms of paranoia brought on by guilt at his fiancee's death. Since it is obvious Jeff has some secret he is keeping, what is really happening remains unclear.Drake is very likable as the CPA standing by Jeff even as he pushes her away. She knows a fading painting, a dying bush, and a wounded horse are a statistical improbability; as she tells Jeff, ""Your bad luck, Jeff, it's a little too bad to be true."" But when helping him puts her in danger also, perhaps even from himself, he hatches a dangerous plan to draw out the truth about what really has been going on. There is a sort of realism to their romance, a maturity that seems fresh for this time period.What it lacks in excitement it makes up for in an involving psychological drama which glues the viewer to the screen. Director James V. Kern's film may be less heralded than others made earlier in the cycle, but makes a nice one for a Saturday morning or late at night. Robert Young and Betsy Drake make a nice couple in a forgotten little gem which deserves a second look.",5,Engrossing Psychological Mystery,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,2636,"['atmospheric', 'mystery', 'out', 'gothic', 'drama', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'Hal', 'Mohr', 'Tschaikousky', 'music', 'creating', 'sustained', 'mood', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Produced', 'Mort', 'Briskin', 'Robert', 'Smith', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'story', 'gradually', 'viewer', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'are', 'completely', 'immersed', 'happenings.A', 'mysterious', 'mood', 'set', 'very', 'beginning', 'shots', 'California', 'coast', 'house', 'built', 'cliff', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'called', 'Hilltop', 'Betsy', 'Drake', 'voice', 'fear', 'regarding', 'knock', 'door', 'then', 'back', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Robert', 'Young', 'architect', 'named', 'Jeff', 'who', 'charms', 'Betsy', 'Drake', 'Ellen', 'Foster', 'train', 'bound', 'Pine', 'Cliff', 'where', 'built', 'Hilltop', 'bride', 'discover', 'died', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'day', 'marriage', 'not', 'been', 'same', 'Dr.', 'Hartley', 'Morris', 'Carnovsky', 'stating', 'concern', 'intermittent', 'bouts', 'depression.Ellen', 'sweet', 'girl', 'who', 'Jeff', 'charming', 'moments', 'sympathetic', 'darker', 'moods', 'close', 'former', 'fiancee', 'father', 'Ben', 'Shepard', 'Henry', ""O'Neill"", 'Keith', 'John', 'Sutton', 'slimy', 'playboy', 'hoping', 'get', 'control', 'old', 'man', 'Shepard', 'money', 'same', 'time', 'lusting', 'Jeff', 'newfound', 'love', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'impending', 'doom', 'hanging', 'over', 'romance', 'one', 'instance', 'bad', 'luck', 'pile', 'up', 'Jeff', 'Ellen', 'suspect', 'being', 'given', 'gaslight', 'treatment', 'Dr.', 'Hartley', 'however', 'Jeff', 'displaying', 'classic', 'symptoms', 'paranoia', 'brought', 'guilt', 'fiancee', 'death', 'obvious', 'Jeff', 'secret', 'keeping', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'remains', 'unclear.Drake', 'very', 'likable', 'CPA', 'standing', 'Jeff', 'even', 'away', 'fading', 'painting', 'dying', 'bush', 'wounded', 'horse', 'are', 'statistical', 'improbability', 'Jeff', 'bad', 'luck', 'Jeff', 'little', 'too', 'bad', 'be', 'true', 'when', 'helping', 'danger', 'also', 'perhaps', 'even', 'dangerous', 'plan', 'draw', 'out', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'been', 'going', 'sort', 'realism', 'romance', 'maturity', 'fresh', 'time', 'excitement', 'up', 'involving', 'psychological', 'drama', 'viewer', 'screen', 'Director', 'James', 'V.', 'Kern', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'heralded', 'others', 'made', 'earlier', 'cycle', 'nice', 'one', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'late', 'night', 'Robert', 'Young', 'Betsy', 'Drake', 'make', 'nice', 'couple', 'forgotten', 'little', 'gem', 'second', 'look']",The Second Woman Vol. 6 Hollywood Noir  VHS
431596,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6304680775,C. O. DeRiemer,"[12, 12]","""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again..."" Wait, wrong movie. ""Today,"" Ellen Foster tells us, ""I looked upon the cliff where Hilltop stood. I can still see its hanging roofs against the cyprus trees. But Hilltop is no more. There is only a scar of jutting rock where once its windows glittered in the California sun."" The Second Woman, starring Robert Young and Betsy Drake, may be no Rebecca but it is a tidy, effective mystery worth watching. You can be sure it will never be shown in college film studies classes, which is a shame. It's a solid example of the kind of professional, commercial movies Hollywood still was turning out even as the studios crumbled and public taste was changing.In the wealthy coastal town of Pine Cliff, where the privileged many spend Friday and Saturday evenings at the Country Club, there is concern about Jeff Cohalan. He's an architect who seems to be going off the rails. His fianc&eacute;e, Virginia Sheppard, died months ago in a car crash the night before they were to be married. It was going to be the perfect marriage. Virginia's wealthy father, Ben, was almost like a father over the years to Cohalan. Jeff is well liked and has the sympathy of many, including Amelia Foster, an older woman who lives next to Hilltop, Jeff's home that he designed. But it's not long after Ellen Foster, Amelia's young niece, comes to visit her that Jeff's apparent paranoia begins to grow into something dangerous. Ellen meets and is attracted to Jeff, but he seems emotionally tied to the memory of Virginia Sheppard. Lurking around is Keith Ferris (John Sutton) who works for Ben, resents Jeff and also is a member of Pine Cliff's privileged class. That he is a cad is apparent from the nasty condescension he gives everything he says. That he dislikes Jeff is as obvious as his little black moustache.Unusual in a heroine, perhaps, Ellen is a certified public accountant, a specialist in compiling actuarial tables for an insurance company. She not only can add, she can put two and two together. When Ellen sees things happening to Jeff -- a rosebush dying, a portrait fading, architectural plans lost, a small sculpture broken, a horse with a leg broken, a dog dying, and then Hilltop burning - she knows paranoia doesn't enter into it. She also knows the probability of coincidence is astronomical. She doesn't for a minute believe Jeff has been causing these things. While Jeff seems to dither and slide into depression, Ellen disregards his wish that she drop any investigation. On her own, she sets out to research these occurrences. It's not long before we realize with pleasure just how smart Ellen is. It's just as satisfying near the end when we learn Jeff is just as smart as Ellen.The Second Woman would be a much stronger movie, however, if the two leads were more dynamic. Betsy Drake was an attractive actress, wholesome and sympathetic, but she was as bland as milk. Robert Young was a fine actor with plenty of assurance and authority, but to my thinking he lacked that inner energy that draws you to a lead actor. Between the two of them, they just don't give the movie enough tension. John Sutton, in an odd way, provides the slight of hand that makes the movie fun. Sutton specialized in absolutely oily, reprehensible, over-civilized, effete heels. He has only to appear on the screen in any movie and we say to ourselves, ""Ah ha, there's the villain."" And he usually was. When we realize a third of the way through that he might be the villain but that he just might not be, I had to smile at how the movie used his style to possibly mislead me.For a public domain film, the Alpha Video DVD transfer isn't all that bad.
