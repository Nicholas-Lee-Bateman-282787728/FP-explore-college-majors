Either way they managed to steal 43 minutes from me.This is not an all night show. He doesn't have the time to wind up to the big grand slam. He needs to come out with both guns loaded and blazing. He does pretty much the opposite. He takes some not very funny material and tries to milk it which does little more than underline how unfunny the material is. The slow pacing and laconic delivery urged me to start looking at my watch which is not the right response to stand up comedy.In all fairness he did have a couple of good bits about his young son's fascination for his ""ting ting"" and another about female genitalia but it simply wasn't enough to pull this out of the doldrums. I understand he's supposed to be a funny guy but there is no way you could tell so from this performance.",1,"Go Ahead, Make Him Angry",1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,905,"['Netflix', 'gave', 'rave', 'marketing', 'staff', 'was', 'writing', 'Jo', 'Koy', 'friends', 'were', 'way', 'managed', 'steal', '43', 'minutes', 'me.This', 'not', 'night', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'wind', 'up', 'big', 'grand', 'slam', 'come', 'out', 'guns', 'loaded', 'blazing', 'pretty', 'much', 'opposite', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'material', 'tries', 'milk', 'little', 'more', 'underline', 'how', 'unfunny', 'material', 'slow', 'pacing', 'laconic', 'delivery', 'urged', 'start', 'looking', 'watch', 'not', 'right', 'response', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy.In', 'fairness', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'good', 'bits', 'young', 'son', 'fascination', 'ting', 'ting', 'female', 'genitalia', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'pull', 'doldrums', 'understand', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'guy', 'way', 'could', 'tell', 'so', 'performance']",Jo Koy: Don't Make Him Angry

His facial expressions ALONE can get you rolling with laughter! His impersonations of his son (and mom) are ri-di-cu-LOUS!! He tells it like he felt it, sharing personal, private stories about his relationship he has with his SON (and mom)! Does an incredible job of relaying his message so we &#34;feel his pain&#34;! ROFL!!!  THIS is the one that has the story about his son's &#34;ting-ting&#34;! Oh my!The seller sent my purchase right on time and in excellent condition!
