Hauser""","[2, 2]","Okay, I'm not sure why these attractive women put on their most stylish outfits and highest heels to go stalking around the woods and rocky shoreline, but thank you.  Set somewhere remote in Britain, this is long on atmospherics and low on story, with a decent dose of nudity, thanks again.  There's some alien probing and a creepy guy in a suit more out of Dawn of the Dead than Men in Black, plus a black slime that seems to mark the victims of extraterrestrial interference.  All very entertaining to watch, if not understand.  A few borrowed pieces from 2001: A Space Odyssey help, and I enjoyed the surrealistic black and white footage.  The black man, (who's the man in black), heralds the coming doom which involves a black, tar-like slime covering the women's bodies.  What that means is anybody's guess, but it seems to work for the film.  Better acting than most exploitation films sets this one apart.
