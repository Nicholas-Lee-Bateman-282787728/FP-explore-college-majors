1251322,A37EFTIQYBKOGW,B00267QOI2,"David Giaimo ""gadget enthusiast""","[0, 0]","We acquired this DVD at the Japanese department store in Epcot at DisneyWorld in Orlando. It was $15.99, and is worth every penny - not only will you find many hilarious episodes of Domo and his friends cavorting in their usual style, but included with the bonus content there are the winning submissions from the Domo Animation Contest - people from all over Japan created their OWN Domo adventures - and many of those are as funny, if not funnier, than some of Domo's professionally written and scripted jaunts.  In short, if you are a fan of this sort of thing, you will be hard-pressed not to enjoy every minute of this DVD. My son and I watched it all the way through -- twice -- and still plan to watch it again soon.  Order it while it is still available, and ensure yourself many enjoyable evenings of laughs!",5,"Domo!

He's an adorable little creature with fuzzy brown fur and a giant toothy mouth that never closes.And this strange little Japanese mascot has become so popular (both in Japan and the US) that he even got his own TV show -- a series of stop-motion shorts chronicling his adventures with his woodland friends. These stories are a little strange at times (Americans may not know what a shapeshifting tanuki is), but they have an innocently odd charm that never ceases.In these stories, Domo roams around photographing the world, tries to climb the highest tree, chases a smiling balloon that has escaped him, uses headphones to hear the ""music"" of the world, plays with a bunch of melodious mushrooms, chases a robot dog, gets chased by a hungry bear, and plays in a rock band that is struck by lightning.Some of his adventures involve his friends as well -- he goes ice-skating and pursues a giant fish, encounters a shapeshifting tanuki that pretends to be him, tries to understand sibling dynamics, plays at ""going to work,"" and attempts to have a secret hide-out... until people find out about it.Each of the ""Domo"" episodes is only about a minute and a half long, but the animators manage to make each a self-contained story. This is partly because the stories are so simple -- usually it involves Domo stumbling across something strange and new to him, or trying to accomplish something despite the odds. There's not a lot of dialogue (Domo only says ""DO-MO!""), and a few don't really have dialogue at all.Perhaps this simplicity is what makes the Domo shorts as charming as they are. Domo acts like a little kid, dancing to musical mushrooms, ice-skating after fish, pretending to make business calls, and photographing all sorts of things (including ghosts). The only problem is that a few things about it might not immediately make sense to Americans -- one episode is about a shapeshifting tanuki, but it never appears as itself.Domo himself is an adorable character, sort of like a little kid --  curious, eager, and sometimes oblivious to how other people feel. The other characters are ""normal"" counterparts to Domo (an elderly rabbit, a flighty weasel and a family of stoned foxes) but none of them have the charm and weirdness of the titular character. Oh, and there are kissing snakes and a pair of talking bats.""Domo"" is very brief, but it's also quite charming, cute, and strangely childlike. And it has Domo.

I've watched some episodes on YouTube and even though I couldn't understand a word they were saying, that didn't stop it from being funny. I figured for $5, I didn't have much to lose.I'm glad I made the purchase. Although the episodes are short, they're completely worth the money.

1251326,A2PY5U9IUILU9W,B00267QOI2,"T. LaPonte ""mo""","[13, 15]","As far as value goes, this DVD does not have a lot of content for the price.  The English dubbed main video shorts comprise, even when watching each opening and closing (which play before and after each short), only about a half an hour long.  The extras push the time closer to the hour mark (though the original NHK shorts that are included have their dubbed audio removed and contain no subtitles), but for the price of the DVD (set at 14.99 MSRP), I would expect a bit more.  The domo-textured slip-cover that the DVD comes in is nice, but it doesn't exactly add value to the release.That aside, Domo, even for casual fans, is fantastically entertaining.  I brought this DVD to work to watch during lunch and it was a hit with everyone.  Even the people who shook their heads in disbelief still laughed and smiled at the simple and seemingly non sequitur humor.The stories are clearly designed to appeal to young children, but there is still entertainment value there for everyone, even those in their teens and twenties (or even older).  You can watch this DVD with your kids, with your parents, with your friends, with your coworkers; anyone.  It's light and comical and just as funny on a second or third viewing as on the first.  Each short runs under five minutes, making them easy to watch in short bursts of one or to at a time or plow through all at once.The stop-motion animation quality is top-notch.  This wasn't thrown together to make a quick buck.  The Japanese studio that created the original NHK television station spots (where Domo came from) also created the shorts on this DVD.The opening song, seemingly written for the English language release, is catchy.  It's too short to get annoying, even after hearing it a dozen times throughout the DVD, and is easy to learn, as it contains only one word: ""domo.""In all, this DVD is worth buying for any hardcore Domo fan.  For the casual fan, you might want to find it at a discount, buy it used, or rent it, as the sticker price is a little high for so little content.  The front of the DVD claims that this is ""volume 1,"" so we can expect more, probably comparable, releases of Domo in the future as well.",4,Hilarious.,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,2175,"['As', 'far', 'value', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'content', 'price', 'English', 'dubbed', 'main', 'video', 'shorts', 'comprise', 'even', 'when', 'watching', 'opening', 'closing', 'play', 'short', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'extras', 'push', 'time', 'closer', 'hour', 'mark', 'original', 'NHK', 'shorts', 'are', 'included', 'have', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'removed', 'contain', 'subtitles', 'price', 'DVD', 'set', '14.99', 'MSRP', 'would', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'domo-textured', 'slip-cover', 'DVD', 'nice', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'add', 'value', 'release.That', 'aside', 'Domo', 'even', 'casual', 'fans', 'fantastically', 'entertaining', 'brought', 'DVD', 'work', 'watch', 'lunch', 'was', 'hit', 'everyone', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'shook', 'heads', 'disbelief', 'still', 'laughed', 'smiled', 'simple', 'seemingly', 'non', 'sequitur', 'humor.The', 'stories', 'are', 'clearly', 'designed', 'appeal', 'young', 'children', 'still', 'entertainment', 'value', 'there', 'everyone', 'even', 'teens', 'twenties', 'even', 'older', 'can', 'watch', 'DVD', 'kids', 'parents', 'friends', 'coworkers', 'anyone', 'light', 'comical', 'just', 'funny', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'first', 'short', 'runs', 'five', 'minutes', 'making', 'easy', 'watch', 'short', 'bursts', 'one', 'time', 'plow', 'once.The', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'quality', 'top-notch', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'together', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'Japanese', 'studio', 'created', 'original', 'NHK', 'television', 'station', 'spots', 'where', 'Domo', 'came', 'also', 'created', 'shorts', 'DVD.The', 'opening', 'song', 'seemingly', 'written', 'English', 'language', 'release', 'catchy', 'too', 'short', 'get', 'annoying', 'even', 'hearing', 'dozen', 'times', 'DVD', 'easy', 'learn', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'domo', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'hardcore', 'Domo', 'fan', 'casual', 'fan', 'might', 'want', 'find', 'discount', 'buy', 'used', 'rent', 'sticker', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'so', 'little', 'content', 'front', 'DVD', 'volume', '1', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'probably', 'comparable', 'releases', 'Domo', 'future', 'well']",Domo
