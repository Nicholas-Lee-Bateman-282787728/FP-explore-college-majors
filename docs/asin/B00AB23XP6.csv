This movie started off with a great idea and attention getter: the Earth is missing and there are only three guys left. One of the tough, war/battle-hardened soldiers somehow transforms into a woman. I could have forgiven the fact that this guy becomes a too-thin (conservation of mass, anyone??) woman who already has highlights (check the eyebrows for comparison), lipstick, mascara, foundation, and long, shapely nails the moment she gets up from transformation. Why did they make her so incredibly (and suddenly) weak and helpless?? A trained military/paramilitary commando should retain some knowledge of how to fight, be independent, and solve problems rather than depending on the &#34;big strong&#34; men around her. &#34;He&#34; adapts to being a chick WAY too fast for my tastes.

1607506,A3GSGBKCIXB45A,B00AB23XP6,Eddie B.,"[5, 7]","I'm surprised at all the hate &#34;Paradox Alice&#34; is receiving. Last night I was looking for a good sci fi flick to watch. I will literally watch anything, old or new, in the sci fi department. In this day and age, sometimes we get the golden ticket of movies like &#34;Sunshine&#34; or &#34;Moon&#34; in the sci fi department. Some sci fi movies, although not a massive hit in the box office, end up being a pretty damn good flick with decent CGI and a telling story behind them.That's where I ran across &#34;Paradox Alice&#34;.The premise of the movie sounded interesting so I gave it a try. Be forewarned; at first glance, this movie looks awful. The CGI is absolutely horrendous, especially for a 2013 film. This movie looks like something a high school student learning &#34;Blender&#34; (open source 3D software) threw together in a month. The planets look terrible, the space scenes are dull, and overall the visual effects are downright pathetic. Lastly, the first 20 minutes of the film are pretty painful. But then things start to get better...We discover that planet Earth is gone and the people aboard the ship are the only humans left. Soon one of them mystically transforms into a woman. Deep under the broken CGI and poor scientific facts is an interesting, albeit weird story about humanity. What would happen if you were one of only three humans left? Would you want to carry on the species of the human race by procreating? This movie had some thought-provoking parts of it.Although this movie has a very unknown list of actors, their performances were pretty good, including that of Jeneta St. Clair (best known from &#34;Barely Legal&#34;). She really kept the movie together and brought some real magic to the screen. There were some fine close ups and engaging dialog between characters at times as well. And although most of the CGI was bad, the set design wasn't too bad (even though most of it didn't make sense for a spaceship).The storyline was a bit all over the place, the CGI was awful, and there are alot of weak spots in this movie. The pacing of certain events were also awful... but overall I enjoyed it for it's good parts. With that being said, this is a very hard movie to sell; if you are not a die-hard science fiction fan and can't stand budget-end special effects/CGI, you should absolutely pass on this movie. I watch everything from even movies in the 1950's despite the lack of special effects. But if your not that kind of sci fi fan, you may want to pass. Otherwise try it out, it's just a movie and you may end up liking it. With that being said, would it have killed them to get someone better for the CGI in this film? I mean, they absolutely awful! If it weren't for the sloppy CGI, this film might have been a little better for the general audiences.",4,Underneath the ugly CGI is actually a decent Sci Fi movie,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2806,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'hate', '34', 'Paradox', 'Alice', '34', 'receiving', 'Last', 'night', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'sci', 'fi', 'flick', 'watch', 'will', 'literally', 'watch', 'anything', 'old', 'new', 'sci', 'fi', 'department', 'day', 'age', 'sometimes', 'get', 'golden', 'ticket', 'movies', '34', 'Sunshine', '34', '34', 'Moon', '34', 'sci', 'fi', 'department', 'sci', 'fi', 'movies', 'not', 'massive', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'flick', 'decent', 'CGI', 'telling', 'story', 'them.That', 'where', 'ran', '34', 'Paradox', 'Alice', '34', '.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'so', 'gave', 'try', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'first', 'glance', 'movie', 'awful', 'CGI', 'absolutely', 'horrendous', 'especially', '2013', 'film', 'movie', 'something', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'learning', '34', 'Blender', '34', 'open', 'source', '3D', 'software', 'threw', 'together', 'month', 'planets', 'look', 'terrible', 'space', 'scenes', 'are', 'dull', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'downright', 'pathetic', 'Lastly', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'painful', 'then', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'better', 'discover', 'planet', 'Earth', 'gone', 'people', 'ship', 'are', 'only', 'humans', 'left', 'Soon', 'one', 'mystically', 'woman', 'Deep', 'broken', 'CGI', 'poor', 'scientific', 'facts', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'weird', 'story', 'humanity', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'were', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'humans', 'left', 'Would', 'want', 'carry', 'species', 'human', 'race', 'procreating', 'movie', 'had', 'thought-provoking', 'parts', 'it.Although', 'movie', 'very', 'unknown', 'list', 'actors', 'performances', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'including', 'Jeneta', 'St.', 'Clair', 'best', 'known', '34', 'Barely', 'Legal', '34', 'really', 'kept', 'movie', 'together', 'brought', 'real', 'magic', 'screen', 'were', 'fine', 'close', 'ups', 'engaging', 'dialog', 'characters', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'CGI', 'was', 'bad', 'set', 'design', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'even', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'spaceship', '.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'place', 'CGI', 'was', 'awful', 'are', 'alot', 'weak', 'spots', 'movie', 'pacing', 'certain', 'events', 'were', 'also', 'awful', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'parts', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'hard', 'movie', 'sell', 'are', 'not', 'die-hard', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'budget-end', 'special', 'effects/CGI', 'should', 'absolutely', 'pass', 'movie', 'watch', 'everything', 'even', 'movies', '1950', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'kind', 'sci', 'fi', 'fan', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'Otherwise', 'try', 'out', 'just', 'movie', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'get', 'someone', 'better', 'CGI', 'film', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'were', ""n't"", 'sloppy', 'CGI', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'general', 'audiences']",N/A

But under any other circumstances skip it. The acting is awful. The premise is mind-blowingly stupid: Earth's water is all ""toxic"" (whatever that means) and so just one single space ship with a crew of 4 is sent all the way to a moon of Jupiter to collect about 4 ocean-tankers worth of water.But then this weirdly dumb premise turns out to be irrelevant and really could have been anything, because when the ship returns, the earth has been ""destroyed"", although we, and the crew, never actually see the earth, implying the whole planet is simply disappeared due to something that is unclear but has to do with ""nuclear stockpiles"". (Surely the producers of this film aren't dumb enough to suggest that all the earth's nuclear bombs going off would somehow vaporize the planet?...and damage the moon in the process!)But I did learn startling new facts about female anatomy during the transformation scene. For example, that women's fingernails are longer than men's, not because women simply let them grow longer like I mistakenly thought, but because it's somehow genetic, as is that they naturally appear with a french manicure. Similarly, red lipstick is apparently part of the female genome. And here I always thought women had to buy it and apply it.

1607513,A3FWHXSZSTKFIU,B00AB23XP6,Scott Woods,"[4, 5]","I'm occasionally willing to endure mediocre effects, bad acting and subpar writing in a film that's camp or not taking itself too seriously. This film isn't one of those films. This film thought it was a real film and just turned out horrendously bad.The premise was intriguing enough to get me to at least consider it: three men in space head home to Earth only to find it destroyed. Upon discovering that they are the last three humans alive, one of them spontaneously transforms into a woman, presumably to propagate the species. I'm not sure which paradox the title is referring to - that one of them becomes a woman is more of a mystery than a paradox - but I found myself asking questions every two minutes as this rollercoaster of idiocy and ham-handedness barreled on (spoilers, assuming you can spoil a film this godawful), but mostly of the &#34;Are you kidding?&#34; variety: the newly breasted space jockey's name is &#34;Fox&#34;, he immediately begins to run around the ship in nothing more than a sports bra, despite being &#34;cold all of the time&#34; because he's &#34;frail now,&#34; except for the times when he's sporting a lovely pink robe and a French manicure. Naturally the remaining two crew members vacillate between rapey and creepy, both of whom seem way more horny than bothered by the fact that every person and thing they've ever known was bombed to space dust. In an attempt to add a fourth character where three would do, we're given a HAL-inspired ship's computer that can demote personnel and control the ship's environments and doors, but can't keep a stalking rapist away from mankind's last hope. Given that the computer is personified by a rejected Johnny 5 prototype that shakes like a Muppet when it speaks so we know where the voice is coming from, it's no wonder it's useless.This is easily the most sexist sci-fi film I've ever seen, and I'm not generally predisposed to dismiss something on that factor alone.

I was really drawn in by the unique story, themes and premise.  A lot of really uncharted territory in this movie.  Get a sense some of the reviewers here want 'Gravity' like production values and a few reviews that seem quite hateful and bigoted - which isn't a surprise considering the subject matter.  If you want action porn with $200 million dollar budget - skip 'Paradox Alice'.  It's not fast food.  It's a fine wine.

1607517,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B00AB23XP6,T. Briggs,"[3, 4]","This is the worst movie I've ever enjoyed.  Imagine some high school kids learned the word protandry in biology class that day and later that night drank a gallon of Boone's Farm and started &#34;what if&#34;-ing.....how long would it take until you came up with a script in which they figured out how to have gay sex by turning the hot guy into a hot chick whose sole purpose is to work with the first two to repopulate the human race somewhere?You know it's going to be bad on every level possible and for such an infinite variety of reasons when you see the fish bowl on the spacecraft.  So here's it is - 2 guy astronauts, 1 nerd evangelical and one actual girl astronaut are trying to save earth which is ravaging itself over water and other resources.  Long story short.  They go into &#34;stasis&#34; to return to earth and are awakened 2 hours out in the middle of a debris field which is, apparently, what's left of the moon.  Earth has self destructed.The real girl astronaut dies (because god forbid that would make rebuilding the human race too effing easy) so we have a situation where there is still the one hot guy astronaut, the 2nd astronaut who started out as captain but was demoted by female Hal robot, sigh, and the boy evangelical astronaut who has the gold fish - a bowl with 3 males because, as he says, throw a female in and they all kill themselves...double sigh.......so now we have 3 dudes coming to terms with the fact that the human race is dead - church boy knows god will save them and well dontcha know the hot dude astronaut transforms, all alienlike, into a woman just like protandry specifies.  So Alex becomes Alice, who by the way is still captain thanks to lady Hal.  The believer astronaut gets creepier and creepier and the creepy ex captain becomes less creepy....so any one piece sucks...but put them all together and after you've said WTF - dismissed the absolutely cheesie special effects and the worst set design you've ever seen our born again dork hatches his evil plan to &#34;have' Alice.  Then of course you have to work in a scene where &#34;eve&#34; has an apple, says she's never had it before followed by a dreamy banana eating sequence which ends with creepy captain hitting on his ex-friend but she's all like &#34;I'm so confused&#34;........sigh.....where's our evil evangelical?  he's up to no good but the fish are fine, though now they're down to 2 because one has died.  Queue required nightmare montage so hot sexy actress astronaut can wake up all sweaty and glistening and watch how she learns to put on her makeup and do her nails because that's something all astronauts need to do ..... then our creepy believer dude shows his true colors ... he's God's prophet and she belongs to him and .........and the weirdest thing is that she looks so much like Marsha Brady.  ....none of this can end well and it doesn't.....and all of this makes so much sense because, you know, when you're in the middle of the apocalypse a little Deuteronomy is never enough and gosh darn it you need a touch of Leviticus, a soupcon of insanity and you just keep watching because you know if you just pay attention you too will learn the secret of making a woman obey you even when she wants you dead....queue the 2001 space odyssey choir, watch the necessary rape scene and wait for Rosemary's baby to be born....or babies......and the final scene doesn't disappoint.  They even managed to make the final credits annoying vocally but the whole thing in its entirety actually kind of works in this most pathetic effort of wasted talent.  I counted over 20 computer graphic technicians in the credit but all they managed to come up with were Atari level effects.  But it's a holiday and I have all day to waste on this nonsense.
