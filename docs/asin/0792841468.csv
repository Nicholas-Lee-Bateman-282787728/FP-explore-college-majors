And just for fun, I watched it in Spanish with English subtitles. I understand an occasional Spanish word.I've reviewed this one before, and now I remember why I kept it. It's about a school year in the lives of some 14-year-old boys at an all-male school, and it starts out so slow that you might wonder why I was even watching it. That's called realism. You immediately get the feeling these can't be actors, just kids, and the closing credits establish that you're right. 1976, so you get to see the hair, the sideburns, the slang in the subtitles, and giggle a little. You see boys you went to school with: thieves, thugs, bullies, misfits, perverts... well, not much in the way of good boys at this school.You see the little secrets about their home lives that they keep secret. There are no sex scenes, but some boys are definitely thinking about it, and all those scenes are brilliant examples of subtle humor. Still wondering when something will happen? Oh, it will. There's a definite cumulative snowballing here that I recall mentioning in my other review. It is, quite simply, excellent, and that's why I bought a 30-year old French film in China and watched it again in Thailand. If you see it, grab it.Oh, and let me diffuse some dramatic tension right now, just in case one of my readers actually finds this thing. Nothing bad happens to the cat who falls (gets pushed) out of the window. That scene seriously messed with my head, because I couldn't remember how it ended. I could never recommend a movie where something bad happened to a cat falling out of a window. This was a good cat, too, not a brain dead Persian or anything like that.",4,A Classic,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,1764,"['cover', 'one', 'title', 'DVD', 'French', 'other', 'title', 'so', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'just', 'fun', 'watched', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'occasional', 'Spanish', 'word.I', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'one', 'before', 'now', 'remember', 'why', 'kept', 'school', 'year', 'lives', '14-year-old', 'boys', 'all-male', 'school', 'out', 'so', 'slow', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'watching', 'called', 'realism', 'immediately', 'get', 'feeling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'actors', 'just', 'kids', 'closing', 'credits', 'establish', ""'re"", 'right', '1976', 'get', 'see', 'hair', 'sideburns', 'slang', 'subtitles', 'giggle', 'little', 'see', 'went', 'school', 'thieves', 'thugs', 'bullies', 'misfits', 'perverts', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'good', 'boys', 'school.You', 'see', 'little', 'secrets', 'home', 'lives', 'keep', 'secret', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'boys', 'are', 'definitely', 'thinking', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliant', 'examples', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Still', 'wondering', 'when', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'Oh', 'will', 'definite', 'cumulative', 'snowballing', 'here', 'recall', 'mentioning', 'other', 'review', 'quite', 'simply', 'excellent', 'why', 'bought', '30-year', 'old', 'French', 'film', 'China', 'watched', 'again', 'Thailand', 'see', 'it.Oh', 'let', 'diffuse', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'case', 'one', 'readers', 'actually', 'thing', 'Nothing', 'bad', 'cat', 'who', 'pushed', 'window', 'scene', 'seriously', 'messed', 'head', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'ended', 'could', 'never', 'recommend', 'movie', 'where', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', 'cat', 'falling', 'window', 'was', 'good', 'cat', 'too', 'not', 'brain', 'dead', 'Persian', 'anything']",N/A

Sure, it shows some delightfully comedic vignettes about childhood in France (and well, really the nature of childhood), but all of those funny bits like Geoffrey a fait boum and the police chief's daughter with her megaphone &quot;j'ai faim&quot; stand in stark contrast to the outcast Julien Leclerc (please pardon me if that is not precisely his name, but I am relying on my memory on this), who lives in a run down shack on a street where people just did not live and who was regularly abused by the &quot;unseen enemy&quot; of his family members (which yes, you do see in the end).In this film we see the contrast of the innocence of childhood shattered by the heartbreak of abuse.  This was an era where child abuse was just beginning to be dealt with in the media and we see Truffaut giving us intermittent glimpses of a child on his own, finding it hard to stay awake in class because he was forced out of the house for the night, picking up coins that dropped out of people's pockets at a local carnival, and fearing taking his clothes off for the school physical because of the bruises on his body.I think we do a great disservice to the film and to Truffaut to call it a comedy.  There is so much more to it than that.",4,Not really a comedy,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,1317,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'REAL', 'point', 'movie', 'Sure', 'delightfully', 'comedic', 'vignettes', 'childhood', 'France', 'well', 'really', 'nature', 'childhood', 'funny', 'bits', 'Geoffrey', 'fait', 'boum', 'police', 'chief', 'daughter', 'megaphone', 'quot', 'faim', 'quot', 'stand', 'stark', 'contrast', 'outcast', 'Julien', 'Leclerc', 'please', 'pardon', 'not', 'precisely', 'name', 'am', 'relying', 'memory', 'who', 'run', 'down', 'shack', 'street', 'where', 'people', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'who', 'was', 'regularly', 'abused', 'quot', 'unseen', 'enemy', 'quot', 'family', 'members', 'yes', 'do', 'see', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'contrast', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'shattered', 'heartbreak', 'abuse', 'was', 'era', 'where', 'child', 'abuse', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'be', 'dealt', 'media', 'see', 'Truffaut', 'giving', 'intermittent', 'glimpses', 'child', 'own', 'finding', 'hard', 'stay', 'awake', 'class', 'was', 'forced', 'house', 'night', 'picking', 'up', 'coins', 'dropped', 'people', 'pockets', 'local', 'carnival', 'fearing', 'taking', 'clothes', 'school', 'physical', 'bruises', 'body.I', 'think', 'do', 'great', 'disservice', 'film', 'Truffaut', 'call', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

At age twelve, I was suffering from serious depression, had a horrible self esteem and was probably at the lowest point in my life ever.  This film was just the tonic I needed.  The legendary filmmaker, Francois Truffaut, made this film about life through the eyes of children, telling each story with humor, intensity and profound beauty.  This film is definitely great for anyone who has suffered childhood trauma.  It shows us that we are truly never alone when we suffer injustice, also, that laughter is a universal language we all can relate to.There are several vignettes told from the point of view of several of the young characters, but the two that stand out for me are about the little girl who claims she was abandoned and left alone in her apartment by her parents (she is actually just a spoiled brat) and proceeds to broadcast this to all of the neighbors via megaphone, and the young boy who lives in an abusive home.  These stories were touching and triumphant and they could have truly happened anywhere in the world and would still compel us as audience members.

These children will now be somewhere in their 30s and early 40s, somewhere in France, anonymous probably in their daily lives, but they will always be here, captured being kids by Truffaut in the most unobtrusive way possible.

The adults' parenting sometimes leaves the children vulnerable and which is presented in a number of troubling scenes.  Despite these perilous situations, the children survive and have to learn how to manage by themselves in order to live a happy life.  Nevertheless, the parents do offer affection and love for the children, which aids in their struggle through life.  In turn, the children also affect adult rule over them through different actions.  Truffaut displays great understanding for children through this film by creating a next to perfect dissection of child development and child psychology that psychologists such as Harlow, Vygotsky and Piaget would call &quot;a functioning experiement in action&quot;.
