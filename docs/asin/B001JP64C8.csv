I'm not sure but I think the settings are in the mid 1800's. The story is about the school head master and how the boys are affected with changes to remove the bad elements in the school. This movie is based on a true story when Tom Arnold was the head master. This a very good movie with good acting, good plot, etc... I would reccommend to anyone who enjoys good, clean movies.",5,Tom Brown's School days,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,472,"['movie', 'nice', 'classic', 'boy', 'experience', 'Rugby', 'boys', 'school', 'England', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'settings', 'are', 'mid', '1800', 'story', 'school', 'head', 'master', 'how', 'boys', 'are', 'affected', 'changes', 'remove', 'bad', 'elements', 'school', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'when', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'was', 'head', 'master', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'etc', 'would', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'clean', 'movies']",N/A

The film reproduction left a tiny something to be desired - not always clear - however most of the time it was clear. It was occasionally hard to hear unless I turned the sound up loud.  However, this often happens with old reproduced movies, it can't be helped.
