1076185,A2WV4Z7NKIDEMA,B000QGE842,CalgaryAlphan,"[25, 26]","Originally titled ""The Taxman"" and then sometimes known as ""Promise Her Anything"" or ""Love andDebt"", this movie had never received a wide release until now. (And due to the different titles thereis great confusion amongst sites like IMDB and Amazon about which movie is which!Maybe they'll eventually sort it out now that this DVD release has happened.)""Nothing To Declare"" is a warm, charming, funny, entertaining, audience-friendly and endearing lookat a small town in Canada (called Putterton) which has a long and secret history of notpaying taxes - at all! A new taxman (or woman, as the case may be) comes to town for anaudit and everything snowballs from there. Compounding the town's problems is a largecommercial Wal-Mart-type store (personified by the Devilish cigar-chomping PatrickBergin) that wants to open up and will likely mean the end of many of the small family-runbusinesses on Main Street.The lead character, George Putter (of the founding family of Putterton), is played by thevery appealing and talented Billy Zane, who at the time was hot off his success in JamesCameron's ""Titanic"" and quite famously got involved in this movie by accident (there weretwo movies being filmed called ""The Taxman"" and Billy's agent mixed them up and got himinvolved in the wrong picture - but Billy liked it and decided to sign on.) Billy plays his partwith a good degree of sensitivity, and a touch of goofy charm, which works equally wellthrough the films dramatic and comedic moments.This is also the last theatrical film in which Barry Morse has appeared - and if it does indeed endup being his final theatrical film, it is certainly a very worthy one! He plays George Putter'sgreat-great-grandfather, who returns as a ghost to give guidance to young George. Barryis absolutely perfectly cast in this role and it is a delight to see him feature significantlyand repeatedly throughout the film. He brings a strength and a theatricality (and a bit of amischievous charm!) to the Reverend Adam Putter - a role which, to my eye, encapsulatesan almost perfect late-career Barry Morse part. There is simply so much of ""Barry"" and histrademark gestures and expressions (and vocal intonations!) in this performance - He clearlyrelishes the opportunity to be funny, touching, and dramatic - what more could an actor(or his fans) want than that?I'd love to say more, but I'll be in danger of giving away too much for those of you who'venot seen it yet. I will just add a couple fast notes about the DVD release itself. Presentedhere, the film is in a Full Screen format (not Widescreen). I have no idea why, as this was atheatrical film and certainly filmed in Widescreen. Why it wouldn't be released that way isbeyond me. Anyway, having a Widescreen television, I just switched the settings over andwatched it in Widescreen anyway. I found it to be very well framed and composed, anddidn't have any sense that I was missing out on the parts of the image I wasn't seeing. So,no real problem there. Also, as might be expected, there are no extras on this release. Butwho's complaining? With such a treat of a film finally finding wide release, I am more thanhappy with the DVD product as it stands.So, to wrap up, ""Nothing To Declare"" is a magical joy of a movie. It makes you laugh andalso touches your heart. I recommend it very highly.",5,A Magical Joy of a Film,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,3336,"['Originally', 'titled', 'Taxman', 'then', 'sometimes', 'known', 'Promise', 'Her', 'Anything', 'Love', 'andDebt', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'received', 'wide', 'release', 'now', 'due', 'different', 'titles', 'thereis', 'great', 'confusion', 'amongst', 'sites', 'IMDB', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'sort', 'out', 'now', 'DVD', 'release', 'happened', 'Nothing', 'Declare', 'warm', 'charming', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'audience-friendly', 'endearing', 'lookat', 'small', 'town', 'Canada', 'called', 'Putterton', 'long', 'secret', 'history', 'notpaying', 'taxes', 'new', 'taxman', 'woman', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'town', 'anaudit', 'everything', 'snowballs', 'there', 'Compounding', 'town', 'problems', 'largecommercial', 'Wal-Mart-type', 'store', 'personified', 'Devilish', 'cigar-chomping', 'PatrickBergin', 'open', 'up', 'will', 'likely', 'mean', 'end', 'many', 'small', 'family-runbusinesses', 'Main', 'Street.The', 'lead', 'character', 'George', 'Putter', 'founding', 'family', 'Putterton', 'played', 'thevery', 'appealing', 'talented', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'hot', 'success', 'JamesCameron', 'Titanic', 'quite', 'famously', 'got', 'involved', 'movie', 'accident', 'movies', 'being', 'filmed', 'called', 'Taxman', 'Billy', 'agent', 'mixed', 'up', 'got', 'himinvolved', 'wrong', 'picture', 'Billy', 'liked', 'decided', 'sign', 'Billy', 'partwith', 'good', 'degree', 'sensitivity', 'touch', 'goofy', 'charm', 'equally', 'films', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'moments.This', 'also', 'last', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Barry', 'Morse', 'appeared', 'indeed', 'endup', 'being', 'final', 'theatrical', 'film', 'certainly', 'very', 'worthy', 'one', 'George', ""Putter'sgreat-great-grandfather"", 'who', 'ghost', 'give', 'guidance', 'young', 'George', 'Barryis', 'absolutely', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'delight', 'see', 'feature', 'significantlyand', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'strength', 'theatricality', 'bit', 'amischievous', 'charm', 'Reverend', 'Adam', 'Putter', 'role', 'eye', 'encapsulatesan', 'almost', 'perfect', 'late-career', 'Barry', 'Morse', 'part', 'simply', 'so', 'much', 'Barry', 'histrademark', 'gestures', 'expressions', 'vocal', 'intonations', 'performance', 'opportunity', 'be', 'funny', 'touching', 'dramatic', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'actor', 'fans', 'want', ""'d"", 'love', 'say', 'more', ""'ll"", 'be', 'danger', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', ""who'venot"", 'seen', 'yet', 'will', 'just', 'add', 'couple', 'fast', 'notes', 'DVD', 'release', 'Presentedhere', 'film', 'Full', 'Screen', 'format', 'not', 'Widescreen', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'atheatrical', 'film', 'certainly', 'filmed', 'Widescreen', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'way', 'Anyway', 'having', 'Widescreen', 'television', 'just', 'switched', 'settings', 'andwatched', 'Widescreen', 'anyway', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'framed', 'composed', 'anddid', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'was', 'missing', 'out', 'parts', 'image', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'So', 'real', 'problem', 'there', 'Also', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'extras', 'release', 'Butwho', 'complaining', 'treat', 'film', 'finally', 'finding', 'wide', 'release', 'am', 'more', 'thanhappy', 'DVD', 'product', 'wrap', 'up', 'Nothing', 'Declare', 'magical', 'joy', 'movie', 'andalso', 'touches', 'heart', 'recommend', 'very', 'highly']",N/A

He can play the meanest of meanies(Titanic) or, as in this on, likeable, goofy, nice guy.The story takes place in small town, Putterton, Canada where for years the town folk haven't paid their taxes.  In comes a tax woman Valerie Valois who is set upon, deceptively, by the last remaining Putter(Zane).  His reluctant job is to distract her investigation and also save the town from a big developer.  Romance ensues, problems flow as the truth will out, but all quite, gently predictable.It's a family film, but the kids won't like it- too boring for them.  But with no swearing, sex and violence- that's a plus.  The snowy burg(filmed in Canada) and populace are cute, and the story, very, very, very mild.It has Barry Morse- remember him from 'The Fugitive' as Det. Gerard chasing poor David Janssen around TV every week?  Both of Zane's love interest, add Clare Sims(another obscure actress) as the disgruntled girlfriend are good enough, but somewhat undeveloped.  Zane works in the Putter store and sculpts with long often tied back locks, does some slapstick, tries his best to pull everything together. He's quirky and sweet.A few laughs.
